Now you may join the Elks, my friend. And I may join the Shriners. And other men may carry cards. As members of the Diners. Still others wear a golden key. Or small Greek letter pin. But I have learned there's one great club. That all of us are in. There is a Brotherhood of Man. A Benevolent Brotherhood of Man. A noble tie that binds. All human hearts and minds. Into one Brotherhood of Man. Your lifelong membership is free. Keep a-givin' each brother all you can. Oh aren't you proud to be in that fraternity. The great big Brotherhood of Man?. Now you see Wally. I want you to remember that. Before you consider firing Mr. Bigley. You see, I know what's on your mind. You'd like to clear the whole crowd from top to bottom. That's the obvious move. But stop and think. One man may seem incompetent. Another not make sense. While others look like quite a waste. Of company expense. They need a brother's leadership. So please don't do them in. Remember mediocrity. Is not a mortal sin. They're in the Brotherhood of Man. Dedicated to giving all we can. Oh, aren't you proud to be in that fraternity. The great big Brotherhood of Man?. (Instrumental). No kidding! Is there really a Brotherhood of Man?. (Yes you're a Brother, you are a Brother). A benevolent Brotherhood of Man. (Oh yes, oh yes!). A noble tie that binds. All human hearts and minds. Into one Brotherhood of Man. (Oh yes!). Your lifelong membership is free. Keep a-givin' each brother all you can. Oh aren't you proud to be in that fraternity. The great big Brotherhood of Man?. Oh, that noble feeling,. Feels like bells are pealing,. Down with double-dealing,. Oh Brother! You, you got me. Me, I got you, you!. Oh, that noble feeling. Feels like bells are pealing. Down with double-dealing. Oh Brother! You, you got me. Me, I got you, you!. Oh, that noble feeling.

Now you may join the Elks, my friend. And I may join the Shriners. And other men may carry cards. As members of the Diners. Still others wear a golden key. Or small Greek letter pin. But I have learned there's one great club. That all of us are in. There is a Brotherhood of Man. A Benevolent Brotherhood of Man. A noble tie that binds. All human hearts and minds. Into one Brotherhood of Man. Your lifelong membership is free. Keep a-givin' each brother all you can. Oh aren't you proud to be in that fraternity. The great big Brotherhood of Man?. Now you see Wally. I want you to remember that. Before you consider firing Mr. Bigley. You see, I know what's on your mind. You'd like to clear the whole crowd from top to bottom. That's the obvious move. But stop and think. One man may seem incompetent. Another not make sense. While others look like quite a waste. Of company expense. They need a brother's leadership. So please don't do them in. Remember mediocrity. Is not a mortal sin. They're in the Brotherhood of Man. Dedicated to giving all we can. Oh, aren't you proud to be in that fraternity. The great big Brotherhood of Man?. (Instrumental). No kidding! Is there really a Brotherhood of Man?. (Yes you're a Brother, you are a Brother). A benevolent Brotherhood of Man. (Oh yes, oh yes!). A noble tie that binds. All human hearts and minds. Into one Brotherhood of Man. (Oh yes!). Your lifelong membership is free. Keep a-givin' each brother all you can. Oh aren't you proud to be in that fraternity. The great big Brotherhood of Man?. Oh, that noble feeling,. Feels like bells are pealing,. Down with double-dealing,. Oh Brother! You, you got me. Me, I got you, you!. Oh, that noble feeling. Feels like bells are pealing. Down with double-dealing. Oh Brother! You, you got me. Me, I got you, you!. Oh, that noble feeling.
