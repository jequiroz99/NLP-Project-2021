very slowly,"Tick tock, the moonlight's hummin'. My finger's on the button and my hormones' drummin'. Slow down we're moving too fast. Better wait a minute make the good times last. I've learned somethin' bout livin'. You don't get nothing if you don't stop givin'. We both know that we got so much. But there ain't no rush. Wanna love you slowly. When you slide on down. Wanna love you slowly. And turn that body round. You won't be able to control me. When the light's low down. Wanna love you slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly. Slowly. Hold tight, love is all I need. I guess it's sweeter when it's more than just a tease. Let me hold you close enough to stick. Love is an illusion lets play that trick. Slow hand moving down my back. If you get the chance you feel my heart attack. Real love's never been a crime. Wanna take my time. Wanna love you slowly. When you slide on down. Wanna love you slowly. And turn that body round. You won't be able to control me. When the light's low down. Wanna love you slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly. Slowly. Ah-ah, oh-oh, ooh-ooh. Slowly. Ah-ah, oh-oh, ooh-ooh. Slowly yeah. Ah-ah, oh-oh, ooh-ooh (real love). If you get the chance you feel my heart attack. Ah-ah, oh-oh, ooh-ooh (real love). Real love's never been a crime. Wanna love you slowly. When you slide on down. Wanna love you slowly. And turn that body round. You won't be able to control me. When the light's low down. Wanna love you slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly. Slowly. Slowly. Ah-ah, oh-oh, ooh-ooh. Slowly. Ah-ah, oh-oh, ooh-ooh. Slowly yeah. Ah-ah, oh-oh, ooh-ooh. [Repeat to Fade]."
walkaway,There's a river of tears I need to cry. Been holding back for years. There's a mountain so high i need to climb. To wipe away the fears. Solitude and loneliness. Have been a friend of mine. As I'm turning my back on emptiness. I leave them all behind. Who knows. Just where I'm going. Does tomorrow belong to me. Walk away this time with my head up high. Walk away just me and myself. Walk away with pride nothing left to hide. But it just feels right to be one. And just walkaway. I could never forget how hard I tried. When we were oh so young. Just one tender moment I cannot find. Well maybe I had none. Strength will be by my side. Although I feel afraid. But I know it's too late for this goodbye. There's nothing left to say. Who knows. Just where I'm going. Does tomorrow belong to me. Walk away this time with my head held high. Walk away just me and myself. Walk away with pride nothing left to hide. But it just feels right to be one. And just walkaway this time. One day you'll realise. That the tears you saw in my eyes. Will be there forever. Walk away this time with my head up high. Walk away just me and myself. Walk away with pride nothing left to hide. But it just feels right to be one. And just walkaway. Just walkaway. And just walkaway.
