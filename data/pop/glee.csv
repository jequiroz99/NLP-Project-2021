Up and down the boulevard. Their shadows searching in the night. Streetlights, people. Livin' just to find emotion. Hidin', somewhere in the night. Don't stop believin'. Hold on to the feelin'.

an innocent man,Some people stay far away from the door. If there's a chance of it opening up. They hear a voice in the hall outside. And hope that it just passes by. Some people live with the fear of a touch. And the anger of having been a fool. They will not listen to anyone. So nobody tells them a lie. I know you're only protecting yourself. I know you're thinking of somebody else. Someone who hurt you. But I'm not above. Making up for the love. You've been denying you could ever feel. I'm not above doing anything. To restore your faith if I can. Some people see through the eyes of the old. Before they ever get a look at the young. I'm only willing to hear you cry. Because I am an innocent man. I am an innocent man. Oh yes I am. Some people say they will never believe. Another promise they hear in the dark. Because they only remember too well. They heard somebody tell them before. Some people sleep all alone every night. Instead of taking a lover to bed. Some people find that's it's easier to hate. Than to wait anymore. I know you don't want to hear what I say. I know you're gonna keep turning away. But I've been there and if I can survive. I can keep you alive. I'm not above going through it again. And although this is a fight I can lose. The accused is an innocent man. I am an innocent man. Oh yes I am. I am an innocent man. Oh yes I am. An innocent man

black or white,"I took my baby on a Saturday bang. Boy is that girl with you. Yes we're one and the same. Now I believe in miracles. And a miracle has happened tonight. But, if you're thinkin' about my baby. It don't matter if you're black or white. They print my message in the Saturday Sun. I had to tell them. I ain't second to none. And I told about equality. And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right. But, if you're thinkin' about my baby. It don't matter if you're black or white. I am tired of this devil. I am tired of this stuff. I am tired of this business. Sew when the going gets rough. I ain't scared of your brother. I ain't scared of no sheets. I ain't scared of nobody. Girl, when the going gets mean. (L. T. B. Rap performance). Protection. For gangs, clubs and nations. Causing grief in human relations. It's a turf war on a global scale. I'd rather hear both sides of the tale. See, it's not about races. Just places, faces. Where your blood comes from is where your space is. I've seen the bright get duller. I'm not going to spend my life being a color. Don't tell me you agree with me. When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye. But, if you're thinkin' about my baby. It don't matter if you're black or white. I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby. It don't matter if you're black or white. I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother. It don't matter if you're black or white. It's black, it's white. It's tough for you to get by. It's black, it's white, whoo. It's black, it's white. It's tough for you to get by. It's black, it's white, whoo"

Well, I don't know if I believe that's true. But I know I'm who I am today. Because I knew you. Like a comet pulled from orbit. As it passes a sun. Like a stream that meets a boulder. Halfway through the wood. Who can say if I've been changed for the better?. But because I knew you. I have been changed for good. It well may be. That we will never meet again. In this lifetime. So let me say before we part. So much of me. Is made of what I learned from you. You'll be with me. Like a handprint on my heart. And now whatever way our stories end. I know you have re-written mine. By being my friend. Like a ship blown from its mooring. By a wind off the sea. Like a seed dropped by a skybird. In a distant wood. Who can say if I've been changed for the better?. But because I knew you. Because I knew you. I have been changed for good. And just to clear the air. I ask forgiveness. For the things I've done you blame me for. But then, I guess we know. There's blame to share. And none of it seems to matter anymore. Like a comet pulled from orbit. As it passes a sun. Like a stream that meets a boulder. Halfway through the wood. Who can say if I've been changed for the better?. But because I knew you. I have been changed for good. Who can say if I've been changed for the better?. I do believe I have been changed for the better. And because I knew you. Because I knew you. Because I knew you. I have been changed for good..

The hourglass on the table. The walk before the run. The breath before the kiss, and the fear before the flames. Have you ever felt this way?. Lalalalala. There you are, sitting in the garden. Clutching my coffee, calling me sugar. You called me sugar. Have you ever wished for an endless night?. Lassoed the moon and the stars. And pulled that rope tight?. Have you ever held your breath and asked yourself. ""will it ever get better than tonight? "". Tonight"

Somewhere after midnight. In my wildest fantasy. Somewhere just beyond my reach. There's someone reaching back for me. Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat. It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet. I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night. He's gotta be strong. And he's gotta be fast. And he's gotta be fresh from the fight. I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light. He's gotta be sure. And it's gotta be soon. And he's gotta be larger than life. I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night. Up where the mountains meet the heavens above. Out where the lightning splits the sea. I would swear that there's someone somewhere. Watching me. Through the wind and the chill and the rain. And the storm and the flood. I can fell his approach. Like a fire in my blood. I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night. He's gotta be strong. And he's gotta be fast. And he's gotta be fresh from the fight. I need a hero.

Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly. Will it ever stop yo I don't know. Turn off the lights and I'll glow. To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal. Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle. Dance go rush to the speaker that booms. I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom. Deadly when I play a dope melody. Anything less than the best is a felony. Love it or leave it you better gang way. You better hit bull's eye the kid don't play. If there was a problem yo I'll solve it. Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it. CHORUS. Ice ice baby vanillla (x4). Now that the party is jumping. With the bass kicked in and the vegas are pumpin'. Quick to the point to the point no faking. I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon. Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble. I go crazy when I hear a cymbal. And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo. I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo. Rollin' in my 5.0. With my rag-top down so my hair can blow. The girlies on standby waving just to say hi. Did you stop no I just drove by. Kept on pursuing to the next stop. I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block. The block was dead. Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue. Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis. Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis. Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine. Shay with a guage and Vanilla with a nine. Ready for the chumps on the wall. The chumps acting ill because they're so full of eight balls. Gunshots rang out like a bell. I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells. Falling on the concrete real fast. Jumped in my car slammed on the gas. Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed. I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack. Police on the scene you know what I mean. They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends. If there was a problem yo I'll solve it. Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it. REPEAT CHORUS. Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet. Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it. My town that created all the bass sound. Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground. 'Cause my style's like a chemical spill. Feasible rhymes that you can invision and feel. Conducted and formed. it's a hell of a concept.

Repeat the sounding joy,. Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy.. No more let sins and sorrows grow,. Nor thorns infest the ground;. He comes to make His blessings flow. Far as the curse is found,. Far as the curse is found,. Far as, far as, the curse is found.. He rules the world with truth and grace,. And makes the nations prove. The glories of His righteousness,. And wonders of His love,. And wonders of His love,. And wonders, wonders, of his love."
juke box hero,"Standing in the rain with his head hung low. Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold-out show. Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene. Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream. He heard one guitar, just blew him away. He saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day. Bought a beat up six-string, in a second-hand store. Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure. That one guitar felt good in his hands, didn't take long to understand. Just one guitar, swung way down low. Was a one way ticket, only one way to go. So he started rocking, ain't never gonna stop. Gotta keep on rocking, someday gonna make it to the top. And be a juke box hero (got stars in his eyes), he's a juke box hero. He took one guitar (juke box hero - stars in his eyes). Juke box hero (stars in his eyes), he'll come alive tonight. In a town without a name, in a heavy down port. Thought he'd cast his own shadow by the backstage door. Like a trip through the past, from that day in the rain. That one guitar played his whole life chain. Now he needs to keep rocking, he just can't stop. Gotta keep on rocking, that boy has got to stay on top. And be a juke box hero (got stars in his eyes). He's a juke box hero (got stars in his eyes). Yeah a juke box hero (got stars in his eyes). That one guitar (stars in his eyes), he'll come alive, come alive tonight. Yeah, he's gotta keep rocking, he just can't stop. Gotta keep on rocking, that boy has got to stay on top. And be a juke box hero (got stars in his eyes). He's a juke box hero (got stars in his eyes). And just one guitar (juke box hero) put stars in his eyes. Now he's just a juke box hero. Juke box hero, juke box hero, he's got stars in his eyes. Stars in his eyes. por: yago farias"

lei it go,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight. Not a footprint to be seen. A kingdom of isolation. And it looks like I'm the queen. And the wind is howling like this swirling storm inside. Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried. Don't let them in, don't let them see. Be the good girl you always have to be. Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know. Well, now they know. Let it go, let it go. Can't hold it back anymore. Let it go, let it go. Turn away and slam the door. I don't care. What they're going to say. Let the storm rage on. The cold never bothered me anyway. It's funny how some distance. Makes everything seem small. And the fears that once controlled me. Can't get to me at all. It's time to see what I can do. To test the limits and break through.

loser,"In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey. Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie. With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables. Dog food stalls. with the beefcake pantyhose. Kill the headlights and put it in neutral. Stock car flaming with a loser. and the cruise control. Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D. Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat. Someone keeps saying, I'm insane to complain. About a shotgun wedding. and a stain on my shirt. Don't believe everything that you breathe. You get a parking violation. and a maggot on your sleeve. So shave your face with some mace in the dark. Saving all your food stamps. And burning' down the trailer park. Yo, cut it. Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. The forces of evil in a bozo nightmare. Banned all the music with a phony gas chamber.

He hung himself with a guitar string. I slap the turkey neck. and it's hanging' from a pigeon wing. You can't write if you can't relate. Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate. And my time is a piece of wax, falling on a termite. Who's choking on the splinters. Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. Soy un perdedor.

And in a manger cold and dark. Mary's little boy was born. Hark, now hear the angels sing. A king was born today. And man will live forevermore. Because of Christmas Day.

no surrender,"Well, we bursted out of class. Had to get away from those fools. We learned more from a 3-minute record, baby. Than we ever learned in school. Tonight I hear the neighborhood drummer sound. I can feel my heart begin to pound. You say you're tired and you just want to close your eyes. And follow your dreams down. Well, we made a promise we swore we'd always remember. No retreat, baby, no surrender. Like soldiers on the winter's night. With a vow to defend. No retreat, baby, no surrender. Well, now young faces grow sad and old. And hearts of fire grow cold. We swore blood brothers against the wind. And I'm ready to grow young again. And I hear your sister's voice calling us home. Across the open yards. Well even we can cut someplace of our own. With these drums and these guitars. 'Cause we made a promise we swore we'd always remember. No retreat, baby, no surrender. Blood brothers on a summer's night. With a vow to defend. No retreat, baby, no surrender. Now out on the streets tonight the lights are growing dim. And the walls of my room are closing in. But it's good to see your smiling face. And to hear your voice again. Now we can sleep in the twilight. By the river bed. With a wide open country in our hearts. And these romantic dreams in our hands. 'Cause we made a promise we swore we'd always remember. No retreat, baby, no surrender. Blood brothers on a summer's night. With a vow to defend. No retreat, baby, no surrender"
no time at all,"June. When you are as old as I, my dear. And I hope that you never are. You will woefully wonder why, my dear. Through your cataracts and catarrh. You could squander away or sequester. A drop of a precious year. For when your best days are yester. The rest'er twice as dear. What good is a field on a fine summer night. When you sit all alone with the weeds?. Or a succulent pear if with each juicy bite. You spit out your teeth with the seeds?. Before it's too late stop trying to wait. For fortune and fame you're secure of. For there's one thing to be sure of, mate. There's nothing to be sure of!. Oh, it's time to start livin'. Time to take a little from this world we're given. Time to take time, cause spring will turn to fall. In just no time at all. I've never wondered if I was afraid. When there was a challenge to take. I never thought about how much I weighed. When there was still one piece of cake. Maybe it's meant the hours I've spent. Feeling broken and bent and unwell. But there's still no cure more heaven-sent. As the chance to raise some hell. Everybody. All. Oh, it's time to start livin'. Time to take a little from this world we're given. Time to take time, cause spring will turn to fall. In just no time at all. Now when the drearies do attack. And a siege of the sads begins. I just throw these noble shoulders back. And lift these noble chins. Give me a man who is handsome and strong. Someone who's stalwart and steady. Give me a night that's romantic and long. And give me a month to get ready. Now I could waylay some aging roue. And persuade him to play in some cranny. But it's hard to believe I'm being led astray. By a man who calls me granny. All. Oh, it's time to start livin'. Time to take a little from this world we're given. Time to take time, cause spring will turn to fall. In just no time at all. Oh, it's time to start livin'. Time to take a little from this world we're given. Time to take time, cause spring will turn to fall. In just no time at all. Sages tweet that age is sweet. Good deeds and good work earns you laurels. But what could make you feel more obsolete. Than being noted for your morals?. Here is a secret I never have told. Maybe you'll understand why. I believe if I refuse to grow old. I can stay young till I die. Now, I've known the fears of sixty-six years. I've had troubles and tears by the score. But the only thing I'd trade them for. Is sixty-seven more. Oh, it's time to keep livin'. Time to keep takin' from this world we're given. You are my time, so I'll throw off my shawl. And watching your flings be flung all over. Makes me feel young all over. Bethe and boys. In just no time at all"

I remember doing the math like, ""yeah, I'm good at little league. "". A preconceived idea of what it all meant. For those that liked the same sex. Had the characteristics. The right wing conservatives think it's a decision. And you can be cured with some treatment and religion. Man-made rewiring of a predisposition. Playing God, aw nah here we go. America the brave still fears what we don't know. And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten. But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five-hundred years ago. I don't know. And I can't change. Even if I tried. Even if I wanted to. And I can't change. Even if I tried. Even if I wanted to. My love, My love, My love. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me. Have you read the Youtube comments lately?. ""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily. We become so numb to what we're saying. A culture founded from oppression. Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em. Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board. A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it. Gay is synonymous with the lesser. It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion. Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment. The same fight that led people to walk outs and sit ins. It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference!. And I can't change. Even if I tried. Even if I wanted to. My love,My love.My love. She keeps me warm (Love is patient).

But I can just figure it out and hope and pray. I told her my name and said ""It's nice to meet ya"". And then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila. I already know she's a keeper.

One thing led to another, now she's kissing my mouth. Warbler Soloist with The Warblers. I need you darling. Come on, set the tone. If you feel you're falling. Won't you let me know. Oh, oh, uh-oh.

Stops my bones from wondering just who I, who I. Who I am. Oh, who am I?. Humm, humm. Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end. Cause I could use some friends for a change. And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again. Some nights, I always win (I always win). But I still wake up, I still see your ghost. Oh lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for. What do I stand for?. What do I stand for?. Most nights, I don't know. So this is it?. I sold my soul for this?. Washed my hands of that for this?. I miss my mom and dad for this?. No, when I see stars. When I see stars, that's all they are. When I hear songs. They sound like a swan, so come on. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Well, this is it, guys, that is all. Five minutes in and I'm bored again. Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands. This one is not for the folks at home. Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go. Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?. My heart is breaking for my sister. And the con that she called ""love"". But when I look into my nephews eyes.... Man, you wouldn't believe. The most amazing things. That can come from.... Some terrible nights. The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream. I just had about you and me. I called you up, but we'd both agree. It's for the best you didn't listen. It's for the best we get our distance. For the best you didn't listen. It's for the best we get our distance"
some people,"Some people can get a thrill. Knitting sweaters and sitting still. That's okay for some people. Who don't know they're alive. Some people can thrive and bloom. Living life in the living room. That's perfect for some people. Of one hundred and five. But I at least gotta try. When I think of all the sights that I gotta see. And all the places I gotta play. All the things that I gotta be at. Come on, papa, what do you say?. Some people can be content. Playing bingo and paying rent. That's peachy for some people. For some hum-drum people to be. But some people ain't me!. I had a dream. A wonderful dream, papa. All about june in the orpheum circuit. Gimme a chance and I know I can work it. I had a dream. Just as real as can be, papa. There I was in mr. orpheum's office. And he was saying to me, ""rose. Get yourselves some new orchestrations. New routines and red velvet curtains. Get a feathered hat for the baby. Photographs in front of the theatre. Get an agent and in jig time. You'll be being booked in the big time"". Oh, what a dream. A wonderful dream, papa. And all that I need is eighty-eight bucks, papa. That's what he said, papa. Only eighty-eight bucks. Goodbye to blueberry pie. Good riddance to all the socials I had to go to. All the lodges I had to play. All the shriners I said hello to. Hey, l.a., I'm comin' your way!. Some people sit on their butts. Got the dream, yeah, but not the guts. That's living for some people. For some hum-drum people I suppose. Well, they can stay and rot!. But not rose!"

the living years,"Every generation. Blames the one before. And all of their frustrations. Come beating on your door. I know that I'm a prisoner. To all my father held so dear. I know that I'm a hostage. To all his hopes and fears. I just wish I could have told him. In the living years. Crumpled bits of paper. Filled with imperfect thought. Stilted conversations. I'm afraid that's all we've got. You say you just don't see it. He says it's perfect sense. You just can't get agreement. In this present tense. We all talk a different language. Talking in defence. Say it loud, say it clear. You can listen as well as you hear. It's too late when we die. To admit we don't see eye to eye. So we open up a quarrel. Between the present and the past. We only sacrifice the future. It's the bitterness that lasts. So don't yield to the fortunes. You sometimes see as fate. It may have a new perspective. On a different day. And if you don't give up,. And don't give in. You may just be OK. Say it loud, say it clear. You can listen as well as you hear. It's too late when we die. To admit we don't see eye to eye. I wasn't there that morning. When my father passed away. I didn't get to tell him. All the things I had to say.. I think I caught his spirit. Later that same year. I'm sure I heard his echo. In my baby's new born tears. I just wish I could have told him. In the living years. Say it loud, say it clear. You can listen as well as you hear. It's too late when we die. To admit we don't see eye to eye"

the trolley song,"With my high starched collar and my high topped shoes. And my hair piled high upon my head. I went to lose a jolly hour on the trolley. And lost my heart instead. With his light brown derby and his bright green tie. He was quite the handsomest of men. I started to yen. So I counted to ten. Then I counted to ten again. Clang, clang, clang went the trolley. Ding, ding, ding went the bell. Zing, zing, zing went my heart strings. From the moment I saw him I fell. Chug, chug, chug went the motor. Bump, bump, bump went the brake. Thump, thump, thump went my heart strings. When he smiled I could feel the car shake. He tipped his hat and took a seat. He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet. He asked my name, I held my breath. I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death. Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer. Plop, plop, plop went the wheels. Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings. As he started to go then I started to know how it feels. When the universe reels. The day was bright, the air was sweet. The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet. You tried to sing but couldn't squeak. In fact, you loved him so you couldn't even speak. Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer. Plop, plop, plop went the wheels. Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings. As he started to leave I took. Hold of his sleeve with my hand. And as if it were planned. He stayed on with me and it was grand just to stand. With his hand holding mine to the end of the line. Clang, clang, clang went the trolley. Zing, zing, zing, zing went my heart!"

the winner takes it all,"I don't wanna talk. About the things we've gone through. Though it's hurting me. Now it's history. I've played all my cards. And that's what you've done too. Nothing more to say. No more ace to play. The winner takes it all. The loser standing small. Beside the victory. That's a destiny. I was in your arms. Thinking I belonged there. I figured it made sense. Building me a fence. Building me a home. Thinking I'd be strong there. But I was a fool. Playing by the rules. The gods may throw a dice. Their minds as cold as ice. And someone way down here. Loses someone dear. The winner takes it all. The loser has to fall. It's simple and it's plain. Why should I complain?. But tell me, does she kiss. Like I used to kiss you?. Does it feel the same. When she calls your name?. Somewhere deep inside. You must know I miss you. But what can I say?. Rules must be obeyed. The judges will decide. The likes of me abide. Spectators of the show. Always staying low. The game is on again. A lover or a friend. A big thing or a small. The winner takes it all. I don't wanna talk. If it makes you feel sad. And I understand. You've come to shake my hand. I apologize. If it makes you feel bad. Seeing me so tense. No self-confidence. But you see. The winner takes it all. The winner takes it all. So the winner takes it all. And the loser has to fall. Throw a dice cold as ice. Way down here, someone weak. Takes it all, has to fall. Yes, it's plain. Why complain?"
there are worse things i can do,"There are worse things I could do. Than go with a boy or two. Even though the neighborhood thinks im trashy. And no good. I suppose it could be true. But there are worse things I could do,. I could flirt with all the guys. Smile at them and bat my eyes. Press against them when we dance. Make them think they stand a chance. Then refuse to see it through. Thats a thing id never do. I could stay home every night. Wait around for mr right. Take cold showers every day. And throw my life away. On a dream that won't come true.. I could hurt. Someone like me. Out of spite. Or jealousy. I dont steal and I dont lie. But I can feel and I can cry. In fact I'll bet you never knew. But to cry in front of you,. Thats the worse thing. I could... dooo!"
there's a light (over at the frankenstein place),"In the velvet darkness, of the blackest night. Burning ,bright, there's a guiding star. No matter what or who you are. There's a light over at the Frankenstein Place. There's a light burning in the fireplace. There's a light, light in the darkness of everybody's life. The darkness must go down the river of nights dreaming. Flow morphia slow, let the sun and light come streaming. Into my life, into my life. There's a light over at the Frankenstein Place. There's a light burning in the fireplace. There's a light, light in the darkness of everybody's life"

They called me a different name then. I think of all the things I did. And how I wish I knew what I know now. I see how far I've come and what I got right. When I was looking for that spotlight. I was looking for myself. Got over what I was afraid of. I showed them all that I was made of. More than trophies on a shelf. For all the battles that we lost. or might have won. I never stopped believing in the words we sung,. we sung. This time no one's gonna say goodbye. I keep you in this heart of mine. This time I know it's never over. No matter who or what I am.
