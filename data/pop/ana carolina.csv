and i love you so,And I love you so. The people ask me how. How I've lived till now. I tell them I don't know. I guess they understand. How lonely life has been. But life began again. The day you took my hand. And yes I know how lonely life can be. The shadows follow me. And the night won't set me free. But I don't let the evening get me down. Now that you're around me. And you love me too. Your thoughts are just for me. You set my spirit free. I'm happy that you do. The book of life is brief. Once the page is read. All but life is dead. This is my belief. And yes I know how lonely life can be. The shadows follow me. And the night won't set me free. But I don't let the evening get me down. Now that you're around me

fire,"I'm riding in your car, you turn on the radio. You pullin' me close, I just say no. I say I don't like it, but you know I'm a liar. 'Cause when we kiss, ooh, fire. Late at night, you're taking me home. You say you wanna stay, I say I wanna be alone. I say I don't love you, but you know I'm a liar. 'Cause when we kiss, ooh, fire. You had a hold on me right from the start. a grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart. My nerves all jumpin', actin' like a fool. Well, your kisses they burn, but my heart stays cool. Romeo and Juliet, Samson and Delilah. Baby, you can bet, a love they couldn't deny. My words say split, but my words they lie. 'Cause when we kiss, ooh, fire. Hot kisses like fire. I like what you're doing now, fire. Fill me up with fire, touching me burning me with fire"

o m√°gico de oz - somewhere over the rainbow,"Somewhere over the rainbow. Way up high. And the dreams that you dreamed of. Once in a lullaby. Somewhere over the rainbow. Blue birds fly. And the dreams that you dreamed of. Dreams really do come true. Someday I'll wish upon a star. Wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Where trouble melts like lemon drops. High above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me. Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly. And the dream that you dare to dream. Why, oh why can't I?. Well I see trees of green and. Red roses too,. I'll watch them bloom for me and you. And I think to myself. What a wonderful world. Well I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white. And the brightness of day. I like the dark and I think to myself. What a wonderful world. The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky. Are also on the faces of people passing by. I see friends shaking hands. Saying, ""How do you do?"". They're really saying, I... I love you. I hear babies cry and I watch them grow,. They'll learn much more. Than we'll know. And I think to myself. What a wonderful world. Someday I'll wish upon a star,. Wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Where trouble melts like lemon drops. High above the chimney top that's where you'll find me. Oh, Somewhere over the rainbow way up high. And the dream that you dare to dream. Why, oh why can't I?"
