this love,I was so high I did not recognize. The fire burning in her eyes. The chaos that controlled my mind. Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane. Never to return again. But always in my heart. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. I tried my best to feed her appetite. Keep her coming every night. So hard to keep her satisfied. Kept playing love like it was just a game. Pretending to feel the same. Then turn around and leave again. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. I'll fix these broken things. Repair your broken wings. And make sure everything's all right. My pressure on your hips. Sinking my fingertips. Into every inch of you. Cause I know that's what you want me to do. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And my heart is breaking in front of me.

But I just leave it there instead. No need to cry about it. I cannot live without it. Every time I wind up back at your door. Why do you do this to me?. You penetrate right through me. Every time I wind up back at your door. Three more days til I see your face. I’m afraid it’s far too much. Cook a meal and fix up the place. Dial your number, hang it up. If I took you for granted. I apologize for acting tough. You’re my reason for living. And there’s no way I’m giving up. Don't need to cry about it. I cannot live without it. Every time I wind up back at your door. Why do you do this to me?. You penetrate right through me. Every time I wind up back at your door. Now every evening is a bitter fight. And I'm eating home alone on a friday night. I know what your friends say. You're just wasting your love and time. I will never let you change your mind. No need to cry about it. I cannot live without it. Every time I wind up back at your door. Why do you do this to me?. You penetrate right through me. Every time I wind up back at your door. No need to cry about it. I may just die without it. Every time I wind up back at your door.

infatuation,"Baby, I don't want to spend my life on trial. For something that I did not do. And maybe if you stopped and looked around some time. I wouldn't pass right by you.

And when you have decided that you've had enough. Just tell me where I need to be. Now her face is something that I never had. To ever deal with before.

simple kind of lovely,Leaning on a tree trunk. Thinking all the same junk. Falling in and out of a dream. Back and forth I'm swaying. I'm contemplating staying. Laying and decaying. When I know I must leave. Where do I aim when I shoot the breeze?. How do I calm myself at times like these?. I need a simple kind of lovely. And the *thought* is just a novelty. You can spend the whole time. Dangling from a grape vine. Standing underneath you. When they cut you free. What about when the sun leaves?. And what about all those bad dreams?. Who will walk you back into reality?. I wish things could be like this everyday. But I know that I could never live this way. It was just a simple kind of lovely. And the memories will be ok. The memories will be ok. Memories will be ok
stereo hearts,"My heart's a stereo. It beats for you, so listen close. Hear my thoughts in every note oh oh. Make me your radio. Turn me up when you feel low. This melody was meant for you. To sing along to my stereo. If I was just another dusty record on the shelf. Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?. And if I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?. Like with your hands ""look Travie, I can handle that"". Furthermore I apologize for any skipping tracks. It's just this last girl that played me left a couple of cracks. I used to, used to, used to now I'm over that. Cos holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts. If I could only find a note to make you understand. I'd sing it softly in your ears and grab you by the hand. Keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune. And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you. My heart's a stereo. It beats for you, so listen close. Hear my thoughts in every note oh oh. Make me your radio. Turn me up when you feel low. This melody was meant for you. To sing along to my stereo. To my stereo. So sing along to my stereo. If I was an old school 50 pound boombox. Would you hold me on your should wherever you walked?. Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops. And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop?. And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me. When you have to purchase mad D batteries. I appreciate every mixtape your friends make. You never know, we come and go. Like on the interstate. I think I finally found a note to make you understand. If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand. Keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune. You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you. My heart's a stereo. It beats for you, so listen close. Hear my thoughts in every note oh oh. Make me your radio. Turn me up when you feel low. This melody was meant for you. To sing along to my stereo. Sing to my stereo. So sing along to my stereo. I only pray you never leave me behind (never leave me). Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard). I'd take your head and hold it closer to mine. Thought love was dead. But now you're changing my mind (come on). My heart's a stereo. It beats for you, so listen close. Hear my thoughts in every note oh oh. Make me your radio. Turn me up when you feel low. This melody was meant for you. To sing along to my stereo. To my stereo. So sing along to my stereo"

sunday morning,Sunday morning rain is falling. Steal some covers share some skin. Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable. You twist to fit the mold that I am in. But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do. And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew. That someday it would lead me back to you. That someday it would lead me back to you. That may be all I need. In darkness she is all I see. Come and rest your bones with me. Driving slow on Sunday morning. And I never want to leave. Fingers trace your every outline. Paint a picture with my hands. Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm. Change the weather still together when it ends. That may be all I need. In darkness she is all I see. Come and rest your bones with me. Driving slow on Sunday morning. And I never want to leave. But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do. Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you. Singing someday it'll bring me back to you. Find a way to bring myself back home to you. And you may not know. That may be all I need. In darkness she is all I see. Come and rest your bones with me. Driving slow on Sunday morning
sweetest goodbye,Where you are seems to be. As far as an eternity. Outstretched arms open hearts. And if it never ends then when do we start?. I'll never leave you behind. Or treat you unkind. I know you understand. And with a tear in my eye. Give me the sweetest goodbye. That I ever did receive. Pushing forward and arching back. Bring me closer to heart attack. Say goodbye and just fly away. When you comeback. I have some things to say. How does it feel to know. You never have to be alone. When you get home. There must be someplace here. That only you and I could go. So I can show you how I. Dream away everyday. Try so hard to disregard. The rhythm of the rain that drops. And coincides with the beating of my heart. I'll never leave you behind. Or treat you unkind. I know you understand. And with a tear in my eye. Give me the sweetest goodbye. That I ever did receive. Pushing forward and arching back. Bring me closer to heart attack. Say goodbye and just fly away. When you come back. I have some things to say. How does it feel to know. You never have to be alone. When you get home?. There must be someplace here. That only you and I could go. So I can show you how I feel

the sun,"After school. Walking home. Fresh dirt under my fingernails. And I can smell hot asphalt. Cars screech to a halt to let me pass. And I cannot remember. What life was like through photographs. Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past. And sometimes it's a sad song. (Chorus). But I cannot forget. Refuse to regret. So glad I met you. Take my breath away. Make everyday. Worth all of the pain that I have gone through. And mama I've been cryin'. Cause things ain't how they used to be. She said the battle's almost won. And we're only several miles from the sun. Moving on down my street. I see people I won't ever meet. Think of her, take a breath. Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps. And sometimes it's a sad song. (Chorus). But I cannot forget. Refuse to regret. So glad I met you. Take my breath away. Make everyday. Worth all of the pain that I have gone through. And mama I've been cryin'. Cause things ain't how they used to be. She said the battle's almost won. And we're only several miles from the sun. The rhythm of her conversation. The perfection of her creation. The sex she slipped into my coffee. The way she felt when she first saw me. Hate to love and love to hate her. Like a broken record player. Back and forth and here and gone. And on and on and on and on. (Chorus). But I cannot forget. Refuse to regret. So glad I met you. Take my breath away. Make everyday. Worth all of the pain that I have gone through. And mama I've been cryin'. Cause things ain't how they used to be. She said the battle's almost won. And we're only several miles. She said the battle's almost won. And we're only several miles from the sun"
the way i was,Making love to a picture frame. One more time tonight. You can tell by the lines in her smile. Something is not right. Where are you hiding (hiding). She's on the outside. I'm on the inside crying (crying). Just another crazy boy. Hungry for your. Hot love. Wrap yourself around me like a. Warm glove. The emptiness leaves me and I. Feel the never need to. Go back to the way I was. The way I was. I tried and tried and tried and tried. But I have no concept of consequence. And I'm a master of self defence. Days get longer. Life gets shorter. She rips me like no other. So oh dripping from head to toe. Where are you hiding (hiding). She's on the outside. I'm on the inside crying (crying). Hot love. Wrap yourself around me like a. Warm glove. The emptiness leaves me and I. Feel the never need to. Go back to the way I was. The way I was. Hot love. Wrap yourself around me like a. Warm glove. The emptiness leaves me and I. Feel the never need to. Go back to the way I was. The way I was. I can't make the same mistake. If you lose my love. It was yours to take. Break down your door. Take a little more. When I need you around. And I'm so terrified of leaving. It's a new low. Try and pick me up again but. Let go see how far I get without you. Desperately need more of your. Hot love. Wrap yourself around me like a. Warm glove. The emptiness leaves me and I. Feel the never need to. Go back to the way I was. The way I was. Hot love. Wrap yourself around me like a. Warm glove. The emptiness leaves me and I. Feel the never need to. Go back to the way I was. The way I was
the way you look tonight,"Some day, when I'm awfully low,. When the world is cold,. I will feel a glow just thinking of you.... And the way you look tonight.. Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm. And your cheeks so soft,. There is nothing for me but to love you,. And the way you look tonight.. With each word your tenderness grows,. Tearing my fear apart.... And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,. It touches my foolish heart.. Lovely ... Never, ever change.. Keep that breathless charm.. Won't you please arrange it?. 'Cause I love you ... Just the way you look tonight.. And that laugh wrinkles your nose,. It touches my foolish heart. oohhhh. Lovely ... Never, ever change.. Keep that breathless charm.. Won't you please arrange it ?. 'Cause I love you ... Just the way you look tonight.. Mm, Mm, Mm, Mm,. Just the way you look tonight."
this love,I was so high I did not recognize. The fire burning in her eyes. The chaos that controlled my mind. Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane. Never to return again. But always in my heart. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. I tried my best to feed her appetite. Keep her coming every night. So hard to keep her satisfied. Kept playing love like it was just a game. Pretending to feel the same. Then turn around and leave again. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. I'll fix these broken things. Repair your broken wings. And make sure everything's all right. My pressure on your hips. Sinking my fingertips. Into every inch of you. Cause I know that's what you want me to do. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And my heart is breaking in front of me. She said Goodbye too many times before. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore...

And I don't trust you. Cause every time you're here. Your intentions are unclear. I spend every hour waiting for a phone call. That I know will never come. I used to think you were the one. Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all. You ain't ever coming back to me. That's not how things were supposed to be. You take my hand just to give it back. No other lover has ever done that. Do you remember. The way we used to melt. Do you remember how it felt. When I touched you. Oh cause I remember very well. And how long has it been. Since someone let you in. Has given what I gave to you. And at night when you sleep. Do you dream I would be there. Just for a minute or two do you?. You ain't ever coming back to me. That's not how things were supposed to be. You take my hand just to give it back. No other lover has ever done that. Heartache heartache I just have so much. A simple love with a complex touch. There is nothing you can say or do. I called to let you know I'm through with you. I ain't ever coming back to you

won't go home without you,"I asked her to stay, but she wouldn't listen. She left before I had the chance to say. The words that would mend the things that were broken. But now it's far too late, she's gone away. Every night you cry yourself to sleep. Thinking: ""Why does this happen to me?. Why does every moment have to be so hard?"". Hard to believe that. It's not over tonight. Just give me one more chance to make it right. I may not make it through the night. I won't go home without you. The taste of her breath, I'll never get over. The noises that she made kept me awake. The weight of things that remained unspoken. Built up so much it crushed us everyday. Every night you cry yourself to sleep. Thinking: ""Why does this happen to me?. Why does every moment have to be so hard?"". Hard to believe that. It's not over tonight. Just give me one more chance to make it right. I may not make it through the night. I won't go home without you. It's not over tonight. Just give me one more chance to make it right. I may not make it through the night. I won't go home without you. Of all the things I felt but never really shown. Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go. I should not ever let you go, oh oh oh. It's not over tonight. Just give me one more chance to make it right. I may not make it through the night. I won't go home without you. It's not over tonight. Just give me one more chance to make it right. I may not make it through the night. I won't go home without you. And I won't go home without you. And I won't go home without you. And I won't go home without you"

this love,I was so high I did not recognize. The fire burning in her eyes. The chaos that controlled my mind. Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane. Never to return again. But always in my heart. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. I tried my best to feed her appetite. Keep her coming every night. So hard to keep her satisfied. Kept playing love like it was just a game. Pretending to feel the same. Then turn around and leave again. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. I'll fix these broken things. Repair your broken wings. And make sure everything's all right. My pressure on your hips. Sinking my fingertips. Into every inch of you. Cause I know that's what you want me to do. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And my heart is breaking in front of me.

Trying to light up the dark?. I thought I saw you out there crying. I thought I heard you call my name. I thought I heard you out there crying. Just the same. And God, give us the reason. Youth is wasted on the young. It's hunting season. And this lamb is on the run. Searching for meaning. But are we all lost stars. Trying to light up the dark?"

as things collide,"You have this way of dipping in and out of side. As things collide.. Bridges burning softly in the night.. You have this way of falling in and out of time. As it goes by.

Saying ""where in the hell have you been,. Where are you going?"". I said:. ""I don't know, does this lonelyness show,. And if so does it ever end?"". And I've spoken with all the other angels,. They don't know what to do.. And I agree with them whole-heartedly,. I do.. You have this way of meaning everything and nothing to me. At the same time.. Returning my hello's with goodbye's.

back at your door,"From the moment the lights went off. Everything had changed. Lie awake in an empty room. In my head it all feels the same. Like the taste of the day you left. That still lingers on my breath. And the dampness of tears that left. A stain where you had wept. All alone with the negligee. That still hangs off of my bed. I keep meaning to give it away. But I just leave it there instead. No need to cry about it. I cannot live without it. Every time I wind up back at your door. Why do you do this to me?. You penetrate right through me. Every time I wind up back at your door. Three more days til I see your face. I’m afraid it’s far too much. Cook a meal and fix up the place. Dial your number, hang it up. If I took you for granted. I apologize for acting tough. You’re my reason for living. And there’s no way I’m giving up. Don't need to cry about it. I cannot live without it. Every time I wind up back at your door. Why do you do this to me?. You penetrate right through me. Every time I wind up back at your door. Now every evening is a bitter fight. And I'm eating home alone on a friday night. I know what your friends say. You're just wasting your love and time. I will never let you change your mind. No need to cry about it. I cannot live without it. Every time I wind up back at your door. Why do you do this to me?. You penetrate right through me. Every time I wind up back at your door. No need to cry about it. I may just die without it. Every time I wind up back at your door.

So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink. Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore. Since you walked out the door. And now I'm stuck living out that night again. I'm not falling apart. I heard you say you needed me now. What's the problem I can't see. You destroyed me, I won't fall apart again. I'm not falling apart. Take what you want. I will be just fine. You will be better off alone at night. Waiting and falling. Constantly calling out your name. Will it ever change?. Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore. Since you walked out the door. And now I'm stuck living out that night again. I'm not falling apart. I heard you say you needed me now. What's the problem I can't see. You destroyed me, I won't fall apart again.

Still afraid that I will desert you. Everyday. With every worthless word we get more far away. The distance between us makes it so hard to stay. But nothing lasts forever, but be honest, babe. It hurts, but it may be the only way. A bed that's warm with memories. Can heal us temporarily. The misbehaving only makes. The ditch between us so damn deep. Built a wall around my heart. Never let it fall apart. Strangely I wish secretly. It would fall down while I'm asleep. If you don't know,. Then you can't care. And you show up,. But you're not there. But I'm waiting.

But you're still too reluctant to accept my help. What a shame, I hope you find somewhere to place the blame. But until then the fact remains. Everyday.

And she will be loved. And she will be loved. And she will be loved. And she will be loved. I know where you hide. Alone in your car. Know all of the things that make you who you are. I know that goodbye means nothing at all. Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls. Tap on my window knock on my door. I want to make you feel beautiful. I don't mind spending everyday. Out on your corner in the pouring rain. Look for the girl with the broken smile. Ask her if she wants to stay awhile. And she will be loved. And she will be loved. And she will be loved. And she will be loved. Please don't try so hard to say goodbye. Please don't try so hard to say goodbye. I don't mind spending everyday. Out on your corner in the pouring rain. Try so hard to say goodbye"
shiver,You build me up. You knock me down. Provoke a smile. And make me frown. You are the queen of runaround. You know it's true. You chew me up. And spit me out. Enjoy the taste. I leave in your mouth. You look at me. I look at you. Neither of us know what to do. (Chorus:). There may not. Be another way to your heart. So I guess I'd better find a new way in. I shiver when I hear your name. Think about you but it's not the same. I won't be satisfied til I'm under your skin. Immobilized by the thought of you. Paralyzed by the sight of you. Hypnotized by the words you say. Not true but I believe them anyway. So come to bed It's getting late. There's no more time for us to waste. Remember how my body tastes. You feel your heart begin to race
shoot love,You gotta let it go. Cause we're losing grip now. It's about to go down. Would you let me talk to you?. You gotta let me know. Cause I'm on the edge now. Of a nervous breakdown. Cause I can't get through to you. I got my hands up screaming. Got my hands up screaming. Don't shoot love baby. Don't shoot love. Don't shoot love baby. Don't shoot. When you get that feeling. When you get that feeling. Don't shoot love baby. Don't shoot love. Don't shoot love baby. Don't shoot. You'll never let me go. Got me chained to your touch. Like a slave for you love. I'm ashamed to say it's true. Afraid to let you go. Cause without you I'm lost. And not matter the cost. I'm standing next to you. I got my hands up screaming. Got my hands up screaming. Don't shoot love baby. Don't shoot love. Don't shoot love baby. Don't shoot. When you get that feeling. When you get that feeling. Don't shoot love baby. Don't shoot love. Don't shoot love baby. Don't shoot. My back's against the wall tonight. So go ahead pull the trigger. Shoot the lights out. Go ahead pull the trigger. Shoot the lights off. I see the fear that's in your eyes. So go ahead pull the trigger. Shoot the lights off. Go ahead pull the trigger. Shoot. I got my hands up screaming. Got my hands up screaming. Don't shoot love baby. Don't shoot love. Don't shoot love baby. Don't shoot. When you get that feeling. When you get that feeling. Don't shoot love baby. Don't shoot love. Don't shoot love baby. Don't shoot
simple kind of lovely,Leaning on a tree trunk. Thinking all the same junk. Falling in and out of a dream. Back and forth I'm swaying. I'm contemplating staying. Laying and decaying. When I know I must leave. Where do I aim when I shoot the breeze?. How do I calm myself at times like these?. I need a simple kind of lovely. And the *thought* is just a novelty. You can spend the whole time. Dangling from a grape vine. Standing underneath you. When they cut you free. What about when the sun leaves?. And what about all those bad dreams?. Who will walk you back into reality?. I wish things could be like this everyday. But I know that I could never live this way. It was just a simple kind of lovely. And the memories will be ok. The memories will be ok. Memories will be ok
stereo hearts,"My heart's a stereo. It beats for you, so listen close. Hear my thoughts in every note oh oh. Make me your radio. Turn me up when you feel low. This melody was meant for you. To sing along to my stereo. If I was just another dusty record on the shelf. Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?. And if I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?. Like with your hands ""look Travie, I can handle that"". Furthermore I apologize for any skipping tracks. It's just this last girl that played me left a couple of cracks. I used to, used to, used to now I'm over that. Cos holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts. If I could only find a note to make you understand. I'd sing it softly in your ears and grab you by the hand. Keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune. And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you. My heart's a stereo. It beats for you, so listen close. Hear my thoughts in every note oh oh. Make me your radio. Turn me up when you feel low. This melody was meant for you. To sing along to my stereo. To my stereo. So sing along to my stereo. If I was an old school 50 pound boombox. Would you hold me on your should wherever you walked?. Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops. And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop?. And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me. When you have to purchase mad D batteries. I appreciate every mixtape your friends make. You never know, we come and go. Like on the interstate. I think I finally found a note to make you understand. If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand. Keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune. You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you. My heart's a stereo. It beats for you, so listen close. Hear my thoughts in every note oh oh. Make me your radio. Turn me up when you feel low. This melody was meant for you. To sing along to my stereo. Sing to my stereo. So sing along to my stereo. I only pray you never leave me behind (never leave me). Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard). I'd take your head and hold it closer to mine. Thought love was dead. But now you're changing my mind (come on). My heart's a stereo. It beats for you, so listen close. Hear my thoughts in every note oh oh. Make me your radio. Turn me up when you feel low. This melody was meant for you. To sing along to my stereo. To my stereo. So sing along to my stereo"

sunday morning,Sunday morning rain is falling. Steal some covers share some skin. Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable. You twist to fit the mold that I am in. But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do. And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew. That someday it would lead me back to you. That someday it would lead me back to you. That may be all I need. In darkness she is all I see. Come and rest your bones with me. Driving slow on Sunday morning. And I never want to leave. Fingers trace your every outline. Paint a picture with my hands. Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm. Change the weather still together when it ends. That may be all I need. In darkness she is all I see. Come and rest your bones with me. Driving slow on Sunday morning. And I never want to leave. But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do. Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you. Singing someday it'll bring me back to you. Find a way to bring myself back home to you. And you may not know. That may be all I need. In darkness she is all I see. Come and rest your bones with me. Driving slow on Sunday morning
sweetest goodbye,Where you are seems to be. As far as an eternity. Outstretched arms open hearts. And if it never ends then when do we start?. I'll never leave you behind. Or treat you unkind. I know you understand. And with a tear in my eye. Give me the sweetest goodbye. That I ever did receive. Pushing forward and arching back. Bring me closer to heart attack. Say goodbye and just fly away. When you comeback. I have some things to say. How does it feel to know. You never have to be alone. When you get home. There must be someplace here. That only you and I could go. So I can show you how I. Dream away everyday. Try so hard to disregard. The rhythm of the rain that drops. And coincides with the beating of my heart. I'll never leave you behind. Or treat you unkind. I know you understand. And with a tear in my eye. Give me the sweetest goodbye. That I ever did receive. Pushing forward and arching back. Bring me closer to heart attack. Say goodbye and just fly away. When you come back. I have some things to say. How does it feel to know. You never have to be alone. When you get home?. There must be someplace here. That only you and I could go. So I can show you how I feel

the sun,"After school. Walking home. Fresh dirt under my fingernails. And I can smell hot asphalt. Cars screech to a halt to let me pass. And I cannot remember. What life was like through photographs. Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past. And sometimes it's a sad song. (Chorus). But I cannot forget. Refuse to regret. So glad I met you. Take my breath away. Make everyday. Worth all of the pain that I have gone through. And mama I've been cryin'. Cause things ain't how they used to be. She said the battle's almost won. And we're only several miles from the sun. Moving on down my street. I see people I won't ever meet. Think of her, take a breath. Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps. And sometimes it's a sad song. (Chorus). But I cannot forget. Refuse to regret. So glad I met you. Take my breath away. Make everyday. Worth all of the pain that I have gone through. And mama I've been cryin'. Cause things ain't how they used to be. She said the battle's almost won. And we're only several miles from the sun. The rhythm of her conversation. The perfection of her creation. The sex she slipped into my coffee. The way she felt when she first saw me. Hate to love and love to hate her. Like a broken record player. Back and forth and here and gone. And on and on and on and on. (Chorus). But I cannot forget. Refuse to regret. So glad I met you. Take my breath away. Make everyday. Worth all of the pain that I have gone through. And mama I've been cryin'. Cause things ain't how they used to be. She said the battle's almost won. And we're only several miles. She said the battle's almost won. And we're only several miles from the sun"

I'm on the inside crying (crying). Just another crazy boy. Hungry for your. Hot love. Wrap yourself around me like a. Warm glove. The emptiness leaves me and I. Feel the never need to. Go back to the way I was. The way I was. I tried and tried and tried and tried. But I have no concept of consequence. And I'm a master of self defence. Days get longer. Life gets shorter. She rips me like no other. So oh dripping from head to toe. Where are you hiding (hiding). She's on the outside. I'm on the inside crying (crying). Hot love. Wrap yourself around me like a. Warm glove. The emptiness leaves me and I. Feel the never need to. Go back to the way I was. The way I was. Hot love. Wrap yourself around me like a. Warm glove. The emptiness leaves me and I.

When I need you around. And I'm so terrified of leaving. It's a new low. Try and pick me up again but. Let go see how far I get without you. Desperately need more of your. Hot love.

the way you look tonight,"Some day, when I'm awfully low,. When the world is cold,. I will feel a glow just thinking of you.... And the way you look tonight.. Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm. And your cheeks so soft,. There is nothing for me but to love you,. And the way you look tonight.. With each word your tenderness grows,. Tearing my fear apart.... And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,. It touches my foolish heart.. Lovely ... Never, ever change.. Keep that breathless charm.. Won't you please arrange it?. 'Cause I love you ... Just the way you look tonight.. And that laugh wrinkles your nose,. It touches my foolish heart. oohhhh. Lovely ... Never, ever change.. Keep that breathless charm.. Won't you please arrange it ?. 'Cause I love you ... Just the way you look tonight.. Mm, Mm, Mm, Mm,. Just the way you look tonight."
this love,I was so high I did not recognize. The fire burning in her eyes. The chaos that controlled my mind. Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane. Never to return again. But always in my heart. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. I tried my best to feed her appetite. Keep her coming every night. So hard to keep her satisfied. Kept playing love like it was just a game. Pretending to feel the same. Then turn around and leave again. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. I'll fix these broken things. Repair your broken wings. And make sure everything's all right. My pressure on your hips. Sinking my fingertips. Into every inch of you. Cause I know that's what you want me to do. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And my heart is breaking in front of me. She said Goodbye too many times before. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breaking in front of me. I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore...

through with you,Can you see me. Floating above your head. As you lay in bed. Thinking about everything. That you did not do. Cause saying I love you. Has nothing to do with meaning it. And I don't trust you. Cause every time you're here. Your intentions are unclear. I spend every hour waiting for a phone call. That I know will never come. I used to think you were the one. Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all. You ain't ever coming back to me. That's not how things were supposed to be. You take my hand just to give it back. No other lover has ever done that. Do you remember. The way we used to melt. Do you remember how it felt. When I touched you. Oh cause I remember very well. And how long has it been. Since someone let you in. Has given what I gave to you. And at night when you sleep. Do you dream I would be there. Just for a minute or two do you?. You ain't ever coming back to me. That's not how things were supposed to be. You take my hand just to give it back. No other lover has ever done that. Heartache heartache I just have so much. A simple love with a complex touch.

woman,"If I be so inclinded to climb up inside you. Would you tell me that the time just isn't right?. And if I ever find the key you hide so well,. Will you tell me that I can spend the night?. Leaving your smell on my coat. Leaving your taste on my shoulder. I still fail to understand what it is about this woman. Yeah, oh woh, woh woh. If I could bottle up the chills that you give me,. I would keep them in a jar next to my bed.. And if I should ever draw a picture of a woman,. It is you that would come flowing from my pen, yeah. Leaving your clothes on the floor. Making me walk out the door and. I still fail to understand what it is about this woman. Oooo, oh. Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun. And as she burned me,. I am screaming out for more.. Drink every drop of liquid heat that I've become,. Pop me open spit me out onto the floor.. Leaving your smell on my coat. Leaving your taste on my shoulder. I still fail to understand what it is about this woman. Leaving your smell on my coat. (Leaving your smell on my coat). Leaving your taste on my shoulder. (Leaving your taste on my shoulder). I still fail to understand what it is about this woman"
won't go home without you,"I asked her to stay, but she wouldn't listen. She left before I had the chance to say. The words that would mend the things that were broken. But now it's far too late, she's gone away. Every night you cry yourself to sleep. Thinking: ""Why does this happen to me?. Why does every moment have to be so hard?"". Hard to believe that. It's not over tonight. Just give me one more chance to make it right. I may not make it through the night. I won't go home without you. The taste of her breath, I'll never get over. The noises that she made kept me awake. The weight of things that remained unspoken. Built up so much it crushed us everyday. Every night you cry yourself to sleep. Thinking: ""Why does this happen to me?. Why does every moment have to be so hard?"". Hard to believe that. It's not over tonight. Just give me one more chance to make it right. I may not make it through the night. I won't go home without you. It's not over tonight. Just give me one more chance to make it right. I may not make it through the night. I won't go home without you. Of all the things I felt but never really shown. Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go. I should not ever let you go, oh oh oh. It's not over tonight. Just give me one more chance to make it right. I may not make it through the night. I won't go home without you. It's not over tonight. Just give me one more chance to make it right. I may not make it through the night. I won't go home without you. And I won't go home without you. And I won't go home without you. And I won't go home without you"
