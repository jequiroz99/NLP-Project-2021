If you just don't talk to me, babe.. I flow through my act. There's a question: Is she needed?. And decide all the man I can ever be.. Looking at the last 3 years like I did. I could never see us ending like this.. (Do you know?). Seeing your face no more on my pillow. Is a scene that's never ever happened to me.. (Do you know?). But after this episode I don't see. You could never tell the next thing life could be. Do you know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?. Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?.

only a woman,"Only a woman can take away your cold hard chill. Break your heart and make you love her still. Leave you thirsty when you've had your fill. Only a woman can sit you high up on a throne. Make you feel so damn alone. Leave you begging baby come back home. And it's only till she's gone. Could you see that you were wrong. Cause the seasons change and people come and go. But when love is fate best hold that woman close. Take the hard road back and fall down at her door. Cause that's your woman. That's all I know. Only a woman can make you fly so high you wanna touch the sun. When your wings melt and you come undone. Catches you when you fall, she's the only one. That steals your heart just like a thief. Makes you lay roses at your feet. But you know to kiss the rose, the thorns will make you bleed. And it's only till she's gone. Could you see that you were wrong. Cause the seasons change and people come and go. But when love is fate best hold that woman close. Take the hard road back and fall down at her door. Cause that's your woman. That's all I know. You thank God you found her. Ya can't live your life without her. And every little thing about her is all you need. All you need. Cause the seasons change and people come and go. But when love is fate best hold that woman close. Take the hard road back and fall down at her door. Cause that's your woman. That's all I know"
only you,Looking from a window above. It's like a story of love. Can you hear me.. Came back only yesterday. Moving further away. Won't you hear me.. All I needed was the love you gave. All I needed for another day. All I ever knew. Only you. Sometimes when I think of your name. And it's only a game. And I need you. Listening to the words that you say. Getting harder to stay. When I see you. All I needed was the love you gave. All I needed for another day. All I ever knew. Only you. This is gonna take a long time. And I wonder what's mine. Can't take no more.

Hold me down if my whole world went crazy. That's what she's spoke, just what she said. Now I gotta get her with the love I have. Now that's a joke. That talk is dead. Know I got to get over the love I had. The door I keep it open just in case she come back. Can't deal with the emotions to the point I'm sad. And I know my heart's broken but we got so attached. Baby come back I won't get no sleep. She more than I want and all that I need. Locked up my heart and threw away the key so. And when my baby come back. I'm crossing my T's dotting my I's. And now I can't eat. Out of my mind. And that's how it's gonna be so. There goes my baby, oh oh oh oh oh. Hey, hey, baby come back to me. There goes my baby, oh oh oh oh oh. Hey, hey, baby come back to me. Back to me. There goes my baby, oh oh oh oh oh. Hey, hey, baby come back to me. There goes my baby, oh oh oh oh oh. Hey, hey, baby come back to me. Back to me"
tired of being sorry,I don't know why. You want to follow me tonight. When the rest of the world. With whom I've crossed and I've quarreled. Let's me down so. For a thousand reasons that I know. To share forever the unrest. With all the demons I possess. Beneath the silver moon. Maybe you were right. But baby I was lonely. I don't want to fight. I'm tired of being sorry. Eighth and Ocean Drive. With all the vampires and their brides. We're all bloodless and blind. And longing for a life. Beyond the silver moon. Maybe you were right. But baby I was lonely. I don't want to fight. I'm tired of being sorry. I'm standing in the street. Crying out for you. No one sees me. But the silver moon. So far away – so outer space. I've trashed myself – I've lost my way. I've got to get to you. Maybe you were right. But baby I was lonely. I don't want to fight. I'm tired of being sorry. I'm standing in the street. Crying out for you. No one sees me. But the silver moon. Maybe you were right. But baby I was lonely. I don't want to fight. I'm tired of being sorry. I'm standing in the street. Crying out for you. No one sees me. But the silver moon

why not me?,Escaping nights without you. With shadows on the wall. My mind is running wild. Trying hard not to fall. You told me that you love me. But say I'm just a friend. My heart is broken up into pieces. Cos I know. I'll never free my soul. It's trapped between true love and being alone. When my eyes are closed. The greatest story told. I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor. Why oh why. Tell me why not me. Why oh why. We were meant to be. Baby I know I could be all you need. Why oh why oh why. I wanna love you. If you only knew how much I love you. So why not me. The day after tomorrow. I'll still be around. To catch you when you fall. And never let you down. You say that we're forever. Our love will never end. I've tried to come up. But it's drowning me to know. You'll never feel my soul. It's trapped between true love and being alone. When my eyes are closed. The greatest story told. I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor. Tell me baby. Why oh why. Tell me why not me. Why oh why. We were meant to be. Baby I know I could be all you need. Why oh why oh why. I wanna love you. If you only knew how much I love you. So why not me. You won't ever know. How far we can go. You won't ever know. How far we can go (go). Why oh why.

you're my #1,"I´ve kissed the moon a million times. danced with angels in the sky. I´ve seen snowfall in the summertime. Felt the healing of the powers above. I´ve seen the world from the highest mountain. Tasted love from the purest fountain. I´ve seen lips that spark desire. Felt the butterflies a hundred times. I`ve even seen miracles. I´ve felt the pain disappear. But still haven´t seen anything. That amazes me quite like you do. You bring me up when I´m feeling down. You touch me deep you touch me right. You do the things I´ve never done. You make me wicked you make me wild. Cause baby you´re my #1. I`ve sailed in a perfect dream. I`ve seen the sun make love to the sea. I`ve kissed the moon a million times. Danced with angels in the sky. I`ve even seen miracles. I`ve felt the pain disappear. But still haven`t seen anything. That amazes me quite like you do. You bring me up when I´m feeling down. You touch me deep you touch me right. You do the things I´ve never done. You make me wicked you make me wild. You bring me up... when I´m feeling down.
