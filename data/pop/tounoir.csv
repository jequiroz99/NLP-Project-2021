love strike,"Moving 'round the city when it happened. I came by you. Lamplights faded, my heart was restless. It was about time. Tell me, are you what I've been looking for?. Such a delight, though it stroke me so hard. Your freckles danced as you gave. A crooked smile. Pardon my look, I can't hide from my pain. Your sillouete was melting through. The pouring rain. A bittersweetness of this kind. No tasteless traces one could find. And all at once my senses couldn't just. Bare, but strike. The thought of you and I. But you walked away, not to be found. To endure through your glance, girl. I'll never know how. The nature of my state, not soon to be found. Your silence was by far the most painful sound. Tell me, are you what I've been looking for?.

And it's tearing me apart I can't let go, oh no. . I can barely count all the times I've fallen. Down the deepest hole. On my name, I'm crawling out. ""Take a drink or two, maybe this will hold it"". But the emptiness. Remains, I'm calling out. But I'm so obsessed with this. Way of going down. And I know it will always be. The same, I'm going down. Now, right past the hill, I see the shore. The strand of sand is not much more. Endearing than the raging sea"
