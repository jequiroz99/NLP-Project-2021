a horse with no name,"On the first part of the journey I was looking at all the life. There were plants and birds and rocks and things. There was sand and hills and rings. The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz. And the sky with no clouds. The heat was hot and the ground was dry. But the air was full of sound. I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. In the desert you can remember your name. 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. After two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red. After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed. And the story it told of a river that flowed. Made me sad to think it was dead. You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. In the desert you can remember your name. 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. After nine days I let the horse run free 'cause the desert had turned to sea. There were plants and birds and rocks and things. There was sand and hills and rings. The ocean is a desert with its life underground. And a perfect disguise above. Under the cities lies a heart made of ground. But the humans will give no love. You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. In the desert you can remember your name. 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain.

To relive time in his mind.. Oh Billy."

miss america,"Did someone give you something. To help you ease the pain?. Like the liquor in the bottle. We watched you slip away. And I feel as if I know you. Through the bars of a song. Always surrounded but alone. But no goodbyes. You'll always be Miss America. We watched you fly, but nothing's free Miss America. And as you fall apart, we just call it art. Was it so hard to breathe?. Was the picture in the paper not the face you recognise?. Did the make up never make up. For the pain behind your eyes?. Cos I feel as if I know you. When you're on my silver screen. But I don't know the dark places that you've been. But no goodbyes. You'll always be Miss America. We watched you fly, but nothing's free Miss America. And as you fall apart, we just call it art. Was it so hard to breathe?. Does another voice sing in heaven's choir tonight. To fill the silence left behind?. And I don't know what goes on in your mind. I'm sure it's enough to make me cry. Someday we'll find you lived forever. But no goodbyes. You'll always be Miss America. We watched you fly, but nothing's free Miss America. And as you fall apart, we just call it art. Was it so hard to breathe?"

a horse with no name,"On the first part of the journey I was looking at all the life. There were plants and birds and rocks and things. There was sand and hills and rings. The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz. And the sky with no clouds. The heat was hot and the ground was dry. But the air was full of sound. I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. In the desert you can remember your name. 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. After two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red. After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed. And the story it told of a river that flowed. Made me sad to think it was dead. You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. In the desert you can remember your name. 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. After nine days I let the horse run free 'cause the desert had turned to sea. There were plants and birds and rocks and things. There was sand and hills and rings. The ocean is a desert with its life underground. And a perfect disguise above. Under the cities lies a heart made of ground. But the humans will give no love. You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. In the desert you can remember your name. 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la"

You and I have lived through many things.. I'll hold on to your heart.. I wouldn't cry for anything,. But don't go tearing your life apart.. I have seen fear. I have seen faith.. Seen the look of anger on your face.. And if you want to talk about what will be,. Come and sit with me, and cry on my shoulder,. I'm a friend.. And if you want to talk about it anymore,.

Face the music. In your eyes you've made your bed. Read what the papers say. Your dancing days are over. The smile on your face will never hide your shame. You can't escape what they say. Your dancing days are over. The ghosts you see are shouting out your name. Oh how you danced. Oh how you sang. There's a feeling here that you began. Oh how you stood and stared. Held onto every breath. It seemed the world stood still. Transfixed by every step. Oh, let it go. Cos a lesser man would be your crowd. Captivation, lesser men will tear you down.

So, dear, dear Katie. What have you done lately?. I've heard it's all gone wrong.. So, dear, dear Katie. This mess you're in is crazy. Remember real love.. Take tea for two. An afternoon. By the sea. Remember how it used to be. When we were young and we didn't care. And oh people used to smile. We were holding hands in the park. The simple things men and woman share,. They used to make you smile.. Little girl don't be lonely,. You'll never be lonely. So dear, dear Katie. What have you done lately?. I've heard it's all gone wrong.. So dear, dear Katie. This mess you're in is crazy.. Remember real love.. And did he break your heart today. Well, do you still feel?"
dear self (can i talk to you),"[Chorus x2: James Blunt]. And I see no bravery. No bravery in your eyes anymore. Only sadness. Dear self, can I talk to you. I been trying to have this conversation for years. but you won't listen. Damn, are you that plain ignorant? your so indignant. Please come off that high chair your sitting in. Before you snatched from it, or strapped to it. Ya body used as a conduit, a thousand volts. flow through you. Ya life gone over something foolish. Talking to you is so useless. Ya head harder than them walls you'll be housed in soon. Before ya body's embalmed and you lie in tomb. Open ya ears, eyes and heart, cause that hour's soon. And the hour shall cometh, when Ish* Rahzel. blows his trumpets. The sky shall crack, the stars will plummet. The sun will rise in the West you'll drown in your own sweat. And when that day shall be, I'll bet I'll see no bravery. [Chorus]. And I see no bravery. No bravery in your eyes anymore. Only sadness. Dear self can I talk to you?. Dear self can I talk to you?. Who are you to lecture me?. You question me about my life and the choices I made?. How dare you to place me in an early grave? (whoa). Why you gotta talk to me in that fashion?. You bury me face down with an open casket. this whole world can kiss mine. Tell me what this life got to offer him. A crooked preacher and a church alter**?. A short speech and a long offering?. A deep grave and a short coffin?. Oh I get it... you Righteous now (haha). well let the truth be told. You done smoke every blunt I rolled. You done drove every car I stole. Cooked up every crack I sold. You done slept with every trick I laid. Collected off every bet I made... [laughs]. But I guess you done found Christ. I ain't know he was missin (Whoa). Watch your Blasphemy. Man I ain't asked to be. Just let me live my life. Now hold on - No you listen. You was there on every decision. Whether it was right or wrong. And now you trying to right my wrongs. You got some nerve. you even give me the words I write in this song. You see... my vision's much clearer. It's not me but it's you that I see when I look in the mirror. And you call yourself saving me?. But it's through your eyes that I see... No bravery"

Silent tears filled with pride. One day they'll know, she's got a heart of gold. And she sings:. I wanna know what love is. But it seems to come with so much pain. If no one wants to show me. It seems easier just to run away. When I am gone it's just a penny for my soul. But God, he knows, I got a heart of gold. Been coming 'round here. Since she's a little girl. But now the change is clear. We live in a cynical world. She don't care for fashion and fame. Those kind of people they are all the same. They don't wanna know, she's got a heart of gold.

To block the screaming late at night. She can't remember life before. Mama and Daddy went to war. All little girls are full of confusion. Cry all you want coz you're only human. Was all the love just an illusion?. Daddy's not coming home. Mama's asleep and she smells of whiskey. Promise that won't be you when you're 50. Cry before the guilty clap your wings. Coz all you're heroes. Are skin and bones. Packed the small bag of things she loves. Deep inside she blames herself. She has nowhere else to go. But that sounds better than what she knows. And as she steps into the dark. Dirty hair and heavy heart. Cold, cold air inside her lungs. Catch a snowflake on her tongue. All little girls are full of confusion. Cry all you want coz you're only human. Was all the love just an illusion?. Daddy's not coming home. Mama's asleep and she smells of whiskey. Promise that won't be you when you're 50. Cry before the guilty clap your wings. Coz all you're heroes. Are skin and bones. And as I heard you shut the door. Went through the window and I saw. The footsteps of my big sister in the snow. Since then not a single day has passed. Where I don't say your name and ask. Where, where did you go?. All little girls are full of confusion. Cry all you want coz you're only human. Was all the love just an illusion?. Daddy's not coming home. Mama's asleep and she smells of whiskey. Promise that won't be you when you're 50. Cry before the guilty clap your wings. Coz all you're heroes. Are skin and bones"

i can't hear the music,"Is it a warning?. Is it an evil sign?. Is it a people. who have lost their mind?. Is it the darkness?. Is it a man resigned?. Is it a best friend. leaving you behind?. Is it ever gonna stop?. Will they ever let you go?. You're in a rush, they don't care enough. 'cause their lives are very slow.. And when you sell your soul for a leading role,. will The Lost Souls be forgot?. And if I can't hear the music. And the audience is gone. I'll dance here on my own.. And I hope the lonely hearts club band. Will play out one last song. Before the sun goes down.. Is it envy? Should it really make you sick?. Is now the time that you realise you'd better get out quick?. 'Cause time is ticking on, too long to fake your smile,. But then you sold your soul for a leading role,. so wear it for a while.. And if I can't hear the music. And the audience is gone. I'll dance here on my own.. And I hope the lonely hearts club band. Will play out one last song. Before the sun goes down.. And there she goes.. And there she goes.. So won't you run, Yoshimi, run?. 'Cause Billy's got himself a gun,. And you're right to be afraid:. they'll send you to your grave. 'cause you're strange and new.. So won't you run, Yoshimi, run?. 'Cause Billy's got himself a gun,. And you're right to be afraid:. they'll send you to your grave. 'cause you're strange and new..

i guess that's why they call it the blues,"Don't wish it away. Don't look at it like it's forever. And between you and me I could honestly say. Things can only get better. And while I'm away. Dust out the demons inside. And it won't be long before you and me run. To the place in our hearts where we hide. And I guess that's why they call it the blues. Time on my hands could be time spent with you. Laughing like children, living like lovers. Rolling like thunder under the covers. And I guess that's why they call it the blues. Just stare into space. Picture my face in your hands. Wait on me girl. Cry in the night if it helps. But more than ever I simply love you. More than I love life itself. And I guess that's why they call it the blues. Time on my hands could be time spent with you. Laughing like children, living like lovers. Rolling like thunder under the covers. And I guess that's why they call it the blues"
i really want you,"I really want you, I really want you. Many prophets preach on bended knee.. Many clerics wasted wine.. Do the bloodied sheets on those cobbled streets mean. I have wasted time?. Are there silver shores of paradise?. Can I come in from the cold?. I killed a man in a faraway land,. My enemy I'm told.. I really want you to really want me,. But I really don't know if you can do that.. I know you want to know what's right,. But I know its so hard for you to do that.. And time's running out, as often it does,. and often dictates that you can't do that,. But fate can't break this feeling inside,. That's burning up through my veins.. I really want you, I really want you.. I really want you, now.. No matter what I say or do,. The message isn't getting through,. And you're listening to the sound,. Of my breaking heart.. I really want you, I really want you. Is a poor man rich in solitude,. Or does Mother Earth complain?. Did the beggar pray for a sunny day,. But lady luck for rain?. They say a million people bow and scrape,. To an effigy of gold.. I saw life begin in the ship we're in and,. History unfold.. I really want you to really want me,. But I really don't know if you can do that.. I know you want to know what's right,. But I know its so hard for you to do that.. And time's running out, as often it does,. and often dictates that you can't do that,. But fate can't break this feeling inside,. That's burning up through my veins.. I really want you, I really want you.. I really want you, now.. No matter what I say or do,. The message isn't getting through,. And you're listening to the sound,. Of my breaking heart..

into the dark,Love is madness that's quick to burn. And lying in the embers is where we are. And if my promise is unreturned. Before the day is over I will depart. If I could choose I'd have you stay. But I gave my heart to you and it's yours to break. Before my fears tear us apart. Won't you follow me into the dark. Love is blindness I cannot see. Underneath our roots are tangled and buried deep. When the leaves have fallen from the trees. Do we grow together entirely. If I could choose I'd have you stay. But I gave my heart to you and it's yours to break. Before my fears tear us apart. Won't you follow me into the dark. If I could choose I'd have you stay. But I gave my heart to you and it's yours to break. Before my fears tear us apart. Won't you follow me into the dark. Before my fears tear us apart. Won't you follow me into the dark

That we'd stay this way forever. The future seemed so very far away. Sometimes, when I. Think about those days it makes me wonder. What went by. Oh yeah, left me breathless. She was so damn wild. Sometimes I think those were the best days of our lives. (Ohh). We were young and reckless. Too soon, out of time. Next time I'm Seventeen. I won't be left behind. She would still be mine.

postcards,Sundays sitting on your back porch. And I came on with a couple of chords. And I played for you. You let me keep you entertained. With stories I exaggerate. That you know aren't true. And as you sit there. Making daisy chains. And I throw in a hand grenade. And tell you how it is I really feel for you. I'm sending postcards from my heart. Your love for a postmark and then. You know that you make me feel like. We've been caught like kids in the schoolyard again. And I can't keep it to myself. Can't spell it any better. L. O. V. E forever. I hope you know that. I'm sending a postcard. I don't care who sees what I've said. Or if the whole world knows what's in my head. We chased the sun til it got away. On a bicycle that your daddy made. But not made for two. Then we sat out on your rocking chair. You with a flower in your hair. That I found for you. But then Monday always comes around. And it's sad 'cause I can't see you now. Want you to know you're always in my head. I'm sending postcards from my heart. Your love for a postmark and then. You know that you make me feel like.

I don't care who sees what I've said. Or if the whole world knows what's in my head. You know sometimes its hard to see. You say the words that torture me. But inside I know exactly how I feel. The things that I can't say out loud. I'll find a place to write it down. I hope that they will find you in the end. I'm sending postcards from my heart. Your love for a postmark and then.

rocky racoon,"Rocky Racoon, he was a fool unto himself. For he would not swallow, his foolish pride. Mind you, coming from a little town in Minnesota,. It is not the kind of thing a young guy did. When a fellow went and stole his chick away from him.. Now, Rocky Raccoon checked into his room. Only to find Gideon's Bible. Rocky had come equipped with a gun. To shoot off the legs of his rival. His rival it seems had broken his dreams. By stealing the girl of his fancy.. Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil. But everyone knew her as Nancy.. Now she and her man who called himself Dan. Were in the next room at the hoe down. And Rocky burst in and grinning a grin. He said Danny Boy this is a showdown. But Daniel was hot, he drew fast and shot. And Rocky collapsed in the corner.. Da la la dum ba dum da da (3x). The doctor walked in stinking of gin. Proceeded to lie on the table. The doctor said ""Rock, you met your match, Son."". Rocky said, no it's only a scratch. I'll be better, Doc, I'll be better soon.. Well come on Rock, come on Rock.. Rocky Raccoon fell back in his room. Only to find Gideon's Bible. Gideon checked out and he left him no doubt. To hell with good Rocky's revival.. Da la la dum ba dum da da (6x)"

Or did the voodoo magic help?. Does everyone have a different take?. Do you seem real but I seem fake?. Does everyone get hypnotized by your fire?. So long, Jimmy, so long.. Though you only stayed a moment,. We all know that you're the one. Singing,. So long, Jimmy, so long.. Sure we're glad for the experience,. We miss you now you've gone.. We're just swimming in your soul 'cause,. We all wish we wrote this song.. Life goes on.. I'm just so relieved that it's over.. We were hanging out going nowhere,. Digging how the guitar goes,. In a song that no one knows.. Did you burn that bridge yourself,. Or did the voodoo magic help?. Does everyone have a different take?. Are you just cool and I'm just baked?. Does everyone get mesmerized by your fire?. So long, Jimmy, so long.. Though you only stayed a moment,. We all know that you're the one. Singing,. So long, Jimmy, so long..

someone singing along,Somebody's gonna wave a flag. Somebody's going to attack. Someone will tell you to take a side. Tell you their version of wrong or right. Somebody's gonna let you in.

Somebody's gonna build a wall. Then smash it with a cannon ball. Someone who somehow has got a gun. Will tell you who you can't and you can love. Some people keeping all the cash. They're gonna get away with that. Just 'cause some people don't think like me. Does that really make them the enemy?. And then you gotta find a way that you're walkin'. Everybody's walkin'.

sugar coated,"I’m on a bus. I’m in a rush.. I would catch a cab, but I’m not that fussed.. Another day. Another dime.. I know some might say, that I’m wasting time.. And then at night, another fight,. And I don’t know what it means but I’d never cause a scene.. I’m gonna make today sugar-coated.. I’m gonna get so high I’m lying here on the floor.. It’s time these shoes of mine were fully loaded.. It’s time to sit back and smile.. I’ve had a smoke and it’s been a while.. It’s been a while.. Hello dawn. It’s good to be.. Did I pay for the girl lying next to me?. I had a love, but little luck.. I don’t bleed any more 'cause my heart’s been crushed.. And now I’m free – lucky me.. Yeah my girlfriend was a bore, she don’t love me anymore.. I’m gonna make today sugar-coated.. I’m gonna get so high I’m lying here on the floor.. It’s time these shoes of mine were fully loaded.. It’s time to sit back and smile.. I’ve had a smoke and it’s been a while.. It’s been a while.. A little hush. A little rush.. I guess now we’ll see, if I’m big enough.. Finally it’s only me.. Things will never be the same. There’s no living life again.. I’m gonna make today sugar-coated.. I’m gonna get so high I’m lying here on the floor.. It’s time these shoes of mine were fully loaded.. It’s time to sit back and smile.. I’ve had a smoke and it's been a while.. It’s been a while."
sun on sunday,"A silent tear, an empty smile. So insincerely, but so gently in denial. And me the thief, so selfishly. All the moments meant for you, I made them mine. How was I so blind. To miss you crumbling inside?. Is it too late now to fix you?. Let me make it right!. 'Cause there'll be no sun on Sunday. No reason for words to rhyme. 'Cause if you're bleeding so am I. A wish for luck, a hesitate. You're hoping I will notice that you're not ok. And me the fool, you turn away. It's only then I feel the wake of my mistakes. How was I so blind.

superstar,There is an empty space in the chair tonight. Cause he don't feel right. There are stormclouds brewing at the back of his mind. As he steps outside. He will be twenty in a week. But he's old for his years. He's had many of those. To confront his own fears. But his father's not the man he'd like to grow up to be. And his mother isn't growing old gracefully. He says times like these I don't want to be a Superstar. Cause reality tv killed them all in america. Oh the sun always shines in a magazine. Tonight can we be free to be who we really are. There is an empty space between the lines tonight. And it burns so bright. And the angry silence that he throws on the floor. Says he don't care anymore. He had money for the truth. But love's a lot more. And the answer's is not the one he was looking for. His father's not the man he'd like to grow up to be. And his mother is his mother reluctantly. He says times like these I don't want to be a superstar. Cause reality tv killed them all in america. Oh the sun always shines in a magazine. Tonight can we be free to be who we really are. He says times like these I don't want to be a superstar. Cause reality tv killed them all in america. Oh the sun always shines in a magazine. Tonight can we be free to be who we really are
tears and rain,"How I wish I could surrender my soul;. Shed the clothes that become my skin;. See the liar that burns within my needing.. How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold..

Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.. I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.. It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain.. How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind;. Hold memory close at hand,. Help me understand the years.. How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell.. How I wish I would save my soul.. I'm so cold from fear.. I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,. All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.. Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray..

a horse with no name,"On the first part of the journey I was looking at all the life. There were plants and birds and rocks and things. There was sand and hills and rings. The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz. And the sky with no clouds. The heat was hot and the ground was dry. But the air was full of sound. I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. In the desert you can remember your name. 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. After two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red. After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed. And the story it told of a river that flowed. Made me sad to think it was dead. You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. In the desert you can remember your name. 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. After nine days I let the horse run free 'cause the desert had turned to sea. There were plants and birds and rocks and things. There was sand and hills and rings. The ocean is a desert with its life underground. And a perfect disguise above. Under the cities lies a heart made of ground. But the humans will give no love. You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. In the desert you can remember your name. 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain.

When you say that you're in love with me. Won't you breathe for me. I am tired of my own. Race me to the horror at the end. I've lost myself again. In the mirror of my past. Let me, let me scratch at my own skin. I'm dying to get in. To the mirror of my past. I just take what someone wants. Race when I'm in front. Break what I don't need. It's nice to watch somebody breathe. Well now come sit next to me. I'm not sleeping with a bride to be. Been wasting time like it just doesn't matter very much. So I'm happy for the company.

Always surrounded but alone. But no goodbyes. You'll always be Miss America. We watched you fly, but nothing's free Miss America. And as you fall apart, we just call it art. Was it so hard to breathe?. Was the picture in the paper not the face you recognise?. Did the make up never make up. For the pain behind your eyes?. Cos I feel as if I know you. When you're on my silver screen. But I don't know the dark places that you've been. But no goodbyes. You'll always be Miss America. We watched you fly, but nothing's free Miss America. And as you fall apart, we just call it art. Was it so hard to breathe?. Does another voice sing in heaven's choir tonight. To fill the silence left behind?. And I don't know what goes on in your mind. I'm sure it's enough to make me cry. Someday we'll find you lived forever. But no goodbyes. You'll always be Miss America. We watched you fly, but nothing's free Miss America. And as you fall apart, we just call it art. Was it so hard to breathe?"

And I know, you better let somebody love you. or find yourself, on your own. (Chorus:). Tell me why all the best laid plans. fall apart in your hands. And my good intentions never end,. the way I meant. If we don't talk about the future. Then should I just, follow you into the dark. Yeah, and does your silence keep you cold. While the cracks form on my heart. (Chorus 1x). It seems to me some fine friends have watched you turn your back. It seems you only want the things that you can't have.. (Chorus 2x)"
billy,"Billy's leaving today (don't know where he's going).. Holds his head in disgrace (he can't escape the truth).. He knows the price that he's paid.. He admits that it's too late to admit that he's afraid.. Tomorrow comes. Sorrow becomes his soul mate.. The damage is done. The prodigal son is too late.. Old doors are closed but he's always open,. To relive time in his mind.. Oh Billy.. Billy's leaving today (don't know where he's going).. He's got lines on his face (they tell the story of his pain).. He accepts it's his fate.. He admits it took too long to admit that he was wrong.. Tomorrow comes. Sorrow becomes his soul mate.. The damage is done. The prodigal son is too late.. Old doors are closed but he's always open,. To relive time in his mind.. Oh Billy.. Once he was a lover sleeping with another.. Now he's just known as a cheat.. And he wish he'd had a mirror; looked a little clearer.. Seen into the eyes of the weak.. Tomorrow comes. Sorrow becomes his soul mate.. The damage is done. The prodigal son is too late.. Old doors are closed but he's always open,. To relive time in his mind.. Oh Billy."

dear self (can i talk to you),"[Chorus x2: James Blunt]. And I see no bravery. No bravery in your eyes anymore. Only sadness. Dear self, can I talk to you. I been trying to have this conversation for years. but you won't listen. Damn, are you that plain ignorant? your so indignant. Please come off that high chair your sitting in. Before you snatched from it, or strapped to it. Ya body used as a conduit, a thousand volts. flow through you. Ya life gone over something foolish. Talking to you is so useless. Ya head harder than them walls you'll be housed in soon. Before ya body's embalmed and you lie in tomb. Open ya ears, eyes and heart, cause that hour's soon. And the hour shall cometh, when Ish* Rahzel. blows his trumpets. The sky shall crack, the stars will plummet. The sun will rise in the West you'll drown in your own sweat. And when that day shall be, I'll bet I'll see no bravery. [Chorus]. And I see no bravery. No bravery in your eyes anymore. Only sadness. Dear self can I talk to you?. Dear self can I talk to you?. Who are you to lecture me?. You question me about my life and the choices I made?. How dare you to place me in an early grave? (whoa). Why you gotta talk to me in that fashion?. You bury me face down with an open casket. this whole world can kiss mine. Tell me what this life got to offer him. A crooked preacher and a church alter**?. A short speech and a long offering?. A deep grave and a short coffin?. Oh I get it... you Righteous now (haha). well let the truth be told. You done smoke every blunt I rolled. You done drove every car I stole. Cooked up every crack I sold. You done slept with every trick I laid. Collected off every bet I made... [laughs]. But I guess you done found Christ. I ain't know he was missin (Whoa). Watch your Blasphemy. Man I ain't asked to be. Just let me live my life. Now hold on - No you listen. You was there on every decision. Whether it was right or wrong. And now you trying to right my wrongs. You got some nerve. you even give me the words I write in this song. You see... my vision's much clearer. It's not me but it's you that I see when I look in the mirror. And you call yourself saving me?. But it's through your eyes that I see... No bravery"

heart of gold,"This time, her mind is made up. Yeah, she's moving on. Tonight her spirit's crushed. It's just she don't belong. Maybe she thinks too much. She thinks she's given enough. God only know, she's got a heart of gold. Always looking for love. But she's beginning to think she's cursed. On her looks she's judged. By the folks at work. All alone at night she's cried. Silent tears filled with pride. One day they'll know, she's got a heart of gold. And she sings:. I wanna know what love is. But it seems to come with so much pain. If no one wants to show me. It seems easier just to run away. When I am gone it's just a penny for my soul. But God, he knows, I got a heart of gold. Been coming 'round here. Since she's a little girl. But now the change is clear. We live in a cynical world. She don't care for fashion and fame. Those kind of people they are all the same. They don't wanna know, she's got a heart of gold.

heroes,"You can see it on her face. Her red eyes say she's not safe. How should she know what it means. She is only just a teen. Under her duvet's where she hides. To block the screaming late at night. She can't remember life before. Mama and Daddy went to war. All little girls are full of confusion. Cry all you want coz you're only human. Was all the love just an illusion?. Daddy's not coming home. Mama's asleep and she smells of whiskey. Promise that won't be you when you're 50. Cry before the guilty clap your wings. Coz all you're heroes. Are skin and bones. Packed the small bag of things she loves. Deep inside she blames herself. She has nowhere else to go. But that sounds better than what she knows. And as she steps into the dark. Dirty hair and heavy heart. Cold, cold air inside her lungs. Catch a snowflake on her tongue. All little girls are full of confusion. Cry all you want coz you're only human. Was all the love just an illusion?. Daddy's not coming home. Mama's asleep and she smells of whiskey. Promise that won't be you when you're 50. Cry before the guilty clap your wings. Coz all you're heroes. Are skin and bones. And as I heard you shut the door. Went through the window and I saw. The footsteps of my big sister in the snow. Since then not a single day has passed. Where I don't say your name and ask. Where, where did you go?. All little girls are full of confusion. Cry all you want coz you're only human. Was all the love just an illusion?. Daddy's not coming home. Mama's asleep and she smells of whiskey. Promise that won't be you when you're 50. Cry before the guilty clap your wings. Coz all you're heroes. Are skin and bones"

Your attitude is really rough.. Stop getting high on all this shit,. You can't hide in the corner to escape,. from it.. From it."
it's not easy to be me,"I can't stand to fly. I'm not that naive. I'm just out to find. The better part of me. I'm more than a bird... I'm more than a plane. More than some pretty face beside a train. It's not easy to be me. Wish that I could cry. Fall upon my knees. Find a way to lie. About a home I'll never see. It may sound absurd... but don't be naive. Even heroes have the right to bleed. I maybe disturbed... but won't you concede. Even heroes have the right to dream. It's not easy to be me. Up, up and away... away from me. It's all right... you can all sleep sound tonight. I'm not crazy... or anything.... I can't stand to fly. I'm not that naive. Men weren't meant to ride. With clouds between their knees. I'm only a man in a silly red sheet. Digging for kryptonite on this one way street. Only a man in a funny red sheet. Looking for special things inside of me. It's not easy to be me"

make me better,"You made me breakfast every morning. You made me sleep all through the night. You made me worry without any warning. Let me just lie here, drown in your eyes, dear. You made me sorry this wasn't always. You made me hungry for your body, babe. You made me run down hospital hallways. You gave me life, dear, and he's got your eyes. I waited so long. Baby, I did you wrongs. Make up for the time we've wasted. You would wait by the phone. Every time I was gone. But all along. You are everything. I have never been. I want you to make me better. And I've been wondering. Why you let me in. I want you to make me better. You made me stop and savor the moment. You made me laugh out loud, you do. You give me memories like time is frozen. You gave me a child and he's got your smile. And I sang a song. Every night I was gone. About all the dreams I'm chasing. And I have been wrong. With the things that I've done. 'Cause all along. You are everything. I have never been. I want you to make me better. And I've been wondering. Why you let me in. I want you to make me better. Although that I've never read your mind.

miss america,"Did someone give you something. To help you ease the pain?. Like the liquor in the bottle. We watched you slip away. And I feel as if I know you. Through the bars of a song. Always surrounded but alone. But no goodbyes. You'll always be Miss America. We watched you fly, but nothing's free Miss America. And as you fall apart, we just call it art. Was it so hard to breathe?. Was the picture in the paper not the face you recognise?. Did the make up never make up. For the pain behind your eyes?. Cos I feel as if I know you. When you're on my silver screen. But I don't know the dark places that you've been. But no goodbyes. You'll always be Miss America. We watched you fly, but nothing's free Miss America. And as you fall apart, we just call it art. Was it so hard to breathe?. Does another voice sing in heaven's choir tonight. To fill the silence left behind?. And I don't know what goes on in your mind. I'm sure it's enough to make me cry. Someday we'll find you lived forever. But no goodbyes. You'll always be Miss America. We watched you fly, but nothing's free Miss America. And as you fall apart, we just call it art. Was it so hard to breathe?"

Too soon, out of time. Next time I'm Seventeen. I won't be left behind. She would still be mine. She would still be mine. While the Iron Curtain fell. We were lying in a field. Shared the gin and cigarettes I'd stolen from my dad. We both knew what would happen next. In my cherry red AX. Did she know she was the best I'd ever had. Said we'd always be together. That we'd stay this way forever. The future seemed so very far away. Sometimes, when I. Think about those days it makes me wonder. What went by. Oh yeah, left me breathless. She was so damn wild.

Sure we're glad for the experience,. We miss you now you've gone.. We're just swimming in your soul 'cause,. We all wish we wrote this song.. Life goes on."
someone singing along,Somebody's gonna wave a flag. Somebody's going to attack. Someone will tell you to take a side. Tell you their version of wrong or right. Somebody's gonna let you in. Judged on the color of your skin. Slam a door in the face of your friend. Simply because you don't look like him. And then you gotta find a way that you're walkin'. Everybody's walkin'. You gotta find the words to say when you're talkin'. Everybody's talkin'. So I built the words into a song. I'm hopin' someone's singing along. And even if some notes are wrong. I'm hopin' someone's singing along. 'Cause just one voice is not enough. I need to hear from everyone. And even when I'm dead and gone. I'm hopin' someone's singing along. Somebody's gonna build a wall. Then smash it with a cannon ball. Someone who somehow has got a gun. Will tell you who you can't and you can love. Some people keeping all the cash. They're gonna get away with that. Just 'cause some people don't think like me. Does that really make them the enemy?. And then you gotta find a way that you're walkin'. Everybody's walkin'. You gotta find the words to say when you're talkin'. Everybody's talkin'. So I built the words into a song. I'm hopin' someone's singing along. And even if some notes are wrong. I'm hopin' someone's singing along. 'Cause just one voice is not enough. I need to hear from everyone. And even when I'm dead and gone. I'm hopin' someone's singing along. Make a noise. I can hear you now. Won't you raise your voice. Just a little louder. Make a noise. I can hear you now. Won't you raise your voice. Just a little louder. So I built the words into a song. I'm hopin' someone's singing along. And even if some notes are wrong. I'm hopin' someone's singing along. 'Cause just one voice is not enough. I need to hear from everyone. And even when I'm dead and gone. I'm hopin' someone's singing along

sugar coated,"I’m on a bus. I’m in a rush.. I would catch a cab, but I’m not that fussed.. Another day. Another dime.. I know some might say, that I’m wasting time.. And then at night, another fight,. And I don’t know what it means but I’d never cause a scene.. I’m gonna make today sugar-coated.. I’m gonna get so high I’m lying here on the floor.. It’s time these shoes of mine were fully loaded.. It’s time to sit back and smile.. I’ve had a smoke and it’s been a while.. It’s been a while.. Hello dawn. It’s good to be.. Did I pay for the girl lying next to me?. I had a love, but little luck.. I don’t bleed any more 'cause my heart’s been crushed.. And now I’m free – lucky me.. Yeah my girlfriend was a bore, she don’t love me anymore.. I’m gonna make today sugar-coated.. I’m gonna get so high I’m lying here on the floor.. It’s time these shoes of mine were fully loaded.. It’s time to sit back and smile.. I’ve had a smoke and it’s been a while.. It’s been a while.. A little hush. A little rush.. I guess now we’ll see, if I’m big enough.. Finally it’s only me.. Things will never be the same. There’s no living life again.. I’m gonna make today sugar-coated.. I’m gonna get so high I’m lying here on the floor.. It’s time these shoes of mine were fully loaded.. It’s time to sit back and smile.. I’ve had a smoke and it's been a while.. It’s been a while."
sun on sunday,"A silent tear, an empty smile. So insincerely, but so gently in denial. And me the thief, so selfishly. All the moments meant for you, I made them mine. How was I so blind. To miss you crumbling inside?. Is it too late now to fix you?. Let me make it right!. 'Cause there'll be no sun on Sunday. No reason for words to rhyme. 'Cause if you're bleeding so am I. A wish for luck, a hesitate. You're hoping I will notice that you're not ok. And me the fool, you turn away. It's only then I feel the wake of my mistakes. How was I so blind. To miss you crumbling inside?. Is it too late now to fix you?. Let me make it right. 'Cause there'll be no sun on Sunday. No reason for words to rhyme. 'Cause if you're bleeding so am I. And if I cut you, if I bruise you. The scars are always mine. 'Cause I love you so to lose you. Would be worse than if I died. How was I so blind. To miss you crumbling inside?. Is it too late now to fix you?. Let me make it right. 'Cause there'll be no sun on Sunday. No reason for words to rhyme. 'Cause if you're bleeding so am I"
superstar,There is an empty space in the chair tonight. Cause he don't feel right. There are stormclouds brewing at the back of his mind. As he steps outside. He will be twenty in a week. But he's old for his years. He's had many of those. To confront his own fears. But his father's not the man he'd like to grow up to be. And his mother isn't growing old gracefully. He says times like these I don't want to be a Superstar. Cause reality tv killed them all in america. Oh the sun always shines in a magazine. Tonight can we be free to be who we really are. There is an empty space between the lines tonight. And it burns so bright. And the angry silence that he throws on the floor. Says he don't care anymore. He had money for the truth. But love's a lot more. And the answer's is not the one he was looking for. His father's not the man he'd like to grow up to be. And his mother is his mother reluctantly. He says times like these I don't want to be a superstar. Cause reality tv killed them all in america. Oh the sun always shines in a magazine. Tonight can we be free to be who we really are. He says times like these I don't want to be a superstar. Cause reality tv killed them all in america. Oh the sun always shines in a magazine. Tonight can we be free to be who we really are
tears and rain,"How I wish I could surrender my soul;. Shed the clothes that become my skin;. See the liar that burns within my needing.. How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold.. How I wish I had screamed out loud,. Instead I've found no meaning.. I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,. All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.. Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.. I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.. It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain.. How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind;. Hold memory close at hand,. Help me understand the years.. How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell.. How I wish I would save my soul.. I'm so cold from fear.. I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,. All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.. Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.. I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.. Far, far away; find comfort in pain.. All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble..

'Cause I'll never be with you. La la la la la la la la la. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. You're beautiful, it's true. There must be an angel with a smile on her face. When she thought up that I should be with you. But it's time to face the truth. I will never be with you"
young folks,If I told you things I did before. Told you how I used to be. Would you go along with someone like me. If you knew my story word for word. Had all of my history. Would you go along with someone like me. I did before and had my share. It didn't lead nowhere. I would go along with someone like you. It doesn't matter what you did. Who you were hanging with. We could stick around and see this night through. And we don't care about the young folks. Talkin' 'bout the young style. And we don't care about the old folks. Talkin' 'bout the old style too. And we don't care about their own faults. Talkin' 'bout our own style. All we care 'bout is talking. Talking only me and you. Usually when things has gone this far. People tend to disappear. No one will surprise me unless you do. I can tell there's something goin' on. Hours seems to disappear. Everyone is leaving I'm still with you. It doesn't matter what we do. Where we are going too. We can stick around and see this night through. And we don't care about the young folks. Talkin' 'bout the young style. And we don't care about the old folks. Talkin' 'bout the old style too. And we don't care about their own faults. Talkin' 'bout our own style. All we care 'bout is talking. Talking only me and you. And we don't care about the young folks. Talkin' 'bout the young style. And we don't care about the old folks. Talkin' 'bout the old style too. And we don't care about their own faults. Talkin' 'bout our own style. All we care 'bout is talking. Talking only me and you. Talking only me and you. Talking only me and you. Talking only me and you
