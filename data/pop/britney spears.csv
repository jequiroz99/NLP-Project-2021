You ain't gotta be scared. We're grown now. I'm a hit defrost on ya. Let's get it blazin'. We can turn the heat up if you wanna. Turn the lights down low if you wanna. Just wanna move you. But you're froze up. That's what I'm saying. Let me break the ice. Allow me to get you right. Won't you warm up to me. Baby I can make you feel. Let me break the ice. Allow me to get you right. Won't you warm up to me. Baby I can make you feel. I like this part. It just hit me who I got with me. She's from a different world like Whitney. But she's Britney and I'm low so. That's just the case you ain't know so. We spoke twice, HIT BROKE ICE. It's not just a game, its Titanic. It goes down the same as Titanic. You and me, baby why panic?. Now, how cool am I?. Must've went to school at CUTEY High. CALVIN could've been a cooler guy. Cause I, I. Let me break the ice (the ice). Allow me to get you right (yes). Won't you warm up to me (thats the way I feel baby). Baby I can make you feel (BREAK THE ICE). Let me break the ice. Allow me to get you right (it's Britney Spears). Won't you warm up to me. Baby I can make you feel. Hot. Low so, in case you ain't know so. Got ice on the neck too. Can't break this though. Let me break the ice. Allow me to get you right. Won't you warm up to me. Baby I can make you feel. Let me break the ice. Allow me to get you right. Won't you warm up to me. Baby I can make you feel"
breathe on me,"It's so hot in here.... Oh, it's so hot and I need some air. And, boy, don't stop 'cause I'm half way there. It's not complicated, we're just syncopated. We can read each other's minds. One love united, two bodies synchronizing. Don't even need to touch me, baby just.... Breathe on me. Yeah oh baby, just. Breathe on me. We don't need to touch, just breathe. Oh, this is way beyond the physical. Tonight, my senses don't make sense at all. Our imagination takin' us to places. We have never been before. Take me in, let it out. Don't even need to touch me, baby just. Breathe on me. Yeah oh baby, just. Breathe on me. We don't need to touch, just. Breathe on me. Oh baby, just. Breathe on me. We don't need to touch, just breathe. Monogamy is the way to go. Just put your lips together. And blow. Breathe on me. Baby, just. Breathe on me. We don't need to touch, just. Breathe on me. Oh baby, just. Breathe on me. We don't need to touch, just"

As I march through the valley of the shadow of death. Dark hair on my chest. Wife on my left. Let's go. And they say. I'm crazy. For loving you. For feeling you. And maybe. I'm a little crazy. But they don't know. All the things you do. That's how I'ma ride. For my family I'd die. Bet you're all thinking. I'm that guy. Don't care about you. 'Cause I'm the truth. I ball like Kobe. Shooting hoops. Up in the roof. Been the million dollar corporation. Call me maloof. Like I said once before. I'm the truth. Hollywood can't catch me. But they got you. Nothing fake round here. I'm the realest do. Haters feel us too. I'm in and out the groove. Every word out my mouth. Make headline news. I'm the best, I rule. Come test my tools. You do so square. Get my slang out manuals, ha. And they say. I'm crazy. For loving you. For feeling you. And maybe. I'm a little crazy. But they don't know. All the things you do. And they say I'm a little crazy. But they don't even know you, baby. So they base all their the accusations. On what they really don't know. So tired of all the speculation. Fed up of negative fabrications. You say just have a little patience. But they are driving me crazy. Never been a surfer. But my chang hang loose. Got so much flavour. Like 2pac juice. Got dudes wishing you're in my shoes. I'm a rockstar baby. I do what I wanna do. Tough pack. My crew will come and clobber you. Let the pope come out. And watch it swallow you. Not a pretty boy. But I look like a model do. Not a gangster. But in my life, yeah I've fought a few. Hit the hustle tight now it look. Like I'm robbing you. All yours flys. Watch how I swatted you. Better think twice how you come at me. I'm a godfather now. I'm about my family, yeah. And they say. I'm crazy. For loving you. For feeling you. And maybe. I'm a little crazy. But they don't know. All the things you do"

i don't care (live at star search),"They say I'm crazy. Got no sense. But I don't care. They may or may not mean offense. But I don't care. You see, I'm sort of independent. I am my own superintendent. And my star is on the ascendent. That's why I don't care. I don't care, I don't care. What they may think of me. I'm happy-go-lucky, they say that I'm plucky. Contented and carefree. I don't care I don't care. If I do get a mean and stony stare. If I'm not successful. It won't be distressful. Cause I don't care. A girl should know her etiquette. Alas, alack. Propriety demands we walk a narrow track. When fellas used to blink at me. I'd freeze 'em and they'd shrink at me. But now when fellas wink at me. I wink at them right back!. I don't care I don't care. If people frown on me. Perhaps it's the lone way. But I go my own way. That's my philosophy. I don't care I don't care. if he's clerk or just a millionaire. There's no doubt about it. I'll sing and I'll shout it. Cause I don't care. Oh, I don't care, I don't care. When it comes to happiness. I want my share. Don't try to rearrange me. There's nothing can change me. 'cause I don't care!"

Pushed me far from you. In your life. And now I know the tears won't lead to loneliness. Baby when time goes by. I'll understand. Let's pretend that I moved on.

open arms (journey live cover),Lying beside you. Here in the dark. Feeling your heartbeat. With mine. Softly you whisper. You're so sincere. How could our love. Be so blind. We sailed on together. We drifted apart. And here you are by my side. (Chorus). So now I come to you. With open arms. Nothing to hide. Believe what I say. So here I am. With open arms. Hoping you'll see. What your love means to me. Open arms. Living without you. Living alone. This empty house seems so cold. Wanting to hold you. Wanting you near. How much I wanted you home. But now that you've come back. Turned night into day. I need you to stay. (Chorus)

Maybe I can live without. When I'm out from under. I don't wanna feel the pain. What good would it do me now. I'll get it all figured out. When I'm out from under. So let me go. Just let me fly away. Let me feel the space between us growing deeper. And much darker every day. Watch me now and I'll be someone new. My heart will be unbroken. It will open up for everyone but you. Even when I cross the line. It's like a lie I've told a thousand times. [Chorus]. I don't wanna dream about. All the things that never were. Maybe I can live without. When I'm out from under. I don't wanna feel the pain. What good would it do me now. I'll get it all figured out. When I'm out from under. And part of me still believes. When you say you're gonna stick around. And part of me still believes. We can find a way to work it out. But I know that we tried everything we could try. So let's just say goodbye. Forever. [Chorus][2x]. I don't wanna dream about.

"to love, let go","It's written everywhere I've even read it in my script. But when I thought it wasn't fair I felt it on my lips, let go. I don't want to be the one you think you already know, oh.... The feeling of going down way to deep. And holding on so you won't lose your feet. Sometimes you just gotta trust you gotta take that leap and let go. Gotta let go.... I've got a feeling, by your look you're through, oh no. But your revealing I sit and pray and I will pull through. When you let go of all you've known. The butterflies fly and you will see the rainbows. And all the love, everything will be shown, so let go, let go. The touch of grass, the air, the sun it wiill rise. You will see so clear, it will bring tears to your eyes. Baby, everything will be alright, just let go, you gotta let go. I've got a feeling, by your look you're through, oh no. This little song might be the one that will tell us what to do. These tears are overflowing and never knowing why. All these years we've, we've been hurting. We have to looke inside and try, to let go. You gotta let go. To love, you gotta let go. If you really wanna love. You gotta let go"
tom's diner,"I am sitting in the morning. At the diner on the corner. I am waiting at the counter. For the man to pour the coffee. And he fills it only halfway. And before I even argue. He is looking out the window. At somebody coming in. ""It is always nice to see you"". Says the man behind the counter. To the woman who has come in. She is shaking her umbrella. And I look the other way. As they are kissing their hellos. I'm pretending not to see them. Instead I pour the milk. Everybody's welcome, come on. Come on in. Sit yourself down. The fun does never end. Love is the blood that makes you wanna drink. 'Til the morning after. I open up the paper. There's a story of an actor. Who had died while he was drinking. It was no one I had heard of. And I'm turning to the horoscope. And looking for the funnies. When I'm feeling someone watching me. And so I raise my head"
touch of my hand,"I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream. I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene. Into the unknown, I will be bold. I'm going to places I can be out of control. And I don't want to explain tonight. All the things I'm tried to hide. I shut myself out from the world so I. Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly. I love myself it's not a sin. I can't control what's happening. CHORUS:. 'Cause I just discovered. Imagination's taking over. Another day without a lover. The more I come to understand. The touch of my hand. . The small of my back and the arch of my feet. Lately I've been noticing the beautiful me. I'm all in my skin and I'm not gonna wait. I'm into myself in the most precious way. And I don't want to explain tonight. All the things I'm tried to hide. I shut myself out from the world so I. Can draw the blinds then I'll teach myself to fly. CHORUS:. 'Cause I just discovered. Imagination's taking over. Another day without a lover. The more I come to understand. The touch of my hand. There's a world undefined. In my body and mind. I won't be left behind. I'm already here.
