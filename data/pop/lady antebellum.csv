need you now,"Picture perfect memories,. Scattered all around the floor. Reaching for the phone 'cause,. I can't fight it anymore. And I wonder if I ever cross your mind. For me it happens all the time. It's a quarter after one,. I'm all alone and I need you now. Said I wouldn't call. but I lost all control and I need you now. And I don't know how I can do without,. I just need you now. Another shot of whiskey,. can't stop looking at the door. Wishing you'd come sweeping. in the way you did before. And I wonder if I ever cross your mind. For me it happens all the time. It's a quarter after one,. I'm a little drunk,. And I need you now. Said I wouldn't call. but I lost all control and I need you now. And I don't know how I can do without,. I just need you now. oh ohhh.... Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all. It's a quarter after one,. I'm all alone and I need you now. And I said I wouldn't call. but I'm a little drunk and I need you now. And I don't know how I can do without,. I just need you now. I just need you now. Oh baby I need you now..."
just a kiss,"Lyin' here with you so close to me. It's hard to fight these feelings. When it feels so hard to breathe. I'm caught up in this moment. Caught up in your smile. I've never opened up to anyone. So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms. We don't need to rush this. Let's just take it slow. Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight. Just a touch in the fire burning so bright. And I don't want to mess this thing up. I don't want to push too far. Just a shot in the dark that you just might. Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life. So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight. I know that if we give this a little time. It will only bring us closer to the love we wanna find. It's never felt so real. No, it's never felt so right. Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight. Just a touch in the fire burning so bright. And I don't want to mess this thing up. I don't wanna push too far. Just a shot in the dark that you just might. Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life. So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight. No I don't wanna say goodnight. I know it's time to leave. But you'll be in my dreams. Tonight. Tonight. Tonight. Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight. Just a touch in the fire burning so bright. And I don't want to mess this thing up. I don't wanna push too far. Just a shot in the dark that you just might.

wanted you more,"I kept waiting on a reason. And a call that never came. No, I never saw it coming. Something in you must have changed. All the words unspoken, promises broken. I cried for so long. Wasted too much time, should've seen the signs. Now I know just what went wrong. I guess I wanted you more. And looking back now, I'm sure. I wanted you more. I guess I wanted you more. All the nights we spent, just talking. Of the things we wanted out of life. Making plans and dreams together. Wish I'd seen, I was just too blind. My heart was open, exposed and hoping. For you to lay it on the line. In the end it seemed. There was no room for me. Still, I tried to change your mind. I guess I wanted you more. And looking back now, I'm sure. I wanted you more. I guess I wanted you more. Oh, I don't need you. I don't need you anymore. I guess I wanted you more. And looking back now, I'm sure. I wanted you more. I guess I wanted you more. I don't need you. I don't need you anymore"

You're the promise of forever. The place where I belong. You feel like home. Day by day and brick by brick we're building. Something real and something strong. Oh, round the road and round again.

somebody else's heart,"[Charles:]. You think I'd be more resistant. To put myself in this position. Yeah, we always go there. Down a road that leads nowhere. Somewhere between lovers and just friends. [Hillary (Charles) :]. Saw you parked outside the party. I knew you'd be by the bar. I wish there was a heart (I could borrow just 'til tomorrow). Cause this is always how it starts. [Both:]. So tonight, gonna kiss you with my lips. Gonna hold you in my arms. Throw shadows in the dark. I'll let you in against my better judgement.

heart break,"I paint my lips red, I turn my own head. Don't need nobody's help, zipping up my own dress. Pay my own tab, with my own cash, unattached. Sometimes the world alone, sounds like a sad song. Why's it gotta be, cause what I really need is a reset. And a deep breath, yeah. I think it's time to take a heart break, out late. Solo on a saturday night. Going out without a plus one, I'm done. Falling over pickup lines. I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound. One lover to another, or be tied down. I'm sleeping like a queen. In a California king I made (I made, I made). I think it's time to take a heart break. I think it's time to take a heart break. It's just a little phase, give me a little space. You might see through it, but I'm putting on a poker face. Give a love a rest, between my ex, and my next. I think it's time to take a heart break, out late. Solo on a saturday night. Going out without a plus one, I'm done. Falling over pickup lines. I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound. One lover to another, or be tied down. 'Til im sleeping like a queen. In a California king I made (I made, I made). I think it's time to take a heart break. I think it's time to take a heart break. Love, I'm over you (love, I'm over you). It's long overdue. I think it's time to take a heart break. (I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound). I think it's time to take a heart break. I think it's time to take a heart break, out late. Solo on a saturday night. Going out without a plus one, I'm done. Falling over pickup lines. I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound. One lover to another, or be tied down. 'Til Im sleeping like a queen. In a California king I made (I made, I made). I think it's time to take a heart break. I think it's time to take a heart break"
i did with you,"I remember thinking 'bout forever. Sitting there with you by the river. We danced in the headlights. And fell for the first time. I remember telling you I loved you. The Northern Star rising above you. And in the moment I thought every dream. Would come true. Oh, but some just never do. Love comes in circles. And love takes it's own time. Bending and breaking, not taking a straight line. Never knew another love timeless and true. Oh, but I did, yeah I did with you. Oh, I did, I did with you. Through the years I just kept on believing. There had to be a plan or a reason. But heaven was silent and life just kept moving along. 'Till my heart knew the moment was gone. Love comes in circles. And love takes it's own time. Bending and breaking, not taking a straight line. Never knew another love timeless and true. Oh, but I did, yeah I did with you. Love is the reason why. Miracles never die. They just live on and on. Like a song, like a song. In the hearts of ones you leave behind. Ooh, yeah. Love comes in circles. And love takes it's own time. Bending and breaking, not taking a straight line. Never knew another love timeless and true. Oh, but I did, yeah I did with you. Oh, I did, yeah, I did with you"
dancin' away with my heart,I finally asked you to dance. On the last slow song. And beneath the moon that was really a disco ball. I can still feel my head on your shoulder. Hoping that song would never be over. I haven't seen you in ages. Sometimes I find myself. Wondering where you are. For me you'll always be 18. And beautiful and dancing away with my heart. I brushed your curls back so I could see your eyes. And the way you moved me. Was like you were in my mind. I can still feel you lean in to kiss me. I can't help but wonder if you ever miss me. I haven't seen you in ages. Sometimes I find myself. Wondering where you are. For me you'll always be 18. And beautiful and dancing away with my heart. Oh you headed out to college. At the end of that summer when we lost touch. I guess I didn't realize even at that moment we lost so much. I haven't seen you in ages. Sometimes I find myself. Wondering where you are. For me you'll always be 18. And beautiful and dancing away with my heart. Na na na na. Na na na na. Na na na na. Away with my heart. Na na na na. Na na na na. Na na na na
think about you,"It was mid july, summer rain. We drove past the texaco. With an empty tank and no loose change. You swore we'd make it home. It's a little fuzzy 'cause. I was caught up in your eyes. Your touch. The rush. When you showed up late on new year's eve. And you tried to hold my hand. You told me that you'd met someone. And I said I understand. It's hard not to fall apart. With a midnight broken heart. So I cried. But that was the last time. 'cause I don't think about you and me. What we used to be. Every memory anymore. Forgot about what we went through. 'cause I'm bulletproof. Oh, I bet you think I do. No, I don't think about you, you, you. The place where I first saw your face. And you bought me a drink. And when we talked 'til 2am. About every single dream. Well now it's just a bar. And a beat up parking lot. I see. Yeah, that's all it is to me. 'cause I don't think about you and me. What we used to be. Every memory anymore. Forgot about what we went through. 'cause I'm bulletproof. Oh, I bet you think I do. No, I don't think about you, you, you. No, I don't think about you. Well maybe only when I'm lonely. When I'm drinking. But I see you I'm always gonna play it cool. 'cause I don't think about you and me. What we used to be. Every memory anymore. 'cause I don't think about you and me. What we used to be. Every memory anymore. Forgot about what we went through. My heart is bulletproof. Oh, I bet you think I do. No, I don't think about you, you, you.

i run to you,I run from hate. I run from prejudice. I run from pessimists. But I run too late. I run my life. Or is it running me. Run from my past. I run too fast. Or too slow it seems.

when you were mine,"Words spoking my heart open. No i never had butterflies like that. We danced in the moon glow your hands move so. You kissed me on the lips swore i wouldn't look back. It was just like we were flying in another time. I felt the world was ours for the taken. When i feel into your eyes. Never a doubt that we would make it if we try. You promised you never break my heart, never leave me in the dark, said your love would be for all time. But that was back when you were mine, when you were. Here with me i thought we'd be stronger that the past. Better than the ones before. How did i fool myself and thinking?. We had it all. I felt the world was ours for the taken. When i feel into your eyes. Never a doubt that we would make it if we try. You promised you never break my heart, never leave me in the dark, said your love would be for all time. But that was back when you were mine, when you were mine. What if this was it baby?. What if this was our time?. Maybe we'd long past saving. But i'm gonna give you one try. You better think twice.

the woman makes the man,"I'm all busted aces and empty pockets. An arrow shot straight through a locket. In this cheap hotel room on this lonesome highway. Everything I own in this tattered old suitcase. But you know I haven't always been this way. I used to be a hero, and a lover. She brought out the best in me. But now I'm just a lost soul with a broken heart. Half the man I used to be. It took losing her, for me to finally understand. That the woman really makes the man. She was like an angel. Sweet as tubelo honey. Every move she made was right on the money. But I took her for granted. Cause I thought I always hold her. And she bought into everyone line that I sold her. Oh but I threw it all away. Oh why did I throw it all away?. I used to be a hero, and a lover. She brought out the best in me. But now I'm just a lost soul with a broken heart. Half the man I used to be. It took losing her for me to finally understand. That the woman really makes the man. Well this face staring back at me in this mirror. Ain't the face I wanna see. Gotta figure out how to get back. To who I used to be. Oh yeah, oh. I used to be a hero, and a lover. She brought out the best in me. But now I'm just a lost soul with a broken heart. Half the man I used to be. It took losing her for me, to finally understand. That the woman really makes the man. Yes, a woman really makes a man"
can't take my eyes off you,I know that the bridges that I've burned. Along the way. Have left me with these walls and these scars. That won't go away.

And I just can't take my eyes off you. And I just can't take my eyes off you. I love when you tell me that I'm pretty. When I just wake up. And I love how you tease me when I'm moody.

And you don't wanna stay and break my heart. Well baby it's too late. Cause what about the times that you said to me. That I was everything that you'd ever need. How come you just up and walk away.

bartender,8 o'clock on Friday night. I'm still at home. All my girls just keep blowing up my phone. Saying come on he ain't worth the pain. Do what you gotta do to forget his name. Now there's only one thing left for me to do. Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots. Check the mirror one last time. And kiss the past goodbye. What I'm really needing now. Is a double shot of Crown. Chase that disco ball around. 'Til I don't remember. Go until they cut me off. Wanna get a little lost. In the noise. In the lights. Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight. 'Til the party and music and the truth collide. Bring it 'til his memory fades away. Hey bartender. Tonight I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor. Spin me round and let him buy a couple more.

ready to love again,"Seems like I was walking in the wrong direction. I barely recognize my own reflection, no. Scared of love but scared of life alone. Seems I've been playing on the safe side baby. Building walls around my heart to save me, oh. But it's time for me to let it go. Yeah, I'm ready to feel now. No longer am I afraid of the fall down. It must be time to move on now.

our kind of love,"Here we go!. You wear your smile like a summer sky. Just shining down on me and you. I swear your heart is a free bird. On a lazy Sunday afternoon. I love the way that you were up for anything. Never worried 'bout what people say. That's right, oh that's right. What we got is. Just like driving on an open highway. Never knowing what we're gonna find. Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up. Whoa, yeah, that's our kind of love. Mm that's our kind of love. Skipping rocks and leaving footprints.

freestyle,"We gonna do this thing?. Well, come on then!. River road, Chevy van. Cherry classic coke can. Rolling on the floorboard; Fleetwood, Macklemore. Coming out the speakers, spilling on the t-shirts. Getting loud like I'm standing in the bleachers. Creek bank, tire swing. Peeling off her blue jeans. Skinny deep sugar, fish a couple of new things. Hey, there ain't nothing wrong. Just making it up as we go along. Find a little rock 'n' roll hallelujah. Throw your hands up high. If the spirit moves ya, babe. Singing hey, hey, hey. We can do it old school, ABC style. Maybe we can go a little wild and freestyle. A summer jam mixtape, vodka in your lemonade. (Alright, alright) like McConaughey. White vinyl, gypsy revival. Traveling through the middle of the belt of the bible. Hula girl grass skirt shaking on the dashboard. Where we're going we don't need no passport. Hey, there ain't nothing wrong. Just making it up as we go along. Find a little rock 'n' roll hallelujah. Throw your hands up high. If the spirit moves ya, babe. Singing hey, hey, hey. We can do it old school, ABC style. Maybe we can go a little wild and freestyle. Oh, some of us like to watch and some like to dance. Though we all wake up with the same stamp on our hands. Counting stars and counting cars and just counting miles. Doing it freestyle, you style, me style. Ain't got nowhere to be, child. Hey, there ain't nothing wrong. Just making it up as we go along. Find a little rock 'n' roll hallelujah. Throw your hands up high. If the spirit moves ya, babe. Singing hey, hey, hey. We can do it old school, ABC style. Maybe we can go a little wild and freestyle. Oh, you can count it all, baby 1, 2, 3, child. Maybe we can go a little wild and freestyle"
747,"I could hear it through the line. I could tell from a crack in your voice. So static at the noise. It's leaving on the nine. When it comes to you. I do whatever I gotta do. I'm looking out from the window seat. Half way back I was 23. Man I wish that I could fly this thing. Give a little more gas. Little more speed. This 747. Can't go fast enough, fast enough. This 747. Can't go fast enough, fast enough. Every minute is wasting time. She gets a little bit closer to say goodbye. This 747. Can't go fast enough, fast enough. I could abuse a drink right now. I got my head in the clouds. Just thinking about. Seconds and the wheels touch down. Hit my feet at the ground. I'm right near house. A knock on the door. I kiss you right on the mouth. This 747. Can't go fast enough, fast enough. This 747. Can't go fast enough, fast enough. Every minute is wasting time. She gets a little bit closer to say goodbye. This 747. Can't go fast enough, fast enough.

heart of the world,"Ten cans on rattlin' pavement. Confetti scattered everywhere. She falls asleep in the seat beside me. Grass caught up in her hair. I don't mind it, I keep driving,. flying on these wheels of steel. A bit anxious, a bit nervous. The moment's all that we can feel. If fuel is the soul of the engine. And wine is the drink of the gods. Forgiveness the road to redemption. Faith can still beat the odds. We're meant to be baby hold onto me. You'll never not be my girl. Cause love is the heart of the world. I leave him sleepin as I rise early. Always up before the dawn. The house is dark, but I see clearly. Kettle sings a morning song. The bacons frying, babies crying. I soke up the sights and sounds. Minutes turn to days and I wish that I could slow it down. If grease is the soul of the kitchen. And coffee the drink of the gods. Routine too perfect to mention. Time is a thief I would rob. We're meant to be baby hold onto me. I'll never not be your girl. Cause love is the heart of the world. Ohh, and hope is the soul of the dreamer. And heaven is the home of my god. It only takes one true believer. To believe you can still beat the odds. We're meant to be baby hold onto me.

Broken like I'm never gonna heal. And I see a light, a little hope in a little girl. Hello world. Every day I drive by a little white church. It's got these little white crosses. Like angels in the yard. Maybe I should stop on in, say a prayer. Maybe talk to God like he is there. Oh, I know he's there. Yeah, I know he's there. Well hello world. How you been. Good to see you, my old friend. Sometimes I feel as cold as steel. And broken like Im never gonna heal. And I see a light, a little grace, a little faith unfurls. Well hello world. Sometimes I forget what living's for. And I hear my life through my front door. And I breathe it in. Oh, I'm home again. And I see my wife. Little boy and little girl. Hello world. Hello world.

home is where the heart is,I felt I was spinning my wheels. Before too long the road was calling. I packed everything I own. So sure that I was leaving this small town life behind. for good. And not a single tear was falling. It took leaving for me to understand. Sometimes your dreams just aren't what life has. planned. (Chorus). Mama said home is where the heart is. When I left that town. I made it all the way to West Virginia. And that's where my heart found. Exactly where I'm supposed to be. It didn't take much time. It's just south of the Mason Dixon line. It's just south of the Mason Dixon line. I worked third shift at an all night diner. Only stayed to save a little money for. Enough gas to make it to the east coast. That's when I saw the brightest pair of. Deep blue eyes walking straight into my life. And every night we talked till it became so clear. And I could feel those dreams inside shifting gears. Cause love brought me here. Mama said home is where the heart is. When I left that town. I made it all the way to West Virginia. And that's where my heart found. Exactly where I'm supposed to be. It didn't take much time. It's just south of the Mason Dixon line. It's just south of the Mason Dixon line. And I'm standing in my veil about to say I do. As mama smiles with tear drops in her eyes. And then I realize there's something mama always knew. Love is what I really left to find. Mama said home is where the heart is. When I left that town. I made it all the way to West Virginia. And that's where my heart found. Exactly where I'm supposed to be. It didn't take much time. It's just south of the Mason Dixon line. It's just south of the Mason Dixon line

it ain't pretty,"I had a feeling, I was feeling alright. It just happened to be Saturday night. I put my lipstick on a little too bright. And I took a deep breathe and started to drive. He let me in without a covered charge. I found my way to the back of the bar. Peeled the corners of the cocktail napkin. Watching everybody smiling, laughing. I just bought a drink. Downtown all alone. I'm searching through the names. Getting lost in my cellphone. It ain't pretty, It ain't pretty. When a heart breaks. I made my way to the bathroom mirror. I'm standing next to some girl spilling beer. She didn't notice I was drying my tears. Just look at me now, God, how'd I get here?. 'Cause I just kissed a boy. And I barely even knew his name. Let him take me by the hand. Hold me close while our old song played. It ain't pretty, it ain't pretty. When a heart breaks. I almost dialed your number. To remind you what you did. But I think it might be better. To just let this night end. So, I just called a cab. Outside it's starting to rain. Got my high heels in my hand. Oh I'm ready for the walk of shame. It ain't pretty, it ain't pretty no. It ain't pretty when a heart breaks. I just bought a drink, it ain't pretty. I just kissed a boy, it ain't pretty. I just called a cab"

And could this be the start of us. Every morning waking up. To your sleepy eyes smiling back. Or is it just too soon to ask. Can last night last. I probably should be going now. Cause I'm not quite sure what to say. I'm so afraid you might get scared. If I told you how much I wanna stay. Here we are somewhere between lovers and friends. Is this the end, or where it begins. Can last night last. Or was it just too much red wine. Or one too many lonely nights. Can last night last. And could this be the start of us. Every morning waking up. To your sleepy eyes smiling back. Or is it just too soon to ask. Can last night last"
lay our flowers down,"Candle wax, like a river on the concrete. Fears will fly if you let them. Pattern leather dress, shoes on a baby's feet. Is he too young to tell him. People come and gather round. Only love can lift us now. We find our common thread over tear-stained ground. Raise our voices up, lay our flowers down. White knuckles, cotton beads on a rosary. Hoping one has an answer. You hung it on the mirror only as a novelty. But now you squeeze it 'til your hands hurt. People come and gather round. Only love can lift us now. We find our common thread over tear-stained ground. Raise our voices up, lay our flowers down. Oh, lay 'em down. Another bad sign, another hard time. Headlines you can't ignore. This ain't the first time. This ain't the last time. Trouble's flying at your door. People come, people come. Oh, people come and gather round. Only love can lift us now. Only love can lift us now. We find our common thread over tear-stained ground. Raise our voices up, lay our flowers down. Raise our voices up, lay our flowers down. (Raise our voices up).

But I ain't got wings. Coming down (learnin to fly) is the hardest thing. Well some say life will beat you down. Break your heart, it'll steal your crown. So I've started out, for God knows where. I guess I'll know when I get there. I'm learning to fly, (learnin' to fly) around the clouds. But what goes up (learnin' to fly) must come down. Must come down but. I'm learning to fly, (learnin' to fly). But I ain't got wings. Coming down (learnin' to fly). Is the hardest thing, hardest thing, yeah!"

long teenage goodbye,"It was the start of the summer. And the days were getting hotter, yeah. 18 was just around the corner. And mamma made plans for a party by the pool side. I blew out the candles, smiling and laughing. Sister sneaking wine. While the camera was flashing. You grabbed my hand right on time. You looked so cute with your tattoo and your blue jeans. And you said to me. Let's go flying. Take me anywhere the wind blows. No use crying, we're not thinking 'bout tomorrow. We drug out those summer nights. For a long teenage goodbye. Chasing fireworks flashing down the Carolina shore, yeah. Arms around me and you called me yours. That salty kiss made me forget about my sunburn. Snuck in barefoot through a hole the wall. Got to do some karaoke. Till they yell last call. Sing with the birds, every season has a turn, turn, turn. So let's go flying. Take me anywhere the wind blows. No use crying, we're not thinking 'bout tomorrow. We drug out those summer nights. For a long teenage goodbye. A chill in the air's just around the bend.

But here in my arms I'll keep you warm. And hold you tight. On this winter's night. (we'll look back on the year). On this winter's night. (we'll count our blessings). On this winter's night.

You walk outside and all you see is rain. You look inside and all you feel is pain. And you can't see it now. (Chorus). But down the road the sun is shining. In every cloud there's a silver lining. Just keep holding on (just keep holding on). And every heartache makes you stronger. But it won't be much longer. You'll find love, you'll find peace. And the you you're meant to be. I know right now that's not the way you feel. But one day you will. You wake up every morning and ask yourself. What am I doing here anyway. With the weight of all those disappointments. Whispering in your ear. You're just barely hanging by a thread. You wanna scream but you?re down to your last breath. And you don't know it yet. (Repeat Chorus). Find the strength to rise above. You will. Find just what you're made of, you're made of. (Repeat Chorus). One day you will. Oh one day you will"
one great mystery,"I don't know how many stars fill the sky. I know we're here, but I don't know why. Maybe there's some other life out there. But as long as you're here with me, baby, I don't really care. There is only one great mystery. I keep searching for the answer desperately. Tell me, tell me baby, tell me please. What did I ever do to make you fall for me?. Don't know what happens when we live this world. I know I'll go right on loving you girl. I'll close my eyes and drift off into the blue. And if I go first, I will wait for you. There is only one great mystery. I keep searching for the answer desperately. Tell me, tell me baby, tell me please. What did I ever do to make you fall for me?. I guess I'll never really know. How I deserve someone that loves me so. There is only one great mystery. I keep searching for the answer desperately. Tell me, tell me baby, tell me please. What did I ever do to make you fall for me?"
our kind of love,"Here we go!. You wear your smile like a summer sky. Just shining down on me and you. I swear your heart is a free bird. On a lazy Sunday afternoon. I love the way that you were up for anything. Never worried 'bout what people say. That's right, oh that's right. What we got is. Just like driving on an open highway. Never knowing what we're gonna find. Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up. Whoa, yeah, that's our kind of love. Mm that's our kind of love. Skipping rocks and leaving footprints. Down along the riverbank. Always holding hands, never making plans. Just living in the moment, babe. You give me life and with those funny faces. You somehow always know just what to say. That's right, oh that's right. What we got is. Just like driving on an open highway. Never knowing what we're gonna find. Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up. Whoa, yeah, that's our kind of love. That's our kind of love. Oh that's right, baby you and I. What we got is. Just like driving on an open highway. Never knowing what we're gonna find.

out of goodbyes,"You tell me actions speak louder. But there's something about her words. That hurt. Closing up it's so late and. I'm the last one, still waiting for you to unlock the door. On our way home I realize. There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes, only veiled by a thin disguise. And now that I've done my time. I, I need to move on and I need you to try. Cuz we're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes, out of goodbyes. Never asked you to change, but sadly you don't feel the same about me. I wonder does your man, still shudder when you touch his hand, like this man. And on our way home I realize. There is some kind of storm brewing in his eyes,. Only veiled by a thin disguise. Now that I've done my time, I, I need to move on. And I need you to try. Cuz we're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes"
perfect day,"Been walking through town just the other day. With nothing much to do. As the sun came breaking down through the clouds. I'd never seen the sky so blue. I saw a Cajun man with a red guitar playing on the. side of the street. I threw a handful of change in his beat-up case and said. Play me a country beat. And it sounded like.... Met up with some friends outside of town where we. headed towards the lake. I hopped into the back of a jacked up jeep. Felt the wind upon my face. We got to the spot and the sun was hot. Everybody was feelin' fine. So we jumped on in for a midday swim and we lost all track of time. It was the perfect day. What I'd give if I could find a way to stay. lost in this moment now. Ain't worried about tomorrow when you're busy living in a perfect day. As the moon came out and the fire burned. Everybody was singing along. To some Ramblin Man, a little Curtis Lowe and all them feel good songs. We danced all night without a care, no place we'd. rather be. Cuz these are the days we'll talk about. When we lived so wild and free. It was the perfect day. What I'd give if I could find a way to stay. lost in this moment now. Ain't worried about tomorrow when you're busy living in a perfect day. We were sitting in the sand as he grabbed my hand. And leaned in for a kiss. I couldn't help but think with the stars above. It don't get much better than this. It was the perfect day. What I'd give if I could find a way to stay lost in this moment now. Ain't worried about tomorrow when you're. Busy living, feels like dreaming, slowy drifting. through this. Perfect day"
ready to love again,"Seems like I was walking in the wrong direction. I barely recognize my own reflection, no. Scared of love but scared of life alone. Seems I've been playing on the safe side baby. Building walls around my heart to save me, oh. But it's time for me to let it go. Yeah, I'm ready to feel now. No longer am I afraid of the fall down. It must be time to move on now. Without the fear of how it might end. I guess I'm ready to love again. Just when we think that love will never find you. You runaway but still it's right behind you, oh. It's just something that you can't control. Yeah, I'm ready to feel now. No longer am I afraid of the fall down. It must be time to move on now. Without the fear of how it might end. I guess I'm ready to love again. So come and find me. I'll be waiting up for you. I'll be holding out for you tonight. Yeah, I'm ready to feel now. No longer am I afraid of the fall down. It must be time to move on now. Without the fear of how it might end. I guess I'm ready, I'm ready to love again"
she is,"She hails from boston,. She hates the sounds of goodbyes,. Wait. She loves sundays and champagne. She can't stand the winter. She can't stand anything that. She can't change, all that she can't change. She is whatever she wants to be. She is a little of everything. Mixed up, so tough in a beautiful way. She's got the world in her fingertips. And she makes beauty look effortless. And I want everything she is. She is, she is. I want everything she is. When we talk for hour. And she wrote the book on how to get nowhere. Don't matter what I say. I could buy her flowers. That's just too cliche to impress. A girl like her, but you know I kinda like it that way. She is whatever she wants to be. She is a little of everything. Mixed up, so tough in a beautiful way. She's got the world in her fingertips. And she makes beauty look effortless. And I want everything she is. She is, she is. I want everything she is. All I think about and I can't do without. The good, the bad, the somewhere in between. Oh, cuz I want everything she is. She is whatever she wants to be. She is a little of everything. Mixed up, so tough in a beautiful way. She's got the world in her fingertips. And she makes beauty look effortless. And I want everything she is. She is, she is.

silver bells,"City sidewalks, busy sidewalks. Dressed in holiday style. In the air. There's a feeling like Christmas. Children laughing, people passing. Meeting smile after smile. And on every street corner you hear. Silver bells, silver bells. It's Christmas time in the city. Ring-a-ling, hear them ring. Soon it will be Christmas day. Strings of street lights. Even stop lights. Blink a bright red and green. As the shoppers rush home. With their treasures. Hear the snow crunch. See the kids bunch. This is Santa's big scene. And above all. The bustle you hear. Silver bells, silver bells. It's Christmas time in the city. Ring-a-ling, hear them ring. Soon it will be Christmas day"
singing me home,"My baby's riding shotgun. Singin just a little off key. Her feet on the dashboard. Tapping out the back beat. The song on the radio's. Is talking about the love we make.

somewhere love remains,Here we go again. Sitting on the edge of leaving. You don't have to speak. I can see it in your eyes. I know you too well. You know I can tell your hiding. Something inside. Baby just breathe in. Breathe out. Before you turn around. Just slow down. Think of all the love we've made. If we give it just one more try. Maybe we could stop this goodbye. I know through all this pain. Somehow somewhere love remains. You say don't walk away. But baby give me one good reason. More than just a line. You better make it count this time. You told me but you never really showed me. That I'm worth the fight. Oh I'm worth the fight. Baby just breathe in. Breathe out. Before you turn around. Just slow down. Think of all the love we've made. If we give it just one more try. Maybe we could stop this goodbye. I know through all this pain. Somehow somewhere love remains.

Baby just breathe in. Breathe out. The only time for love is right now. Forgive all of the mistakes we've made. If we give it just one more try. Maybe we could stop this goodbye. Through the fire and rain. Somehow somewhere. I know through this pain. Somehow somewhere love remains. So baby just breathe in. Breathe out. I never wanted to give up this fight. What if we give it baby one more try?. Let's try. This time. Baby this time. Baby this time. Baby this time
sounded good at the time,"Standin' by the door, checkin' my hair. Waitin' on you to take me nowhere. We were always lookin' for a rock n' roll saturday night. Sittin' all home with a radio station. Listen all night to hear my dedication. A song to tell the whole town you're mine (that's right). We sing like we wrote every word to the whole damn thing. Like nothing will ever change and we dance. Like time weren't really slipping through our hands. Oh, when you said I loved you, it mighta been low. But it sure sounded good at the time. Just a hand-me-down, a pontiac. Let's see how many friends we can? In the back. Saved all summer for a ticket on the front row (let's go). Didn't have a plan and we ran outta money. Car broke down but it's still kinda funny. Cuz we hitched a ride with some hippy guy. And barely made it to the show and. We sing like we wrote every word to the whole damn thing. Like nothing will ever change and we dance. Like time weren't really slipping through our hands. Made it back alive, made up a good lie. But it sure sounded good at the time. Aw, yeah, we did some wrong. We did it right. But it sure sounded so good at the time. You were mine, alright. Woaah, well alright. And we sing like we wrote every word to the whole damn thing. Like nothing will ever change and we dance.

teenage heart,"We were circus lights and cannonballs. We were way too high to ever fall. We were fireflies and shooting stars. We were burning up from the start. And we'd say are we gonna live forever?. I love you to my dying death. But sometimes hearts get swept up. In the waves. Remember when the night turned up. And sun went down. If just for a moment. We were falling at the speed of sound. Yeah, the moon played a part. Two shadows in the dark. Beating with a teenage heart. Beating with a teenage heart. Would I ever recognise your face. If I saw you in a crowded place?. Would you hair still fall the way it did?. Would we laugh. And sing like when we were kids, oh. Remember when the night turned up. And sun went down. If just for a moment. We were falling at the speed of sound. Yeah, the moon played a part. Two shadows in the dark. Beating with a teenage heart. Beating with a teenage heart. Yeah, we thought that we would last forever. Thought our love would never fade. Had your hand pressed on the window. As you pulled away. Remember when the night turned up. And sun went down. If just for a moment. We were falling at the speed of sound. Yeah, the moon played a part. Two shadows in the dark. Beating with a teenage heart. Beating with a teenage heart. A teenage heart. Ooh, yeah, beating with a teenage heart"
the first noel,"The First Noel, the Angels did say. Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay. In fields where they lay keeping their sheep. On a cold winter's night that was so deep.. Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel. Born is the King of Israel!. . . They looked up and saw a star. Shining in the East beyond them far. And to the earth it gave great light. And so it continued both day and night.. Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel. Born is the King of Israel!. And by the light of that same star. Three Wise men came from country far. To seek for a King was their intent. And to follow the star wherever it went.. Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel. Born is the King of Israel!. This star drew nigh to the northwest. O'er Bethlehem it took its rest. And there it did both Pause and stay. Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.. Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel. Born is the King of Israel!. Then entered in those Wise men three. Full reverently upon their knee. And offered there in His presence. Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.. Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel. Born is the King of Israel!. Then let us all with one accord. Sing praises to our heavenly Lord. That hath made Heaven and earth of nought. And with his blood mankind has bought.. Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel. Born is the King of Israel!"

the woman makes the man,"I'm all busted aces and empty pockets. An arrow shot straight through a locket. In this cheap hotel room on this lonesome highway. Everything I own in this tattered old suitcase. But you know I haven't always been this way. I used to be a hero, and a lover. She brought out the best in me. But now I'm just a lost soul with a broken heart. Half the man I used to be. It took losing her, for me to finally understand. That the woman really makes the man. She was like an angel.

things people say,"There I was at the bus stop beggin' you just to stay. Can we work this out, baby we can work this out. A dust trail from a Greyhound headed for the West. Coast. As I watch you leave, it's gettin' hard to breathe. No this ain't how it was suppose to be. While you're out chasin' all your dreams. Tell me where does that leave me. (Chorus). What about the plans that you left behind. The little white house by the railway line. The one we picked out. We even put the payment down. What about the promise that you made. To stay with me till your dying day. Said you'd never go away. Are they just things that people say. The preacher stopped by the house last Tuesday. Asked if I was fine. We sat and talked a while. He tried to make me smile. But it's so hard to show my face round lately. In this small town. I guess they heard the news. 'Bout me and you. It's three a.m. and I can't sleep at all. I wonder where you are tonight and do I ever cross. your mind. (Repeat Chorus). Well my momma won't stop crying. She wonders what went wrong. Could I have loved a little deeper.

Your touch. The rush. When you showed up late on new year's eve. And you tried to hold my hand. You told me that you'd met someone. And I said I understand. It's hard not to fall apart. With a midnight broken heart. So I cried. But that was the last time. 'cause I don't think about you and me. What we used to be. Every memory anymore. Forgot about what we went through.

Wasted too much time, should've seen the signs. Now I know just what went wrong. I guess I wanted you more. And looking back now, I'm sure. I wanted you more. I guess I wanted you more. All the nights we spent, just talking. Of the things we wanted out of life. Making plans and dreams together. Wish I'd seen, I was just too blind. My heart was open, exposed and hoping. For you to lay it on the line. In the end it seemed. There was no room for me. Still, I tried to change your mind. I guess I wanted you more. And looking back now, I'm sure. I wanted you more. I guess I wanted you more. Oh, I don't need you. I don't need you anymore. I guess I wanted you more. And looking back now, I'm sure. I wanted you more. I guess I wanted you more. I don't need you. I don't need you anymore"
we owned the night,"Tell me have you ever wanted. Someone so much it hurts?. Your lips keep trying to speak. But you just can't find the words. Well I had this dream once. I held it in my hands. She was the purest beauty. But not the common kind. She had a way about her. That made you feel alive. And for a moment. You made the world stand still. Yeah we owned the night. You had me dim the lights. You danced just like a child. The wine spilled on your dress. And all you did was smile. Yeah, it was perfect. And I'll hold it in my mind. Yeah, we owned the night. When the summer rolls around. And the sun starts sinking down. I still remember you. Oh, I remember you. And I wonder where you are. Are you looking at those same stars again?. Do you remember when?. We woke under a blanket. All tangled up in skin. Not knowing in that moment. We'd never speak again. But it was perfect. I never will forget. When we owned the night. Yeah, we owned the night"

when you were mine,"Words spoking my heart open. No i never had butterflies like that. We danced in the moon glow your hands move so. You kissed me on the lips swore i wouldn't look back. It was just like we were flying in another time. I felt the world was ours for the taken. When i feel into your eyes. Never a doubt that we would make it if we try. You promised you never break my heart, never leave me in the dark, said your love would be for all time. But that was back when you were mine, when you were. Here with me i thought we'd be stronger that the past. Better than the ones before. How did i fool myself and thinking?. We had it all. I felt the world was ours for the taken. When i feel into your eyes. Never a doubt that we would make it if we try. You promised you never break my heart, never leave me in the dark, said your love would be for all time. But that was back when you were mine, when you were mine. What if this was it baby?. What if this was our time?. Maybe we'd long past saving. But i'm gonna give you one try. You better think twice. Before you leave her behind. What if the world was ours for the taken?. when i feel into your eyes. Never a doubt that we would make it if we try. You promised you never break my heart, never leave me in the dark, said your love would be for all time. But that was back when you were mine, when we were in love, do you remember the time when you were mine?. Uuuuuuuuh. But that was back when you were mine. What if this was it baby. What if this was our time. Back when we were in love. Back when you were mine. That was back when you were mine. Back when we were in love. In love. You said you'd be there. You said it would last forever. I guess you never meant it baby. Did you baby?"
woman scorned,"Candy caught beau. In bed with a red head. She threw a fit and a fern. And the F word at both of them. She peppered him with bb's. Cuz she couldn't find a 12 gauge. Cinda Lou, I know your husband. And there's gonna be hell to pay. There ain't nothing. Like a woman scorned. Ain't nothing more dangerous. Than a country girl. Trading her halo for horns. Neighbors knew. They were in for a war. They saw. A screaming half naked. Waffle house waitress. Flying off the porch. No one slams the door. Like a women scorned. Candy came back beau. Was zipping up his levis. Chasing him around the kitchen. He was tring to apolagize. He dialed a 9 and a 1 before. She landed that left hook. She knocked him out cold. Candy's stronger than she looks. There ain't nothing. Like a woman scorned. Ain't nothing more dangerous. Than a country girl. Trading her halo for horns. The neighbors knew. Who was winning that war. They saw a half naked. Pleading husband. Who'd been cheating spread. Eagle on the porch. No one slams the door. Like a woman scorned. Ain't nothing. Like a woman scorned. Ain't nothing more dangerous. Than a country girl. Trading her halo for horns. She swears. All is fair in love and war. She said if you wanna be a dog. I'll treat you like a dog. Your sleeping on the porch. No one slams a door. Like a woman scorned. Like a woman scorned"
you look good,"On a boat, on a beach. In the water, in the sand, in the back of a bar. Cold beer in your hand. Breaking hearts, breaking necks. When we rolling down the street. Heads turning all day when they see you with me. I'm thinking everybody better stand in line. 'Cause they need to know. That your body's coming with me tonight. They're like, ""hey, who that there with the shades? "". Like oh, the way you move to the bass. Hold up. Whole room gets to spinnin'. From the second that you walk in. And baby you look good all day, all night. You look good, so fresh, so fine. You look good, got everybody watching you. Like cameras in Hollywood. Baby you look good. Aw baby you look good. Black dress, 2 the 9s, New Year's in a pent. From the floor, to the roof, make the skyline spin. Yeah, you're killing me boy in your black-faded jeans. Ain't gotta work hard when you're smilin' at me. Like, ""hey, who that there with the shades? "". Like oh, the way you move to the bass. Hold up. Whole room gets to spinnin'. From the second that you walk in. And baby you look good all day, all night. You look good, so fresh, so fine. You look good, got everybody watching you. Like cameras in Hollywood.
