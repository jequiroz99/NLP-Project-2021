backwards again,"""Backwards Again"". Lately I've been feeling so confused. Tried so hard to believe that we were through. My mind knows you only bring me down. But my heart won't let me turn around. It feels like I'm walking backwards again. Never know where I'm going. Only seeing where I've been. With every little step I take. You're making me loose my way. But I can't stop walking backwards again. Let myself wander into deep. Didn't notice that you weren't there for me. You said that it would stop the rain. But my tears still fall cos you ain't never gonna change. It feels like I'm walking backwards again. Never know where I'm going. Only seeing where I've been. With every little step I take. You're making me loose my way. But I can't stop walking backwards again. Even though I know that I'll be sorry. I need to see your face. Somehow I find my way back to you. Knowing it's the same old story. No matter what I do, when it comes to you. I can't get away. It feels like I'm walking backwards again. Never know where I'm going. Only seen where I've been. With every little step I take. You're making me loose my way. But I can't stop walking backwards again. Can't stop myself"
better to be lonely,"""Better To Be Lonely"". I hear it on the radio everywhere I go. They tell me I'm a loser to be alone. The silver screen and Seventeen say I'm supposed to be. 2 not 1 in a lifetime of afterglow. Don't wait, don't wait. Hurry into another mistake. I'm taking my time, I know what I mean. I made up my mind, now I believe. It's better to be lonely. One look and I'm giving out my number. One kiss and I'm calling you mine. The next thing I know I'm going under. Why do I need that misery, I think I believe. It's better to be lonely. They used to say that fools rush in and I swear I've been. The fool that wanted someone else to make me whole. And I don't mind hanging out with me, I like the company. Someday I'll find someone who will move my soul. 'Til then, 'til then. I'm not jumping in again. I'm taking my time, I know what I mean. I made up my mind, now I believe. It's better to be lonely. One look and I'm giving out my number. One kiss and I'm calling you mine. The next thing I know I'm going under. Why do I need that misery, I think I believe. It's better to be lonely. I'm not saying now or never. I just know there's something better yeah?"
it's a beautiful thing,Am I losing my mind. You're everywhere and I don't know why. Something I can't deny. On and on like a song in my head. And I can't do a thing about it. When your heart can't stop. Like a runaway train. And love walks in like a hurricane. It's a beautiful thing. When it feels so good. That you can't let go. When you're so far gone. Cos you couldn't say no. It's a beautiful thing. I keep hearing your name. It's in the sun and it's in the rain. I just heard it again. Don't know how it got into my head. But I don't wanna be without it. When your heart can't stop. Like a runaway train. And it feels so good. That you can't explain. It's a beautiful thing. When you just can't do. Without anything else. And you give so much. That you lose yourself. It's a beautiful thing. Hope this feeling never goes away. When you lose your way. Don't have a clue. And you happen to find somebody like you. It's a beautiful thing. When you're on the moon. And you can't get down. Just me and you. No-one else around. It's a beautiful thing. When your heart can't stop. Like a runaway train. And it feels like you've drunk a case of champagne. It's a beautiful thing. It's a beautiful thing. It's a beautiful thing. So beautiful. by _vinnii
it's a little late,I trembled in your presence. I was lost the very minute. That you came my way. There was no escape. I pictured us together. But you told me you weren't ready. Said it's much too soon. That's a year ago. You asked me to be patient. So I told myself that I could wait. And time went by. Somehow it's different now. So if you start to make regrets. It's a little late. All that you've been wishing for. Was right in your hands. But you covered your eyes. When you could have seen through its disguise. You didn't realize. All that you've been wishing for. Was not out of reach. You discovered as I walked away. You complained. But it won't bring me back. Can't you see that. It's a little late. . Everything's the opposite. of what it used to be. I guess and now you know. what I was going through. You are counting days apart. But can't find one way to win back. My heart but babe. What is it they say. Good things come to those who wait. Not if you only hesitate. Like you in doubt. So your time ran out. . So if you start to make regrets. It's a little late. All that you've been wishing for. Was right in your hands. But you covered your eyes. When you could have seen through its disguise. You didn't realize. All that you've been wishing for. Was not out of reach. You discovered as I walked away. You complained. But it won't bring me back. Can't you see that. It's a little late. It's a little late. You had it all. It was right in your hands. Maybe you by now start to regret mistakes. It is much too late
ordinary day,"""Ordinary Day"". She never had a break. He was always running late. Did she push too hard. Didn't mean to go that far. He never had no faith. Spent his whole life in the shade. He was never satisfied. He had a different frame of mind. She said. I want you for my own. I never see you anymore. You're always walking out that door. He said. I want some time alone. So don't wait. I'm not coming home. It's just an ordinary day?. Maybe it wasn't meant to be. I guess they didn't even see. Is this love to hard to mend. Is this where the story ends. Just another story told. As I watch it all unfold. It's another day of life. But it's gonna be alright. She said. I want you for my own. I never see you anymore. You're always walking out that door. He said. I want some time alone. So don't wait. I'm not coming home. It's just an ordinary day?. [Repeat chorus]"
pointless relationship,"Lately it seems she keeps hitting him over the head. With one word: when?. Should they go left or right or maybe high or low?. Why can't he pretend?. That things will stay the same and he can just keep on.... [chorus]. Chillin' out and sleepin' in on mondays. Has she been wastin' all her time?. 'cause he's so not into. Waking up and workin' 9 to 5 all week. The kids, the house, the dog, and the suv. Will they ever agree?. Somtimes she wonders if they're ever gonna live. Up to who they could be;. The real world is heading for them like a high speed train and. And he's not ready. He wants things to say the same. So he can just keep on.... [chorus]. Chillin' out and sleepin' in on mondays. Has she been wastin' all her time?. 'cause he's so not into. Waking up and workin' 9 to 5 all week. The kids, the house, the dog, and the suv. Will they ever agree?. Yeah yeah yeah. She really doesn't know where they stand. Find a compromise or she'll walk away. He really loves her but then again. He wants it to stay the same. She really want a change but. He wants to keep on.... [chorus]. Chillin' out and sleepin' in on mondays. Has she been wastin' all her time?. 'cause he's so not into. Waking up and workin' 9 to 5 all week.

something better,"Here I am a little nervous thinking. Where do I begin. Can't seem to find the words today. Never got a chance to tell you. Guess I couldn't bear to say. There would be a time that I'd be on my way. Looking back. It's seems to me. I always knew. I left a little piece of me with you. All I know is,. We go in and out of love. We don't know what we want. Holding out for something better. Through every twist and turn. We live but we don't learn. All we want is something better. Starry night I'm driving late. Wishing I was somewhere. City lights are fading as I go. Colours change and all I have with me. Is an empty space. Funny how you miss what you don't know. Looking back. It seems that we were always free. But there's a little bit of you with me. All I know is. We go in and out of love. We don't know what we want. Holding out for something better. Through every twist and turn. We live but we don't learn. All we want is something better. Only know what you've got 'til its gone. Why's it always taking so long. Get used to holding. Used to holding on. All I know?"
tender,"This place ain't where I thought I'd be. I'm trapped in, I need fresh air. When's the last time that you. Said that you care. Just a simple thing like that. Did you forget and just freeze over. Rewind back when we first met. You were such an emotional man. What happened to that. So sure I'd be, always there. You somehow let the feeling drift away. But this heart, this mind. Needs to be treated a little more tender, tender. Love's not remote control. I need to get treated a little more tender, tender. You're caught up, consumed. I'm kind of numb, feel nothing. But unbeautiful. Can't you give back something. Anything at all. I'm still here I'm waiting for you to notice and remember. But this heart, this mind. Needs to be treated a little more tender, tender. Love's not remote control. I need to get treated a little more tender, tender. Don't complicate it baby. Cos I ain't asking for much just for you to. Leave me breathless and move me. Sometimes, anytime. Cos I can't hang around now, oh no. I need a little more now?. But this heart, this mind. Needs to be treated a little more tender, tender. Love's not remote control. I need to get treated a little more tender, tender. by _vinnii"
whatever will be,"Sometimes I feel like I'm a bird with broken wings. At times I dread my now and envy where I've been. Cos that's when quiet wisdom takes control. At least I've got a story no-one's told. I finally learned to say. Whatever will be will be. I've learned to take. The good, the bad and breathe. Cos although we like to know what life's got planned. No-one knows if shooting stars will land. These days it feels naïve to put your faith in hope. To imitate a child falling backwards on the snow. Cos that's when fears will usually lead you blind. and now I try to under-analyse. I finally learned to say. Whatever will be will be. I've learned to take. The good, the bad and breathe. Cos although we like to know what life's got planned. No-one knows if shooting stars will land. Is the road I walk wearing thin?. Is the life I love caving in?. Is the weight of your mind. A heavy black bird caged inside?. Say whatever will be. Take the good, the bad, just breathe?. Repeat chorus. by _vinnii"
world without you,"Days and nights and nights and days. and silent shades of lazy greys. I call your name. It's all the same. Sitting staring at the ceiling. Dripping painted pictures peeling. From my wall. The time just crawls. Was it yesterday I don't know. Was I dreaming or did I lose everything. I believed in. (If you could only see what I see). Every time we meet. Imagine a world with no sky. Imagine the ocean run dry. Imagine then you'll see the view. of a world without you. Imagine no sun and no rain. Imagine that each day's the same. It doesn't matter what I do. in a world without you?. Do is doing, and think is thinking. Lonely lovers' lips are sinking. In my tea. They're burning me. Wasted, weeping someone speaking. Thru my head, the bed is leaking. Tears again. And there's no end. Was it yesterday I don't know. Was I dreaming or did I lose everything. I believed in. (If you could only see what I see). Every time we meet. Imagine a world with no sky. Imagine the ocean run dry. Imagine then you'll see the view. of a world without you. Imagine no sun and no rain. Imagine that each day's the same. It doesn't matter what I do. in a world without you?. My world without you"
