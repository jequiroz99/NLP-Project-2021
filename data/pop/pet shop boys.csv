give stupidity a chance,"Intelligent people have had their say. It's time for the foolish to show the way. Let's lead this world a merry dance. Let's give stupidity a chance. We've heard quite enough of experts and their dealings. Why face the facts when you can just feel the feelings?. Let's lead this world a merry dance. Let's give stupidity a chance. Forget political correctness. I mean W-T-F?. I don't wanna think about the world. I wanna talk about myself!. Instead of governing with thoughtful sensitivity. Let's shock and awe the world with idiotic bigotry. Let's lead this world a merry dance. And give stupidity a chance. You say corruption, I say justified reward. Keeps the cronies loyal chairmen of the board. Let's lead this world a merry dance. And give stupidity a chance. Forget political correctness. Let's talk man to man. Chicks are always up for it. You gotta grab whatever you can. We need a leader who knows that money means class. With an eye for a peach-perfect piece of ass. Not a total dumb-cluck, just one of the guys. Let's give stupidity a prize. Let's lead this world a merry dance. And give stupidity a chance. Let's give stupidity a chance"

being boring,"I came across a cache of old photos. And invitations to teenage parties. ""Dress in white"" one said, with quotations. From someone's wife, a famous writer. In the nineteen-twenties. When you're young you find inspiration. In anyone who's ever gone. And opened up a closing door. She said: ""We were never feeling bored. 'Cause we were never being boring. We had too much time to find for ourselves. And we were never being boring. We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends"". And we were never holding back or worried that. Time would come to an end. When I went I left from the station. With a haversack and some trepidation. Someone said: ""If you're not careful. You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for. In the nineteen-seventies"". But I sat back and looking forward. My shoes were high and I had scored. I'd bolted through a closing door. I would never find myself feeling bored. 'Cause we were never being boring. We had too much time to find for ourselves. And we were never being boring. We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends"". And we were never holding back or worried that. Time would come to an end. We were always hoping that, looking back. You could always rely on a friend. Now I sit with different faces. In rented rooms and foreign places. All the people I was kissing. Some are here and some are missing. In the nineteen-nineties. I never dreamt that I would get to be. The creature that I always meant to be. But I thought in spite of dreams. You'd be sitting somewhere here with me. 'Cause we were never being boring. We had too much time to find for ourselves. And we were never being boring. We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends"". And we were never holding back or worried that. Time would come to an end.

the way it used to be,"I'm here, you're there. Come closer, tonight I'm lonely. Come here with me. I want it the way it used to be. What is left of love?. Tell me, who would even care?.

We knew our lives had just begun. We could do anything, we're fearless when we're young. Under the moon, address unknown. I can remember nights in Rome. I thought that love would last, a promise set in stone. I'd survive with only memories. If I could change the way I feel. But I want more than only memories. A human touch to make them real. Another day, another dream. Over the bridge an empty scene. We'd spend the weekend lost in bed and float upstream. I don't know why we moved away. Lost in the here and now we strayed. Into a New York zone, our promise was betrayed. I was there, caught on Tenth Avenue. You elsewhere with Culver City blues. Then and there I knew that I'd lost you. What is left of love?. Tell me, who will even care?. So much time has passed. I'd still meet you anywhere. Water under bridge. Evening after day. What is left of love. Here that didn't drift away?. Don't give me all your love and pain. Don't sell me New York in the rain. Let's leave our promises behind. Rewind and try again. What remains in time that didn't fade away?. Sometimes I need to see.

requiem in denim and leopardskin,"I thought it was like a film. Reviewed but never seen. Where everybody played themselves. As a drama king or queen. The music was overwhelming. Glitter in and fiend. Some are chavy like a requiem. In Denim and Leopardskin. I visualise the flashbacks. School, home cross obsess. Heart is too much of everything. The cliches, the candles, the mess. Lucy and I never seen with David. Brian never talks. Help me in policks and sense in Arnold. Tell me all about Reddocks. Ozzy's last collection. Beavis closed himself. A little more rouge and powder cheeks. But the base is pay off. This is our last chance for goodbye. Let the music begin. Shining and souring like a requiem. In denim and leopardskin. In ended with a motorbike. A search for every dance. Pouring over our photographs. To make it all fake sense. Glomorous in it's own way. Shouting above the dead. Some are chavy like a requiem. In denim and leopardskin. Janice and Marlyn, Ronald Creepers. Malcom's around the block. Adam's in the jungle film. But Luc has let it walk. The Johnsons and the Jenkins. Hail by keeping smile. All you need to make it big. It takes some style. This is our last chance for goodbye. Let the music begin. Shining and souring like a requiem. In denim and leopardskin. This is our last chance for goodbye. Let the music begin. Shining and souring like a requiem. In denim and leopardskin. Requiem in denim and leopardskin. This is our last chance for goodbye.

a cloud in a box,Hidden away. Behind doors and locks. A magician kept. A cloud in a box. Once a week. He'd display his prize. To the great surprise. Of questioning eyes. A young girl said. It was sad to see. And wasn't it time. To set it free?. A schoolboy declared. That it shouldn't exist. How did it get there. This fluffy white mist?. The magician shrugged. And would only reply. That was a secret. Between him and the sky

a powerful friend,He's got a powerful friend. Who owes him nothing and knows how to spend. Lives in his apartment for free. Waits on the table at tea. Whips up the coffee and cream. Sometimes cries or he'd scream. Phones for the grocery van. The milkman delivers and the newspapers land. When he gets home overnight. His old man mutters and puts up a fight. Over some political scheme. Sometimes cries or he'd scream. Spends all his days en coucher. There's absolutely nothing new to do but delay. The plan to take a different stand. When pizza boys deliver what he needs on demand. Eyes lit with a nicotine gleam. Sometimes cries or he'd scream
a red letter day,"Go to work and take your calls. Hang the fruits of your labor on the wall. With such precision and care. What does it matter if there's no one here to share?. The flowers in the garden. The wine. The ""Waiting for Godot"". And so much modern time. All I want. Is what you want. I'm always waiting. For a Red Letter Day. The years perfecting a stance. Of measured cool. Fading to insignificance. The moment one starts to understand. What on Earth does it. Profit a man?. All I want. Is what you want. I'm always waiting. For a Red Letter Day. For something special. Somehow new. Someone saying ""I love you"". Maybe I'm waiting for a Red Letter Day. You can sneer. Or disappear behind your veneer. Of self control. But for all of those who don't fit in. Who follow their instincts and are told they sin. This is a prayer for a different way. All I want. Is what you want. I'm always waiting. For a Red Letter Day. Like Christmas morning when you're a kid. Admit you love me and you always did. Maybe I'm waiting for that Red Letter Day. I'm always waiting. I'm always waiting. Waiting. For something special. Somehow new. Someone saying ""I love you"". Maybe I'm hoping for that Red Letter Day. Today."

Permission is bestowed. According to postal code. Terms and conditions may vary. It's nothing out of the ordinary. Sometimes someone gets upset. Doesn't hear the laughter. Takes it as a threat. But it's different after. After the event. Looks like someone's smiling. Happy to be here. There's a kind of glow. Illuminates the flow. Over to the east. Of traffic in the streets. Not to be outdone. The school run has begun. Mothers all arrive. Each in a four-wheel drive. Sometimes someone gets upset. Doesn't hear the laughter. Takes it as a threat. But it's different after. After the event. Looks like someone's smiling. Happy to be here. Blue skies heaven-sent. Evening comes as a surprise. Suddenly someone dies. Everyone's over-reacting. With clichés and bad acting. Misty in the rain. Flowers in their cellophane. Policemen intervening. Drama without meaning. It's perfectly routine. A statement from the queen. Obituaries appear. You can leave your tributes here. Sometimes someone gets upset. Doesn't hear the laughter. Takes it as a threat. But it's different after. After the event. Looks like someone's smiling. Happy to be here. Blue skies heaven-sent

being boring,"I came across a cache of old photos. And invitations to teenage parties. ""Dress in white"" one said, with quotations. From someone's wife, a famous writer. In the nineteen-twenties. When you're young you find inspiration. In anyone who's ever gone. And opened up a closing door. She said: ""We were never feeling bored. 'Cause we were never being boring. We had too much time to find for ourselves. And we were never being boring. We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends"". And we were never holding back or worried that. Time would come to an end. When I went I left from the station. With a haversack and some trepidation. Someone said: ""If you're not careful. You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for. In the nineteen-seventies"". But I sat back and looking forward. My shoes were high and I had scored. I'd bolted through a closing door. I would never find myself feeling bored. 'Cause we were never being boring. We had too much time to find for ourselves. And we were never being boring. We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends"". And we were never holding back or worried that. Time would come to an end. We were always hoping that, looking back. You could always rely on a friend. Now I sit with different faces. In rented rooms and foreign places. All the people I was kissing. Some are here and some are missing. In the nineteen-nineties. I never dreamt that I would get to be. The creature that I always meant to be. But I thought in spite of dreams. You'd be sitting somewhere here with me. 'Cause we were never being boring. We had too much time to find for ourselves. And we were never being boring. We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends"". And we were never holding back or worried that. Time would come to an end. We were always hoping that, looking back. You could always rely on a friend. And we were never being boring. We were never being bored. 'Cause we were never being boring. We were never being bored"

Who they will beg to hang around with. You're so beautiful and calm. But with an attitude that says:. ""Hands-off, you're just not good enough"". Every boy and man feeling lonely. Can't understand why you'd be with me. Furthermore, we laugh and we draw. More attention everyday, so they say:. (Girlfriend) Bet she's not your girlfriend, oh no,.

They wonder what that I have got, that they have not. They'll never understand that none of that matters. Every boy and man feeling lonely. Can't understand why you'd be with me. Furthermore, we laugh and we draw. More attention everyday, so they say:. (Girlfriend) Bet she's not your girlfriend, oh no,. (Oh oh oh Girlfriend) You better make her happy.

betrayed,Did you ever feel betrayed by someone in your life?. Did you ever give your trust and have it sold?. For the sake of cheap expedience I now experience. feeling betrayed by you. I woke at five this morning with you on my mind. replaying conversations in my head. You said if you'd to choose between some money and a friend. you'd always choose the friend. So how come you could change your mind so easily?. How was it so speedily arranged?. You struck an easy bargain when persuaded it was not. and now it's all you've got. And still you need to justify yourself. to others but not me. with that more-in-sorrow-than-anger routine. Sometimes I think I'm going mad. when I hear you've said 'It's sad. He feels hard done by me'. Did you ever give a thought for someone else's pride?. Your actions prove that actually you did. and threw it out the door as opportunity came through. I'd been betrayed by you. And still you need to justify yourself. to others but not me. with that more-in-sorrow-than-anger routine. Sometimes I think I'm going mad. when I hear you've said 'it's sad. he feels hard done by me'. Did you ever feel betrayed by someone in your life?. Did you ever give your trust and have it sold?.

I gotta get out, I gotta get out. When your life runs out of steam. And you need a little time. If your muse is out of luck. You might need an extra rhyme. When your heart escapes your head downways. In the growing queue that life creates. I stop for some breathing space. Divert from the public place. Return to a private place. I know it's the adjusting case. I gotta get out, I gotta get out. Far far away I'm going. Far far away I gotta get out. I gotta get out. There's a place beyond this world. Where the mountains meet the sky. It's a different state of mind. Like a dream where you can fly. Can I tell you this in confidence. I need to regain that whole indoor sense. I stop for some breathing space. Divert from the public place. Return to a private place. I know it's the adjusting case. I gotta get out, I gotta get out"

call me old-fashioned,"I have to admit. I'm an absolute shit. But at least you can't call me. a hypocrite. I don't want fame. or the critics' acclaim. Take it from me. that's a pointless game.

How much I earn. and I spend. Call me old-fashioned. and I've been called worse than muck. Call me old-fashioned. but understand. What I've got planned. won't be luck. Sex is fun and sex sells, honey. A shiny dream to make me money. Where the sea is blue, the sky is sunny. Love is hot and suprisingly. Old-fashioned. I'll make love down the phone. Call me tomorrow.

can you forgive her?,"Another night with open eyes. Too late to sleep, too soon to rise. You're short of breath, is it a heart attack?. Hot and feverish you face the fact. You're in love, and it feels like shame. Because she's gone and made a fool of you in public again. You're in love, and it feels like pain. Because you know there's too much truth in everything she claims. So ask yourself now:. Can you forgive her if she wants you to?. Ask yourself: Can you even deliver. What she demands of you?. You drift into the strangest dreams. Of youthful follies and changing teams. Admit you're wrong, oh, no, not yet. Then you wake up and remember that you can't forget. She's made you some kind of laughing stock. Because you dance to disco, and you don't like rock. She'd make fun of you, and even in bed. Said she was gonna go and get herself a real man instead. So ask yourself now:. Can you forgive her if she begs you to?. Ask yourself: Can you even deliver. What she demands of you?. Or do you want revenge?. But that's childish, so childish!. (That's childish, so childish!). Remember when you were more easily led. Behind the cricket pavillion and the bicycle shed. Trembling as your dreams came true. You looked right into those blue eyes and knew. It was love, and now you can't pretend. You've forgotten all the promises of that first friend. It's bad enough, she knows how you feel.

happiness is an option,"It is not easy. It is not easy. Looking from a window. at the back of a house. at the edge of a town. It's grey. like the day. when I lost it. Clouds overhead. I talked to a flower. that was almost dead. My body a prison. why did I do it?. Someone told me not to. but still went through it. It is not easy. but don't give up now. It is not easy. Happiness is an option. Needed somewhere to clear. my head. find some strength. a warmer bed. Maximum love in a. minimal world. I'd never achieved it. but then I believed it. so when I lost it - how?. I'm not sure now -. it was a strange feeling. like a paw repealing itself. It is not easy. But don't give up now. It is not easy. Happiness is an option. It is not easy. But don't give up now. It is not easy. Happiness is an option. I can wake up in the morning. and not believe what I see. Look in the mirror. And think if that's really me. I don't think I suit my face. It's not a catastrophe. it's more a philosophy. like the Russians. wondering why. we're born under a blue sky. but die in a dark forest. It is not easy. but don't give up now. It is not easy. Happiness is an option. It is not easy. but don't give up now. It is not easy. Happiness is an option. This is neither old nor new. It's always, forever. Somewhere between sense. and ambition. pleasure and decision. we have to make a choice. What do we want?. Everyone singing. ""War, what is it good for?"". while planning the next one?. I don't need to win. You don't have to lose. We can choose. Happiness is an option. It is not easy. but don't give up now. It is not easy. Happiness is an option. It is not easy. the war within us. but it gets easier. the more we learn. I don't need to win. You don't need to lose. We can choose. Happiness is an option.

metamorphosis,Please allow me to try and explain. I'm living proof that man can change. I knew what I wanted. I knew how to get it. It didn't make it happy so I started again. What I wanted to be was a family man. but nature had some alternative plans. So I did without the lot put emotion on hold. and hoped my instincts would do what they were told. I wanna know yeah. I wanna know. But every now and then. often at night. a particular feeling would surface in spite. of what I told myself and tried to deny. I kept on asking the question: why?. I wanna know yeah. I wanna know. You grow up and experience this. a total metamorphosis. It's all about change. It's a metamorphosis. With time and age I had to change. 'cause my behaviour was getting strange. People on the street caught my eye. and I began to think I might be their kind of guy. The long-term suppression of an adolescent urge. was in retreat and I was on the verge. of falling in love or having fun. Time was running out. Something had to be done. I wanna know yeah. I wanna know. I wanna know yeah. Tell me what's the reason. Where was I?. Laying down the law. dancing with others. out on the floor. Music and smoke. What did it mean?. Somebody spoke and I went into a dream. I had what I wanted. madly in love. Nothing else mattered. This was enough. Questions were answered. which used to perplex. in particular those about the big s.e.x.. I wanna know yeah. I wanna know. I wanna know yeah. Tell me what's the reason. You grow up and experience this. A total metamorphosis. It's all about love. It's a metamorphosis. Dreaming is easy. life is tough. I got the picture. The most important thing. is not to end up bitter. 'cause when you start to feel. increasingly forlorner. woomph! love comes. right around the corner. It may not last. but here am I. once a caterpillar. now a butterfly. It can seem strange. but when you reminisce. It's all about change. It's a metamorphosis. I wanna know yeah. I wanna know. I wanna know. It's all about love. It's a metamorphosis. You grow up and experience this. A total metamorphosis. It's all about change. It's a metamorphosis. I wanna know yeah. I wanna know. I wanna know yeah. I wanna know. It's all about change. It's a metamorphosis. I wanna know yeah. I wanna know. It's all about love. It's a metamorphosis

miserablism,"It seems to me there's something serious beginning. A new approach found to the meaning of life. Deny that happiness is open as an option. And disappointment disappears over night. Say that love is an impossible dream. Face the facts, that's what it's always been. Relax, what you see is what you've seen. What you get, is a new philosophy. (That's what you got, that's what you get). (That's what you got, that's what you get). Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't. Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't. Meanwhile your life is still directed as a drama. With realism on the sparsest of sets. Every performance tends to reach the same conclusion. No happy endings but a message to depress. Saying life is an impossible scheme. That's the point of this philosophy. Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't. Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't. But if is wasn't, and isn't were. You can't be sure, but you might find ecstasy. (Oh no). Just for the sake of it, make sure you're always frowning. (get get get). It shows the world that you've got substance and depth. You know, life is an impossible scheme. And love an imperceptible dream. (That's what you got, that's what you get). (That's what you got, that's what you get). Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't.

So much time has passed. I'd still meet you anywhere. Water under bridge. Evening after day. What is left of love. Here that didn't drift away?. I can remember days of sun. We knew our lives had just begun. We could do anything, we're fearless when we're young. Under the moon, address unknown. I can remember nights in Rome. I thought that love would last, a promise set in stone. I'd survive with only memories. If I could change the way I feel. But I want more than only memories. A human touch to make them real. Another day, another dream. Over the bridge an empty scene. We'd spend the weekend lost in bed and float upstream. I don't know why we moved away. Lost in the here and now we strayed. Into a New York zone, our promise was betrayed. I was there, caught on Tenth Avenue. You elsewhere with Culver City blues. Then and there I knew that I'd lost you. What is left of love?. Tell me, who will even care?. So much time has passed. I'd still meet you anywhere. Water under bridge. Evening after day. What is left of love. Here that didn't drift away?. Don't give me all your love and pain. Don't sell me New York in the rain. Let's leave our promises behind. Rewind and try again. What remains in time that didn't fade away?. Sometimes I need to see.

I don't want to belong. I dreamt I was back in uniform. And a candidate for examination. History, someone had blundered. And a voice rapped ""knuckle under!"". Living a law just short of delusion.

up against it,News in the city. breaks without pity. Long after the war has ended. we're still in fatigues. Up against it. The higher you fly. the further you fall. Up against it. Wondering why we. fought after all. Such a cold winter. with scenes as slow as Pinter. Synchronise your watches. there's still time to kill. Up against it. Drinking this swill. to sweeten the pill. Up against it. The more that it hurts. the less that it works. Wrapped up in nostalgia. to queue for a show. Back to Trafalgar. one kiss then I'll go. So deep in quicklime. the bones of an old crime. I knew a man who raked them over. He's still suffering. Up against it. Buried so deep. it gives me the creeps. Up against it. The longer you hate. the more that it grates. Up against it. Look left then right. and run for your life. Up against it. The more that it hurts. the less that it works

I used to roll the dice. Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes. Listen as the crowd would sing. ""Now the old king is dead, long live the king"". One minute I held the key. Next the walls were closed on me. Now I discovered that my castles stand. Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand. I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'. Roman cavalry choirs are singin'. Be my mirror, my sword and shield. My missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain. I know St. Peter won't call my name. Never an honest word. And that was when I ruled the world. It was a wicked and wild wind. Blew the doors to let me in. Shattered windows and the sound of drums. People couldn't believe what I'd become. Revolutionaries wait. For my head on a silver plate. Just a puppet on a lonely string. Oh, who would ever want to be king?. I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'. Roman cavalry choirs are singin'. Be my mirror, my sword and shield.

So vulnerable without you. I know the assumption is that I'm tough. With all my anger, that's fair enough. Even with friends I have to compete. and try being mean when you walk down the street.

You may think I'm strong and I can do no wrong but I'm vulnerable. So vulnerable without you. I may be hard to take but you can call me fake 'cause I'm vulnerable. So vulnerable without you. At night I am lying awake. through the hours, trying to calculate. Am I good enough, can I contrive. to keep this show on the road, will I survive?. I know you must sometimes think I don't care. or even appreciate what we share. Though I'm no-one's stepping stone. The truth is I love you, and I'd go crazy alone.

I can't take my eyes off of you. Love you baby. Let me love you. Where the streets have no name. Where the streets have no name. Where the streets have no name. Where the streets have no name.

"yesterday, when i was mad","Darling, you were wonderful, you really were quite good. I enjoyed that, though, of course, no one understood. A word of what was going on, they didn't have a clue.

Admitting, I don't believe. In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me. You have a certain quality, which really is unique. Expressionless, such irony, although your voice is weak. It doesn't really matter 'cause the music is so loud. Of course it's all on tape, but no one will find out. You hated me too. But not as much as I hated you. Yesterday, when I was mad. And quite prepared to give up everything. Admitting, I don't believe. In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me. Then, when I was lonely. I thought again. And changed my mind. Then we posed for pictures with the competition winners. And argued about the hotel rooms, and where to go for dinner. And someone said: ""It's fabulous you're still around today,. You've both made such a little go a very long way"". Yesterday, when I was mad. And quite prepared to give up everything. Admitting, I don't believe.

Goodbye, shake hands. Like you did everything correctly. To wipe away the tears. No more pain, no fear. No sorrow or dying. No waiting or crying. These former things have passed away. Another life begins today"
