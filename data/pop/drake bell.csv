The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. She's the girl I'd stay home for. If I had the courage I'd ring her bell. But if she answered what story would I tell. My window's become her picture frame. But this painting doesn't even have a name. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. She's the girl I'd stay home for.

Singing, 'Dig Down Deep'. 'Cause if you wanna go to Heaven all you gotta do is pay to pray. Joining a fan club with my pen. Filling my bathtub with holy water and amens. He looks so dreamy, I'm in love from afar. When I'm pickin' up a fallen star. Shake that woody, shake it for me, St. Pinocchio. You've paid your money, now watch that money grow. Joining a fan club, best be warned. He turns me on when he wears that lampshade crown of thorns. We'd be so dreamy, sharing his black caviar. While I'm pickin' up a fallen star. Joining a fan club is a big mistake. I still get heartburn when I think about all of the stamps I ate. I wished I'd loved him, before fate crashed his car. Say a prayer for the fallen star..

leave it all behind,Until all the things I feel. Replace all the things you did. I will remain a stranger. In every place you hid. Don't ask me to be your hero. Those stories are never real. And if I fall from danger. Too close to the way I feel. I feel what I used to fear. I know what I need to hear. I can't keep wasting time. Why can't we just leave it all behind. The things it takes to make up. May seem to bring me down. It's not that I don't want you. You're someone like me around. I feel what I used to fear. I know what I need to hear. I can't keep wasting time. Why can't we just leave it all behind. I wonder if you know. The truth is far too cold. But if I could frame your soul. I'd never let go. I feel what I used to fear. I know what I need to hear. I can't keep wasting time. Why can't we just leave it all. Why can't we just leave it all. Why can't we just leave it all behind. By larita bell

And once you've seen what they have been. To win the earth just won't seem worth. Your night or your day. Who'll hear what I say.. Open up the broken cup. Let goodly sin and sunshine in. Yes that's today.. And open wide the hymns you hide. You find reknown while people frown. At things that you say. But say what you'll say. About the farmers and the fun.

girl next door,She may not be Marilyn Monroe. And she may not be the cutest girl I know. It's how she makes me feel not how she looks. One smile from her heart. That's all it took. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. She's the girl I'd stay home for. If I had the courage I'd ring her bell. But if she answered what story would I tell. My window's become her picture frame. But this painting doesn't even have a name. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. She's the girl I'd stay home for. She doesn't know that I'm breathing. She doesn't know that I'm alive. She doesn't know what I'm dreaming. When I see that she's turned out her lights. And does she see me like I see her. More than just the boy next door. More than just the boy next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. She doesn't know that I'm alive
give me a little more time,"Another drink another roller dice. Another night I paid the price. And too many times I turned way good advice. Give me just a little more time. I fell in love only once in my life. We'd never fight, well maybe once or twice. Then he came along now this whiskey is my wife. Give me just little more time. All my regrets carry weight. I'm broke and tired of losing my faith. Lit cigarette with her lipstick stain. Whispering sadly to me. All my regrets carry weight. I'm broke and tired of losing my faith.

Looking over the streets in the movies. Just like the pictures that you get in the post. Only scenes are a little more two dimensional. Just like a glossy kind almost. I never met a dream. A dream that wasn't broken. You never heard of one that did not come true. Promise is a word. Merely spoken. Not a hope to be held on to. Say hello to the hills of Hollywood. Send my love to Sunset Strip. Tell them I'm, I'm coming back again. To renew and earn my membership. The TV guide. A new found tomorrow. Only saw what it is we should be. Give me a saddle. And lifestyles to borrow. Those silver selling saviors and MTV. Beautiful boys and gorgeous girls on the Boulevard. Everyone's a star just waiting to shine. Sometimes glittering gets to be too hard. It's just another face on Hollywood and Vine. Say hello to the hills of Hollywood. Send my love to Sunset Strip. Tell them I'm, I'm coming back again. To renew and earn my membership.

joining a fan club,"She turned the night light on and blew him a kiss. He stared back through his green Crayola eyes. She traced his likeness from off the back of a disc. Next to the boxtop promise of the biggest prize. Joining a fan club with my friends. Filling our bathtubs with teeshirts and 8 x 10's. He looks so dreamy, I'm in love from afar. When I'm pickin' up a fallen star. Downstairs the late show's blastin' 'Age of the rock'. Greedy monks playin' last Sunday at the Milky Way. Mom's writing checks to the minister in the corner. Singing, 'Dig Down Deep'. 'Cause if you wanna go to Heaven all you gotta do is pay to pray. Joining a fan club with my pen. Filling my bathtub with holy water and amens. He looks so dreamy, I'm in love from afar. When I'm pickin' up a fallen star. Shake that woody, shake it for me, St. Pinocchio. You've paid your money, now watch that money grow. Joining a fan club, best be warned. He turns me on when he wears that lampshade crown of thorns. We'd be so dreamy, sharing his black caviar. While I'm pickin' up a fallen star. Joining a fan club is a big mistake. I still get heartburn when I think about all of the stamps I ate. I wished I'd loved him, before fate crashed his car. Say a prayer for the fallen star..

leave it all behind,Until all the things I feel. Replace all the things you did. I will remain a stranger. In every place you hid. Don't ask me to be your hero. Those stories are never real. And if I fall from danger. Too close to the way I feel. I feel what I used to fear. I know what I need to hear. I can't keep wasting time. Why can't we just leave it all behind. The things it takes to make up. May seem to bring me down. It's not that I don't want you. You're someone like me around. I feel what I used to fear. I know what I need to hear. I can't keep wasting time. Why can't we just leave it all behind. I wonder if you know. The truth is far too cold. But if I could frame your soul. I'd never let go. I feel what I used to fear. I know what I need to hear. I can't keep wasting time. Why can't we just leave it all. Why can't we just leave it all. Why can't we just leave it all behind. By larita bell

And when you carry weight in your life (life). And all the plans you make in your life (life). The original decision was right. *Chorus*. She falls to her knees. Screaming God please.

(Pré refrão). Now I'm back in L.A. Did I make a mistake?. Is it how you planned?. Do you have a new man?. In the palm of your hand?. Did I give you away?. (Refrão). And it's so unbelievable!. So unbelievable. I won't believe it, until you tell me,. It's so unbelievable, so unbelievable,. I won't believe it, until you tell me yourself. I wasted everyday. You thought that I could change. Strange,. I really didn't think so. They said you'd be coming back. I smiled when they told me that. But you know,. I really didn't think so. Now I'm back in L.A. And I'm over my head. Face down in my bed. This is not what I planned. And I don't understand. Why I gave you away. (CHORUS). So tell me that you'll let me know. Then if I love you I'll let you go. ‘Cuz I could never believe you could leave. Until you tell me yourself. I don't think so.... (Refrão) 3x. . Lucas P. Resende"
up periscope,"If I could have a single wish. I'd only wish. I never missed it when you. wake up and smile. It makes me happy. when you steal a little kiss. before you wake me up to. listen to the news for awhile. And when you're. creeping out of bed. I sneak a peek to see just. what you were wearing last night. Or what was left over from. ripping off your clothes. I check to see the door was closed. as you were turning out the lights. Whoever said romance was over. Roll over. So I can show you. Don't you want me to be. The captain of your submarine. Up periscope. that's what I said. and that's just my way. of saying that I love you (I do). Life is like a bowl of cherries. Not so very ordinary. Overflowing with love,. And I could never want for more. unless our two become a four. or maybe three. if we had practice it enough.. Whoever said romance was over, roll over. so I can show you. don't you want me to be the captain of your submarine. up periscope. that's what I say. and that's just my way. of saying that I love you (I love you). Well I know that life is hard. I know that love can break your heart. That's just the way that it is. Well baby that's a load of smack. Don't you know I've got your back. What's important is the way that we live. And like that way you like this song. because it makes you hum along. and tap your foot to the beat. Well that's the way. you make me feel. when we're doing it for real. I can feel it from my head to my feet. Whoever said romance was over, roll over. so I can give you. one more chance to believe. and hopefully see. that I still want you. don't you want me to be the captain. of your submarine. up periscope. that's what I say. And that's just my way. Of saying that I love you. I love you. by Alice Petry"

wrong side of the sun,It's just another day. Like any other day. Til I opened up the shades. And it was black as night. And I don't know what I've done. But I woke up on the wrong side of the sun. Was it something that I said. Something that I did. That got inside your head. Made you walk away. 'Cause I don't know what I've done. But I woke up on the wrong side of the sun. I still don't have a reason. And I hope that I'm dreamin'. 'Cause it looks like you're leavin' me now. My world won't stop turnin'. And left me here learnin'. To live with the darknes I've found. Must be some mistake. This isn't how it ends. My heart's not supposed to break. Someone shed some light. 'Cause I don't know what I've done. But I woke up on the wrong side of the sun. I still don't have a reason. And I hope that I'm dreamin'. 'Cause it looks like you're leavin' me now. My world won't stop turnin'. And left me here learnin'. To live with the darkness I've found. It's just another day. Like any other day. Til I opened up the shades. Whoa. Don't know what I've done. But I woke up on the wrong side of the sun. Mmhmm. And I don't know what I've done. But I woke up on the wrong side of the sun. Don't know what I've done. But I woke up on the wrong side of the sun. And I don't know what I've done. But I woke up on the wrong side of the sun. Yeah
yesterday's fool,Driving back from God knows when. How'd you stay so long in Bloomington ?. Trying to see what it is about him. Then you find you're on your own. Trying to find a place to hang your coat. Can't you see that all your birds have flown away ?. Yesterday's Fool. Comes running back to you. Yesterday's﻿ Fool. Trying to play it cool. Dropping out of school. Breaking all the rules. But who is fooling who ?﻿. Patterns never seem to change. Same old heartache by a﻿ different name. You start out happy but when it all falls down again. You can come and cry to me. That's not the way that it's supposed to be. Tell me when you'll finally see that I am. Yesterday's Fool. Comes running back to you. Yesterday's Fool. Trying to play it cool. Dropping out﻿ of school. Breaking all the rules. But who is fooling who ?
you're not thinking,"You showed up with your head in your hands. You said I'm the only one that ever really understands you. That's not true. So take my hands and wipe away your tears. Whispering ""Will it be okay if I stay here?"". And I want you to. (pré-refrão). Dm. But I know, it's just a moment. You're gonna run while the moon's still shining. And you can't hide it, oh oh oh. (refrão). Please, please, please don't go and give me those. Eye, eye, eyes, I can even see that you're not thinking. You're not thinking. So please, please, please, you gotta let me go. You, you, you, you don't even know you're not thinking. You're not thinking about me. Now I got these pictures in my head. Dancing to the words I never said. But I want to, yeah I have to. You wore a white dress with yellow lace. On the night you leaned in and kissed my face. Remember? I remember. (pré-refrão). I should have known, it's just a moment. You're gonna run while the moon's still shining. And I can't fight it, oh oh oh. (refrão). Please, please, please don't go and give me those. Eye, eye, eyes, I can even see that you're not thinking. You're not thinking. So please, please, please, you gotta let me go. You, you, you, you don't even know you're not thinking. You're not thinking about me. Maybe it's time, I stopped crossing these lines. I can't seem to draw. But baby it's hard, and I wanna go on. If this is nothing at all. (refrão). Please, please, please don't go and give me those. Eye, eye, eyes. Please, please, please don't go and give me those. Eye, eye, eyes, I can even see that you're not thinking. You're not thinking. So please, please, please, you gotta let me go.
