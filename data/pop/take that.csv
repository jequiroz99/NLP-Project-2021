back for good,"I guess now it's time for me to give up. I feel it's time. Got a picture of you beside me. Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup. Got a fist of pure emotion. Got a head of shattered dreams. Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now. Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it. I just want you back for good. Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it. You'll be right and understood. Unaware but underlined I figured out the story. It wasn't good. But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory. But that was not to be. In the twist of separation you excelled at being free. Can't you find a little room inside for me. Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it. I just want you back for good. Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it. You'll be right and understood. And we'll be together, this time is forever. We'll be fighting and forever we will be. So complete in our love. We will never be uncovered again"
how deep is your love?,And when you rise in the morning sun. I feel your touch my hand in the pouring rain. And the moment that you wander far from me. I wanna feel you in my arms again. And you come to me on the summer breeze. Keep me warm in your love then you softly leave. Chorus:. And it's me you need to show. How deep is your love?. How deep is your love?. How deep is your love?. I really need to learn. 'Cause we're living in a world of fools. Breaking us down. When they all should let us be. We belong to you and me. I believe in you. You know you're the door to my very soul. You are the light in my deepest darkest hour. And you are my saviour when I fall. And you may not think. That I care for you. When you know down inside that I really do. (Repeat Chorus). You are the light. And you may not think. That I care for you. When you know down inside that I really do. (Repeat Chorus).

On the pavement, in the park. We are giants, can you feel it. So much bigger than we thought. I think I might be heading out of body. I've gotta love, you've gotta love somebody. When I look in your eyes. I'm bigger than the night sky. As high as the sun, high as a storm. We are giants, we are giants. We are giants. There are giants across the water.

nobody else,"Making my way through old photographs. Of the night when you first stood by my side. Old friends with smiles some are here some are gone. Good memories of our senior high. Looking back we're the only couple still together. Even then I knew this love would be forever, I knew. Coz there's nobody else in this world that could love you. Any more than I do, always here for you. Nobody else in this world could love you more. Nobody could love you any more than I do. I'm still here for you. Our lives have all changed we've some a long way. Our faces show the lines of two young sons. And in their houses there will be pictures. Like the ones of you and me. Hope they can look back and smile just like we have done. Never once have I ever felt the need for another. We were strong and survived the storm in time to discover. To discover one another. (chorus). All of the smiles we have won. Jjust from looking back and reliving all the good times. And when we've been through all the pages. We just start again, we just start again, oh. (chorus)"
eight letters,We became the parade on the streets that we once cleaned. Expendable soldiers smiling at anything. Raised on a feeling our lives would have meaning eventually. We were once the answer and then you discover. You’re actually just one thing after another. And what was the question?. And why was the lesson so deafening?. This is all that matters now. And that was all that happened anyhow. You can look back but don’t stare. Maybe I can love you out of there. And when I went away. What I forgot to say. Was all I had to say. Eight letters three words one meaning. And outside forces didn’t make it easy. So I thought I’d go before you leave me. Self preservation was no explanation for anything. Oh but the truth is more than we’ll ever comprehend. I’m just starting to understand my friend. All of that distance. Cos I fell in love with the enemy. But this is all that matters now. And that was all that happened anyhow. You can look back but don’t stare. Maybe I can love you out of there. And when I went away. What I forgot to say. Was all I had to say. Eight letters three words one meaning. And when I went away. What I forgot to say. Was all I had to say. Eight letters three words one meaning. At last we meet on no man’s land. Just footprints in the sand. We meet on no man’s land. At last. And when I went away. What I forgot to say. Was all I had to say. Eight letters three words one meaning. And when I went away. What I forgot to say. Was all I had to say. Eight letters three words one meaning. One meaning. Just one meaning.. Uploaded by Hagentx.

Been standing here for days,and days. Chorus:. Said it all. Nothing to say it all. Nothing to say that matters. Haven't we heard enough?. Said it all. Nothing to say it all. Nothing to say that matters. Doesn't matter anymore. In the sudden light of day. The weight of expectation. Hurt begins to fade. As you find a new direction.

84,"84 was a pretty good year. I lost my heart back then in 1984. It was 1984 and I was nearly 16 years. Oh Thatcher was the minister in charge. Oh the miners were on strike. And my dad had gone away. And the Swiss were riding high up in the charts. It was there on Gordod Road. While I was waiting in the cold. For my mate when you came along.

When she took me by the hand up to her room. There were posters on her wall. I saw flowers in her hair. But I never got the chance to see them bloom. 'Cause the clock stopped. And the years rolled by. But the time never left my mind. When she said. Chorus. Twenty-four years later. And we're in the hands of labour. and we've got ten thousand troops out in Iraq. I am living now in London. And at present I am single. And in somewhere died along since you come back. 84 was a pretty good year. I lost my heart back then in 1984. Was a pretty good year.

another crack in my heart,"I am just one man with his one pair of eyes. I dress in normal clothes and I don't try to disguise. I'm looking out for love however it may seem. I never do return in the always winning team. Maybe I should try to live alone,. Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown. Maybe I should run and hide away. Until another day. Another crack in my heart,. Another picture on the wall. Another way to spend an evening. When there's no one there at all. Another kiss to say goodbye,. Another cross upon a chart. Another suitcase at the door. Another crack in my heart. In my heart. I had my spills and thrills of love. And held it in my hand. I held on tight until it broke. And I crashed to the ground. Love cannot be on my side. It's clearer every dull. That every time I reach for love. It always runs away. Maybe I should try to live alone,. Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown. Maybe I should run and hide away. Until another day. Another crack in my heart,. Another picture on the wall. Another way to spend an evening. When there's no one there at all. Another kiss to say goodbye,. Another cross upon a chart. Another suitcase at the door. Another crack in my heart. In my heart."

eight letters,We became the parade on the streets that we once cleaned. Expendable soldiers smiling at anything. Raised on a feeling our lives would have meaning eventually. We were once the answer and then you discover. You’re actually just one thing after another. And what was the question?. And why was the lesson so deafening?. This is all that matters now. And that was all that happened anyhow. You can look back but don’t stare. Maybe I can love you out of there. And when I went away. What I forgot to say. Was all I had to say. Eight letters three words one meaning. And outside forces didn’t make it easy. So I thought I’d go before you leave me. Self preservation was no explanation for anything. Oh but the truth is more than we’ll ever comprehend. I’m just starting to understand my friend. All of that distance. Cos I fell in love with the enemy. But this is all that matters now. And that was all that happened anyhow. You can look back but don’t stare. Maybe I can love you out of there. And when I went away. What I forgot to say. Was all I had to say. Eight letters three words one meaning. And when I went away. What I forgot to say. Was all I had to say. Eight letters three words one meaning. At last we meet on no man’s land. Just footprints in the sand. We meet on no man’s land. At last. And when I went away. What I forgot to say. Was all I had to say. Eight letters three words one meaning. And when I went away. What I forgot to say. Was all I had to say. Eight letters three words one meaning. One meaning. Just one meaning.. Uploaded by Hagentx.

Where'd it go?. Where did you go?. It started on a Friday night. We were runnin' wild. We were flyin' high. Searchin' for the time of our lives. Everywhere we go. But never goin' home. And every tear we ever cried. Keeps the rivers of our lives. Flowin' back to me. (Flowin' back to me). And every thought we ever had. Every word we ever said. Is comin' back to me. And you know.

every revolution,"I can still believe the sky. Isn't rolling through the night. While I sleep fast like a stone. And the crowd we're standing on. Is what we fix ourselves upon. Go on, you can't change what you know. There were chances left untaken. Lost diversions in the road. And far off islands in the sea. A house of flowers. A chapter and a verse. A sheet of white where we all shared our dreams. And we turn every revolution. Every revolution bringing us symphonies. Take a breath and count our lucky days. Hold me here with every revolution. Pulling together now. There's a brand new life in my soul. Now there's water in the well. And the ring has found a bell. To tell the world we're not alone. From the silent sky a plane arrives. I feel like I've been waiting all my life. To welcome you back home. There's a wave coming in to break. The tension as we crash upon the beach. Up ahead the blanket full of stars. A pencil sketch to lie down underneath. And we turn every revolution. Every revolution bringing us symphonies. Take a breath and count our lucky days. Hold me here with every revolution. Pulling together now. There's a brand new life in my soul. And we turn every revolution. Every revolution bringing us symphonies. Take a breath and count our lucky days. Hold me here with every revolution. Pulling together now. There's a brand new life in my soul"

hanging onto your love,"Can we talk, throughout the night I need you so bad. And when we talk can you understand my feelings. And understand it hurts to be without you. Never prepared, never know what's going wrong. I'm losing though I always thought this love was so strong. So alone, so lost in the dark. So sad coz you will always have a place in my heart. Hangin onto your love. Hangin onto your love. Hangin onto your love. Hangin onto your love, I need it. Let's take a walk and reminisce about. The feelings we used to feel. Just say the word and I'll be back for good my baby. I'll be back to give you girl what you deserve. Did I say too much, did I try to rule your life. Did the love we had between us. Miss the road to paradise. Can we try again, can we chance it one more time. Can the ecstacy we found her. Be re-claimed as yours and mine. (chorus)."
happy now,"I get the feeling that we are being lied to. There’s a surge in my psychosis every turn of the screw. And I’m half awake in paisley print. I can see the world clearly but I have to squint. I am a supersonic specimen. A minor miracle of medicine. I’m at the mercy of unwanted emotions. Where nothing matters. Beneath my thoughts. Beneath my thoughts is where it happens. Super heavy elements. Embrace me. Super heavy elements. Replace me. Was it a positive experiment. To be indefinitely decadent. And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope. That there was no truth to what was wrote. Give me half as much but twice as fast or today. Might slip away. I feel myself falling…I’m feeling happy now. I feel myself falling…I’m feeling happy now. I feel myself falling…I’m feeling happy now. I feel myself falling…I’m feeling happy now, feeling happy now. I’m at the back of the club and so afraid to speak. Cos I’m not like these people and these people are not like me. Super heavy elements. Upgrade me. Supersonic elements. Amaze me. Your opinion is irrelevant. I was built to be magnificent. And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope. That there was no truth to what was wrote. Give me half as much but twice as fast or today. Might slip away. I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now. I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now. I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now. I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now, feeling happy now. I haven’t scratched the surface of my desire. In the world of dreams I’m a frequent flyer. Super heavy elements. Embrace me. Super heavy elements. I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now. I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now. I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now. I’m feeling immortal… we'll live forever now.. Uploaded by Hagentx."

Still wide awake and feeling cheated. From a girl I thought was treating me right. Hate it but I love her. Hate it but I want her. Feeling like I need her. Our love, our love was true.

hold on,"We've been here many times before. Leaving rooms and slamming doors. We're climbing up the bedroom walls. Sometimes we make it so frustrating. I touch your mouth, I touch your lips.

Just hold on to me. I don't wanna see you crying. So hold on. So hold on to me. I'm tryin' to think of what to do. To really make it up to you. So many truths, too many lies.

There are no words that say, no words. To make it go away. I don't wanna see you hurting. Just hold on. Just hold on to me. I don't wanna see you crying. So hold on. So hold on to me.

hold up a light,"You can dance if you like. You can sing every line of every song. No,you don't have to steal the show. It was your show all along. As the orchestra plays the people take the seats.

I'll be watching you,everything that you do. As we start rehearsing every scene,the words to everything. We realise that the crowd is listening. And then the tears fall down on your face at exactly the right place. As the people start to stand up in the aisles. You can hear the sound of violins on every street tonight. You can see all lovers dancing round. I'll be watching. Hold up a light for me (x4), oh. And I'll be watching. Hold up a light for me (x4), oh. And I'll be watching you.

holding back the tears,"I kind of keep asking myself little questions. Like where do I go from here. I seem to keep losing track of time and how long it's been. Since I last had you near. Been a painful road to a door that's closed. Been a gamble that I knew I couldn't win. Been a lonely conversation to this photograph of you. In the mirror there's a sign I must give in. So I'm not holding back the tears anymore. Tryin' to escape the heartache, tryin' to escape emotion. No I'm not holding back the tears anymore. Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time. I depended on you. I used to enjoy spending time on my own here. Watching the jaded people pass. Now here I am sharing their pain and their lonely tears. And walking a road of broken glass. It's a constant fight to get through each day and night. It's a war between the present and the past. And the face that's in your mind every time you close your eyes. What's the reason, what's the answer, how long will this last. So I'm not holding back the tears anymore. Tryin' to escape the heartache, tryin' to escape emotion. No I'm not holding back the tears anymore. Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time. I depended on you. Been a long, long time since I heard your last goodbye. Still I hear it clearly every day and night. What's the point in love when you have to give it up. Yet still you need it, and it's nowhere you can find"
hope,"Learn from every lesson. Face the lonely fear. Imagine that the tightrope was here. There's angels in the silence. The taste of your own tears. Is cold.

And dream. Everybody needs a little hope, hope, hope. Hope, hope, hope. Hope, hope, hope. The stars are us. Light up, light up. Oh, the stars, they are us. Just look up. Look up.

how can it be,"It's funny how your life can change. Memories of love remain, inside your heart for all this time. At last you find a different road and suddenly you're not alone. A game of love rests upon your mind........ I could feel, the love like steel. It's like a sense you have inside, you never knew. How can it be. That you love me. All that I've seen. Who really want your love and all. How can it be. That you and me. So desperately need each other every day. And what does it mean that you want me. Now it's for real today. At time it's easy to forget. All the things you once regret and. never learn to pay the price. Some day the rain will fall within. Remember face it don't give in. And watch the bad times pass you by. I could feel, the love like steel. It's like a sense you have inside, you never knew. How can it be. That you love me. All that I've seen. Who really want your love and ohh. How can it be. That you and me. So desperately need each other every day. And what does it mean that you want me. Now it's for real today."
how deep is your love?,And when you rise in the morning sun. I feel your touch my hand in the pouring rain. And the moment that you wander far from me. I wanna feel you in my arms again.

How deep is your love?. I really need to learn. 'Cause we're living in a world of fools. Breaking us down. When they all should let us be. We belong to you and me. I believe in you. You know you're the door to my very soul. You are the light in my deepest darkest hour. And you are my saviour when I fall. And you may not think. That I care for you. When you know down inside that I really do. (Repeat Chorus). You are the light. And you may not think. That I care for you. When you know down inside that I really do. (Repeat Chorus).

Seems like yesterday I was lost. How I give you my love. No matter the cost. You are my love of all loves. All I hope from you. Just to love me as I love you. When I hold you so very tight. I know I will try with all my might. To keep this love alive. I hope someday you will let me. Hold and keep and make you my wife. ""I love you"""

mancunian way,"Mancunian Way\"". We used to walk Mancunian Way. We used to swagger we used to sway. Up until the lights took us away. Do you know what you meant to me?. We used to think we were the bomb. Then someone left a real one. We stayed indoors as the rain come. Back then it made no sense to me. I\'m missing you face, your beautiful face. It\'s funny that I reall they gave us the keys to the cit, but they don\'t fit anything. But I\'m coming away.. I hear you calling. I came back running. Forgot that feeling. Been so log coming. They tried to stop her. She just got stronger. I\'m driving home again. Back down Mancunian Way. I just forgot how it is to feel. To dance and move and keep it real. Been lying down fot ten long years. But I was there and it feels like yesterday. I\'m missing you face, your beautiful face. It\'s funny that I recall you came when I was pretty, but that don\'t work no more. But I\'m coming anyway.. Now I stand here in front of you. I know now what I\'m gonna do. My shoulders low, but my head is high. I\'m gonna bring this town alive. Through this acidic rain. I\'m gonna come back to life again."

You never worry about me. Why should I ned you,. Why don't I let you go?. And let my heartaches run free. I thought I knew the meaning of life. Now I'm asking you why. I thought I knew the meaning of life. now open wide. What's on my mind, so many questions. Though the answers I can guess. You slip away shelter from confrontation. Look my life is such a mess.

never forget,"We´ve come so far. and we´re reached so high. and we´re looked each day. and night in the eye. and we´re still so young. and we hope for more. We've come a long way. but we´ve not to sure. where we´ve been. We've had success. We've had good times. But remember this. Been on this path of life for so long. Feel I've walked a thousand miles. Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love. Everybody's been there. With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of. hope. I knew I could make it. Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds. and saw. My face in the moonlight. Just then I realised what a fool I could be. Just coz I look so high I don't have to see me. Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still. There's a road going down the other side of this hill. Never forget where you've coming from. Never pretend that it's all real. Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream. Been safe from the arms of disappointment for so long. Feel each day we've come too far. Yet each day seems to make much more. Sure is good to be here. I understand the meaning of ""I can't explain this. feeling"". Now it feels so unreal. At night I see the hand that reminds meof the stand I. make. The fact of reality. (chorus). We've come so far, and we've reached so high. And we've looked each day and night in the eye. And we're still so young and we hope for more. But remember this.

'Cause I never wanna let me go. Dreaming soft in silence, been working hard all day. Still in the night grows darker, I'm with you in every way. CHORUS. I don't know whether I'm trying to love, love you baby. Been round long enough to know."

nobody else,"Making my way through old photographs. Of the night when you first stood by my side. Old friends with smiles some are here some are gone. Good memories of our senior high. Looking back we're the only couple still together. Even then I knew this love would be forever, I knew. Coz there's nobody else in this world that could love you. Any more than I do, always here for you. Nobody else in this world could love you more. Nobody could love you any more than I do. I'm still here for you. Our lives have all changed we've some a long way. Our faces show the lines of two young sons. And in their houses there will be pictures. Like the ones of you and me. Hope they can look back and smile just like we have done. Never once have I ever felt the need for another. We were strong and survived the storm in time to discover. To discover one another. (chorus). All of the smiles we have won. Jjust from looking back and reliving all the good times. And when we've been through all the pages. We just start again, we just start again, oh. (chorus)"
once you've tasted love,"(Love. Once you've tasted love) x 4. Don't be sold a dream. Remember how the past has been. Don't be led to believe thias one's for you. Calculate your needs. I see there's room to plant your seeds. Don't decide till you see how the others have grown. Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining of a new world. Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in. Once you've tasted love. Still too early to know. Give them time and they will grow. Don't believe that the first's the one for you. Most will grow to be tall, others will break and fall. Keep your eye on the strongest head of them all. Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining of a new world. Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining. Your head is spinning. Once you've tasted love. Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining of a new world. Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in. Can't control your mind and your head is still spinning. Once you've tasted love is just the beggining. Once you've tasted love. Once you've tasted love, you know is good. Come taste my love. You know you should. RAP:. Came into my world and the badness dissapeared. Take my hand, don't be afraid, I'm gonna work off all your fears. It feels so nice to be with you. Us two, we feel like a glove. When I see your eyes I realise you too have tasted love. Once you've tasted love, you know it's good. Come taste my love."

pray,When the time comes near. For me to show my love. The longer I stayed away for. Hiding from a world I need to hear now. Don't think I'll hear it again. But the nights were always warm with you. Holding you right by my side. But the morning always comes too soon. Before I even close my eyes. CHORUS. All I do each night is pray. Hoping that I'll be a part of you again some day. All I do each night is think. Of all the times i closed the door to keep my love within. If you can't forgive the past. I'll understand that. Can't understand why I did this to you. And all of the days and the nights so I regret it. I never showed you my love. But the nights were always warm with you. Holding you right by my side. But the morning always comes too soon. Before I even close my eyes. REPEAT CHORUS. Surely we must be in sight. Of the dream we long to live. If you stop and close your eyes. You'll picture me inside. I'm so cold and all alone. Straight on back to me. REPEAT CHORUS. Come on. Time is running out. You and me. Harmony. You and me....

the day after tomorrow,"Only one way to describe, this is deceit I am hiding. Never been here before, never wanna see here again. I've strayed from a long-term lover. And found greater lust from another. My conscience is keeping me awake and shouting at me all night. So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today. So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late. Being loved is a big responsibility. You can never give too much back. You know it's so easy to walk away and leave that little lady flat. My life's feeling crowded with possessions, am I lucky or sad. Is it time to turn away and lose everything I had. Moving in circles, decisions chasing me round and round. Why's life never easy, or do we make it hard for ourselves. And when we find love, we need to look for something new. 'Cos when it's all over you always feel the need to be loved. Like she used to love you."
the day the work is done,"When all the work is done. The work is done. A place for everything 'til everything is in it's place. And every setting sun. When the work was done.

Manufacture for the human race. The greatest story that was ever told in the lights of history. Was the grand designs of other men. And they built those walls for you and me. So don't start thinking we can start again. Start a riot in the streets my friend. Or they'll start pulling us apart again. Cos idle hands make idle men. Don't start thinking with your heart again. Cos idle hands make idle men. When the work is done, the work is done. We'll bebionic and beyond the circuits of our minds. We'll get nothing done under electric sun. Leave the weight of labour far behind. We're the greatest story that was ever told. But we don't know where we're from. And the walls became but a memory. Of the days when all the work begun. So don't start thinking we can start again. Start a riot in the streets my friend. Or they'll start pulling us apart again. Cos idle hands make idle men. Rejoice the day, the day the work is done. Rejoice the day, the day the work is done. Everybody's counting hours. Everybody's counting hours. 'Til the day the work is done. 'Til the day the work is done.

the flood,"Standing on the edge of forever. At the start of whatever. Shouting love at the World.. Laughing we were like cavemen. But we met the moon and the stars. Then we forgave them. We will meet you where the lights are. The defenders of the faith we are. Where the thunder turns around. They'll run so hard we'll tear the ground away. You know no-one dies in these love drowned eyes. Through our love drowned eyes. We'll watch you sleep tonight. Although no-one understood. We were holding back the flood. Learning how to dance the rain.. We were holding back the flood. They said we'd never dance again. Breathin' but none of us leavin'. Wash your mouth son or you'll find yourself floatin' home. Here we come now on a dark star. Seeing demons not what we are. Tiny minds and eager hands will try to strike. But now we'll last the day. There's progress now where there once was not. Where there once was not. Then everything came along.. Although no-one understood. We were holding back the flood. Learning how to dance the rain.. There was more of them than us. Now they'll never dance again. Although no-one understood. There was more of them than us. Learning how to dance the rain.. We were holding back the flood. They said we'd never dance again.

the garden,"And the fishermen came back across the water. And the people started running in the park. And the city stopped, as I held you in my arms. We could hear the sound of sirens all around us. And the scent of burning oil was in the air. And the music played. And it felt so good to hear. This is the life we've been given. So open your mind and start living. We can play a part if we only start believing. There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking. As the tear from every cloud begin to fall. For one moment then, we understood it all. Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming. Everyone, everyone, every man and every women. We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter. So come on, let me love you. This is the life we've been given. So open your mind and start living. We can play a part if we only start believing. This is the life we've been given. So open your heart and start loving. We can make a start if we only learn to listen. Then the crowd began to head for the horizon. A million people walking back to work. But you and me, we just lay down in the garden. Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden. This is the life we've been given. So open your heart and start loving. We can make a start if we only learn to listen. You and me, we just lay down in the garden. Yeah, the garden"
the last poet,"If I was the last poet left on Earth. Known by all as man of words. If was the last poet heard by all. They would watch as the silence roars. Got my hands up. Gotta stand up. But for you I can't find words. But for you I can't find words. With a broken feather and unused ink. Going crazy trying to translate what I think. When we see something so beautiful. A monastery of light and soul. Stand taller than the high cathedral walls. Got my hands up. Gotta stand up. But for you I can't find words. But for you I can't find words. But for you I can't find words. But for you there are no words. Last poet, last man in this century. To lay down with no sympathy. To put words where they shouldn't be.

No more dancing on this floor. Oh no. So long. Just throwing stones. Chorus:. The only one I ever loved is the one I lost today. The only one I ever loved is the one I threw away. She's gone. With no warning. She's made her decision. She's walking the road. Now she's gone. I'm here on my own. In this place. With the ghost of reflection. With the thoughs of a cruel blow. Throwing stones. Oh no. So long. Chorus. She's gone (she's gone). She's gone (she's gone). Taken all the sentiment with her. She's gone (she's gone). She's gone (she's gone). I saw a look upon her face.

today i've lost you,"Driving home in my car, nearly midnight. Rain on the road in my view. Holding my heart, it’s the first night without you. On my clothes I still smell your perfume. Should have called. When I left you were crying. Is it too late to apologise. From talking to fighting, admitting, denying. To finally saying goodbye. Now I regret every word that was spoken. I said some things you know I didn’t mean. Maybe we’ll turn back the time. Work it out, start anew. Oh maybe today I’ve lost you. I can’t help but think of our last conversation. I close my eyes I can still see your face. I hope what I’m feeling now. You are feeling it too. Oh maybe today I’ve lost you. Driving faster out on this empty road. Being single’s so bad at twenty-three. Looking for signs, asking strangers directions. When the answer’s right in front of me. Strange how a minute can feel like a lifetime. I know what I had now it’s gone. I swallowed my pride coz alone here, I’m dying. And with you is where I belong. For twenty-four hours I’ve been searching for reasons. Reasons why we should be living apart. Hope I’m not too late to come home. Work it out, start anew. Oh maybe today I’ve lost you. Baby today, I’ve lost you. Baby today, I’ve lost you"

what you believe in,"What am I to you and what are you to me?. Are we getting better or did we used to be?. What of the song we used to sing?. Where are the souls we used to carry in?. What is a sail without hurricane?. What is a hurt without someone to blame?. Show me the sky and I'll climb the stairs. Give me something 'cause I'm losing it.. Give me what it is you believe in. 'Cause I give to you my truth. I got all my faith in you. I don't know which way we are going. Doesn't matter anyway. Just as long as you will stay.. Tell me the word and I'll shout it out. For what is a voice when in doubt?. The world has changed. The world will change. Oh give me something cause I need to feel.. It's so good you know. I still love you so. And you don't have to do this on your own.. No, no"
whatever you do to me,"I'm mad at you, because af all the things you do. I want you to see the way your games are hurting me. So why did I ever fall in love with you. You're all of my nightmares and dreams come true. What can I do to make you talk this problem through. You said you've nothing to hide. So let me hear your feelings inside. I never dreamed that I'd see this kind of thing in my life. So baby, plase let me go, let me go. Whatever you do to me. Somebody else will do to you. However you break my heart. Somebody else will break yours too. All I can see are staring eyes of mistery. I've tried to look behind before you take my dignity and pride. We sit and talk all night, still you never seem to lose your height. You believe in yourself, I hope I'm never gonna need your help. Whatever you do to me. Somebody else will do to you. However you break my heart. Somebody else will break yours too. You don't want me, you don't need me, I got news now. Cos baby I'm watching you. Whatever you do to me. Somebody else will do to you. However you break my heart. Somebody else will break yours too."
when we were young,When we were young the world seemed so old. Careless and cold. We did what we were told in our lives. When we were young. Had the world by the tail. Good would prevail. Starships at sail. And none of us would fail in this life. Not when you're young. We were drawn to whoever could keep us together. And bound by the heavens above. And we tried to survive travelling at the speed of love. (Wo oh oh). When we were young. When we adored the fabulous. (Wo oh oh). When we were young. We were foolish and fearless. Never knowing the cost of what we paid. Letting someone else be strong. (Who oh oh). When we were young. In a moment of grace. A long leap of faith. The still more glorious dawn awaits. My life. I'm here with the lovers (I'm here with the lovers). And we burned the bridges. We're crossing over. Just to see the firelight. And the innocent are getting over. Being old tonight. (Who oh oh). When we were young. When everything was what it seemed. (Who oh oh). When we were young. And every day was how we dreamed. Never knowing the cost of what we paid. Letting someone else be strong. (Who oh oh). When we were young. And when you look at yourself tonight. Are you someone you recognize?. You can take back what you've given away. But it must be the last time. (Who oh oh). When we were young. (Who oh oh). When we were young. When we were young. (Wo oh oh). When we were young. When we adored the fabulous. (Wo oh oh). When we were young. We were foolish and fearless. (Who oh oh). When we were young. We didn't know it wouldn't last. (Who oh oh). When we were young
why can't i wake up with you?,"Oh, I can't decide. If I should read or think. I'll keep an open mind. Till the day sets in. Hear you call me. I'm so willing to call back. Hear you thinking. Hopw you hear me thinking too. Chorus. Why can't I wake up with you. So you're there when I open my eyes. Baby why can't I wake up with you. You're my life. Oh, I feel alive. So I'll just begin. To read my mind. Before you ring me. Hear you thinking. Hope you hear me thinking too. Repeat chorus. So good to be near you. So dark when you walk from my side. Baby why can't I wake up with you. You're my life. Hear you thinking. Hope you hear me thinking too. Repeat chorus. Why don't we dream to see night. So you're there when the dark turns to light. Baby I know this is right. You're my life."
wonderful world,"What a wonderful world this is. What a wonderful world this is. It makes me want to kiss. What a beautiful kiss this is. What a beautiful kiss of life. Just before I die. I've been spending time. I've been losing time. Time was all we had. But it was never ours to keep. Time can help you find the ground and knock you off your feet. All those minutes get lost in time. One step forward two steps behind. So before I think myself too deep. What a wonderful world this is. What a wonderful world this is. What a delicate tale of bliss. That I don't want to miss. In this moment where we all exist. On the precipice of the abyss. It always was, how it is. (Spending time). I've been spending time,. (Wasting time). I've been wasting time. Time was all we had. But it was never ours to keep. Time can help you find the ground and knock you off your feet. All those minutes get lost in time. One step forward two steps behind. So before I think myself too deep. What a wonderful world this is. No time.... (Am I losing my mind). No time.... (Am I losing my mind). There's no time for us, no time for us until we're out of time (we're. Running out of time). There's no time for us, no time. What a wonderful world this is. There's no time for us, no time (we're running out of time). (Time was all we had. But it was never ours to keep. Time was all we had. But it was never ours to keep. Time was all we had. But it was never ours to keep)"

wooden boat,"A little boy me went fishing in a wooden boat. Sitting there for hours in the cold. Patience is a virtue til we die. Then a ripple in the water caught my eye. Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for. That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor. We go from green to blue to gold to black. Breathe deep, who knows how long this will last. Only was last week I learned to drive. Stole my Mother's keys and drove all night. Christine never showed it's 4am. Started up Mum's car drove home again. Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for. That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor. We go from green to blue to gold to black. Breathe deep, who knows how long this will last. One year ago I kissed my bride. Now I wait to hear my baby's cry. Woman showed me all that she knew then. To cut himself down man's born again. Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for. That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor. We go from green to blue to gold to black. Breathe deep, who knows how long this will last. Christine died and now I'm here alone. What I wouldn't give to be on that wooden boat"
you,"It's not a spark that gives me light. It's not the days I'm up all night. It's not a story I have read. Or a picture in my head. It's not the world that pulls me through. It wasn't a question before I knew. It's just an answer here by my side. I found it out just in time. Chorus:. It's you uuuuuu,yeah. It's you uuuuuu,it's you. Give me your hurt if you're feeling pain. Tell me your secrets I keep them safe. Give me your love mixed up with sin. Every part of every thing. Chorus:. It's you uuuuuu,oh yeah. It's you uuuuuu,it's you. From now till the end. From now till the end. From now till the end. My friend. It's a moment of glory. My one and only. Chorus:. It's you uuuuuu,oh yeah. It's you uuuuuu,it's you (x3). It's you. Just you. Yeah,it's you. It's you. Just you. Yeah,it's you"
you are the one,"You hurt my mind, you hurt my soul. Never believing what I'm saying. I'll hunt you down, I'll make you mine. You'll be the game I've started playing. And if you won't be there I will know where you're going. And if you won't be there I will try everyway of showing you that. You are the one, you are the one. The one for me. You are the one, you are the one. The one I need. You understand, you realise. The scene that I'm creating. And all the while you compromise. On the liberties I'm taking. If you don't believe I want just you and I together. Then you won't believe the dream of you and I forever because. You are the one, you are the one. The one for me. You are the one, you are the one."
