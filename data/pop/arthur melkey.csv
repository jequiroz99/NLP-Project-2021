infinite,"Was I wrong to dream?. Because it felt so right. Heaven seemed so close. I thought that love would for once be mine. Heaven seemed so close. I thought we would fly throughout the sky. But I guess that love could grow. Only in my heart, but not thine. No one is to blame. And yet I apologize even so. For I wish that I was stronger. But I love you way too much. I cannot stand too close. You don't know how it hurts. It's time to say goodbye. You'll go your own way and I'll go mine. I guess we ran out of time. Now all I can do is. dream of a life we could have lived. Dream of a place (where) we could have been free. Hope for a better way to be. Maybe someday we'll be infinite. Are you sure you must go?. I don't wanna let go. When did everything go wrong?. Can't we turn back in time. And try to start again?. We'll make love infinite"
need to know,"My love, I need to know. If you want me to go. Please ask me to stay. Don't send me far away. I know we may break. Seems like we're both afraid. But I'm willing to risk it all. To do anything that it takes. And I. Am actually believing. For the first time I feel. It might all turn out right. And I. I will not rest in peace. If we don't try to live this. This story so beautiful whose hero's a kiss. I hope it's not too late. I hope it's not too soon. All these things that I am thinking. should they really be said to you?. I know this is hard. You say you can't love. But I've been down that road. turns out I only tried to fool my heart. Just let it take flight. Just let it be strong. When it comes to love. letting go will never do you wrong. It's been there all along. You just have to believe. Please do this for us. So we can be free. We could be free. I'll heal you with my tears. My love, I need to know. If you want me to go. Please ask me to stay. Don't send me far away"
never enough,"The days are growing, I just keep going. They're all becoming just a waste of time. The pile is growing, It's overflowing. All my beliefs and dreams are thrown aside. If I should die now, if I should fall down. Just give me one more chance to get this right. If I should die now, if I should live now. I'm only asking you for one last sign. Chorus. Tell me how long. How long 'till I find no more reason for living?. How long 'till I find no more reason to stay?. How long 'till I find no more reason. for breathing?. How long 'till I find no more will to pray?. I'm getting old now, I'm feeling weak now. Can't tell the difference between day and night. They say I'm growing, that I am chosen. And yet I never seem to know what's mine. If death should come first, I vanquish this curse. Will my whole life have been no more than lies?. I've never know trust, or proven my worth. This can't be what I'll be remembered by. ​. [Chorus]. Tell me how long. How long 'till I find no more reason for living?. How long 'till I find no more reason to stay?. How long 'till I find no more reason. for breathing?. How long 'till I find no more will to pray?. ​. Maybe if I drink I'll be able to forget. Maybe the smoke will release me from the past. Maybe with a pill I'll be able to relax. Maybe a lover will put my mind to rest. It's never enough!. [Chorus]. Tell me how long. How long 'till I find no more reason for living?. How long 'till I find no more reason to stay?. How long 'till I find no more reason. for breathing?. How long 'till I find no more will to pray?. Even if it's all in my head. It's been so long now. But it keeps rolling in my head. I'm getting old now. And it keeps rolling in my head"
too heavy to fly,"Whisper something in the wind. Hope it reaches me before. We collect ""what could have been""s. Or worse, we don't dream anymore. I don't want another day. Far away from you. I ask the stars from salvation. They send an angel itself. He calls me up from the sky. To fly away from this hell. But here I am undone, chained. Chained to the ground. Oh oh oh oh, run away from here. At least one. Of us gets to be free. Don't try to come down to save me. From this place where I am. I've never heard of anyone. Who ever got to return. Spread your wings and fly high. Don't stop until you're covered. with stars and their shine. Somewhere there's a place in time. That's filled with light. Don't look behind. Don't look behind. I'm too heavy to fly. To fly"
what we could get,"We were never meant for each other, baby. But can we kiss one more time?. The things you say, how they hurt me, honey. Yet I don't want us to die. I've spent too many nights alone. I have no other place to go. So when I just close my eyes I can pretend. You love me for what I am. I know that no one's guilty. And we've had some good times after all. But something born out of fear. Is always doomed to fall. We were doubting our dreams. Hoping and praying. Wishing that life would be kind at least once. And as the years went by. Our dreams died and hope was gone. So we took what we could get. We took what we could get. We took what we could get. We took what we could get. Stop holding to me. You're killing me now. Babe we bring each other down. I'm dying inside. and yet I can't make a sound. Can't you see you're killing me now. Can't you see you're killing me now"
zazazu i (carried away),"Every second closer. I'm flying away from my problems. Everything will be new. Any moment now. I will land in some new place. Where I can be close to you. And it feels like heaven. I am soaring through the sky. Even with the turbulences. I'm learning it's just life. I think I like the chill. I feel this time it's real. The butterflies are spinning in my stomach. I wish that you could be here right now, honey. The butterflies are swirling in my stomach. I can see you all wet, half-naked. when it gets sunny. If I knew before life could be so fun. I'd have dared and started living it sooner. All it takes is stepping outside. I swear, I've tried. Then everything was a boomer. Now that I'm aware I won't let another day go by. I am not afraid. Now I can jump from any height. I'm sure that you can too. It'll be just me and you. The butterflies are spinning in my stomach. I wish that you could be here right now, honey. The butterflies are swirling in my stomach. I can see you all wet, half-naked. when it gets sunny. Don't let distance get in the way. Let yourself get carried away"
