Fuck me all up put your hands on me. One more, baby, have some fun. We only got one year to be 21. I'm feeling perfect when the music's too loud. I'm sick of working, i just want to hang out. I want somebody, i want a stranger in a crowd. Life is so crazy and i think am too. I easily forget ‘bout people it's true. I live in the moment, new faces, vintage tattoos. Cruising all summer.

home is in your eyes,My heart beats a little bit slower. These nights are a lit bit colder. Now that you''re gone. My skies seem a little bit darker. Sweet dreams come a little bit harder. I hate when you''re gone. Everyday time is passing. I''m growing tired of all this traveling. Take me away to where you are. I wanna be holdin' your hand in the sand by the tire swing. Where we used to be. Baby you and me. I traveled a thousand miles. Just so I can see you smile. Feels so far away when you cry ‘cause home is in your eyes. Your heart beats a little bit faster. There''s tears where there used to be laughter. Now that I''m gone. You talk just a little bit softer. Things take just a little bit longer. You hate that I''m gone. Everyday time is passing. I''m growing tired of all this traveling. Take me away to where you are. I wanna be holdin' your hand in the sand by the tire swing. Where we used to be. Baby you and me. I traveled a thousand miles.

Just so I can see you smile. Feels so far away when you cry ‘cause home is in your eyes

hold on 'til the night,Watching the minute hand. Frozen solid not moving. Still we believe we can. But we're afraid of losing. Watching from over here. It's hardly worth competing. I'm almost out of here. Why break a heart that's beating. Just as I start giving up. I'm not backing off. Run into the light. Get out of your own way. Not afraid to fight. Believe in what you say. I'll hold on till the night. Hanging by a thread. I'm not scared to let go. Thoughts inside your head. That creep up to get you. I believe this is right. So I'll hold on til the night. I climbed up on a tree. To get a new perspective. If love is worth the time. The price is being rejected. Just as I start falling down. I turned this around. Run into the light. Get out of your own way. Not afraid to fight. Believe in what you say. I'll hold on till the night. Hanging by a thread. I'm not scared to let go. Thoughts inside your head. That creep up to get you. I believe this is right. So I'll hold on til the night. Hold on til I'm with you. All I've got to give you. All my fears are slowly fading to never know. Yes I start running running running running!. [Chorus]. Run into the light. Get out of your own way. Not afraid to fight. Believe in what you say. I'll hold on till the night. (Believe that this is the night). Hanging by a thread. I'm not scared to let go. Thoughts inside your head. That creep up to get you. I believe this is right. So I'll hold on til the night. . (Roger Nickison)
home is in your eyes,My heart beats a little bit slower. These nights are a lit bit colder. Now that you''re gone. My skies seem a little bit darker. Sweet dreams come a little bit harder. I hate when you''re gone. Everyday time is passing. I''m growing tired of all this traveling. Take me away to where you are. I wanna be holdin' your hand in the sand by the tire swing. Where we used to be. Baby you and me. I traveled a thousand miles. Just so I can see you smile. Feels so far away when you cry ‘cause home is in your eyes. Your heart beats a little bit faster. There''s tears where there used to be laughter. Now that I''m gone. You talk just a little bit softer. Things take just a little bit longer. You hate that I''m gone. Everyday time is passing. I''m growing tired of all this traveling. Take me away to where you are. I wanna be holdin' your hand in the sand by the tire swing. Where we used to be. Baby you and me. I traveled a thousand miles. Just so I can see you smile. Feels so far away when you cry ‘cause home is in your eyes. If I could write another ending. This wouldn''t even be our song. I''d find a way that we would never ever be apart. Right from the start. I wanna be holdin' your hand in the sand by the tire swing. Where we used to be. Baby you and me. I traveled a thousand miles. Just so I can see you smile. Feels so far away when you cry ‘cause home is in your eyes

Maybe you're the one for me. You're the one for me. This feels a lot like love. Leila... Leila... Leila.... You're the one for me. Oh. The one for me"
light up the dark,"Byways, highways, freeways, I’m always yours. Smoke billowing from your blue eyes that got me from the start. Planes glowing bright in the distance. We’re rising high. (Chorus). I am love sick and I just can’t be healed. It happened so quick, now I’m head over heels. For you ‘cause you’re the love of my heart. You’re the match and we’re the spark, we’re fire. We light up the dark. We light up the dark. Stars shinning, rain falling, love is starting with us. Free flowing melodies playing on and on and on. Planes glowing bright in the distance. We’re rising high. (Chorus). I am love sick and I just can’t be healed. It happened so quick, now I’m head over heels. For you ‘cause you’re the love of my heart. You’re the match and we’re the spark, we’re fire. We light up the dark. We light up the dark. I am a different person waiting for you. You have changed me, arranged me into something new. Love sick and I can’t just behave. (Chorus). Love sick and I just can’t be healed. It happened so quick, now I’m head over heels. For you because you’re the love of my heart. You’re the match and we’re the spark, we’re fire. We light up the dark. (Chorus). Love sick and I just can’t be healed. It happened so quick, now I’m head over heels.

little london girl,"I shut the door. And I step outside. It's close to midnight. And the fog is in. And the street lights. With the sound of Big Ben. It reminded me. It was only yesterday. When we first met in that cafe. And our worlds entwined.. Ooooh don't you know?. I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops now, baby. I'm ready to go.. Ooooh don't you know?. It doesn't matter if the sun's going down on me. You light my world. My little London girl.. Sunglasses on. You take me to Camden Town. As you share your headphones. With the Kinks and the Rolling Stones.. As you walk around. In your leather boots. All the boys are staring. But you're not caring. ‘Cuz you're so rock and roll (so rock and roll). Woahhh.... Ooooh don't you know?. I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops now, baby. I'm ready to go.. Ooooh don't you know?. It doesn't matter if the sun is going down on me. You light my world.

london,"You wandered through every chartered street. Knew where the flowing water goes. And down in every face you meet. You found a sadness, a story untold. You feel all the cries of all the man. You feel all of their fear. And in your voice and in your bed. My mind sees thoughts that I can't hear. Could you leave them all in london?. Could you leave them all there?. Could you run past your devils?. And let your mind be clear. Could you leave them all in london?. Could you leave them all there?. Cause in you, there's an angel. An angel trapped by fear. You're so trapped by fear. You live your life on the line. While every blackening church appals. And all their words run sapless and dry. And they run like bloods. On your apartment walls. You feel every cry of every man. You feel all of their fear. And in your voice and in your bed. My mind sees thoughts that I can't hear. Could you leave them all in london?. Could you leave them all there?. Could you run past your devils?. And let your mind be clear. Could you leave them all in london?. Could you leave them all there?. Cause in you, there's an angel. An angel plagued by fear. Cause in you, there's an angel. An angel trapped by fear. But I'll be here. But I'll be here. I'll be here. Oh, I'll be here. Oh, I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here"

Didn't know how to feel when you broke me down. I needed time to move around without you. But I think I'm ready to hear I love you. And I don't know where to go, yeah.

We can kill some time and watch movies all night. Later we'll be talking as the sky turns light. Every morning spent with you. Cause every night I love the truth. The timing never felt so right this feeling's unknown. My love as a meridian continues to grow. Oh the lines they used to say. What type of life we lived. But now, we're creating them. We're flying to another time. Our lives they've been circled been entwined. Kiss my lips and take me there. To heights unheard of thoughts unreal. You're so unreal.
