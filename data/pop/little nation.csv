that's me without you,"A flower without petals. A bird without its feathers. That's me without you near. A party without laughter. Tweety without Sylvester. That's me without you near. So why won't you come back to me?. I want you more than anything. I need you night and day. No words could ever say. How much I wish you could be here. A song without a rhyme. And a clock without the time. That's me without you near. A circus without clowns. And a queen without a crown. That's me without you near. I just want to hold you close. Can't wait to look into your eyes. Get lost inside your kiss. And find the missing piece. To fill the hole that's in my heart. There is no me when you are not around. It gets so lonely and I'm going crazy. I spend the days trying to figure out. A way to make you stay forever, baby. Please stay. A head without a body. Snoopy without Charlie. That's me without you near. A car without a driver. A camp without a fire. That's me without you near"
just stay,"Far on the other side. There's a story just as long as mine. I keep telling everybody. Is it something I should hide. Cry right before my eyes. Keep my secrets and unveil my lies. You should be a little careful. I've been careful all my life. Left behind so many times. I fall again. You can stay a little while. But stay, just stay. Make me believe it's right to choose you. I'll always keep my promise to you. Just stay. I'll try to be the one to soothe you. When you can't sleep immersed in your blues. Just stay"
you can have it all,"You can have it all. Every line, every word. From every song. I still lie in the dark. Talking to my ghost. Waiting for dawn to break. And set me free. You can have it all. Every thought, every dream. You could steal my heart. I have opened the door. It's inevitable. The way I feel so surreal. There is something so special. About feeling essential. Where you hide all the reason. Your eyes witness something I call love. Only love. You can have my love. You can have it all. Every hi, every bye. Every single touch. You can try to deny. It's unstoppable. The way you know how it feels. How it feels to lose yourself. Please don't make a sound now. Let me have this moment before you go. Please just change your mind now. Let me have you for a lifetime or so. There is something so special. About feeling essential. Where you hide all the reason. Your eyes witness something I call love. Only love. You can have my love. There is something so crazy. It's like soaring to spaces. Where you fight all the reason. Your skin feels something warm I call love. Only love. You can have my love"
unknown,"Unknown. All it seems to be. Winding roads and me. Never-ending fears. They go. Running through my veins. Driving me insane. All over again. You call me back to your side. Where I'll rest my head at night. We could stare at the stars. For the rest of our lives. I'm here. Although you can't see. Where the road will lead. Maybe it's just a dream. Night falls. All the lights are out. Moon hid in the clouds. Over a ghost town. It's not the same by your side. Where you rest your head at night. Could we stare at the stars. For the rest of our lives. Maybe this could be the end of a heart's drought. Hear me, give me voice when I can't make a sound. Unknown. All it seems to be"
i am alive,"Eyes so open wide. Old tears are dry. I am alive. Steps, one at a time. Breathe sunlight. I am alive. Go on, it's all. You can do till the day is through. Go on, pick up.

maze,"Cherish the moment. When they are gone and. You can speak out. Now matter how loud. Sometimes you're broken. Your own opponent. You'd better decide. Who you've got to fight. Your heart or your mind. Who's wrong or right. It came from nowhere. This sudden feeling. I'm hollow inside. But I'm doing fine. Ready for nothing. I don't deserve it. So I'll open up. Before I break down. With no one around. Please, let me out. Tell me when the pain will turn into a lesson I have got to learn. Take my hand and lead me to the end of this maze I am lost in. I'll find myself soon. Now I'm walking past. All the worst and best. Everything I've got to give. I will find myself. I have no one else. It's the maze I've built in me"
reach out,Touch the cracks in the desert ground. Knock on wood just to hear a sound. Anything in the world could show the way. Building blocks falling from the air. Gotta reach out our hands. Gotta reach out again. They'll never say that we didn't try it. They'll always mourn though we're not yet dying. I want to start again. But if you wanna know when we get there. We can leave you a note on the fridge 'cause you know that we still care. But if you wanna go and find your dreams. We'll be waiting for you on the corner of life. Follow the wind. Soon enough we can see the light. Ever so close that we touch the stars. Anywhere in the world could be our home. Feel the rain falling from the sky. Gotta reach out our hands. Gotta reach out again.

roller coaster,"I can't hold you. Or break your fall. Cause I jumped the gun. By giving it my all. I'd be a crane. If it did the trick. Such a heavy weight. My skinny arms can't lift. I can take you down south. I could go north with you. Would it change anything?. Wishful thinking, nostalgia's. A fallacious hope. I am scared of the truth. It's all over. Just like it's meant to be. Roller coaster. It's been a ride indeed. It's all over. Should we end up like this. Roller coaster. We're going down. You see beauty. In everything. Though you took misery. And made it your own skin. Every line is a cry. As desperation sets in. Is it all in our minds?. We've been there many times. To hear another excuse. Does it mean we are through?. It's all over. Just like it's meant to be. Roller coaster. It's been a ride indeed. It's all over. Should we end up like this. Roller coaster. We're going down. So I'll cry in my bed like all the little girls do. And I'll feel like a mess, let ego take over me. Is it you, is it me. Is it life happening. It's all over. Just like it's meant to be. Roller coaster. It's been a ride indeed. It's all over. Should we end up like this. Roller coaster. We're going down. So I'll cry in my bed until we become memories"
silence,"I'm not asking you to love me. I'm just asking you to stay. To sit and watch the sunset. At the end of our day. Come and stay. Come and stay a little longer. Come and stay. Let me take your hand in mine. I was out for just a minute. Now I'm back and you are gone. Did you hear my heart, it whispered. I'm not leaving you alone. It's okay. It's okay, I can hold on. It's okay. I can pay the price for us. And the sweetness lingers in my mouth. You hit me like a moving wall. Closing down on me. Triggered feelings exploded. But now it's gone. There's only silence. This isn't home. Remain in silence. Till we get home. Here we are facing the demons. Kept on lock throughout this life. Who says ugly words can kill us. When your kindness turns the knife. Not okay. I'm not okay but I will manage. As you say. As you say you believe in me"

Now it's time to face the truth. You drowned me in your words. When everyone's the same. You stood out in the crowd. I blame it on your ways. Your eyes can see me through. I'm what I am today. It's all because of you. You make me want to change. You make me want to change. You're the hardest book I've ever. Tried to read, but I can. Never put you down. Want to go through every story.
