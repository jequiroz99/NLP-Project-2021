Everybody wants a thrill. Payin' anything to roll the dice. Just one more time. Some will win, some will lose. Some were born to sing the blues. Oh, the movie never ends. It goes on and on and on and on. Strangers waiting. Up and down the boulevard. Their shadows searching in the night. Streetlights people. Living just to find emotion. Hiding somewhere in the night"

He took the midnight train going anywhere. A singer in a smoky room. The smell of wine and cheap perfume. For a smile they can share the night. It goes on and on and on and on. Strangers waiting. Up and down the boulevard. Their shadows searching in the night. Streetlights people. Living just to find emotion. Hiding somewhere in the night. Working hard to get my fill. Everybody wants a thrill. Payin' anything to roll the dice. Just one more time. Some will win, some will lose. Some were born to sing the blues. Oh, the movie never ends. It goes on and on and on and on. Strangers waiting. Up and down the boulevard. Their shadows searching in the night. Streetlights people. Living just to find emotion. Hiding somewhere in the night"

my interpretation,You talk about life you talk about death. And everything inbetween. Like its nothing. And the words are easy. You talk about me and talk about you. And everything I do. Like it something. That needs repeated. I don't need an alibi or for you to realize. The things we left unsaid. Are only taking space up in our head. Make it my fault win the game. Point the finger place the blame. It does me up and down. It doesn't matter now. Coz I don't care if I ever talk to you again. This is not about emotion. I don't need a reason not to care what you say. Or what happened in the end. This is my interpretaion. And it don't don't make sense. The first two weeks turned into ten. I hold my breath and wonder when it'll happen. Does it really matter. If half of what you said is true. And half of what I didn't do. Could be different would it make it better. If we forget the things we know. Would we have somewhere to go. The only way is down I can see that now. Coz I don't care if I ever talk to you again. This is not about emotion. I don't need a reason. Not to care what you say. Or what happened in the end. This is my interpretaion. And it don't don't make sense
no place in heaven,Father will you forgive me for my sins. Father if there's a heaven let me in. I don't know where to go if I should die. We haven't been on speaking terms for so long you and I.

There's no place in heaven for someone like me. Won't you open the door and try me once more. 'Cause there's no place in heaven for someone like me. 'Cause there's no place in heaven.

Prayed every night to a religion that was chosen for me. Sold my soul broke my bones. Tell me what did I get. Did my time, toed the line. Ain't seen anything yet. Strike me down to the ground. You know I've seen it before. Make it hurt I'll eat the dirt. I just don't care anymore. How could you break my heart. Already played my part. I kept my promise man. Show me the promissed land. Don't occupy my throne. Give me the crown I own. Lived like you told me how. Look at me now. I've got no money in my pocket. And the whole world's bringing me down. And the whole world's bringing me down. One person's lie is just another man's truth. We got done running from the devil but the devil was you. Every time I see the light I'm falling deeper in debt. If I've never seen the good how can I come to amend. Sold my soul broke my bones. Tell me what did I get. Did my time, toed the line. Ain't seen anything yet. Strike me down to the ground. You know I've seen it before. Make it hurt I'll eat the dirt. I just don't care anymore. How could you break my heart. Already played my part. I kept my promise man. Show me the promised land.

rio,"[Verse 1]. Oh, here I go again. I wake up every morning to this Groundhog Day. Thinking about the list of things that I've done wrong. Can't even count, it goes on too long. I try to change my ways. I feel like I'm the villain in some crappy play. The book has long been written, but I'd rather be. Just about anyone else but me, I hope you see. It doesn't mean I'm not a fighter. It's just that I wanna be a little lighter. Spent so long fixing things I've done. I've got holes in all my pockets. Even those holes, they've got pockets. Hiding things that'll never see the sun. [Chorus]. I'm taking off, going to Rio. I'm getting lost to find an alter-ego. It could be Paris or Berlin, I don't care what state I'm in. Gonna leave it all behind. Maybe I'll be myself when I'm somebody else. This is not an invitation, I'm going to Rio. This is not a conversation, say goodbye to me-oh. [Verse 2]. Maybe in ten years time. You'll receive a letter from some random guy. You'll like him so much better. But then you will see, he's not a stranger it's only me. I can only be myself as somebody else. Cause you got sun, I got bad weather. Anything you can lose I can lose better. Do my best with what life gave to me. I've got holes in all my pockets. Even those holes, they've got pockets. Hiding things that I sure want to leave. [Chorus]. I'm taking off, going to Rio. I'm getting lost to find an alter-ego. It could be Paris or Berlin, I don't care what state I'm in. Gonna leave it all behind. Maybe I'll be myself when I'm somebody else. This is not an invitation, I'm going to Rio. This is not a conversation, say goodbye to me-oh. [Bridge]. Give me a peanut and I'll turn blue. I can't even eat the things you do. Bake you a cake and I burn it up twice. I roll thirteen on a pair of dice. Give me a peanut and I'll turn blue. I can't even eat the things you do. Bake you a cake and I burn it up twice. I roll thirteen on a pair of dice. [Chorus]. I'm taking off, going to Rio. I'm getting lost to find an alter-ego. It could be Paris or Berlin, I don't care what state I'm in. Gonna leave it all behind. Maybe I'll be myself when I'm somebody else. This is not an invitation, I'm going to Rio.

When you're looking tough but you need a way to let it go. Come on now, what's a boy s'posed to do. But I can't seem to leave you alone. Touching me touching you. This isn't a perfect love. One that we're guilty of. What am I supposed to do?. Can't seem to leave you alone. Touching me touching you (repeats)"
toy boy,"I'm a wind-up toy in an up down world. If you leave me all alone, I'll make a mess for sure. I've a heart of gold and the smallest size. Leave me in the dark, you'll never hear me cry. More than an illustration. Points of articulation. Come to life on a brass spring. Such a wonderful plaything. It's a cruel blue cross that I have to bear. Come a little close I'm going to pull your hair. More than just a toy in a patch-blue suit. Hold me in your arms I'm just a boy like you. But your mama thought there was somethin' wrong. Didn't want you sleeping with a boy too long. It's a serious thing in a grown-up world. Maybe you'd be better with a Barbie girl. You were that I adored-ya. But you left me in Georgia. Toys are not sentimental. How could I be for rental?. She's the meanest hag that has ever been. Pulled out my insides with an old safety pin. I'm the sorest sight, now I feel like trash. Clothes are made of rags and they don't even match. So she dressed me up as the man she loved. Then threw me in a box when she had had enough. Now the light of day I no longer see. She stuck her voodoo pins where my eyes used to be. Accidentally tragic. Victim of her black magic. Had a boy once who loved me. Now he's so afraid of me. On a long lost day. When you're grey and dull. You'll be there remembering. Your old Toy Boy. When your oldest son's. Wondering what to be. Tell him the story of a boy like me. Oooh oh oooh oh oooh oh oh X4"
underwater,"Bursting through a blood red sky. A slow landslide. And the world we leave behind. It's enough to lose your head. Disappear and not return again. When I fall to my feet. Wearin' my heart on my sleeve. All I see just don't make sense. You are the port of my call. You shot and leavin' me raw. Now I know you're amazing. 'Cause all I need. Is the love you breathe. Put your lips on me and. I can live underwater. Underwater, underwater. Underwater. Underwater. Flying through a bright blue sky. With a space boy high. From the world I leave behind. It's enough to lose my head. Disappear and not be seen again. When I fall to my feet. Wearin' my heart on my sleeve. All I see just don't make sense. You are the port of my call. You shot and leavin' me raw. Now I know you're amazing. 'Cause all I need. Is the love you breathe. Put your lips on me and. I can live underwater. Underwater, underwater. Underwater. Underwater. Underwater underwater. I can live underwater. With your love I can breathe. I can breathe underwater. Underwater underwater. I can live underwater. With your love I can breathe. I can breathe underwater. Underwater underwater. We could live underwater. With your love I can breathe. I can breathe underwater. Underwater, underwater. We could live underwater. With your love we could breathe. We could breathe underwater. . ~P.H.G~"
we are golden,"Teenage dreams in a teenage circus. Running around like a clown on purpose. Who gives a damn about the family you come from?. No giving up when you're young and you want some. Running around again. Running from running. Waking up. In the midday sun. What's to live for?. You could see what I`ve done. Staring at emotion. In the light of day. I was running. From the things that you'd say. We are not what you think we are. We are golden, we are golden.. We are not what you think we are. We are golden, we are golden.. Teenage dreams in a teenage circus. Running around like a clown on purpose. Who gives a damn about the family you come from?. No giving up when you're young and you want some. Running around again. Running from running. Running around again. Running from running. I was a boy. At an open door. Why you staring. Do you still think that you know?. Looking for treasure. In the things that you threw. Like a magpie. I live for glitter, not you. We are not what you think we are. We are golden, we are golden.. We are not what you think we are. We are golden, we are golden.. Teenage dreams in a teenage circus. Running around like a clown on purpose. Who gives a damn about the family you come from?. No giving up when you're young and you want some. Now I'm sitting alone. I'm finally looking around. Left here on my own. I'm gonna hurt myself. Maybe losing my mind. I'm still wondering why. Had to let the world let it bleed me dry. We are not what you think we are. We are not what you think we are. We are not what you think we are. We are golden, we are golden. Teenage dreams in a teenage circus. Running around like a clown on purpose. Who gives a damn about the family you come from?. No giving up when you're young and you want some. Running around again. Running from running. Running around again. Running from running. We are not what you think we are. We are golden, we are golden."
you made me,You can be difficult and I can be mean. We can be lovebirds or sting like bees. We're walking a wire. In danger of falling from grace. A minute of pleasure. An hour of pain. You reel me back in with your physical thing. Cause sometimes you're worth all of the things I hate. I should let go. My head says yes but my heart says no. So I'm black and I'm blue. And I act like a fool. Cause you make me. Crazy. And I'm up and I'm down. Turning into the clown you made me. Baby that's what you're. Waiting for. You make me want you more. You see it black I see it white. You're never wrong and I'm always right. We argue the point. The point is to disagree. I'm better off dead. -?- of personality. Is in your head. Cause I'm black and I'm blue. And I act like a fool. Cause you make me. Crazy. And I'm up and I'm down. Turning into the clown you make me. Baby that's what you're. Waiting for. Baby you played me. But you'll never make me kiss you back and fall apart. I don't have to do it just cause you make me. I'm black then blue. And I won't like a fool. Cause you make me. Baby. I get up I get down. But I won't be the clown that you make me. Baby. Black and then blue. I won't act like a fool. That you make me. Baby. I get up I get down. But I won't be the clown that you make me. Baby. I get black and then blue. And I won't act like a fool. Cause you make me. Baby. I get up I get down. But I won't be the clown that you make me. Baby. by: lylahmoussa ;D
you've got the love,Sometimes I feel like. Throwing my hands up in the air. I know I can count on you. Sometimes I feel like saying. Lord I just don't care. But you've got the love I need. To see me through. Sometimes it seems that. The going is just too rough. And things go wrong. No matter what I do. Now and then I feel. That life is just too much. But you've got the love. I need to see me through. When food is gone. You are my daily meal. When friends are gone I know. My saviour's love is real. Your love is real. Every once in a while. I say Lord I can't go on. Every once in a while. I get to feeling blue. Every once in a while. it seems like I am all alone. But you got the love. I need to see me through. Occasionally. my thoughts are brave and friends are few. Occasionally. I cry out Lord what must I do. Occasionally. I call up Master make me new. You've got the love. I need to see me through. Sometimes I feel like. Throwing my hands up in the air. I know I can count on you. Sometimes I feel like saying. Lord I just don't care. But you've got the love I need. To see me through
your sympathy,"Running out of breath. Chasing down the big parade,. Rising up my hand,. Thought I'd beg the marching band to play, for me. All of these illusions,. They really mean the world to me, me. Don't make me out to be this helpless child of misery,. Maybe love is what I need. But not your sympathy. In and out of space,. I'm always somewhere in between,. I try to make commands. But instead I make a mess of things, for me. I try paint by numbers,. But nothing's black and white to me. Don't make me out to be this helpless child of misery,. Maybe love is what I need. But not your sympathy. Nothing and no one can make your lies the truth, and no one can stand inside your shoes but you. Don't make me out to be this helpless child misery,. Maybe love is what I need. But not your sympathy. But not your sympathy"
