Every word you write or sing is so warm to me. So warm to me I'm torn. I'm torn to be. Right where you are. I'm not afraid anymore. I'm not afraid. Forever is a long time. But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side. Tell me everyday I'd get to wake up to that smile. I wouldn't mind it at all. I wouldn't mind it at all. You so know me. Pinch me gently. I can hardly breathe. Forever is a long long time. But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side. Tell me everyday I'd get to wake up to that smile. I wouldn't mind it at all. I wouldn't mind it at all

too beautiful,"What kinda' man lays. His hands on the woman he loves. Calls her ""angel"". And shows no remorse. And the blood. He covers her body in bruises and scars.

When he's done with her beating. He just stands a side. Wipes the sweat from his brow. And yells over her cries. ""you don't know what i've been through!"". He yells and says. ""you don't know what i've done for you"". And hits her again. You are too beautiful. Your heart, I want something more. Those shades of blue. On that face of yours. Hide the smile that beats in your chest. She stands in the mirror. She looks less alive. She lifts up her shirt. To see she has five. Branded fingers on her side. She's feeling it all now. But she doesn't cry. She doesn't cry. You are too beautiful. Your heart, I want something more. Those shades of blue. On that face of yours. Hide the smile that beats in your chest"

sway,"I cast my self into the sea. To swim or even try?. To fight the currents and win is slim. So far now enjoy the ride. Compassion once filled to the brim. For those who lost their way. You had your chance, you chose to dance. So for now I'll just. Sway along,. I'll just sway along. I recall yesterday. And just the other day. I found myself alone. With a compass and a ship with no captain. Headed on my way home. See the only problem with my idea was I had no place to go. I found myself in you for some time. But now I'm all alone. Guess I've gotta. Sway along,. I'll just sway along. Find my way home,. Oh, I'll just, sway along. Look at me I used to care. Everybody point and stare,. I'm lost. I'm so lost. You used to consume my mind. But I was quick and sure to find. You can't ever love anyone who doesn't love you back. Anymore. Anymore. Sway along. I'll just sway along. Find my way home. Oh, I'll sway home. Sway along. Sway along. Oh oh oh.. @HeIsWeezy"

too beautiful,"What kinda' man lays. His hands on the woman he loves. Calls her ""angel"". And shows no remorse. And the blood. He covers her body in bruises and scars. You don't understand just how beautiful. You are. You are too beautiful. Your heart, I want something more. Those shades of blue. On that face of yours. Hide the smile that beats in your chest. When he's done with her beating. He just stands a side. Wipes the sweat from his brow. And yells over her cries. ""you don't know what i've been through!"". He yells and says. ""you don't know what i've done for you"". And hits her again. You are too beautiful. Your heart, I want something more. Those shades of blue. On that face of yours. Hide the smile that beats in your chest. She stands in the mirror. She looks less alive. She lifts up her shirt. To see she has five. Branded fingers on her side. She's feeling it all now. But she doesn't cry. She doesn't cry. You are too beautiful. Your heart, I want something more. Those shades of blue. On that face of yours. Hide the smile that beats in your chest"
