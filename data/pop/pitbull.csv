I look at these fools on camera flashin’ they tools. They must’ve forgot the streets got codes and rules. But me, I’m confused. ‘Cause rappers wanna be gangstas. Gangstas wanna be rappers. Ballers wanna be rappers. And rappers wanna be ballers. The truth is its more sickening than Ebola. Until they handcuff then its over. Pop up no dandruff, no neck, just head and shoulders. Bust guns, sell drugs, that’s what the streets showed us. But corporate America, that’s what they sold us"

all the things (feat. inna),"[Intro: Pitbull]. International sensation. INNA. And Mr. Worldwide, dale. [Verse: Pitbull]. I'm like a quarterback, I got options. But I play the point in school. Broke ankles, more than a few. Broke hearts, yea that too. 20 years later, same movie, same script. Same player, more chips. More women, more haters. Different toilet, same shit. Why get caught up in emotions?. Why go through the same motions. In a sick way she loves to see me mad. It gets `er wetter than the ocean. She's a good girl gone bad. But bad girls don't like good guys. Now tell me if you think I'm a good guy. That's what I though, hah let's ride. [Chorus: INNA]. All the things you do, all the things you say. Playin with my heart so I can run away. All the things you did, all the things you said to me. Said to me, said. Now I'm lonely in my bed. [Chorus: INNA]. All the things you do, all the things you say. Playin with my heart so I can run away. All the things you did, all the things you said to me. Said to me, said. Now I'm lonely in my bed. [Lyrics from: http: ww. lyricsty. com pitbull-all-the-things-lyrics. html]. [Verse: Pitbull]. They had a calling, but they got soft hearts. And I know they soft spots. I meet `em, I greet `em, I train `em. And show `em all about Hard Knox. Listen. Next thing you know [Next thing you know]. They holdin the fort down like Fort Knox. Then they fall in love and make everything seem what it's not. Damn!. These are called rules of engagement. Welcome to the world of entertainment. They don't want a man like Rayman. They want a man that's duck in the Raymonds. I know it's ironic. But the good girls love bad guys. Now tell me, do you think I'm a good guy?. That's what I though, now let's ride. [Chorus: INNA]. All the things you do, all the things you say. Playin with my heart so I can run away. All the things you did, all the things you said to me. Said to me, said. Now I'm lonely in my bed. [Chorus: INNA]. All the things you do, all the things you say. Playin with my heart so I can run away. All the things you did, all the things you said to me. Said to me, said. Now I'm lonely in my bed. [Chorus: INNA]. All the things you do, all the things you say. Playin with my heart so I can run away. All the things you did, all the things you said to me.

amanda diva skit,"These words are written in blood. on red and white lines. rhymes to the beat of a war drum that cries. like mothers whose sons were sent to fight. and widows whose spouses souls are. all that keep them warm at night. underneath spacious skies where. stars look more like bulletholes. and the haze of the clouds more like shrouds. I swear I smell gunsmoke, when I inhale too deep. cause cheap lies have caused the loss of priceless lives. bush is duckin the truth while the few. and the proud dodge landmines. niggaz is doin time for gettin caught with a dime. but he will never be indicted. for his crimes against this nation. impatient with waiting it's time we fall in line. and stop, falling for the lies. the war ain't only in iraq. it's time we fight back, for control of our minds"

And lie to you, only to leave something to the coroner. Fuck the law, fuck the feds, fuck cops. Pop, pop, catch you at your favorite spot. Well dressed, intermitted but dangerous. Go-getters, hustlers, gangsters. Everything organized. And If they hit us, surprise. One to the heart and two to the brain. Looks like he lost his mind, let's ride. There's rules and codes. You don't break them fo no one. Unless you're a fool. Like that fucking prick Sammy the Bull. Amore. Mio amore. I've waited for you. To save me tonight. But you left me dying. Slowly inside. Amore. Amore mio, amore. I'm waited for you. To bring me to life. But you left me dying. Dying inside. Three piece suit with a piece by the waistline. Just in case a motherfucker wanna take mine. I'ma get mine, get theirs, get yours. Cocked back, click-clack, give me that line. Mob royalty, walk out the court, not guilty, filthy. But dressed so fresh, so clean. So gentlemen, so mean. So loved, so hated. Yeah, I killed, yeah, I extorted. Yeah, I robbed but I'm the good of the mob. Fuck it, I made it. From nothing to something, scum to thug. Thug to gangster, gangster to mobster. No pot to piss into pasta and lobster. Bitch, I'm a rockstar. The king from Queens. That killed and died for his dreams. The rotten apple from the Big Apple. The realest gangster you even seen. John Gotti. The rotten apple from the Big Apple. The realest gangster you even seen. John Gotti. Amore. Amore mio, amore. I'm waited for you. To bring me to life. But you left me dying. Dying inside.

blood is thicker than water,"(feat. redd eyez). I know ya'll listen to my music (red eyes). But what I'mma do know is try. And describe my life to ya'll. [pitbull:]. Sometimes I fell like I'm loosing it. My life is upside down. A gift and a curse that's my life now. There is no looking or turning back. I used to watch coke turn to crack. That's what made me turn to rap. I fell like keanu reeves in the movie devils advocate. Confused but blessed with extravagance. I thank god for all the opportunities. Given the opportunity dem boys would put two in me. (bla bla bla). We live in the land of the free, hustlers and thieves. I made money now I got uncle sam hustling. Me for a quarter of what I make. Hand a quarter sentence to a fake. And watch them turn state (that's right). Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Until the fed's step in (that's just the way it is). Most of these fools are characters. Men with no character welcome to america. Where we fight for freedom. If ain't about oil than we don't need them. Ain't that the truth?. Pitbull I'm just tell ya'll the way I fell. Thank god that god made me to keep it real. [chorus:]. Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Until the fed's step in (that just the way it is). Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Till that fame step in (that's just the way it is). Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Till dem bitches step in (that's just the way it is). Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Till that money step in (that's just the way it is). [red eyes:]. Huh hun yo. After the turf war the smoke clears. All these years around these busta. I'm convinced there ain't no hope here. In the past four years of my lifetime. I witness leaders sacrifice freedom just to get this pipeline. Guess I'm chosen at the right time mama stress. Facing the table and she's snorting up white line. Blood is thicker than water. In a few cases your daughter. Can have touched for the money that in dem suit case. Tighten my shoelaces the fugitive running. In fear of a criminal past cuz dem folks is coming. I've been wrongfully judged being from this environment. The city gangs planning retirement. I'mma a dade nigga. Voicing my set cuz a spray quick. Took some of the same steps. Through little haiti as these main nigga (like who). Hit man, big dogg, and shehound. Ya'll predict it back then shit I see it know. [chorus:]. Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Until the fed's step in (that just the way it is ). Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Till that fame step in (that's just the way it is). Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Till dem bitches step in (that's just the way it is). Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Till that money step in (that's just the way it is). [pitbull:]. I escape poverty (poverty). I don't own jewelry motherfucker I own property. You can send dem tsunamis that hit indonesia (but but but). Ain't no motherfucking thing stopping me. Like good coke I'm a good swimmer. God knows I done lost but god dam I'm a good winner. It feels great to make something out of nothing yea. I'm humble but I tell ya'll to push a chico's buttons. And watch how them thing get to dumping. Real-estate new york game now you saying something. I only talk about what I know about. Illegal turn legal this year that's what I'm all about. I'm from the south and I ain't gonna lie. At fist time I preach ye till god struck me with pride. I was confused now I'm like let's ride. 305 Till I die. 305 Till I die. Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Until the fed's step in (that just the way it is). Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Till that fame step in (that's just the way it is). Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Till dem bitches step in (that's just the way it is).

"can't have (feat. steven a. clark, ape drums)","Ape Drums, Steven Clark, and yours truly. Mr. W. W. , haha!. I told you once (Can't Have). I tell you twice (Can't Have). The grass looks greener on the other side. Til you get to the other side, haha. Well you're happy now. And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so right. But I guess we always want what we can't have. You know the loneliness hurts so bad. And girl I want you back. But I guess we always want what we can't have. Can't have. Can't have. Can't have. Ohh!. I see Central Park from my hotel room. And it's got me thinking. About the crazy things we used to do. For the fame, for the power, for the fortune. Ducked prison, ducked death, I'm fortunate. It was all a dream, now I wake up and live it. Thinking that the sky was the limit. 'Til I figured out there's footprints on the moon. Now I'm like get out the way, bitch move. Papo I'm live, fuck the other side. I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die. Everybody knows that this chico gon' ride. Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die. I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die. Everybody knows that this chico gon' ride. Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die. Everybody wants what they can't have right?. Well you're happy now. And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so right. But I guess we always want what we can't have. You know the loneliness hurts so bad. And girl I want you back. But I guess we always want what we can't have. Can't have, can't have. Can't have, can't have. Can't have, can't have. Can't have, ohh!. Looking at my backyard, now all I see the ocean. Not bad for a kid that grew up with roaches. Drama, chaos, and different cultures. That's what allows me to see through these vultures. First we shined the shoes. Then we own the shoe shop. First we make the sandwich. Then we own the restaurants. First then we clean the house. Then we own every house on the block. Not bad for some immigrants. Papo I'm live, fuck the other side. I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die. Everybody knows that this chico gon' ride. Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die. I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die. Everybody knows that this chico gon' ride. Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die. Everybody wants what they can't have right?. Well you're happy now. And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so right. But I guess we always want what we can't have. You know the loneliness hurts so bad. And girl I want you back. But I guess we always want what we can't have. Can't have, can't have. Can't have, can't have. Can't have, can't have. Can't have, ohh!.

And you ain't never seen a chico in the gang this raw since pawn that could rap like this (TS). I hear them and they raps about the coke and the crack and the click to the clack, but to me it's chit chat. Blam! Motherfucker take that, now!. [Chorus]. I'ma spit it, flip it, rip it for them boys. Makin digits off the coke when they whip it. Ride a stick, double clip it. One mississippi, two mississippi, three mississipi, cock back, click it, blam!. Poppin what you think is last, what you wanna do is get found in a trunk in a lake and stankin'. I took my money from the shoebox, now I bank it. Foolish, ain't it?. [Chorus]. Fuck that club (shit). They want that thug (shit). But I ain't no thug, bitch. And I ain't no gangsta, bitch. I'm a hustler, ho. And I got no problem. If you want it you can get it 'fo I bust you.

hurry up and wait,"Hee’s baaacckk!!. To rip on this track, I’ll rip any broad. I don’t care, white or black!. Hee’s baaacckk!. If Pit’s on da job, then there’s no need to worry. Dog just hurry up and wait,. Cuz I aint Going no where anytime soon. Sick what these rappers wanna be?. That’s me, times 2. Now…. Get ready for me to take over this game. I’m cutting da flow, like I’m cutting da cane. Things will never be da same. Pause…. There’s a lick for 50 bricks. Now pause…. And think about it. Then pause…. Is it really worth it?. Then pause… pause…. FUCK YEAH!!!. I’m ready to go, jump in da ride. Get da mask, get da gloves. Cut off da lights, pop da gat. Run inside, fire’em up or tie’em up. But don’t forget to pick up da prize. And upgrade the ??. If they don’t give up da pies. Now…. I would hate to have to calm these boys down. Cuz to be honest I can’t, so Pal…. Why don’t you just give us da keys and pounds. Now Guess What He Said?. [Chorus 2x]. Ya’ll want my spot?! Hurry up and wait!. Ya’ll want me to stop?! Hurry up and wait!. Ya’ll want me shot?! Hurry up and wait!. Ya’ll hurry up and wait! Ya’ll hurry up and wait!. I’ve been brought up,. By street cats who didn’t get caught up. Like that New Jack Nino Brown at da Carter.

hustler's withdrawal,"[Verse 1]. Yo, he went from a street kid doin regular street things. Straight to a street king. Takin over the city, block by block. Breakin down bricks, servin em rock by rock. He's everything a young gun wanna grow up to be. But if only these young guns could see. That murder, money and lust, is slowly murderin us. Cause the drug game aint what it used to be. So look deeper when they paint you a picture. And try to sell you a dream, cause alot of these drug lords. Turn to the feds, and turn into fiends. The crack game aint everything its cracked up to be. Now the cat that was a neighborhood celebrity. Is coppin rocks, off the new kids on the block. At the same time, tryna school em. But these hoodlums got heads as hard as the rocks that hes doin. Hustlins like a drug, its got withdrawal symptoms. And if you know this, you wont stkip pain. But you will gain wisdom, and wisdom gains power. Dont let your life go sour over power. [Chorus 2x]. Hustlins like a drug, its addicting. The more you huste, the more you get addicted. The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction. (Its a hustlers withdrawal). If you used to push weight, you'd relate. [Verse 2]. Not only did my father used to deal the dough. He used to do the dope, used to deal. I'm just keepin it real. Now my father doesnt have shit,. I dont have shit, we dont have shit. Cause he didnt stack SHIT!. With all the money he made. He didnt think for one second to put money away. Thats cause his mind was clattered with white thoughts. He's lucky that he didnt end up outlined in white chalk. The only thing I can say I've gained from my father is. Knowledge of the street game, and I hope that yall follow this. I cant say I havent sold weed or cocaine. But I can say this, money that comes quick, leaves quick. And yall better believe this. Cause this I've lived, and witnessed. Catch a couple of charges, now your on the laws shit list. Now your forced to do business. Until this business does you of course. Cause you can die from doin dope or dealin dope. You choose the road that you get to follow. And you choose the people that you look up to as role models. [Chorus 2x]. [Verse 3]. I know about hustlers. But I wont mention no names. Cause they still got cases pending. And some are even appealing life in the cage. At least they made it past the first phase: they reached a certain age. Hustlins like ADs, at first your infected with HIV. And then its full blown, only different is. Instead of havin no immune system. You become immune to the system, of havin dough, by a dealin blow. Its a fast life, and even if you survive your mind'll die slow. Dirty money attracts dirty things. And if you plain to deal the dope, I hope your ready for the murder game. Cause thats what it brings. I'm not a preacher, I'm not tryna preach, no. I'm not a teacher, I'm not tryna teach, but. Yet like a faucet, I'm tryin to leak. Info to these youngns and their kinfolk. And let em know theres more to life than a key to coke. If you use to push weight, then you can relate, cause you've probably had a taste of. Hustlers Withdrawal. [Chorus 2x]"

With all these around me.. I got em all colors, shapes and sizes,. I'm in over my head, these women gone drown me.. Spike Lee was definitely talkin bout me when he made that movie 'Jungle Fever'.. 'Cause I like em a little bit darker. Take it from the back to the front, Rosa Parkuh. But to tell you the truth, it makes no difference. As long as they know what they doin when it's time to get busy. We can take it from the floor to the bed from the bed to the kitchen. Coffee with no cream,. That's like a rock with no fiend. Martin Luther King with no dream,. John Lennon Couldn't even imaging such a thing. And for those that don't know nothin,. Welcome to the jungle,. 'Clef tell em somethin. [Chorus - Wyclef].

You're gonna dance with me tonight. Kick up your heels and swing with me. Oh my baby. Kick up your heels and swing with me. Gonna dance with me tonight. Kick up your heels and swing with me.

I'm tryna turn you on and get you so off. These boys act like they hard but they so soft. Visa to visa, country to country. Sending here bees and the women who love me. They sayin they need me, they sayin they want me. Catch me in the Bahamas eatin Chonky Conky. Getting harder than the FK. Just so I can F that. I don't need the pope to bless that. That's what I'm here for, been there. You get up on your heels. The bass drop and the keys just won't stop. Here's the D, you're gonna dance with me tonight. Swing from here to there. Let go of all your cares. Forget your love affair. You're gonna dance with me tonight. Kick up your heels and swing with me. Oh my baby. Kick up your heels and swing with me.

Between the El Mariel and the 1980 riots, we as minorities Americans could no longer take our freedom for granted and misuse it because incase you haven’t notices we’ve gone from the El Mariel boatlift to the Hurricane Katrina bus lift with the same response.. With America standing to help us with one hand on her hips and the other one on her guns.. Like 9/11 some how made us all Americans but it took a tragedy to make us all feel like we were one.. You see the El Mariel boatlift, Hurricane Katrina and the Oklahoma bombings, we all got something in common and that’s the desire to enjoy a freedom that can not be rearranged by fear.. To let nothing stand in the way of the freedom of those who chose to live here so today is 1980 again and I’m that bus that crashed through the gates of the Peruvian embassy.. I hope that when I spit this poem the whole world will remember me.. I’m screaming like [something] give us us our free, me Pitbull and this industry."

outta nowhere (feat. danny mercer),"Sooner or later that spark just disappears. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. Everytime one of us ending up in tears. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. Is it good that we hurt every day?. Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?. Am I too blind to see. This is happening to me. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. I live the fast life, going nowhere fast. I seen my past life and politely passed. But I'm already planning on doing it big. For my life after death. And live my life after death. Baby what you think all the training is for?. Just to properly prepare you for war. So I keep you on your toes. If you look out for them friends that are really foes. This career tried to swallow us. Paparazzi tried to follow us. I'm everything that my momma was. Rider, survivor, a motherfucking fighter. Thank god for this rapping shit (thank you). Forget the cash it's about happiness. Normal life, that's for the birds. I work hard so you never say these words. Sooner or later that spark just disappears. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. Everytime one of us ending up in tears. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. Is it good that we hurt every day?. Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?. Am I too blind to see. This is happening to me. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. The critics going nowhere (nowhere). Thinking that they know me like the bible, oh hell no. But they don't understand me (oh well). Snitching is a sport now so please do tell. The world I raise hell. Yeah, I did the crime but I skip jail. I'm just trying to own teams, get it player. And dance on the globe like Fred Astaire. The world is ours baby. It's just waiting for us so don't be late. And we could both aim for the sky. And shoot for the stars and call it a date. Now you know that I know that we know. If the world wants war cock back and reload. A normal life, that's for the birds. I work hard, so you never say these words. Sooner or later that spark just disappears. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. Every time one of us ending up in tears. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. Is it good that we hurt every day?. Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?. Am I too blind to see. This is happening to me. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere"

"took my love (feat. red foo, vein & david rush)","You took my love, I thought I was the only one. You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun. You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one. You took my love, took my love. Loquita, I don't play you, you know what time it is with me. You want my heart, you got the world,. Now show me you'd ride up there for me. I can see right through your eyes, and I know what you tryin to do. You tryin to rob, steal, take my love, we fuck you. Take my love, ha ha, not a woman on earth that can do that. Say what, I don't know where you from, or where you been at. I'm letting you know what's up, and if you don't know, play by the rules. Or baby, you get cut, I talked so much, you took my love. You took my love, I thought I was the only one. You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun. You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one. You took my love, took my love. Yo, i'm in the club, and the place is poppin. Seen a sit in bar, and her face is knockin. Times are great, cuz i'm with my crew. But my smile was fake, cuz i'm missing you. Baby you know that I didn't learn my lesson. Shoulda gave you more time, more love and affection. And when I see you later with that other guy. Keep telling myself that a player ain't suppose to cry. You took my love, I thought I was the only one. You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun. You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one. You took my love, took my love. She took my love, and played me for a sucker. But it don't even matter, cuz you know I still love her. She took my heart, and threw it on the ground. But it don't even matter, cuz I still want her around. She's such a love taker, she's such a love taker. It's guaranteed that she's a professional heartbreaker. But a great lovemaker, all in a sheet. She made my heart skipped a beat. But for now she's a close as it comes. Not mags, no life and no guns. She took my love. You took my love, I thought I was the only one. You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun. You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one. You took my love, took my love. MKT-'19"

Watch this,. [verse]. Im here to remind you, just in case you forgot,. Mr 305 no label stay hot,. 38 choppers, but please no glock,. Used to move work but had no trap no block no spot,. Ma was cool with work, but no rocks,. Until she found my first nickel ruff bag,. Said i had enough shit to push a dad,. So she told me to get the fuck out the pad,. I was out to my first baby mama's crib,. Caught her fuckin' round with her wellas crib,. Thank god for music my saviour,. Thats what helped me fight xavier,. Don't believe these rappers and what they play ya,. I wanna be owner, fuck a playa,. Shit better say it,. I am an owner, bitch!. [avery storm] [bridge].

Every mornin' i woke up to the same shit,. Everybody sayin' that i ain't shit,. Them boys in the streets on that hate shit,. Them boys on the same street doin' that same shit,. Planned to move bricks, but it's 8 balls,. Y'all want me, i hate y'all but i ate y'all,. Young and stay, we realest,. I'm on my way to the show,. Gettin' paid, marvellous rates,.

wake me up (remix),"AVICII. Mr. Worldwide. I've been around the world. And I can't stop hearing this song. Felicidades pavo. I've been around the world. And I can't stop hearing this song. And I love it. Feeling my way through the darkness. Guided by a beating heart. I can't tell where the journey will end. But I know where to start. They tell me I'm too young to understand. They say I'm caught up in a dream. Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes. Well, that's fine by me. So wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself. And I didn't know I was lost. So wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself. And I didn't know I was lost. Life's not about waiting for a storm. It's about dancing in the rain. And if it rains lemons, learn how to make lemonade. It's about more than a story. No problems, just solutions. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 we have take-off, Houston. I'm not them boys that they're used to. I got 4 billi views collected on YouTube. I grew up around keys of coke and beakers. And that inspired me to be a keynote speaker. Do things guaranteed definite taxless. They say the devil's in the details and I want access. Without the maker, you got a dream and it's simple. Live it, wake up. So wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself. And I didn't know I was lost. So wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself. And I didn't know I was lost. I didn't know I was lost. I didn't know I was lost.

we are strong (feat. kiesza),"[Pitbull:]. Mr. Worldwide, I just want to welcome everybody to my life. It's heaven on earth, but it's one hell of a ride. Let's show everybody why love is a battlefield. Tell them how you feel. [Kiesza:]. We are young, heartache to heartache we stand. No promises, no demand. Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield. [Pitbull:]. Closed the Grammys and got all the credits, literally. But I'm a hustler boy, you can't rid of me. I'm not religious but my passport looks like a bible. Presidential debates unreliable. Politicians want to politick and politrick. That's why I call this shit politricks. I'm a young man, old soul. I can't listen to this new school shit. To me it's just so-so. I did my own thing, created my own lane. I may not like the players, but I love the game. I love the hustle and that's real. And that's why love is a battlefield. [Kiesza:]. We are young, heartache to heartache we stand. No promises, no demand. Love is a battlefield. We are strong. No one can tell us we're wrong. Searching our hearts for so long. Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield. [Pitbull:]. Born in Miami, Cuban boy in the '80s. Took over the game and they thought we were crazy. You name it we did, we bought it, we sipped it, we run it. Let all these public traded companies know that we're coming. David vs. Goliath, live in the flesh, Armando Perez, boy am I blessed. I learned from the worst, but listened to the best. Figure out that riddle and figure out success. I did my own thing, created my own lane. I may not like the players, but I love the game. I love the hustle and that's real. And that's why love is a battlefield. [Kiesza:]. We are young, heartache to heartache we stand. No promises, no demand. Love is a battlefield. We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong. Searching our hearts for so long. Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield"

a little story,"School ya’ll to somethin right quick. Sit down, open your ears, close your eyes, listen. Here’s a little story that I got to tell. About this Chico named Pit everyone knows so well. Illmatic like Nas but that ain’t hard to tell. Owes it all to Dade County and the ATL. Picked rap and skipped the triple beam scale. And it’s a known fact he gon’ die before he fails. These boys rap about hustlin’ but cant make bail. I call that hustling backwards and that’s real. Miami’s hot so I can vacation in hell. The way the game is shit, man, I mind as well. I look at these fools on camera flashin’ they tools. They must’ve forgot the streets got codes and rules. But me, I’m confused. ‘Cause rappers wanna be gangstas. Gangstas wanna be rappers. Ballers wanna be rappers. And rappers wanna be ballers. The truth is its more sickening than Ebola. Until they handcuff then its over. Pop up no dandruff, no neck, just head and shoulders. Bust guns, sell drugs, that’s what the streets showed us. But corporate America, that’s what they sold us"

all the things (feat. inna),"[Intro: Pitbull]. International sensation. INNA. And Mr. Worldwide, dale. [Verse: Pitbull]. I'm like a quarterback, I got options. But I play the point in school. Broke ankles, more than a few. Broke hearts, yea that too. 20 years later, same movie, same script. Same player, more chips. More women, more haters. Different toilet, same shit. Why get caught up in emotions?. Why go through the same motions. In a sick way she loves to see me mad. It gets `er wetter than the ocean. She's a good girl gone bad.

I swear I smell gunsmoke, when I inhale too deep. cause cheap lies have caused the loss of priceless lives. bush is duckin the truth while the few. and the proud dodge landmines. niggaz is doin time for gettin caught with a dime. but he will never be indicted. for his crimes against this nation. impatient with waiting it's time we fall in line. and stop, falling for the lies. the war ain't only in iraq. it's time we fight back, for control of our minds"

back in time (r3hab remix),"Black mask, black clothes. With a little bit of rope to tie. I flipped it. Black suits, white shirts. Black glasses with a matching tie. Like Agent J or Agent K. And I wish the whole world would, ok. I'm trying to make a billion out of 15 cents. Understand? Understood. I'm a go-getter, mover, shaker,. Culture, bury a border, record-breaker. Won't cha give credit where credit is due. Don't cha know that I don't give a number 2?. Y'all just halfway thoughts. Not worth the back of my mind. But to understand the future,. We have to go back in time. Baby. Oh baby. Oh baby. Oh baby. Oh baby. Go, go.... I got the globe, yeah, in the palm of my hand. Wherever I spin it, that's where I land. Let's save the world. Men In Black, I know you understand. Stop the movement, they can try if they want to. Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to. What Pit solves is a bit raw. Took like jigsaw and built it all. Despite a big loss, I'd bet it all. And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles. Y'all just halfway thoughts. Not worth the back of my mind. But to understand the future,. We have to go back in time. Baby. Oh baby. Oh baby. Oh baby. Oh baby. Go, go.... Baby. My sweet baby. My sweet baby. My sweet baby. Oh baby. Oh baby. Oh baby"

Sometimes I fell like I'm loosing it. My life is upside down. A gift and a curse that's my life now. There is no looking or turning back. I used to watch coke turn to crack. That's what made me turn to rap. I fell like keanu reeves in the movie devils advocate. Confused but blessed with extravagance. I thank god for all the opportunities. Given the opportunity dem boys would put two in me. (bla bla bla). We live in the land of the free, hustlers and thieves. I made money now I got uncle sam hustling. Me for a quarter of what I make. Hand a quarter sentence to a fake. And watch them turn state (that's right). Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Until the fed's step in (that's just the way it is). Most of these fools are characters. Men with no character welcome to america. Where we fight for freedom. If ain't about oil than we don't need them. Ain't that the truth?. Pitbull I'm just tell ya'll the way I fell. Thank god that god made me to keep it real. [chorus:]. Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is).

Till that money step in (that's just the way it is). [red eyes:]. Huh hun yo. After the turf war the smoke clears. All these years around these busta. I'm convinced there ain't no hope here. In the past four years of my lifetime. I witness leaders sacrifice freedom just to get this pipeline. Guess I'm chosen at the right time mama stress. Facing the table and she's snorting up white line. Blood is thicker than water. In a few cases your daughter. Can have touched for the money that in dem suit case. Tighten my shoelaces the fugitive running. In fear of a criminal past cuz dem folks is coming. I've been wrongfully judged being from this environment. The city gangs planning retirement. I'mma a dade nigga. Voicing my set cuz a spray quick. Took some of the same steps. Through little haiti as these main nigga (like who). Hit man, big dogg, and shehound. Ya'll predict it back then shit I see it know. [chorus:]. Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Until the fed's step in (that just the way it is ). Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Till that fame step in (that's just the way it is). Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Till dem bitches step in (that's just the way it is). Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Till that money step in (that's just the way it is). [pitbull:]. I escape poverty (poverty). I don't own jewelry motherfucker I own property. You can send dem tsunamis that hit indonesia (but but but). Ain't no motherfucking thing stopping me. Like good coke I'm a good swimmer. God knows I done lost but god dam I'm a good winner. It feels great to make something out of nothing yea. I'm humble but I tell ya'll to push a chico's buttons. And watch how them thing get to dumping. Real-estate new york game now you saying something. I only talk about what I know about. Illegal turn legal this year that's what I'm all about. I'm from the south and I ain't gonna lie. At fist time I preach ye till god struck me with pride. I was confused now I'm like let's ride. 305 Till I die. 305 Till I die. Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Until the fed's step in (that just the way it is). Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Till that fame step in (that's just the way it is). Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is). Till dem bitches step in (that's just the way it is).

And it's got me thinking. About the crazy things we used to do. For the fame, for the power, for the fortune. Ducked prison, ducked death, I'm fortunate. It was all a dream, now I wake up and live it. Thinking that the sky was the limit. 'Til I figured out there's footprints on the moon. Now I'm like get out the way, bitch move.

That's what allows me to see through these vultures. First we shined the shoes. Then we own the shoe shop. First we make the sandwich. Then we own the restaurants. First then we clean the house. Then we own every house on the block. Not bad for some immigrants. Papo I'm live, fuck the other side. I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die. Everybody knows that this chico gon' ride. Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die. I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die. Everybody knows that this chico gon' ride. Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die.

hurry up and wait,"Hee’s baaacckk!!. To rip on this track, I’ll rip any broad. I don’t care, white or black!. Hee’s baaacckk!. If Pit’s on da job, then there’s no need to worry. Dog just hurry up and wait,. Cuz I aint Going no where anytime soon. Sick what these rappers wanna be?. That’s me, times 2. Now…. Get ready for me to take over this game. I’m cutting da flow, like I’m cutting da cane. Things will never be da same. Pause…. There’s a lick for 50 bricks. Now pause…. And think about it. Then pause…. Is it really worth it?. Then pause… pause…. FUCK YEAH!!!. I’m ready to go, jump in da ride. Get da mask, get da gloves. Cut off da lights, pop da gat. Run inside, fire’em up or tie’em up. But don’t forget to pick up da prize. And upgrade the ??. If they don’t give up da pies. Now…. I would hate to have to calm these boys down. Cuz to be honest I can’t, so Pal…. Why don’t you just give us da keys and pounds. Now Guess What He Said?. [Chorus 2x]. Ya’ll want my spot?! Hurry up and wait!. Ya’ll want me to stop?! Hurry up and wait!. Ya’ll want me shot?! Hurry up and wait!. Ya’ll hurry up and wait! Ya’ll hurry up and wait!. I’ve been brought up,. By street cats who didn’t get caught up. Like that New Jack Nino Brown at da Carter. I’m da new Tony Montana, only I’m just a. Little bit smarter!"
hustler's withdrawal,"[Verse 1]. Yo, he went from a street kid doin regular street things. Straight to a street king. Takin over the city, block by block. Breakin down bricks, servin em rock by rock. He's everything a young gun wanna grow up to be. But if only these young guns could see. That murder, money and lust, is slowly murderin us. Cause the drug game aint what it used to be. So look deeper when they paint you a picture. And try to sell you a dream, cause alot of these drug lords. Turn to the feds, and turn into fiends. The crack game aint everything its cracked up to be. Now the cat that was a neighborhood celebrity. Is coppin rocks, off the new kids on the block. At the same time, tryna school em. But these hoodlums got heads as hard as the rocks that hes doin. Hustlins like a drug, its got withdrawal symptoms. And if you know this, you wont stkip pain. But you will gain wisdom, and wisdom gains power. Dont let your life go sour over power. [Chorus 2x]. Hustlins like a drug, its addicting. The more you huste, the more you get addicted. The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction. (Its a hustlers withdrawal). If you used to push weight, you'd relate. [Verse 2]. Not only did my father used to deal the dough. He used to do the dope, used to deal. I'm just keepin it real. Now my father doesnt have shit,. I dont have shit, we dont have shit. Cause he didnt stack SHIT!. With all the money he made. He didnt think for one second to put money away. Thats cause his mind was clattered with white thoughts. He's lucky that he didnt end up outlined in white chalk. The only thing I can say I've gained from my father is. Knowledge of the street game, and I hope that yall follow this. I cant say I havent sold weed or cocaine. But I can say this, money that comes quick, leaves quick. And yall better believe this. Cause this I've lived, and witnessed. Catch a couple of charges, now your on the laws shit list. Now your forced to do business. Until this business does you of course. Cause you can die from doin dope or dealin dope. You choose the road that you get to follow. And you choose the people that you look up to as role models. [Chorus 2x]. [Verse 3]. I know about hustlers. But I wont mention no names. Cause they still got cases pending. And some are even appealing life in the cage. At least they made it past the first phase: they reached a certain age. Hustlins like ADs, at first your infected with HIV. And then its full blown, only different is. Instead of havin no immune system. You become immune to the system, of havin dough, by a dealin blow. Its a fast life, and even if you survive your mind'll die slow. Dirty money attracts dirty things. And if you plain to deal the dope, I hope your ready for the murder game. Cause thats what it brings. I'm not a preacher, I'm not tryna preach, no. I'm not a teacher, I'm not tryna teach, but. Yet like a faucet, I'm tryin to leak. Info to these youngns and their kinfolk. And let em know theres more to life than a key to coke. If you use to push weight, then you can relate, cause you've probably had a taste of. Hustlers Withdrawal. [Chorus 2x]"

But she want me, she know I know it. And I want her I know she knows it. I wanna have fun; play. Promise if you stay, stay. I’m a rock your world. I’m a rock your world. I’m a rock your world like a porno star. I’m a rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your world like a porno star. I’m a rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your world like a porno star.

outro,"A 1980 exodus of 125,000 dreams, a quest to find out what freedom really means at any cost.. Boat loads of Cubans lost in a maze of red tape and hate, entered this country through the bottom of the united states and straight set up shop.. As Arthur McDuffie was being beat to death by four white cops this world was about to face the music.. Between the El Mariel and the 1980 riots, we as minorities Americans could no longer take our freedom for granted and misuse it because incase you haven’t notices we’ve gone from the El Mariel boatlift to the Hurricane Katrina bus lift with the same response.. With America standing to help us with one hand on her hips and the other one on her guns.. Like 9/11 some how made us all Americans but it took a tragedy to make us all feel like we were one.. You see the El Mariel boatlift, Hurricane Katrina and the Oklahoma bombings, we all got something in common and that’s the desire to enjoy a freedom that can not be rearranged by fear.. To let nothing stand in the way of the freedom of those who chose to live here so today is 1980 again and I’m that bus that crashed through the gates of the Peruvian embassy.. I hope that when I spit this poem the whole world will remember me.. I’m screaming like [something] give us us our free, me Pitbull and this industry."

outta nowhere (feat. danny mercer),"Sooner or later that spark just disappears. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. Everytime one of us ending up in tears. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. Is it good that we hurt every day?. Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?. Am I too blind to see. This is happening to me. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. I live the fast life, going nowhere fast. I seen my past life and politely passed. But I'm already planning on doing it big. For my life after death. And live my life after death. Baby what you think all the training is for?. Just to properly prepare you for war. So I keep you on your toes. If you look out for them friends that are really foes. This career tried to swallow us. Paparazzi tried to follow us. I'm everything that my momma was. Rider, survivor, a motherfucking fighter. Thank god for this rapping shit (thank you). Forget the cash it's about happiness. Normal life, that's for the birds. I work hard so you never say these words. Sooner or later that spark just disappears. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. Everytime one of us ending up in tears. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. Is it good that we hurt every day?. Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?. Am I too blind to see. This is happening to me. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. The critics going nowhere (nowhere). Thinking that they know me like the bible, oh hell no. But they don't understand me (oh well). Snitching is a sport now so please do tell. The world I raise hell. Yeah, I did the crime but I skip jail. I'm just trying to own teams, get it player. And dance on the globe like Fred Astaire. The world is ours baby. It's just waiting for us so don't be late. And we could both aim for the sky. And shoot for the stars and call it a date. Now you know that I know that we know. If the world wants war cock back and reload. A normal life, that's for the birds. I work hard, so you never say these words. Sooner or later that spark just disappears. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. Every time one of us ending up in tears. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere. Is it good that we hurt every day?. Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?. Am I too blind to see. This is happening to me. Outta nowhere, outta nowhere"

raindrops,"Anjuli Star,. Pitbull. this dedicated to everybody who lost somebody important in their life, dont worry their in a better place now.. (Anjuli Stars). I fear not what the future holds. But more what the future unfolds. Cus I'm dying each time that I breathe in life without you (yeah). Every hour solemn I need you. Undevoured I'm falling now what can I do. There's so much to give. If only I had my hands to fix what you did. So I hold it inside watch as it dies. I can't even look at the sky its burning my eyes. Similar to cigarette smoke I wish I could float far away from here. (Chorus). Raindrops. I hope one day that this pain stops (no no). Raindrops. I hope one day that this pain stops. Washing me away. Washing me away. Washing me away. Washing me away. (Pitbull). I miss you dad. Still dealing with my the death of my father. Still dealing with the death of my best friend. Eddie I'm a miss you dog. But you know that I'm a ride to the end (I love you). I didn't cry when you died. But im a let my tears fall on the track. My brother yula just came home. And it feels good to have him back. (Welcome home dog). See everything happens for a reason. You don't know what you had till its gone. That's why im a take advantage of the fact im breathin. And the words of this song are. Dedicated to eddie and maria. But I know in the future Im a see ya. I know your both looking down on me , proud. I know ya both love me. (chorus). Raindrops. I hope one day that this pain stops (no no). Raindrops. I hope one day that this pain stops. Washing me away. Washing me away. Washing me away. Washing me away. See in life things go wrong. If it don't kill you its only goin make you strong. So you must hold on. If everything was right then theres something wrong. Ironic aint it thats just the way life is. That's why I thank god every chance that I get for blessing me. With beautiful kids. What's victory with no laws. What's smiling with no tears. Whats love with no hate. Whats courage with no fears. Just think about it and apply to your life. And no matter what the problem is. Don't worry baby keep your head up. Its goin be alright. (chorus)"

"took my love (feat. red foo, vein & david rush)","You took my love, I thought I was the only one. You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun. You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one. You took my love, took my love. Loquita, I don't play you, you know what time it is with me. You want my heart, you got the world,. Now show me you'd ride up there for me. I can see right through your eyes, and I know what you tryin to do. You tryin to rob, steal, take my love, we fuck you. Take my love, ha ha, not a woman on earth that can do that. Say what, I don't know where you from, or where you been at. I'm letting you know what's up, and if you don't know, play by the rules. Or baby, you get cut, I talked so much, you took my love. You took my love, I thought I was the only one. You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun. You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one. You took my love, took my love. Yo, i'm in the club, and the place is poppin. Seen a sit in bar, and her face is knockin. Times are great, cuz i'm with my crew. But my smile was fake, cuz i'm missing you. Baby you know that I didn't learn my lesson. Shoulda gave you more time, more love and affection. And when I see you later with that other guy. Keep telling myself that a player ain't suppose to cry. You took my love, I thought I was the only one. You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun. You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one. You took my love, took my love. She took my love, and played me for a sucker. But it don't even matter, cuz you know I still love her. She took my heart, and threw it on the ground. But it don't even matter, cuz I still want her around. She's such a love taker, she's such a love taker. It's guaranteed that she's a professional heartbreaker. But a great lovemaker, all in a sheet. She made my heart skipped a beat. But for now she's a close as it comes. Not mags, no life and no guns. She took my love. You took my love, I thought I was the only one. You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun. You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one. You took my love, took my love. MKT-'19"

wake me up (remix),"AVICII. Mr. Worldwide. I've been around the world. And I can't stop hearing this song. Felicidades pavo. I've been around the world. And I can't stop hearing this song. And I love it. Feeling my way through the darkness. Guided by a beating heart. I can't tell where the journey will end. But I know where to start. They tell me I'm too young to understand. They say I'm caught up in a dream. Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes. Well, that's fine by me. So wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself. And I didn't know I was lost. So wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself. And I didn't know I was lost. Life's not about waiting for a storm. It's about dancing in the rain. And if it rains lemons, learn how to make lemonade. It's about more than a story. No problems, just solutions. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 we have take-off, Houston. I'm not them boys that they're used to. I got 4 billi views collected on YouTube. I grew up around keys of coke and beakers. And that inspired me to be a keynote speaker. Do things guaranteed definite taxless. They say the devil's in the details and I want access. Without the maker, you got a dream and it's simple. Live it, wake up. So wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself. And I didn't know I was lost. So wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself. And I didn't know I was lost. I didn't know I was lost. I didn't know I was lost.

[Pitbull:]. Closed the Grammys and got all the credits, literally. But I'm a hustler boy, you can't rid of me. I'm not religious but my passport looks like a bible. Presidential debates unreliable. Politicians want to politick and politrick. That's why I call this shit politricks. I'm a young man, old soul. I can't listen to this new school shit. To me it's just so-so. I did my own thing, created my own lane. I may not like the players, but I love the game. I love the hustle and that's real. And that's why love is a battlefield. [Kiesza:]. We are young, heartache to heartache we stand. No promises, no demand. Love is a battlefield. We are strong. No one can tell us we're wrong. Searching our hearts for so long. Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield. [Pitbull:]. Born in Miami, Cuban boy in the '80s. Took over the game and they thought we were crazy. You name it we did, we bought it, we sipped it, we run it. Let all these public traded companies know that we're coming. David vs. Goliath, live in the flesh, Armando Perez, boy am I blessed. I learned from the worst, but listened to the best. Figure out that riddle and figure out success. I did my own thing, created my own lane. I may not like the players, but I love the game. I love the hustle and that's real. And that's why love is a battlefield. [Kiesza:]. We are young, heartache to heartache we stand. No promises, no demand. Love is a battlefield.

To show 'em what it is when you hustle and you work hard. Show 'em what it is, to put your life on the lind for the love of the grind. Life is a rhyme with no reason, and that's the reason I rhyme. But once I show the globe. I just wanna know. [Jamie Foxx]. Where do we go from here. World tell me please. Where do we go from here. I want the world to tell me please. [Chorus].
