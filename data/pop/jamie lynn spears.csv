big bad world,"I fell hard for a boy one time, I cant say if it was love. Maybe it was how he wore his hat, or just because he had a truck. I ran down a dock and jumped in the boat. I gave that boy my heart. It was back in the time. When I thought you could buy a new one at the wal-mart. Oooooh, it's a big bad world. Oooooh, for a small town girl. I do my time in the Starbucks line giving up to chase the dream. I hear yes and I hear no but it's hard, oh in between. I feel a little homesick, to talk to someone who knows my name. I dig out a dollar for the homeless man. But I'm the one that could use the change. Oooooh, it's a big bad world. Oooooh, for a small town girl. I remember wondering what was out there. Beyond this small town, passed down simple plains. The city sure feels like the middle of nowhere. There's no-one here to remind me who I am. Oooooh, it's a big bad world. Oooooh, for a small town girl. Ooooh, it's a big bad world. Ooooh, for a small town girl"

Make you second-guess the things you left behind. I had to walk away from that revolving door. It only takes me right back to where I was before. But who has time for that. Tell me who has time for that. When the lights go out and I struggle with the silence. Hunted by the crying till morning comes around. And I know someday on the other side of crying. It won't feel the way it does right now. When the lights go out. It's going to be okay soon we will both be sleeping safe and sound. When the lights go out and I struggle with the silence. Hunted by the crying till morning comes around. And I know someday on the other side of crying. It won't feel the way it does right now. When the lights go out
