be as you are,"Virginia Woolf and poetry. No one seemed to notice me. Being young was getting so old. Cheap beer and cigarettes. Life was like a movie set. And I seemed to be given no role. But in times of trouble. I can turn to my mother. And I know that she gon' understand. So at age 18. I cried to my mother. And she told me, ""young man"". ""There are moments when you fall to the ground. But you are stronger than you feel you are now. You don't always have to speak so loud, no. Just be as you are. Life is not always a comfortable ride. Everybody's got scars that they hide. And everybody plays the fool sometimes, yeah. Just be as you are"". They played me on the radio. And everything was changing, so. I thought I was all the way grown. But I can still remember in that cold November. When I realized I'm all alone. But in times of trouble. I can turn to my mother. And I know that she gon' understand. So at age 22. I cried to my mother. And she told me, ""young man"". ""There are moments when you fall to the ground. But you are stronger than you feel you are now. You don't always have to speak so loud, no. Just be as you are. It doesn't matter if you become some star. Life is better when you open your heart. You don't always have to act so hard, no. Just be as you are"". If I'm speaking truthfully. I'm not who I used to be. And I know some people might laugh. Cause my music doesn't sound the same. And my head's no longer shaved. I'm worried if I'm on the right path. But in times of trouble. I can turn to my mother. And I know that she gon' understand. So at age 26. I spoke to my mother. And she told me, ""young man"". ""There are moments when you fall to the ground. But you are stronger than you feel you are now. You don't always have to speak so loud, no. Just be as you are. It doesn't matter if you become some star. Life is better when you open your heart. You don't always have to act so hard, no. Just be as you are"". Be as you are"

It is meant to be listened to without. texting, without emailing, without outside distraction of any sort. If at this time you are unable to devote 40 minutes of undivided. attention, I politely ask you turn this off and return at a later time. It's hard to describe how I feel right now.

miley cyrus,"[Verse 1]. When I was a young man I carried my pack. And lived the free life of the rover. I smoked on sativa, guitar on my back. And played my little songs all over. [Pre-Chorus 1]. But in 2010, my country said: ""son. It's time to stop rambling, there's work to be done"". And they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun. And they shipped me away to the war. [Chorus]. And the Dj played Miley Cyrus. A Party in the Usa. And the Dj played Miley Cyrus. And we flew to the Afghan that day. [Verse 2]. I remember the day our orders came in. I was scared and my stomach was sinking. And when Martinez got shot, I cried with my gun. And I fired right back without blinking. [Pre-Chorus 2]. And we moved down the range, we pumped ourselves well. We chased them with bullets. And we showered them with shells. And in ten minutes flood we blown them to hell. I thought of my mom in Atlanta. [Chorus]. Cause she always loved Miley Cyrus. A Party In The Usa. Though the words seemed to take on new meaning. As I turned nineteen on that day. [Verse 3]. I looked at my brothers who'd once been young boys. And their eyes have gone black from the slaughters. And for ten weary weeks I kept myself for life. As we moved down the range towards the water. [Pre-Chorus 3]. But then one day a shell knocked my ass over head. And when I woked up in my hospital bed. And when I saw what it had done I wished I was dead. I never knew there were worse things than dying. [Chorus]. And the nurses hummed Miley Cyrus. As the doctors explained what was wrong. Yeah, the nurses hummed Miley Cyrus. But I no longer cared for that song. [Verse 4]. They collected the wounded, the crippled, the maimed. And they sent us all home to Atlanta. The armless, the legless, the blind and the insane. I wore fatigues and a blood red bandana. [Pre-Chorus 4]. We landed on the same runway we'd lefted on February. And when I looked down where my legs used to be. I thanked God that no one was waiting for me. To grieve and to mourn and to pity. [End-Chorus]. And the Dj played Miley Cyrus, again. A Party In The Usa. And no one cheered they just stared at us. And slowly turned their heads away. Yes, they slowly turned their heads away"
"mirror's edge (feat. bun b, glc, xv)","[Chorus:]. It feels like I'm running on walls. And I don't want to touch the ground. If they say that I'm lost. Then I don't want to be found.

It's a getting green, but I can't wake up. Sitting in a bank, but I can't take up. Don't want my girl, but I can't break up. Cuz my every day life, I don't want to shake up. Feel the earth wake up. Wont stay still. Haters all around, but I wont stay trill. All up in my face trying to show their skill. Say they don't love, but I know they will. Before the show is over and the lights go out. After I rec on the mic show out. Married to the mob, so wives throw out. Game all over that's right blow out. What you know about getting raise. We'd done thought of life fifteen ways. So blaze up the end oh. While I'm sitting on the ceiling with the j's on the window. [Chorus:]. It feels like I'm running on walls. And I don't want to touch the ground. If they say that I'm lost.

Seven in the alley, I took that risk. Runnin in a circle. Runnin out of town. South side nigga just wanna flip me. Rich mothafucker thats all that is. I survived that now I feel like this. [Chorus:].

Trying to make it home on another lonely flight. Because I'm runnin, runnin trying to my way. But there's nothing, nothing, noting. I can say to find you on theses day. [Verse:]. Mirrors on my walls. In my new apartment. I never touch the floor. I'm like a lattice carpet. I'm feeling like a star. But I'm remaining careless. Cuz I can run on walls like I am Lucy Ballise. They be saying I'm the next. And I'm just hoping that is true. I took my number got in line. Just hoping I ain't number two. So, you ask how I feel. I'm fine. You ask about the deal in time. Cuz the boy from Kansas ran on the ground. On enough now. [Chorus:]. It feels like I'm running on walls (yeah). And I don't want to touch the ground. I don't want to touch the ground.

my light,"All I wanted was a record deal. A couple dollars when I got it. I couldn't understand. Why I still had all my problems. All alone, couldn't find no help. And the stage ain't a good place to find yourself. So I started lifting weights. Hoping if I got bigger. All my confidence would too. Didn't work, go figure. Big ole' chest, hole in my heart. I even bought a chain. With ice to glow in the dark. But it didn't work though. Interrupt my work flow. And them niggas talked shit. And I took it personal. But today, I feel like. Someone answered my prayers. I know it's coming now so it's cool. Let's peel off a layer. To what's underneath. What makes the real me?. I want you to see. Ma ma ma ma ma pain, my struggle. My story, my life. My heart, my spirit. My time, my fight. My flaws, my errors. My god, my life. My heart, my spirit. My time, my light. My light. Light light light. Light light light. Ma ma ma ma ma light. Light light light. Light light light. What is meant to be will be, all the rest we'll see. All the rest we'll see. Had to dream up new dreams. Cause I'm livin out my dreams. Alright. Let's just say it was a new beginning. I followed my heart and now I'm winning winning winning. Like I'm supposed to. Like I'm made for. Sean told me, we still the same brah. All I know is God made me good. At writing songs. If you chase the wrong shit your whole life wrong. But it didn't work though, interrupt your work flow. I was on the wrong path, spinning round in circles. But today I feel like someone answered my prayers. I know it's comin' out so it's cool. Let's peel off a layer. To what's underneath. What makes the real me?. I want you to see. Ma ma ma ma ma pain, my struggle. My story, my life. My heart, my spirit. My time, my fight. My flaws, my errors. My god, my life. My heart, my spirit.

noah's ark,"Open your eyes. Make room for a little sweet love. The Lord is all around you, child. And that's what you're made of. Remember: there is a light. And it shines bright just for you. And you can't cut yourself off from it. No matter what you do. I had a 3. 5 at Duke. And I was blowin up. Three albums, I got a row of ducks. When my dad was 22. Dog he drove a truck. January in Detroit is cold as fuck. You know its tough. But I came this far I ain't slowin up. Livin life with the lebron james shoulder shrug. One thing you'll never hear me say is ""close enough"". I'm dope as fuck. I lost 2018 to a broken heart. I wrote this whole thing, I know my part. I made a wild fire from a glowing spark. I press go in March, I gotta go and march. All previous conceptions are blown apart. Not everyone can come with me it's Noah's Ark. I Ain't Gregg Popovich, I have no remark. These are the type riches one can only hold in heart. And anyone that's gone over my history. Knows I ain't stuck in the mold of the industry. I am walking down a road of epiphanies. Three words: Growth Over Consistency. Back again, they've been tapping out, McGregor. I've been tapping in. Livin out the dreams I was once just imagining. It's happening, I get so much work done nowadays. It's almost like I have a twin. I can't just sit on the couch. Shoveling shit in my mouth. I don't know how I'm gonna walk across this country. But I know I'm a figure it out. And who knows what I'm gonna do when it's done. Hopefully, I touch a life: you can be one. I'm not walking to show people who l am. I'm walking to find out who I'll become. The people ain't stupid, they know what's real. Sometime to get to heaven, we gotta go through hell. And I'm rollin' deep, no Adele. You can ask World Wide Wes, dawg, he knows me well. My life's like an instruction manual. How to not be borin' (Not be borin'). It's my spirit, my smile. That have got me soarin'. It broke my heart to tell the band. We would not be tourin'. But I just gotta do this (I gotta do it). I can't stop explorin'. I was a short lil' Jewish kid, I ain't speak much. My whole life now somethin' that I've dreamed up. With no handout, I look at my heros and. That's what I am now. Yoga class headband now. People say I'm off-brand, how. I am a brand, therefore. Anything I do is on-brand now, I'm on-brand now. People got attached to a version of me. And it hurts when they see a person who's free. But I'm so grateful for all of these lessons. Twice as much money, half the possessions. No drugs, now the vision's clear. People mad 'cause the old me isn't here. All my gold jewelry just disappeared. That's the universe tellin' me to start switchin' gears. The deeper the human, the deeper the songs. Look at my life, the dream isn't gone. I saw all of this two years ago. It's almost like it was me readin' my poem. People copy but they copy wrong. Puttin' out a bunch of sloppy songs. If I die and the Rockies don't. Forget to bury me with Petoskey stone. And opportunities keep on poppin' up. Killer concepts come to me in shavasana. This is just an intro, a daydream. The rest comes January 18th. Open your eyes. Make room for a little sweet love. The Lord is all around you, child. And that's what you're made of. Remember. There is a light. And it shines bright just for you. You can't cut yourself off from it. No matter what you do, no. Open your eyes"

Till touch down brings me round again to find. I'm not the man they think I am at home. Oh no no no I'm a rocket man. Eh, eh I'm a rocket man. Yeah I'm a rocket man. I'm a rocket man. [Bun B:]. Huston we got some problems. I don't know how your boy gonna solve them. The command center just won't leak. And it counts us down. I don't know what to think. Happening in a blink. Sorta like the big Bang. How did something so small. Urn in to a big thing. One small move turn in to a big chain. Don't waste no trouble. I'll make range. And it seems so strange, but it all makes sense. My back against the wall. End-up behind the fence. Situations always get so tense. And I just want us to still be friends. But we just argue, fuss and fight. And we scream and yell and we curse all night. And it seems that we're always so uptight. Think that it's time that I book this flight. To calm my mind. But I feel so weak. So much to say but I just can't speak. Gotta be dumb, but I can; t even do it. Came as a surprise, but we always knew it. So I'm taking this trip, no plane no car. Might be close and it might be far. But lady soon, when you look up at the moon. I'll be next to it shining like a star. [Chorus:]. I think it's gonna be a long long time. Till touch down brings me round again to find. I'm not the man they think I am at home. Oh no no no I'm a rocket man"
rolling in the deep,"There's a fire starting in my heart,. Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark,. Finally, I can see you crystal clear,.

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark,. The scars of your love remind me of us,. They keep me thinking that we almost had it all,. The scars of your love, they leave me breathless,.

And you played it to the beat,. (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),. Could have had it all,. Rolling in the deep,. You had my heart inside of your hands,. But you played it with a beating,. Throw your soul through every open door,. Count your blessings to find what you look for,. Turn my sorrow into treasured gold,. You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown,. (You're gonna wish you never had met me),. We could have had it all,. (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),. We could have had it all,. (You're gonna wish you never had met me),. It all, it all, it all,. (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),. We could have had it all,. (You're gonna wish you never had met me),. Rolling in the deep,.

smoke and drive,"[Chorus:]. Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'ma light one up. Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt.

You don't put this type of pimp in your swish. Get it we smoking on that poison call it Michael Bivins. So if you selling to me then you gotta lucrative business.

Take a ride downtown man I'm higher than these skyscapers. Roll the windows up tryna get my smoke on. 2 in the morning still riding with my Locs on. Fuck the police what these pigs gon' tell me. Smoking bud at nights like X off a Bentley. [Chorus:]. Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'ma light one up. Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt.

song about you,"Put all your stuff in a box in my room. I don't wanna write no song about you. But you show up in everything that I do. Ooh, ooh-ooh. Since you've been gone, ain't got nothin' to do. I sleep until noon, I wake up and feel bad. I think I miss somethin' I never had. Ooh, ooh-ooh. I just wanna unwind, unwind. Everything that makes me feel confined. Sometimes I hate sunshine. Sometimes I hate sunshine. Put all your stuff in a box in my room. I don't wanna write no song about you. But you show up in everything that I do. Ooh, ooh-ooh. Now it's a cold war, who will call first?. Try to be productive at work, I just can't. I miss you a lot, but I ain't comin' back. Ooh, ooh-ooh. I just wanna unwind, unwind. Everything that makes me feel confined. Sometimes I hate sunshine. Sometimes I hate sunshine. Put all your stuff in a box in my room. I don't wanna write no song about you. But you show up in everything that I do. Ooh, ooh-ooh. Yeah, yeah. All your love letters and a pair of Ray-Bans. I'm growin' my beard, movin' back in my van. Your side of the bed still smells like you though. And these memories of us, it's brutal. You know, you know exactly how I feel. We broke up, but you be on my mind still. And the worst type of sadness you could have. Is when you miss somethin' that doesn't miss you back. Put all your stuff in a box in my room. I don't wanna write no song about you.

Another day rolls by. It's getting harder not to think about. All the things on my mind. Like, I remember this time last year. I was all alone. I felt like I was two feet tall. Now there's a hundred million numbers. Inside of my phone. But I still got no one to call. My life's like. [Chorus]. My friends keep telling me. How much they believe in me. I wish that I saw the things that they see in me. [Hook]. [Chorus]. [Big Sean:]. My life's like. My life's like. Ay, do it, ay, music, ay. High rise, elevator life. I'm gone in 60 seconds. Or Talladega nights. I know I'm living wrong. I wish I could make it right. But baby, hold that thought.... Cause I gotta take this flight. When I leave my passport. Overseas passports. Hotels with the glass floors. Everything I ask for. Fast cars, fast hoes. My whole life is fast foward. But if I stop, stop. I might hit that dashboard. And I be, I be. I be, I be always take and choose. In and out relations with. Girls who want relationships. And I can fake a smile. And I end a conversation well. We just can't see eye to eye. We might need that LASIK shit. Cause tomorrow I'll be gone gone gone. Dip into another time zone zone zone. Tryna make my hotel feel like home home home. Phone won't stop ringing but I still feel all alone. My life's like. [chorus]. (Move it up, bring it up, bring it up, up up. Bring it up, bring it up, move it up, up up...)"
staring at the fire,"I've always had trouble staying still. I stand next to what I hate just for the thrill. Spent the first quarter of my life on a million dollar bill. 'Cause I can't stop staring at the fire. We got our crosses and our buildings, built 'em tall. And my book's another brick inside the wall. We sure make ourselves feel busy, but we don't do much at all. Except sit around and stare at the fire. And the protesters have gathered in the streets. Opposite, a block full of police. But they both have the same problem with God as you and me. It's that they can't stop staring at the fire. Watch it burn, burn, burn. Watch it burn, burn, burn. Watch it burn, burn, burn. Watch it burn, burn, burn. Went to an ashram a million miles from here. An old man on a blanket appeared. He waved me to come closer, and he whispered in my ear. ""Son, you've got to stop staring at the fire"". But all my ego trips come in flocks. And they tell me, ""Kid, it's really not that hot"". Take your anxiety and your guilt, just throw it all on top. Now I can't stop standing in the fire. Oh, watch me burn, burn, burn. Watch me burn, burn, burn. Watch me burn, burn, burn. Watch me burn, burn, burn. Oh, watch me burn, burn, burn. Watch me burn, burn, burn. Watch me burn, burn, burn. Watch me burn, burn, burn"

And girl, I miss the way it used to be. Look at you. You got the life, the pretty house. But you must still think about. The way it used to be. Is it real?. He don't love you like I do. Can we just go back to. The way it used to be. Even stars they fade. And colors turn to grey. I miss yesterday. And the way it used to be. And I can't turn back time. Even if I tried. I miss you tonight. And girl, I miss the way it used to be. And girl, I miss the way. Look at us. Just look what we've become. Just a shell of what was once. The way it used to be. Even stars they fade. And colors turn to grey. I miss yesterday. And the way it used to be. And I can't turn back time. Even if I tried. I miss you tonight. And girl, I miss the way it used to be.
