best of 2013 mashup,"[Dalton:]. Right from the start you were a thief you stole my heart. And I your willing victim. I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty. And with every touch you fixed them. [Cole & Gabe:]. Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep. Dreamin' about the things that we could be. But baby I've been, I've been playing hard. Said no more counting dollars. We'll be, we'll be counting stars. [Will:]. I really wanna love somebody. I really wanna dance the night away (I love the way you make me feel). I know we're only half way there (I love the way you make me feel). But you take me all the way, you take me all the way (I love the way you make me feel). [Cole:]. And we danced all night to the best song ever (I really wanna love somebody). We knew every line now I can't remember (I think about you every single day). How it goes but I won't forget her (I know we're only half way there). Cause we dance all night (You take me all the way, you take me all the way). [Dana:]. (2 chains!). Treasure. That is what you are. Honey you're my golden star (she's up all night 'till the sun). I think you can make my wish come true (I'm up all night to get some). (She's up all night for good fun). If you let me treasure you (I'm up all night to get lucky). (Just hold on we're going home). Oh... Oh... OOhh! (Just hold on we're going home). [Gabe:]. I hate these blurred lines. I know you want it (It's going down...). I know you want it (I'm yellin' timber). You're a good girl. But you're a good girl. The way you grab me must wanna get nasty. Go ahead. Get at me. [Cole:]. I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone. I crashed my car into the bridge. I watched it let it burn. I threw you stuff into a bag and pushed it down the stairs. I crashed my car into the bridge. [Dana:]. I came in like a wreaking ball (why are you my clarity). I never hit so hard in love. All I wanted was you break your walls (why are you my clarity). All you ever did was wr-e-eck me. I came in like a wrecking ball (not sure how to feel about it). Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung (somethin' in the way you move). You left me crashin' in a blazing fall (makes me feel like I can't live without it). All you ever did was wr-e-eck me (I want you to say). [Dalton:]. I feel it in my bones. enough to make my system blow (like the city can't hold us). Welcome to the new age, to the new age, welcome to the new age to the new age (like the city can't hold us). [Gabe:]. We can't stop. And we won't stop. Can't you see it's we who own the night. Can't you see it's we who 'bout that light. And we can't stop (crystal Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece). And we won't stop (jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash). We run things, things don't run we (we don't care). [Cole:]. Only got 20 dollars in my pocket. [Dalton:].

I want you back"
