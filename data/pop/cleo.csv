cloud,"I'm not the pain inside of me. I'm not the joy I get to see. I'm never what I used to be. Life is setting me free. You like to change what's wrong with me. But I like the feel of being me. I like the freedom that it brings. I won't confine myself to this. This truth you think that you have found. Try pushing me around. I'll knock you out, it's my round. Just crawl back to where you've been found. You just can't reach my cloud. And I don't wanna come down. I don't wanna come down. My deal is too profound. And you can't bring this down. No, you ain't bringing me down. I don't wanna come down. No, I'm not coming down. This shit is real profound. It's where I like beat down. I am the wolf that live within. And I just can't live the lie you live. Perfection is not my thing, you see. Keep changing constantly. 'Cause I'm not just pain inside of me. And I'm not just joy I get to see. I'm here to be all I can be. Life always find a way to be. This truth you think that you have found. Won't pushing me around. I'll knock you out, it's my round. Just crawl back to where you've been found. You just can't reach my cloud. And I don't wanna come down. No, I don't wanna come down. No, I'm not coming down. My deal is too profound. And you ain't bring this down. You ain't bringing me down. This shit is real profound. If you don't wanna drown. Crawl back to where you've been found. Crawl back to where you've been found. Crawl back to where you've been found. You just can't reach my cloud. And I don't wanna come down"
impulses,"I'll try anything to. Put my heart at ease. I just can't stand the pain. And I'm drinking to put. My demons to sleep. They'll made me loose the race. But I'm feeling like I've detoured the path. I was always so close but never getting there. And now that I can see through this mess. I'm trying to catch the pace. But my mind's just regrets. Cause all my impulses. Call for affection. And I just can't stop. Oh my impulses. Drive all my actions. Please make it stop. Trying to change my ways I'll get there. The bottom of my well is spring loaded. I'll fly if I can't run place your bet. Can't wait to get back up and raise hell. I cried, I lost all my sleep. I caved in too deep. Consumed with all the rage. This fight will take all of me. I'm ready to be. All of what I am made of. I'm taking a new path with no past. I feel I'm getting close to get there. Cause now that I can see through this mess. I'll slow down and change lanes but then I'm coming fast. Cause all my impulses. Called for attention. But I couldn't stop. Oh my impulses. Drove all my actions. I was just so distraught. Trying to change my ways I'll get there. The bottom of my well is spring loaded"
jungle kid,"Growing up was very cruel. My role model was my own truth. And truth kept switching from red to blue. No firm ground to step on to. Nowadays it's clear to me. All the chaos I unleashed. Was all the pain inside of me. I was just a wild kid. I was a jungle kid running free. There was nothing left for me. So unset I could not breath, I felt alive. Time just flew over me. Ha hahaha hahaha hahahahaha. Ha hahaha hahaha, wild kid. Ha hahaha hahaha hahahahaha. Ha hahaha hahaha, wild kid. There was nothing I could say. Not a soul to see through me. But surviving had its way. And I found a way to be. Nowadays it's clear to me. All the chaos I unleashed. Was all the pain inside of me. I was just a wild kid. I was a jungle kid running free. There was nothing left for me. So unset I could not breath, I felt alive. Time just flew over me. Ha hahaha hahaha hahahahaha. Ha hahaha hahaha, wild kid. Ha hahaha hahaha hahahahaha. Ha hahaha hahaha, wild kid"
trapped,I wish I could. Write pretty things. U'd think im light as a feather. But what can I do. The storm's within. Warned u u should've known better. . What can I do what can I do. If so easily so easily. Dark ness. wants to wake up. And burst out. I want to let. The sunshine in. But I just can't get up on my feet. To let it comme in. And just breath it in. getting up feelz like im caving in. Cause im trapped in the past. Just like everyone else. But I know that im there. Feeling just how it felt. Darkness. Wants to wake up. And burst out
war paint,I can't seem to breath you out from me. It hurts but I'm so glad you set me free. There's so much I'd tell you but I won't. You played with my heart for way too long. The scars I carry deep within my heart. Made me stronger than you could have thought. But In my mind where I have no con... trol. I just keep on falling back to you. I just keep on falling back to you. I just keep on falling back to you. Well you said you want me. so man up and show me. Actions speak louder than words. You say one thing. than you act like I am nothing. The thing is I keep falling back to you. I just keep on falling back to you. I won't keep on falling back to you. I keep writing songs for you. It's just me healing liking all my wounds. Cause you said that you were in love and I was too so I just jumped. but your waters were too shallow I got hurt. I can't wait untill you hear this tune. and wonder if I wrote it just for you. Well truth is yeah your bullshit hurt but pain is shaping all of us. and I wear it like war paint 'till it's gone. Well you said you want me. so man up and show me. Actions speak louder than words. You say one thing. than you act like I am nothing. The thing is I keep falling back to you (come back to you). I just keep on falling back to you. I just keep on falling back to you. I won't keep on falling back to you
