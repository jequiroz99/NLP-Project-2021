crickets sing for anamaria,"Hey Maria Papa said. You better go to bed. Maria Mama said. You better go to bed. And little sister said. You better go to bed. The older brother said. You heard what Papa said. You better say goodnight. You better shut the light. And Papa told you no. You can't go out tonight. But Papa didn't know. Maria had a date. And couldn't let him wait. So in a little while. She waited till the lights were low. She went out the window to her beau, and so. There's a lot of huggin' then. A lot of kissin' then. A lot of huggin' him. A lot of kissin' him. A lot of happy talk. A lot of moon above. But very little time. But very little time. To make a lot of love. To make a lot of love. Which is a normal thing. To make a lot of love. For it was summertime. When all the crickets sing. And in the summertime. When anyone's in love. The crickets sing a happy song. But they didn't do their repetoire for long. Suddenly the Papa came. And then the Mama came. And then the sister came. And then the brother came. And then the uncle came. And then the cousin came. An even dozen came. And I can tell you this. It was a dirty shame. Because the Papa came. And then the Mama came. And then the sister came. And then the brother came. And then the cousin came. And even dozencame. And I can tell you this. Do-do-do-do. When anyone's in love. The crickets sing a happy song. But they didn't do their repetoire for long. Suddenly the Papa came. And then the Mama came. And then the sister came. And then the brother came. And then the uncle came. And then the cousin came. An even dozen came. And I can tell you this. It was a dirty shame. Because the Papa came. And then the Mama came. And then the sister came. And then the brother came. And then the cousin came. An even dozen came. And I can tell you. Suddenly the Papa came. And then the Mama came. And then the sister came. And then the brother came. And then the uncle came. And then the cousin came. An even dozen came. And I can tell you this. It was a dirty shame. Because the Papa came. And then the Mama came. And then the sister came. And then the brother came. And then the cousin came. An even dozen came. And I can tell you. Suddenly the Papa came. And then the Mama came. And then the sister came.

reality,Sometimes I feel like leaving. For anothe time and space. Sometimes I feel like dreaming. Of another human race. Sometimes I stop believing. In everything that has been said. Sometimes I lose the meaning. Of what's good and bad. Everytime that I will stop to tight. And look around. Everytime I see the children. Sleeping on the ground. Smetimes I feel like losing. The hope I carry in my heart. Sometimes I feel I'm moving. But always end up in the start
the face i love (seu encanto),Just think of things like daffodils. and peaceful sheep on clovered hills. the morning song of whippoorwills. and you'll see the face I love. think of any old sky. getting ready to cry. Down comes the rain but. It's raining confetti. Then think of things like far off isles. to blue green eyes. and sunlit smiles. and in your hand a wishing star. the one you saw too far off above. every lovely view. introduces you
