Girl I wish you could've seen how your man was shakin' me. CHORUS:. Girlfriend let me give you somethin'. I know that you love him but you should've saw him last night. You ain't his girlfriend anymore than I am. I know you see him. But girl you really should've saw him last night. Oh no no you didn't say that I need to back away. I thought you heard when I told you that it ain't my fault if he wants you back. All that's been said to me, it don't really mean a thing. You need to realise that I'm not the one you should call with an attitude. And if he's your man then tell me, why was he freakin' with me?. All up on the floor last night, saying things I know you wouldn't like. But you say you don't believe he was acting that way. Girl I wish you could've seen how your man was shakin' me. CHORUS. Did you really think your man was down for you?. Did you really think that his love was true?. If you had been loving your man right. He wouldn't have been puttin' it on me all night. You weren't his girl last night. CHORUS."
gone,"I never knew that we were through, I was too fallen and fallen for you. You walked away, out of my life, nothing to say. Couldn't deny, or ask you why, why you were telling me lie after lie. Without a sign, no longer mine, it was good-bye. Did you think I couldn't live without you?. Did you think I'd lay down and die?. And listen baby, I, I was right, to doubt you. I can live without you by my side. (Now you're gone) And the days are getting brighter. (Now you're gone) And the writings on the wall. (Now you're gone) Now my heart is out of danger. (Now you're gone) I have no regrets at all. I have no fear, my conscience is clear, won't let your memory drive me to tears. Suddenly now, I understand why you are gone. A bittersweet revenge, in the end, is a heart that can grow on command. Take it from me, I'm mov-ing on.. Did you think I couldn't live without you?. Did you think I'd lay down and die?. Now listen baby, I, I was right, to doubt you. I can live without you by my side. (Now you're gone) And the days are getting brighter. (Now you're gone) And the writings on the wall. (Now you're gone) Now my heart is out of danger. (Now you're gone) I have no regrets at all. . I've been thinking about you night and day, all the time that we spent, just thrown away. I've been thinking about how you tried to break my heart. Now I've finally found the strength to say, that letting you go is the only way. I've decided today is the day to move on. Did you think I couldn't live without you?. Did you think I'd lay down and die?. Now listen baby, I, I was right, to doubt you. I can live without you by my side. (Now you're gone) And the days are getting brighter. (Now you're gone) And the writings on the wall. (Now you're gone) Now my heart is out of danger. (Now you're gone) I have no regrets at all. Now you're gone..."

that kind of girl,"(Steve Kipner/ Jack Kugell/ David Frank). Boy when I first saw u - knew I could adore u. And it's my nature to be shy but not tonight. So let me make the first move - make it easy for you. Someone has to break the ice, oh Oh. Don't care bout your money or the car that you drive. Cos' my affection ain't something you can buy. Got my suspicions by lookin in your eyes. That you could be my kind of guy. Do you like watchin the sun come up. Sippin champagne in a paper cup. Laughing when you're makin love (oh baby). Cos' I'm that kind of girl. Do you like dancin' to a sad love song. Even when the music's gone. If you don't think kisses can be too long. Cos I'm that kind of girl. Is this first star wishing or woman's intuition. Has my arrow found its mark? Oh! Baby. Cos' all I do is think of you in a fantasy for two. And I've just got to let you know. Cos' being real is in my heart and soul. Don't care bout your money or the car that you drive. Cos' my affection ain't something you can buy. Got my suspicions by lookin in your eyes. That you could be my kind of guy. I wanna be kissin in the rain. Fallen in love over and over again. I want the pleasure and not the pain. Cos I'm that kind of girl."

unconditional love,You could give me diamonds. You could give me pearls. Give me all the fast cars. In the World. But there is only one thing. And its bigger than the sea. The only thing that matters. Is what you've given me. Chorus. When I see the bright lights in your eyes. Feel like a bird that's just learned to fly. From now until the end of time. I'm glad you came into my life. My gift sent from above. Unconditional love. You take me as I am. Not who I'm dressed up to be. Looking at you tells me. The best things in life are free. You're the blessing that I treasure. With a heart so true. Noone ever touched me. The way that you do. Chorus. With your innocence you opened up my heart. I knew that I would love you right from the very start. You turned my life around showed me a better way. Thoughts of you will always make me have a brighter day. When I'm by your side it helps to see me through. Can't express all the happiness when I'm with you. A gift from up above the one I'm dreaming of. I'll always cherish you my unconditional love. When I see the bright lights in your eyes. Feel like a bird that's just learned to fly. From now until the end of time. I'm glad you came into my life.

Watcha talkin bout I don't really hear it. Cos you keep on fading out you're not coming through. Watcha gonna do watcha talkin bout. Who you think you're fooling theres no way I'm hanging out with someone like you. Watcha gonna do. It started when the fame and fans kept comin in. And then you changed on us. Then you told us you were cool and we were wrong. When I call you on the phone you act like you ain't home. Your checking your caller ID now I've seen it all why you getting fake on me?. Know you gotta lot of problems and you need to solve them. But it's not gonna be with me around me around oh with me around oh no. Chorus. Wish it be the same but I doubt that you could change.

Till you started doin us wrong I'm not trying to be a hater but your words are stuck. I'm fed up and I've had enough oooh oooh tell me. . Chorus Out."
