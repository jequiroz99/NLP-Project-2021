ho-down,(Elliot Wolff / Howie Hersh /Da' Count / Paula Abdul / Robb Boldt / Jesse Greer / Irving Mills / Cab Calloway / Clarence Gaskill). Chorus:. That's what I want. That's what I need. That's what I want. Ho-down. She sprays her lies around her like the clouds release the rain. And endless stream of promises that vaporize again. Remember last Tuesday when you said it was the end. You caught her in your Nissan getting funky with your best friend. She will never change till her flesh is under dirt. But then at least she's hangin' with neighbors she deserves. Forgive me if I seem to sound a little on the loose. But I cannot pour sugar just to sweeten up the truth. I would like to wish her to a long forgotten dream. Happened early morning when I was just two or three. Everyone around who didn't quite fit in the mix. Turned and waved goodbye and disappeared without a hitch. Except my friend Billy who live just across the way. The world belonged to us forever on from that day. Until we ran into that sneaky girl from down the street. Who tried to smile so pretty stealing Billy right from me. Chorus. The world spun around her everywhere that she would go. But even my friend Billy knew that she was just a - oh no. She had such a way to twist and turn a simple truth. Told my friend Billy I had been a little loose. Then Billy took her by the arm and left me standing all along. I just had to wait there watching them do-se-do. Till Billy pushed her in the deepest darkest hole around. It was goodbye sneaky girl - ho down. I would like to wish her for her a place to somewhere far. A place in outer space to some exotic little star. A million miles away would probably suit the planet fine. Someplace where it's clear she is gone and you are mine. Or maybe some romantic little island in the sea. As far away as it is possible to be. She can have the flowers and the wind. And I can have my baby back with me once again. Chorus. I would like to wish for her another little story. My daddy said to me when I was just a little girly. He told me 'bout a pretty graceful lovely lady bird. Who never could find a nest good enough for her. From every tree she landed in she saw one that was better. So off she went before she ever could regain her breath. Wasn't it a pity when she finally hit the ground. It was goodbye lovely birdy - ho down.

You've been traveling. For light years. You got here the same time. Those tears found their way. Down your face. I fought with the laws tooth. And nail. And I traveled. By night, dear. You're a sight for sore eyes. I've been looking. All over the place. Up where the angels sigh. Down there the dreams get. Smashed on the rocks. You and I. Wait to begin again. Lifted above by a love. That does not end. Chorus. You picked up some. Pieces of light. As you broke through. The speed of sound. I was rockin' around. In my own. Two-dimensional way. Now when I hear. That jet engine blow. Then I know you are. Leaving town. Baby, I'd follow you. To the edge of it all, anyway. Up where the kingdom comes. Down where the streets. Take the breath. Of another young gun. Love is a whispered prayer. Shot like a spark. Though the heart. Of dark despair. Chorus. I don't regret. Any nineteen-year-old. Indiscretions. I can still fit both my feet. In my mouth, anyway. But these days I'm just not as. Willing to nurse. The obsession. If the doc says. I've got to come out. Then I'm happy to pay."

didn't i say i love you,"(Elliot Wolff / Stacy Piersa). Something sweet fills my soul with wonder. Tender arms wrap me in my slumber. Cherished thoughts keep our hearts together. Safe and warm, nothing could be better. I will be there whenever you call me. Didn't I say I love you. I will be there to keep your tears from falling. Didn't I say I do. Just a breath passing from your two lips. And I forget everything, I lose it. Just a look makes me feel the madness. In my world no one else will have it. Chorus. Time may change some things. But you and me will always last forever. Dreams may come and go but we, we know. Will always be together. (Didn't I say I love you, boy). Chorus. I will be there no matter what the reason. Didn't I say I love you. I will be there and I will never leave you."

highschool crush,"(Jon Lind / John Andrew Schreiner / Paula Abdul). Look out my window. Rain comin' down. Waitin' at the corner. Kids all wearin' their frowns. Just another Monday. Goin' to school. Till you come along. Kickin' your heels. Lookin' my way- makin' me feel real. You made me blush.... You were my high school crush...(ohhhh). Billy got married. Lizzy left town. Barrie went to New York City. She's dancin' around. You went off to college. To conquer the word. I stayed home. Thinkin' 'bout you. Now you're back. What am I gonna do?. You made me blush.... You were my high school crush...(ohhhh). Now give me back my dream. Ooh, how the tables turned. I see your eyes. And I feel the burn. One thing I know for sure. They'll never find a cure. For what I got for you. My love is true. (oooohhh). Baby my love is true. Now you're back. Kickin' your heels. Lookin' my way- makin' me feel real. You made me blush. But that was high school (yeah).

ho-down,(Elliot Wolff / Howie Hersh /Da' Count / Paula Abdul / Robb Boldt / Jesse Greer / Irving Mills / Cab Calloway / Clarence Gaskill). Chorus:. That's what I want. That's what I need. That's what I want. Ho-down. She sprays her lies around her like the clouds release the rain. And endless stream of promises that vaporize again. Remember last Tuesday when you said it was the end. You caught her in your Nissan getting funky with your best friend. She will never change till her flesh is under dirt. But then at least she's hangin' with neighbors she deserves. Forgive me if I seem to sound a little on the loose. But I cannot pour sugar just to sweeten up the truth. I would like to wish her to a long forgotten dream. Happened early morning when I was just two or three. Everyone around who didn't quite fit in the mix. Turned and waved goodbye and disappeared without a hitch. Except my friend Billy who live just across the way. The world belonged to us forever on from that day. Until we ran into that sneaky girl from down the street. Who tried to smile so pretty stealing Billy right from me. Chorus. The world spun around her everywhere that she would go. But even my friend Billy knew that she was just a - oh no. She had such a way to twist and turn a simple truth. Told my friend Billy I had been a little loose. Then Billy took her by the arm and left me standing all along. I just had to wait there watching them do-se-do. Till Billy pushed her in the deepest darkest hole around. It was goodbye sneaky girl - ho down. I would like to wish her for her a place to somewhere far. A place in outer space to some exotic little star. A million miles away would probably suit the planet fine. Someplace where it's clear she is gone and you are mine. Or maybe some romantic little island in the sea. As far away as it is possible to be. She can have the flowers and the wind. And I can have my baby back with me once again. Chorus. I would like to wish for her another little story. My daddy said to me when I was just a little girly. He told me 'bout a pretty graceful lovely lady bird. Who never could find a nest good enough for her. From every tree she landed in she saw one that was better. So off she went before she ever could regain her breath. Wasn't it a pity when she finally hit the ground. It was goodbye lovely birdy - ho down.
