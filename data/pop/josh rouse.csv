Phone calls, regrets, everyone placed bets on odds I wouldn't seeâ€¦. Chorus:. I've heard stories, ugly stories that no one can denyâ€¦they were trueâ€¦. Bridge:. Believe in your doubts because I found out you can never trust in anyone and here in the South I call you out you can never trust in anyoneâ€¦. Next time you're in town don't bother coming around you're not welcome anymore... Unfair, so unkind, to have wasted my time on such a silly dreamâ€¦. Chorus:. I've heard stories, ugly stories which no one can denyâ€¦they were trueâ€¦."
under cold blue stars,"Under the cold blues stars you would just stroll around the yard thatâ€™s what happens to dreams when the life strains and the child lays in youâ€¦. When you got old you played guitar in a little town, your favorite barâ€¦just blowing steam now the lights fade and everyone's paid to see youâ€¦. So did the farm steal your soul when the cornfields won't grow its time to leave, now the heart bleeds and the family leans on youâ€¦. You were under the cold blue stars in another town your favorite bar that's what happens to dreams when the life strains and the child lays in youâ€¦."
under your charms,Only half of the time do you tell me just what you want. Only half of the time do you tell me just what you want. Can I get some contact?. Can I get some contact from you?. Can I get some contact with what is real?. It's the end of the night and i'm feelin' sexual. It's the end of the night and i'm feelin' sexual. Can I get some love back?. Can I get some love back from you?. Can I get some love back that you conceal?. And now I've fallen under your charm. And now I fall into your arms. It's where I feel alright. In the blink of an eye do we do what's natural. Maybe once or twice do we do what's natural. Is it just a love task?. Is it too much to ask from you?. Is it just a love task or do you feel?. And I've fallen under your charm. And now I fall into your arms. And now I've fallen under your charm. And now I fall into your arms. Where I feel alright. It's where I'll stay tonight. Only half of the time do you tell me just what you want. Only half of the time do you tell me just what you want. Can I get some contact?. Can I get some contact from you?. Can I get some contact with what is real?
why won't you tell me what,"[Chorus]. Why won't you tell me what. Why won't you tell me what. What's going on with you. Why won't you tell me what. Why won't you tell me what. What's going on with you. Sparkling night, they trying to hide. I seen those tears before, I don't think I like them. Gimme a sign, some kind of sign. To bring me back around to your way of thinking. [Chorus]. Wastin my time, precious time. Whatever it is I wish you'd up and say it. Gimme a sign, some kind of sign. To bring me back around to your way of thinking. [Chorus]"
winter in the haptons,"Bah, lah dot bah, bah lah ba lah bah. Here we go, singing our songs with our soul. The winter has gone, where do we belong. We have stayed too long. Friday night, we’re so uptight we get stoned. Sit in the Hamptons, it is too cold. We have stayed too long. Spring is finally here and we’re so well dressed. It’s a talent and it’s our style. So put on your hat because the forecast is rain clouds. Bah, lah dot bah, bah lah ba lah bah. Bah, lah dot bah, bah lah ba lah bah. Never know, Americans seem such a bore. Embarassed and still we are hanging on. We have stayed too long. And we'll fly, take a trip, see the Euro sites. Our money is gone, where do we belong. We have stayed too long. Sick of living here, we’re such a mess. Cause the government, they’re all liars. So put on your hat because the forecast is rain clouds. Bah, lah dot bah, bah lah ba lah bah. Bah, lah dot bah, bah lah ba lah bah. Bah, lah dot bah, bah lah ba lah bah. Bah, lah dot bah, bah lah ba lah bah"
women and men,"The current will rise much faster, makes it harder to find what I'm afterâ€¦. The water's up, the waters down and I can't swimâ€¦when I am lost and you are not then no one winsâ€¦. Our babies have known no father, makes it harder to callâ€¦I don't botherâ€¦bottle up, bottle down, is how I liveâ€¦the moneys' gone just one more song before I turn inâ€¦. Chorus:. But you won't see me because I won't be there to help you asleep when you get scaredâ€¦it's the absence, you're afraid and the night it's approaches but I'm still a state awayâ€¦scared, it's the absence your afraidâ€¦. I can't erase what the past is, it's time to face circumstances..as the sun comes up, the sun goes down and I begin the days grow long as I trek on and I hate knowingâ€¦. Chorus:. That you won't see me because I won't be there to help you asleep when you get scaredâ€¦it's the absence, you're afraid and the night approaches but I'm still a state awayâ€¦scared, it's the absence your afraidâ€¦of a fightâ€¦we're surviving but it's still from day to dayâ€¦. It's nice to come home for a weekendâ€¦the children have grown, how I've missed themâ€¦. As I pull up and you walk out we smile againâ€¦the grass needs cut, cuddled up just woman and manâ€¦."
wonderful,"Oftentimes I sit and wonder. As I gaze out over yonder. I'm so crazy about you. So crazy and it's true. I think you're wonderful. Don't change. I think you're wonderful. Don't change your way. I think you're wonderful. Don't change your way at all. It is the morning, love, you have found me. Reading the paper with my coffee. And before you must go. There's one thing you should know. I think you're wonderful. Don't change. I think you're wonderful. I think you're wonderful. I think you're wonderful. Don't change at all. At all. At all"
