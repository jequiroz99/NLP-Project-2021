horse chimes,"Hello Johnson your mother once gave me a lift back from school. - That's no reason to get so excited. I'd been playing football with the youngsters, Johnson says don't dramatise. - And you can't even spell salacious. In a caravette with such a pretty widow, but wheels aren't there to be looked at.. - And it's cheap to say that she's delicious. When she's someone's daughter. Horse chimes so stupid and so mean. On the offensive all wolf whistle and jeans. Horse chimes they neigh they never bell. All straw and piss they never kiss but tell. Horse chimes - Coarse times are here. And don't I know it, and I'm ashamed. And you won't say it, that we're to blame. And I must change. There is a saying tailormade for her she is the apple of your eye. - Lord don't smother her in soapy feelings. You buy a pedestal only to rest it in a wheelchair. - Beauty can't be beauty 'till it's dying. And I think I'll die unless I kiss you, please don't murder me. - Hark I hear the ghost of feeling leaving. - And you know what pushed her. Horse chimes so stupid and so mean. On the offensive all wolf whistle and jeans. Horse chimes they neigh they never bell. All straw and piss they never kiss but tell. Horse chimes - Coarse times are here. And don't I know it, and I'm ashamed. And you won't say it, that we're to blame. And I must change."
horsin' around,"It's me again your worthless friend or foe. I somehow let that lovely creature down. Horsin' around, horsin' around. Some things we check and double check and lose. I guess I let that little vow get lost. Forgettin' the cost, forgettin' the cost. Quick to forgive and so slow to blame, the very thought fills me with shame. But that didn't stop it happening. The thrill of it - can I call it that ? - was cheap. And feeling cheap's the only thing you keep. It's so unsightly to walk from her arms so lightly. Selling it all up the swanee. Horsin' around's a serious business, last thing you'd want somebody to witness. I was the fool who always presumed that I'd wear the shoes and you'd be the doormat. You wonder why my hands are still shaking : In need of a cry the shoulders are taken.... I deserve to be kicked so badly. You deserve more than I sold you for. Horsin' around, horsin' around. The moral is whatever else you learn. You shouldn't let that lovely creature down. Lord just blind me, don't let her innocent eyes remind me. Selling it all up the swanee. Horsin' around, horsin' around.."
i never play basketball now,"I'm not looking to disturb you, just a little to unnerve you.. I have nothing about games and always looking back.. After the last unholy row - I never, ever play basketball now.. It joins a list of things I'll miss like fencing foils and lovely girls I'll never kiss..

And ""FLOW"", it skips like a river and it rolls ""FLOW"", you'll swear it's a chapel - isn't that so ?.

As you give up the ghost as you sink into sleep. Maybe her face in the morning, maybe his in the evening. Maybe words never spoken, aren't they the ones worth hearin' ?. Say I remember that. Nothing sounds as good as ""I Remember That"". Like a bolt out from the blue, did you feel it too ?. - I remember that. Nothing sounds as good as ""I Remember That"". Like a bolt out from the blue, did you feel it too ?. - I remember that. 'Cos that's all we can have, yes it's all we can trust. It's a hell of a ride but a journey to dust. And there's nothing pathetic listing clothes she'd wear. If it proves that I had you, if it proves I was there. Say I remember that. Nothing sounds as good as ""I Remember That"". Like a bolt out from the blue, did you feel it too ?. - I remember that. Nothing sounds as good as ""I Remember That"". Like a bolt out from the blue, did you feel it too ?. - I remember that. Did you feel it too ?... I remember that. Did you feel it too ?... I remember that.... (chorus adlib)."

jesse james symphony,"Jesse James is running and he'll never be at rest. 'Til the day they fold his arms across his chest. He's a long way from the cradle. And his Ma's authority. But it only seems a minute. Since he stood over his bed. And she tried to tell him something. Now what the hell was it she said ???. Jesse James is thinking of the breaks he never had. And the gene that cursed his blood group rhesus-bad. Jesse James lived money. His account was in the black. 'Til the day he stopped a bullet with his back. Well the zip cose may read Vegas. But the heart beats Tupelo. And a footstep is such a small thing. That it's neither here nor there. 'Til you string those steps together. And find home is way back, way back where ?. Jesse James was never. Part of lifes great symphony. All he heard were penny whistles out of key. Jesse James he promised :. ""I will never die afraid"". That boy perjured every vow he ever made."

Stranger things have been, stranger things have gone,. I find it hard right now to name you one. Tell me do something true and drop the fairytales.. If singin' birds must sing, with no question of choice. Then livin' is our song, indeed our voice. Best agree you and me we're probably nightingales. - Instrumental Verse -. Who are we ?

one of the broken,"Hi, this is God here,. Talking to me used to be a simple affair. Moses only had to see a burning bush. And he'd pull up a chair. Well it's been a long time since we talked in that way. If you're wondering what to say.... Sing me no deep hymn of devotion. Sing me no slow sweet melody. Sing it to one, one of the broken. And brother you're singing, singing to me. I remember King David. With his harp and his beautiful, beautiful songs. I answered his prayers. And showed him a place where his music belongs. It's not too far from here come get up off your knees. If you're looking for ways to please.... Sing me no psalm you're not King David. Sing me no high hushed Glory Be.

the dreamer,She told me that she loved me. I heard the sirens sing. Her voice is soft as dead of night. A pillow for a king. She tangled me in starlight. I dangled in each beam.

Emerging from a dream. Where are your dreams - did they all fade away?. Lost in the cold light of day. Where are your dreams?

the old magician,"The old magician takes the stage. (His act does not improve with age). Observe the shabby hat and gloves. The tired act that no-one loves. There was a time he produced doves. A mirror and a puff of smoke. His mysteries are now a joke. His poor assistant black and blue. She's tired of being sawn in two. She's tired of being sawn in two. Hidden trapdoor, velvet cape. Still from death there's no escape. Words of sympathy and tact. Only underline the fact. Death is a lousy disappearing act. Lord have mercy and be kind. When our faculties unwind. Overlook the hat and gloves. The tired act that no-one loves. There was a time we produced doves. The old magician takes the stage. With sleight of hand he? ll disengage. As dignified as you? ll allow. He? ll take his last, his final bow. He? s lost all his illusions now"

Yet listen and you're moved to swear. I know that house, I've climbed that stair. I've shared those overwhelming feelings. I've suffered loss, I've known such joy. Emotions we all know are burnished till they glow. In the songs of Danny Galway. His melodies inspire whims. His chord changes like Baptist hymns. They lift your spirit till its soars. Till you forget that spirit's yours. Sound and word in sweet communion. Echoes of a better world. Where chivalry's not dead, we'll look for it instead. In the songs of Danny Galway. Something well and pure for ever will endure. In the songs of Danny Galway"

tiffanys,"Time is the healer, time was on my hands. The bus stopped at Tiffany's. So I went to hear the band. I saw Cinderella, then the curtain dropped. Time hung heavy on my hands but today. The clock just stopped. I heard the music saw those pictures on the wall. I fell in love with Tiffany's I thought it said it all. Soothed by your saxophones I thought you'd understand.

Close your door and open mine. Clench your fists as the blizzard grows. I want to, I want to, I want to. Sit right back in your rocking chair. Things you said are everywhere. Words music and everything. I want to, I want to, I want to. But I won't call you Tornado. (Call you Tornado). Call you Tornado. (Call you Tornado). I won't call you Tornado. (Call you Tornado).
