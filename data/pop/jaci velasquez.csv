i promise,"I Promise. Lord, You know my heart. And all my desires. And the secret things I\'ll never tell.. Lord, You know them well.. Though I may be young,. I see and understand. That at times, like sheep, we go astray. And things get out of hand.. So I promise to be true to You,. To live my life in purity. As unto You, waiting for the day. When I hear You say,. Here is the one I have created. Just for you.. Until then, O Lord. I will be content. Knowing that true love will come someday.. It will only come from You.. \'Cause I have seen the suffering. That loneliness can cause. When we choose to give our love away. Without a righteous cause.. So I promise to be true to You,. To live my life in purity. As unto You, waiting for the day.

It's so amazing. It's so incredible I've gotta say. You're my God. I can't even imagine. How He made it happen. To see the silver moon from afar. It's almost unbelievable. It's truely unconceivable.

Oh what You do's a mystery, just to be,. Ya got me fallin' to my knees. Oh I just can't believe"
lost without you,"I know I can be a little stubborn sometimes. You might say a little righteous and too proud. I was looking for a way to compromise. Thinking maybe I could work things out. I thought I had all the answers. Never givin' in. But You loved me all along. And I admit that I was wrong. All I know is I'm lost without You. I'm not gonna lie. I could never be strong without You. I need You by my side. If I ever thought we'd never be together. 'Cause of all my foolish pride. Don't know what I'd do. I'm lost without You. I keep tryin' to find my way.

The way You give me clarity when I'm confused. Just to hear Your voice can ease my mind. Oh, my world's so cold at night. When I wonder far away. Only You can make it right. No, I'm not too proud to say. All I know is I'm lost without You. I'm not gonna lie (I will not lie). I could never be strong without You. I need You by my side.

Your love lifted me back on my feet. It was like you heard my calling. And you rushed to set me free. When I found you I was blessed. And I will never leave you. I need you. Chorus.

tonight,"Sometimes I feel the rain. Fall on the twilight of the day. Watch the world fade away. Through all the stains of time. In the far corner of my mind. All the dreams I left behind. You`ll find. But tonight, I`m gonna live in your world. Where the stars come out and find you beautiful. Yeah tonight, I wanna live in your world. Where the stars come out and call you beautiful. Once I felt it all. The fear and freedom of the fall. Empty rooms and barren walls. And now the cold remains. From all the fallout of the day. Let it all fade away. I pray.

So many unkind words are spoken. You see my heart is hurting, but it's still open. I have no other choice but. To let you see, so. Come on in 'cause I know I can take it. You can throw those stones. Even though I may be fragile. You're not gonna see me shatter. 'Cause I know who I am and I won't fake it. I'm gonna take a stand. 'Cause it's my faith that keeps me strong. The light is on in my glass house. So tomorrow morning when we step outside our castle. We think before we let the judgment calls unravel. Our Savior said to love eachother. Why must we go on hurting one another. Though it may be easier to run and hide. I'm gonna let you in 'cause I can take it. You can throw those stones. Even though I may be fragile. You're not gonna see me shatter, no. 'Cause I know who I am and I won't fake it. I'm gonna take a stand. 'Cause it's my faith that keeps me strong. The light is on. May I always find a way to give compassion. And remember how it hurt. When someone else's world is crashing. Lord I pray for love, yeah. Come on in 'cause I know I can take it. You can throw those stones. Even though I may be fragile. You're not gonna see me shatter, no. 'Cause I know who I am and I won't fake it. I'm gonna take a stand.

guilt,I've given it my best shot. With everything that i've got. And still i feel i'm falling short again. I whistle while i'm working. Pretend that i'm not hurting.

just a prayer away,"Tears that fell like rain. Streamed down from my heart. Colors turned to gray. Emptiness led the way. Until I fell apart. You came to save me. To show me that. Chorus:. You're just a prayer away. No matter where I am. I know in my heart. You're never too far. When I'm losing my way. You're just a prayer away. My strength is in my faith. I'm never alone. I'm never afraid. Cuz' you're just a prayer away. When I close my eyes. Lord, I call your name. And the dark subsides. Nothing can take the place. Of the peace I find. You came to save me. To show me that. Repeat Chorus:. Whenever I need to find you. I just fall on my knees. In you I find the strength that I need to live. To believe. Repeat Chorus:."
lay it down,"Lay It Down. I’ve been looking ‘til my eyes are tired of looking. Listening ‘til my ears are numb from listening. Praying ‘til my knees are sore from kneeling. On the bedroom floor.

All of my hopes and my dreams and my best laid plans. Are slowly slipping through my folded hands. Chorus. So I’m gonna lay it down. I’m gonna learn to trust You now. What else can I do. Everything I am depends on You. And if the sun don’t come back up. I know Your love will be enough. I’m gonna let it be, I’m gonna let it go. I’m gonna lay it down. I’ve been walking through this world like I’m barely living. Buried in the doubt of this hole I’ve been digging. But You’re pulling me out and I’m finally breathing. In the open air. This room may be dark but I’m finally seeing. There’s a new ray of hope and now I’m believing. That the past is the past and the future’s beginning to look brighter now. ‘Cause all of my hopes and my dreams and my best laid plans. Are safe and secure when I place them in Your hands. Chorus. So I’m gonna lay it down. I’m gonna learn to trust You now. What else can I do. Everything I am depends on You. And if the sun don’t come back up. I know Your love will be enough. I’m gonna let it be, I’m gonna let it go. I’m gonna lay it down. By WLL"

look what love has done,"Rob Mathes & Stephanie Lewis. NOTE: This song is sung to the Lord. In the album cover notes,. ""You"" was capitalized to signify God, (see final verse).. Where once the moon. Was just a rock spinning in the sky. Where once the stars. Were only tiny points of light. Now the moon looks like. It's heaven's shining pearl. Now those stars--they look like. Windows into another world. CHORUS 1:. Look what Love has done to me. Look what Love has done. There's poetry in all I see. Look what Love has done. And my heart is dancing through each day. My soul is running free. Look what Love has done to me. Where once each breath. Was just a sigh of aching emptiness. Where once I hardly felt. The beating in my chest. Now each breath feels like. A precious kiss of life. Now inside me beat the wings of a thousand butterflies. CHORUS 2:. Look what Love has done to me. Look what Love has done. This must be how it's meant to be. Look what Love has done. And my heart is dancing through each day. My soul is running free. Look what Love has done to me. And I can't tell. Was that a violin. Or did You say something. Was that lightning striking where I stand. Or did You just reach out and take my hand. ."

To something beautiful. I've taken chances. I've tried out romances. I want to breathe in all You've given me. Stepping out means I'm. Tripping and falling. Your loving hands would never let me, let me hit the floor. When it's all said and done. Let this be real. This strength from above. I hope they see. Chorus"

sweet surrender,"Mark Heimermann & Wayne Kirkpatrick. It's not a mysterious wind. And it's not the thunder rollin' in. It's a spirit that I feel within that's callin'. I understand but I can't explain. Now I see love in a different way. And with a single leap of faith I'm fallin'. Into Your lovin' arms. Showing no resistance. There's a peace that flows over me. CHORUS:. Sweet surrender. Love me tender. You have captured my desiring heart -- completely. Sweet surrender. Yours forever. I will gladly give my all to You -- receive me. Oh Lord, I am ever Yours. Your love offers no escape. But I don't feel the need to run away. My heart has found a place to stay -- here with you. Nothing else could satisfy. The deep void that I had inside. From all the worldly battles I have lived through. Now here in Your loving arms. I have gone the distance. I will rest my soul in your embrace. CHORUS. .

tango,"Love is a fiery dance of give and take. The game of tug of war. Can be so tantalizing. We tend to fight over. Who’s right, who’s wrong. We push the buttons. That keep the tension rising. (Chorus). Whay-oh, oh whay-oh. Whay-oh, oh whay-oh,. I think it’s time to tango. Whay-oh, Oh Whay-Oh, Whay-Oh, Oh-whay. Sometimes you need to tango. You like to keep it civilized and calm. I like the drama. It exposes all the feelings. We won’t resolve it. If we both shut down. We gotta work it out. Before we hit the ceiling. (Chorus). Que se Muevan (“That they move”). Que se Baila (“That it’s danced”). Let’s dance together. Baby you and me. Can’t let our differences. Ever come between us. We’ll find the rhythm. If we meet halfway. Let’s not get fiesty. Just because we’re Mars and Venus"

I am amazed that. The God who made all this, made me. As my eyes were open. I began to believe. The mystery of Christmas. Was truly revealed. A great host of angels. Came calling to me. Taking me back to the pure sacred peace. Chorus. Singing la, la, lalala, lalalala, lalalalalala. There's a savior born to us today. Singing la, la, lalala, lalalala, lalalalalala. The Messiah, Christ the Lord. In the light of the angels. Surrounding my soul. I know for certain. I'm never alone. Now let all of your children. Feel the love that you gave. And in honor of you give it away. Chorus"

the christmas song,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire. Jack Frost nipping at your nose. Yuletide carols being sung by a choir. And folks dressed up like Eskimos. Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe. Help to make the season bright. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow. Will find it hard to sleep tonight. They know that Santa's on his way. He's bringing lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh. And every mother's child is gonna spy. To see if reindeer really know how to fly. And so I'm offering this simple phrase. To kids from one to ninety-two. Although it's been said many times, many ways. Merry Christmas to you. And so I'm offering this simple phrase. To kids from one to ninety-two!.

the real me,"People think I've got it all together. With the show and my sweet, sweet smile. But do they know if I've been happy ever. Pull up a chair 'cause this may take a while. O.K. so here's the thing. I've got my bad days, and some are even worse. I can be a blessing and you know, I can be a curse. I tremble at rejection, I'm scared to be alone. Sometimes I may be selfish, but I always make it home. This is the real me. Am I the girl that you want me to be. This is the real me. With flaws and fears of intimacy. This is the real me. Can you face it. Can you feel it. Can you take it. Can you deal with. The real me. So now you see that I am far from perfect. I will fall and I will make mistakes (oh, no). But I am here and this has taken courage. Will you abandon me or will you stay. (Please stay with me). I know that I'm demanding and sometimes insecure. I think I've got the answers, but then I'm not so sure. I sometimes need attention a little more than I should. But there is a part of me that would give the whole world if I could. This is the real me. Am I the girl that you want me to be. This is the real me. With flaws and fears of intimacy. This is the real me. Can you face it. Can you feel it. Can you take it. Can you deal with. The real me. Now I've gone and let you in. And I no longer will pretend. Will you please still be my friend. Will you please still be my friend. Do you see me. This is the real me.

the sound of your voice,"You spoke and light came to be. You spoke and carved out the sea. You stretched out the heavens, holding the stars in their place. You spoke a marvelous plan. You spoke, breathed life into man. Creation displaying your beauty in wondrous array. The sound of your voice echoes forever. The sound of your voice holds us together. There's nothing more powerful. Nothing more glorious. Than the sound of your voice. You speak calling my name. You speak and I'm never the same. How my heart thrills as you whisper away all my fear. You speak of a kingdom to come. You speak of an army of love. Who'll go to the nations inviting the broken to hear. Come and hear…. And down through the ages. A melody races. It chases the darkness away. For all who will listen. There's hope and forgiveness. In love that has conquered the grave"
thief of always,"Thief Of Always lyrics. Before the winter chill has gone,. The springtime rivers rise.. Before the setting sun has disappeared,. The moon is rising high.. And time waits for no man;. Seasons come and go.. In the midst of an ever - changing world,. This one thing I know:. You\'ve got to live every moment. As though it was your last,. Before the thief of always. Steals tomorrow from your grasp.. Before the chance to know His love. Has somehow passed you by,. Let your heart reach out, right here, right now,. For the Lord to touch your life.. Before the trees have shed. Their autumn gold to leave the barest bark,. The frost beneath our feet will sparkle bright,. Like crystals under the sky.. And time waits for no man;. Seasons come and go.. In the midst of an ever - changing world,. This one thing I know:. You\'ve got to live every moment. As though it was your last,. Before the thief of always. Steals tomorrow from your grasp.. Before the chance to know His love. Has somehow passed you by,. Let your heart reach out, right here, right now,. For the Lord to touch your life.. Don\'t ever doubt that God can lift us high.. Allow the flame of Heaven to be our guide.. Live every moment. As though it was your last,. Before the thief of always. Steals tomorrow from your grasp.. Before the chance to know His love. Has somehow passed you by,. Let your heart reach out, right here, right now,. For the Lord to touch your life. Oh.... ."

tonight,"Sometimes I feel the rain. Fall on the twilight of the day. Watch the world fade away. Through all the stains of time. In the far corner of my mind. All the dreams I left behind. You`ll find. But tonight, I`m gonna live in your world. Where the stars come out and find you beautiful. Yeah tonight, I wanna live in your world. Where the stars come out and call you beautiful. Once I felt it all. The fear and freedom of the fall. Empty rooms and barren walls. And now the cold remains. From all the fallout of the day. Let it all fade away. I pray. That tonight, I`m gonna live in your world. Where the stars come out and find you beautiful. Yeah tonight, I wanna live in Your world. Where the stars come out and call you beautiful. Beautiful. Tonight, I`m gonna live in your world. Where the stars come out and find you beautiful. Yeah tonight, I wanna live in your world. Where the stars come out and call you beautiful. Beautiful.

trust in you,"I used to think that i'd be better off. If i could only know the end result. I used to ask you why, and hang my head and cry. As if you never catch me when i fall. Everyone's afraid. When the winds start blowing. But they're just winds of change. All i need to know. Is you're in control. And you know just what to do. I don't need to see. What i really need. Is a little more trust in you. It's hard to face my fear and let it go. When these seeds of faith have turned to stone. If i could just believe, i'd throw this mountain to the sea. And on this path i never walk alone. Everyone's afraid. When the wind starts blowing. But you're always the same. I'm reaching out, take my hand. Savior please rescue me. I'll make it through and follow you. And i will believe. All i can do is trust in you…"
un lugar celestial (a heavenly place),"Mark Heimermann, Regie Hamm, Bob Farrell & David Velasquez. Sometimes I realize when I gaze in the skies. This spinning world is not my home. A place of mystery, a land of destiny. Is where I know someday I'll go. I dream of beauty I have never seen. I know the arms of heaven wait for me. And yet I feel its sweetness here and now. In this life on earth -- I have found. CHORUS:. Un lugar celestial. Just a little bit of heaven sent from up above. Un lugar celestial. Where the presence of my Father. Holds me in His love. Un lugar celestial. When all my skies are gray. I simply steal away. Into my secret hiding place. When hearts are cold as ice. The breath of paradise. Blows warm and gentle on my face. I know I need my time alone with Him. His healing waters flowing deep within. Don't have to wish upon a distant star. â€˜Cause the light of love fills my heart. CHORUS. El cielo me llama (Heaven is calling me). Caminando en las nubes (Walking on the clouds). Dulce beso delibertad (Sweet kiss of liberty). Nubes de gloria (Clouds of glory). CHORUS. ."

It's so amazing. It's so incredible I've gotta say. You're my God. I can't even imagine. How He made it happen. To see the silver moon from afar. It's almost unbelievable. It's truely unconceivable. To think of all the billions of stars. When I'm watching a rose. How it naturally grows. Just takes my breath away. There's just one thing to say. CHORUS. Oh all the gifts You've given me. Oh what You do's a mystery, just to be,. Ya got me fallin' to my knees. Oh I just can't believe"
you're not there,Ooooh ooooh. Ooooh ooooh. Why do I think of you. Far beyond my reach. Why can't I comprehend. The love you have for me. God of all the universe. Of earth and sky and sea. Your desire to own my heart. Is such a mystery. Chours:. You're not there. Way out there. Wandering in your great unknown. You are here ever near. In my heart you've found a home. You are living. You are breathing. I can feel your presence in me. All the prayers to the saints. Every votive burned. But now I know from within. Your loving voice is heard. You set your spirit. The promised one. To be with me forever. Chours:. In me oooh. In me oooh. In me. Chours till fade out.
your friend,If the wind will blow. I will hold your hand. When the sun won't shine. I will never fade away. When the tears appear. To wipe away your smile. Don't be afraid. I'll be here. I will be your friend. Who will always care. I'll be the first to catch you. If ever you should fall. And hold you in my arms. I will be your friend. If you lose your place. In life's crazy race. You can make it through. 'Cause I will run with you. We'll always pray. And believe in our hearts. That God will be here. By our side. I will be your friend. Who will always care. I'll be the first to catch you. If ever you should fall. And hold you in my arms. I will be your friend. God knows our imperfections. And He loves us anyway. A closer friend than I could ever be. But a little piece of heaven. I will do my best to bring. You'll never have to search again. I will be your friend. Who will always care. I'll be the first to catch you. If ever you should fall. And hold you in my arms. I will be your friend. I will be your friend. One who will always care. I'll be a little closer. When you feel so far away. And hold you in my arms.
