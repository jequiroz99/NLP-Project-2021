la isla bonita,"(Spoken:). Como puede ser verdad. How could it be true?. Last night I dreamt of San Pedro. Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song. A young girl with eyes like the desert. It all seems like yesterday, not far away. Chorus:. Tropical the island breeze. All of nature wild and free. This is where I long to be. La isla bonita. And when the samba played. The sun would set so high. Ring through my ears and sting my eyes. Your Spanish lullaby. The beautiful island. I fell in love with San Pedro. Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me. Te dijo te amo. I prayed that the days would last. They went so fast. He told you, ""I love you"". (chorus). I want to be where the sun warms the sky. When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by. Beautiful faces, no cares in this world. Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl. Last night I dreamt of San Pedro. It all seems like yesterday, not far away. (chorus twice). La la la la la la la. Te dijo te amo. La la la la la la la. El dijo que te ama. He told you, ""I love you"". He said he loves you"

a new argentina,"(Peron:). Dice are rolling, the knives are out. Would-be presidents are all around. I don't say they mean harm. But they'd each give an arm. To see us six feet underground. (Eva:). It doesn't matter what those morons say. Our nation's leaders are a feeble crew. There's only twenty of them anyway. What is twenty next to millions who. Are looking to you?. All you have to do is sit and wait. Keeping out of everybody's way. We'll ... you'll be handed power on a plate. When the ones who matter have their say. And with chaos installed. You can reluctantly agree to be called. (Peron:). There again we could be foolish not to quit while we're ahead. For distance lends enchantment, and that is why. All exiles are distinguished, more important, they're not dead. I could find job satisfaction in Paraguay. (Eva:). This is crazy defeatist talk. Why commit political suicide, there's no risk. There's no call for any action at all. When you have unions on your side. (Workers:). A new Argentina, the chains of the masses untied. A new Argentina, the voice of the people. Cannot be denied.

Now I am a worker, I've suffered the way that you do. I've been unemployed, and I've starved and I've hated it too. But I found my salvation in Peron, may the nation. Let him save them as he saved me. (All:). A new Argentina, a new age about to begin. A new Argentina, we face the world together. And no dissent within. (Peron:). There again we could be foolish not to quit while we're ahead. I can see us many miles away, inactive. Sipping cocktails on a terrace, taking breakfast in bed. Sleeping easy, doing nothing, it's attractive. (Eva:). Don't think I don't think like you. I often get those nightmares too. They always take some swallowing. Sometimes it's very difficult to keep momentum. If it's you that you are following. Don't close doors, keep an escape clause. Because we might lose the Big Apple. But would I have done what I did. If I hadn't thought, if I hadn't known. We would take the country. (Eva:). Peron has resigned from the army and this we avow. The descamisados are those he is marching with now. He supports you, for he loves you. Understands you, is one of you. If not, how could he love me?. (All:). A new Argentina, the chains of the masses untied. A new Argentina, the voice of the people. Cannot be, and must not be denied. (Che:). How annoying that they have to fight elections for their cause. The inconvenience, having to get a majority. If normal methods of persuasion fail to win them applause. There are other ways of establishing authority. (All:). A new Argentina, the chains of the masses untied.

Do you think I'm satisfied?. I'd like to express my extreme point of view. I'm not Christian and I'm not a Jew. I'm just living out the American dream. And I just realized that nothing Is what it seems. Do I have to change my name. Am I gonna be a star. Do I have to change my name. Am I gonna be a star?. Do I have to change my name"
american pie,"A long long time ago. I can still remember. How that music used to make me smile. And I knew that if I had my chance. I could make those people dance. And maybe they'd be happy for a while. Did you write the book of love. And do you have faith in God above. If the bible tells you so?. Now do you believe in rock n roll. And can music save your mortal soul. And can you teach me how to dance real slow?. Well I know that you're in love with him. Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. You both kicked off your shoes. Man, I dig those rhythm and blues. I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck. With a pink carnation and a pick-up truck. But I knew that I was out of luck. The day the music died. I started singing. CHORUS:. Bye bye miss. american pie. Drove my chevy to the levee. But the levee was dry. And good ol´ boys were drinking whiskey and rye. singing. This will be the day that I die. This will be the day that I die. I met a girl who sang the blues. And I asked her for some happy news. But she just smiled and turned away. Well I went down to the sacred store. Where I'd heard the music years before. But the man there said the music wouldn't play. Well now in the streets the children screamed. The lovers cried and the poets dreamed. But not a word was spoken. The church bells all were broken. And the three men I admire the most,. The father, son, and the holy ghost. They caught the last train for the coast. The day the music died. We started singing. Bye bye miss. american pie. Drove my chevy to the levee. But the levee was dry. And good ol´ boys were drinking whiskey and rye. singing. This will be the day that I die. This will be the day that I die. Bye bye miss. american pie. Drove my chevy to the levee. But the levee was dry. And good ol´ boys were drinking whiskey and rye. singing. This will be the day that I die. We started singing (6x)"
and the money kept rolling in (and out),"(Che:). And the money kept rolling in from every side. Eva's pretty hands reached out and they reached wide. Now you may feel it should have been a voluntary cause. But that's not the point my friends. When the money keeps rolling in, you don't ask how. Think of all the people guaranteed a good time now. Eva's called the hungry to her, open up the doors. Never been a fund like the Foundation Eva Peron. Chorus:. (Workers:). Rollin' rollin' rollin', rollin' rollin' rollin'. Rollin' rollin' rollin', rollin' rollin' rollin'. Rollin' rollin' rollin', rollin' rollin' rollin'. Rollin' rollin' rollin', rollin' rollin' rollin'. Rollin' on in, rollin' on in. Rollin' on in, rollin' on in. On in. (Che:). Would you like to try a college education?. Own your landlord's house, take the family on vacation?. Eva and her blessed fund can make your dreams come true. Here's all you have to do my friends. Write your name and your dream on a card or a pad or a ticket. Throw it high in the air and should our lady pick it. She will change your way of life for a week or even two. Name me anyone who cares as much as Eva Peron. (chorus). Rollin' on out, rollin' on out. Rollin' on out, rollin' on out. On out. (Che:). And the money kept rolling out in all directions. To the poor, to the weak, to the destitute of all complexions. Now cynics claim a little of the cash has gone astray. But that's not the point my friends. When the money keeps rolling out you don't keep books. You can tell you've done well by the happy grateful looks. Accountants only slow things down, figures get in the way. Never been a lady loved as much as Eva Peron. (chorus). Rollin' on out, rollin' on out. Rollin' on out, rollin' on out. On out. (Che:). Eva!!!. When the money keeps rolling out you don't keep books. You can tell you've done well by the happy grateful looks. Accountants only slow things down, figures get in the way. Never been a lady loved as much as Eva Peron. (chorus). Rollin' on out, rollin' on out. Rollin' on out, rollin' on out. Rollin' on out, rollin' on out."
angel,"Why am I standing on a cloud. Every time you're around. And my sadness disappears. Every time you are near. Bridge:. You must be an angel. I can see it in your eyes. Full of wonder and surprise. And just now I realize. Chorus:. Oooh you're an angel. Oooh you're an angel. Oooh you're an angel. In disguise, I can see it in your eyes. Walking down a crowded avenue. Other faces seem like nothing next to you. And I can't hear the traffic rushing by. Just the pounding of my heart and that's why. (bridge). (chorus, repeat). You're an angel. You're an angel, baby. You're an angel. You must be an angel. Now I believe that dreams come true. 'Cause you came when I wished for you. This just can't be coincidence. The only way that this makes sense is that. .

another suitcase in another hall,"(Eva:). I don't expect my love affairs to last for long. Never fool myself that my dreams will come true. Being used to trouble I anticipate it.

Call in three months time and I'll be fine, I know. Well maybe not that fine, but I'll survive anyhow. I won't recall the names and places of each sad occasion. But that's no consolation here and now.. (chorus, with Che's lines being sung by the starlets). (Huevo:)."

autotune baby,"Hearing my father say ""told you so, told you so"". Why can't you be like the other girls. I said, oh no, that's not me. And I don't think that it'll ever me. Thought I'd belong to a different tribe. Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied. Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me. I said, oh no, I don't want it more. That's not what I'm looking for. So I took the road-less. And I barely made it out alive. Through the darkness somehow I survived. Deep down in the dust of my rebel heart. I've spent some time as a narcissist. Hearing the others say ""look at you, look at you! "". Trying to be so provocative. I said ""oh yeah, that was me! """

I'll make this the best night of your life. Lose your self-control, we can go wild. Show you what it means to feel alive. I'll make this the best night of your life. I'll make this the best night of your life. Surrender to the pleasure (wanting). When we breath in together (waiting). It's either now or never (for you). This feeling will take over. No sex tapes, no camera (wanting). Just you and me together (waiting). Repeat it like a mantra (for you). I'm in love, I'm in love. I'll make this the best night of your life. I'll make this the best night of your life. I'll make this the best night of your life. I'll make this the best night of your life. Lose your self-control, we can go wild.

bittersweet,"In my hallucination. I saw my beloved's flower garden. In my vertigo, in my dizziness. In my drunken haze. Whirling and dancing like a spinning wheel. I saw myself as the source of existence. I was there in the beginning. And I was the spirit of love. Now I am sober. There is only the hangover. And the memory of love. And only the sorrow. I yearn for happiness. I ask for help. I want mercy. And my love says. Look at me and hear me. Because I am here. Just for that. I am your moon and your moonlight too. I am your flower garden and your water too. I have come all this way, eager for you. Without shoes or shawl. I want you to laugh. To kill all your worries. To love you. To nourish you. Oh sweet bitterness. I will soothe you and heal you. I will bring you roses. I, too, have been covered with thorns"

confessions,"CLOUD:. I was three feet the floor, gasping for air. trying to realease my father's hands from my throat.. I looked into his eyes and wondered if my feet would ever touch the floor again.. Have you ever been hit so hard that is sends your body diying across the room?. We all fall to the floor at some point.. It's how you pick yourself up - that's the real challenge. Isn't it?. I've açways lived in my own world. I danced to escape my troubles.. I've learned that there's light, even in the darkest places.. I can't blame my father for anything.. You can't rely on other people to make you happy.. But l know deep down inside he loved me.. . SOFIA:. There was a time l suffered so much l wanted toget it out of me.. I would cut my arms, not to kill myself. I don't want to die.. I know I an lucky to be on this earth.. I did it so the physical pain woul cam the pain that was eating me inside.. Not was erased.. I live with my past tucked away deep inside of me.. It comes out, an explosion, and it invades me.. I believe we are messengers on earth. I believe in algels.. I am blessed by God to tell myself I suffered tah much to become who I am today.. . HYPNOSIS:. Now you have to realize, no only do I have a family, but now I have a shole hood - and that's power. But I ain't no grimy ass nigga.. I was never out to kill anybody - especially when I made that decision to gang band.. I just wanted to fit in, But one day. I was forced to do something that made me open my eyes.. I realized that this shit ain't no gang.. One of the hommies got popped, and I was pressured to doing my first drive by.. It was kinda fucked up the way they tried to ser me up.. Me and my bro, we was headed vack to the 8 block and some hommies rolled up and they asked us to go somewhere.. We pulled up to the corner and he placed a chunky ass gun to my mouth.. He said, 'you know ehat to do with it.' It's time to get it poppin' for the hood.. But I wasn't about to kille anybody."
crazy for you,"Swaying room as the music starts. Strangers making the most of the dark. Two by two their bodies become one. I see you through the smokey air. Can't you feel the weight of my stare.

It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss. I'm crazy for you, crazy for you. Trying hard to control my heart. I walk over to where you are. Eye to eye we need no words at all. Slowly now we begin to move. Every breath I'm deeper into you. Soon we two are standing still in time. If you read my mind, you'll see. Chorus. I'm crazy for you. Touch me once and you'll know it's true. I never wanted anyone like this. It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss. I'm crazy for you, crazy for you. It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you.

Hear the laughter running through the love parade. Candy kisses and a sunny day, dear Jessie. See the roses raining on the love parade. If the land of make believe. Is inside your heart it will never leave. There's a golden gate where the fairies all wait. And dancing moons, for you. Close your eyes and you'll be there. Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair. Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old. Where dreams are made, your love parade. Your dreams are made inside the love parade. It's a holiday inside the love parade. On the merry-go-round of lovers and white turtle doves. Leprechauns floating by, this is your lullaby. Sugarplum fingertips kissing your honey lips. Close your eyes sleepy head, is it time for your. bed. Never forget what I said, hang on you're already there. Close your eyes and you'll be there. Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair. Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old. Where dreams are made, your love parade"

goodnight and thank you,"(Che:). Goodnight and thank you Whoever. She is in every magazine. Been photographed, seen, she is known. We don't like to rush, but your case has been packed. If she's missed anything, you could give her a ring. But she won't always answer the phone. (Eva:). Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies. But we have pretended enough. It's best that we both stop fooling ourselves. (Che:). Which means .... Chorus:. (Che and Eva:). There is noone, noone at all. Never has been, and never will be a lover, male or female. Who hasn't an eye on, in fact they rely on. Tricks they can try on their partner. They're hoping their lover will help them or keep them. Support them, promote them. Don't blame them, you're the same. (Che:). Goodnight and thank you Emilio. You've completed your task. What more can we ask of you now?. Please sign the book on the way out the door. And that will be all, if she needs you she'll call. But I don't think that's likely somehow. (Eva:). Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies. But when we were hot, we were hot. I know you'll look back on the good times we've shared. Which means .... (chorus, substituting ""blame her"" for ""blame them"", sung only by Che). (Eva:). There is no soap, no soap like Zaz. No detergent, lotion, or oil with such power in the shower. It's the mother and father of luxury lather. The talk of the bath, the great ointment. One little frolic with new Zaz carbolic. You're scented, you'll be sent. (Che:). Goodnight and thank you Senor Jabon. We are grateful you found her a spot on the sound radio. We'll think of you every time she's on the air. We'd love you to stay but you'd be in the way. So do up your trousers and go. (Eva:). Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies. The decline into silence and doubt. Our passion was just too intense to survive. (Che:). Which means .... (Lovers:). This is a club I should never have joined. Someone has made us look fools. Argentine men call the sexual shots. Someone has altered the rules. (Eva:). Fame on the wireless as far as it goes. Is all very well but every girl knows. (Che:). She needs a man she can monopolize. With fingers in dozens of different pies. (Lovers:)"

And you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where I have roots. Remember. That on that day, at that hour, I shall lift my arms. And my roots will set off to seek another land. But, if each day, each hour, you feel that you are destined for me. With implacable sweetness. If each day a flower climbs up to your lips to seek me. Ahh my love, ahh my own, in me all that fire is repeated. In me nothing is extinguished or forgotten. My love feeds on your love, beloved"

Though I would have been the shadow. Of your shadow. If you might have kept me. By your side. .. If you go away. If you go away. If you go away.... .. If you go away. If you go away.... Please, don't go away.. ®MJ"

He knew the day was dawning. And I didn't have a chance to say goodbye. Chorus:. In this life I loved you most of all. What for?. 'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself. What for?. What for?. Driving down the boulevard. Thinking about a man I knew. He was like a father to me. Nothing in the world that he wouldn't do. Taught me to respect myself. Said that we're all made of flesh and blood. Why should he be treated differently. Shouldn't matter who you choose to love. (chorus). Intermediate:. People pass by and I wonder who's next. Who determines, who knows best. Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn in this case. Ignorance is not bliss. (chorus). (intermediate). Have you ever watched your best friend die [what for]. Have you ever watched a grown man cry [what for]. Some say that life isn't fair [what for]. I say that people just don't care [what for]. They'd rather turn the other way [what for]. And wait for this thing to go away [what for]. Why do we have to pretend [what for]. Some day I pray it will end. I hope it's in this life. I hope it's in this life time."

keep it together,"Keep, keep it together. Keep people together forever and ever. I got brothers, I got some sisters too. Stuck in the middle tell you what I'm gonna do. Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place. So I can forget every single hungry face. I'm tired of sharing all the hand me downs. To get attention I must always be the clown. I wanna be different, I wanna be on my own. But Daddy said listen, you will always have a home. Keep it together in the family. They're a reminder of your history. Brothers and sisters they hold the key. To your heart and your soul. Don't forget that your family is gold. I hit the big time but I still get the blues. Everyone's a stranger, city life can get to you. People can be so cold, never want to turn your back. Just givin' to get something. Always wanting something back. When I get lonely and I need to be. Loved for who I am, not what they want to see. Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me. We have a connection, home is where the heart should be. When I look back on all the misery. And all the heartache that they brought to me. I wouldn't change it for another chance. 'Cause blood is thicker than any other circumstance. When I get lonely and I need to be. Loved for who I am, not what they want to see. Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me. We have a connection, home is where the heart should be. Keep, keep it together. Keep people together forever and ever."

la isla bonita,"(Spoken:). Como puede ser verdad. How could it be true?. Last night I dreamt of San Pedro. Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song. A young girl with eyes like the desert. It all seems like yesterday, not far away. Chorus:. Tropical the island breeze. All of nature wild and free. This is where I long to be. La isla bonita. And when the samba played. The sun would set so high. Ring through my ears and sting my eyes. Your Spanish lullaby. The beautiful island. I fell in love with San Pedro. Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me. Te dijo te amo. I prayed that the days would last. They went so fast. He told you, ""I love you"". (chorus). I want to be where the sun warms the sky. When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by. Beautiful faces, no cares in this world. Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl. Last night I dreamt of San Pedro. It all seems like yesterday, not far away. (chorus twice). La la la la la la la. Te dijo te amo. La la la la la la la. El dijo que te ama. He told you, ""I love you"". He said he loves you"
lament,"(Eva:). The choice was mine, and mine completely. I could have any prize that I desired. I could burn with the splendor of the brightest fire. Or else, or else I could choose time. Remember I was very young then. And a year was forever and a day. So what use could fifty, sixty, seventy be?. I saw the lights, and I was on my way. And how I lived, how they shone. But how soon the lights were gone. (Che:). The choice was yours and noone else's. You can cry for a body in despair. Hang your head because she is no longer there. To shine, to dazzle, or betray. How she lived, how she shone. But how soon the lights were gone. (Embalmers:). Eyes, hair, face, image. All must be preserved. Still life displayed forever."
land of the free,"Land of the free. (uh huh, uh huh, uh huh). I looked all around the world. Nobody has it better than we do. One thing I don’t understand. Why don’t we help more people. Cause we can. (uh huh, uh huh). Why are we separated?. Defined by our greed and hatred. Why aren’t we all united?. I’m so sick and tired of fighting. Why aren’t we all together. Let’s end this fight forever. Why are we still divided?. I’m so sick and tired of fighting. (uh huh, uh huh, uh huh). How many tragedies. Will we see before we come together. (uh huh). It’s easy to forget. We have the power to make things better. (uh huh, uh huh). I have a dream. But dreams are not for free. We all need to change. Or just repeat history. Why are we separated?. Defined by our greed and hatred. Why aren’t we all united?. I’m so sick and tired of fighting. Why aren’t we all together. Let’s end this fight forever. Why are we still divided?. I’m so sick and tired of fighting. Just repeat history (repeat several times)"
latin chant,"(Choir:). Respice, quaesumus, Domine. Famulam tuam Evita. In infirmitate. Et animam refove, quam creasti. Ut castigationibus emendata. Se tua sentiat medicina salvatam. Per Christum, Dominuum. Qui vivit et regnat. Per omnia saecula saeculorum. Amen. (Translation:. Look with favor, we beseech Thee, Oh Lord. Upon Thy handmaid Evita. In her weakness. And refresh the soul which Thou hast created. That being corrected by Thy chastisement. She may find herself cured by Thy healing. Through Christ, Our Lord. Who lives and reigns. Forever and ever. Amen ). . (Che:). She had her moments, she had some style. The best show in town was the crowd. Outside the Casa Rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""."

like an angel passing through my room,"Long awaited darkness falls. Casting shadows on the walls. In the twilight hour I am alone. Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face. In this peaceful solitude. All the outside world subdued. Everything comes back to me again. In the gloom. Like an angel passing through my room. Half awake and half in dreams. Seeing long forgotten scenes. So the present runs into the past. Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind. Like the embers as they die. Love was one prolonged good-bye. And it all comes back to me tonight. In the gloom. Like an angel passing through my room. I close my eyes. And my twilight images go by. All too soon. Like an angel passing through my room"

Your love for me will grow. Because. This is who I am. You can like it or not. You can love me or leave me. Cause I'm never gonna stop, no no. Cleopatra had her way. Matahari too.

little boy lost (1980 demo),He runs through the streets and his socks goin down. And his eyes they burn as they touch the ground. Baseball cap holds out the pain. Sad no one hears today. Goes through the house and he looks for food. He feels so bad but he knows he's good. He lays down on the kitchen floor. He ain't hungry no more. Little boy lost. Little boy lamb. How much does it cost. To understand. Little boy say oh. Why do you cry. How much would you pay. To know why. Sometimes at night he wets his bed. And his dreams play tricks inside his bed. He wakes up cold turns on the light. There's no one here tonight oh. Little boy lost. Little boy lamb. How much does it cost. To understand. Little boy say. Why do you cry. How much would you pay. To know why

Living for love. I'm living for love. Not gonna stop. Love's gonna lift me up. Love. Lift me up. (Love's gonna lift me up). Love. Lift me up. (Love's gonna lift me up). Lift me up. (Love's gonna lift me up). Up, up, up, up. Now lift me up, up, up, up. Love's gonna lift me up. (Love's gonna lift me up). Up, up, up, up. Now lift me up, up, up, up. Love's gonna lift me up. Now lift me up. Now lift me up, up, up, up. Living for love. Living for love. I'm not giving up. I'm gonna carry on. Living for love. I'm living for love. Not gonna stop. Love's gonna lift me up. ""Man is the cruelst animal. At tragedy, bullfight and crucifixions. He has felt best on Earth"""
love don't live here anymore,"CHORUS:. You abandoned me. Love don't live here anymore. Just a vacancy. Love don't live here anymore. When you lived inside of me. There was nothing I could conceive. That you wouldn't do for me. Trouble seemed so far away. You changed that right away, baby. CHORUS. Love don't live here anymore. Just emptiness and memories. Of what we had before. You went away. Found another place to stay, another home. CHORUS. In the windmills of my eyes. Everyone can see the loneliness inside me. Why'd ya have to go away. Don't you know I miss you so and need your love. CHORUS"
love makes the world go round,Make love not war we say. It's easy to recite. But it don't mean a damn. Unless we're gonna fight. But not with guns and knives. We've got to save the lives. Of every boy and girl. That grows up in this world. Chorus:. There's hunger everywhere. We've got to take a stand. Reach out for someone's hand. Love makes the world go round. It's easy to forget. If you don't hear the sound. Of pain and prejudice. Love makes the world go round. They think that love's a lie. But we can teach them how to try. Love means to understand. Reach out for someone's hand. 'Cause everything you do. Comes back in time to you. We have to change our fate. Before it gets too late. (chorus). Don't judge a man 'til you've been standin' in his shoes. You know that we're all so quick to look away. 'Cause it's the easy thing to do. You know that what I say is true. Love makes the world go round.... Make love not war we say. It's easy to recite. But it don't mean a damn. Unless we're gonna fight. (chorus).
love profusion,There are too many questions. There is not one solution. There is no resurrection. There is so much confusion. And the love profusion. You make me feel. You make me know. And the love vibration. You make me feel. You make it shine. There are too many options. There is no consolation. I have lost my illusions. What I want is an explanation. And the love profusion. You make me feel. You make me know. And the love direction. You make me feel. You make me shine. You make me feel. You make me shine. You make me feel. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. There is no comprehension. There is real isolation. There is so much destruction. What I want is a celebration. And I know I can feel bad. When I get in a bad mood. And the world can look so sad. Only you make me feel good. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. And the love profusion. You make me feel. You make me know. And the love intention. You make me feel. You make me shine. You make me feel. You make me shine. You make me feel. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. I got you under my skin. And I know I can feel bad. When I get in a bad mood. And the world can look so sad. Only you make me feel good

love tried to welcome me,"These are my hands, but what can they give me?. These are my eyes, but they cannot see. These are my arms, but they don't know tenderness. And I must confess that I am usually drawn to sadness. And loneliness has never been a stranger to me, but. Chorus:. Love tried to welcome me. But my soul drew back. Guilty of lust and sin. Love tried to take me in. These are my lips, but they whisper sorrow. This is my voice, but it's telling lies. I know how to laugh, but I don't know happiness.

love won't wait,"When I first saw your face. I knew that I could not hesitate. You said 'Baby, don't go too fast'. If we do then it may not last. Time went on and I waited for you. I didn't know what else I could do. I thought that we'd always be together. You said 'Hold on it just gets better'. And I believed you, I kept holding on. You think that I can never leaved you. You think I'm not that strong, you're wrong. Love won't wait. Forever and a day. Love must live in the here and now. Don't ask me how I know. So here I am with my heart on my sleeves. You said, 'Baby put your trust in me'. But I've come to the end of the line. And you've wasted up all of my precious time. Wanted to be something special to you. Everybody is somebody's fool. Won't be a fool, no you've got me all wrong. You don't know what you had till it's gone. Love takes time. But you've been taking too long. Time never waited for anyone. Don't wait too long or I'll be gone. Don't wait too long or I'll be gone. I'll be gone. That was an empty thing that I wouldn't do. You led me on, you even said 'I love you'. How can we go on when it's tearing up apart. Are you going to break my heart. Cause I believed you"

masterpiece,"If you were the Mona Lisa. You'd be hanging in the Louvre. Everyone would come to see you. You'd be impossible to move. It seems to me it's what you are. A rare and priceless work of art. Stay behind your velvet rope. But I will not renounce all hope. And I'm right by your side. Like a thief in the night. I stand in front of a masterpiece. And I can't tell you why. It hurts so much. To be in love with the masterpiece. 'Cause after all. Nothing's indestructible. From the moment I first saw you. All the darkness turned to light. An impressionistic painting. Tiny particles of light. It seems to me it's what you're like. The ""look but please don't touch me"" type. And honestly it can't be fun. To always be the chosen one. And I'm right by your side. Like a thief in the night. I stand in front of a masterpiece. And I can't tell you why. It hurts so much. To be in love with a masterpiece. 'Cause after all.

material girl,"Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me. I think they're o.k.. If they don't give me proper credit. I just walk away. They can beg and they can plead.

You know that we are living in a material world. And I am a material girl. Some boys romance, some boys slow dance. That's all right with me. If they can't raise my interest then I. Have to let them be. Some boys try and some boys lie, but. I don't let them play (no way). Only boys that save their pennies. Make my rainy day. 'Cause we're living in a material world. And I am a material girl. You know that we are living in a material world. And I am a material girl. Boys may come and boys may go. And that's all right you will see. Experience has made me rich.

mer girl,"I ran from my house that cannot contain me. From the man that I cannot keep. From my mother who haunts me, even though she's gone. From my daughter that never sleeps. I ran from the noise and the silence. From the traffic on the streets. I ran to the treetops, I ran to the sky. Out to the lake, into the rain. that matted my hair. And soaked my shoes and skin. Hid my tears, hid my fears. I ran to the forest, I ran to the trees. I ran and I ran, I was looking for me. I ran past the churches and the crooked old mailbox. Past the apple orchards and the lady that never talks. Up into the hills, I ran to the cemetery. And held my breath, and thought about your death. I ran to the lake, up into the hills. I ran and I ran, I'm looking there still. And I saw the crumbling tombstones. All forgotten names. I tasted the rain, I tasted my tears. I cursed the angels, I tasted my fears. And the ground gave way beneath my feet. And the earth took me in her arms. Leaves covered my face. Ants marched across my back. Black sky opened up, blinding me. I ran to the forest, I ran to the trees. I ran and I ran, I was looking for me. I ran to the lakes and up to the hill. I ran and I ran, I'm looking there still. And I smelled her burning flesh. Her rotting bones. Her decay. I ran and I ran. I'm still running away"

miss you (american life sessions demo),"Miss you most of all. When all those autumn leaves start to fall. Drifting by my window. They come up over the wall. Why does a good thing have to do end. Can't see it happen where and when. Cycle of change can be so cruel. I've got no one to blame I'm just a fool, you know. Hold on they keep on telling me. Something's good is gonna come. Bread and gold has put its spell on me. And old man winter's gonna come. You know he keeps on blocking off the sun. Miss you most of all. When they burn those bonfires tall. Smoke and ashes fill the air and the. Harvesters are everywhere. No time to waste, let's drink the wine. Don't let the fruit rot on the vine. When the sun is big and fiery it goes, you know. That is the time I miss you the most, they say. Hold on they keep on telling me. Something's good is gonna come. Bread and gold has put its spell on me. And old man winter's gonna come. You know he keeps on blocking off the sun. Cold wind is howling and there's. Darkness creeps in our bones. Seasons change, why didn't we. Come on bring that summer back to me. Hold on they keep on telling me. Something's good is gonna come. Bread and gold has put its spell on me. And old man winter's gonna come. You know he keeps on blocking off the sun.

more,"Once upon a time I had plenty of nothing,. Which was fine with me.. Because I had rhythm, music, love,. The sun, the stars and the moon above,. Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea.. That was when the best things in life were free.. Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty,. Which is fine with me.. 'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm,. But look at what I got to go with 'em.. ""Who could ask for anything more?"", I hear you query.. Who would ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.. Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore.. I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!. Count your blessings, one, two, three. I just hate keeping score.. Any number is fine with me. As long as it's more. As long as it's more!. I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition. I find counting a bore.. Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.. [More! More!]. I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before. Got my guy and my sky of blue,. Now, however, I own the view.. More is better than nothing, true. But nothing's better than more, more, more. Nothing's better than more.. One is fun, why not two?. And if you like two, you might as well have four,. And if you like four, why not a few. Why not a slew. [More! More!]. If you've got a little, why not a lot?. Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.. Every jot and tittle adds to the pot. Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.. [More! More!]. Never say when, never stop at plenty,. If it's gonna rain, let it pour.. Happy with ten, happier with twenty. If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?. Or does that sound too greedy?. That's not greed, no, indeedy. That's just stocking the store. Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard.. [More! More!]. Each possession you possess. Helps your spirits to soar.. That's what's soothing about excess. Never settle for something less.. Something's better than nothing, yes!. But nothing's better than more, more more. [Except all, all, all]. Except all, all, all. Except once you have it all [have it all]. You may find all else above [find all else above]. That though things are bliss,. There's one thing you miss, and that's. More! More!. More! More! More! More!."
mother and father,There was a time I was happy in my life. There was time I believed I'd live forever. There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ. There was a time I had a. mother. It was nice.

oh father,"It's funny that way, you can get used. To the tears and the pain. What a child will believe. You never loved me. You can't hurt me now. I got away from you, I never thought I would. You can't make me cry, you once had the power. I never felt so good about myself. Seems like yesterday. I lay down next to your boots and I prayed. For your anger to end. Oh Father I have sinned. You can't hurt me now. I got away from you, I never thought I would. You can't make me cry, you once had the power. I never felt so good about myself. Oh Father you never wanted to live that way. You never wanted to hurt me. Why am I running away. Maybe someday. When I look back I'll be able to say. You didn't mean to be cruel. Somebody hurt you too. You can't hurt me now. I got away from you, I never thought I would. You can't make me cry, you once had the power. I never felt so good about myself"
oh what a circus,"(Che:). Oh what a circus, oh what a show. Argentina has gone to town. Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron. We've all gone crazy. Mourning all day and mourning all night. Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right. Oh what an exit, that's how to go. When they're ringing your curtain down. Demand to be buried like Eva Peron. It's quite a sunset. And good for the country in a roundabout way. We've made the front page of all the world's papers today. But who is this Santa Evita?. Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?. What kind of goddess has lived among us?. How will we ever get by without her?. She had her moments, she had some style. The best show in town was the crowd. Outside the Casa Rosada crying, ""Eva Peron"". But that's all gone now. As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears. We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years. (Crowd:). Salve regina mater misericordiae. Vita dulcedo et spes nostra. Salve salve regina. Ad te clamamus exules filii Eva. Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes. O clemens o pia. Hail, oh queen, mother of mercy. Our life, sweetness, and hope. Hail, hail, oh queen. To you we cry, exiled sons of Eve. To you we sigh, mourning and weeping. Oh clement, oh loving one. . (Che:). You let down your people Evita. You were supposed to have been immortal. That's all they wanted, not much to ask for. But in the end you could not deliver. Sing you fools, but you got it wrong. Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long. Your queen is dead, your king is through. And she's not coming back to you. Show business kept us all alive. Since seventeen October 1945. But the star has gone, the glamour's worn thin. That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in. Instead of government we had a stage. Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage. Instead of help we were given a crowd. She didn't say much, but she said it loud. Sing you fools, but you got it wrong. Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long. Your queen is dead, your king is through. She's not coming back to you. (Crowd:). Salve regina mater misericordiae. Vita dulcedo et spes nostra. Salve salve regina Peron. Ad te clamamus exules filii Eva. Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes. O clemens o pia. (Eva:). Don't cry for me Argentina. For I am ordinary, unimportant. And undeserving of such attention. Unless we all are, I think we all are. So share my glory, so share my coffin. So share my glory, so share my coffin. (Che:)."
on the balcony of the casa rosada 1,"(Peron has just won a sweeping victory in the 1946 Presidential. election. This is the first public appearance by Peron and Eva. since that triumph.). (Announcer:). People of Argentina. Your newly elected President, Juan Peron. (Crowd chanting:). [Peron Peron ... ]. (Peron:). Argentinos, Argentinos. We are all workers now. Fighting against our common enemies. Poverty, social injustice. Foreign domination of our industries. Reaching for our common goals. Our independence, our dignity, our pride. Let the world know that our great nation is awakening. And that its heart beats in the humble bodies. Of Juan Peron and his wife. The first lady of Argentina, Eva Duarte de Peron. (Crowd chanting:)."
on the balcony of the casa rosada 2,"(Eva:). Just listen to that, the voice of Argentina. We are adored, we are loved. (Officer:). Statesmanship is more than entertaining peasants. (Eva's sister:). We shall see little man. (Crowd:). [Evita Peron, La Santa Peronista ... ]. (Eva:). I am only a simple woman. Who lives to serve Peron in his noble crusade. To rescue his people. I was once as you are now, and I promise you this. We will take the riches from the obligarchs. Only for you, for all of you. And one day, you too will inherit these treasures. Descamisados, mis companeros. When they fire those cannons, when the crowds sing of glory. It is not just for Peron, but for all of us, for all of us. (Aristocrats:). Things have reached a pretty pass. When someone pretty lower-class. Can be respected and admired. (Aristocrat:). But our privileged class is dead."
on this night of a thousand stars,"(Che:). Now Eva Peron had every disadvantage. You need if you're gonna succeed. No money, no cash. No father, no bright lights. There was nowhere she'd been. At the age of fifteen. As this tango singer found out. Agustin Magaldi. Who has the distinction of being the first. Man to be of use to Eva Duarte. (Magaldi:). On this night of a thousand stars. Let me take you to heaven's door. Where the music of love's guitars. Plays for evermore. In the glow of those twinkling lights. We shall love through eternity. On this night in a million nights. Fly away with me. I never dreamed that a kiss could be as sweet as this. But now I know that it can. I used to wander alone without a love of my own. I was a desperate man. But all my grief disappeared and all the sorrow I'd feared. Wasn't there anymore. On that magical day when you first came my way. Mi amor. On this night. On this night. On this night of a thousand stars. Let me take you to heaven's door. Where the music of love's guitars."
one more chance,"I turned around too late to see the fallen star. I fell asleep and never saw the sun go down. I took your love for granted. Thought luck was always on my side. I turned around too late and you were gone. Chorus:. So give me one more chance. Darlin' if you care for me. Let me win your love. 'Cause you were always there for me. If you care for me,. Be there for me. I like to play the queen of hearts and never thought I'd lose. I rolled the dice but never showed my hand. I planned it out so perfectly,. So you'd never leave a girl like me. I was a fool, but now I understand. (chorus). Here is the law of the land. You play with fire and you'll get burned. Here is the lesson I've learned. That you don't know what you've got til it's gone. (chorus, without last two lines). Gimme one more chance. Tell me that it's not too late. Let me win your love. Darlin' please don't hesitate. If you care for me,. Be there for me. Give me one more chance."
open your heart,"I see you on the street and you walk on by. You make me wanna hang my head down and cry. If you gave me half a chance you'd see. My desire burning inside of me. But you choose to look the other way. I've had to work much harder than this. For something I want don't try to resist me. Open your heart to me, baby. I hold the lock and you hold the key. Open your heart to me, darlin'. I'll give you love if you, you turn the key. I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes. You look a little sad boy, I wonder why. I follow you around but you can't see. You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice. So you choose to look the other way. Well, I've got something to say. Don't try to run I can keep up with you. Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to. Open your heart with the key. One is such a lonely number. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Open your heart, I'll make you love me. It's not that hard, if you just turn the key. Don't try to run I can keep up with you. Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to. Open your heart with the key. Open your heart, I'll make you love me. It's not that hard, if you just turn the key."
over and over,"Hurry up, I just can't wait. I gotta do it now I can't be late. I know I'm not afraid I gotta get out the door. If I don't do it now I won't get anymore. You try to criticize my drive. If I lose I don't feel paralyzed. It's not the game it's how you play. And if I fall I get up again now. Chorus:. I get up again, over and over. I get up again, over and over. I get up again, over and over. I get up again, over and over. Got past my first mistake. I'll only give as much as I can take. You're never gonna see me standin' still. I'm never gonna stop 'till I get my fill. It doesn't matter who you are. It's what you do that takes you far. And if at first you don't succeed. Here's some advice that you should heed. (chorus, substituting ""You"" for ""I""). I'm not afraid to say I hear a different beat, oh. And I'll go out in the street, yeah. And I will shout it again. From the highest mountain. Hurry up (3 vezes). Hurry up, I just can't wait. I gotta do it now I can't be late. I know I'm not afraid I gotta get out the door. If I don't do it now I won't get anymore. You try to criticize my drive. If I lose I don't feel paralyzed. It's not the game it's how you play. And if I fall I get up again now. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Shout it, shout it, shout it, ah.

partido feminista,"(Crowd:). [Evita Peron, Partido Feminista]. (repeat in background). (Eva:). Peron is everything, he is the soul, the nerve. The hope and the reality of the Argentine people. We all know that there is only one man in our movement. With his own source of light. We all feed from his light, and that is Peron. (Che:). And now she wants to be vice-president. (Officers:). That was the over-the-top, unacceptable suggestion. We didn't approve but we couldn't prevent. The games of the wife of the president. But to give her pretensions encouragement"
peron's latest flame,"(Che:) At the watering holes of the well-to-do. I detect a resistance to. (Aristocrats:) Precisely. (Che:) Our heroine's style. (Aristocrats:) We're glad you noticed. (Che:) The shooting sticks of the upper-class. (Aristocrats:) Give her an inch. (Che:) Aren't supporting a single ass. That would rise for the girl. (Aristocrats:) She'll take a mile. (Aristocrats:). Such a shame she wandered into our enclosure. How unfortunate this person has forced us to be blunt. No we wouldn't mind seeing her at Harrod's. But behind the jewelry counter, not in front. (Che:) Could there be in our fighting corps. A lack of enthusiasm for. (Army:) Exactly. (Che:) Peron's latest flame. (Army:) You said it brother. (Che:). Should you wish to cause great distress. In the tidiest officer's mess. Just mention her name. (Army:). That isn't funny. Peron is a fool, breaking every taboo. Installing a girl in the army H.Q.. And she's an actress, the last straw. Her only good parts are between her thighs. She should stare at the ceiling, not reach for the skies. Or she could be his last whore. The evidence suggests. She has other interests. If it's her who's using him. He's exceptionally dim. Bitch! Dangerous Jade. (Aristocrats:). We have allowed ourselves to slip. We have completely lost our grip. We have declined to an all-time low. Tarts have become the set to know. (Eva:). I am only a radio star with just one weekly show. But speaking as one of the people I want you to know. We are tired of the decline of Argentina. With no sign of a government able to give us the things we deserve. (Army:). It's no crime for officers to do as they please. As long as they're discreet and keep clear of disease. We ignore, we disregard. But once they allow a bit on the side. To move to the center where she's not qualified. We are forced to mark his card. She should get into her head. She should not get out of bed. She should know that she's not paid. To be loud but to be laid. Slut! Dangerous Jade. (Che:). This has really been your year, Miss Duarte. Tell us where you go from here, Miss Duarte. Which are the roles that you yearn to play?. Whom did you sleep ... dine with yesterday?. (Eva:). Acting is limiting, the line's not mine. That's no help to the Argentine. (Che:). Can we assume then that you'll quit?. Is this because of your involvement with Colonel Peron?. (Heavies:). Goodnight and thank you. (Army:). She won't be kept happy by her nights on the tiles. She says it's his body, but she's after his files. So get back on to the street. She should get into her head. She should not get out of bed. She should know that she's not paid. To be loud but to be laid. The evidence suggests. She has other interests. If it's her who's using him. He's exceptionally dim. (Aristocrats:). Things have reached a pretty pass. When someone pretty lower-class. Graceless and vulgar, uninspired."

promise to try,"Little girl don't you forget her face. Laughing away your tears. When she was the one who felt all the pain. Little girl never forget her eyes. Keep them alive inside. I promise to try -- it's not the same. Keep your head held high -- ride like the wind. Never look behind, life isn't fair. That's what you said, so I try not to care. Little girl don't run away so fast. I think you forgot to kiss -- kiss her goodbye. Will she see me cry when I stumble and fall. Does she hear my voice in the night when I call. Wipe away all your tears, it's gonna be all right. I fought to be so strong, I guess you knew. I was afraid you'd go away, too. Little girl you've got to forget the past. And learn to forgive me. I promise to try -- but it feels like a lie. Don't let memory play games with your mind. She's a faded smile frozen in time. I'm still hanging on -- but I'm doing it wrong. Can't kiss her goodbye -- but I promise to try."

rainbow high,"(Eva:). There again I've more to do. Than simply get the message through. I haven't started. Let's get this show on the road. Let's make it obvious. Peron is off and rolling. Chorus:. (Eva's dressers:). Eyes, hair, mouth, figure. Dress, voice, style, movement. Hands, magic, rings, glamour. Face, diamonds, excitement, image. (Eva:). I came from the people, they need to adore me. So Christian Dior me from my head to my toes. I need to be dazzling, I want to be Rainbow High. They must have excitement, and so must I. (Eva's dressers:). Eyes, hair, mouth, figure.

They need their escape, and so do I. (chorus). (Eva:). All my descamisados expect me to outshine the enemy. I won't disappoint them. I'm their savior, that's what they call me. So Lauren Bacall me, anything goes. To make me fantastic, I have to be Rainbow High. In magical colors. You're not decorating a girl for a night on the town. And I'm not a second-rate queen getting kicks with a crown. Next stop will be Europe. The Rainbow's gonna tour, dressed up, somewhere to go. We'll put on a show. Look out, mighty Europe.

rainbow tour,"(Peron:). People of Europe, I send you the Rainbow of Argentina. (Che:). Spain has fallen to the charms of Evita. She can do what she likes, it doesn't matter much. (Aide #1:). She's our lady of the new world with a golden touch. (Aide #2:). She filled a bull-ring, forty-five thousand seater. (Che:). But if you're prettier than General Franco, that's not hard. (Aide #1:). Franco's reign in Spain should see out the forties. So you've just acquired an ally who. Looks as secure in his job as you. (Aide #2:). But more important current political thought is. Your wife's a phenomenal asset, your trump card. Chorus:. (Peron and Aides:). Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour. It's been an incredible success. We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts. (Peron:) Will Evita win through?. (Aides:) But the answer is yes. (Peron:). There you are, I told you so. Makes no difference where she goes. The whole world over just the same. Just listen to them call her name. And who would underestimate the actress now?. (Che:). Now I don't like to spoil a wonderful story. But the news from Rome isn't quite as good. She hasn't gone down like they thought she would. Italy's unconvinced by Argentine glory. They equate Peron with Mussolini, can't think why. (Eva:). Did you hear that? They called me a whore!. They actually called me a whore!. (Italian admiral:). But Signora Peron it's an easy mistake. I'm still called an admiral. Yet I gave up the sea long ago. (Aide #2:). More bad news from Rome; she met with the Pope. She only got a rosary, a kindly word. (Che:). I wouldn't say the Holy Father gave her the bird. But papal decorations, never a hope. (Aide #1:). She still looked the part at St. Peter's, caught the eye. (chorus). (Peron:) Will Evita win through?. (Aides:) But the answer is .... (Che:) A qualified. (Aides:) Yes. (Che:). Eva started well, no question, in France. Shining like a sun through the post-war haze. A beautiful reminder of the care-free days. She nearly captured the French, she sure had the chance. But she suddenly seemed to lose interest. She looked tired. (Che:). Face the facts, the Rainbow's starting to fade. I don't think she'll make it to England now. (Aide #1:). It wasn't on the schedule anyhow. (Che:). You'd better get out the flags and fix a parade. Some kind of coming home in triumph is required. (chorus). (Aide #2:) Would Evita win through?. (Aide #1:) And the answer is. (Aide #2:) Yes. (Che:) And no. (Aides:) And yes. (Che:) And no. (Aides:) And yes. (Che:) No. (chorus). (Aides:) Would Evita win through? But the answer is.

rebel heart,"I lived my life like a masochist. Hearing my father say: Told you so, told you so?. ""Why can't you be like the other girls? "". I said: 'Oh no, that's not me. And I don't think that it'll ever be'. Thought I belong to a different tribe, walking alone. Never satisfied, satisfied. Tried to fit in but it wasn't me. I said: 'Oh no, I want more. That's not what I'm looking for?. So I took the road less travelled by. And I barely made it out alive. Through the darkness somehow I survived. Tough love, I knew it from the start. Deep down in the depth. Of my rebel heart. Of my rebel heart. I spent some time as a narcissist. Hearing the other say: Look at you, look at you?. Trying to be so provocative. I said: Oh yeah, that was me'. All the things I did just to be seen. Outgrown my past and. I've shed my skin. Letting it go and I'll start again, start again. Never look back. It's a waste of time, I said: 'Oh yeah, this is me'. And I'm right here where I wanna be. I said: 'Hell yeah! This is me'. Right where I'm supposed to be. So I took the road less travelled by. And I barely made it out alive. Through the darkness somehow I survived. Tough love, I knew it from the start. Deep down in my Rebel Heart. So I took the road less travelled by.

rebel heart tour intro,"Medieval warrior bitch goddess. That's what I'm going for. Blood, sweat and tears. Blood, sweat, tears. When you are prepared for anything. You are prepared for war. This is the beginning of a crazy ride. The great thing about the war that we fight every night. is that we bring no harm to people. We just bring love, inspiration. And people need it. Blood, sweat and tears. This is it, people. It's showtime. I'm a woman, I'm a blonde. I have tits and an ass, and an insatiable desire to be noticed. ""Come on, baby. Show us your ass. Shake it for us, baby. Do that dance you do so well for us, baby"". Okay. But I still want to start a revolution. Somebody's got to. (Iconic). (Iconic). (Born to be a superstar). (That's exactly what you are). (Born to be a superstar). (That's exactly what you are). There's too much beauty in the world going to waste. Too much talent going unnoticed. Too much creativity being crushed beneath the wheel of corporate branding and what's trending. But it's time to wake up. And I looked into the eyes of people and I saw helplessness. I saw hopelessness. I saw humans searching for a way out. (Mike Tyson: Watch me, people. I am great and I am somebody. I've been up and down so many times. No one could ever stop me cause I'm somebody. I am beautiful!). Because when those Fascist dictators posing as righteous men come for you. with their big leather boots to shut you up. To put a gag in your mouth. You better be prepared to fight for what you believe in. You better be prepared to die for what you believe in"
remembering your touch,Time passes much too slowly. When I'm waiting for you. Thinking of your arms around me. Is all I can do. You don't know what it means to love. You don't know it's worth. So how could you know that this aching inside me. Is so strong that it hurts?. (Chorus:). And I'm wondering where you are. And I'm looking up at the stars. Wishing that it didn't hurt so much. Remembering your touch. I'm wishing that it didn't hurt so much. Remembering your touch. You never said goodbye. I woke up and found you were gone. You take what you can from each situation. And then you move on. You'll never change your ways. And I was a fool to believe. So if you have so many admirers. Why did you pick on me?. (chorus - 2x).

sanctuary,"(Spoken:). Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice. Him or her I shall follow. Who needs the sun, when the rain's so full of life. Who needs the sky.

It's here in your heart I want to be carried. You are my sanctuary. Who needs the light, with the darkness in your eyes. Who needs to sleep, with the stars in the sky. It's here in your soul I want to be married. You are my sanctuary. (Spoken:). And the earth was void and empty. And darkness was upon the face of the earth. Is all of this pain so necessary. You are my sanctuary. (Spoken:). Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice. Him or her I shall follow. As the water follows the moon, silently. Who needs the sun [with fluid steps]. Who needs the sky [around the globe]. Who needs to sleep [I hear your voice]. You are [you are] my sanctuary. You are [you are, you are]."

secret garden,"In my secret garden, I'm looking for the perfect flower. Waiting for my finest hour. In my secret garden, I still believe after all. I still believe and I fall. You plant the seed and I'll watch it grow. I wonder when I'll start to show. I wonder if I'll ever know. Where my place is. Where my face is. I know it's in here somewhere. I just wish I knew the color of my hair. I know the answer's hiding somewhere. In my secret garden, there's. Chorus:. A petal that isn't torn. A heart that will not harden. A place that I can be born. In my secret garden. A rose without a thorn. A lover without scorn. If I wait for the rain to kiss me and undress me. Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess. Will I still be thirsty. Will I pass the test. And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it. Or will it pass right by. 'Cause I'm not supposed to see. 'Cause the blind are never free. Even at my secret garden. There's a chance that I could harden. That's why I'll keep on looking, for. (chorus). I still believe, I still believe. 'Cause after all is said and done. I'm still alive. And the boots have come and trampled on me. And I'm still alive. 'Cause the sun has kissed me, and caressed me. And I'm strong, and there's a chance. That I will grow, this I know. So I'm still looking for. (chorus, inserting ""It's"" before ""In my secret garden""). Somewhere in fountain blue. Lies my secret garden."

she is a diamond,"(Peron:). But on the other hand, she's all they have. She's a diamond in their dull gray lives. And that's the hardest kind of stone. It usually survives. And when you think about it, can you recall. The last time they loved anyone at all?. She's not a bauble you can brush aside. She's been out doing what we just talked about, example. Gave us back our businesses, got the English out. And when you think about it, well why not do. One or two of the things we promised to?. But on the other hand, she's slowing down. She's lost a little of that magic drive. But I would not advise those critics present to derive. Any satisfaction from her fading star. She's the one who's kept us where we are. (Officers:)."
she's not me,"I should've seen the signs way back then. When she told me that you were her best friend. And now she's rollin' rollin' rollin'. And you were stolen stolen stolen.

And stealing my looks and lingerie. I just wanna be there when you discover. You wake up in the morning. Next to your new lover. She might make you breakfast. And love you in the shower. The thrill is momentary. Cuz she don't have what's ours. She's not me. She doesn't have my name. She'll never have what I have. It won't be the same (it won't be the same). She is licking her lips.

I guarantee you will find. She's not me. I know I can do it better. If someone wants to pimp your style. And hang with you a little while. And make up for the things you lack. You're gonna have to watch your back. She's not me. She doesn't have my name. She'll never have what I have. It won't be the same (it won't be the same). Never let you forget.

sidewalk talk,"with Jellybean.... Watch where you walk ’cause the sidewalks talk. And you can’t keep a secret from the ground beneath you. Step very lightly on the earth below. Or before you know it everyone will know. Streets were paved with a thousand eyes. And try as you may you can’t disguise. There’s only two things that you can’t hide from. That’s you and the ground you’re walking on. Chorus:. Watch where you walk, ’cause the sidewalks talk. You better watch what you do, what you do. ’cause the sidewalk talk can get carried away. You better watch what you say, what you say. Think when you speak ’cause you gotta ’long the street. They can read what you say so you gotta stay away. From words that sting, words are not true. And the things you say make a fool of you. Little white lies make the sidewalk cry. And you can betray with the things you say. Words won’t last when you say ’em too fast. And you’ve been mislead by the things you’ve said. (chorus). Intermediate:. When you’re living on the street. Life can be full of misery. Find a place to call your own. Make your heart into a home. You can do it, uh huh. (repeat 3 times). You can do it. After every word there’s a place that heard. Every time your shoe hits the avenue. And when you’ve gone they’ll sing a song. Of the stories you told when you felt so bold. You better think twice when you cross the ice. Everything you do comes back to you. When you’re shedding a tear sidewalks will hear. When your laughter’s true they’ll run with you. (chorus). (intermediate). You can do it, uh huh. (repeat 3 times). You can do it. (repeat 3 times). (chorus). Sidewalk talk. (repeat 3 times). Let me tell ya ’bout sidewalk talk. Sidewalk talk. Sidewalk talk. Sidewalk talk. (repeat). Watch out for sidewalk talk. Sidewalk talk. Sidewalk talk. Sidewalk talk. Let me tell ya ’bout. Let me tell ya ’bout. Let me tell ya ’bout. Let me tell ya ’bout sidewalk talk. by Ale Parente 11/2008"

What a joke.. Chorus:. I was not your woman, I was not your friend,. But you gave me something to remember.. No other man said love yourself. Nobody else can.. We weren't meant to be,. At least not in this lifetime,. But you gave me something to remember.. I hear you still say, ""Love yourself"".. I had all my bets laid all on you. Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose.. In the game of love I've paid my dues.. Guess I'm waiting for my place in your sun,. Wish I had the chance to know you and it wasn't stormy weather.. What a shame, who's to blame?."

But if you insist, babe, the challenge delights me.. The more you resist, babe, the more it excites me.. And no one I've kissed, babe, ever fights me again.. If you're on my list, it's just a question of when.. When I get a yen, then baby, Amen.. I'm counting to ten, and then .... I'm gonna love you like nothing you've known,.

the beast within,"Blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy. And blessed are those who hear. And who keep what is written therein. For the time is near. He is coming with the clouds. And every eye will see him. Everyone who pierced him. And all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Those of you who have not learned. What some call the deep things of Satan. I know your works. I know your toil. And your patient endurance. And how you cannot hear evil men. But have tested those who call themselves. Apostles. But are not. And found them to be false. I know you are enduring patiently. And bearing out. For my namesake. And you have not grown weary. But I have this against you. That you have abandoned. The love you had. I know your tribulation and your poverty. And the slander of those who say. That they are Jews. But they are not. They are a synagogue of Satan. Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold the devil is about to throw you into prison. Wanting. Needing. Waiting. For you. To justify my love. Hoping. Praying. For you. To justify my love. And I saw a beast rising out of the sea. With ten horns and seven heads. And a blasphemous name upon its head. And the beast that I saw was like a leopard. Its feet were like a bear's. And its mouth was like a lion's mouth. And to it the dragon gave his power. And his throne. And great authority. One of his heads had a mortal wound. But it seemed to have a mortal wound. That was healed. And the whole earth followed the beast with wonder. Men worshipped the dragon. For he had given his authority to the beast. And they worshipped the beast saying. ""Who is like the beast and who can fight against the beast?"". And the beast was given a mouth. Uttering haughty and blasphemous words. And it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months. It opened its mouth to utter blasphemous. Words. Against. God. It was allowed to make war on the saints. And to conquer them. And authority was given it over every tribe. And a people and tongue and nation. And all who dwell on earth could worship it. In vain. If anyone has an ear let him hear. If anyone is to be taken captive, into captivity he will go. If anyone who slays with the sword, with the sword. Wanting. Needing. Waiting. For you. To justify my love. Hoping. Then. I saw a new heaven. And a new earth. And I heard a great voice from the throne saying. ""Behold the dwelling of God is with men. He will dwell with them. And they shall be his people. And God himself will be with them. People will wipe away every tear from their eyes. And death shall be no more. Neither shall there be mourning. Nor crying. Nor pain. Anymore. For these things will have passed away. To the thirsty I will give water without price. From the fountain of the water of life. He who conquers shall have this heritage. And I will be his God and he shall be my son. But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted. As for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolators. And all liars. Their lot shall be in the lake. That burns with fire and brimstone"". And he said to me. He said to me. ""Do not seal up the words of the prophecy. For the time is near. Let the evildoers still do evil. And the filthy still be filthy. And the righteous still do right. And the holy still be holy. Behold. I am coming soon. I am the alpha. And the omega. The first. And the last. The beginning. And the end"". Amen. What are you gonna do?"

the lady's got potential,"(Che:). In June of forty-three there was a military coup. Behind it was a gang called the G.O.U.. Who did not feel the need to be elected. They had themselves a party at the point of a gun. They were slightly to the right of Atilla the Hun. A bomb or two and very few objected. Yeah, just one shell and governments fall like flies, kapow, die. They stumble and fall, bye bye. Backs to the wall, aim high. We're having a ball. The tank and bullet rule as democracy dies. The lady's got potential, she was setting her sights. On making it in movies with her name in lights. The greatest social climber since Cinderella. OK, she couldn't act but she had the right friends. And we all know a career depends. On knowing the right fella to be stellar. Yeah, just one shell and governments lose their nerve, kapow, die. They stumble and fall, bye bye. Backs to the wall, aim high. We're having a ball. That's how we get the government we deserve. Now the man behind the President calling the shots. Involved so discreetly in a lot of their plots. Was Colonel Juan Peron, would be dictator. He began in the army out in Italy so. Saw Mussolini's rise from the very front row. I reckon he'd do likewise sooner or later. Yeah, just one blast and the tear gas falls like rain, kapow, die. They haven't a chance, bye bye. The terrorists advance. But one guy doesn't dirty his hands. Peron was biding time out in the slow lane. Yeah, suddenly an earthquake hit the town of San Juan, kapow, die. They stumble and fall, bye bye. Keep away from the wall. But one guy was having a ball. The tragedy, a golden chance for Peron. He organized a concert with incredible flair. In aid of all the victims, such a grand affair. Politicians, actors, stars of every flavor. It was January twenty-second, 1944. A night to remember, yeah, that's for sure. For that's the night that Peron first met Eva."
the look of love,"Should have left you standing right where you stood. Should have let you go, should have had the sense to know. Like a train you'd come, and I'd lose my place.

You were my lesson I had to learn. I was your fortress. There's nothing left to lose. There's no more heart to bruise. There's no greater power. Than the power of goodbye. Learn to say good-bye. I yearn to say goodbye. There's nothing left to try. There's no more places to hide. There's no greater power. Than the power of goodbye. There's nothing left to lose. There's no more heart to bruise. There's no greater power. Than the power of goodbye"

this used to be my playground,This used to be my playground (used to be). This used to be my childhood dream. This used to be the place I ran to. Whenever I was in need. Of a friend. Why did it have to end. And why do they always say. Don't look back. Keep your head held high. Don't ask them why. Because life is short. And before you know. You're feeling old. And your heart is breaking. Don't hold on to the past. Well that's too much to ask. (Long and movie versions only:). (chorus). Live and learn. Well the years they flew. And we never knew. We were foolish then. We would never tire. And that little fire. Is still alive in me. It will never go away. Can't say goodbye to yesterday (can't say goodbye). (chorus). No regrets. But I wish that you. Were here with me. Well then there's hope yet. I can see your face. In our secret place. You're not just a memory. Say goodbye to yesterday (the dream). Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say). This used to be my playground (used to be). This used to be our pride and joy. This used to be the place we ran to.

I wish you were standing here with me. (Movie version only:). This used to be our playground (used to be). This used to be our great escape. This used to be the place we ran to.

The best things in life are always free. Wishing you were here with me
till death do us part,"Our luck is running out of time. You're not in love with me anymore. I wish that it would change, but it won't, if you don't. Our luck is running out of time. You're not in love with me anymore. I wish that it would change, but it won't. 'Cause you don't love me no more. You need so much but not from me. Turn your back in my hour of need. Something's wrong but you pretend you don't see. I think I interrupt your life. When you laugh it cuts me just like a knife. I'm not your friend, I'm just your little wife. They never laugh, not like before. She takes the keys, he breaks the door. She cannot stay here anymore. He's not in love with her anymore. The bruises they will fade away. You hit so hard with the things you say. I will not stay to watch your hate as it grows. You're not in love with someone else. You don't even love yourself. Still I wish you'd ask me not to go. He takes a drink, she goes inside. He starts to scream, the vases fly. He wishes that she wouldn't cry. He's not in move with her anymore. He makes demands, she draws the line. He starts the fight, she starts the lie. But what is truth when something dies. He's not in love with her anymore. You're not in love with someone else. You don't even love yourself. Still I wish you'd ask me not to go. She's had enough, she says the end. But she'll come back, she knows it then. A chance to start it all again. Till death do us part."
time stood still,"Despair, regret, and tenderness. Is what I feel for you. I loved you from the very start. What else could I do. You read my mind, you made me cry. Time stood still. And now I know the reasons why. Time stood still. Chorus:. Maybe you're the next best thing to happen. All the things we might have been. A flame becomes a fading light. That burns inside my heart. And like a castle in the sand. It had to fall apart. You made me laugh, you gave me hope. It's over now. Our happiness went up in smoke. It's over now."
to have and not to hold,"To have and not to hold. So hot, yet so cold. My heart is in your hand. And yet you never stand. Close enough for me to have my way. To love but not to keep. To laugh, not to weep. Your eyes, they go right through. And yet you never do. Anything to make me want to stay. Chorus:. Like a moth to a flame. Only I am to blame. Ba ba da ba ba ba. What can I do?. Ba ba da ba ba ba. I go straight to you. Ba ba da ba ba ba. I've been told. You're to have, not to hold. To look but not to see. To kiss but never be. The object of your desire. I'm walking on a wire. And there's no one at all. To break my fall. (chorus). You're to have, not to hold. You're to have, not to hold. (chorus). You're to have, not to hold. You're to have, not to hold. You're to have, not to hold. To break my heart"

turn up the radio,When the world starts to get you down. And nothing seems to go your way. And the noise of the maddening crowd. Makes you feel like you're going to go insane.

They tried to criticize my every single move. But then I realized. I had nothing left to lose. It took me by surprise when I became the news. I was fearless like a renegade. I had a feeling that I can't explain. I didn't listen to what people said. I came, I saw, I conquered. I was constant as a northern star. I had a fire burning in my heart. I never gave up fighting in the dark. I came, I saw, I conquered. (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh). I came, I saw, I conquered. (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh). I came, I saw, I conquered.

And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind. I justified my love,. I made you say a little prayer. Had me crucified, you know. I had to take you there. I opened up my heart,.

My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez. And Qb's where I started flowin'. But I was scared. the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in. Had a baby girl by a crazy girl,. then I got married. Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce. I know how to pick 'em, don't I?. Never gave a fuck about public pressure. Or the ridicule, I'm too big to lose. Now who's the fool?. And I ain't never been happier, no lie. I'm just your humble servant, I'm Nas. If y'all burn down Ferguson, I'ma riot. My life cannot be compared to anybody. Any trappers, any rapper. Any politician, beautician, or musician. Anybody, saw many bodies. Many coffins, heads or tails. Not many options on the block I came from. And I turned to a rap messiah, spit rapid fire. And I roll right back to the block I came from. I was fearless like a renegade. I had a feeling that I can't explain. I didn't listen to what people said. I came, I saw, I conquered. I was constant as a northern star. I had a fire burning in my heart. I never gave up fighting in the dark. I came, I saw, I conquered. (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh). I came, I saw, I conquered. (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh). I came, I saw, I conquered. Madonna on the track.

Tell me before you get onto your bus. Before joining the forgotten brigade. How can one person like me, say,. Alter the time-honored way the game is played?. Tell me before you get onto your high horse. Just what you expect me to do. I don't care what the bourgeoisie say. I'm not in business for them. But to give all my descamisados. A magical moment or two. (Che and Eva:). There is evil, ever around. Fundamental system of government. Quite incidental. (Eva:). So what are my chances of honest advances?. I'd say low. Better to win by admitting my sin. Than to lose with a halo. (Che:). Tell me before I seek worthier pastures. And thereby restore self-esteem. How can you be so short-sighted. To look never further than this week or next week. To have no impossible dream?. (Eva:). Allow me to help you slink off to the sidelines. And mark your adieu with three cheers. But first tell me who'd be delighted. If I said I'd take on the world's greatest problems. From war to pollution, no hope of solution. Even if I lived for one hundred years. (Che and Eva:). There is evil, ever around. Fundamental system of government. Quite incidental. (Eva:). So go, if you're able, to somewhere unstable. And stay there. Whip up your hate in some tottering state. But not here, dear. Is that clear, dear?. Oh what I'd give for a hundred years. But the physical interferes. Every day more, O my Creator. What is the good of the strongest heart. In a body that's falling apart?."
wash all over me,"In a world that's changing. I'm a stranger in a strange land. There's a contradiction. And I'm stuck here in between. Life is a like a desert. An oasis to confuse me. So I walk this razor's edge. Will I stand or will I fall. Turned a blind eye. Tried to pretend that nothing is what it seems. Torn between the impulse to stay or running away. from all this madness. Who am I to decide what should be done?. If this is the end then let it come. Let it come, let it rain. Rain all over me. Like the tide, let it flow. Let it wash all over me. Over me, let it wash all over me. Over me, let it wash all over me. All of my illusions. Could be shattered in a second. You could thread a needle. With a teardrop from my eye. It's a cruel injustice. To be witness to the things I see. Looking for the answer. When it's right in front of me. From the tower of Babylon. Where nothing is what it seems. Gonna watch the sun going down. I'm not gonna run from all this sadness. Who am I to decide what should be done?. If this is the end then let it come. Let it come, let it rain. Let it rain, rain all over me. Like the tide, let it flow. Let it wash all over me. Over me, let it wash all over me. Over me, let it wash all over me"
what can you lose,"What can you lose?. Only the blues.. Why keep concealing everything you're feeling?. Say it to her, what can you lose?. Maybe it shows,. She's had clues, which she chose to ignore.. Maybe though she knows,. And just wants to go on as before.. As a friend, nothing more. So she closes the door.. Well, if she does. Those are the dues.. Once the words are spoken,. Something may be broken.. Still, you love her. What can you lose?. But what if she goes?. At least now, you have part of her.. What if she had to choose?. Leave it alone. Hold it all in.. Better a bone. Don't even begin.. With so much to win,. There´s too much to lose"
what it feels like for a girl,"Girls can wear jeans. And cut their hair short. Wear shirts and boots. 'Cause it's OK to be a boy. But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading. 'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading. But secretly you'd love to know what it's like. Wouldn't you. What it feels like for a girl. Silky smooth. Lips as sweet as candy, baby. Tight blue jeans. Skin that shows in patches. Strong inside but you don't know it. Good little girls they never show it. When you open up your mouth to speak. Could you be a little weak. CHORUS:. Do you know what it feels like for a girl. Do you know what it feels like in this world. For a girl. Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby. Hands that rest on jutting hips repenting. Hurt that's not supposed to show. And tears that fall when no one knows. When you're trying hard to be your best. Could you be a little less. CHORUS (2x). Strong inside but you don't know it. Good little girls they never show it. When you open up your mouth to speak. Could you be a little weak. CHORUS (2x). In this world. Do you know. Do you know. Do you know what it feels like for a girl. What it feels like in this world"
where life begins,"Warm inside, yeah. I'd like to direct your attention. To something that needs directing to. A lot of people talk about. Dining in and eating out.

Where it's warm inside. Go down where I cannot hide. Go down where all life begins. Go down that's where my love is. Now what could be better. Than a home cooked meal. How you want to eat it. Depends on how you feel. You can eat all you want. And you don't get fat. Now where else can you go. For a meal like that. It's not fair to be selfish or stingy. Every girl should experience eating out. Sometimes when I come home. From a hard day at work. I swear it's all I can think about. Everybody's talkin' 'bout. Wanting that and needing this. I'd just like to know. If you want to learn. A different kind of kiss. So won't you go down. Where it's warm inside. Go down where I cannot hide. Go down where all life begins. Go down that's where my love is. Colonel sanders says it best. ""finger lickin' good"". Let's put what you've learned to the test. Can you make a fire without using wood. Are you still hungry;. Aren't you glad we came. I'm glad you brought your raincoat. I think it's beginning to rain. Everybody's talkin' 'bout. Wanting that and needing this. I'd just like to know. If you want to learn. A different kind of kiss. So won't you go down. Where it's warm inside. Go down where I cannot hide. Go down where all life begins. Go down that's where my love is. That's where my love is. Come inside. That's where all life begins. It's warm inside"

You will not bring me shame with your words. (bridge). (chorus). Too much blinding light. Your touch, I've grown tired of your words. Words, words. A linguistic form that can meaningfully be spoken in isolation. Conversation, expression, a promise, a sigh. In short, a lie. A message from heaven, a signal from hell.
