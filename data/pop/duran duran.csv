ordinary world,"Came in from a rainy thursday. On the avenue. Thought I heard you talking softly. I turned on the lights, the tv. And the radio. Still I can't escape the ghost of you. What has happened to it all?. Crazy, some say. Where is the life that I recognize?. Gone away. But I won't cry for yesterday. There's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And as I try to make my way. To the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. Passion or coincidence. Once prompted you to say. ""pride will tear us both apart"". Well now pride's gone out the window. Cross the rooftops. Run away. Left me in the vacuum of my heart. What is happening to me?. Crazy, some say. Where is my friend when I need you most?. Gone away. But I won't cry for yesterday. There's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And as I try to make my way. To the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. Papers in the roadside. Tell of suffering and greed. Fear today, forgot tomorrow. Ooh, here besides the news. Of holy war and holy need. Ours is just a little sorrowed talk. And I don't cry for yesterday. There's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And as I try to make my way. To the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. Every one. Is my world, I will learn to survive. Any one. Is my world, I will learn to survive. Any one. Is my world. Every one. Is my world"
save a prayer,"You saw me standing by the wall. Corner of the main street. And the lights are flashing on your window sill. All alone ain't much fun. So you're looking for the thrill. And you know just what it takes and where to go. Don't say a prayer for me now. Save it 'til the morning after. No, don't say a prayer for me now. Save it 'til the morning after. Feel the breeze deep on the inside. Look you down into your well. If you can, you'll see the world in all his fire. Take a chance. Like all dreamers can't find another way. You don't have to dream it all, just live a day. Don't say a prayer for me now,. Save it 'til the morning after. No, don't say a prayer for me now. Save it 'til the morning after. Save it 'til the morning after. Save it till the morning after. Pretty looking road,. Try to hold the rising floods that fill my skin. Don't ask me why I'll keep my promise. Melt the ice. And you wanted to dance so I asked you to dance. But fear is in your soul. Some people call it a one night stand. But we can call it paradise. Don't say a prayer for me now,. Save it 'til the morning after. No, don't say a prayer for me now,. Save it 'til the morning after. Save it 'til the morning after. Save it 'til the morning after. Save it 'til the morning after.

come undone,"Mine, immaculate dream made breath and skin. I've been waiting for you. Signed, with a home tattoo. Happy birthday to you was created for you. Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams?. Can't I believe you're taking my heart to pieces?. Oh, it'll take a little time,. Might take a little crime. To come undone now. We'll try to stay blind. To the hope and fear outside. Hey child, stay wilder than the wind. And blow me in to cry. Who do you need, who do you love. When you come undone?. Who do you need, who do you love. When you come undone?. Words, playing me deja vu. Like a radio tune I swear I've heard before. Chill, is it something real. Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers. Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams. Can't I believe you're taking my heart to pieces. Lost, in a snow filled sky,. We'll make it alright. To come undone now. We'll try to stay blind. To the hope and fear outside. Hey child, stay wilder than the wind. And blow me in to cry. Who do you need, who do you love. When you come undone?. Who do you need, who do you love. When you come undone?"

mediterranea,"Across the sky a jet trail following. The wish that I was on that plane. On my way to some far destination. Undiscovered never mentioned. Sipping on the high of expectation. I awaken to the shade. Maybe it's a rained out town. One you wanna leave behind. When the winter's on the ground. If you ever wonder. We believe in the cold. Gray light we dream. There's a place for us. Mediterranea. Yes, we believe where. The white sands touch the sea. There's a space for us. Mediterranea. I'm trading air for touch down ecstasy. Arriving there in a wave of heat. Nine a. m. , the beach tequila mayhem. Sum of all suburban daydreams. Waiting for a look, the invitation. I awaken to the shade. Maybe it's a rained out town. One you wanna leave behind. When the winter's on the ground. If you ever wonder. We believe in the cold. Gray light we dream. There's a place for us. Mediterranea. Yes, we believe where. The white sands touch the sea. There's a space for us. Mediterranea. Oh imagine, summer fashion. See yourself in a no hope town. Let the sunshine out of your mind. A bed of light to lay you down. We believe in the cold. Gray light we dream. There's a place for us. Mediterranea. Yes, we believe where. The white sands touch the sea. There's a space for us. Mediterranea. And we believe.

before the rain,"A stormy summer is rolling closer. Lighting up this holy smoker. And if this drinking could ease the thinking. I toast to my home truth with this glass. All rise, you promises broken. Call my lovers by their names. Lost hearts and words that are spoken to the wind which blows before the rain. Little pin-pricks, and how my ears bleed. On the bomb ticks that is my heartbeat. In every life-flash, in every car crash. I hear the silence waiting to fall. (Chorus). For all I carry, are murdered secrets. The price of my blue star-eyed weakness. And so we travel, and we unravel. Towards the place where all loose ends go. (Chorus)"
being followed,To the voyeur. Sitting in a darkened room. Do you thrill. When the green light starts pulsing. Paranoia. The only valid point of view. If you know. What I'm saying. I'm not alone. Being followed. Someone always watching what we do. Never alone. But I'm in the shadows. I dream things I don't want you to know. Something shifting. Between the sirens and the glow. Of red lights. And the blue slowly turning. The fog is lifting. A silhouette begins to show. And the moment is stolen. I'm not alone. Being followed. Someone always watching what we do. Never alone. But I'm in the shadows. I dream things I don't want you to know. In this chamber. Lit by scandal. You're the bullet. In the barrel. You're the last thing. As I'm falling. Bloody roaring. Still I'm calling out. I'm calling out. I'm not alone. Being followed. Never alone. I'm being followed. I'm not alone. Being followed. Never alone. I'm being followed. La la la la la la la

careless memories,"So soon just after you've gone. My senses sharpen. But it always takes so damn long. Before I feel how much my eyes have darkened. Fear hangs in a plane of gunsmoke. Drifting in our room. So easy to disturb. With a thought, with a whisper. With a careless memory, with a careless memory. On the table, signs of love lies scattered. And the walls break, with a crashing within. It's not as though you really mattered to me. But being close, how could I let you go. Without some feeling. Some precious sympathy following. Fear hangs in a plane of gunsmoke. Drifting in our room. So easy to disturb. With a thought with a whisper. With a careless memory, with a careless memory. I walk out into the sun, try to find a new day. But the whole place just screams in my eyes. Where are you now 'cause I don't want to meet you. I think I'd die, I think I'd laugh at you. I know I'd cry. What am I supposed to do follow you. Outside the thoughts coming flooding back now. I just try to forget you. So easy to disturb. With a thought with a whisper. With a careless memory, with a careless memory. With a careless memory, look out. Look out. Look out. Look out"

crystal ship,"(The Doors). Before you slip into unconsciousness. I'd like to have another kiss. Another flashing chance at bliss. Another kiss, another kiss. The days are bright and filled with pain. Enclose me in your gentle rain. The time you ran was too, insane. We'll meet again, we'll meet again. So tell me where your freedom lies. The streets are fields that never die. Deliver me from reasons why -. You'd rather cry,. I'd rather fly. The crystal ship is being filled. A thousand girls, a thousand thrills. A million ways to spend your time -. When we get back, I'll drop a line."

diamond dogs,"(Bowie). . As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent. You asked for the latest party. With your silicone hump and your ten inchy stump. Dressed like a priest you was,. Todd Browning beast you was. Crawling down the alley on your hands and knees,. I'm sure you're not protected. For its plain to see. The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees. Hunt you to the ground they will. Mannequins with kill-appeal. Will they come?. I keep a friend serene. Will they come?. Oh, baby, come unto me. Will they come?. Well, she's come, been, and gone. Come out of the garden, baby. You'll catch a death in the fog. Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs. Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs. Now halloween jack is a real cool cat,. And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase. The elevators broke so he slides down a rope. Onto the street below. Oh tarzie go man, go. Meets his little hussy with his ghost-town approach. Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch. Sweetly reminiscent something mother used to bake. Wrecked up and paralyzed. Diamond Dogs are sable-ized. Will they come?. I keep a friend serene. Will they come?. Oh, baby, come unto me. Will they come?. Well, she's come, been, and gone. (chorus). In the year of the scavenger The season of the bitch. Sashay on the board-walk scurry to the ditch. Just another future song lonely little kitch. There's gonna be sorrow try and wake up tomorrow. Will they come?. I keep a friend serene. Will they come?. Oh, baby, come unto me. Will they come?. Well, she's come, been, and gone. (chorus)."

From other cars. His eyes started to slip. This is the story of his dream. Silver.... (Sing Blue Silver, Sing Sing Blue Silver). This is the story of his dream....."

Like the straw he is clutching. Why has the sky turned grey. Hard to my face and cold on my shoulder. And why has my life gone astray. Scarred by disgrace, I know that it's over. Because I'm falling down. With people standing round. But before I hit the ground. Is there time. Could I find someone out there to help me?. Howl at the wind rushing. Past my lonely head. Caught inside it's own motion. How I wish it was somebody else instead. Howling at all this corrosion. Why did the luck run dry. Laugh in my face, so pleased to desert me. Why do the cruel barbs fly?. Now when disgrace can no longer hurt me. Because I'm falling down. With people standing round. But before I hit the ground. Is there time. Could I find someone out there to help me?. Because I'm falling down. With people standing round. But before I hit the ground. Is there time. Could I find someone out there to help me?.

god,"God created the world,. Then created the Devil to blame for his mistakes. . I closed the door of my hotel room behind me,. It was like closing a chapter in the book of life.. Outside thirty floors below I could hear the police. Using their sirens like wolf whistles to pick up young girls.. . On TV Oliver North (his fifteen minutes of fame ticking steadily away). Was being fuzzy about crucial events which had happened a year earlier. What a flake...but then who isn't?. That was Regan's defence at least.. . The worst thing is how politics begin to lead into your life.. Back in our innocence we used to simply stick two fingers up to. politics,. Say ""fuck the Queen"", that was about all you had to say anyway,. And go back to the more important business of making music.. . So why was I sitting there feeling angry about -. Covert operations and illegal aid to the contras?. I mean I'm not even American (may be we all are a little bit).. Then I realised it was just the idea that in this particular democracy. And probably every other one in the world, there is somebody in power. Who thinks he is more right than all the people who put him there,. All the people who for once in their lives took an interest.. . Outside the wind was howling the ""Who Who's"" from Sympathy for the Devil. Round and round the concrete hotel walls and corners.. That was then, this is...!."

grey lady of the sea,"(LeBon). You've whispered out loud. But your breeze doesn't bend. We're lying in the palm of your hand. No land we see, no place to be. The salt of your tears, adds stain to our hearts. There's no long years can tear us apart. Our futures entwined with your past. Because when we lie awake. We'll be thinking of you. Blow, Grey Lady blow your ships back home. Blow, Grey Lady blow your ships back home. Bravado is all but gone. And patience is down. You scared us and you've turned us around. But you won't let us drown. Because when we lie asleep. We'll be dreaming of you. Blow, Grey Lady blow your ships back home. Blow, Grey Lady blow your ships back home. So answer us when we call. And say if you think we're old. When life is so short we can stay long. But you'll never be alone. Because one day we'll return. We'll be waiting for you. Blow, Grey Lady blow your ships back home. Blow, Grey Lady blow your ships back home. Blow, Grey Lady blow your ships back home. Blow, Grey Lady blow your ships back home. Blow, Grey Lady blow your ships back home."

I've had my last chance on the stairway. Wonder why. Wonder why...what makes me rise so high. Maybe it's something they put in your perfume. Or the look in your eyes. It could be the atmosphere sinking. I don't even know what you're thinking. Don't even know what you're drinking. But it keeps this heaven alive. And sometimes I'm caught in a landslide.

last man standing,Now an unexpected peace comes to the day. As the howling dimmed the fighting dies away. When the hanging dust is clearing from the air. You can just make out a lonely figure there. He's the last man standing on the track. He does not look down. He does not look back. He's the last man standing on the track. You can't hold him down. You can't hold him back. He's the last man standing on the track. He does not look down. He does not look back. He's the last man standing on the track. You can't hold him down. You can't hold him back. He's sorry for the wrong he has done. And he cries out for the anger for so long. All the cuts and bruises suffered. In whose name. Oh but now is not the time to face his shame. He's the last man standing on the track. He does not look down. He does not look back. He's the last man standing on the track. You can't hold him down. You can't hold him back. The last man standing on the track. He does not look down. He does not look back. He's the last man standing on the track. You can't hold him down. You can't hold him back. He's the last man standing. Last man standing. He's the last man standing

late bar,"There's a hole in the wall next to you. Things with legs are crawling through. Their madly searching for the door in your room. You're coming out, your coming down. There's an all night party in room 7609. (La-la-la late bar la la la la la la la late). You can dance together all night, if you've got the time. (La-la-la late bar la la la la la la la late). .

The body of Venus, a babe rainbow. And if I come any closer I might fall into your silhouette. But the shape of things to come is constantly changing. So let it, so let it, so let it flow. La la la la lava lamp. La la la la lava lamp. Indigo, violet and blue. Can we meet where the edges blur?. Because I am coming at you. Like a bug eye heading for the burn. Truth is I can't stay away. No, I wanna let you light my volcano. And maybe it's just in my imagination. But you never know. Because the shape of things to come is constantly changing. So let it, so let it, so let it flow.

lonely in your nightmare,"Even on the darkest night. When empty promise means empty hand. And soldiers coming home. Like shadows turning red. When the lights of hope are fading quickly. Then look to me. I'll be your homing angel. I'll be in your head. Because you're lonely in your nightmare. Let me in. And there's heat beneath your winter. Let me in. I see the delta traces living lonely out on the limb. And a passing glimmer warm beneath your skin. Please tread gently on the ground. When all around you earth turns to fire. Only get a second chance when danger's on the wind. Because you're lonely in your nightmare. Let me in. Because there's heat beneath your winter. Let me in. And it's silent on your stone field. Let me in. Must be lucky weather when you find. The kind of wind that you need. C'mon, show me all the light and shade. That made your name. I know you've got it in your head. I've seen that look before. You've built your refuge. Turns you captive all the same. Because you're lonely in your nightmare. Let me in. And it's barren in your garden. Let me in. Because there's heat beneath your winter. Let me in. Because it's silent in your stone field. Let me in. And you're lonely in your nightmare. Let me in. Because you've waited through your ice age. Let me in. Because you're so lonely in your nightmare. Let me in. And it's cold out on your stone range. Let me in. Because there's heat beneath your winter. Let me in"

medazzaland,"oh, Medazzaland. Medazzaland. I had a problem they said they can solve. Soon I won't speak. I have no words left in me. I dream in pictures but the sound is muted. I have no way to understand what they say. Into Medazzaland. People are starting to talk. But I don't hear them anymore. Now I can't see. But I'm still able to think. Do I have any feeling left?. What are they saying about me?. Do they really understand what's wrong?. I feel their hands on my skin. The time has come for them to begin. I'm sinking deeper and deeper. Into Medazzaland. I can feel the scalpel on my skin. It's cutting in deeper and deeper. I'm in Medazzaland. Oh Medazzaland."
mediterranea,"Across the sky a jet trail following. The wish that I was on that plane. On my way to some far destination. Undiscovered never mentioned. Sipping on the high of expectation. I awaken to the shade. Maybe it's a rained out town. One you wanna leave behind. When the winter's on the ground. If you ever wonder. We believe in the cold. Gray light we dream. There's a place for us. Mediterranea. Yes, we believe where. The white sands touch the sea. There's a space for us. Mediterranea. I'm trading air for touch down ecstasy. Arriving there in a wave of heat. Nine a. m. , the beach tequila mayhem. Sum of all suburban daydreams. Waiting for a look, the invitation. I awaken to the shade. Maybe it's a rained out town. One you wanna leave behind. When the winter's on the ground. If you ever wonder. We believe in the cold. Gray light we dream. There's a place for us. Mediterranea. Yes, we believe where. The white sands touch the sea. There's a space for us. Mediterranea. Oh imagine, summer fashion. See yourself in a no hope town. Let the sunshine out of your mind. A bed of light to lay you down. We believe in the cold. Gray light we dream. There's a place for us. Mediterranea. Yes, we believe where. The white sands touch the sea. There's a space for us. Mediterranea. And we believe. Yes, we believe. There's a place for us. Mediterranea"

new moon on monday,Shake up the picture. The lizard mixture. With your dance on the eventide. You got me coming up with answers. All of which I deny. I said it again. Could I please rephrase it?. Maybe I can catch a ride. I couldn't really put it much plainer. But I'll wait till you decide. Send me your warning siren. As if I could ever hide. Last time la luna. I light my torch. And wave it for the new moon on Monday. And a fire dance. Through the night. I stayed the cold day. With a lonely satellite. Breaking away. With the beast of both worlds. A smile that you can't disguise. Every minute I keep finding. Clues that you leave behind. Send me from these reminders. As if I'd forget tonight. This time la luna

night boat,"(Taylor, Taylor, Taylor, Rhodes, Le Bon). Standing on the edge of the quay. No light flashes on the water for me. Fog in my mind darkens in my eyes. Silently screaming for a distant sound. Ripple river yellows. Rising for a breath of breeding and drowns. Stillness overcomes me in the night. Listen to the rising water moan. I'm waiting, waiting for the nightboat. I'm waiting, waiting for the nightboat. Shadows all through me shudder away. Echo me, echo me. Am I alone or is the river alive. 'cause it echoes me, echoes me, echoes me. I'm waiting, waiting for the nightboat. I'm waiting, waiting for the nightboat. Waiting for the nightboat. I'm waiting. I'm waiting, waiting for the nightboat. I'm waiting for the nightboat."

runway runaway,"At the door, blowing a kiss. She's careful not to wake her sister. Knowing that she will be missed. It feels a little bad, girl. On the corner, engine runnin'. Taxi driver sees her comin'. Chilly in the morning sun. She seems a little sad. Say goodbye. She's not afraid of leaving. No one by her side. Nothing to hang on. Wave goodbye to everything familiar. There's a world to find. Runway, runaway. Just run away. Looking back, she sees the pattern. Hidden princess in the attic. Realize this picture. That is more than she will hope for. Happy when her heart is jumping. Desperately seeking something. Trying to be strong enough. To choose another road. Runway, runaway, just runaway. Runway, runaway, runaway. Runway, runaway, just runaway. Runway, runaway"

salt in the rainbow,"Something to remember. In some far off time. When you get that lonely. Shine in your eyes. Trees and lovers. Ever wonder why. When everything starts breaking down. They're reaching for the sky. You are forever. All I understand. I hope forever. Here within my hands. Picking through the pieces. And what do you have at all?. Just the danger of relying on. Those who'd let you fall. So you try, try much harder. Until the truth is drawn. The very thing you've been searching for. Has been yours all along. We are forever. All we understand. This is forever. Here within our hands. We are forever. All we understand. This is forever. Here within our hands. In the end to you my friend. It's you I got to know. Ain't no going back now. Even if I could. I wouldn't change a think. I'd do it all over. Just a minute now and breath a little deeper. All these moments of our lives. At a flickering of an endless sea. We are ripples with a salt in the rainbow. We are forever. All we understand. This is forever. Here within our hands. We are forever. All we understand. (Fade...)"

Know my weakness call it deja-vu. Never put my trust in fate suprises do arrive so late. Why should I be suprised by you. Straight to the heart straight for this precious shining. How do you dare, step into my flame. One from the heart, one for this precious shining. How can you steal my flame. . Sometimes cards are drawn, and the tables turn. The waiting game is over. Take this dealers hand and steal away the dawn. Don't ever give me any chance to wander back from this innocence. Don't give me any chances at all. (chorus). (chorus). My Flame!. My Flame!. My Flame!."

Who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance.. Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay. It only took my little fingers to blow you away.

And your telephone been ringing while you're dancing in the rain. Wild boys wonder where is glory. Where is all you angels now the figureheads have fell. And lovers' war with arrows over secrets they could tell. They tried to tame you, looks like they'll try again. Wild boys never lose it. Wild boys never chose this way.

Fear today, forgot tomorrow. Ooh, here besides the news. Of holy war and holy need. Ours is just a little sorrowed talk. And I don't cry for yesterday. There's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And as I try to make my way. To the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. Every one. Is my world, I will learn to survive. Any one. Is my world, I will learn to survive.

the chauffeur,"Out on the tar plains. the glides are moving. All looking for a new place to drive. You sit beside me. so newly charming. Sweating dew drops glisten. freshing your side. The sun slips down. bedding heavy behind. The front of your dress all shadowy lined. And the droning engine throbs in time. With your beating heart. Way down the lane away, living for another day.

mediterranea,"Across the sky a jet trail following. The wish that I was on that plane. On my way to some far destination. Undiscovered never mentioned. Sipping on the high of expectation. I awaken to the shade. Maybe it's a rained out town. One you wanna leave behind. When the winter's on the ground. If you ever wonder. We believe in the cold. Gray light we dream. There's a place for us. Mediterranea. Yes, we believe where. The white sands touch the sea. There's a space for us. Mediterranea. I'm trading air for touch down ecstasy. Arriving there in a wave of heat. Nine a. m. , the beach tequila mayhem. Sum of all suburban daydreams. Waiting for a look, the invitation. I awaken to the shade. Maybe it's a rained out town.

The white sands touch the sea. There's a space for us. Mediterranea. Oh imagine, summer fashion. See yourself in a no hope town. Let the sunshine out of your mind. A bed of light to lay you down. We believe in the cold. Gray light we dream. There's a place for us. Mediterranea. Yes, we believe where. The white sands touch the sea. There's a space for us. Mediterranea. And we believe.

Reckless and so hungered on the razor's edge you trail. Because there's murder by the roadside in a sore afraid new world. They tried to break us, looks like they'll try again.

And lovers' war with arrows over secrets they could tell. They tried to tame you, looks like they'll try again. Wild boys never lose it. Wild boys never chose this way. Wild boys never close your eyes. Wild boys always shine"

a matter of feeling,How does it feel. When everyone surrounds you?. How do you deal. Do crowds just make you feel lonely?. What do you say?. When people come and try to pin you down?. Aquaintainces smile. But that's no understanding. How after a while. You keep falling off the same mountain. Try to explain it. But nothing really gets them that high. Steal away in the morning. Love's already history to you. It's a habit you're forming. This body's desperate for something new. Just a matter of feeling. This moment's madness is sure to pass. And tears will dry as you're leaving. Who knows you might find something to last. Emotion's a game. Saved up for a rainy Monday. But you laught just the same. 'Cause it's been pouring on Sunday. Call up your numbers. And never let the zeros bring you down. How does it feel?. Is time too heavy to hold?. Whatever you decide. For the moment is holy. Whenever you slow down. To see life is passing by. Steal away in the morning. Love's alredy history to you. It's a habit you're forming. This body's desperate for something new. Just a matter of feeling. This moment's madness is sure to past. And tears will dry as your're leaving. Who knows you might find something to last. You can steal away in the morning. Love's already history to you.

Dance in the the fire to fatal sounds of broken dreams. Dance in to the fire that fatal kiss is all we need. Dance into the fire. Choice for you is the view to a kill. Between the shades assassination standing still. First crystal tears fall of snowflakes on your body. First time in years to drench your skin with lovers rosy stain. A chance to find a phoenix for the flame. A chance to die but can we. Dance into the fire that fatal kiss is all we need. Dance into the fire to fatal sounds of broken dreams. Dance into the fire that fatal kiss is all we need. Dance into the fire. when all we see is the view to a kill

beautiful colours,"Today, riding the slow train along the way. going to who knows where and who knows when. not knowing where you're rolling - it's the learning of this journey.

Clouds of beautiful colours, indifferent to what you believe. Sometimes the beauty of it all seems unbearable 'til the colours bleed. (keep breathing...).

before the rain,"A stormy summer is rolling closer. Lighting up this holy smoker. And if this drinking could ease the thinking. I toast to my home truth with this glass. All rise, you promises broken. Call my lovers by their names. Lost hearts and words that are spoken to the wind which blows before the rain. Little pin-pricks, and how my ears bleed. On the bomb ticks that is my heartbeat. In every life-flash, in every car crash. I hear the silence waiting to fall. (Chorus). For all I carry, are murdered secrets. The price of my blue star-eyed weakness. And so we travel, and we unravel. Towards the place where all loose ends go. (Chorus)"
being followed,To the voyeur. Sitting in a darkened room. Do you thrill. When the green light starts pulsing. Paranoia. The only valid point of view. If you know. What I'm saying. I'm not alone. Being followed. Someone always watching what we do. Never alone. But I'm in the shadows. I dream things I don't want you to know. Something shifting. Between the sirens and the glow. Of red lights. And the blue slowly turning. The fog is lifting. A silhouette begins to show. And the moment is stolen. I'm not alone. Being followed. Someone always watching what we do. Never alone. But I'm in the shadows. I dream things I don't want you to know. In this chamber. Lit by scandal. You're the bullet. In the barrel. You're the last thing. As I'm falling. Bloody roaring. Still I'm calling out. I'm calling out. I'm not alone. Being followed. Never alone. I'm being followed. I'm not alone. Being followed. Never alone. I'm being followed. La la la la la la la

butterfly girl,By the look on your face. You've been awake all night. It started raining in the early light. You're fooling the mirror. But you don't fool me. A drift in your own sympathy.

You can make it through tomorrow. Set free your butterfly girl. And when you rise above the sorrow. You be a butterfly girl. Now you're drunk in the dream of your life as dirt.

careless memories,"So soon just after you've gone. My senses sharpen. But it always takes so damn long. Before I feel how much my eyes have darkened. Fear hangs in a plane of gunsmoke. Drifting in our room. So easy to disturb. With a thought, with a whisper. With a careless memory, with a careless memory. On the table, signs of love lies scattered. And the walls break, with a crashing within. It's not as though you really mattered to me. But being close, how could I let you go. Without some feeling. Some precious sympathy following. Fear hangs in a plane of gunsmoke. Drifting in our room. So easy to disturb. With a thought with a whisper. With a careless memory, with a careless memory. I walk out into the sun, try to find a new day. But the whole place just screams in my eyes. Where are you now 'cause I don't want to meet you. I think I'd die, I think I'd laugh at you. I know I'd cry. What am I supposed to do follow you. Outside the thoughts coming flooding back now. I just try to forget you. So easy to disturb. With a thought with a whisper. With a careless memory, with a careless memory. With a careless memory, look out. Look out. Look out. Look out"

Are whispering to me. But I don't know these others. Who want to set me free. Come home you're out of time. But the life cannot let go. It's a chain cuts across my soul. Anchoring in this world. I put my hand into the flame. Burning but I feel no pain. Don't speak, don't speak my name. Hold on to this life of chains. The door is standing open. But I'm too tired to be afraid. My whole life's in this moment. I've been fighting all the way. Just need a little more time. Cuz the life just can't let go. It's a chain cuts across my soul. Anchoring in this world. I put my hand into the flame. Burning but I feel no pain. Don't speak, don't speak my name. Hold on to this life of chains. Nah nah nah nah nah. I put my hand into the flame.

Back to La Brea.. And she met under Los Angeles sunshine. Young man was sitting at the wheel. On his way to make a pickup. Turned off the air-con. Rolled down the window. And began to sweat. Out over the Hollywood hills. He saw the clouds building. Like great dark towers of rain. Ready to come tumbling down. Any day now. Not a day too soon. (Any day now). And as the music drifted in. From other cars. His eyes started to slip. This is the story of his dream. Silver.... (Sing Blue Silver, Sing Sing Blue Silver). This is the story of his dream....."
drowning man,"(Duran Duran). He's sinking faster than a drowning man. He'll grab a hold of anyone he can. Gun in his poket and a heart of ham. Uncle Sam.... He's dying faster than a rabid dog. Infect us all now he's losing blood. Nose for trouble and a soul of rock. Smokey's man.... Don't drag me down. I don't wanna drown. Your going down. (Hay) NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA. . There's not much flesh. Just skin and bone. Cheeks sunk deep. Eyes popping wide. Don't put out a hand to help him. This drowning man will bite it right off. Right off , Right off , Right off... (chorus). He's selling faster than a magazine. Infect us all with his TV screen. He's selling faster than a magazine. Infect us all with his TV screen. He's selling faster than a magazine. Infect us all with his TV screen. He's selling faster than a magazine. Infect us all with his TV screen. (chorus) (chorus)."

She's moody and grey, she's mean and she's restless. (so restless, so restless indeed). All over you as they say,. Rumours or rivals yell at the strike force -.

falling angel,"(Duran Duran). From this cloud where I hang, dangled in the blue. I spy you all tiny creatures on the ground below. For my being reckless got me strung up in the sky.

falling down (feat. justin timberlake),"Once was a man. Who consumed his place and time. He thought nothing could touch him. But here and now it's a different storyline. Like the straw he is clutching. Why has the sky turned grey. Hard to my face and cold on my shoulder. And why has my life gone astray. Scarred by disgrace, I know that it's over. Because I'm falling down. With people standing round. But before I hit the ground. Is there time. Could I find someone out there to help me?. Howl at the wind rushing. Past my lonely head. Caught inside it's own motion. How I wish it was somebody else instead. Howling at all this corrosion. Why did the luck run dry. Laugh in my face, so pleased to desert me. Why do the cruel barbs fly?. Now when disgrace can no longer hurt me. Because I'm falling down. With people standing round. But before I hit the ground. Is there time. Could I find someone out there to help me?. Because I'm falling down. With people standing round. But before I hit the ground. Is there time. Could I find someone out there to help me?.

So nervous to say, tell me, can't you see. If you want, I fall out forever. I can't say no more...bebe dance with me. And please don't say leave it till later. I've had my last chance on the stairway. Wonder why. Wonder why...what makes me rise so high. Maybe it's something they put in your perfume. Or the look in your eyes. It could be the atmosphere sinking. I don't even know what you're thinking. Don't even know what you're drinking. But it keeps this heaven alive. And sometimes I'm caught in a landslide. My beats so in time, can you look at me. I'm out of reach, I'll talk if it feels right. So nervous to say, tell me, can't you see. If you want, I fall out forever. I can't say no more...bebe dance with me. And please don't say leave it till later. I've had my last chance on the stairway."

lonely in your nightmare,"Even on the darkest night. When empty promise means empty hand. And soldiers coming home. Like shadows turning red. When the lights of hope are fading quickly. Then look to me. I'll be your homing angel. I'll be in your head. Because you're lonely in your nightmare. Let me in. And there's heat beneath your winter. Let me in.

Only get a second chance when danger's on the wind. Because you're lonely in your nightmare. Let me in. Because there's heat beneath your winter. Let me in. And it's silent on your stone field. Let me in. Must be lucky weather when you find. The kind of wind that you need. C'mon, show me all the light and shade. That made your name. I know you've got it in your head. I've seen that look before. You've built your refuge. Turns you captive all the same. Because you're lonely in your nightmare. Let me in. And it's barren in your garden. Let me in. Because there's heat beneath your winter. Let me in. Because it's silent in your stone field. Let me in. And you're lonely in your nightmare. Let me in. Because you've waited through your ice age. Let me in. Because you're so lonely in your nightmare. Let me in. And it's cold out on your stone range. Let me in. Because there's heat beneath your winter. Let me in"
lonely tonight,"Lonely tonight, lonely tonight, lonely tonight, lonely tonight. Lonely tonight, lonely tonight, lonely tonight, lonely tonight. We're enchanted, struck by lightning.

love voodoo,"When I first met you on the roof,. You cought me in your web of youth,. But now I know the wicked truth,. It's much to late so what's the use in fighting?.

medazzaland,"oh, Medazzaland. Medazzaland. I had a problem they said they can solve. Soon I won't speak. I have no words left in me. I dream in pictures but the sound is muted. I have no way to understand what they say. Into Medazzaland. People are starting to talk. But I don't hear them anymore. Now I can't see. But I'm still able to think. Do I have any feeling left?. What are they saying about me?. Do they really understand what's wrong?. I feel their hands on my skin. The time has come for them to begin. I'm sinking deeper and deeper. Into Medazzaland. I can feel the scalpel on my skin. It's cutting in deeper and deeper. I'm in Medazzaland. Oh Medazzaland."
mediterranea,"Across the sky a jet trail following. The wish that I was on that plane. On my way to some far destination. Undiscovered never mentioned. Sipping on the high of expectation. I awaken to the shade. Maybe it's a rained out town. One you wanna leave behind. When the winter's on the ground. If you ever wonder. We believe in the cold. Gray light we dream. There's a place for us. Mediterranea. Yes, we believe where. The white sands touch the sea. There's a space for us. Mediterranea. I'm trading air for touch down ecstasy. Arriving there in a wave of heat. Nine a. m. , the beach tequila mayhem. Sum of all suburban daydreams. Waiting for a look, the invitation. I awaken to the shade. Maybe it's a rained out town. One you wanna leave behind. When the winter's on the ground. If you ever wonder. We believe in the cold. Gray light we dream. There's a place for us. Mediterranea. Yes, we believe where. The white sands touch the sea. There's a space for us. Mediterranea. Oh imagine, summer fashion. See yourself in a no hope town. Let the sunshine out of your mind. A bed of light to lay you down. We believe in the cold. Gray light we dream. There's a place for us. Mediterranea. Yes, we believe where. The white sands touch the sea. There's a space for us. Mediterranea. And we believe. Yes, we believe. There's a place for us. Mediterranea"

midnight sun,"as i watch you flickering slowly. in the shadows nothing to hold. it's as if i don't recall our time before. and would it be so wrong. not to remember. there are times i look at you differently. like i've never seen you before. funny, after all we've done. you could be someone i don't know at all. i don't know you at all. catch me, i don't want to fall. but you pull the mountain from under me. look, i'm dangling up in the blue. and it's a cartoon kind of eternity. before i drop down to you. what am i supposed to do now. there is something beautiful shining. in the hollow knot of your head. funny, for a while it seemed to come from the sky. but it's in your head. yes it fills your head. you and i don't always fly. let me down, i want to fall. deep into the dark. but i'll come back to you. and i'll always know how to find you.

How can you touch me, when you're not really there?. Stumbling out I made my way towards the open door... Climbing fast the sun broad streaming laughter down into your empty gaze. Where can I find you. Now I want to join in your games. I hear you calling. I hear you ... calling, calling, calling, calling.... Whispering your love song in my ear. How can you touch me?. How do you really dare?. Ohh oooh"

new moon on monday,Shake up the picture. The lizard mixture. With your dance on the eventide. You got me coming up with answers. All of which I deny. I said it again. Could I please rephrase it?. Maybe I can catch a ride. I couldn't really put it much plainer. But I'll wait till you decide. Send me your warning siren. As if I could ever hide. Last time la luna. I light my torch. And wave it for the new moon on Monday. And a fire dance. Through the night. I stayed the cold day. With a lonely satellite. Breaking away. With the beast of both worlds. A smile that you can't disguise. Every minute I keep finding. Clues that you leave behind. Send me from these reminders. As if I'd forget tonight. This time la luna
new religion,"I've been now sauntering. Out and down the path sometime. Come on, it takes me nowhere, which I knew. Faces everywhere pulling grins and signs in things.

Too many things, too much to know. Bring my timing in, seagulls gather on the wind. Lady screaming, lady leave me out. 'Cause sometimes people stare. Coming down, electric chair.

ordinary world,"Came in from a rainy thursday. On the avenue. Thought I heard you talking softly. I turned on the lights, the tv. And the radio. Still I can't escape the ghost of you. What has happened to it all?. Crazy, some say. Where is the life that I recognize?. Gone away. But I won't cry for yesterday. There's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And as I try to make my way. To the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. Passion or coincidence. Once prompted you to say. ""pride will tear us both apart"". Well now pride's gone out the window. Cross the rooftops. Run away. Left me in the vacuum of my heart. What is happening to me?. Crazy, some say. Where is my friend when I need you most?. Gone away. But I won't cry for yesterday. There's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And as I try to make my way. To the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. Papers in the roadside. Tell of suffering and greed. Fear today, forgot tomorrow. Ooh, here besides the news. Of holy war and holy need. Ours is just a little sorrowed talk. And I don't cry for yesterday. There's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And as I try to make my way. To the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. Every one. Is my world, I will learn to survive. Any one. Is my world, I will learn to survive. Any one. Is my world. Every one. Is my world"
other peoples lives,"Selling exes down the river. Every Katie's got her price. And the details make you shiver. But it's hard to escape. When your head is stuck in vice. Because nothing matters. In the self obsessive age. Where they dare you not to notice. But it's everywhere. In shocking color on the page. In the magazine. Staring out at me. Out of my TV. Other people's lives. Pixelated lives. Just like yours and mine. Every weekend I bear witness. To the social suicides. To the thief who stays for breakfast. To the poster child. Screwing everybody's wife. Yeah, it's just a story. But it keeps me hanging on. For the needy soul. The glory hole confessional. I got to see what's going down. In the magazine. Staring out at me. Out of my TV. Other people's lives. Pixelated lives. Just like yours and mine. Read the headlines. Hear the sirens. I'm re-united. Out of rehab again. But it's everywhere. In shocking color on the page.

out of my mind,"(LeBon, Rhodes, Cuccurullo). Light a candle, lay flowers at the door. For those who're left behind and the ones who've gone before. Here it comes now, sure as silence follows rain,.

But now I feel your presence in a way I could not know. And I wonder, do you ever feel the same?. In whispering darkness, do you ever here my name?. . (chorus). (Here in the back of your mind).

How do you dare, step into my flame. One from the heart, one for this precious shining. How can you steal my flame. . Sometimes cards are drawn, and the tables turn. The waiting game is over. Take this dealers hand and steal away the dawn. Don't ever give me any chance to wander back from this innocence. Don't give me any chances at all. (chorus). (chorus). My Flame!. My Flame!.

Don't spill my secret. You were once running wild, hiding in the morning mist. Game demands I make you mine. I thought that I could resist. but the leopard in you silently preyed on me. Deserted by my friends (Don't they understand?). She's so much more than them (How could they compare?). So now she's just for me (No one else can see). I watch her while she sleeps (Be sure she dreams of you). Don't spill my secret. (It's been quite a while) Since we were last outside. (And do you miss the chase?). Now that we've both been tamed. (Inside this gilded cage) Prisoners of our thoughts. (You saved me from myself) Don't spill my secret"

the promise,Those tears on a gaping voice. Who's stretching arms match the hunger of mine. There lips will they never join. But always draw me closer and further entwined. With a promise dealer understand all freedoms fade away. To a point of view where many different pathways meet. And we're standing on this precipice with nothing much to save. But the deep blue screams of falling dreams with our next move. Heaven hide your eyes (heaven hide your eyes). Heaven's eyes will never dry (heaven's eyes will never dry). . The shades of a thousand steel. Come flashing by my face in the fury of war. In desolation and abandoned fields. The hungry make their stand when they'll stand for no more. Hear the passion in their voices see the heaven in their eyes. Their hopes and schemes are waiting dreams of less than paradise. And sometimes we make promises we never mean to keep. For blackmail is the only deal a promise dealer sees. . (chorus) (chorus). (chorus) (chorus) (chorus).

the seventh stranger,"Those words are all remainders. Echos growing in the heart of twilight. They lay back laughing at naivety's star.. Awaken all those whispers,. The dusty shadow of a passing favour. I wouldn't say that you were ruthless or right. I couldn't see from so far.. Was I chasing after rainbows?. One thing for sure - you never answered when I called.. And I wiped away the water from my face. To look through the eyes of a stranger.... For rumours in the wake of such a lonely crowd. Trading in my shelter for danger. I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down -. In the eyes of the stranger!. Can't tell the real from reflections. When all these faces look the same to me.

Can you entertain us?. Can you give a little more?. (chorus). We are undergoing treatment. Will the doctors ever cure. These delusions of grandeur?.

who do you think you are?,I'm giving you the news. Your domination's through. You gave the best you've got. Now I'm out on top. If you're in any doubt. Listen to me. I've got a right to say. If you know what it's all about. Who do you think you are?. . Don't wanna be your enemy. If I'm not the one you want me to be. And I've gotta do things the way that I do. Always trying to control. Who do you think you are?. . Our time on earth is running through. (It's not a question of my pride). Sometimes I think it's a game to you. (You wonder how to feel inside). Sometimes I play along. But man I've got a mind!. You've gotta live with yourself. For the rest of you life. Do you understand?. Everybody asks the same question. Who do you think you are?. Why do feel ashamed. When you can't explain the things I say. To other people. This just occurred to me. A possibility. The thought that you might really want to be me.
wild boys,"The wild boys are calling on their way back from the fire. In august moon's surrender to a dust cloud on the rise. Wild boys fallen far from glory. Reckless and so hungered on the razor's edge you trail. Because there's murder by the roadside in a sore afraid new world. They tried to break us, looks like they'll try again. Wild boys never lose it. Wild boys never chose this way. Wild boys never close your eyes. Wild boys always shine. You go sirens for a welcome, there's bloodstain for your pain. And your telephone been ringing while you're dancing in the rain. Wild boys wonder where is glory. Where is all you angels now the figureheads have fell. And lovers' war with arrows over secrets they could tell. They tried to tame you, looks like they'll try again. Wild boys never lose it. Wild boys never chose this way. Wild boys never close your eyes. Wild boys always shine"
winter marches on,"(Oooh, ohhh, Mmmm). The trade's on. She drains emotion. To drink from. The breast of fortune. Dreams have frozen. Crystal in the morning. Birthtime rose. A thorn for coronation. All arise from your rest. We'll find enough there to feed you. Soon you'll belong to the blessed. Spare us your lives while we need you. Loud, is the music, the crowd is ringing. Out, of my head as the winter marches on.... Loud is the music the sky is bringing. Out of my head as the winter marches on.... Loud, is the music, the crowd is bringing. Out, of my head as the winter marches on.... Loud is the music the sky is ringing. Out of my head as the winter marches on.... And on.... Winter marches on..."

you kill me with silence,"You're thin ice, I should be on solid ground. And oh, so quiet vice, I can hear the cracking sound. But I remain despite your deadly aim. To drive another lad insane. When you won't speak my name. You kill me with silence. That's your style, girl. You're letting me know. This deafening silence. The only reason that you're in control. You're in control. It's emotional violence. I can't breathe now. But I can't let go. You kill me with silence. Silence, silence. Truth or lies. Things are hoting up in here. If I had a knife. You could cut the atmosphere. Something else. I like this bed of nails. That's what I tell myself. Couldn't be much worse in hell. You kill me with silence. That's your style, girl. You're letting me know. This deafening silence. The only reason that you're in control. You're in control. It's emotional violence. I can't breathe now, but I can't let go. You kill me with silence, silence. You kill me with silence. Kill me with silence"
