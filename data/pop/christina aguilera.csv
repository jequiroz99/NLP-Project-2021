can't hold us down (feat. lil' kim),"So what am I not supposed to have an opinion. Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman. Call me a bitch cos I speak what's on my mind. Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled. When a female fires back. Suddenly big talker don't know how to act. So he does what any little boy will do. Making up a few false rumors or two. That for sure is not a man to me. Slanderin' names for popularity. It's sad you only get your fame through controversy. But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say. This is for my girls all around the world. Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth. Thinking all women should be seen, not heard. So what do we do girls?. Shout out loud!. Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground. Lift your hands high and wave them proud. Take a deep breath and say it loud. Never can, never will, can't hold us down. Nobody can hold us down. Nobody can hold us down. Nobody can hold us down. Never can, never will. So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying. Are you offended by the message I'm bringing. Call me whatever cos your words don't mean a thing. Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing. If you look back in history. It's a common double standard of society. The guy gets all the glory the more he can score. While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore. I don't understand why it's okay. The guy can get away with it & the girl gets named. All my ladies come together and make a change. Start a new beginning for us everybody sing. This is for my girls all around the world. Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth. Thinking all women should be seen, not heard. What do we do girls?. Shout out loud!. Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground. Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud. Take a deep breath and say it loud. Never can, never will, can't hold us down. Check it - Here's something I just can't understand. If the guy have three girls then he's the man. He can either give us some head, sex her off. If the girl do the same, then she's a whore. But the table's about to turn. I'll bet my fame on it. Cats take my ideas and put their name on it. It's aiight though, you can't hold me down. I got to keep on movin'. To all my girls with a man who be tryin to mack. Do it right back to him and let that be that. You need to let him know that his game is whack. And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back. But you're just a little boy. Think you're so cute, so coy. You must talk so big. To make up for smaller things. So you're just a little boy. All you'll do is annoy. You must talk so big. To make up for smaller things. This is for my girls.... This is for my girls all around the world. Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth. Thinking all women should be seen, not heard. So what do we do girls?. Should out loud!. Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground. Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud.

And still today, you hear us say: play that song all night long, mr. DJ. Though times have changed, it's still the same, we all need a minute to get away. So let it go and feel the flow, if you got soul, let the world know. We're gonna set the mood, gonna go back to an old school groove. Gonna rewind to another time, when the originators, innovators were alive, yeah. So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James, your Lady Day, and Coltrane. Turn up your 45's, bring back to life the sound and vibe of yesterday. Open your mind, enjoy the ride, live out tonight and grab that Soul Train. Take it back, take it, back in the day, back in the day (oh baby). Back in the day, back in the day (won't you take me back?). Back in the day, back in the day (I'll do it) back in the day, back in the day. Y'all remember back in the day, Ray Charles, King Cole, Miles Davis. Yeah, now ""Chain Of Fools"" and ""Respect"" was the anthem of a woman, Aretha said. ""What's Going On"", ""Let's Get It On"" such classic songs, don't forget them. Though times have changed, they still remains my inspiration everyday. So give it up for the ones who came before, opened up that door. We're gonna set the mood, gonna go back to an old school groove. Gonna rewind to another time, when the originators, innovators were alive, yeah. So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James, your Lady Day and Coltrane. Turn up your 45's, bring back to life the sound and vibe of yesterday.

can't hold us down (feat. lil' kim),"So what am I not supposed to have an opinion. Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman. Call me a bitch cos I speak what's on my mind. Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled. When a female fires back. Suddenly big talker don't know how to act. So he does what any little boy will do. Making up a few false rumors or two. That for sure is not a man to me. Slanderin' names for popularity. It's sad you only get your fame through controversy. But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say. This is for my girls all around the world. Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth. Thinking all women should be seen, not heard. So what do we do girls?. Shout out loud!. Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground. Lift your hands high and wave them proud. Take a deep breath and say it loud. Never can, never will, can't hold us down. Nobody can hold us down. Nobody can hold us down. Nobody can hold us down. Never can, never will. So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying. Are you offended by the message I'm bringing. Call me whatever cos your words don't mean a thing. Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing. If you look back in history. It's a common double standard of society. The guy gets all the glory the more he can score. While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore. I don't understand why it's okay. The guy can get away with it & the girl gets named. All my ladies come together and make a change. Start a new beginning for us everybody sing. This is for my girls all around the world. Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth. Thinking all women should be seen, not heard. What do we do girls?. Shout out loud!. Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground. Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud. Take a deep breath and say it loud. Never can, never will, can't hold us down. Check it - Here's something I just can't understand. If the guy have three girls then he's the man. He can either give us some head, sex her off. If the girl do the same, then she's a whore. But the table's about to turn. I'll bet my fame on it. Cats take my ideas and put their name on it. It's aiight though, you can't hold me down. I got to keep on movin'. To all my girls with a man who be tryin to mack. Do it right back to him and let that be that. You need to let him know that his game is whack. And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back. But you're just a little boy. Think you're so cute, so coy. You must talk so big. To make up for smaller things. So you're just a little boy. All you'll do is annoy. You must talk so big. To make up for smaller things. This is for my girls.... This is for my girls all around the world. Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth. Thinking all women should be seen, not heard. So what do we do girls?. Should out loud!. Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground. Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud.

castle walls,"[Christina Aguilera]. Everyone thinks that I have it all. But it's so empty living behind these castle walls, these castle walls. If I should tumble, if I should fall. Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls?. There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls. [T.I. - Verso 1]. Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in. Bet you think I got it made, better look again. I got a butler, got a maid, and a mansion. The belief is that I'm living out a millionaire's fantasy. With Phantoms e Ferrari's in the driveway. But you see the pain and the change of the sane man's sanity. Your vision jaded by the Grammy's on the mantelpiece. Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony. Apparently it's damaging the man you see before you. On the canvas he may seem alright but all the disadvantages. His family encounters overshadows his extravagance. Walk in my lines while I dare you with a stare at you. While it surelly seem like the King's life ain't glamorous. As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs. Because the cameras doesn't see beyond the walls of the smiles. Only counts until it falls in the pile. [Christina Aguilera]. Everyone thinks that I have it all. But it's so empty living behind these castle walls (these castle walls). If I should tumble, if I should fall. Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls?. There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls. [T.I. - Verso 2]. Honestly to me, I think I'd lose every benefit of all that I've accomplished. If my key is never with it, shit me knowing this. Why should the verses I have laid. Be more important to me than the persons I have raised?. I guess I'm saying that to say that oppotunity. But they just don't equate to all the time they take away. From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake. If Deyjah end up a stripper and Major slinging Yay. How could I ever consider myself a great. If Messiah ain't paied and ?Nique'Nique ain't straight. Would your favorite song about the whips, money and shit. Be relevant If you found out the money wasn't real, nope. So me being the GOAT shouldn't mean. More to me than see it to a king though. From a bad ass kid to a man with some dough. Otherwise I may well have stayed poor. So while they stay focused on me beefing with Flip,. Shawty Low, with Gucci or Ludacris. Or if I'm fucking with a hoe,. Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense. Internally I'm dealing with this conflict. So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand. Or slap me in the face, hey, I'm just the man. If they saying I ain't the best in making hit records. It's 'cause this is my life, this ain't just rapping. Didn't think it all it was that deep, did ya dawg. See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls. Didn't think it all it was that deep, did ya dawg. See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls. [Christina Aguilera]. Everyone thinks that I have it all. But it's so empty living behind these castle walls (these castle walls). If I should tumble, if I should fall. Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls?. There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls. Nobody knows I'm all alone. Living in this castle made of stone. They say that money is freedom but I feel trapped inside it all. And while I sit so high up on a throne. I wonder how I can feel this low. On top of the world it's beautiful. But there's no place to fall. [T.I. - Verso 3]. For the record ay, I give a damn if I never said shit again. My career was meant for me to come and tell it. Honest interpretation of how affected I'm faced. With matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement. The day that I walk away I ain't saying that I'm amazing. Downplaying the way I keep fellas from catching cases. Won't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying. And when I say what I mean even when I'm surrounded by the fakers. From one of the greatest centers, blessed with most of God's graces. Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places. So next time you rating royalty. I'm always being given to recordings than the level of your loyalty. (Hmm). Obviously you've been ignoring me. Who else ya seen make it through the storm, unharmed disjointed. While all the critics was looking for Prince charming. Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt. Even tho he made a castle out of what used to be a house. He did shit that all your favorite rappers only rap about. But most of ya'll don't see the castle through the walls. And the smiles till it fall in piles so while. [Christina Aguilera]. Everyone thinks that I have it all. But it's so empty living behind these castle walls. (These castle walls, yeah yeah, yeah yeah). If I should tumble (If I should tumble), if I should fall. Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls?. There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls"

change,"When I was young I would look in the mirror. Didn't know it then but now it couldn't be clearer. I remember being filled with such wonder. Before learning that the world can be harsher. Who you love or the color of your skin. Or the place that you were born and grew up in. Shouldn't decide how you will be treated. 'cause we're all the same when everybody's breathing. Waiting for a change to set us free. Waiting for the day when you can be you. And I can be me. Waiting for a hope to come around. Waiting for the day when hate is lost. And love is found. Waiting for a change, waiting for a change. Change. Change. For all the brave and the souls who went before us. Stand tall, then proudly lift your voices. Let them know who we are in our choices. And one day we won't have to sing this chorus. Waiting for a change to set us free. Waiting for the day when you can be you. And I can be me. Waiting for a hope to come around. Waiting for the day when hate is lost. And love is found. Waiting for a change, waiting for a change. Change. Change. Waiting for a change. Change. When I was young I would look in the mirror. Didn't see it then but now it couldn't be clearer"

Packing all my bags, finally on the move. I'm leaving today. Livin' it, leaving it to change. As I'm driving I'm captured by the view. So much beauty the road becomes my muse. The heat is rising and my head surfs through the wind. Cool, calm, collected is the child that lies within, see. I'm leaving today. Livin' it, leaving it to change. I'm leaving today. Livin' it, leaving it to change. But somehow I miss it, I think I'll really miss it one day. I turn up the radio and I'm feeling like I've never felt before.

No more, oh no, it's over. 'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture. I wouldn't know how to be this way now. And never back down. So I wanna say thank you. 'Cause it makes me that much stronger.

I've had enough. 'Cause it makes me that much stronger. Makes me work a little bit harder. It makes me that much wiser. So thanks for making me a fighter. Made me learn a little bit faster.

Oh yes. I will be. Strong on my own. I will see through the rain. I will find my way. I will keep on. Traveling this road. Till I finally reach my dream. Till I'm living, and I'm breathing.

i'm ok,"Once upon a time there was a girl. In her early years she had to learn. How to grow up living in a war that she called home. Never knew just where to turn for shelter from the storm. It hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face. Every time my father's fist would put her in her place. Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room. Hoping it would be over soon. Chorus:. Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same. And I still remember how you kept me so afraid. Stenght is my mother for all the love she gave. And every morning that I wake I look back at yesterday. And I'm Ok. I often wonder why I carry all this guilt. When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built. Shadows stir at night trough a crack in the door. Echoes of broken child screaming please no more. Daddy don't you understand the damage you have done. For you is just a memory but for me it still lives on. Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same. And I still remember how you kept me so, so afraid. Stenght is my mother for all the love she gave. And every morning that I pray I look back to yesterday. It's not so easy to forget, all the marks you left along her neck. When I was thrown against cold stairs. And everyday afraid to come home in fear of what I might see, next. Chorus. Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same. And I still remember how you kept me so afraid. Stenght is my mother for all the love she gave. And every morning that I wake I look back at yesterday. And I'm Ok"

infatuation,"He comes from a foreign place. An island far away. Intrigues me with every move. Til I'm breathless, I'm helpless. Can't keep my cool. Steals my heart when he takes my hand. And we dance to the rhythm of the band. Feel his fingertips grip my hips. And I slip as we dip into a state of bliss. Mama used to warn me to beware. those latin lovers. Said I gave my heart too soon. And that's how I became your mother. Said ay mama, you seem to forget. I'm not in love yet. Sweet talk don't win me over. But I realize. Big brown eyes I'm hypnotized. When he says. I am full blood boricua. Read the tattoo on his arm. He tells me ""Mami, I need ya!"". And my heartbeat pumps so strong. Getting lost in a ritmo. He whispers ""Te quiero"", te quiero. I begin to give in with no hesitation. Can't help my infatuation. It's pure infatuation. Skin the color of cinnamon. His eyes light up. And I'm filled within. Feels so good it must be a sin. I can't stop what I started I'm giving in. He brings life to my fantasies. Sparks a passion inside of me. Find the words and I cannot speak. In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me. Mama used to warn me. not to rush love with another. Said I'm not trying to lecture. I just care about my daughter. Ay mama, you seem to forget. I never would never let. A man control my emotions. When he smiles. I feel like a little child. When he says. I am full blood boricua. Read the tattoo on his arm. He tells me ""Mami, I need ya!"". And my heartbeat pumps so strong. Getting lost in a ritmo. He whispers ""Te quiero"", Te quiero. I begin to give in with no hesitation. Can't help my infatuation. It's pure infatuation. Caught between my mother's words. And what I feel inside. Wanting to explore his world. But part of me wants to hide. Should I risk it. Can't resist it. This has caught me by surprise. Should I let him take me to Puerto Rico. I can't hold back no more. Let's go tonight. I am full blood boricua. Read the tattoo on his arm. He tells me ""Mami, I need ya!"". And my heartbeat pumps so strong. Getting lost in a ritmo. He whispers ""Te quiero"", te quiero. I begin to give in with no hesitation. Can't help my infatuation. It's pure infatuation. Can't help my infatuation. It's pure infatuation (Infatuation)"
intro (back to basics),"A very pleasant good evening ladies and gentlemen. It is now time... the one and only... there never will be another.... Christina Aguilera... That's how music should sound. Oh yeah, I've waited for some time to get inside the minds of every legend I ever wanted to stand beside. It's like an image, feeling the lows and highs of every lyric and melody, every single rhyme. So here I stand today, in tribute I do pay to those before me who laid it down and paved the way. So to God I pray that he will give me strength to carry forward the gift of song in his good faith, In his good faith.... I'm going back to basics to where it all began, I'm ready now to face it, I wanna understand. What made the soul singers and the blues figures that inspired a higher generation. The jazz makers and the ground breakers that did so much for themselves and dedication. So here I stand today, in tribute I do pay to those before me who laid it down and paved the way"

But it wouldn't be nothing. Nothing without a woman or a girl. Man thinks about a little baby girls and a baby boys. Man makes them happy 'cause man makes them toys. And after man has made everything, everything he can. You know that man makes money to buy from other man. This is a man's world. But it wouldn't be nothing. Nothing without a woman or a girl. He's lost in the wilderness. He's lost in bitterness"

keep on singin' my song,"I woke up this morning with a smile on my face. Nobody's going to bring me down today. Been feeling like nothings been going my way lately. So I decided right here and now that my outlooks got to change. That's why I'm going to. Say goodbye to all the tears I've cried. For every time somebody hurt my pride. Feeling like they won't let me live life. And take the time to look at what is mine. I see every lesson so clearly. I thank God for what I got from above. I believe they can take anything from me. But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace. They can say all they want to say about me. But I'm going to carry on. Keep on singing my song. I never want to dwell on my pain again. There's no use in reliving how I hurt back then. Remembering all of the hell I felt when I was running out of faith. Every step I vowed to take was towards a better day. Because I'm about to. Say goodbye to every single lie. All the fears I've held too long inside. Every time I felt I couldn't try. All the negativity I had inside. For too long I've been struggling. I couldn't go on. But now I've found. I'm feeling strong and moving on. I believe they can take anything from me. But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace. They can say all they want to say about me. But I'm going to carry on. Keep on singing my song. Every time I tried to be what they wanted from me. It never came naturally. So I ended up in misery, wasn't able to see. All the good around me. Wasted so much energy on what they thought of me. Simply just remembering to breathe. I'm human. I am not able to please. Everyone at the same time, so now I find. My peace of mind living one day at a time. I'm human and I answer to one god. It comes down to one love. Until I get to heaven above. I have made the decision never to give up. Till the I day I die no matter what. I'm going to carry on and keep on singing my song. (I believe they can take anything from me. But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace). They can do what they wanna. Say what they wanna say. (They can say what they wanna). But I'm gonna keep on. (keep on). I believe that they can take from me. but they can't take my inner piece. Say what you wanna say. I'm gonna sing my song"

Never listen to the lies and jealousy. You better stop. Don't you let them turn you around. You better stop. Hang onto this love that weave found. Nuthin ever say. Can stand in our way. Chorus. I want you, I need you - You know that I believe you. We got It, you know it,. So if it's real just show it. Chorus."

the right man,"So many years have gone by. Always strong, tried not to cry. Never felt like I needed any man. To comfort me in life. But I'm all made up today. A veil upon my face. But no father stands beside me. To give his bride away. Well I'm standing in the chapel. Wearing my white dress. I have waited for this moment. With tears of happiness. Here I leave behind my past. By taking the chance. I've finally found the right man. Thoughts racing fast through my mind. As I'm gazing down the aisle. That my future will mend the memories. Sown between father and child. My emotions overload. 'cause there is no hand to hold. There's no shoulder here to lean on. I'm walking all on my own. Here I go. Now I'm standing at for corners. To have and to hold. Now my love, you stand beside me. To walk life's winding road. And I owe it all to you. For taking the chance. You've shown my there's a right man. 'cause I never knew a right man. Well I'm standing in the chapel. Ready to confess. That I've waited for this moment. With tears of happiness. Now I leave behind my past. By taking the chance. Ohh. Well I'm standing at for corners. To have and to hold. Now my love, you stand beside me. To walk life's winding road. And I owe it all to you. For taking the chance. And one day my little girl. Will reach out her hand. She'll know I found the right man."
the voice within,"Young girl, don't cry. I'll be right here when your world starts to fall. Young girl, it's alright. Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly.

Chorus:. When there's no one else, look inside yourself. Like your oldest friend just trust the voice within. Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way. You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within. Young girl, don't hide. You'll never change if you just run away. Young girl, just hold tight. Soon you're gonna see your brighter day. Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed. It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid. No one reaches out a hand for you to hold. When you're lost outside look inside to your soul. Repeat Chorus. When there's no one else, look inside yourself. Like your oldest friend just trust the voice within. Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way. You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within. Yeah.... Life is a journey. It can take you anywhere you choose to go. As long as you're learning. You'll find all you'll ever need to know (be strong). You'll break it (hold on). You'll make it (be strong). Just don't forsake it because. (No one can tell you what you can't do). No one can stop you, you know that I'm talking to you. Repeat Chorus. When there's no one else, look inside yourself.

welcome,"Welcome to the greatest show. Greatest show on earth. You've never seen before. Let the fairytale unfold. What's behind the smoke and glass?. Painted faces, everybody wears a mask.

With a smile upon your face. But soon the shine fades. And you're left out all alone. Wondering ""where did they all go?"". Been jaded, hated. Who'll be around when the limelight's faded?. Been shut down, pushed out. Made to smile when I wanted to frown. Always takin' a bow. Always workin' the crowd. Always breakin' new ground. Always playin' the clown. Who'll be stickin' it out?. Who'll be stayin' around. When the lights go down?. Correção: Marcelo Sarasol"
