I thought that it was worth it. To let myself just disappear. You come to me in dreams at night. (Come to me in dreams at night). I wake up and I see the light. Sometimes I wish that I could change. But not for me, for you. So we could be together, forever. But I know, I know that I won't change for you. Cause where were you for me. When I needed someone?. When I needed someone?. When I needed you?. When I needed you?. Once upon a time I. Thought you were the hero. I waited for you all night. I closed my eyes and slept for years. You kissed me like a sunrise. My feet up to my forehead. I felt it like a goodbye. I'm not myself. Sometimes I wish that I could change. But not for me, for you. So we could be together, forever.

worldly matters,"Hot pink skies, twilight of the day. I think that I've been going bout this the wrong way. Kids on my street got it right man,. Barefoot hide and seek. My best friend she lives up the road. Haven't talked to her in weeks. Oh time don't blind me, I am so sorry. I've been swept up in my own concerns. And the worldly matters, they just don't matter at all. No, not at all. I keep on walking I stop. Ditching all my plans. I want to climb that cedar tree and leave me in good hands. What happened to me on the way to something higher. What will be left when I have all that I desire?. Oh time don't blind me, I am so sorry. I've been swept up in my own concerns. And the worldly matters, they just don't matter at all. No, not at all. No, not at all"
