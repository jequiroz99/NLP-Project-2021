gimme! gimme! gimme! (a man after midnight),"Half past twelve. And I'm watching the late show. In my flat, all alone. How I hate to spend the evening on my own. Autumn winds. Blowing outside the window. As I look around the room. And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom. There's not a soul out there. No one to hear my prayer. Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight. Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away. Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight. Take me through the darkness to the break of the day. Movie stars. Find the end of the rainbow. With a fortune to win. It's so different from the world I'm living in. Tired of TV. I open the window. And I gaze into the night. But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight. There's not a soul out there. No one to hear my prayer. Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight. Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away. Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight. Take me through the darkness to the break of the day. Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight. Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight. There's not a soul out there. No one to hear my prayer. Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight. Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away. Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight. Take me through the darkness to the break of the day.

fernando,"Can you hear the drums, Fernando?. I remember, long ago, another starry night like this. In the firelight, Fernando. You were humming to yourself. And softly strumming your guitar. I could hear the distant drums. And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar. They were closer now, Fernando. Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally. I was so afraid, Fernando. We were young and full of life. And none of us prepared to die. And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns. And cannons almost made me cry. There was something in the air that night. The stars were bright, Fernando. They were shining there for you and me. For liberty, Fernando. Though we never thought that we could lose. There's no regret. If I had to do the same again. I would, my friend, Fernando. If I had to do the same again. I would, my friend, Fernando. Now we're old and grey, Fernando. Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand. Can you hear the drums, Fernando?. Do you still recall the frightful night. We crossed the Rio Grande?. I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were. To fight for freedom in this land. There was something in the air that night. The stars were bright, Fernando. They were shining there for you and me. For liberty, Fernando. Though I never thought that we could lose. There's no regret. If I had to do the same again. I would, my friend, Fernando. There was something in the air that night. The stars were bright, Fernando. They were shining there for you and me.

heart of stone,"Beneath the white fire of the moon. Love's wings are broken all too soon. We never learn. Hurt together, hurt alone. Don't you sometimes wish your heart was a heart of stone?. We turn the wheel and break the chain. Put steel to steel and laugh at pain. We're dreamers in castles made of sand. The road to Eden's overgrown. Don't you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone?. Look at the headlines:. ""Big crowd at the crazy house. Long queue for the joker's shoes. Ten rounds in the ring with love"". Do you lose and win, or win and lose?. Sweet rain like mercy in the night. (Lay me down, wash away the sorrow). Caress my soul and set it right. (Lay me down, show me your tomorrow). Summer tears, winter and the moment's flown. Dont' you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone?. Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone. Get the picture?. ""No room for the innocent. Peak season in lonely town. Knocked out of the ring by love"". Are you down and up, or up and down?. I ask the river for a sign. (In a dream, we go on together). How long is love supposed to shine?. (In a dream, diamonds are forever). But you and I, we're hurt together, hurt alone. Don't you sometimes wish your heart was a heart of stone?. Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone. (With a heart of stone, you'll be well protected). Don't you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone?. (With a heart of stone, you'll be well connected). Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone. (With a heart of stone, you'll be well protected). Don't you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone?. (With a heart of stone, you'll be well connected). Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone (fade)"
mamma mia,"I've been cheated by you since I don't know when. So I made up my mind, it must come to an end. Look at me now, will I ever learn?. I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control. There's a fire within my soul. Just one look and I can hear a bell ring. One more look and I forget everything. Woah-oh oh-oh. Mamma mia, here I go again. My my, how can I resist you?. Mamma mia, does it show again?. My my, just how much I've missed you. Yes, I've been brokenhearted. Blue since the day we parted. Why, why did I ever let you go?. Mamma mia, now I really know. My my, I could never let you go. I've been angry and sad about things that you do. I can't count all the times. That I've told you we're through. And when you go, when you slam the door. I think you know that you won't be away too long. You know that I'm not that strong. Just one look and I can hear a bell ring. One more look and I forget everything. Woah-oh oh-oh. Mamma mia, here I go again. My my, how can I resist you?. Mamma mia, does it show again?. My my, just how much I've missed you. Yes, I've been brokenhearted. Blue since the day we parted. Why, why did I ever let you go?. Mamma mia, even if I say. Bye bye, leave me now or never. Mamma mia, it's a game we play. Bye bye doesn't mean forever. Mamma mia, here I go again. My my, how can I resist you?. Mamma mia, does it show again?. My my, just how much I've missed you. Yes, I've been brokenhearted. Blue since the day we parted. Why, why did I ever let you go?. Mamma mia, now I really know. My my, I could never let you go"
sos,"Where are those happy days. they seem so hard to find. I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind. Whatever happened to our love. I wish I understood.

How can I even try to go on. When you're gone. Though I try how can I carry on. You seemed so far away though you were standing near. You made me feel alive, but something died I fear.

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay,. Watching the tide roll away, ouh,. I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay,. Wasting time.. I left my home in Georgia,. Headed for the Frisco bay. I have nothing to live for,. Look like nothings gonna come my way,. So I'm just go sit on the dock of the bay. Watching the tide roll away,. I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay,. Wasting time. Look like nothings gonna change,. Everything still remain the same,. I can't do what ten people tell me to do,. So I guess I'll remain the same, yes,. Sittin' here resting my bones,. And this loneliness won't leave me alone, yes,. Two thousand miles I roam. Just to make this dock my home. Now I'm just go sit at the dock of the bay. Watching the tide roll away, ooh. Sittin' on the dock of the bay. Wasting time"
(this is a) song for the lonely,"When you're standing on the edge of nowhere. There's only one way up. So your heart's gotta go there. Through the darkest nights. See the lights shine bright.

I could play, if I do every thing he'd say. Girls seem to just get in his way. Those days we weren't considered fun. A cowboy's work is never done. He'd fight crime all the time. He'd always win,. Till his mom would break it up. And call him in. He was tough he was hard. But he was kind. and he was love, cause guys like him. Were hard to find. Ride, I like to ride again some day.

a whiter shade of pale,"We skipped a light fandango,. Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor.. I was feeling kind of seasick,. But the crowd called out for more.. The room was humming harder,. As the ceiling flew away.. When we called out for another drink,. The waiter brought a tray.. And so it was that later,. As the miller told his tale,. That her face at first just ghostly,. Turned a whiter shade of pale.. She said there is no reason,. And the truth is plain to see. That I wandered through my playing cards,. And would not let her be. One of sixteen vestal virgins. Who were leaving for the coast.. And although my eyes were open,. They might just as well have been closed.. And so it was later,. As the miller told his tale,. That her face at first just ghostly,. Turned a whiter shade of pale."
a woman's story,"There are many who have laid with me. Then got up and walked away from me. And played around with me, like I was a game. Every night was a one night fling. And when I'd given them everything. They never even asked me for my name. No, they never even asked me for my name. Now I found real love!. Make no mistake about it. 'Cause now that I feel love. I just can't live without it!. So if you love me the way I love you. Why can't we spend our lives as one. My reputation was all over town. As a woman who was passed around. And I knew every wrong way to go. Seen every room with a bed inside it. And if you've had nothing tried, I tried it. But from now on I say, hell no!. Oh, from now on I say, hell no!. Oh!, now that I found love!. I just can't live without it!. Now that I feel love,. Make no mistake about it!. So if you love me the way I love you. Why can't we spend our lives as one"
a world without heroes,"A World Without Heroes. . A world without heroes. Is like a world without sun. You can't look up to anyone. Without heroes. And a world without heroes. Is like a never ending race. It's like a time, without a place. A pointless thing, devoid of grace. Where you don't know what your after. Or if something's after you. And you don't know why you don't know. In a world without heroes. In a world without dreams. Things are no more than they seem. A world without heroes. Is like a bird without wings. Or a bell that never rings. Just a sad and useless thing. Where you don't know what your after. Or if something's after you. And you don't know why you don't know.

Your kiss was so brand new. Every memory repeats. Every step I take retreats. Every journey always brings me back to you. After all the stops and starts. We keep coming back to these two hearts. Two angels who've been rescued from the fall. And after all that we've been through. It all comes down to me and you. I guess it's meant to be. Forever you and me. After all.

Forever you and me. After all. Always just beyond my touch. Though I needed you so much. After all what else is living for. After all the stops and starts. We keep coming back to these two hearts. Two angels who've been rescued from the fall. And after all that we've been through. It all comes down to me and you. I guess it's meant to be. Forever you and me. After all the stops and starts.

again,Again evening finds me at your door. Here to ask you just once more. If we could try again. I don't know quite what to say. Never was too good that way. So won't you help me again.

And if only fools are kind, Alfie,. then I guess it's wise to be cruel.. And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie,. what will you lend on an old golden rule?. As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie,. I know there's something much more,. something even non-believers can believe in.. I believe in love, Alfie.. Without true love we just exist, Alfie.. Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie.. When you walk let your heart lead the way. and you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie."
alive again,All alone. I must stand. Even when I'm running. And it feels. Like a dream. I need to awaken from. I believe. When it hurts. We must keep trying. But I want. And I need.

I only wanna learn to feel the rain. Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling. I only wanna learn to freeze the flame. I know i'll be alive again. I wanna be alive again. Here's the night. Where's the stars. 'coz I need some guiding. And it cuts. Like a knife. As I watch you walk away. There's a bridge I need to burn before I leave. I just wanna to live again. Like a stormy rain I need to feel the heat again. . I only wanna keep the stone from rolling. I only wanna learn to feel the rain. Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling. I only wanna learn to freeze the flame. I know i'll be alive again. I wanna be alive again. I wanna be alive again. Coz I did my best. Baby who'd have guessed. That i've failed the test. 'coz when love ain't best. And it's laid to rest. It can leave a mess. I only wanna keep the stone from rolling. I only wanna learn to feel the rain. Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling. I only wanna learn to freeze the flame. I know i'll be alive again. I wanna be alive again

bang bang,"Bang bang, you shot me down. Bang bang, I hit the ground. Bang bang, that awful sound. Bang bang, my baby shot me down. I was five and you were six. We rode on horses made of sticks. I wore black, you wore white. You would always win the fight. Bang bang, you shot me down. Bang bang, I hit the ground. Bang bang, that awful sound. Bang bang, my baby shot me down. Seasons came and changed the time. I grew up, I called you mine. You would always laugh and say. Remember when we used to play. Bang bang, I shot you down. Bang bang, you hit the ground. Bang bang, that awful sound. Bang bang, I used to shoot you down. Music played and people sang. Just for me the church bells rang. After echoes from a gun. We both vowed that we'd be one. Now you're gone I don't know why. Sometimes I cry. You didn't say goodbye. You didn't take the time to lie. Bang bang, you shot me down. Bang bang, I hit the ground. Bang bang, that awful sound. Bang bang, my baby shot me down"
behind the door,"Behind the door of every house,. In every street, in every town. A story is unfolding. A story is unfolding of love and hate. The most of us wait of hopes and fears. Of smiles and tears of dreams. That lies a moldering. Behind the door of every house,. In every street, in every town. The stage is set for playing. The stage is set for playing. And I call crime and punch your mime. Sweet romance, a rich will dance. Characters are playing. Behind the door of every house,. In every street, in every town. The people are a waiting. The people are a waiting. To bare and die, the years go by. The wedding spree the cruelty. And still they go on mating. And to the one the only one. Remember when the need of man. Is greater again. The prayers take off ascending. All filled of love to the one above. Asking for asking for asking for asking for. A happy ending a happy ending a happy ending."

dangerous times,"I don't know if it's in my mind. Watching all the shadows behind me. Cause I could get hurt. Or maybe this time. The cloud has got a silver lining. And if I'm scared, I got a right to be. I know, you could wound me critically. CHORUS:. These are dangerous times. And if I take some chances. Put my heart on the line. What would you do to me. If I give myself up. To these circumstances. In these dangerous times. Would you keep me safely. Over the hill, there's an army of fools. Waiting for their hearts to be broken. How do I know. If I'm gonna explode. When I come out in the open. 'Cause even lovers can turn into enemies. I don't wanna be a casualty. These are dangerous times. And if I take some chances. Put my heart on the line. What would you do to me. If I give myself up. To these circumstances. In these dangerous times. Would you keep me. Would you keep me. Baby would you keep me safely tonight. Can I trust you with all of my affections?. Can I trust you to be on my side?. In these dangerous times. Chorus x 2."
dark lady,"The fortune queen of New Orleans. Was brushing her cat in her black limousine. On the back seat were scratches. From the marks of men her fortune she had won. Couldn't see through the tinted glass. She said, ""Home James"" and he hit the gas. I followed her to some darkened room. She took my money, she said, ""I'll be with you soon"". CHORUS:. Dark lady laughed and danced. And lit the candles one by one. Danced to her gypsy music. Till her brew was done. Dark lady played black magic. Till the clock struck on the twelve. She told me more about me. Than I knew myself. She dealt two cards, a queen and a three. And mumbled some words. That were so strange to me. Then she turned up a two-eyed jack. My eyes saw red but the card. Still stayed black. She said the man you love is secretly true. To someone else who is very close to you. My advice is that you leave this place. Never come back and forget you ever saw my face. Chorus. So I ran home and crawled in my bed. I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said. Then I remembered her strange perfume. And how I smelled it once in my own room. So I sneaked back and caught her with my man. Laughing and kissing till they saw the gun in my hand. The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor. Dark lady would never turn a card up anymore. Chorus."

Ah I just want to serenade you. Maybe we could even live a verse or two. And I could finish this ole love song. So I could start singing it to you. I could start singing it to you. If I could finish this ole love song. And I could start singing it to you. Won't you come and boogie-woogie with me baby. It's been a while since I held you close to me. I haven't met many boys like you baby. Knew I would find you eventually. Chorus"

does anybody really fall in love anymore,"I walked down the street. People passing me by. They just look me up and down. But they don't look me in the eye. I'm just another stranger. In my own home town. Looking for an angel. But heaven can't be found. I say hey, are you lonely tonight?. Hey, hey, hey I'm gonna make it through. But that don't make it right.

elusive butterfly,"(Bob Lind). You might wake up some morning. To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind. And if you're quick enough to rise. You'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow. Out on the new horizon. You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings. And if the sleep has left your ears. You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow. Don't be concerned, it will not harm you. It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of. Across my dreams, with nets of wonder. I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love. You might have heard my footsteps. Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind. I might have even called your name. As I ran searching after something to believe in. You might have seen me runnin'. Through the long abandonned ruins of the dreams you left behind. If you remember something there. That glided past you followed close by heavy breathing. Don't be concerned, it will not harm you. It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of. Across my dreams, with nets of wonder. I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love. Across my dreams, with nets of wonder. I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love. Across my dreams, with nets of wonder. I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love."

fernando,"Can you hear the drums, Fernando?. I remember, long ago, another starry night like this. In the firelight, Fernando. You were humming to yourself. And softly strumming your guitar. I could hear the distant drums. And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar. They were closer now, Fernando. Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally. I was so afraid, Fernando. We were young and full of life. And none of us prepared to die. And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns. And cannons almost made me cry. There was something in the air that night. The stars were bright, Fernando. They were shining there for you and me. For liberty, Fernando. Though we never thought that we could lose. There's no regret. If I had to do the same again. I would, my friend, Fernando. If I had to do the same again. I would, my friend, Fernando. Now we're old and grey, Fernando. Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand. Can you hear the drums, Fernando?. Do you still recall the frightful night. We crossed the Rio Grande?. I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were. To fight for freedom in this land. There was something in the air that night. The stars were bright, Fernando. They were shining there for you and me. For liberty, Fernando. Though I never thought that we could lose. There's no regret. If I had to do the same again. I would, my friend, Fernando. There was something in the air that night. The stars were bright, Fernando. They were shining there for you and me.

Who to send it to. CHORUS:. I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days. That I thought would never end. I've seen lonely times. When I could not find a friend. But I always thought that I'd see you again. Won't you look down upon me, Jesus. You've got to help me make a stand. You've just got to see me through another day. My body's aching and my time is at hand. And I won't make it any other way. Chorus. Been walking my mind to an easy time. My back turned towards the sun. Lord knows when the cold wind blows. It'll turn you head around. Well there's hours of time on the telephone line. To talk about things to come. Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground. Chorus."

Here comes the rich man in his long black limousine. Here comes the poor man all you got to have is green. Here comes the lawyer, banker and the cop. One thing for certain it ain't never gonna stop. When it all gets too heavy. That's when they come and go. Only one thing in common. They got the fire down below. It happens out in Vegas happens in Moline. On the blue blood streets of Boston. Up in Berkeley and out in Queens. And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight. Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right. And he's looking out for Rosie and she's looking mighty fine. And he's walking the streets for Nancy. And he'll find her everytime. When the street light flicker bringing on the night. Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight. All through the midnight. Watch 'em come and watch 'em go. Only one thing in common. They got the fire down below."
fires of eden,"It's not over till it's over. I heard someone say. Must be a whisper in the wind. 'Cause you're too far away. But in my restless sleep. I could swear I saw you next to me. Saying oh, I'm coming home. You'll never spend another night alone. CHORUS:. Remember when love was innocent. There was never a better time. But you know those fires of Eden. Still burn in this heart of mine. The morning's uncertain. It's a nervous day. And I look for a reason. Why I should feel this way. I hear a voice run before. Drifting through my open door. Saying it's alright. We're going to light those flames tonight. Chorus. Remember when love was freedom. We knew we were two of a kind. But you know those fires of Eden. Still burn in this heart of mine. And don't you wonder. How we drifted so far. When we belong to each other. Oh we were miles apart. And there's a place. That was meant for the two of us. And when you touch the embers. You feel my love. As strong as it ever was. Chorus. Remember when love was freedom. We knew we were two of a kind. But you know those fires of Eden. Still burn in this heart of mine."

he'll never know,They go off and leave me behind. They have so many words to find. I run to catch a glimpse of them. Just walking in the sun. Knowing they'll be mine again.

That I built my life around. CHORUS:. He'll never know of that night long ago. He'll never know it's locked in my mind. No he'll never know. From the feelings I show. He'll never know.

When the morning's almost here. He reaches out to draw me near. Silently I search his face for the love. I hope to see and once again. I'm sure that all his love belongs to me. Chorus.
heart of stone,"Beneath the white fire of the moon. Love's wings are broken all too soon. We never learn. Hurt together, hurt alone. Don't you sometimes wish your heart was a heart of stone?. We turn the wheel and break the chain. Put steel to steel and laugh at pain. We're dreamers in castles made of sand. The road to Eden's overgrown. Don't you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone?. Look at the headlines:. ""Big crowd at the crazy house. Long queue for the joker's shoes. Ten rounds in the ring with love"". Do you lose and win, or win and lose?. Sweet rain like mercy in the night. (Lay me down, wash away the sorrow). Caress my soul and set it right. (Lay me down, show me your tomorrow). Summer tears, winter and the moment's flown. Dont' you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone?. Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone. Get the picture?. ""No room for the innocent. Peak season in lonely town. Knocked out of the ring by love"". Are you down and up, or up and down?. I ask the river for a sign. (In a dream, we go on together). How long is love supposed to shine?. (In a dream, diamonds are forever). But you and I, we're hurt together, hurt alone. Don't you sometimes wish your heart was a heart of stone?. Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone. (With a heart of stone, you'll be well protected). Don't you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone?. (With a heart of stone, you'll be well connected). Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone. (With a heart of stone, you'll be well protected). Don't you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone?. (With a heart of stone, you'll be well connected). Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone (fade)"

i hate to sleep alone,"You were the only thing I had. How could a good love go so bad. Somehow I guess I should have known. That you would leave me here alone. They say you found somebody new. But that won't change my love for you. How could you leave me on my own. You know I hate to sleep alone. Remember how it used to be. When you were here with me. You were the only one I've known. And how I hate to sleep alone. Someday, some way, somebody new. Will make you feel the way that I do. But I just wish that you'd come home. You know that I hate to sleep alone. But I just wish that you'd come home. You know that I hate to sleep alone."

I peeped into your fanstasies. CHORUS:. It works every time. I'm confident. I can take you. I can take you anytime. I paralyze. Body and soul are immobilize. Honey if it's green. Like a dollar bill.

i saw a man and he danced with his wife,"I was by myself drinkin'. Chilled lonely wine. Then he walked in with some woman. Who's place was once mine. And she wore his ring on her finger. And the band began a song. I'd heard before. CHORUS:. I saw a man and he danced with his wife. How I wished he was dancing with me. 'Cause I remember before. When we danced on this floor. His eyes were only on me. Where did I go wrong. They were playin' our song. While I was cryin' all night long. I kept watchin' as they dance so divine. I kept hopin' kept on lookin'. But I couldn't catch his eye. Oh, then he got up and he saw me. But he just walked right on by. And danced with her. Chorus. Where did I go wrong. They were playin' our song. While I was cryin' all night long. Two weeks later. I heard a knock on my door. He's back. Just like all those good time before. Ah, then he kissed me. And he told me. I left her 'cause I love you,. So much more than I knew. Chorus. I saw a man and he danced with his wife."
i still haven't found what i'm looking for,"I have climbed the highest mountains. I have run through the fields. Only to be with you. Only to be with you. I have run, I have crawled. I have scaled these city walls. These city walls. Only to be with you. But I still haven't found what I'm looking for. But I still haven't found what I'm looking for. I have kissed honey lips. Felt the healing fingertips. It burned like fire. This burning desire. I have spoken with the tongue of angels. I have held the hand of the devil. It was warm in the night. I was cold as a stone. But I still haven't found what I'm looking for. But I still haven't found what I'm looking for. I believe in the Kingdom Come. Then all the colours will bleed into one. Bleed into one. But yes I'm still running. You broke the bonds. And you loosed the chains. Carried the cross and. All my shame. All my shame. You know I believe it. But I still haven't found what I'm looking for. But I still haven't found what I'm looking for. But I still haven't found what I'm looking for. But I still haven't found what I'm looking for"
i threw it all away,"I once held her in my arms,. She said she would always stay.. But I was cruel,. I treated her like a fool,. I threw it all away.. Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand,. And rivers that ran through ev'ry day.. I must have been mad,. I never knew what I had,. Until I threw it all away.. Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,. Love and only love, it can't be denied.. No matter what you think about it. You just won't be able to do without it.. Take a tip from one who's tried.. So if you find someone that gives you all of her love,. Take it to your heart, don't let it stray,. For one thing that's certain,. You will surely be a-hurtin',. If you throw it all away."
i walk alone,"There's a poet in me that remembers. And there's an honesty in every word. There's a dancer that feels her own beat. And there's a daughter who loves. There's a sinner in my bones. And there's a joker in my head. There are secrets in my soul. And there are sorries that I have never said. But there's a time to dance. Time to laugh, time to cry. Time to go, time to grieve. Time to come. Oh, I still got time to cope. Time to hope, time to play. Time to grow. But for now I gotta walk alone. I gotta walk alone. There's a tight rope that I've been walking. There's a daisy in my hair. There's a heartbreak that has taught me. Of what is raging. And there's only love and fear. There's a sadness in my confessions. There's a hyena howling at the moon. And there's a gypsy in me that keeps on roaming. And there's a an anger as I get closer to the truth. But there's a time to dance. Time to laugh, time to cry. Time to go, time to grieve. Time to come. Oh, I still got time to cope. Time to hope, time to play. Time to grow. But for now I gotta walk alone. I gotta walk alone. I gotta walk alone. I've got to walk alone. But for now I gotta walk alone. Oh, I hear the thunder but I won't back down. A soldier marches through the wrong side of town. I'm gonna love you until I bleed. And that's the story of me. I gotta walk alone. If they say time is everything. But there's a time to dance. Time to laugh, time to cry. Time to go, time to grieve. Time to come. Oh, I still got time to cope. Time to hope, time to play. Time to grow. But for now I gotta walk alone. I gotta walk alone. I gotta walk alone. I gotta walk alone. For now I gotta walk alone"
i walk on guilded splinters,"Some people think they jive me. But I know they must be crazy. They can't see their misfortune. Or else they're just too lazy. Je suie le grand zombie. With my yellow chaffen of choisen. Ain't afraid of no tomcat. And gonna fill my guts with poison. I walk through the fire. And I'll fly through the smoke. I wanna see my enemies. On the end of my rope. Walk on pins and neeedles. And I see what they can do. Walk on guilded splinters. With the king of the zulu. Come to me, get it, come, come. Walk on guilded splinters. Come to me, get it, come, come. Walk on guilded splinters. Till I burn up. Till I burn up. Till I burn up. Till I burn up. When I roll out in my coffin. Drink poison in my chalice.

i'll never stop loving you,One day I'll stop breathing. My heart will stop beating. I won't see your face again. This flesh and blood is weak. And life isn't ours to keep. Sometime it has to end. In time even memories fade away. With time you might live. To forgive and forget. The mistakes that I made. CHORUS:. I broke some promises. Sometimes I lied to you. But one thing will always be true. I'll never stop loving you. Fall from your grace. You'll never be replaced. God knows how hard I've tried. But it just ain't no use. I thought I could shake you loose. I'm still torn up inside. In time even memories fade away. With time you might live. To forgive and forget. The mistakes that I made. Chorus x 2.

And shadows take my love. and leave. I'm blowin' away. And shadows keep taking my love. and leaving me. I have past aside my foolish pride. Going down for the very last time. Cause I have searched this earth. And sailed the seas. But love is blind can not find me. Chorus x 2"

if i knew then,"The funny-face kid from down the street. Always very close at hand. He was just a cowboy, I was Lady Gran. But I don't think I would have shot him down. If I knew then what I know now. High school days and puppy love. Learning what it's all about. He was kinda akward, I was filling out. But I don't think that I would have played around. If I knew then what I know now. Too many years, too many chairs. Too many other things, too many men. Time and again I had to test my wings. No time for love, strings or wedding rings. A pretty young girl from Baltimore. Got herself a real good man. Once he was a cowboy who wanted Lady Gran. And I know that I would have made that now. If I knew then what I know now. Once he was a cowboy who wanted Lady Gran. And I know that I would have made that vow. If I knew then what I know now."

Well there's a bluebird. Flying home to Mobile. Camping in your cornfield for a while. Seems he just backed into a square meal. And he's in for the night. See that fine yellow moon a rising. Through the frost along the window pane. All of your shooting stars. Are in the wrong direction. Well I love you darling. But you just seem to change. Strut with me mama like you used to. Weather's kind of cold, but I don't care. Slip off your old red flannel nightgown. Getting to feel like falling with a fallin' fare"

Searching for a way to get to you. And I can't believe we're not together. I think we need an island"

not enough love in the world,"Sometimes I wonder where it is love goes. I don't know if even Heaven knows. I know we had dreams. That didn't quite come true. And now I'm not the one. Little boy, who's keeping you. (Chorus:). I was either standing in your shadow. Or blocking your light. Though I kept on trying. I could not make it right. For this girl. There's just not enough love in the world. I know people hurt you so bad. They don't know the damage they can do. And it makes me so sad. How we knock each other down. Just like children on a playground. Even after that ol' sun went down. (chorus). Oh, darling this is still a shady little town. And sometimes it's so hard to smile. For the world, for the camera. And still have something left. You don't have to prove nothing to nobody. Just take good care of yourself. I'm not easy to live with. I know that it's true. You're no picnic either, baby. That's one of the things. I love about you. A time will come around. When we need to settle down. Got to get off this merry-go-round. (chorus). For this girl.

one of us,"They passed me by, all of those great romances. You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances. My picture clear, everything seemed so easy. And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go. Now it's different, I want you to know. One of us is crying, one of us is lying. In her lonely bed. Staring at the ceiling. Wishing she was somewhere else instead. One of us is lonely, one of us is only. Waiting for a call. Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small. Wishing she had never left at all. I saw myself as a concealed attraction. I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action. Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving. That's how I started the show, one of us had to go. Now I've changed and I want you to know. One of us is crying, one of us is lying. In her lonely bed. Staring at the ceiling. Wishing she was somewhere else instead. One of us is lonely, one of us is only. Waiting for a call. Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small. Wishing she had never left at all. Never left at all"

song for you,"I've been so many places in my life and time. Sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme. I got out my life in stages. With ten thousand people watching. But we're alone now I'm singing this song. Singing this song for you. I know your image of me is what I hope to be. I've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see. There's no one more important to me. Darling can you please see through me. Cause we're alone now. And I'm singing this song for you. You taught me precious secrets of the truth. We're only nothing. You came out in front when I was hiding. But now I'm so much better. And if my words can come together. Listen to the melody. Cause my love is in there hiding. I love you in a place where there's no space or time. I love you for my life you are a friend of mine. And when my life is over. Remember when we were together. We were alone and I was singing this song for you. Singing this song, singing this song for you."

stars,"I was never one for saying what I really feel. Except tonight I'm bringing everything I know that's real. [Chorus:]. Stars they come and go. They come fast. They come slow. They go like the last light of the sun. All in a blaze. And all you see is glory. Hey, but it gets lonely here. When there's no one here to share. You can shake it all away if you will hear my story. Some people ask for fame like athlete's in a game. We break our collarbones and come up swinging. Some of us are downed some of us a crowned. And some are lost and never found but most have seen it all. They live there lives in sad cafe's and music halls. They always come up singing. Some make it when they're young. before the world has done its dirty job. Later on someone will say you've had your day. And now you must make way. But they will never know the pain of living. With a name you'd never own. Or the many years forgetting. What you know too well. That the ones who get the crown. Have been let down. Yet try to make amends. Without defending. Perhaps pretending. You never saw the eyes. Of grown men of twenty-five. That follow as you walk. And ask for autographs. Or kiss you on the cheek. But you never can believe. They really love you. Some make it when they're old. Perhaps they have a soul. They're not afraid to bear. Or perhaps there's nothing there. [Chorus]. But most have seen it all. They live there lives. In sad cafe's and music halls. They always come up singing. Singing. Singing. Singing"
starting over,"Spent a lifetime. Finally found someone. Gave him all that I had. In love till the dream was gone. I was losing myself. Out in the darkness alone. But the night made me strong. And I learned to let go. Time mends a heart. You turn the page somehow. Oh, there's no looking back. The hurt is behind you now. CHORUS:. Starting over again. From the second time around. Coming back to win. Starting over again. Take the first step. And let it begin. Starting over, starting over. Memories haunt you. Feelings you won't forget. Learn to live a lesson in love. Walk away without regrets. We'll never deny. Feelings your heart demands. Ah, find your way out. Just when you reach the end. Starting over again. No one's gonna count you out. When the heat is on. Starting over again. Gotta come back and turn it around. Starting over. Take another look inside. Where you always have a fight. Never dream of giving up, never. No looking back. Chorus."
still,"My heart cried out for you. Over an ocean. And your pain cried out for me. Across the way. You here, half dead. Numb to any emotion. 'Cause you were a prisoner. And I was a slave.

I never thought someone would ever see. Or make a prisoner of my heart. But like a warrior dressed in armor. You carved your name in it right from the start. You held my soul a hostage.

the fall,"Never even knew you. But I heard your note today. You talk about injustice. And how we look the other way. I knew full well your meaning. But my world just moves too fast. It's a shame about your future. It's a crime about your past. Was there no one who could save you. From the prison of each breath. Like Rapunzel in her tower. Isolation equals death. Was there no one who could rescue you. From the prison of your pain. Am I tougher or just lucky. Our fate didn't end the same. But my heart has run on empty. Since I heard the fuckin' news. We're a heartless, Godless culture. We'd walk nowhere in your shoes. For me it's 6:30 in the morning. And my moods as black as rain. I am 30 light years older. But I understand your pain. They'll all hate you. 'Cause you left them here. To struggle on their own. I'm sorry you saw no choice. 'Til death chilled you to the bone. But my heart has run on empty. Since I heard the fuckin' news. We're a heartless, Godless culture. We'd walk nowhere in your shoes. Well the good news if there's any. Is you ever lived at all. But our country kills its heroes. We just raise them for the fall"

the greatest song i ever heard,Now the greenest green I've ever seen. Was the grass on which you laid. And the bluest blue was in my eyes. When you said you couldn't stay. And the biggest lost I ever took. Was losing what we've begun. And the greatest song I ever heard. Was the one we never sung. Now the reddest red I've always said. Is the sunset coming down. Soon the blackest night that kills the light. Is the only thing around. And the downest down I ever been. Is when I knew my race was run. And the greatest song I ever heard. Was the one we never sung. Time will kill the pain they say. And we'll live to love another day. If you wanna win you got to play the game. Now the greatest break came on the day. We were standing in the rain. And the hardest hurt I've ever know. Was when you tried to ease my pain. And the longest day in history. Waiting till my crying's done. And the saddest song I ever heard. Was the one we finally sung.

There's just no let up. The live long night at day.. Ever since this world began. There ain't nothing sadder than. A one-man woman pining for the man that got away.."

this god forsaken day,"Read your note this mornin'.. 'Bye-Bye girl', that's all it said.. Glad I found it first,. before the kids got out of bed.. Baked a tray of muffins.. Hung some wet-wash out to dry.. By the time the kids got up,. I could look them in the eye.. You've gone away, you've gone away.. How will I get though the day?. This God-forsaken day.. Drank some bitter coffee.. Read your note ten times or more.. When I'd washed the dishes twice,. I got down and scrubbed the floor.. Empty chair at supper.. Everybodys actin' strange.. Food just gettin' cold.. Kids real quiet for a change.. You've gone away, you've gone away.. How will I get through the day?. This God-forsaken day.. Rain was fallin' hard. as I walked slowly up the stairs.. Pushed my tears back down. as I stood listenin'. to their prayers.. There's your empty pillow.. Your side's flat right to the wall.. Now's the time for private cryin'.. Now it hurts me. most of all.. You've gone away.. I turn off the light.. How will I get through the night?. This God-forsaken night..

those shoes,"Tell us what you’re gonna do tonight, mama.. There must be someplace you can go. In the middle of the tall drinks and the drama,. There must be someone you know.. God knows, you’re lookin’ good enough,. But you’re so smooth and the world’s so rough.. You might have somethin’ to loose.. Oh, no, pretty mama, what you gonna. Do in those shoes?. Got those pretty little straps around my ankles. Got those shiny little chains around my heart.. I got to have my independence. I don’t know just where to start.. Desperation in the singles bars. An’ all the gilrs in the fancy cars.. I can’t believe my reviews.. . Oh, no, I can’t do that,. Once I started wearin’ those shoes. They’re lookin’ at you, leanin’ on you. Tell you anything you want to hear. They give you tablets of love. They’re waiting for you. Got to score you. Handy with a shovel and so sincere. Ooh, they got the kid glove. . I just want someone to talk to. They just wanna get their hands on you. You get whatever you choose. Oh, no, I can’t do that,. Once you started wearin’ those shoes.. Oh no ! you can do that!.

thunderstorm,I could pass the evening here. Staring down into your eyes. Just forget there's a world somewhere outside. I kept my porch-light burning. So you could find my door. Felt so good to hear your footsteps. Walk across my bedroom floor. Chorus:. I knew that you were coming. By the thunderstorm last night. I swear I heard the north wind call your name. But a clear sky of blue stars. And the darling man you are. Makes it feel so good lying here next to you. This dusty town has needed rain. Like I've been needing you. So hold me tight as only you can do. By the light of just one candle. I feel your warm hands touching me. While our shadows move together. In the sweetest harmony. (chorus)(repeat twice). .
tonight i'll be staying here with you,"Throw my ticket out the window,. Throw my suitcase out there, too,. Throw my troubles out the door,. I don't need them any more. 'cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.. I should have left this town this morning. But it was more than I could do.. Oh, your love comes on so strong. And I've waited all day long. For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.. Is it really any wonder. The love that a stranger might receive.. You cast your spell and I went under,. I find it so difficult to leave.. I can hear that whistle blowin',. I see that stationmaster, too,. If there's a poor boy on the street,. Then let him have my seat. 'cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.. Throw my ticket out the window,. Throw my suitcase out there, too,. Throw my troubles out the door,. I don't need them any more. 'cause tonight I'll be staying here with you."

tougher than the rest,Well It's Saturday night you're all dressed up in blue. I been watching you awhile maybe you been watching me too. So somebody ran out left somebody's heart in a mess.

trail of broken hearts,"Here we are far beyond the distant sky. Seen all the world and how the story will be over. Through the snow and tainted mountains we have climbed. Now we have found the light that guides us over. Through the falling rain we travelled far and wide. And through the blackest darkness. Stars above shining bright. Through the sun and winter rain will fall. All our lives we all were waiting for a sign to call. We're walking hand in hand in dreams and endless time. How do we know when we will leave this life behind?. Stare at life through eyes of mine the hate the fear and the pain. There's a feeling held deep inside, when life you live is in vain. Life life you live is in vain. [REFRÃO]. Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday. We close your eyes to see the light of brighter days. And all alone we'll be where time can never heal. With the trail of broken hearts flying free. Once again we walk this lonely road. There are times that we were wading through the rain and cold. We're lost in memories of what we left behind. Relive the dreams, the endless screams of pain inside. Lives are filled with emptiness. The fear returns once again. Searching endlessly you can not. Drown your mind in the pain. Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday. We close your eyes to see the light of brighter days. And all alone we'll be where time can never heal. With the trail of broken hearts flying free. The last temptation will be all that's left for me. When I see those tears you cried. When I hear those lies you lied. When I see your creation falling down on me. Is this the reason to be?. Solos:. Sam/Herman/Sam. Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday. We close your eyes to see the light of brighter days. And all alone we'll be where time can never heal. With the trail of broken hearts flying free. The trail of broken hearts flying free. The Trail of broken hearts, flying free"
train of thought,"When you're talkin' in your sleep,. And the name that you whisper ain't mine. And I've finally faced the fact. That you're cheatin' on me one more time. When my anger starts to rumble. And my steam starts to rise. And the wheels keep turning. Faster as I think of all your lies. Oh that train of thought runnin' right on time. But it's off the track and I'm losing my mind. 'Cause the way you used me. Gonna drive me insane honey. Say you'll never leave me. For God's sake stop the train. Oh the camel back is broken. By the one extra straw added on. And a woman can't see reason. When her last ray of sunshine is gone. There's a finger on the trigger. And that locomotive sound. And I think how much I love you. And I turn the gun around. Oh that train of thought runnin' right on time. But it's off the track and I'm losing my mind. And you hold me the last time. As I try to explain, honey. Don't feel bad about me. I just had to stop this train. Gotta get off, gotta get off. Gotta get off, gotta get off (woo-woo). Gotta get off, gotta get off. This train of thought (woo-woo). Gotta get off, gotta get off (woo-woo). Gotta get off, gotta get off. The train of thought (woo-woo)."

And here we'll stay. Until it's time for you to go. Yes, we're different worlds apart. We're not the same. We laughed and played at the start. Like in a game. You could have stayed outside my heart. But in you came. And here you'll stay. Until it's time for you to go. Don't ask why of me. Don't ask how. Don't ask forever. Love me, love me now. This love of mine had no beginning. It has no end.

Sheâ€™s help you out if she had the time, but your Dad is sad and your Motherâ€™s crying. Where do you go, I donâ€™t know. So youâ€™re down on your knees and you hope that helps. You just canâ€™t think of nothinâ€™ else. How do you pray and what do you say, let me know right away. God show me the way, where do you go, I donâ€™t know."
who you gonna believe,"I remember every word you said. We can't go on this way. Should I go or stay. But I've given you everything. That one woman could give a man. So when you gonna recognize and realize. What we had. (Now tell me). Who you gonna believe, her or me?. What's it gonna be, Who you gonna believe?. Before your heart shatters, love is all that matters. You put me through that lover's game over and over. Someday someone's gonna put you through the same. Lover to lover, I hope you don't find out too late. I hope you never have to feel the pain. 'Cause if you lose the love you took for granted. That you could never appreciate. Who you gonna believe, her or me?. Who's it gonna be, who you gonna believe?. Before you make up your mind. You better take some time. What about me, don't you think I need a man here. Standing by my side. And what about you, you need a woman to hold you. Through those cold and lonely nights. Oh, what about us, we belong together for ever and ever.. Oh, I'll be there if you should ever need me. Oh, I know everything will work out fine, just believe. Oh, I know cause we've been through this a million times. Keep on believing well I hope you don't find out too late. Hope you never have to feel the pain. Cause if you lose the love you took for granted. That you could never appreciate, after all this time. Who you gonna believe, her or me?. Who's it gonna be, who you gonna believe?. Who are you fooling. Well you're not fooling me no. Who you gonna believe, you can risk it all. With someone else's world. Wondering if it's love. Baby oh baby, you should know by now. You can believe in me."
why was i born?,"Why was I born. Tell me why I am living. What do I give. Or what am I'm giving. What do I want. Anything I can not hope for. What can I hope for. I wish I knew. [Chorus:]. Why do I try. To draw you near me. Honey tell me why do I cry. Cause you're never gonna hear me. I'm a poor fool. But what can I do, I do. Why was I born to love you. [Chorus]"
will you wait for me,I'll go for hours without saying a word. that don't mean there's nothing on my mind. if I had the words down in poetry. then you know I'd write the perfect line. What I'm giving you is less than you deserve. and I know that it hurt. If love is worth all the pain in the world. Then it's sure worth the fight. Nobody said that it was easy to love. I know you wanna run your not the only one. Feels like I'm headed down a dead end street. But feels not half as strong as destiny. Darlin wait for me. Will you wait for me. My arm was rusty and my vision is weak. But still I see the path to you. I know you're praying for a miracle babe. And I'm sayin' that same prayer too. The way you look at me. its so obvious. I'm the only one. If we lived in love for a thousand years. It still wouldn't be enough. Nobody said that it was easy to love. I know you wanna run your not the only one. Feels like I'm headed down a dead end street. But feels not half as strong as destiny. Darlin wait for me. Will you wait for me. Wait for me. Oh OOh oh. Nobody said that it was easy to love. I know you wanna run your not the only one. Feels like I'm headed down a dead end street. But feels not half as strong as destiny. Darlin wait for me. Will you wait for me. Darlin wait for me. Will you wait for me?
with or without you,I don't want to live without you. God it hurts to be alone. But livin' with you or without you. Cut its my poor heart to the bone. 'Cause my heart gets broken everytime we fall. This only so much left unshattered. This time I know my back's against the wall. But truth is the only thing that matters anymore. I'm scared in a crowd of people. And you're afraid to be alone. I have prayed you'd be beside me. I guess I'm meant to stand alone. 'Cause our hearts to get broken. Every time we fall. They're beaten down and battered. You're so afraid you don't deserve it all. But you're not the only thing. That matters anymore. How can I live without you in my heart. When I walk out this time. It'll tear me apart. My heart gets broken. Everytime we fall. There's only so long. I can fake it. 'Cause you let me go Babe. We could have had it all. We had a chance. I thought we'd make it. 'Cause I gave my heart. You had to break it. God give me strength. I just can't take it anymore

working girl,"Come Monday morning. You see her waitin'. On the street for her ride. In an hour she'll be working. In a tower made of steel in the sky. She's just a pawn in the struggle. In a never-ending fight to survive. Mama had to play someone else's game. You learn to keep it inside. CHORUS:. Working girl, livin' in a man's world. Working girl, you gotta take a stand girl. The boss checks out her body. She's on the phone tellin' his lies. Run and get the coffee. And a smile hides the rage in her eyes. Tonight she's searching for a reason. As she's walking home alone in the rain. Mama had to play someone else's game. Someday she's breakin' the chain. Chorus. Nobody knows the dreams. She dares to dream. The plans she had made. Or the times she has prayed inside. Or what tears at her pride. Chorus."

young and pretty,"Come from the suburbs into the city. They say you can make it. If you're young and pretty. Dreams must be tall. Ain't it a pity. But they say you can make it. If you're young and pretty. So I sit inside my dressing room. Waiting for the band to play. And I wonder what is left to loose. Where is anyone, any way. Outside a neon, face from exhaustion. Screaming with promise of what's inside. But nobody's watching. I go for the money, my wallet's a liar. Nothing inside cause the world is on fire. So I give them that old routine. No one listens, any way. When I fight for what it means. God I wish I had someone here today. So I give them that old routine. No one listens, any way. When I fight for what it means. God I wish I had someone here today. Come from the suburbs into the city. They say you can make it. If you're young and pretty. Come from the sidelines into the city. They say you can make it. If you're young and pretty. They say you can make it. If you're young and pretty"

But tonight I just can’t tell right from wrong. Let me be yours until tomorrow. Let me be yours until tomorrow. Give me one night of your life. Just be mine till the dawn. Tomorrow the real world. Will come crashing down on me. I know I must lose you. That’s the way it has to be. But tonight I see no boundaries. So I beg you before my chance is gone. Let me be yours until tomorrow. Let me be yours until tomorrow. Give me one night of your life. So I can go on. Till the dawn’s intrusion. Starts us with illusion. Make believe you’re mine, love. This is not goodbye, love. All I ask is one night. Till the morning sun light. Won’t you stay here in my arms. And baby. Let me be yours until tomorrow. Let me be yours until tomorrow. Let me be yours until tomorrow. Let me be yours until tomorrow"
