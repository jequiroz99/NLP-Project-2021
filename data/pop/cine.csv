above me,When i look at the stars they shine of your eyes.. The sky it burns bright with your presence tonight.. Yet your so above me and i cannot fly.. To the angel above me i long to be with. with.. If i was to walk till time saw no end.. If i was to climb till the air was too thin.. I could not find a picture fit the frame.. As perfect as you.. As perfect as you.. You showed me life and lived nothing less.. This is all above me.. I'll take my time you memory is bliss.. The angel above me.. When i look at the stars they shine of your eyes.. The sky it burns bright with your presence tonight.. Yet your so above me and i cannot fly.. To the angel above me i long to be with. with.. Angel above me.. To look at the mountains vast and great.. Is one step above in seeing your face.. To look at the stars for they lead the way.. To the angel above.. If i was to walk till time saw no end.. If i was to climb till the air was too thin.. I could not find a picture fit the frame.. As perfect as you.. As perfect as you.. You showed me life and lived nothing less.. Cause you're so above me.. I'll take my time you memory is bliss.. The angel above me.. When i look at the stars they shine of your eyes.. The sky it burns bright with your presence tonight.. Yet your so above me and i cannot fly.. To the angel above me i long to be with. with.
