a greater treasure than a friend,"So far away. How did I lose my way. Even though we're worlds apart, you were always in my heart everyday.. You can travel far and wide. Fly across the blue moon in the sky. Sail through the clouds to places you have never been. You could wish a thousand times. Find the gold that pirates left behind. But you'll never find a greater treasure than a friend. Let's not pretend. That pixie dust could end. Every single tear that falls. Any problem big or small. You can mend. You can soar to Neverland. Fly right through the water fall and dance. See the colors change before your eyes. And let them live. Float above the mountain top. Watch the fireflies light up the night. There is one everywhere you turn. So please believe in me. Cause I believe in you. You're the magic in my life. That has stones that sparkles bright. Through and through. Travel far and wide. Fly across the blue moon in the sky. Sail through the clouds to places you have never been. You could wish a thousand times. Find the gold that pirates left behind.

"baby, it's cold outside","I really can't stay - but baby it's cold outside. I've got to go away - but baby it's cold outside. This evening has been - been hoping that you'd drop in. So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice. My mother will start to worry - beautiful, what's your hurry. My father will be pacing the floor - just listen to the fireplace roar. So really I'd better scurry - beautiful, please don't hurry. But maybe just a half a drink more -. put some records on while I pour. The neighbors might think - baby, it's bad out there. Say, what's in this drink - no cabs to be had out there. I wish I knew how - your eyes are like starlight now. To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell. I ought to say no, no, no, sir - mind if I move in closer. At least I'm gonna say that I tried -. what's the sense in hurting my pride. I really can't stay - baby don't hold out. Ohh, but it's cold outside. I simply must go - but baby, it's cold outside. The answer is no - but baby, it's cold outside. This welcome has been - how lucky that you dropped in. So nice and warm - look out the window at that storm. My sister will be suspicious - gosh, your lips look delicious. My brother will be there at the door - waves upon a tropical shore. My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - oh your lips are delicious. But maybe just cigarretes more - never such a blizzard before. I've got to get home - but baby you'll freeze out there. Say, lend me a coat - it's up to your knees out there. You've really been grand - I thrill when you touch my hand. But don't you see - how can you do this thing to me. There's bound to be talk tomorrow - think my lifelong sorrow. At least there will be plenty implied - if you got pneumonia and died. I really can't stay - get over that old out. Ohh, baby it's cold outside"

I’m gonna make this final, this dream is just a touch away. You can’t deny it nothin’s gonna stop me now. It’s not gonna be a dream. Bridge:. There’s no ifs, buts, or anywhos. Please make my dreams come true. Chorus:. I’m gonna unlock the door. I’m gonna scream some more. I’m gonna make the night last forever. Nothing’s gonna stop me at this point of time. I’m gonna sing some more ‘til my lungs are sore. I’m gonna make this final, this dream is just a touch away. You can’t deny it nothin’s gonna stop me now. It’s not gonna be a dream"
