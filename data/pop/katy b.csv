crying for no reason,"I pushed all my problems to the back of my mind. Then they surfaced in my dreams, they come alive. I sweep all my issues. To somewhere I can't find. In hope that I'll forget. But there's just so many times. Why can't I be strong. And just confront all my fears?. When my fear is hurting you. By being sincere. But how many more days can I run?. How many years?. Emotions flooding. And I was so soon and so clear. Crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down. I felt strong but am I breaking now?. Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep. I made promises I could not keep. 'Cause I never faced all the pain I caused. Now the pain is hitting me full force. I pushed all my problems to the back of my brain. A darkness deep inside where. I just can't find my way. How can I walk with a smile?. Get on with my day. When I deceived myself pretending it's all okay. I tried my best to hold it all together, I know. The strings have worn away and now I'm all exposed. I try and hide it all away on top of the shelf. I can lie to everyone but not to myself. Crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down. I felt strong but am I breaking now?. Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep. I made promises I could not keep. 'Cause I never faced all the pain I caused. Now the pain is hitting me full force. Forgive me now. 'Cause I said that I'll be there for you. Care for you. I let you down, I walked away. 'Cause there were things I couldn't say to you, say to you. I'm breakin' now. I burned some bridges down. There must be some way out. The voices speak so loud. Will you forgive me now?. I burned some bridges down. There must be some way out. The voices speak so loud. Will you forgive me now?. Crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down. I felt strong but am I breaking now?. Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep. I made promises I could not keep. 'Cause I never faced all the pain I caused. Now the pain is hitting me full force"

crying for no reason,"I pushed all my problems to the back of my mind. Then they surfaced in my dreams, they come alive. I sweep all my issues. To somewhere I can't find. In hope that I'll forget. But there's just so many times. Why can't I be strong. And just confront all my fears?. When my fear is hurting you. By being sincere. But how many more days can I run?. How many years?. Emotions flooding. And I was so soon and so clear. Crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down. I felt strong but am I breaking now?. Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep. I made promises I could not keep. 'Cause I never faced all the pain I caused. Now the pain is hitting me full force. I pushed all my problems to the back of my brain. A darkness deep inside where. I just can't find my way. How can I walk with a smile?. Get on with my day. When I deceived myself pretending it's all okay. I tried my best to hold it all together, I know. The strings have worn away and now I'm all exposed. I try and hide it all away on top of the shelf. I can lie to everyone but not to myself. Crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down. I felt strong but am I breaking now?. Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep. I made promises I could not keep. 'Cause I never faced all the pain I caused. Now the pain is hitting me full force. Forgive me now. 'Cause I said that I'll be there for you. Care for you. I let you down, I walked away. 'Cause there were things I couldn't say to you, say to you. I'm breakin' now. I burned some bridges down. There must be some way out. The voices speak so loud. Will you forgive me now?. I burned some bridges down. There must be some way out. The voices speak so loud. Will you forgive me now?. Crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down. I felt strong but am I breaking now?.

disappear,"o sad that we have lost all our innocence. Something that was pure is now covered in red. Tainted by the role to become a woman. I thought that it'll cure. So why am I still walking, towards you?. Right, left, my feet are. But how can I change direction. When you smile at me, I'm infected.... Now should we lie to keep each other here. Or tell the truth and burn. Are you the man I thought you were. Or is there more to learn. And this would be unfair to tell you that. The whole of me is here. 'Cause I woke up one day. To find that I have disappeared. I have disappeared. I have disappeared. I have disappeared.... The way that we would die. I look into your eye. I wouldn't get a dime. Now I don't see the fire. Tainted by the role to become the man. You let me where you can. Like you didn't give a damn.... It's mad. How something so real. Could be so conditional. But how can I change direction. When you smile at me, I'm infected.... Now should we lie to keep each other here. Or tell the truth and burn. Am I the girl you thought I was. Or is there more to learn?. And this would be unfair to tell you that. The whole of me is here. I woke up one day. To find that I have disappeared. I have disappeared. I have disappeared. I have disappeared.... Now today we have turned out just fine. But I'm scared about tomorrow. Where I must store in my sorrow.... If it's not here to taste the pride. To live, to feel. Is it real?. Is it real?. I woke up one day. To find that I was gone. Where is the fun?. Where did our hearts go?. I can't find you, no..."

And friends are calling ""yoo hoo"". Come on, it's lovely weather. For a sleigh ride together with you. Our cheeks are nice and rosy. And comfy cozy are we. We're snuggled up together. Like two birds of a feather would be. Let's take that road before us. And sing a chorus or two. Come on, it's lovely weather. For a sleigh ride together with you. Our cheeks are nice and rosy. And comfy cozy are we. We're snuggled up together. Like two birds of a feather would be. Let's take that road before us. And sing a chorus or two. Come on, it's lovely weather. For a sleigh ride together with you. Jingle bells, jingle bells. Jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride. In a one horse open sleigh. Jingle bells, jingle bells. Jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride. In a one horse open sleigh"
stay down,"There's a bitterness in the air. When did you lose all your care. I don't wanna hear you speak no more. 'Cause every word leaves my heart reward. Another chance to tell me that you're right. I try and bury away all your spite. You keep on saying that you want to stay. But something's telling me you're afraid of being lonely. Faced with all your issues. With no one to pick up the pieces. To tell you everything's alright. And have it thrown back in my face. You wanna stay down so you won't fall. Lying on the ground. So nothing at all can make you weak. I will stay in the dark for you to take it out on me. Yeah!. Thinking why do you want me around. You get defensive and just shot me down. Maybe you just need a hand to hold. I'd touch you but you're freezing cold. Why don't you let yourself be happy here. Make that effort, come on, be sincere. 'Cause you don't mean all of the things you say. Why do you let yourself get in the way?. Your freedom. Emancipate yourself from this whole world you got yourself into. This time you've gone way too far. Trying to hurt me 'cause you can. You wanna stay down so you won't fall. Lying on the ground. So nothing at all can make you weak. I will stay in the dark for you to take it out on me. Yeah?. Walking further into the darkness. (Can you hear me calling you?). You say you just don't know how hard it is. (To walk in your shoes). Oh, but don't you want to get better?. Get out of this big black hole. The one you dug yourself into. And devoured all of your soul. You want to stay down so you won't fall. Lying on the ground. So nothing at all can make you weak. I will stay in the dark for you to take it out on me"

still,"We chose this simple life. My love was way too much for you to bear. It left our world to end right there. But I still hear you whispering my name. Surely there's a part unchanged. How could you be so far away?. When I still see your face like it was only yesterday. And although you're out of sight. Would you still be the same. If I was left for you tonight?. Still. Still on my mind now, still. You still know how to make me feel. How come these wounds won't heal?. You're still on my mind now, still. Now how could I compete. With something bigger than the both of us?. Why were we not good enough. We gave it all and watched it burn away. But the ashes still remain. I wonder what it is you say. When you close your eyes. What do you ask for when you pray. What do you need to sooth your soul. Why can't I find something else to make sense of it all. Still. Still on my mind now, still. You still know how to make me feel. How come these wounds won't heal?. You're still on my mind now. I can't let go, don't wanna let go. I can't let go, don't wanna let go. Still. Still on my mind now, still. You still know how to make me feel. How come these wounds won't heal?. You still have the power. Still, when we walked away. I thought we'd fade to gray. Thinking if you feel the same. If I don't want to heal. Why won't this heart beat still?. You're still on my mind now, still. You're still on my mind now, still"
story of my life,"Written in these walls are the stories. That I can't explain. I leave my heart open. But it stays right here empty for days. He told me in the morning. He don't feel the same about us in his bones. It seems to me that when I die. These words will be written on my stone. And I'll be gone gone tonight. The ground beneath my feet is open wide. The way that I've been holdin' on so tight. With nothing in between. The story of my life I take him home. I drive all night to keep him warm and time. Is frozen. The story of my life I give him hope. I spend his love. Until he's broke inside. The story of my life. Written on these walls. Are the colors that I can't change. I leave my heart open. But it stays right here in its cage. I know that in the morning now. I see us in the light upon a hill. Althought I am broken. My heart is untamed, still. And I'll be gone gone tonight. The fire beneath my feet is burning bright. The way that I've been holdin' on so tight. With nothing in between. The story of my life I take him home. I drive all night to keep him warm and time. Is frozen. The story of my life I give him hope. I spend his love. Until he's broke inside. The story of my life. And I've been waiting for this time to come around. But baby running after you. Is like chasing the clouds. The story of my life I take him home. I drive all night to keep him warm and time. Is frozen. The story of my life I give him hope. I spend his love. Until he's broke inside. The story of my life. The story of my life. The story of my life. The story of my life"
tumbling down,"[Verse 1:]. Loving me right. You fill my dreams with sweetness all through the night. Until the sky turns red. I'm stuck, I'm sugar craving. A honey pool I bathe in. Rolling around. Our love is shining like a jewel on a crown. I'll place it on your head. Fit for a ceremony. Say I'm your one and only. [Pre-Chorus:]. It's so natural, magical, wonderful. Scrambling for what you give, I want it all. And every day a little more, I feel the fall. I feel the fall. [Chorus:]. I'm tumbling down. This wall that I built falls down before me. Crumbling down. Say it's the beginning of a beautiful story. I'm tumbling, crumbling. Right down to love, to love. [Verse 2:]. Down on my knees. You got my temperature 100 degrees. My t-shirt's soaking wet. You bring the heat, the fever. My girl said you'd hurt me but I won't believe her. Nothing before. Could ever come between this love I adore. There's nothing she could say. To shock me or surprise me. I'll keep your secrets, be the lock on your diary. [Pre-Chorus]. [Chorus]. [Bridge:]. In your arms, a heaven tailored just for me. A state so calm, yet so full of energy. Brick by brick, you take my pry, give it away. Caught me quick when said I was here to stay. I'm tumbling down. I'm tumbling down. I'm tumbling down. [Chorus]"

why you always here,"Finally I found my sense. Free from walking next. And then there you... appear. You touched upon my sleeve. Then you said follow me. But I sensed it weren't there. Can't enter golden times. You predict into my mind. Throwin' away there easy as I do. I've seen your game depart. So try on her I'm bored of you. Why you always here. Complaining in my ear. Saying I could give you so much more. Why do you persist. To posses my kiss. When she's the one your heart beats for. [x2]. [?] I can't keep up. With your indecisive touch. It's too late to make up your mind. I left a while ago. Since then I'm much less cold. You chose her to keep you warm at night. Never asked for your attention. So why you think I owe you something?. I've seen your games before. So give them all to her. I'm bored of you. Why you always here. Complaining in my ear. Saying I could give you so much more. Why do you persist. To posses my kiss. When she's the one your heart beats for. [x2]. Is it because my life is better than hers. My kiss is sweeter than hers. My touch is softer than hers, oh. I bet you thought that you could have me instead of her. But you can give it all to her. Why you always here. Complaining in my ear. Saying I could give you so much more. Why do you persist. To posses my kiss. When she's the one your heart beats for. [x4]. Heart beats for. She's the one your heart beats for. I could give you so.."
