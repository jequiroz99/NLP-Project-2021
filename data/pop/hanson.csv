save me,"Loving you like I never have before. I'm needing you just to open up that door. If begging you might somehow turn the tides. Than tell me too I've got to get this off my mind. I never thought I'd be speaking these words. I never thought I'd need to say. Another day alone is more than I can take. Chorus. Won't you save me?. Saving is what I need. I just wanna be by your side. Won't you save me?. I don't wanna to be. Just drifting through the sea of life. Won't you.... Listen please baby don't walk out that door. I'm on my knees you're all I'm living for. I never thought I'd be speaking these words. Haven't gonna find a way. Another day alone is more than I can take. Chorus. Won't you save me?. Saving is what I need. I just wanna be by your side. Won't you save me?. But I don't wanna to be. Just drifting through the sea of life. Suddenly the sky is falling. Could it be it's too late for me?. If I never said ""I'm sorry"". Then I'm wrong, yes I'm wrong. Then I hear my spirit calling. Wondering if she's longing for me. And then I know that I can't live without her. Chorus. Won't you save me?. Saving is what I need. I just wanna be by your side. Won't you save me?. I don't wanna to be. Just drifting through the sea of life. Won't you save me?. Won't you save me?. Won't you save me?"
mmmbop,"You have so many relationships in this life. Only one or two will last. You go through all the pain and strife. Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast. And they're gone so fast.

penny & me,"Cigars in the summertime under the sky by the light,. I can feel you read my mind,. I can see it in your eyes,. Under the moon as it plays,. Like music every line,. There's a rug with bleeding dye under the fan in the room,. Where the passion's burning high,. By the chair with the leopard skin under the light,. It's always Penny and me tonight (Say OhOh).. On the plane step up with both my feet,. Riding in seat number 3 on a flight to NYC,. Got my bean in a coffee cup next to my seat,. Catch the view and another good book to read,. Sending me home on the friendly skies,. Missin' her eyes,. It's always Penny and me tonight,. 'Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down,. Turn the radio up, and push the pedal to the ground,. And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies,. Close our eyes, pretend to fly,. It's always Penny and me tonight, (Say OhOh NoNoNo). Staring at a million city lights,. But it's still Penny and I all alone beneath the sky,. Feel the wind brushing slowly by,. If I could soar I would try, to take these wings and fly,. Away to where the leaves turn red,. But no matter where I am instead,. Singin' Along to Feelin' Alright,. We're makin' it by in the pink moonlight,. It's always Penny and me tonight,. Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down,. Turn the radio up, push the pedal to the ground,. And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies,. Close our eyes, pretend to fly, (Say OhOh). Close our eyes pretend to fly,. It's always Penny and me tonight,. Penny likes to get away,. And drown her pain, in lemonade,. And Penny dreams of rainy days,. And nights up late by the fireplace. And aimless conversations bout' the better days,. Singin' along to Feeling Alright, yeah,. We're makin' it by in the pink moonlight,. It's always Penny and me tonight,. Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down,. Turn the radio up, push the pedal to the ground,. And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies,. Close our eyes pretend to fly. It's always Penny and me tonight, (Sing OhOh). Penny and me tonight,. Penny and me tonight,. Just Penny and me tonight."
if only,"Every single time I see you I start to feel this way. Makes me wonder if I'm ever gonna feel this way again. There's a picture that's hanging in the back of my head. I see it over and over. I wanna hold you and love you in my arms and then. I wanna need you 'cause I need to be with you 'til the end. Then I hear myself reply you're got to hold it in. This time, tonight. (Chorus). If only I had the guts to feel this way. If only you'd look at me and want to stay. If only I could take you in my arms and say. I won't go 'cause I need you. I sit here, waiting, wondering, hoping, that I'll make this right. 'Cause all I think about is your hands. Your face, and all these lonely nights. There's a feeling that's screaming in the back of my head. Saying over and over. I wanna hold you and love you in my arms and then. I wanna need you 'cause I need to be with you till the end. Then I hear myself reply she'll never let you in. This time, tonight. If only I had the guts to feel this way. If only you'd look at me and want to stay. If only I could take you in my arms and say. Welll,I won't go 'cause I need you. Please don't go 'cause I need you now. I wanna hear you and say. It'll always be this way. We will be hand in hand for every night and every day. I want to scream and shout. 'Cause I'm losing and doubt. And all I care about is you and me and us and now. If only I had the guts to feel this way. If only you'd look at me and want to stay. If only I could take you in my arms and say. I won't go 'cause I need you. Please don't go 'cause I need you now"

Look at, look at, look at what we're doing. (Repeat Chorus). Dark clouds all around, lightning, rain pouring down. Waiting for the bright light to break through. Face down on the ground.

Where's the right in, all of our fighting. Look at what we're doing. (Repeat Chorus). Won't you, won't you give it up"

Maybe I am lying still inside my shell. ?Cause I keep making waves and falling victim to the swell. Won't you save me from myself"

Past the dollar shows for the bleeding hearts. You've used me up. Down to the last drop. But I'm more than what you thought I'd be. You thought you had a hold on me. You thought you had a hold and its feelin' good.. You thought you had control of me. Should have gotten out when you thought I would. You thought you had control of me. But you never had your hold on me. You never had control of me. You never had control of me, control of me"

weird,"Isn't it weird. Isn't it strange.. Even though we're just two strangers on this runaway train. We're both trying to find a place in the sun. We've lived in the shadows, but doesn't everyone. Isn't it strange how we all feel a little bit weird. sometimes. Isn't it hard. Standing in the rain.. You're on the verge of going crazy and your heart's in pain.

Waiting for a sign.. Hoping that my luck will change.. Reaching for a hand that can understand,. Someone who feels the same.. When you live in a cookie cutter world. Being different is a sin.. So you don't stand out.. And you don't fit in. Weird.. Sitting on the side. Waiting for a sign.. Hoping that my luck will change.. Reaching for a hand that can understand,.

a song to sing,Good-bye four leaf clovers. Hello gone awry. Don't cry the fight ain't over. Unless you let it pass you by. I'm looking for a song to sing. I'm looking for a friend to borrow. I'm looking for my radio. So I might find a heart to follow. I've never been just longing for your loving. I've never been just wearing down to nothing. I've never been just looking for a reason. So that maybe you'd be thinking of me. All that I have found in reason. Is reason just to not believe. When all that you're left is treason. It's treason just to let it be. I'm looking for a song to sing. I'm looking for a friend to borrow. I'm looking for my radio. So that I might find a heart to follow. I've never been just longing for your loving. I've never been just wearing down to nothing. I've never been just looking for a reason. So that maybe you'd be thinking of me. Blue yonder dreams and second hand shoes. You're so far gone that you live to lose. And it's too late to go home all alone. You're the tar in that old cigar. And the worn out cable on a cable car. And you're too tired to admit you've got to choose. I'm looking for a song to sing. I'm looking for a friend to borrow. I'm looking for my radio. So I might find a heart to follow. I've never been just longing for your loving. I've never been just wearing down to nothing. I've never been just looking for a reason. So that maybe you'd be thinking of me
man from milwaukee,"It started at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere. Sitting beside me was a man with no hair. From the look on his face and the size of his toes. He comes from a place that nobody knows. Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating. Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky. Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating. If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why. I've been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee. He's been talking too long on his yellow walkie talkie. He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky. He says they'll come get him, come get him some day. He says where he's from is called Albertane. There they use more than 10% of the brain. But you couldn't tell it from they way they behave. They run around in underwear and they never shave. Or maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating. Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky. Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating. If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why. This is Mother Bird calling Baby Bird. Baby Bird come in, come in Baby Bird For the love of Pete come in!. This is Baby Bird...sorry I was watching Court TV. Do you copy? Do you copy?. Of course we copy...24 hours a day...in color. You wouldn't believe me if I told you the rest. The man sitting by me who was barely dressed. Flew off to Milwaukee or perhaps Albertane. And left me at the bus stop just barely sane. I've been sitting here too long thinkin' about Milwaukee. I've been talking too long on my yellow walkie talkie. I'm talking to Mars you may think I'm wacky. I know they'll come get me, come get me someday. I know they'll come get me and take me away. I know they'll come get me, come get me someday. If not tomorrow then maybe today. ."

Only just to believe. ‘Cause I want to believe. I want to believe. I will believe. I’d love to believe. I can believe in something. I will believe. I’d love to believe. I can’t believe in nothing"
bittersweet,"So much for just you and me. We gave that life up more than once. The simple things that used to be, so easy just the two of us. Change can be bittersweet. The sweeter things, I'd never see without you. June bugs and pickup trucks is the life I lead these days. And sometimes it gets to be too much. I would never change it. And in everything I see your face. The beauty of a mother's grace. I Love you. Everyday people just fall apart. For no other reason. Than one stops trying and one stops loving anymore. Who will fight for us when the seams start coming out. I will. 'Cause I love you. Looking forward to growing old and watching you turn grey. And if you don't mind I would like to go first. Because without you I wouldn't live a day. N everything you've given me a life I could have never dreamed. I love you. I love you. I love you more. I love you"

What is that supposed to mean?. What am I supposed to be?. I pull my way up through this crowd. To find your body crushed on the ground. It's so obvious, why couldn't you see?. That you can't go high flying without a pair of high-flyer wings. Little one's broken lying on the ground. Trying to get up 'till his last breath out. Wings are strewn everywhere, there's blood all around. 'Cause even angels die, but that light just fades. It's so sad, but he'd be so proud. Broken angel you've got to learn to fly.

Goode. He never ever learned to read or write so well. But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell. Go Go. Go Johnny Go Go. Go. Johnny B. Goode. He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack. And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track. Oh, the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade. Playing to the rhythm that the drivers made. People passing by would stop and say. Oh my that little country boy could play. Go Go. Go Johnny Go Go. Go. Johnny B. Goode. His mama told him someday he would be a man. And he would be the leader of a big old band. Many people coming from miles around. To hear him play his music when the sun go down. Maybe someday his name would be in lights. Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight. Go Go. Go Johnny Go Go. Go. Johnny B.

lonely boy,"He's looking in the spring,. Looking for another lonely heart,. Trying to find the answer. Trying to find the missing part.. It's flown and the wind starts blowin'. It's going inside his heart, he's all alone.. And his heart is gone.. Chorus:. Is there no one who could love a lonely boy?. And at the end of the day,. There is no one to hold his hand.. Is there no one who could love a lonely boy?. And at the end of the day,. There is no one to understand. (End of chorus.). He's looking in the spring,. looking for another place to start.. Trying to find the switch,. And turn on the light in the dark.. He found the answer, that you can prevail.. Through the darkest nights, coldest winters,. Through the fires of hell.. (Chorus...). Is there someone who could love a lonely boy?. Love me, hold me, is there no one?. Is there no one? Is there no one?. (Chorus twice). Is there no one who could love a lonely boy?. Whose heart is gone. Is there no one?. . Corrigido por Petit Ange"
look at you,"Look at you baby. Standing in the shadows wondering what I'm doing here. Wishing something would happen, maybe I could disappear. She walks in with that look in her eye. Somehow she doesn't even have to try. Just kick off your shoes, get on the floor. This is what we came here for. Oooooh, you've got to break it down. You've got to get it out. Just get on the floor. Everybody wonders when they look at you. Everybody wonders what you're gonna do. You got it all wrapped up you do. Everybody wonders when they look at, look at you. Look at you baby, look at you baby. In the middle of the dance floor lights shinin' in my face. Twistin', shoutin' there was no doubt people dancing all over the place. Out of the corner of my eye she said why don't you come and give it a try. Get on the floor, just kick off your shoes. You ain't got a thing to lose. Oooooh, you've got to break it down. It's time to get it out. Just get on the floor. (Repeat Chorus). Look at you, look at you baby. Look at you, look at you baby. Look at you, look at you baby. Ooooh, Whoooooa, Whoooooa, baby.

This is what we're waiting for. Oooooh, you've got to break it down. You've got to get it out. Just get on the floor.."

There's a rug with bleeding dye under the fan in the room,. Where the passion's burning high,. By the chair with the leopard skin under the light,. It's always Penny and me tonight (Say OhOh).. On the plane step up with both my feet,. Riding in seat number 3 on a flight to NYC,. Got my bean in a coffee cup next to my seat,. Catch the view and another good book to read,. Sending me home on the friendly skies,. Missin' her eyes,. It's always Penny and me tonight,. 'Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down,. Turn the radio up, and push the pedal to the ground,. And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies,. Close our eyes, pretend to fly,. It's always Penny and me tonight, (Say OhOh NoNoNo). Staring at a million city lights,. But it's still Penny and I all alone beneath the sky,. Feel the wind brushing slowly by,. If I could soar I would try, to take these wings and fly,. Away to where the leaves turn red,. But no matter where I am instead,. Singin' Along to Feelin' Alright,. We're makin' it by in the pink moonlight,. It's always Penny and me tonight,. Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down,. Turn the radio up, push the pedal to the ground,. And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies,. Close our eyes, pretend to fly, (Say OhOh). Close our eyes pretend to fly,. It's always Penny and me tonight,. Penny likes to get away,. And drown her pain, in lemonade,. And Penny dreams of rainy days,. And nights up late by the fireplace. And aimless conversations bout' the better days,. Singin' along to Feeling Alright, yeah,. We're makin' it by in the pink moonlight,. It's always Penny and me tonight,. Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down,. Turn the radio up, push the pedal to the ground,. And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies,. Close our eyes pretend to fly.

soldier,"Can I hear the story about the one legged soldier please. And can you tell me the story of the soldier please. One more time or I'll knock your nose off.

Well his favorite of all the toys were the tin soldiers, the tin soldiers. And the one that he loved the most was the one with the missing leg. At night the toys would come alive or that's how the story is told. And there they met the soldier with the missing leg. And the ballerina with the heart of gold. At night they would share each others dreams. Under the stars shining bright. But they were too shy to speak of love, to speak of love. One day the boy sat them on the windowsill. To watch for the enemy coming over the hill. But when the wind blew it knocked him into the street. And the boys from the town they said. Won't you look at the one legged soldier. Let's stick him in a boat and send him far away. 'Cause I can't find a use for a soldier with a missing leg. And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend. And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend. As he floated past a river rat. On his homemade boat. Well the boat began to sink. And he sank to the bottom of the river. He got swallowed by a fish. Caught by a fisherman. Sold to the family of the boy who had the toys. And the cook said look at the one legged soldier. It looks just like the one we lost the other day. Could this be the boy's tin soldier with the missing leg. And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend. And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend. As he sat on the mantle piece to dry from the river. The ballerina who held his heart sat at his side. And when they got up to dance with each other. They fell by the fire blazing bright. When he jumped to save her from the flames. Their bases began to melt into one in the same. And now they share each others destiny. Together forever they will be. And they are no longer lonely for a friend. And they are no longer lonely for a friend. Not so long ago in a toy room not so far away. Lived a boy who had so many toys. And he played with them all. With them all, with them all. Well he had a ballerina and a one legged soldier, stuck together at the base. And they share each others destiny as they sit on top of the mantel place. It's the story of the one legged soldier. The story of the one legged soldier. The story of the tin soldier with the missing leg."

stories,"When we were young stories were told. That I would kiss you sweet like. People said there was a connection between us. Now that we're older stories are told. Of how I'll hold you tight. Whenever I see those people. I tell them they were right. Stories will be told. From when our children are young. Until they're old. About our endless love. We must have been a blessing from above. Stories will be told until we're old. Stories will be told until the end of time. Stories will be told until we're old. Stories will be told until the end of time. Until the sun won't rise. Oh let me tell you mine, let me tell you mine. It all started on 77th Street. When we were just thirteen. I had no cares at all. Until I saw you from the corner of my eye. It changed my views. It changed my whole life. (repeat chorus)."

the walk,"Well deep in the woods. Where nothing is seen. A tightrope is strung to his heel. And high on the walk. He's down on one knee. He waits for the slow of the breeze. Oh, wow, look at him now on his feet. High up in the sky. And every moment extends endlessly. It feels as though time isn't moving. And every second, one breath not to breathe. I watch as he moves to the beat. Well I'm on the floor. I watch from my seat. I watch as he sways with the trees. And slowly he moves, but so elegantly. I'm more on the edge of my seat. On the tightrope. Everything's bare. All that there is is from here to there. On the tightrope. The goal is quite clear. Don't lose yourself in your fear. Everyone waits on the walk. Some are long and some small. But all of them tall. Everyone must make a choice. Will I go for it all and possibly fall?. The tightrope is thin. I could possibly win on the walk. Well high on the walk. The tightrope it bends. And nobody knows where it ends. To win or to lose. You're all on your own. Everyone must be alone. On the tightrope. Everything's bare. All that there is is from here to there. On the tightrope. The goal is quite clear. Don't lose yourself in your fear"

I guess I should have taken a little more time. (repeat chorus). (bridge). For every tear that you cry. Two tears fall from mine. For every tear that you cry. Two tears fall from mine. For every tear that you cry. For every tear that you cry. Two tears fall from mine.

use me up,Somebody let me down. Somebody show me love. I wouldn't care much either way. I'd rather the sticks and stones. Than draggin the ball and chain. What if the world wont take me.

I've carried it all too long. The fear and the pain it brings. Feeling the panic building up. I'd rather the broken heart. Than living in the emptiness. What if the world won't save me. Even if the bough should break. Even if the blood runs cold. Nothing could be worse than numb. Please. Use me up. Just want any one. To use me up. No one ever does. Use me up. Use me up. Treat me somewhere cruel. You can throw me away. As long as i feel it. Show me something real. You can't deceive me. I am yours to use. Use me up. Use me up. Use me up

Isn't it strange how we all feel a little bit weird. sometimes. Isn't it hard. Standing in the rain.. You're on the verge of going crazy and your heart's in pain. No one can hear though you're screaming so loud. You feel all alone in a faceless crowd. Isn't it strange how we all get a little bit weird. sometimes.. (Chorus). Sitting on the side. Waiting for a sign.. Hoping that my luck will change.. Reaching for a hand that can understand,. Someone who feels the same.. When you live in a cookie cutter world. Being different is a sin.. So you don't stand out.. And you don't fit in. Weird.. Sitting on the side. Waiting for a sign.. Hoping that my luck will change.. Reaching for a hand that can understand,. Someone who feels the same.. When you live in a cookie cutter world. If you're different you can't win.. So you don't stand out. And you don't fit in. Weird..

That's what Christmas means to me my love. Christmas means to me my love. Christmas means to me my love. Christmas means to me my love. Christmas means to me my love. I see your smiling face. Like I've never seen before. Though I love you madly. It seems I love you more. The little though you give me. Will touch my heart for sure. CHORUS. I feel like running wild. Those angels a little shy. I caught you underneath the mistletoe. I kiss you twice and then some more. I wish you merry Christmas baby. And a happy new year. Let's deck the halls with holly. Singing Silent Night. Fill the dreams with angels' hair. Pretty, pretty lights. Go to sleep and wake up. Just before daylight. CHORUS. Christmas means to me my love. Christmas means to me my love. Christmas means to me my love. Christmas means to me my love. Christmas means to me my love. Christmas means to me my love. Christmas means to me my love...."
when you're gone,"Written by : Isaac, Taylor and Zac Hanson. Lead : Taylor Hanson. Well I just can't seem to pity,. Cause my heart's too numb to feel,. And the smile does all the talking,. Touhgh the pain is all that's real,. With the way that you keep screaming,. I can hardly hear to think,. And I feel the bridges are burning,. Underneath my feet. Where do you go when you're gone?. Where do you go when you're gone?. Oh how the road feels so long,. But where do you go when you're gone?. I just want to stay dreaming,. No I just don't want to wake,. Why can't we keep on sailing across this emerald lake,. My forehead is still bleeding from the thorns I used to wear,. And I'm left alone and beaten,. For this cross I choose to bear. Where do you go when you're gone?. Where do you go when you're gone?. Oh how the road feels so long,. But where do you go when you're gone?. Well I finally found what I'm looking for,. Though the road's still long and the light still far,. But I finally found what I'm looking for,. Well I finally found what I'm looking for,. Though the road's still long and the light still far,. But I finally found what I'm looking for. Well the voices fall like timber and the fear it pours like rain,. And my heart is crushed to cinders underneath this kind of pain,. Well there is no resolution when the revolution's dead,. So I'm left with no solution, for the voices in my head. Where do you go when you're gone?. Where do you go when you're gone?. Oh how the road feels so long,. But where do you go when you're gone?"
where did it start,"Where did it start?. Why?. What does it matter. We're far beyond the place that we started. No time of mind to chase after fault. We know the time is so much of what's lost. To a child born with something so wrong in his blood. A sickness, that pumps through his veins,. Through his heart, It's shameful if we only start when. We know that he sleeps in a box in the 3rd drawer. Where did it start?. Can we try to wade this muddy water,. Fill this ocean of need bottle by bottle. Hallowed we stand and watch this parade. Saturday morning, down to the graves. OhhhÂ….. Somebody save us. Somebody stand up. It's carried away. Something must change. Somebody save us. How many more does it take?. Somebody save us. Somebody stand up. It's carried away. Something must change. Somebody save us. How many more will it take?. Ooh...... Where did it start?. When does it stop?. I don't want to get this wrong. Don't you see what's going on?. I don't want to turn you away. Until you know what's at stake. I don't want to get this wrong. Don't you see what's going on?. I don't want to turn you away. Until you know what's at stake. WAKE UP!. Oh oh.... WAKE UP!. Where did it start?. Why?. What does it matter. We're far beyond the place that we started. No time, of mine, to chase after fault. We know the time is so much of what's lost. Can we try to wade this muddy water. Fill this ocean of need bottle by bottle. Hallowed we stand, watch this parade. Saturday morning down to the grave. OhhhÂ…. Where did it start?. When does it stop?. Where did it start?. When does it stop?"
where's the love,"Something has been going on and I don't know what it is. You don't mind the taking girl, but you don't know how to give. You drove me crazy but I don't know baby. You're thinking that it's me you're fooling. Where's the right in, all of our fighting?. Look at what you're doing. Where's the love. It's not enough. It makes the world go 'round and 'round and.... Where's the love. Give it up. It makes the world go 'round and 'round and 'round. Can you tell me what you see whenever you look around?. We're tripping all over ourselves and pulling each other down. We're separating, consciousness is fading. Are you thinking that it's me you're fooling?. Where's the right in, all of our fighting?. Look at, look at, look at what we're doing. (Repeat Chorus). Dark clouds all around, lightning, rain pouring down. Waiting for the bright light to break through. Face down on the ground. Pick us up at the lost and found. We've got to change our point of view, if we want the sky blue. We're segregating, consciences are fading. You're thinking that it's me you're fooling. Where's the right in, all of our fighting. Look at what we're doing. (Repeat Chorus). Won't you, won't you give it up"

world's on fire,"Watch from a distance, beautiful. Somebody's caught in the undertow. Have you ever felt desperation?. As the salt waters fills your lungs. We will regret it when we sleep. Promises never meant to keep. When all of the shadows lead. As a good man?s hiding a dream. Do they know that the world?s on fire?. Time has a price we can?t afford. An empty glass and an open door. You get what you paid for in sweat. And a voice says please don?t forget. Do they know that the world?s on fire?. Do they know that the time is now?. Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up. Let your voice speak out. Do they know that it?s time?. Caught in a maze you can?t escape. The flickering lights, and the colored lens. The walls that we build just close in. Until we decide to begin. Are we distracted by the sun?. The gleaming jewels, and the beating drums. Is it going the distance we fear?. Have you heard that we?re already here?. Do they know that the world?s on fire?. Do they know that the time is now?. Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up. Let your voice speak out. Do they know that the world?s on fire?. Do they know that the time is here?. Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up. Let your voice be clear. Do they know that it?s time?. Some will say we?ve gone too far. We?re on the edge and in too deep. Some will say we?re too far gone. You can?t erase the tragedy. Do they know that the world?s on fire?. Do they know that the time is now?. Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up. Well you gotta stand up, stand up. Do they know that the world?s on fire?. Do they know that the time is here?. Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up. Let your voice be clear. Do they know that it?s time?. Do they know?. Do they know?"
yearbook,"(I. Hanson/T. Hanson/Z. Hanson/E. Shipley). Dear Amy, see you in September. Hope that you remember me next year. Hey Jamie, you've been a great friend to me. I hope that I'll still see you around here. 'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook then I find that empty space. There's a name without a picture, but I can't forget his face. Tell me where did he go, I want to know. Where did Johnny go?. It says, ""Picture unavailable"" right here. More than sad, it makes me mad to know somebody knows. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?. Poor Katie, she won't even speak his name. None of us will ever be the same. It's quiet in the halls, but I hear echoing off the walls.. The rumors of Johnny's mystery. 'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook then I find that empty space. No he never wrote me nothing, but I can't forget his face. (Repeat Chorus). Ohhh. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?. Ohhh. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?. Sometimes I think I hear him calling out my name. Sometimes I wonder if maybe we're to blame. It's been a year now and a lot of things have changed. But I keep thinking about Johnny. I keep turning to that page.. Where did he go I want to know, Where did he go I want to know?. Ohhh. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?."
yearbook song,"Dear Amy, see you in September. Hope that you remember me next year. Hey Jamie, you've been a great friend to me. I hope that I'll still see you around here. 'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook then I find that empty space. There's a name without a picture, but I can't forget his face. Tell me where did he go, I want to know. Where did Johnny go?. It says, ""Picture unavailable"" right here. More than sad, it makes me mad to know somebody knows. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?.

you can't stop us,"Out on the corner on your soapbox looking down. Waving your flag like this is a battle ground. Your fancy words try to cut me down to size. Hey mister, mister, you're in for a big surprise. You can't stop us. You can't stop us now. Soldier of fortune tried to shoot me down. Beating his chest only to hear the sound. Pumping his fist saying that our cause is dead. Go put your lies in somebody else's head. You can't stop us. You can't stop us. You can't stop us now. You can't stop us. You can't stop us. You say you're teaching wrong from right. I say you're preaching only to start a fight. Blood on your hands and mud on your face. Our time has come and you're standing in the way. You can't stop us. You can't stop us. You can't stop us. You can't stop us now"
you never know,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, you don't know. Whoa, whoa, whoa, you don't know. You walk around like maybe there's something your missing. Hallucinations happenin' in your head.. This look you're giving me is not a look for kissing. Something I did or maybe something I said. You never know baby, you never know baby,. You never know baby, you never know. You judge a soul by a lie that was told baby. You never know baby, you never know. Whoa, whoa, whoa, you don't know. I speak these words but baby you don't even listen. These things I say just go right through your head. I've got my gun but I am low on ammunition. I'm like a book that is waiting to be read. You never know baby, you never know baby,. You never know baby, you never know. You judge a soul by a lie that was told baby. You never know baby, you never know. You ever wonder, don't you ever wonder baby. Whose spell you're under, don't you ever wonder maybe?. You ever wonder, don't you ever wonder baby. Whose got your number don't you ever wonder. baby?. What is the source of all this pain that you've been dishing. Could they be lies that maybe you've been fed. Consider well the kind stream where you've been fishing. I'm like a book that is waiting to be read. You never know baby, you never know baby. You never know baby, you never know. You judge a soul by a lie that was told. You never know baby, you never know. Whoa, whoa, whoa, you don't know. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you don't know"
you're enough,"You're enough for the rest of my life. Darling, please don't go. Blink of an eye, did I make it in time?. Hold me and tell me I'm home. I'll give you my word. The word of a fool in love. You're enough for the rest of my life. Darling, I surrender. Wide awake I sit in my bedroom alone. Think of all the things I need.

your illusion,"You say you want to kill yourself. It might make it just a little bit easier. You think you're the only one who hurts. Try looking just a little bit harder. I don't know why you're holding on. To the damage that's been done. 'Cause you've got me wrapped up in your illusion. I keep on trying to change your conclusion. But you've got me wrapped up in your illusion. I keep on dying 'cause you're busy wasting life. Don't disguise your emptiness. By placing blame on me and everyone else. Protected by your safety nets. But you can't put the heart of your fears at rest. All I feel is deep regret for what you have become. You've got me wrapped up in your illusion. I keep on trying to clear the confusion. But you've got me wrapped up in your illusion. I keep on dying 'cause you're busy wasting. I keep on trying 'cause you're busy wasting life. You're busy wasting life. You're busy wasting life. I cannot go on this way. I bring no consolation for you and your pain. No one else can change your fate. You'll have to do it for yourself. You've got me wrapped up in your illusion. I keep on trying to clear the confusion. But you've got me wrapped up in your illusion. I keep on dying 'cause you're busy wasting life. You're busy wasting life,. You're busy wasting life, you've got me wrapped up. You're busy wasting life, 'cause I keep on trying. You're busy wasting life, you've got me wrapped up. You're busy wasting life, and I keep on dying"
zombie,"Now scream. This halloween you better watch your step. There are many creatures on the streets at night. Some monsters come out of plastic boxes. Still many more are of a supernatural kind. If you run into a rotted corpse. And he is gravitated in shorts, yell. Zombie. Then kick him in the face. Zombie. Then punch him in the nuts. Zombie. Then shoot him in the brain. Zombie. Now scream. Youre on the town saying trick or treat. But youre not thinking about how good you look to eat. In every cemetery there are open spaces. Any ghoul would love for you to take his place. If you fall into an open grave. And find youre staring face to face, yell. Zombie. Then kick him in the face. Zombie. Then punch him in the nuts. Zombie. Then shoot him in the brain. Zombie. Now scream. Dont think that zombies are your friend. The thing theyre mumbling isnt that they want to tell you a secret. Dont think that zombies are injured people. Theyre not injured people. Theyre just partly dead people. Dont think that ive gone insane. Youll take the tomb the day the zombies eat your brain. Actually you wont because when they eat. Your brain youll become a zombie. Youll be a zombie. Youll be a zombie. Youll be zombie. Youll be a zombie. Zombie. Then you kick him in the face. Zombie. Then you punch him in the nuts. Zombie. Then you shoot him in the brain. Zombie. Now scream. Zombie. Then you kick him in the face. Zombie. Then you punch him in the nuts. Zombie. Then you shoot him in the brain. Zombie. Now scream"
