beautiful lie,"Just like the sky. Fresh like an angel. The sun that roasts and sets upon my back. So bitter sweet, some kind of savior. All the smoke and bitter feeling through my head. But in the light of day it all gets clearer. When you see it through the rearview mirror. [Chorus]. It shakes me, turns around and wakes me up. Fade back, drop skies. What a beautiful lie. You gave me pictures of daydreams. No way, no one. Just a beautiful lie. Nothing to hold, only a promise. You were the sand that kept on falling through my hands. A house made of cards, a state full of players. No one to trust, no ending, nowhere I could stand. But in the light of day it all gets clearer. When you see it through the rearview mirror. [Repeat Chorus]. Late at night in a dream. How you wanted me. Blowing in through the wind. Doesn’t have to be. Coming in like static on the radio. Should have know but I didn’t know. Like clouds in the sky. Like waves going by. I swear that I could fly. But I came crashing down. This hurt all around. It shakes me, turns around and wakes me up. Fade back, drop skies. What a beautiful lie. What a beautiful lie. What a beautiful lie. Clouds in the sky. Like waves going by. No way, no one. Just a beautiful lie"

I see the world........... I'm gonna finally make you see. I'm gonna make you learn your lesson with me. Cause I'm not the kind of girl who will lay down at your feet. Pedal back for your love, come whenever you call me. Cause you're not what I need. (No, you're not the one for me no). (And I'll never have to let you go). (Cause I'm more than that girl in the shadow - I'm telling ya). Cause I'm not the kind of girl who will lay down at your feet. Beg for your love, come whenever you call me. And you'll never see me cry. (No, you'll never see me cry, no, no, no). (And you're never gonna break me no, no). (Cause I'm never gonna be what you want me to). (I know for sure)."
only for you,"It makes me sad when I see you cry. It's paradise when it's just you and I. You make me happy when you are around. I'm in love, I'm in love with my baby. When I look at you I'm walking on air. You leave completely breathless, I swear. There's no denying, you are my dream. I'm in love, I'm in love with my baby. Only for you. I would climb upon the highest mountain. Just to speak your name. Only for you. I would go anywhere. I would leave everything behind. Only for you, the things you do. You're giving me love, it feels so good. Only for you, baby it's true. Forever, we will always stay together. I'm lost in your love mellow inside. My will is yours, it's no longer mine. We don't miscall it, it's in your touch. I'm in love, I'm in love with my baby. It's tenderheart, all of my kind ignore. The passion I feel when you walk through that door. And tears are drinking your kisses of wine. I'm in love, I'm in love with my baby. Only for you. I would climb upon the highest mountain. Just to speak your name. Only for you. I would go anywhere. I would leave everything behind. Only for you, the things you do. You're giving me love, it feels so good. Only for you, baby it's true. Forever, we will always stay together. Only for you. I would go anywhere. I would leave everything behind. Only for you, the things you do. You're giving me love, it feels so good. Only for you, baby it's true. Forever, we will always stay together"

stereo,"It's very clear to me, just like it's in 3d. When total empathy sounds like it's ringing on my stereo. I'm bouncing off the wall, the way you turn me on. I think I like this song, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo. Deep in the scene, like the music getting fascinating. Touching the screen, like the view from my imagination. Ninety degrees, got me circulating. I've been waiting, Impatiently. Got me changing stations on occasion. What's your frequency?. Can you connect with me?. If it's alright your satellite can be my energy. Don't wanna be too bizarre but you're the key to my heart. You're my electric guitar, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo. It's very clear to me, just like it's in 3d. When total empathy sounds like it's ringing on my stereo. I'm bouncing off the wall, the way you turn me on. I think I like this song, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo. Survive the people's faces, they're dancing from temptation. Her icky style is wasted, you don't need no invitation. Hey there cutey boys. Making all the noise. It's getting hard up in here. You don't have a choice. What's your frequency?. Can you connect with me?. If it's alright your satellite can be my energy. Don't wanna be too bizarre but you're the key to my heart. You're my electric guitar, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo. It's very clear to me, just like it's in 3d. When total empathy sounds like it's ringing on my stereo. I'm bouncing off the wall, the way you turn me on. I think I like this song, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo. [Pretty Willie's Rap]. Oooohhh, Heeeey, Ooooh. It's very clear to me, just like it's in 3d. When total empathy sounds like it's ringing on my stereo. I'm bouncing off the wall, the way you turn me on. I think I like this song, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo. It's very clear to me, just like it's in 3d. When total empathy sounds like it's ringing on my stereo.

the last goodbye,"The streets are big and empty. Ever since you left me. I really hate to say. That nothing's good for me. It seems I haven't seen you lately. The day without you pass me. The hours and minutes blast me. They're the coldest reminder of the biter hole you left here in my heart. If you've been good to me baby. I'll consider it and maybe. I can still losy my heart and my soul over you. Oh, but never my head. I swore my love was true. Looking through tears in my eyes. But I promise to you this is gonnabe finally the last goodbye. The last goodbye. Even if you come to beg me. To forgive you, you won't make me. Even if I see you crying. You'll still probably be lying. Even if it causes me pain. I've already thrown off your chains. And I swear that this rancheras gonna be the last goodbye. Even if you come to plead. Begging on your hands and knees. Even if I see you crying. You'll still probably be lying. Even if you say that you've changed. I'm still throwin off your cruel chains. And I swear that this rancheras gonna be the last goodbye. [Instrument Break].

when you say nothing at all,"It´s amazing how you can speak right to my heart. Without saying a word, you can light up the dark. Try as I may I can never explain. What I hear when you don´t say a thing. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There´s a truth in your eyes saying you´ll never leave me. The touch of your hand says you´ll catch me wherever I fall. You say it best… when you say nothing at all. Es absurdo saber como hago tu voluntad. Y te vuelves, amor, luz en la oscuridad. Tú no lo ves y está escrito en tu piel. Yo lo escucho, lo siento, lo sé. Sonríes y sé que tú puedes oírme. Que tú piensas en mi y yo puedo sentirte. Estás entre el cuerpo y el alma callada total. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There´s a truth in your eyes saying you´ll never leave me. The touch of your hand says you´ll catch me wherever I fall. You say it best… when you say noting at all. Oh......The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There´s a truth in your eyes saying you´ll never leave me. The touch of your hand says you´ll catch me wherever I fall. Te entiendo mejor... when you say nothing at all. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There´s a truth in your eyes saying you´ll never leave me. The touch of your hand says you´ll catch me wherever I fall…"
