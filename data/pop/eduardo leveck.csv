And I'm a fool. For feeling like I really want him back, I want him back. Tell me I'm a ruin. When the love I had with him. It never last, it'll never last. I need a bridge. To get me over troubled water. I need a bridge. To get me over you. Theres be so many ups and downs. Guess I fought to make it work. And now a knew girls come along. And she's enjoying all my perks. And I still haven't cried. Guess that they were too deep inside. And too ashamed to come by. That I'm still in love with you. And I'm a fool. For feeling like I really want him back, I want him back. Tell me I'm a ruin. When the love I had with him. It never last, it'll never last. I need a bridge. To get me over the troubled water. I need a bridge. To get me over you"
