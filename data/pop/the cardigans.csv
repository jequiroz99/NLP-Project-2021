lovefool,"Dear, I fear we're facing a problem. You love me no longer, I know. And maybe there is nothing. That I can do to make you do. Mamma tells me I shouldn't bother. That I ought to stick to another man. A man that surely deserves me. But I think you do!. So I cry, and I pray, and I beg.... Love me, love me,. Say that you love me. Fool me, fool me,. Go on and fool me. Love me, love me,. Pretend that you love me. Leave me, leave me,. Just say that you need me. So I cry and I beg for you to.... Love me, love me,. Say that you love me. Leave me, leave me,. Just say that you need me. I can't care about anything but you.... Lately I have desperately pondered,. Spent my nights awake and I wonder. What I could have done in another way. To make you stay. Reason will not lead to solution. I will end up lost in confusion. I don't care if you really care. As long as you don't go. So I cry I pray and I beg.... Love me, love me,. Say that you love me. Fool me, fool me,. Go on and fool me. Love me, love me,. Pretend that you love me. Leave me, leave me,. Just say that you need me. So I cry and I beg for you to.... Love me, love me,. Say that you love me. Fool me, fool me,. Go on and fool me. Love me, love me,. Pretend that you love me. Leave me, leave me,. Just say that you need me. I can't care about anything but you.... Anything but you.... Love me, love me say that you love me. Fool me fool me,. Go on and fool me. Love me, love me. I know that you need me. I can't care about anything but you..."
my favourite game,"I don't know what you're looking for. You haven't found it baby, that's for sure. You rip me up, you spread me all around. In the dust of the deed of time. And this is not a case of lust, you see. It's not a matter of you versus me. It's fine the way you want me on your own. But in the end it's always me alone. And I'm losing my favourite game. You're losing your mind again. I'm losing my baby. Losing my favourite game. I only know what I've been working for. Another you so I could love you more. I really thought that I could take you there. But my experiment is not getting us anywhere. I had a vision I could turn you right. A stupid mission and a lethal fight. I should have seen it when my hope was new. My heart is black and my body is blue. And I'm losing my favourite game. You're losing your mind again. I'm losing my favourite game. You're losing your mind again. I'm losing my baby. Losing my favourite game. I'm losing my favourite game. You're losing your mind again. I tried, I tried, (but you're still the same) I tried. I'm losing my baby. You're losing my saviour and saint"

marvel hill,"Strange to be on Marvel Hill. I've walked some years to find. I know there is a piece to fill. the gap I have in mind. No, nothing's here, I close my eyes. it's on the other side. And what I've worked so hard to gain. I'd gladly give away. 'cause I don't need this. I don't need it. I need more. a postcard from where life is athrill. on top of Marvel Hill. but I don't need this. I don't need it. I need more. no, I don' t need this. too good to be true. too good to ignore. I don't need this. I need so much more. It's too much to ask for."
paralyzed,"This is where your sanity gives in. and love begins. Never lose your grip. don't trip. don't fall. you'll lose it all. The sweetest way to die. It lies deep inside. you can not hide. it's the meanest fire. Oh, it's a strange desire. you can not lie. that's a needless fight. This is where your sanity gives in. and love begins. Never lose your grip. don't trip. don't fall. you'll lose it all. The sweetest way to die. When your blood runs dry. you're paralyzed. it will eat your mind. Did you hold it back. It comes to you in slow attacks. It's the meanest fire."

hanging around,I wonder what it's like. seeing through your eyes. You've offered me to have a try. but I was always late. The filters that I use. give me an excuse. I take away what's real. I feel it and it blows my fuse. I hang around. for another round. I'm hanging around. for another round. I'm hanging on. to the same old song. I hang around. for another round. Until somethings stops me. I wonder what it's like. walking by your side. To think before I talk. and to move at the same speed as you walk. I want to have a weight. to keep me in your state. I'm watching from above. I love it but it's not for me. I hang around. for another round. I'm hanging around. for another round. I'm hanging on. to the same old song. I hang around. for another round. Until somethings stops me.

losing a friend,"You're losing a friend. You got it all wrong. It's not about revenge. You're losing a friend. I didn't see it coming. With my head stuck in the sand. But now I'm losing a friend. And it's keeping me up. It's the ribbons I tie. I would rather just die. Go to heaven, crawl back. Than let you go. You're losing a friend. You jeopardize me. Bad, bad blood on your hands. I see you're losing a friend. I'm flicke and I'm vain. And you trick me over and over again. And now I'm losing you. And it's killing me. It's the strings that I tie. I would rather just die. Go to heaven, crawl back. Than let it all go. My mistake. To lose you. Oh no, oh no. So this is the end now. I'm losing you. Oh, look at you!. Look what you wasted. You're losing a friend. Oh no, oh no. I'm losing a friend. Oh, oh oh no"
starter,This is a start. that I know I'll believe in. so I'm leavin' everything behind. Keeping the parts. that I know I'll be needing. and I breed to be a better kind. And I'm leavin' everyone behind. This is the age. when my past should be gone. but it's just stronger than the aims I have Turning the pages. I used to hang on to. I was young and I have changed my mind. And I'm leaving everything behind. New beginning again. a bit closer. new beginning again. a little bit closer. New beginning again. a bit closer to the end. This is the time. it's a delicate line. to the beginning of what's yet to come. Lifetimes of changes. a strange generation. explanations never come in time. So I'm leavin' everything behind.

Take me higher. oh take me higher. come take me high above our time. We'll make it out of here… oh yeah. You justify, you're not afraid. and I won't feel like this forever.

junk of the hearts,We never chose to part. in this stupid play. I never felt by heart. that I could behave. the way the roles were made. I know that I've done you wrong. but you're hard to please. When your faith is gone. and when you can't believe. I'm on my hands and knees. The junk of the hearts. I've given all of me. and you crave for more. Weird how this makes us feel. insecure. that's what friends are for.

mr. crowley,"Mr. Crowley, what went on in your head?. Oh, Mr. Crowley, did you talk to the dead?. Your life style to me seemed so tragic. With the thrill of it all. You fooled all the people with magic. Yeah, you waited on Satan's door. Mr. Charming, did you think you were pure?. Mr. Alarming, in nocturnal rapport. Uncovering things that were sacred. Manifest on this Earth. Conceived in the eye of a secret. And they scattered the afterbirth. Mr. Crowley, won't you ride my white horse?. Mr. Crowley, it's symbolic, of course. Approaching a time that is classic. I hear that maiden's call. Approaching a time that is drastic. Standing with their backs to the wall. Was it polemically sent. l want to know what you meant. I want to know, I want to know what you meant, yeah"

03.45: no sleep,"It's way too late to think of. Someone I would call now. And neon signs got tired. Red eye flights help the stars out. I'm safe in a corner. Just hours before me. I'm waking with the roaches. The world has surrendered. I'm dating ancient ghosts. The ones I made friends with. The comfort of fireflies. Long gone before daylight. And if I had one wish fulfilled tonight. I'd ask for the sun to never rise. If God leant his voice to me to speak. I'd say go to bed, world. I've always been too late. To see what's before me. And I know nothing sweeter than. Champaign from last New Years. Sweet music in my ears. And a night full of no fears. But if I had one wish fulfilled tonight. I'd ask for the sun to never rise. If God passed a mic to me to speak. I'd say stay in bed, world"

And change theese years. I'm going through changes. I'm going through changes

We’ll never have the guts. To discover. We’ll choke on it and die.

And I saw you. But that's not an invitation!. That's all I get. If this is communication. I disconnect. I've seen you, I know you, but I don't know. How to connect. So I disconnect. You always seem to know where to find me. And I'm still here behind you. In the corner of your eye. I'll never really learn how to love you. But I know that I love you. Through the hole in the sky. Where I see you. And that's not an invitation!. That's all I get. If this is communication. I disconnect. I've seen you, I know you. But I don't know. How to connect. So I disconnect. Well, this is an invitation!. It's not a threat. If you want communication. That's what you get. I'm talking and talking. But I don't know. How to connect. And I hold. A record for being patient.

feathers and down,So you trying to do what they did. Your friends that turn to liquid. And got lost in the see. And now youâ€™re drowning me. With your talk of full eat clovers. You turn to rocks and no man. To be the ambient harm. But itâ€™s bruising your karma. Oh I wish my arms were wider. I wish that I could hide you. So you can rest and repair. Without the blanket of sorrow. The thick and the grey. Your blanket of wool. So heavy and stain. And it only weighs you down. So you thought that getting sober. Would mean your life was over. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s that bad. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s that sad. Just you sleep a little baby. Leave the world alone and later. If you wake up alive. That old blanket of sorrow. Could be feathers and down. Your blanket of wool. Would leave you alone. And I can love you till you drown. Come to me letâ€™s drown. Come baby letâ€™s drown.

I recall it now. she said ""I feel for you my friend. cause I'll soon be leaving"". The autumn comes just like other years. but I won't see the signs. the sun above's sowing magic seeds. but it wants someone back. No, nothing can amaze me. cause everything's behind me. no, nothing else can please me. since all I had been said free."

Oh please drive away the light. Although my mother will never understand. I walk with him away from the light. And into the night. Oh you, you, you, itâ€™s got to be you. Oh you, oh you, itâ€™s got to be you. True, true, itâ€™s true itâ€™s got to be you. Oh you, oh you, itâ€™s got to be you. To lead me into the night. Well I went too far and I came too close. I drove away the first one and now heâ€™s the coast. And I went to drift on a boat made of sand. It was leaking like a sift but I made it to land. It leads me into the night.

sabbath bloody sabbath,"You've seen life through distorted eyes. You know you had to learn. The execution of your mind. You really had to turn. The race is run the book is read. The end begins to show. The truth is out, the lies are old. But you don't want to know. Nobody will ever let you know. When you ask the reasons why. They just tell you that you're on your own.

You're wishing that the hands of doom. Could take your mind away. And you don't care if you don't see again. The light of day. Nobody will ever let you know. When you ask the reasons why. They just tell you that you're on your own. Fill your head all full of lies. Where can you run to. What more can you do. No more tomorrow. Life is killing you. Dreams turn to nightmares. Heaven turns to hell. Burned out confusion. Nothing more to tell. Everything around you. What's it coming to. God knows as your dog knows. Bog blast all of you. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.
