And I will show you victory is mine before we leave this battleground. Cause he don't wanna leave, and I don't wanna go. And I know just how this battle goes. He don't wanna leave and I don't wanna fight this kind of war. You know he's not the man you think he is; he's hiding all his flaws. So tell me what's the point of fighting? Because we'll all end up with scars. But girl if that's what I must go through, then I'm not prepared to lose. Cause I've already bled so much for you (No...).

i used to love her,"I was crazy man you wouldn't believe what I seen. Got me reminiscing down too much memories. The only girl you know that in my heart. The one I almost gave that ring. But we were so young, mustve been only nineteen. I guess the time wasn't right and we said some mean things. A bitter day when I saw her face. She was the one that I let get away. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. There was talkin' in the room that everythings good. There was no love lost between us I couldn't. Believe how I truly noticed now that I wasn't over her. And now I'm like oh damn cause now I know man. Lookin' back at all our pictures while I'm playing slow jamz. What can I say, is that the way our situation worked out. Wish there was something I could do. Like stop the clock just lookin. Go back and revisit our relationship and start brand new. And do the things that I didn't do. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. Man I know it's crazy. She pulled me back with just a smile. Now I feel these things inside. I havent felt em' in a while. And I'm sure that they will go away just a little time. She'll always be that girl to me. But now I gotta let her see. I used to love her..."
come with me,"When I wake up in the morning I see. Everybody's looking at me. Whispering and talking, pointin fingers at me. What is it that they want me to be. Can't keep up this fight no more. Won't keep up this fight no more. So I run to my world, (my world) my world. Where I can do what I want and be free to be myself. I gotta run to my world, my world. Coz I aint comfortable with trying to be somebody else. [Chorus:]. I gotta get away from this crazy life. Get away from the hype. Get away from this two and two makes five. Take a look beyond what they see. Maybe you will realise. So come with me. On my roller-coaster ride. When you go to sleep at night you dream. Of all the things you've always wanted to be. But when you wake up in the morning you see. That everything is out of your reach. Can't keep up this fight no more. Won't keep up this fight no more. [Chorus]. Let me show you all the things you don't see. Come with me. If you don't already know. This life you see is so different on the inside. If you. Come with me. So let me know. [Chorus]"

stolen,"You were my eyes when I couldn't see. You were my air when I couldn't breathe. I think you always knew what you meant to me. And you were my strength when I was down.

me against myself,"Jay Sean vs Jay Sean. Me against myself. and there aint no chorus. so just listen. m-m-m-mentor. oh girl. you look so beautiful. with that moonlight shining on you. i wanna hold you. i wanna touch you and squeeza you and love you all night long, babygirl. Yo, i've heard it before, so save all the cliches, i really can't belieive there's no talent. around theses days, jay sean with the same old shit, talkin' about baby girl that and babygirl. this, i seen you dancin' around with the girl in your vid, poutin' at the camera, smilin' with. the chessiest grin, what the deal?, whatever happened to keepin' it real?, back in the day when. you was rappin' before the time of your deal (uh). and now that you got signed, oh it's clear and it's simple, you're only makin' music that you. pretend that you're into, come on, ""dance with you"" was never a hit fool, and what the hell is. takin' you so long with your next single?!. Fix up! it's been about six months and insults are everywhere, even your own fans think your. shit sucks (i don't like jay sean) And i know that you pretend to ignore them, it's gotta hurt. when you're even gettin' dissed on your own forum! Yeah i've done my reseach, back when you. started fool, back when people thought you was the genuine article, genuine my arse, it's just a. whack imitation, the only thing different about you, is the fact that your asian!. (Well well) Well i guess it must've helped a bit, the fact that everything has an asian twist,. includin' music, i guess we cornered it, i'm surprised that simon cowell hadn't thought of it,. and there's issues that i find myself placed with, bein' pigeon-holed and accused of imitating,. it's a struggle and it's so frustrating tellin' me i'm tryna be the asian craig david. and i bet that just had your in tears, wasn't that the reason you ended up shavin' your beard?!. i guess you couldn't take the way that people would mock that, so it was off with the jaw line. and goodbye to the sock hat, but you still bit your style with the fast singin' of verse two in. ""dance with you"" now you wonder why the critics slander you. Well you said you done your research baby, you didn't look hard enough it needs updating, if you. think, that i'm copying craig, listen to my 1994 demo tape, i was fast rapping , and singin' back. in the day, back in the fu-schnickens and Big L phase. Whatever, it seems you sold your sold to the game, your a fake, 'cos jay sean aint even your. name, so how'd you come up with that? it aint unique after all, what are you like a cross between. jay-z and sean paul? you're better off with the name you was born, you little pansy, you really. should've been called gay porn, so which ones your lover? richi Rich? or Juggy D? probably Rishi,. he sees you as his bitch doesn't he? wasn't he the one responsible for launchin' you career? like. a while ago, i'm talkin' like well over a year, you were studyin' medicine then, but you quit. that now, to do music, how the hell did you manage to flip that round? and how'd you tell your. parents, you know how shit that sounds?! ""Mummy, Daddy, I want to be a postar! SIT BACK DOWN..!!"". But never the less, i quit went ahead and progressed, had my eyes on a goal and wouldn't settle. for less. What d'you mean? you only got where you are cos of a gimmick! the whole indian thing was big and. you were luckily in it, and don't be upset if people don't come to your shows, they're not. allowed out, 'cos half your fans are 11 year olds, Wow big deal, so you got to number 12, i'm not. surprised if your mum bought half the copies herself, you know what? i'm tired man, i'm sick i'm. bored of you, run off you little puppet, i hear Rishi rich callin' you. I guess your talkin' the talk, but you aint rappin for years, and it was me who got ya foot in. the door, it seems that your ego's been sufffering blows, 'cos you only get heard when you guest. appear on my show, i'm not phased, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't be on this track in the. first place!"
all or nothing,"Verse1. There wasn't anything I didn't love about u,. You'd do some stupid things and I'd laugh at those too,. & we went together like the summer in june. But who'd have known that it'd rain so soon. Thought I'd be the only one that'd make u smile,. Thought I'd be the only one that'd really know how. But u showed me different and I know better now,. I gotta get u out my system somehow. Chorus. I replay it over and over again. U were my girl, now we 'aint even friends,. U couldve been my all or nothing, all or nothing,. Now to me ur nothing, girl u r nothing, now ur nothing. Verse 2. Put u on a pedestal, girl I held u so high. Was never too good at finding the words to describe,. Just how I felt for u but u know that I tried,. But somehow we went and changed inside. U damn near were my everything ur still on my mind,. But I'd rather be here all alone and I'm doin just fine. Gotta take it back to the days before we met. And live our lives as strangers again. Chorus. I replay it over and over again. U were my girl, now we 'aint even friends,. U couldve been my all or nothing, all or nothing,. Now to me ur nothing, girl u r nothing, now ur nothing. I replay it over and over again. U were my girl, now we 'aint even friends,. U couldve been my all or nothing, all or nothing,. Now to me ur nothing, girl u r nothing, now ur nothing. Middle 8. December days, my summer turned to winter. When u went away - I can't help but wonder. Was he worth my pain - u shud know better -. And I should've too. And I cried, and u cried and we tried to make it work,. Almost died while we tried, is that what our love was worth,. If I cud do it again, I would be a better man,. Now I'm living with just memories. Chorus. I replay it over and over again. U were my girl, now we 'aint even friends,. U couldve been my all or nothing, all or nothing,. Now to me ur nothing, girl u r nothing, now ur nothing. I replay it over and over again. U were my girl, now we 'aint even friends,. U couldve been my all or nothing, all or nothing,. Now to me ur nothing, girl u r nothing, now ur nothing"

All on your body. A a a all on your body girl. All on your body. A a a all on your body girl. All on your body. A a a all on your body girl. All on your body. A a a all on your body girl
all or nothing,"Verse1. There wasn't anything I didn't love about u,. You'd do some stupid things and I'd laugh at those too,. & we went together like the summer in june. But who'd have known that it'd rain so soon. Thought I'd be the only one that'd make u smile,. Thought I'd be the only one that'd really know how. But u showed me different and I know better now,. I gotta get u out my system somehow. Chorus. I replay it over and over again. U were my girl, now we 'aint even friends,. U couldve been my all or nothing, all or nothing,. Now to me ur nothing, girl u r nothing, now ur nothing. Verse 2. Put u on a pedestal, girl I held u so high. Was never too good at finding the words to describe,. Just how I felt for u but u know that I tried,. But somehow we went and changed inside. U damn near were my everything ur still on my mind,. But I'd rather be here all alone and I'm doin just fine. Gotta take it back to the days before we met. And live our lives as strangers again. Chorus. I replay it over and over again. U were my girl, now we 'aint even friends,. U couldve been my all or nothing, all or nothing,. Now to me ur nothing, girl u r nothing, now ur nothing. I replay it over and over again. U were my girl, now we 'aint even friends,. U couldve been my all or nothing, all or nothing,. Now to me ur nothing, girl u r nothing, now ur nothing. Middle 8. December days, my summer turned to winter. When u went away - I can't help but wonder. Was he worth my pain - u shud know better -. And I should've too. And I cried, and u cried and we tried to make it work,. Almost died while we tried, is that what our love was worth,. If I cud do it again, I would be a better man,. Now I'm living with just memories. Chorus. I replay it over and over again. U were my girl, now we 'aint even friends,. U couldve been my all or nothing, all or nothing,. Now to me ur nothing, girl u r nothing, now ur nothing. I replay it over and over again. U were my girl, now we 'aint even friends,. U couldve been my all or nothing, all or nothing,. Now to me ur nothing, girl u r nothing, now ur nothing"

bricks,"I'm tired of trying to sail this. Troubled boat again. Trying hard to find a way. For though blows me all the same. And I'm tired of holding on. When there's nothing more to gain. I'd rather stand here on the dock. And watch it all just sail away. This sail has no wind. This wind has no sea. The sea has no shore anymore. I'm walking these streets all by myself. I know its my fault, and no one else. And there's nobody here to save me. I'm walking alone. And if I look lonely, that's alright. Cause I'm the only one left in my life. And there's no one to save me. I'm walking alone. In a word that lives in graces. I'm a grain amongst the sand. I never took the time to get to know. The person that I am. And maybe I was just caught up. Up in the race and so I'd run. And I hadn't even stop. To see the man that I've become. This sail has no wind. This wind has no sail. The sea has no shore anymore. I'm walking these streets all by myself. I know its my fault, and no one else. And there's nobody here to save me. I'm walking alone. And if I look lonely, that's alright. Cause I'm the only one left in my life. And there's no one to save me. I'm walking alone. It ain't like it's over, I haven't thrown it all away. Cause I won't just stop living over my own mistakes. And I just needed time for a moment to stand. So that I can just see who it is that I am. ohh ohhh. walking alone. I'm walking these streets all by myself. I know its my fault, and no one else.

holding on,How'd I let it get this far. What was going through my mind. Why'd you seem to have it all. Yet you're not mine. Started off as just good friends. Still we overstepped the line. Coz falling for you was so easy. Ohh... You're everything I want. You're everything I need. You're everything I want my girl to be. And even though I know. You're in someone else's heart. I can't bare to be apart. See I've fallen for you. And I've gotta let you go. And I know that I have got to. Find a way to get on with my life. I don't wanna let you go (let you go). But it's killing me inside (inside). How can I just carry on. I need some peace of mind (need some peace of mind). How do I just move along (along). And ignore the love so strong (so strong). So until I see this through. I'll be holding on to you. To you... baby.... Throughout the years with her I've tried. To find the joy beyond the pain. But when the words and tears subside. Girl it's still the same. And I can't look into her eyes. Without thinking about you. See I've tried but these feelings won't leave me. No..... You're everything I want. You're everything I dream. You're everything I want my girl to be. And even though I know. You're in someone else's arms. I can't bare to be apart. See girl I fell for you. And I don't wanna say goodbye. And I know that I have got to. Find a way to get on with my life. I don't wanna let you go. But it's killing me inside. How can I just carry on (how can I). I need some peace of mind (peace of mind). How do I just move along. And ignore the love so strong (so strong). So until I see this through. I'll be holding on to you. I look away when he holds you. For I'm afraid that I might find. The look in your eyes. That I see when you were mine. So tell me why I've got to be. The one to walk away. And leave you there in someone else's arms. (Won't let you go away. I don't wanna let you go. But it's killing me inside (killing me inside). How can I just carry on (how can I). I need some peace of mind. How do I just move along. And ignore the love so strong. So until I see this through (till I...till I). I'll be holding on to you
home,"After all that he said, after all that he done. What can make you believe that he's still the one. Why'd you hide from the truth, when you break down and cry. There's a reason you stay, I just don't know why. Would be better off walking away from this. And you won't be alone. When there's nowhere to run, when you're hurting inside. When you can't carry on, just know there's a place you can hide. Don't you be so afraid of the things he might say. I would stay by your side baby if you believe, let it go. You're gonna find your way home!. I remember that girl, her laugh and her smile. She ain't gone but she's been away for a while. No I find it hard to watch and take that away. But there's only so much that I can, can take. You know you deserve so much more than this. How can I make you feel?. When there's nowhere to run, when you're hurting inside. When you can't carry on, just know there's a place you can hide. Don't you be so afraid of the things he might say. I would stay by your side baby if you believe, let it go. You're gonna find your way home!. You should know you deserve so much more. (so much more). So let me take you away. (let me take you away). When there's nowhere to run, when you're hurting inside. When you can't carry on, just know there's a place you can hide. Don't you be so afraid of the things he would say. I would stay by your side baby if you believe, let it go.

i don't know,"Oh, oh no, oh no yeah. It isn't just the way that you look. And it isn't just the way that you touch. And it isn't cause you lift me up. When you know I'm running out of luck. And all your crazy ways that I love. And even when we're lost for words. Cause we don't have to talk too much. Cause I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. What I would do without you. Cause it ain't just the one thing girl,. It's everything about you. And it doesn't get any, any better than this. It's the little things 'bout you that I know that I'd miss. From the moment I saw you, I couldn't resist. And I don't think I'll ever get over you. It doesn't get any better than this. No, no, no, no. It isn't cause you saved my life. And it isn't cause you helped me through. It isn't cause you never lied to me. When others never told the truth. It isn't cause you got me mad. Tho' you always got your ṗoints of view. We don't always see eye to eye. That's another thing I love about you. And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. What I would do without you. Cause it ain't just the one thing girl,. It's everything about you. And it doesn't get any, any better than this. It's the little things 'bout you that I know that I'd miss. From the moment I saw you, I couldn't resist. And I don't think I'll ever get over you. It doesn't get any better than this. No, no, no, no. Not over you and me. And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. What I would do without you. It ain't just the one thing girl, no. It's everything about you. And it doesn't get any, any better than this, no. It's the little things 'bout you that I know that I'd miss.

i used to love her,"I was crazy man you wouldn't believe what I seen. Got me reminiscing down too much memories. The only girl you know that in my heart. The one I almost gave that ring. But we were so young, mustve been only nineteen. I guess the time wasn't right and we said some mean things. A bitter day when I saw her face. She was the one that I let get away. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. There was talkin' in the room that everythings good. There was no love lost between us I couldn't. Believe how I truly noticed now that I wasn't over her. And now I'm like oh damn cause now I know man. Lookin' back at all our pictures while I'm playing slow jamz. What can I say, is that the way our situation worked out. Wish there was something I could do. Like stop the clock just lookin. Go back and revisit our relationship and start brand new. And do the things that I didn't do. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. Man I know it's crazy. She pulled me back with just a smile. Now I feel these things inside. I havent felt em' in a while. And I'm sure that they will go away just a little time. She'll always be that girl to me. But now I gotta let her see. I used to love her..."

interlude (irony skit),"Yo Mental. If I had to count the number of times. people have asked me the old asian thing. is it a fad or is it gonna last?. I mean bro you know me n you been doing this time back. they werent ready then. and now they're all asking me like ahh man!. Am tired of hearing the same things. and saying the same words that answer. the same questions chatting my own world. I'm tired of sounding bitter. this is so much more than just a chip on ma shoulder. See the strange thing is, better rappers. and better singers have managed. to find a need for themselves in this business. So you wouldn't think it would be hard. to distinguish a british asian brutha. who raps n sings english- wrong!. Forget the fact that I'm asian. cause they said I was a copycat- a whack imitation!. Until the media jumped on the bangaba scene. all of a sudden this seems to be an angle for me!. thas why I hear ""jay why don't you write a music. indian phrase a bit of panjabi. and soon it will be the latest craze! "". My language ain't a fad see honour. we even got craig david to say ""aaj pangra pona"". Haha! yo I don't know how long it's gona last man. Maybe I... maybe I should'nthave quit medicine.

You, you're gonna help me lie. Ohh ohh, ohh aa. (Sweet, sweet) you should've warned me baby. Ohh ohh ohh aa. (Sweet) sweet jameson. Love me in evening. And hurt me in the morning. And leave me without warning. Oh sweet jameson. Ohh sweet, (sweet, sweet). Ohh sweet, ohh sweet, ohh sweet. You was always my baby. You would come first. When I needed saving. Jaime, you were my world. I would drown in your love. Till it all becomes a blur. And I'd leave all my dignity there. Oh what a sight to see. I can't stand, but I won't fall. Just say I'm your only, just say it once more. Just don't break my heart apart. But you you're gonna help lie. Every night it's the same old routine. Spray your favorite cologne. You say you like it on me. That's when I head to the spot. Take out a couple of g's. And now I feel like the man. They got they eyes on me. Don't even need to request. They already know what my question is. I must say I'm impressed the way you already undressed for me. Take a taste of you slowly when I hold you next to me. When you touch my lips it's like you take all the stress from me. Feel the warmth in my chest. I love it, let it all burn through. It's like you know me best and you're the one that I turn to. When my head starts spinning it's when I come to my senses. Like who the fuck am I kidding. Every man in this building's sayin'. Oh, sweet jameson. Oh sweet what, (sweet, sweet) ohh sweet, jameson).

luckiest man,"I didn't know know. Until I saw you run. That perfect glow glow. It wasn't from the sun. Where do I go go. When I have no light. Cause you were my sunshine. When you were here here. I felt like I could fly. But now I fear fear. To look up at the sky. And it's so clear clear. That I need you around around. Since you've been gone. I've been falling apart. Walking around with a hole in my heart. Didn't realize who I was till I lost you girl. I was the luckiest man in the world. The luckiest man in the world. In love with a beautiful girl. I was luckier when you were around. But my luck just ran out. I had the world had the world. In the palm of myhands. Had a girl, had a girl. Who would die for her man. How can I live when my life's just running away. What is the point now. I was wrong, I was wrong. For feeding you lies. And you were strong so strong. But it kills you to fight. And now you're gone so gone. And my luck went away away. Since you've been gone. I've been falling apart. Walking around with a hole in my heart. Didn't realize who I was till I lost you girl. I was the luckiest man in the world. The luckiest man in the world. In love with a beautiful girl. I was luckier when you were around. But my luck just ran out. Waste of time. Both yours and mine. What a waste of all those white lies. If I could tell you one last lie. I'd say I'm doing just fine. Now that you're gone girl I'm falling apart. Walking around with a hole in my heart. Didn't realize who I was till I lost you girl. I was the luckiest man in the world. Since you've been gone. I've been falling apart. Walking around with a hole in my heart. Didn't realize who I was till I lost you girl. I was the luckiest man in the world. The luckiest man in the world. In love with a beautiful girl. I was luckier when you were around.

man's world,Well here's a story of a different kinda love. With the views of a man. Who's confused and had enough. When a girl he thought he knew. Wasn't all he bought into. She tried to make him. The man that she always wanted to. Thinking back to the first few days. You used to say you didn't mind my age. So I was younger it didn't mean a thing. Now I've got a feeling I'm a puppet on a string. You thought it was cute how my jeans would sag. And how u used to laugh when I talked in slang. Now the same things you despise. I can tell when out in public how you roll your eyes. [Chorus]. You almost had me in the palm of your hand girl. (Need to be alone). Cos all you see is a boy in a mans world. (Find a place to go). You almost had me in the palm of your hand girl. (That I could call my own). Cos all you see is a boy in a mans world. (Won't you let me Rhome). I'm a student but you work full time. Which means I'm over drawn but you knew that mind. And now your moaning I don't pay the rent. So you lie about my job in front all of your friends. Truth be told I don't know no more. If I can tell you everything I've learnt. For sure. About how you think it'd go like this. [Laugh] I think you catch my drift. [Chorus]. Well here is a story of. A different kinda love. With the views of a man. Who's confused. I wasn't man enough not mature enough. Comes a time when a mans gotta choose. I can't take this shit won't take this shit. Don't you cry cos it's not any use. Was this all a game under ball and chain. Look at me this is me cutting loose. [Chorus]

Fat boy had to keep her warm. Kept a paintbrush, studying The Art of War. Mr. Brainwash into my favorite song. I run with cash money. But you know my money long. I'm so high. I'm wasted, I don't wanna come down. Let me take you to Mars, girl. We'll make love on a star, girl. I'm so high. I'm wasted, I don't wanna come down. Let me take you to Mars, girl.

And maybe its true (may be its true) im caught up on you. Maybe there's a chance that you're stuck on me too. Maybe im wrong its all,in my head. Maybe we're awaiting words we both hadnt said.

Just can't help wondering why you play it cool but see I'm hopelessly falling for you. (verse 4). Every night on the phone and I flirt with you and I know you that you like it girl, all joking aside, what say you and i,come out and say what we're trying to hide.. (chorus).

me against myself,"Jay Sean vs Jay Sean. Me against myself. and there aint no chorus. so just listen. m-m-m-mentor. oh girl. you look so beautiful. with that moonlight shining on you. i wanna hold you. i wanna touch you and squeeza you and love you all night long, babygirl. Yo, i've heard it before, so save all the cliches, i really can't belieive there's no talent. around theses days, jay sean with the same old shit, talkin' about baby girl that and babygirl. this, i seen you dancin' around with the girl in your vid, poutin' at the camera, smilin' with. the chessiest grin, what the deal?, whatever happened to keepin' it real?, back in the day when. you was rappin' before the time of your deal (uh). and now that you got signed, oh it's clear and it's simple, you're only makin' music that you. pretend that you're into, come on, ""dance with you"" was never a hit fool, and what the hell is. takin' you so long with your next single?!. Fix up! it's been about six months and insults are everywhere, even your own fans think your. shit sucks (i don't like jay sean) And i know that you pretend to ignore them, it's gotta hurt. when you're even gettin' dissed on your own forum! Yeah i've done my reseach, back when you. started fool, back when people thought you was the genuine article, genuine my arse, it's just a. whack imitation, the only thing different about you, is the fact that your asian!. (Well well) Well i guess it must've helped a bit, the fact that everything has an asian twist,. includin' music, i guess we cornered it, i'm surprised that simon cowell hadn't thought of it,. and there's issues that i find myself placed with, bein' pigeon-holed and accused of imitating,. it's a struggle and it's so frustrating tellin' me i'm tryna be the asian craig david. and i bet that just had your in tears, wasn't that the reason you ended up shavin' your beard?!. i guess you couldn't take the way that people would mock that, so it was off with the jaw line. and goodbye to the sock hat, but you still bit your style with the fast singin' of verse two in. ""dance with you"" now you wonder why the critics slander you. Well you said you done your research baby, you didn't look hard enough it needs updating, if you. think, that i'm copying craig, listen to my 1994 demo tape, i was fast rapping , and singin' back. in the day, back in the fu-schnickens and Big L phase. Whatever, it seems you sold your sold to the game, your a fake, 'cos jay sean aint even your. name, so how'd you come up with that? it aint unique after all, what are you like a cross between. jay-z and sean paul? you're better off with the name you was born, you little pansy, you really. should've been called gay porn, so which ones your lover? richi Rich? or Juggy D? probably Rishi,. he sees you as his bitch doesn't he? wasn't he the one responsible for launchin' you career? like. a while ago, i'm talkin' like well over a year, you were studyin' medicine then, but you quit. that now, to do music, how the hell did you manage to flip that round? and how'd you tell your. parents, you know how shit that sounds?! ""Mummy, Daddy, I want to be a postar! SIT BACK DOWN..!!"". But never the less, i quit went ahead and progressed, had my eyes on a goal and wouldn't settle. for less. What d'you mean? you only got where you are cos of a gimmick! the whole indian thing was big and. you were luckily in it, and don't be upset if people don't come to your shows, they're not. allowed out, 'cos half your fans are 11 year olds, Wow big deal, so you got to number 12, i'm not. surprised if your mum bought half the copies herself, you know what? i'm tired man, i'm sick i'm. bored of you, run off you little puppet, i hear Rishi rich callin' you. I guess your talkin' the talk, but you aint rappin for years, and it was me who got ya foot in. the door, it seems that your ego's been sufffering blows, 'cos you only get heard when you guest. appear on my show, i'm not phased, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't be on this track in the. first place!"

stolen,"You were my eyes when I couldn't see. You were my air when I couldn't breathe. I think you always knew what you meant to me. And you were my strength when I was down.

You left me thinking I'd be alright. Won't you come back to me. It's crazy but I'm falling apart. It's crazy how you're leaving me scarred. It's crazy girl wherever you are. You stole my heart. It's crazy but I'm going insane. Feeling lost, confused and ashamed. It's crazy hope you're feeling my pain. You stole my heart. Stolen. Just like a moment. Stolen. You never owned it. Stolen. You took away my heart. I was feeling lost in my own world. Neglecting your needs and your wants girl. If only we could try again once more. Now it's the same sad story that we all know. How lovers make mistakes watch it all blow. I don't wanna be the one to let it all go, no. Where were you when I was alright. Tell me, did you know I was alright. You left me thinking I'd be alright. Won't you come back to me. It's crazy but I'm falling apart. It's crazy how you're leaving me scarred. It's crazy girl wherever you are. You stole my heart. It's crazy but I'm going insane.

And no man can live without blood running through his veins. And it's hard to remember the summer now here is rain. I don't how much longer that I can wait. It's a thin line between love and hate. It's crazy but I'm falling apart (girl it's crazy). It's crazy how you're leaving me scarred (leaving me scarred). It's crazy girl wherever you are (tell me where are you, where are you). You stole my heart. Its crazy but I'm going insane (going insane). Feeling lost, confused and ashamed. It's crazy hope you're feeling my pain (are you feeling my, feeling my pain).

stop cryin your heart out,"Ain't like we planned it, I don't really understand it. Communication is breaking like we on two different planets. Two different axis thinking back on all my actions. Hoping and wishing I could just grab time and force it backwards It ain't like I really wanted this, when I said I wanted this. Looking back I guess you were my real accomplishment. I done some dumb shit since and now I'm functionless. And though my words never said it right now my conscious is. Talking back to me, how can we make it better. I probably do whatever it takes to her to let up. And never make another mistake, if I could tell her. Not to forget us. Cause all of the stars are fading away. Try not to worry, you'll see them some day. So take what you need and be on your way. And stop cryin' your heart out. Stop cryin' your heart out. We sure were somethin', we had thoughts that we would function. Hated fighting in public, all your friends making assumptions. Since when did we fall victim to the talk of people. All that shit talk in your ear just made it fuckin' hard to breath. Oh it ain't like I really wanted this, I never wanted this. But on the real though I messed up and broke some promises. Like Keyshia Cole sees it, I might as well have cheated. I pushed myself away from the one I should have been with. May your smile, shine all. Don't be scared, your destiny may keep you on. Cause all of the stars are fading away. Try not to worry, you'll see them some day. So take what you need and be on your way. And stop cryin' your heart out. Stop cryin' your heart out"

walking alone,"I'm tired of trying to sail this. Troubled boat again. Trying hard to find a way. For though blows me all the same. And I'm tired of holding on. When there's nothing more to gain. I'd rather stand here on the dock. And watch it all just sail away. This sail has no wind. The wind has no sea. The sea has no shore anymore. I'm walking these streets all by myself. I know its my fault, and no one else. And there's nobody here to save me. I'm walking alone. And if I look lonely, that's alright. Cause I'm the only one left in my life. And there's no one to save me. I'm walking alone. In a word that lives in graces. I'm a grain amongst the sand. I never took the time to get to know. The person that i am. And maybe I was just caught up. Up in the race and so I'd run. And i hadn't even stop. To see the man that I've become. Dont you know. This sail has no wind. The wind has no sea. My sea has no shore anymore. I'm walking these streets all by myself. I know its my fault, and no one else. And there's nobody here to save me. I'm walking alone. And if I look lonely, that's alright. Cause I'm the only one left in my life. And there's no one to save me. I'm walking alone. It ain't like it's over, I haven't thrown it all away. And i won't just stop living over my own mistakes. And i just needed time for a moment to stand. So that I can just see who it is that I am. I'm walking these streets all by myself. I know its my fault, and no one else. And there's nobody here to save me. I'm walking alone. And if I look lonely, that's alright. Cause I'm the only one left in my life. And there's no one to save me. I'm walking alone. I'm walking these streets all by myself. I know its my fault, and no one else. And there's nobody here to save me. I'm walking alone.

war,"I would march across the desert to defeat my enemy. And I would lie here in the trenches with your picture next to me. And when I told you it's forever, then it's how it's gonna be.

And I will show you victory is mine before we leave this battleground. Cause he don't wanna leave, and I don't wanna go. And I know just how this battle goes. He don't wanna leave and I don't wanna fight this kind of war. You know he's not the man you think he is; he's hiding all his flaws. So tell me what's the point of fighting? Because we'll all end up with scars. But girl if that's what I must go through, then I'm not prepared to lose. Cause I've already bled so much for you (No...).

He don't wanna leave and I don't wanna fight this kind of war. You know he's not the man you think he is; he's hiding all his flaws. So tell me what's the point of fighting? Because we'll all end up with scars. But girl if that's what I must go through, then I'm not prepared to lose. Cause I've already bled so much for you (No...).

i used to love her,"I was crazy man you wouldn't believe what I seen. Got me reminiscing down too much memories. The only girl you know that in my heart. The one I almost gave that ring. But we were so young, mustve been only nineteen. I guess the time wasn't right and we said some mean things. A bitter day when I saw her face. She was the one that I let get away. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. There was talkin' in the room that everythings good. There was no love lost between us I couldn't. Believe how I truly noticed now that I wasn't over her. And now I'm like oh damn cause now I know man. Lookin' back at all our pictures while I'm playing slow jamz. What can I say, is that the way our situation worked out. Wish there was something I could do. Like stop the clock just lookin. Go back and revisit our relationship and start brand new. And do the things that I didn't do. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. Man I know it's crazy. She pulled me back with just a smile. Now I feel these things inside. I havent felt em' in a while. And I'm sure that they will go away just a little time. She'll always be that girl to me. But now I gotta let her see. I used to love her..."
come with me,"When I wake up in the morning I see. Everybody's looking at me. Whispering and talking, pointin fingers at me. What is it that they want me to be. Can't keep up this fight no more. Won't keep up this fight no more. So I run to my world, (my world) my world. Where I can do what I want and be free to be myself. I gotta run to my world, my world. Coz I aint comfortable with trying to be somebody else. [Chorus:]. I gotta get away from this crazy life. Get away from the hype. Get away from this two and two makes five. Take a look beyond what they see. Maybe you will realise. So come with me. On my roller-coaster ride. When you go to sleep at night you dream. Of all the things you've always wanted to be. But when you wake up in the morning you see. That everything is out of your reach. Can't keep up this fight no more. Won't keep up this fight no more. [Chorus]. Let me show you all the things you don't see. Come with me. If you don't already know. This life you see is so different on the inside. If you. Come with me. So let me know. [Chorus]"

Well you said you done your research baby, you didn't look hard enough it needs updating, if you. think, that i'm copying craig, listen to my 1994 demo tape, i was fast rapping , and singin' back. in the day, back in the fu-schnickens and Big L phase. Whatever, it seems you sold your sold to the game, your a fake, 'cos jay sean aint even your. name, so how'd you come up with that? it aint unique after all, what are you like a cross between. jay-z and sean paul? you're better off with the name you was born, you little pansy, you really. should've been called gay porn, so which ones your lover? richi Rich? or Juggy D? probably Rishi,. he sees you as his bitch doesn't he? wasn't he the one responsible for launchin' you career? like. a while ago, i'm talkin' like well over a year, you were studyin' medicine then, but you quit. that now, to do music, how the hell did you manage to flip that round? and how'd you tell your. parents, you know how shit that sounds?! ""Mummy, Daddy, I want to be a postar! SIT BACK DOWN..!!"". But never the less, i quit went ahead and progressed, had my eyes on a goal and wouldn't settle. for less. What d'you mean? you only got where you are cos of a gimmick! the whole indian thing was big and. you were luckily in it, and don't be upset if people don't come to your shows, they're not. allowed out, 'cos half your fans are 11 year olds, Wow big deal, so you got to number 12, i'm not. surprised if your mum bought half the copies herself, you know what? i'm tired man, i'm sick i'm. bored of you, run off you little puppet, i hear Rishi rich callin' you. I guess your talkin' the talk, but you aint rappin for years, and it was me who got ya foot in. the door, it seems that your ego's been sufffering blows, 'cos you only get heard when you guest. appear on my show, i'm not phased, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't be on this track in the. first place!"
all or nothing,"Verse1. There wasn't anything I didn't love about u,. You'd do some stupid things and I'd laugh at those too,. & we went together like the summer in june. But who'd have known that it'd rain so soon. Thought I'd be the only one that'd make u smile,. Thought I'd be the only one that'd really know how. But u showed me different and I know better now,. I gotta get u out my system somehow. Chorus. I replay it over and over again. U were my girl, now we 'aint even friends,. U couldve been my all or nothing, all or nothing,. Now to me ur nothing, girl u r nothing, now ur nothing. Verse 2. Put u on a pedestal, girl I held u so high. Was never too good at finding the words to describe,. Just how I felt for u but u know that I tried,. But somehow we went and changed inside. U damn near were my everything ur still on my mind,. But I'd rather be here all alone and I'm doin just fine. Gotta take it back to the days before we met. And live our lives as strangers again. Chorus. I replay it over and over again. U were my girl, now we 'aint even friends,.

When u went away - I can't help but wonder. Was he worth my pain - u shud know better -. And I should've too. And I cried, and u cried and we tried to make it work,. Almost died while we tried, is that what our love was worth,. If I cud do it again, I would be a better man,. Now I'm living with just memories. Chorus. I replay it over and over again. U were my girl, now we 'aint even friends,. U couldve been my all or nothing, all or nothing,. Now to me ur nothing, girl u r nothing, now ur nothing. I replay it over and over again.

bricks,"I'm tired of trying to sail this. Troubled boat again. Trying hard to find a way. For though blows me all the same. And I'm tired of holding on. When there's nothing more to gain.

I know its my fault, and no one else. And there's nobody here to save me. I'm walking alone. And if I look lonely, that's alright. Cause I'm the only one left in my life. And there's no one to save me. I'm walking alone. In a word that lives in graces. I'm a grain amongst the sand. I never took the time to get to know. The person that I am. And maybe I was just caught up. Up in the race and so I'd run. And I hadn't even stop. To see the man that I've become. This sail has no wind. This wind has no sail. The sea has no shore anymore.

And I just needed time for a moment to stand. So that I can just see who it is that I am. ohh ohhh. walking alone. I'm walking these streets all by myself. I know its my fault, and no one else.

don't rush,"It's been a while since the last time that I saw you girl. Why is it that you just run away. What is it that you don't wanna say. See girl I know your type. Never can seem to just settle down. Coz you're in search of those butterflies. Isn't that why you keep walking in and out of my life. I won't complain, if you won't stay. Go ahead and play those games. Coz I know that in time no doubt. You'll come around. But just for now. [Chorus:]. Baby don't you rush. Girl we got the whole night. Touch caress and make love all night. Take it take it from me. Wake me before you leave [x2]. I don't know, is it me? Am I imagining?. Tell me girl, don't you feel anything?. When you're here lying beside of me. And now you're telling me. That it's late and you just gotta go. Why is it that you only wanna leave. At the point that you think that you might be falling in love. I won't complain. If you won't stay. Go ahead and play those games. [Chorus (x2) ]. Baby don't you rush. Girl we got the whole night. Touch caress and make love all night. Take it take it from me. Wake me before you leave [x2]. Something in the way you walk. When you go and turn your back on me. Tell me what you're trying to prove. When you get your things and leave. You can try to hide the truth. I don't buy the things you say. I know you'll be back again. That's why I'm never standing in your way. [Chorus (x6) ]. Baby don't you rush. Girl we got the whole night. Touch caress and make love all night. Take it take it from me. Wake me before you leave [x2]"

girlfriend,You and I have been chilling for a while now. Never knowing where this thing is gonna end. Will it be another kind of love thing. Or shall we stop and say we'll just be friends.

You got everything I need. And even though you got a man at home girl. You know your love is meant for me. So baby come on now. And take a little time to think it through. Why would u stay with a man. Who just don't understand. What it takes to be with you. We can't have your boyfriend...hanging around. Coz I can't go on like this...playing around. What's it gonna be. Is it him or me. Coz we can't have your boyfriend...hanging around. How can I turn and walk away now. And regret forever what I left behind. Knowing that deep inside my heart girl. You were made for me though you're not mine. Started off as just a little fun though. We thought that we would never cross the line. But now I'm crazy over you. Coz you can settle for his loving. Or you can start a life with me. And even though I know he saw you first girl. It don't mean a thing to me. I know it ain't easy. And you need a little time to think it through. Why would you stay with a man. Who just don't understand. What it takes to be with you. We can't have your boyfriend...hanging around. Coz I can't go on like this...playing around. What's it gonna be. Is it him or me. Coz we can't have your boyfriend...hanging around

When there's all of them and one of me. Chorus. How can I change a million minds in this lifetime. What is it I have to do. If I erase my history - what defines me. If I let them change the truth. Would I be Good Enough For You ?. Verse 2. I wish they looked at me and they could see beyond. Everything think they think I am. Cos pedigree don't make a man. Don't have to dig too deep to see I'm just like you. What is it they want from me - tell me what more can I prove- Why-. So many cant understand, when it comes you and I. I Don't fit in their descriptions - though I try. To change those old traditions. When its all of them and one of me. (I could lie I could lie I could lie). Let them take all I knew. Would I be good enough for you. Midde 8. We pretend we have open minds. Yet we judge so fast. Tell me why - to live out my future - yeah. I must surrender my past. Chorus"

Fire away without a clue. Of how much is really hurting you. So baby go ahead and take your aim at me again. Cause I'm okay with war if love is how it ends. The way that you say sorry. And put those lips on me. It ain't gon be picture perfect. But what it is. Is guns n roses. We're guns n roses. You can throw a bomb my way. For every time I make mistakes. But you know that'd never break what we built. And baby that makeup sex. Makes all of this pain worth it. So I'll fight with you over and over again. So baby go ahead and take your aim at me again.

holding on,How'd I let it get this far. What was going through my mind. Why'd you seem to have it all. Yet you're not mine. Started off as just good friends. Still we overstepped the line. Coz falling for you was so easy. Ohh... You're everything I want. You're everything I need. You're everything I want my girl to be. And even though I know. You're in someone else's heart. I can't bare to be apart. See I've fallen for you. And I've gotta let you go. And I know that I have got to. Find a way to get on with my life. I don't wanna let you go (let you go). But it's killing me inside (inside). How can I just carry on. I need some peace of mind (need some peace of mind). How do I just move along (along). And ignore the love so strong (so strong). So until I see this through. I'll be holding on to you. To you... baby.... Throughout the years with her I've tried. To find the joy beyond the pain. But when the words and tears subside. Girl it's still the same. And I can't look into her eyes. Without thinking about you. See I've tried but these feelings won't leave me. No..... You're everything I want. You're everything I dream. You're everything I want my girl to be. And even though I know. You're in someone else's arms. I can't bare to be apart. See girl I fell for you. And I don't wanna say goodbye.

It's everything about you. And it doesn't get any, any better than this. It's the little things 'bout you that I know that I'd miss. From the moment I saw you, I couldn't resist. And I don't think I'll ever get over you. It doesn't get any better than this. No, no, no, no. Not over you and me. And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. What I would do without you. It ain't just the one thing girl, no. It's everything about you. And it doesn't get any, any better than this, no. It's the little things 'bout you that I know that I'd miss. From the moment I saw you, I couldn't resist. And I don't think I'll ever get over you. It doesn't get any better than this"
i used to love her,"I was crazy man you wouldn't believe what I seen. Got me reminiscing down too much memories. The only girl you know that in my heart. The one I almost gave that ring. But we were so young, mustve been only nineteen. I guess the time wasn't right and we said some mean things. A bitter day when I saw her face. She was the one that I let get away. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. There was talkin' in the room that everythings good. There was no love lost between us I couldn't. Believe how I truly noticed now that I wasn't over her. And now I'm like oh damn cause now I know man. Lookin' back at all our pictures while I'm playing slow jamz. What can I say, is that the way our situation worked out. Wish there was something I could do. Like stop the clock just lookin. Go back and revisit our relationship and start brand new. And do the things that I didn't do. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. I remember when I used to love her, used to love her, used to love her. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. The time goes on, goes on, goes on. Man I know it's crazy. She pulled me back with just a smile. Now I feel these things inside. I havent felt em' in a while. And I'm sure that they will go away just a little time. She'll always be that girl to me. But now I gotta let her see. I used to love her..."

interlude (irony skit),"Yo Mental. If I had to count the number of times. people have asked me the old asian thing. is it a fad or is it gonna last?. I mean bro you know me n you been doing this time back. they werent ready then. and now they're all asking me like ahh man!. Am tired of hearing the same things. and saying the same words that answer. the same questions chatting my own world. I'm tired of sounding bitter. this is so much more than just a chip on ma shoulder. See the strange thing is, better rappers. and better singers have managed. to find a need for themselves in this business. So you wouldn't think it would be hard. to distinguish a british asian brutha. who raps n sings english- wrong!. Forget the fact that I'm asian. cause they said I was a copycat- a whack imitation!. Until the media jumped on the bangaba scene. all of a sudden this seems to be an angle for me!. thas why I hear ""jay why don't you write a music. indian phrase a bit of panjabi. and soon it will be the latest craze! "". My language ain't a fad see honour. we even got craig david to say ""aaj pangra pona"". Haha! yo I don't know how long it's gona last man. Maybe I... maybe I should'nthave quit medicine. What dyu think man? mental!. AAnd that's all!"
jameson,"What is this poison that's crawlin' under my veins. Teasin' and feedin' me tales, numbin' my brain. It's pullin' me back to it. Am I that bastard that everyone's laughin' at?. When they see me trapped in your grasp. There ain't nothing that no one else can do. It's like I see a new me anytime I'm with you. But you're gonna tear my heart apart. You, you're gonna help me lie. Ohh ohh, ohh aa. (Sweet, sweet) you should've warned me baby. Ohh ohh ohh aa. (Sweet) sweet jameson. Love me in evening. And hurt me in the morning. And leave me without warning. Oh sweet jameson. Ohh sweet, (sweet, sweet). Ohh sweet, ohh sweet, ohh sweet. You was always my baby. You would come first. When I needed saving. Jaime, you were my world. I would drown in your love. Till it all becomes a blur. And I'd leave all my dignity there. Oh what a sight to see. I can't stand, but I won't fall. Just say I'm your only, just say it once more. Just don't break my heart apart. But you you're gonna help lie. Every night it's the same old routine. Spray your favorite cologne. You say you like it on me. That's when I head to the spot. Take out a couple of g's. And now I feel like the man. They got they eyes on me. Don't even need to request. They already know what my question is. I must say I'm impressed the way you already undressed for me. Take a taste of you slowly when I hold you next to me. When you touch my lips it's like you take all the stress from me. Feel the warmth in my chest. I love it, let it all burn through. It's like you know me best and you're the one that I turn to. When my head starts spinning it's when I come to my senses. Like who the fuck am I kidding. Every man in this building's sayin'. Oh, sweet jameson. Oh sweet what, (sweet, sweet) ohh sweet, jameson). Ohh sweet, ohh aah"

luckiest man,"I didn't know know. Until I saw you run. That perfect glow glow. It wasn't from the sun. Where do I go go. When I have no light. Cause you were my sunshine. When you were here here. I felt like I could fly. But now I fear fear. To look up at the sky. And it's so clear clear. That I need you around around. Since you've been gone. I've been falling apart. Walking around with a hole in my heart. Didn't realize who I was till I lost you girl. I was the luckiest man in the world. The luckiest man in the world. In love with a beautiful girl. I was luckier when you were around. But my luck just ran out. I had the world had the world. In the palm of myhands. Had a girl, had a girl. Who would die for her man. How can I live when my life's just running away. What is the point now. I was wrong, I was wrong. For feeding you lies. And you were strong so strong. But it kills you to fight. And now you're gone so gone. And my luck went away away. Since you've been gone. I've been falling apart. Walking around with a hole in my heart. Didn't realize who I was till I lost you girl. I was the luckiest man in the world. The luckiest man in the world. In love with a beautiful girl. I was luckier when you were around. But my luck just ran out. Waste of time. Both yours and mine. What a waste of all those white lies. If I could tell you one last lie. I'd say I'm doing just fine. Now that you're gone girl I'm falling apart. Walking around with a hole in my heart. Didn't realize who I was till I lost you girl. I was the luckiest man in the world. Since you've been gone. I've been falling apart. Walking around with a hole in my heart. Didn't realize who I was till I lost you girl. I was the luckiest man in the world. The luckiest man in the world. In love with a beautiful girl. I was luckier when you were around.

man's world,Well here's a story of a different kinda love. With the views of a man. Who's confused and had enough. When a girl he thought he knew. Wasn't all he bought into. She tried to make him. The man that she always wanted to. Thinking back to the first few days. You used to say you didn't mind my age. So I was younger it didn't mean a thing. Now I've got a feeling I'm a puppet on a string. You thought it was cute how my jeans would sag. And how u used to laugh when I talked in slang. Now the same things you despise. I can tell when out in public how you roll your eyes. [Chorus]. You almost had me in the palm of your hand girl. (Need to be alone). Cos all you see is a boy in a mans world. (Find a place to go). You almost had me in the palm of your hand girl. (That I could call my own). Cos all you see is a boy in a mans world. (Won't you let me Rhome). I'm a student but you work full time. Which means I'm over drawn but you knew that mind. And now your moaning I don't pay the rent. So you lie about my job in front all of your friends. Truth be told I don't know no more. If I can tell you everything I've learnt. For sure. About how you think it'd go like this. [Laugh] I think you catch my drift. [Chorus]. Well here is a story of. A different kinda love. With the views of a man. Who's confused. I wasn't man enough not mature enough. Comes a time when a mans gotta choose. I can't take this shit won't take this shit. Don't you cry cos it's not any use. Was this all a game under ball and chain. Look at me this is me cutting loose. [Chorus]

me against myself,"Jay Sean vs Jay Sean. Me against myself. and there aint no chorus. so just listen. m-m-m-mentor. oh girl. you look so beautiful. with that moonlight shining on you. i wanna hold you. i wanna touch you and squeeza you and love you all night long, babygirl. Yo, i've heard it before, so save all the cliches, i really can't belieive there's no talent. around theses days, jay sean with the same old shit, talkin' about baby girl that and babygirl. this, i seen you dancin' around with the girl in your vid, poutin' at the camera, smilin' with. the chessiest grin, what the deal?, whatever happened to keepin' it real?, back in the day when. you was rappin' before the time of your deal (uh). and now that you got signed, oh it's clear and it's simple, you're only makin' music that you. pretend that you're into, come on, ""dance with you"" was never a hit fool, and what the hell is. takin' you so long with your next single?!. Fix up! it's been about six months and insults are everywhere, even your own fans think your. shit sucks (i don't like jay sean) And i know that you pretend to ignore them, it's gotta hurt. when you're even gettin' dissed on your own forum! Yeah i've done my reseach, back when you. started fool, back when people thought you was the genuine article, genuine my arse, it's just a. whack imitation, the only thing different about you, is the fact that your asian!. (Well well) Well i guess it must've helped a bit, the fact that everything has an asian twist,. includin' music, i guess we cornered it, i'm surprised that simon cowell hadn't thought of it,. and there's issues that i find myself placed with, bein' pigeon-holed and accused of imitating,. it's a struggle and it's so frustrating tellin' me i'm tryna be the asian craig david. and i bet that just had your in tears, wasn't that the reason you ended up shavin' your beard?!. i guess you couldn't take the way that people would mock that, so it was off with the jaw line. and goodbye to the sock hat, but you still bit your style with the fast singin' of verse two in. ""dance with you"" now you wonder why the critics slander you. Well you said you done your research baby, you didn't look hard enough it needs updating, if you. think, that i'm copying craig, listen to my 1994 demo tape, i was fast rapping , and singin' back. in the day, back in the fu-schnickens and Big L phase. Whatever, it seems you sold your sold to the game, your a fake, 'cos jay sean aint even your. name, so how'd you come up with that? it aint unique after all, what are you like a cross between. jay-z and sean paul? you're better off with the name you was born, you little pansy, you really. should've been called gay porn, so which ones your lover? richi Rich? or Juggy D? probably Rishi,. he sees you as his bitch doesn't he? wasn't he the one responsible for launchin' you career? like. a while ago, i'm talkin' like well over a year, you were studyin' medicine then, but you quit. that now, to do music, how the hell did you manage to flip that round? and how'd you tell your. parents, you know how shit that sounds?! ""Mummy, Daddy, I want to be a postar! SIT BACK DOWN..!!"". But never the less, i quit went ahead and progressed, had my eyes on a goal and wouldn't settle. for less. What d'you mean? you only got where you are cos of a gimmick! the whole indian thing was big and. you were luckily in it, and don't be upset if people don't come to your shows, they're not. allowed out, 'cos half your fans are 11 year olds, Wow big deal, so you got to number 12, i'm not. surprised if your mum bought half the copies herself, you know what? i'm tired man, i'm sick i'm. bored of you, run off you little puppet, i hear Rishi rich callin' you. I guess your talkin' the talk, but you aint rappin for years, and it was me who got ya foot in. the door, it seems that your ego's been sufffering blows, 'cos you only get heard when you guest. appear on my show, i'm not phased, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't be on this track in the. first place!"

Is this how it's meant to be?. Is love just one confusing game?. And we're just pawns that don't know all the rules but play it anyway. Coz everyday's a drama, one we've seen a thousand times. Girl, to me it seems you love messing with my mind. You gotta change, you gotta try. It ain't enough and I wonder why. Coz what you want and what you need. I got the feeling it isn't me. Some other day, some other time. Maybe you and I would've been alright. It was a game, didn't know the rules. Now it's left me torn in two. [Chorus]. Get away, get away from me. Girl, won't you just sail away, yeah. Get away, get away from me. Coz I don't love you no longer, no longer"

passenger side,"Back-backing up. Pa-passenger side. The many nights and many days that you forgot to miss. Lived the back when I was broke but I was hard to piss. I used to drop you hall and leave you from a distance. Could you fathom like the fact that I was so different?. You had a lot of friends, some of them got a Benz. You had a whole lotta wander, just never had it. But I had something they could only ever dream. They roaring out at you, and it was always what it never been. We had that real shit, used to going bad. Yeah it made me bad. And now I'm screaming at you. And I'd be hitting on and then fucking. And now they see me. Wish I never had these feelings. Girl I just saw you. Pa-pass the new girl. Pa-pass the new life. Pa-pass moves gone. Called the dibs of you from the corner of my eye. There used to be me by life. There used to be you my side.

But I don't need a drink, I need some time in my car. Time to drive and think. Time to park and cry. You should've know you are beautiful. You should've know what I saw in ya. Please forgive me for feelin' like it's all your fault. A heavy heart can't carry blame for the loss. And who knows, maybe I'm crazy. That's one big maybe. But even a fool knows when it's gone, gone, gone. You might not know this, but I'm a man with pride. And it hurts me baby, deep down deep down. And I can't let go of this, you gotta know I've tried. It's pathetic baby, don't lie, don't lie. I'm a candle, you're the sun, and you're burnin' baby. Said you're burnin' baby. (Burnin' up, burnin' up). Burnin' like the sun you got me burnin' up.

stop cryin your heart out,"Ain't like we planned it, I don't really understand it. Communication is breaking like we on two different planets. Two different axis thinking back on all my actions. Hoping and wishing I could just grab time and force it backwards It ain't like I really wanted this, when I said I wanted this. Looking back I guess you were my real accomplishment. I done some dumb shit since and now I'm functionless. And though my words never said it right now my conscious is. Talking back to me, how can we make it better. I probably do whatever it takes to her to let up. And never make another mistake, if I could tell her. Not to forget us. Cause all of the stars are fading away. Try not to worry, you'll see them some day. So take what you need and be on your way. And stop cryin' your heart out. Stop cryin' your heart out. We sure were somethin', we had thoughts that we would function. Hated fighting in public, all your friends making assumptions. Since when did we fall victim to the talk of people. All that shit talk in your ear just made it fuckin' hard to breath. Oh it ain't like I really wanted this, I never wanted this. But on the real though I messed up and broke some promises. Like Keyshia Cole sees it, I might as well have cheated. I pushed myself away from the one I should have been with. May your smile, shine all. Don't be scared, your destiny may keep you on.

walking alone,"I'm tired of trying to sail this. Troubled boat again. Trying hard to find a way. For though blows me all the same. And I'm tired of holding on. When there's nothing more to gain. I'd rather stand here on the dock. And watch it all just sail away. This sail has no wind. The wind has no sea. The sea has no shore anymore. I'm walking these streets all by myself. I know its my fault, and no one else. And there's nobody here to save me. I'm walking alone. And if I look lonely, that's alright. Cause I'm the only one left in my life. And there's no one to save me. I'm walking alone. In a word that lives in graces. I'm a grain amongst the sand. I never took the time to get to know. The person that i am. And maybe I was just caught up. Up in the race and so I'd run. And i hadn't even stop. To see the man that I've become. Dont you know. This sail has no wind. The wind has no sea. My sea has no shore anymore. I'm walking these streets all by myself. I know its my fault, and no one else. And there's nobody here to save me. I'm walking alone. And if I look lonely, that's alright. Cause I'm the only one left in my life. And there's no one to save me. I'm walking alone. It ain't like it's over, I haven't thrown it all away. And i won't just stop living over my own mistakes. And i just needed time for a moment to stand. So that I can just see who it is that I am. I'm walking these streets all by myself. I know its my fault, and no one else. And there's nobody here to save me. I'm walking alone. And if I look lonely, that's alright. Cause I'm the only one left in my life.

It's never lady forever. Where do we go. Where do we go. See, girl, I need to know. See, girl, I need to know. See, girl, I don't know where. Girl I really need it. See, baby, won't you break it down. Said I'm so so tired (where do we go?). See girl I need to know (where do we go?). See baby won't you break it down (where do we go?). Oh baby won't you tell me. Where do we go. Where do we go"
where you are,"Yeah, yea, ye, yo, yo. Do you know the feeling. When sometimes you wake up young. And sometimes you wake up old. And sometimes you're so in love. And do you know the feeling. When their love just comes undone. And I can't figure it out. That something's got me unlocked, but you're my baby. There were some times I put up a fight. But when something is right, you know that is right. And I don't wanna think, it's simple to me, you're the one. And baby that's why.... And I cant help it, I gotta be where you are. Like the sky holding the stars. Like the strings on my guitar. I wanna be where you are. Like the sand that's on the beach. Like a model in a magazine. It don't mean a thing, if we're apart. I wanna be where you are. Where you are, where you are. And baby that's why I wanna be where you are. And baby everytime you're around. You're the one that always holds me down. And don't even ask for a thing, no. You make a real win. Even when things ain't perfect. You're the one that keeps the fire burning. And that's the reason why, I ain't leaving. And I can't help it, I gotta be where you are. Like the sky holding the stars. Like the strings on my guitar. I wanna be where you are. Like the sand that's on the beach. Like a model in a magazine. It don't mean a thing, if we're apart. I wanna be where you are. Where you are, where you are. And that's it baby I wanna be where you are. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. I wanna be with you. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Baby I wanna be with you. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Oh yeah babe. I gotta be. I gotta be with you baby. And I can't help it, I gotta be where you are. Like the sky holding the stars. Like the strings on my guitar. I wanna be where you are. Like the sand that's on the beach. Like a model in a magazine. It don't mean a thing, if we're apart. I wanna be where you are. Where you are, where you are, where you are. Said I wanna be where you are"
why cry,"I see a face in the mirror that I just don't like. But I gotta keep telling myself that it's alright. Cuz now I know that there's no sense in me cryin cuz momma said I'm not like you.
