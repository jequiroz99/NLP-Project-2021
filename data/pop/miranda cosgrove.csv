beautiful mess,I feel crazy while you seem sane. I saw lightning but you just see rain. I hear music that's my heart being played. In your shadow I fade. It's a beautiful mess you made. You've had your fun and games. I love you. To you that means so much less. You're like the tear in my brand new dress. It's a beautiful mess. The rush remains as I watch you go.

To you that means so much less. You're like the tear in my brand new dress. It's a beautiful mess. It was an innocent mistake to waste my time on you. When they tell you not to go there. Don't care and you do. In your shadow I fade. It's a beautiful mess you made. You've had your fun and games. I love you. To you that means so much less. You're like the tear in my brand new dress.

christmas wrapping,"Bah, humbug!"" No, that's too strong. 'Cause it is my favorite holiday. But all this year's been a busy blur. Don't think I have the energy. To add to my already mad rush. Just 'cause it's 'tis the season.. The perfect gift for me would be. Completions and connections left from. Last year, ski shop,. Encounter, most interesting.. Had his number but never the time. Most of '81 passed along those lines.. So deck those halls, trim those trees. Raise up cups of Christmas cheer,. I just need to catch my breath,. Christmas by myself this year.. Calendar picture, frozen landscape,. Chilled this room for twenty-four days,. Evergreens, sparkling snow. Get this winter over with!. Flashback to springtime, saw him again,. Would've been good to go for lunch,. Couldn't agree when we were both free,. We tried, we said we'd keep in touch.. Didn't, of course, 'til summertime,. Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?. No, this time it was me,. Sunburn in the third degree.. Now the calendar's just one page. And, of course, I am excited. Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind. Not to do too much about it.. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year.. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year.. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year.. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year.. Hardly dashing through the snow. Cause I bundled up too tight. Last minute have-to-do's. A few cards a few calls. 'Cause it's r-s-v-p. No thanks, no party lights. It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax. Turned down all of my invites.. Last fall I had a night to myself,. Same guy called, halloween party,. Waited all night for him to show,. This time his car wouldn't go,. Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late,. Trudge on home to celebrate. In a quiet way, unwind. Doing Christmas right this time.. A&P has provided me. with the world's smallest turkey. already in the oven, nice and hot. Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?. So on with the boots, back out in the snow. To the only all-night grocery,. When what to my wondering eyes should appear. In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!. ""I'm spending this one alone,"" he said.. ""Need a break; this year's been crazy."". I said, ""Me too, but why are you?. You mean you forgot cranberries too?"". Then suddenly we laughed and laughed. Caught on to what was happening. That Christmas magic's brought this tale. To a very happy ending! "". Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. Couldn't miss this one this year!. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. Couldn't miss this one this year!"
coming home,"I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming home. Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes. I'm coming home, I'm coming home. Tell the world that I'm coming. Back where I belong. Teah I never felt so strong. (I'm back baby). I feel like there's nothing that I can't try. and if you with me put your hands high. (put your hands high). If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you. And you, the dreams are for you. I hear ""The Tears of a Clown"". I hate that song. I feel like they talking to me when it comes on. Another day another dawn. Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math I'm gone. What am I s'posed to do when the club lights come on. It's easy to be Puff, it's harder to be Sean. What if the twins ask why I ain't marry their mom. (why, damn!). How do I respond?. What if my son stares with a face like my own. And says he wants to be like me when he's grown. Damn!. But I ain't finished growing. Another night the inevitible prolongs. Another day another dawn. Just tell Keisha and Taresha I'll be better in the morn'. Another lie that I carry on. I need to get back to the place I belong. ""A house is Not a Home"", I hate this song. Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone. And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it. And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it. But you felt it and still feel it. And money can't make up for it or conceal it. But you deal with it and you keep ballin'. Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'. Baby, we've been living in sin. 'Cause we've been really in love. But we've been living as friends. So you've been a guest in your own home. It's time to make your house your home. Pick up your phone, come on. ""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song. Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong. I thought I told y'all that we won't stop. We back cruising through Harlem, Viso blocks. It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy. Drove me away then embraced me. Forgave me for all of my shortcomings. Welcome to my homecoming. Yeah it's been a long time coming. Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles. Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs. Made it back, lost my dog. (I miss you BIG). And here I stand, a better man!. (a better man). Thank you Lord. (Thank you Lord)"

charlie,"No, oh, no, Charlie, no. Oh, no. All the time you wonder why. People always tell you that you're so strange. You hide a funny face behind. The head of hair you'll never get what they say.

christmas wrapping,"Bah, humbug!"" No, that's too strong. 'Cause it is my favorite holiday. But all this year's been a busy blur. Don't think I have the energy. To add to my already mad rush. Just 'cause it's 'tis the season.. The perfect gift for me would be. Completions and connections left from. Last year, ski shop,. Encounter, most interesting.. Had his number but never the time. Most of '81 passed along those lines.. So deck those halls, trim those trees. Raise up cups of Christmas cheer,. I just need to catch my breath,. Christmas by myself this year.. Calendar picture, frozen landscape,. Chilled this room for twenty-four days,. Evergreens, sparkling snow. Get this winter over with!. Flashback to springtime, saw him again,. Would've been good to go for lunch,. Couldn't agree when we were both free,. We tried, we said we'd keep in touch.. Didn't, of course, 'til summertime,. Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?. No, this time it was me,. Sunburn in the third degree.. Now the calendar's just one page. And, of course, I am excited. Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind. Not to do too much about it.. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year.. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year.. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year.. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year.. Hardly dashing through the snow. Cause I bundled up too tight. Last minute have-to-do's. A few cards a few calls. 'Cause it's r-s-v-p. No thanks, no party lights. It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax. Turned down all of my invites.. Last fall I had a night to myself,. Same guy called, halloween party,. Waited all night for him to show,. This time his car wouldn't go,. Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late,. Trudge on home to celebrate. In a quiet way, unwind. Doing Christmas right this time.. A&P has provided me. with the world's smallest turkey. already in the oven, nice and hot. Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?. So on with the boots, back out in the snow. To the only all-night grocery,. When what to my wondering eyes should appear. In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!. ""I'm spending this one alone,"" he said.. ""Need a break; this year's been crazy."". I said, ""Me too, but why are you?. You mean you forgot cranberries too?"". Then suddenly we laughed and laughed. Caught on to what was happening. That Christmas magic's brought this tale. To a very happy ending! "". Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. Couldn't miss this one this year!. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. Couldn't miss this one this year!"
coming home,"I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming home. Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes. I'm coming home, I'm coming home. Tell the world that I'm coming. Back where I belong. Teah I never felt so strong. (I'm back baby). I feel like there's nothing that I can't try. and if you with me put your hands high. (put your hands high). If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you. And you, the dreams are for you. I hear ""The Tears of a Clown"". I hate that song. I feel like they talking to me when it comes on. Another day another dawn. Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math I'm gone. What am I s'posed to do when the club lights come on. It's easy to be Puff, it's harder to be Sean. What if the twins ask why I ain't marry their mom. (why, damn!). How do I respond?. What if my son stares with a face like my own. And says he wants to be like me when he's grown. Damn!. But I ain't finished growing. Another night the inevitible prolongs. Another day another dawn. Just tell Keisha and Taresha I'll be better in the morn'. Another lie that I carry on. I need to get back to the place I belong. ""A house is Not a Home"", I hate this song. Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone. And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it. And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it. But you felt it and still feel it. And money can't make up for it or conceal it. But you deal with it and you keep ballin'. Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'. Baby, we've been living in sin. 'Cause we've been really in love. But we've been living as friends. So you've been a guest in your own home. It's time to make your house your home. Pick up your phone, come on. ""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song. Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong. I thought I told y'all that we won't stop. We back cruising through Harlem, Viso blocks. It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy. Drove me away then embraced me. Forgave me for all of my shortcomings. Welcome to my homecoming. Yeah it's been a long time coming. Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles. Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs. Made it back, lost my dog. (I miss you BIG). And here I stand, a better man!. (a better man). Thank you Lord. (Thank you Lord)"
