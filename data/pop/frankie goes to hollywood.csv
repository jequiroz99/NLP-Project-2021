one night in bangkok,"Music & Lyrics : Benny Anderson - Tim Rice - Bjsrn Ulvaeus. THE AMERICAN:. Bangkok, Oriental setting. And the city don't know that the city is getting. The creme de la creme of the chess world in a. Show with everything but Yul Brynner. Time flies -- doesn't seem a minute. Since the Tirolean spa had the chess boys in it. All change -- don't you know that when you. Play at this level there's no ordinary venue. It's Iceland -- or the Philippines -- or Hastings -- or --. or this place!. COMPANY:. One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster. The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free. You'll find a god in every golden cloister. And if you're lucky then the god's a she. I can feel an angel sliding up to me. THE AMERICAN:. One town's very like another. When your head's down over your pieces, brother. COMPANY:. It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity. To be looking at the board, not looking at the city. THE AMERICAN:. Whaddya mean? Ya seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town --. COMPANY:. Tea, girls, warm, sweet. Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite. THE AMERICAN:. Get Thai'd! You're talking to a tourist. Whose every move's among the purest. I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine. COMPANY:. One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble. Not much between despair and ecstasy. One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble. Can't be too careful with your company. I can feel the devil walking next to me. THE AMERICAN:. Siam's gonna be the witness. To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness. This grips me more than would a. Muddy old river or reclining Buddha. And thank God I'm only watching the game -- controlling it --. I don't see you guys rating. The kind of mate I'm contemplating. I'd let you watch, I would invite you. But the queens we use would not excite you. So you better go back to your bars, your temples, your massage. parlours --. COMPANY:. One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster. The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free. You'll find a god in every golden cloister. A little flesh, a little history. I can feel an angel sliding up to me. One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble. Not much between despair and ecstasy. One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble. Can't be too careful with your company. I can feel the devil walking next to me"

I was born and raised in San Jose. I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose.. Fame and fortune is a magnet.. It can pull you far away from home. With a dream in your heart you're never alone.. Dreams turn into dust and blow away. And there you are without a friend. You pack your car and ride away. I've got lots of friends in San Jose.

Familiar faces on the train. Running scared, and staying sane. If you live by the sword. Well that's your own reward. So don't walk with me. Watching the wildlife. The beast within you. Eats your heart out. Get free from hate and get in love. Boys in the backyard. The girls are hanging out the lines. Washing the day, wash your troubles away. It's game we have to play. Ghosts are chasing you round. Things that happen in the past. Don't make that mistake again. The sun beats down the streets of passion. If you live by the sword. Well that's your own reward. So don't talk with me. Watching the wildlife. The beast within you. Eats your heart out. Get free from hate and get in love. Your own worst enemy. Get free from hate and get in love. If you live by the sword. Watching the wildlife. Watching you. The beast within you too. Watching the wildlife. Get in love, get in love. Watching the wildlife. We all live in a dream in home. We watch TV and drive a car. We go outside, but not too far. Watching the wildlife. We walk the water like a sun. Living cuts you like a knife. Living here watching the Wildlife. Get in love, get in love."
