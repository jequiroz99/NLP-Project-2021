And bring on all the pretenders. One day we will be remembered. I said remember this feeling. I passed the pictures around. Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines. Wishing for right now. We are the kings and the queens. You traded your baseball cap for a crown. When they gave us our trophies. And we held them up for our town. And the cynics were outraged. Screaming, ""this is absurd"". 'Cause for a moment a band of thieves. In ripped up jeans got to rule the world. Long live the walls we crashed through. How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you. I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made"". And bring on all the pretenders. I'm not afraid. Long live all the mountains we moved. I had the time of my life. Fighting dragons with you. I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face"". And bring on all the pretenders. One day we will be remembered. Hold on to spinning around. Confetti falls to the ground. May these memories break or fall. Can you take a moment. Promise me this. That you'll stand by me forever. But if God forbid fate should step in. And force us into a goodbye. If you have children someday. When they point to the pictures. Please tell them my name. Tell them how the crowds went wild. Tell them how I hope they shine. Long live the walls we crashed through. I had the time of my life with you. Long, long live the walls we crashed through. How the candlelight shined just for me and you.

a place in this world,"I don't know what I want, so don't ask me. Cause I'm still trying to figure it out. Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking. Trying to see through the rain coming down. Even though I'm not the only one. Who feels the way I do. I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know. I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on. Oh I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world. Got the radio on, my old blue jeans. And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve. Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine. Could you tell me what more do I need. And tomorrow's just a mistery oh yeah. But that's ok. I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know. I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on. Oh I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world. Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission. But I'm ready to fly. I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know.

all night diner,"I wake up, stretch out. I wonder what you're doing right now. Yeah I slept in my makeup again. Tell myself I must be crazy thinking about him. I find myself something decent to wear. Take the towel out of my hair. About that time you call me. I'm reminded without you I'd be. A stranger in an all night diner. Waiting for her love to find her. Lonely like a harbor line. That's never seen a boat. Just like a line in an old letter. No one ever wrote. I go to work, work all day. I want a tape recorder for everything you say. Walk to the car, dig out my keys. Start thinking if you were with anyone but me. I'd be a stranger in an all night diner. Waiting for her love to find her. Lonely like a harbor line. That's never seen a boat. Just like a line in an old letter. No one ever wrote. There you are on the street. Standing there waiting on me. I show you my new shoes. You say you love them. Baby, without you. I'd be a stranger in an all night diner. Waiting for her love to find her. Lonely like a harbor line. That's never seen a boat. Just like a line in an old letter. No one ever wrote. I wake up, stretch out. Wonder what you're doing right now...."
all too well,"I walked through the door with you. The air was cold, but something 'bout it. Felt like home somehow. And I left my scarf there at your sister's house. And you still got it in your drawer even now. Oh your sweet disposition. At my wide eyed gaze. We're singing in the car getting lost upstate. Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place. And I can picture it after all these days. And I know it's long gone. And that magic's not here no more. And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all. 'Cause there we are again on that little town street. You almost ran the red. 'Cause you were looking over me. Wind in my hair, I was there. I remember it all too well. Photo album on the counter. Your cheeks were turning red. You used to be a little kid with glasses. In a twin size bed. And your mother's telling stories. 'Bout you on the Tee Ball team. You tell me about your past. Thinking your future was me. And I know it's long gone. And there was nothing else I could do. And I forget about you long enough. To forget why I needed to. Cause there we are again in the middle of the night. We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light. Down the stairs, I was there. I remember it all too well. And maybe we got lost in translation. Maybe I asked for too much. But maybe this thing was a masterpiece. 'Till you tore it all up. Running scared, I was there. I remember it all too well. Hey you called me up again. Just to break me like a promise. So casually cruel in the name of being honest. I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here. 'Cause I remember it all all all too well. Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it. I'd like to be my old self again. But I'm still trying to find it. After plaid shirt days and nights. When you made me your own. Now you mail back my things. And I walk home alone. But you keep my old scarf. From that very first week. 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me. You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well. Cause there we are again and I loved you so. Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known. It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well. Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all. Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all. It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"

am i ready for love,"Sometimes I wonder how's it gonna feel. Will my first love be true and real. Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall. What will I do when my love comes to call. And my daddy tells me that I light up his world. Everday he says, ""Darlin you're my best girl."". He tried to teach me from the very start. The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart. (Chorus). Will my love come in a bowl of fire. Will it be filled with hope and desire. Will my love come in the pourin rain. Am I ready for the joy. Am I ready for the pain. Am I ready for the boy. Am I ready for love....for love. I know I'm not a little girl anymore. Cause I'm feelin things I've never felt before. Sweet sensations and anticipations. Calling commotion to my emotions. And I hear the words my daddy said to me. He said be true to yourself and keep your spirit free. And love will find you one way or another. Be good to yourself and be good to eachother. (Chorus). Will my love come in a bowl of fire. Will it be filled with hope and desire. Will my love come in the pourin rain. Am I ready for the joy. Am I ready for the pain. Am I ready for the boy. Am I ready for love....for love. It's a run around the world and it's movin so fast. Though I wanna find a love that's gonna last. A love so strong that it can withstand. The weight of this world in the palm of its hand. (Chorus). Will my love come in a bowl of fire. Will it be filled with hope and desire. Will my love come in the pourin rain. Am I ready for the joy. Am I ready for the pain. Am I ready for the boy. Am I ready for the game. Am I ready for the kiss. Am I ready for the stars. Am I ready for the bliss. Am I ready for love....for love"

american girl,"Well she was an American girl. Raised on promises. She couldn`t help thinkin that there. Was a little more to life. Somewhere else. After all it was a great big world. With lots of places to run to. Yeah, and if she had to die. Tryin she had one little promise. She was gonna keep. Oh yeah, all right. Take it easy baby. Make it last all night. She was an American girl. It was kind of cold that night. She stood alone on her balcony. She could see the cars roll by. Out on 441. Like waves crashin in the beach. And for one desperate moment there. He crept back in her memory. God it`s so painful. Something that`s so close. And still so far out of reach. Oh yeah, all right. Take it easy baby. Make it last all night. She was an American girl. Oh yeah, all right. Take it easy baby. Make it last all night. Oh yeah, all right. Take it easy baby. Oh, take it easy now. Oh yeah, all right.

So I brought in this idea called. ""Blank Space"" and this was me playing it. for Max and Johan for the first time and. they're shouting out these production ideas like. you know, the ""Oh! "" at the beginning. of the and that ended up in the song. so this is the very beginning stages of a. song on the album called ""Blank Space"". Like. Nice to meet you. Where you been.

clean,"The drought was the very worst. When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst. It was months and months of back-and-forth. You still all over me.

When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe. By morning, gone was any trace of you. I think I am finally clean. There was nothing left to do. When the butterflies turned to dust. They covered my whole room. So I punched a hole in the roof. Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you. The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud. But no one heard a thing. Rain came pouring down. When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe. By morning, gone was any trace of you. I think I am finally clean. See, I think I am finally clean. Ten months sober, I must admit. Just because you're clean. Don't mean you don't miss it. Ten months older, I won't give in. Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it. The drought was the very worst. When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst. Rain came pouring down. When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe. By morning, gone was any trace of you. I think I am finally clean. Rain came pouring down. When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe. By morning, gone was any trace of you. I think I am finally clean. Finally clean, think I'm finally clean. Think I'm finally clean"
closest to a cowboy,I drive around this town. In a Mustang with the top down. And six running horses under my hood. Well that's good enough for me. Don't need the real thing. That's just another thing. For me to try to tame. Don't know if I could. It might just break me. I thought there for a little while. Every sunset I'd be a riding off with him. Snap buttons on a denim shirt. Blue jeans and a little dirt. That's the closest you'll see me. Feet hanging out a pickup truck. Crazy and a little rough. Running free. That's the closest to a cowboy. You'll see me. Before I met him. I was so sane and grounded. Before he taught me how to lie. And crawl out the window. I learned the dirt roads. And I got my heart broken. Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry. And how to let go. I thought there for a little while. Every sunset I'd be a riding off with him. Snap buttons on a denim shirt. Blue jeans and a little dirt. That's the closest you'll see me. Feet hanging out a pickup truck. Crazy and a little rough. Running free. That's the closest to a cowboy. You'll see me. It was all a little. Wonderful and strange. But I'll never look. At a sunset the same night. Snap buttons on a denim shirt. Blue jeans and a little dirt. That's the closest you'll see me. Feet hanging out a pickup truck. Crazy and a little rough. Running free. Sitting fishing by the river bank. Swimming in the water tank. That's the closest you'll see me. Feet hanging out a pickup truck. Crazy and a little rough. Running free. That's the closest to a cowboy. You'll see me
cold as you,"You have a way of coming easily to me.. And when you take, you take the very best of me.. So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel somethin'. And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted.. Oh, what a shame.. What a rainy ending given to a perfect day.. Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say.. And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through,. I've never been anywhere cold as you.. You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray.. And I stood there lovin' you and washed them all away.. And you come away with a great little story. Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you.. Oh, what a shame.. What a rainy ending given to a perfect day.. So just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say.. And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through,. I've never been anywhere cold as you.. You never did give a damn thing, honey.. But I cried, cried for you.. And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died,. Died for you.. Oh, what a shame.. What a rainy ending give to a perfect day.. Every smile you fake is so condescending.. Counted all the scars you made.. Now that I'm sittin here thinkin' it through,. I've never been anywhere cold as you."
come back... be here,"You said it in a simple way. 4am, the second day. How strange that I don't know you at all. Stumble through the long goodbye. One last kiss then you catch your flight. Right when I was just about to fall. I told myself: ""don't get attached"". But in my mind I play it back. Spinning faster than the plane that took you. And this is when the feeling sinks in. I don't wanna miss you like this. Come back... be here. Come back... be here. I guess you aren't in New York today. I don't wanna need you this way. Come back... be here. Come back... be here. The delicate, beginning watch. The feeling you can know so much. Without knowing anything at all. And now that I can put this down. If I had known what I know now. I never would've play so nonchalant. Taxi cabs and busy streets. They never bring you back to me. I can't help but wish you took me with you. And this is when the feeling sinks in. I don't wanna miss you like this. Come back... be here. Come back... be here. I guess you are in London today. I don't wanna need you this way. Come back... be here. Come back... be here. This is falling in love in the cruelest way. This is falling for you and you are worlds away. In New York, be here. But you're in London. And I break down. This is not fair. That you're not around. And this is when the feeling sinks in. I don't wanna miss you like this. Come back... be here. Come back... be here. I guess you aren't in New York today. I don't wanna need you this way. Come back... be here. Come back... be here"

dark blue tennessee,"He said ""I got me a nice new apartment in the city"". Wouldn't you have hated that?. I'm getting by with the broken heart you left me with. He hangs up the phone and she whispers back. ""Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow. Won't you come back to me?. I'll be here today and here tomorrow. In dark blue Tennessee"". He was lying when he said he'd moved to L.A.. He's just hiding now on the other side of town. With his head in his hand, and she's just seven miles away. She's staring at the window and puts her picture down. Saying. ""Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow. Won't you come back to me?. I'll be here today and here tomorrow. In dark blue Tennessee"". She almost called him on the night that he rode. Three simple words on his goodbye note. Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow. Won't you come back to me?. And I'll be here today and here tomorrow. In dark blue Tennessee. In dark blue Tennessee"
dear john,"Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you. Counting my footsteps praying the floor won't fall through again. And my mother accused me of losing my mind. But I swore I was fine. You paint me a blue sky. and go back and turn it to rain. And I lived in your chess game. But you changed the rules everyday. Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone. Tonight. Well I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why. Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone. Don't you think I was too young to be messed with. The girl in the dress cried the whole way home. I should've known. Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame. Or maybe it's you and your sick need. to give love then take it away. And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors. who don't understand. And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when. they said: Run as fast as you can. Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone. Don't you think I was too young to be messed with. The girl in the dress cried the whole way home. Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong. Don't you think 19's too young to be played by. Your dark twisted games when I loved you so. I should've known. You are an expert at sorry. And keeping lines blurry. Never impressed by me acing your tests. All the girls that you've run dry. Have tired, lifeless eyes. Cause you burned them out. But I took your matches before fire could catch me. So don't look now. I'm shining like fireworks. Over your sad empty town. Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone. Don't you think I was too young to be messed with. The girl in the dress cried the whole way home. I see it all now that you're gone. Don't you think I was too young to be messed with.

don't hate me for loving you,"My mama stood across the room. Face to face but never eye to eye. Recalling words we said. The battle that we swore we'd never fight.

Don't hate me for loving you. He walked around my life. And made me blind with every single move. He caught me staring at him. Mad about him, little that I knew. Love is different when you play the fool. And all I wanna do is say. Don't walk away now and. Don't rip my heart out. Don't you make me cry tonight. Like you always do. Don't hate me for loving you. I slammed the door, sat on the porch. And cried into my hands and said. “Are you there do you even care”. To the cross above my head. And someone said. Don't turn away now and. Don't rip my heart out. Things are meant to happen like this. I know it's rough on you. Don't hate me for loving you. I looked up at the sky. Face to face and finally eye to eye"

down came the rain,"Here in my mind the sky looks the same. On every day you loved me. When we started home it started to rain. You put your coat around me. We stood there in the road. You held me so close. But did you ever let go. Down came the rain. Lightning and thunder. We tried in vain. To hold on to each other. Winds of change blew you away from me. Right here right now, I feel it on my skin. The bitter sting of what we could've been. Just when our love was like a burning flame. Down came the rain. In through the window I see her with you.

Down came the rain. Lightning and thunder. We tried in vain. To hold on to each other. Winds of change blew you away from me. Love like this changes who you are. Every kiss you gave me is a scar.

drive,"It was painted red. The stripe was white. It was 18 feet from val to stern light. It was 2nd hand, from a dealer in Atlanta. I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her.

It was just an old plywood boat. A 75 Johnson, an electric choke. A young boy two hands on the wheel. I can't replace the way it made me feel. I would turn her sharp, I would make it wide. He said you can't beat the way. A old wood boat rides. Just a little lake across the Alabama line. But I was king of the ocean. When Daddy let me drive. Just an old half ton short bed ford. My Uncle bought new in 64. Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking. A couple of burnt valves and he got it going. He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load. Off a dirt strip where we'd dump trash. Off of thickpin road. I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet to the pedals. Smiling like a hero. Who just received his medal. It was just an old hand me down ford. With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door. A young boy two hands on the wheel. I can't replace the way it made me feel. I would press that clutch, and I would keep it right. He would say just a little slower son. You're doing just fine. Just a little dirt road with trash on each side. But I was Mario Andretti. When Daddy let me drive. I'm grown up now. 3 daughters of my own. I let them drive my old jeep. Across the pastior at our home. Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file. And pull out that old memory. And think of me and smile. And say. It was just an old worn out jeep. Rusty old floor boards. Hot on my feet. A young girl two hands on the wheel. I can't replace the way it made me feel. Turn it left, and steer it right. Straighten up girl, you're doing just fine. Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride. But I was high on a mountain. When Daddy let me drive. Daddy let me drive. Oh he let me drive. She's just old plywood boat. With a 75 johnson. And electric choke"
drive all night (just south of knowing why),"She didn't have a reason to go, oh no. She didn't have a reason to stay either way. She didn't tell anyone by the first reason. She looked at her keys and found a reason to run. And time stands still when you're nowhere bound. But I understand it somehow. If I could drive all night. Would I find my peace of mind. Would it be a million miles of cold white lights. And unfamiliar exit signs. I'd just drive on by. Just south of knowing why. I didn't really know her that well but I could tell. That her smile was only something to hide behind. She felt so out of touch 'cause she just felt too much. And you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough. And time stands still when you're nowhere bound. That's where I'm headed right now. If I could drive all night. Would I find my peace of mind. Would it be a million miles of cold white lights. And unfamiliar exit signs. I'd just drive on by. Just south of knowing why. I don't have a plan. I don't have a map. I don't even know if. I'm ever coming back. I don't have a when and I don't have a where. I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there. But if I could drive all night. Would I find my peace of mind. Would it be a million miles of cold white lights. And unfamiliar exit signs. I'd just drive on by... I'd just drive on by. Drive on... drive on... drive all night. If I'd just drive on... drive on... drive all night. Just south of knowing why"
drops of jupiter,"Now he's back in the atmosphere. With drops of jupiter in his hair. He walks like summer and talks like rain. Reminds me that there's a time to change. Since the return of his stay on the moon. He listens like spring and he talks like June. But tell me did you sail across the sun. Did you make it to the milky way. To see the lights all faded. And that heaven is overrated. Tell me did you fall for a shooting star. One without a permanent scar. And did you miss me. While you were looking for yourself out there. Now he's back from that soul vacation. Chasing his way through the constellation. He checks out mozart while he does tae-bo. Reminds me that there's room to grow. Now he's back in the atmosphere. I'm afraid that he might think of me as. Plain or jane told a story about a man. Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land. Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet. Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day. And head back to the milky way. And tell me did venus blow your mind. Was it everything you wanted to find. And did you miss me. While you were looking for yourself out there. Can you imagine, no love, pride, deep fried chicken. Your best friend always stickin up for you. even when I know you're wrong. Can you imagine no first dance. Freeze dried romance. 5 hour phone conversation. The best soy latte' that you ever had and...Me?. But tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet?. Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day. And head back toward the milky way?. Tell me did you fall for a shooting star,. One without a permanent scar?. And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself. Can you imagine, no love, pride, deep fried chicken. Your best friend always stickin up for you. even when I know you're wrong. Can you imagine no first dance. Freeze dried romance. 5 hour phone conversation. The best soy latte' that you ever had and...Me?"
electric barnyard jingle,"Turn your dial to 93.7. Broadway acts like he's 11. Self-proclaimed, self. Worse mistake ever to land in Michigan. I'm just a singer of country songs. Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong. But if you listen to just one thing I say. You should turn 93 on. Broadway's Electric Barnyard. I sing a song called Tim McGraw. Request it and they'll play it all day long. I sing in stations all day long. But there's nothin like when you're on. The Electric Barnyard. From a trailer park in St. Louis. Growin' up not wearin' any shoes. Prettiest hillbilly girl you see all day. Growin' up the other trailer park girls. Couldn't hide their jealousy. Cuz she had the only phone for miles. Now she uses it as a DJ. So you should turn? 93 on. Broadway's Electric Barnyard. I sing a song called Tim McGraw. Request it and they'll play it all day long. I sing in stations all day long. But there's nothin like when you're on. The Electric Barnyard"
enchanted,"There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles. Same old tired, lonely place. Walls of insincerity. Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face. All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you. Your eyes whispered ""have we met?"". Across the room your silhouette. Starts to make it's way to me. The playful conversation starts. Counter all your quick remarks. Like passing notes in secrecy. And it was enchanting to meet you. All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you. This night is sparkling, don't you let it go. I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home. I'll spend forever wondering if you knew. I was enchanted to meet you. The lingering question kept me up. 2am, who do you love?. I wonder till I'm wide awake. Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door. I'd open up and you would say,. It was enchanting to meet you. All I know is I was enchanted to meet you. This night is sparkling, don't you let it go. I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home. I'll spend forever wondering if you knew. This night is flawless, don't you let it go. I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone. I'll spend forever wondering if you knew. I was enchanted to meet you. This is me praying that this was the very first page. Not where the story line ends. My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again. These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon. I was enchanted to meet you. Please don't be in love with someone else. Please don't have somebody waiting on you. Please don't be in love with someone else. Please don't have somebody waiting on you. This night is sparkling, don't you let it go. I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home. I'll spend forever wondering if you knew. This night is flawless, don't you let it go. I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone. I'll spend forever wondering if you knew. I was enchanted to meet you. Please don't be in love with someone else. Please don't have somebody waiting on you"

fifteen,"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors. It's the morning of your very first day. You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while. Try and stay out of everybody's way.

This is life before you know who you're gonna be. Fifteen. You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail. And soon enough you're best friends. Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool. We'll be out of here as soon as we can. And then you're on you're very first date. And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying. And you're mama's waiting up. And you're thinking he's the one. And you're dancing 'round your room. When the night ends. When the night ends. [chorus]. Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you. You're gonna believe them. When you're fifteen. And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round. But in your life you'll do things greater than. Dating the boy on the football team. But I didn't know it at fifteen. When all you wanted. Was to be wanted. Wish you could go back. And tell yourself what you know now. Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday. But I realized some bigger dreams of mine. And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy. Who changed his mind and we both cried. [chorus]. Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you. You're gonna believe them. And when you're fifteen,. Don't forget to look before you fall. I've found time can heal most anything. And you just might find who you're supposed to be. I didn't know who I was supposed to be. At fifteen.

Like a perfect rhyme. Took off fast through the green light, go. Hey, skip the conversation and you already know. I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made. And that was the first day.

We blocked the noise with the sound of 'I need you'. And for the first time I had something to lose. Well I guess we fell apart in the usual way. And the story's got dust on every page. Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now. And I see your face in every crowd. Cause darling, it was good never looking down. And right there where we stood was holy ground. Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through. But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you. Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in the next room.

i wished on a plane,Throwing pennies at the fountain. When you're standing on a mountain. It's kinda hard to aim. Like the tree we carved our names in. There must be an explanation. I guess it didn't get enough rain. I need reasons why you're leaving. Well I guess I wished on a plane. I thought was a star. I guess what you wrote on paper. Wasn't written on your heart. Could've sworn you said you loved me. I guess I heard you wrong. And I guess I wished on a plane. I thought was a star. Diving off into the deep end. Always believed you'd be there. When I jumped in. Guess it ain't your territory. We had the perfect love story. Except the ending. Nothing comes true when it comes to you. Well I guess I wished on a plane. I thought was a star. I guess what you wrote on paper. Wasn't written in your heart. Could've sworn you said you loved me. I guess I heard you wrong. And I guess I wished on a plane. I thought was a star. Tonight was so cloudy. It's not my fault. I just couldn't see.... Well I guess I wished on a plane. I thought was a star. I guess what you wrote on paper. Wasn't written in your heart.

i'd lie,"I don't think that passenger seat. Has ever looked this good to me. He tells me about his night. I count the colors in his eyes. He'll never fall in love. He swears, as he runs his fingers through his hair. I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong. And I don't think it ever crossed his mind. He tells a joke, I fake a smile. But I know all his favorite songs. And I could tell you. His favorite color's green. He loves to argue. Born on the seventeenth. His sister's beautiful. He has his father's eyes. And if you ask me if I love him... I'd lie. He looks around the room. Innocently overlooks the truth. Shouldn't a light go on. Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long. He sees everything in black and white. Never let nobody see him cry. I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine. I could tell you. His favorite color's green. He loves to argue. Born on the seventeenth. His sister's beautiful. He has his father's eyes. And if you ask me if I love him... I'd lie. He stands there, then walks away. My god, if I could only say. I'm holding every breath for you. He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar. I think he can see through everything. But my heart. First thought when I wake up is. My god, he's beautiful. So I put on my make-up and pray for a miracle. Yes I could tell you. His favorite color's green. He loves to argue. Oh, and it kills me. His sister's beautiful. He has his father's eyes. And if you ask me if I love him... If you ask me if I love him... I'd lie"

if this was a movie,Last night I heard my own heart beating. Sounded like footsteps on my stairs. Six months gone and I'm still reaching. Even though I know you're not there. I was playing back a thousand memories baby. Thinkin bout everything we've been through. Maybe I've been going back too much lately. When time stood still and I had you. (Chorus). Come back come back come back to me like. You would you would if this was a movie. Stand in the rain outside til I came out. Come back come back come back to me like. You could you could if you just said you're sorry. I know that we could work it out somehow. But if this was a movie you'd be here by now. I know people change and these things happen. But I remember how it was back then. Locked up in your arms and our friends were laughing. Cause nothing like this ever happened to them. Now I'm pacing down the hall. Chasing down your street. Flashback to the night when you said to me. Nothings gonna change not for me and you. Not before I knew how much I had to lose. (Chorus). Come back come back come back to me like. You would you would if this was a movie. Stand in the rain outside til I came out. Come back come back come back to me like. You could you could if you just said you're sorry. I know that we could work it out somehow. But if this was a movie you'd be here by now. If you're out there if you're somewhere. If you're moving on. I've being waiting for you ever since you've been gone. I just want it back the way it was before. And I just wanna see you back at my front door. And I'd say. Come back come back come back to me like. You would before you said its not that easy. Before the fight before I locked you out. But I'd take it all back now. (Chorus). Come back come back come back to me like. You would you would if this was a movie. Stand in the rain outside til I came out. Come back come back come back to me like. You could you could if you just said you're sorry. I know that we could work it out somehow. But if this was a movie you'd be here by now. You'd be here by now. Is that the kind of ending you wanna see now. Baby what about the ending. Oh I thought you'd be here by now oh ohh ohh ohh. That you'd be here by now. Crédito: kathgoncalves

Someone bigger brought down to you. Wasn't it beautiful running wild till you fell asleep. Before the monsters caught up to you. It's alright just wait and see,. Your string of lights are still bright to me. Oh who you are is not where you've been. You're still an innocent. It's okay, life is a tough crowd. 32 And still growing up now. Who you are is not what you did. You're still an innocent. Time turns flames to embers. You'll have new septembers. Every one of us has messed up too. Minds change like the weather. I hope you remember. Today is never too late to. Be brand new. It's alright just wait and see,. Your string of lights are still bright to me. Oh, who you are is not where you've been.

I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye. Tell me baby, do you recognize me?. Well it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me. Merry Christmas. I wrapped it up and sent it. With a note saying \""I love you\"", I meant it. Now I know what a fool I've been. But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again. Last Christmas, I gave you my heart. But the very next day you gave it away. This year, to save me from tears. I'll give it to someone special. Last Christmas, I gave you my heart. But the very next day you gave it away. This year, to save me from tears. I'll give it to someone special. Special. Yea yea. A crowded room, friends with tired eyes. I'm hiding from you, and your soul of ice. I thought you were someone to rely on. Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on. A face on a lover with a fire in his heart. A girl under cover but you tore me apart. Maybe this year, maybe this year. I'll give it to someone special. Last Christmas, I gave you my heart. But the very next day you gave it away. This year, to save me from tears. I'll give it to someone special.

last kiss,"I still remember the look on your face. Lit through the darkness at 1:58. The words that you whispered. For just us to know. You told me you loved me. So why did you go. Away. Away?. I do recall now. The smell of the rain. Fresh on the pavement. I ran off the plane. That July 9th. The beat of your heart. It jumps through your shirt. I can still feel your arms. But now I'll go sit on the floor. Wearing your clothes. All that I know is that. I don't know how to be something you miss. Never thought we'd have a last kiss. Never imagined we'd end like this. Your name, forever the name on my lips. I do remember. The swing in your step. The life of the party, you're showing off again. And I roll my eyes and then. You pull me in. I'm not much for dancing. But for you I did. Because I love your handshake. Meeting my father. I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets. How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something. There's not a day. When I don't miss those rude interruptions. But now I'll go sit on the floor. Wearing your clothes. All that I know is that. I don't know how to be something you miss. Never thought we'd have a last kiss. Never imagined we'd end like this. Your name, forever the name on my lips. So I'll watch you live in pictures. Like I used to watch you sleep. And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe. And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are. Hope it's nice where you are. And I hope the sun shines. And it's a beautiful day. And something reminds you. You wish you had stayed. You can plan for a change in weather and town. But I never planned on you changing your mind. So I'll go sit on the floor. Wearing your clothes. All that I know is that. I don't know how to be something you miss. Never thought we'd have a last kiss. Never imagined we'd end like this. Your name, forever the name on my lips. Just like our last kiss. Forever the name on my lips. Forever the name on my lips. Just like our last"

live for the little things,"One daybreak, one heartache. Every once upon a time. That black dress, happiness. Bubble baths and borderlines. They mean so much to everyone. But you count them up one by one. Clear midnights and clear spotlights. Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall. A bluebonnet with rain on it. White winters and leaves that always fall. Your black boots. My red flower ring. Live for the little things. Oil paintings and making every detail turn out right. One last dance, new romance. Living for that love at first sight. It means so much to everyone. But you count it up one by one. Clear midnights and clear spotlights. Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall. A bluebonnet with rain on it. White winters and leaves that always fall. Your black boots. My red flower ring. Live for the little things. No fighting, black writing. Wish upon a star. And give the moon a smile. Pretending, defending. Take a risk and go along for the ride. Strawberries and fairies with wings. Live for the little things"
long live,"I said remember this moment. In the back of my mind. The time we stood with our shaking hands. The crowds and stands went wild. We were the Kings and the Queens. And they read off our names. The night you danced like you knew our lives. Would never be the same. You held your head like a hero. On a history book page. It was the end of a decade. But the start of an age. Long live the walls we crashed through. How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you. I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made"". And bring on all the pretenders. One day we will be remembered. I said remember this feeling. I passed the pictures around. Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines. Wishing for right now. We are the kings and the queens. You traded your baseball cap for a crown. When they gave us our trophies. And we held them up for our town. And the cynics were outraged. Screaming, ""this is absurd"". 'Cause for a moment a band of thieves. In ripped up jeans got to rule the world. Long live the walls we crashed through. How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you. I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made"". And bring on all the pretenders. I'm not afraid. Long live all the mountains we moved. I had the time of my life. Fighting dragons with you. I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face"". And bring on all the pretenders. One day we will be remembered. Hold on to spinning around. Confetti falls to the ground. May these memories break or fall. Can you take a moment. Promise me this. That you'll stand by me forever. But if God forbid fate should step in. And force us into a goodbye. If you have children someday. When they point to the pictures. Please tell them my name. Tell them how the crowds went wild. Tell them how I hope they shine. Long live the walls we crashed through. I had the time of my life with you. Long, long live the walls we crashed through. How the candlelight shined just for me and you. And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made"". And bring on all the pretenders. I'm not afraid. Singing long live all the mountains we moved. I had the time of my life. Fighting dragons with you. And long, long live the look on your face. And bring on all the pretenders. One day we will be remembered"
long time coming,"I got a lying smile I never put out for you. Cuz I guess I never felt like I really needed to. And they say little girls have big dreams. And nothing in the world was going to come between me. and you. And it was a long time coming. I waited half my life just to find someone like you. I spent a long time finding out. Love hangs around after you walk out. Not knowing, it'd be a long time going. They say it's better to have lost than never to have. loved at all. And I say whoever said that didn't have to far to fall. And they say little girls are so naïve. That wasn't how it was supposed to be. With me and you. And it was a long time coming. I waited half my life just to find someone like you. I spent a long time finding out. love hangs around after you walk out. Not knowing, it'd be a long time going. I burned my bridges, had sleepless nights. Washed my sins on the neon lights. And I'm still not over you. And it was a long time coming. I waited half my life just to find someone like you. I spent a long time finding all. The things around after you walk out. Not knowing, it would be a long time going. A long time going. And it would be a long time, long time going. It would be a long time, long time going. *Enviada por @mih_santos93"

love story (blue satellite remix),We were both young. When I first saw you. I closed my eyes. And the flashback starts. I'm standing there. On a balcony in summer air. I see the lights. See the party the ball gowns. I see you make your way. Through the crowd. And say hello. Little did I know. That you were Romeo. You were throwing pebbles. 'till my daddy said stay away from Juliet. And I was crying on the staircase. Beggin' you please don't go. And I said. Romeo take me. Somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting. All that's left to do is run. You'll be the prince. And I'll be the princess. It's a love story. Baby just say yes. So I sneak out. To the garden to see you. We keep quiet. Cause were dead if they knew. So close your eyes. Just keep this down for a little while. Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlett letter. And my daddy said stay away from Juliet. But you were everything to me. And I was beggin' you please don't go. And I said. Romeo take me. Somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting. All that's left to do is run. You'll be the prince. And I'll be the princess. It's a love story. Baby just say yes. Romeo save me. They're trying to tell me how to feel. This love is difficult. But it's real. Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess. It's a love story. Baby just say yes. I got tired of waiting. Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around. My faith in you was fading. When I met you on the outskirts of town. And I said. Romeo save me. I've been feelin' so alone. I keep waiting for you. But you never come. Is this in my head?. I don't know what to think. He knelt to the ground. And pulled out a ring. And says. Marry me Juliet. You never have to be alone. I love you. And that's all I really know. I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress. It's a love story. Baby just say yes. Oh oh. Oh oh oh. Cause we were both young. When I first saw you
love they haven't thought of yet,I want it all to appear before my eyes when he smiles. Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think Romeo would be my kind of guy. I want a love that's sweeter than roses. And for me this is how it's gonna be. Like there's a fairytale guy. And he whispers sweet lullabies. And the music plays from nowhere. As we dance in the pale moonlight. With candles and fireflies all night. Everybody thinks about love. I want love they haven't thought of yet. Here on the couch with a box of chocolates that I bought myself. I'll wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help. It's what you get when your heartstrings are so tied. I don't regret it ‘cause it needs to be perfect. Like there's a fairytale guy. And he whispers sweet lullabies. And the music plays from nowhere. As we dance in the pale moonlight. With candles and fireflies all night. Everybody thinks about love. I want love they haven't thought of yet. I want my own little storybook ending. We'll make it up as we go. There's a fairytale guy. And he whispers sweet lullabies. And the music plays from nowhere. As we dance in the pale moonlight. With candles and fireflies all night. Everybody thinks about love. I want love they haven't thought of yet. I want love they haven't thought of yet
love to lose,"Come on, gather round I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out. Sorry for the ending, I didn't mean to let you down. We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see. That to me you were the perfect view of misery. I never talked about the tears I cried. All the sleepless nights or the endless fights. I never talked about the days he called. There was something wrong, it was all my fault. I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now. And in case you haven't heard the news. There wasn't much love to lose. Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night. How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold as ice. He smiled and I smiled for the cameras in your mind. And I lied and swore that everything was fine. I never told you about the tears I cried. All the sleepless nights or the endless fights. I never told you about the days he called. There was something wrong, it was all my fault. I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now. And in case you haven't heard the news. There wasn't much love to lose. I know you wanna talk around me. How I gave up on love so foolishly. But keep in mind.... I never told you about the tears I cried. All the sleepless nights or the endless fights. I never told you about the days he called. There was something wrong, it was all my fault. I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now. And in case you haven't heard the news. There wasn't much love to lose. Come on, gather round I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out..."

nashville,"On a crowded highway. Through a night alone. I was barely breathing. I was crawling home. Well, it's not quite London. Or the south of France. Or an Asian Island. Or a second chance.

What's the use in wondering why?. Maybe I'm a storm front. Going through a valley. Tearing up a good July. And its safe and warm. Where nothing ever happens. Could it be so hard?. To realign a star for you. Change a southern man for you. Going back to Nashville. Thinking bout the whole thing. Guess you've got to run sometimes. Maybe I'm a fast train. Rolling though a valley. Tearing up a good July. I'm going back to Nashville. Laughing at a bad break. What's the use in wondering why?. Maybe I'm a storm front. Rolling through the valley. Tearing up a good July. Going back to Nashville. I'm going back to Nashville. Going back to Naaaaahh..... Going back to Nashville. What's the use in wondering why?"
need you now,I need you now. Read letters that I wrote on the wall. And the message that I left when I called. I need you now. Words I said drowned out by the rain. Waiting there for you but you never came. My world's a little colder now. But I'm keeping warm somehow. So here you are at my window. Guess nobody told you. I don't need don't need you. And I waited so frustrated. Who's gonna hold you. I don't need you don't need you now. I need you now. Words I heard you whisper to me. We were walking down a one-way street. You need me now. That's what you've been telling my friends. That I've come too far to go back there again. My heart my mind and number have changed. You might as well forget my name. So here you are at my window. Guess nobody told you. I don't need don't need you. And I waited so frustrated. Who's gonna hold you. I don't need you don't need you now. I need you now. Read letters that I wrote on the wall. And the message that I left when I called. So here you are at my window. Guess nobody told you. I don't need don't need you. And I waited so frustrated. Who's gonna hold you. I don't need you don't need you now
never fade,"I think you fell off of your cloud today. You didn't see it coming or did you. You tried to please everybody. But the sweet breeze swept you away. The sun goes down on a good day. Tomorrow is still an unknown. You think you're all alone in this place. I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby. Oh don't fade away baby. Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do. Don't count the days as they leave you. Count them as you find a day new. Don't fade away. Never fade. Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you. Somebody blows your candle out. You wore a mask, now that's broken too. Everybody else was everything to you. The sun goes down on a good day. Tomorrow is still an unknown. You think everybody wants a fight. I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby. Oh don't fade away baby. Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do. Don't count the days as they leave you. Count them as you find a day new. Don't fade away. Never fade. I think you fell out of the sky today. I think you know it's true. You've seen the world, now all you see is me. Tell me now baby what are you gonna do. Oh don't fade away baby. Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do. Don't count the days as they leave you. Count them as you find a day new. Don't fade away. Don't fade away. Don't fade away. Never fade"
never grow up,"Your little hands wrapped around my finger. And it's so quiet in the world tonight. Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming. So I tuck you in and turn on your favorite nightlight. To you, everything's funny. You got nothing to regret. I'd give all I have, honey. If you could stay like that. (Chorus:). Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up. Just stay this little. Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up. It could stay this simple. I won't let nobody hurt you. Won't let no one break your heart. No one will desert you. Just try to never grow up. Never grow up. You're in the car on the way to the movies. And you're mortified your mama's dropping you off. At 14, there's just so much you can't do. And you can't wait to move out. Someday and call your own shots. But don't make her drop you off around the block. Remember she's getting older too. And don't lose the way that you dance around in your. PJs getting ready for school. (Chorus:). Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up. Just stay this little. Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up. It could stay this simple. No one's ever burned you. Nothing's ever left you scared. Even though you want to, just try to never grow up. Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room. Memorize what is sounded like what your dad gets home. Remember the footsteps, remember the words said. And all your little brother's favorite songs. I just realized everything I had is someday gonna be gone. So here I am in my new apartment. In a big city, they just dropped me off. It's so much colder than I thought it would be. So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on. Wish I'd never grown up. I wish I'd never grown up. Oh I don't wanna grow up. Wish I'd never grown up. Could still be little. Oh I don't wanna grow up. Wish I'd never grown up. It could still be simple. (Chorus:). Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up. Just stay this little. Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up. It could stay this simple. Won't let nobody hurt you. Won't let no one break your heart. And even though you want to, please try to never grow up. Don't you ever grow up. Just never grow up"

new romantics,"We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything. We wait for trains that just aren't coming. We show off our different scarlet letters. Trust me, mine is better.

We hang back it's all in the timing. It's poker, you can't see it in my face. But I'm about to play my Ace. We need love but all we want is danger. We team up and switch sides like a record changer. The rumors are terrible and cruel. But honey most of them are true. Cause baby I could build a castle. Out of all the bricks they threw at me. And everyday is like a battle.

one thing,Wasn't just like a movie. The rain didn't soak through my clothes. Down to my skin. Driving away and I. I guess you could say. This is the last time I drive this way again. There was nothing to say and I. Try to grab at the fray cause I. I still love you but I can't. Bye bye. To everything I thought was on my side. Bye bye baby. I want you back but it's come down to nothing. And all you have is to walk away. From the one thing I thought would never leave me. Yeah. Picture frame is empty. It's black and white you're smiling down at me. I take your photo off the dash. And back to the conversation. We're so sure of everything. Everything we thought we'd always have. Lost in the sound of there. The here and the now comes in. Seems like I'm becoming. Part of your past. Bye bye. To everything I thought was on my side. Bye bye baby. I want you back but it's come down to nothing. All you have is to walk away. From the one thing I thought would never leave me. And there's so much that I can't touch.

one way ticket (because i can),"Standing on the border. Looking out into the great unknown. I can feel my heart beating faster. As I step out on my own. There's a new horizon. And the promise of favorable wind. I'm heading out tonight. Traveling light. I'm gonna start all over again. And buy a one-way ticket. On a west bound train. See how far I can go. Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain. And talk to someone I don't know. I will face the world around me. Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go. And I will fall in love again. Because I can. Gonna climb the mountain. And look the eagle in the eye. I won't let fear clip my wings. And tell me how high I can fly. How could I have ever believed. That love had to be so blind. When freedom was waiting, down at the station. All I had to do was make up my mind. And buy a one-way ticket. On a west bound train. See how far I can go. Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain. And talk to someone I don't know. I will face the world around me. Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go. And I will fall in love again. Because I can. Well, I have walked through the fire. And crawled on my knees. Through the valley of the shadow of doubt. Then the truth came shining. Like a light on me. And now I can see my way out. Buy a one-way ticket. On a west bound train. See how far I can go. Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain. And talk to someone I don't know. Buy a one-way ticket. On a west bound train. I'm gonna have my breakfast. With some pink champagne. Gonna sail the ocean. Gonna spread my wings. Gonna climb that mountain. Gonna do everything"
our last night,"We were standing in an empty room. The moonlight was falling. You were holding my hand. When the car pulled up for you. And I could have spent a life with you. But those days were over. You were calling my name when your face. Faded from view. And wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day. And wasn't it you who told me:. Angels fly in the air tonight. Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?. And stars collide and the air's alive. Or was it just like those promises that you made. On our last night?. I remember waking up with you. The days doing nothing. You meant more to me then than I think you ever knew.. But you were gonna be a doctor, movie star. A poet at a nobel seminar. I hope the world never tore that out of you. Cause wasn't it you who told me the sun. Would always chase the day. Yeah wasn't it you who told me:. Angels fly in the air tonight. Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?. And stars collide and the air's alive. Or was it just like those promises that you made. On our last night?. And what ever happened to the things you loved. And the songs we played, and the indian days. Whatever happened to the things you gave away?. Like harold and maude singing. I was waving as you drove away. The sunlight was falling. You were writing backwards in a dusty window pane. Angels fly in the air tonight. Or was it just like those promises that you made. And stars collide and the air's alive. Or was it just like those promises that you made. On our last night?. On our last night?"
our song,"I was ridin' shotgun. with my hair undone. in the front seat of his car. He's got a one hand feel. on the steering wheel. the other on my heart. I look around turn the radio down. he says ""baby, is something wrong?"". I say nothin'. I was just thinkin'. how we don't have a song. and he says:. Our song is the slammin' screen door. sneakin' out late tappin' on your window. when we're on the phone. and you talk real slow. cause it's late and your mama don't know. Our song is the way you laugh,. the first date, man, I didn't kiss her and I should have. and when I got home. Before I said amen. askin' God if He could play it again. I was walkin' up the front porch steps. after everything that day. had gone all wrong. had been trampled on. and lost and thrown away. got to the hallway. well on my way. to my lovin' bed. I almost didn't notice all the roses and the note that said:. Our song is the slammin' screen door. sneakin' out late tappin' on your window. when we're on the phone. and you talk real slow. cause it's late and your mama don't know. Our song is the way you laugh,. the first date, man, I didn't kiss her and I should have. and when I got home. Before I said amen. askin' God if He could play it again. I've heard every album, listen to the radio,. waitin' for something to come along. that was as good as our song. (slower). 'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door. sneakin' out late tappin' on his window. when we're on the phone. and he talks real slow. cause it's late and his mama don't know. Our song is the way he laughs,. the first date, man, I didn't kiss him and I should have. and when I got home. Before I said amen. askin' God if He could play it again. play it again. I was riding shotgun. with my hair undone. in the front seat of his car. I grabbed a pen and an old napkin. and I wrote down our song"
ours,"Elevator buttons and morning air,. Stranger silence makes me wanna take the stairs.. If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,. But right now my time is theirs.. Seems like there's always someone who disapproves.. They'll judge it like they know about me and you. And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do.. The jury's out, my choice is you.. (Chorus). So don't you worry your pretty little mind,. People throw rocks at things that shine. And life makes love look hard.. The stakes are high, the water's rough. But this love is ours.. You never know what people have up their sleeves,. Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me.. Lurking in the shadows with their lipgloss smiles,. But I don't care.. Cause right now you're mine.. And you'll say,. (Chorus). So don't you worry your pretty little mind,. People throw rocks at things that shine. And life makes love look hard.. The stakes are high, the water's rough. But this love is ours.. And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong. And your hands are tough but they are where mine belong in.. I'll fight their doubts and give you faith with this song for you. Cause I love the gap between your teeth. And I love the riddles that you speak.. And any snide remarks from my father. About your tattoos will be ignored. Cause my heart is yours. So don't you worry your pretty little mind,. People throw rocks at things that shine. And life makes love look hard.. So don't you worry your pretty little mind,. People throw rocks at things that shine. But they can't take what's ours. They can't take what's ours. The stakes are high, the water's rough. But this love is ours."
out of the woods,"Looking at it now, it all seemed so simple. We were lying on your couch. I remember. You took a Polaroid of us, then discovered. The rest of the world was black and white. But we were in screaming color. And I remember thinking. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods?. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. In the clear yet, good. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods?. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. In the clear yet, good. Are we out of the woods?. Looking at it now, last December. We were built to fall apart. Then fall back together. Your necklace hanging from my neck. The night we couldn't quite forget. When we decided, we decided. To move the furniture so we could dance. Baby, like we stood a chance. Two paper airplanes flying, flying. And I remember thinking. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods?. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. In the clear yet, good. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods?. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. In the clear yet, good. Are we out of the woods?. Remember when you hit the brakes too soon. Twenty stitches in a hospital room. When you started crying. Baby, I did too. But when the sun came up. I was looking at you. Remember when we couldn't take the heat. I walked out, I said ""I'm setting you free"". But the monsters turned out to be just trees. When the sun came up. You were looking at me. You were looking at me, oh. You were looking at me. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods?. I remember. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. In the clear yet, good. Oh, I remember. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods?. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. In the clear yet, good. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods?. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. In the clear yet, good. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods yet?. Are we out of the woods?. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. Are we in the clear yet?. In the clear yet, good. Are we out of the woods yet?.

point of view,Time is passing slowly for the eight year old next door. But mama's watch is ticking off the wall. Jillian and Bobby think that they're a perfect pair. But girls could say he's just a bit too tall. You don't have to do to win big. You just have to think it. Some folks say the glass is half full. Others choose to drink it.

rain song,"I had a conversation with the mirror. It ended up not having much to say. It said today was for the lovers and believers. I hate to tell you, it just ain't your day. So this is my rain song. It's cold outside and I still love you. Guess I was dead wrong. You find out when there's clouds above you. Finding it ain't worth losing you. When it all comes down, it comes down to. This lonely rain song. You're on my mind and I still love you. I had some complications with the voices. ‘Round and going ‘round inside my mind. I used to think this heart had lots of choices. But they all lead to your doorstep every time. So this is my rain song. It's cold outside and I still love you. Guess I was dead wrong. You find out when there's clouds above you. Finding it ain't worth losing you. When it all comes down, it comes down to. This lonely rain song. You're on my mind and I still love you. So this is my apology. My words, my tears, are all me. Laid out in front of you. Like the thought were true on a sunny afternoon. This is a song for you. So this is my rain song. It's cold outside and I still love you. Guess I was dead wrong. You find out when there's clouds above you. Finding it ain't worth losing you. When it all comes down, it comes down to. This lonely rain song. You're on my mind and I still love you. I still love you. I had a conversation with the mirror. It ended up not having much to say"
ready for it? (bloodpop® remix),"Knew he was a killer. First time that I saw him. Wondered how many girls he had loved. And left haunted. But if he's a ghost. Then I can be a phantom. Holdin' him for ransom, some. Some boys are tryin' too hard. He don't try at all though. Younger than my exes. But he act like such a man, so. I see nothing better, I keep him forever. Like a vendetta-ta. I, I, I see how this is gon' go. Touch me and you'll never be alone. I-island breeze and lights down low. No one has to know. In the middle of the night, in my dreams.

First time that he saw me. Stealing hearts and running off. And never sayin' sorry. But if I'm a thief. Then he can join the heist, and. We'll move to an island, and. And he can be my jailer. Burton to this taylor. Every love I've known in comparison is a failure. I forget their names now. I'm so very tame now. Never be the same now, now. I, I, I see how this is gon' go.

red,"Loving him is like driving. A new Maserati down a dead end street. Faster than the wind, passionate as sin. Ended so suddenly. Loving him is like trying to change your mind. Once you're already flying through the free fall. Like the colors in autumn, so bright. Just before they lose it all. Losing him was blue, like I'd never known. Missing him was dark grey, all alone. Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody. You never met. But loving him was red. Loving him was red. Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted. Was right there in front of you. Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words. To your old favorite song. Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword. And realizing there's no right answer. Regretting him was like wishing. You'd never found out. That love could be that strong. Losing him was blue, like I'd never known. Missing him was dark grey, all alone. Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody. You never met. But loving him was red. Loving him was red. Oh, red. Burning red. Remembering him comes in flashbacks, in echoes. Tell myself it's time now. Gotta let go. But moving on from him is impossible. When I still see it all in my head. Burning red. Loving him was red. Oh, losing him was blue, like I'd never known. Missing him was dark grey, all alone. Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody. You never met. 'Cause loving him was red. Yeah, yeah red. Burning red. And that's why he's spinning round in my head. Comes back to me, burning red. Yeah, yeah. His love was like driving. A new Maserati down a dead end street"

ride of our lives,"It's 10am, I catch the morning train,. And there you are, you smile, with a seat you've saved,. Saying ""Hey, I've been waiting for ya"".. We'd talk about our dreams, you'd talk 'bout everything,. We'd go so loud, but we don't care,. Cause all we care is that we're having so much fun.. You'd tell me 'bout your life, you'd learn a bit 'bout mine,. And just like that I swear it's like we've known each other our whole lives.. And this moment is perfect.. Train tracks grind still everyone can hear us.. Don't you dare be quiet.. This journey's ours, yeah this journey's ours.. Lets take the ride of our lives.. This is the moment where the chemistry happens,. Yeah that special connection.. These are the days of our lives.. These are the times you'll never forget.. Never regret as long as we ride here side by side.. We can speak, we can dream,. This is our time, you and me,. Lets have the ride of our lives.. As we watch the world outside the window past,. I'd pray, hoping that this moment lasts.. It's hard not to laugh out loud baby when you crack a joke.. You've got me smiling, got me thinking that I've got it all.. You make a promise to me; promise this will be our tradition,. Cause every time we ride together it's like stranger than fiction.. I don't ever want this train ride to come to an end,. But when it does baby, we can do it all over again.. And the train's coming to a stop,. I'm still so lost in you I can't bare to get off.. You kiss me on the spot.. “See you tomorrow, yeah tomorrow we can…”"

ronan,"I remember your barefeet down the hallway. I remember your little laugh. Race cars on the kitchen floor. Plastic dinosaurs. I love you to the moon and back. I remember your blue eyes. Looking into mine. Like we had our own secret club. I remember you dancing before bedtime. Then jumping on me, waking me up. I can still feel you hold my hand. Little man, and even the moment I knew. You fought it hard like an army guy. Remember I leaned in and whispered to you. ""Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here"". You were my best four years. I remember the drive home. When the blind hope. Turned to crying and screaming why. Flowers pile up in the worst way. No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died. And it's about to be Halloween. You could be anything. You wanted if you were still here. I remember the last day. When I kissed your face and whispered in your ear. ""Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here"". Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray. We'll just disappear. ""Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here"". You were my best four years. What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you. What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into. And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through. What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you. ""Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here"". ""Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here"". You were my best four years. I remember your barefeet down the hallway. I love you to the moon and back"

sad beautiful tragic,"Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket. Words, how little they mean,. when they're a little too late. I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket. Good girls, hopeful they'll be, long we will wait. We had a beautiful magic love there. What a sad beautiful tragic love affair. In dreams, I meet you in long conversation. We both wake in lonely beds, and different cities. And time is taking a sweet time erasing you. And you've got your demons. And darling they all look like me.

But I got your heart. Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone. 'Cause we break down a little. And when you get me alone,. it's so simple. 'Cause baby, I know what you know. We can feel it. And our pieces fall. Right into place. Get caught up in the moments. Lipstick on your face. So it goes.... I'm yours to keep. And I'm yours to lose. You know I'm not a bad girl,. but I. Do bad things with you. So it goes.... Come here, dressed in black now. So, so, so it goes.... Scratches down your back now. So, so, so it goes.... You did a number on me. But, honestly, baby,. who's counting?. I did a number on you. But, honestly, baby,. who's counting?. You did a number on me. But, honestly, baby,. who's counting?. Who's counting?. 1, 2, 3. And our pieces fall (pieces fall). Right into place. Get caught up in the moments. (caught up, caught up). Lipstick on your face. So it goes.... I'm yours to keep (oh). And I'm yours to lose (baby). You know I'm not a bad girl,. but I. Do bad things with you. So it goes.... Come here, dressed in black now. So, so, so it goes.... Scratches down your back now. So, so, so it goes.... Come here, dressed in black now. So, so, so it goes.... Scratches down your back now. So, so, so it goes..."
sparks fly,"The way you move is like a fool on rainstorm. And I'm a house of cards. You're the kinda reckless that should send me running. But I kinda know that I won't get far. And you stood there in front of me just. Close enough to touch. Close enough to hope you couldn't see. What I was thinking of. Drop everything now. Meet me in the pouring rain. Kiss me on the sidewalk. Take away the pain. 'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile. Get me with those green eyes, baby. As the lights go down. Give me something that'll hunt me when you're not around. 'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile. My mind forgets to remind me. You're a bad idea. You touch me once and it's really something. You find I'm even better than you. Imagined I would be. I'm on my guard for the rest of the world. But with you I know it's no good. And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would. Drop everything now. Meet me in the pouring rain. Kiss me on the sidewalk. Take away the pain. 'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile. Get me with those green eyes, baby. As the lights go down. Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around. 'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile. I run my fingers through your hair. And watch the lights go out. Just keep on keeping your eyes on me. It's just wrong enough to make you feel right. Lead me up the staircase. Won't you whisper soft and slow. I'm captivated by you baby. Like a firework show. Drop everything now. Meet me in the pouring rain. Kiss me on the sidewalk. Take away the pain. 'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile. Get me with those green eyes, baby. As the lights go down. Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around. 'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile. Sparks fly, baby smile, sparks fly"

speak now,"I am not the kind of girl. Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion.. But you are not the kind of boy. Who should be marrying the wrong girl.. I sneak in and see your friends. And her snotty little family. all dressed in pastels. And she is yelling at a brides maid. Somewhere back inside a room. Wearing a gown shaped like a pastery. This is surely not what you'd thought it would be.. I lose myself in a daydream.. Better stand and say,. Don't say yes.. Run away now.. I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door.. Don't wait or say a single vow.. You need to hear me out and they said speak now.. Fun gestures are exchanged. And the organ starts to play a song. That sounds like a death march. And I am hiding in the curtains. It seems that I was uninvided by your lovely bride to be.. She floats down the isle like a pageant queen.. But I know you wish it was me. You wish it was me. Don't you?. Don't say yes. Run away now. I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door.. Don't wait or say a single vow.. You need to hear me out and they said speak now.. Don't say yes. Run away now. I'll meet you when you're out at the church at the back door. Don't wait or say a single vow.. Your time is running out and they said speak now.. Oooooh, la la la, oh. Oooooh, la la la, oh. I hear the preacher say. ""speak now or forever hold your peace"". There's the silence. There's my last chance. I stand up with shaky hands. All eyes on me. Horrified looks from everyone in the room. But I'm only looking at you.. I am not the kind of girl,. Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion.. But you are not the kind of boy,. Who should be marrying the wrong girl.. So don't say yes. Run away now. I'll meet you in your alt at the church at the back door. Don't wait or say a single vow.. You need to hear me out, said speak now.. And you say. Lets run away now. I'll meet you in an alt in my tux at the back door. Hey hey, I didn't say my vow. So glad you were around when they said speak now."
spinning around,"Days go by, I wonder if you hear me. Can't you read between the lines. Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing. Take this chance, I'll make you mine. And don't you wonder why. You change in time. Makes you feel so empty inside. But love's got me cornered in the back of the room. I'm spinning around, spinning around. And all I see is someone I don't know. Love's got me tangled, tired me too. No sign of a wall, sign of a wall. Spinning me around. And baby all I see is you. He tells lies, are you really thinking. That you deserve another try. And when you see these eyes you see another planet. Don't ask how, but fate decides. And don't you wonder why. You change in time. Makes you feel so empty inside. But love's got me cornered in the back of the room. I'm spinning around, spinning around. And all I see is someone I don't know. Love's got me tangled, tired me too. No sign of a wall, sign of a wall. Spinning me around. And baby all I see is you. Spinning and turning and living and learning. I should be able to handle this. Make it or break it, move it or shake it. Do it or fake it, girl you've got to make it. But love's got me cornered in the back of the room. I'm spinning around, spinning around. And all I see is someone I don't know. Love's got me tangled, tired me too. No sign of a wall, sign of a wall. Spinning me around. And baby all I see is you. Spinning me around. And baby all I see is you. Spinning me around. And baby all I see is you"
starlight,"I said oh my, what a marvellous tune. It was the best night, never would forget how we moved. The whole place was dressed to the nines,. And we were dancing dancing. Like we're made of starlight. Like we're made of starlight. I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45. Picks me up, play one night at the window. He was 17 and crazy, running wild, wild. Can't remember what song it was playing. When we walked in. The night we snook into a yacht club party. Pretending to be a duchess and a prince. I said oh my, what a marvellous tune. It was the best night, never would forget how we moved. The whole place was dressed to the nines,. And we were dancing dancing. Like we're made of starlight, starlight. Like we're made of starlight, starlight. He still look at you worrying so much. About things you can't change. You'll spend your whole life singing the blues. If you keep thinking away. He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me. Don't you see the starlight, starlight?. Don't you dream impossible things?. Like oh my, what a marvellous tune. It was the best night, never would forget how we moved. The whole place was dressed to the nines,. And we were dancing, dancing. Like we're made of starlight, starlight. Like we're made of starlight, starlight. Ooh ooh he's talking crazy. Ooh ooh dancing with me. Ooh ooh we could get married. Have ten kids and teach them how to dream. Ooh ooh ooh. Oh my, what a marvellous tune. It was the best night, never would forget how we moved. The whole place was dressed to the nines,. And we were dancing, dancing. Like we're made of starlight, starlight. Like we're made of starlight, starlight. Like we're made of starlight, starlight. Like we dream impossible dreams. Like starlight starlight. Like we dream impossible dreams. Don't you see the starlight starlight. Don't you dream impossible things"
state of grace,"I'm walking fast through the traffic lights. Busy streets and busy lives. And all we know is touch and go. We are alone with our changing minds. We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time. And I never saw you coming. And I'll never be the same. You come around and the armor falls. Pierce the room like a cannonball. Now all we know, is don't let go. We are alone just you and me. Up in your room and our slates are clean. Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes. So you were never a saint. And I've loved in shades of wrong. We learn to live with the pain. Mosaic broken hearts. But this love is brave and wild. And I never saw you coming. And I'll never be the same again. This is a state of grace. This is the worthwhile fight. Love is a ruthless game. Unless you play it good and right. These are the hands of fate. You're my Achilles heel. This is the golden age of something good. And right and real. And I never saw you coming. And I'll never be the same. And I never saw you coming. And I'll never be the same. This is a state of grace. This is the worthwhile fight. Love is a ruthless game. Unless you play it good and right"
stay beautiful,"Cory's eyes are like a jungle. He smiles, it's like the radio. He whispers songs into my window. In words nobody knows. There's pretty girls on every corner. That watch him as he's walking home. Saying, does he know. Will you ever know. [chorus:]. You're beautiful. Every little piece love, don't you know. You're really gonna be someone, ask anyone. When you find everything you looked for. I hope your life leads you back to my door. Oh but if it don't, stay beautiful. Cory finds another way to be. The highlight of my day. I'm taking pictures in my mind. So I can save them for a rainy day. It's hard to make conversation. When he's taking my breath away. I should say, hey by the way. [chorus]. You're beautiful. Every little piece love, don't you know. You're really gonna be someone, ask anyone. When you find everything you looked for. I hope your life leads you back to my door. Oh but if it don't, stay beautiful. If you and I are a story. That never gets told. If what you are is a daydream. I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know. You're beautiful. Every little piece love, don't you know. You're really gonna be someone, ask anyone. When you find everything you looked for. I hope your life leads you back to my front door. Oh but if it don't, do you stay beautiful. Beautiful, beauti-ful, beautiful, beauti-ful.. Ohh la la la. Ohhh ohhhh. Oh but if you don't, stay beautiful.. Stay beautiful."
stay stay stay,"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night. I threw my phone across the room at you. I was expecting some dramatic turn away. But you stayed. This morning I said we should talk about it. Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved. That's when you came in wearing a football helmet. And said okay let's talk. And I said. Stay stay stay. I've been loving you for quite some time time time. You think that it's funny when I'm mad mad mad. But I think that it's best if we both stay. Before you I only dated self indulgent takers. Who took all of their problems out on me. But you carrying my groceries and now I'm always laughing. And I love you because you have given me no choice but to. Stay stay stay. I've been loving you for quite some time time time. You think that it's funny when I'm mad mad mad. But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay. You took the time to memorize me. My feels my hopes and dreams. I just like hanging out with you all the time. All those times that you didn't leave. It's been occuring to me. I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life. Stay and I'll be loving you for quite some time. No one else is gonna love me when I get mad mad mad. So I think that it's best if we both stay stay stay stay. Stay stay stay. I've been loving you for quite some time time time.

sweet tea & god's graces,"Tire swing, summer dreams. Honeysuckle on the breeze, Wilson County creek. Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass. Baby you were watching me. Cold barn, truck bed. Everything you said slowly educating me. I never had a lesson so sweet. You can get high on a first kiss. You can get by on sweet tea and God's graces.

You're the song in the car I keep singing,. Don't know why I do.. You walk by me.. Can you tell that I can't breathe?. And there you go, so perfectly.. The kind of flawless I wish I could be.. She better hold you tight,. Give you all her love,. Look in those beautiful eyes. And know she's lucky 'cuz... You're the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.. The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star.. You're the song in the car I keep singing,. Don't know why I do.. So I drive home alone,. As I turn out the light,. I'll put your picture down. And maybe get some sleep tonight.. 'Cause you're the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.. The only one that's got enough of me to break my heart.. You're the song in the car I keep singing,. Don't know why I do.. You're the time taken up,. But there's never enough.. And you're all that I need to fall into.. You look at me. I fake a smile so you won't see..."
tell me,It was something like a perfect start to. This love yesterday but now who are you. I thought I knew. Your eyes how to know to look right through me. It's like you forgot the words you whispered to me. They weren't true. It's like it wasn't you. Could you tell me what did I do. Because it can't be we're already through. Did you sell me out for a fool. After you held me is that just what you do. What did you need from me. Tell me. Take time to realise I know. That people change their minds. But that was something I wished you would say. To my face. But you run away. Could you tell me what did I do. Because it can't be we're already through. Did you sell me out for a fool. After you held me is that just what you do. What did you need from me. Tell me. If I had a reason or a simple goodbye. Baby even a lie. Yeah Yeah. Tell me what did I do. Beause baby suddenly we're already through. Did you sell me out for a fool. After you held me is that just what you do. What did you need from me. Tell me. And tell me. Ooooh Yeah. Tell me. Tell Me
tell me why,"I took a chance, I took a shot. And you might think I'm bulletproof, but i'm not. You took a swing, I took it hard. And down here from the ground I see who you are. I'm sick and tired of your attitude. I'm feeling like I don't know you. You tell me that you love me then you cut me down. And I need you like a heartbeat. But you know you got a mean streak.

ten dollars and a six pack,I knew what I wanted. When I wanted what I just couldn't have. You were country loving. Really something for three months and a half. Everybody said that you were bad news. But baby I was betting on you. So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack. Got myself a big country serving of payback. Now I'm gonna have to listen to my momma's. “I told you so”. You ain't worth all that. Ten dollars and a six pack. I said let them say we're crazy. You said let's go fishing tonight. Midnight you were blazing baby. I was easing into your arms. Everything changed when you took me to town. And caught you staring every other girl down. So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack. Got myself a big country serving of payback. Now I'm gonna have to listen to my momma's. “I told you so”. You ain't worth all that. Ten dollars and a six pack. I can't believe the time you lost me. I can't believe what it cost me. ‘Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack. Got myself a big old serving of payback. I had to listen to my momma's. “I told you so”. You ain't never been through that. ‘Cause you ain't worth all that. Ten dollars and a six pack. You ain't worth all that. Ten dollars and a six pack
tennessee,"Standing on a street. Somewhere I don't want to be. In a town that's made of stone. Some bad directions must have me here by mistake. 'Cause this sure ain't what I call home. Let me close my eyes for a second. See if I can get out of here and. Let my hair hang down. And I can feel the golden sun. And watch a pickup truck drive by. And I want to tell the world. How good it is to be right here. But I don't, I just sit under this tree. I'm in Tennessee. Standing on a road. Leading to a barn. With a cat named Eloise. Later on we'll all go fishing in the pond. But all we'll catch is just a summer breeze. Let me close my eyes for a second. See if I can stay right here and. Let my hair hang down. And I can feel the golden sun. And watch a pickup truck drive by. And I want to tell the world. How good it is to be right here. But I don't, I just sit under this tree. I'm in Tennessee. When the pond is gone and Eloise floats away. I find myself staring at the same old things. I need to go back, back where I feel so free. Well it looks like I'm going back to Tennessee. Let my hair hang down. And I can feel the golden sun. And watch a pickup truck drive by. And I want to tell the world. How good it is to be right here. But I don't, I just sit under this tree. Just me and Eloise. I'm in Tennessee"
that's life,"Like one of those fireflies. Oh it looks so good 'til it's in your hand. It's like one of those memories. Where you can't let go but you just can't stand. It's like one of those crazy dreams. And the permanent screens in the magazines. Saying why'd I love. All it does is break your heart. One morning does it all add up. Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy. You're getting close to giving up. In a big old way, knocks you down into the. Other side every time. Love or lie, live or die. I, well I guess that's life. Like one of those people. With the beautiful eyes and the perfect face. It's like one of those stories. Where the hero dies in the very last race. Like one of those endless cries. And the crazy lies of a hurting child. Why did love have to hurt. It broke my heart. One morning does it all add up. Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy. You're getting close to giving up. In a big old way, knocks you down into the. Darker side every time. Love or lie, live or die. I, well I guess that's life. I always liked to think. That I was always brave enough. To try to master any push and shove. Well I guess I never qualified love. One morning does it all add up. Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy. You're getting close to giving up. In a big old way, knocks you down into the. Other side every time. Love or lie, live or die. I, well I guess that's life"

the best day,I'm five years old. It's getting cold. I've got. My big coat on. I hear your laugh. And look up smiling at you. I run and run. Past the pumpkin patch. The tractor rides. Look now the sky is gold. I hug your legs and fall asleep. On the way home. I don't know why all the trees change in the fall. I know you're not scared of anything at all. don't know if Snow Whites house is near or far away. But I know I had the best day. With you today. I'm thirteen now. And don't know how my friends. Could be so mean. I come home crying. And you hold me tight. And grab the keys. And we drive and drive. Until we found a town. Far enough away. And we talk and window-shop. Until I forgot all their names. I don't know who I'm gonna talk to. Now at school. But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you. don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay. But I know I had the best day. With you today. I have an excellent father. His strength is making me stronger. God smiles on my little brother. Inside and out. He's better than I am. I grew up in a pretty house. And I had space to run. And I had the best days with you. There is a video. I found from back when I was three. You set up a paint set in the kitchen. And youre talking to me. It's the age of princesses and pirate ships. And the seven dwarves. Daddy's smart. And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world. Now I know why all the trees change in the fall. I know you were on my side. Even when I was wrong. And I love you for giving me your eyes. Staying back and watching me shine. And I didn't know if you knew. So I'm taking this chance to say. That I had the best day. With you today

the lucky one,"New in town with a made up name in the angel city. Chasing fortune and fame. And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream. You had it figured out since you were in school.

Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one. Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh. It was a few years later, I showed up here. And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared. How you took the money and your dignity. And got the hell out. They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere. Chose the rose garden over madison square. And it took some time, but I understand it now. 'Cause now my name is up in lights. But I think you got it right. Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one.

the moment i knew,"You should've been there,. Should've burst through the door,. With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,. And it would've felt like,. A million little shining stars had just aligned,. And I would've been so happy.. Christmas lights glisten,. I've got my eye on the door,. Just waiting for you to walk in,. But the time is ticking,. People ask me how I've been. As I comb back through my memory,. How you said you'd be here,. You said you'd be here.. And it was like slow motion,. Standing there in my party dress,. In red lipstick,. With no-one to impress,. And they're all laughing,. As I'm looking around the room,. But there's one thing missing,. And that was the moment I knew.. And the hours pass by,. Now I just wanna be alone,. But your close friends always seem to know. When there's something really wrong,. So they follow me down the hall,. And there in the bathroom,. I try not to fall apart,. And the sinking feeling starts,. As I say hopelessly,. ""he said he'd be here."". And it was like slow motion,. Standing there in my party dress,. In red lipstick,. With no-one to impress,. And they're all laughing,. And asking me about you,. But there's one thing missing,. And that was the moment I knew.. What do you say. When tears are streaming down your face,. In front of everyone you know?. And what do you do. When the one who means the most to you,. Is the one who didn't show?. You should've been here.. And I would've been so happy.. And it was like slow motion,. Standing there in my party dress,. In red lipstick,. With no-one to impress,. And they're all standing around me singing,. Happy birthday to you,. But there's one thing missing,. And that was the moment I knew.. Ooh, I knew.. You call me later,. And say I'm sorry I didn't make it.. And I say I'm sorry too,. And that was the moment I knew."
the other side of the door,"In the heat of the a fight. I walked away.. Ignoring words that you were saying,. Trying make me stay.. I said, ""this time I've had enough."". And you've called a hundred times,. But I'm not pickin' up.. 'cause I'm so mad,. I might tell you that it's over.. But if you look a little closer. I said, ""leave,"". But all I really want is you. To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles;. Screaming, ""I'm in love with you."". Wait there in the pourin' rain,. Come back for more.. And don't you leave,. 'cause I know all I need. Is on the other side of the door.. Me and my stupid pride. Sittin' here, alone.. Going through the photographs,. Staring at the phone.. I keep going back over. Things we both said.. And I remember the slammin' door,. And all the things that I misread.. Baby you know everything,. Tell me why you couldn't see. That when I left, I wanted you to. Chase after me?. I said, ""leave,"". But all I really want is you. To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles;. Screaming, ""I'm in love with you."". Wait there in the pourin' rain,. Come back for more.. And don't you leave,. 'cause I know all I need. Is on the other side of the door.. And I scream out the window,. ""I can't even look at you, I don't need you,"". But I do, I do, I do.. I'll say there's nothing you can say. To make right again, I mean it,. I mean it. What I mean is. I said, ""leave,"". But baby all I want is you. To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles;. Screaming, ""I'm in love with you."". Wait there in the pourin' rain,. Come back for more.. And don't you leave,. 'cause I know all I need. Is on the other side of the door.. With your face, and your beautiful eyes,. And the conversation,. With the little white lies.. And the faded picture. Of a beautiful night. You carry me from your car. Up the stairs. And I'm broke down cryin'. Was she worth this mess,. After everything in that little black dress. After everything, I must confess,. I need you"
the outside,"I didn't know what I would find. When I went looking for a reason, I know. I didn't read between the lines. And, baby, I've got nowhere to go. I tried to take the road less traveled by.

On the outside looking in. I've been a lot of lonely places. I've never been on the outside. You saw me there, but never knew. I would give it all up to be. A part of this, a part of you. And now it's all too late so you see. You could've helped if you have wanted to. But no one notices until it's too. Late to do anything. (chorus). So how can I ever try to be better?.

the story of us,"I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us. How we met and sparks flew instantly. People would say 'They're the lucky ones'. I used to know my place was a spot next to you. Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat. 'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on. Oh. A simple complication, miscommunication. Has lead to fallout. Too many things that I wish you knew. So many walls up I can't break through. Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room. And we're not speaking. And I'm dying to know. Is it killing you like it's killing me?. And I don't know what to say. Since the twist of fate. When it all broke down. And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now. Next chapter. How'd we end up this way?. Se me nervously pulling at my clothes. And trying to look busy. And you're doing your best to avoid me. I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us. How I was losing my mind when I saw you here. But you held your pride like you should've held me. Oh. I'm scared to see the ending. Why are we pretending this is nothing?. I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how. I've never heard silence quite this loud. Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room. And we're not speaking. And I'm dying to know. Is it killing you like it's killing me?. And I don't know what to say. Since the twist of fate. When it all broke down. And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now. This is looking like a contest. Of who can act like they care less. But I liked it better when you were on my side. The battle's in your hands now. But I will lay my armor down. If you say you'd rather love than fight. So many things that you wish I knew. But the story of us might be ending soon. Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room. And we're not speaking. And I'm dying to know. Is it killing you like it's killing me?. But I don't know what to say. Since the twist of fate. And it all broke down. And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now. Now, now. And we're not speaking. And I'm dying to know. Is it killing you like it's killing me?. I don't know what to say. Since the twist of fate. 'Cause we're going down.

You can't see she doesn't. But you just keep holding on. There's your trouble. Should have all worked out. But it didn't. She should be here now. But she isn't. (chorus). There's your trouble,. There's your trouble. You keep seeing double. With the wrong one. You can't see I love you,. You can't see she doesn't. But you just keep holding on. There's your trouble"
thirteen blocks (can't call it love),"Stumbled off the porch steps. Sat down in the car. Only thirteen blocks across this town. To get to where you are. And that don't offer me much time. To make up my mind. So I best be driving slow. On my way to letting go. These headlights they just want to fade. Off into the night. But if they're half as stubborn as me. They'll just keep shining bright. I ain't ever been one to settle. Like the dust that's on the dash. And since the feeling ain't strong. I'll just move on and leave this in my past. Once you're gone I know your memory. Will somehow get the best of me. So why question everything I do. Unsure of turning you away. Wondering about how I feel today. Until you found somebody new. So I've been holding on. Way too long. But not another minute. I might miss you that much. But you can't call it love if you ain't in it. Red light turns to green. Then back to red again. I wish there were some other travelers. Out here. To slow my traveling. Even though I can't hold on. Inside I still don't know. Oh, and it troubles me so. Once you're gone I know your memory. Will somehow get the best of me. So why question everything I do. Unsure of turning you away. Wondering about how I feel today. Until you found somebody new. So I've been holding. On way too long. But not another minute. I might miss you that much. But you can't call it love if you ain't in it. Once you're gone I know your memory. Will somehow get the best of me. So why question everything I do. Unsure of turning you away. Wondering about how I feel today. Until you found somebody new. So I've been holding. On way too long. But not another minute. I might miss you that much. But you can't call it love if you ain't in it. The car comes to a rest in the drive. You open up the door and I see you smile"
this here guitar,"Walking downtown shuffling my feet. I try to dream my dreams above the concrete. Store windows, traveled for miles. But something I passed really caught my eye. It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars. But I fell in love with this here guitar. Nice to meet you, can I teach you. All I know, can you show me what you do. Where have you been. What have you seen. Who were you before you even knew me. Have you been played for endless hours. Or were you left in the corner. Or were you someone's best friend. This here guitar. It was my baby, anyone could see. I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty. But I can't help wondering why. It came to me and where we'll say goodbye. The cracks down the middle.

this is really happening,"Beneath the chandelier of star and atmosphere. Tangled like the roots on the ground. The windows opened up. The wind is blowing and were both not making a sound. It's like i'm melting on into you. Give me a reason why we should ever move. And. Tell me. You'll never leave me. And i'm not crazy and. This is really happening. That this is really happening. Could this be better ?. You write me letters. So you see me everyday. You tend to treat me like. My name is up in lights. It really blows me away. Lock me up in a dark room. And i still can't take my eyes off you. Tell me. You'll never leave me. And i'm not crazy and. This is really happening. That this is really happening. All those kiss up against your car. For all those wishes on planes. We thought were stars. Memories like photographs. Oh baby, here we are. Tell me. You'll never leave me. And i'm not crazy and. Oh,this is really happening. That this is really happening. Oh,oh,baby. Tell me. You'll always need me. That i drive you crazy. And this is really happening. Oh,that this is really happening. Tell me,oh. You'll always need me.

this is why we can't have nice things,"It was so nice throwing big parties. Jumping in the pool from the balcony. Everyone swimming in a champagne sea. And there are no rules when you show up here. Bass beat rattling the chandelier. Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year. So why'd you have to rain on my parade?. I'm shaking my head. I'm locking the gates. This is why we can't. have nice things, darling. Because you break them. I had to take them away. This is why we can't have. nice things, honey. Did you think I wouldn't hear. All the things you said about me?. This is why we can't. have nice things. It was so nice being friends again. There I was giving you a second chance. But then you stabbed my back. While shaking my hand. And therein lies the issue. Friends don't try to trick you. Get you on the phone and mind-twist you. And so I took an ax to a mended fence. But I'm not the only friend. you've lost lately. If only you weren't. So shady. This is why we can't have. nice things, darling. Because you break them. I had to take them away. This is why we can't have. nice things, honey. Did you think I wouldn't hear. All the things you said about me?. This is why we can't have. Here's a toast to my real friends. They don't care about that he said, she said. And here's to my baby. He ain't reading what. they call me lately. And here's to my momma. Had to listen to all this drama. And here's to you. 'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do. Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face. This is why we can't have. nice things, darling. Because you break them. I had to take them away. This is why we can't have. nice things, honey. Did you think I wouldn't hear. All the things you said about me?. This is why we can't have. nice things, darling. (And here's to my real friends).

this love,"Clear blue water, high tides came. And brought you in. And I could go on and on, on and on. And I will. Skies grew darker, currents swept you out again. And you are just gone and gone. And gone, and gone. In silent screams and wildest dreams. I never dreamed of this. This love is good, this love is bad. This love is alive back from the dead. These hands had to let it go free. And this love came back to me. Tossing, turning. Struggled through the night. With someone new. And I could go on and on. On and on. Lantern burning. Flickered in my mind for only you. But you're still gone, and gone. And gone, and gone. In losing grip and sinking ships. You showed up just in time. This love is good, this love is bad. This love is alive back from the dead. These hands had to let it go free. And this love came back to me. This love left a permanent mark. This love is glowing in the dark. These hands had to let it go free. And this love came back to me. This love, this love, this love. Your kiss, my cheek. I watched you leave. Your smile, my ghost. I fell to my knees. When you're young, you just run. But you come back to what you need. This love is good, this love is bad. This love is alive back from the dead. These hands had to let it go free. And this love came back to me. This love left a permanent mark. This love is glowing in the dark. These hands had to let it go free. And this love came back to me. This love, this love, this love"

That you might not be the golden one. And you're tied together with a smile. But you're coming undone. I guess it's true that love was all you wanted. Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change. Hoping it will end up in his pocket. But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain. Oh, cause it's not his price to pay. Not his price to pay.... [chorus]. Hold on, baby, you're losing it. The water's high, you're jumping into it. And letting go... and no one knows. You cry, but you don't tell anyone. That you might not be the golden one.

till brad pitt comes along,"Do you remember the day I leaned up against your car?. And it started rolling down the street. You screamed and ran after it. Tried to open the door and it ran over your foot. And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see. It would take Brad Pitt to leave you. It takes five seconds to need you.

Cause that's where you belong. Til Brad Pitt Comes Along. Do you remember the time we watched Carrie. And you said it reminded you of me. And I threw the remote at you a. And you said ""My point exactly"". Later on that night under the. Neon city lights you paid a homeless guy. To sing a song to me and. It would take Brad Pitt to leave you.

Where I lost control. And couldn't take it any longer. Must have been somewhere between. Your smile and the way you say my name. I can't win so I give in. The more I fight it just get's stronger. You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction. Welcome distraction. I'm acting like a girl. With nothing to lose. When did I stop caring. About anything but you. And I don't know. Where I lost control. And couldn't take it any longer. Must have been somewhere between. Your smile and the way you say my name. I can't win so I give in. The more I fight it just get's stronger. You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction. Welcome distraction, welcome distraction. Welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh oh"

""Don't rush into things"". Didn't you flash your green eyes at me. Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?. Didn't it all seem new and exciting?. I felt your arms twisting around me. I should've slept with one eye open at night. We found wonderland. You and I got lost in it. And we pretended it could last forever. We found wonderland. You and I got lost in it. And life was never worse but never better. In wonderland, in wonderland. In wonderland, in wonderland. So we went on our way. Too in love to think straight. All alone, or so it seemed. But there were strangers watching. And whispers turned to talking. And talking turned to screams. Didn't they tell us. ""Don't rush into things"". Didn't you flash your green eyes at me. Didn't you calm my fears. With with a Cheshire cat smile?. Didn't it all seem new and exciting?. I felt your arms twisting around me. It's all fun and games 'til somebody. Loses their mind. But darling, we found wonderland. You and I got lost in it. And we pretended it could last forever. We found wonderland. You and I got lost in it. And life was never worse but never better. In wonderland, in wonderland. In wonderland, in wonderland. I reached for you, but you were gone. I knew I had to go back home. You searched the world for something else. To make you feel like what we had. And in the end, in wonderland. We both went mad. We found wonderland. You and I got lost in it. And we pretended it could last forever. We found wonderland.

you all over me,"Once the last drop of rain, has dried off the pavement. Shouldn't [?] , but I never do. The way the tires turn stones on old county roads.

Like the dollar in your pocket. that's been spent and traded in. You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me. I lived, and I learned, had you. Got burned. Held out, held on. God knows, too long, you wasted my time. Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here. No amount of freedom, gets you clean. I still got you all over me. Guess the worst day of June. Was the one that I met you. With your hands in your pockets. And your ""don't you wish you had me"" grin. I did, so I smile, and I melted like a child. Now every breath of air I breathe. reminds me of back then. Well I lived, and I learned, had you. Got burned. Held out, held on. God knows, too long, you wasted my time. Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here. No amount of freedom gets you clean. I still got you all over me. I lived, and I learned, and found out. what it was to turn around. And see that we were never really meant to be. So I lied, and I tried, and I watched a part of myself die. No amount of freedom, gets you clean. I still got you all over me. I still got you all over me. Na na na, na na na, Na na na, na na na na na. Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na, all over me. Na na na, na na na, Na na na, na na na.

you are in love,"One look, dark room. Meant just for you. Time moved too fast, you play it back. Buttons on a coat. Lighthearted joke. No proof, not much, but you saw enough. Small talk, he drives. Coffee at midnight. Moonlight reflects the chain on your neck. He says ""look up"". And your shoulders brush. No proof, one touch and you felt enough. You can hear it in the silence, the silence. You can feel it on the way home, way home. You can see it with the lights out, lights out. You are in love, true love. You are in love. Morning, his place. Burnt toast, Sunday. You keep his shirt, he keeps his word. For once, you let go. Of your fears and your ghosts. One step, not much, but it said enough. You kiss on sidewalks. You fight and you talk. One night he wakes, strange look on his face. Pauses, then says, ""you're my best friend"". And you knew what it was. He is in love. You can hear it in the silence, the silence. You can feel it on the way home, way home. You can see it with the lights out, lights out. You are in love, true love. So it goes. You two are dancing in a snowglobe round and round. And he keeps a picture of you. In his office downtown. And you understand now why. They lost their minds, and fought the wars. And why I've spent my whole life. Trying to put it into words. 'Cause you can hear it in the silence. You can feel it on the way home. You can see it with the lights out. You are in love, true love. You are in love. You can hear it in the silence, the silence. You can feel it on the way home, way home. You can see it with the lights out, lights out. You are in love, true love. You can hear it in the silence, the silence. You can feel it on the way home, way home. You can see it with the lights out, lights out. You are in love, true love. You are in love"

All this time, How could you not know, baby. You belong with me. You belong with me. Oh, I remember you Driving to my house. In the middle of the night. I'm the one who makes you laugh. When you know you're about to cry. And I know your favorite songs. And you tell me about your dreams. Think I know where you belong. Think I know it's with me. You can see that I'm the one Who understands you. Been here all along so why can't you see?. You belong with me. Standing by and waiting at your backdoor. All this time, how could you not know baby. You belong with me. You belong with me. You can see that I'm the one Who understands you. Been here all along so why can't you see?. You belong with me. Standing by and waiting at your backdoor. All this time, how could you not know baby. You belong with me. You belong with me. You belong with me. Have you ever thought, just maybe. You belong with me. You belong with me"
you're not sorry,"All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around. I've been giving out chances everytime and all you do is let me down. And its taking me this long baby but I figured you out. And you think it will be fine again but not this time around. You don't have to call anymore. I won't pick up the phone. This is the last straw. Don't want to hurt anymore. And you can tell me that you're sorry. But I don't believe you baby like I did before. You're not sorry... no, no, no, no. Lookin' so innocent. I might believe you if I didn't know. Could'a loved you all my life. If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold. And you got your share of secrets. And I'm tired of being last to know. And now you're asking me to listen. Cuz its worked each time before. But you don't have to call anymore. I won't pick up the phone. This is the last straw. Don't want to hurt anymore. And you can tell me that you're sorry. But I don't believe you baby like I did before. You're not sorry no no no noo. You're not sorry no no no noo. You had me calling for you honey. And it never would've gone away no. You use to shine so bright. But I watched all of it fade. So you don't have to call anymore. I won't pick up the phone. This is the last straw. There's nothing left to beg for. And you can tell me that you're sorry. But I won't believe you baby like I did before. You're not sorry no no no noo. You're not sorry no no no noo"
your anything,"Bet you lie awake at night,. Trying to make up your sweet mind. Wondering if you'll ever find just what you want. A home-town number one or a california loaded gun. But you know you'll make it one,. Well that's what you thought. Here's what you got:. (chorus). I could be your favorite blue jeans. With the holes inthe knees. In the bottom of the top drawer.. I could be your little beauty queen,. Just a little out of reach,. Or the girl living next door.. I'll be your angel giving up her wings.. If that's what you need,. I'd give everything to be your anything.. Be your anything. If you want hard to get, if you want... (giggles). All you have to do is let me know.. If you want a bumpy ride, or someone with a softer side. Either one'll be alright, just let me know.. Is this where we go?. (chorus). I could be your favorite blue jeans. With the holes inthe knees. In the bottom of the top drawer.. I could be your little beauty queen,. Just a little out of reach,. Or the girl living next door.. I'll be your angel giving up her wings.. If that's what you need,. I'd give everything to be your anything.. Be your anything. It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you. But with someone like you, it's just so easy to do.. (chorus). I could be your favorite blue jeans. With the holes inthe knees. In the bottom of the top drawer.. I could be your little beauty queen,. Just a little out of reach,. Or the girl living next door.. I'll be your angel giving up her wings.. If that's what you need,. I'd give everything to be your anything.. Be your anything. I could be your favorite blue jeans. With the holes inthe knees. In the bottom of the top drawer.. I could be your little beauty queen,. Just a little out of reach,. Or the girl living next door.. I'll be your angel giving up her wings.. If that's what you need,. I'd give everything to be your anything.. Be your anything"
your face,"I heard a song. Tonight on the radio. Another girl sings about a boy. She sees his face. In every space, every room. And I know that. If I turn around you. Won't be there. If I close my eyes. Will you be there?. Chorus:. I don't wanna lose your face. And I don't wanna wake up one day. And not remember what time erased. I don't wanna turn around. Cause I'm not scared. Of what love gave me and took away. And I don't wanna lose your face. I've got a picture of you. In my bedroom. And I hope it never falls. I hope I never lose that feelin. I used to get when you called. And then I wonder to myself. Who are you, where are you. Where you ever here at all?. Chorus:. I don't wanna lose your face. And I don't wanna wake up one day. And not remember what time erased. I don't wanna turn around. Cause I'm not scared. Of what love gave me and took away. And I don't wanna lose your face. That girl in the song. Had it so good. I wish I could close my eyes. And see you. I wish the sky had your face. And the oceans had your eyes. And the sunset had your lips. And I had you. Chorus:. Oh, yeah. I don't wanna lose your face. And I don't wanna wake up one day. And not remember what time erased. And I don't wanna turn around. Cause I'm not scared. Of what love gave me and took away. And I don't wanna lose your face. Oh, no, no. I don't wanna lose your face. I don't wanna turn around. Oh, oh, oh"
