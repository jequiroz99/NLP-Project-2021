keep on movin',"I woke up today with this feeling. That better things are coming my way (way). And if the sunshine has a meaning. Telling me not to let things get in my way. When the rainy days are dying. Gotta keep on, keep on trying. All the bees and birds are flying (ahh ahh ahh). Never let go, gotta hold on in. Non-stop 'til the break of dawnin'. Keep on movin' don't stop rockin' (ahh ahh ahh). Get on up when you're down. Baby, take a good look around. I know it's not much, but it's okay. Keep on moving anyway. Feels like I should be screaming. Trying to get it through to my friends. Sometimes it feels that life has no meaning. But I know things will be alright in the end. When the rainy days are dying. Gotta keep on, keep on trying. All the bees and birds are flying (ahh ahh ahh). Never let go, gotta hold on in. Non-stop 'til the break of dawnin'. Keep on movin' don't stop rockin' (ahh ahh ahh). Get on up when you're down. Baby, take a good look around. I know it's not much, but it's okay. Keep on moving anyway. When the rainy days are dying. Gotta keep on, keep on trying. All the bees and birds are flying (ahh ahh ahh). Never let go, gotta hold on in. Non-stop 'til the break of dawnin'. Keep on movin' don't stop rockin' (ahh ahh ahh). Get on up when you're down. Baby, take a good look around. I know it's not much, but it's okay. Keep on moving anyway. Get on up when you're down. Baby, take a good look around. I know it's not much, but it's okay. Keep on moving anyway...."

Must be to blind to see that I'm a fool once again. I'm tired of broken hearted. What a mess I've gotten. (Chorus). When all my dreams are shattered. Deep in my heart is all that matters. Deep in my heart is where ill keep all my love for you. Free.... (Chorus until fade).

I was to blind to see. I could have been yours for eternity. I didn't see it. 'til it was all up in my face. Do you recall. The times that we shared. Moment alone and promises. But now the days are gone. Now you're on your own. Tonight never again cos. Chorus. Now I know the truth. It really hurts inside. Cos every lie just twists the knife. The way I'm feelin'. There's just no remedy. No?. Do you regret. Things that you said. Every word broken promises. But now the days are gone. Now you're on your own. Tonight never again cos. Chorus. Ya hit me with the truth. Hit me with the raw fact. Put me on my back. What you gotta say to that. You got me with your lies. I was thinking we were set. Counting every second. Every day since we met. Remember in the times. When we used to have it all. But then came the fall. Feeling like we hit a brick wall. You can keep it the lies in my ears. You gonna shed tears. As your man disappears. Sit back and let me do my thing. Laced with the click and the 5 on the swing. I'm not the one who's gonna be plagued by your kind. 24-7 girl it's time to rewind. It's over just like a wack track. You can't get with this so you gotta get with that. No doubt in my mind the base so phatt. Baby let me bring it on a wiggy wack.. Chorus until fade."

reminiscing,"*Note: This is taken from 5iveweb, I'm not sure the lyrics are 100% true. I'll try to get the real ones soon, cos there's this missing part here too!*. Yo, I've got a little story that I'd like to address. To individuals, gotta get it off my chest. It ain't about who's the best. Or Five being better than the next. We're just a little different from the rest. Cos see, we got each other. When things go down. And time is just too important to be messin around. So understand not what i'm trying to say. But appreciate living life day to day. So how does it feel to be the only ones. Left out in the rain cos you're phoney ones. Wake up and realise what you live is a dream. Ain't gonna be there for long even though it may seem. Like a never ending story. You in it for the money or the glory. Open up your ears or ignore me. All I'm tryin' to do is be the man I am and be the best in this world I can. Reminiscing bout the time we used to share. If you feel it throw your hands up in the air. Time is running out, memories die. Keep movin on. Gotta keep movin on. You got to open your mind up and kick both your feet up. I'll hit you with a tale of how the five of us were meet up. We're just five guys who wanna rise to the skies. No ......... we got a vision in our eyes. Now people wanna step up and try to hold us back. They wanna try to stop us getting freaky on this track. But this is how we kick it and this is how we swing. And this is how I hit you with the funk that I bring. Now you gotta select to connect not disrespect. And you gotta learn to keep your negativity in check. Cos everybody knows what goes around comes around. I'll put it down with my sound. Reminiscing bout the time we used to share. If you feel it throw your hands up in the air. Time is running out, memories die. Keep movin on. Gotta keep movin on. Reminiscing bout the time we used to share. If you feel it throw your hands up in the air. Time is running out, memories die. Keep movin on. Gotta keep movin on. Reminiscing bout the time we used to share. If you feel it throw your hands up in the air. Time is running out, memories die. Keep movin on. Gotta keep movin on. Reminiscing bout the time we used to share. If you feel it throw your hands up in the air. Time is running out, memories die. Keep movin on. Gotta keep movin on. Reminiscing bout the time we used to share. If you feel it throw your hands up in the air. Time is running out, memories die. Keep movin on."

stop pushing me,"Stop pushing me. I never felt like this before. It's just something in me. I need to close another door. Live my life to suit me. I just can't hide the confusion that burns in my mind. Oh, no. Sometimes the pressure gets so high. Excuses come so easy. Just like a man lies to his wife. When honesty won't please her. I guess you'll find that I'm not what you think you can see. Not what you want me to be?. Chorus:. Stop pushing me. I gotta do it my way. Stop pushing me. Why don't you hear what I say?. Stop pushing me. Cos we all learn from mistakes. Stop pushing me. I'm gonna do it my way. It seemed to me like it won't end. But it was never meant to. Be more than just another trend. A phase that I would go through. You still don't see that I'm not your little baby no more. No. So please don't force me down that road. I'll choose where I'll be going. You can't dictate another day. Don't make me spend one more when. I wanna fight for myself. And be debted to nobody else. No one but myself. (Chorus). My way is the only way I trust. My way whatever the cost. Now don't get me wrong. The respect hasn't gone. But when can I have my say. And do it my way?. (Repeat chorus until fade)."

You see y'all snitchin niggaz talkin funny, basically. Me and my niggaz is known to keep it ugly, basically. [Capone]. I'm off Beezlebub, I walk wit the mac in my sweats. Air forces, wife beater, fitted cap to the left. My chain hang 35 inches, my heat 7 and a quarter. Beard 8 and a third, and my piece be Orca. There's no need for peace offers, my niggas be shootin, we riot. We run the streets quiet, cuz the law's biased. Skip the battles back in 86, now niggaz tattle, chop crazy bricks. Cop new kicks, quick to say they rich. Fantasize and flatten the hills, for niggaz in ghettos. Its crack, bullets that kill, dreams are fulfilled. Murders, ink in cold blood, holdin grudges for years. I keep two bitches, two hot biscuits, four dot sixes. The sorrow to swallow, I follow my motto. Squeeze first, since the day I slung, ready rockin a bottle. I stand and deliver like Edward Olmos, wet whatever. Respect whatever, I talk with a tech forever. [Algado]. Our show's at your service on behalf of Final Chapter. ? I'm not a rapper, quick to slap ya. Got scheme, its not a factor, we gotta shine first. Have 'em coppin your album just for our verse. Straight like that, y'all better tell 'em. I hope they don't act like we won't smack to back of their cerebellum. Oh and did I mention? if I feel tension. Get the full arm extension, get the whole block's attention. I know you keep your life in your cash. Your cash in the stash, stash in the car, car in the lot. So when I blow up the lot ::BOOM:: your whole shit stop. Y'all rappers is backwards, make the game flip flop. I'll take you to the spot with no witnesses and no cops. Better have your glock out and cocked, about to pop. To hustlers like Flynt, sellin cracks like Sprint. A dime a minute, now roll the dice, five in it. [Chorus 1 & 2]. [Final Chapter]. Aiyyo, aiyyo. I peeped your true colors while y'all niggaz was blinded. I been down and spit a pound before you knew I was rhymin. You know me, illest flow, ain't no seconds for timing. My sixteens'll rip through beats, cut deeper than diamonds. Make ya niggaz start to worry cuz my hood is dark and blurry. When shots flurry, niggaz point guard like Marbury. Ain't no arguing, all my click'll do is get the targeting. Final Chapter split pies in two, its half bargaining. I've seen you niggaz come up quick and then fall. I've seen you frontin for your broad like her pussy's the bomb. Clowns findin their stash gone but my cash is long. So I'ma let y'all pass on, cuz you ass like a thong. My click is movin out, now is you rollin along?. Til I perish I'm spittin strong, it's that shit that I'm on. Final Chapter's comin at ya, now the drama is born. Settle in this street life from the hoods to the lord. [Noreaga]. Aiyyo I'm still ghetto, that's why these niggaz love me. I'm still on the run eatin so I got chubby. I spaz up in the Tunnel, stab niggaz with pens. That's why til this day they don't let me in. I be in New York smokin LA weed. I hate a bitch named Pebbles like LA Reed. I dead niggaz like Pac and BIG, blocks to live. These niggaz can't eat like hostages. Fuck Camry's and fuck Honda Accords. I rob niggaz like the Crips at the Source Awards. And everything that went down was cool with me. As long as I came back with my jewelry. We had machine guns, I think we had two or three. And two or three limos, me and my nigga Timbo. For bitches that suck nuts and spit it out the window. You know my tempo, like Bloody Money 3. [Chorus 1 & 2]"

Time to break it down cos you're makin me high. (Yeah, I like that). (So what's up, check it). Baby when the lights go out. Every single word can not express, the love and tenderness. I'll show you what it's all about. Babe I swear you will succumb to me, so baby come to me. When the lights go out. (Repeat until fade)."

you and i,"Oh, you and I. The time we spent together ends too soon. Like sun sets to the moon. So breath my beautiful. I often find that I've been losing time. Cos what you said last night. That play upon my mind. Like thoughts of. Chorus:. You and I. You and I. It goes round my head like a carousel. And round and round my mind. You and I. You and I. I know what to do when I'm not with you. I fill my mind with thoughts of. You and I. You and I. A simple need of love is what you bring. It plays on my hearts strings. Songs of love to be loved. Got me thinking of. Our moments that are gone but will not fade. And we live to be replayed. In my mind overtime. Like thoughts of. (Chorus). Well I know we'll make mistakes. But that's just the chance we take. I hope you’ll never say. Cos I'll never say. Goodbye. Say goodbye. To you and I (You and I). You and I (You are always on my mind).

Busta Rhymes and Greg Nice we never fa-il. (You won't te-ll, I won't te-ll). My shit stay fresh never ever ever stale. (You won't te-ll, I won't te-ll). Foot shock to your ass just like the third ra-il. (You won't te-ll, I won't te-ll). Snitches get stitches when they go to ja-il. (You won't te-ll, I won't te-ll). Verse One: Greg Nice. Sometimes I feel like Bobby's World. Rocked the mic, before jheri curl. Single, mingle, no main girl. On the low, like Secret Squirrel. Uhh! It's time to Patti Duke. So shake whatcha mamma gave ya like Luke. It's Greg N-I always down to juice. Too much Hennesey make ya puke. Now I bust on indo dreams. Uhh, I don't be fuckin with keys. Rock the shell-top, or pin-striped Lee's. I could write a song make a hundred G's. You went back to high school, nuthin but a tease. Know I got stones, call me Mr. Please Please. Walkin down the street wit yo'. box in your hand... hot damn!. I never drove a Lex dog, never drove a Land. or a Testarossa, rather puff L's. and I sip on mimosa, bedroom wall. homegirl have my poster, I'm not surprised. That's the way it's supposed to, makes ya hot. Much hotter than a toaster, style elevates. like a roller coaster. Chorus. Verse Two: Busta Rhymes. Yo, the greatest unsolved mystery. of how I rotate your chicken golden rotissiere. Freak the cheesecake flow from here to Sicily. You really need to get offa my, hickory-dickory. The main attraction, even freaks the close caption. Snap break a piece off, a little small fraction. I still fulfill your dissatisfaction. I'm in the process, of completing a transaction. Huh, Carnegie Hall, like a opera singer nigga. Still doin the yes y'all, uhh!. Today we bust guns in the future we bustin lasers. Out of range in case you tried to reach me through my pager. I'm bout to blaze ya, with the flows that will amaze ya. Hot to death nigga, call me Smokin Joe Frazier. Seal up the box and present the closed casket. Busta Rhymes got the boombastic fruit basket. Bend your ass back, stretch you like elastic. More drastic when I be feelin fantastic, uhh!. Caught the chills stack the large bills barbeque on the grill. Me and my niggaz grant wills. Niggaz talkin shit but they ain't got no skills. Lookin like they full of shit your niggaz named you no frills. Don't let me catch you takin for granted. When my lyrical cause will leave y'all niggaz stranded. Distributed by, Warner Elektra and Atlantic. Niggaz thought they could fly, but really crash landed. Hah, when I'm in the place I'm up in your house. All y'all corny motherfuckers need to shut your mouth!. Chorus. [Greg Nice]. If you won't te-ll, I won't te-ll. If you won't te-ll (I said that I won't te-ll). I say if you won't te-ll..."
