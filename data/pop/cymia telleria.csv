Drippin' candy on the ground. (Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie). We teach girls to shrink themselves. To make themselves smaller. We say to girls. ""You can have ambition. But not too much. You should aim to be successful. But not too successful. Otherwise you will threaten the man"". Because I am female. I am expected to aspire to marriage. I am expected to make my life choices. Always keeping in mind that. Marriage is the most important. Now marriage can be a source of. Joy and love and mutual support. But why do we teach to aspire to marriage. And we don't teach boys the same?. We raise girls to each other as competitors. Not for jobs or for accomplishments. Which I think can be a good thing. But for the attention of men. We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings. In the way that boys are. Feminist - the person who believes in the social. Political, and economic equality of the sexes. You wake up, flawless. Post up, flawless. Ride round in it, flawless. Flossin on that, flawless. This diamond, flawless. My diamond, flawless. This rock, flawless. My rock, flawless. I woke up like this.

like a star,Just like a star across my sky. Just like an angel off the page. You have appeared to my life. Feel like I'll never be the same. Just like a song in my heart. Just like oil on my hands. Honor to love you. Still i wonder why it is. I don't argue like this. With anyone but you. We do it all the time. Blowing out my mind. You've got this look i can't describe. You make me feel like I'm alive. When everything else is a fade. Without a doubt you're on my side. Heaven has been away too long. Can't find the words to write this song. Oh... Your love. Still i wonder why it is. I don't argue like this. With anyone but you. We do it all the time. Blowing out my mind. I have come to understand. The way it is. It's not a secret anymore. 'cause we've been through that before. From tonight I know that you're the only one. I've been confused and in the dark. Now I understand. I wonder why it is. I don't argue like this. With anyone but you. I wonder why it is. I wont let my guard down. For anyone but you. We do it all the time. Blowing out my mind. Just like a star across my sky. Just like an angel off the page. You have appeared to my life. Feel like I'll never be the same. Just like a song in my heart. Just like oil on my hands
pretty hurts,"Miss Third Wards, your first question. What is your aspiration in life?. Oh My aspiration in life. Would be to be happy. Mama said, you're a pretty girl. What's in your head it doesn't matter. Brush your hair, fix your teeth. What you wear is all that matters. Just another stage. Pageant the pain away. This time I'm gonna take the crown. Without falling down, down. Pretty hurts. We shine the light on whatever's worse. Perfection is the disease of a nation. Pretty hurts. We shine the light on whatever's worse. Tryna fix something. But you can't fix what you can't see. It's the soul that needs the surgery. Blonder hair, flat chest. Tv says bigger is better. South Beach, sugar free. Vogue says. Thinner is better. Just another stage. Pageant the pain away. This time I'm gonna take the crown. Without falling down, down. Pretty hurts. We shine the light on whatever's worse. Perfection is the disease of a nation. Pretty hurts. We shine the light on whatever's worse. Tryna fix something. But you can't fix what you can't see. It's the soul that needs the surgery. Ain't got no doctor or therapeutic that can take the pain away. The pain's inside. And nobody frees you from your body. It's the soul that needs surgery. It's my soul that needs surgery. Plastic smiles and denial. Can only take you so far. And you break. When the paper signs you in the dark. You left a shattered mirror. And the shards of a beautiful girl. Pretty hurts. We shine the light on whatever's worse. Perfection is the disease of a nation. Pretty hurts. We shine the light on whatever's worse. Tryna fix something. But you can't fix what you can't see. It's the soul that needs the surgery. When you'r alone all by yourself. And you're lying in your bed. Reflection stares right into you. Are you happy with yourself?. It's just a way to masquerade. The illusion has been shed. Are you happy with yourself?. Are you happy with yourself?. Yes"
skyscraper,"Skies are crying, I am watching. Catching teardrops in my hands. Only silence as it's ending. Like we never had a chance. Do you have to make me feel like. There is nothing left of me?. You can take everything I have. You can break everything I am. Like i'm made of glass. Like i'm made of paper. Go on and try to tear me down. I will be rising from the ground. Like a skyscraper!. Like a skyscraper!. As the smoke clears, I awaken. And untangle you from me. Would it make you feel better. To watch me while I bleed?. All my windows still are broken. But I'm standing on my feet. You can take everything I have. You can break everything I am. Like i'm made of glass. Like i'm made of paper. Go on and try to tear me down. I will be rising from the ground. Like a skyscraper!. Like a skyscraper!. Go, run, run, run. I'm gonna stay right here. Watch you disappear, yeah. Go, run, run, run. Yeah it's a long way down. But I am closer to the clouds up here. You can take everything I have. You can break everything I am. Like i'm made of glass. Like i'm made of paper, Oh. Go on and try to tear me down. I will be rising from the ground. Like a skyscraper!. Like a skyscraper!. Like a skyscraper!. Like a skyscraper!"
the a team,"White lips, pale face. Breathing in snowflakes. Burnt lungs, sour taste. Light's gone, day's end. Struggling to pay rent. Long nights, strange men. And they say. She's in the class a team. Stuck in her daydream. Been this way since 18. But lately her face seems. Slowly sinking, wasting. Crumbling like pastries. And they scream. The worst things in life come free to us. Cos we're just under the upperhand. And go mad for a couple of grams. And she don't want to go outside tonight. And in a pipe she flies to the motherland. Or sells love to another man. It's too cold outside. For angels to fly. Angels to fly. Ripped gloves, raincoat. Tried to swim and stay afloat. Dry house, wet clothes. Loose change, bank notes. Weary-eyed, dry throat. Call girl, no phone. And they say. She's in the class a team. Stuck in her daydream. Been this way since 18. But lately her face seems. Slowly sinking, wasting. Crumbling like pastries. And they scream. The worst things in life come free to us. Cos we're just under the upperhand. And go mad for a couple of grams. But she don't want to go outside tonight. And in a pipe she flies to the motherland. Or sells love to another man. It's too cold outside. For angels to fly. An angel will die. Covered in white. Closed eye. And hoping for a better life. This time, we'll fade out tonight. Straight down the line. And they say. She's in the class a team. Stuck in her daydream. Been this way since 18. But lately her face seems. Slowly sinking, wasting. Crumbling like pastries. They scream. The worst things in life come free to us. And we're all under the upperhand. Go mad for a couple of grams. And we don't want to go outside tonight. And in a pipe we fly to the motherland. Or sell love to another man. It's too cold outside. For angels to fly. Angels to fly. To fly, fly. Angels to fly, to fly, to fly. Angels to die"
