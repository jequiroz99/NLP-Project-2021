i can't take it no more,"Ah yeah. What the fuck is going on?. All you scurvy politicians. When you're in opposition. You promise me this. You swear you'll do that. You all sound like magicians.

i don't mind,"Out by the desolate shore. The waves come in with a roar. The children are playing. Throwing stones in the water. Dogs are chasing. The seagulls are flickering, bickering, bickering. Horses are out in the pasture. Seeing who's running faster. And inside the house. A young girl is sewing. What a peaceful scene. Like a faded dream. It all looks like a sepia photograph. I don't mind. If you live in my mind. I'm happy to keep you there. And that's fine. Oh you. You're all that I like. And my imagination's clear. Ooooh. The sun shines bright on the water. I walk with my daughter. And the whole world is. Shimmering, shimmering, shimmering. I hear a churchbell ring. With a kind of lilt and swing. Just then the noise of the planes. Is shattering, shattering, shattering. Out by the desolate shore. By the marshy moor. The children were playing. Horses are out in the pasture. Saddled up for the master. Meanwhile the clouds are. Gathering gathering gathering. (then damian half sings half raps,. Another of his specialties). And even though you're just a figment. Of my thoughts I'm still loving every segment. And my imagination got me desperate. And you've already took away my next breath. Which means I'm doomed from the outset. Because I'm in love without an outlet. Which means I can't make no progress. Means my ambitions are hopeless. I want to wrap around you like a necklace. But I can't, so you got me moving reckless. To you I'd rather give more and take less. Because you got me want to conquer every conquest. I'm trying to tell you that I love you from the longest. I'm trying to tell you that my loving is the strongest. I'm trying to tell you that.... Sweet dreams are made of me. And who are you to disagree?"

never gonna change,"With your red red lips, on your white, white face. And your twisted smile, gone down a trace. And your father's money, and your mother's taste. And your sister's wardrobe all cinched in at the waist. What does it matter to me, now that you vanished 'cross the sea?. With your dancin' mind, and your sparkling wit. And your lit'rary connections that you care for not one bit. With your jewelry dripping off your hands, it's strange. I know you're never gonna change, your ways. What does it matter to me, now that you vanished 'cross the sea, yeah?. A pearl in the ocean so blue, that's what I think of when I dream about you. With your red red lips on your poor suckling skin. And your cocktail dress made for posing in. And your father's money and your mother's grace. You always have your very very own way. You're never gonna change. You're never gonna change, your ways. You're never gonna change, oh my. But you're never gonna change. You're never gonna change!"
