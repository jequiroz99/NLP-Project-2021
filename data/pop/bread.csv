i use the soap,"I use the soap to wash the dirt off my face. I write with pencil so that I can erase. But what's to do when someone's taken my place with you, with you. I know to stop when the light turns to red. And when it rains I know to cover my head. But what's to do when I wished I were dead over you, over you, over you. Do do do do do etc.. Plannin' to write off tomorrow. Do do do do do etc. Hopin' to wash off the sorrow. I woke to find that my world was not there. It ceased to me when I found you did not care. And my ambition vanished into thin air along with you, with you. Now my emotions find it hard to let go. And as for me I'll find a new road to hoe. But maybe this time I will take it more slow than before, before. Than before."
i want you with me,"Day breaks around me;. I've lost another night's iife.. Now it's as clear as it can be;. I want you with me.. Echoes surround me;. Shadows of things that once were.. They seem to say it so easy.. I want you with me, want you with me,. Want you with me, and I need you by my side.. I need you with me; my heart is pinnin' for you,. Soon I'll be back and then you'll see,. With you I want me.. I want and need you by my side.."
i would give anything,"You sheltered me from harm, kept me warm, kept me warm. You gave my life to me, set me free, set me free. The finest years I ever knew, were all the years I had with you. Chorus:. I would give anything I own, give up my life, my heart, my home. I would give anything I own, just to have you back again. You taught me how to laugh, what it solved, what it solved. You never said too much, but still you showed the way. And I knew from watching you. Nobody else could ever know, the part of me that can't let go. Chorus:. I would give anything I own, give up my life, my heart, my home. I would give anything I own, just to have you back again. You taught me how to laugh, what it solved, what it solved. You never said too much, but still you showed the way. And I knew from watching you. Nobody else could ever know, the part of me that can't let go. Is there someone you know, you're loving them so. But taking them all for granted. You may lose them one day, someone takes them away. And they don't hear the words you long to say. Chorus:. I would give anything I own, give up my life, my heart, my home. I would give anything I own, just to have you back again. You taught me how to laugh, what it solved, what it solved. You never said too much, but still you showed the way. And I knew from watching you. Nobody else could ever know, the part of me that can't let go. Just to touch you once again"
if,"If a picture paints a thousand words,. Then why can't I paint you?. The words will never show the you I've come to know.. If a face could launch a thousand ships,. Then where am I to go?. There's no one home but you,. You're all that's left me too.. And when my love for life is running dry,. You come and pour yourself on me.. If a man could be two places at one time,. I'd be with you.. Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.. If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die,. I'd spend the end with you.. And when the world was through,. Then one by one the stars would all go out,. Then you and I would simply fly away"
in the afterglow,"Here in the afterglow of what we've done,. What remains here in the after show. Of what we've seen.. Is it strange to be falling away now. Or would you say we should have known. It would end this way and both of us turn to dust.. We went deeper deeper in debt to games and lies. We got over our head and never realized. How, when or why.. But now as I sit reflecting on your face. In my hand. Now I can see your picture helps retrace. All the steps we took, places we went to,. Thoughts that we tried, tripping along. On a love we never understood with no guide.. Many things were taken for granted all along. Firm foundations never were planted. All went wrong.. We fell down, and broke in a million pieces,. We couldn't put it all together,. We couldn't put it all together again."
it don't matter to me,It Don't Matter To Me. It don't matter to me. If you really feel that. You need sometime to be free. Time to go out searching for yourself. Hoping to find time to go to find. And it don't matter to me. If you take up with someone. Who's better than me. 'Cause your happiness is all I want. For you to find peace your piece of mind. Lotta people have an ego hang-up. 'Cause they want to be the only one. How many came before it really doesn't matter. Just as long as you're the last. Everybody's moving on and try to find out. What's been missing in the past. And it don't matter to me. If your searching brings you back together with me. 'Cause there'll always be. An empty room waiting for you. An open heart waiting for you. Time is on my side. 'Cause it don't matter to me. It don't matter to me.....
just like yesterday,Just like yesterday. You come upon my mind and take it away.... Just like at the time. The things we did made our hearts skip away. Down on my knees I prayed. Kind woman don't go astray. When it seems at times. I've got my mind and heart all straight away.... Just when you've become. A mem'ry of the past and fade away. I see your face and think of all. Of all that we had. With of the things that you brought me. Now was it so bad. ... Makes me wonder.... Just like yesterday. You come upon my mind and take it away.. .

london bridge,"I know the times the times are hard to bear. It's hard to find someone to really care. But before I went down and out. Here's what I used to think about, think about:. London Bridge is always fallin' down,. But there it stood within the heart of town. Reminding everyone of life behind and life to come. The changes taking place are everywhere. The centuries past have nothing to compare. Where they stand, where they trip and fall. Watch the writing on the wall, on the wall. London Bridge is fallin' down at last,. And so another memory of the past. Has fell beneath the blade, but soon the dead may be repaid. I know things just can't evolve for all eternity. The thoughts will leave, will never die, and now so you can see. London Bridge is finally fallin' down,. It packed it up and shipped it outta town. And though the horror's gone, the memory will linger on. London Bridge is finally fallin' down,. It used to stand within the heart of town. Reminding everyone of life behind and life to come. London Bridge is finally fallin' down...... ."
look at me,I'm driftin' down the street. Asking of all I meet. Don't you know me from somewhere. Hazel eyes and curly hair. Have you seen me anywhere. Look at me. I'm blending into the wall. And I wonder. If I'm really here at all. Time goes by. So do I. But no one blinks an eye. Mirrors aren't reflecting me. Laws aren't protecting. And no one's expecting me. On the edge. I feel like I'm going to fall. And I wonder. If I'll never land at all. Loneliness comes and stays. Torturing nights and days. People stare but cannot speak. Hearts are strong. But tongues are weak. Maybe all our minds are meek. Look at me. I'm fading into the floor. And I wonder. If I'm living anymore
look what you've done,"You have taken the heart of me and left just a part of me. Look, look, look what you've done.. Well, you took all the best of me, so come get the rest of me. Look back, finish what you've begun. Be done.. There is someone you ought to meet, it's Me, Mister Incomplete. Look at what I've become. For it's due to the lack of you that I'm now only half of two. Look back, finish what you've begun. Be done.. Come and sit by my side, where there's nothing to hide. And we'll try to decide what you've needed.. But from where I stand today, I can't think of a way. Or the words that I might say that could change your mind. And make you stay, oh no, not for all the times I've pleaded.... Look, look, look, look what you've done.. You have taken the best of me, so come get the rest of me. Look back, finish what you've begun. Be done. Oh, be done, be done.."
lost without your love,Lost and all alone. I always thought that I could make it on my own. Since you left I hardly make it through the day. My tears get in the way. And I need you back to stay. I wonder through the night. And search the world to find. the words to make it right. All I want is just the way it used to be. With you here close to me. I've got to make you see. That I'm lost without your love. Life without you isn't worth the trouble of. I'm as helpless as a ship without a wheel. A touch without a feel. I can't believe it's real.... And someday soon I'll wake. And find my heart won't have to break. Yes I'm lost without your love. Life without you isn't worth the trouble of. All I want is just the way it used to be. I need you here with me. Oh darlin' can't you see.... If we had love before. We can have it back once more
love is always seventeen,Seventeen.... It's been a while since I've been seventeen. And the years since have been mighty lean. But there's no use complaining. Forty-two.... has a way of creeping up on you. And my chances left are getting few. But there's till time remaining.. I've been waiting for someone. Who loves the way I do. And girl I've got my fingers crossed. In hopes it might be you.... Twenty-one.... that's how many different jobs I've done. I remember quitting every one. With no hesitating. And thirty-three.... that's how many women left on me. I don't have too good a history. But I don't mind waiting.... Cause it really doesn't matter. How many years you've seen. Cause Love is Always Seventeen. Wonder if you'll be the one. To end this lonesome heart. 'Cause girl I've got a lot to give. And I'd sure like to start.
make it by yourself,"You say you're down and out. And need some help to get you through each day. Well, here's a thought or two. I've used and like to pass them on your way. I found them lying there. The answers that you say you're looking for. Make what you will of them. And you can change the way it was before. You got to make it by yourself. You know you got to make it by yourself. I'll be your friend and I'll lend a helping hand. But you got to try and help yourself before I can. I hear you talk of all the happiness. And emptiness you've known. Well, let me reassure you. Never were you really all alone. They say in quiet desperation many people cannot see. They cannot see the simple truth. That's not the way it has to be. You got to find it for yourself. God helps the man who helps himself, amen. I am your friend and I'll lend a helping hand. But you gotta try and help yourself before I can. We got to help each other (each other). You got to help your brother when you can. When you can. . Now don't you think that I was preachin'. I'm just reachin' out for you. 'Cause that's the only way. That I know how to get the message through. Then you in turn and got to learn and teach it. To somebody who. Who felt the happiness and emptiness the same as you. ."

picture in your mind,"Used to be my pleasure. When I'd wake up in the morning. Just to open my eyes and see you. Just to find you were lying there. But mornings now they seem to be an everyday affair. I'm just a picture in the memory of your mind. All I ever wanted. Every dream that I've ever cherished. Was to share in a kind of magic. That only lovers ever share. All you ever offered me. Was the moment then and there. I'm just a picture in your mind. I used to want you, oh how badly did I want you. I could not stand the hunger. I used to stay awake at night and think of nothing but you. And when I would awake to find you lying there beside me. It made me so damn happy. I couldn't satisfy my craziness for you. . Now the spell is broken. And my dreams they've all turned to ashes. But I still have a love for living. By loving you I've only just begun. Love is never easy when it's given just by one.

she was my lady,No one has heard. No one has seem her. Nobody else. Carin' but me. She was a child. She was a woman. When she was here - She was my lady. Never before. Was I dependin'. Then she came on. Filled in my life. She kept me on. My best behavior. She was my lord - She was my savior. She became my sanctuary. Some place I could lay me down. She would always help to carry.

Now she's the only one. She knows too well that she's the only one. She doesn't care if you're the lonely one. You want to say it's over, but it's just begun. She's the only one. She knows too well that she's the only one. She doesn't care if you're the lonely one. It's not the way you planned it. But she's really got you on the run. Your one and only one."
someday,"Love me. Forget about tomorrow now and love me. There’s time enough to borrow from another day. So just for now. Let’s touch and do the things that drive my cares away. Hold me. Forget the world outside tonight and hold me. And by the flickering candle light. Our love will glow. And then we’ll share the words and feelings no one else will ever know. We should never end. Hand in hand we’ll walk the night forever. But if it can’t be so. There’s one more thing I need before I go. Just kiss me. And tell me when I’m gone how much you miss me. Forget the lonely in between. And then someday. We’ll open up our eyes and see the world we thought so far away. Someday, someday"
summer breeze,"See the curtains hangin' in the window, in the evenin' on a Friday night.. A little light a-shinin' through the window, lets me know everything is alright.. Summer breeze, makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.. Summer breeze, makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.. See the paper layin' in the sidewalk, a little music from the house next door.. So I walked on up to the doorstep, through the screen and across the floor.. Summer breeze, makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.. Summer breeze, makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.. Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom. July is dressed up and playing her tune.. And I come home from a hard day's work, and you're waiting there, not a care in the world.. See the smile a-waitin' in the kitchen, food cookin' and the plates for two.. See the arms that reach out to hold me, in the evening when the day is through.. Summer breeze, makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.. Summer breeze, makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind"
sweet surrender,"Sweet Surrender. Baby I'm through runnin' it's true. I'd be a fool to try to escape you. Maybe I'm beat but oh what a sweet surrender. You keep your rights, I'll take your nights. No one can lose when we turn the lights out. Tastin' defeat, lovin' that sweet surrender. I'm givin' up myself to you but I didn't really lose at all. I gave the only love I've known and it never hurt me to fall. Now that it's done, so glad you won. I know our lives have only begun now. No more retreat, only my sweet surrender."
take comfort,"Take comfort where you find it. whatever gets you through. Take comfort don't be blind to it. You must do what's a right for you. Every one at times must run for cover. Don't you know you really can't be blamed. For in this you're just like any other. There's no need, no need to feel ashamed. Take comfort where you see it. Whatever makes it right. Take comfort when you need it. To help you through the night. By the way we live in our confusion. And the way that we misspend our youth. By the time we're stripped of our illusions. We may find illusions are the truth."

tecolote,"Voodoo woman made a doll of me. And ever since then I been in misery. She said I did her pretty little daughter bad. And ever since then she's been driving me mad. Let me go, let me go, Tecolote. Set me free, let me be, Tecolote. Drums keep beatin' in my head all night. Poltergeists knockin' on my left and right. Pain and a fever running 103. Just because her daughter wants to marry me. Rather die, rather die than get married. Let me go, tell her no, tell her no. (Solo). You heard my story and you now know why. A strange old woman makes a grown man cry. And next time a pretty pretty turns your head. You better take a look at her mother instead. Let me go, let me go, Tecolote. Let me be, set me free, let me free. ."
the air that i breathe,"If I could make a wish. I think I’d pass. Can’t think of anything I need. No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound. Nothing to eat, no books to read. Making love with you. Has left me peaceful, warm, and tired. What more could I ask. There’s nothing left to be desired. Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak. So sleep, silent angel, go to sleep. Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe. And to love you. All I need is the air that I breathe. Yes to love you. All I need is the air that I breathe. Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak. So sleep, silent angel, go to sleep. Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe. And to love you. All I need is the air that I breathe. Yes to love you. All I need is the air that I breathe. . Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe. And to love you. All I need is the air that I breathe. Yes to love you. All I need is the air that I breathe. And to love you. All I need is the air that I breathe. Yes to love you"
the chosen one,"I was your first and you were my last. And we are the journey's end. I was the blues and you were my sunshine friend. Now I'm your lover, you are my cover. Keeping the loneliness from me. You are my chosen one... arise and be the one. The chosen one. You are the sea and I am the sailor. Riding the perfect wave. I could've drowned but you came around and save me. She won't play your game. Now I'm your hopes and you are my dreamer. Helping me see beyond tomorrow. You are the chosen one... you'll always be the one. The chosen one. Out of the darkness, out of the shadow. Oh wherever you go, I'll follow along. Wherever you lead me, wherever you need me. I'll bring you my message, I'll bring you my song. You are the chosen one... arise and be the one. The chosen one. Darlin' I choose you, I'll never use you. I couldn't abuse you with all that you've done. You are my sunshine, you are my lifeline. Forever my sweet wine, forever the one."
the guitar man,"Who draws the crowd and plays so loud,. Baby it's the guitar man.. Who's gonna steal the show, you know. Baby it's the guitar man,. He can make you love, he can make you cry. He will bring you down, then he'll get you high. Somethin' keeps him goin', miles and miles a day. To find another place to play.. Night after night who treats you right,. Baby it's the guitar man. Who's on the radio, you go listen. To the guitar man. Then he comes to town, and you see his face,. And you think you might like to take his place. Somethin' keeps him driftin' miles and miles away. Searchin' for the songs to play.. Then you listen to the music and you like to sing along,. You want to get the meaning out of each and ev'ry song. Then you find yourself a message and some words to call your own. And take them home.. He can make you love, he can get you high. He will bring you down, then he'll make you cry. Somethin' keeps him movin', but no one seems to know. What it is that makes him go.. Then the lights begin to flicker and the sound is getting dim. The voice begins to falter and the crowds are getting thin. But he never seems to notice he's just got to find. Another place to play,. Anyway got to play, anyway Got to play.."
the last time,"Hey, didn't you believe me when I told you I was leavin'?. Well, wait a little while and soon you will be believin'. I'm tellin' you now like I told you before. That love has got to be somethin' more. Than a pasttime, this is the last time. This is the last time that I will say goodbye. You say it doesn't mean a thing. Let's see what the future brings. In the past, I've changed my mind, but. This has got to be the last time. Well, didn't you believe it when I said you don't know how to love me?. You, you never understood that you weren't so high above me. I didn't realize 'til a moment ago. That time doesn't really go this slow. And it's past time, this is the last time. CHORUS. Whatcha gonna do when nights are gettin' colder, baby?. Where ya gonna go, you know you're gettin' older, baby?. Guess you're gonna have to be a little bolder, baby. Whatcha gonna do to satisfy your hunger, baby?. Oh, don't it seem that everyone's a-gettin' younger, baby?. Guess you're gonna have to find yourself another past time. Judgin' from the past, I know it won't be the last time. CHORUS."
the other side of life,"So as you go to find yourself,. Don't look too hard,. You may pass yourself by,. Reaching too high,. Wanting the other side of life.. And as you go to take your place,. Don't go too fast,. Just pretend there's no end,. Make yourself last. Till the other side of iife.. One day you'll find. Your restless searching at an end,. You'll think the world has changed. But it's just you my friend.. So as you go to please your heart.. Please take your time,. Someone's waiting there too,. Waiting for you. On the other side of life.. She's waiting for you. On the other side of life.."

this isn't what the governmeant,"Sure gets funny thinkin' 'bout money. Makin' my daily bread. The more you make, the more they take. You never seem to get ahead. You break your backs just to pay your tax. Then you don't like the way that it's spent. Somewhere back we jumped the track. This isn't what the governmeant. Bet my now I've made a hundred thou. But I ain't saved a dime. The IRS came out best. They got my money every time. It caÃ­n't be fair when the millionaire. Never has to give them a cent. Sad to say we've lost the way. This isn't what the governmeant. Then the war, don't know what for. Somebody said it had to be fought. I'se sposed to go but I said no. 'Cause I'se afraid I might get shot. but here I am on my hands and knees. scrubbin' in my dungarees. I got burned but I finally learned. This isn't what the governmeant"
today's the first day,"Empty nights - endless days. Sometimes love turns out that way. Yes I know - it went too fast. But you can't keep livin' your life in the past. Today's the first day of the rest of your life. It's up to you to make the best of your life. Open your eyes it's another day. She was there - she was gone. You don't know how you'll get along. I've been there - and I recall. Better that than never to have loved at all. Today's the first day of the rest of your life. You've got to go and make the best of your life. For every night there's another day. Yes you say you've been in love before. You've been around and you know the score. But when the tears fill your eyes. Then sometimes they can blind you. So my friend - you must know. Love will come - and love may go. But when it does don't despair. Every space has someone just meant to be there. Today's the first day of the rest of your life. I know you're gonna make the best of your life. Today's the first day of the rest of your life. Lift up your eyes, it's the rest of your life. ."
too much love,"Too much sorrow, too much pain. Too many reasons not to go back again. Living without her is too much to bare. But when we're together, too much nothing to share. But too much love, I've never seen. Too much love, I don't know what it means. Not enough caring, too many lies. Sooner or later, one too many goodbyes. I got no reason for hanging around. When all my possessions start to weighin' me down. But too much love, I've never known. Too much love, I need some of my own. [break]. But too much love, I've never known. Too much love, I need some of my own."
took the last train,"Took The Last Train. Took the Last Train to St. Tropez. Had in mind to dance the night away. Experimented with a cognac high. When in France you give everything a try. Soon the crowd dwindled down to two. Not a soul around but me and you. You just smiled in French and took my hand. Spoke the words I tried my best to understand. You're tellin' me-. Viens chez moi. Ce soir va jamais terminer. On va rester toujours ensemble-you're. tellin' me. Come with me. Tonight will last forever. We will stay together always. Woke the next day and found her note. Love ya, goodbye that's all she wrote. And every night down at the place we met. I wait for her and those sweet words I. can't forget. You're tellin' me-. Viens chez moi. Ce soir va jamais terminer. On va rester toujours ensemble-'cause. I want you to. Come with me. Tonight will last forever. We wiii stay together always"
truckin',Truckin' down the highway. Get outta my way. Always in a hurry. Always in between. That's where you can find me. Truckin' down the highway. Sittin' in the cab of. A ten ton machine. Gettin' pretty tired of stoppin'. In old run down cafes. Some day I'm gonna find me a woman. Rich enough to pay my way. Gonna make some inroads. Drivin' home a payload. Truckin' down the highway. Like you never seen. Gettin' pretty tired of lookin'. In truck stop cabarets. Some day I'm gonna find me a woman. Rich enough to pay my way. Then you're gonna find me. Truckin' down the highway. Sittin' in the back seat of. A long limousine
welcome to the music,"Welcome to the music - welcome to the Guitar man. Know you're gonna love it - gonna do the best we can. And to help us along - think we're gonna need us a band. Lately we been playin' - travelin' in the jets and cars. Smilin' at the people - lookin'at the rock and roll stars. I tell you Carnegie Hall's better than those honky tonk bars. Well if it's true what music can do. To soothe the savage beast like they say. Well just relax and lie on your backs. 'Cause beastly is the way we play. Now we're through talkin' - gonna speak another day. Love to play it funky - love to hear the symphony. And to star us along - Larry's gonna play it in ""C"". Don't touch that dial - won't you come and stay for awhile.."
what a change,"You could be the answer to my lonely dream. It's my only dream. Dream it every night. It's about a girl who makes the waters still. Takes my troubled mind. And makes it all seem right.... Oh what a change, what a change that would be. I can feel it comin' over me,. Maybe it's strange, strange to say. But I can't remember how. How it used to be.. You could be the answer or another dream. Just another dream. How will I know. I'm afraid to wake up now and face the day. Comes the light of day. She'll have to go or stay.... Oh what a change, what a change that would be. Just to wake and find you still here,. 'Cause every time, time before. When I open up my eyes. You always disappear.. We could sit and hope that you'll be seen. We could talk about the world and in between,. And when the morning light was through. Then I could see if it was really you.."
why do you keep me waiting,"Oh, my love, why do you keep me waiting?. What, my love, are you contemplating?. Time goes by still you never bat an eye,. Tell me why, my love, do you have to stay far away?. Late at night while I lay asleepin',. Pale moonlight through my window weepin',. I see you in a color fantasy, cover me. Why, my love, do you have to fade away,. Have to fade away? Why my love, won't you tell me. Why, my love, do you keep me waiting? Why, my love,. Are you hesitating? Time goes by, are you waiting. For another day? Tell me why you think. Time will never fade away?."
you can't measure the cost,"The silken skies that so remind and mesmerize. And finally blind me. The downy softness of herself forever lingering. Behind me. Never ever has there been. Nor will ever be again. One someone to give you love, tenderness and be. Your friend. Hanging on 'till the bitter end. You can't measure the cost of a woman lost. But it's a heavy loss indeed for those in need.. I've tried to look inside myself. To find the strength from which to draw from. The view she saw from.. Since she tried to go too deep. Limitations brought her down. And though I'd like to free her mind. Visitations bring a frown. I gotta find the place she found. You can't measure the cost of a woman lost. But it's a heavy loss to bear when she's not there.. Where she is no one seems to know. The silken skies have swallowed her up or so it seems.. The morning mist that melts upon the meadow. Brings a touch of sorrow. The one I kissed is all alone. And may or may not know tomorrow.. Just an ordinary girl. To the ordinary eye. But so much deeper goes the vein. Like the glittering of gold you want to touch. Then you gotta hold. You can't measure the cost of a woman lost.. ."
your song,"Elton John. It's a little bit funny this feeling inside. I'm not one of those who can easily hide. I don't have much money but boy if I did. I'd buy a big house where we both could live. If I was a sculptor, but then again, no. Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show. I know it's not much but it's the best I can do. My gift is my song and this one's for you. And you can tell everybody this is your song. It may be quite simple but now that it's done. I hope you don't mind. I hope you don't mind that I put down in words. How wonderful life is while you're in the world. I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss. Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross. But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song. It's for people like you that keep it turned on. So excuse me forgetting but these things I do. You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue. Anyway the thing is what I really mean. Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen."
yours for life,In this day and age where changes happen twice as fast. Sometimes I get wonderin' if anything will last. People changin' partners like they change their underwear. Maybe I'm old-fashioned but darlin' I still care.. Refrão. And I'm yours for life. Come and be my lifetime. Come and take the love I have for only one. Yes I'm yours for life. Come and share my lifetime. Share the world until our day is done.. Time that I first saw your face I loved you where you stood. In your eyes a kindness - told me you were good. And if the world could share your heart there'd never be a war. And darlin' if I tried and tried I could not love you more. Refrão. Sometime I pray that you will always be the way you always. Are to me. 'Cause if I lost you to the winds of change then I would cease to be.
