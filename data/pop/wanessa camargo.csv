No Gucci. No Prada. Valentine's Day got nada. My friends say you're trouble. Always some kind of drama. Don't need all that money. Don't need a private jet. Cause when you're with me. All you need is what you get. Can't you see I'm taking this too long. Would you even notice if I was gone?. (Chorus). When you see what you lost. You won't wanna pay the cost. You'll curse it. I'm so worth it. Just shut up! Let me say. Don't throw it all away. We were perfect. I'm so worth it. I'm so worth it. I'm worth it. (Bridge). It's so much better. When we're together. Life's so much richer. And you have me to thank. Our money in the bank. When you see what you lost. You think of your house in Miami. Jacuzzi and flat screen. Party like on MTV. When you see what you lost. You think of your car and your money. You'll curse. I'm so worth it. I'm worth it. I'm worth it. (Chorus). When you see what you lost. You won't wanna pay the cost. You'll curse it. I'm so worth it. Just shut up! Let me say. Don't throw it all away. We were perfect. I'm so worth it. I'm so worth it
you can let me down,"Let me feel the scars on your heart. So I can sing you to sleep. Let me touch the tears as you cry. So I can hold you as you weep. You don’t have to keep it all inside. I will keep your secrets like their mine. So you can fly or you can fall. You can even lose it all. I’m gonna love you. You can let me. Hurt for you a little while. Just until see your smile. You can let me, you can let me down. I need to be the place in this world. You wanna run to always find peace. I love you when the hope is all gone. I love you strong and I love you weak, yeah. Whether you triumph or break. You know I’ll stand beside you either way. And every time you need me. I love you more believe me. I’m here"
