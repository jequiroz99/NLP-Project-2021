bleeding love (feat. gabi wilson),"Bleeding love. Closed off from love. I didn't need the pain. Once or twice was enough. And it was all in vain. Time starts to pass.

Thinking i'm going crazy. But i don't care what they say. I'm in love with you. They try to pull me away. But they don't know the truth. My heart's crippled by the vain. That i keep on closing. You cut me open and i. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. I keep bleeding. I keep, keep bleeding love. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. You cut me open. Trying hard not to hear. But they talk so loud. Their piercing sounds fill my ears. Try to fill me with doubt. Yet i know that the goal. Is to keep me from falling. But nothing's greater than the rush. That comes with your embrace. And in this world of loneliness. I see your face. Yet everyone around me. Thinks that i'm going crazy. Maybe, maybe. But i don't care what they say. I'm in love with you. They try to pull me away. But they don't know the truth. My heart's crippled by the vain. That i keep on closing. You cut me open and i. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. I keep bleeding. I keep, keep bleeding love. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. You cut me open. And it's draining all of me. Oh, they find it hard to believe. I'll be wearing these scars.

coldest heartbreak (jdrew feat. jasmine),"Can't believe Iever let you do this to me. But I'm here to let you know. That I'm done with it,so listen. (JDrew). My heart weeps tears that I can't wipe,. Love is blind,so I feel like I've lost sight. This is wrong,but the beginning felt so right,. Hard to rely,. Nature called and said ""I must fight"". For what is right , (so should I go?). And make it right again .... Everytime I tried it always seems like you lie again. When the boy cries , but the truth is just disguising him. But the ugly truth is that , that you speak words. that don't mean dire to him. (JDrew). Lie again. Why is it you do me this way ??. It's like I'm dancin' with the devil and there's no place to escape !. Plus what really hurts the most is you can't say this to my face,. I try to hold on , but you keep pushing me away. (Jasmine V). It's killing me , killing me , killing me softly. Killing me , killing me. When you put it on me ,. Black cats , black hearts filled with black roses,. I'm froze, can't feel,of course you wouldn't notice !. So go ahead and leave me in the cold. I feel much better when I know you're gone. Is there ice running through your soul ?. How could you treat me so cold ?. (JDrew). Now I've shine light through the dark. And picked up all the pieces that belong to my heart. Never again ,. Never again will I ever fall apart. When I go wrong , I'm looking back from the start. I gave you love , I gave trust , I gave you honestly. I gave in,even when,you owed me apologies. Just to make things right , I put aside , what was right to me,. Then I finally realized,that you'll always put it all on me. Now I know I never did you wrong,. You left me in the cold,. So I'm finally moving on,. No more controlling me ,. Or holding me back,. It took the cold to solve but to wake me up from all that,. (Jasmine V). Because it's killing me , killing me , killing me softly. killing me , killing me ,. When you put it on me. Black cats,black hearts filled with black roses,. I'm froze,can't feel of course you wouldn't notice. So go ahead and leave me in the cold. I feel much better ... Yeah .... Is there running through your soul?. How could treat me so cold ?. So cold,so cold, I'm froze.. From all the lies and the lies you told .... I can't feel,. Can't move,. Can't trust,. Finally had a shot but. I've had enough...

coldest heartbreak pt. ii,"It's a cold, cold world. It's a cold, cold world. Baby, it's cold. How could you treat me so cold?. I should've listened to em when they said don't let you in. That you'll never change - you'll do me wrong again. How foolish of me - thinkin you'd pay for your sins. Fooled me once, that's on you. Now this time, me on ten. I forgave you, tried to save you from the person you became. Gave you chances and what happened?. Tried to take me to the grave. Thought you meant it when you said it. But your sorries had a gain. What's the meaning of your love when it only brings me pain?. It's a cold game, the way you play is insane. Ice in your veins and I swear, you don't feel a thang. And I swear, you don't feel a thang. It's a cold, cold world. It's a cold, cold world. Baby, it's cold. How could you treat me so cold?. It's a cold, cold world (baby, you know). It's a cold, cold world (baby, you know). Baby, it's cold. How could you treat me so cold?. I don't get how you can stand there. And lie straight to my face. Can't help but think that I'm the reason. Why we got to this place. Like who we were and all the good things all somehow got erased. Now I'm in love w a stranger - who looks at me w hate. Can't seem to give up or give in - I'm trying to let go. But it's hard to breakaway from the only thing that you know. I kept living in the past - lost on memory lane. Until I finally realized, that things will never be the same. It's a cold game, the way you play is insane. Ice in your veins and I swear, you don't feel a thang. And I swear, you don't feel a thang. It's a cold, cold world. It's a cold, cold world. Baby, it's cold. How could you treat me so cold?. It's a cold, cold world (baby, you know). It's a cold, cold world (baby, you know). Baby, it's cold. How could you treat me so cold?. I gave you love, I gave you trust - I gave you honesty. I gave in even when you owed me apologies. Just to make things right I put aside what was right to me. Then I finally realized that you'll always put it all on me. So listen to your heart beat now. Listen to your heart beat now. It's love & war, but I'm far from your enemy. If love is pain, let me put you out your misery. It's a cold game, the way you play is insane. Ice in your veins and I swear, you don't feel a thang. And I swear, you don't feel a thang. It's a cold, cold world. It's a cold, cold world. Baby, it's cold. How could you treat me so cold?. It's a cold, cold world (baby, you know). It's a cold, cold world (baby, you know). Baby, it's cold. How could you treat me so cold?"
