Now I'm just spinnin' around and around. Yeah. Don't wanna mess with an indigo like that. Hit you with the One-Two-Sick'em. 1-2-3-4 when I hit them. You can come through, get the business. You do not need you a ticket. I just come through and I rip it. Pray to god that you gon' listen. You pray that you get this work, I pray that you can go flip it. Young indigo on a mission. [Verse 3: Tyler Cole]. I don't even know who you are anymore. I don't even know what you want. Cause I left all my feelings in books that they wrote. Lost all my demons in gardens I wanted to. Followed you merca [?] by filling my conscious. A brighter view, on the top of a hillside a sight or two. Top of the bill you a headline, but you turned off your headlights. I saw you, I stopped and I said ""You an indigo. "". Into the woods and the shade where we hidden though. Different from school if you doing geometry. Practice in modesty, look at the prophecy. Hearin' the 808's. You don't wanna mess with me like that, you don't wanna mess with these kids like that. And you know these days it really gets like that, when I think about the past like that.

drowning (feat. mecca kalani),"Do you wanna hear a love story?. Well, once upon a time, there was a guy. All she ever did was pick up the scars that he left. On her heart. And she bleed reliving the sweet words in terrible her. She gave him her heart. And so did he. But when we ripped the cord. Between his heart and hers. She fell to her knees in disbelief. And she was drowning in the middle of his ocean. She loved him, she was drowning. He drowned her in her sorrows. But he's scared to love another. But he drowned her. And he's staring at her body in the river of eternal love. Blue eyes, red lips, pale skin. He loved her (he loved her). Standing in the middle of the street. Yes, he left her (yes, he left her). As she cry out so desperately. And he dropped her. As she fell into his trap. She could never let go of that. But he caught her (yes, he caught her). And as soon as she got up he pushed her away. And she was drowning in the middle of his ocean. She loved him, she was drowning. He drowned her in her sorrows. But he's scared to love another. But he drowned her. And he's staring at her body in the river of eternal love. I dropped a tear in the ocean. And the day that you find it I'll stop loving you (loving you). His eyes stung me with truth. But his words fed me with lies. And by that time she was drowning. In the middle of his ocean. She loved him, she was drowning. He drowned her in her sorrows. But he's scared to love another. But he drowned her. And he's staring at her body in the river of eternal love"

Now I'm just spinnin' around and around. Yeah. Don't wanna mess with an indigo like that. Hit you with the One-Two-Sick'em. 1-2-3-4 when I hit them. You can come through, get the business. You do not need you a ticket. I just come through and I rip it. Pray to god that you gon' listen. You pray that you get this work, I pray that you can go flip it. Young indigo on a mission. [Verse 3: Tyler Cole]. I don't even know who you are anymore. I don't even know what you want. Cause I left all my feelings in books that they wrote. Lost all my demons in gardens I wanted to. Followed you merca [?] by filling my conscious. A brighter view, on the top of a hillside a sight or two. Top of the bill you a headline, but you turned off your headlights. I saw you, I stopped and I said ""You an indigo. "". Into the woods and the shade where we hidden though. Different from school if you doing geometry. Practice in modesty, look at the prophecy. Hearin' the 808's. You don't wanna mess with me like that, you don't wanna mess with these kids like that. And you know these days it really gets like that, when I think about the past like that.

[Verse 3: Tyler Cole]. I don't even know who you are anymore. I don't even know what you want. Cause I left all my feelings in books that they wrote. Lost all my demons in gardens I wanted to. Followed you merca [?] by filling my conscious. A brighter view, on the top of a hillside a sight or two. Top of the bill you a headline, but you turned off your headlights. I saw you, I stopped and I said ""You an indigo. "". Into the woods and the shade where we hidden though. Different from school if you doing geometry. Practice in modesty, look at the prophecy. Hearin' the 808's. You don't wanna mess with me like that, you don't wanna mess with these kids like that. And you know these days it really gets like that, when I think about the past like that.

romance,"Romance doesn't exist. It's a hoax to trick your mind. into thinking perfection exists. Or absence of suffering. Stop leading girls to the clouds above. It's so distracting.

Feasting on mountains that stretch very high. With the sky is the color of bruises and cuts. Oozing and bleeding all over the Sun. Slowly, your hand caressing my thigh. Slowly, your eyes connecting with mine. OOh ahh ohh. Lays me gingerly on my back. The foliage consumes me. I'll never make it back to this moment. To this moment, to this moment. To this moment. I want to know you like I know myself. But it would be just as confusing and hell. I'm imagining a different history. Where man and women stay equal. In the eyes of society. Where we don't condemn different people. For exercising their freedom. Where sex stays sacred. And an act of divine love. And not perverted into violence and lust. Where we still honor our mother. In all of her burgeoning light. Where we do not kill our brothers. Or rape our sisters. Or enslave any life"

You don't wanna mess with an indigo like that. Gettin all up in my face like-like that. Got my spheres, my spheres going light years going light years, taking me into interdmentional space. And I'm like ""What G? "" (G stands for Genius) , like what G? Taking all these pictures. [Hook: Crystal Mec]. You don't wanna mess with an indigo like that. You don't wanna mess with an indigo like that. [Verse 2: Tru]. Yeah. Who let these kids out?. Runnin' round town, that's word of mouth. Indigo now. Purple is all on my cloud, purple is all on my brow. Third Eye is creepin'. Who in the crowd?. I'm on the mic. Tear it out loud [?]. I was just falling for you an your mercabens [?]. Now I'm just spinnin' around and around. Yeah. Don't wanna mess with an indigo like that. Hit you with the One-Two-Sick'em. 1-2-3-4 when I hit them. You can come through, get the business. You do not need you a ticket. I just come through and I rip it. Pray to god that you gon' listen. You pray that you get this work, I pray that you can go flip it. Young indigo on a mission. [Verse 3: Tyler Cole]. I don't even know who you are anymore. I don't even know what you want. Cause I left all my feelings in books that they wrote. Lost all my demons in gardens I wanted to. Followed you merca [?] by filling my conscious. A brighter view, on the top of a hillside a sight or two. Top of the bill you a headline, but you turned off your headlights. I saw you, I stopped and I said ""You an indigo. "". Into the woods and the shade where we hidden though. Different from school if you doing geometry. Practice in modesty, look at the prophecy. Hearin' the 808's. You don't wanna mess with me like that, you don't wanna mess with these kids like that. And you know these days it really gets like that, when I think about the past like that.

woods,"Haha haa hahaha. by myself, in the woods. just the sound of the distant water. and Eryka Badu. just a scent. just the word. the vibrations you sending baby. they're not good. just a scent. ooh - just the smell. ooh - just the feeling. ooh - I can't help it and now. creativity. in my veins. the multiplicity, it speaks to me. in my brain. ooh... ooh... o-ooh... mmh!. alone!. in the woods. nothing else but the sound of water. and Eryka Badu. just a taste!. mmh! just a taste. ooh - just the peak of the higher state of being. (hahahaha...)"
your love v2,"I love you. More than you could ever know. I love you. Even when the snow is falling. Hmm... but how did you know. You swept my heart, said those words. You frail me exactly the way. I needed to feel good. (Your love, your love, your love, your love, your love). You're touching my face. You're into cries and. You're hearing my heart. You're risking your life. This love is deep?. I can see in the sky. 'Cause we're going togheter and. We are going so high. Too bad we don't ever see each other, too bad. My emotions change like the weather and I'm sad. I just wished that I have got on board the plastic moral. That I never had. They're gone now, they're gone now, they're gone now. La la la la la la. La la la la la la. La la la la la. La la la lala. La la la la. La la la. La la. La"
