i talk about you go,"I talk about you go. I talk about go now. I talk about you stay in my life, my life. I talk about go down, down, down. I talk about your love. Why is his love my all?. I talk about you stay in my life, my life. I talk about go down, down, down. Because your beautiful and liar words. They are my doom, but too my luck. Why I believe in the letter by letter. Of your false love words?. My Darling, your love is not true. Now in the game is my rule. And tomorrow I know, oh babe, I know. I talk about you go"
spell,"You'll like me until to die. You'll cry for me until to dry. You'll love me for all your life. Your life, yo-yo-your life. Cause babe, my heart is not a mess. I was a crazy, when I fell in love with you. But honey, I promise by myself. I'll became a witch. I'll remember your name. I'll throw you a spell. I'll win in your game. Boy look to my eyes. You can not run. Now, in your mind. I'm a superman"
