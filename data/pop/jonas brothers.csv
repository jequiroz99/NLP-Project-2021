I can't take a day without you here. You're the light that makes my darkness disappear. When you look me in the eyes. And tell me that you love me. Everything's alright. When you're right here by my side. When you look me in the eyes. I catch a glimpse of heaven. I find my paradise. When you look me in the eyes. Moving on, I start to realize. I can reach my tomorrow.

what i go to school for,Her voice is echoed in my mind. I count the days 'til she is mine. Can't tell my friends 'cause they will laugh. I love a girl from senior class. I day dream through my freshman math. While she fills her college apps. I'll show her a world where we belong. But she'll have to drive us to the prom. (Chorus). That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. You can call me crazy. She is so amazing. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. Girlfriends I've had plenty. She's the one that I need. That's what I go to school for. That's what I go to school for. Her boyfriend's just turning nineteen. But that doesn't bother me. He's back at college out of town. I find a reason to go round. I climb a tree outside her home. To make sure that she is alone. She looks up and sees me there. Still I cant help her but stop and stare. (Chorus). That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. You can call me crazy. She is so amazing. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. Girlfriends I've had plenty. She's the one that I need. That's what I go to school for. That's what I go to school for. Everyone that you see all day knows. you're looking at me in a different way. I guess that's why my marks are getting so high. I can see those tell tale signs. telling me that I was on your mind. I could see that you want it more. When you told me that. I'm what you go to school for. I'm what you go to school for. She's made her choice. And I'm the one. At least until graduation comes. We drive past school to wave goodbye. My friends they can't believe their eyes. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. You can call me crazy. She is so amazing. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. Girlfriends I've had plenty. But she's the one that I need. That's what I go to school for. That's what I go to school for

6 minutes,"She's the kind of girl that you see in the movies. Seen her in my dreams and now she's standing next to me. Down by the shore first weekend of the summer. Gotta take a chance and just ask for her number. I wish I had a song on MTV. Cause in crowded room I'd be the only one she sees. She's looking bored and now I'm running out of time. I've only got six minutes if I'm gonna make her mine. One minute and the earth begins to shake. Two minutes and my heart begins to break. Another minute and she makes me feel brand new. That's just three minutes with you. Four minutes and she's everything I see. Five minutes and she's where I wanna be. Another minute everything just feels so new. I need six minutes with you. Six minutes. She's looking at her watch while the dj is spinning. This could be the end or it's just the beginning. She's the kinda girl that I wanna know better. Reaching for her keys so I guess it's now or never. I wish that I was on the radio. I'd sing her favorite song she'd be front row at. every show. This parties lame and now I'm running out of time. I've only got six minutes if I'm gonna make her mine. One minute and the earth begins to shake. Two minutes and my heart begins to break. Another minute and she makes me feel brand new. That's just three minutes with you. Four minutes and she's everything I see. Five minutes and she's where I wanna be. Another minute everything just feels so new. I need six minutes with you. Six minutes. Sometimes I feel like the catcher in the rye. Sometimes I wish that I could catch her eye. Sometimes I wish that I could be that guy. Yeah time is passing by. I'm losing my mind. I need. One, two, three, four, five, six minutes with you. One minute and the earth begins to shake. Two minutes and my heart begins to break. Another minute and she makes me feel brand new. That's just three minutes with you. Four minutes and she's everything I see. Five minutes and she's where I wanna be. Another minute everything just feels so new. I need six minutes with you.

7:05,"We had a lot of good times when we were together. And I thought we'd last forever, you and I. Eyeing for so long. I couldn't wait to get your phone call. Dreaming 'bout you makes me feel alright. Tonight you called me on the phone. Said you had to stay at home. Is there something I should know?. I was fine till 7: 05. Till she walked out the door and right out of my life. If you're gone I'll move on. But it only would have taken two seconds to say. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. The night after your phone call. Me and friends were hanging at the mall. I was not believing what I saw. Holding hands with him. And sitting closer then six inches. Hoping she's not gonna kiss him now. How can I call you a friend?. You stood me up in the end. I know that it's over. I was fine till 7: 05. Till she walked out the door and right out of my life. If you're gone I'll move on. But it only would have taken two seconds to say. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. Don't keep telling me that you're sorry now. But let me tell you how much this hurts me too. I was fine till 7: 05. Till she walked out the door and right out of my life. If you're gone I'll move on. But it only would have taken two seconds to say. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. I was fine till 7: 05. Till she walked out the door and right out of my life. If you're gone I'll move on. But it only would have taken two seconds to say. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

before the storm (ft. miley cyrus),"No this isn't what I wanted,. Never thought it'd come this far,. Thinkin' back to where we started. And how we lost all that we are. We were young and times were easy,. But I could see it's not the same. I'm standing here but you don't see me. Give it all for that to change. I don't want to lose her,. Don't want to let her go. Standing out in the rain,. Need to know if it's over,. Cause I will leave you alone.. I'm flooded with all this pain,. Knowing that I'll never hold her,. Like I did before the storm. Before the storm. With every strike of lightning. Comes a memory that lasts. Not a word is left unspoken. As a thunder starts to crash. Maybe I should give up. Standing out in the rain,. Need to know if it's over,. Cause I will leave you alone.. I'm flooded with all this pain,. Knowing that I'll never hold her,. Like I did before the storm. I'm trying to keep the lights from going out. And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart. They always say a heart is not a home. Without the one who gets you through the storm. Standing out in the rain,. Knowing that it's really over. Please don't leave me alone. I'm flooded with all this pain,. Knowing that I'll never hold ya,. Like I did before the storm. Like I did before the storm"

dear god,"Dear God. I hate to be a bother, but I gotta say. This world is getting crazier with every day. I hope You'll hear me out now as I stop and pray. Dear God. People take Your words and try to twist 'em round. I know You can't be happy with what's goin' down. I'm searchin' for some answers, but they can't be found. Can You help me out, dear God. Dear God,. Just the other night I heard somebody say. What's the use believin' in You anyway. I guess it was just heartache talkin' through the pain. It's a cryin' shame. Dear God,. I know You're disappointed in the things we've done. Can't they see the truth that they're all running from. Try to preach You message with a loaded gun. What they thinkin' of, Dear God. Everybody's searching for an easy solution. They can't see beyond, the selfish world they're living in. Your words of love get lost, in all the confusion. But I still believe, someday You're gonna speak to me. Dear God,. I know You've got a million other calls to take. You're dealing with a lot of things that just won't wait. But there is one request that I just gotta make. Dear God. Won't You send a sign down, just to ease my doubt. I'm trying to hear You, but the silence is so loud. I think I see a rainbow from behind the clouds. And I hear You now, dear God."

don't charge me for the crime (feat. common),"This is life in this world. Some things go right. Some things go wrong. This is how the world can be. But we just wanna be free. . The verdict came and it said I was guilty. I looked at the judge ""hey, America built me"". Tried to get rich, but they labeled me filthy. Only God can judge me, touch me, feel me. A friend calls me at nine o-clock. Says get the car it's time to rock. Never heard him speak this way. (Let's go man). Grabbed the keys and hit the road. It's all a flash but who would know. How this story would unfold. Don't charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Don't charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Don't charge me for the crime. Friend gets in the car. With bags filled to the top with loads of cash. Throws his pistol on the dash. Says ""I'm sorry for the crime. That I've involved you in this time. You're the only friend I've got"". So don't charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Don't charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Don't charge me for the crime. Start to freak and scream so loud. Just like the females in the crowd. That's when he gets in my head. (Come on man, you've gotta do this). You can live just like a king. With everything you'd ever need. All the dreams of every man. Don't charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Dont charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Dont charge me for the crime. Sirens sound and my heart was pounding. I look at my man as cops surround him. A team on the scene with no objective. The American dream can be so deceptive. Now I see the flashing light. There goes my future and my life. Now I've gotta do what's right. I stop the car and throw the keys. Out of the window sets me free. I throw the pistol in the back. So I'm out of the car. Say you know me well. I'm not going to jail. I'm not paying your bail. But even when I say. Won't charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Don't charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Don't charge me for the crime"

You can rock and roll. Rock and roll. Strummin'. Drummin'. Slide across from runnin'. The stage is your home if you learn how to own it. Like the greats did. There's no way that you can fake it. You've got to feel the beat before you can move. Even though you're not wearing blue suede shoes. Makin' mistakes. But that won't matter. If you can swagg like 'ol Mick Jagger. If you got a heart and soul. You can rock and roll. You can rock and roll. If you live and you die. For the music inside. If the one four five never gets sold. Then you can rock and roll. Rock and roll. Alright now take it low. Now I need the spotlight to hit me. Right here. As the crowd starts to cheer. I need the fan to blow right through my rock star. hair. Right here. If you can scream like Axl Rose. Or sing like Cristina a show after show. If you've got a heart and soul. You can rock and roll. If you've got a heart and soul. You can rock and roll. You can rock and roll"

what i go to school for,Her voice is echoed in my mind. I count the days 'til she is mine. Can't tell my friends 'cause they will laugh. I love a girl from senior class. I day dream through my freshman math. While she fills her college apps. I'll show her a world where we belong. But she'll have to drive us to the prom. (Chorus). That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. You can call me crazy. She is so amazing. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. Girlfriends I've had plenty. She's the one that I need. That's what I go to school for. That's what I go to school for. Her boyfriend's just turning nineteen. But that doesn't bother me. He's back at college out of town. I find a reason to go round. I climb a tree outside her home. To make sure that she is alone. She looks up and sees me there. Still I cant help her but stop and stare. (Chorus). That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. You can call me crazy. She is so amazing. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. Girlfriends I've had plenty. She's the one that I need. That's what I go to school for. That's what I go to school for. Everyone that you see all day knows. you're looking at me in a different way. I guess that's why my marks are getting so high. I can see those tell tale signs. telling me that I was on your mind. I could see that you want it more. When you told me that. I'm what you go to school for. I'm what you go to school for. She's made her choice. And I'm the one. At least until graduation comes. We drive past school to wave goodbye. My friends they can't believe their eyes. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. You can call me crazy. She is so amazing. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. Girlfriends I've had plenty. But she's the one that I need. That's what I go to school for. That's what I go to school for

what i go to school for,Her voice is echoed in my mind. I count the days 'til she is mine. Can't tell my friends 'cause they will laugh. I love a girl from senior class. I day dream through my freshman math. While she fills her college apps. I'll show her a world where we belong. But she'll have to drive us to the prom. (Chorus). That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. You can call me crazy. She is so amazing. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. Girlfriends I've had plenty. She's the one that I need. That's what I go to school for. That's what I go to school for. Her boyfriend's just turning nineteen. But that doesn't bother me. He's back at college out of town. I find a reason to go round. I climb a tree outside her home. To make sure that she is alone. She looks up and sees me there. Still I cant help her but stop and stare. (Chorus). That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. You can call me crazy. She is so amazing. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. Girlfriends I've had plenty. She's the one that I need. That's what I go to school for. That's what I go to school for. Everyone that you see all day knows. you're looking at me in a different way. I guess that's why my marks are getting so high. I can see those tell tale signs. telling me that I was on your mind. I could see that you want it more. When you told me that. I'm what you go to school for. I'm what you go to school for. She's made her choice. And I'm the one. At least until graduation comes. We drive past school to wave goodbye. My friends they can't believe their eyes. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. You can call me crazy. She is so amazing. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. Girlfriends I've had plenty. But she's the one that I need. That's what I go to school for. That's what I go to school for

6 minutes,"She's the kind of girl that you see in the movies. Seen her in my dreams and now she's standing next to me. Down by the shore first weekend of the summer. Gotta take a chance and just ask for her number. I wish I had a song on MTV. Cause in crowded room I'd be the only one she sees. She's looking bored and now I'm running out of time. I've only got six minutes if I'm gonna make her mine. One minute and the earth begins to shake. Two minutes and my heart begins to break. Another minute and she makes me feel brand new. That's just three minutes with you. Four minutes and she's everything I see. Five minutes and she's where I wanna be. Another minute everything just feels so new. I need six minutes with you. Six minutes. She's looking at her watch while the dj is spinning. This could be the end or it's just the beginning. She's the kinda girl that I wanna know better. Reaching for her keys so I guess it's now or never. I wish that I was on the radio. I'd sing her favorite song she'd be front row at. every show. This parties lame and now I'm running out of time. I've only got six minutes if I'm gonna make her mine. One minute and the earth begins to shake. Two minutes and my heart begins to break. Another minute and she makes me feel brand new. That's just three minutes with you. Four minutes and she's everything I see. Five minutes and she's where I wanna be. Another minute everything just feels so new. I need six minutes with you. Six minutes. Sometimes I feel like the catcher in the rye. Sometimes I wish that I could catch her eye. Sometimes I wish that I could be that guy. Yeah time is passing by. I'm losing my mind. I need. One, two, three, four, five, six minutes with you. One minute and the earth begins to shake. Two minutes and my heart begins to break. Another minute and she makes me feel brand new. That's just three minutes with you. Four minutes and she's everything I see. Five minutes and she's where I wanna be. Another minute everything just feels so new. I need six minutes with you.

7:05,"We had a lot of good times when we were together. And I thought we'd last forever, you and I. Eyeing for so long. I couldn't wait to get your phone call. Dreaming 'bout you makes me feel alright. Tonight you called me on the phone. Said you had to stay at home. Is there something I should know?. I was fine till 7: 05. Till she walked out the door and right out of my life. If you're gone I'll move on. But it only would have taken two seconds to say. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. The night after your phone call. Me and friends were hanging at the mall. I was not believing what I saw. Holding hands with him. And sitting closer then six inches. Hoping she's not gonna kiss him now. How can I call you a friend?. You stood me up in the end. I know that it's over. I was fine till 7: 05. Till she walked out the door and right out of my life. If you're gone I'll move on. But it only would have taken two seconds to say. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. Don't keep telling me that you're sorry now. But let me tell you how much this hurts me too. I was fine till 7: 05. Till she walked out the door and right out of my life. If you're gone I'll move on. But it only would have taken two seconds to say. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. I was fine till 7: 05. Till she walked out the door and right out of my life. If you're gone I'll move on. But it only would have taken two seconds to say. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

before the storm (ft. miley cyrus),"No this isn't what I wanted,. Never thought it'd come this far,. Thinkin' back to where we started. And how we lost all that we are. We were young and times were easy,. But I could see it's not the same. I'm standing here but you don't see me. Give it all for that to change. I don't want to lose her,. Don't want to let her go. Standing out in the rain,. Need to know if it's over,. Cause I will leave you alone.. I'm flooded with all this pain,. Knowing that I'll never hold her,. Like I did before the storm. Before the storm. With every strike of lightning. Comes a memory that lasts. Not a word is left unspoken. As a thunder starts to crash. Maybe I should give up. Standing out in the rain,. Need to know if it's over,. Cause I will leave you alone.. I'm flooded with all this pain,. Knowing that I'll never hold her,. Like I did before the storm. I'm trying to keep the lights from going out. And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart. They always say a heart is not a home. Without the one who gets you through the storm. Standing out in the rain,. Knowing that it's really over. Please don't leave me alone. I'm flooded with all this pain,. Knowing that I'll never hold ya,. Like I did before the storm. Like I did before the storm"

dear god,"Dear God. I hate to be a bother, but I gotta say. This world is getting crazier with every day. I hope You'll hear me out now as I stop and pray. Dear God. People take Your words and try to twist 'em round. I know You can't be happy with what's goin' down. I'm searchin' for some answers, but they can't be found. Can You help me out, dear God. Dear God,. Just the other night I heard somebody say. What's the use believin' in You anyway. I guess it was just heartache talkin' through the pain. It's a cryin' shame. Dear God,. I know You're disappointed in the things we've done. Can't they see the truth that they're all running from. Try to preach You message with a loaded gun. What they thinkin' of, Dear God. Everybody's searching for an easy solution. They can't see beyond, the selfish world they're living in. Your words of love get lost, in all the confusion. But I still believe, someday You're gonna speak to me. Dear God,. I know You've got a million other calls to take. You're dealing with a lot of things that just won't wait. But there is one request that I just gotta make. Dear God. Won't You send a sign down, just to ease my doubt. I'm trying to hear You, but the silence is so loud. I think I see a rainbow from behind the clouds. And I hear You now, dear God."

don't charge me for the crime (feat. common),"This is life in this world. Some things go right. Some things go wrong. This is how the world can be. But we just wanna be free. . The verdict came and it said I was guilty. I looked at the judge ""hey, America built me"". Tried to get rich, but they labeled me filthy. Only God can judge me, touch me, feel me. A friend calls me at nine o-clock. Says get the car it's time to rock. Never heard him speak this way. (Let's go man). Grabbed the keys and hit the road. It's all a flash but who would know. How this story would unfold. Don't charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Don't charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Don't charge me for the crime. Friend gets in the car. With bags filled to the top with loads of cash. Throws his pistol on the dash. Says ""I'm sorry for the crime. That I've involved you in this time. You're the only friend I've got"". So don't charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Don't charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Don't charge me for the crime. Start to freak and scream so loud. Just like the females in the crowd. That's when he gets in my head. (Come on man, you've gotta do this). You can live just like a king. With everything you'd ever need. All the dreams of every man. Don't charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Dont charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Dont charge me for the crime. Sirens sound and my heart was pounding. I look at my man as cops surround him. A team on the scene with no objective. The American dream can be so deceptive. Now I see the flashing light. There goes my future and my life. Now I've gotta do what's right. I stop the car and throw the keys. Out of the window sets me free. I throw the pistol in the back. So I'm out of the car. Say you know me well. I'm not going to jail. I'm not paying your bail. But even when I say. Won't charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Don't charge me for the crime. Wrong place, wrong time. Don't charge me for the crime"

You can rock and roll. Rock and roll. Strummin'. Drummin'. Slide across from runnin'. The stage is your home if you learn how to own it. Like the greats did. There's no way that you can fake it. You've got to feel the beat before you can move. Even though you're not wearing blue suede shoes. Makin' mistakes. But that won't matter. If you can swagg like 'ol Mick Jagger. If you got a heart and soul. You can rock and roll. You can rock and roll. If you live and you die. For the music inside. If the one four five never gets sold. Then you can rock and roll. Rock and roll. Alright now take it low. Now I need the spotlight to hit me. Right here. As the crowd starts to cheer. I need the fan to blow right through my rock star. hair. Right here. If you can scream like Axl Rose. Or sing like Cristina a show after show. If you've got a heart and soul. You can rock and roll. If you've got a heart and soul. You can rock and roll. You can rock and roll"

what i go to school for,Her voice is echoed in my mind. I count the days 'til she is mine. Can't tell my friends 'cause they will laugh. I love a girl from senior class. I day dream through my freshman math. While she fills her college apps. I'll show her a world where we belong. But she'll have to drive us to the prom. (Chorus). That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. You can call me crazy. She is so amazing. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. Girlfriends I've had plenty. She's the one that I need. That's what I go to school for. That's what I go to school for. Her boyfriend's just turning nineteen. But that doesn't bother me. He's back at college out of town. I find a reason to go round. I climb a tree outside her home. To make sure that she is alone. She looks up and sees me there. Still I cant help her but stop and stare. (Chorus). That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. You can call me crazy. She is so amazing. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. Girlfriends I've had plenty. She's the one that I need. That's what I go to school for. That's what I go to school for. Everyone that you see all day knows. you're looking at me in a different way. I guess that's why my marks are getting so high. I can see those tell tale signs. telling me that I was on your mind. I could see that you want it more. When you told me that. I'm what you go to school for. I'm what you go to school for. She's made her choice. And I'm the one. At least until graduation comes. We drive past school to wave goodbye. My friends they can't believe their eyes. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. You can call me crazy. She is so amazing. That's what I go to school for. Even though it is a real bore. Girlfriends I've had plenty. But she's the one that I need. That's what I go to school for. That's what I go to school for
