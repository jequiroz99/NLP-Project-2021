true,"Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. So true. Funny how it seems. Always in time,. But never in line for dreams. Head over heels when toe to toe. This is the sound of my soul. This is the sound. I bought a ticket to the world. But now I've come back again. Why do I find it hard to write the next line?. Oh, I want the truth to be said. Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. I know this much is true. Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. I know this much is true. With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue. Dissolve the nerves that have just begun. Listening to marvin (all night long). This is the sound of my soul. This is the sound. Always slipping from my hands. Sand's a time of its own. Take your seaside arms and write the next line. Oh, I want the truth to be known. Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. I know this much is true. Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. I know this much is true. I bought a ticket to the world. But now I've come back again. Why do I find it hard to write the next line?. Oh, I want the truth to be said. Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. I know this much is true. Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. I know this much is true. This much is true"
only when you leave,"Laying in the after glow,. I only want to learn what you know,. But now you're leaving.... How many hearts must you break?. How many calls must I make?. But now you're leaving.... In this world, all that I choose has come unbearable. But love is in your touch. Ooh, it's killing me so much. Only when you leave. I need to love you. And when the action has all gone. I'm just a little fool enough to need you. Fool enough too long. Only when you leave, you'll leave in danger. Oh, I'll make sure that you pay. So give a little passion to a stranger. And take this soul away. I only want to make things last,. So how could this have gone so fast?. And now you're leaving.... How many times must I learn?. It' s only when you've gone that I burn,. And now you're leaving.... In the end, all that is left has come unbearable. It's hard to change your mind,. So leave it all behind. Only when you leave. I need to love you. And when the action has all gone. I'm just a little fool enough to need you. Fool enough too long. Only when you leave, you'll leave in danger. Oh, I'll make sure that you pay. So give a little passion to a stranger. And take this soul away"
once more,"I don't want to let you down. I just want the chance to turn myself around. I keep searching for the sound. I don't want to do you wrong. I just want to take us back where we belong. We were hot and we were oh so strong. Oh I know we will make it if we try. Reach for the stars and we can touch the sky. Chorus:. Darling, once more, won't you give me one more time. Say these words together. I need you more than ever. Trying once more. One more chance to make it right. Never say never, let's rise up together, take on the world. I don't want to change a thing. I don't want to change this whisper to a scream. Same old song in a different dream. Sorry I stole the show. I can't believe I had your heart and let it go. I always loved you but I didn't know. Oh there's nothing standing in our way. We've got the love but do we want to play. (Chorus). Let's stick around, go round again. Another chance to make amends. (Chorus). Lets rise up together. Take on the world (3x)"
how many lies?,"Once there were times,. Once there were reasons filled with rhymes,. Everything shared, everything told. You keep me so warm,. Protect me from all those mighty storms. And dreams seem so old. So look at us now, just look at us now,. With our hands on our hearts. And lines on our brow. How many lies must we tell?. How many lies must we see?. How many times must we say, it's for the best?. And leave truth as the casualty?. Do you read through the lines,. Or believe the TV and the Times?. Where can we find more ways to see?. You strain on the truth,. And make believe all when you cry wolf,. And the lies you're giving me. So look at us now, just look at us now,. With our hands on our hearts. And lines on our brow. How many lies must we tell?. How many lies must we see?. How many times must we say, it's for the best?. And leave truth as the casualty?. Oh, well the truth is hard,. So when they write the book,. Fiction's what you wanna be. Well, it's your freedom of choice,. But you know that lies, are the cancer of democracy. You've painted your face,. And now you've tainted your words. And now you're ready and armed with love. Well if you're head is steady,. And your soul is ready,. We're going up above. So whatever you wanna be,. Just come on along with me,. If there's truth in our hearts,. Maybe we can break free. How many lies must we tell?. How many lies must we see?. How many times must we say, it's for the best?. And leave truth as the casualty?. How many lies must we tell?. How many lies must we see?. How many times must we say, it's for the best?. And leave truth as the casualty?. How many times must we say,it's for the best?. And leave nothing, yeah. ( please note comments below....in the special notes for error, section )."
through the barricades,"Mother doesn't know where love has gone,. She says it must be youth that keeps us feeling strong.. I see her little face that's turned to ice,. And when she smiles she shows the lines of sacrifice.. And now I know what they're saying as our sun begins to fade,. And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades.. Father made my history,. He fought for what he thought would set us somehow free.. They taught me what to say in school,. I learned it off by heart but now that's torn in two.. And now I know what they're saying in the music of the parade,. And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades.. Born on different sides of life,. But we feel the same and feel all of this strife,. So come to me when I'm asleep. And we'll cross the line and dance upon the streets.. And now I know what they're saying as the drums begin to fade,. And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades.. Oh, turn around and i'll be there,. Well there's a scar right through my heart but I'll bare it again.. Oh, I thought we were the human race. But we were just another borderline case,. And the stars reach down and tell us that there's always one escape.. Oh, I don't know where love has gone,. And in this troubled land desperation keeps us strong.. Friday's child is full of soul,. With nothing left to lose there's everything to go.. And now I know what they're saying,. It's a terrible beauty we've made,. So we make our love on wasteland and through the barricades.. And now I know what they're saying as our hearts go to their graves,. And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades."

I left them here I could have sworn. these are my salad days. slowly being eaten away. just another play for today. oh but I'm proud of you,but I'm proud of you. nothing left to make me feel small. luck has left me standing so tall.

I hope you find a little more time. remember we were partners in crime. it's only two years ago. the man with the suit and the pace. you knew that he was there on the case. now he's in love with you,he's in love with you. my love is like a hard prison wall. but you could leave me standing so tall. (Chorus). gold. always believe in your soul. you've got the power to know. you're indestructible. always believe in,because you are. gold.

Could show you something new about you and your inner song. And all the love and all the love in the world. Won't stop the rain from falling. Waste seeping underground. I want to break it down. Break it down again. So these are my schemes. And these are my plans. Hot tips for the boys. Fresh news from the force. When it's all mixed up. Better break it down. In the world of silence. In the world of sound. "" No sleep for dreaming"" say the architects of life. Big bouncing babies, bread and butter can I have a slice. They make no mention of the beauty of decay. Blue, yellow, pink umbrella save it for a rainy day. And all the love and all the love in the world. Won't stop the rain from falling. Waste seeping underground. I want to break it down. Horsin' around. Pray to power. Play to the crowd with your big hit sound. And they won't simmer won't simmer, won't simmer down. Play to the crowd. Play to the crowd. Play yeah yeah. It's in the way you're always hiding from the light. Fast off to heaven just like Moses on a motorbike. No revolution maybe someone somewhere else. Could show you something new to help you. With the ups and downs. I want to break it down. Break it down again. Break it down again. No more sleepy dreaming. No more building up. It is time to dissolve. Break it down it again. No more sleepy dreaming"

I just crashed into love. crashed into love. and I know that I was hit by surprise. between open eyes. emotions arise. I just crashed into love.
cross the line,"We have no way to see eye to eye. Through all the walls in their mind. These are the pleasures that terrify. So leave them behind. You keep the chains that are in your life.

Raise a flag to a moral crime,. WeæŠ£l light a fire for this,. Make the papers by morning time. And lay in our bliss. So come on darling and share my mind,. There is no need to stay hid. æ…ause all we are now is two of a kind. Can you believe what we did?. And IæŠ£l say it again, oh, and IæŠ£l say it again. That when the power comes between us.

Take this chance and show your might,. All the worldæŠ¯ on the other side,. Cross the line."
empty spaces,Once there were times Love. when we could touch the air between. and out acroos this room. we'd just touch hands life would shine. with electric dreams.. No matter how many miles. nothing hurt long-distance-hearts. and there was always something there. that space could never keep apart. but now I know inside that something is died. when we're apart. all we have are. empty spaces.. It's not like we're building walls. too hard to climb to make us blind. it's just so much numbing space. to hollow out the heart and mind. and I can hear echoes of ghosts of love. we left behind.. I'll always love April. we fell in love and we planted seeds. but now we walk through fallen trees. and leaves are crushed beneath. and I will always live in Autumn. now we're agreed. all we have are. empty spaces.. Ithought this was meant to be. our love had an energy. but only as time evolved. and all of our strength dissolved. and we'll never feel the flame that burned so naked. again.. I walk through Kentish Town. and all the rain rain pouring down. so many people here. but space like this I've never found. and as I get back home and step inside. I realise all I have. All I have are. empty spaces..

gently,"Been watching storms and mountains,. no science for tomorrow. The search of love here to control,. too many words to borrow. Ooh, let her go, let her come home safely. When I write that letter on, gently she comes-a near me. Last man took a chair far behind, riding home as larger. She screams like soul, I know she knows above this logic boy. Ooh, let her go, let her come home safely. When I write that letter on, gently she comes-a near me. I?m sitting out, she would understand. that I?m the storm, she found me. ?Hello, hello, I?m in your arms? Moonlight hurts me slowly. Ooh, let her go, let her come home safely. When I write that letter on, gently she comes-a near me. Ooh, let her go, let her come home safely. When I write that letter on, gently she comes-a near me.

handful of lust,"Your pressed your face against my heart.

Here is her model home. listen to the call of the wild. Heaven is a secret. facts are awful shame. the shadow of a doubtful affair. scripted pleasures made forever. easier said than done together. Act One's the same as you read in the book. could this be the thing that they shout about?. No more in distress, now it's rushed through the door. and you can't believe that the secret's out. scripted pleasures made forever. easier said than done together.. Heaven is a secret. it's a passion. it's a long way over there. far from her arms tonight."

raw,"I've been running round town for a new identiy. I've been dreaming hot dreams of insecurity. I've been chasing my heart through the streets of my mind. I've been clinging to the bed the sweat is turning me blind. well I'm plugged all the holes and sealing all the cracks. I'm like a galvanised nerve I just can't seem to relax. she's got fire on her breath and chilli on her lips. teeth around her neck and she's got Jazz on her hips. there's a flash in my brain like a shot from above. it's a strange idea of love. like a wolf at the door. like a scratch of a claw. she says ""come on baby I want it raw"". a wolf at the door. a scratch of a claw. ""I want it raw"". well I'm driving out of town I'm on the verge of a storm. I'm sucking my St. Christopher and trying to keep calm. a Mambo Mamma on the back of my heels. and this incantation can trap my wheels. there's a heat in my car there's a fog on my screen. I've never felt so scared never dreamt such a dream. there's a man on the corner preaching fire above. it's a strange idea of love. like a wolf at the door. like a scratch of a claw. she says ""come on baby I want it raw!"". a wolf at the door. a scratch of a claw. ""I want it raw!""."
reformation,"Reformation. Bleak and tired Western skies. Silence crashing with quiet lies. Shattered glass reflects elation. Reformation, Reformation.. I saw you running through my dreams. Question held me to the scene. Your face was wet with perspiration. Reformation, Reformation.. Thereâ€™s something wrong. Thereâ€™s something wrong. Man is something that must be overcome. Quick, snap, break, crack, complication. Reformation, Reformation.. I saw you running through my dreams. A sun that burst through a cloudy scene. Shattered glass reflects elation. Reformation, Reformation.. Bleak and tired Western skies. Silence crashing with quiet lies. Shattered glass reflects elation. Reformation, Reformation.."
revenge for love,"Don't i need a saviour. just to bail me out. I'll hold my breath until the water lets me out. and I say. alimony never can pay. hey, hey, hey.

round and round,"I don't have to be so wise. you're just my fantasy. and I will fantasize. something more or less to make this things started. we're the artisans. and we've been crafted. I wanna be your magical mystery. I wanna be your final history. this is the news. nothing's ever been so wild. all that I get to do. is what I give to you. this is all about the circles we've found. and through the ups and downs. it goes round. oh I was just beginning to grow strong. she was only eighteen summers long. we were the news.

she loved like diamond,"She ran the risk from unity. obsession dies alone with tragedy. she loved like diamond. she loved like diamond. and cut so hard. she died. a passion course that leads to pain. an acid taste that laced her soul again. she loved like diamond. she loved like diamond. and cut so hard. she died. Another path,I've run them all. The rain has cleared the stains,no trace at all. she loved like diamond. she loved like diamond. and cut so hard. she died."
snakes and lovers,"I just don't understand it. Well there's something at our door. Now we're fighting together. As dogs of war. When the moon is shining. And you're wrapped around our sins. Then our souls starts a-howling. And the show begins. Over where the city starts. Something comes and slips into its heart. Snakes and lovers. Try to shed our sins. We're undercover. But it's slipped beneath our skins. Snakes and lovers. Holding on in the night. Are you sleeping tight?. In our Garden of Eden. With the poison in disguise. We had grown love together. In paradise. Now Utopia's falling. And the messages are clear. That the evil is crawling. And fear is near. Now temptation comes to try. So I bite the apple of my eye. Snakes and lovers. Try to shed our sins. We're undercover. But it's slipped beneath our skins. Snakes and lovers. Holding on in the night. Are you sleeping tight?. Now you're alone in your room. And all of the walls they are turning. And down on the streets where I walk. The light on my eyes it is burning. So come on and take me, my dear. And bear the fruits of what we know. Then our minds will be clear. And our hearts will not let go. Just one more step. And we will be over. Snakes and lovers. Try to shed our sins. We're undercover. But it's slipped beneath our skins. Snakes and lovers. Holding on in the night. Are you sleeping tight?. Holding on in the night. Are you sleeping tight?. Lyrics from <a href=""http://www.elyrics.net"">eLyrics.net</a>"
swept,"Be careful what you say,. Loose talk could sink this ship. Well the way that I am as weak as a lamb,. See it on my shaky lip. There's more to these actions,. That you could ever know. With the moon and the tide I'm drawn to your side. And moving with the flow. When it's time to choose and it's sink or swim,. I know I'll drown this time. When the cold wind blows and I'm falling in,. Throw the line. Now I'm swept,. And I'm lost within my mind. On a love that makes me blind. And this feeling I just can't forget,. Now I'm swept. On a tide that's in my soul. And this feeling that I have is losing me control. And I hope it doesn't end just yet,. Now I'm swept. Mind over matter,. No matter where this mind will be. There's more to be said, oh, for games in the head. Than anything you'll ever see. There's safety in dreaming,. So wrap me in things that I know. With my head in the sand,. I'm at your command. And moving with the flow. When it's time to choose and it's sink or swim,. I know I'll drown this time. When the cold wind blows and I'm falling in,. Throw the line. Now I'm swept,. And I'm lost within my mind. On a love that makes me blind. And this feeling I just can't forget,. Now I'm swept. On a tide that's in my soul. And this feeling that I have is losing me control. And I hope it doesn't end just yet,. Now I'm swept"
the freeze,Blue sing La Lune. sing Lagoon. the visions are making me stay. the art is pretending it's art. the quetion is where do you pay ?. Unpack my case one more time. I'll cancel my train once again. destiny give a day. erogenous zones win again.
through the barricades,"Mother doesn't know where love has gone,. She says it must be youth that keeps us feeling strong.. I see her little face that's turned to ice,. And when she smiles she shows the lines of sacrifice.. And now I know what they're saying as our sun begins to fade,. And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades.. Father made my history,. He fought for what he thought would set us somehow free.. They taught me what to say in school,. I learned it off by heart but now that's torn in two.. And now I know what they're saying in the music of the parade,. And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades.. Born on different sides of life,. But we feel the same and feel all of this strife,. So come to me when I'm asleep. And we'll cross the line and dance upon the streets.. And now I know what they're saying as the drums begin to fade,. And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades.. Oh, turn around and i'll be there,. Well there's a scar right through my heart but I'll bare it again.. Oh, I thought we were the human race. But we were just another borderline case,. And the stars reach down and tell us that there's always one escape.. Oh, I don't know where love has gone,. And in this troubled land desperation keeps us strong.. Friday's child is full of soul,. With nothing left to lose there's everything to go.. And now I know what they're saying,. It's a terrible beauty we've made,. So we make our love on wasteland and through the barricades.. And now I know what they're saying as our hearts go to their graves,. And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades."
to cut a long story short,Soldier is turning. see him through white light. running from strangers. see you in the valley. war upon war. heat upon heat. To cut a long story short. I lost my mind. Sitting on a park bench. years away from fighting. to cut a long story short. I lost my mind. Standing in the dark. oh I was waiting for man to come. I am beautiful and clean. and so very very young. to be standing in the street. to be taken by someone. Questions questions. give me no answers. that's all they ever give me. questions questions. oh look at the strange boy. he finds it hard existing. to cut a long story short. I lost my mind.
toys,"We are the night,. we'll tempt you and turn you on.. Live in our hearts. and play with your man.. Oh these are your toys. hold them and they'll obey,. from blood into life. thy still become your toys.. This is your game. in heaven in your bedroom,. your chivalrous knight. will save you tonight.. They'll look for reasons again and again. let them go,let them go let them go.. You'll have your reason again and again. for letting them go, for letting them go.. Oh stand by the wall,. wach as they shoot you down,. from blood to stone. they still become your toys.. Your toys, your toys.."
true,"Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. So true. Funny how it seems. Always in time,. But never in line for dreams. Head over heels when toe to toe. This is the sound of my soul. This is the sound. I bought a ticket to the world. But now I've come back again. Why do I find it hard to write the next line?. Oh, I want the truth to be said. Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. I know this much is true. Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. I know this much is true. With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue. Dissolve the nerves that have just begun. Listening to marvin (all night long). This is the sound of my soul. This is the sound. Always slipping from my hands. Sand's a time of its own. Take your seaside arms and write the next line. Oh, I want the truth to be known. Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. I know this much is true. Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. I know this much is true. I bought a ticket to the world. But now I've come back again. Why do I find it hard to write the next line?. Oh, I want the truth to be said. Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. I know this much is true. Ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah. I know this much is true. This much is true"
virgin,"I could tell you a fairytale,. Hold your hand oh so small and frail,. But these lies are to no avail. In these blues. I could give you security,. Protect your eyes from what you see,. But I can't give you a guarantee,. Win or loose. Just trust in my love now baby,. I'll show you what's wrong,. Oh this is all I can give you baby,. So sing this song, sing it, sing it. Oh, we are virgin,. Just as bright as the blinding snow. Oh, we are virgin. And we just don't wanna let go,. We are virgin. Your skin is new and your eyes are wide,. Don't let that evil get inside,. I know it's hard to run and hide,. In these times. So hold your face to the sun today,. I'll take your hand and we'll walk away,. Show them all you don't have to pay. For these crimes. Just trust in my love now baby,. I'll show you what's wrong,. Oh this is all I can give you baby,. So sing this song, sing it, sing it. Oh, we are virgin,. Just as bright as the blinding snow. Oh, we are virgin. And we just don't wanna let go. And so if you go away,. I'll keep the fire burning,. Keep the fire burning all night. All through the wind and the rain. I'll keep the fire burning,. Keep the fire burning. Just trust in my love now baby,. I'll show you what's wrong,. Oh this is all I can give you baby,. So sing this song, sing it, sing it. Oh, we are virgin,. Just as bright as the blinding snow. Oh, we are virgin. And we just don't wanna let go,. We are virgin"
windy town,There's gotta be something more to this life we're given. gotta be peace o' mind and a piece o' living. when the losers have won. and the damage is done. only then will you be saved.. She dancing on thin ice while her mind is skating. he's building on the dust that is suffocating. and a baby that cries. in a city of lies. for a freedom that is craved. and high will you fly tonight. in dreams you can hold this tight. but when will love blow round. when will love blow through Windy Town.. Sunny had a street that she couldn't live in. Sunny had a room that she couldn't breath in. but a heart that could feel. and a hand that could heal. and a passion filled with rage.. I never felt the air with a wind of change. I only felt a storm with a wind and rain. a city so deep. a soul without sleep. and a heart that's filled with pain. and high will you fly tonight. in dreams you can hold this tight. but when will love blow round. when will love blow through Windy Town.. Look out on a million dreams. there's fire in all those schemes. feel the burn of investigation. love will be your inspiration.. Baby lets go again. on me and you it all depends. the power of love is a powerful friend. and I will love you till the end.. and high will you fly tonight. in dreams you can hold this tight. but when will love blow round. when will love blow around. when will love blow through Windy Town.. Baby through Windy Town. when will love blow..
with the pride,"Just leave me with the pride. that I worked for. now they've taken the reason away. just leave me with the pride. that I worked for. today. build on rock, or build on sand,. they're never gonna lend a hand. so nothing grows or nothing stands. I can't take any more. I can't take any more. there's not a lot of space for me. but I've still got my dignity. I've got my price. don't say I'm free. I can't take anymore. I can't take anymore. but I'm hungry. I could eat anything. but I'm hungry. oh, let's dance, oh, let's swing. and all that I hear are the words that she sings. now they've taken it all. now they've taken it all. I'd rather take this cure for life. than make myself a sacrifice. if living is to pay the price. I can't take anymore. I can't take anymore. it takes a while to understand. when your eyes are full of sand. when only time is in your hands. I can't take anymore. I can't take anymore. but I'm hungry. I could eat anything. but I'm hungry. oh, let's dance, oh, let's swing. and all that I hear are the words that she sings. now they've taken it all. now they've taken it all. just leave me with the pride. taht i worked for. now they've taken the reason away. just leave me with the pride. that i worked for. today.."
