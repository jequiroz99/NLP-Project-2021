beautiful morning,"Every day, it's all the same. I try to drink some coffee. My bed calls me back. Lost my keys, God help me please!. I'm still in my pajamas. How can I be so wack?. Got a flat tire, believe me. All over again. I guess the puppy ate my homework. Oh, what a bad time! Please shoot me!. I can't understand. Why does it have to happen to me?. But there's one thing that blows the haze. And brightens up my day. I see wherever you are. A beautiful morning, morning. The sun is smiling for me. I hear a guitar. Playing a song, so happy. This is where we should be. Got a flat tire, believe me. All over again. I guess the puppy ate my homework. Oh, what a bad time! Please shoot me!. I can't understand. Why does it have to happen to me?. But there's one thing that blows the haze. And brightens up my day. I see wherever you are. A beautiful morning, morning. The sun is smiling for me. I hear a guitar. Playing a song, so happy. This is where we should be. Why can't it always be this way?. I ask myself ""What's my mistake? "". I wonder if it sounds too gay. But I see wherever you are. A beautiful morning, morning. The sun is smiling for me. I hear a guitar. Playing a song, so happy. Happy... Happy. I see wherever you are. A beautiful morning, morning. The sun is smiling for me. I hear a guitar. Playing a song, so happy. This is where we should be"
better of alone,"What are you thinking of when you hold my hand?. Spare me your promises and your words. they sound so bland. I have made up my mind. I'm leaving all these memories behind. Who am I tell you what is sick or sane?. I don't know what you are. just don't wanna be the same. I'm better off alone. No one but me to hear myself complain. If I sing my song. And no one sings along. I won't let you see me cry. This is my refrain. I won't live in vain. At least it's worth the try. I will raise my voice. Overcome the noise. I'll sing with fortune by my side. Words I know by heart. It's my work of art. Everything and everyone will pass me by. All I have is ""I"". I have been overseas tryin' to find myself. Maybe I'm not from here, I belong to somewhere else. Gotta keep moving on. I can't look back. I'll keep my eyes on track. My road to I-don't-know-where. Has no place to stop. Faces and traces vanish while the wind blows. My fate will lead the way. I'll wait until I see the light of day. If I sing my song. And no one sings along. I won't let you see me cry. This is my refrain. I won't live in vain. At least it's worth the try. I will raise my voice. Overcome the noise. I'll sing with fortune by my side. Words I know by heart. It's my work of art. Everything and everyone will pass me by. All I have is I"
distant,"I wish I were selfish like all the rest. I wish I were the best. I wish I were strong but sometimes I'm so weak. That I barely can stand on my feet. I talk about the things I shouldn't. Regret the things I could or couldn't do. If only I could cut these chains and live. I don't know if I'm wrong, but I'm different. Why does it seem so right?. I feel I don't belong, I'm so distant. I'm sick of believing in lies. Yes, I'm singing my song, but I'm dreaming. What matters just comes through the eyes. For you, for you. I wonder what happens when you shut your eyes. If you can sleep at night. Is that really you or is it just a mask?. Or only just a phase to pass?. Someday you'll run out of excuses. And then you'll wipe that smile off of your face. If only I could just be there to say. I don't know if I'm wrong, but I'm different. Why does it seem so right?. I feel I don't belong, I'm so distant. I'm sick of believing in lies. Yes, I'm singing my song, but I'm dreaming. What matters just comes through the eyes. For you, for you. Why am I the only one who cares?. I'm tired of fighting. Of trying, denying. Believe me, believe me!. I wish I were selfish. Wish I were the best. I wish I were strong. I wish I were like the rest. I wish I were shallow. I wish I were you. To not give a damn' bout the world like a fool"
goodbye,"Beautiful lies won't make magic dreams come true. Deep down inside you're still jaded. Don't fake your smile, find a new road to pursue. Even though now you're defeated. Take your time, not too long. Bid farewell to all your wrongs. Don't get stuck on what makes you feel left behind. Oh, your heart can be deceiving. Trust in your reason, you know, love can be blind. Love bends the truth you believe in. There are times when giving up. Is the only way possible to go. Goodbye is hard to say. Don't close your eyes. There's a brand new life ahead of you. Don't fight, embrace the pain. Don't hold the tears. Undress your fears and learn from it. It's about time you grew up. Painful goodbyes won't suck the life out of you. At the end of the day you're still breathing. Do not despair, well, you know things will be cool. Feel it, your heart is still beating. There are times when giving up. Is the only way possible to go. Goodbye is hard to say. Don't close your eyes. There's a brand new life ahead of you. Don't fight, embrace the pain. Don't hold the tears. Undress your fears and learn from it. It's about time you grew up. Even if you feel regret. Just keep on your way, don't look back. Oh, oh. Even if you feel afraid. Just tie the past to a grenade. In time you'll get to be repaid. Goodbye is hard to say. Don't close your eyes. There's a brand new life ahead of you. Don't fight, embrace the pain. Don't hold the tears. Undress your fears and learn from it. It's about time. Oh, it's about time you grew up"
i miss you,"I hear your voice beneath the sound of rain. A spell that can't be tamed. My heart says I'm not foolish. I sense your presence taking over me. I don't want to be free. You're welcome here, I'm open. But you're not really there. It's just my mind deceiving me. Oh, I miss you. Like a mother misses the son she never met. Like a bad boy misses home. He once left covered in regret. You are always around. Even when I try to keep my head clear. Somehow you're near. But I miss you. I often wake up with your silent scream. An outcry so extreme. That turns my brain into pieces. Maybe you're somewhere calling for me. And no one hears your plea. But my daft imagination. Will you ever come out of my dreams. To say it will be all right?. Will it be all right?. Oh, I miss you. Like a land in drought expecting to be wet. Like a lonely voice that's longing. For a partner to duet. You are always around. Even when I try to keep my head clear. Somehow you're near. But I miss you"
innocent lies,"Once I met a silly boy. Ordinary as could be. But not so ordinary. If you looked more carefully. The kid was smarter than the others. It was not hard to get it. But he's never been his mother's dream. He was too shy to admit it. He never had too many friends. He didn't handle it so well. It was not cool, the kids from school. Just made his life a hell. He felt so different when he was. In his own world of his room. Where he could shine, sing lullabies. Or just fly to the moon. So wrong, he suffered alone. No one could see behind his smiling face. Stuck on this circle of innocent lies. That's where he could hide. He had to hold on. Insisting on his own denials. So he could feel human. He had to move on. Resisting a gazillion miles. So he could be like the others. The boy has grown and he has thrown. His past down the drain. But sometimes he still sheds a tear. When he recalls the pain. But he's not weak, not such a freak. His feet are on the ground. Although he feels his future is lost. Somewhere to be found. So wrong, he bears it alone. Different problems, or maybe just the same. Stuck on his circle of innocent lies. Just trying to hide. He has to hold on. Insisting on his own denials. So he can feel human. He has to move on. Resisting a gazillion miles. So he can be like the others. But he can't fool himself by saying it's Ok. Deep inside he knows he's still afraid. Will anyone hear when he cries for help?. Or will he be forgotten like an old book on the shelf?. Once I met a silly boy. Ordinary as could be. But not so ordinary. If you looked more carefully"

no place too high,"When you think hope is nowhere you can see. Don't let it go, it's an opportunity. To find the strength in who you are. Just wish on a star. Don't be afraid, there's nothing you must fear. Just get a grip, make the love song of the year. The love you cast on yourself. Is something so beautiful. You should never give it up for someone else. The days flow, no matter what you're feeling. The days flow as fast as can be. It feels cold, I know it must be hurting. You said so. You cannot fold!. There's no man on Earth. That has never shed a tear. Everyone, once in a while, wants to disappear. A mistake's not a sin, don't take it on the chin. Even if you don't know where to begin. 'Cause above the clouds the sun always shines the same. But to feel the heat. You gotta face wind and rain. Just aim to the sky, there is no place too high. Ain't nobody that will shut down your light. Don't let it fade away. Just keep that burning flame. And it will lead the way. Out of this waiting game. The days go. Overflow"
shameless,"Why do I have to choose what you expect. If I don't want a war?. Is this a matter of choice at all?. Why do I need to lie if I don't want to close a door?. Ain't I worthy of a curtain call?. People talk too much. I think they need an occupation. Why don't they let me live on my own?. They say it sounds so old. Oh, I gotta smile and be patient. When I'm judged for the one I love. How do you choose the one to love?. Walk side by side. Only we know where we belong. Nothing to hide. Who's to say what is right or wrong?. We gotta be shameless.

sleepwalking,"Don't know if I'm awake. Even the air I breathe is fake. All I've been living for. Is behind an empty door. I scream on an empty street. And run until my feet bleed. There is just no one there. Or just no one seems to care. Oh, will we ever see the light?. It's like we're blindfolded. Oh, is this really humankind?. This is not kind at all. I feel just like we're sleepwalking, sleepwalking. Waiting for the end of days. I'm sick of all the cheap talking, cheap talking. Going around me. Gotta learn how to pray. Before it's late. Numbers without a face. Things are so outta place. We don't even have a name. There is no one to blame. Oh, will we ever see the light?. It's like we're blindfolded. Oh, is this really humankind?. This is not kind at all. I feel just like we're sleepwalking, sleepwalking. Waiting for the end of days. I'm sick of all the cheap talking, cheap talking. Going around me. Gotta learn how to pray. Before it's late. Gotta get to know what you despise. Then maybe you will find inside. A real reason to fight for. Gotta run against the time. Don't let it pass you by. It flies.

someone else's body,"We share the same bruises. We have the same hollow. We've been through the joy and the pain. We're always together. We stand for each other. But, you know, there's hot blood in my veins. We watch the same movies. We like the same color. We always read each other's minds. We both love to sleep late. We hate to go clubbing. We are perfect partners in crime. Do you know how I feel at all?. I think I don't stand a chance. But I want somehow to break through this wall. Even in the maddest circumstance. I wish I could be. In someone else's body. So I could really touch you. Not as a friend but like a man. I wish I could be. Lying right beside you. So I could tell you with my eyes. What's going through my head. I wish I could be. Don't wanna keep waiting. Don't wanna keep watching. My fate slipping out of my hands. Well, maybe it's too late. To dare to cross the line now. I'm swimming to die in the sand.

this far,"I hate all the words I remember from you. And I know you must feel this way too. Well I lost control, I admit it. But I've been through the fire. Just say it's true. You put me to the test when I needed you most. I gave you all my best, I just wanted you close. I can't show a smile, but I'll keep my eyes dry. Tell me why you are so afraid to try. Anyone would say I'm foolish. And that I shouldn't be sad. But I doubt anyone had what we had. Your sweetness has left a bad after-taste in my mouth. If it was just pretending, you can take a bow. Now I curse every moment we spent. Talking 'bout how our life would be. Just you and me. Oh, I wish I could take back the time. And the light you took from my star.

your choice,"Good or bad is something that cannot be taught. You have a voice inside that tells you what is right or not. You say things can't get any worse. So you don't care. But you won't miss a finger 'till the day it's not there. Why don't you face the truth?. You don't need to escape from reality. All you need is water and food.

yours truly,"Mother, mother. You don't know who I am. I spent my life trying to be a better man. Mother, mother. It didn't go as I planned. There comes a time when you cease to pretend. There was a price I had to pay. I could not stay. Mother, Mother. I knew that day would come. Maybe deep inside I was just playing numb. Mother, Mother. I'm standing on my own. But there's no place that I can call a home. It's the price I got to pay. I'm so afraid. I have to face the world alone. Where the souls are cold as stone. I must say, you were probably wrong. When you said it would make me strong. Yes, you were wrong. Mother, mother. This is not wonderland. I never thought my life would get so out of hand. Mother, mother. Maybe you don't care what I am. You loved me more than I can understand. People don't love like you do. They're not like you. I have to face the world alone. Where the souls are cold as stone. I must say, you were probably wrong. When you said it would make me strong. Yes, you were wrong. I know you wish you could only turn back time. But life is not a story that we can rewrite. And that's the way it is. There is no goodnight kiss. Or lullaby. I have to face the world alone. Where the souls are cold as stone. I must say, you were probably wrong. When you said it would make me strong. Yes, you were wrong"
