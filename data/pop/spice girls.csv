greatest love of all,"(The song that Melanie B sang to audition for the Spice Girls. Originally performed by Whitney Houston.). I believe that children are our future. Teach them well and let them lead the way. Show them all the beauty they possess inside. Give them a sense of pride to make it easier. Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be. Everybody searching for a hero. People need someone to look up to. I never found anyone to fulfill my needs. A lonely place to be. So I learned to depend on me. I decided long ago. Never to walk in anyone's shadows. If I fail, if I succeed. At least I will live as I believe. No matter what they take from me. They can't take away my dignity. (Chorus). Because the greatest love of all. Is happening to me. I found the greatest love of all. Inside of me. The greatest love of all. Is easy to achieve. Learning to love yourself. It is the greatest love of all. I believe the children are our future. Teach them well and let them lead the way. Show them all the beauty they possess inside. Give them a sense of pride to make it easier. Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be. And I decided long ago. Never to walk in anyone's shadows. If I fail, if I succeed. At least I will live as I believe. No matter what they take from me. They can't take away my dignity. (Chorus). Because the greatest love of all. Is happening to me. I found the greatest love of all. Inside of me. The greatest love of all. Is easy to achieve. Learning to love yourself. It is the greatest love of all. And if by chance, that special place. That you've been dreaming of. Leads you to a lonely place. Find your strength in love."

christmas wrapping,"""Bah! Humbug"" - no, that's too strong. Cos it's my favorite holiday. But all this year's been a busy blur. Don't think I have the energy. To add to my already mad rush. Just because it is the season. The perfect gift for me would be. Completions and connections left from. Last year, world tour. Aeroplanes and babies. Met some guys but never the time. Most of '98 passed along those lines. So deck the halls and trim those trees. Raise up the cups of Christmas cheer. I just need to catch my breath. Christmas with my mates this year. Calendar picture, frozen landscape. Chilled this room for twenty-four days. Evergreens, sparkling snow. Get this winter over with!. Flashback to springtime, saw him again. Would've been good to go for lunch. Couldn't agree we were both free. We tried, we said we'd keep in touch. We didn't, of course, 'till the summertime. Out to the beach to his boat, could I join him?. No, this time it was me. Sunburn in the third degree. Now the calendar's just one page. And, of course, I am excited. Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind. Not to do too much about it. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year. Hardly dashing through the snow. Cos I bundled up too tight. Last minute have-to-do's. A few cards, a few calls. Because it's R-S-V-P. No thanks, no party lights. It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax. Turned down all of my invites. Last fall I had a night to myself. Same guy called, halloween party. Waited all night for him to show. This time his car wouldn't go. Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late. Trudge on home to celebrate. In a quiet way, unwind. Doing Christmas right this time. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year. Tesco has provided me. With the world's smallest turkey. Already in the oven, nice and hot. Oh damn, guess what I forgot?. So it's on with the boots, back out in the snow. To the only all-night garage. But when to my wondering eyes should appear. In the line that guy I've been chasing all year. ""Spending this one alone,"" he said. ""Need a break; this year's been crazy."". I said, ""Me too, but why are you?. You mean you forgot the papers too?"". Then suddenly we laughed and laughed. Caught on to what was happening. Christmas magic's brought this tale. To a very happy e-ending. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year. [Repeat to Fade]"

do you think about me,"Do you, do you think about me?. Do you, do you think about me?. I see the setting sun, of another passing day. There's some questions on my mind, since you been away. Friend's say that you're doing well, you finally got it made. Outside I share my joy for you, but inside my heart still aches. It's like a melody, playing endlessly. You're always on my mind. And I wonder all the time. (Chorus). Do you think about me? like I think about you. Do you sometimes stay awake at night?. Till the morning light? cos you don't know what to do. Do you think about me? like I think about you. Do you toss and turn does your heart still burn?. For the passion we once knew. Do you think about me?. Do you think about me?. I see your face at night, in every dream I drift. Could this be a message, please tell me what it means. If I had your number, I'd call you on the phone. But your voice wouldn't be enough, I'd be better left alone. It's like I press rewind, it's like the hands of time. That starts all over again. Maybe this time, it won't end. (Repeat Chorus). I wanna know-whoa, do you think about me?. Is there a chance? that we could work it on out. It's been so long a centure and it's plain to see. That I got what you want, and I sure got what you need.

Do you think about me like I think about you?. (Do you, (do you), think about me). (Whoa, oh now baby, eh hey, eh hey). Do you think about me?. (Tossing and turning, my heart is burning).

greatest love of all,"(The song that Melanie B sang to audition for the Spice Girls. Originally performed by Whitney Houston.). I believe that children are our future. Teach them well and let them lead the way. Show them all the beauty they possess inside. Give them a sense of pride to make it easier. Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be. Everybody searching for a hero. People need someone to look up to. I never found anyone to fulfill my needs. A lonely place to be. So I learned to depend on me. I decided long ago. Never to walk in anyone's shadows. If I fail, if I succeed. At least I will live as I believe. No matter what they take from me. They can't take away my dignity. (Chorus). Because the greatest love of all. Is happening to me. I found the greatest love of all. Inside of me. The greatest love of all. Is easy to achieve. Learning to love yourself. It is the greatest love of all. I believe the children are our future. Teach them well and let them lead the way. Show them all the beauty they possess inside. Give them a sense of pride to make it easier. Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be. And I decided long ago. Never to walk in anyone's shadows. If I fail, if I succeed. At least I will live as I believe. No matter what they take from me. They can't take away my dignity. (Chorus). Because the greatest love of all. Is happening to me. I found the greatest love of all. Inside of me. The greatest love of all. Is easy to achieve. Learning to love yourself. It is the greatest love of all. And if by chance, that special place. That you've been dreaming of. Leads you to a lonely place. Find your strength in love."

where did our love go?,"Originally performed by Diana Ross & The Supremes. (Emma's solo on the Spiceworld Tour). Baby, baby, baby. Baby don't leave me. Ooh, please don't leave me. All by myself. I've got this yearning, burning. Yearning feelin' inside me. Ooh, deep inside me. And it hurts so bad. You came into my heart. Baby, Baby. So tenderly. With a burning love. That stings like a bee. Now that I surrender. So helplessly. You now wanna leave me. Ooh, you wanna leave me. Ooh, baby, baby. Baby baby baby. Where did our love go?. Ooh, don't you want me. Don't you want me no more. Ooh, baby baby. Baby baby baby. Where did our love go. Ooh, don't you want me. Don't you want me no more. Ooh, baby baby. Baby. ."
