guts over fear,"Feels like a close, it's coming to. Fuck am I gonna do?. It's too late to start over. This is the only thing I, thing I know. Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is. Find different ways to word the same old song. Ever since I came along. From the day the song called ""Hi! My Name Is"" dropped. Started thinking my name was fault. Cause anytime things went wrong. I was the one who they would blame it on. The media made me the equivalent. Of a modern-day Genghis Kahn. Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg. Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls. Had to change my style. They said I'm way too soft. And I sound like Az and Nas, out came the claws. And the fangs been out since then. But up until the instant that I went against it. It was ingrained in me. That I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought. No wonder I had to unlearn everything. That my brain was taught. Do I really belong in this game? I pondered. I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?. So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on. And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect. The artform I was raised upon. But sometimes you gotta take a loss. And have people rub it in your face before. You get made pissed off. And keep pluggin' it's your only outlet. And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it. Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah. Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times. How many times can I say the same thing. Different ways that rhyme?. What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else. That can relate to my story?. Bet you feel the same way I felt. When I was in the same place you are. When I was afraid to. [Sia]. Afraid to make a single sound. Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out. Afraid I'd never be found. I don't wanna go another round. An angry man's power will shut you up. Trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love. Run out of excuses for everyone. So here I am and I will not run. Guts over fear, the time is near. Guts over fear, I shed a tear. For all the times I let you push me round. And let you keep me down, now I've got. Guts over fear, guts over fear. [Eminem]. Feels like a close, it's coming to. Fuck am I gonna do?. It's too late to start over. This is the only thing I, thing I know. It's like I was there once, single parents. Hate your appearance. Did you struggle to find your place in this world?. And the pain spawns all the anger on. But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs. Learned who to aim it on. That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit. Learned how to harness it. While the reins were off. And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part. Was soon as I stopped saying ""I gave a fuck"". Haters started to appreciate my art. And it just breaks my heart. To look at all the pain I've caused. But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?. The lights go out in the trailer park. And the window that was closing. And there's nowhere else I can go with flows in. And I'm frozen. Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from. Just a bunch of playful songs. That I made for fun. So to the break of dawn here. I go recycling the same old song. But I'd rather make"" Not Afraid 2"". Than another mothafuckin' ""We Made You"" uh. Now I don't wanna seem indulgent. When I discuss my lows and my highs. My demise and my uprise, pray to God. I just opened enough eyes later on. Gave you the supplies and the tools. To hopefully use it to make you strong. Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt. Cause I can't explain to y'all. How dang exhausted my legs felt. Just having to balance my damn self. Those dang eggshells, I was made to walk. But thank you, ma, cause that gave me the strength. To cause Shady-mania. So when they empty that stadium. At least I made it out of that house. And a found a place in this world when the day was done. So this is for every kid who all's they ever did. Was dreamt that one day they would just get accepted. I represent him or her, anyone similar. You are the reason I made this song. Everything you're scared to say. Don't be afraid to say no more. From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk. Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off. The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you. When I'm gone. And to think I was. [Sia]. Afraid to make a single sound. Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out. Afraid I'd never be found. I don't wanna go another round. An angry man's power will shut you up. Trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love. Run out of excuses for everyone. So here I am and I will not run. Guts over fear, the time is near. Guts over fear, I shed a tear. For all the times I let you push me round. And let you keep me down, now I've got. Guts over fear, guts over fear"

moon,"I watch you spin from afar. I drink you in and breath you out. I'm camouflaged by the timeline. I'm camouflaged when the sun shines. Two ships passing in the night. Two lips pressing ground the tides. I believe the world it spins for you. We will never be, I am the moon. I believe the world it spins for you. We will never be, I am the moon. I long to be apart. I isolate my heart. You've drawn me into your world. Now I too spin limbless. One wide hand clapping where's the wind. I stand spanning at your distant wings. I believe the world it spins for you. We will never be, I am the moon. I believe the world it spins for you. We will never be, I am the moon. I believe the world it spins for you. We will never be, I am the moon"

I want to take a swim in lake moon. Now I am awake always. Since I dove into your blue. She came from the moon ready to fight. With scales and a tail and a fishy bite. Ready to destroy all of humankind. Fierce and fighting with a brook trout mind. He was born in an airship above the earth. Strong in legend, my soul's in mirth. Son of a mime and a performer. With just a smile for a sweet. They were never meant to meet (put faith in listen). They were never meant to be (oh it never does). They were never meant to see (oh but fate didn't listen). They were never (didn't listen). She's a fish and he's a boy. Moonquake moonquake. I want to take a swim in lake moon. Now I am awake always. Since I dove into your blue. Moonquake moonquake. I want to catch you in my net. Now I am awake always. Like the day when I found it. And then one solstice at a fishing hole. He was unsure casting his bowl. She swam right up to him and took the bait. He reeled her in and made it a date. When your worlds are worn, you look inside. Fight the power, stop the divide. Four eyes, two gills, one human nose. Wrap your eyes around me in the river floes. Moonquake moonquake. I want to take a swim in lake moon. Now I am awake always. Since I dove into your blue. Moonquake moonquake. I want to catch you in my net. Now I am awake always. Like a day when I found it. Moonquake. Moonquake. Moonquake. Moonquake. Moonquake. Moonquake. Moonquake. Moonquake. Moonquake"

satisfied (feat. miguel & queen latifah),"[Intro: Sia]. A toast to the groom!. (to the groom, to the groom, to the groom). To the bride!. (to the bride, to the bride, to the bride). From your sister. (Angelica, Angelica, Angelica). Who is always by your side. (by your side, by your side). To your union and the hope that you provide. (you provide, you provide). May you always (always). Be satisfied (Rewind). Rewind!. Rewind!. I remember that night, I just might. I remember that night, I just might. I remember that night, I remember that-. I remember that night, I just might. Regret that night for the rest of my days. I remember those soldier boys. Tripping over themselves to win our praise. I remember that dreamlike candlelight. Like a dream that you can't quite place. But Alexander, I'll never forget the first. Time I saw your face. I have never been the same. Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame. And when you said ""Hi,"". I forgot my dang name. Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame. This is not a game.... [Interlude: Miguel & Sia]. You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied. I'm sure I don't know what you mean, you forget yourself. You're like me, I've never been satisfied. Is that right?. I have never been satisfied. My name's Angelica Schuyler. Alexander Hamilton. Where's your fam'ly from?. Unimportant, there's a million things I haven't done. Just you wait, just you wait.... [Queen Latifah]. So so so-. So this is what it feels like to match wits. With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It's. The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light. It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?. The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes. Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's. A dream and it's a bit of a dance. A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a bit of a flirt, but I'm 'a give him a chance. I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?. His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance. He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants. [Bridge: Queen Latifah]. Handsome, boy, does he know it!. Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!. I wanna take him far away from this place. Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is. [Sia]. Helpless. And I know she is. Helpless. And her eyes are just. Helpless. And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time. I'm a girl in a world in which. My only job is to marry rich. My father has no sons so I'm the one. Who has to social climb for one. Cause I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in. New York City is insidious. And Alexander is penniless. Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less. (doesn't mean I want him any less). (doesn't mean I want him any less). (doesn't mean I want him any less). He's after me 'cause I'm a Schuyler sister. That elevates his status, I'd. Have to be naïve to set that aside. Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza. Now that's his bride. Nice going, Angelica, he was right. You will never be satisfied. (I will never be satisfied). (I will never be satisfied). I know my sister like I know my own mind. You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind. If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned. He'd be mine. She would say, ""I'm fine"". But she'd be lying. But when I fantasize at night. It's Alexander's eyes. As I romanticize what might have been. If I hadn't sized him up so quickly. At least my dear Eliza's his wife. At least I keep his eyes in my life.... [Outro: Sia]. To the groom!. (to the groom, to the groom, to the groom). To the bride!. (to the bride, to the bride, to the bride). From your sister.
