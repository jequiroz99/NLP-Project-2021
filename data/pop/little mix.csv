woman like me (feat. nicki minaj),"I always say what I'm feeling. I was born without a zip on my mouth. Sometimes I don't even mean it. It takes a little while to figure me out. I like my coffee with two sugars in it. High heels and my jewellery dripping. Drink and I get all fired up, hey, hey, hey. Insecure but I'm working with it. Many things that I could get rid of. Ain't about to give it up. I made a few mistakes I regret it nightly. I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve. My momma always said, “girl you're trouble” and. And now I wonder. Could you fall for a woman like me. And every time we touch boy you make me feel weak. I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet. Spending every night under covers and. Still I wonder. Could you fall for a woman like me. Woman like me, like a woman like me, la la la. Woman like me, like a woman like me, la la la. Woman like me, like a woman like me, la la la.

Baddies to my left and to the right a little scarier. Rude boy tell me can you handle all this derriere?. A million I'm getting my billy on. Greatest of all time cus I'm a chameleon.

good enough,I am the diamond you left in the dust. I am the future you lost in the past. Seems like I never compared. Wouldn't notice if I disappear. You stole the love that I saved for myself. And I watched you give it to somebody else. But these scars no longer I hide. I found the light you shut inside. Couldn't love me if you tried?. Am I still not good enough?. Am I still not worth that much?. I'm sorry for the way my life turned out. Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now. Guess I'm still not good enough. Does it burn?. Knowing I used all the pain. Does it hurt?. Knowing you fuel to my flame. Don't look back. Don't need your regrets. Thank God you left my love behind. Couldn't change me if you tried?. Am I still not good enough?. Am I still not worth that much?. I'm sorry for the way my life turned out. Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now. Guess I'm still not good enough. Release your curse. 'Cause I know my worth. Those wounds you made are gone. You ain't seen nothing yet. Your love worth it. And I never win. You want the best. So sorry that's clearly not me. This is all I can be. Am I still not good enough?. Am I still not worth that much?. I'm sorry for the way my life turned out. Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now. Guess I'm still not good enough
