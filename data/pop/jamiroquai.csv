virtual insanity,"Oh yeah, what we're living in (let me tell ya). It's a wonder man can eat at all. When things are big that should be small. Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us. And I'm giving all my love to this world. Only to be told. I can't see. I can't breathe. No more will we be. And nothing's going to change the way we live. Cos' we can always take but never give. And now that things are changing for the worse. See, it's a crazy world we're living in. And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin. Is all we have to give these -. [Chorus]. Futures made of virtual insanity. now Always seem to, be. govern'd by this love we have. For useless, twisting, our new. technology Oh, now there is no. sound - for we all live underground. And I'm thinking what a mess we're in. Hard to know where to begin. If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made. And now every mother, can choose the colour. Of her child. That's not natures way. Well that's what they said yesterday. There's nothing left to do but pray. I think it's time I found a new religion. Waoh - it's so insane. To synthesize another strain. There's something in these. Futures that we have to be told. [Chorus]. Now there is no sound. If we all live underground. And now it's virtual insanity. Forget your virtual reality. Oh, there's nothing so bad,. I know yeah. Instrumental break. [Chorus]. Of this virtual insanity, we're livin' in,. Has got to change, yeah. Things, will never be the same,. And I can't go on. While we're livin' in oh,. oh virtual insanity. Oh, this world, has got to change. Cos I just, I just can't keep. going on, it was virtual,. Virtual insanity that we're livin' in,. that we're livin' in. That virtual insanity is what it is. [Chorus]. Living - Virtual Insanity. Living - Virtual Insanity. Living - Virtual Insanity. Living - Virtual Insanity. Virtual insanity is what we're living in"

To trigger that their fate is surely sealed. I wonder if that black crow sleeps as day beckons the night. Or if he even sleeps at all. I wonder what he thinks of all the human traffic passing far below. That's sturggled on the road for so, so long. Tell me black crow, black crow silently you pass above.

The wind it whispers and the clouds don't seem to care. And I know inside, that it's all mine. It's the chorus of the breakin' dawn. The mist that comes before the sun is born. To a hazy afternoon in May. Nature's got me high and it's so beautiful. I'm with this deep eternal universe from death until rebirth. You know that this corner of the earth is like me in many ways. I can sit for hours here and watch the emerald feathers play. On the face of it I'm blessed. When the sunlight comes for free. I know this corner of the earth it smiles at me.

half the man,yesterday i was half the man i used to be. maybe that's because you're the other half of me. like the spring in bloom. the summer of our love is soon. every bird will sing. the melody of our love tune. sent down from above. unconditionally love. likened to a flower. stronger love grows by the hour. stormy weather days. make us go our separate ways. where our love was so at ease. now you got me down on my knees. yesterday i was. brighter than the morning sun. now my love is lost. and lonely days have just begun. a solitary chair. for a silent love affair. a king has lost his throne. and now he sits alone.
hang it over,"Uh huh yeah yeah x4. Future might be fuzzy but it's bright x4. Uh huh yeah yeah x3. Here come the sole survivor. A face down mud covered in the rye. Swigging the gin with your pig faced grin. There's a stagger in your stride. Twenty to five and he's still alive. Chedder head rubber with a glassy eyes. He's looking ooh so vacant. Ten green bottles clean. Black jack helps him hit the sack. Then the last drop hits the sink. Mister nasty, mister nice. Straight no chaser don't ask him twice. CHORUS:. Every night I get to Hang It Over with you. And I love it baby. Every night I get to drink away all my blues. And it feels so good. We're gonna Hang It Over (Hang It Over). And it's just too good for you to say goodnight. And when you Hang It Over (Hang It Over). Future might be fuzzy but it's bright. There'll be no sweet surrender. So try this one for size. Bling bling thrills it's a strange business. Popping up a downtown die. Music ignites a rotten F cigar. The band don't play until he hits the bar. That liquid tranquilizer. Has gone straight to his head. Drip drip drip and he's on the rocks. With the sidewalk for a back. Had big ideas on big eyed checks. But the profit ain't loaded till you hear the click. REPEAT CHORUS. Future might be fuzzy but it's bright x4. Uh huh yeah yeah x2. REPEAT CHORUS. By: VCTR's"

high times,"High Times. You don’t need your name in bright lights. You’re a rock star. And some tin foil with a glass pipe. Is your guitar now yes it is. Little Angela suffers delusions.

She’s a wild thing, letting it all swing. God bless our high times. Don’t you know that last night. Turned to daylight. And a minute became a day. Last night all my troubles.

Now high times go on and on and on. High times rock your mind yeah. This twisted crystal kingdom. Where you live your nine lives. And your head spins. With purple cyclones made of dexadrine. And when the phone rings. You think bad things. Well these are high times yeah. In any back street when you take a hot seat. Make sure you check your flight times. . Don’t you know that last night. Turned to daylight. And a minute became a day. Last night all my troubles. Well they seemed so far away. Searching my reflection for a glimpse of another me.

And a moment half a world away. Time can be so precious. When you throw your life away. I can’t help living it up. Letting it all go wrong. I can’t keep living this way. Knowing my life has gone. Kids wanna give it up. Kids wanna give it up. Time to let your mind be free. Searching for eternity."

if i like it i do it,"Written by Jay Kay and Nick Van Gelder. Say that we have all the time we need to make it right. Don't hurry for nobody if it ain't the thing you like. Know your place and fit your space, young man you will conform. I didn't hear my soul express those rules when I was born. Cause I'm free to roam cause it's my home. You can't stop sweet inclination. The kids want the system braking down. Not higher education. If it ain't no natural law. Then you can keep your regulations. Cause if I like it I do it!. But I keep on movin' though they wanna bring me down. I've gotta run for the cover, and keep on smiling. Though they wanna tie me down and give me death for the lover,. And I keep on losing though I'm proving what I'm doing. I'm still grooving, and if I like it I do it!. You've got to help those people break that legislation,. We can overcome this suffocation,. Execute your natural liberation,. Happy to enjoy rejuvenation. All around hear the sound. No one can stop us now,. A thousand rules for plastic fools!. Now they can take a bow,. Surely there's been time to see it doesn't work by now,. So if I like it, I do it!. Still I, keep on finding that they're pushing those distorted visions,. And I keep on living but I'm dying cause of their decisions,. If I keep on looking I can find a higher space. I'm still grooving and if I like it, I do it!."
journey to arnhemland (instrumental),"Written by Jay Kay, Wallis Buchanan and Toby Smith. Personnaly I like a lot this song. They get to fusion the didgeridoo vibes with the song very smoothly, so this is a cool tune where you don't feel the didgeridoo like an uncomfortable sound behind there. And when you listen to it you can imagine yourself travelling, travelling in a Journey to Arnhemland. Two thumbs up.."
just another story,Written by Jay Kay and Toby Smith. Nobody make a move. This kid's got you covered. He was just seventeen. Trying to get on like his dead brother. Mama couldn't make anything for him. Though she hurt inside. And daddy wants his son back. While he knows he's still alive. Stick up kid. Thinking you're a glory boy. Fronting that stupid toy. But you don't get that it's yourself you will destroy. Like a speed king freak of amphetamine. Still running that rock on the frontline. Get up tight when it's your turn. A bullet in the head is a leason learned. One of this days you're gonna say goodbye. Tellin' everyone you've never been so high. Born the same time that you die. Pushin' that draw like you're superfly. Heaven help all with no way out. That's what this is all about. This is not another trilogy. It's just another story.
king for a day,"There's no way. I'm coming back to you. I've just got to say. That everything we did is through. You tried to undermine. The better ranges of my nature. But soon you're going to find. You should have started talking straighter. Now don't you worry. I won't put you down. I'm in no hurry, baby. To see you go to ground. Because it's true what they say. You know it's true what they say. You're only king for a day. I guess you're happy that way. Well there's no hope. For peace and reconciliation. You're quick to play your hand. But what you haven't learnt is patience. So look before you leap. To tell the world your coloured story. It's clear your talk is cheap. You'd do anything to get your glory. So spread your wings and fly. There is no doubt. You're so sorry inside you've got something to shout about. Because it's true what they say. You know it's true what they say. You're only king for a day. I guess you're happy that way. And there's no love. Ever to be lost between us. I guess this is because. The damage that you've done is so grievous. So I hang my head. To dwell on what might have been. But what you left instead. Is pieces of a broken dream. Now don't you worry. I won't put you down. I'm in no hurry, baby. To see you go to ground. Because it's true what they say. You know it's true what they say. You're only king for a day. I guess you're happy that way. So spread your wings and fly. There is no doubt. You're so sorry inside you've. Got something to, something to shout about. Because it's true what they say. You know it's true what they say. You're only king for a day. I guess you're happy that way. Don't you see that you're only king for a day. You must believe that.."

Light years away from the colour of our brotherhood. Light years away from our duty to assistance.

I'm breaking out, I'm breaking out. I'm flying higher than a pig in space. And they've been so blind, they've been so blind. I was born in '69. And I'm telling the world. But they don't wanna know about me. No no no. I wanted just to do my thing. I wanted just to make my life. Have that swing and Ooo feel so good. But all they wanna do is mess with my mind."
manifest destiny,"Written by Jay Kay and Toby Smith. As I remember. It was four hundred years or more. Since you came to crucify. They were taken far away from home. There were promises of paradise. But if they had been told that day. That day were been so this way. To satisfy the souls of chosen man. See I had to look carefully. At the shame of my ancestry. To redefine the storyline again. If I was taken for a day. And shown another way. Now every child can learn a different thing. See I tried a million times. But I had to change my mind. Sadness was the best thing I could bring. On the inside he was dead and this is what he said. As he took away the blue above the clouds. Oh, superiority was clearly meant to be. So destiny will manifest in time. So where has the all love gone?. A troubled trail of tears will tell the tale. Of the how I was put down where I don't belong. Woman, child and man for sale. For ethical slavery is just an absurdity. How can you be alive when you are dead?. With these chains of hipocrisy. The shame of my ancestry. Forever strained in blood in which you tread"
morning glory,"Written by Jay Kay and Stuart Zender. All of my visions were untrue. Till I had a vision of you. And untimely end for all. But it was only then, only then that I saw. Saw the morning glory.. Can't you take me there. Can't you take me there. Away from solloquies of sadness. And prophecies of pain for us all to see. I had a vision in my mind. I had a vision of peace. I had a vision of you."

picture of my life,"I never had a dream that I could follow through. Only tears left to stain, dry my eyes once again. I don't know who I am, or what I'm gonna do. Been so long I've been hopelessly confused. This can never really end, its infinitely sad. Can someone tell me when. Something good became so bad. So if you have a cure. To me would you please send. A picture of my life. With a letter telling how. it should really be instead. The precipice is there. But will I ever dare. Throw myself in the sky, so at last I can die. See I've become a man. Who holds nothing too dear. Who will mind if I just disappear. This can never really end, it's infinitely sad. Can someone tell me when. Something good became so bad. So if you have a cure. To me would you please send. A picture of my life. With a letter telling how. it should really be instead."

scam,"Written by Jay Kay, Stuart Zender and Toby Smith. You say you fight to give us freedom. But often more than not this is abused. And the faces of a tired generation. Have decided they are sick of being used. For the purpose of current declarations. Still the same, it will never change until the end. Is to buy the appreciation of the nation. To cover the mistakes you must defend. And you say there will be a chance for eveyone. To protest against your calculated greed. But I can see into the future. Won't be long before the welfare. Send me letters telling me how much they need. And it's not been in my interest to please them. For the only interest rate to fall is mine. See a brand new generation is demanding. What you've been doing with our money all this time. Scam, people try to live at the speed of light. Scam, don't know why but I've got to do the things I do. Scam, give me ten, that's the move I give you five. Scam, people say it's the way to stay alive. So you see you have to be a schemer. If you wanna love the life you have to live. And I don't matter how much I earn. Cos I always get my fingers burned. When the man gets down to his business. And I've been searching for a reason. Why I have to give it all up just I want to get ahead. See I had to lose car, job, wife, dog and home. Debts and threats on the phone. Maybe I should bust a move instead. Now we all know when we watch television. Not confused between a puppet or conviction. Glued to the screen by a thousand shallow words of wisdom. It ain't what it seems when it's a single sided system. Someone's got to hold on my living. So I'm gonna have to do the thing that's fair. They got to justify for what I should be giving. Should I lie, should I steal or should I care."

When you don’t call my name. And if I had, what we had. For me life wouldn’t seem so bad. I keep staring every day at this empty. Picture frame. What I want and what you give yeh, ooh. They’re just two completely different. Things, two completely different. Things again. I don’t remember when the mystery. Was gone. But I know that now, now. Now… I’m only half as strong. Without you baby. I think I still love you baby. And I know that I’m hard to understand. But you’ll always be part of my plan. I think I, I think I, I think I think I think. I still love you baby"

"whatever it is, i just can't stop","Written by Jay Kay and Toby Smith. If I pick it up I can put it down,. Whatever it is I just can't stop,. For only 20 seconds at a time it's all mine.. I got, too much, pressure,. Got me under it's thumb. And it's no fun, you can lose. Now I got a choice but I can't choose. Insistent as you are, is no guarantee that you'll go far. Rock steady if you can. But I've never been a steady man,. People, wanna shoot you down,. If you can't swim then you will drown. In sorrow, can't get any medical attention till tomorow,. Sadlands, are where I live,. But that's none of your business,. You keep asking, and soon enough. The kids gonna have to get rough,. Maybe I'm a speed king. Push with the foot and I'm smiling,. I can glide on the love inside,. And there was you thinking that my hands were tied. All along I saw you hoping. I would slip and I'm not joking. The evidence in these events. Is still your lack of commonsense. Did you really think that I would sink. Because I like another drink. Have to get up to get down. The remedy is the sound. Absurdity of your suggestion, leaves me asking just one question,. If you're my friend today?. Why do you wanna hear me say?. If I pick it up, can I put it down?."
when you gonna learn?,"Have you heard the news today?. People right across the world are pledging they will play the game. Victims of a modern world, circumstance has brought us here,. Armaggedon's come too near, too too near yeah. Now foresight is the only key to save our children's destiny. The consequences are so grave the hipocrites we are their slaves. So my friend to stop the end on each other we depend,. Mountain high and river deep, stop it going on,. We gotta wake this world up from its sleep,. People, stop it going on. Have you heard the news today?. Money's on the menu in my favorite restaurant,. Now don't talk about quantity, cos there's no fish left in the sea.. Greedy men been killing all the life there ever was,. So you better play it nature's way or she will take it all away,. And don't try tell me you know more than her about right or wrong,. Now you've upset the balance man, done the only thing you can,. Now my life is in your hands. Mountain high and river deep, stop it going on,. We gotta wake this world up from its sleep,. Oh people, stop it going on. Ahahahaha, hehehehehe.... Mountain high and river deep, stop it going on,. We gotta wake this world up from its sleep,. People, stop it going on. Greedy men will fade away, oh they will fade away when we stop it going on,. I know it's got to be that way, oh people stop it going on!. I'm asking, when you gonna learn to stop it going on?"

I hope you got the sensory between your eyes. You know that all the ... says that. Babe you never seem to find the time. Come on, I've waited for your phone calls. But you must be uptown having fun.

So honey, swipe me off the list,. if your love comes with a twist. cos I want to think it lingered on your lips when we first kissed. oh, do you truly love me?. If you do, tell me something, better make it two. Do you love me?. I need to know. Now Baby can't you tell me where we're gonna go... oh. where do we go from here?.

world that he wants,"Why does this man. Defy the storm and burns us all. Each time his head waves. The sun, it sets on lonely graves. Haven't we read this page before. We're gonna lose the war. What kind of God is that. Nothing will be the same. This is the world he wants. Prayed for the brave and the young. And won't bring them back again. Sadness, you know that it reins supreme. And suffocates our only dream. Lovebirds sing here, they've flown away. They didn't even say, when they would be back again. Will they come back again. Unleash the hounds of hell. Weather be fury wind. Hidden inside his storm. This is the world he wants. Prayed for the brave and the young. He knows that they're not coming home. Now, do you ever get the feeling, get the feeling. This is the world that he wants. You ever get the feeling, ever get the feeling. This is the world that he wants (3x)"
you give me something,"When I met you, you were so unique. You had a little thing I'd love to keep. Every movement carried much mystique. I knew right then I'd carry on, to you I knew my heart belongs. You know you, you give me something. Something that nobody else can give. And my heart, started thumpin'. You know now, you're the one I truly know I dig. Like the sunbeams from a perfect summer day. Heaven only seems a step away. When I'm with you, I just celebrate. I'm hoping my message gets through. There's never been someone like you. I had nobody, but on you I lean. 'Cus you got these little things that I. I know I've never seen. You know now you, you give me something. Something that nobody else has got. And this love, that I've been wanting. Oh baby's turning out to be too fast to stop. You know now ooh, you give me something. Something that nobody else can give. See my heart has started thumpin'. You know babe, you're the one I truly know I dig. ooh... Will you give me something. ooh... Will you give me something. ooh... Will you give me something. ooh...

your are my love,"Oh, let me tell you a little story about a heartbreaker.. Honey, I don't know why you treat me so bad,. Well I tried so hard to make you see it my way,. Just think of all the good times we had.. But still you only ever want to fight with me.. We got to split apart before we kill. And start to put our minds together. We got to change this hell for leather world. And I will find myself another girl.. We got to put our weapons down.. And spread a little love around.. You know. You are my love. You are my love. Oh, yes you are. You are my love. You are my love. Ain't you the girl who did me wrong behind my back. And tried to keep me double booked. We never seem to cross the tracks. And there's so much that you over-looked about me girl,. Remember, sat down pretty on the windowsill,. And made me swallow on your bitter pill,. You thought the grass was greener over there,. While serpents snaked around your hair,. So pour a vitriolic coffee cup. And use your blackened heart to fill it up,. Well, now honey we got to put our weapons down. And spread a little love around.. You know. You are my love. You are my love. Oh, yes you are. You are my love. Yes you are. You are my love. You are my love. I want you girl. I need you so. Now we know that. It's no secret. You are my love. You are my world. Light my shwdows. Fill the heavens with stars. You are my love. You are my love. You are my lover. I need you. I want you. Don't let me go. I need you so.
