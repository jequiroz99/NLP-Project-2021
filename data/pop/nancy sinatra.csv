bang bang,"I was five and he was six. We rode on horses made of sticks. He wore black and I wore white. He would always win the fight. Bang bang, he shot me down. Bang bang, I hit the ground. Bang bang, that awful sound. Bang bang, my baby shot me down. Seasons came and changed the time. When I grew up I called him mine. He would always laugh and say. ""Remember when we used to play"". ""Bang bang, I shot you down"". ""Bang bang, you hit the ground"". ""Bang bang, that awful sound"". ""Bang bang, I used to shoot you down"". Music played and people sang. Just for me the church bells rang. Now he's gone I don't know why. Until this day, sometimes I cry. He didn't even say goodbye. He didn't take the time to lie. Bang bang, he shot me down. Bang bang, I hit the ground. Bang bang, that awful sound. Bang bang, my baby shot me down. Baby shot me down..."

something stupid,I know I stand in line until you think. You have the time to spend an evening with me. And if we go someplace to dance. I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me. And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place. And have a drink or two....... And then I go and spoil it all by saying. Something stupid like I love you. I can see it in your eyes that you despise. The same old lines you heard the night before....... And though it's just a lie to you for me it's true....... And never seemed so right before. I practice every day to find some clever lines. To say to make the meaning come true....... But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late. And I'm alone with you. The time is right your perfume fills my head....... The stars get red and oh the night's so blue....... And then I go and spoil it all by saying. Something stupid like I love you

Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time. And I will give to you...summer wine. Mm...summer wine. When I woke up, the sun was shining in my eyes. My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size. She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime. And left me craving for...more summer wine. Oh..oh..summer wine. Strawberries, cherries and an angel kissing spring. My summer wine is really made from all these things. Take off those silver spurs, help me pass the time. And I will give to you my summer wine.

Hanging on your words. Cherish every one. Can't bring you back no matter what I say. Driving in my car just to drive away. Hear the tires spin. Round and round again.

And how far are you drifted out there, out there in the dark. Wind at my window. Rattling my doors. Pounding on my heart. Like it's never done before. Still I wonder if it could be these memories.
