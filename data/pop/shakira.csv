poem to a horse,You're too far to bring you close. And too high to see below. Just hangin' on your daily dose. I know you never needed anyone. But the rolling papers for your grass. How can you give what you don't have. You keep on aiming for the top. And quit before you sweat a drop. Feed your empty brain. With your hydroponic pot. Start out playing with yourself. You get more fun within your shell. Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way. I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain. But you're so in love with yourself. If I say my heart is sore. Sounds like a cheap metaphor. So I won't repeat it no more. I rather eat my soup with a fork. Or drive a cab in New York. 'Cause to talk to you is harder work. So what's the point of wasting all my words. If it's just the same or even worse. Than reading poems to a horse. You keep on aiming for the top. And quit before you sweat a drop. Feed your empty brain. With your hydroponic pot. I bet you'll find someone like you. 'Cause there's a foot for every shoe. I wish you luck but I've other things to do. I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain. But you're so in love with yourself. If I say my heart is sore. Sounds like a cheap metaphor. So I won't repeat it no more

ready for the good times,"I don't wanna clear the cobwebs from my head. Time will bring them back I bet. So if you hear me say that I believe in love. Don't make me feel ashamed.

Sitting here watching other people live. Frozen by the fear to fail. Cause, everyday there's a war to fight. And if I win or lose, nevermind. As long as you're my shelter every night. I used to cry against a wall. But now I've got a shoulder that I can lean on. Swear to me you won't be gone. I'm ready for the good times. I'm ready for the good times. Ready to get it on.

"whenever, wherever","Lucky you were born that far away so. So we could both make fun of distance. Lucky that I love a foreign land for. The lucky fact of your existence. Baby I would climb the Andes solely. To count the freckles on your body. Never could imagine there were only. Ten million ways to love somebody. Le do lo le lo le, Le do lo le lo le. Can't you see...I'm at your feet. Whenever, wherever. We're meant to be together. I'll be there and you'll be near. And that's the deal my dear. There over, here under. You'll never have to wonder. We can always play by ear. But that's the deal my dear. Lucky that my lips not only mumble. They spill kisses like a fountain. Lucky that my breasts are small and humble. So you don't confuse them with mountains. Lucky I have strong legs like my mother. To run for cover when I need it. And these two eyes that for no other. The day you leave will cry a river. Le do lo le lo le, Le do lo le lo le. At your feet...I'm at your feet. Whenever, Wherever. We're meant to be together. I'll be there and you'll be near. And that's the deal my dear.

Le do lo le lo le lo le. Tell me one more time. That you'll live. Lost in my eyes. Whenever, wherever. We're meant to be together. I'll be there and you'll be near. And that's the deal my dear. There over, here under. You've got me head over heels. There's nothing left to fear. If you really feel the way I feel. Whenever, wherever. We're meant to be together.

you don't care about me,"I fold your t-shirt. And I stripped your bed. I left you perfect. But there's no appreciation. I listened sweetly to your sour tone. I loved you only. But there's no reciprocation. Before you came along. It was all beautiful. I have nothing left. In my heart, in my soul. Should have never helped. You become so powerful. But I saw a champion in your eyes. You don't care about me. If you did, you would let me go. You will eventually. 'Cause you just don't care about me. You don't care if I die. If you did, you would have spared my life. I say it confidently. But you just don't care about me. You say you're thirsty. So I pour the wine. The bottle's empty. But there's no consummation.

No, don't care about me. No, don't care about me. You don't care about me. Don't care about about me. You don't care about me. If you did, you would let me go. You will eventually.

your embrace,"Tell me, what's the use. Of the twenty-four inch waist. If you don't touch me?. Tell me, what's the use again. Of being on TV every day. If you don't watch me?. This house is full of emptiness. My closet's full of dresses. That I'll never wear. My life is full of people. But you're my only friend. My best friend. Hope it isn't too late. To say “I love you”. Hope it isn't too late to say. That without you this place looks like London. It rains every day. Don't you know it, babe. I'm only half a body. Without your embrace. Let me tell you why. My heart is an unfurnished room. Any suggestions?. Don't have to tell you more than that. 'Cause no one knows me like you do. Without exception. This house is full of emptiness. My closet's full of dresses. That I'll never wear. My life is full of people. But you're my only friend. My best friend. Hope it isn't too late. To say “I love you”. I hope it isn't too late to say.
