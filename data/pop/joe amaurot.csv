bottles of merlot,"This tension in my head. It's something I'm about to say. How it moves me is insane. I know this will never fade away. It makes me feel it. The life I'm dreaming. The dream I'm living. (It makes me). I hear the noises in my mind. Love it forever and I'll never hide. Dark soul, Dark you. 24 7 that's what we do. It makes me feel it. The life I'm dreaming. The dream I'm living. Building a kingdom. Bottles of Merlot. The life that I want. (My art makes me feel alive. I cannot hide, I cannot fight)"
come to my bed.,Remember when we were in my room?. The light was off. There was my youth!. I was scared I must say. But your presence made me feel okay. I need it!. Your love was all to me. But then I told you now that's all you see. Your love was all to me. F*cking me up the only guarantee. Because I remember all the things I've seen with you. Things I did with you. And though we're civilized. Everything is a lie. I need it!. Do you even remember my name?. That summer was everything. Your mind was all I could think (about). Becoming so many things. I can't realize. But now when you come to me. I feel nothing but grief. What I want is not this. But that's my life. I need it!
i.m.y,"Eye to eye. Body to body. I miss this and I don't want you to party. I gave up all my rational parts. Because there's a fight. And I don't know when it dies. This fight made everything change. I miss you babe can you drop the rage?. Life goes on without you in my bed. I gotta live but my tears will last. I can't stay with you and all those drugs. When I'm with you I feel like I suck. It is my fault that you're with me. You're not a gift, you're just another sin. Honestly I'm happy we are done. Sometimes I miss you and sometimes I don't. To feel blue is just an excuse. When you know this feeling is something. That I refuse. (Eye to eye). (Drop the rage)"
the second one,"I thought that writing a song about you. would make me feel better. But no, this is the second one. and now I'm not that clever. . I can't sleep. with the thought of you in my head. When will this be over?. I swear I won't do a thing. until you come to me. Just stay here or set me free. . The feeling of us incomplete. Are you dead? Am I blind? We don't see. Touching you is just like a daydream. See you on a dark night? Maybe. . This is the second one"
