Looked at me so fatigued, I must be her soldier. Hopin she wouldn't tease and get in my Rover. Lil' momma you got to breathe like diamonds supposed ta. Come closer, can I hold ya, just what I need. Like my Gucci loafers, hold the, disappointment - must be sealed inside. Bowlegged woman that's what I need, I don't mind. Like how she flaunt it, see that's my speed, she a dime. Thought for a moment how could this be so fine?. Body bangin, I lay the language, that walk is famous. The proper anus like she was painted. She got me tainted, I gotta brang it, this woman dangerous. None other, who's her lover, this above her. Get it from her mother, did it to her brother. Magazine cover, glad to meet a hustler. Shorty whassup~! She had.... [Chorus]. [Flo Rida:]. Heyyy parking lot pimpin, yeah that's the way I approached her. Hips went up and down like a roller coaster. Miss - got her attention, tapped her on the shoulder. Serious, she the business and I need closure. So hood and I'm startin, I'm blowin see no stuck up trumpin. Bugari I'm good and I smell like the fragrance of money. I'm sorry this lady take over just like a tsunami. She had on the Jacob, I'm rockin my platinum my money. This ain't your normal every day baby. The type to drive nothin less than that 600 Mercedes. It's rare that you find a woman so vicious on the daily. That grant all your wishes with looks to kill like a .380. I feel like she put me under a spell. Pretty ambitious about delicious full attention on the yell.
