father and son,"It's not time to make a change. Just relax, take it easy. You're still young, that's your fault. There's so much you have to know. Find a girl, settle down. If you want, you can marry. Look at me, I am old. But I'm happy. I was once like you are now. And I know that it's not easy. To be calm when you've found. Something going on. But take your time, think a lot. I think of everything you've got. For you will still be here tomorrow. But your dreams may not. How can I try to explain. When I do he turns away again. And it's always been the same. Same old story. From the moment I could talk. I was ordered to listen. Now there's a way and I know. That I have to go away. I know I have to go. It's not time to make a change. Just sit down and take it slowly. You're still young that's your fault. There's so much you have to go through. Find a girl, settle down. If you want, you can marry. Look at me, I am old. But I'm happy. All the times that I've cried. Keeping all the things I knew inside. And it's hard, but it's harder. To ignore it. If they were right I'd agree. But it's them they know, not me. Now there's a way and I know. That I have to go away. I know I have to go"

morning has broken,"Morning has broken, like the first morning. Blackbird has spoken, like the first bird. Praise for the singing, praise for the morning. Praise for the springing fresh from the world. Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from heaven. Like the first dewfall, on the first grass. Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden. Sprung in completeness where his feet pass. Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning. Born of the one light, eden saw play. Praise with elation, praise every morning. God's recreation of the new day."

oh very young,Oh very young. What will you leave us this time. You're only dancing on this earth for a short while. And though your dreams may toss and turn you now.

And the patches make the goodbye harder still. Oh very young. What will you leave us this time. There'll never be a better chance to change your mind. And if you want this world to see a better day. Will you carry the words of love with you. Will you ride the great white bird into heaven. And though you want to last forever. You know you never will. (You know you never will ). And the goodbye makes the journey harder still. Oh very young. What will you leave us this time. You're only dancing on this earth for a short while. Oh very young. What will you leave us this time

18th avenue (kansas city nightmare),"Well I rode a while, for a mile or so. Down the road to the eighteenth avenue. And the people I saw were the people I know. And they all came down to take a view.

I tried to remember what I thought. And what I used to say. ""Don't let me go down"" no don't let me go. Oh my hands were tied as I struggled inside. The empty waste of another day. Memories were blank to my eyes. The fire and the glory of that night. Seemed safely locked away. Too hungry to rise. Too hungry to. Well I rode a while, for a mile or so. Down the road to the eighteenth avenue. And the people I saw were the people I know. And they all came down to take a view. Oh the path was dark and borderless. Down the road to the eighteenth avenue. But my head felt better as I turned the car. And the airport slowly came to view. One mile said the sign. Checked my bags and made it straight to end gate 22."

Upon the earth to praise his name. Chorus. There is no creature among us. Upon the air or in the sea. That does no sing with wonder. Praising in community. Chorus. The dry earth is a sign. To all of mankind. Brought to life with peaceful rain. And to us Allah will do the same. Seal Of The Prophets. He was a guide for all people. And the mercy to the universe. He was a guide for all people. God's peace and blessings on him. He was a seal of the prophet. The last brick in the house of prophethood. He was the last of the prophets. God's peace and blessings on him. He was a patron of the poor. Always helping widows and orphans. A great patron of the poor. God's peace and blessings on him. He was a striver against evil. And he fought and he won. To give rights all people. God's peace and blessings on him. He was a stranger to this world. For his aim was the hereafter. He kept little for this world. God's peace and blessings on him"

It's time to wipe your eyes now, and awake.. You say you're really with me but you only follow me around. How much you love me yes,. But I don't want the kind of love. I have to sit down and count. You think you're free and lucky but you're stuck behind a prison wall. How well you know yourself. But I see something else within you. That you don't see at all. You may give up your number, disowning all your wealth. You may sell all the pieces, but you'll. Never never never give up. Yourself, oh no no no.. Like drywood takes to fire the truth will come to you. Like streams that seek the ocean they will find ways through. Like morning meets the night's stars, my love will guide the way. It's time to wipe your eyes not, and awake. I've come to take you over, there's much for you to do."
dying to live,You know I've heard it said there's beauty in distortion. By some people who've withdrawn to find their heads. Now they say that there is humor in misfortune. You know I wonder if they'll laugh when I am dead. Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?. Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?. Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?. Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?. You know some people say that values are subjective. But they're just speaking words that someone else has said. And so they live and fight and kill with no objective. Sometimes it's hard to tell the living from the dead. Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?. Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?. Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?. Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?. You know I used to weave my words into confusion. And so I hope you'll understand me when I'm through. You know I used to live my life as an illusion. But reality will make my dream come true. So I'll keep fighting to live till there's no reason to fight. And I'll keep trying to see until the end is in sight. You know I'm trying to give so c'mon give me a try. You know I'm dying to live until I'm ready to die
editing floor blues,"I was born in the west-end. In the summer of '48. Above a small cafe. Some people liked to come there and call it night. But for me it was all day. Oh! Now the dogs keep a-growlin'. Round my front door. And the truth howled out from the editing floor. Years went by. Quarrymen came along. This boy became a star. Then he dropped - but got up again. With a black everly guitar. Then he searched along the road. A good song he was looking for. And the truth sang out from the editing floor. Big brother took a trip. As bold as he could be. To the place, he heard. Where the good prophets used to walk. High above this dark world. Then the word came down. And the little brother saw. How the truth was buried on the editing floor. One day the papers rang us up. T'check if I said this?. I said, ""oh boy!. I'd never say that! "". Then we got down to the truth of it. But they never printed that!. Just like socrates, the man from greece. Fell down on his knees. Said, lord! Forgive them please. Forgive them please. And he spoke no more. And the cup spilled out on the editing floor"

god is the light,"God is the Light. How great the wonders of the heavens. And the timeless beauty of the night. How great â€“ then how great the Creator?. And its stars like priceless jewels. Far beyond the reach of kings. Bow down for the shepherd guiding him home.. But how many eyes are closed. To the wonder of this night?. Like pearls, hidden, deep beneath a dark. Stream of desires.. But like dreams vanish with the call to prayer. And the dawn extinguishes night â€“ here too are signs.. God is the Light - God is the Light. How great the beauty of the Earth and the creatures. Who dwell on her.. How great â€“ then how great the Creator?. As itâ€™s mountains pierce the clouds. High about the lives of men. Weeping rivers for thousands of years.. But how many hearts are closed. To the wonders of this sight?. Like birds on a cage, asleep with closed wings. But as work stops with the call to prayer. And the birds recite â€“ here too are signs. God is the Light â€“ God is the Light. How great the works of man and the things he makes. How great â€“ then how great the Creator?. Though he strives to reach the heavens. He can barely survive. The wars of the world he lives in.. Yet, how many times heâ€™s tried,. Himself to immortalise?. Like his parents before him in the Garden of Eden. But like the sun sets with the call to prayer. And surrenders to the night here too are signs. God is the Light Everlasting."

Who, who, who, who?. Who is he, who am I, and. What laid in between?. How can I say goodbye? No one let me in. Can't see no need for Nine no more."

on the road to find out,"Well I left my happy home to see what I could find out. I left my folk and friends with the aim to clear my mind out. Well I hit the rowdy road and many kinds I met there. Many stories told me of the way to get there. So on and on I go, the seconds tick the time out. There's so much left to know, and I'm on the road to find out. Well in the end I'll know, but on the way I wonder. Through descending snow, and through the frost and thunder. Well, I listen to the wind come howl, telling me I have to hurry. I listen to the robin's song saying not to worry. So on and on I go, the seconds tick the time out. There's so much left to know, and I'm on the road to findout. Then I found myself alone, hopin' someone would miss me. Thinking about my home, and the last woman to kiss me, kiss me. But sometimes you have to moan when nothing seems to suit yer. But nevertheless you know you're locked towards the future. So on and on you go, the seconds tick the time out. There's so much left to know, and I'm on the road to findout. Then I found my head one day when I wasn't even trying. And here I have to say, 'cause there is no use in lying, lying. Yes the answer lies within, so why not take a look now?. Kick out the devils sin, pick up, pick up a good book now"
one day at a time,One day at a time. We can learn to leave the past behind. One day at a time. We can look the future in the eye. One day at a time. We can learn to live.

We can stare our hopes in the eye. One day at a time. We can learn to live. And if you meet the evening. Don't wait for the sun to rise. One day at a time. We can leave all treasures behind. One day at a time. We can watch the clocks unwind. One day at a time. A child is born into this world. Eyes blind. One day he will find his sign. And glimpse some other kind of life to live by. One day. One day at a time. We can put machines behind. One day at a time. We can learn how birds survive. One day at a time. We can learn to fly

ruins,"It's so quiet in the ruins walking though the old town. Stones crumbling under my feet I see smoke for miles around. Oh it's enough to make you weep, all that remains of the main street. Up in the park on Sunday, dogs chasing and the children played. Old man with his head down, can't see nothing more around...no. But he remembers how it used to be, back in the old days,. So nice to see you coming back in this town again. It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through having tea. In the afternoon, so nice to see you coming back in this town again.... Ah but it's all changed winter turned on a man. Came down on day when no-one was looking and it. Stole away the land, people running scared, losing hands. Dodging shadows of falling sand, buildings standing like empty shells. And nobody...helping no-one else. Young child with his hands high, ain't able to see no reason why...no. But he remembers how it used to be, back in the old days,. So nice to see you coming back in this town again. It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through. You'd better know what you're going through now. You came back here to find your home is a black horizon. That you don't recognize, evil destruction has taken everything. You'd better walk on the side while you're still walking. Just keep on walking on down the street keep your distance. From the people you meet. Oh Lord and you'd better watch your eyes. 'Cause if smoke gets in them, baby you won't rise again.. Where's it leading to freedom at what cost. People needing more and more and it's all getting lost. I want back, I want back. Back to the time when the earth was green. And there was no high walls and the sea was clean."

She sits in a corner by the door.. There must be more I can tell her.. If she really wants me to help her.. I'll do what I can to show her the way.. And maybe one day I will free her..

But they just go on and on, and it seems that you can't get off.. Oh, I know we've come a long way,. We're changing day to day,. But tell me, where do the children play?. Well you've cracked the sky, scrapers fill the air.. But will you keep on building higher. 'til there's no more room up there?. Will you make us laugh, will you make us cry?. Will you tell us when to live, will you tell us when to die?. I know we've come a long way,. We're changing day to day,. But tell me, where do the children play?"
whispers from a spiritual garden,"The eternal source of love is implanted. In every part of existence -. The desire for another.. Though night and day,. Outwardly appears enemies,. Yet both serve one purpose -. Each seeking the other."
wild world,"Now that I've lost everything to you. You say you wanna start something new. And it's breakin' my heart you're leavin'. Baby, I'm grievin'. But if you wanna leave, take good care. I hope you have a lot of nice things to wear. But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there. Chorus:. Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world. It's hard to get by just upon a smile. Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world. I'll always remember you like a child, girl. You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do. And it's breaking my heart in two. Because I never wanna see you sad, girl. Don't be a bad girl. But if you wanna leave, take good care. I hope you make a lot of nice friends out there. But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware. Chorus. Baby, I love you. But if you wanna leave, take good care. I hope you make a lot of nice friends out there. But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware. Chorus"
world o' darkness,"In this world o' darkness,. Evil rules by night,. But somewhere in the shaaadows, someone seeking light. No one knows his neighbor here,. No one has the time,. No one cares for anyone else,. In a world where the sun don't shine. (Shamsia) (x2). Some sons dream of leaving,. While they're young at heart,. But few choose the path towards the land beyond the dark,. Who choose the path towards the land beyond the daaark"
you are my sunshine,"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey. You never know, oh, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away. The other night, as I lay sleeping. I dreamt a light entered my heart. When I awoke, I was mistaken. Ah, but the curtains were still blown apart. You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey. You never know, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away. My mama once told me. What a soul should know. It's about the devil, and I hate him so. He'll be crying, if we don't frown. And keep on smiling. He'll stop hanging round. You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey. You never know, how much I love you. Oh, please don't take my sunshine away"
you can do (whatever),"You can do whatever you want to do. Anything you want? you can do. You can ride a tiger or walk the dog. Anything you wish can be true. You can watch the world as it passes by. Or you can make it stop for you. You can stay at home or brave a storm. When the blizzard blows. You can dance around in the rain. Or watch from the window. You can lay in bed and do nothing. Or rise and shine. You can take whatever comes around. But please don't take what's mine. You can do whatever you want to do. Anything you want? you can do. You can say whatever you wish to say. But if you do then, please make it true. You can chase a dream in the black of night. Or you can make it walk to you. Ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh. Ooh. You can treat the world like a piece of dust. Or a pot of gold. You can be a child in your heart. Or you can grow old. You can laze around in your jeans. Or put on a suit. You can be the be the boss of the company. Or just join the queue. You can close your eyes to the dark. Or make it bright. You can't stop the wrongs of the world. If you can't make it right. You can hide at home. When the soldiers start to march out. You can listen to what they say. Or you can shout!"
your mother,"Who should you give your love to?. Your respect and your honour to?. Who should you pay good mind to - after Allah,. And Rasullullah?. Comes your Mother,. Who next? Your Mother. Who next? Your Mother. And then you Father. Cause who used to hold you. And clean you and clothe you?. Who used to feed you. And always be with you?. When you were sick, stay up all night. Holding you tight?. That's right no other, your Mother. Who should you take good care of. Giving all your love?. Who should you think the most of - after Allah. And Rasullullah?. Comes your Mother. Who next? Your Mother. Who next? Your Mother. And then you Father. Cause who used to hear you. Before you could talk?. Who used to hold you. Before you could walk?. And when you fell, who'd pick you up?. Clean your cut?. No one but, your Mother, your Mother. Who should you stay right close to?. Listen most to?. Never say no to"
