malibu,"I never came to the beach. Or stood by the ocean. I never sat by the shore. Under the sun with my feet in the sand. But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did. 'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind. I always thought I would sink, so I never swam. I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'. And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand. But here I am, next to you. The sky's more blue in Malibu. Next to you in Malibu. Next to you. We watched the sun go down as we were walking. I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking. You would explain the current, as I try to smile. Hoping I just stay the same. And nothing will change. And it'll be us, just for a while. Do we even exist?. That's when I make the wish. To swim away with the fish. Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?. I never would've believed you. If three years ago you told me. I'd be here writing this song. But here I am, next to you. The sky's more blue in Malibu. Next to you in Malibu. Next to you. Next to you. The sky's so blue in Malibu. Next to you. We are just like the waves that flow back and forth. Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning. And you're there to save me. And I wanna thank you with all of my heart. It's a brand new start.

This is all I'm asking for. I just want to see my baby. Standing right outside my door. Oh I just want you for my own. More than you could ever know. Make my wish come true. Baby all I want for Christmas is.... You

bb talk,"Alright, so this is really fucked up, but. Alright, I was sleeping next to him. But I was dreaming about the other dude. And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did. Just made me cringe and it was so hard to fall in. But so easy just to fall right back out again. This whole time, I could give to you. And I could paint you pictures. But I guess I could just never write a song. And then maybe I'd never fell out of love with him. In the first place. I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling. Cause my energy's just so strong that. I don' t know if I'm creating this. Or this is actually what's mean to be. And you know, they say that you gotta think what you want. Into existence, but you know what?. Haven't been too good at making decisions so. I have no idea what the fuck I want, I guess. You're giving me a feeling in my head. Laying in my bed just thinking. Not really feeling like the one I want. It's everything in me not to call him. I really, really, really want it too. I told all my friends I'm moving on. Your baby talk is creeping me out. Fuck me so you stop baby talking. You know what, in the beginning it was like. We were fucking homies and shit. And then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby. Goo-goo tongue down my fucking throat. I mean, even in front of your mom. Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough. I mean, you put me in these fucking situations. Where I look like a dumbass bitch. And I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch. You know, like, I hate all that fucking Pda. I probably hate it more than your fucking friends do. You know, it's sweet. And you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead. But I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo. You keep saying again and again. We're laying in my bed just talking. And now I, now I can't hold it back. I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit. I don't really wanna let go of you. I heard I change my mind with you often. Baby talk is creeping me out. Fuck me so you stop baby talking. Alright so, I'm gonna be honest. It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here. I mean, I'm fucking what?. Look, I like when you send me, you know, the. The queen emoji, but when I send back the monkey. You know, the ones with the, the hands over the eyes. That means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me. I mean, I don't wanna say it person. I just bury my head in your armpit which. Weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth. Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do. And remember there was that one time. That I had like a 15 minute. Well, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world. You know, maybe I could just get past this shit. And I could get used to someone giving a fuck. I'm sorry I called you a creep. And that thing about the vomit. I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing. But no matter what you do. Homegirl can't handle the fucking goo. Fuck me so you stop baby talking. Fuck me so you stop baby talking. Fuck me so you stop baby talking. Fuck me so you stop baby talking. I don't really wanna? you. I heard I change my mind with you often. Baby talk is creeping me out. Fuck me so you stop baby talking"

bless the broken road - rascall flatts,"I set out on a narrow way. Many years ago. Hoping I would find true love. Along the broken road. But I got lost a time or two. Wiped my brow and kept pushin' through. I couldn't see how every sign. Pointed straight to you. CHORUS. That every long lost dream. Led me to where you are. Others who broke my heart. They were like northern stars. Pointing me on my way. Into your loving arms. This much I know is true. That God blessed the broken road. That led me straight to you. I think about the years I spent. Just passin' through. I'd like to have the time I lost. And give it back to you. But you just smile and take my hand. You've been there, you understand. It's all part of a grander plan. That is comin' true. Chorus. That every long lost dream. Led me to where you are. Others who broke my heart. They were like northern stars. Pointing me on my way. Into your loving arms. This much I know is true. That God blessed the broken road. That led me straight to you. Now I'm just rolling home. Into my lover's arms. This much I know is true. That God blessed the broken road. That led me straight to you. That God blessed the broken road. That led me straight to you"

inspired,"I'm writing down my dreams. All I'd like to see. Starting with the bees, or else they're gonna die. There won't be no trees or air for us to breathe. I'll start feeling mad. But then I feel inspired. Thinking about the days. Coming home with dirty feet. Or playing with my dad all day in the creek. He somehow has a way of knowing what to say. So when I'm feeling sad. He makes me feel inspired. We are meant for more. Get the handle on the door that opens up to change. I know that sounds so strange to think. We are meant for more. Get the handle on the door that opens up to change. I know that sounds so strange. Cuz you've always felt so small. But know you aren't at all. And I hope you feel inspired. Oh, I hope you feel inspired. How can we escape all the fear, all the hate?. Is anyone watching us down here?. Death is life, it's not curse. Reminds us of time and what it's worth. To make the most out of it while we are here. We are meant for more. Get the handle on the door that opens up to change. I know it sounds so strange. Cuz you've always felt so small, to think. We are meant for more. There's a lock upon the door. But we hold the key to change. How can we escape all the fear, all the hate?. Is anyone watching us down here?"

It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe. Go lightly from the ledge, babe. Go lightly on the ground. I'm not the one you want, babe. I will only let you down. You say you're lookin' for someone. Who will promise never to part. Someone to close his eyes for you. Someone to close his heart. Someone who will die for you an' more. But it ain't me, babe. No, no, no, it ain't me, babe. It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe. Go melt back into the night, babe. Everything inside is made of stone. There's nothing in here moving. An' anyway I'm not alone. You say you're looking for someone. Who'll pick you up each time you fall. To gather flowers constantly. An' to come each time you call. A lover for your life an' nothing more. But it ain't me, babe. No, no, no, it ain't me, babe. It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe"

lighter,"When we're driving. you're sayin go faster. And when we're singing to the radio. you're sayin make it louder. And you roll another one. You wanna get higher, and. When I need the fire. You're always my lighter. When we're rolling. You always put your feet on mine, and. And when I'm running late. You always remind me of the time. When I'm feeling low. You lift me to the moon and back. Back into your arms, I won't let go. Until I know how much you really love me, baby. I see a light. And I've heard we never truly see ourselves. You gotta leave it up to someone else. To know how beautiful you really are, baby. We never get to see ourselves. Sleeping peacefully next to the ones that we love. We never see us cry. when someone dies, see us cryin. Someone new was born, baby. When we're driving. You say you can go faster, and. When we're singing to the radio. You say you turn make it louder. And you roll another one. You wanna get higher, and. When I need the fire. You're always my lighter. I see a light coming towards me. Moving slowly, but coming quickly. At the same time, I think it represents. What's going on in my mind, when. We're together, everything is so sweet. there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be. As long as I've got you, and you've got me, baby. I could leave you. I don't need nothing but you. When you're starting out beyond just us two. Forever gets complicated. It don't have to be that way, baby. I see a light coming towards me. Moving slowly, but coming quickly. At the same time, I think it represents. What's going on in my mind"
lilac wine,"I lost myself on a cool damp night. Gave myself in that misty light. Was hypnotized by a strange delight. Under a lilac tree. I made wine from the lilac tree. Put my heart in its recipe. It makes me see what I want to see.... And be who I want to be. When I think more than I ought to think. And do things I never should do. I drink much more than I ought to drink. Because it brings me back you.... Lilac wine is sweet and heady... like my love.... Lilac wine... I feel unsteady... like my love. Listen to me... I cannot see clearly. Isn't that she coming near here?. Lilac wine is sweet and heady... where's my love?. Lilac wine... I feel unready... where's my love?. Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?. Isn't that she, or my mind is going crazy, dear?. Lilac Wine is sweet and heady... Where's my love?. I... I feel unready for my love..."

love someone,"You gotta love someone. I don't know what you've been told. Or what they say about me. I never give up, but give it a rest. I ain't got time to worry about a mess. And I'm kinda getting tired of dealing with all your stress. I'm starting to think you have no heart. You don't even have a soul. You always give in or ya try too late. All I do is give and all you do is take. I'm tired of protecting you from what you need to know. Come on. Ever since the day that I met you. I knew you weren't the one. But nothing ever stops me from forgetting. Packing all my shit and moving on. I'm not sure where I'd even go. Cuz I made your house my home. It's come to an end, I hate how it's been. Lights are getting dim and the walls are caving in. And it's time for this queen to go and find another throne. When I give it up, I give it all. I went and made you my life. Don't you dare say I don't care. When I need you most. You know you're never there. It'd be a cold day in hell. Before I'd ever be your wife, that's right. Ever since the day that I met you. I knew you weren't the one. But nothing ever stops me from forgetting. Packing all my shit and moving on. Kickin' off my shoes and runnin' towards the sun. I said. ""Nothing's really worth it unless you're having fun"". To make somebody stay. You gotta love someone. You gotta love someone. Ever since the day that I met you. I knew you weren't the one. But nothing ever stops me from forgetting. Packing all my shit and moving on. You gotta love someone. You gotta love someone. You gotta love someone. You gotta love someone"
love that lets go,There's a gold frame. That sits by the window. And my heart breaks. A little more each time I try. To picture the memory inside. There's an old book. That's too hard to read. But if you look. You'd see how you look through my eyes. But now one more chapter's gone by. And I know. It's time to move on. Even though I'm not ready. I've got to be strong. Just where you're heading. And even though it's not easy (it's not easy). I know the right kind of love. Is a love that let's go. There's an old dance. That we've done forever. You give me your hand. But let me decide when to reach. You always let me be me. But now it's my time to take chances. And find my own wings. And whatever happens. I know that you'll be there waiting for me. It's time to move on. Even though I'm not ready. I've got to be strong. Just where you're heading. And even though it's not easy (it's not easy). I know the right kind of love. Doesn't wanna miss the future. Staying in the past. It will always hold on. But never hold you back. And even though it's not easy (it's not easy). Right now the right kind of love. Is the love that let's go (this time it's harder). With the love that lets go

lucy in the sky with diamonds,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river. With tangerine trees and marmalade skies. Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly. A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah. Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain. Where rocking horse people. eat marshmallow pies. Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers. That grow so incredibly high. Newspaper taxis appear on the shore. Waiting to take you away. Climb in the back with your head in the clouds. And you're gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile. The girl with kaleidoscope eyes"

malibu,"I never came to the beach. Or stood by the ocean. I never sat by the shore. Under the sun with my feet in the sand. But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did. 'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind. I always thought I would sink, so I never swam. I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'. And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand. But here I am, next to you. The sky's more blue in Malibu. Next to you in Malibu. Next to you. We watched the sun go down as we were walking. I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking. You would explain the current, as I try to smile. Hoping I just stay the same. And nothing will change. And it'll be us, just for a while. Do we even exist?. That's when I make the wish. To swim away with the fish. Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?. I never would've believed you. If three years ago you told me. I'd be here writing this song. But here I am, next to you. The sky's more blue in Malibu. Next to you in Malibu. Next to you. Next to you. The sky's so blue in Malibu. Next to you. We are just like the waves that flow back and forth. Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning. And you're there to save me. And I wanna thank you with all of my heart. It's a brand new start. A dream come true in Malibu"

my heart beats for love,"I've been stranded on a lonely street. Got lost in the shadows, fell hard in the battle. Heard cries and the suffering. Walked through the darkness, left broken and heartless. I'm calling out, can you hear my voice?. I'm gonna find you through all the noise. You know there's nothing that I wouldn't do. Shine your light as I reach for you. My heart beats for love, my heart beats for love. It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up. It breathes in my chest and it runs through my blood. My heart beats for love, my heart beats for love. I've been told at least a thousand times. It's not worth the struggle, the hurt or the trouble. I keep running up to these front lights. No I won't surrender, I'll wait here forever. Standing here with my flag held high. Can't you see that it's worth the fight?. My heart beats for love, my heart beats for love. It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up. It breathes in my chest and it runs through my blood. My heart beats for love, my heart beats for love. I've marched across this battlefield. I'm screaming out, can you hear me now?. I'm holding on, I stand my ground. I'm screaming out, can you hear me now?. My heart beats for love, my heart beats for love. It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up. It breathes in my chest and it runs through my blood. My heart beats for love, my heart beats for love.

my sad christmas song,"Fa lalalala. This is my sad Christmas song. I've had it stuck in my head all day long. I wrote it in the car on my ride home. Cause I knew I'd walk in the door and I'd be alone. Why'd I even put up that fuckin' tree?. If there's no one here that's gonna see. Just how pretty she looks on Christmas Eve. Cause there's no one here next to me. This is my sad Christmas song. So I light another bong. I turn on the radio. I binge watch our favorite shows. This year feels kind of lame. But the last one was the same. But the holiday spirit they say. Is taking off on a plane. This is my sad Christmas song. Fa lalalala. I always thought that Santa was kind of cute. There's something about his beard, big belly, and boots. I left Santa more than cookies this year. I thought he might appreciate a few beers. That's why I'm always on the naughty list. He said cause when I get drunk, I'm always showing my tits. He leaned in for a kiss and he got real near. I had to stop Santa and say ""My true love ain't here"". This is my sad Christmas song. So I rip another bong. I never been good at making plans. Next year, I'm gonna be with my man. My little sister says I'm the Grinch. But my mom thinks I'm just a bitch. Why did you have to go?. We were under the mistletoe. This is my sad Christmas song. Fa lalalala. Fa lalala. Missing you on fuckin' Christmas, why did you have to go?. Wishing you a Merry Christmas, know I miss you so. Missing you on fuckin' Christmas, why did you have to go?. Wishing you a Merry Christmas, know I miss you so. Wishing you a Merry Christmas (Fa lalalala. Fa lalala).

simple song,Wake up here I go. Cram it all down my throat. Stomach so full that I wish I could choke. 7 Am my heads already in a spin. As soon as I'm out that door. Bam it hits me like a ton of those red bricks. Can't dig myself out of this highest ditch. This madness. I swear sometimes I can't tell. Which way is up. Which way is down. It's all up in my face. I need to push it away. Somebody push it away. So all that I can hear. Is a simple song. Sing along now. La la la la la la. La la la la. La la la la la la. La la la la. Mid day sun beating on the concrete. Burning op my feet. Too many cars on the street. The noise. The red. The green. Makes me wanna scream. 5 O clock now. It's bumper on bumper on bumper. Horns honking. Nobodys looking. But everybodys talking. It's another day. On this highway. I swear sometimes I can't tell. Which way is up. Which way is down. It's all up in my face. I need to push it away. Somebody push it away. Cause all I wanna hear. Ohhh. Is a simple song. Ooo. Sing along now. La la la la la la. La la la la. La la la la la la. La la la la. Hey!. Sing along now. Sing along now. What I'd give to turn it off. And make it stop. Make it stop. Gotta make it stop. So all that I can hear. Is a simple song mmm. Sing along now. La la la la la la.

true trans soul rebel (feat. laura jane grace & against me!),All dressed up and nowhere to go. Walking the streets all alone. Another night you wish that you could forget. Making yourself up as you go along. Who's gonna take you home tonight?. Who's gonna take you home?. Does god bless your transsexual heart?. True Trans Soul Rebel. Yet to be born you were already dead. You sleep with a gun beside you in bed. You follow it through to the obvious end. See your veins wide open. You bleed it out. You should've been a mother. You should've been a wife. You should've been gone from here years ago. You should be living a different life

two more lonely people,"(verse:). I need to feel your heartbeat when you say you love me. I don't wanna hear it if it's something that you don't mean. If I had to leave you now, there would be an empty space. It doesn't matter anyhow,. You can't take your things, and go your own way!. (chorus:). And there's two more lonely people,. In the world tonight, baby you and I. And there's two more lonely people,. Who gave up the fight, yea I'm on a ride. Well, you know my heart is achin'. And you don't have to break it,. If love don't change your mind. Then, there's two more lonely people, tonight.... (verse 2:). I don't want your pictures, I don't want your sympathy. We don't have to be friends, we don't have to be enemies. In my head I break it down,. and I am absolutely sure. That you and I could work it out,. Or we could kill the lights, on what we had before!. (chorus:). And there's two more lonely people,. In the world tonight, baby you and I. And there's two more lonely people,.

And I can't see you here, wonder where am I. Sort of feels like I'm running out of time. I haven't found all I was hoping to find. You said you got to be up in the morning. Gonna have an early night. And you starting to bore me, baby. Why'd you only call me when you're high?. Why'd you only ever call me when you're high?. Why'd you only ever call me when you're high?. Why'd you only ever call me when you're high?. Why'd you only ever call me when you're high?"
wrecking ball,"We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain. We jumped, never asking why. We kissed, I fell under your spell. A love no one could deny. Don't you ever say I just walked away. I will always want you. I can't live a lie, running for my life. I will always want you. I came in like a wrecking ball. I never hit so hard in love. All I wanted was to break your walls. All you ever did was break me. Yeah you, you wreck me. I put you high up in the sky. And now, you're not coming down. It slowly turned, you let me burn. And now, we're ashes on the ground.

yaw baby (break my heart) (feat. melanie safka),"I got shades in my eyes. I got pie in my skies. I got reasons to feel like I should. Well I jump and I sway. So stay out of my way. 'Cause I've taken all the bad news I can for good. I want to turn it around like a babe in the wood. I'm taking the bad news for good. Hey lets save the planet. Fly to the nearby stars. If there's a spark lets fan it. Go to where the lights are. Take me on a rollercoaster. You know I hate fast rides. Let me try something that I never tried. Oh lets do something stupid. I'm sick of being smart. Yeah baby come on in. Break my heart, break my heart. Well try, try, try to break my heart. And try, try, try to break my heart. And try, try, try to break my heart. Lets rage, let's try our wings. Bounce of walls, slip through the bars. Let's pray to pagan gods. And next time lets go to far. Lets do something crazy. Tired of being poised and suave. Yeah baby come on, break my heart. Oh let's do something out there. Off the grid and out of the park. Yeah baby come on in. Break my heart, break my heart. Come on try, try, try to break my heart. Well try, try, try to break my heart. Well try, try, try to break my heart. Lets sleep 'til noon and not to worry. Stay to long at the big bad ball. Let's go in a blaze of glory. And next life I wanna be tall. Lets do something shiny. Lets see if it glows in the dark. Yeah baby come on in, break my heart. Break my heart. Come on try, try, try to break my heart. Yea now try, try, try to break my heart. Try, try, try to break my heart. Yeah baby. Come on try. Come on try, try, try to break my heart. Come on try. Try, try, try to break my heart. Yeah Baby"

you're gonna make me lonesome when you go,"I've seen love go by my door. It's never been this close before. Never been so easy or so slow. Been shooting in the dark too long. When somethin's not right, it's wrong. You're gonna make me lonesome when you go. Dragon clouds so high above. I've only known careless love. It's always hit me from below. This time around it's more correct. Right on target, so direct. You're gonna make me lonesome when you go. Purple clover, Queen Anne's Lace. Crimson hair across your face. You could make me cry if you don't know. Can't remember what I was thinkin' of. You might be spoilin' me too much, love. You're gonna make me lonesome when you go. Flowers on the hillside, bloomin' crazy. Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme. Blue river runnin' slow and lazy. I could stay with you forever and never realize the time. Situations have ended sad. Relationships have all been bad. Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud. But there's no way I can compare. All those scenes to this affair. You're gonna make me lonesome when you go. You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doin'. Stayin' far behind without you. You're gonna make me wonder what I'm sayin'. Make me give myself a good talkin' to. I'll look for you in old Honolulu. San Francisco, Ashtabula. You're gonna have to leave me now, I know. But I'll see you in the sky above. In the tall grass, in the ones I love. You're gonna make me lonesome when you go. You're gonna make me lonesome when you go. You're gonna make me lonesome when you go. You're gonna make me lonesome when you go"
younger now,"Feels like I just woke up. Like all this time I've been asleep. Even though it's not who I am. I'm not afraid of who I used to be. No one stays the same (oh, oh). You know what goes up must come down (oh, oh). Change is a thing you can count on (oh, oh). I feel so much younger now (oh, oh). Feels like I've been living in a dream. But never make it to the end. My eyes open when they feel the light. It's always right before I'm about to scream. No one stays the same (oh, oh). You know what goes up must come down (oh, oh). Change is a thing you can count on (oh, oh). I feel so much younger now (oh, oh). What goes up must come down. What goes up must come down. What goes up must come down. What goes up must come down (yeah). No one stays the same (oh, oh). You know what goes comes back around (oh, oh). Change is a thing you can count on (oh, oh). I feel so much younger now (oh, oh).
