But we just can't help but feeling. Something has been lost along the way. And I know I'ts much too late. We've been down that road. Many times before. But it never hurt so bad. There's no looking back. We just bleed and breathe the air. I just used to love. How you held me back. When I tried to get away. But it's useless now. Something has been lost forever. I'm a fool, I know. But it's not a matter of who is right or wrong?. Maybe we could make it up. But we just can't help but feeling. Something has been lost along the way. And I know I'ts much too late. And I know I'ts much too late. I was sure that we could rise as we would fall. Maybe we could make it up. But you dream about yourself now.

let go,I remember brighter days. Then the dark ones killed my dreams. You deprived me of my needs. Give me up and I will leave. I know you won't give up on me. You get your fun by hurting me. It seems you can't stop fooling me. Just let it all go. I crossed the line from joy to pain. A hundred times and back again. I'm fighting voices in my head. Just let it all go. Why won't you hear me?. Let me out. I'm hopeless and sinking. I'm left to choke. I should have known. Eyes like ice. Freezing my last hopes. There's nothing left. You won't regret. I dry the tears that I've never shown you. Please set me free…. Morning breaks another day. Finds me drowning in my pain. I know you won't give up on me. You get your fun by hurting me.

liars,"I can't sleep tonight. How can I face another day?. I try to turn away. So I can hear them talk no more. All I'm trying to do is hold on strong. But how can I find my way?. Hiding from the world that burned my dreams. I'm falling down!!!. We just can't afford to pay for all their mistakes. It's about time that we should be paid off. Still they don't seem to grow a guilty conscience our lives. They are killing our dreams. And crawling away now. Liars. What did they say?. It's time they stopper these endless lias. I can't get it right. I never seem to find my way. There must be something wrong. But no one thinks they are to blame. All I'm trying to do is keeping sane. But how can I find my way?. Hunting for the cheat that burned my dreams. I'm falling down!!!. We just can't afford to pay for all their mistakes. It's about time that we should be paid off. Still they don't seem to grow a guilty conscience. The thirst for power makes their evil souls unfold. They are stealing our lives. They are killing our dreams. And crawling away now. Liars.. That did they say?. It's time they stopped these endless lias. We just can't afford to pay to all their mistakes. It's about time that we should be paid off.

who am i,Wind and fire. Now my lips are getting drier. On a dusty road so far away from you. Hear my fury in the silence that surrounds me. And I'm trying to unravel my mistakes. I'm gonna see what I can be. Recover you and me. Who am I. I don't know. Just a cowboy on his own. Where the lonely desert meets the big sky. Who am I. I don't know. But I'll never let you go. I will keep you here as long as I'm alive. As long as I'm alive. Blue horizon. I can see you in the distance. And I'm trying to resist the burning sun. Till the twilight. And the stars begin to shine bright. And I guess you may be looking at them too. I'm gonna see what I can be. Recover you and me. Who am I. I don't know. Just a cowboy on his own. Where the lonely desert meets the big sky. Who am I. I don't know. But I'll neve let you go. I will keep here as long as I'm alive. As long as I'm alive. Open spaces and how time passes by. All my journeys but I've nowhere to hide. Who am I. I don't know. But I'll never let you go. I will keep you here as long as I'm alive. As long as I'm alive
