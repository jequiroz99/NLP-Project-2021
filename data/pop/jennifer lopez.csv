I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me. Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain. And I don't think that I could face it all again. I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about. A deeper love I found in you,and I no longer doubt. You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made. And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid. Chorus:. I locked away my heart. But you just set it free. Emotions I felt. Held me back from what my life should be. I pushed you far away.

alive,"Time goes slowly now in my life. Fear no more of what I'm not sure. Searching to feel your soul. The strength to stand alone. The power of not knowing and letting go. I guess I've found my way. It's simple when it's right. Feeling lucky just to be here tonight. And happy just to be me and be alive. Love, in and out. Of my heart. And though life can be strange.

austin,"She left without leaving a number. Said she needed to clear her mind. He figured she'd gone back. to Austin. 'Cause she talked about it. all the time. It was almost a year. Before she called him up. Three rings and. an answering machine. Is what she got. If you're calling 'bout the car,. I sold it. If this is Tuesday night, I'm bowling. If you got something to sell. You're wasting your time. I'm not buying. If it's anybody else. Wait for the tone. You know what to do. And P.S if this is Austin. I still love you. The telephone fell to the counter. She heard but she couldn't believe. What kind of man. would hang on that long. What kind of love that must be. She waited three days. And then she tried again. She didn't know what she'd say. But she heard three rings and then. If its friday night,. Im at the ball game. And first thing Saturday. If it don't rain. Im headed up to the lake. And I'll be gone all weekend long. But I'll call you back. When I get home. On Sunday afternoon. And P.S. if this is Austin. I still love you. This time she left her number. But not another word. Then she waited by the phone. On Sunday evening. And this is what he heard. If you're calling about my heart. It's still yours. I shoulda listened to it a little more. Then it wouldn't have. Taken me so long. To know where i belong. And by the way boy this is no machine you've talking to. Can't you tell this is Austin. And I still love you"

When I met you I could never forget you. And boy when you look my way I realize more and more. I adore your pretty eyes. What I wanna know from you is. Do you wanna share my love's bliss.

be mine,"Looking at a coffee table book. At a small cafe on Broadway. Tryin' to find a way. Out of all trouble and dismay. Travelin' on a road unpaved. Everywhere I look. There is something there to remind me. Of feelings from yesterday. Listening to drama and hearsay. Only leaves me empty. You are my friend first. We talk about what hurts. We talk about love. Let's talk about us. Can't you see. I want you to be mine. What matters the most. I just want to see you up close. When I look into your heart. You got everything I want.

No one loves you more. Than me. Can't you see I want you to be mine?. I want you to be mine. Turn the music up. Riding on the highway. Thinking about the way. That I feel when I'm with you. A feeling that continues. To make me feel good. Even when I'm not near you. And I want it to stay. Emotions, I have so many. Love can give you plenty. But I know. You are my friend first. We talk about what hurts. We talk about love. Let's talk about us. Can't you see. I want you to be mine. What matters the most. I just want to see you up close. When I look into your heart.

big shot,"Well you went uptown riding in your limousine. With your fine Park Avenue clothes. You had the Dom Perignon in your hand. And the spoon up your nose. And when you wake up in the morning. With your head on fire. And your eyes to bloody to see. Go on and cry in your coffee. But don't come bitchin' to me. Because you had to be a big shot, didn't you. You had to open up your mouth. You had to be a big shot, didn't you. All your friends were so knocked out. You had to have the last word, last night. You had to have the white hot spotlight. You had to be a big shot last night. They were all impressed with your Halston dress. And the people that you knew at Elaine's. And the story of your latest sucess. Kept 'em so entertained. Aw but now you just don't remember. All the things you said. And you're not sure you want to know. I'll give you one hint, honey. You sure did put on a show. Yes, yes you had to be a big shot, didn't you. You had to prove it to the crowd. You had to be a big shot, didn't you. All your friends were so knocked out. You had to have the last word, last night. You're so much fun to be around. You had to have front page, bold type. You had to be a big shot last night. Well, it's no big sin to stick your two cents in. If you know when to leave it alone. But you went over the line. You couldn't see it was time to go home. No,no,no,no,no,no, you had to be a big shot, didn't you. You had to open up your mouth. You had to be a big shot, didn't you. All your friends were so knocked out. You had to have the last word, last night. So much fun to be around. You had to have a white hot spotlight. You had to be a big shot last night."

This is your day. Chorus:. It's time to be brave. Say I'm not afraid. Not anymore. I used to be calm. Now the temperature's changed. It just ain't the same. I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.

Really wish he would let me in. 'Cause the same way you scared of him. He's scared of bein' hurt again. it's time to let go. Let go of your heart. It's time for a brand new start. Never know we might never part. Baby don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. This is your day. This is your day. Chorus:. It's time to be brave. Say I'm not afraid. Not anymore. I used to be calm.

Chasing the fantasies. That filled our minds. You knew how I loved you. But my spirit was free. Laughing at the questions. That you once asked of me. Repeat 1. Now looking back at all we've planned. We let so many dreams. Just slip through our hands. Why must we wait so long?. Before we see. How sad the answers. To those questions can be. Repeat 1. Repeat 2.

frozen moments (brave bonus track),"Frozen Moments. Love has done a number on my mind. Though I sit and wonder I don't ask why. Some decisions I've made haven't altogether been mine. Now I don't feel a thing, I feel ok. No I'm not bitter, I'm not cold. I'm just frozen for a moment. My vision is impaired, My heart is under repair. What can I say about love. I know what it means to have too little and too much. Crowding my thoughts. What I really want is to not think about it at all. Life is never easy when you need it to be. Desire can deceive you. Its better to daydream. Somewhere deep down inside. I knew it wasn't the right thing. But I didn't want to be wrong. That's a chance you take. No I'm not bitter, I'm not cold.

i got you,"Jennifer Lopez - I Got You Lyrics. Right here. Something in the dark shot glasses, you know. Something that you can lean to. Something that you can ride to. Something that you can step to. You know. Sometimes real love can be. Not seen 'cause you're thinkin'. What's right in front of you. Can't be the one for you. Then one day you realize that. There are feelings that you can't hold back. And you're so caught up. Now that's all you think of. Crazy how. All that talk of us not able to last. Just because of mistakes we made in the past. But they fail to understand. [Chorus:]. I got you. And nobody can come to change a thing. 'Cause you gotta know. You got me. And it feels so good to have your back now. I'm so proud. I got you. And if somebody tries to take you from me. They will see I've got you. You got me. I got you. Things are often said to. Doubt what I feel for you. But words that people say. Won't take my love away. Although it hurts sometimes, it's alright. But why they say some things that ain't right. I never know but please understand that baby, it ain't nothing. All that talk of us not able to last. Just because of mistakes we made in the past. But they fail to understand. I got you. And nobody can come to change a thing. 'Cause you gotta know. You got me. And it feels so good to have your back now. I'm so proud. I got you. And if somebody tries to take you from me. They will see I've got you (I got you, baby). You got me (you got me, baby). I got you (I got you, baby). You got me (you got me, baby). So that's all that people can do. Nevermind all the love, all that you. gotta do is simply love, trust, and just stay.... Together we'll get through whatever if we. Don't let speculations make situations up. We'll be alright. I got you. And nobody can come to change a thing. 'Cause you gotta know. You got me. And it feels so good to have your back now. I'm so proud. I got you. And if somebody tries to take you from me. They will see I've got you (I got you, baby). You got me (you got me, babe). I got you. And nobody can come to change a thing (feels so good inside). 'Cause you gotta know. You got me. And it feels so good to have your back now. I'm so proud. I got you.

i need love,"Oh, oh oh.... This is where my story begins. Standing here with you I'm about to give in. And I'm gonna give all I can give. Even though in previous relationships. I might have been mischievous. I wasn't already ready I admit to this. But what a good feeling it is. I've had a lot of crushes close to nothing like this. Everytime the subject would come up. I made up every excuse that I could think of. I used to run but now I'm getting warmed up. In a few words this feeling I could sum up. CHORUS. I need love. For the first time in my life. I need love. Ain't no love up in the club. I need love. Want to cuddle up to somethin'. That make me feel like I'm somethin'. Gettin' sick and tired of frontin' [2x]. I need. I was hangin' out with my friends. Seven nights a week If there's a party I'm in. I started getting sick of it. But when I looked back I didn't know what it meant. I guess I wasn't interested. In finding something real though I was looking for it. You should've been looking for me. But you opened up my eyes and now I can see. And everytime the subject would come up. When they say ""I love you"" Then I only dumb up. A lot of guys putting a girl or shut up. But you're the only guy that told me your love was endless. A lot of words with feeling can not sum up. But first I had to figure out who I was. To try and understand that there ain't no shortcuts. Now the only thing that's missing is your love. I need love. For the first time in my life. I need love. Ain't no love up in the club. I need love. Want to cuddle up to somethin'. That make me feel like I'm somethin'. Gettin' sick and tired of frontin' [2x]. I need. [OTHER]. Slow dance, hold hands. All I want is romance. If it's real, let me know it's real. Baby take a chance. 'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me. And I got a lot of love to give. Baby don't you hear me [2x]. CHORUS [3x]. [OTHER]. (Por Fernando Azevedo)"
i wish i wasn't,[Verse 1]. I'm home alone again. And you're out hangin with your friends. So you say. Somehow I know it's not quite that way. It's getting pretty late. And you haven't checked on me all day. When I. called you didn't answer. Now I'm feeling like your ignoring me. I wish that you were home. Holding me tight in your arms. And I wish I could go back. To the day before we met. And skip my regret. [Chorus:] I wish I wasn't in love with you. So you couldn't hurt me. it just ain't fair the way you treat me. No you don't. deserve me. Wasting my time thinking bout you when you ain't never gon change. I wish I wasn't in love with you so I. wouldn't feel this way. [Verse 2]. When you touch me my heart melts. And everything you did wrong I forgive. So you play me and take advantage. Of the love. that I feel for you. Why you wanna hurt me so bad. I believed in you that's why I'm so mad. Now I'm drowning in. disappointment. And it's hard for me to even look at you. And I wish that you were home. Holding me tight in your arms. And. I wish I could go back. To the day before we met. And skip my regret. [Chorus]. [Bridge]. Said you care about me. But from what I see. I ain't feeling that. So I disagree. Gave you all my love. And understanding. And you're treating me like your enemy. So leave me alone. Don't want nothing from you. Just go back where you came from. This house is no longer your home. You are not welcome no no no more. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. Hear you knockin' at the door again. I'm wonderin' should I let you in. I open uo the door and see. The flowers for me. So. beautiful in your hand. Please stop begging me to take you back. I've always been a sucker for romance. And before you know. it I concede. You're all over me. Oh no here I go again. I wish I wasn't in love with you. So you couldn't hurt me

And when the angels call me a fool. For giving all my grace up for you. I won't look back. But when they ask, who did you love. Let it be me. Let it be me that you think of. When everything tells you to give it up. Let it be me that will anchor your soul. Until the clouds fall out of the sky. And the snow fall down in July. Let it be me that you think of.

love make the world go round (feat. lin-manuel miranda),"[Lin-Manuel Miranda]. And love is love, is love, is love is love. Is love, is love, is love, is love. [Jennifer Lopez]. I'm... I'm wide awake. Ready to create. Everything I've imagined. Hearts, without any hate. Crying for change. Causing a chain reaction. Those who hate us and fear us. Can not keep us down. Cause we hear in our heartbeat a beautiful sound. If they try to deny us or silence us now. We just say no, oh, yeah, we let 'em know. Love make the world go round. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. Love make the world go round. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. Love make the world go round-ound-ound-ound. Love make the world go round. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. We... we'll be alright. Living our lives. Finding some satisfaction. No, we're not gonna hide. No fear from our eyes. Love is a call to action. Those who hate us and fear us. Can not keep us down. Cause we hear in our heartbeat a beautiful sound. If they try to deny us or silence us now. We just say no, oh, yeah, we let 'em know. Love make the world go round. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. Love make the world go round. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. Love make the world go round-ound-ound-ound. Love make the world go round. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. (Dale). Yeah, when the music is playing and the place is jumping. When the bass rattles your ribcage. Hey something's changed. I'm dancing face to face with a stranger. A moment of grace, you know that you're safe, and they just. Drop the beat the moment you most needed it. You came in as a question until the music completed it. Me and you in the universe, moving in unison, coming in hot. But in the grand scheme what do we got?. What we got is love. Even when the sinners hate us. We can not let 'em diminish or intimidate us. We sing out, we got the rhythm and the truth on our side. We cut through the divide and we do it with pride. (Wake up, wake up, wake up). A generation of innovators. Unable to patiently wait for change. Cause change is what they've been afraid of. Their malevolence can wait. Raise the level of debate. Celebrate, elevate, love, love. (Love make the world go round). Cannot be killed or swept aside. (Love make the world go round). And fill the world with music, love and pride. (Love make the world go round. Love make the world go round). And love is love, is love, is love is love. Is love, is love, is love, is love. (La-la-la-la-la-la-la). Love make the world go round. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. Love make the world go round. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. Love make the world go round-ound-ound-ound. Love make the world go round. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. Love make the world go round. We're not staying inside today. They're not taking our pride away. Le-lo-la-la-lo-le. We're not staying inside today. They're not taking our pride away. Le-lo-la-la-lo-le. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. Love make the world go round"
loving you,"Verse 1:. Would you mind. If I took the time to get to know you. Cause it's been a while since all we been through. And even though I said my feelings wouldn't change. Nothing stays the same... ooh.... I can see. When I look in your eyes you mean no harm. It's just the way you munipulate me with your charm. And I can tell the love I have for you still strong. And there ain't nothin wrong with me still lovin you.... Chorus:. After all that we been through. Found myself still lovin' you. But I think we need to take the time to get it right. Cause I never gave up on a good thing. Never gave up on the love we had. We just need to take it slow. Verse 2:. In the past. You would act as if you don't really care. You fight and argue almost anywhere. Lookin back sometimes I feel like such a fool. For putting up with you... ooh.... Baby please, understand if it seems I'm confused. It's just that it might take me. Some time to get used to you. When I think of all the things we used to do, baby. I just find myself still lovin' you. Chorus:. After all that we been through. Found myself still lovin you. But I think we need to take the time to get it right. Cause I never gave up on a good thing. Never gave up on the love we had, baby. We just need to take it slow. Bridge:. I believe you and me had a chance to make this right. Oh baby if your heart is in it. I'm still with it. Even after all of this time has passed. Oo I'm still lovin' you.... Chorus:. After all that we been through, yea. Found myself still lovin'' you. But I think we need to take the time to get it right. Cause I never gave up on a good thing.

pieces,"I was down for the count. Feeling like I’ve come to the end. Nothing really mattered. Nothing left for me to meant. And then you came. And I still couldn’t see. Til you tore down every wall in me. How you healed me with your patience. If it’s all I ever do. I never stop loving you. Chorus:. Cuz I’m alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe. And there ain’t no doubt about it, there ain’t no doubt about it. I’m in love. And it’s all because of you. I was fading but you pulled me through. Cuz I’m awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I’d die. And there ain’t no doubt about it. As love and I have found it. Feel the beat again, stronger than before. I’m gonna give you my heart until it beats no more. I was in place full of pain. With a broken down heart in despair. He took away my feelings. And beat that heart for me again. But then you crashed through the door, to my soul. Put back all the pieces and made me home. I was living in the past. Now I’m never looking back, I’m never looking back. Chorus:. Cuz I’m alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe. And there ain’t no doubt about it, there ain’t no doubt about it. I’m in love. And it’s all because of you. I was fading but you pulled me through. Cuz I’m awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I’d die. And there ain’t no doubt about it. As love and I have found it. Feel the beat again, stronger than before. I’m gonna give you my heart until it beats no more. Whatever you want me to. I’m gonna see you through. All I ever do. Never stop loving you. Chorus:. Cuz I’m alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe. And there ain’t no doubt about it, there ain’t no doubt about it. I’m in love. And it’s all because of you. I was fading but you pulled me through. Cuz I’m awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I’d die. And there ain’t no doubt about it. As love and I have found it. Feel the beat again, stronger than before. I’m gonna give you my heart until it beats no more"

promise me you'll try,I know it's on your heart. That a love like ours shall never fall apart. You're so afraid of the rain. So I'll take your hand. And I'll love you in the best way that I can. And I only expect the same. Chours:. Don't promise forever. Don't promise me the sun and sky. Don't pretent to know you'll never make me cry. Just hold me now. And promise me you'll try. Though I'm sure of what I feel. Never thought a love so true felt so unreal. And I'm a little afraid myself. But if you love me day by day. With an honest heart and just a little faith. Baby time will tell the tale. Chours(2x).
remember me this way,Every now and then we find a special friend. Who never lets us down. Who understands it all. Reaches out each time you fall. You're the best friend that I've found. I know you can't stay. But part of you will never ever go away. Your heart will stay. I'll make a wish for you. And hope it will come true. That life will just be kind. To such a gentle mind. If you lose your way. Think back on yesterday. Remember me this way. Remember me this way. I don't need eyes to see. The love you bring to me. No matter where I go. And I know that you'll be there. For ever more a part of me you're everywhere. I'll always care. I'll make a wish for you. And hope it will come true. That life will just be kind. To such a gentle mind. If you lose your way. Think back on yesterday. Remember me this way. Remember me this way. And I'll be right behind your shoulder watching you. I'll be standing by your side in all you do. And I won't ever leave as long as you believe. You just believe.... CHorus:. I'll make a wish for you. And hope it will come true. That life will just be kind. To such a gentle mind. And if you lose your way. Think back on yesterday. Remember me this way. Remember me this way. Reeee-member meeee thiiiiias waa-aay...

ryde or die,"Jennifer Lopez - Ryde Or Die Lyrics. Crazy over you. I don't know what to do. I don't understand why I'm crazy. Over you, I don't know what to do. I do. I would give up everything just to feel and be with you (if I had to). I would pawn the ring you gave to me just to feed you (if I had to). I would give my very last breath just to help save you (if I had to). I would tell a lie just because I know you are the truth. [Chorus:]. I'd ryde for you. 'Cause you're the truth. I'd die for you. Ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you. And I'll do anything that pleases you. Only you. If I had to. I would throw away my only wish just to prove to you (if I had to). I would die all alone if living meant without you (if I had to). I would go through all the pain again just to find you (if I had to). I'd surrender all my love just because I love you. I don't understand why I'm crazy. over you, I don't know what to do. I don't understand why I'm crazy. over you, I don't know what to do. I'd ryde for you. 'Cause you're the truth. I'd die for you. Ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you. And I'll do anything that pleases you. I'd ryde for you. 'Cause you're the truth. I'd die for you. Ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you. And I'll do anything that pleases you. I wanna run to you. Breathe as one with you. Absent in time without you. Existing only for you. Every dream is of you. Only turn to you. My baby, my love. Only turn to you, woo, woo. I'd ryde for you. 'Cause you're the truth. I'd die for you. Ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you. And I'll do anything that pleases you. I'm gonna run for you. I'd ryde for you. 'Cause you're the truth. I'd die for you. Ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you. And I'll do anything that pleases you"

She put her fingers in the imprints. at Mann's Chinese Theatre show. She coulda been a movie star. Never got the chance to go that far. Her life was stole. Now we'll never know. No no no no oh. They were crying to the camera. Said he never fitted in. He wasn't welcomed. He showed up to the parties. He was hanging in. Some guys puttin' him down. Bullying him round round. Now I wish I woulda talked to him. Gave him the time of day. Not turn away. If I woulda been the one to maybe go this far. He might have stayed at home. Playing angry chords on his guitar. He's not invisible anymore. With his baggy pants and his legs in chains. Since he walked through that classroom door. Everybody knows his name. Mary's got the same size hands (Oh). As Marilyn Monroe. She put her fingers in the imprints (Ooh). at Mann's Chinese Theatre show. She coulda been a movie star. Never got the chance to go that far. Her life was stole. Now we'll never know.

Should've never kissed you. Should've never held your hand. Got to find a way to let these feelings go. What did I do the day I let you slip into my soul. It was then, when I realized. That I would always want you in my life. No one else can know of the things. That we've been saying on the telephone. It would be so bad. If they even knew that me and you. Were secretly into each other. (Chorus:). Should've never told you. That I cared about you. Didn't think that it would be, so bad. Should've never kissed you. Should've never held your hand. Got to find a way to let these feelings go. (Bridge:). I'm so scared, trembling inside. Cause I'm feeling like somebody else already knows. Oh my god, I love you both so much. And to have to choose between the two. Is hurting me so deep inside. (Chorus:). Should've never told you. That I cared about you. Didn't think that it would be, so bad hum.

Still in my life no matter what you had to do to be there. Well, it's been a while and here we are lookin' back on times that we shared. I still imagine us being young and so in love. Never apart, you were my heart. Seems like it's always just been us. [Chorus:]. I remember we were in the park. Holding hands and you said to me. I'm the only thing you need. And I would make your life complete. If I said I'd be your girl. You would stay with me forever. Boy, you never let me down. Through it all you're still around. Still around (yeah). I still believe in all the things you said to me in those days. You gave me love and kept your word with every promise you made. I sing your favorite song inside my head when you're not with me. Until you come back home and take me in your arms and hold me. I can imagine us being old and still in love. Never apart, you are my heart. Makes me smile, we're still in love. I remember we were in the park. Holding hands and you said to me. I'm the only thing you need. And I would make your life complete. If I said I'd be your girl. You would stay with me forever. Boy, you never let me down. Through it all you're still around. Looking back through all the years. [Man speaking:]. Heh. You remember the first time I went to your house. And your father looked at me like I had three heads. (And I will never forget the day). Heh. We were so in love. (Looking back through all the years). You were so beautiful and so young. (And I will never forget the day you came into my life and what you said to me). I can't believe you're still mine. That's crazy. I love you. I remember we were in the park (we were in the park). Holding hands and you said to me (holding hands). I'm the only thing you need. And I would make your life complete (and I would your life complete). If I said I'd be your girl.

story of my life,"Your relation to me. Feeds my empty existence. I guess I choose what to see. Because I'm feeling resistance. So turn the lights on below. The time we have is too precious.

I'm falling again for someone who doesn't feel. alright. That's the story of my life. I thought you were ready to be. The start of my happy ending. Sometimes I choose what to see.

the pleasure is mine,"Baby relax we've been waiting for this. And we deserve the heavenly bliss. That waits underneath the stars above. Can't you hear the begging ""Let's Make Love""?. From the bottom of my heart, I give you my soul. Right here in this room the truth unfolds. (Chorus). It's saying, stop playing. Delaying the devine. The pleasure is mine. Let me give some to you. We can take out time. Nothing I'd rather do. Then make you feel fine. Make you light shine. Give you moments you can treasure. Forever. Remember. The pleasure is mine(mine, mine, all mine). Everyday I've been dreaming about. How it's gonna be to find you out. To be sharing your kiss. To be like this. What I wouldn't do for a taste of your lips. So let's not waste one second more. Let's cut the lights, and let's lock the door. (Chorus). Oh, baby, I don't wanna breathe. Don't want to change a single vibe. Nobody else I'd rather see. Then you like this before my eyes. Wanna be everything you need. Keep you satisfied. I'm praying, stop playing. (Chorus)"
the point,its a good thing that i cant sleep. but i stay up all night a start to weep. like a willow tree cought in the rain. i get that thought again and agian. i cloose my eyes but sece to dream. like i lost time an empty steam. of thoughts runnin through my head. and i wake and wish world was dead. turn turnin in to sunlight. my skin dont burn as i fall fall in full flight. i bloom with flower. soft the rain. im stern like a tower. again and again. i cry. cry with the wolves they stare. and i think am i really there. walk down arond and around. the people talking but theres no sound. climbing the mountain swimin the ocean. cry but see nothing is there some solotion. look down around. why cant i fall into picture. no sound (no sound). is there any victor. turn turnin in to sunlight. my skin dont burn as i fall fall in full flight. i bloom with flower. soft the rain. im stern like a tower. again and again. i cry. cry with the wolves they stare. and i think am i really there. i live a life of hurt and pain. all wanta do is the chain. yeah yeah think about it. people only stop to spit. im out to steal i dont deserve. round the bend i drop the curve. turn turnin in to sunlight. my skin dont burn as i fall fall in full flight. i bloom with flower. soft the rain. im stern like a tower. again and again. i cry. cry with the wolves they stare. and i think am i really there
the way it is,"It always feels like a love to me…in the beginning. My mind is just a mirror of the way my heart wants it to be…. I hope to see everything in his eyes, cause that’s where it starts with the truth and the lies. And I can-not hide my emotion; you cannot hide your intentions from me.. (Chorus). Don’t you think, what I’m saying is, it’s just the way it is, it’s just the way it is. Not everything is what you say it is, that’s just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is. And everything you do to me, it’ll be done to you. And everything I put you through, well then-I’ll-go-through. But I’m willing to take that chance, for this type of romance…its special baby. I always look for love to be, so exciting…. But you can’t force it I’m finding, in reality chemistry is everything.. (Chorus x 2). Don’t you think, what I’m saying is, it’s just the way it is, it’s just the way it is. Not everything is what you say it is, that’s just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is…. Yeah yeah. What your perception is, of our connection is simply perfection and it’s the same thing. If you’re accepting it, then I’m accepting it, simple perfection and its just the same thing,. (Chorus x 3). Don’t you think, what I’m saying is, it’s just the way it is, it’s just the way it is. Not everything is what you say it is, that’s just the way it is the way it is the way it is!"
the wish for your love,"Come and whisper to me of a time. When you felt like this. With a unimaginable kiss that's made especially for me. You can't avoid it. I'm telling you to look. If I carressed you. You would melt away in my hands. CHOURS:. Dream with me. Come and let me feel it. The pasion that was born in me. With the fire of your love. Just one more night. I wantto be next to you and fly. Be your vice and a little more. The wish for your love. I want to provoke you slowly now that I have you here. What noboy else is suppose to give. That's what I'm giving you. You can't avoid it. I'm telling you to look. If I carressed you. You'd melt away in my hands. (CHOURS). Here you have me, I'm all yours. What you've been looking for in me, I'm giving to you."
this boy's fire,"I believe in never let my strip get hotter. Than something I can get out of. One that heats up on me. I told 'em this would be a once time dance. Meaning one time chance. After I said that, oh. That's when he got close to me. All the other music stopped but the violin. Conversation, one dance, sip a bottle, another ???. Now I'm asking myself ""what has he done to me?"". This can't turn into love, no. The rose petals were all in the air. Just might need that firetruck. To come and get me. (Chorus:). Dip me in water. 'Cause this boy's fire. It's got a hold of me. Can't say I don't want it. 'Cause he really put it on me. In a way that I don't know. If I'm going ???. Dip me in water. 'Cause this boy's fire. It's got a hold of me. Didn't have to know from your body. Put it on me. Not just physically but mentally ???. . Gotta call a cab. If I don't need gonna have me. With every young stunna in the hood wanna have me. Uh, so much of him I couldn't surrender. 'Cause I know where this could end up. And with that right now I can't play. I know I drive him loco. But that's just the way. You make a mama's hips go. This can't turn into love, no. The rose petals were all in the air. Just might need that firetruck. To come and get me. . Chorus:. Dip me in water. 'Cause this boy's fire. It's got a hold of me. Can't say I don't want it. 'Cause he really put it on me. In a way that I don't know. If I'm going ???. Dip me in water. 'Cause this boy's fire. It's got a hold of me. Didn't have to know from your body. Put it on me. Not just physically but mentally ???"
this is me,"How can you just say that you love me yet to leave you alone. You said these walls were here to protect us, but it's still not a home. All these questions that are burning inside with. answers I'll never know. 'Cause you're the only one who knows how you feel, but you're not letting me know. What is it, love. Can I help you. I see where this has gone and what it's coming to. I look to you. Enough. [Chorus:]. I can't believe this is me. Where I can touch and not feel you. I feel I'm lost in a dream. Between what is and what seems. Having to face not to need you. You know you owe it to me. How can you think we don't need you. I'm tired of running away from my fear and the day. That our life has no meaning. Without a word or a reason. Like a coward, you're leaving. Sitting here inside an empty room that was filled with us. Only boxes to define what was left of what we used to call love. It's sad that after all of this time, you have nothing to say. Ooh, and the only thing that you could've done, you choose to walk away. I'm thankful, love. I don't hate you. 'Cause I'd rather live and know than what you put me through. I needed you. Somehow. I can't believe this is me. Where I can touch and not feel you. I feel I'm lost in a dream. Between what is and what seems. Having to face not to need you. How could you do this to me. How could you think we don't need you. I'm tired of running away from the fear and the day. That our life has no meaning. Without a word or a reason. Like a coward, you're leaving. I can't believe this is me. I wasn't wont to believe you. I feel I'm lost in a dream. Between what is and what seems. Having to face not to need you. How could you do this to me. How could you think we don't need you. I'm tired of running away from my fear of the day. That our life has no meaning. Without a word or a reason. Like a coward, you're leaving"
this time,"I CRIED WHEN YOU TOLD ME I WASN'T THE ONE FOR YOU. I WEEPED WHEN YOU SAID ""THE CHOICE WAS HER OR YOU"". BUT NOW I KNOW YOU AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT A BOY. A PULL TOY. CAUSE IF YOU WAS A MAN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE LET ME GO OOO!. chorus. THIS TIME I'M THE ONE WHO'S GONNA MAKE YOU CRY. THIS TIME I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU COME BACK AND TELL ME LIES. YEA THIS TIME I'M THE ONE WHO'S KICKING YO ASS TO THE CURB. THIS TIME I'M THE ONE'S WHO'S BLURBING ALL THE WORDS. . MY BODY WENT NUMB WHEN YOU TOLD ME I WASN'T YOUR REASON FOR LIFE. YOU SAID I WAS A WASTE OF TIME ""WHY DID I EVEN DROP A DIME"" AND SO. I CRIED AND LIED TO OTHERS TIED MY LIFE TO YOU UNTIL I REALIZED YOU LEFT ME. BEHIND ALONG WITH SORROWFUL TEARS OOH!."
to love is forever,"You invaded my heart. With this love that sometimes clouds the reason. And you can't think. I feel the same way too. From the first time I seen you, I was in love. I can't keep quiet anymore. CHOURS:. My love is forever. You're my reason, my peace. My light, my only truth. Love is givin with nothing to expect in return. You are how I dream. Your smile is the sun of every dawn. Without you, I don't know how I breath. I want to wake up next to you. In your body I found my other half. You taught me how to be a woman. (CHOURS). Love is givin with nothing to expect in return. (CHOURS). Love is givin with nothing to expect in return"
too late,"Chorus:. First you say that you have to go away. I never should have been with you anyway. Now you say you want to stay. It's too late, cause I'm sending you on your way. You say that you have to go away. I never really loved you anyway. Now you say you want to stay. It's too late, it's too late. Like a puppet on a string. you came and took control of me. Would've given anything. to be your one and only. Filled my head with fantasies. of what one day you'd give to me. Full of hope of what could be. (I sat and waited patiently). Chorus (1x). For a time you were for me --. everything that I could need. Gave me time and diamond rings. but something else was missing. Never stayed the whole night through. I suffered, prayed, and cried for you. After all that we've been through. I feel I never really knew you. Chorus (1x). There's no need to call me on the phone. Don't wanna hear from you no more. No need -- don't call. Don't be a fool and stand outside my door. cause being the woman that I am. I got to go on with other plans. Chorus (to fade)."
troubeaux (feat. nas),"[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]. This love is so dangerous. But I kind of like the thrill. It's like a sugar rush. It's all in the way you make me feel. I didn't see you coming, but you broke me down. 'Cause you got some nerve about you. Walk up like I know you. Both hands and your tattoos. One smile, oh. [Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]. I gotta admit you're fly. And I love it how you talk babe. Getting all in my mind. Running it like a field play. I didn't see you coming, but you broke me down. 'Cause you got some nerve love. Don't you walk up like I know you. Both hands and your tattoos. One smile, oh. [Hook:]. This ain't no ordinary boy. This ain't no ordinary boy. See the funny thing about you. You got me doin' things I wouldn't do. You ain't no ordinary boy. You gon' be troubeaux. (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh). You gon' be troubeaux. (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh). You gon' be troubeaux. [Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]. I, deep down I should be good. I ain't blind, you're the kind of guy. That always got all these girls running after you. Do I entertain or play with you?. Or just be cool?. 'Cause you got some nerve about you. Walk up like I know you. Both hands and your tattoos. One smile, oh. Don't sleep. I think I'm a burn too fast. So close. Wrapped up in the heat of love. I'm having fantasies. Of how it's gonna be. 'Cause you got some nerve about you. Walk up like I know you. Both hands and your tattoos. Still. [Hook]. [Verse 4: Nas]. Yo, got Henny in the cup, Jenny knows what's up. She with a real one not pretending to be tough. Got three cases, might have a warrant I don't know about. Beef I don't know about, weed I can't go without. My money used to pile up. every beginning of the month. Unconditional love, in the beginning it was lust. Hustler, shooter, was a dealer on the block. Now my future's on top no longer dealing with the thots. I don't go nowhere without the handle. Like I heard little pussy was out in Louisiana. Got friends in the fed, some dead over drugs. Fucking with me it's high-risk but she still in love. (We in love baby). Benny Medina might wanna pay me to leave ya. I'm bad for your image, the ghetto menacing diva. 'Cause some say Nas is trouble. We all live, just ignore them nice guys is boring, I got you. [Hook]"
until it beats no more,"I was down for the count. Feeling like I’ve come to the end. Nothing really mattered. Nothing left for me to meant. And then you came. And I still couldn’t see. Til you tore down every wall in me. How you healed me with your patience. If it’s all I ever do. I never stop loving you. Chorus:. Cuz I’m alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe. And there ain’t no doubt about it, there ain’t no doubt about it. I’m in love. And it’s all because of you. I was fading but you pulled me through. Cuz I’m awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I’d die. And there ain’t no doubt about it. As love and I have found it. Feel the beat again, stronger than before. I’m gonna give you my heart until it beats no more. I was in place full of pain. With a broken down heart in despair. He took away my feelings. And beat that heart for me again. But then you crashed through the door, to my soul. Put back all the pieces and made me home. I was living in the past. Now I’m never looking back, I’m never looking back. Chorus:. Cuz I’m alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe. And there ain’t no doubt about it, there ain’t no doubt about it. I’m in love. And it’s all because of you.

we gotta talk,"chorus:Ooh baby, come and talk to me. Together we can work this out. We gotta love thing we're talking about. The way you looked at me. Tells me you're sorry. You walked by me. Whispering you love me. When I tried to hold you tight. You pulled away. But you wanted me to stay. Instead you ran away. Baby, talk to me. Let's stop playing games. Don't turn away from me. Just look me straight in the eyes. Don't try to sweet talk me. With those nasty words you say. Baby, just be real and tell me how you feel, baby. Repeat chorus. The way you tricked me. You know that wasn't right, ooh. You tried to fix it. But all we did is fight. Because I gave you everything I had to give. If you know it's worth the fight. We gotta compromise. Baby, talk to me. And tell me what's wrong. Come sit down next to me. And let me feel the vibe you're on. Come lay your head on me. And everything will be alright. But we must communicate. Tomorrow it could be too late. Repeat chorus. Cause I love you boy. And I need you here. Together we can make this thing work out. To think about what we could miss. Makes me wanna lose my mind. Talk to me. Come on, come on. Talk to me, oh. Makes me want a chance baby.... Repeat chorus till end."
what i call love,"Whatever you don't know. Baby, I will teach you. Anywhere you go. All my love can reach you. Not a wall too high, or a mountainside. Can keep me from seeing you. Whenever you're too tired. I can give you power. Go the extra mile. In your darkest hour. Any day or night, call my name and I. I'll come running to be with you. And I'll be fierce as a tiger. If anyone tries to fight ya. But I'll be soft as a lamb when you're in my hands. I can be however I need to. That's what I call love. That's what I call love. The fears and the flaws, we stand through it all. That's what I call love. I will understand. When you need space. I will hold your hand. When you're in pain. I'll be patient and pause, 'cause relationships. Require give and take. And I will never let my ego. Nor the words of other people. Get in the way, or stop me from saying. How much I care and I need you. That's what I call love. That's what I call love. The fears and the flaws, we stand through it all. That's what I call love. For better or for worse. That's what I call love, baby. It's more than just a word. Let me show you my love, baby. That's what I call love (that's what I call love). That's what I call love (love, love, love). The fears and the flaws, we stand through it all. That's what I call love. That's what I call love (love, love, love). That's what I call love (love, love, love). The fears and the flaws, we stand through it all. That's what I call love. That's what I call love. That's what I call love. That's what I call love. That's what I call love. That's what I call love. That's what I call love"
what you mean to me (feat. trey songz),"Standing here. All at once. All the words run dry. Something's changed. Can't explain. And I can't deny. Turning in circles. And blurring the lights. The unspoken is calling us tonight. I won't lie. I'm a little bit frightened by my imagination. I swear I'll try. Cause I'm feeling enlightened, my inspiration. We can fly if we want to. I promise you, your faith will give you wings. Just take the second star on the right. Straight ahead to the morning light. Close your eyes. When your dream. That's where I will be. Say it's true. Yeah you do. Say you do believe. The greatest adventures are waiting so patiently. The angels are calling us tonight. I won't lie. I'm a little bit frightened by my imagination. I swear I'll try. Cause I'm feeling enlightened, my inspiration. We can fly if we want to. I promise you, your faith will give you wings. Just take the second star on the right. Straight ahead to the morning light. Every shape and all the colors. All the love from all the lovers. Never could express just what you mean to me. 'Cause every word and every sentence. Doesn't seem to make a difference. Nothing can express just what you mean to me. No, I won't lie. I'm a little bit frightened by my imagination. I swear I'll try. Cause I'm feeling enlightened, my inspiration. We can fly if we want to. I promise you, your faith will give you wings. Just take the second star on the right. Straight ahead to the morning light. Just take the second star on the right. Straight ahead to the morning light. Every star that's ever fallen. Knows the ways to where we're goin. Now I really know just what you mean to me"
whatever you wanna do,"Jennifer Lopez - Whatever You Wanna Do Lyrics. Come on man, give me something I can move to. Give me some of that funk. Yeah. Yeah. Wooo. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Pulled up, at the red light. Cutie popped up on my left side. Window down, waiting for my reply. Not a word, I saw it in his eyes. Tell me something good baby. He said whatever you wanna do. He pulled to the curb, cops flash by. I got out with catwalk shy. Short skirt, golden brown thighs. Gucci heels, four inch high. Baby touch my face. My man said whatever you wanna do. Now I, I said I usually need some time to get inside. So I don't know why you and me feel so right. Baby we need tonight. We sippin', music all loud. Conversation, your lollypop mouth. You open up, sweet things come out. Whisper to me, what you talkin' 'bout. I said I think you know. He said whatever you wanna do. You stand up, taking my breath. It's your song so you do it two steps. I turned away, moved my hips slow. Your thoughts, fully exposed. Now we better stop playing. I said what are you gonna do. Now I, I usually take my time to get inside. So I don't know why you and me feel so right. You and I need tonight. Whatever you want (hey, hey). It's all good. Now I normally take my time to get inside. So I, I don't know why it feels so right. So maybe we need tonight. Baby, we need (hey, yeah). Whatever you want (hey, hey)"

you,"You are the one who makes me happy. When everything else turns to grey. Yours is the voice that wakes me mornings. And sends me out into the day. You are the crowd that sits quiet. Listening to me. To all the mad sense I make. You are one of the few things worth remembering. And if it's all true. How can anyone mean more to me. Than you. Sorry if sometimes I look past you. There's no one beyond your eyes. Inside my head the wheels are turning. Hey, sometimes I'm not so wise. You are heart (you are my heart, you're my, my inspiration). Just like the old love song goes (just like a love song). You are one of the few things worth remembering. And if it's all true. How can anyone mean more to me. Than you. (You are my heart, you're my, my inspiration). Just like the old love song goes (just like a love song). You are one of the few things worth remembering. And if it's all true. How can anyone mean more to me. Than you. (You're the one) you. (You're the one, you're the one, ooh..., you're the one for me)"
