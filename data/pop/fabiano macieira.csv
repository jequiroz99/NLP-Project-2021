my son,"One last step to finalize the day. I really wanna go my home. The road is tough, but I don't walk alone. he always know the right thing to say to me. The days are not the same. but with the days, comes your grace. All I want is hear your voice to say. (My son) , don't worry, carry on. (Hold on) , and listen what a say to you. (My son) , stay away, stay miles away. from the world will fade away. the world will fade away. Oh oh, what I'm feeling now. is something that I never felt. That I never felt in my entire life before. I'm with the one who really catch my falls. makes me breath and believe. that he's the one that I can trust. You always say to me. (My son) , don't worry, carry on. (Hold on) , and listen what a say to you. (My son) , stay away, stay miles away. from the world will fade away. the world will fade away. My Son, I want to have you close to me. oh oh my son!"
