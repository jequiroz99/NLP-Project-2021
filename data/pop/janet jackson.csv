I'm in control, never gonna stop. Control, to get what I want. Control, I got to have a lot. Control, now I'm all grown up. First time I fell in love. I didn't know what hit me. So young and so naive. I thought it would be easy. But now I know I've go to take.... Repeat Chorus. That's right, I'm on my own,. I'll call my own shots, thank you. Got my own mind. I wanna make my own decisions. When it has to do with my life, my life. I wanna be the one in control. So let me take you by the hand. And lead you on this dance. Cause what I've got is because I took a chance. I don't wanna rule the world. Just wanna run my life. So make your life a little easier. When you get the chance just take.... Repeat Chorus. Free at last, out here on my own. Now control this. That's right, career moves. I do what's right for me. And me wants to groove. Is that ok?. First time I fell in love. I didn't know what hit me. So young and so naive. I thought it would be easy. But now I know I've go to take.... Hop to it. I'm in control (and I love it, that's right). Control, now I've got a lot. Control, now I'm all grown up. I'm in control, I'm in control"

I love you to death but I ain't. pressed with a heartbreak. And anyway who cares about what. other people talk about. I rather hear it from the horse's mouth. See I believe in, being believed in. No love life for low ties is all paper thin. But watch for the trickery. some people are slippery. They appear making history. disappear like a mystery. It ain't your fault. but you're a walking bank vault. The people of life make life bitter as salt. They say what they want to say. play how they want to play. But you got to live your life day by day. In order to survive you overlook and overcome. selfish attitude or lack of. gratitude from the dumb. It ain't easy being you and. everything you want to be. But whatever you do is alright with me. the bon-diddlely-dee. The overweight lover MC, the cap. the rapper hand clap, foot tap; Heavy D, dee, dee, dee"

You bring cooked food and I bring desert. Uh, and meet up at the place that we always do. The one swimming through my mind. That was always you. Our time together has inspired a song or two. Or three, or four, or more, mi amor. I'm sure, either you're the one. Or I'm caught in the matrix. Staying up for hours while we talk and get wasted. Not from weed smoke, uh, this cheap wine. Drunk off love we both feel deep down. But too scared to say. 'Cause we know how this seems. Thinking, maybe we'd be. Better off friends with benefits. For the moment this adrenaline. Got me feeling like a kid again. Butterflies like Mj, had to fit it in. My schedule, check the bezel. Gotta escape by six. Damn, how'd it get so late so quick?. The sun rising (already?) until the next time. I love diving in your mind. And coming out with every diamond I can find. No sleep, no sleep. We ain't gonna get no sleep.

again,"I heard from a friend today. And she said you were in town. Suddenly the memories came back to me in my mind. How can I be strong I've asked myself. Time and time I've said. That I'll never fall in love with you again. A wounded heart you gave. My soul you took away. Good intentions you had many. I know you did. I come from a place that hurts. And God knows how I cried. And I never want to return. Never fall again. Making love to you. It felt so good and oh so right. How can I be strong I've asked myself. Time and time I've said. That I'll never fall in love with you again. So here we are alone again. Didn't think it'd come to this. And to know it all began. With just a little kiss. I've come to close to happiness. To have it swept away. Don't think I can take the pain. Never fall again. Kinda late in the game. And my heart is in your hands. Don't you stand there and then tell me. You love me then leave again. 'Cause I'm falling in love with you again. Hold me, hold me. Don't ever let me go. Say it just one time. Say you love me. God knows I do love you. Again"

It ain't your fault. but you're a walking bank vault. The people of life make life bitter as salt. They say what they want to say. play how they want to play. But you got to live your life day by day. In order to survive you overlook and overcome. selfish attitude or lack of. gratitude from the dumb. It ain't easy being you and. everything you want to be. But whatever you do is alright with me. the bon-diddlely-dee. The overweight lover MC, the cap. the rapper hand clap, foot tap; Heavy D, dee, dee, dee"

better days,I used to sit and wonder. Would I ever be happy. Life was so bittersweet. So many disappointments. Too many ups and downs for me. When you live a nightmare. It's hard to dream. But sometimes life just isn't fair. So why complain nobody cares. And I don't wanna waste nobody's time. So I'm. I'm 'bout to change my vibe. Today the sun's gonna shine. Cause I made up my mind. That today will be the start of better days. Leavin old shit behind. And move on with my life. The blindfold's off my eyes. And now all I see for me is better days. Afraid of my reflection. Tell me that's not me I see. That's who I wanna be. Stuck somewhere in the middle. On half full or half empty. Waiting for somebody to come and rescue me. Can't let that petty attitude. Start to jade my point of view. Only thing that does is bring me down. So I'm. I'm 'bout to change my vibe. Today the sun's gonna shine. Cause I made up my mind. That today will be the start of better days. Leavin old shit behind. And move on with my life. The blindfold's off my eyes. And now all I see for me is better days. Hurt so many times before. I used to cry but no more. Let it go and life can feel. So good. Stop lying the blues. Can't let that petty attitude. Start to jade my point of view. Only thing that does is bring me down. So I'm. I'm 'bout to change my vibe. Today the sun's gonna shine. Cause I made up my mind. That today will be the start of better days. Leavin old shit behind. And move on with my life. The blindfold's off my eyes

On ways of living such a dangerous life. Time after time you stay away. And I just know that you're telling me lies. Black cat. Nine lives. Short days. Long nights. Livin on the edge. Not afraid to die. Heart beat. Real strong. But not. For long. Better watch your step. Or you're gonna die. You're so together boy. But just at a glance. You'll do anything. If given a chance. Scheming, plannin lies. To get what you need. So full of promises. That you never keep. Don't you tell yourself. That it's okay. Sick and tired of. All of your games. And you want me to stay. Better change. Makes no sense to me. Your crazy ways. Black cat. Nine lives. Short days. Long nights. Livin on the edge. Not afraid to die. Heart beat. Real strong. But not. For long. Better watch your step. Or you're gonna die"
black eagle,(Once you know. You can't not know). Do you know about the black eagle. Let me tell you about the black eagle. Strong and powerful king of the sky. Protecting all things with his watchful eyes. Faithful creature to the most high. What are the visions that he holds. You never know. Unless you've been there. You never know. Unless you've been there. Beautiful soul I haven't met. A spiritual connection I'll never forget. Your precious life. Incredible. Sharing his love that is meant for us all. Come outta the shadows into the light. Free to imagine the future you like. Soaring above all of your boundaries. Yes the day will come. Just remember when you're overwhelmed. Dream and take some time to love yourself. Believe you're free to do whatever you want. No no more room number four. You never know. Unless you've been there. I'm singing this love song to show my support. To the beautiful people who have been ignored. With blind eyes and cold shoulders attacking them. Invisible people they won't let fit in. Let's open our eyes to the true barriers. Stereotypical things are the worst. Stand face to face with the real ugly truth. How would you feel if that was you?. Because every life matters. (We all need to do better). So we all should try. (We all need to do better). A smile. A kind word. Or extending a hand. Helping someone to feel human again. If we never start. It could be you on the other end. You never know. (We all need to do better). You never know. (We all need to do better). You never know. No no. You never know
broken hearts heal,"It was a long long time ago. But I remember it like yesterday. Amazing times while we were growing. Round all the brightest stars the world had seen. We made-up songs to do our chores to. And harmonized while we all did our part. Danced and sang our way through most anything. Always felt safe in each others' love. It was in summer that you left me. The fall and winter never felt so cold. And Lord knows words can never express it. Like feels so empty I miss you much. Painful tears like never before. We can't laugh together till we cry. But our love's ain't no material thing. Inshaallah, see you in the next life. Broken hearts heal. Stronger. Broken hearts last. Longer. Broken hearts heal. Stronger. Ooh ooh ooh. La da da da la la. But our love ain't no material thing. Inshaallah, see you in the next life. It was a long long time ago. But yet it seems just like yesterday. Such amazing times while growing up. Always felt safe in each others' love. It was a long long time ago. The fall and winter felt so cold. But our love ain't no material thing. Inshaallah, see you in the next life. But our love is so much more than just material. Til the next life, inshaallah"

dream street,"And a bus comes in on the Hollywood freeway in the dark. A face catches sight of home, though at this spirited town. Such a beating of the heart and a hope deep down inside. They say the streets are paved with gold. But it sure looks kind of cold outside. . Steppin' on the sidewalk with the stars beneath her feet. Just a handful of tourists, is all she's bound to meet. So tough to find a room and it takes more than a day. And it's not too nice and the price is high. Somehow she can't help but cry. In a world full of fantasies, reality can hurt. It's about the fiction, the odds won't go with her on. . Chorus:. Dream street, dream street. Will it all come true? Will it all just fade away. Dream street, dream street. Well, it's hard to find and. It won't let hope escape from dream street. . A year goes by, and the situation she can't stand. Came to be an actress, but a waitress is all she lands. Her colleague smiles at her through the wrinkles of her face. She came here too, with the self-same goals. She never got out of this place. . She makes her mind up, she's gonna leave that very night. It's been so long now since she's felt that good inside. She calls the service line, there's a message in there for her. She's gotta star in a movie part, suddenly it's all worthwhile. Oh a little bit closer now, but really still too far. Is it always out of reach, that bright and shiny star of. ."

Is it enough. Does it really count. Or am I a fool. So tell me please. Am I wasting my time. . Your phrases. Descriptive. And though the textured words. With beauty. You post it. And use such colored verbes. We've never meet. . Repeat Chorus. . I'm rushin' home. To turn you on. Sometimes you're there. Sometimes you're gone. Wait for hours. For your return. So tell me please. Am I wasting my time. . Your phrases. Descriptive. And though the textured words. With beauty. You post it. And use such colored verbes. So tell me. . You think that. Maybe we're gone insane. To find a, a lover. And thought the words of pain. We never meet. ."

livin' in a world (they didn't make),Children are called the future of an adult world. They are born with spirits so innocent. 'till we teach them how to hate. Add to the world's confusion. We teach our kids rules. That we don't adhere to ourselves. Right or wrong. What example can they take. The people we learn from. Forge the ideas we become. . Chorus:. Living in a world they didn't make. Living in a world that's filled with hate. Living in a world where grown-ups break the rules. Living in a world they didn't make. Paying for a lot of adult mistakes. How much of this madness can they take. Our children. . Children grow to become our young adults. Problems of the world. They must learn how to confront. Doing drugs and joining gangs to rebel. Colors show they belong. To the social override. 'cause they're living in a space. They feel out of place. .
lonely,"Feeling so alone and deserted. With people standing all around you. Should I trust someone. Should I stay off to myself. Alone with no one to talk to. It's such a helpless feeling. . Chorus:. So anytime you feel the need. Call me when you're lonely. Cause everybody needs a friend. To be there when they're lonely. . So don't isolate yourself. Every time that I come around. A person all alone. Is an unhappy one. We need somebody near to love us. Someone who cares. Living life all by yourselves. Impossible to do and I'll be there for you. Anytime you feel the need. Call me when you're lonely. Cause everybody needs a friend. And I'll be yours if you're lonely. (And if you're all alone). If you're all alone. And a friend you need. Like a river flows.

If you're lonely I will be there. ."

the great forever,Not too pleased with what you're diggin'. I'm just busy livin' my life. Sources say but where ya gettin' it. Don't create the truth you like. It might sound strange to you. What you think it don't mean nothing at all. Doesn't change who I am. Doesn't change who I love. Living my life. The way that I hope. Is leading me to. The great forever. Forever I will choose. Watch what I'm doing. Watch where I'm going. Tryin' to get to. The great forever. Forever is the truth. If you wrong would you admit it?. And take the heat up under the lights. Use your expert criticism. Then maybe you could get a life. Don't like seeing people happy. Is it jealousy or personal?. Cause I don't see why loving someone. Or what I do seem so radical to you. Still it might sound strange to you. But what you think it don't mean nothing at all. Doesn't change who I am. Doesn't change who I love. Living my life. The way that I hope. Is leading me to. The great forever. Forever I will choose. Watch what I'm doing. Watch where I'm going. Tryin' to get to. The great forever. Forever is the truth. Once you know why you're here. It becomes crystal clear. To love someone is divine. That empty hole in your heart. It will tear you apart. Because hate will only divide. (Bless you). Hey hey hey hey. Nah nah nah nah nah. Hey. Nah nah. It's sad when you take such a beautiful thing. Blow it up and call it the news. It's not ok still I hope that one day. You'll find the great forever too. (L.U.T.F.A.). Living my life. The way that I hope. Is leading me to. The great forever. Forever I will choose. Watch what I'm doing. Watch where I'm going. Tryin' to get to. The great forever. Forever is the truth
