Only God knows how far it goes. Fist up in the air. Like we don't care. Swinging. (On a road). (Only God knows). (How far it goes). (With my eyes closed). (Got my hair down a wide open road). I'm swinging with my eyes closed. Only God knows how far it goes. Fist up in the air. Like we don't care. Fist up in the air. Like we don't care. Swinging"

raining on our love,"Remember me the way I was. The way I'd make you late for work. I had to hold you, just because. Remember you the way you'd wake me up. To love me once again.

Am I to blame for makin' you that way?. Did I neglect all that mattered?. With my head so far above. The clouds I didn't see. That it was raining on our love. Remember when, just to feel my touch. Was all you ever needed. Oh it used to be enough. Remember when love. Was a promise we would give our lives to keep. And no river ran as deep. But was I chasin' rainbows. Blinded by the sun. And did I take for granted. I'd be the only one?. I didn't know you were so lonely. Am I to blame for makin' you that way?. Did I neglect all that mattered?. With my head so far above. The clouds I didn't see. That it was raining on our love. I was taking all the love you had to give. But I was too lost in life to know. That without my love in return you could not live. Now she gives the love I did not show. I didn't know you were so lonely. Am I to blame for makin' you that way?. Did I neglect all that mattered?. With my head so far above. The clouds I didn't see. That it was raining on our love."
