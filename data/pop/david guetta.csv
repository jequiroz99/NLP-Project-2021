how soon is now,"After tonight, there'll be no coming home soon. No tears of regret, no smell of her perfume. No more dancing feet, to the beats that go boom. While I watch the sunrise all alone in my room. Tonight there'll be no pouring rain. No eyes wide shut to your never ending game. After tonight there'll be no me and you. No distant memories past for me to hold on to. See everybody's working to hold on to what they know. So I guess I kept believe in my tonight will never go.

Strikes up busy bodies suffer the fever. All saints come one you loving the fall. Go my child, look away from it all. (Refr√£o). The Joan of Arc. Kiss in the dark; she's a firestone. Catching all; watch her burn. The Joan of Arc. It's such a shock. Watching her getting out. Let it out. Lips are burning (The Joan of Arc)"

But for what it's worth I'm ready to play. For the rest of my life. For the rest of my life. For the rest of my life. If I got one life to live, I'mma party til I'm dead. What the hell is a life worth living if it's not on the edge. Tryna keep my balance I'm twisted so just in case I fall. Ring on my tomb, don't you say women, weed and alcohol. Got somewhere to go but the world is moving slow. I was born for the fast life. I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford. But for what it's worth I'm ready to play. For the rest of my life.
