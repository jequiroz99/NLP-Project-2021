how soon is now,"After tonight, there'll be no coming home soon. No tears of regret, no smell of her perfume. No more dancing feet, to the beats that go boom. While I watch the sunrise all alone in my room. Tonight there'll be no pouring rain. No eyes wide shut to your never ending game. After tonight there'll be no me and you. No distant memories past for me to hold on to. See everybody's working to hold on to what they know. So I guess I kept believe in my tonight will never go.

So so pretty; cutting her hair. Dark star spirit now she's up in the gutter. Kills her feeling; keep us in here. Come out saint, but she called a healing. Don't say nothing; love in the fall. God saint child; don't you miss of it all. (Refrão). The Joan of Arc. Kiss in the dark; she's a firestone. Catching all; watch her burn. The Joan of Arc. It's such a shock. Watching her getting out. Let it out. Lips are burning (The Joan of Arc). White heart city, jungle in here. Hang low spinning, now she's lost in the mirror. Heart spits ripping, Bruise in the Air. Strikes up busy bodies suffer the fever. All saints come one you loving the fall. Go my child, look away from it all. (Refrão). The Joan of Arc. Kiss in the dark; she's a firestone. Catching all; watch her burn. The Joan of Arc. It's such a shock. Watching her getting out. Let it out. Lips are burning (The Joan of Arc)"
