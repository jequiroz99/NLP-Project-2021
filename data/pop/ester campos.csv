falling,"'I'm holding on. To the thread of love you left behind. It feels so wrong. But sometimes I don't want to be right. I've cried and I've cried. So have you come to stay?. Like sand through my fingers. I feel you slip away. I've fallen in love. I've fallen. I've fallen in love. I've fallen. And I just keep on falling. Keep on falling. Keep on falling in love. I've fallen in love. I've fallen. Fallen, oh I've fallen. And I just keep on falling. Keep on falling. Keep on falling in love. I've fallen in love. I've fallen. I should be strong. Nothing else seems to make sense at all. Should I move on?. Is there something to be fighting for?. I've tried and I've tried. To walk away from you. But try as I might. You'll always see me through. I've fallen in love. I've fallen. I've fallen in love. I've fallen. And I just keep on falling. Keep on falling. Keep on falling in love. I've fallen in love. I've fallen"
'gotta be mine,"Someday there'll be turning back. You'll notice your regret. You won't forget. Your pride took you from me. I was right when I became pissed. When I surrounded you, when I didn't leave. And I controlled every day. And I watched just in case. I've been honest and brave. I made you feel you were my last. I erased your past. I'm not crazy and I hated not being there. And I even cried pretending not to be lying. And I burned letters. That I didn't write. I didn't fail, I forbade. I tore up pictures, broke gifts. And I thought you don't deserve generosity from me. But tonight. There's a chance to forget. Just turn around, come back. And make me feel pity and lock you in my bed. I could burn you with my gaze. I could kill you with my words. So tonight you've gotta be mine. Now you're locked kid. I'm your owner. And don't touch me. In my game, this is my game. I give you a chance to be my surrender. If you understand please don't fight. You know I pretend but don't let me standing. Oh don't steal in my game, please don't cry. And be mine. Now you're locked kid. I'm your owner. And don't touch me. In my game, this is my game"
keep moving (dj lyla feat. ester campos),"Not too dark to see. your face is poetry. what bout you and me. propel the ancient mystery. act on your advice. motion of fresh delight. promise a gentle bite. no rest all through the night. cross my heart and hope to die. stick a needle in my eye. break no promise, tell no lie. free your mind it's paradise. Keep moving, don't stop dancing. Move to the beat in your heart. Keep moving, don't stop dancing. we're on our way to the top. strike a pressing pose. none will get this close. taste your sweaty clothes. surely now anything goes. rhythm of sweet caress. the wicked don't have to rest. time now to impress. flaunt it: oblige your noblesse. cross my heart and hope to die. stick a needle in my eye. break no promise, tell no lie. free your mind it's paridade. Keep moving, don't stop dancing. Move to the beat in your heart. Keep moving, don't stop dancing. we're on our way to the top"
warrior,A lot of voices telling me what to do. Some of them are meaningful. But I never down a medicine in one. This is life and I've got to make it as me. You don't know what I can be. I can train myself into anything I want. And when the world is getting challenging. Rocks are moving from everywhere in. I don't care I can count on what's within. A warrior is living right under my skin. A warrior is living right under my skin. Wherever I am going he's going. When I can't hold on he's holding. A warrior is living right under my skin. When I drive myself up against a wall. Feeling sad and uncomfortable. Something inside me wants to move on. Life ain't always just floating on air. Sometimes I crawl on the floor in despair. And I think I can never get back on my feet again. But when the doubt is heavier than my will. It seems the world is closing in. I don't care I can count on what's within. A warrior is living right under my skin. A warrior is living right under my skin. Wherever I am going he's going. When I can't hold on he's holding. A warrior is living right under my skin. He is trying when I am tired. Fighting when I surrender. The warrior inside of me. A warrior is living right under my skin. A warrior is living right under my skin. Wherever I am going he's going. When I can't hold on he's holding. A warrior is living right under my skin. A warrior is living right under my skin
