miss you more,"I finally took your pictures off the wall,. It didn't even help at all, you're simply too beautiful.. Got you frozen in a frame inside my mind,.

Do you even know what you do to me?. How I'm drowning in your memories,. So hard to breathe now that you're gone.. Do you know it rips out the heart in me. Every time I wake up here alone,. How can I move on when all I do is miss you more. And more, every day I miss you more and more.. I know that I should walk away and close the door,. But how is that possible when you're so beautiful?. And the fire in my heart it burns so bright,. If I don't get you back tonight the flames are gonna touch the sky.. They say that time will take this pain away,. Time will heal these scars you made,. Time will give me back my heart again.. Do you even know what you do to me?. How I'm drowning in your memories,.

And more, every day I miss you more and more.. I hate the way I miss you, I wish that I could kiss you.. The way that crazy issues, they keep popping up like tissues,. One after the next, life is so complex.. Used to wait up for your text, now I drive what happens next.. Damn, I don't understand, I thought I was your man,. Now I messed up all the plans.. I be lying if I said I wasn't crying. Miss you more, but I'm trying to miss you less, cause I'm dying.. You don't even know what you do to me. How I'm drowning in your memories,. So hard to breathe now that you're gone.. You don't know it rips out the heart in me. Every time I wake up here alone,. How can I move on when all I do is miss you more. And more, every day I miss you more and more.. Cause every day I miss you more."

You said you'd never ever try to break my heart,. You told a lie, you tore my love apart.. You said you always wanted someone just like me,. You let me down, baby you set me free.. Whether it's wrong or whether it's right,. Won't take me through the night.. You told me that you loved me so,. And you'd never let me go.. You played the game you're not the same,. I never thought you'd ever change,. But if it's got to be this way,. I'm never gonna fall in love!. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love.. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love.. Break One. When I heard this crazy stuff about this other guy,. I didn't believe it had to see it with my eyes.. When I saw you and him, you passed me by,. He's not your friend, he's the other guy.. Whether it's wrong or whether it's right,. Won't take me through the night.. You told me that you loved me so,. And you'd never let me go.. You played the game you're not the same,. I never thought you'd ever change.. But if it's got to be this way,. I'm never gonna fall on love!. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love.. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love.. Break Two. I'm never gonna fall, 'cause I fell,. Lovin' you for me was like hell.. How could you play me like a champ,. A tramp, a cramp?. Girl you did me worse than a food stamp.. You told me I could trust you,. If I didn't I would crush you.. Never thought that one day I'd bust you,. Walkin' in the sand hand and hand with another man.. I know your game plan and now I understand.. Love is so deep, it's like sleep,. It will leave you blind.. I see how you're livin' so baby next time,. Whatcha gonna do now that the table's are truned around?. I'm livin' swell and now you wanna be down?. Step off, 'cause baby I've learned,. If you're messin' with fire then you're gonna get burned.. You still look dope but a dope I'm not,. I can't get with you 'cause you're too hot.. Whether it's wrong or whether it's right,. Won't take me through the night.. You told me that you loved me so,. And you'd never let me go.. You played the game you're not the same,. I never thought you'd ever change.. But if it's got to be this way,. I'm never gonna fall on love!. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love.. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love.. Never gonna fall,. I'm never gonna fall,. never, never, never. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love.. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love again,. Never gonna fall in love.."
never let you go,"Chorus:. Close your eyes. Realize. It's you and I. Take my hand. Understand. That I'm your man. If loving you is right I can't go wrong. Girl, we've known each other for so long. Chemistry between us has grown strong. You are the one and only meaning to this song. God's gift to man is what you are. You make me feel there's no such thing as too far. Forever's just enough time to show you girl. That I'm not acting like I know. I'll never let you go. Chorus. I will never let you. Think that I am someone that I'm not. You're down for me. I'm holding on to what I've got. First impressions work I've always found. Being with you I know my heart's on solid ground. People say we can't. I know we can. Can't stop it anyway so take my hand. Let's make this something special. I want this to grow. Because of the loyalty you show. I'll never let you go. Chorus. For too long I've known. And far too strong I've grown attached to you. Just call me your own. Everywhere people breaking up. That won't happen to us. Because we were friends before lovers. . I'll never let you down girl. Never gonna let you go. Never gonna let you go, oh no. . Rap:. It feels good to see your face. Come have a seat. Sit by the fireplace and. I'll massage your shoulders if they hurt. I can tell by your eyes, a hard day at work. God's gift to man. Though some might say that. We're too young to understand. But I've got a firm grip on reality. And you and me is right where I wanna be.... Wrapped in your arms. And you in mine. A love like this is really hard to find. So I won't front and try to play love games. I'll always be the same, won't a damn thing change. You hear me talking?. Trust what I'm about--love and understanding. Won't play each other out. You got a feeling that I'm doing you low?. Girl it's not so"

Second day we were there, we were walking down the street. With a rhyme in mind and a funky beat. . But when we turned into the alley, to our surprise. We saw a bunch of hoods right before our eyes. They looked us up and down once, twice and again. There must have been a hundred to a hundred and ten. So, I looked over my shoulder right at my friend. He said 'Nice knowing you' but this is the end. . So we battened down the hatches and prepared to fight. Then all of a sudden I seen the light. The time was right, the time to rock. 'Cause everybody knows, we're The New Kids On The Block.. . We're also devistating when we're on stage. The fans start screaming and yelling with rage. With mic's in hand and rhymes with clout. So watch it sucker MCs or we're gonna turn you out. . We never talk trash, our rhymes are clean. Our rhymes are never vague and we say nothing obscene. So any sucker MCs who wanna battle us.

the christmas song (chesnuts roasting on a open fire),"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your nose.. Yuletide carols being sung by a choir and folks dressed up like Eskimos.. Everybody knows, a turkey and some mistletoe help to make the season bright.. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow will find it hard to sleep tonight.. They know that Santa's on his way.. He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh.. And every mother's child is gonna spy to see if reindeer really know how to fly.. And so I'm offering this simple phrase to kids from 1 to 92. Although it's been said many times, many ways: Merry Christmas to you."
