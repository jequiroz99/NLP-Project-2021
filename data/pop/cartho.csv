devil looks so hot,I know. What you hide underneath your eyes. I know. Your body can start a fire. I know. When you're lying to me. And I know. You think I believe. There's blood in your hands. Lost words on your lips. The way you walk through the door. Without your clothes for me. There's an ocean in your eyes. Your curves are a paradise. But all this beauty can kill me tonight. Burn me with your fire. When you smile ignite my thoughts. They can judge me by my desire. But the devil looks so hot. Lock me in your prison. And whisper to me '' you got caught ''. Maybe this is an illusion. But the devil looks so hot. I know. What we had was a lie. And it's not worth. Fighting a losing fight. I know. You're some kind of psychopath. But I like the way you lick all my body. With your hands on my hair. There's blood in your hands. Lost words on your lips. The way you walk through the door. Without your clothes for me. There's an ocean in your eyes. Your curves are a paradise. But all this beauty can kill me tonight. Burn me with your fire. When you smile ignite my thoughts. They can judge me by my desire. But the devil looks so hot. Lock me in your prison. And whisper to me '' you got caught ''. Maybe this is an illusion. But the devil looks so hot. You take me to hell. You cast me your spell. I think I'm not feeling very well. Baby you're taking me to hell. Burn me with your fire. When you smile ignite my thoughts. They can judge me by my desire. But the devil looks so hot. Lock me in your prison. And whisper to me '' you got caught ''. Maybe this is an illusion. But the devil looks so hot. Looks so hot tonight
