Now it's all in my head yeah, yeah(4x). You know it's not my style. To start a fight and make a scene. But I'm different this time. I am not a drama fiend no. And maybe it's just me. But this is how I feel. And this can't simply be. Another case of jealousy. Chorus. I mean we can talk it out. Pretend that it's alright. But alright just won't do anymore. I mean we can kiss and make up. Pretend that it's enough. But enough just won't do anymore. Maybe it's all in my head,. Feel like leaving. But I don't really want to. But I feel so misled,. A kiss through the phone just won't do. chorus"
