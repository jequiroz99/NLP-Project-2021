That it couldn't be me and be her in between. Whithout you, whithout you. Whithout you, whithout you. by thiago venuto"

In your daddy's arms. Pulling out the papers. From the drawers that slide smooth. Tugging at the darkness. Word upon word. Confessing all the secret things. In the warm velvet box. To the priest-he's the doctor. He can handle the shocks. Dreaming of the tenderness. The tremble in the hips. Of kissing mary's lips. Dreaming of mercy street. Wear your insides out. Dreaming of mercy. In your daddy's arms again. Dreaming of mercy street. Swear they moved that sign. Looking for mercy. In yours daddy's arms. Anne, with her father. Is out in the boat. Riding the water. Riding the waves on the sea. . by thiago venuto"

sweet child o' mine,She's got a smile that it seems to me. Reminds me of childhood memories. Where everything. Was as fresh as the bright blue sky. Now and then when I see her face. She takes me away to that special place. And if I stared too long. I'd probably break down and cry. Sweet child o' mine. Sweet love of mine. She's got eyes of the bluest skies. As if they thought of rain. I hate to look into those eyes. And see an ounce of pain. Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place. Where as a child I'd hide. And pray for the thunder. And the rain. To quietly pass me by. ohh... Sweet child o' mine. oh oh oh.. Sweet love of mine. Where do we go. Where do we go now. Where do we go. Sweet child o' mine
