He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe. And washed up next to me. He said you look naughty. But I'm sure you're nice. He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile. With a present in his hand. He said it's Christmas in the sand. I must have had too much to drink. Cause Rudolph's nose was shining green. I think. He was playing reindeer games on me. Santa only called him once.

On your Chest. We'll im stalling to open my eyes. 'Cause I know its time for me to leave this bed. But I've decided to fall back inside my head. I close my eyes. And try to lie. But when.

every day is christmas (feat jason reeves),"January always brought me down. All the magic of December. Is like a circus leaving town. All I wanna do is to follow it around.

And I don't need the snow to fall. And I don't need the light to shine. And I don't need a mistletoe. Cause I'll still kiss you all the time. We don't have to take a sleigh ride. For our hearts to race inside. And I still get as excited. When we go to sleep at night. Every day is Christmas as long as. Every day you are mine. Spring is coming but the air is chilled. It remind me of the winter fires we would always build. Hiding from the cold is always warmer in your arms. Whenever you are kissing me, it is Chrismas in my heart. I don't need the snow to fall. And I don't need the light to shine. And I don't need a mistletoe. Cause I'll still kiss you all the time. We don't have to take a sleigh ride. For our hearts to race inside.

like yesterday,"I remember like yesterday I. Carried a heart without hope. Had given up on mystery I. Only saw mirrors and smoke. Thought I was fine alone. That's just because I didn't know. I remember like yesterday. Lovin' you seemed far away. We were friends in different places. Then love began leavin' traces. Sitting with you on a crowded bus. It seemed like just the two of us. That night everything was changed. I remember like yesterday. I was livin' in black and white a. Careful and colorless life. You are like a neon light. Shined through my closed my eyes. All the right ones, they turned out wrong. But you were here all along. I remember like yesterday. Lovin' you seemed far away. We were friends in different places. Then love began leavin' traces. Little folded up love letters. Sweet songs written for each other. Everything was about to changed. I remember like yesterday. You came just in time for me. You changed my mind so easily. Now it's you and me. I remember like yesterday. Lovin' you seemed far away. We were friends in different places. Then love began leavin' traces. With a first time I love you. On a Paris afternoon. And now everything has changed. I remember like yesterday. I remember like yesterday. Lovin' you seemed far away. Thought I could live without you. So glad I finally found you. On the street in the pouring rain. Our hearts both found their ways. I love how everything changed. I remember 'cause it's today. (On a stairway in the park. In the starlight after dark. Sweet kisses in the pouring rain). Crédito: kath goncalves"

I'd be coming back for more. Only you can keep me falling like a summer rain. Get me so hot to cool me off again. Only you can send me flying like a meteorite. Blazing through the haze into the sky blue eyes. Only you, only you. Only you, only you. I really adore the way you adore the way that we dance. Before on the floor like every night is Saturday night. You take me to town, you're shaking me down. I can't even tell there's no one around. Candles our city lights. You pick me up and you drink me up. You take with no [?] aligned. Only you can keep me falling like a summer rain. Get me so hot to cool me off again. Only you can send me flying like a meteorite. Blazing through the haze into the sky blue eyes. Only you, only you. Only you, only you. Only you, only you. Only you, only you. Can make me believe I'm the queen of your heart. Shine like a diamond, and burn like a star. Wherever I am, wherever you are. I know that I'll always love only you, only you, only you. Only you, only you, only you. Only you can keep me falling like a summer rain. Get me so hot to cool me off again. Only you can send me flying like a meteorite. Blazing through the haze into the sky blue eyes. Only you, only you. Only you, only you. I'm kinda obsessed with how you're obsessed. With making me feel like nobody else. 'Cause nobody makes me feel like you do"
out of my mind,"You called me on the phone today. Said those words you always say. And I cried. I've gotta figure out what's going on inside this head of mine. But I've tried. Going crazy thinking 'bout the way I shouldn't have left it all behind. But now I'm gone and something's wrong. I changed my mind. I'm so in love with you,. I don't know what to do, this time. And though you're out of sight, you're never ever out of my mind.. I saw you just the other day, those feelings never went away. And I smiled. I told you I'll be back and I want us to be friends and be alright.. Don't know what to say, it's getting harder everyday but it takes time. You should know, I'm coming home, stand by.... I'm so in love with you,. I don't know what to do this time. And though you're out of sight, you're never ever out of my mind. And as the time passes by, I fall asleep without you by my side. I go out of my mind, remembering the way we were... before. I'm so in love with you,. I don't know what to do, this time. And though you're out of sight, you're never ever out of my mind. I'm so in love with you,. I don't know what to do, this time.... By Maiara Barreto"
oxygen,"I came a part inside a world. Made of angry people. I found a boy. Who had a dream of making everyone smile. He was sunshine. I fell over. My feet like bricks underwater. and How am I supposed to tell you how I feel?. I need oxygen. Oh baby, if I was your lady. I would make you happy. I'm never gonna leave, never gonna leave. Oh baby, I would be your lady. I am going crazy for you. And so I found a state of mind. Where I could be speechless. I had to try for a while. To figure out this feeling. This felt so right. Pull me upside. Down to a place where you've been waiting. and How am I supposed to tell you how I feel?. I need oxygen. Oh baby, if I was your lady. I would make you happy. I'm never gonna leave, never gonna leave. Oh baby, I would be your lady. I am going crazy for you. And you don't wanna keep me waiting. Staring at my fingers. Feeling like a fool. Oh baby, I would be your lady. I will make you happy. I'm never gonna leave, never gonna leave. Oh baby, I would be your lady. I am going crazy. Tell me what you want. Baby, Tell me what you need. Anything I ask, baby give it to me. Baby give it to me, give it to me. I came a part inside a world. Made of angry people. I found a boy. Who had a dream of making everyone smile"
paint it golden,Run away from money. Quit your job and climb a tree. One with hearts instead of leaves. Build a sand castle. Big enough for us to sleep. Paint it golden with the sunrise. Cause we are like a wingless bird. Crashing down to the helpless earth. And something’s gonna break. Cause I see it all around. And I feel it in my body. We are hiding in the shadows. Where love is still alive. Until all of it is burning. In this field we’re walkin. Empty as the open sky. We’ve escaped from all the troubles. Found a waterfall and. Took a dive to cool out skin. Finally we found this feelin. Cause we are like a wingless bird. Crashing down to the helpless earth. And something’s gonna break. Cause I see it all around. And I feel it in my body. We are hiding in the shadows. Where love is still alive. Until all of it is burning. All the colors changing. All alone right now and we’re. Painted golden with the sunrise………
permanent,"you loved it so much in the city. you know i could not stand it there. you liked to get lost in the people. and pretend that they really care. well you know you're such a bad impostor. hiding your wings beneath your coat. cause i watched your footprints making patterns. away from me into the snow. now i don't believe in nothing anymore. cause love is permanent not temporary. and it's driven straight into our chests, then buried. much too deep to just pull out like weeds in a garden. it's permanent, im sorry... so lately i've been going crazy. trying to get you off my mind. cause thoughts of you hang just like pictures. and gather dust over the time. well we hung them up just like real lovers. and drove our nails into the wall. cause we thought they'd be there forever. but we weren't permanent at all... and it's getting much too hard to see you now. CHORUS"
"please, please stay","I always feel like this, everytime you pass by. With your amazing smile. And everytime you go, you can see in my eyes. I'm not the same kinda girl. All our friends are coming here tonight. And everybody's asking me if you'll be there to dance with me. Chorus:. There will be music everywhere. A little bit of wine and everyone you know. They'll be having fun I know. So please, please, please…. There will be music everywhere. Hang the colored lights and sing some reggae songs. We'll be having fun I know. So please, please stay. I keep some funny pictures, of you at the beach. Where we just waste our time. It's always better when you're around. And if you don't mind please change your mind. So we could be together and take our time, tonight…. All our friends are on their way. And everybody you will see, will be almost as happy as me. Chorus. I don't wanna see you walk away. I don't wanna see you leave today. So come along and take my hand. Come along along along and join the band. All our friends are coming here tonight. And everybody's asking me if you'll be there to dance with me. Chorus 2x"

the way i was,I woke up on the wrong side of the railroad tracks. Stumbled on last night. The last train that ran from Georgia. To the shores of California. Has long been outta line. And even though [?]. And the darkness still stands still. We run. Dawn breaks and then it burns. Cause in the morning I have learned. Just what we've done. Just what we've done. When the whistle blows. And the church bell tolls. Please remember me that way I was. When the crows fly south. And the preacher shouts. I hope you remember me. The way I was. The way I was. I hope you remember me. The way I was. I lost myself to find my way. Down this trail of tears. It gets muddier each day. I crossed that bridge when it came to it. Now I barely recognize the stranger in my face. The colder wind carries by. And the memories we hold tight. Start to burn. Now I'm only afraid. The last picture will fully fade fade. Of how we were. Of how we were. When the whistle blows. And the church bell tolls. Please remember me that way I was. When the crows fly south. And the preacher shouts. I hope you remember me. The way I was. The way I was. I hope you remember me. The way I was. The colder wind carries by. And the memories we hold tight. Start to burn. Now I'm only afraid. The last picture will fully fade. Of how we were.

The way I was. The way I was. I hope you remember me. The way I was. Please remember me. Please remember me. Please remember me the way I was

turn your lights down low,"Turn your lights down low. And pull your window curtain. Oh let the moon come shining in. Into our life again. Saying ooh, it´s been a long, long time.

And every chorus was written for us to recite. Every beautiful melody of devotion every night. It´s potion like this ocean that might carry me. In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me. And every word, every second, and every third. Expresses the happiness more clearly than ever heard. And when I play them, every chord is a poem Telling. the Lord how grateful I am cause I know him. The harmonies possess a sensation similar to your. caress. If you´re asking then I´m telling you it´s yes. Stand in love, take my hand in love, God bless. I want to give you some good, good loving. I want to give you some love. I want to give you some good, good loving. Oh I, oh I, oh I. I wanna give you some good, good loving. Good, good, good loving. (I wanna give you some good loving)"

what means the most,"The other day when someone asked me. ""are you living your dream""?. I didn't know what to say. I honestly had to think. I try to be so many places at the same time. Everyday a million things cluttering up my mind. Another feather falling off my wings. I climb so high, it gets hard to breathe. Forget to remember. What I really need. What means the most to me. Is waking up next to you. Feel the morning breeze. You're my favorite thing and I love. Coming home, to your arms. When you kiss me hello. It's these simple things. That mean the most to me. That mean the most to me. Every time I have to leave. I feel like I. Am leaving a part of me. You're the only place I wanna be. Well nothing else matters I just lose focus. When you're not around, you're still the only one I notice. I can't help the way I feel. It doesn't matter if I win or lose, cause. What means the most to me. Is waking up next to you. When you're holding me. And have a little time to play. In your arms, race your heart, laugh 'til it gets dark. It's these simple things that mean the most to me. No more days far away where I miss you. No more nights trying to fall asleep with out you. From now on I'm always gonna be there. I won't miss another day that we won't share. I'll be there. 'cause you mean the most to me. Oh you mean the most to me. And now that I'm here with you. I will stay, by your side, I won't leave you this time. The next time that someone asks me ""are you living your dream"". I guess I'll know what to say. I won't even have to think"
when the darkness comes,"Underneath the echoes. Buried in the shadows. There you were. Drawn into your mystery. I was just beginning. To see your ghost. But you must know. I'll be waiting. Hoping, praying that. This light will guide you home. When you feeling lost. I'll leave my love. Hidden in the sun. For when the darkness comes. Now the door is open. The world I knew is broken. There's no return. Now my heart is not scared. Just knowing that you're out there. Watching me. So believe. I'll be waiting. Hoping, praying that. This light will guide you home. When your felling lost. I'll leave my love. Hidden in the sun. For when the darkness comes. For when the darkness comes. Be here waiting. Hoping, praying that. This light will guide you home. When your feeling lost. I'll leave my love. Hidden in the sun. For when the darkness comes. Hidden in the sun. For when the darkness comes"
winter wonderland,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening. In the lane, snow is glistenin'. A beautiful sight. We're happy tonight. Walking in a winter wonderland. Gone away is the bluebird. Here to stay is a new bird. He sings a love song. As we go along. Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman. Then pretend that he is Parson Brown. He'll say: Are you married?. We'll say: No man. But you can do the job. When you're in town. Later on, we'll conspire. As we dream by the fire. To face unafraid. The plans that we've made.

you,"Turn down the silence. Inside my head. Bring back the colours. Were you insane?. Further from where I've started. Further to go. Keeping my heart under control. Why do I still feel you? Feel you?. And all you've got. I still feel you, feel you. All I need is you. All I need is to feel you, feel you. Why did you change your mind and run away?. Thoughts of you by my side. Are starting to fade. I know that you should be mine. So I won't let go. Everyday I'm trying to get close. Why do I still feel you? Feel you?. And all you got. I still feel you, feel you?. All I need is you. All I need is to feel you, feel you. Stop running all the time. Don't fight the feeling inside. Cause when you try it hard. Don't matter where you go it's deep in your soul"
