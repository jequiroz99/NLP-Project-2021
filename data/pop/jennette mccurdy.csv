I like that when I look into your eyes I see into your soul. I love -- I mean like like -- when you wrote. My name in the foggy cab window. I love -- I mean like like -- when we split those nachos. I usually hate being hugged. But when it comes to you I love. I mean I like like -- everything about those. I liked our night out on the town. And sure, I may have danced around.

so far away (cover),"Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?. It would be so fine to see your face at my door. Doesn't help to know that you're just time away. Long ago I reached for you, and there you stood. Holding you again could only do me good. How I wish I could, but you're so far away. One more song about moving along the highway. Can't say much of anything that's new. If I could only work this life out my way. I'd rather spend it being close to you. But you're so far away. Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?. It would be so fine to see your face at my door. Doesn't help to know you're so far away. Yeah, you're so far away. Traveling around sure gets me down and lonely. Nothing else to do but close my mind. I sure hope the road don't come to own me. There are so many dreams I have yet to find. But you're so far away. Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?. It would be so fine to see your face at my door. And it doesn't help to know you're so far away. You're so far away. Yeah, you're so far away"

I remember how I used to swing from a rope. One that sat on the hills just above Jackson's Cove. Sometimes I close my eyes. And just go back to that little girl. I wanna run. I wanna fall. I wanna take every chance that's given to me. Live this life like I've got nothing to hide. Free and wild. With the heart of a child. With the heart of a child. Try to be everything to everybody but you. But the truth is you ain't got nothing to prove. You only get one chance. Only one trip around this world and. I wanna run. I wanna fall. I wanna take every chance that's given to me. Live this life like I've got nothing to hide. Free and wild. With the heart of a child. With the heart of a child. I wanna chase down a dream. With nothing to break my fall. Just risk it all. And have no regrets. And never forget. To run. And fall. I wanna take every chance that's given to me. And live this life like I've got nothing to hide. Free and wild. With a smile. And the heart of a child. And the heart of a child"

All dressed up the day we said our vows. You can’t tell it here but it was hot that June. That rose was red and her eyes were blue. And just look at that smile I was so proud. That’s the story of my life. Right there in black and white. And if it looks like we were scared to death. Like a couple of kids just trying to save each other. You should have seen it in color.

game of love,"It's a crowded room. It's a busy party. She looks great in red. He steels himself. And he regrets not wearing. Sunday's best instead. But he plays it cool. And he wins her over. With his charm. And she is sure. That by the next month. She will be on his arm. She's a little too sure. She don't know what to do when he ignores her. . It's the game, game, game, of love, love, love. Just when you think you get one step above. You get kicked right to the bottom. And just when you think you've caught him. With your sarcasm, the way you dress. The way you act like you could not care less. You get surprised when he don't call you. But surprise should not befall you. Because you're just another player. In the game of love. He's at a bar. He's with his friends. He likes the waitress. He waves his hand. And says “Excuse me,. can you please help me, Miss?”. He gets her number. But he's dumber. Than he thought. ‘Cause he was so serious. And into it. But she's not. It's a crying shame. That his friends they didn't tell him who's to blame. ‘Cause it's the game, game, game, of love, love, love. Just when you think you get one step above. You get sucked into the water. And just when he thinks he's caught her. With his thought out jokes, his sideswept hair. The way he makes her think he really cares. He acts shocked when she don't call him.

Just when I thought I got one step above. I got kicked right to the bottom. And just when I thought I caught him. With my sarcasm, the way I dress. The way I act like I could not care less. I got surprised when he didn't call me. But surprise should not befall me. Because I'm just another player. In the game of love. Player in the game of love"

heart of a child,"Well, I feel like the time's just slipping away. And it seems that the road gets rougher each day. Sometimes I get caught up. With little things that just don't matter. I remember how I used to swing from a rope. One that sat on the hills just above Jackson's Cove. Sometimes I close my eyes. And just go back to that little girl. I wanna run. I wanna fall. I wanna take every chance that's given to me. Live this life like I've got nothing to hide. Free and wild. With the heart of a child. With the heart of a child. Try to be everything to everybody but you. But the truth is you ain't got nothing to prove. You only get one chance. Only one trip around this world and. I wanna run. I wanna fall. I wanna take every chance that's given to me. Live this life like I've got nothing to hide. Free and wild. With the heart of a child. With the heart of a child. I wanna chase down a dream. With nothing to break my fall. Just risk it all. And have no regrets. And never forget. To run. And fall. I wanna take every chance that's given to me. And live this life like I've got nothing to hide. Free and wild. With a smile. And the heart of a child. And the heart of a child"

I like your ideas I like your dreams. I like the way you walk the way you talk. the way you wear your clothes. I like like your raspy voice. I like like your hats of choice. I like that when I look into your eyes I see into your soul. I love -- I mean like like -- when you wrote. My name in the foggy cab window. I love -- I mean like like -- when we split those nachos. I usually hate being hugged. But when it comes to you I love. I mean I like like -- everything about those. I liked our night out on the town. And sure, I may have danced around. But dancing with you was the only time time froze. I'm falling in like like. Falling in like like. Falling in like like with you. You took me by the heart. Swept me right away.

so close,"So Close - Jennette Mccurdy. Just keep tuggin, pushin, pullin. On my little heartstrings. Got me all tied up in knots. Anytime I see your face. Oh it brings out. It brings out the girl in me. Dont know just how ya did it. But ya got me real good. Hook, line and sinker. Like I knew you could. But you don't even notice. Boy I wish you would. I can't help myself. I can't help but smile. Everytime I see your face. And we've never met. I bet you don't know my name. Am I outta my mind. I think that I might be goin crazy. Coz my heart is yours to have and hold or break. How'd you get to be so close. When you're so far away. . I think you might be close to perfect. Girls you know what I mean. He's got a face straight out. Of a magazine. Gotta pinch myself. To prove he aint a dream. Oh oh oh. I can't help myself. Now my secrets out. I can't help but smile. Everytime I see your face. And we've never met. I bet you don't know my name. Am I outta my mind. I think that I might be goin crazy. Coz my heart is yours to have and hold or break. How'd you get to be so close.

so far away (cover),"Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?. It would be so fine to see your face at my door. Doesn't help to know that you're just time away. Long ago I reached for you, and there you stood. Holding you again could only do me good. How I wish I could, but you're so far away. One more song about moving along the highway. Can't say much of anything that's new. If I could only work this life out my way. I'd rather spend it being close to you. But you're so far away. Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?. It would be so fine to see your face at my door. Doesn't help to know you're so far away. Yeah, you're so far away. Traveling around sure gets me down and lonely. Nothing else to do but close my mind. I sure hope the road don't come to own me. There are so many dreams I have yet to find. But you're so far away. Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?. It would be so fine to see your face at my door. And it doesn't help to know you're so far away. You're so far away. Yeah, you're so far away"
stronger,"You feel out of breath, used up and broken down. Just like shattered glass in pieces on the ground. Somedays you wanna scream, but you can't make a sound. But you're not alone. Here comes another day, here comes another fight. You'd rather give it up than give it one more try. 'Cause no one understands the way you feel inside. But you're not alone. Right now it feels like the end of the world. All your battles are lost. You've been cheated (mistreated). Just when you think that you can't hold on any longer. Hold on a little bit longer. Trust me, you'll see. You'll be so much stronger. (You'll be so much stronger). It's only temporary, but it feels like you're stuck. Like no wishing well, but it will chance your luck. They say when one door closes another opens up. And you walk right through. Yeah, you know what to do. Right now it feels like the end of the world. All your battles are lost. You've been cheated (mistreated). Just when you think that you can't hold on any longer. Hold on a little bit longer. Trust me, you'll see. You'll be so much stronger. (You'll be so much stronger). You'll might have to bend but you're not gonna break. Wipe the tears from your face and the fear off your face. You know deep down inside, you've got what it takes. Right now it feels like the end of the world. All your battles are lost. You've been cheated (mistreated). Just when you think that you can't hold on any longer. Hold on a little bit longer. Trust me, you'll see. You'll be so much stronger. (You'll be so much stronger)"

take it all (adele cover),"Didn't I give it all?. Tried my best. Gave you everything I had. Everything and no less. Didn't I do it right?. Did I let you down?. Maybe you got too used to. Having me around. Still, how can you walk away. From all my tears?. It's gonna be an empty road. Without me right here. But go on and take it. Take it all with you. Don't look back. At this crumbling fool. Just take it all. With my love. Take it all. With my love. Maybe I should leave. To help you see. Nothing is better than this. And this is everything we need. So is it over?.

the summer song,"I hear the tide just out side by my window. Run out the door, hoppin'. Passin' your seat. Now we're gone!. Just blastin' our favorite songs!. Windows all down. Not a cloud in the sky. Hangin' with friends in a hot July. and I sing. This what leaving means!. Summer's finally here,. It's the perfect time of year. Singin' Yeh Yeh Yeh!!. Soakin' up the sun. Tryin' to have a little fun. Singin' Yeh Yeh Yeh!. Yeh Yeh Yeh Yeh!. Jumed out of the Jeep. When we get to the beach,. Run to the shore. Feel the sand on our feet. It's so nice. Just living underneath the sunshine. Yeh, ain't this the life!. Summer's finally here,. It's the perfect time of year. Singin' Yeh Yeh Yeh!!. Soakin' up the sun. Tryin' to have a little fun. Singin' Yeh Yeh Yeh!. Yeh Yeh Yeh Yeh!. I don't think I've ever felt so alive. There's nothing quite like. Summer time!. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!. Summer's finally here,. It's the perfect time of year.

unconditionally (cover katy perry),"Oh, no, did I get too close?. Oh, did I almost see. What? s really on the inside?. All your insecurities. All the dirty laundry. Never made me blink one time. Unconditional, unconditionally. I will love you unconditionally. There is no fear now. Let go and just be free. I will love you unconditionally. Come just as you are to me. Don? t need apologies. Know that you are worthy. I'll take your bad days with your good. Walk through this storm, I would. I? d do it all because I love you, I love you. Unconditional, unconditionally. I will love you unconditionally. There is no fear now. Let go and just be free. I will love you unconditionally"
what hurts the most (cover: rascal flatts),"I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house, that don't bother me. I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out. I'm not afraid to cry. Every once in a while even though goin on with you gone still upsets me. There are days. Every now and again I pretend I'm okay but that's not what gets me. What hurts the most, was being so close. And having so much to say. And watchin you walk away. Never knowing, what could have been. And not seein that lovin you. Is what I was tryin to do. It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go. But I'm doin it. It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone. Still harder gettin up, gettin dressed, livin with this regret. But I know if I could do it over. I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart that i left unspoken. What hurts the most, is being so close. And having so much to say. And watchin you walk away. Never knowing, what could have been. And not seein that lovin you. Is what I was tryin to do. What hurts the most, was being so close. And having so much to say. And watchin you walk away. And never knowing, what could have been. And not seein that lovin you. Is what I was tryin to do. Not seein that lovin you. that's what I was tryin to do"

you've got a friend (cover),"When you're down and troubled. And you need help and hand. And nothing, whoa nothing is going right.. Close your eyes and think of me. And soon I will be there. To brighten up even your darkest nights.. (Chorus). You just call out my name,. And you know wherever I am. I'll come running. To see you again.. Winter, spring, summer, or fall,. All you got to do is call. And I'll be there, yes I'll be there. You've got a friend.. If the sky above you. Should turn dark and full of clouds. And that old north wind should begin to blow. Keep your head together now and call my name out loud. And soon I will be knocking upon your door.. (Chorus). You just call out my name. And you know where ever I am. I'll come running to see you again.. Winter, spring, summer or fall. All you got to do is call. And I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah.. Hey, ain't it good to know that you've got a friend?. People can be so cold.. They'll hurt you and desert you.. Well they'll take your soul if you let them.. Oh yeah, but don't you let them.. (Chorus). You just call out my name. And you know wherever I am. I'll come running to see you again.. Oh babe, don't you know that,. Winter, spring, summer, or fall,. Hey now, all you've got to do is call.. Lord, I'll be there, yes I will.. You've got a friend.. You've got a friend.. Ain't it good to know you've got a friend.. Ain't it good to know you've got a friend."
