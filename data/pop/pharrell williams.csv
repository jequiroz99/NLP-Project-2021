U know it's hard for a playa to admit that sumtimes. But I'm a spit that sumtimes. U know wat I'm sayin'. Ay p, give it to em one time, nephew. Pharrell nd Charlie:. There's sumthin bout this girl. From around my way. Ever try to hold back ur feelings,. But it just wouldn't stay?. But when I finally found the words to say. I wanted to run away. Simply run away. Pharrell:. U can try to run and hide. It wont make a difference. U can lie to urself. Of the reason. Sure it hurts wen it comes to ur attention. That ur in love with the girl. Yessir, that's her. But it wasn't like that back wen I met her. The lavish life from all the do? spun. Before the Rr had the hitchhike thumb. Her friends didn't like niggaz like us but I. Arrested the coochie and her feelings got cuffed. Spiderweb sex, must'a got caught up. But there's more to it. I remember once. Sayin' let's shit on the peons. Let's go ta vegas nd watch celine dion. Make em say 'wat we on???. U say no like u was doin it for eons. Fuck it, I'll just hum and let the watch give off the neons. Wen it rains it pours. I laughs to myself wen I change the score. U said my sex was a lot but my brain gave u more. And sumn bout how ya ex was a toy. I guess he played games. There's only diamond dice here. Not tryin ta justify. But wen ya shut ya eye u can touch the sky. U in trouble ma. And u should pray about speed. But if this bout u. Wat that say about me?. Pharrell and Charlie:. But when I finally found the words to say. I wanted to run away. Simply run away. Pharrell:. U can try to run and hide. It wont make a difference. U can lie to urself. Of the reason.

It's really weird cuz a nigga got love. Snoop Dogg's a crip and the girl was a blood (what???). She told me that her baby-daddy was a thug. Now it is wat it is and it was how it was. I'm hollin lil mama like wat. Money mo stacked tryin ta get my g's back. All these memories breed seeds of a rhythm rhyme pleaser. Laid back while we sippin on a breeza. Fresh 4-pack sittin in the freeza. Ain't that kadeeja? I heard she was a Skeeza?. She used ta hit them licks wit the Beezas. Wen I seen her wit the homies, I was like ?Jesus!?. It's been a lil min since I seen her. Hope her man don't run up cuz ill have to pull the neena. Pharrell and Charlie:. There's sumthin bout this girl. From around my way. Ever try to hold back ur feelings,. But it just wouldn't stay?. But when I finally found the words to say. I wanted to run away. Simply run away. Pharrell and Charlie:. U can try to run and hide.

wanna love you girl ft. robin thicke,"[Pharrell] Ho!. [Verse - Robin Thicke]. She's the kind of girl you wanna marry. The kind of girl you'd walk the whole world for. Put her on your back and just carry. Her attitude is hotter than the earth's core. When she's around nothing else matters. Untouchable, she's got her own forcefield. Sooner or later someone will get at her. If I don't someone else will. [Chorus - Robin Thicke] (2x). Wanna love you girl, wanna love you - girl. Wanna love you girl, wanna love you. Wanna love you girl, wanna love you - girl. Wanna love you girl, wanna love you. Ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh!. [Verse - Robin Thicke]. She's the kind of girl you wanna marry. Scientists say that she's the second sunshine. And now my life is sweeter than berries. I guess if we have sex our love will turn to wine. When she's around nothing else matters. Even if the sky was at a stand still. If I turn my back then someone will get at her. If I don't someone else will. [Chorus]. [Bridge - Robin Thicke] (2x). Wanna love you girl, wanna love you. (I'm so glad I found you - oh girl!). Wanna love you girl, wanna love you. Wanna love you girl, wanna love you. Wanna love you girl, ooo-ooh. [Verse - Pharrell Williams]. Uhh! picture this all. Picture my life and my intention to ball. Picture this ice and how it glitter for y'all. Now don't you feel claustrophobic when that chick is involved?. She changed your life - and your frame of mind. Sorry I hope what I'm saying is fine. We fuss but we take it one day at a time. If there's a fire you know that she'll lay in the line. I just, close my eyes and curve my mouth. Open my mind and words come out. You're eclectic, you're creative. You the picture girl I just painted. I got it, you name it, it's all paid for. Big castle on the sea shore, with the Willy Wonka decor. How this sound - Mr. and Mrs. Skateboard - P!. [Bridge]"
frontin' (feat. jay z),"Verse: Pharrell Williams. Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude. But you ain't looking at no other dudes cause you love me. (I'm sorry but.. so sexy).

And you acting like you ain't appealing but you are. Stuting like you ain't my only girl but you are (I was just frontin). I'm ready to stop when you are. [Chorus]. [Outro: Pharrell Williams].

But I admit I got all this paper plus the prettiest faces that's off of our nature. I drive a Casper, s'cuse me Cassper, wanted meet me at my house, I got space like NASA. And it'll make me happy buy yourself a Sattle. Unlike my sister Stacy when she lost her papa. I been there, gettin stroke and nothing to trap-uh. John could do, when surrounded with true. A man dies, baby born, as far as Peru. It's a simple proof between us and imposters. We hop in the air, and don't care what it costs us. Now I'm with NERD with a pit full of Martians. I guess you could say that we fly like saucers. Zapping at niggas, with classing and figure. The cash and class whippers. The thrashing mag ripper. Go 'head and say it (you a rappin' ass nigga). Yessur!. [Bridge]. [Chorus]. Nigga you don't know me..."

Should I mention the fact the transition is the track. No one change into the vision just to get me where I'm at. No skateboy P too grown. Riding up and down college in that new 2 tone. It's so cold you dont wanna feel the chill of it, (Uh!). Just stand back and just look at the grill of it, (Uh!). I don't smoke but I bet the... love it!. It totally intensifies vivd ass appeal of it,. You could be jealous, and grit ya teeth,. But all these little nigaas got something in reach. While on my boat party trying to sunseek,. My name is...

Got a lot to smile about, ahaha, talk to y'all niggas...yessur, hey. [Verse 1]. My best friend say I'm bottled up, I need a fucking therapist. But I can't think of nobody I wanna share this with. Why should I open up on somebody elses carelessness.... [cork pops] There goes the top, nigga, so here it is. Mama workin' all day, Daddy out in the streets. Imagine 10 years old full of doubt and defeat. Growing up around criminals, with clout and deceat. My grandma Loucelle used to tell me, you about what you wheap. She used to help me with my homework, addiction-subtraction. Added faith to my life and doubt got subtracted. Wanna skip ya mind from crying better learn something, son. You be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums. Look, oo you see me ma. They wish they could be me ma. As I got better, her body was eaten by Luchimia. Seventh grade, it was cursed and sad. But the gift within it, was when I first met Chad. But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed. Cuz grandma Loucelle died on 12th 19th. I can't help but wonder, what kind of black cloud I was under. Cuz 15 years later the other died that summer...bummer. [Chorus]. My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine. But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind. So let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what).. See, you wont even know you hurt sometimes, until you in conversation it comes out in a line so let it. out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out. [Verse 2]. Aye yo, 10 21 Atlantis drive, nigga was action packed. That's Atlantis appartments, we live in half the back. That's where the 12 year olds there, they wbe flashing crack. And when they shoot you nigga, they ain't tryna pass it back. Aye yo, Diggy, Fleet and Marvian can you imagine that?. The place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat. But I escaped cuz I chased, what made me passion that. Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps. So many niggas will rise. So many them niggas try. So many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied. So many them same niggas, man they moms eyes cry. So, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride. Well let me tell niggas something, I'm so glad you alive. Long as you got a breathe, a pulse, nigga strive. Devine intervention this is. I heard a voice nigga, listen to this. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. Jesus will arange it, but Jesus wont change it. Hold yourself responsible, on yourself you blame it. You mad, nigga don't articulate and ??,. I.E. we best friends, speak best friends language. I'm a happy nigga, you can't approach me in anguish. Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless. Can't be mad at the world cuz you and your girl ain't famous. Cuz you both on bate, BBC and chainless. Also your rangless, therefore switch laneless. Now you brainless, dangerous, cuz you pull out the stainless. All of sudden you smart, now you do something hainess. First time you get caught, now your ass is famous. No longer chainless, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look. Yo girl with ya man sellin' laneless, Stop. Nigga rewind and reverese slides 3 times. Reassess your thinking and trust me it'll be fine. First pitcure your goal, and repeat 'It'll be mine'. Or fuck it nigga, just keep imagine killin' me fine. Now you, scruntching your face tryna ace attainment. When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, nigga. Sucess is taingeable, don't wait for fame. I thought you would receive it better if I ain't say ya name. You unsure of yourself, sit still and think. Review those actions if it fit, put your name in the blank. [Chorus]. Star Track, is who we are [x4]"

broken glass,"[Pharrell] Kweli!!!. [T. Kweli] Yeah! They wasn't expecting this! that's why ya. [Pharrell] Hahaha. [T. Kweli] Gotta hope for the best and play 'em for the worst, c'mon!. [Pharrell] Muhfuckers is history!. [T. Kweli] C'mon!!. [Verse - Talib Kweli]. This the story of - Lucy In The Sky Wit Diamonds. Ask her why she crying, she wanna live, she got no time for dying. Was a science, dreams too big for a small town. She gotta get to New York and watch a door fall down. Hopped off the Greyhound, gotta make her way now. She sleeping on the park benches in the playground. But cash burn quick, don't wanna have to turn trick. Ready to quit 'til she met the super pimp. Flashing his toothy smile that drove little Lucy wild. She quick to hop up on his dick straight Hoopie style. She let the fella hit but she sang she sell-a-bit [celebate]. He ain't buying that, she ain't selling it. She looking for love in all of the above. Believing videos, trying to back up all on a thug. Who wanna - put it in her, withdraw like a Citi card. But now she shake that ass for tips at the titty bar. [Chorus - Talib Kweli] (Pharrell). Broken glass - everywhere! (IT'S LOUDER!!). Louder - than a bomb shattered in in the air (IT'S LOUDER!!). Try to hold back your tears baby! (IT'S LOUDER!!). Wait a second, what happens here baby? (IT'S LOUDER!!). Broken glass - everywhere! (IT'S LOUDER!!). Louder - than a bomb shattered in in the air, yeah. (How many of y'all think you can do what we do?!). Yeah! Wait a second (One! Two! Three! C'mon!). [Verse - Talib Kweli]. Dreams shattered like broken glass. Press ignore it and your hopes get broken fast. You complain for the life you supposed to have. But when you try to make plans God is known to laugh. Throw a song on the phonograph, and Lucy start wilin. The trick start smiling, watch the loot start flying. The Gucci start pilling up, she live designer plush. Start lining up the coke so she could find a rush. Time's up, she's about to turn 33. Her shit started to sag, she got surgery. Now cats are used to drive past her like a Church van. Acting on thirst, 'She Wants To Move' like a N.E.R.D. fan. Bigger house, 10,000 dollar purse fam. She let you in, she wanted rent by the 1st man. She the ring leader in a clique of birds. And they shadowy, like the silhouette behind the curtain. [Chorus]. [Verse - Talib Kweli]. She was a small city girl with big city dreams. Niggaz try to figure how to get up in them jeans. Put her in them scenes, get her on the team. Hit her wit the cream 'til they figured out the schemes. Now she all up in the club looking for a new love. Really like Huey Lewis looking for a new drug. Cause coke's getting old, started free basing. Graduated to crack, smack on occasion. Not catching the bus, but back at the station. Back and forth pacing, acting all impatient. Last hundred dollars, she got to 'Get By'. Now gotta make a choice, go home or get high. Mommy and daddy miss her, she left for the fame. Now what's left is the dirt that's thrown on her name. She need a ticket home if it's the right course. Instead she bought a ticket to ride the white horse. [Chorus]"

Nigga that brought you ice creams 2 for a pair,. Officially announcing that this is warfare. Cuz back in the day my clouds was grey. And it seemed like my angels couldn't blow them away.

And all our car doors go up like Transformers. See I can do it thisaway I can do it thataway. From the crib in Viginia to that new Miami getaway. So cool like new edition that she hollas ya scent,.

On and on and the temperatures warming. I spit heat flashes, niggaz get nautious,. Bright as a bitch. So analyze with caution. When the light hit the ice bet a 100 that you vomit. Should I mention the fact the transition is the track. No one change into the vision just to get me where I'm at. No skateboy P too grown. Riding up and down college in that new 2 tone. It's so cold you dont wanna feel the chill of it, (Uh!). Just stand back and just look at the grill of it, (Uh!). I don't smoke but I bet the... love it!. It totally intensifies vivd ass appeal of it,. You could be jealous, and grit ya teeth,. But all these little nigaas got something in reach. While on my boat party trying to sunseek,. My name is... Skate Board.... Ladies and gentlemen,. Can I have it like that?. You got it like that. Can I have it like that?. You got it like that. Can I have it like that?. You got it like that.

how does it feel?,"Wooo wooo! [in background]. Yessur! aha. New Skateboard P. Hey!. Let's go get 'em. uh-huh. yo, hola. [Verse 1]. Mearle maire, club muchacho. Asorted flavours, in they solatos. Inspire young minds, stacked by Nato's. With the right determination of a patho. Running 'cross the water with bricks at his poncho. Face like a shoot when it's bussin' my glock hold. Vanity stings, 'til I die when the holy father hands me my wings. When I was young yo the teacher gave me stanity dreams. Giving me music like drugs and they handed me things, they shoot it up. See me on the TV, the cuties they wanna fuck. Both presidental and plus, they hoop it up. Got more hits in his zip, who want enough. I can go back in time, you be Judge Eato. With my men and ?? I know you thinkin' Neato. Givin' peace to minutes, something like your T-Vo. But it's 3 hundred thousand more with no remote. Take it in the rain, I used to live with Tito. But he clowned me and told me that my money's free-doughs. Now the Enzo doors go up like a Dilo. Reon, same song some from my man Nigo. SLR, when the doors go up it's like a fresh elle jar. Nigga we boss, he shall not get hot, he too frost. Yessur.... [Bridge]. My nigga close your eyes,. Just picture you're self just holdin' pies. Impliment a plan and and you'll surely rise. Just promised by the man that controls the skies. Don't you see, I know that shit's so ill. Better yet, dawg, just tell me how you feel. ...How you feel dawg?. [Chorus]. We just picture thinking, dreaming, scheming, breathing, reading, all in the late night. Shaking, boiling, lacing, bacon, shaking, shaping, gotta get this cake right.

I'm part Howard Hues, part horny, part holy. First trip on the ramp is the rock and rolly. Keep one on my staff with a new pro-chromy. If they priest need the mention that I've been biten. But a force be the chocolate where critics are written. He dresses insane where his music admire. Ask anyone from Vouge and Esquire And Vanity Fair you like can of the year. But you should guess who's in insanity chair. Now it ain't about what I want. Still thumbing through my life like a drug-star porn. It's one thing to say you did it. It's one thing to lie about your didgits. It's one thing to say that you live it. It's another for you fuckers to admit it. But I admit I got all this paper plus the prettiest faces that's off of our nature. I drive a Casper, s'cuse me Cassper, wanted meet me at my house, I got space like NASA. And it'll make me happy buy yourself a Sattle. Unlike my sister Stacy when she lost her papa. I been there, gettin stroke and nothing to trap-uh. John could do, when surrounded with true. A man dies, baby born, as far as Peru. It's a simple proof between us and imposters. We hop in the air, and don't care what it costs us. Now I'm with NERD with a pit full of Martians. I guess you could say that we fly like saucers. Zapping at niggas, with classing and figure. The cash and class whippers. The thrashing mag ripper. Go 'head and say it (you a rappin' ass nigga).

[Pharrell talking]. Yup. This is for all of the consors of fine rhyme you know?. I dug deep in the cellars of my mind for this. I love y'all niggaz. I just wanna air some things out. Dear Hip-Hip, ya know?. Dear Hip-Hop. Dear Hip-Hop:. [Verse 1]. I got a cult following, N*E*R*D is far from Pop G. No radio, light spins since the video drop see. I'm the turbion of this shit, like Mozart and Bach B. I'm-ma show you niggaz what time it is, niggaz watch me. My falsetto been hot, like the Sopranos five seasons. Alto beats +Grindin+ soundin like +Frontin'+, Niggaz is reachin'. I pimped across that stage nigga tipsy off that reason. Snatch that Grammy, when I joke I call it G-Thing. Ask Robin Leach. How many V-somthins up in my fortress. Like Russle Crowe in +Gladiator+, so many fucking horses. Porsches, ??? thats white, I call it Ghost. Phantom named Nightmare, night scares people the most. I introduce BAPE to the world, 400 nigga out fast. Favorite group White Stripe, R. Kelly, Kanye and Outcast. A R&B producer, I was sittin on the shelf. A Ralph Laurenic nerd then Noreaga gave me help. But my samples wouldn't clear, and I couldn't rock a wig. And they didn't have pimp cups, and dancin wasn't my gig. But shoulder brushin, blazers and trucker hats I did. And the only niggaz I ain't work with was Tupac and Big. Ha ha. [Chorus]. You and me. BAPE, Ice Cream and BBC (Yup). Just because we skate down the road (Niggaz). Don't mean we can't slam Phantom Doors (Bitches). You and me. BAPE, Ice Cream and BBC. Just because we skate down the road ( love y'all man). Don't mean we can't slam Phantom Doors (You have no idea). [Verse 2]. Now er'body keep asking me about Kelis. She's dope with or without me til I die thats what I speak. I never run to the tabloids and run around here grinnin'. I'm a peaceful, Rolls Royce drivin' black John Lennon. psychedelic beats, medals on my Solder jacket. Fuckin the baddest bitches in fashion, niggaz could you imagine?. Ma, why you even breathin? Why you even talkin'?. Put my Big Bang in your Black Hole, I'm Stephen Hawkins. If the mind is full of water, can you believe I'm walkin'. On your thoughts trust me niggaz what I've achieved is awesome. Mind readers you think you know me, proceed with caution. Ohup! Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind you lost him. I cried when my grandma died, Bob says Josh says. If Josh short for Jesus, then I'll sing what Bob says. Oh small diamonds are blahsay blahsay. Remember 20 carot soilitares can not be paveyed. And while my heart has lots of scars hidden. My beats is star ridden, givin trucks and jeeps and cars rythem. Accompanied by 40 bars spittin, not from the prospective of Nasism. But as N*E*R*D goes as I start peni-trating minds unlikely fitting. Ghetto girls and thugs liking the album guitar driven, Yup!. Ghetto girls to girls from the valley. To niggaz that skate to niggaz that pump crack in they alleys. I'm the Black Card, Timothy Leary, John Lennon lookin for my Yoko. Hopin my wife hears me. And maybe she'll have more +Interscope+ and not be a +Virgin+. Who bought my album, and who will prefer the regular version that goes. [Maybe {original} chours plays fast]. See, maybe [Haha]. There was something wrong [Hooo!]. And you were telling me no wrong [What up Black radio? Daddy loves you]. See, maybe [Ahhhhohhhhhhhhhh!]. The laugh's on me [Yeahhhh]. And life was telling me a joke (joke, joke joke). [Maybe {Remix} scratchs back in]. Owwww!. [Chorus]. You and me. BAPE, Ice Cream and BBC. Just because we skate down the road (Mean what?). Don't mean we can't slam Phantom Doors (Nigga nigga). You and me. BAPE, Ice Cream and BBC. Just because we skate down the road. Don't mean we can't slam Phantom Doors (nigga nigga).

A fresh new couch and a whole lot of trainers. A closet full of clothes and some brand new dangers. And. Some Mexican floral arrangers. A great big TV that'll entertain us. Some colorful commissions for some high paid painters. Someone to take the wrap so that I stay stainless. And. A new relationship with a banker. Two pinky rings for my manicured fingers. A trained German Shepard that bark when it's angered. To watch my possessions and look out for strangers. And. A 50 foot yacht with an anchor. Young supermodel that shall remain nameless. Ups and the downs, the sames and the changes. All the money in the world don't make it painless (no). (Chorus). (But they love it and they love it). The more you try to erase me.

I wonder how Gods gon’ paint today’s canvasses. Cause who knew that day that man would just. Go to VA with a Tec and spray campuses. What a way to see the cover of Time.

you can do it too,"Intro). My nigga you can do it too (turn me up, turn me up). You can do it too. My nigga you can do it too. You can do it too. You can do it too (Just tellin you, ya know?). (Verse 1). Ay yo. Never in a million years i'll imagine i'll get my thrills. By listening to squeals of PJ wheels. As we land I duck down,I stick my head up my dick is being sucked down, by a bitch named what now. I look in her eyes, and her eyes are like an orange stars. Look at the reflection of my foreign car by R & R. I stick my feet out, you know the bapes that's made of eel. You know the new checks with nigo face right on the heel. I was a marching band, I was a skateboader. Jesus made wine, I couldn't make water Ox-moronic, I'm here to destroy all you hate hoarders. You niggas were cool in school now you niggas take orders. I'm not dissin your job. But now you listen and nod. Some mound the limit shit, I know this position is odd. Don't Gasp for air. You can turn blue. Look, excel nigga. Trust me you can do it. *Chorus*. You can do it too young blood. You can do it too young love. Just watch what you do young blood. And watch whose in your crew young blood. It don't matter if you do drugs,. Or even if you threw slugs. You can do it too young blood (love). I did you can do it too. I know niggas are like there's no returning when i bought that white five-fifth. So white that the coke heads just might try sniff. I ordered the phatom coupe, that's smoke pipe grey. And the interior was like crack white beige. Atleast that's what it looked like when it was on that page. I combed the whole brochure and it did not say, oh well. Life's a bitch but not too extreme. Life's got a fat ass,Trust me i'ma fuck full steam. I make the world cream and scream, while i'm gettin my cream. I'm coming to america call me Prince Hakim? Yessur. It's kinda weird, 'cause this i dream. Kinda prophetic ya get it 'cause this i seen. These type of visions, since I's teen. I told my teacher what I saw, she said I missed byzine. Laughed with the class with the slightest clue. You be buying my shit, and I be rappin to you, but you can do it too. *Chorus*. I know you heard the story about the dude with the attitude. Pharrell he don't even know you but he mad at you. He got robbed and it seems he has a huge. He's really frustrated and that it all he has is you. So, things propel and things excel. The next the a bing comes out the barrell. And my man they accused him of sittin tight up in jail. Ironic he close my man luke can hear him yell. I ain't do it but somebody dropped him flat. I felt the wind from it, that was God cocking back. I got a call from Virginia grandma went back. The line was fluctuated but it just now went flat. See her body went down and her soul went up. She sent angels around me so evil could not touch. I don't lie no more and I'm haunted when I fuck. Wealthy niggas with a conscience, yeah you know what's up. The wires across, and it's breeding a plague. The conscience is hungry, and it's eating away. Trying to make sense of it, but it's speedy in vain. Up all night with the books and you read till the day. But still ya house of diddy 'cause you got a little paper. Push a cat in the corner, trust me it's the nature. Never underestimate the things-. you do. read your verse too, inhale the oo, and go. *Chorus*. (Man Singing). Don't Be afraid to look up the sky (x8). (ending)"

wanna love you girl ft. robin thicke,"[Pharrell] Ho!. [Verse - Robin Thicke]. She's the kind of girl you wanna marry. The kind of girl you'd walk the whole world for. Put her on your back and just carry. Her attitude is hotter than the earth's core. When she's around nothing else matters. Untouchable, she's got her own forcefield. Sooner or later someone will get at her. If I don't someone else will. [Chorus - Robin Thicke] (2x). Wanna love you girl, wanna love you - girl. Wanna love you girl, wanna love you. Wanna love you girl, wanna love you - girl. Wanna love you girl, wanna love you. Ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh!. [Verse - Robin Thicke]. She's the kind of girl you wanna marry. Scientists say that she's the second sunshine. And now my life is sweeter than berries. I guess if we have sex our love will turn to wine. When she's around nothing else matters. Even if the sky was at a stand still. If I turn my back then someone will get at her. If I don't someone else will. [Chorus]. [Bridge - Robin Thicke] (2x). Wanna love you girl, wanna love you. (I'm so glad I found you - oh girl!). Wanna love you girl, wanna love you. Wanna love you girl, wanna love you. Wanna love you girl, ooo-ooh. [Verse - Pharrell Williams]. Uhh! picture this all. Picture my life and my intention to ball. Picture this ice and how it glitter for y'all. Now don't you feel claustrophobic when that chick is involved?. She changed your life - and your frame of mind. Sorry I hope what I'm saying is fine. We fuss but we take it one day at a time. If there's a fire you know that she'll lay in the line. I just, close my eyes and curve my mouth. Open my mind and words come out. You're eclectic, you're creative. You the picture girl I just painted. I got it, you name it, it's all paid for. Big castle on the sea shore, with the Willy Wonka decor. How this sound - Mr. and Mrs. Skateboard - P!. [Bridge]"

Inspire young minds, stacked by Nato's. With the right determination of a patho. Running 'cross the water with bricks at his poncho. Face like a shoot when it's bussin' my glock hold. Vanity stings, 'til I die when the holy father hands me my wings. When I was young yo the teacher gave me stanity dreams. Giving me music like drugs and they handed me things, they shoot it up. See me on the TV, the cuties they wanna fuck. Both presidental and plus, they hoop it up. Got more hits in his zip, who want enough. I can go back in time, you be Judge Eato. With my men and ?? I know you thinkin' Neato. Givin' peace to minutes, something like your T-Vo. But it's 3 hundred thousand more with no remote. Take it in the rain, I used to live with Tito. But he clowned me and told me that my money's free-doughs. Now the Enzo doors go up like a Dilo. Reon, same song some from my man Nigo. SLR, when the doors go up it's like a fresh elle jar. Nigga we boss, he shall not get hot, he too frost. Yessur.... [Bridge]. My nigga close your eyes,. Just picture you're self just holdin' pies. Impliment a plan and and you'll surely rise. Just promised by the man that controls the skies. Don't you see, I know that shit's so ill. Better yet, dawg, just tell me how you feel. ...How you feel dawg?. [Chorus]. We just picture thinking, dreaming, scheming, breathing, reading, all in the late night. Shaking, boiling, lacing, bacon, shaking, shaping, gotta get this cake right. As I serve it, you just burn it, breathe it, learn it, now watch you take flight. ...My nigga how does it feel?. Ha ha! Yessur!. [Verse 2]. Nigga you don't know me. I'm part Howard Hues, part horny, part holy. First trip on the ramp is the rock and rolly. Keep one on my staff with a new pro-chromy. If they priest need the mention that I've been biten. But a force be the chocolate where critics are written. He dresses insane where his music admire. Ask anyone from Vouge and Esquire And Vanity Fair you like can of the year. But you should guess who's in insanity chair. Now it ain't about what I want. Still thumbing through my life like a drug-star porn. It's one thing to say you did it. It's one thing to lie about your didgits. It's one thing to say that you live it. It's another for you fuckers to admit it. But I admit I got all this paper plus the prettiest faces that's off of our nature. I drive a Casper, s'cuse me Cassper, wanted meet me at my house, I got space like NASA. And it'll make me happy buy yourself a Sattle. Unlike my sister Stacy when she lost her papa. I been there, gettin stroke and nothing to trap-uh. John could do, when surrounded with true. A man dies, baby born, as far as Peru. It's a simple proof between us and imposters. We hop in the air, and don't care what it costs us. Now I'm with NERD with a pit full of Martians. I guess you could say that we fly like saucers. Zapping at niggas, with classing and figure. The cash and class whippers. The thrashing mag ripper. Go 'head and say it (you a rappin' ass nigga).

best friend,"Yeah, ye...spit my gum out right now...haha. What up world? Got my insperation in the studio with me, right?...feelin' good. Got a lot to smile about, ahaha, talk to y'all niggas...yessur, hey. [Verse 1]. My best friend say I'm bottled up, I need a fucking therapist. But I can't think of nobody I wanna share this with. Why should I open up on somebody elses carelessness.... [cork pops] There goes the top, nigga, so here it is. Mama workin' all day, Daddy out in the streets. Imagine 10 years old full of doubt and defeat. Growing up around criminals, with clout and deceat. My grandma Loucelle used to tell me, you about what you wheap. She used to help me with my homework, addiction-subtraction. Added faith to my life and doubt got subtracted. Wanna skip ya mind from crying better learn something, son. You be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums. Look, oo you see me ma. They wish they could be me ma. As I got better, her body was eaten by Luchimia. Seventh grade, it was cursed and sad. But the gift within it, was when I first met Chad. But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed. Cuz grandma Loucelle died on 12th 19th. I can't help but wonder, what kind of black cloud I was under. Cuz 15 years later the other died that summer...bummer. [Chorus]. My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine. But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind. So let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what).. See, you wont even know you hurt sometimes, until you in conversation it comes out in a line so let it. out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out. [Verse 2]. Aye yo, 10 21 Atlantis drive, nigga was action packed. That's Atlantis appartments, we live in half the back. That's where the 12 year olds there, they wbe flashing crack. And when they shoot you nigga, they ain't tryna pass it back. Aye yo, Diggy, Fleet and Marvian can you imagine that?. The place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat. But I escaped cuz I chased, what made me passion that. Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps. So many niggas will rise. So many them niggas try. So many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied. So many them same niggas, man they moms eyes cry. So, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride. Well let me tell niggas something, I'm so glad you alive. Long as you got a breathe, a pulse, nigga strive. Devine intervention this is. I heard a voice nigga, listen to this. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. Jesus will arange it, but Jesus wont change it. Hold yourself responsible, on yourself you blame it. You mad, nigga don't articulate and ??,. I.E. we best friends, speak best friends language. I'm a happy nigga, you can't approach me in anguish. Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless. Can't be mad at the world cuz you and your girl ain't famous. Cuz you both on bate, BBC and chainless. Also your rangless, therefore switch laneless. Now you brainless, dangerous, cuz you pull out the stainless. All of sudden you smart, now you do something hainess. First time you get caught, now your ass is famous. No longer chainless, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look. Yo girl with ya man sellin' laneless, Stop. Nigga rewind and reverese slides 3 times. Reassess your thinking and trust me it'll be fine. First pitcure your goal, and repeat 'It'll be mine'. Or fuck it nigga, just keep imagine killin' me fine. Now you, scruntching your face tryna ace attainment. When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, nigga. Sucess is taingeable, don't wait for fame. I thought you would receive it better if I ain't say ya name. You unsure of yourself, sit still and think. Review those actions if it fit, put your name in the blank. [Chorus]. Star Track, is who we are [x4]"

broken glass,"[Pharrell] Kweli!!!. [T. Kweli] Yeah! They wasn't expecting this! that's why ya. [Pharrell] Hahaha. [T. Kweli] Gotta hope for the best and play 'em for the worst, c'mon!. [Pharrell] Muhfuckers is history!. [T. Kweli] C'mon!!. [Verse - Talib Kweli]. This the story of - Lucy In The Sky Wit Diamonds. Ask her why she crying, she wanna live, she got no time for dying. Was a science, dreams too big for a small town. She gotta get to New York and watch a door fall down. Hopped off the Greyhound, gotta make her way now. She sleeping on the park benches in the playground. But cash burn quick, don't wanna have to turn trick. Ready to quit 'til she met the super pimp. Flashing his toothy smile that drove little Lucy wild. She quick to hop up on his dick straight Hoopie style. She let the fella hit but she sang she sell-a-bit [celebate]. He ain't buying that, she ain't selling it. She looking for love in all of the above. Believing videos, trying to back up all on a thug. Who wanna - put it in her, withdraw like a Citi card. But now she shake that ass for tips at the titty bar. [Chorus - Talib Kweli] (Pharrell). Broken glass - everywhere! (IT'S LOUDER!!). Louder - than a bomb shattered in in the air (IT'S LOUDER!!). Try to hold back your tears baby! (IT'S LOUDER!!). Wait a second, what happens here baby? (IT'S LOUDER!!). Broken glass - everywhere! (IT'S LOUDER!!). Louder - than a bomb shattered in in the air, yeah. (How many of y'all think you can do what we do?!). Yeah! Wait a second (One! Two! Three! C'mon!). [Verse - Talib Kweli]. Dreams shattered like broken glass. Press ignore it and your hopes get broken fast. You complain for the life you supposed to have. But when you try to make plans God is known to laugh. Throw a song on the phonograph, and Lucy start wilin. The trick start smiling, watch the loot start flying. The Gucci start pilling up, she live designer plush. Start lining up the coke so she could find a rush. Time's up, she's about to turn 33. Her shit started to sag, she got surgery. Now cats are used to drive past her like a Church van. Acting on thirst, 'She Wants To Move' like a N.E.R.D. fan. Bigger house, 10,000 dollar purse fam. She let you in, she wanted rent by the 1st man. She the ring leader in a clique of birds. And they shadowy, like the silhouette behind the curtain. [Chorus]. [Verse - Talib Kweli]. She was a small city girl with big city dreams. Niggaz try to figure how to get up in them jeans. Put her in them scenes, get her on the team. Hit her wit the cream 'til they figured out the schemes. Now she all up in the club looking for a new love. Really like Huey Lewis looking for a new drug. Cause coke's getting old, started free basing. Graduated to crack, smack on occasion. Not catching the bus, but back at the station. Back and forth pacing, acting all impatient. Last hundred dollars, she got to 'Get By'. Now gotta make a choice, go home or get high. Mommy and daddy miss her, she left for the fame. Now what's left is the dirt that's thrown on her name. She need a ticket home if it's the right course. Instead she bought a ticket to ride the white horse. [Chorus]"

Should I mention the fact the transition is the track. No one change into the vision just to get me where I'm at. No skateboy P too grown. Riding up and down college in that new 2 tone. It's so cold you dont wanna feel the chill of it, (Uh!). Just stand back and just look at the grill of it, (Uh!). I don't smoke but I bet the... love it!. It totally intensifies vivd ass appeal of it,. You could be jealous, and grit ya teeth,. But all these little nigaas got something in reach. While on my boat party trying to sunseek,. My name is...

I know you thinkin' Neato. Givin' peace to minutes, something like your T-Vo. But it's 3 hundred thousand more with no remote. Take it in the rain, I used to live with Tito.

And complicate the things you trust in. But I know my foundation is solid. And can take some hating. Prayer's gon' be on this space station. On the way to the master's apron. They'll call it a mystery. But we're gonna call it victory. We'll be writing history. It's gon' be victory. They'll be signs on top of signs. Just so you know the history. It's saying victory is with me. . |. |. |"

Dear Hip-Hip, ya know?. Dear Hip-Hop. Dear Hip-Hop:. [Verse 1]. I got a cult following, N*E*R*D is far from Pop G. No radio, light spins since the video drop see.

Alto beats +Grindin+ soundin like +Frontin'+, Niggaz is reachin'. I pimped across that stage nigga tipsy off that reason. Snatch that Grammy, when I joke I call it G-Thing. Ask Robin Leach. How many V-somthins up in my fortress. Like Russle Crowe in +Gladiator+, so many fucking horses. Porsches, ??? thats white, I call it Ghost. Phantom named Nightmare, night scares people the most. I introduce BAPE to the world, 400 nigga out fast. Favorite group White Stripe, R. Kelly, Kanye and Outcast. A R&B producer, I was sittin on the shelf. A Ralph Laurenic nerd then Noreaga gave me help. But my samples wouldn't clear, and I couldn't rock a wig. And they didn't have pimp cups, and dancin wasn't my gig. But shoulder brushin, blazers and trucker hats I did. And the only niggaz I ain't work with was Tupac and Big. Ha ha. [Chorus]. You and me. BAPE, Ice Cream and BBC (Yup).

Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind you lost him. I cried when my grandma died, Bob says Josh says. If Josh short for Jesus, then I'll sing what Bob says. Oh small diamonds are blahsay blahsay. Remember 20 carot soilitares can not be paveyed. And while my heart has lots of scars hidden. My beats is star ridden, givin trucks and jeeps and cars rythem. Accompanied by 40 bars spittin, not from the prospective of Nasism. But as N*E*R*D goes as I start peni-trating minds unlikely fitting. Ghetto girls and thugs liking the album guitar driven, Yup!. Ghetto girls to girls from the valley. To niggaz that skate to niggaz that pump crack in they alleys. I'm the Black Card, Timothy Leary, John Lennon lookin for my Yoko. Hopin my wife hears me.

I'm hollin lil mama like wat. Money mo stacked tryin ta get my g's back. All these memories breed seeds of a rhythm rhyme pleaser. Laid back while we sippin on a breeza. Fresh 4-pack sittin in the freeza. Ain't that kadeeja? I heard she was a Skeeza?. She used ta hit them licks wit the Beezas. Wen I seen her wit the homies, I was like ?Jesus!?. It's been a lil min since I seen her. Hope her man don't run up cuz ill have to pull the neena. Pharrell and Charlie:. There's sumthin bout this girl. From around my way. Ever try to hold back ur feelings,. But it just wouldn't stay?. But when I finally found the words to say. I wanted to run away. Simply run away. Pharrell and Charlie:. U can try to run and hide. It wont make a difference. U can lie to urself. Of the reason. Sure it hurts wen it comes to ur attention. That ur in love with the girl"

us placers ( feat. kanye west & lupe fiasco ),"(Lupe Fiasco). Yeah, Just a lil bit (just a lil bit) And it goes. Lifestyles of the rich and famous. Bought a big house and a whole lot of rangers. A fresh new couch and a whole lot of trainers. A closet full of clothes and some brand new dangers. And. Some Mexican floral arrangers. A great big TV that'll entertain us. Some colorful commissions for some high paid painters. Someone to take the wrap so that I stay stainless. And. A new relationship with a banker. Two pinky rings for my manicured fingers. A trained German Shepard that bark when it's angered. To watch my possessions and look out for strangers. And. A 50 foot yacht with an anchor. Young supermodel that shall remain nameless. Ups and the downs, the sames and the changes. All the money in the world don't make it painless (no). (Chorus). (But they love it and they love it). The more you try to erase me. (And they love it and they love it). The more that I appear, oh. (and they love it and they love it). The more, the more you try the eraser. The more that You appear. (Kanye West). (Plain Pat what up?). Lifestyles of the broke and famous. Let you know how crazy this game is. Look at all the new beautiful faces. At home supermodel, myspaces. Long for their shot on the TV screens. American Idol never seen these dreams. Just last week they want to see ID. Now they got you in VIP, huh?. How many people almost famous. You almost remember what they name is. Like “Hey, didn’t you play in..? No it couldn’t be, quit playin”. I try to keep that balance. After MTV that’s a Real World Challenge. Back on that train. Never to be heard from again…. (Chorus). (But they love it and they love it). The more you try to erase me. (And they love it and they love it). The more that I appear, oh. (and they love it and they love it). The more, the more you try the eraser. The more that You appear. (Pharrell). G.R.I.P P.I.M.P. I, any spelling bitch come on that’s me. I bring a burning sensation to the urban eye. Like an eye-drop of Turpentine. You can listen to the serpent, fine. But the earth got gas once it burps its fine. Someone around me they talk about the grease. Not G.H.G, how to cook a quarter ki. Talking all nasal, he aint over that cold. No glove scrub, Manny just over that stove. Perfect paradigm. Wrong place wrong time. Should have been Phizer, GlaxoSmithKline. Number one chemist. Look at him no blemish. Egg shell off white like a DuPont finish. Young, dumb, high strung, who could handle us. I wonder how Gods gon’ paint today’s canvasses. Cause who knew that day that man would just. Go to VA with a Tec and spray campuses. What a way to see the cover of Time. I know that nigga wish he was standing in line. To see it….As if he didn’t do it.. (Chorus). (But they love it and they love it). The more you try to erase me. (And they love it and they love it). The more that I appear, oh. (and they love it and they love it). The more, the more you try the eraser. The more that You appear"

Picture my life and my intention to ball. Picture this ice and how it glitter for y'all. Now don't you feel claustrophobic when that chick is involved?. She changed your life - and your frame of mind. Sorry I hope what I'm saying is fine. We fuss but we take it one day at a time. If there's a fire you know that she'll lay in the line. I just, close my eyes and curve my mouth. Open my mind and words come out. You're eclectic, you're creative. You the picture girl I just painted. I got it, you name it, it's all paid for. Big castle on the sea shore, with the Willy Wonka decor. How this sound - Mr. and Mrs. Skateboard - P!. [Bridge]"

As we land I duck down,I stick my head up my dick is being sucked down, by a bitch named what now. I look in her eyes, and her eyes are like an orange stars. Look at the reflection of my foreign car by R & R. I stick my feet out, you know the bapes that's made of eel. You know the new checks with nigo face right on the heel. I was a marching band, I was a skateboader. Jesus made wine, I couldn't make water Ox-moronic, I'm here to destroy all you hate hoarders. You niggas were cool in school now you niggas take orders. I'm not dissin your job. But now you listen and nod. Some mound the limit shit, I know this position is odd. Don't Gasp for air. You can turn blue. Look, excel nigga. Trust me you can do it. *Chorus*. You can do it too young blood. You can do it too young love. Just watch what you do young blood. And watch whose in your crew young blood. It don't matter if you do drugs,. Or even if you threw slugs. You can do it too young blood (love). I did you can do it too. I know niggas are like there's no returning when i bought that white five-fifth. So white that the coke heads just might try sniff. I ordered the phatom coupe, that's smoke pipe grey. And the interior was like crack white beige. Atleast that's what it looked like when it was on that page. I combed the whole brochure and it did not say, oh well. Life's a bitch but not too extreme. Life's got a fat ass,Trust me i'ma fuck full steam. I make the world cream and scream, while i'm gettin my cream. I'm coming to america call me Prince Hakim? Yessur. It's kinda weird, 'cause this i dream. Kinda prophetic ya get it 'cause this i seen. These type of visions, since I's teen. I told my teacher what I saw, she said I missed byzine. Laughed with the class with the slightest clue. You be buying my shit, and I be rappin to you, but you can do it too. *Chorus*. I know you heard the story about the dude with the attitude. Pharrell he don't even know you but he mad at you. He got robbed and it seems he has a huge. He's really frustrated and that it all he has is you. So, things propel and things excel. The next the a bing comes out the barrell. And my man they accused him of sittin tight up in jail. Ironic he close my man luke can hear him yell. I ain't do it but somebody dropped him flat. I felt the wind from it, that was God cocking back. I got a call from Virginia grandma went back. The line was fluctuated but it just now went flat. See her body went down and her soul went up. She sent angels around me so evil could not touch. I don't lie no more and I'm haunted when I fuck. Wealthy niggas with a conscience, yeah you know what's up. The wires across, and it's breeding a plague. The conscience is hungry, and it's eating away. Trying to make sense of it, but it's speedy in vain. Up all night with the books and you read till the day. But still ya house of diddy 'cause you got a little paper. Push a cat in the corner, trust me it's the nature.
