advice,Don't look down. Cause it's easier falling from force. Just letting it take nature's course. And picking it up when it's over. Don't be afraid. Cause the chances are there for the take. But treasure the choices you make. And know when you must take it slower. You may think you've had it rough. And try to give it up. But when you think you stop. Just go another way. Don't let go of good times. And let the bad ones know you feel fine. And wear your heart out on your sleeve. Cause love is all. Love is all you need. Don't be rushed. Cause hurrying causes mistakes. And make sure to give more than take. And sharing yourself bring you closer. You may think you've had it rough. And try to give it up. But when you think you stop. Just go another way. Don't let go of good times. And let the bad ones know you feel fine. And wear your heart out on your sleeve. Cause love is all you need. Feel with all your senses. Make sure to let down your defenses. There's just one way to make a scene. Love is all. Love is all you need. ooh ooh ooh ooh. ohh ohh oh. Take a chance now. Cause its easy. Take a chance now for you and me. Take a chance now. You can reach it. Take a chance for me. Don't let go of good times. And let the bad ones know you feel fine.

feelin' good,"Before last night I was down on my luck. There was nothing going my way. Before last night I wasn't feeling the love. No reason for a smile on my face. But I was always told. You could turn it around. Do it for the light of day. So get your self together. Head out on the town. The music gets you feeling okay. Now I'm on a roll and. I'm losing control 'cause. I got that sunshine. It's like the world is mine. I can't deny I'm feelin' good (feelin' good). Can't stop from smiling. I'm bottled lightning. But deep inside I'm feeling good (feelin' good). All my heartbreak. My long and rainy days. Are gone and now I can't complain. Everything's alright. I'm feeling so alive. I can't deny I'm feelin' good, yeah. I was so low on friday alone. No one even calling my phone. I looked in the mirror. And I said to myself. Why am I still seating at home?. Now I'm on a roll and. I'm losing control 'cause. I got that sunshine. It's like the world is mine. I can't deny I'm feelin' good (feelin' good). Can't stop from smiling. I'm bottled lightning. But deep inside I'm feeling good (feelin' good). All my heartbreak.

somebody that i used to know (the voice performance),"Now and then I think of when we were together. Like when you said you felt so happy you could die. Told myself that you were right for me. But felt so lonely in your company. But that was love and it's an ache I still remember. You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness. Like resignation to the end, always the end. So when we found that we could not make sense. Well you said that we would still be friends. But I'll admit that I was glad it was over. But you didn't have to cut me off. Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing. And I don't even need your love. But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough. No you didn't have to stoop so low. Have your friends collect your records and then change your number. I guess that I don't need that though. Now you're just somebody that I used to know. Now you're just somebody that I used to know. Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over. But had me believing it was always something that I'd done. But I don't wanna live that way. Reading into every word you say. You said that you could let it go. And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know. But you didn't have to cut me off. Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing. And I don't even need your love. But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough. And you didn't have to stoop so low. Have your friends collect your records and then change your number. I guess that I don't need that though. Now you're just somebody that I used to know. Somebody. (I used to know). Now you're just somebody that I used to know. Somebody. Yeah, yeah. Now you're just somebody that I used to know"
all of the stars (the voice highlight),"It's just another night. And I'm staring at the moon. I saw a shooting star. And thought of you. I sang a lullaby. By the waterside and knew. If you were here. I'd sing to you. You're on the other side. As the skyline splits in two. I'm miles away from seeing you. I can see the stars. From america. I wonder, do you see them, too?. So open your eyes and see. The way our horizons meet. And all of the lights will lead. Into the night with me. And I know these scars will bleed. But both of our hearts believe. All of these stars will guide us home. I can hear your heart. On the radio beat. They're playing 'chasing cars'. And I thought of us. Back to the time. You were lying next to me. I looked across and fell in love. So I took your hand. Back through lamp lit streets I knew. Everything led back to you. So can you see the stars?. Over amsterdam. You're the song my heart is. Beating to. So open your eyes and see. The way our horizons meet. And all of the lights will lead. Into the night with me. And I know these scars will bleed. But both of our hearts believe. All of these stars will guide us home. And, oh, I know. And oh, I know, oh. I can see the stars. From america"
miley cyrus medley,"When the waves are flooding the shore. (I remember when we kissed?). And I cant find my way home anymore. (I still feel it on my lips). Thats when I, I, I look at you. (The time that you danced with me, oh oh). I probably shouldnt say this. But at times I get so scared. When I think about the previous relationship we shared. It was awesome but we lost it. Its not possible for me not to care. (I had my sights set on you, ready to aim). And now were standing in the rain. But nothing ever gonna change until you hear my dear. (I have a heart that will, never be tamed). (It's the climb). (If we were a movie). Im standing out in the rain. I need to know if its over. (Always gonna be another mountain). Cause I will leave you alone. (It's the climb). (If we were a movie). Flooded with all this pain. Knowing that Ill never hold ya. (Always gonna want to make it move). Like I did before the storm. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-la-la-la. (Always gonna be an uphill battle). Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh. (Sometimes youre gonna have to lose). Feel like hopping on a flight. (I got a crazy feeling). Back to my home town tonight. (Deep inside). Something stops me every time. (I have a way of knowing). We were awesome but we lost it. Its not possible for me, not to care. Breakout let the party start,. Were gonna dance till the dancefloor falls apart. When we kiss Im hypnotized. When I look at you. You get best of both world. Its the climb. Always gonna be another mountain. Throw my hands up, theyre playing my song. If we were a movie, youd be the right guy. Its the climb. You make me laugh, you make me cry. I know its gonna be ok. Like I did before the storm"
think of you,"It's been awhile, I should be moved on. 'Cause I shouldn't be writing you this song. Haven't crossed my mind for so long. But tonight you're the movie, I want to leave on. Not enough rooms in this house. To hold all the treasures we found. Evidence all surround. Your fingerprints all over who I am now. You. We wished only stars they were ours they remind me of you. I'm still letting you go, I just want you to know. That I think of you, think of you. Think of you, think of you. The space in the back of my mind. I meet you there to reminisce from time to time. That you were the light, the blue in my skies. I saw the shades of myself in your eyes. You. We wished only stars they were ours they remind me of you. I'm still letting you go I just want you to know. That I think of you, think of you. I think of you, think of you. I think of you, oh. I think of you, I think of you. Think of you, think of you. Think of you, think of. You. We wished only stars they were ours they remind me of you. I'm still letting you go, I want you to know, yeah. We wished only stars they were ours. they remind me of you, yeah. I'm still letting you go, I want you to know. That I think of you, think of you. I think of you, I think of you"
in christ alone,"In Christ alone my hope is found. He is my light, my strength, my song. This Cornerstone, this solid ground. Firm through the fiercest drought and storm. What heights of love, what depths of peace. When fears are stilled, when strivings cease. My Comforter, my All in All. Here in the love of Christ I stand. In Christ alone, who took on flesh. Fullness of God in helpless babe. This gift of love and righteousness. Scorned by the ones He came to save. 'Til on that cross as Jesus died. The wrath of God was satisfied. For every sin on Him was laid. Here in the death of Christ I live. There in the ground His body lay. Light of the world by darkness slain. Then bursting forth in glorious Day. Up from the grave He rose again. And as He stands in victory. Sin's curse has lost its grip on me. For I am His and He is mine. Bought with the precious blood of Christ. No guilt in life, no fear in death. This is the power of Christ in me. From life's first cry to final breath. Jesus commands my destiny. No power of hell, no scheme of man. Can ever pluck me from His hand. 'til He returns or calls me home. Here in the power of Christ I'll stand"
little girl,"Little girl, don't you cry. Everything will be alright. Little girl, open your eyes. The sun will shine after tonight. Little girl, I got you. In my arms, is nothing new. Come out of your shell. Listen to me tell you. Little girl, I'm here to say. Don't run away. Little girl, I know you're scared. The things you bear. So let me tell you, you're okay. That you're in my arms to stay. Little girl. Little girl, wipe your tears. Darkness rain, don't have to fear. Little girl, clear your mind. And think of my love this time. Did you say it's no longer day. The night has fallen, lost your way. Little girl, the moon is gone. The sky is late with dawn. Little girl, I'm here to say. Don't run away. Little girl, I know you're scared. The things you bear. So let me tell you, you're okay. That you're in my arms to stay. The walls I built protect me for only so long. Hope I'm upheld. You tell me I'm strong. Little girl, I'm here to say. Don't run away. Little girl, I know you're scared. The things you bear. So let me tell you, you're okay. That you're in my arms to stay. Yes, you are"
i won't give up (the voice performance),"When I look into your eyes. It's like watching the night sky. Or a beautiful sunrise. Well, there's so much they hold. And just like them old stars. I see that you've come so far. To be right where you are. How old is your soul?. Well, I won't give up on us. Even if the skies get rough. I'm giving you all my love. I'm still looking up. And when you're needing your space. To do some navigating. I'll be here patiently waiting. To see what you find. 'Cause even the stars they burn. Some even fall to the earth. We've got a lot to learn. God knows we're worth it. No, I won't give up. I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily. I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make. Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use. The tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake. And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend. For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn. We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in. I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not, and who I am. I won't give up on us. Even if the skies get rough. I'm giving you all my love. I'm still looking up, still looking up. Well, I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up). God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved). We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved). God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it). I won't give up on us.

advice,Don't look down. Cause it's easier falling from force. Just letting it take nature's course. And picking it up when it's over. Don't be afraid. Cause the chances are there for the take. But treasure the choices you make. And know when you must take it slower. You may think you've had it rough. And try to give it up. But when you think you stop. Just go another way. Don't let go of good times. And let the bad ones know you feel fine. And wear your heart out on your sleeve. Cause love is all. Love is all you need. Don't be rushed. Cause hurrying causes mistakes. And make sure to give more than take. And sharing yourself bring you closer. You may think you've had it rough. And try to give it up. But when you think you stop. Just go another way. Don't let go of good times. And let the bad ones know you feel fine. And wear your heart out on your sleeve. Cause love is all you need. Feel with all your senses. Make sure to let down your defenses. There's just one way to make a scene. Love is all. Love is all you need. ooh ooh ooh ooh. ohh ohh oh. Take a chance now. Cause its easy.

Up from the grave He rose again. And as He stands in victory. Sin's curse has lost its grip on me. For I am His and He is mine. Bought with the precious blood of Christ. No guilt in life, no fear in death. This is the power of Christ in me. From life's first cry to final breath. Jesus commands my destiny. No power of hell, no scheme of man. Can ever pluck me from His hand. 'til He returns or calls me home. Here in the power of Christ I'll stand"

But I have grown too strong. To ever fall back in your arms. I've learned to live, half alive. And now you want me one more time. And who do you think you are?. Running 'round leaving scars. Collecting your jar of hearts. And tearing love apart. You're gonna catch a cold. From the ice inside your soul. So don't come back for me. Who do you think you are?. Dear, it took so long just to feel alright. Remember how to put back the light in my eyes. I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed. Cause you broke all your promises. And now you're back. You don't get to get me back. And who do you think you are?. Running around leaving scars. Collecting your jar of hearts. And tearing love apart. You're gonna catch a cold. From the ice inside your soul. So don't come back for me. Don't come back at all. Who do you think you are?. Who do you think you are?. Who do you think you are?"

miley cyrus medley,"When the waves are flooding the shore. (I remember when we kissed?). And I cant find my way home anymore. (I still feel it on my lips). Thats when I, I, I look at you. (The time that you danced with me, oh oh). I probably shouldnt say this. But at times I get so scared. When I think about the previous relationship we shared. It was awesome but we lost it. Its not possible for me not to care. (I had my sights set on you, ready to aim). And now were standing in the rain. But nothing ever gonna change until you hear my dear. (I have a heart that will, never be tamed). (It's the climb). (If we were a movie). Im standing out in the rain. I need to know if its over. (Always gonna be another mountain). Cause I will leave you alone. (It's the climb). (If we were a movie). Flooded with all this pain. Knowing that Ill never hold ya. (Always gonna want to make it move). Like I did before the storm. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-la-la-la. (Always gonna be an uphill battle). Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh. (Sometimes youre gonna have to lose). Feel like hopping on a flight. (I got a crazy feeling). Back to my home town tonight. (Deep inside). Something stops me every time. (I have a way of knowing). We were awesome but we lost it. Its not possible for me, not to care. Breakout let the party start,. Were gonna dance till the dancefloor falls apart. When we kiss Im hypnotized. When I look at you. You get best of both world. Its the climb. Always gonna be another mountain. Throw my hands up, theyre playing my song. If we were a movie, youd be the right guy. Its the climb. You make me laugh, you make me cry. I know its gonna be ok.

the one i crave,"I saw him at the corner store. He gave me candy, I came back for more. I asked for his name, he said call me jakey james. He was 6'2 lots of style, he had the recipe to make you smile. But he got too popular with the girls so I erased him from my world. The next boy was cute and shy. But he never really looked me in the eye. Secretive I was intrigued. He was sweet, his name was pete. (Sweet pete). First time that he took me out, I didn't know what to talk about. So I took the initiative and told pete he had to leave. So I'm back to square one with mr good for nothing john. Ever since he brought me down, I can't get off the ground. It's not like I don't try, and I'm pretty easy on the eye. But the one I really crave, is the one that got away. With each boy he gets worse, but I'm still stuck on the first. Really hate to say, I want the one that got away. He's on the soccer football team, can be found in every girl's dream. We've been talking for a while, you could say that he's on trial. But whenever we're alone, his jaw's like a gramophone. When he goes off the field, with him goes his appeal. So I'm back to square one with mr good for nothing john. Ever since he brought me down, I can't get off the ground. It's not like I don't try, and I'm pretty easy on the eye. But the one I really crave, is the one that got away. With each boy he gets worse, but I'm still stuck on the first. Really hate to say, I want the one that got away. Here she goes again, with another boy on her hands. Word goes around real fast in this small town. All these rumors like I'm a stark, just wanna find someone to give my heart. No luck with james, pete or the football stud. None of them can compare. None of them can compare. To my john. It's not like I don't try, and I'm pretty easy on the eye. But the one I really crave, is the one that got away. With each boy he gets worse, but I'm still stuck on the first. Really hate to say, I want the one that got away. I want the one that got away"
think of you,"It's been awhile, I should be moved on. 'Cause I shouldn't be writing you this song. Haven't crossed my mind for so long. But tonight you're the movie, I want to leave on. Not enough rooms in this house. To hold all the treasures we found. Evidence all surround. Your fingerprints all over who I am now. You. We wished only stars they were ours they remind me of you. I'm still letting you go, I just want you to know. That I think of you, think of you. Think of you, think of you. The space in the back of my mind. I meet you there to reminisce from time to time.

without him,"Right from the start he lured me in. Took me to places I've never been. I think I'm in love. I think I'm in love. He might have bent me but I didn't break. He rearranged the map I made.

Why can't I just try to speak my mind to him. Tell him all the things that he probably thought was coming. But didn't want him thinking that I'm trying to rush it. Please, dear God, give me the words. 'Cause you know my tongue ties. As soon as I see him blushing. I get my thoughts put it on a page. I might get to find a way out of the maze. That I built for myself in some kind of haze. And if the right words come to me one by one. I hope he tells me that he loves me the same. I hope he don't laugh or worse, walk away. 'Cause the honest to God truth of the matter is. I just can't live my life without you. Right from the start he lured me in. Took me to places I've never been. I think I'm in love.

And the honest to God truth of the matter is. I just can't see my life going on without. You!. Now am I crazy? Why can no one understand. That I'll never find a better man. Oh no.
