He looked into her eyes. When she stopped him to ask. If he wanted to dance. He had a face like a mask. Somebody said. From the bible he quote. There was dust on the man in the. Long black coat. Preacher was talking. There’s a sermon he gave. Said every man’s conscience. Is vile and deprave. You can not depend on it. To be your guide. When it’s you. Who must keep it satisfied. It ain’t easy to swallow. It sticks in the throat. She gave her heart to the man in the. Long black coat. One, two. There are no mistakes in life. Some people say. It’s true sometimes. You can see it that way. People don’t live or die. People just float. She gave her heart to the man in the. Long black coat. There’s smoke on the water. It’s been there since June. Tree trunks uprooted. In the high crescent moon. Hear the pulse. And vibration. And the rumblin’ force. Somebody’s out there. Beating on a dead horse. She never said nothin’.

But wonder why the fight is on. But they're bold as love, just as bold as love. Yeah, they're bold as love. Just ask the axis. My red is so confident that he flashes trophies of war,. and ribbons of euphoria. Orange is young and full of daring,. But very unsteady for the first go round. My yellow in this case is not so mellow. In fact I'm trying to say it's frigthened like me. And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from. Giving my life to a rainbow like you. I'm as bold as love, I'm as bold as love. Just as bold as love. Just ask the axis."

The cattle are lowing. The poor Baby awakes. A little Lord Jesus. No crying He makes. I love Thee, Lord Jesus. Look down from the sky. And stay by my side,. 'Til morning is nigh.. Be near me, Lord Jesus,. I ask Thee to stay. Close by me forever. And love me I pray. Bless all the dear children. In Thy tender care. And take us to heaven. To live with Thee there. take us to heaven..."
axis: bold as love,"Axis: Bold As Love. Written by Jimi Hendrix. Anger, he smiles,. towering in shiny metallic purple armour. Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him. Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground. Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted,. They quietly understand. Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready,. But wonder why the fight is on. But they're bold as love, just as bold as love. Yeah, they're bold as love. Just ask the axis. My red is so confident that he flashes trophies of war,. and ribbons of euphoria. Orange is young and full of daring,. But very unsteady for the first go round. My yellow in this case is not so mellow. In fact I'm trying to say it's frigthened like me. And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from. Giving my life to a rainbow like you. I'm as bold as love, I'm as bold as love. Just as bold as love. Just ask the axis."
baby is a butterfly,There's a mansion on the moon. Honey we will be there soon. Into ships our dreams are tossed. Hold my hand and let's get lost. Baby Is a Butterfly. Silken wings and eagle eye. Watch her running up the sky. Oh Baby…is a butterfly. Rivers never stop to rest. Sparrows know that they are blessed. (going forth into the night. Beckoned by the city lights). Baby Is a Butterfly. See her swimming in the sky. Hurts me so to hear her cry. Oh baby…is a butterfly. Staying all day at the fair. Evening primrose in her hair. Everything's a miracle. Now my cup is always full. Baby Is a Butterfly. Silken skin and eagle eye. We'll be angels by and by. Baby…is a butterfly. (alt. verse couplet). Stars are hiding in the clouds. Branches gonna catch them now
baby love,Tender as a peach. someone I would love to teach. Started as a joke. just a lazy little poke. Woke up one sweet day. and I could not run away. Ears will start to bleed. No I cannot take this speed. (chorus). I'm in baby love. I'm in baby love. I'm in baby love again. I was innocent. wonder where your manners went. How was I to know. it would never let me go. Drag it through the mud. will we ever see some blood. You would try to leave. something I can not conceive. (Chorus). I'm in baby love. I'm in baby love. I'm in baby love again. Take me in your fist. prove to me that you exist. Be as plain as day. watch my body melt away. There in black and white. victim of my appetite. Make me understand. do you want to be the man?. (chorus). I'm in baby love. I'm in baby love. I'm in baby love again.

A shepherd on a hillside, while over my flock I bide. On a cold winter night a band of angels sing. In a dream I heard a voice saying ""fear not, come rejoice. It's the end of the beginning, praise the new born king"". How a little baby boy bringing people so much joy. Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light. This must be Christmas, must be tonight. I saw it with my own eyes, written up in the skies. But why a simple herdsmen such as I. And then it came to pass, he was born at last. Right below the star that shines on high.

heart of stone,"Leanin' against the window of a white hotel room. Lookin' down at Dallas, shining in the heat. Honey when you move it's graceful as a pnther. Open up your lips and my heart skips a beat. You suffer so pretty like a ragged apostle. You burn oh so brightly like a soldering gun. And I gave my body and soul to relieve you. But now you have told me that I'm not the one. And if I'm not the one. Baby if I'm not the one. Who's gonna dive down to the floor of the ocean. Who's gonna save you from being alone. Who's gonna hold you when you cry in the nighttime. Who's gonna carry your heart. Your heart of stone. I believed my love. Could chase away your darkness. Was strong enough to fight all the demons in your dreams. (Little did I know the weight would pull me under. Living in your world is so much harder than it seems). Bit if I'm not the one. Baby if I'm not the one. Who's gonna dive down to the floor of the ocean. Who's gonna save you from being alone. Who's gonna hold you when you cry in the nighttime. Who's gonna carry your heart. Your heart of stone. Alt verse lyric. (Little did I know it would pull me under. I watched us both come apart at the seams)"
heat wave,"Whenever I'm with him. Something inside. Starts to burnin'. And I'm filled with desire. Could it be the devil in me. Or is this the way love's supposed to be. Just like a heatwave.

Has my blood pressure got a hold on me. Or is this the way love's supposed to be. Just like a heatwave. Burning in my heart. Can't keep from cryin'. It's tearing me apart. Sometimes I stare in space. Tears all over my face. I can't explain it, don't understand it. I ain't never felt like this before. But that doesn't mean it has me amazed. I don't know what to do, my head's in a haze. Just like a heatwave. Yeah yeah yeah..... Heatwave"

holy waters,"On a pitch black highway lookin’ for a road. Sleepin’ on a stormy bed, honey, who will be your coat. Came to be my drivin’ wheel, you came to be my man. Now you’re rollin’ like a baby boy in the backseat of a van. Holy waters, holy way. Holy waters, sweetest way. Mississippi and Missouri. Where the sun swims with the moon. Rainbows run through chapel rooms. Pourin’ honey by the spoon. In came to bring you watermelon. Bring you scented wine. Now I’m burning up in hot breath. And the rivers rollin’ out of time. Holy waters, holy way. Holy waters, sweetest way. I listen to a seashell out on a purple shore. I heard a song so wild and sweet it moved me to the core. So while the road is dancin’ you let your love know how. Move it like the ocean and the waves from here tonight. Holy waters, holy way. Holy waters, sweetest way. Holy waters, holy way. Holy waters, sweetest way. Holy waters, holy way. Holy waters, sweetest way. Holy waters, holy way. Holy waters, sweetest way"

With a love so sweet in so many ways. I want to stop and thank you baby. I just want to stop and thank you baby. How sweet it is to be loved by you. How sweet it is to be loved by you.

I'm the one who makes you happy,. You got to know that for sure. (can't we give our love just one more try. Make it better than it was before). Did you try to resist. Was she longing to be kissed.

When at last she breaks your heart. Cause the only way to win. Is to get you back again. Until then I'll fall apart. I know what's going on. Alt verse. (You have changed who you are. I been watching from afar)"

i'm just a bill,"GIRL: Whew! You sure gotta climb a lot of steps to get to this Capitol Building here in Washington! But I wonder who that sad little scrap of paper is?. I'm just a bill. Yes, I'm only a bill. And I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill. Well, it's a long, long journey. To the capitol city. It's a long, long wait. While I'm sitting in committee. But I know I'll be a law someday. At least I hope and pray that I will. But today I am still just a bill. GIRL: Gee, Bill, you certainly have a lot of patience and courage!. BILL: Well I got this far. When I started, I wasn't even a bill. I was just an idea. Some folks back home decided they wanted a law passed, so they called their local congressman and he said, 'You're right, there oughta be a law.' Then he sat down and wrote me out and introduced me t Congress, and I became a bill. And I'll remain a bill until they decide to make me a law.. I'm just a bill. Yes I'm only a bill. And I got as far as Capitol Hill. Well, now I'm stuck in committee. And I'll sit here and wait. While a few key congressmen discuss and debate. Whether they should let me be a law. How I hope and pray that they will. But today I am still just a bill. GIRL: Listen to those congressmen arguing! Is all that discussion and debate about you?. BILL: Yeah, I'm one of the lucky ones. Most bills never even get this far. I hope they decide to report on my favorably, otherwise I may die.. GIRL: Die!. BILL: Yeah, die in committee. Ooh! But it looks like I'm gonna live! Now I got the House of Representatives and they vote on me.. GIRL: If they vote yes, what happens?. BILL: Then I got the Senate and the whole thing starts all over again.. GIRL: Oh no!. BILL: Oh yes!. I'm just a bill. Yes, I'm only a bill. And if they vote for me on Capitol Hill. Well, then I'm off to the White House. Where I'll wait in a line. With a lot of other bills. For the President to sign. And he signs me then I'll be a law. How I hope and pray that he will. But today I am still just a bill. GIRL: You mean even if the whole Congress says you should be a law, the President can still say no?. BILL: Yes, that's called a veto. If the President vetoes me, I have to go back to Congress, and they vote on me again, and by that time you're so old.... GIRL: By that time, it's very unlikely that you become a law. It's not easy to become a law, is it?. BILL: No!. But how I hope and pray that I will. But today I am still just a bill. CONGRESSMAN: He signed you, Bill! Now you're a law!. BILL: Right on!"

I woke up and found. That you were gone. Darkness all around me. Blackin’ out the sun. Old friends call me. But I just don't feel like talkin’ to anyone. Emptiness has found me. And it just won't let me go. I go right on livin'. But why I just don't know. Staring down reality. Don't do me no good. 'Cause our misunderstanding. Is too well understood. Such a sad, sad season.

late for the sky,"""Now the words had all been spoken. And somehow the feeling still wasn't right. And still we continued on through the night. Tracing our steps from the beginning. Until they vanished into the air. Trying to understand. How our lives has lead us there. Looking hard into your eyes. There was nobody I'd ever known. Such an empty surprise to feel so alone. Now for me some words come easy. But I know that they don't mean that much. Compared with the things. That are said when lovers touch. You never knew what I loved in you. I don't know what you loved in me. Maybe the picture of somebody. You were hoping I might be. Awake again I can't pretend. And I know I'm alone and close to the end. Of the feeling we've known. How long have I been sleeping. How long have I been drifting. Alone through the night. How long have I've dreaming. I could make it right. If I closed my eyes. And tried with all my might. To be the one you need. Awake again I can't pretend. And I know I'm alone and close to the end. Of the feeling we've known. How long I've been sleeping. How long have I been drifting. Alone through the night. How long have I been running. For that morning flight. Through the whispered promises. And the changing light. Of the bed where we both lie. Late for the sky"""

The winds of change are blowing. wild and free. you ain't seen nothing like me yet. I could make you happy,. make your dreams come true. There is nothing that I wouldn't do. Go to the ends of the earth for you. to make you feel my love."
man in the long black coat,"Crickets are chirping. The water is high. There’s a soft cotton dress on the line. Hang dry. The window’s wide open. African trees. Bent over backwards.

Well you climb in my window. And you painted it gold. It was stone recognition. It was truth being told. And we burn down the Winter. With the fire we possess. And I wish you could know this. Some are sweet, but you were sweeter. Some are sweet, but you were sweeter. Some are sweet, but you were sweeter. Some are sweet, but you were sweeter. Than the rest. And I wish you well. And I wish you well. And I wish you well. Oh I wish you well. Oh I wish you well. And I wish you well. Well well well. Sometimes I wonder. If it's time to go home. But this dream I've been dreaming. Will not leave me alone. I can go where I want to. And I'm doing my best. But I know what I'm losing. Some are sweet, but you were sweeter. Some are sweet, but you were sweeter. Some are sweet, but you were sweeter. Some are sweet, but you were sweeter. Than the rest. Some are sweet, but you were sweeter. Some are sweet, but you were sweeter. Some are sweet, but you were sweeter. Than the rest. Some are sweet, but you were sweeter. Some are sweet, but you were sweeter. Some are sweet, but you were sweeter. Than the rest.

the weight,"Pulled into Nazareth, feeling 'bout half past dead. Just need a place where I can lay my head. Hey mister can you tell me where a girl might find a bed?. He just grinned, shook my hand, 'no' was all he said. Chorus:. Take a load off Fanny. Take a load for free. Take a load off Fanny. and put the load right on me. I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide. When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side. I said, 'Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown'. She said, 'I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around'. Chorus. Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say. It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day. 'Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?'. He said, 'Do me a favor, son, woncha stay an' keep Anna Lee company?'. Chorus. Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog. He said, 'I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog'. I said, 'Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man'. He said, 'That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can'. Chorus. Catch a cannon ball now, t'take me down the line. My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time. To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one. Who sent me here with her regards for everyone."

till i get it right,I’ll just keep on fallin’ in love till I get it right. Right now I’m like a wounded bird hungry for the sky. But if I try my best and try long enough. I’m bound to learn to fly. So I’ll just keep on fallin’ in love till I get it right. My door to love has opened out more times than in. I’m either fool or wise enough to open it again. ‘Cause I’ll never now what’s beyond the mountain. Till I reach the other side. So I’ll just keep on fallin’ in love till I get it right. If practice make perfect then I’m near about as perfect as I’ll. Ever be in my life. I’ll just keep on fallin’ in love till I get it right
time won't tell,"I can’t believe that after all this time. You keep slipping back across my mind. Did we maybe leave a love behind. Afraid of what we felt. Other loves I’ve had have come and gone. I don’t know why they just don’t last too long. There are questions that go on and on but. Time won’t tell. Time won’t tell me how it might have been. And time won’t make what’s wrong alright. It can only take me back again. And re-run all those memories in black and white. I watch us kiss goodbye that day. Here’s where you turned around and walked away. What were the words that would have made you stay. But, time won’t tell. [chorus]. You never see the road you didn’t take. You never feel the love you fail to make. To never know could be the worst mistake. But time won’t tell. No time won’t tell"
to the one i love,To an honest man. I could give my body and my soul. With a practiced hand. You could lift me up and make me whole. To the one I love I give the key. And his eyes are stars that shine on me. And I smell the ocean in the dawn. And the bitter times have come and gone. In a gypsy cab. On the Brooklyn Bridge at sunrise. We are going home. And the lust is flirting in your eyes. To the one I love I give the key. And his eyes are stars that shine on me. And I smell the ocean in the dawn. And the bitter times have come and gone. Have come and gone. Have come and gone. Have come and gone. Lalala. In a hotel room. Up above the lights of Tompkins Square. While the music plays. I'm on my way to meet you there. To the one I love I give the key. And his eyes are stars that shine on me. And I'm back where I belong. And the bitter times have come and gone. Lalala. Ooh. To the one I love I give the key. And his eyes are stars that shine on me. Oh shine on me. Oh shine on me. Oh shine... on me. Oh shine on me. Oh shine on me. Shine on me. Oh shine on me

We are the horse. We are the ride. We are the bird. We're taking flight. You keep me up all night. Oh, don't it seem that it's better than a dream. Every time with you is made of gold.

war,"Chorus:. War. What is it good for?. Absolutely nothing. War, it ain't nothing but a heartbreaker. Friend only to the undertaker. War means tears. To thousands of mothers' eyes. When their sons go out to fight. And their daughters lose their lives in. Chorus. War, it's an enemy of all mankind. The news of war, it breaks my heart and closes my mind.

what becomes of the brokenhearted,"As I walk this land with broken dreams. I have visions of many things. Love's happiness is just an illusion. Filled with sadness and confusion,. What becomes of the broken hearted. Who had love that's now departed?. I know I've got to find. Some kind of peace of mind. Maybe.. The fruits of love grow all around. But for me they come a tumblin' down.. Every day heartaches grow a little stronger. I can't stand this pain much longer. I walk in shadows. Searching for light. Cold and alone. No comfort in sight,. Hoping and praying for someone to care. Always moving and goin to where. What becomes of the broken hearted. Who had love that's now departed?. I know I've got to find. Some kind of peace of mind. Maybe.. I'm searching though I don't succeed,. But someone look, there's a growing need.. Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning,. All that's left is an unhappy ending.. Now what's become of the broken-hearted. Who had love that's now departed?. I know I've got to find. Some kind of peace of mind. I'll be searching everywhere. Just to find someone to care.. I'll be looking everyday. I know I'm gonna find a way. Nothings gonna stop me now. I'll find a way somehow. I'll be searching everywhere. (fade)"

where we start,"Lookin' at your childhood face. On the pillow where you lie. Maybe when a good thing's gone. One is born before our eyes. Standin' here alone in this room with you.

Risin' like a breath of ease. All the world is on our side. All alone in this room with you. All the things you are and all you will be, too. Penetrates, devastates my lonely heart. Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start. Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start. Hand me down my dancing shoes. Hand me down my silver wings. Take me out to town tonight, yes. So I can hear my angels sing. Lying here with you, I raise my eyes. And I pray that time, time, will pass us by. To remain inside the beating of you heart. Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start. Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start. Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start"
who divided,"I get into my car. Turn the radio on. Drive by your house, your window, your bed. Since we’ve been over and done. Ah, but your voice is still ringin’ in my head.

Oh, but I know I can’t stand to feel that chill. Who divided up the days into hours. The hours into minutes. How could they really be that smart?. Who divided up the minutes into seconds?.

In this wild, wild world. Wild, wild world. By the river. ."
