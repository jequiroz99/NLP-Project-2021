this town,Waking up to kiss you and nobody's there. The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air. It's hard. Yesterday I thought I saw. Your shadow running round. It's funny how things never change. In this old town. So far from the stars. And I want to tell you everything. The words I never got to say. The first time around. And I remember everything. From when we were the children. Playing in this fairground. Wish I was there with you now. If the whole world was watching. I'd still dance with you. Drive highways and byways to be there with you. Over and over the only truth. Everything comes back to you. I saw that you moved on with someone new. In the pub that we met. He's got his arms around you. It's so hard. So hard. And I want to tell you everything. The words I never got to say. The first time around. And I remember everything. From when we were the children. Playing in this fairground.

Everything comes back to you. You still make me nervous. When you walk in the room. Them butterflies they come alive. When I'm next to you. Over and over the only truth. Everything comes back to you. And I know that it's wrong. That I can't move on. But there's something about you. If the whole world was watching. I'd still dance with you. Drive highways and byways to be there with you. Over and over the only truth. Everything comes back to you. You still make me nervous. When you walk in the room. Them butterflies they come alive. When I'm next to you. Over and over the only truth. Everything comes back to you. Everything comes back to you

You tell me there are things that you regret. 'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet. It's all I'm asking. Is it too much to ask?. It's all I'm asking. Is it too much to ask?. It's all I'm asking. Is it too much to ask?"
you and me,"I've got a young heart. And it's wild and free. I don't know where it starts. But it ends with you and me. It's a hard road. As far as I can see. I don't know where I'm going. But I'll get back to you and me. 'Cause we're two kids. Trying to start a fight. No matter where we go. Yeah, we'll be alright. All I'm asking for. A bit of patience, please. 'Cause I know what's to come. And it's coming for you and me. Time has never been on our side. So would you wait for me?. I lead a selfish life. 'Cause that's what I need. What do I have to do. To make you believe?. It's all for you and me. From a distance. I can hear you cry. But don't you worry, darlin'. Don't lose sleep tonight. I can promise it. I can guarantee. That at the end of the road. I see you with me. Time has never been on our side. So would you wait for me?. I lead a selfish life. 'Cause that's what I need. What do I have to do. To make you believe?. It's all for you and me. When I look down the line. At the man I wanna be. I've always known from the start. That it ends with you and me"
