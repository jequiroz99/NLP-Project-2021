b√©same mucho,"One time in South America. Met a boy in Colombia. Couldn't understand a word he said. So he took my hand instead. It was late as we ignored the time. Now I can't get this stranger off my mind. I think about him when I wear this dress. I still smell him in my hair. Was it the heat making you sweat. Was it the beat of the drum on my heart and my chest. ""Eres muy bonita"", he says. ""No puedo esperar a verte otra vez"". I can't wait till I see you again. ""B√©same mucho, princesa"". And then we dance. He said, ""b√©same mucho"". He kisses my hand and we dance. It was time for me to say goodbye. Couldn't stand to look him in the eye. Would've kissed him if I had the time. Could've have sworn it was on his mind. Was it his lips, the way he moves his waste. Hands on my hips. Oh just a look of desire on his face. ""Eres muy bonita"", he says. ""No puedo esperar a verte otra vez"". I can't wait till I see you again. ""B√©same mucho, princesa"". And then we dance. He said, ""besame mucho"". He kisses my hand and then I. Close my eyes for a moment in time. In the blink of the night. I see him in the crowd. He was nowhere to be found. When I turned around. But I swear I can still hear him now. ""Eres muy bonita"", he says. ""No puedo esperar a verte otra vez"". I can't wait till I see you again. ""B√©same mucho, princesa"". And then we dance. He said, ""b√©same mucho"". He kisses my hand and we dance. We dance. ""Eres muy bonita"", he says"

And the fears that once controlled me. Can't get to me at all. Up here in the cold thin air I finally can breathe. I know I left a life behind. But I'm too relieved to grieve. Let it go, let it go. Can't hold it back anymore. Let it go, let it go. Turn my back and slam the door. And here I stand. And here I'll stay. Let it go, let it go. The cold never bothered me anyway. Standing frozen in the life I've chosen. You won't find me, the past is so behind me. Buried in the snow. Let it go, let it go. Can't hold it back anymore. Let it go, let it go.

medley: catch me/ don't forget,"Before I fall too fast. Kiss me quick. But make it last. So I can see how badly this will hurt me. When you say goodbye. Keep it sweet. Keep it slow. Let the future pass. And don't let go. But tonight I could fall to soon. Under this beautiful moonlight. But you're so hypnotizing. You've got me laughing while I sing. You've got me smiling in my sleep. And I can see this unraveling. Your love is where I'm falling. But please don't catch me. (...). So now you see. Why I'm scared. I can't open up my heart without a care. But here I go. It's what I feel. And for the first time in my life I know it's real. ----. Did you forget?. That I was even alive. Did you forget?. Everything we ever had. Did you forget. Did you forget. About me?. Did you regret. Ever standing by my side?. Did you forget. What we were feeling inside. Now I'm left. To forget. About us. But somewhere we went wrong. We were once so strong. Our love is like a song. You can't forget it. But somewhere we went wrong. We were once so strong. Our love is like a song. You can't forget it at all. And at last. All the pictures have been burned. All the past. Is just a lesson thats we've learned. I won't forget, please don't forget us. Somewhere we went wrong. Our love is like a song. But you won't sing along. You've forgotten. About us"
