sailing,"Well, it's not far down to paradise. At least it's not for me. And if the wind is right you can sail away. And find tranquility. Oh, the canvas can do miracles. Just you wait and see. Believe me. It's not far to never-never land. No reason to pretend. And if the wind is right you can find the joy. Of innocence again. Oh, the canvas can do miracles. Just you wait and see. Believe me. Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be. Just a dream and the wind to carry me. And soon I will be free. Fantasy, it gets the best of me. When I'm sailing. All caught up in the reverie. Every word is a symphony. Won't you believe me?. Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be. Just a dream and the wind to carry me. And soon I will be free. Well it's not far back to sanity. At least it's not for me. And if the wind is right you can sail away. And find serenity. Oh, the canvas can do miracles. Just you wait and see. Believe me. Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be. Just a dream and the wind to carry me. And soon I will be free"
arthur's theme (best that you can do),"Once in your life you find her. Someone that turns your heart around. And next thing you know you're closing down the town. Wake up and it's still with you. Even though you left her way across town. Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?"". When you get caught between the Moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true. If you get caught between the Moon and New York City. The best that you can do. The best that you can do is fall in love. Arthur he does as he pleases. All of his life, he's mastered choice. Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy. Living his life one day at a time. And showing himself a really good time. Laughing about the way they want him to be. When you get caught between the Moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true. If you get caught between the Moon and New York City. The best that you can do. The best that you can do is fall in love. When you get caught between the Moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true. If you get caught between the Moon and New York City.

forever,"Don't explain yourself. Doesn't matter reasons why. I'd just as soon you leave it never said. I'd just as soon you go. I can feel your sympathy. And there's pity in your eyes. Well, do you think you mean so much to me. Do you think I'll die?. Chorus:. Well you go and you play. But don't ever think a minute. That you took my love away. Well I know, I said a lot of things. But forever really means until the day it ends. That's tonight,. It's gonna be tonight. I've been turned around. And unsure of what to do. But like nature's streams that wash away. We must let it through. Now you just can't disguise. There's a hardness in your eyes. And we'll never know how much we had. Until it's far behind. (Chorus). And I'll remember the days I spent with you. Never to lose (never, never, no). Never, never, no. (Chorus). I know you said a lot of things. But forever really means until the day it ends. (repeat)"
all right,"I know, I know what's on your mind. And I know it gets tough sometimes. But you can give it one more try. Find a reason why. You should pick it up. And try it again. 'Cause it's all right. I think we're gonna make it. I think it might just work out this time. It's all right. I think we're gonna make it. I think it might work out fine this time. It's all right. I think we're gonna make it. I think it might just work out. 'Cause it's not too late for that. Too late for me. I know I've been hurt before. And I know I really shouldn't give any more. But this time. This time things seem just a little different. And when I look in your eyes. You know I can see that it's true. And I hear you say it's. All right. I think we're gonna make it. I think it might just work out this time. It's all right. I think we're gonna make it. I think it might work out fine this time. It's all right. I think we're gonna make it. I think it might just work out. 'Cause it's not too late for that. Too late for love. Just when you feel helpless. Nothing left to say. Love will find us. The past behind us. Then we're on our way. Time and time again I see. People so unsure like me. We all know it gets hard sometimes. You can give it one more try. Find another reason why. You should pick it up. You should kick it up. And try it again."
never be the same,It was good for me. It was good for you. Now nothing either of us can say or do. Can change the way you feel tonight. Sometimes love just slips out of sight. Just one thing before you go. Just one thing that you've got to know. No one will ever touch me that way. The way that you did that very first day. And I'll. Never be the same without you here. I'll live alone. Hide myself behind my tears. And I'll. Never be the same without your love. I'll live alone. Try so hard to rise above. The years go by. There's always someone new. To try and help me forget about you. Time and again it does me no good. Love never feels the way that it should. I loved you then I guess I'll love you forever. And even though I know we could never stay together. I think about how it could have been. If we could just start all over again. And I'll. Never be the same without you here. I'll live alone. Hide myself behind my tears. And I'll. Never be the same without your love. I'll live alone. Try so hard to rise above. It was good for me. It was good for you. Now nothing either of us can say or do. Can change the way you feel today. Sometimes love just slips away. Just one thing before you go. Just one thing that you've got to know. No one will ever touch me that way. The way that you did that very first day. And I'll. Never be the same without you here. I'll live alone. Hide myself behind my tears. And I'll. Never be the same without your love. I'll live alone. Try so hard to rise above

a fisherman's tale,Took my troubles. Down to the sea. Put my ear to a seashell. Inquisitively. Thought I heard a heartbeat. It could have been mine. I guess it doesn't matter. In the grand design. Like a windblown sail. Like a fisherman's tale. There's no end to the glory. Like a windblown sail. Like a fisherman's tale. There's no end to the story. Don't let your vision. Go down with the sun. 'Cause it might be cloudy. When tomorrow comes. Where the winds of a heart. Meet the wiles of a mind. There will be stillness. At the waterline. When I was young and time was free. I thought the world was reaching out for me. I believed I could. I believed I would. Live forever and ever. Took my troubles. Down to the sea. Put my ear to a seashell. Inquisitively
ride like the wind,It is the night. My body's weak. I'm on the run. No time to sleep. I've got to ride. Ride like the wind. To be free again. And I've got such a long way to go. To make it to the border of Mexico. So I'll ride like the wind. Ride like the wind. I was born the son of a lawless man. Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand. Lived nine lives. Gunned down ten. Gonna ride like the wind. And I've got such a long way to go. To make it to the border of Mexico. So I'll ride like the wind. Ride like the wind. Accused and tried and told to hang. I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang. Never was the kind to do as I was told. Gonna ride like the wind before I get old. It is the night. My body's weak. I'm on the run. No time to sleep. I've got to ride. Ride like the wind. To be free again. And I've got such a long way to go. To make it to the border of Mexico. So I'll ride like the wind. Ride like the wind

alibi,It's a calm wind blowing on my skin. And I've been dreaming again. Now that we're all here. We can share these notes and all this madness. We can talk of innocence. And of all the things we believe in. Is it an alibi. Is it the reason why. Is it the way we really feel inside. Set it free. . The magic of those nights brings me closer to that light. That helps me see the path ahead of me. I can feel that something. A hint of mystery. A trace of dare. To live the truth I hide somewhere. . Daybreak. In a place I've known before. Will I find me behind that final door. . I can hear the footsteps of the past. I can feel the thunder and it's coming fast. I'm gonna spend some time with the moon. Pour myself a glass of midnight. Keep myself in tune. . Is it an alibi. Is it the tears I cry. Is it the way I see it through your eyes. . The magic of those nights brings me closer to that light. That helps me see the path ahead of me. I can feel that something. A hint of mystery. A trace of dare. To live the truth I hide somewhere.
never stop believing,Every night in my window. I see pictures of the day we met. I keep wishing on the falling stars. To forget you but it hasn't happened yet. And I still remember when you walked away. It was more than my heart could believe. Careless wind blew the smell of your perfume away. But the touch of you. It never leaves. . So I'll never stop believing. Someday your love is coming back to me. No I'll never stop believing. Someday that you'll be coming back to me. . Everybody in my life. They say forget that girl. She's gone for good. How can I explain this heart. It just keeps hanging on. Cause something says it should. . Oh I go on remembering how good we were. The sweetest days I'll ever know. This careless boy. Somehow he let you get away. But the touch of you. He'll never let it go. . Time and time again I see. Just how much she meant to me. Oh a love like that is meant to be. She's got to come back. She's got to come back.
love is love (in any language),"Checkin' out the sand streets. Of this island town. Got my cold Dos Equis. Watchin' women brown. They call it Paradiso. It looks like paradise. And it's looking better all the time. Now I'm dancin' in the moonlight. The party's everywhere. It's all a sweet seduction. To the rhythm in the air. Local girls are talkin'. I hear their bodies say. This boy won't be leavin' lonely. It's je t'aime, it's amore. Te quiero, mi chica. If it's good, you'll get the message. It's je t'aime, it's amore. Eu te amo. Love is love in any language.

back of my mind,I woke up to my world this morning. Took a long look in the looking glass. Last night I guess I had one or too many. Somebody tried to tell me I had no class. What ever happened to me. Maybe I've been living on lies. Never really had a dream come true. Then again I guess I never really tried. . Now the years all slip away. And things are like they're gonna stay. All the roads I didn't take are just. One more thing in the back of my mind. Taking space and time. . Wish I'd finished that book I never started. Maybe that's the story of my life. Should've learned to play that saxophone. So I could tell my song to the streetlight. . Shouldn't have been so stuck on my own. Could've had a wife and a child. Should've made that house a home. I don't know why my life is so wild. . Now the years all slip away. And things are like they're gonna stay. All the chances I didn't take are just. One more thing in the back of my mind. Taking space and time. One more thing in the back of my mind. . So I'm thinking about a walk in the sunlight. I've got to get my shadow behind me. Try and make some sense of it all. With my feet on the ground and my heart still free. . As the years will slip away. I'll let the cards fall where they may. And all the roads I didn't take will be just. One more thing in the back of my mind. . As the years will slip away. And the cards fall as they may. All the chances I didn't take will be just. One more thing in the back of my mind. Taking space and time. One more thing in the back of my mind. One more thing in the back of my mind.
any old time,Everyone maybe once or twice. Finds a friend that's a friend for life. Somebody who believed in me like you. From those days of childhood fights. Through the nights when we'd ask advice. All of those times when nobody else would do. Any old time that you wanna hear from me. To find your way or kick around a memory. Like the old times. Any old time will do. . I can tell when the telephone rings. It's gonna be you just to talk about things. It's funny how it seems to happen when you're on my mind. Every time good love goes bad. When I can't believe the luck I've had. All of those times I'm glad you're a friend of mine. . Any old time that you need to call on me. To find your way or kick around those memories. Like the old times. Any old time will do. . Don't you ever forget. Any old time when the road is getting rough to climb. And you think maybe you've had enough. Just like the old times. Any old time you're blue. . All at once I went and got a hunch. Everything we ever felt was true. As we find the years behind us and we live the years ahead. Let's remember laughter and all the words we said. . Make new friends and keep the old. One is silver and the other one's gold. Something Sally said that stuck in my head. And I never wanna let it go. . Any old time that you need to lean on me. I'll be there -- you can dream on me. Just like the old times. Any old time will do.
baby says no,Baby says no. She can't let go this soon. Doesn't feel right. Not tonight. Even though I gave her the stars and the moon. I really think I've got it bad this time around. Baby says yes. But I must confess. It really doesn't seem to matter. 'Cause I'd follow that girl all around the world. Even if I never had her. I really think I've got it bad this time around. Gonna show 'em what love can do. Gonna tell 'em 'bout me and you. Gonna show 'em what love can do when it's right. And this time it's right. Love is the light that can shine so bright. But sometimes it fades away. Then you find one that can shine like the sun. And she comes up for you every day. I really think I've got it bad this time around. Oh when the girl is so far away. I can't think of all the right words to say. But now she's here and we are all together
save your sadness,"Lost in the future. Worried about the past. Willful and lazy. Pedaling nowhere fast. She works her wonders. Keeping me in today. Reaching through my darkness. Reminding me how to play. . And she says. Save your sadness for the bad times. Time is not your enemy. Save your sadness for the bad times. For now you are with me. Nothing is certain. Certainly nothing new. Hoping some light shines. On us before we are through. She spends her heartbeats. Seeing the best in you. As I learn my mind the more I find. The things she says are true. . And she says. Save your sadness for the bad times. Time is not your enemy. Save your sadness for the bad times. For now you are with me. You live gracefully. Having faith in me. And she says. Save your sadness for the bad times. Time is not your enemy. Save your sadness for the bad times. For now, for now. Save your sadness for the bad times. For now you are with me"
i'll be alright,"I'll be alright. I'm a man with his mind in motion. I'll be alright. I've got the will to live. I'll be alright. I'm a man with his mind in motion. I'm gonna give it all I've got to give. What's happening. Yeah me too. Just can't seem to shake those ordinary blues. One thing I can tell you. Hold your spirit tight. Something's on the move. It's gonna be alright. On the way down to paradise. I kept stepping on my wings. The tears, the time, the trouble. I had to take a stand. I found my way to land. I'm gonna be alright. Sometimes I think I live by miracles alone. Click those ruby slippers and hope to be back home. Say just where I'll find you. And that's just where I'll be. Building me an igloo by the sea"
the light is on,Is it yours. Is it mine. I was never the kind who could draw the line. Are you free. Unforgiven. Is this the kind of world you could live in. It's alright. The light is on. The darkness has run to hide. It's alright. The light is on. But the darkness is just outside. Outside your window. . Beating down. Making the sound of the rain. Drive you crazy. Make you lazy. You know it's only the rain.
talking in my sleep,Talking in my sleep. She ain't gonna hear it. So my secrets have to keep. A little while longer. In my heart where they've been. For so long I can't remember. Days turn into weeks. Still she's not with me. Still my secrets have to keep. A little while longer. In my heart where they've been. For so long I can't remember. . And I know that I'm just gonna be. Another page in love's history. Another page in your diary. In that old book of love. . Love can cut you deep. It's there to remind you. And the memories make you weak. They whisper to you. From your heart where they've been. For so long you can't remember. . Wake up. Reach for her. She's not there. All I do is dream. Dream that she will come home soon. To me.
open up my window,Every night. I open up my window. Open up my window. And let your love come in. Every night that I'm away from you. This old bed seems way too big. And my dreams so small. Goin' through the motions. As I stare out from my room. I begin to realize. That we're sharin' the same moon. Lying here hugging my pillow in the dark. Dreaming of your comfort. Fightin' the lonely in my heart. And I thought I felt you touch me. In that old familiar way. When the wind came through the curtains. And I heard it call your name. Ooh the time goes draggin' by. Send my love across the sky. Maybe it's all that I can do. Baby until I'll be with you. I missed you girl more than you'll ever know. I kept a little vigil by my window. It's funny but it's true. Darlin' I did the same for you. Now no matter where we are. We can wish upon that star
when she smiles,Well they met in line at the checkout stand. Both unaware of what the gods had planned. She was lost in her Cosmo readin' about the stars. He was readin' about two-headed babies from Mars. When she reached for a Snickers she dropped her keys. And so began one of life's mysteries. He was a little old-fashioned and a little oversexed. He picked them up never guessing what would happen next. Then she smiled and said I like your tie. Yeah she smiled and told him that little white lie. And his soul lit up like the fourth of July. When she smiled. They made it to Starbuck's just before it closed. He pointed to the jar and said you want one of those. So over biscotti and double decafs. They shared their stories and they had some laughs. He got up his courage and asked her back to his place. Then he held his breath as he studied her face. She just sat and she stared and she said nothing at all. He knew he blew it and he waited for the ax to fall. Then she smiled and he knew he hadn't been wrong. Yeah she smiled and said what took you so long. And the world felt good like a rock and roll song. When she smiled. When she smiles I forget my lines. When she smiles man I'm on cloud nine. When she smiles oh it's time out of mind. When she smiles. Then she smiled and said where you been all my life. And she smiled when he asked her to be his wife. And the future had never looked so bright. When she smiled. I'm just diggin' her diggin' me diggin' her. When she smiles I forget my lines. When she smiles man I'm on cloud nine. When she smiles oh it's time out of mind. When she smiles. When she smiles I come all undone. When she smiles I'm the only one. When she smiles I'm a smoking gun. When she smiles.
someday,"Here's a song for the hearts so lonely. The ones who feel that love won't come. Looking to find that one and only. I've got something to say to you. You see the lovers walking down the street. You feel your life's a little incomplete. I know what you mean and I'm here to tell you. Wipe the tears from your eyes. You know I would not lie. . Save your love for someday, girl. Someday will come soon. Save your love for someday, girl. Someday will come soon. . You give your love away to someone new. Just so you can say that he belongs to you. You smile and you laugh and you talk of forever. I'm not so sure that it's true. . Don't give up on love. Someday will come soon. . After you've found that dream you treasure. After the chill has left the air. All of the pieces will come together. The things that two can share. But only time can take you there."
no time for talk,Well I read it in town in the melancholy news. The front page story is our love is through. The hand of time is cold -- I can't stand to hear the truth. Somehow I won't believe it 'til I've heard it from you. But there's no time for talk. And there's no place for tears. There's no reason to wonder after all of these years. Sure we had some good times. And so who's to blame. It's so hard to tell when you both feel the pain. . After the years have come and gone. The struggle to forget you will have just begun. We had our ups and downs but one thing's for sure. No one will ever love you more.

all right,"I know, I know what's on your mind. And I know it gets tough sometimes. But you can give it one more try. Find a reason why. You should pick it up. And try it again. 'Cause it's all right.

And try it again."

I know it's hard to believe. Nobody means you no harm. All the angry young men. All the lonely young girls. Caught in a web of confusion. In an unintended world
any old time,Everyone maybe once or twice. Finds a friend that's a friend for life. Somebody who believed in me like you. From those days of childhood fights. Through the nights when we'd ask advice. All of those times when nobody else would do. Any old time that you wanna hear from me. To find your way or kick around a memory. Like the old times. Any old time will do. . I can tell when the telephone rings. It's gonna be you just to talk about things. It's funny how it seems to happen when you're on my mind. Every time good love goes bad. When I can't believe the luck I've had. All of those times I'm glad you're a friend of mine. . Any old time that you need to call on me. To find your way or kick around those memories. Like the old times. Any old time will do. . Don't you ever forget. Any old time when the road is getting rough to climb. And you think maybe you've had enough. Just like the old times. Any old time you're blue. . All at once I went and got a hunch. Everything we ever felt was true. As we find the years behind us and we live the years ahead. Let's remember laughter and all the words we said. . Make new friends and keep the old. One is silver and the other one's gold. Something Sally said that stuck in my head. And I never wanna let it go. . Any old time that you need to lean on me. I'll be there -- you can dream on me. Just like the old times. Any old time will do.
arthur's theme (best that you can do),"Once in your life you find her. Someone that turns your heart around. And next thing you know you're closing down the town. Wake up and it's still with you. Even though you left her way across town. Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?"". When you get caught between the Moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true. If you get caught between the Moon and New York City. The best that you can do. The best that you can do is fall in love. Arthur he does as he pleases. All of his life, he's mastered choice. Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy. Living his life one day at a time. And showing himself a really good time. Laughing about the way they want him to be. When you get caught between the Moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true. If you get caught between the Moon and New York City. The best that you can do. The best that you can do is fall in love. When you get caught between the Moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true. If you get caught between the Moon and New York City.

baby says no,Baby says no. She can't let go this soon. Doesn't feel right. Not tonight. Even though I gave her the stars and the moon. I really think I've got it bad this time around. Baby says yes. But I must confess. It really doesn't seem to matter. 'Cause I'd follow that girl all around the world. Even if I never had her. I really think I've got it bad this time around. Gonna show 'em what love can do. Gonna tell 'em 'bout me and you. Gonna show 'em what love can do when it's right. And this time it's right. Love is the light that can shine so bright. But sometimes it fades away. Then you find one that can shine like the sun. And she comes up for you every day. I really think I've got it bad this time around. Oh when the girl is so far away. I can't think of all the right words to say. But now she's here and we are all together
back of my mind,I woke up to my world this morning. Took a long look in the looking glass. Last night I guess I had one or too many. Somebody tried to tell me I had no class. What ever happened to me. Maybe I've been living on lies. Never really had a dream come true. Then again I guess I never really tried. . Now the years all slip away. And things are like they're gonna stay. All the roads I didn't take are just. One more thing in the back of my mind. Taking space and time. . Wish I'd finished that book I never started. Maybe that's the story of my life. Should've learned to play that saxophone. So I could tell my song to the streetlight. . Shouldn't have been so stuck on my own. Could've had a wife and a child. Should've made that house a home. I don't know why my life is so wild. . Now the years all slip away. And things are like they're gonna stay. All the chances I didn't take are just. One more thing in the back of my mind. Taking space and time. One more thing in the back of my mind. . So I'm thinking about a walk in the sunlight. I've got to get my shadow behind me. Try and make some sense of it all. With my feet on the ground and my heart still free. . As the years will slip away. I'll let the cards fall where they may. And all the roads I didn't take will be just. One more thing in the back of my mind. . As the years will slip away. And the cards fall as they may. All the chances I didn't take will be just. One more thing in the back of my mind. Taking space and time. One more thing in the back of my mind. One more thing in the back of my mind.
"been there, done that",You've seen my face. Hey don't you know my name. It wasn't all that long ago i had my fifteen minutes of fame. If it was you caught in a crazy game. Would you still look as good standing in the rain. Whatever gets you through the night. Take it from me -- it's gonna be alright. Been there done that. Been there -- then somebody takes you back. Been there done that. So hard hard to avoid the trap. They break your heart -- why do we let them in. The drug is strong but the will is weak. We make the same mistakes again. There comes a time we all gotta rise above. Look inside and redefine just what it is we want from love. Been there done that. Been there -- still working my way back. Been there done that. So hard hard to avoid the trap. And when you feel strong enough to face up to it. You're gonna do just fine
before i go,I look out on the city lights. The guarded streets below. I marvel at my history. The things that I don't know. Just another question. A shadow on my soul. Will there be time. Will there be time before I go. I left home in a hurry. Off to see the world. Then I played some music. Then I loved a girl. Someone called me papa. Took my breath away. Would I be fine. Would I be alright with just today. Will there be time enough for me before I go. Love without rules. Love without end. Sending a lofty prayer for peace out on the wind. Breaking the curse. Breaking the chain...... Making a promise I won't have to make again. I look out on the city lights. The stories that they tell. And wonder at my destiny. Beyond this carousel. Such a hollow question. A tether frayed by fear. Will there be time. Time to let go while I'm here. Will there be time enough for me so I'll know. Will there be time enough for me before I go. .

charm the snake,"You gotta keep a straight face. When you're playin' the fool. You gotta wear a smile. When you're breakin' the rules. You gotta charm that snake now, baby. You gotta be smooth,you gotta be quick. I think it might just help. To be a little bit sick. You know the bite can't cut you. If the skin is thick. You gotta charm that snake now, baby. Hey, we ain't all good lookin'. Ain't no reason to take a good lickin'. The clock on the wall's. Gonna keep on tickin'. Charm that snake now, baby. Don't let go of it. Don't let go. You gotta charm that snake. You gotta charm that snake. One stripe, two stripes. What does it mean. The venom is lethal. But the meat is clean. The best take advantage of you like a machine. You gotta charm that snake now, maybe. Don't let the fingernails. Under the heart. If they get a good grip. They're gonna rip it apart. The first and last kisses. Are the dangerous part. You gotta charm that snake now, maybe. There's a hook in the bait. The first one made a mistake. If you've got what it takes. You better charm that snake. You gotta let it show. You ain't gonna let it go. I'm gonna let 'em know. I'm never gonna let it go"
curled up around the world,Life is a long road - everyone knows it. Nothing is ever the way that you suppose it. The window blows open the moment you close it. And hatred finds a way into your heart.. Living escapes us - lost in our labors. Doing our damage and blaming our neighbors. Praying to paper and begging for favors. And hatred finds a way into our hearts.. Picture a place where your love makes a difference. Where silence has meaning and the noble run free. Cradle the dream of your sisters and brothers. Arms gently curled around the world. We can relinquish the sorrows that hold us. Taking our strength back from those we let control us. Letting acceptance and mercy enfold us. And clear the path for love to find a way into our hearts. Picture a place where your love makes a difference. Where silence has meaning and the noble run free. Cradle the dream of your sisters and brothers. Arms gently curled around the world. We can find the way to hold this world inside our hearts. Picture a place where your love makes a difference. Where silence has meaning and the noble run free. Cradle the dream of your sisters and brothers. Arms gently curled around the world. I will remember my love makes a difference. And try to recall that it all begins with me. Cradle the dream of a sweet ever after. With arms gently curled around the world. Arms gently curled around the world. It all could come true...
deal 'em again,You pick up the cards that they're dealing to you. You can throw down or showdown. The bluff makes a fool out of you. The ante goes up and your luck runs down. It's a strange game. It's a damn shame. But somebody's going to lose. It don't matter -- lose or win. You can deal 'em again. A handful of hearts and you're playing to win. It goes down and you're put down. And that takes it all out of you. One last hand and you're going for broke. The cards fall and you take all. Just when you thought you were through. It don't matter -- lose or win. You can deal 'em again. . You pick up the cards that they're dealing to you. You can throw down or showdown. When love makes a fool out of you.
deputy dan,Deputy Dan. Just another pure heart. A wide open mind. Driftin' like a cork on a sea of dreams. Playin' the school boy. Makin' believe. Dyin' to fill the shoes. The really big shoos for the TV screams. Chorus:. Standing on the sidelines when I was a kid. Talkin' bout the heroes and the war. Living on the frontlines wasn't quite the same. Something deep inside of me had changed. Dedicated upstart entourage. In the garage. four crazy Juveniles. Burnin' up the midnight miles. The gigs. The juke box guinea pigs. Spending our prime. Hey man. Honkey-tonk women just one more time. Chorus:. Took a ride on the wild wind. And lost myself an old friend'. Don't ask me now if I'd do it again.
dream too loud,"While I wait for the world to end. Above mad hatter crowds. I have nothing but time to spend. Silhouetting clouds. Simple pleasures fr goodness sake. Babes in slumbers. Nature's palette an daybreak,. Paint by numbers. Tat tvram asi. Barefoot down at the fishin'hole. Minnows nibble my toes. Big rock holding a bamboo pole. Don't care how is goes. Origami my lists away. Bird and flower. On a river of wind they play. Peace and power. Tat tvram asi. I'm just looking to find some spring. Plant some seeds grow some wings. Don't tell me I dream too loud I knos. (I know, I know). Just imagine a smile on your face. Love and laughter. Compassion breaking our fall from grace. Ever after. Tat tvram asi. I'm just looking to take those wings. Fly to Memphis and meet the king. Don't tell me I dream too lous I know. (I know, I know)"
driftin' away,The clock is screaming and it's time to go. The day is waiting and you're moving slow. News and weather on the radio. But your mind keeps driftin' away. Work is steady and your friends are good. You're going forward like you think you should. You'd put your heart into it if you could. But your mind keeps driftin' away. Look at your world through the windowpane. Embrace that secret thing that keeps you sane. You're always saying that you can't complain. But your mind keeps driftin' away. And your mind keeps driftin' away. The conversation turns to seeds you've sown. It gets you thinkin' 'bout someone you've known. She's always with you but she's still alone. And your mind keeps driftin' away. We make excuses but you know damn well. A dream's a story only you can tell. You've tasted heaven and you've been through hell. But your mind keeps driftin' away. And your mind keeps driftin' away. Another sunset another dawn. Hard to distinguish where the lines are drawn. Hard to imagine where the time has gone. You might discover you're where you belong. When your mind is driftin' away. And your mind keeps driftin' away. We make excuses but you know damn well. A dream's a story only you can tell. You've tasted heaven and you've been through hell. But your mind keeps driftin' away. And your mind keeps driftin' away. And your mind keeps driftin' away
every turn of the world,"We think about the loves we lost. Will it come again. We think of all the things we want. Will we ever win. We listen to the voice of children. Will they find their way. Keep an open heart. The answer to it all's a wish away. Never let the tears you're cryin' blind you. To the dream that's waitin' to find you. 'Cause there's one more chance. With every turn of the world. Is it gold or glory. A taste of freedom. Or the strong warm touch of a body. There are all these things with every turn of the world. Human kindness -- diamond of the heart. Tearing down the old walls. As long as we can share. Desire's not a sin, after all. When you find yourself alone. Missing tender magic touching you. Keep an open heart. Everything you dream can still be true. We all want a world we can live in. We all want a world full of love. It's never too late. It's never too soon. Whatever you can do is enough"
forever,"Don't explain yourself. Doesn't matter reasons why. I'd just as soon you leave it never said. I'd just as soon you go. I can feel your sympathy. And there's pity in your eyes. Well, do you think you mean so much to me. Do you think I'll die?. Chorus:. Well you go and you play. But don't ever think a minute. That you took my love away. Well I know, I said a lot of things. But forever really means until the day it ends. That's tonight,. It's gonna be tonight. I've been turned around. And unsure of what to do. But like nature's streams that wash away. We must let it through. Now you just can't disguise. There's a hardness in your eyes. And we'll never know how much we had. Until it's far behind. (Chorus). And I'll remember the days I spent with you. Never to lose (never, never, no). Never, never, no. (Chorus). I know you said a lot of things. But forever really means until the day it ends. (repeat)"
hunger,Out of this island. Far from the cage that most will know. Nothing was sacred. No other footprints in the snow. You took me down girl. Down to a place where I don't go. Now I hunger for you. Baby I hunger for you. The trace of you on my fingers. Laughs at the rain. Opiiate angel. The jones in my vein. Something so desperate inside. Somthing I just can't explain. Baby I hunger for you. Baby I hunger for you. Holding on to something pure. Holding on to something pure. Out of this island. The wind in my soul is never still. This weathered asylum. Just can't keep out the chill. I'm scared that I'll find you. I'm scared even more I never will. Baby I hunger for you. Baby I hunger for you
i know you well,A good fight half won. A good scotch half gone. And I'll never win Mr Congeniality. I bd's once again. She acquiesced. And I got off on a technicality. I've always loved our little wars. Treaties we sign behind closed doors. I may concede but I will not bleed. I will not bleed. The James Deam the prom queen. Impractical fascination. Having its way again. She knows Astaire's got nothing on me. When I take her out tonight. When I take her out tonight. I've always loved the way you dance. How you defy our circumstance. There may not be more than see. More than I see. C'est la vie. I know you well (You know me well). I know you well (You know me well). I know you well boy. And before the dawn comes you'll be gone. It's symbiotic. It's a sweet narcotic. Not a futile search for romantic perfection. That's too much trouble. So make mine a double. My head's a very scary neighborhood. Don´t wanna walk it alone. Thought I had something to day. Before you kissed my neck that way. I'll let it be. That works for me. So C'est la vie. C'est la vie. I know you well (You know me well). I know you well (You know me well). I know you well boy. And before the dawn comes you'll be gone. You know me well (I know you well). You know me well (I know you well). I know you well girl. And tomorrow we might just move on
i really don't know anymore,What do you think about love. Is it a game to be played. To be torn and lost in the wilderness. To be lost. And lonely after all. What do you think about love. Is it a way to be saved. To feel the warmth of another love. To be lost. And lonely after all. . I really don't know anymore. I really can't say. I really don't know anymore. I'm just that way. .

i will (take you forever),I was a man who always played around in love. so quick to take. but so afraid to give enough.. But now. I've found the one. and heaven will only know. what only my eyes can say and time can't take away.. I was a girl who trusted no one with my heart. and the dreams that young girls dream were just vanishing in the. dark.. But now. I've found the one. and heaven will only know. what only my eyes can say. they say -. That I will take you forever. and there will never be anyone else in my heart but you.. And I will take you forever. and there will never be anyone else but you. anyone else but you..

That I will take you forever. ....
i'll be alright,"I'll be alright. I'm a man with his mind in motion. I'll be alright. I've got the will to live. I'll be alright. I'm a man with his mind in motion. I'm gonna give it all I've got to give. What's happening. Yeah me too. Just can't seem to shake those ordinary blues. One thing I can tell you. Hold your spirit tight. Something's on the move. It's gonna be alright. On the way down to paradise. I kept stepping on my wings. The tears, the time, the trouble. I had to take a stand. I found my way to land. I'm gonna be alright. Sometimes I think I live by miracles alone. Click those ruby slippers and hope to be back home. Say just where I'll find you. And that's just where I'll be. Building me an igloo by the sea"
in a red room,"Show me what you brought me. Silk and nothing more. Let the light discover you. Fall into the pillows. Let me watch you play. Sharing all your secrets. Take my breath alway. Learn you like a blind man. Taste you soft and deep. Slow and gentle torture. Pray the lord your soul to keep. Take the night inside you. Let the fires dance. Planets spin their fortunes. Lost inside our trance. In a Red Room. Where love takes no prisoners. Ancient ballets of shadow perform. Here we lie in a sweet saturnalia. Here we will ride out the storm. On and on passlon plays surround us. Toying with the histories of man. On and on, taboos will not confound us. Naked in a jungle by Gauguin. On and on passlon plays surround us. Toying with the histories of man. On and on taboos will not confound us. I will look at you and understand. In a Red Room. Where love takes no prisoners. Ancient ballets of shadow perform. Here we lie in a sweet saturnalia. Here we will ride out the storm. In a Red Room. Where love takes no prisoners. We will drink from this cup til we die. Out of body in sweet saturnalia. Ever alive you and I"
in the blink of an eye,She said baby baby. I know what you want and I'm sure. That it's time for you to try. And get yourself the things that are yours. 'Cause it could be gone in the blink of an eye. It could be dawn in the blink of an eye. Isn't it time that you reached for the sky. And let yourself go. I been crazy baby. I know what you mean and I swear. That if there's a song in the night. You know I've gotta hear it out there. 'Cause it could be gone in the blink of an eye. It could be dawn in the blink of an eye. Isn't it time that you reached for the sky. And let yourself go. There's a fire deep inside. I said baby baby. Let's steal the moon and let love have it's way. Burning like a falling star until we are. A million miles away. It could be gone in the blink of an eye. It could be dawn in the blink of an eye. Isn't it time that you reached for the sky. And let yourself go now. There's a fire deep inside. Let yourself go now. And forget the fears you hide. Let yourself go now. And forget the tears you cried. And when you needed me. Did I just turn away. And when I spoke my heart. Is there something I forgot to say
is there something,Lately I see clouds of sorrow in your eyes. Some deep sadness you can never quite disguise. Now I'm scared to ask what it's leading to. But I'm more afraid of not asking you. Is there something that you want to tell me. Is there something that I ought to know. Are we something that's still worth fighting for. Or should I simply let you go. Is there something I can do to reach you. Are we something more than history. I'll find some way to convince you to stay. If you just tell me honestly. Is there something left of you and me. You've got secrets you've been keeping for too long. And I'm going crazy acting like there's nothing wrong. I can taste the truth every time we kiss. And I can't go on. At least not like this. I don't want to lose you. But what's the use of holding on. I don't really have you. If the feeling's gone. Is there something I can do to reach you. Are we something more than history. If there's no way to convince you to stay. And be the way we used to be. Then there's something that I want to tell you. And I want you to believe it's true. We had something that I'll never forget. Even if I wanted to. 'Cause part of me will always be with you.
isn't it love,Maybe things are not what they seem. And baby we know it. I feel like I`m wakin` up out of a dream. And we both want to control it. I don`t wanna make a wrong move. I don`t wanna lose a good groove. So baby let`s talk about it. Baby let`s think. Isn`t it love. Isn`t it love that we are feeling. Isn`t it love. Isn`t it love. Isn`t it time we stop concealing. Isn`t it love. We don`t have to love by the rules. So baby enjoy it. Bein` a fool for love don`t make us fools. Don`t let anyone destroy it. You need a home to run to. You need to have your fun too. So baby let`s talk about it. Baby let`s think. Isn`t it love. Isn`t it love that we are feeling. Isn`t it love. Isn`t it love. Isn`t it time we start revealing. Isn`t it love. And from the dawn of time. People lookin` for souls that rhyme. People lookin` people lookin` for souls that rhyme. But when our worlds collide. You gotta see it from a different side somehow. You just gotta say. We don`t wanna make a wrong move. We don`t wanna lose a good groove. So baby let`s talk about it. Talk to me and tell me how you feel. Can we really live without it. Baby let`s think. Isn`t it love. Isn`t it love that we are feeling. Isn`t it love. Isn`t it love. Isn`t it time we start the healing. Isn`t it love
it's always something,It's always something. It's always something there to spoil your day. It's always something made out of nothing. But it gets its way. My AOL went down again. They're starving in Zaire. Close your eyes and count to ten. The sky is falling dear. It's always something. Something you're waiting that will make you whole. Some piece of nothing you need so badly. That youl'd sell your soul. How many inches is your screen. Are the images too clear. Just channel surf the news away. The sky is falling. Your god is calling. I may not know it. I may not see. It's always something messin' with me. I may not like it but it will be. And if I fight it'll never be free. There's always something we could be learning. From those windmill fores. It's always someone you least expected. Who really knows. That there's no better time or place. To read between the lines on your face. Stop choking on that grain of salt. The sky's not falling. We've just been staling. I may not know it. I may not see. It's always something messin' with me. I may not like it but it will be. And if I fight it'll never be free
jan's tune,Lost in the future. Worried about the past. Willful and lazy. Pedaling nowhere fast. She works her wonders. Keeping me in today. Reaching through my darkness. Reminding me how to play. And she says. Save your sadness for the bad times. Time is not your enemy. Save your sadness for the bad times. For now you are with me. Nothing is certain. Certainly nothing new. Hoping some light shines. On us before we`re through. She spends her heartbeats. Seeing the best in you. As I learn my mind the more I find. The things she says are true. You live gracefully. Having faith in me. She says. Save your sadness for the bad times. Time is not your enemy. Save your sadness for the bad times. For now. Save your sadness for the bad times. For now you are with me
just one look,"On the outback, a fool for the wind. Forgot to count my blessings again. The road looks lonely, I could use a friend. Looking for somebody to forgive my sins. And just one look in your eyes. Before I go so I'll know. Somebody loves me. . All the wise men, all the years. Looking for the answer in a roomful of mirrors. A dark companion, the one called fear. Take the holy water wash away the tears. . One hope I will find. The harmony of heart and mind. So I will know. The way to give as I live. . And I know there will be. A certain amount of uncertainty. But I must know. That you are there to hear my prayers. . One wish there will be. In this place a time for me. When I will know. Before I go. Somebody loves me. Just one look in your eyes. Before I go so I'll know. Somebody loves me. . All the wise men, all the years. Looking for the answer in a roomful of mirrors. A dark companion, the one called fear. Take the holy water wash away the tears. . One hope I will find. The harmony of heart and mind. So I will know."
kind of i love you,"I've been thinkin' how to say. What I think I'm supposed to say. To make you sure that I am worth your time. Your friends all tell you it's not true. I got no business here with you. I'm just not the man they had in mind. They may be right but it's too late now. I want you to see the best in me. So baby turn the lights down low. Won't you hold me, kiss me, stroke me, please me. Tell me I'm the perfect man. But if you ask me how I feel about you. It's kind of hard to understand. It's kind of I love you. It's kind of I need you. It's kind of I want you. It's kind of I don't know what I want. It's kind of I love you. It's kind of I need you. It's kind of I want you. It's kind of I don't know who I am. All my life I've spent my time. Falling in and out of love. And I always run when I find me one. I'm supposed to see the meaning of. While I'm trying to fill a grown man's shoes. I hope I don't turn away from you. But if I screw this up forgive me. It's really the best I can do. It's kind of I love you. It's kind of I need you. It's kind of I want you. It's kind of I don't know what I want. It's kind of I love you. It's kind of I need you. It's kind of I want you. It's kind of I don't know who I am. The laughter and the lace. The kindness in your face. The scent of you on my pillow when you've gone. But I'm still on this fence. And I know it makes no sense. And I'm lookin' to find an answer before the dawn. Yeaaaaa. Only a fool would let you go baby. And I've been a fool too long. It's kind of I love you. It's kind of I need you. It's kind of I want you. And I care a lot more than I say. And I'm gonna love you. I know that I need you. I know that I want you. I'm tired of runnin' away. It's kind of I love you. It's kind of I need you. It's kind of I want you. And I feel a lot more than I show. And I'm gonna love you. I know that I need you. I know that I want you. Somehow I'm gonna let you know"
long world,"There's a brand new light in my life. Shines after the candle is out at night. It's gotten the best of me. It's got my heart and it won't set it free. I just can't tell you why. If I did, well it might be a lie. It's a long world we're living in. I've got to have her from beginning to end. It's long world we're living in. I just can't live without her. . Does anybody know how it feels to want her this bad. So bad you'd give your life away. There's gotta be somebody somewhere. Who needs someone like I need you. . And I wait for the day to take her away in vain. And I realize I'll always feel the same."
love is calling,"The journey has been long. A thousand memories strong. Faced with the night. Not caring who is right. Looking for the laughter that's been gone. How did we used to touch. Why do we think so much. We tire of the words of reflection. And long for affection. For the lovers' rush. Now that we're here after all of these years. Love is calling. Now that we're here so far and so near. Love is calling. Time and again we've trid. To let our feelings slide. Endless negotiations. And unmet expectations. Let's set it all aside. Now that we're here and our motives are clear. Love is calling. Now that we're here--plaintive, sincere. Love is calling. I have been lying still. I have been lying still. Dreaming of the truth. The journey has been long. The candor made us strong. Holding you tonight. In this familiar light. Can we take this sweetness to the dawn. Now that we're here and the walls disappear. Love is calling. Now that we're here and there's no one to fear. Love is calling. Now that we're here after all of the tears. Love is calling. Now that we're here--we're finally here. Love is calling. I have been lying still. I have been lying still. Dreaming of the truth. The journey has been long. The candor made us strong. Holding you tonight. In this familiar light. Can we take this sweetness to the dawn. Now that we're here. And the walls disappear. Love is calling. Now that we're here. And there's no one to fear. Love is calling"
love is love (in any language),"Checkin' out the sand streets. Of this island town. Got my cold Dos Equis. Watchin' women brown. They call it Paradiso. It looks like paradise. And it's looking better all the time. Now I'm dancin' in the moonlight. The party's everywhere. It's all a sweet seduction. To the rhythm in the air. Local girls are talkin'. I hear their bodies say. This boy won't be leavin' lonely. It's je t'aime, it's amore. Te quiero, mi chica. If it's good, you'll get the message. It's je t'aime, it's amore. Eu te amo. Love is love in any language.

minstrel gigolo,You're the minstrel gigolo. Don't you know. You sing your songs of love so soft and low. And they want you more and more. All the young and lonely girls wait for you. There by the backstage door. And they're hoping to. Be the one. . And when you start to sing. You will be their everything. And when you start to sing. Every woman will open up her heart. And let you in.
nature of the game,Taking my time. Walking the line. For someone who doesn't care. Taking my time. Just walking the line. For someone who's never there. It's a fool's game--that I know. Nothing but a broken heart to show. And I know I'll never change. It's the nature of the game. . She loves me--she loves me not. Remember how your heart used to stop. As the petals would hit the floor. How you wished there could be just one more.
nature's way,"It''s nature's way of telling you somesthing's wrong. It's nature's way of telling you in a song. It's nature's way of receiving you. It's nature's way of retrieving you.

never be the same,It was good for me. It was good for you. Now nothing either of us can say or do. Can change the way you feel tonight. Sometimes love just slips out of sight. Just one thing before you go. Just one thing that you've got to know. No one will ever touch me that way. The way that you did that very first day. And I'll. Never be the same without you here. I'll live alone. Hide myself behind my tears. And I'll. Never be the same without your love. I'll live alone. Try so hard to rise above. The years go by. There's always someone new. To try and help me forget about you. Time and again it does me no good. Love never feels the way that it should. I loved you then I guess I'll love you forever. And even though I know we could never stay together. I think about how it could have been. If we could just start all over again. And I'll. Never be the same without you here. I'll live alone. Hide myself behind my tears. And I'll. Never be the same without your love. I'll live alone. Try so hard to rise above. It was good for me. It was good for you. Now nothing either of us can say or do. Can change the way you feel today. Sometimes love just slips away. Just one thing before you go. Just one thing that you've got to know. No one will ever touch me that way. The way that you did that very first day. And I'll. Never be the same without you here. I'll live alone. Hide myself behind my tears. And I'll. Never be the same without your love. I'll live alone. Try so hard to rise above
never stop believing,Every night in my window. I see pictures of the day we met. I keep wishing on the falling stars. To forget you but it hasn't happened yet. And I still remember when you walked away. It was more than my heart could believe. Careless wind blew the smell of your perfume away. But the touch of you. It never leaves. . So I'll never stop believing. Someday your love is coming back to me. No I'll never stop believing. Someday that you'll be coming back to me. . Everybody in my life. They say forget that girl. She's gone for good. How can I explain this heart. It just keeps hanging on. Cause something says it should. . Oh I go on remembering how good we were. The sweetest days I'll ever know. This careless boy. Somehow he let you get away. But the touch of you. He'll never let it go. . Time and time again I see. Just how much she meant to me. Oh a love like that is meant to be. She's got to come back. She's got to come back.
night across the world,I've heard there could be desire. So strong you would brave the fire. Until now I made them liars. Now there is you. 'Cause something about your touch. Is making me feel too much. And letting you go is such a hard thing to do. And when the dawn is closing in. I know I need to drown in your love again. I'd chase the night across the world. To spend one more minute with you. When morning lay just ahead. And daybreak invades our bed. I'll steal you away instead. And fly to the dark. 'Cause when the dawn is closing in. I know I need to drown in your love again. I'd chase the night across the world. To spend one more minute with you. Alone with you. Hold on. Our wings will not fail us. On to Babylon. Where the light can't find us. Hold on. Hold on. Baby hold on. In the heat of this desperate hour. We will follow the moon and its power. That fever that we must devour. Over and over again
no time for talk,Well I read it in town in the melancholy news. The front page story is our love is through. The hand of time is cold -- I can't stand to hear the truth. Somehow I won't believe it 'til I've heard it from you. But there's no time for talk. And there's no place for tears. There's no reason to wonder after all of these years. Sure we had some good times. And so who's to blame. It's so hard to tell when you both feel the pain. . After the years have come and gone. The struggle to forget you will have just begun. We had our ups and downs but one thing's for sure. No one will ever love you more.
nothing will change,The boys find a home in a family born of hate. The girls plant desperate love. In a womb that just won't wait. Forgotten mother pushes a cart with her heart. Through a twisted fate. As walls come down and spirits rise. The business of fear never dies. The artful dodgers with their false alarms. Take from the mouths to feed the arms. Pit god against god for a piece of land. They think they hear his words but they don't understand. Like a river lost on its way to the sea. Where is humanity. I know that nothing will change. 'Til it changes in me. 'Til it changes in you. There's a plague upon the body. A plague upon the mind. While the bridge is burning are we deaf dumb and blind. >From the fallen forest to the poison bay. The world is turning. Turning out that way. Fe fi fo fum. I smell the blood of an Englishman. Fe fi fo fum. I smell the blood of an Irishman. I smell the blood of an African. I smell the blood of Americans. I smell the blood of a Chinaman. I smell the blood of an Indian. I smell the blood of Rumanians. I smell the blood of a Latin American. I smell the blood of a million sons. I smell the blood of everyone
open up my window,Every night. I open up my window. Open up my window. And let your love come in. Every night that I'm away from you. This old bed seems way too big. And my dreams so small. Goin' through the motions. As I stare out from my room. I begin to realize. That we're sharin' the same moon. Lying here hugging my pillow in the dark. Dreaming of your comfort. Fightin' the lonely in my heart. And I thought I felt you touch me. In that old familiar way. When the wind came through the curtains. And I heard it call your name. Ooh the time goes draggin' by. Send my love across the sky. Maybe it's all that I can do. Baby until I'll be with you. I missed you girl more than you'll ever know. I kept a little vigil by my window. It's funny but it's true. Darlin' I did the same for you. Now no matter where we are. We can wish upon that star
poor shirley,Poor Shirley. She must hide her tears. For nobody wants to see them. Surely it will break her heart. Time passes as she waits for a friend. We'll take all the doubtful ones in the fight. And make them hold off 'til the spring. Take hold of their hallowed souls. And save them from pain. All of the pain. Save ourselves from all of the pain. . Dearly held are the friends. Left in the years and lost in the war. Dearly held are the loves. Save for the ones you lose on your own. . Stars will light up the lonely nights. Harbor lights. Making us believe in the love. So struck by the hope of the harmony. Leaving the sorrow. Gently. . Poor Shirley. She must hide her tears. For nobody wants to see them. Surely she will win a heart. Time passes as she waits for the wind.
rendezvous,All across the sky. The mysteries of faith. Fossils of desire all assume their rightful place. Is there any danger in their fire. Is there any solace in their wake. Could it really make a world of difference for goodness' sake. Train rolls a cappella. To a sympathetic moon. Carrying the stories of every heart - earned wound. Will there be a lover at the station. Will there be a last conductor's call. Will there really be a happy ending after all. To the rendezvous. Fortunes to be told. To the rendezvous. Wonders to behold. Onto a place where we can find. Maybe a trace of peace of mind. To the rendezvous all in good time. Painting the horizon. A mast beyond the blue. Caught up in the tempest of another point of view. Could there be a mutiny in the making. Could it be a lorelei in song. Is it just a ghost that's been forgiven all along. Will there be a jewel beneath the boulder. Will there be a pride beyond the fall. Will there really be a happy ending after all. Will there be a pride beyond the fall. Will there really be a happy ending after all. To the rendezvous. Fortunes to be told. To the rendezvous. Wonders to behold. Onto a place where people find. Maybe a trace of peace of mind. To the rendezvous all in good time
ride like the wind,It is the night. My body's weak. I'm on the run. No time to sleep. I've got to ride. Ride like the wind. To be free again. And I've got such a long way to go. To make it to the border of Mexico. So I'll ride like the wind. Ride like the wind. I was born the son of a lawless man. Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand. Lived nine lives. Gunned down ten. Gonna ride like the wind. And I've got such a long way to go. To make it to the border of Mexico. So I'll ride like the wind. Ride like the wind. Accused and tried and told to hang. I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang. Never was the kind to do as I was told. Gonna ride like the wind before I get old. It is the night. My body's weak. I'm on the run. No time to sleep. I've got to ride. Ride like the wind. To be free again. And I've got such a long way to go. To make it to the border of Mexico. So I'll ride like the wind. Ride like the wind
sailing,"Well, it's not far down to paradise. At least it's not for me. And if the wind is right you can sail away. And find tranquility. Oh, the canvas can do miracles. Just you wait and see.

Believe me. Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be. Just a dream and the wind to carry me. And soon I will be free. Fantasy, it gets the best of me. When I'm sailing. All caught up in the reverie. Every word is a symphony. Won't you believe me?. Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be. Just a dream and the wind to carry me. And soon I will be free. Well it's not far back to sanity. At least it's not for me. And if the wind is right you can sail away. And find serenity. Oh, the canvas can do miracles. Just you wait and see. Believe me. Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be. Just a dream and the wind to carry me. And soon I will be free"
save your sadness,"Lost in the future. Worried about the past. Willful and lazy. Pedaling nowhere fast. She works her wonders. Keeping me in today. Reaching through my darkness. Reminding me how to play. . And she says. Save your sadness for the bad times. Time is not your enemy. Save your sadness for the bad times. For now you are with me. Nothing is certain. Certainly nothing new. Hoping some light shines. On us before we are through. She spends her heartbeats. Seeing the best in you. As I learn my mind the more I find. The things she says are true. . And she says. Save your sadness for the bad times. Time is not your enemy. Save your sadness for the bad times. For now you are with me. You live gracefully. Having faith in me. And she says. Save your sadness for the bad times. Time is not your enemy. Save your sadness for the bad times. For now, for now. Save your sadness for the bad times. For now you are with me"
say you'll be mine,"Say you'll be mine. Say you'll be mine until the sun shines. Say you'll be mine. And bring me the dream of a lifetime. I just can't hide the truth no more. I've got to get my feet back down on the floor. I love you so. I need you so. I just don't think I can let you go. Say you'll be mine. Say you'll be mine until the sun shines. Say you'll be mine. And bring me the dream of a lifetime. Well, it's you that keeps me feeling this way. I don't think I can take it even one more day. It don't seem right. That I should be alone tonight. Say you'll be mine. Say you'll be mine until the sun shines. Say you'll be mine. And bring me the dream of a lifetime. I just can't hide the truth no more. I've got to get my feet back down on the floor. I love you so. I need you so. I just don't think I can let you go. Say you'll be mine. Say you'll be mine until the sun shines. Say you'll be mine. And bring me the dream of a lifetime."
she told me so,"We all know how the story begins. How we fall so easily in. To love. Then a boy breaks a girl's heart. A girl breaks a boy's heart. Goodbye is a very hard word to forget. But I think I finally met. The girl. To take away those yesterdays. Oh she loves me, she told me so. As a tear came to her eye. And I love her, I will, I know. Love her for the rest of my life. . Once more I'm feeling like I'm out of control. Cause the girl's got a serious hold. On me. And part of me says run away. But I wanna stay. Should I be up front or cool. Which way is playing the fool. The only time I know what's right. Is when I hear her telling me. . Somewhere there's a star in the sky of every night. Shining for the love of hearts. The light of that star, like the hand of a friend. Leading me back to love again. . If you love her let her know. Let her see all the secrets in your heart. If she loves you she'll only love you more. As she find out who you are."
someday,"Here's a song for the hearts so lonely. The ones who feel that love won't come. Looking to find that one and only. I've got something to say to you. You see the lovers walking down the street. You feel your life's a little incomplete. I know what you mean and I'm here to tell you. Wipe the tears from your eyes. You know I would not lie. . Save your love for someday, girl. Someday will come soon. Save your love for someday, girl. Someday will come soon. . You give your love away to someone new. Just so you can say that he belongs to you. You smile and you laugh and you talk of forever. I'm not so sure that it's true. . Don't give up on love. Someday will come soon. . After you've found that dream you treasure. After the chill has left the air. All of the pieces will come together. The things that two can share. But only time can take you there."
spinning,Ooh wee. Got me spinning. Got me spinning 'round. Like I think I'm winning. It may take me a long long time. But I'm gonna find you out. It may take me a long long time. But I'm gonna find you out. . Ooh wee. It's only the beginning. You got me spinning'round. Like I think I'm winning.
swept away,"I never had anything happen so fast. Took one look and I shattered like glass. I guess I let it show. Cause your smile told me you knew. That you're everything I ever wanted at once. There's no holding this heart. When it knows what it wants. And I never wanted anything more than to know you. I was swept away. No one in the world but you and I. Gotta find a way. To make you feel the way that I do. I was swept away. Without a warning. Like night when the morning begins the day. I was swept away. And so it begins. This journey of love. The summer wind carries us to places all our own. The words of a look. The language of touch. The way that you want me means so much. And I never wanted anything more. Than to love you. I am swept away. No one in the world but you and I. Gotta find a way. To make you feel the way that I do. I am swept away. Without a warning. Like night when the morning begins the day. I was swept away. Away, seeing my tomorrow's in your eyes. I was swept away. Oo, I hope I wake up soon. Oo, I'm a victim of that crazy moon. The very first time you said my name. I knew it would never sound the same. Something about me has changed forever. Can't you see I am swept away. No one in the world but you and I. Gotta find a way. To make you feel the way that I do. I am swept away. Without a warning. Like night when the morning begins the day. I was swept away. Away, seeing my tomorrow's in your eyes. Gotta find a way. To make you feel the way that I do. I was swept away. Without a warning. Like night when the morning begins the day. I was swept away. We were swept away. Dreaming of you. Swept away"
talking in my sleep,Talking in my sleep. She ain't gonna hear it. So my secrets have to keep. A little while longer. In my heart where they've been. For so long I can't remember. Days turn into weeks. Still she's not with me. Still my secrets have to keep. A little while longer. In my heart where they've been. For so long I can't remember. . And I know that I'm just gonna be. Another page in love's history. Another page in your diary. In that old book of love. . Love can cut you deep. It's there to remind you. And the memories make you weak. They whisper to you. From your heart where they've been. For so long you can't remember. . Wake up. Reach for her. She's not there. All I do is dream. Dream that she will come home soon. To me.
that girl,I'm wakin' up in the same old way. But I can't shake me out of the dream. Every time that I close my eyes. I see her face. Like a star on a TV screen. They all keep askin'. Where you been after dark. I say. That kinda girl. She grows on a heart. And I know. It doesn't come any better. That girl. She makes me sing. She gives me things that only love can bring. That girl. She makes me sing. If you think. I'm losin' my cool. That's true. But I betcha'd do the same. If you felt the flame. Of her fire. She likes to make you. Crazy with love. And I let her. I know it doesn't come any better. I watch the guys. I see their eyes. I see their eyes as she walks by. She knows she's fine. I know she's mine. C-c-cuz she digs me
the light is on,Is it yours. Is it mine. I was never the kind who could draw the line. Are you free. Unforgiven. Is this the kind of world you could live in. It's alright. The light is on. The darkness has run to hide. It's alright. The light is on. But the darkness is just outside. Outside your window. . Beating down. Making the sound of the rain. Drive you crazy. Make you lazy. You know it's only the rain.
think of laura,"Every once in a while I'd see her smile. And she'd turn my day around. A girl with those eyes could stare through the lies. And see what your heart was saying. CHORUS:. Think of Laura but laugh don't cry. I know she'd want it that way. When you think of Laura laugh don't cry. I know she'd want it that way. A friend of a friend, a friend till the end. That's the kind of girl she was. Taken away so young. Taken away without a warning. I know you and you're here. In everyday we live. I know her and she's here. I can feel her when I sing. Hey Laura, where are you now. Are you far away from here. I don't think so. I think you're here. Taking our tears away. CHORUS."
thinkin' 'bout you,Ooh ooh oooh oooh ooh. Thinkin' 'bout you. Oooh ooh ooh ooh. Thinkin' 'bout. I've been thinkin' bout you. Thinkin' 'bout all the things that couldn't come true. I've been thinkin' 'bout you. And how much I'll miss having you to talk to. Now that I'm on my own. I don't need to hold you. But I'd love to. There's beauty in monochrome. I promise not to linger. But somehow lately. I've been thinkin' 'bout you. Thinkin' 'bout all those things we put ourselves through. Incompatibly. Playing out our restless parts so crazy and free. Those nights when we talked til the sun. We had all the answers. We were dancers. Then time caught us both on the run. In our own directions. Headed for the moon. I know you. And I know that you think of me too. All is well. Honey but I'm just sittin' here thinkin' 'bout you. Thinkin' 'bout you. I've been thinkin' 'bout you. How you said you'd never change and hoping it's true. In your impetuous way. You brought out the kind of fire still with me today. When you told me you had to go. Off to chase the rainbow. Oh it hurt me so. The pain didn't kill me though. I will always be here. The soul outlives the heart. I know you. And I know that you think of me too. All is well. Honey but I'm just sittin' here thinkin' 'bout you. Thinkin' 'bout you. There was a time when our lives were a tangle. Between our hands and Jacob's ladder. Nothing mattered. Indelible and dear. Indelible and dear. I know you. And I know that you think of me too. All is well. Honey but I'm just sittin' here thinkin' 'bout you. I know you. And I know that you think of me too. All is well. Honey but I'm just sittin' here thinkin' 'bout you. I'm just sittin' here thinkin' 'bout you. I'm just sittin' here thinkin' 'bout you. Thinkin' 'bout you. I've been thinkin' 'bout you. I've been thinkin' 'bout. I've been thinkin' 'bout you. I've been thinkin' 'bout. I've been thinkin' 'bout.
uncharted hearts,As the sun rises it soon compromises the safety of night. And two travelers in spite of themselves. Have to push on. Mornings remind them of things left behind them. One a good wife and the other a life with no name. So they push on. Over the hills and the plains they ride. Sharing the unwritten law they abide. Two uncharted hearts in the silence of their own flight. The journey they measure in danger and pleasure. One likes to bluff and the other is tough on the girls. Still they push on. Roll the bones. Devil-may-care. No questions asked. Barely friends. Two solitaires. Needing each other out there. They build a good fire before they retire. Searching the flame for a moment of blameless repose. A way to push on. Lessons come hard on this brave terrain. They may run free but they're still in the rain. Two uncharted hearts in the silence of their own flight
walking in avalon,Maybe I remind you of a lover you had. Maybe I'm crazy and I make you laught. Maybe you thought I had a lot of cash. I don´t care what it was. But I love what it does. I really dig that your apartment's a mess. I dig the way the sun shines through your dress. I did your industrial shoes. I could say I'm kinky I guess. I can´t believe my luck. You're such a fabulous fabulous mmm. I'm walking in Avalon. And drunk on everything. Her hero in Avalon. A man who would be king. It's cool we both like Bogart and Bacall. It's cool that I like John and you like Paul. Baby it's cool forever cool that your spirit is free. And still you've chosen me. I'm walking in Avalon. And drunk on everything. Her hero in Avalon. A man who would be king. Remenber those mushrooms down in Mexico. How we found our clothes I'll never know. Baby I hope I've loved you the way that you have loved me. A toast to Guinevere. Let's fill our grail with one more beer. I'm walking in Avalon. And drunk on everything. Her hero in Avalon. A man who would be king. We're walking in Avalon. Alive is anything. Two heroes in Avalon. So let the sirens sing
what am i supposed to believe,Some like it hot. Some like it cold. I like it best when it's untold. When I feel sad. And when I feel down. Then I'll wish you were around. What am I supposed to believe. Is it that you really love me. Turn down the lights now. It's all been said. The troubles that come and go. You took my heart and threw it away. You left me out in the rain. What am I supposed to believe. Is is that you really love me. Just you wait. You wait and see. I will be there to love you. Oh it's hard. So hard to live a life on your own. After you've known how it could be. With you and me. Won't you come home to me. You could make everything all right. You could warm me through the coldest night. And make it all right
when she smiles,Well they met in line at the checkout stand. Both unaware of what the gods had planned. She was lost in her Cosmo readin' about the stars. He was readin' about two-headed babies from Mars. When she reached for a Snickers she dropped her keys. And so began one of life's mysteries. He was a little old-fashioned and a little oversexed. He picked them up never guessing what would happen next. Then she smiled and said I like your tie. Yeah she smiled and told him that little white lie. And his soul lit up like the fourth of July. When she smiled. They made it to Starbuck's just before it closed. He pointed to the jar and said you want one of those. So over biscotti and double decafs. They shared their stories and they had some laughs. He got up his courage and asked her back to his place. Then he held his breath as he studied her face. She just sat and she stared and she said nothing at all. He knew he blew it and he waited for the ax to fall. Then she smiled and he knew he hadn't been wrong. Yeah she smiled and said what took you so long. And the world felt good like a rock and roll song. When she smiled. When she smiles I forget my lines. When she smiles man I'm on cloud nine. When she smiles oh it's time out of mind. When she smiles. Then she smiled and said where you been all my life. And she smiled when he asked her to be his wife. And the future had never looked so bright. When she smiled. I'm just diggin' her diggin' me diggin' her. When she smiles I forget my lines. When she smiles man I'm on cloud nine. When she smiles oh it's time out of mind. When she smiles. When she smiles I come all undone. When she smiles I'm the only one. When she smiles I'm a smoking gun. When she smiles.
wild wild west,Out here on the plains tonight. The white man rules the game. Searching through the flames tonight. There's no one left to blame. This town just don't seem big enough. For the likes of the two of us. Here in the wild wild west. In the wild wild west my friend. Living in the wild wild west. In the wild wild west again. We left our bootprint on the shore. And rode off on toward sunset. We left the natives on the cutting room floor. And the shooting's still not done yet. Lazy boy and channel three. Bourbon and contrition. Say a prayer for the NRA. And pass the ammunition. Mercy. Folly and frustration. Mercy. Too much information. Mercy. Desperate situation. Here in the wild wild west. In the wild wild west my friend
wishing well,In this land of accessories. The obsolescent sheen. Like so many fools before us. Lost in dreams. What's behind the curtain. The dinette or the stole. Such important choices. To satisfy the soul. Take it on down to the wishing well. Make a wish to stop your wishing. 'Cause you just can't tell. Give it up. The power of suggestion. The tabloids and the tube. Muscles and money. Tits and glory. What's your story. Are we so unhappy. Being what we are. Sly told us a long time ago. Everybody is a star. Give it up
words of wisdom,I can hear your voice and I have no choice. Cause the pain is too deep inside. And the hurt of a love that is lost has no cure. But the love of another heart. Your friends try and say it will all get better. They say that they know how you feel. But your heart isn't sure 'cause it knows what it heard. All the things that it read in the letter. All the words of wisdom. Never seem to ease the pain. All the words of wisdom sound the same. . All the lies of kindness. Oh that sweet refrain. But you pay the price for the joy that it brings. Cause you hear the sound of her name. And the morning tries to save you. From the shadows of your heart. They dance and kiss as you reminisce. And it's tearing you apart.
