We're back now so go back go pack. It's 2015 and I'm 24, as a flower, I'm a rising flower. I'm Hyelim, a Wonder Girl that's me. Have you missed me or dissed me?. If you don't listen, no kissy. Weren't you bored because we weren't here? The stage looked empty. As opposed to all the kids jumping around here, we have our own army (loyalty). People said they didn't know where we were cuz they couldn't see us. They think they're all that but you're mistaken. Words are a scary weapon, they can become a bomb so please stop. Calling me an idol? But hey, look. I'm no kid and I'm not a doll. You're not even half of me. We Back Back Back. I'm Back Back Back. Backs on back, Backs on back.

It's my own self, my self pack (it's me). It's not the kind of backup where people go easy on me cuz I know them (nope). They support me and prove that I'm real like a tag (yup). My stacked up filmography, overflowing trophies. Just one picture and I'm in the headlines, insta selfie. This isn't enough so in order to fill my desires. I'm back so prepare your white flag. Real back, a big experience, not fit for my age. No peace, I'll go for the challenge, for a bigger adventure. It's alright if I fail, I have my Jyp insurance. Listen to me, my advice is good. Your expensive bags at home is no good. You can't buy your backups with money. Bring it on, give me a price, I'll give you an estimate. If you don't like it, ask me, I'll give you an answer. We Back Back Back. I'm Back Back Back. Backs on back, Backs on back. We have our backups behind us and we are back. We Back Back Back. I'm Back Back Back. B A C K back we back. We're back now so go back go pack. The many thoughts cruelly wear out my lips, my heart freezes. Today's a new day, even if you step on me, I'm still ok (hahaha). I got my back, the haters have a sad look, haters watch your back. No matter what anyone says, I am myself, I protect myself, who else will?. For three years, there was an endless, dark break. Everyone asks, are you even gonna have a comeback?. Should I tell em that I'm dead? So they'll bow down to me. But we've become giants, what're you gonna do if you get stepped on?. I'm sick of it, my ears are about to scar. I'm a ripe fruit, attracting flies, I won't blame them though. What are you saying, stop barking, your mouth will hurt. I'm too busy to lash out anyway. We Back Back Back. I'm Back Back Back. Backs on back, Backs on back. We have our backups behind us and we are back. We Back Back Back. I'm Back Back Back. B A C K back we back.
