lover man,"I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad. I long to try something I'll never had. never had no kissin' oh what I've been missin'.. Lover man, oh where can you be.. The night is cold and I'm so all alone. i'd give my soul just to call you on my own.. Got a moon above me but no one to love me.. Lover man, oh where can you be. I've heard it said that the thrill of romance. can be like a heavenly dream.. I go to, to bed with a pray'r that you'll make. love to me strange all it seems.. Some day I'll meat and you dry my tears. the whisper sweet little things in my ears. huggin's and kissin'. Oh what we've been missin'. Lover man, oh where can you be. I've been lookin' I've been searching."
pet,"So long my girl, yours truly forever. As long as you stay I'll keep you on a leash. Fuck what you think, what you need and want. There will be blood if you talk to me like this. Break my legs to keep me close. That's so sublime!. Glue me back, no sticks and stones. No, not this time. So long my girl. I know you saw it coming. I'm their pet, that's it. Here we go, pets!"
