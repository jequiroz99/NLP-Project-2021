castaway,"I’m wandering alone in an open space. Looking around for a human trace. Along the edge of this satellite. Losing the route in this empty sky. A prey of the ghosts of this galaxy. Losing myself in this ecstasy. No clock is turning to sign the time. Everything’s flowing through day and night. No noise is breaking my silent star. I’m on the run I can go so far. Flying in absence of gravity. Feeling the vibe of eternity. This is the lesson I had to learn. This is the treasure I had to earn. I am the owner of nowhere land. Queen of the castle that’s made of sand. Staring in front of the universe. Maybe someday I’ll be someone else. I’m sure I’ll do it, but till’ that day. Here on my star I am just a castaway.

control (feat. gary go),"I've been trying to breakout of the breakdown. Hoping to find a miracle in the meltdown. All the loving chaos that I'm surround. I dance dance to take me off the ground ground.. I've been closing my eyes so I can see you. Trying to make every other lover be you. I know all of my fantasies won't come true. I dance dance and pray that some of them do.. (Chorus). Hey-yeah, lift my emotion. Tonight, my heart is open. Let go, there's no confusion. Control is an illusion.. Control is an illusion.. Woo-ooo-oo-oo.. Control is an illusion.. I can't own ya love,. I can't own your love,. I gotta let it go in the night sky. When I look above. When I look above. I see it shining; I'll feel so aliiiiive.. Ready to let love back into my soul.. In the beauty, in the music, it's time to lose control of control.. (Chorus 2x). Control, control..

no milk today,"No milk today, my love has gone away. The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn. No milk today, it seems a common sight. But people passing by don't know the reason why. How could they know just what this message means. The end of my hopes, the end of all my dreams. How could they know the palace there had been. Behind the door where my love reigned as queen. No milk today, my love has gone away. The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn. No milk today, it wasn't always so. The company was gay, we'd turn night into day. But all that's left is a place dark and lonely. A terraced house in a mean street back of town. Becomes a shrine when I think of you only. Just two up two down"

It feels like paradise. And I'd do anything you'd want me to. When we're in paradise. I'll see you on the other side, where it's alright. If tonight is the last night. I'll see you in paradise. If tonight is the last night. I'll see you in paradise. If tonight is the last night. I'll see you in paradise. You better be ready. 'Cause all good things come to an end. Spring into summer, my fire's burning again. Saying brighter, I'm not giving up, light up. Gonna live it up, let go, let go, let go. In paradise, the closer I get to you. It feels like paradise.
