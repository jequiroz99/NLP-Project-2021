these are the days,"These are the Days. Gotta let you go. Cuz I let you in. I cried enough about you. Gotta walk away. Gotta hear my heart. All this pain feels so endless. (Bridge) I’m facing life, my sun will rise. The darkness makes the stars shine. And I can’t look back. Now I’m on my path. Alone. (Chorus)These are the days I will stand up. And these are the days I won't give up. Not many times can my heart break. These are the days. These are the days I will treasure. And these are the days I will remember. No matter the pain that I've been through. These are the days. So many questions. Never know the answers. All these pieces leave me puzzled. Inside I’m searching. Knowing I’m not perfect. But I gave my entire soul. (Bridge). (Chorus). All the days go, so slow. When you feel you’re on your own. I know, it’s just those. Little moments you feel so low, so low. The world turns. And you start to learn. That everything around you might crash and burn. But always, know that. You are not alone. (Chorus)"
