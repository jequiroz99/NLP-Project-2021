live like kings,"Life in the city, yeah, it's all we've known. Concrete jungle's always been our home. But now all that's changed. It's getting really strange. Five thousand miles in a hot air balloon. Here comes the rain. But not a Monsoon. It' s just you and me chasing our destiny. Whatever may come, whatever we find. I've got your back, and you've got mine. Live Like Kings, that would rule. A couple of thrones, that'd be cool. One thing's for sure, we'd always have fun. Living the life under the sun. Whatever crazy things this island brings. We're Living Like Kings. Water all around three hundred sixty degrees. You never know what's blowing in the breeze.. Swimming in the seas. Our living industries. Brothers we been and brother we'll be. The only thing that changed is that royalty. Live like kings. That would rule a couple thrones. That'd be cool one thing for sure always have fun. Living the life under the sun.. And what ever crazy needs this island bridge. Living like kings"

""Baby we ain't comin' back. I was alone her but you found the way to me. It took me so long but I think I'm starting to see. That there's so much more to life... and this much I know is true. That I'm empty her and all I want is you. Yeah! Cause I'm empty her and all I want is you. And when I was sick.... Strapped to my bed. All of these images were rushing through my head. All my thoughts filtered back to you. 'Cause you were the one... who held my hand. Who picked me up when I was face down in the sand. I think that I own my life for you. And then you wrapped your arms so tight around my neck. And then we ran to your car... you said. ""Baby we ain't comin' back. I was alone her but you found the way to me.

every little thing she does is magic,Though I've tried before to tell her. Of the feelings I have for her in my heart. Every time that I come near her. I just lose my nerve. As I've done from the start. Every little thing she does is magic. Everything she does just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Do I have to tell the story. Of a thousand rainy days since we first met. It's a big enough umbrella. But it's always me that ends up getting wet. Every little thing she does is magic. Everything she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day. And ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned. way. But my silent fears have gripped me. Long before I reach the phone. Long before my tongue has tripped me. Must I always be alone?. Every little thing she does is magic. Everything she does just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on

I used to wanna sing along but now i wanna die. I don't listen to the radio I'm trying to forget you. It doesn't help because i see you all the time. Your new boyfriend used to be the closest friend of mine. [Chorus]. I'm deleting all the memories. Cause the pictures speak of tragedies. I don't wanna know I'm living in denial.

Once you're watching every move that I make. You gotta believe that I got what it takes. To stand out, above the crowd. Even if I gotta shout out loud. 'Til mine is the only face you'll see. Gonna stand out .... 'Til ya notice me. If the sqeeky wheel's always gettin' the grease. I'm totally devoted to disturbing the peace. And I'll do it all again, when I get done. Until I become your number one. No method to the madness, and no means of escape. Gonna break every rule or bend them all outta shape. It ain't a question of ""how"", just a matter of when. You get the message that I'm tryin' to send. I'm under a spell, I'm in over my head. And you know I'm going all the way to the end. To stand out, above the crowd. Even if I gotta shout out loud. 'Til mine is the only face you see. Gonna stand out .... 'Til ya notice me. If I could make you stop and take a look at me. instead of just, walkin' on. There's nothin that. I wouldn't do if it was gettin' you to notice. I'm alive. All I need is half a chance,. a second thought, a second glance. To prove, I got whatever it takes. It's a piece of cake. To stand out, above the crowd. Even if I gotta shout out loud. 'Til mine is the only face you'll see. Gonna, stand out, staaaand out. Stand out!. Stand out!. 'Til mine is the only face you'll see.

the in crowd,"Spin away the combination for the last time. Say goodbye to this year. I wish I could avoid the empty summer days that await me.. The fakers smile goodbye celebrating there new freedom. I sit alone on the couch. Wondering why. Chorus:. I wonder what it`s like to have it all. To never be afraid that I would fall. But I don`t think I`ve ever known the time. That I was part of the in crowd. Here we go another day another disgrace. Fall flat on my face. I wish I had a bunch of money. Catch a plane head out west. Still run and play around. All full of the fans and freedom. I sit alone on the couch. Wondering why. Chorus:. I wonder what it`s like to have it all. To never be afraid that I would fall. But I don`t think I`ve ever known a time. That I was part of the in crowd. Chorus [#2]:. Doesn`t anyone here live an original life. Or did you surrender to be on the inside,. When you disappear they won`t remember your name. And you'll fade away til someone takes your place.. Takes your place. In the in crowd. Spin away the combination for the last time. Say goodbye to this year. I wish I could avoid the empty summer days that await me. The fakers smile goodbye celebrating there new freedom. I sit alone on the couch. But am ready to fly. [chorus].

But I don`t think Ive ever known the time. That I was part of the in crowd.. Of the in crowd. In the in crowd. I don`t need anything that I can`t find in me. I`m alive I have been out of line at the end. Waiting for something more something new to begin. Waiting for something more someway to fit in. In the in crowd. In the in crowd"
