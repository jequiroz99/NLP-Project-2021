careless whisper,"I feel so unsure. As I take your hand and lead to the dance floor. As the music dies, something in your eyes. Calls to mind the silver screen. And all its sad good-byes. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you are not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. And waste the chance that I've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. Time can never mend. The careless whispers of a good friend. To the heart and mind. Ignorance is kind. There's no comfort in the truth. Pain is all you'll find. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you are not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. And waste this chance that I've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. Never without your love. Tonight the music seems so loud. I wish that we could lose this crowd. Maybe it's better this way. We'd hurt each other. with the things we'd want to say. We could have been so good together. We could have lived this dance forever. But now who's gonna dance with me. Please stay. And I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. And waste the chance that I've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. (now that you're gone) now that you're gone. (now that you're gone) what I did so wrong. That you had to leave me alone"
freedom '90,"I won't let you down. I will not give you up. Gotta have some faith in the sound. It's the one good thing that I've got. I won't let you down. So please don't give me up. Because I would really, really love to stick around. Heaven knows I was just a young boy. Didn't know what I wanted to be. I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy. And I guess it was enough for me towin the race?. A prettier face!. Brand new clothes and a big fat place. On your rock and roll TV. But today the way I play the game is not the same. No way. Think I'm gonna get me some happy. I think there's something you should know. I think it's time I told you so. There's something deep inside of me. There's someone else I've got to be. Take back your picture in a frame. Take back your singing in the rain. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. All we have to do now. Is take these lies. and make them true somehow. All we have to see. Is that I don't belong to you. And you don't belong to me. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy. What a kick just a buddy and me. We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy. We were living in a fantasy. We won the race. Got out of the place. I went back home got a brand new face. For the boys on MTV. But today the way I play the game has got to change. Oh yeah. Now I'm gonna get myself happy. I think there's something you should know. I think it's time I stopped the show. There's something deep inside of me. There's someone I forgot to be. Take back your picture in a frame. Don't think that I'll be back again. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. All we have to do now. Is take these lies. and make them true somehow. All we have to see. Is that I don't belong to you. And you don't belong to me. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Well it looks like the road to heaven. But it feels like the road to hell. When I knew which side my bread was buttered. I took the knife as well. Posing for another picture. Everybody's got to sell. But when you shake your ass. They notice fast. And some mistakes were built to last. That's what you get. I say that's what you get. That's what you get for changing your mind. And after all this time. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. I'll hold on to my freedom. May not be what you want from me. Just the way it's got to be. Lose the face now. I've got to live"

don't let the sun go down on me (feat. elton john),"I can't light no more of your darkness. All my pictures seem to fade to black and white. I'm growing tired and time stands still before me. Frozen here on the ladder of my life. It's much too late to save myself from falling. I took a chance and changed your way of life. But you misread my meaning when I met you. Closed the door and left me blinded by the light. Don't let the sun go down on me. Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see. I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free. But losing everything is like the sun going down on me. I can't find, oh the right romantic line. But see me once and see the way I feel. Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm. But these cuts I have. They need love to help them heal. Don't let the sun go down on me. Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see. I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free. Cos losing everything is like the sun going down on me. Don't let the sun go down on me. Although I search myself, it's always someone else that I see. I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, baby. Cos losing everything is like the sun going down on me"

kissing a fool,"You are far. When I could have been your star. You listened to people. Who scared you to death, and from my heart. Strange that you were strong enough. To even make a start. But you'll never find. Peace of mind. Till you listen to your heart. People. You can never change the way they feel. Better let them do just what they want. For they will. If you let them. Steal your heart from you. People. Will always make a lover feel a fool. But you knew I loved you. We could have shown them all. We should have seen love through.

Better let them do just what they want. For they will. If you let them. Steal your heart from you. People. Will always make a lover feel a fool. But you knew I loved you.

One you really can surrender with. I will wait for you. Like I always do. There's something there. That can't compare with any other. You are far. When I could have been your star. You listened to people. Who scared you to death, and from my heart. Strange that I was wrong enough. To think you'd love me too. I guess you were kissing a fool. You must have been kissing a fool"
praying for time,"These are the days of the open hand. They will not be the last. Look around now. These are the days of the beggars and the choosers. This is the year of the hungry man. Whose place is in the past. Hand in hand with ignorance. And legitimate excuses. The rich declare themselves poor. And most of us are not sure. If we have too much. But we'll take our chances. Because god's stopped keeping score. I guess somewhere along the way. He must have let us all out to play. Turned his back and all god's children. Crept out the back door. And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate. Hanging on to hope. When there is no hope to speak of. And the wounded skies above say it's much too late. Well maybe we should all be praying for time. These are the days of the empty hand. Oh you hold on to what you can. And charity is a coat you wear twice a year. This is the year of the guilty man. Your television takes a stand. And you find that what was over there. Is over here. So you scream from behind your door. Say ""what's mine is mine and not yours"". I may have too much but I'll take my chances. Because god's stopped keeping score. And you cling to the things they sold you. Did you cover your eyes when they told you. That he can't come back. Because he has no children to come back for. It's hard to love, there's so much to hate"

Then the lover that you miss. Will come to you on those cold, cold nights. When you've been loved. When you know it holds such bliss. Then the lover that you kissed. Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight. Sadness in my eyes. No one guessed and no one tried. You smiled at me like Jesus to a child. Loveless and cold. With your last breath you saved my soul. You smiled at me like Jesus to a child. And what have I learned from all these tears. I've waited for you all those years. Then just when it began he took your love away. But I still say. Chorus. So the words you could not say. I'll sing them for you. And the love we would have made. I'll make it for two. For every single memory. Has become a part of me. You will always be my love. Well I've been loved so I know just what love is. And the lover that I kissed is always by my side. Oh the lover I still miss... was Jesus to a child"

you have been loved,"She takes the back road and the lane. Past the school that has no changed. In all this time. She thinks of when the boy was young. All the battles she had won. Just to give him life. That man. She loved that man. For all his life. But now we meet to bring him flowers. And only God knows why. For what's the use in pressing pamls. When children fade in mother's arms. It's a cruel world. We've so much to loose. And what we have to learn we rarely choose. So if it's God who took her son. He cannot be the one living in her mind. Take care my love, she said. Don't think that God is dead. Take care my love, she said. You have been loved. If I was weak, forgive me. But I was terrified. You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love. The kind that makes devils cry. So these days. My life has changed. And I'll be fine. But she just sits and counts the hours. Searching for her crime. So what's the use of pressing palms. If you won't keep such love from harm. It's a cruel world. You've so much to prove. And heaven helps the ones who wait for you. Well I've no daughters, I've no sons. Guess I'm the only one. Living in my life. Take care my love, he said. Don't think that God is dead. Take care my love, he said. You have been loved..."
cowboys and angels,(Piano intro). When your heart`s in someone else`s hands. Monkey see and monkey do. Their wish is your command. You`re not to blame. Everyone`s the same. All you do is love and love is all you do. I should know by now the way I fought for you. You`re not to blame. Everyone`s the same. I know you think that you`re safe. Mister. Harmless deception that keeps love at bay. It`s the ones who resist that we most want to kiss. Wouldn`t you say?. Cowboys and angels. They all have the time for you. Why should I imagine. That I`d be a find for you. Why should I imagine. That I`d have something to say. But that scar on your face. That beautiful face of yours. In your heart there`s a trace. Of someone before. When your heart`s in someone else`s plans. Things you say and things you do. They don`t understand. It`s such a shame. Always ends the same. You can call it love but I don`t think it`s true. You should know by now. I`m not the boy for you. You`re not to blame. Always ends the same. I know you think that you`re safe. Sister. Harmless affection that keeps things this way. It`s the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss. Who will pay. Cowboys and angels. They all take a shine to you. Why should I imagine. That I was designed for you. Why should I believe. That you would stay. But that scar on your face. That beautiful face of yours. Don`t you think that I know. They hurt you before. Take this man to your bed. Maybe his hands. Will help you forget. Please be stronger than your past. The future may still give you a chance
last christmas,"Last Christmas. CHORUS:. Last Christmas. I gave you my heart. But the very next day you gave it away. This year. To save me from tears. I'll give it to someone special. CHORUS. Once bitten and twice shy. I keep my distance. But you still catch my eye. Tell me baby. Do you recognize me?. Well. It's been a year. It doesn't surprise me. HAPPY CHRISTMAS. I wrapped it up and sent it. With a note saying ""I love you"". I meant it. Now I know what a fool I've been. But if you kissed me now. I know you'd fool me again. CHORUS. Crowded room. Runs with tired eyes. I'm hiding from you. And your solemn eyes. My god I thought you were. Someone to rely on. Me?. I guess I was a shoulder to cry on. A face on a lover with a fire in his heart. A man undercover but you tore me apart. Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again. CHORUS 2x. A face on a lover with a fire in his heart. A man undercover but you tore him apart. Maybe next year I'll give it to someone."

It's not as though we just broke up. It's not as though it was yesterday. But something I just can't explain. Something in me needs this pain. I know I'll never see your face again. C'mon now. I've got to be strong now. Now everybody's talking about this new decade. Like you say the magic numbers. Then just say goodbye to. The stupid mistakes you made. Oh my memory serves me far too well. Don't you know that. The years will come and go. Some of us will change our lives. Some of us still have nothing to show. Nothing baby. But memories. And if these wounds. They are self-inflicted. I don't really know. How my poor heart could have protected me. But if I have to carry this pain. If you will not share the blame. I deserve to see your face again. C'mon now. You don't have to be so strong now. Come back. Come back to me darling. I will make it worth your while. Come back to your baby. I miss your kiss. I miss your smile. Seems to me the peace I search to find. Ain't going to be mine until you say you will. Don't you keep me waiting for that day. I know, I know, I know. You hear these words that I say.

A life of love and music with someone who'll understand. That even though I may be out of tune when I attempt to say. How much I love you. And all that matters is the message that I bring,. Which is: my dear one, I love you."

amazing,"GEORGE MICHAEL - Amazing. Album: Patience (2004). . I was mixed up when you came to me. Too broke to fix. Said 'daddy get you gone, I'm missing my baby'. Still missing my baby. I was stitched up by the hands of fate. Said how you gonna make it on your own. If luck is a lady?. Maybe luck is a lady. I was going down for the third time. My heart was broken I was not open. To your suggestions. I had so many questions. That you just kissed away. Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise. The day you walked in and changed my life. I think it's amazing. The way that love can set you free. So I walk in the midday sun. I never thought that my saviour would come. I think it's amazing. I think it's amazing. I think you're amazing. You tried to save me from myself. Said 'Darling kiss as many as you want!. My love's still available. And I know that you are insatiable'. We're like victims of the same disease. Look at your Big Bad Daddy, and your mom. And your mom... was always acting crazy. I was going down for the third time. My heart was broken,. I thought that loving you was out of the question. Then I saw my reflection. Saying please don't let this go. Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise. The day you walked in changed my life. I think it's amazing. The way love can set you free. So now I walk in the midday sun. I never thought that my saviour would come. I think it's amazing. I think you're amazing. Celebrate the love of the one you're with. Celebrate, this life with you baby. I think you should celebrate yeah. Don't put your love in chains baby. No, no, walk in the midday sun. I thought I was dreaming. I think it's amazing. I think you're amazing. I said celebrate the love of the one you're with. As this life gets colder. And the devil inside. tells you to give up"

Yesterday it seemed my life was colder than December. Allalone I watched the eagles fly. Even the light seemed to have changed. In the Californian sky. Through all of those battles then you came. Stepped out of the fading light. Said, ""Baby I'm American, dry your eyes again,. Because I'm here to save your life"". My American Angel, he desn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight). My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night. Takes away thata fear that I carried forever. You stopped to wipe away my tears. But you stayed forever amore. And more, didn't you baby....

careless whisper,"I feel so unsure. As I take your hand and lead to the dance floor. As the music dies, something in your eyes. Calls to mind the silver screen. And all its sad good-byes. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you are not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. And waste the chance that I've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. Time can never mend. The careless whispers of a good friend. To the heart and mind. Ignorance is kind. There's no comfort in the truth. Pain is all you'll find. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you are not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. And waste this chance that I've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. Never without your love. Tonight the music seems so loud. I wish that we could lose this crowd. Maybe it's better this way. We'd hurt each other. with the things we'd want to say. We could have been so good together. We could have lived this dance forever. But now who's gonna dance with me. Please stay. And I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. And waste the chance that I've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. (now that you're gone) now that you're gone. (now that you're gone) what I did so wrong. That you had to leave me alone"

cowboys and angels,(Piano intro). When your heart`s in someone else`s hands. Monkey see and monkey do. Their wish is your command. You`re not to blame. Everyone`s the same. All you do is love and love is all you do. I should know by now the way I fought for you. You`re not to blame. Everyone`s the same. I know you think that you`re safe. Mister. Harmless deception that keeps love at bay. It`s the ones who resist that we most want to kiss. Wouldn`t you say?. Cowboys and angels. They all have the time for you. Why should I imagine. That I`d be a find for you. Why should I imagine. That I`d have something to say. But that scar on your face. That beautiful face of yours. In your heart there`s a trace. Of someone before. When your heart`s in someone else`s plans. Things you say and things you do. They don`t understand. It`s such a shame. Always ends the same. You can call it love but I don`t think it`s true. You should know by now. I`m not the boy for you. You`re not to blame. Always ends the same. I know you think that you`re safe. Sister. Harmless affection that keeps things this way. It`s the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss. Who will pay. Cowboys and angels. They all take a shine to you. Why should I imagine. That I was designed for you. Why should I believe. That you would stay. But that scar on your face. That beautiful face of yours. Don`t you think that I know. They hurt you before. Take this man to your bed. Maybe his hands. Will help you forget. Please be stronger than your past. The future may still give you a chance
crazyman dance,"Well I'm still here. But I'm so scared. Got myself in trouble, so much trouble. I know I've got to make it. But I just can't take New York. My middle name is fear. I have a vacant stare. And it's been so long since my body's been warm. I know I've got to make it. But I just can't take New York. I came here. All dreams and wide eyes in the big, big city. No family, no money. And I don't even know what's hit me. He hasn't seen a doctor. Since he got here in the spring. Went to the Medicentre. But they wouldn't let him in. Without a green card. Life can be so hard. Take pity on a man without a home of his own. How could he ever have known?. Every street and every corner. Watch them drowning. Watch them do the Crazyman Dance. Men and Women to the slaughter. We just stand and watch them. Do the Crazyman Dance. It's been one whole year. And it's just not fair. For all the pushing and shoving. I've still got nothing. I'm never gonna make it. And I'm stuck here in New York. So people don't come near. Unless you've a dollar to spare. 'Cause you know what they say. About madmen on the subways of New York. Believe it. Yesterday's newspapers. I wrap them around my body. Outside these skyscrapers. I wait for the night to hit me. And boy, does it hit me. Every street and every corner. Watch them drowning. Watch them do the Crazyman Dance. For a nickel or a quarter. For your pleasure. Watch them do the Crazyman Dance. I'm coming to London. I'm coming to Paris. I'm coming to make you good clean people embarrassed. Why don't you look at my face. Why don't you look in my eyes. You'd rather look at your feet. You'd rather look at the skies. Oh, you'd look anywhere. But at a man whose pure existence. Says 'I ain't got time'. And I don't care. I don't care. You just don't care."

december song (i dreamed of christmas),"Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. May your every New Year dream come true. Sweet December song. The melody that saved me. On those less than silent nights. When snow would fall upon my bed. White sugar from Jesus. And take me to the day. She could always smile. The Virgin Child would always show, you see. Just to save me. (Just to save me). There was always Christmas time. To wipe the year away. I guess that morning they?d decided. That the war would have to wait. There was always Christmas time. Jesus came to stay. I could believe in peace on Earth. And I could watch TV all day. So I dreamed of Christmas. Maybe since you?ve gone. I went a little crazy. God knows they can see (the child). But the snow that falls upon my bed. That loving I needed. Falls every single day. For each and every child. The Virgin smiles for all to see. But you kept her from me. There was always Christmas time. To wipe the year away. I guess that morning they?d decided. That the war would have to wait. There was always Christmas time. Jesus came to stay. I could believe in peace on Earth. And I could watch TV all day. And so I dreamed of Christmas. Yes, I dreamed like you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. May your every New Year dream come true"
desafinado (english),"If you say my singing is off key, my love. You would hurt my feelings, don't you see, my love ?. I wish I had an ear like yours,. A voice that would behave. All I have is feeling. And the voice God gave. You insist my music goes against the rules. Yes, but rules were never made for lovesick fools. I wrote this song for you. But you don't care. It's a crooked song, ah,. But my heart is there. The thing that you would see if you would play the part. Is even if I'm out of tune I have a gentle heart. I took your picture with my trusty Rolliflex. And now all I have developed is complex. Possibly in vain, I hope you weaken, oh my love. And forget those rigid rules that undermine my dream of. A life of love and music with someone who'll understand. That even though I may be out of tune when I attempt to say. How much I love you. And all that matters is the message that I bring,. Which is: my dear one, I love you."
do they know it's christmas,"(Bob Geldof & Midge Ure). Performed by Band Aid. Recorded on November 25, 1986. It's Christmastime. There's no need to be afraid. At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade. And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy. Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime. But say a prayer. Pray for the other ones. At Christmastime it's hard, but when you're having fun. There's a world outside your window. And it's a world of dread and fear. Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears. And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging. chimes of doom. Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you. And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime. The greatest gift they'll get this year is life. (Oooh) Where nothing ever grows. No rain nor rivers flow. Do they know it's Christmastime at all?. (Here's to you) raise a glass for everyone. (Here's to them) underneath that burning sun. Do they know it's Christmastime at all?. Feed the world. Feed the world. Feed the world. Let them know it's Christmastime again. Feed the world. Let them know it's Christmastime again."
do you really want to know,"When I ask those questions, baby. It's just to get them out of my head. Cause they turn around inside it. Then they spill off to our bed. Do I really want to know?. Do I really want to know your life?. Would I have to let you go?. Could I listen to my heart if my head stops to think twice?. When I've been a good boy. When I've been a bad boy. I have too much fun. But baby so did everyone. I've never been an angel. But things are gonna change, change, change. So do you really want to know?. Do you really want to know my life?. Would you have to let me go?. Could you listen to your heart if your head stopped to think twice?. If you knew every woman. And I knew every man. We never would have made it past holding hands. I guess the saying is no longer true. That what you don't know can hurt you. I guess there is just no question, baby. You know what you're doing in bed. If I want your touch. Should I know too much. Some things are better left unsaid. So do I really want to know?. Do I really want to know your life?. Would I have to let you go?. Could I listen to my heart if my head starts to think twice?. (Tell me baby, Cause one thing to guess is one thing to know,. and don't you think that maybe baby I've got secrets of my own?). If I knew every woman. And you knew every man. We never would have made it past holding hands. I used to say it but it's no longer true. Cause what you don't know can really hurt you (Can kill you baby). And even as we speak. The world is full of lovers."
don't let the sun go down on me (feat. elton john),"I can't light no more of your darkness. All my pictures seem to fade to black and white. I'm growing tired and time stands still before me. Frozen here on the ladder of my life. It's much too late to save myself from falling. I took a chance and changed your way of life. But you misread my meaning when I met you. Closed the door and left me blinded by the light. Don't let the sun go down on me. Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see. I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free. But losing everything is like the sun going down on me. I can't find, oh the right romantic line. But see me once and see the way I feel. Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm. But these cuts I have. They need love to help them heal. Don't let the sun go down on me. Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see. I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free. Cos losing everything is like the sun going down on me. Don't let the sun go down on me. Although I search myself, it's always someone else that I see. I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, baby. Cos losing everything is like the sun going down on me"
edge of heaven,"I would lock you up. But I could not bear to hear you. Screaming to be set free. I would chain you up. If I'd thought you'd swear. The only one that mattered was me, me, me. I would strap you up. But don't worry baby. You know I wouldn't hurt you 'less you wanted me to. It's too late to stop. Won't the heavens save me?. My daddy said the devil looks a lot like you. You take me to the edge of heaven. Tell me that my soul's forgiven. Hide you baby's eyes and we can.... You take me to the edge of heaven. One last time might be forever. When the passion dies -. It's just a matter of time before my heart is. Looking for a home. I'm like a maniac, at the end of the day. I'm like a doggie barking at your door. So come take me back to the place you stay. And maybe we can do it once more. You say I'm dangerous. But don't worry baby. I get excited at the things that you do. And there's a place for us in a dirty movie. 'Cos no-one does it better than me and you. You take me to the edge of heaven. Tell me that my soul's forgiven. Hide your baby's eyes and we can.... You take me to the edge of heaven. One last time might be forever. Please don't tell me lies. It's just a matter of time before my heart is. Looking for a home. I ain't got no more worries. I'm gonna spend some times with you.

You take me to the edge of heaven. One last time might be forever. Don't you tell me lies, because believe me baby. One day you'll wake up on your own.. I ain't got no more worries. I ain't got no more time for you. Loving you takes such courage. Everyone's got their eyes on you. I ain't got no more worries. I ain't got no more time for you. Loving you takes such courage."
everything she wants (remix taken from final),"Somebody told me. Boy everything she wants is everything she sees. I guess I must have loved you. Because I said you were the perfect girl for me, baby. And now we're six months older. And everything you want and everything you see. Is out of reach not good enough. I don't know what the hell you want from me. Somebody tell me. (won't you tell me).

Why I work so hard for you. (To give you money, work to give you money). Oh why do I do the things I do. I'd tell you if I knew. My God, I don't even think that I love you. (Won't you tell me). (To give you money, work to give you money). How could you settle. For a boy like me. When all I could see. Was the end of the week. All the things we sign. And the things we buy. Ain't gonna keep us together. It's just a matter of time. My situation. Never changes. Walking in and out of that door. Like a stranger. For the wages. I give you all. You say you want more.

freedom '90,"I won't let you down. I will not give you up. Gotta have some faith in the sound. It's the one good thing that I've got. I won't let you down. So please don't give me up. Because I would really, really love to stick around. Heaven knows I was just a young boy. Didn't know what I wanted to be. I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy. And I guess it was enough for me towin the race?. A prettier face!. Brand new clothes and a big fat place. On your rock and roll TV. But today the way I play the game is not the same. No way. Think I'm gonna get me some happy. I think there's something you should know. I think it's time I told you so. There's something deep inside of me. There's someone else I've got to be. Take back your picture in a frame. Take back your singing in the rain. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. All we have to do now. Is take these lies. and make them true somehow. All we have to see. Is that I don't belong to you. And you don't belong to me. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy. What a kick just a buddy and me. We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy. We were living in a fantasy. We won the race. Got out of the place. I went back home got a brand new face. For the boys on MTV. But today the way I play the game has got to change. Oh yeah. Now I'm gonna get myself happy. I think there's something you should know. I think it's time I stopped the show. There's something deep inside of me. There's someone I forgot to be. Take back your picture in a frame. Don't think that I'll be back again. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. All we have to do now. Is take these lies. and make them true somehow. All we have to see. Is that I don't belong to you. And you don't belong to me. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Well it looks like the road to heaven. But it feels like the road to hell. When I knew which side my bread was buttered. I took the knife as well. Posing for another picture. Everybody's got to sell. But when you shake your ass. They notice fast. And some mistakes were built to last. That's what you get. I say that's what you get. That's what you get for changing your mind. And after all this time. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. I'll hold on to my freedom. May not be what you want from me. Just the way it's got to be. Lose the face now. I've got to live"

frosty the snowman,Frosty the snowman. Was a jolly happy soul. With a corn cop pipe. And a button nose. And two eyes. Made out of coal. Frosty the snowman. Is a fairy tale they say. He was made out of snow. But the children know how. He came to life one day. There must of been. Some magic in. That ol' silk cap. They found. For when they placed it. On his head. He began to dance around. Frosty the snowman. Was alive as he could be. And the children say. He could laugh and play. Just the same. As you and me. Frosty the snowman. Knew the snow. Was hot that day. So he said lets run. And have some fun. Before I melt away. Down to the village. With a broom stick. In his hand. Runnin' here and there. All around the square. Sayin' catch me. If you can. He led them down. The streets of town. Right. To the traffic cop. And he only. Paused a moment. When he heard him. Holler stop. Frosty the snowman. Had to hurry on his way. But he. Waved goodbye sayin'. Please don't cry. I'll be back again. Some day

Jump on the wagon or they'll leave you behind. But no one gave a thought to the rest of the nation. Like to help you buddy but I haven't got the time. Somebody shouted save me.

Has to give a little for the dollars that we get. Has to give a little they say its for the best. Somebody shouted maybe. But they kept on living. Hand to mouth. Hand to mouth. Hand to mouth. Hand to mouth. So she ran to the arms of America. And she kissed the powers that be. And someone told me. Someone told me. That the gods believe in nothing. So with empty hands I pray. And I tell myself one day. They just might see me.

heartbeat,"Another summer, another vacation is over. A September morning with the sun and smell of the clover. Down by the gates we sit and watch all our friends go by. And pretend we don't hear the bell that rings through the. summer sky. I was happy with the kisses she gave me. It's just that happy was she made me. Happy that was until I saw you. Chorus:. Heartbeat, heartbeat, why do you fail me now?. You hurt me, desert me in my darkest hour. Heartbeat, heartbeat, why do you keep me here?. How could I help but admire her beauty. Standing on the line between desire and duty. Heartbeat, heartbeat, it will end in tears. I need a lover that loves such a dangerous place to be. Oh, if we were meant for each other then why don't you answer me. Don't keep me waiting, you know that I long to be by your side. I was happy with the kisses she gave me. Now there's nothing on earth that can save me. Why should I care I can have you?."

Over you. Help me over you. I can't seem to take these changes. Everything reminds my heart of you. Thought the first time was the last time. Of being apart. Now I find I'm having to search again. It'll happen. It's gotta happen. Come together. I just wish somebody would tell me when. Oh such a waste of time. Oh such a waste. I still want you baby. (Chorus). Heaven help Heaven help.

idol,"He was a light star. Tripping on a high wire. Bulldog stubborn, born uneven. A classless creature, a man for all seasons. But don't bet them. They can't take him. To the very bottom. Because they made him and they'll waste him. And I don't believe that I want to watch them. `Cause the fifties shifted out of gear. He was an idol then, now he's an idol here. But his face has changed, he's not the same no more. And I have to say that I like the way his music sounded before. He was tight-assed. Walking on broken glass. Highly prized in the wallet size. The number one crush in a schoolgirl's eyes. But don't pretend that it won't end. In the depth of your despair. You went from lame suits right down to tennis shoes. To peanuts from the lion's share"

And what have I learned from all this pain. I thought I never feel the same about anyone or anything again. But now I know. Chorus:. When you find a love. When you know that it exists. Then the lover that you miss. Will come to you on those cold, cold nights. When you've been loved. When you know it holds such bliss. Then the lover that you kissed. Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight. Sadness in my eyes. No one guessed and no one tried. You smiled at me like Jesus to a child. Loveless and cold. With your last breath you saved my soul. You smiled at me like Jesus to a child. And what have I learned from all these tears. I've waited for you all those years. Then just when it began he took your love away. But I still say. Chorus. So the words you could not say. I'll sing them for you. And the love we would have made. I'll make it for two. For every single memory. Has become a part of me. You will always be my love. Well I've been loved so I know just what love is. And the lover that I kissed is always by my side.

john and elvis are dead,"Close friend of mine as a child fell into a slumber. No sign of life since '75. Then one day he just, what do you know. I guess God just called his number. He called me up he called me up and said:. ""I've been awake about a week. I'm thinking about asking the doctor. If he could put me back to sleep"". Then he laughed and said:. ""Hey all the girls they look the same"". Don't they know just what their mothers. Paid in blood, and tears to change. But the words that made me cry. The thing he softly said. It stayed with me, it keeps messing with my head. He said: ""If Jesus Christ is alive and well. Then how come John & Elvis are dead?"". Youth, beautiful youth. We walked through the walls until we found the truth. And said: ""Change it, it's ugly just change it"". Everyone we used to know. Must have given up, so long ago. You can see it, it's written on their faces. And the inside of their clothes. But the words that made me cry. 'Cause I knew just what they meant. He turned to me and said:. ""Hey boy, if Jesus Christ is alive and well. Then how come John & Elvis are dead?"". ""Tell me if Jesus Christ is alive and well. Then how come Marvin & Elvis are dead?"". I said: ""If Jesus Christ is going to save us from ourselves. How come peace, love and Elvis are dead?"""

kissing a fool,"You are far. When I could have been your star. You listened to people. Who scared you to death, and from my heart. Strange that you were strong enough. To even make a start.

Runs with tired eyes. I'm hiding from you. And your solemn eyes. My god I thought you were. Someone to rely on. Me?. I guess I was a shoulder to cry on. A face on a lover with a fire in his heart. A man undercover but you tore me apart. Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again. CHORUS 2x. A face on a lover with a fire in his heart. A man undercover but you tore him apart.

She is just some worried daddy's girl. Even though there's nothing I can say. Its just human nature any way. Let her down easy. Her heart is on a dime. Let her down easy. And you'll grow up in time. In her strawberry eyes. The way she sees you signifies. That she's susceptible to your velvet lies. But if you must lay her down. May a butterscotch glow be her dressing gown. And please do not lead her on when you leave town. Even though there's nothing I can say. Its just human nature any way. Let her down easy. Her heart is on the line. Let her down easy. And you'll grow up in time. She's a woman now. With a daughter to make her proud. In her crayon world of paper clouds. She still remembers you. The first boy that she gave it to. And she laughs at how little then she knew. Let her down easy. Her heart is on the line. Let her down easy. And you'll grow up in time"

papa was a rollin' stone,"It was the third of September. That day I`ll always remember, yes I will. `Cause that was the day that my daddy died. Never had a chance to see him, no. Never heard nothin` but bad things about him. Mama, I`m depending on you to tell me the truth. Mama just hung her head and said. Chorus. ""Papa was a rollin` stone.

patience,"It's like a conversation, where no-one stops to breathe. Is it my imagination, or did God already leave the table?. Such destruction, and pure white castles in the sand. No time for introduction. With all that money changing hands. And the satellite says, ""Take a look at all we have"". But the old man says,. ""You want my family, for your liberty...I can't do that."". Look into the eyes of any patient man. Whether they be amber, green or blue,. There's a piece of God staring back at you. But they see our children, and the old folk fend for themselves. They see our broken women. On imaginary shelves. But the satellite says, ""Won't you people look at all we have?. Don't you want it?. Can't you see the things that you lack?"". Children in his arms, he turns his back."

praying for time,"These are the days of the open hand. They will not be the last. Look around now. These are the days of the beggars and the choosers. This is the year of the hungry man. Whose place is in the past. Hand in hand with ignorance. And legitimate excuses. The rich declare themselves poor. And most of us are not sure. If we have too much. But we'll take our chances. Because god's stopped keeping score. I guess somewhere along the way. He must have let us all out to play. Turned his back and all god's children. Crept out the back door. And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate. Hanging on to hope. When there is no hope to speak of. And the wounded skies above say it's much too late. Well maybe we should all be praying for time. These are the days of the empty hand. Oh you hold on to what you can. And charity is a coat you wear twice a year. This is the year of the guilty man. Your television takes a stand. And you find that what was over there. Is over here. So you scream from behind your door. Say ""what's mine is mine and not yours"". I may have too much but I'll take my chances. Because god's stopped keeping score. And you cling to the things they sold you. Did you cover your eyes when they told you. That he can't come back. Because he has no children to come back for. It's hard to love, there's so much to hate"
precious box,"In my house there’s a circle, where the life comes in. From the stars to my home, down through the stone,. I could have been so alone,. Without my precious box. Have I a family? I guess not. I’ve never seen a lot of beauty. In my life.. Well in your house there are servants, and the lights all dim. Such a beautiful home, your agent’s on the phone, they never. leave you alone. The party never stops!. You say that’s fantasy, I say “So what, I need a little beauty…”. So let me in,. You know you’ve kind of got under my skin. You know we never see a lot of the action round here. My dear. You may want to strip again. And you look so fine in your Gucci suit. And you’re making more money than your daddy. could have imagined. But people can go out of fashion, honey, yeah, any time. So take that picture, stop acting so dumb. Don’t you know that the moment will come. I will find someone like you. But with something extra, I’m sorry baby. I don’t know why. I don’t know why that is. The systematic breakdown of my community. You know I hate my job, I try to save but God. There’s just never enough. Switch on, the pressure - stops. You know the one for me, she’s on Fox. And she’s a little beauty…. Give me your life, give me your life, I want it. Because lately, it’s so freezing out here. (This side of the glass, life keeps kicking my ass). In so many ways, but you make it good. Made me the kind of happy that my baby never could. (This side of the glass…). So take that picture, stop acting so dumb. Don’t you know that the moment will come. I will find someone like you. But with something extra, I’m so sorry baby. I don’t know why. I don’t know why that is. Precious keeps me company. Keeps me from being alone. Because no-one comes in the morning. No-one comes in the evening time. I’d sit and wait for the phone to ring. I could be waiting my whole damn life. So sick of the same old faces. In this street, where nobody talks to me. And the funny side of the situation is. I don’t care, I’ll always be there. When you come down from the sky. And make yourself at home. In my house. Because these days it’s the money the money. The money, honey, or your life. I said don’t you know you can’t have both. Stop acting so dumb. The moment will come. I will find someone like you. Something extra, (always happens baby to me) sorry baby. I don’t know why (something). Said I don’t know why that is. You may want to strip again. You may want to let me in. You may want to sacrifice. More than you think is fair or right. You may want to think again. You may want to watch your friends. You may want to change your mind. You may wish you could turn back time"
round here,"My daddy got here on the gravy train. I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game. They went walking and she took his name. Round here. There was dancing in the afternoons those days. Waiting tables, chasing girls with the money he made. It was 1957, and love felt the same, love felt the same. Frightened little girl, she makes a break. Into the arms of... something better. Round here. I hear my mama call in Kingsbury Park. Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark. Waiting patiently to make my mark. Round here. And I remember my first day at school. And I remember trouble, and thinking I was so cool. I remember it all, like yesterday. Don't you. Every time I try to leave this place. Something inside says: ""You can do better"". Round here. So come with me, let me show you where I've lived. I want to put my hands in this earth again. Music fell like rain to the streets. The Specials and The Jam, to The Beat. Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world. I gotta be thankful that this crowded space. Is the place of my birth. When all that I wanted, was to be someone.. Two little Hitlers in an old church hall. Some cheesy covers and those neighbours that banged on the walls. Andy says it's time to show them all. Round here. Please sir, we two have other plans. Please sir you would not understand,. What's going on. Is magical, can't you see. That some of us do more than dream. Every time I try to leave this place. Something inside says: ""Keep on keeping, on and on..."". Around here. So come with me, let me show you where I've lived. I want to put my hands in this earth again. Music fell like rain to the streets. The Specials and The Jam, ABC. Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world. I gotta be thankful that this crowded space. Is the place of my birth. My birth,. In this town,. Yes I guess I got to be someone. To be somebody. In the Beautiful city. This place I call home. These streets of London. It's everything I know (everything and everybody). On the streets of London. I want to thank you. My daddy got here on the gravy train"

the grave,"The grave that they dug him had flowers. Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colors,. And the brown earth bleached white at the edge of his gravestone.. He's gone.. When the wars of our nation did beckon,. A man barely twenty did answer the calling.. Proud of the trust that he placed in our nation,. He's gone,. But Eternity knows him, and it knows what we've done.. And the rain fell like pearls on the leaves of the flowers. Leaving brown, muddy clay where the earth had been dry.. And deep in the trench he waited for hours,. As he held to his rifle and prayed not to die.. But the silence of night was shattered by fire. As guns and grenades blasted sharp through the air.. And one after another his comrades were slaughtered.. In morgue of Marines, alone standing there.. He crouched ever lower, ever lower with fear.. ""They can't let me die! The can't let me die here!. I'll cover myself with the mud and the earth.. I'll cover myself! I know I'm not brave!. The earth! the earth! the earth is my grave."". The grave that they dug him had flowers. Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colors,. And the brown earth bleached white at the edge of his gravestone.."
the strangest thing,"take my life. time has been twisting the knife. I don't recognise. people I care for. take my dreams. childish and weak at the seams. please don't analyse. please just be there for me. the things that I know. nobody told me. the seeds that are sown. they still control me. there's a liar in my head. there's a thief upon my bed. and the strangest thing. is I cannot get my eyes open. take my hand. lead me to some peaceful land. that I cannot find. inside my head. wake me with love. it's all I need. but in all this time. still no one said.... if I had not asked. would you have told me. if you call this love. why don't you hold me. there's a liar in my head. there's a thief upon my bed. and the strangest thing. is I cannot get my eyes open. give something I can hold. give me something to believe in. I am frightened for my soul, please, please. make love to me, send love through me. heal me with your crime. the only one who ever knew me,. we've wasted so much time. so much time."
these are the days of our lives,"Sometimes I get the feelin`. I was back in the old days - long ago. When we were kids, when we were young. Things seemed so perfect - you know?. The days were endless, we were crazy - we were. Young. The sun was always shinin` - we just lived for fun. Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don`t know. The rest of my life`s been - just a show.. Those were the days of our lives. The bad things in life were so few. Those daays are all gone now but one thing is true-. When I look and I find, I still love you.. You can`t turn back the clock, you can`t turn. Back the tide. Ain`t that a shaame? (Ain`t that a shame?). I`d like to go back one time on a roller coaster. Ride. When life was just a game. No use sitting and thinkin` on what you did. When you can lay back and anjoy it through your. Kids. Sometimes it seems like lately I just don`t know. Better sit back and go - -with the flow. `Cause these are the days of our lives. They`ve flown in the swiftness of time. These days are all gone now but some things remain. When I look and I find - no change. Those were the days of our lives. The bad things in life were so few. Those days are all gone now but one thing is trrue-. When I look and I find, I still love you. I still llove you. I love you. I still love you. I still love you. I still love you."
they won't go when i go,No more lying friends. Wanting tragic ends. Though they do pretend. They won't go when I go. All those bleeding hearts. With sorrows to impart. Were right here from the start. And they won't go when I go. And I'll go where I've longed. To go so long. Away from tears. Gone from painful cries. Away from saddened eyes. Along with him I'll bide. Because they won't go when I go. Big men feeling small. Weak ones standing tall. I will watch them fall. They won't go when I go. And I'll go where I've longed. To go so long. Away from tears. Unclean minds mislead the pure. The innocent will leave for sure. For them there is a resting place. People sinning just for fun. They will never see the sun. For they can never show their faces. There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner. Who will take more than he will give. He ain't hardly gonna give. The greed of man will be. Far away from me. And my soul will be free. They won't go when I go. Since my soul conceived. All that I believe. The kingdom I will see. 'Cause they won't go when I go. When I go. Where I'll go. No one can keep me. From my destiny.

Now you fly like an eagle above,. While I waltz away anyway,. I'll be waltzing my days away,. Searching for this woman I love.. She had a history of joy and pain in time,. And she chose to leave,. She had a thousand and one photographs,. That you would not believe,. She'll come to you in disguise,. She's there in your children's eyes,. Still our mother.... She' still your wife,. (So let her...). Waltz away dreaming till your day begins again. Free from the reasons for this state I'm in,. And oh, (trust me, she ain't going anywhere). I can't hold it all under one love,. (Trust me, she told me, when you're ready she'll be there). It was so long ago, (no don't let go of her). When we kissed in the streets,. Now you fly like an eagle above,. While I waltz away anyway,. I'll be waltzing my days away,. Searching for this woman I love.. And the moment you see me. I will live in your life. We will walk through my garden. I will see through your eyes,.

where did your heart go?,"I spend my nights down on the wharf. In unlit alleyways. By the church downtown. Where Sally prays. Come down sometime. We'll share a rusty can of corn.... And listen to the radio. I love you, I love you, it says.... CHORUS:. Where did your heart go. Did you put it on a train. Did you leave it in the rain. Or down in Mexico. You cry, but I don't know. I've heard it all before. There it goes again, the slamming of the door. Sometimes the river calls me. And at night it calls my name. Says ""put your troubles down beside me"". Things have always been the same.... And rock 'n' roll won't teach me. What the river said that night. I jumped into this beauty. And drifted out of sight.... CHORUS."

You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love. The kind that makes devils cry. So these days. My life has changed. And I'll be fine. But she just sits and counts the hours. Searching for her crime. So what's the use of pressing palms. If you won't keep such love from harm. It's a cruel world. You've so much to prove. And heaven helps the ones who wait for you.

When I saw that girl upon your arm,. I knew she won your heart with a fatal charm.. I said ""Soul Boy, let's hit the town!"". I said ""Soul Boy, what's with the frown?"". But in return, all you could say was. ""Hi George, meet my fiancee"". Young Guns,. Having some fun. Crazy ladies keep 'em on the run.. Wise guys realize there's danger in emotional ties..

careless whisper,"I feel so unsure. As I take your hand and lead to the dance floor. As the music dies, something in your eyes. Calls to mind the silver screen. And all its sad good-byes. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you are not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. And waste the chance that I've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. Time can never mend. The careless whispers of a good friend. To the heart and mind. Ignorance is kind. There's no comfort in the truth. Pain is all you'll find. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you are not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. And waste this chance that I've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. Never without your love. Tonight the music seems so loud. I wish that we could lose this crowd. Maybe it's better this way. We'd hurt each other. with the things we'd want to say. We could have been so good together. We could have lived this dance forever. But now who's gonna dance with me. Please stay. And I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. And waste the chance that I've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. (now that you're gone) now that you're gone. (now that you're gone) what I did so wrong. That you had to leave me alone"
freedom '90,"I won't let you down. I will not give you up. Gotta have some faith in the sound. It's the one good thing that I've got. I won't let you down. So please don't give me up. Because I would really, really love to stick around. Heaven knows I was just a young boy. Didn't know what I wanted to be. I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy. And I guess it was enough for me towin the race?. A prettier face!. Brand new clothes and a big fat place. On your rock and roll TV. But today the way I play the game is not the same. No way. Think I'm gonna get me some happy. I think there's something you should know. I think it's time I told you so. There's something deep inside of me. There's someone else I've got to be. Take back your picture in a frame. Take back your singing in the rain. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. All we have to do now. Is take these lies. and make them true somehow. All we have to see. Is that I don't belong to you. And you don't belong to me. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy. What a kick just a buddy and me. We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy. We were living in a fantasy. We won the race. Got out of the place. I went back home got a brand new face. For the boys on MTV. But today the way I play the game has got to change. Oh yeah. Now I'm gonna get myself happy. I think there's something you should know. I think it's time I stopped the show. There's something deep inside of me. There's someone I forgot to be. Take back your picture in a frame. Don't think that I'll be back again. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. All we have to do now. Is take these lies. and make them true somehow. All we have to see. Is that I don't belong to you. And you don't belong to me. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Well it looks like the road to heaven. But it feels like the road to hell. When I knew which side my bread was buttered. I took the knife as well. Posing for another picture. Everybody's got to sell. But when you shake your ass. They notice fast. And some mistakes were built to last. That's what you get. I say that's what you get. That's what you get for changing your mind. And after all this time. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. I'll hold on to my freedom. May not be what you want from me. Just the way it's got to be. Lose the face now. I've got to live"

don't let the sun go down on me (feat. elton john),"I can't light no more of your darkness. All my pictures seem to fade to black and white. I'm growing tired and time stands still before me. Frozen here on the ladder of my life. It's much too late to save myself from falling. I took a chance and changed your way of life. But you misread my meaning when I met you. Closed the door and left me blinded by the light. Don't let the sun go down on me. Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see. I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free. But losing everything is like the sun going down on me. I can't find, oh the right romantic line. But see me once and see the way I feel. Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm. But these cuts I have. They need love to help them heal. Don't let the sun go down on me. Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see. I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free. Cos losing everything is like the sun going down on me. Don't let the sun go down on me. Although I search myself, it's always someone else that I see. I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, baby. Cos losing everything is like the sun going down on me"

Oh baby, I reconsider my foolish notion. Well, I need someone to hold me,. But I'll wait for something more.. Cause I gotta have Faith.... (repeat chorus). Before this river. Becomes an ocean. Before you throw my heart back on the floor. (I've just got to have faith). I've reconsidered my foolish notion. Yeah, I need someone to hold me,. But I'll wait for something more..... (pause).

kissing a fool,"You are far. When I could have been your star. You listened to people. Who scared you to death, and from my heart. Strange that you were strong enough. To even make a start. But you'll never find. Peace of mind. Till you listen to your heart. People. You can never change the way they feel. Better let them do just what they want. For they will. If you let them. Steal your heart from you. People. Will always make a lover feel a fool. But you knew I loved you. We could have shown them all. We should have seen love through. Fooled me with the tears in your eyes. Covered me with kisses and lies. So goodbye. But please don't take my heart. You are far. But I'm never gonna be your star. I'll pick up the pieces. And mend my heart. Maybe I'll be strong enough. I don't know where to start. But I'll never find. Peace of mind. While I listen to my heart. People.... You can never change the way they feel. Better let them do just what they want. For they will. If you let them. Steal your heart from you. People. Will always make a lover feel a fool. But you knew I loved you.

One you really can surrender with. I will wait for you. Like I always do. There's something there. That can't compare with any other. You are far. When I could have been your star. You listened to people. Who scared you to death, and from my heart. Strange that I was wrong enough. To think you'd love me too. I guess you were kissing a fool. You must have been kissing a fool"
praying for time,"These are the days of the open hand. They will not be the last. Look around now. These are the days of the beggars and the choosers. This is the year of the hungry man. Whose place is in the past. Hand in hand with ignorance. And legitimate excuses. The rich declare themselves poor. And most of us are not sure. If we have too much. But we'll take our chances. Because god's stopped keeping score. I guess somewhere along the way. He must have let us all out to play. Turned his back and all god's children. Crept out the back door. And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate. Hanging on to hope. When there is no hope to speak of. And the wounded skies above say it's much too late. Well maybe we should all be praying for time. These are the days of the empty hand. Oh you hold on to what you can. And charity is a coat you wear twice a year. This is the year of the guilty man. Your television takes a stand. And you find that what was over there. Is over here. So you scream from behind your door. Say ""what's mine is mine and not yours"". I may have too much but I'll take my chances. Because god's stopped keeping score. And you cling to the things they sold you. Did you cover your eyes when they told you. That he can't come back. Because he has no children to come back for. It's hard to love, there's so much to hate"
jesus to a child,"Kindness in your eyes. I guess you heard me cry. You smiled at me like Jesus to a child. I'm blessed I know. Heaven sent and heaven stole. You smiled at me like Jesus to a child. And what have I learned from all this pain. I thought I never feel the same about anyone or anything again. But now I know. Chorus:. When you find a love. When you know that it exists. Then the lover that you miss. Will come to you on those cold, cold nights. When you've been loved. When you know it holds such bliss. Then the lover that you kissed. Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight. Sadness in my eyes. No one guessed and no one tried. You smiled at me like Jesus to a child. Loveless and cold. With your last breath you saved my soul. You smiled at me like Jesus to a child. And what have I learned from all these tears. I've waited for you all those years. Then just when it began he took your love away. But I still say. Chorus. So the words you could not say. I'll sing them for you. And the love we would have made. I'll make it for two. For every single memory. Has become a part of me. You will always be my love. Well I've been loved so I know just what love is. And the lover that I kissed is always by my side. Oh the lover I still miss... was Jesus to a child"

you have been loved,"She takes the back road and the lane. Past the school that has no changed. In all this time. She thinks of when the boy was young. All the battles she had won. Just to give him life. That man. She loved that man. For all his life. But now we meet to bring him flowers. And only God knows why. For what's the use in pressing pamls. When children fade in mother's arms. It's a cruel world. We've so much to loose. And what we have to learn we rarely choose. So if it's God who took her son. He cannot be the one living in her mind. Take care my love, she said. Don't think that God is dead. Take care my love, she said. You have been loved. If I was weak, forgive me. But I was terrified. You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love. The kind that makes devils cry. So these days. My life has changed. And I'll be fine. But she just sits and counts the hours. Searching for her crime. So what's the use of pressing palms. If you won't keep such love from harm. It's a cruel world. You've so much to prove. And heaven helps the ones who wait for you. Well I've no daughters, I've no sons. Guess I'm the only one. Living in my life. Take care my love, he said. Don't think that God is dead. Take care my love, he said. You have been loved..."
cowboys and angels,(Piano intro). When your heart`s in someone else`s hands. Monkey see and monkey do. Their wish is your command. You`re not to blame. Everyone`s the same. All you do is love and love is all you do. I should know by now the way I fought for you. You`re not to blame. Everyone`s the same. I know you think that you`re safe. Mister. Harmless deception that keeps love at bay. It`s the ones who resist that we most want to kiss. Wouldn`t you say?. Cowboys and angels. They all have the time for you. Why should I imagine. That I`d be a find for you. Why should I imagine. That I`d have something to say. But that scar on your face. That beautiful face of yours. In your heart there`s a trace. Of someone before. When your heart`s in someone else`s plans. Things you say and things you do. They don`t understand. It`s such a shame. Always ends the same. You can call it love but I don`t think it`s true. You should know by now. I`m not the boy for you. You`re not to blame. Always ends the same. I know you think that you`re safe. Sister. Harmless affection that keeps things this way. It`s the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss. Who will pay. Cowboys and angels. They all take a shine to you. Why should I imagine. That I was designed for you. Why should I believe. That you would stay. But that scar on your face. That beautiful face of yours. Don`t you think that I know. They hurt you before. Take this man to your bed. Maybe his hands. Will help you forget. Please be stronger than your past. The future may still give you a chance
last christmas,"Last Christmas. CHORUS:. Last Christmas. I gave you my heart. But the very next day you gave it away. This year. To save me from tears. I'll give it to someone special. CHORUS. Once bitten and twice shy. I keep my distance. But you still catch my eye. Tell me baby. Do you recognize me?. Well. It's been a year. It doesn't surprise me. HAPPY CHRISTMAS. I wrapped it up and sent it. With a note saying ""I love you"". I meant it. Now I know what a fool I've been. But if you kissed me now. I know you'd fool me again. CHORUS. Crowded room. Runs with tired eyes. I'm hiding from you. And your solemn eyes. My god I thought you were. Someone to rely on. Me?. I guess I was a shoulder to cry on. A face on a lover with a fire in his heart. A man undercover but you tore me apart. Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again. CHORUS 2x. A face on a lover with a fire in his heart. A man undercover but you tore him apart. Maybe next year I'll give it to someone."
waiting for that day,"So every day I see you in some other face. They crack a smile, talk a while. Try to take your place. My memory serves me far too well. I just sit here on this mountain thinking to myself. You're a fool boy. Why don't you go down. Find somebody. Find somebody else. My memory serves me far too well. It's not as though we just broke up. It's not as though it was yesterday. But something I just can't explain. Something in me needs this pain. I know I'll never see your face again. C'mon now.

amazing,"GEORGE MICHAEL - Amazing. Album: Patience (2004). . I was mixed up when you came to me. Too broke to fix. Said 'daddy get you gone, I'm missing my baby'. Still missing my baby. I was stitched up by the hands of fate. Said how you gonna make it on your own. If luck is a lady?. Maybe luck is a lady. I was going down for the third time. My heart was broken I was not open. To your suggestions. I had so many questions. That you just kissed away. Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise. The day you walked in and changed my life. I think it's amazing. The way that love can set you free. So I walk in the midday sun. I never thought that my saviour would come. I think it's amazing. I think it's amazing. I think you're amazing. You tried to save me from myself. Said 'Darling kiss as many as you want!. My love's still available. And I know that you are insatiable'. We're like victims of the same disease. Look at your Big Bad Daddy, and your mom. And your mom... was always acting crazy. I was going down for the third time. My heart was broken,. I thought that loving you was out of the question. Then I saw my reflection. Saying please don't let this go. Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise. The day you walked in changed my life. I think it's amazing. The way love can set you free. So now I walk in the midday sun. I never thought that my saviour would come. I think it's amazing. I think you're amazing. Celebrate the love of the one you're with. Celebrate, this life with you baby. I think you should celebrate yeah. Don't put your love in chains baby. No, no, walk in the midday sun. I thought I was dreaming. I think it's amazing. I think you're amazing. I said celebrate the love of the one you're with. As this life gets colder. And the devil inside. tells you to give up"

careless whisper,"I feel so unsure. As I take your hand and lead to the dance floor. As the music dies, something in your eyes. Calls to mind the silver screen. And all its sad good-byes. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you are not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. And waste the chance that I've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. Time can never mend. The careless whispers of a good friend. To the heart and mind. Ignorance is kind. There's no comfort in the truth. Pain is all you'll find. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you are not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. And waste this chance that I've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. Never without your love. Tonight the music seems so loud. I wish that we could lose this crowd. Maybe it's better this way. We'd hurt each other. with the things we'd want to say. We could have been so good together. We could have lived this dance forever. But now who's gonna dance with me. Please stay. And I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. And waste the chance that I've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. (now that you're gone) now that you're gone. (now that you're gone) what I did so wrong. That you had to leave me alone"

cowboys and angels,(Piano intro). When your heart`s in someone else`s hands. Monkey see and monkey do. Their wish is your command. You`re not to blame. Everyone`s the same. All you do is love and love is all you do. I should know by now the way I fought for you. You`re not to blame. Everyone`s the same. I know you think that you`re safe. Mister. Harmless deception that keeps love at bay. It`s the ones who resist that we most want to kiss. Wouldn`t you say?. Cowboys and angels. They all have the time for you. Why should I imagine. That I`d be a find for you. Why should I imagine. That I`d have something to say. But that scar on your face. That beautiful face of yours. In your heart there`s a trace. Of someone before. When your heart`s in someone else`s plans. Things you say and things you do. They don`t understand. It`s such a shame. Always ends the same. You can call it love but I don`t think it`s true. You should know by now. I`m not the boy for you. You`re not to blame. Always ends the same. I know you think that you`re safe. Sister. Harmless affection that keeps things this way. It`s the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss. Who will pay. Cowboys and angels. They all take a shine to you. Why should I imagine. That I was designed for you. Why should I believe. That you would stay. But that scar on your face. That beautiful face of yours. Don`t you think that I know. They hurt you before. Take this man to your bed. Maybe his hands. Will help you forget. Please be stronger than your past. The future may still give you a chance
crazyman dance,"Well I'm still here. But I'm so scared. Got myself in trouble, so much trouble. I know I've got to make it. But I just can't take New York. My middle name is fear. I have a vacant stare. And it's been so long since my body's been warm. I know I've got to make it. But I just can't take New York. I came here. All dreams and wide eyes in the big, big city. No family, no money. And I don't even know what's hit me. He hasn't seen a doctor. Since he got here in the spring. Went to the Medicentre. But they wouldn't let him in. Without a green card. Life can be so hard. Take pity on a man without a home of his own. How could he ever have known?. Every street and every corner. Watch them drowning. Watch them do the Crazyman Dance. Men and Women to the slaughter. We just stand and watch them. Do the Crazyman Dance. It's been one whole year. And it's just not fair. For all the pushing and shoving. I've still got nothing. I'm never gonna make it. And I'm stuck here in New York. So people don't come near. Unless you've a dollar to spare. 'Cause you know what they say. About madmen on the subways of New York. Believe it. Yesterday's newspapers. I wrap them around my body. Outside these skyscrapers. I wait for the night to hit me. And boy, does it hit me. Every street and every corner. Watch them drowning. Watch them do the Crazyman Dance. For a nickel or a quarter. For your pleasure. Watch them do the Crazyman Dance. I'm coming to London. I'm coming to Paris. I'm coming to make you good clean people embarrassed. Why don't you look at my face. Why don't you look in my eyes. You'd rather look at your feet. You'd rather look at the skies. Oh, you'd look anywhere. But at a man whose pure existence. Says 'I ain't got time'. And I don't care. I don't care. You just don't care."

december song (i dreamed of christmas),"Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. May your every New Year dream come true. Sweet December song. The melody that saved me. On those less than silent nights. When snow would fall upon my bed. White sugar from Jesus. And take me to the day. She could always smile. The Virgin Child would always show, you see. Just to save me. (Just to save me). There was always Christmas time. To wipe the year away. I guess that morning they?d decided. That the war would have to wait. There was always Christmas time. Jesus came to stay. I could believe in peace on Earth. And I could watch TV all day. So I dreamed of Christmas. Maybe since you?ve gone. I went a little crazy. God knows they can see (the child). But the snow that falls upon my bed. That loving I needed. Falls every single day. For each and every child. The Virgin smiles for all to see. But you kept her from me. There was always Christmas time. To wipe the year away. I guess that morning they?d decided. That the war would have to wait. There was always Christmas time. Jesus came to stay. I could believe in peace on Earth. And I could watch TV all day. And so I dreamed of Christmas. Yes, I dreamed like you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. May your every New Year dream come true"
desafinado (english),"If you say my singing is off key, my love. You would hurt my feelings, don't you see, my love ?. I wish I had an ear like yours,. A voice that would behave. All I have is feeling. And the voice God gave. You insist my music goes against the rules. Yes, but rules were never made for lovesick fools. I wrote this song for you. But you don't care. It's a crooked song, ah,. But my heart is there. The thing that you would see if you would play the part. Is even if I'm out of tune I have a gentle heart. I took your picture with my trusty Rolliflex. And now all I have developed is complex. Possibly in vain, I hope you weaken, oh my love. And forget those rigid rules that undermine my dream of. A life of love and music with someone who'll understand. That even though I may be out of tune when I attempt to say. How much I love you. And all that matters is the message that I bring,. Which is: my dear one, I love you."
do they know it's christmas,"(Bob Geldof & Midge Ure). Performed by Band Aid. Recorded on November 25, 1986. It's Christmastime. There's no need to be afraid. At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade. And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy. Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime. But say a prayer. Pray for the other ones. At Christmastime it's hard, but when you're having fun. There's a world outside your window. And it's a world of dread and fear. Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears. And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging. chimes of doom. Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you. And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime. The greatest gift they'll get this year is life. (Oooh) Where nothing ever grows. No rain nor rivers flow. Do they know it's Christmastime at all?. (Here's to you) raise a glass for everyone. (Here's to them) underneath that burning sun. Do they know it's Christmastime at all?. Feed the world. Feed the world. Feed the world. Let them know it's Christmastime again. Feed the world. Let them know it's Christmastime again."
do you really want to know,"When I ask those questions, baby. It's just to get them out of my head. Cause they turn around inside it. Then they spill off to our bed. Do I really want to know?. Do I really want to know your life?. Would I have to let you go?. Could I listen to my heart if my head stops to think twice?. When I've been a good boy. When I've been a bad boy. I have too much fun. But baby so did everyone. I've never been an angel. But things are gonna change, change, change. So do you really want to know?. Do you really want to know my life?. Would you have to let me go?. Could you listen to your heart if your head stopped to think twice?. If you knew every woman. And I knew every man. We never would have made it past holding hands. I guess the saying is no longer true. That what you don't know can hurt you. I guess there is just no question, baby. You know what you're doing in bed. If I want your touch. Should I know too much. Some things are better left unsaid. So do I really want to know?. Do I really want to know your life?. Would I have to let you go?. Could I listen to my heart if my head starts to think twice?. (Tell me baby, Cause one thing to guess is one thing to know,. and don't you think that maybe baby I've got secrets of my own?). If I knew every woman. And you knew every man. We never would have made it past holding hands. I used to say it but it's no longer true. Cause what you don't know can really hurt you (Can kill you baby). And even as we speak. The world is full of lovers."
don't let the sun go down on me (feat. elton john),"I can't light no more of your darkness. All my pictures seem to fade to black and white. I'm growing tired and time stands still before me. Frozen here on the ladder of my life. It's much too late to save myself from falling. I took a chance and changed your way of life. But you misread my meaning when I met you. Closed the door and left me blinded by the light. Don't let the sun go down on me. Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see. I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free. But losing everything is like the sun going down on me. I can't find, oh the right romantic line. But see me once and see the way I feel. Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm. But these cuts I have. They need love to help them heal. Don't let the sun go down on me. Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see. I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free. Cos losing everything is like the sun going down on me. Don't let the sun go down on me. Although I search myself, it's always someone else that I see. I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, baby. Cos losing everything is like the sun going down on me"
edge of heaven,"I would lock you up. But I could not bear to hear you. Screaming to be set free. I would chain you up. If I'd thought you'd swear. The only one that mattered was me, me, me.

I will be the one who loves you. Until the end of time. That's all I wanted. But sometimes love can be mistaken. For a crime. That's all I wanted. Just to see my baby's. Blue eyed shine. This time I think that my lover. Understands me. If we have faith in each other. Then we can be. Strong. I will be your father figure. Put your tiny hand in mine. I will be your preacher teacher. Anything you have in mind. I will be your father figure. I have had enough of crime. I will be the one who loves you. Until the end of time. If you are the desert. I'll be the sea. If you ever hunger. Hunger for me. Whatever you ask for. That's what I'll be. So when you remember the ones who have lied. Who said that they cared. But then laughed as you cried. Beautiful Darling. Don't think of me. Because all I ever wanted. It's in your eyes baby, baby. And love can't lie, no.... (Greet me with the eyes of a child). My love is always tell me to.... (Heaven is a kiss and a smile). Just hold on, hold on. I won't let you go, my baby. I will be your father figure. Put your tiny hand in mine. I will be your preacher teacher. Anything you have in mind. I will be your father figure. I have had enough of crime. (So I am gonna love you). Until the end of time. I will be your father. I will be your preacher. I will be your daddy. I will be the one who loves you until the end of time"

freedom '90,"I won't let you down. I will not give you up. Gotta have some faith in the sound. It's the one good thing that I've got. I won't let you down. So please don't give me up. Because I would really, really love to stick around. Heaven knows I was just a young boy. Didn't know what I wanted to be. I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy. And I guess it was enough for me towin the race?. A prettier face!. Brand new clothes and a big fat place. On your rock and roll TV. But today the way I play the game is not the same. No way. Think I'm gonna get me some happy. I think there's something you should know. I think it's time I told you so. There's something deep inside of me. There's someone else I've got to be. Take back your picture in a frame. Take back your singing in the rain. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. All we have to do now. Is take these lies. and make them true somehow. All we have to see. Is that I don't belong to you. And you don't belong to me. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy. What a kick just a buddy and me. We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy. We were living in a fantasy. We won the race. Got out of the place. I went back home got a brand new face. For the boys on MTV. But today the way I play the game has got to change. Oh yeah. Now I'm gonna get myself happy. I think there's something you should know. I think it's time I stopped the show. There's something deep inside of me. There's someone I forgot to be. Take back your picture in a frame. Don't think that I'll be back again. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. All we have to do now. Is take these lies. and make them true somehow. All we have to see. Is that I don't belong to you. And you don't belong to me. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Freedom, freedom, freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Well it looks like the road to heaven. But it feels like the road to hell. When I knew which side my bread was buttered. I took the knife as well. Posing for another picture. Everybody's got to sell. But when you shake your ass. They notice fast. And some mistakes were built to last. That's what you get. I say that's what you get. That's what you get for changing your mind. And after all this time. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. I'll hold on to my freedom. May not be what you want from me. Just the way it's got to be. Lose the face now. I've got to live"

frosty the snowman,Frosty the snowman. Was a jolly happy soul. With a corn cop pipe. And a button nose. And two eyes. Made out of coal. Frosty the snowman. Is a fairy tale they say. He was made out of snow. But the children know how. He came to life one day. There must of been. Some magic in. That ol' silk cap. They found. For when they placed it. On his head. He began to dance around. Frosty the snowman. Was alive as he could be. And the children say. He could laugh and play. Just the same. As you and me. Frosty the snowman. Knew the snow. Was hot that day. So he said lets run. And have some fun. Before I melt away. Down to the village. With a broom stick. In his hand. Runnin' here and there. All around the square. Sayin' catch me. If you can. He led them down. The streets of town. Right. To the traffic cop. And he only. Paused a moment. When he heard him. Holler stop. Frosty the snowman. Had to hurry on his way. But he. Waved goodbye sayin'. Please don't cry. I'll be back again. Some day

Hand to mouth. So she ran to the arms of America. And she kissed the powers that be. And someone told me. Someone told me. That the gods believe in nothing. So with empty hands I pray. And I tell myself one day. They just might see me.

heartbeat,"Another summer, another vacation is over. A September morning with the sun and smell of the clover. Down by the gates we sit and watch all our friends go by. And pretend we don't hear the bell that rings through the. summer sky. I was happy with the kisses she gave me. It's just that happy was she made me. Happy that was until I saw you. Chorus:. Heartbeat, heartbeat, why do you fail me now?. You hurt me, desert me in my darkest hour. Heartbeat, heartbeat, why do you keep me here?. How could I help but admire her beauty. Standing on the line between desire and duty. Heartbeat, heartbeat, it will end in tears. I need a lover that loves such a dangerous place to be. Oh, if we were meant for each other then why don't you answer me. Don't keep me waiting, you know that I long to be by your side. I was happy with the kisses she gave me. Now there's nothing on earth that can save me. Why should I care I can have you?."

i knew you were waiting for me (feat. aretha franklin),"Like a warrior that fights. And wins the battle. I know the taste of victory. Though I went through some nights. Consumed by the shadows.

When the river was deep I didn't falter. When the mountain was high I still believed. When the valley was low iit didn't stop me, no no. I knew you were waiting. I knew you were waiting for me. With and endless desire I kept on searching. Sure in time our eyes would meet. Like the bridge is on fire. The hurt is over, one touch and you set me free. No, I don't regret a single moment. No I don't looking back. When I think of all those disappointments. I just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh. When the river was deep I didn't falter. When the mountain was high I still believed. When the valley was low iit didn't stop me, no no. I knew you were waiting. I knew you were waiting for me. So we were drawn together through destiny. I know this love we share was meant to be.

idol,"He was a light star. Tripping on a high wire. Bulldog stubborn, born uneven. A classless creature, a man for all seasons. But don't bet them. They can't take him. To the very bottom. Because they made him and they'll waste him. And I don't believe that I want to watch them. `Cause the fifties shifted out of gear. He was an idol then, now he's an idol here. But his face has changed, he's not the same no more. And I have to say that I like the way his music sounded before. He was tight-assed. Walking on broken glass. Highly prized in the wallet size. The number one crush in a schoolgirl's eyes. But don't pretend that it won't end. In the depth of your despair. You went from lame suits right down to tennis shoes. To peanuts from the lion's share"

I hope it won't offend. The trust we have cuz. I don't want this to end. No, no, no, baby. If you think we will lose what we have. Then I'd just rather stay the same. (Rather stay, rather stay the same). Cuz I don't want to chose between two. Of the most precious things to me. (Precious things to me, oh yeah). Chorus. [Whitney](George). If we (If we). Take this chance (Take this chance). And extend to each other romance. I hope (Baby I hope). It would be (It would be). The right thing for you and me, oh yeah. Baby, baby, baby, baby. Chorus.

Then the lover that you miss. Will come to you on those cold, cold nights. When you've been loved. When you know it holds such bliss. Then the lover that you kissed.

Then just when it began he took your love away. But I still say. Chorus. So the words you could not say. I'll sing them for you. And the love we would have made. I'll make it for two.

john and elvis are dead,"Close friend of mine as a child fell into a slumber. No sign of life since '75. Then one day he just, what do you know. I guess God just called his number. He called me up he called me up and said:. ""I've been awake about a week. I'm thinking about asking the doctor. If he could put me back to sleep"". Then he laughed and said:. ""Hey all the girls they look the same"". Don't they know just what their mothers. Paid in blood, and tears to change. But the words that made me cry. The thing he softly said. It stayed with me, it keeps messing with my head. He said: ""If Jesus Christ is alive and well. Then how come John & Elvis are dead?"". Youth, beautiful youth. We walked through the walls until we found the truth. And said: ""Change it, it's ugly just change it"". Everyone we used to know. Must have given up, so long ago. You can see it, it's written on their faces. And the inside of their clothes. But the words that made me cry. 'Cause I knew just what they meant. He turned to me and said:. ""Hey boy, if Jesus Christ is alive and well. Then how come John & Elvis are dead?"". ""Tell me if Jesus Christ is alive and well. Then how come Marvin & Elvis are dead?"". I said: ""If Jesus Christ is going to save us from ourselves. How come peace, love and Elvis are dead?"""

kissing a fool,"You are far. When I could have been your star. You listened to people. Who scared you to death, and from my heart. Strange that you were strong enough. To even make a start.

My mother had a brother. Same desire, different time. Seems the empty spaces tortured him. Until he took his own life. I don't know why I waited so long for love. I just don't know what I was thinking of. All that wasted time. But mama will you tell him from your boy. The times they changed. I guess the world was getting warmer. While we got stronger. Mother will you tell him about my joy. I live each day with him. Your son came out, yeah. And I'm still breathing it in. And I swear now that freedom is here. I'm gonna taste it all for you boy. I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little torn. I'm making so much love. (I'm making so much love). So those of us who have nothing to fear. We've got to make damn sure that it was worth it. I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little stoned. I'm making so much love. (I'm making so much love). I was a prisoner, but he saved me. Broke into my dreams and said: ""Who cares?"". I was a prisoner, so disgrace me. I'm glad to be home. And I don't believe they care"
nothing looks the same in the light,"I watch you breathe, I cannot sleep,. I touch your hair, I kiss your skin,. And hope the morning sun won't wake you too soon.. For when you wake, and look at me,. You never know, you just might see,. Another boy who crept in your room.... Take your time...(that's what you told me),. Take your time.... But I fell head first, and I just don't know what to do.. Chorus:. Nothing looks the same in the light,. Only a fool like me would take to heart,. The things you said you meant last night.. Nothing looks the same in the light,. I'll keep my feet firm on the ground.. Nothing looks the same in the light,. There's danger in a stranger,. With a warm hand and a kiss so right.. Nothing looks the same in the light,. It's been a pleasure, - see you around.... I watch the sun, upon the sheets.. I hear a car, out on the street,. And gently pull you close, it's over too soon.. What can I do, but wait and see,. Hold on to you, please stay with me,. Because you're the first, and I want to stay here with you.. Chorus."

patience,"It's like a conversation, where no-one stops to breathe. Is it my imagination, or did God already leave the table?. Such destruction, and pure white castles in the sand. No time for introduction. With all that money changing hands. And the satellite says, ""Take a look at all we have"". But the old man says,. ""You want my family, for your liberty...I can't do that."". Look into the eyes of any patient man. Whether they be amber, green or blue,. There's a piece of God staring back at you. But they see our children, and the old folk fend for themselves. They see our broken women. On imaginary shelves. But the satellite says, ""Won't you people look at all we have?. Don't you want it?. Can't you see the things that you lack?"". Children in his arms, he turns his back."

praying for time,"These are the days of the open hand. They will not be the last. Look around now. These are the days of the beggars and the choosers. This is the year of the hungry man. Whose place is in the past. Hand in hand with ignorance. And legitimate excuses. The rich declare themselves poor. And most of us are not sure. If we have too much. But we'll take our chances. Because god's stopped keeping score. I guess somewhere along the way. He must have let us all out to play. Turned his back and all god's children. Crept out the back door. And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate. Hanging on to hope. When there is no hope to speak of. And the wounded skies above say it's much too late. Well maybe we should all be praying for time. These are the days of the empty hand. Oh you hold on to what you can. And charity is a coat you wear twice a year. This is the year of the guilty man. Your television takes a stand. And you find that what was over there. Is over here. So you scream from behind your door. Say ""what's mine is mine and not yours"". I may have too much but I'll take my chances. Because god's stopped keeping score. And you cling to the things they sold you. Did you cover your eyes when they told you. That he can't come back. Because he has no children to come back for. It's hard to love, there's so much to hate"
precious box,"In my house there’s a circle, where the life comes in. From the stars to my home, down through the stone,. I could have been so alone,. Without my precious box. Have I a family? I guess not. I’ve never seen a lot of beauty. In my life.. Well in your house there are servants, and the lights all dim. Such a beautiful home, your agent’s on the phone, they never. leave you alone. The party never stops!. You say that’s fantasy, I say “So what, I need a little beauty…”. So let me in,. You know you’ve kind of got under my skin. You know we never see a lot of the action round here. My dear. You may want to strip again. And you look so fine in your Gucci suit. And you’re making more money than your daddy. could have imagined. But people can go out of fashion, honey, yeah, any time. So take that picture, stop acting so dumb. Don’t you know that the moment will come. I will find someone like you. But with something extra, I’m sorry baby. I don’t know why. I don’t know why that is. The systematic breakdown of my community. You know I hate my job, I try to save but God. There’s just never enough. Switch on, the pressure - stops. You know the one for me, she’s on Fox. And she’s a little beauty…. Give me your life, give me your life, I want it. Because lately, it’s so freezing out here. (This side of the glass, life keeps kicking my ass). In so many ways, but you make it good. Made me the kind of happy that my baby never could. (This side of the glass…). So take that picture, stop acting so dumb. Don’t you know that the moment will come. I will find someone like you. But with something extra, I’m so sorry baby. I don’t know why. I don’t know why that is. Precious keeps me company. Keeps me from being alone. Because no-one comes in the morning. No-one comes in the evening time. I’d sit and wait for the phone to ring. I could be waiting my whole damn life. So sick of the same old faces. In this street, where nobody talks to me. And the funny side of the situation is. I don’t care, I’ll always be there. When you come down from the sky. And make yourself at home. In my house. Because these days it’s the money the money. The money, honey, or your life. I said don’t you know you can’t have both. Stop acting so dumb. The moment will come. I will find someone like you. Something extra, (always happens baby to me) sorry baby. I don’t know why (something). Said I don’t know why that is. You may want to strip again. You may want to let me in. You may want to sacrifice. More than you think is fair or right. You may want to think again. You may want to watch your friends. You may want to change your mind. You may wish you could turn back time"
round here,"My daddy got here on the gravy train. I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game. They went walking and she took his name. Round here. There was dancing in the afternoons those days. Waiting tables, chasing girls with the money he made. It was 1957, and love felt the same, love felt the same. Frightened little girl, she makes a break. Into the arms of... something better. Round here. I hear my mama call in Kingsbury Park. Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark. Waiting patiently to make my mark. Round here. And I remember my first day at school. And I remember trouble, and thinking I was so cool. I remember it all, like yesterday. Don't you. Every time I try to leave this place. Something inside says: ""You can do better"". Round here. So come with me, let me show you where I've lived. I want to put my hands in this earth again. Music fell like rain to the streets. The Specials and The Jam, to The Beat. Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world. I gotta be thankful that this crowded space. Is the place of my birth. When all that I wanted, was to be someone.. Two little Hitlers in an old church hall. Some cheesy covers and those neighbours that banged on the walls. Andy says it's time to show them all. Round here. Please sir, we two have other plans. Please sir you would not understand,. What's going on. Is magical, can't you see. That some of us do more than dream. Every time I try to leave this place. Something inside says: ""Keep on keeping, on and on..."". Around here. So come with me, let me show you where I've lived. I want to put my hands in this earth again. Music fell like rain to the streets. The Specials and The Jam, ABC. Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world. I gotta be thankful that this crowded space. Is the place of my birth. My birth,. In this town,. Yes I guess I got to be someone. To be somebody. In the Beautiful city. This place I call home. These streets of London. It's everything I know (everything and everybody). On the streets of London. I want to thank you. My daddy got here on the gravy train"

So if you love me, say you love me. But if you don’t just let me go. Cuz teacher there are things that I don’t want to learn. And the last one I had made me cry. So I don’t wanna learn to hold you, touch you. I think that your mine. Because there ain’t no joy. For an uptown boy. Who’s teacher has told him Good bye. Goodbye...Goodbye. When you were just a stranger. And I was at your feet. I didn’t feel the danger. Now I feel the heat. That look in your eyes. Tellin’ me no. So you think that you love me. Know that you need me. I wrote this song, I know its wrong, Just let me go. Teacher there are things that I don’t want to learn. And the last one I had made me cry. So I don’t wanna learn to hold you, touch you. I think that your mine. Cuz there ain’t no joy. For an uptown boy. Who’s teacher has told him Goodbye…. So when you say that you need me. That you'll never leave me. I know your wrong, your not that strong. Let me go. And teacher there are things that I still have to learn. But the one thing I have. Is my pride. Oh, so I don’t wanna learn to hold you, touch you. I think that your mine. Because there ain’t no joy. For an uptown boy. Who just isn’t willing to try. I’m so cold Inside. Maybe Just one more try. By Ismael Dünsbäch"
the first time ever i saw your face,"the first time ever I saw your face. I thought the sun rose in your eyes. and the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave. to the dark and endless skies, my love. to the dark and empty skies. the first time ever I kissed your mouth. I felt the earth move in my hands. like the trembling heart of a captive bird. that was there at my command, my love. that was there at my command. the first time I ever lay with you. and felt you heart so close to mine. and I knew our joy would fill the world. and would last till the and of time, my love. it would last till the end of time. the first time ever I saw your face. your face, your face."
the grave,"The grave that they dug him had flowers. Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colors,. And the brown earth bleached white at the edge of his gravestone.. He's gone.. When the wars of our nation did beckon,. A man barely twenty did answer the calling.. Proud of the trust that he placed in our nation,. He's gone,. But Eternity knows him, and it knows what we've done.. And the rain fell like pearls on the leaves of the flowers. Leaving brown, muddy clay where the earth had been dry.. And deep in the trench he waited for hours,. As he held to his rifle and prayed not to die.. But the silence of night was shattered by fire. As guns and grenades blasted sharp through the air.. And one after another his comrades were slaughtered.. In morgue of Marines, alone standing there.. He crouched ever lower, ever lower with fear.. ""They can't let me die! The can't let me die here!. I'll cover myself with the mud and the earth.. I'll cover myself! I know I'm not brave!. The earth! the earth! the earth is my grave."". The grave that they dug him had flowers. Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colors,. And the brown earth bleached white at the edge of his gravestone.."
the strangest thing,"take my life. time has been twisting the knife. I don't recognise. people I care for. take my dreams. childish and weak at the seams. please don't analyse. please just be there for me. the things that I know. nobody told me. the seeds that are sown. they still control me. there's a liar in my head. there's a thief upon my bed. and the strangest thing. is I cannot get my eyes open. take my hand. lead me to some peaceful land. that I cannot find. inside my head. wake me with love. it's all I need. but in all this time. still no one said.... if I had not asked. would you have told me. if you call this love. why don't you hold me. there's a liar in my head. there's a thief upon my bed. and the strangest thing. is I cannot get my eyes open. give something I can hold. give me something to believe in. I am frightened for my soul, please, please. make love to me, send love through me. heal me with your crime. the only one who ever knew me,. we've wasted so much time. so much time."
these are the days of our lives,"Sometimes I get the feelin`. I was back in the old days - long ago. When we were kids, when we were young. Things seemed so perfect - you know?. The days were endless, we were crazy - we were. Young. The sun was always shinin` - we just lived for fun. Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don`t know. The rest of my life`s been - just a show.. Those were the days of our lives. The bad things in life were so few. Those daays are all gone now but one thing is true-. When I look and I find, I still love you.. You can`t turn back the clock, you can`t turn. Back the tide. Ain`t that a shaame? (Ain`t that a shame?). I`d like to go back one time on a roller coaster. Ride. When life was just a game. No use sitting and thinkin` on what you did. When you can lay back and anjoy it through your. Kids. Sometimes it seems like lately I just don`t know. Better sit back and go - -with the flow. `Cause these are the days of our lives. They`ve flown in the swiftness of time. These days are all gone now but some things remain. When I look and I find - no change. Those were the days of our lives. The bad things in life were so few. Those days are all gone now but one thing is trrue-. When I look and I find, I still love you. I still llove you. I love you. I still love you. I still love you. I still love you."
they won't go when i go,No more lying friends. Wanting tragic ends. Though they do pretend. They won't go when I go. All those bleeding hearts. With sorrows to impart. Were right here from the start. And they won't go when I go. And I'll go where I've longed. To go so long. Away from tears. Gone from painful cries. Away from saddened eyes. Along with him I'll bide. Because they won't go when I go. Big men feeling small. Weak ones standing tall. I will watch them fall. They won't go when I go. And I'll go where I've longed. To go so long. Away from tears. Unclean minds mislead the pure. The innocent will leave for sure. For them there is a resting place. People sinning just for fun. They will never see the sun. For they can never show their faces. There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner. Who will take more than he will give. He ain't hardly gonna give. The greed of man will be. Far away from me. And my soul will be free. They won't go when I go. Since my soul conceived. All that I believe. The kingdom I will see. 'Cause they won't go when I go. When I go. Where I'll go. No one can keep me. From my destiny.

Now you fly like an eagle above,. While I waltz away anyway,. I'll be waltzing my days away,. Searching for this woman I love.. She had a history of joy and pain in time,. And she chose to leave,. She had a thousand and one photographs,. That you would not believe,. She'll come to you in disguise,. She's there in your children's eyes,. Still our mother.... She' still your wife,. (So let her...). Waltz away dreaming till your day begins again. Free from the reasons for this state I'm in,. And oh, (trust me, she ain't going anywhere). I can't hold it all under one love,. (Trust me, she told me, when you're ready she'll be there). It was so long ago, (no don't let go of her). When we kissed in the streets,. Now you fly like an eagle above,. While I waltz away anyway,. I'll be waltzing my days away,. Searching for this woman I love.. And the moment you see me. I will live in your life. We will walk through my garden. I will see through your eyes,. I was in despair 'till she found me there,. Every grown man cries with his mother's eyes,. And when you're ready too,. She'll come back to you,. She's waiting,. Father...."
where did your heart go?,"I spend my nights down on the wharf. In unlit alleyways. By the church downtown. Where Sally prays. Come down sometime. We'll share a rusty can of corn.... And listen to the radio. I love you, I love you, it says.... CHORUS:. Where did your heart go. Did you put it on a train. Did you leave it in the rain. Or down in Mexico. You cry, but I don't know. I've heard it all before. There it goes again, the slamming of the door. Sometimes the river calls me. And at night it calls my name. Says ""put your troubles down beside me"". Things have always been the same.... And rock 'n' roll won't teach me. What the river said that night. I jumped into this beauty. And drifted out of sight.... CHORUS."

you have been loved,"She takes the back road and the lane. Past the school that has no changed. In all this time. She thinks of when the boy was young. All the battles she had won. Just to give him life. That man. She loved that man. For all his life. But now we meet to bring him flowers. And only God knows why. For what's the use in pressing pamls. When children fade in mother's arms. It's a cruel world. We've so much to loose. And what we have to learn we rarely choose. So if it's God who took her son. He cannot be the one living in her mind. Take care my love, she said. Don't think that God is dead. Take care my love, she said. You have been loved. If I was weak, forgive me. But I was terrified. You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love. The kind that makes devils cry. So these days. My life has changed. And I'll be fine. But she just sits and counts the hours. Searching for her crime. So what's the use of pressing palms. If you won't keep such love from harm. It's a cruel world. You've so much to prove. And heaven helps the ones who wait for you.

you've changed,"you've changed. that sparkle in your eyes has gone. your smile is just a careless yawn. you're breaking my heart, you've changed. you've changed. your kisses are now so blase. you're bored with me in every way. I can't understand you've changed. you've forgotten the word I love you. each memory that we've shared. you ignore every star above you. I can't realise you ever cared. you've changed. you're not the anges I once knew. no need to tell me that we're through. it's all over now, you've changed. you've forgotten the word I love you. each memory that we've shared. you ignore every star above you. I can't realise you ever cared. you've changed. you're not the anges I once knew. no need to tell me that we're through. it's all over now, you've changed. I miss you. (Bill Carey/Carl Fischer)."
