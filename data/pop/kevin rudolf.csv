great escape,"One night when I was asleep,. I had a dream I could fly,. I felt the cold on my skin then I opened my eyes,. So I jumped out of bed went down the fire escape,.

I still remember that night I've never been the same,. Still wonder if I can fly, was it just a dream?. I wasn't happy for so long so many times I walked away,. Think I was searching for something. Not knowing what I had to face,. Until I found out the reason. That's when I made my great escape. But now it's to late to say, I'm sorry.. Turn around [x15]. One night when I couldn't sleep,. I heard a knock at the door,. She pulled her head on me slow then she opened my heart,. I asked myself is this real I've never felt this way,. She said I need to escape I said I know a place,. So she layed down on my bed I said confide in me,. She looked deep into my eyes and she invited me,. She must have left me asleep she never said goodbye. Her angels took her away I guess now she can fly.. I wasn't happy for so long so many times I walked away,. Think I was searching for something. Not knowing what I had to face,.

What, you don't believe in love.. Said I'll never be who I was when I was seventeen. Cause every time I walk away. I leave a piece of me.. [Chorus]. Now I understand. What they were trying to say. Life goes by too fast. And people change. But she just wants to be. Who she always was. But you can't change a single thing. You might as well look up and sing. I, I just take a little. I then I need some more. We get high to relieve the pain. But there is a voice inside me saying you'd better walk away. And I take just a little. I, oh to relieve the pain we get high.

New York, we ready!. [Kevin Rudolf:]. He move from LAS to SoHo. A few blocks for those who don't know. Down the hall. Punched a hole in the wall. Bounced out, all are in control. Certified son of a gun. Learns life lesson 101. Don't fly too high. On your own supply-get burnt by the sun. Cause in the city of dreams. You get caught up in the schemes and fall apart in the. Seam... tonight. That boy he is the bomb, from B.K. to the Bronx and it's the. Fortunate one who dies. He was NY's talk of the town. Heard out to the LI sound (okay).

Yo, ok, my city, my town, my crown. Michael Bloomberg, forget what ya heard. I'm thought of highly, shoppin Louie, Gianni. Christian LaCrosse shades, what can a boss say?. City, bus, the subway, cab, the runway. Ski masks and gunplay-my past at a young age. The illest city on the planet. Towers came down, Wall Street barely standin. We Crook Brothers, opposite of Brook Brothers. My footsteps of Scatman Crothers. It's just generations of style to get five luminous minutes with me. Interviews on how I flip sixty-twos. This isn't my style, I spit what I'm livin right now. I'm out on the town, gold bars shuttin it down. Bottles stacked from the floor to the ceiling. Then it's a loud fool, fifty-third street, right near the Hilton. I'm fightin the feeling I had when I was lightin up buildings. Now I'm writin for millions of listeners. Critics who just don't get it. They try dissin us, New York full of kings and queens, all the rest just mimic us. [Kevin Rudolf:]. Cause in the city of dreams. You get caught up in the schemes and fall apart in the. Seam... tonight. That boy would play his guitar like he was ready for war. And then he'd lift up his voice to the... sky"

great escape,"One night when I was asleep,. I had a dream I could fly,. I felt the cold on my skin then I opened my eyes,. So I jumped out of bed went down the fire escape,. Now I'm layed out on the street I wasn't running away,. From something I could control it was inside of me,. I didn't know where to go but I decided to leave,. I still remember that night I've never been the same,. Still wonder if I can fly, was it just a dream?. I wasn't happy for so long so many times I walked away,. Think I was searching for something. Not knowing what I had to face,. Until I found out the reason. That's when I made my great escape. But now it's to late to say, I'm sorry.. Turn around [x15]. One night when I couldn't sleep,. I heard a knock at the door,. She pulled her head on me slow then she opened my heart,. I asked myself is this real I've never felt this way,. She said I need to escape I said I know a place,. So she layed down on my bed I said confide in me,. She looked deep into my eyes and she invited me,. She must have left me asleep she never said goodbye. Her angels took her away I guess now she can fly.. I wasn't happy for so long so many times I walked away,. Think I was searching for something. Not knowing what I had to face,. Until I found out the reason. That's when I made my great escape. But now it's to late to say, I'm sorry.. Turn around [x15]. But I wasn't happy for so long so many times I walked away,. I think I was searching for something. Not knowing what I had to face,. Until I found out the reason. That's when I made my great escape. But now it's to late to say, I'm sorry.. And this is my song. These are my words. This is my story,. This is my song. These are my words.. And this is my song. And this is my story. These are my words.. And this is my song. These are my words. This is my story,. And this is my song. These are my words."

i song,"She walks in the room. In her mind she's far away. I can see her emptiness. But I just don't feel her pain. The love is gone. The only thing she was living for. Mister I'll never leave you. Walked right out the door, Oh.. It's killing me inside. The way I've seen her change. She writes her life story. But she can't turn the page. I hold her had, try to take her. But she pulls away. Shades go down, lights go out. There's nothing left to say. [Chorus:]. So I'm singing. I want it all but I take just a little. I feel her touch then I need some more. We get high just to try and relieve the pain. But a voice inside reminds me there must be a better way, Oh.. So I leave the room. 'Bout halfway down the hall. I turn around, she screams out. What, you don't believe in love.. Said I'll never be who I was when I was seventeen. Cause every time I walk away. I leave a piece of me.. [Chorus]. Now I understand. What they were trying to say. Life goes by too fast. And people change. But she just wants to be. Who she always was. But you can't change a single thing. You might as well look up and sing. I, I just take a little. I then I need some more. We get high to relieve the pain. But there is a voice inside me saying you'd better walk away. And I take just a little. I, oh to relieve the pain we get high. Some things never change. But a voice inside reminds me there must be,. Be better way."

City, bus, the subway, cab, the runway. Ski masks and gunplay-my past at a young age. The illest city on the planet. Towers came down, Wall Street barely standin. We Crook Brothers, opposite of Brook Brothers. My footsteps of Scatman Crothers. It's just generations of style to get five luminous minutes with me. Interviews on how I flip sixty-twos. This isn't my style, I spit what I'm livin right now. I'm out on the town, gold bars shuttin it down. Bottles stacked from the floor to the ceiling. Then it's a loud fool, fifty-third street, right near the Hilton. I'm fightin the feeling I had when I was lightin up buildings. Now I'm writin for millions of listeners. Critics who just don't get it. They try dissin us, New York full of kings and queens, all the rest just mimic us. [Kevin Rudolf:]. Cause in the city of dreams. You get caught up in the schemes and fall apart in the. Seam... tonight. That boy would play his guitar like he was ready for war. And then he'd lift up his voice to the... sky"
