Don't you feel your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand. And as he spoke, he spoke, ordinary words. Though they did not feel. For I felt what I had not felt before. And you'd swear those words could heal and. As I looked up into those eyes, his vision borrows mine. And I know he's no stranger. For I feel I've held him for all of time and he said. Take my hand, live while you can. Don't you feel your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand. Please come with me, see what I see. Touch the stars for time will not flee. Time will not flee, can't you see. Just a dream, just an, ordinary dream. As I wake in bed. And that boy, that ordinary boy. Was it all in my head?. Didn't he ask if I would come along.

My heart always seems to know. Now take your glitz back, I want the soul instead. 'Cause I found some kind of fairytale. I used to. Hover outside my truth. Always worry of what I'd lose.

twilight,"[Verse 1]. I was stained, with a role, in a day not my own. But as you walked into my life you showed what needed to be shown. And I always knew, what was right I just didn´t know that I might. Peel away and choose to see with such a different sight. [Chorus]. And I will never see the sky the same way and. I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and. I will never cease to fly if held down and. I will always reach too high cause I´ve seen, cause I´ve seen, twilight. [Verse 2]. Never cared never wanted. Never sought to see what flaunted. So on purpose so in my face Couldn´t see beyond my own place. And it was so easy not to behold what I could hold. But you taught me I could change Whatever came within these shallow days. [Chorus]. And I will never see the sky the same way and. I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and. I will never cease to fly if held down and. I will always reach too high cause I´ve seen, cause I´ve seen. [Bridge]. As the sun shines through it pushes away and pushes ahead. It fills the warmth of blue and leaves a chill instead and. I didn´t know that I could be so blind to all that is so real. But as illusion dies I see there is so much to be revealed. [Chorus]. And I will never see the sky the same way and. I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and. I will never cease to fly if held down and. I will always reach too high cause I´ve seen, cause I´ve seen, twilight. [Verse 3]. I was stained, by a role, in a day not my own. But as you walked into my life you showed what needed to be shown.

white houses,"Crashed on the floor when I moved in. This little bungalow. With some strange new friends. Stay up too late, and I'm too thin. We promised each other it's til the end. Now we're spinning empty bottles. It's the five of us. With pretty eyed boys. Girls die to trust. I can't resist the day. No, I can't resist the day. Jenny screams out and it's no pose. 'Cause when she dances she goes and goes. Beer through the nose on an inside joke. I'm so excited, I haven't spoke. And she's so pretty, and she's so sure. Maybe I'm more clever than a girl like her. The summer's all in bloom. The summer is ending soon. It's alright. And it's nice not to be so alone. But I hold on to secrets. In white houses. Maybe I'm a little bit over my head. I come undone at the things he said. And he's so funny in his bright red shirt. We were all in love. And we all got hurt. I sneak into his car's black leather seat. The smell of gasoline in the summer heat. Boy, we're going way too fast. It's all too sweet to last. It's alright. And I put myself in his hands. But I hold on to secrets in white houses. Love, or something ignites in my veins. And I pray it never fades. In white houses. My first time, hard to explain. Rush of blood, oh,. and a little bit of pain. On a cloudy day. It's more common than you think. He's my first mistake. Maybe you were all faster than me. We give each other up so easily. Sealing little wounds we'll never mend. I feel so far from where I've been. So I go, and I will not be back here again. I'm gone as the day is fading. On white houses. I lie, put my injuries all in the dust. In my heart is the five of us. In white houses. And you, maybe you'll remember me. What I gave is yours to keep. In white houses. In white houses. In white houses"
all i ask,Fumbling down a road lined with signs. It's obvious I'm in the wrong direction. And I won't stop now you know I feel fine. Just looking for some affection. All I ask is to be able to hold on longer. And all I ask is to be able to walk on water. Walk on water. I figure it won't be long it won't be hard. I've just got to get my feet back on the ground. Just got a hold of some unlucky cards. And I have yet to make another round. All I ask is to be able to hold on longer. And all I ask is to be able to walk on water. Walk on water. No one lent a hand. No one laid a look upon me. Invisible to everything but blame. No one dared to believe in anything. And left me to drown in this place. All I ask is to be able to hold on longer. And all I ask is to be able to walk on water. Walk on water.

the one (feat. stevie nicks),"Holiday, and I come home.. I hope to see this boy I know,. I can't wait for us to be alone.. Flippin' through the radio,. We sing along to the indie show.. The songs they play mean more than I can say.. And the tape I made you,. Hope you think of me when it plays through,. Feel kind of sad now that it's done.. And you think my time's for free,. In all the ways you say to me. Sweet versions of ""Let's wait and see..."". But you're always a golden boy. And I'm the girl that you enjoy.. My parents say: ""Isn't he a gifted son?"". And time is always passing by,. Still I have to wonder why. You can't come and tell me I'm the one.. Summer goes and we have grown.. We have our friends, live on our own.. Still, I'm not the girl you want me to be.. Say gravity can bend the time.. Funny, I always liked your mind. But this whole thing is crushing me.. But you're always a golden boy. In this girl's heart that you destroyed.. You smile at me and then you have your fun.. And time is always passing by,. Still I give you another try,. And hope that you will see that I'm the one.. You say you're scared to get too close.. Come, let's see how it goes.. I see him now, at the show, 7th in the 7th row.. And now you look at me. And see what I've known for so long.. It's sad that you could be so lovely, and so wrong.. Came to say, that I've moved.. I see your face, you don't approve.. Guess you could say that I'm already gone.. But you'll always be my golden boy. I'm the summer girl that you enjoyed.. Some melodies are best left undone.. I feel the time pass away,. But in my songs you'll aways stay.. I don't need you to tell me I'm the one.. I don't need you to tell me I'm the one.. You'll never know that I was the one..."
rinse,"She´d do anything to sparkle in his eye. She would suffer, she would fight, and compromise. She´s been wishin´ on the stars that shine so bright.

How she´d be soothed, how she´d be saved if he. could see. She needs to be held in his arms to be free. But everything happens for reasons that she will never. understand. ´til she knows the heart of a woman will never be. found in the arms of a man. [chorus]. And if she runs away she fears she won´t be followed. What could be the worse than leaving something behind. And as the depth of oceans slowly become shallow. It´s loneliness she finds.... If only he was mine. She´d do anything to spakle in his eye. She would suffer, she would fight, and compromise. She´s been wishin´ on the stars that shine so bright.

hear the bells,"Stealing glances through the key hole. In a brick wall's wooden door. Changes are keeping quite secrets. Two hundred year old folklore. And the graveyard on Elizabeth. No one ever goes. Kneeling praying to a gravestone. But the gravestone never tells. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. December crossing on to Chinatown. As the wind starts to cut through. Always, always on the lookout. But the poisons running through you. Stomachaches, try to concentrate. Want the stairs on the third floor. Now I'm asking a witch doctor. But the witch doctor won't tell. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. Floating on the sea stars are watching me. Current takes me out what will be will be. Floating on the sea stars are watching me. Current takes me out what will be will be. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. Hear the bells"
this time,"It's 4 AM, and I'm wide awake. Waiting for my thoughts to fade. And a flickering of all of my mistakes. And as the light starts creeping in. I slowly feel the day I'm missing. But I wouldn't even know where to begin. I knew I'd push too hard, I fall too fast. The moment never seems to last. And will I stop for long enough to know. That everybody burns. And when it starts to hurt. I cry. I feel it in my veins. I just can't walk away. This time…. Your words circle in my head. And weigh so heavy on my chest. And I'm crushed by your expectation. I only wanna do some good. Too dumb to know if I could. And I just wanna feel the day's I'm in. I knew I'd push too hard, not hard enough. Why can't I keep my big mouth shut?. And do we lead the life that we should?. Cause everybody burns. And when it starts to hurt. I cry. I feel it in my veins. I just can't walk away. This time…. And did I say too much again. I'm just a girl in a panic. And if I tell you my truth, what am I getting through?. And it just seems I should confess. And who am I to pretend?. And this is more than I can carry. Cause everybody burns. And when it starts to hurt. I cry. I feel it in my veins. I just can't walk away. This time…. I hold my head up high. I know I'll be alright. This time…. Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. Its 4 AM and I'm wide awake. Waiting for my thoughts to fade. And its times like these I see your face"

paradise,once upon a year gone by. she saw herself give in. every time she closed her eyes. she saw what could have been. well nothing hurts and nothing bleeds. when covers tucked in tight. funny when the bottom drops. how she forgets to fight... to fight. and it´s one more day in paradise. one more day in paradise. as darkness quickly steals the light. that shined within her eyes. she slowly swallows all her fear. and soothes her mind with lies. well all she wants and all she needs. are reasons to survive. a day in which the sun will take. her artificial light... her light. and it´s one more day in paradise. one more day in paradise. it´s one more day in paradise. one last chance to feel alright... alright. don´t pretend to hold it in just let it out. don´t pretend to hold it in just push it out. don´t you try to hold it in just let it out and. don´t you try to hold it in you hold it in.

All I ask is to be able to hold on longer. And all I ask is to be able to walk on water. Walk on water. I figure it won't be long it won't be hard. I've just got to get my feet back on the ground. Just got a hold of some unlucky cards. And I have yet to make another round. All I ask is to be able to hold on longer. And all I ask is to be able to walk on water. Walk on water. No one lent a hand. No one laid a look upon me. Invisible to everything but blame. No one dared to believe in anything. And left me to drown in this place. All I ask is to be able to hold on longer. And all I ask is to be able to walk on water. Walk on water.
all is well,"Vanessa Carlton- All Is Well. I always sleep so much better when it’s raining. There’s something 'bout the rhythm as the water hits the pane. I could stay in bed all God damn day, and sweetly waste away. 'Cause I’m blind to all the good you see, and prefer a fine tragedy. When all is well I get nervous, something’s missing. If only you could tell me it’s okay, and me listen, 'cause it already is. Oh. The air grows thin as summer fades. I miss, I change. The old crisp and color autumn days appear in my view. 'cause this blue, you caught the splendor that’s been staring me in my face. and the spectrum of the colors just change into blue. When all is well I get nervous, something’s missing. If only you could tell me it’s okay, and me listen, 'cause it already is. and it’s all true, and good and merry. 'cause you see through the tears. and they come every night. without reason meaning why. ah oh oh. When all is well I get nervous, something’s missing. If only you could tell me it’s okay, and me listen, cause it already,. All is well, and I know it, when I see you. you don’t need to tell me it’s okay. cause I believe that it already is. already is. already is. I always sleep so much better when it’s raining"

tall tales for spring,"God rest his head Sunday afternoon, and. The wicked in me is surly the wicked in you. We pray to a ghost that we never met. Time turns for a cure, for the scientists for. Madness, madness of the heart. but you knew it, you knew it from the start. And Hawking will tell us no tall tales this spring. My eyes saw the chaos that stared everything. Maybe it's faith, and the sadness takes hold. Sill stars through the window, will ever know this. Madness, madness of the heart. but you knew it, you knew it from the start. There's a madness, a madness of the heart. but you knew it, you knew it from the start. Stare a sleepy smile into a sun beam. There's nothing more than a daydream. Colored stained glass cathedral. Confines a past that wont let you go. God rest his head Sunday afternoon. And the wicked in me is surly coming through. Pray to a ghost that I've never met. (don't pill?) someway out of this mess. It's the heart. It's the heart. And there is a madness, a madness in the stars. But you knew it, you knew it from the start. Hmmmmmmmmm. Hmmmmmmmmm. Hmmmmmmmmm"
the one (feat. stevie nicks),"Holiday, and I come home.. I hope to see this boy I know,. I can't wait for us to be alone.. Flippin' through the radio,. We sing along to the indie show.. The songs they play mean more than I can say.. And the tape I made you,. Hope you think of me when it plays through,. Feel kind of sad now that it's done.. And you think my time's for free,. In all the ways you say to me. Sweet versions of ""Let's wait and see..."". But you're always a golden boy. And I'm the girl that you enjoy.. My parents say: ""Isn't he a gifted son?"". And time is always passing by,. Still I have to wonder why. You can't come and tell me I'm the one.. Summer goes and we have grown.. We have our friends, live on our own.. Still, I'm not the girl you want me to be.. Say gravity can bend the time.. Funny, I always liked your mind. But this whole thing is crushing me.. But you're always a golden boy. In this girl's heart that you destroyed.. You smile at me and then you have your fun.. And time is always passing by,. Still I give you another try,. And hope that you will see that I'm the one.. You say you're scared to get too close.. Come, let's see how it goes.. I see him now, at the show, 7th in the 7th row.. And now you look at me. And see what I've known for so long.. It's sad that you could be so lovely, and so wrong.. Came to say, that I've moved.. I see your face, you don't approve.. Guess you could say that I'm already gone.. But you'll always be my golden boy. I'm the summer girl that you enjoyed.. Some melodies are best left undone.. I feel the time pass away,. But in my songs you'll aways stay.. I don't need you to tell me I'm the one.. I don't need you to tell me I'm the one.. You'll never know that I was the one..."
the wreckage,"Speeding into the horizon. Dreaming of the sirens. Wishing for broken glass on a highway. It could be so easy. The rhythm, rhythm of an engine. Always makes me empty. See the headlights coming at me. Can't help but wonder. Flying, flying in slow motion. The wind through my hair. And ripping through the scenery. Of the wreckage. It is my secret need. Uh, uh, uh. Speeding into the horizon. Dreaming of the sirens. Wishing for broken glass on a highway. It could be so easy"
this time,"It's 4 AM, and I'm wide awake. Waiting for my thoughts to fade. And a flickering of all of my mistakes. And as the light starts creeping in. I slowly feel the day I'm missing. But I wouldn't even know where to begin. I knew I'd push too hard, I fall too fast. The moment never seems to last. And will I stop for long enough to know. That everybody burns. And when it starts to hurt. I cry. I feel it in my veins. I just can't walk away. This time…. Your words circle in my head. And weigh so heavy on my chest. And I'm crushed by your expectation. I only wanna do some good. Too dumb to know if I could. And I just wanna feel the day's I'm in. I knew I'd push too hard, not hard enough. Why can't I keep my big mouth shut?. And do we lead the life that we should?. Cause everybody burns. And when it starts to hurt. I cry. I feel it in my veins. I just can't walk away. This time…. And did I say too much again. I'm just a girl in a panic. And if I tell you my truth, what am I getting through?. And it just seems I should confess. And who am I to pretend?. And this is more than I can carry. Cause everybody burns. And when it starts to hurt. I cry. I feel it in my veins. I just can't walk away. This time…. I hold my head up high. I know I'll be alright. This time…. Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. Its 4 AM and I'm wide awake. Waiting for my thoughts to fade. And its times like these I see your face"

twilight,"[Verse 1]. I was stained, with a role, in a day not my own. But as you walked into my life you showed what needed to be shown. And I always knew, what was right I just didn´t know that I might. Peel away and choose to see with such a different sight. [Chorus]. And I will never see the sky the same way and. I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and. I will never cease to fly if held down and. I will always reach too high cause I´ve seen, cause I´ve seen, twilight. [Verse 2]. Never cared never wanted. Never sought to see what flaunted. So on purpose so in my face Couldn´t see beyond my own place. And it was so easy not to behold what I could hold. But you taught me I could change Whatever came within these shallow days. [Chorus]. And I will never see the sky the same way and. I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and. I will never cease to fly if held down and. I will always reach too high cause I´ve seen, cause I´ve seen. [Bridge]. As the sun shines through it pushes away and pushes ahead. It fills the warmth of blue and leaves a chill instead and. I didn´t know that I could be so blind to all that is so real. But as illusion dies I see there is so much to be revealed. [Chorus]. And I will never see the sky the same way and. I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and. I will never cease to fly if held down and. I will always reach too high cause I´ve seen, cause I´ve seen, twilight. [Verse 3]. I was stained, by a role, in a day not my own. But as you walked into my life you showed what needed to be shown. And I always knew, what was right. I just didn´t know that I might. Peel away and choose to see with such a different sight. [Chorus]. And I will never see the sky the same way and. I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and. I will never cease to fly if held down and. I will always reach too high cause I´ve seen, cause I´ve seen, twilight...."

white houses,"Crashed on the floor when I moved in. This little bungalow. With some strange new friends. Stay up too late, and I'm too thin. We promised each other it's til the end. Now we're spinning empty bottles. It's the five of us. With pretty eyed boys. Girls die to trust. I can't resist the day. No, I can't resist the day. Jenny screams out and it's no pose. 'Cause when she dances she goes and goes. Beer through the nose on an inside joke. I'm so excited, I haven't spoke. And she's so pretty, and she's so sure. Maybe I'm more clever than a girl like her. The summer's all in bloom. The summer is ending soon. It's alright. And it's nice not to be so alone. But I hold on to secrets. In white houses. Maybe I'm a little bit over my head. I come undone at the things he said. And he's so funny in his bright red shirt. We were all in love. And we all got hurt. I sneak into his car's black leather seat. The smell of gasoline in the summer heat. Boy, we're going way too fast. It's all too sweet to last. It's alright. And I put myself in his hands. But I hold on to secrets in white houses. Love, or something ignites in my veins. And I pray it never fades. In white houses. My first time, hard to explain. Rush of blood, oh,. and a little bit of pain. On a cloudy day. It's more common than you think. He's my first mistake. Maybe you were all faster than me. We give each other up so easily. Sealing little wounds we'll never mend. I feel so far from where I've been. So I go, and I will not be back here again. I'm gone as the day is fading. On white houses. I lie, put my injuries all in the dust. In my heart is the five of us. In white houses. And you, maybe you'll remember me. What I gave is yours to keep. In white houses. In white houses. In white houses"
who's to say,"Stand up straight. Do your trick. Turn on the stars. Jupiter shines so bright. When you're around to tell us slow down,. We're too young you need to grow. The speed's the key. And they don't know who we are. And who's to say that we're not good enough?. And who's to say that this is not our love?. Mother don't tell me friends are the ones that I lose. 'Cause they'd bleed before you. And sometimes family are the ones you'd choose. It's too late now. I hold on to this life I found. And who's to say we won't burn it out?. And who's to say we wont sink in doubt?. Who's to say that we wont fade today?. Who are they anyway? Anyway they don't know. And you say we're too young, but maybe you're too old to remember. And I try to pretend but I just feel it when we're together. And if you don't believe me, you never really knew us. You never really knew. You and I, packin' up my room, we feel alright. But we're not well consumed. We'll be drivin', 'cause they don't know who we are. Who's to say we won't stay together?. Who's to say we aren't getting stronger?. Who's to say I can't live without you?. Who are they anyway? Anyway they don't know. And you say we're too young, but maybe you're too old to remember. And I try to pretend, but I just feel it when we're together. Who is to say?. And who is to say?. And who are they anyway?. Stand up boy, I shine so bright when you're around"

Don't you feel your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand. And as he spoke, he spoke, ordinary words. Though they did not feel. For I felt what I had not felt before. And you'd swear those words could heal and. As I looked up into those eyes, his vision borrows mine. And I know he's no stranger. For I feel I've held him for all of time and he said. Take my hand, live while you can. Don't you feel your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand. Please come with me, see what I see. Touch the stars for time will not flee. Time will not flee, can't you see. Just a dream, just an, ordinary dream. As I wake in bed. And that boy, that ordinary boy. Was it all in my head?. Didn't he ask if I would come along.

nolita fairytale,"I know, you know. We don't see. We sow our truth, wait patiently. I walk the streets with a song in my head. We ebb and we flow so. Got my toes on my pup at the foot of my bed. My heart always seems to know. Now take your glitz back, I want the soul instead. 'Cause I found some kind of fairytale. I used to. Hover outside my truth. Always worry of what I'd lose. I take away my record deal. Go on, I don't need it. Spent the last two years getting to what's real. And now I can see so clear. I hope you feel just like I feel. I found some kind of fairytale. Want a garden by the ocean tide. Because I lose my way searching for stage lights. Well, Stevie knows and I thank her so. 'Cause it's your seeds I sow. And now I know. Nolita flat on rent control. That's the life I choose. And you drag me to your fashion shows. The poses that I see through. The Ruby's in the afternoon. 'Cause I found some kind of fairy...tale Hey!.

twilight,"[Verse 1]. I was stained, with a role, in a day not my own. But as you walked into my life you showed what needed to be shown. And I always knew, what was right I just didn´t know that I might. Peel away and choose to see with such a different sight. [Chorus]. And I will never see the sky the same way and. I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and. I will never cease to fly if held down and. I will always reach too high cause I´ve seen, cause I´ve seen, twilight. [Verse 2]. Never cared never wanted. Never sought to see what flaunted. So on purpose so in my face Couldn´t see beyond my own place. And it was so easy not to behold what I could hold. But you taught me I could change Whatever came within these shallow days. [Chorus]. And I will never see the sky the same way and. I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and. I will never cease to fly if held down and. I will always reach too high cause I´ve seen, cause I´ve seen. [Bridge]. As the sun shines through it pushes away and pushes ahead. It fills the warmth of blue and leaves a chill instead and. I didn´t know that I could be so blind to all that is so real. But as illusion dies I see there is so much to be revealed. [Chorus]. And I will never see the sky the same way and. I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and. I will never cease to fly if held down and. I will always reach too high cause I´ve seen, cause I´ve seen, twilight. [Verse 3]. I was stained, by a role, in a day not my own. But as you walked into my life you showed what needed to be shown.

white houses,"Crashed on the floor when I moved in. This little bungalow. With some strange new friends. Stay up too late, and I'm too thin. We promised each other it's til the end. Now we're spinning empty bottles. It's the five of us. With pretty eyed boys. Girls die to trust. I can't resist the day. No, I can't resist the day. Jenny screams out and it's no pose. 'Cause when she dances she goes and goes. Beer through the nose on an inside joke. I'm so excited, I haven't spoke. And she's so pretty, and she's so sure. Maybe I'm more clever than a girl like her. The summer's all in bloom. The summer is ending soon. It's alright. And it's nice not to be so alone. But I hold on to secrets. In white houses. Maybe I'm a little bit over my head. I come undone at the things he said. And he's so funny in his bright red shirt. We were all in love. And we all got hurt. I sneak into his car's black leather seat. The smell of gasoline in the summer heat. Boy, we're going way too fast. It's all too sweet to last. It's alright. And I put myself in his hands. But I hold on to secrets in white houses. Love, or something ignites in my veins. And I pray it never fades. In white houses. My first time, hard to explain. Rush of blood, oh,. and a little bit of pain. On a cloudy day. It's more common than you think. He's my first mistake. Maybe you were all faster than me. We give each other up so easily. Sealing little wounds we'll never mend. I feel so far from where I've been. So I go, and I will not be back here again. I'm gone as the day is fading. On white houses. I lie, put my injuries all in the dust. In my heart is the five of us. In white houses. And you, maybe you'll remember me. What I gave is yours to keep. In white houses. In white houses. In white houses"
all i ask,Fumbling down a road lined with signs. It's obvious I'm in the wrong direction. And I won't stop now you know I feel fine. Just looking for some affection. All I ask is to be able to hold on longer. And all I ask is to be able to walk on water. Walk on water. I figure it won't be long it won't be hard. I've just got to get my feet back on the ground. Just got a hold of some unlucky cards. And I have yet to make another round. All I ask is to be able to hold on longer. And all I ask is to be able to walk on water. Walk on water. No one lent a hand. No one laid a look upon me. Invisible to everything but blame. No one dared to believe in anything. And left me to drown in this place. All I ask is to be able to hold on longer. And all I ask is to be able to walk on water. Walk on water.

the one (feat. stevie nicks),"Holiday, and I come home.. I hope to see this boy I know,. I can't wait for us to be alone.. Flippin' through the radio,. We sing along to the indie show.. The songs they play mean more than I can say.. And the tape I made you,. Hope you think of me when it plays through,. Feel kind of sad now that it's done.. And you think my time's for free,. In all the ways you say to me. Sweet versions of ""Let's wait and see..."". But you're always a golden boy. And I'm the girl that you enjoy.. My parents say: ""Isn't he a gifted son?"". And time is always passing by,. Still I have to wonder why. You can't come and tell me I'm the one.. Summer goes and we have grown.. We have our friends, live on our own.. Still, I'm not the girl you want me to be.. Say gravity can bend the time.. Funny, I always liked your mind. But this whole thing is crushing me.. But you're always a golden boy. In this girl's heart that you destroyed.. You smile at me and then you have your fun.. And time is always passing by,. Still I give you another try,. And hope that you will see that I'm the one.. You say you're scared to get too close.. Come, let's see how it goes.. I see him now, at the show, 7th in the 7th row.. And now you look at me. And see what I've known for so long.. It's sad that you could be so lovely, and so wrong.. Came to say, that I've moved.. I see your face, you don't approve.. Guess you could say that I'm already gone.. But you'll always be my golden boy. I'm the summer girl that you enjoyed.. Some melodies are best left undone.. I feel the time pass away,. But in my songs you'll aways stay.. I don't need you to tell me I'm the one.. I don't need you to tell me I'm the one.. You'll never know that I was the one..."
rinse,"She´d do anything to sparkle in his eye. She would suffer, she would fight, and compromise. She´s been wishin´ on the stars that shine so bright. For answers to the questions that will haunt her tonight. She must rinse this all away. She can´t hold him this way. She must rinse this all away. She can´t love him this way. How she´d be soothed, how she´d be saved if he. could see. She needs to be held in his arms to be free. But everything happens for reasons that she will never. understand. ´til she knows the heart of a woman will never be. found in the arms of a man. [chorus]. And if she runs away she fears she won´t be followed. What could be the worse than leaving something behind. And as the depth of oceans slowly become shallow. It´s loneliness she finds.... If only he was mine. She´d do anything to spakle in his eye. She would suffer, she would fight, and compromise. She´s been wishin´ on the stars that shine so bright.

hear the bells,"Stealing glances through the key hole. In a brick wall's wooden door. Changes are keeping quite secrets. Two hundred year old folklore. And the graveyard on Elizabeth. No one ever goes. Kneeling praying to a gravestone. But the gravestone never tells. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. December crossing on to Chinatown. As the wind starts to cut through. Always, always on the lookout. But the poisons running through you. Stomachaches, try to concentrate. Want the stairs on the third floor. Now I'm asking a witch doctor. But the witch doctor won't tell. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. Floating on the sea stars are watching me. Current takes me out what will be will be. Floating on the sea stars are watching me. Current takes me out what will be will be. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. Hear the bells. Hear the bells"
this time,"It's 4 AM, and I'm wide awake. Waiting for my thoughts to fade. And a flickering of all of my mistakes. And as the light starts creeping in. I slowly feel the day I'm missing. But I wouldn't even know where to begin. I knew I'd push too hard, I fall too fast. The moment never seems to last. And will I stop for long enough to know. That everybody burns. And when it starts to hurt. I cry. I feel it in my veins. I just can't walk away. This time…. Your words circle in my head. And weigh so heavy on my chest. And I'm crushed by your expectation. I only wanna do some good. Too dumb to know if I could. And I just wanna feel the day's I'm in. I knew I'd push too hard, not hard enough. Why can't I keep my big mouth shut?. And do we lead the life that we should?. Cause everybody burns. And when it starts to hurt. I cry. I feel it in my veins. I just can't walk away. This time…. And did I say too much again. I'm just a girl in a panic. And if I tell you my truth, what am I getting through?. And it just seems I should confess. And who am I to pretend?. And this is more than I can carry. Cause everybody burns. And when it starts to hurt. I cry. I feel it in my veins. I just can't walk away. This time…. I hold my head up high. I know I'll be alright. This time…. Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. Its 4 AM and I'm wide awake. Waiting for my thoughts to fade. And its times like these I see your face"
san francisco,"I, I know what you did. Like a boy of summer gives his first kiss. Love, is dancing on my finger. He got to the heart of the matter and lingered. Now I'm walking with the living.

paradise,once upon a year gone by. she saw herself give in. every time she closed her eyes. she saw what could have been. well nothing hurts and nothing bleeds. when covers tucked in tight. funny when the bottom drops. how she forgets to fight... to fight. and it´s one more day in paradise. one more day in paradise. as darkness quickly steals the light. that shined within her eyes. she slowly swallows all her fear. and soothes her mind with lies. well all she wants and all she needs. are reasons to survive. a day in which the sun will take. her artificial light... her light. and it´s one more day in paradise. one more day in paradise. it´s one more day in paradise. one last chance to feel alright... alright. don´t pretend to hold it in just let it out. don´t pretend to hold it in just push it out. don´t you try to hold it in just let it out and. don´t you try to hold it in you hold it in.

There's a madness, a madness of the heart. but you knew it, you knew it from the start. Stare a sleepy smile into a sun beam. There's nothing more than a daydream. Colored stained glass cathedral. Confines a past that wont let you go. God rest his head Sunday afternoon. And the wicked in me is surly coming through. Pray to a ghost that I've never met. (don't pill?) someway out of this mess. It's the heart. It's the heart. And there is a madness, a madness in the stars. But you knew it, you knew it from the start. Hmmmmmmmmm. Hmmmmmmmmm. Hmmmmmmmmm"
the one (feat. stevie nicks),"Holiday, and I come home.. I hope to see this boy I know,. I can't wait for us to be alone.. Flippin' through the radio,. We sing along to the indie show.. The songs they play mean more than I can say.. And the tape I made you,. Hope you think of me when it plays through,. Feel kind of sad now that it's done.. And you think my time's for free,.

But you'll always be my golden boy. I'm the summer girl that you enjoyed.. Some melodies are best left undone.. I feel the time pass away,. But in my songs you'll aways stay..

the wreckage,"Speeding into the horizon. Dreaming of the sirens. Wishing for broken glass on a highway. It could be so easy. The rhythm, rhythm of an engine. Always makes me empty. See the headlights coming at me. Can't help but wonder. Flying, flying in slow motion. The wind through my hair. And ripping through the scenery. Of the wreckage. It is my secret need. Uh, uh, uh.

this time,"It's 4 AM, and I'm wide awake. Waiting for my thoughts to fade. And a flickering of all of my mistakes. And as the light starts creeping in. I slowly feel the day I'm missing.

And when it starts to hurt. I cry. I feel it in my veins. I just can't walk away. This time…. Your words circle in my head. And weigh so heavy on my chest. And I'm crushed by your expectation. I only wanna do some good. Too dumb to know if I could. And I just wanna feel the day's I'm in. I knew I'd push too hard, not hard enough. Why can't I keep my big mouth shut?. And do we lead the life that we should?. Cause everybody burns. And when it starts to hurt. I cry. I feel it in my veins. I just can't walk away. This time…. And did I say too much again. I'm just a girl in a panic. And if I tell you my truth, what am I getting through?. And it just seems I should confess. And who am I to pretend?. And this is more than I can carry. Cause everybody burns. And when it starts to hurt. I cry. I feel it in my veins. I just can't walk away. This time…. I hold my head up high. I know I'll be alright. This time…. Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. Its 4 AM and I'm wide awake. Waiting for my thoughts to fade. And its times like these I see your face"

twilight,"[Verse 1]. I was stained, with a role, in a day not my own. But as you walked into my life you showed what needed to be shown. And I always knew, what was right I just didn´t know that I might. Peel away and choose to see with such a different sight. [Chorus]. And I will never see the sky the same way and. I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and. I will never cease to fly if held down and. I will always reach too high cause I´ve seen, cause I´ve seen, twilight. [Verse 2]. Never cared never wanted. Never sought to see what flaunted. So on purpose so in my face Couldn´t see beyond my own place. And it was so easy not to behold what I could hold. But you taught me I could change Whatever came within these shallow days. [Chorus]. And I will never see the sky the same way and. I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and. I will never cease to fly if held down and. I will always reach too high cause I´ve seen, cause I´ve seen. [Bridge]. As the sun shines through it pushes away and pushes ahead. It fills the warmth of blue and leaves a chill instead and. I didn´t know that I could be so blind to all that is so real. But as illusion dies I see there is so much to be revealed. [Chorus]. And I will never see the sky the same way and. I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and. I will never cease to fly if held down and. I will always reach too high cause I´ve seen, cause I´ve seen, twilight. [Verse 3]. I was stained, by a role, in a day not my own. But as you walked into my life you showed what needed to be shown. And I always knew, what was right. I just didn´t know that I might. Peel away and choose to see with such a different sight. [Chorus]. And I will never see the sky the same way and. I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and. I will never cease to fly if held down and. I will always reach too high cause I´ve seen, cause I´ve seen, twilight...."

white houses,"Crashed on the floor when I moved in. This little bungalow. With some strange new friends. Stay up too late, and I'm too thin. We promised each other it's til the end. Now we're spinning empty bottles. It's the five of us. With pretty eyed boys. Girls die to trust. I can't resist the day. No, I can't resist the day. Jenny screams out and it's no pose. 'Cause when she dances she goes and goes. Beer through the nose on an inside joke. I'm so excited, I haven't spoke. And she's so pretty, and she's so sure. Maybe I'm more clever than a girl like her. The summer's all in bloom. The summer is ending soon. It's alright. And it's nice not to be so alone. But I hold on to secrets. In white houses. Maybe I'm a little bit over my head. I come undone at the things he said. And he's so funny in his bright red shirt. We were all in love. And we all got hurt. I sneak into his car's black leather seat. The smell of gasoline in the summer heat. Boy, we're going way too fast. It's all too sweet to last. It's alright. And I put myself in his hands. But I hold on to secrets in white houses. Love, or something ignites in my veins. And I pray it never fades. In white houses. My first time, hard to explain. Rush of blood, oh,. and a little bit of pain. On a cloudy day. It's more common than you think. He's my first mistake. Maybe you were all faster than me. We give each other up so easily. Sealing little wounds we'll never mend. I feel so far from where I've been. So I go, and I will not be back here again. I'm gone as the day is fading. On white houses. I lie, put my injuries all in the dust. In my heart is the five of us. In white houses. And you, maybe you'll remember me. What I gave is yours to keep. In white houses. In white houses. In white houses"
who's to say,"Stand up straight. Do your trick. Turn on the stars. Jupiter shines so bright. When you're around to tell us slow down,. We're too young you need to grow. The speed's the key. And they don't know who we are. And who's to say that we're not good enough?. And who's to say that this is not our love?. Mother don't tell me friends are the ones that I lose. 'Cause they'd bleed before you. And sometimes family are the ones you'd choose. It's too late now. I hold on to this life I found. And who's to say we won't burn it out?. And who's to say we wont sink in doubt?. Who's to say that we wont fade today?. Who are they anyway? Anyway they don't know. And you say we're too young, but maybe you're too old to remember. And I try to pretend but I just feel it when we're together. And if you don't believe me, you never really knew us. You never really knew. You and I, packin' up my room, we feel alright. But we're not well consumed. We'll be drivin', 'cause they don't know who we are. Who's to say we won't stay together?. Who's to say we aren't getting stronger?. Who's to say I can't live without you?. Who are they anyway? Anyway they don't know. And you say we're too young, but maybe you're too old to remember. And I try to pretend, but I just feel it when we're together. Who is to say?. And who is to say?. And who are they anyway?. Stand up boy, I shine so bright when you're around"

young heart,"I know that the seasons, they change for a reason. But I can't tell spring, summer, autumn or winter apart. 'Cause my eyes see one color, my mouth taste one taste. All of the beauty and the ones you take. And I always loved you, but haven't always loved you right. I had no direction, I had no clear sight. But now that I'm older and I've moved through the times. I wanna love you, and I wanna love you right. Wanna love you right!. But I had a young heart, a sharp narrow view. I was a coward, couldn't hand it to you. Oh, and I always loved you, haven't always loved you right. I had good intentions, I had no clear sight. Oh, but now that I'm older. and I've moved through the times. I wanna love you, and I wanna love you right. When you go, when you go. I will follow. When you go, when you go. When you go I will follow!. Uh, but now that I'm older and I've moved through the times. I wanna love you, and I wanna love you right. Wanna love you right!. Wanna love you right!"
