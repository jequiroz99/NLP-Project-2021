careless whisper,"I feel so unsure. As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor. As the music dies, something in your eyes. Calls to mind a silver screen. And all those sad goodbyes. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. And waste the chance that I've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. Time can never mend. The careless whispers of a good friend. To the heart and mind. Ignorance is kind. There's no comfort in the truth. Pain is all you'll find. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. And waste this chance that I've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. Never without your love. Tonight the music seems so loud. I wish that we could lose this crowd. Maybe it's better this way. We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say. We could have been so good together. We could have lived this dance forever. But now who's gonna dance with me?. Please stay. And I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. And waste the chance that I've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. (Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone. (Now that you're gone) What I did's so wrong, so wrong. That you had to leave me alone?"

cruisin' (part. saulo),"Baby, let's cruise, away from here. Don't be confused, the way is clear. And if you want it you got it forever. This is not a one night stand, baby.

easy,"Know it sounds funny. But, I just can't stand the pain. Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow. Seems to me girl. You know I've done all I can. You see I begged, stole and I borrowed! (yeah). Ooh, that's why I'm easy. I'm easy like Sunday morning. That's why I'm easy. I'm easy like Sunday morning. Why in the world would anybody put chains on me?. I've paid my dues to make it.

for your babies (the voice cover),"You've got that look again. The one I hoped I had when I was a lad. Your face is just beaming. Your smile got me boasting. My pulse roller-coastering. Anyway the four winds that blow. They're gonna send me sailing home to you. Or I'll fly with the force of a rainbow. The dream of gold will be waiting in your eyes. You know I'd do most anything you want. Hey, I, I try to give you everything you need. I can see that it gets to you. I don't believe in many things. But in you, I do. Her faith is amazing. The pain that she goes through. Contained in the hope for you. Your whole world has changed. The years spent before. Seem more cloudy than blue. In many ways your baby's controlling. When you haven't laid down for days. For the poor no time to be thinking. They're too busy finding ways. And I. You know I'd do most anything you want. Hey, I, I try to give you everything you need. I see that it gets to you. I don't believe in many things. But in you. I don't believe in many things. But in you. Oh, I don't believe. I don't believe in many things. But in you, I do"
human nature,"Looking out. Across the night time. The city winks a sleepless eye. Hear her voice. Shake my window. Sweet seducing sighs. Get me out. Into the night time. Four walls won't hold me tonight. If this town. Is just an apple. Then let me take a bite. If they say --. Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature. Why, why, does he do me that way. If they say --. Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature. Why, why does he do me that way. Reaching out. To touch a stranger. Electric eyes are every where. See that girl. She knows I'm watching. She likes the way I stare. If they say --. Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature. Why, why, does he do me that way. If they say --. Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature. Why, why does he do me that way. I like livin' this way. I love livin' this way. Looking out. Across the morning. Where the city's heart begins to beat. Reaching out. I touch her shoulder. I'm dreaming of the street. If they say --. Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature. Why, why, does he do me that way. If they say --. Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature. Why, why does he do me that way. Crédito: rafaelolipa"

master blaster (jammin'),"Everyone's feeling pretty. It's hotter than July. Though the world's full of problems. They couldn't touch us even if they tried. From the park I hear rhythms. Marley's hot on the box. Tonight there will be a party. On the corner at the end of the block. Didn't know you. Would be jammin' until the break of dawn. I bet nobody ever told you that you. Would be jammin' until the break of dawn. You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on. They want us to join their fighting. But our answer today. Is to let all our worries. Like the breeze through our fingers slip away. Peace has come to Zimbabwe. Third world's right on the one. Now's the time for celebration. 'Cause we've only just begun. Didn't know you. Would be jammin' until the break of dawn. Bet nobody ever told you that you. Would be jammin' until the break of dawn?. Did nobody ever tell you that you. (We're in the middle of the makin's. of the master blaster jammin'). Would be jammin' until the break of dawn?. I know nobody ever told you that you.

Now that I've tried to. Talk to you and make you understand. All you have to do is. Close your eyes and just reach out your hands. And touch me, hold me close. Don't ever let me go. More than words.
