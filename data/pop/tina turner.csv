the best,"I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire. You come to me, come to me wild and wild. When you come to me. Give me everything I need. Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams. Speak a language of love like you know what it means. And it can't be wrong. Take my heart and make it strong baby. You're simply the best, better than all the rest. Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met. I'm stuck on your heart, and hang on every word you say. Tear us apart, baby I would rather be dead. In your heart I see the star of every night and every day. In your eyes I get lost, I get washed away. Just as long as I'm here in your arms. I could be in no better place. You're simply the best, better than all the rest. Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met. I'm stuck on your heart, and hang on every word you say. Tear us apart, baby I would rather be dead. Each time you leave me I start losing control. You're walking away with my heart and my soul. I can feel you even when I'm alone. Oh baby, don't let go."
we don't need another hero,"Out of the ruins. Out from the wreckage. Can't make the same mistake this time. We are the children. the last generation. We are the ones they left behind. And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it. Living under the fear till nothing else remains. We don't need another hero. We don't need to know the way home. All we want is life beyond the thunderdome. Looking for something we can rely on. There's got to be something better out there. Love and compassion, their day is coming. All else are castles built in the air. And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it. Living under the fear till nothing else remains. All the children say. We don't need another hero. We don't need to know the way home. All we want is life beyond the thunderdome. So what do we do with our lives. We leave only a mark. Will our story shine like a life. Or end in the dark. Is it all or nothing"
what's love got to do with it?,"You must understand that the touch of your hand. Makes my pulse react. That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl. Opposittes attract. It's physical. Only logical.

Stay with me right to the end. Till I can hold you again

Maybe someday we can put the past away. Some will die for you, some will lie to you. There's all kinds of people in this world. Turn the world around, tear the borders down. There's all kinds of people in this world. Some will die for you, some will lie to you. There's all kinds of people in this world. Put your fear away, find a better way.

easy as life,"This is the moment when the gods expect me. To beg for help but I won't even try. I want nothing in the world but myself to protect me. But I won't lie down, roll over and die. All I have to do is to forget how much I love him. All I have to do is put my longing to one side. Tell myself that love's an ever-changing situation. Passion would have cooled and all the magic would have died. It's easy, it's easy. Until I think about him as he was when I last saw him. And how he would have been were I to be with him today. Tender in his manner and my self-consolation. All I ever wanted and I'm throwing it away. It's easy, easy as life. All I have to do is to pretend I never knew him. On those very rare occasions when he steals into my heart. Better to have lost him when the ties were barely binding. Better the contempt of the familiar cannot start. It's easy, it's easy. Until I think about him as he was when I last touched him. And how he would have been were I to be with him today. Those very rare occasions don't let up, they keep on coming. All I ever wanted and I'm throwing it away. It's easy, it's easy as life. And then I see the faces of a worn defeated people. A father and a nation who won't let a coward run. Is this how the gods reward the faithful through the ages. Forcing us to prove that all the hardest things we've done. Are easy, so easy. And though I'll think about him until the earth draws in around me. And though I choose to leave him for another kind of love. This is no denial, no betrayal, but redemption. Redeemed in my own eyes and in the pantheon above. It's easy, it's easy, it's easy as life"

long long time,"Love will abide, take things in stride. Sounds like good advice but there's no one at my side. And time washes clean love's wounds unseen. That's what someone told me but I don't know what it means. Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine. And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time. Caught in my fears. Blinking back the tears. I can't say you hurt me when you never let me near. And I never drew one response from you. All the while you fell all over girls you never knew. Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine. And I think it's gonna hurt me for a long long time. Wait for the day. You'll go away. Knowing that you warned me of the price I'd have to pay. And life's full of flaws. Who knows the cause?. Living in the memory of a love that never was. 'Cause I've done everything. I know to try and change your mind. and I think I'm gonna miss you for a long long time. 'Cause I've done everything. I know to try and make you mine. And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time"

not enough romance,Should´ve never made eye contact. Should´ve been a heart of stone. When you stopped me to say hello. Would´ve been twice as easy. To just say no. Cause I don`t wanna lose at love again. But as a couple we were quite handsome. And the moon was out that night. So we let our hearts go dancing. If that thingis missing in my life. There`s not enough romance in this world. There`s not enough romance in this world. There`s too many people thinking only of themselves. You gotta give love for its return. Wanna sing about new lovers. Stand up against the odds. Nothing can change a thing that strong. And myself I know my emotions. I got my love to share. And when you need something so tender. What you`re looking for is so rare. There`s not enough romance in this world. There`s not enough romance in this world. You gotta believe in what your heart tells you is right. And I`m here to say that I believe in love. We make a lot of chances playing some foolish games. But that`s the only price that you gotta pay. We gotta keep believing hungry hearts run free. It`s anything you want it to be

on silent wings,"(T. J. White, J. Ralston). Producer: Trevor Horn. Album: Wildest Dreams (96). Special Guest: Sting. There was a time when I would have followed you. To the end of the earth. I was willing to share it all with you. The love, the hurt. I've seen you when your dreams were falling in the dust. But I never stopped believing in you. I always thought our love was strong enough. One you could hold on to. You never see it coming. You just let it fly. On silent wings, silent wings. You can't hide what you you feel inside. And the fire has left your eyes. On silent wings. I see us in our dreams and we're dancing. I can almost hear the song. But the prayers, they go unanswered. But we both know, we're just hanging on. I feel ashamed, but I'll never know the reason why. The rug was pulled so gently from under my feet. I only know that something good has died. Between you and me, oh it's just a memory. You never see it coming. You just go separate ways. On silent wings, silent wings. There's no more promises to break. Or our love has slipped away. On silent wings. You never see it coming. But you know it has to end. On silent wings, silent wings. I will never be the same again. I feel the whisper of the wind. On silent wings"

sometimes when we touch,You ask me if I love you. And I choke on my reply. I'd rather hurt you honestly. Than mislead you with a lie. And who am I to judge you. On what you say or do?. I'm only just beginning to see the real you. And sometimes when we touch. The honesty's too much. And I have to close my eyes and hide. I wanna hold you til I die. 'til we both break down and cry. I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides. Romance and all its strategy. Leaves me battling with my pride. But through the insecurity. Some tenderness survives. I'm just another writer. Still trapped within my truth. A hesitant prize fighter. Still trapped within my youth. And sometimes when we touch. The honesty's too much. And I have to close my eyes and hide. I wanna hold you til I die. Til we both break down and cry. I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides. At times I'd like to break you. And drive you to your knees. At times I'd like to break through. And hold you endlessly. At times I understand you. And I see how hard you've tried. I've watched while love commands you. And I've watched love pass you by. At times I think we're drifters. Still searching for a friend. A brother or a sister. But then the passion flares again. And sometimes when we touch. The honesty's too much. And I have to close my eyes and hide. I wanna hold you til I die. Til we both break down and cry. I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

All I ever wanted was a shoulder to lean on. And all you ever wanted was a dream that would last. Promises made in the heat of the moment. I know I never told you that was too much to ask. But it won’t take much gentle persuasion. To make you remember, make me forget. You may not be a knight in white satin. Maybe the best was all in the past. Turn the lights low, lay down beside me. Just till the dawn, I don’t want you to go. Tell me you want me. Baby, I need you too. Stay awhile"

We was out on a back road. Me and my baby was just getting right. All our systems on overload. Radio blasting in the front seat. Turning out the music fine. And we was snuggled up in the back seat. Making up for lost time. Steamy windows. Zero visibility. Steamy windows. Coming from the body heat. You can wine and dine with a man all night. With good intent. But there is something about a confrontation on a back road. Breaks down the difference. Steamy windows. Zero visibility. Steamy windows. Coming from the body heat. Steamy windows. Ain't nobody can see. Steamy windows. Coming from the body heat. There's a sound outside the front door. And I know that's just the wind. And it makes him snuggle up just a little bit closer. And start things happening again. Steamy windows. Ain't nobody can see. Steamy windows. Coming from the body heat"
steel claw,"A night in television wonderland. Another fairytale about some ritch bitch. Lying by the swimming pool. It's the golden school. Living's easy when you make the rules. Last friday was the first time. It only took about a half a minute. On the stairway. It was child's play. The odds turn to even. When you gie up believing in the. [chorus]. Cold law, steel claw. Try to get on board. You find the lock is on the door. Well i say 'no way... '. Don't try to keep me out or there'll be hell to pay. I don't know who's right or who's wrong. But it doesn't really matter when you're lying in the gutter. It's a see saw. A long hot battle with the cold law. Is what you get for messing with the steel claw. The politicians have forgotten this place. Except for a flying visit in a black mercedes. No election time. They cross the line. And everybody runs to watch the pantomime. If they could see what's going here around there. So many people hanging on the edge. Crying out gor revolution. Retribution. The odds turn out even. When you give up believing in the. [chorus]. Sometimes i think i'm going crazy. Sometimes i do a line. Makes me laugh. Makes me want to take a joyride. On the high tide. Sometimes i'm contemplating suicide. Meanwhile eddy's on the west coast. I heard he's shacking up with some sweet senorita. Up in frisco you and i know. The odds turn out even. When you give up believing in the. [chorus]"

Get me back to the me I know with a remedy. Baby I need your therapy. With your healing kiss you know how to make my mind relax. I will listen to the words you say and just lie back. Talk to my heart that's where real talkin' starts. Words of love that cut straight to my heart. Reach out and touch, so few words say so much. I can hear you when you tell it like it is. When you talk straight to my heart. I guess it shows I need attention. Somehow you're asking all the right questions that I've gotta say. What's been on my mind these days. And I know you know just how to make my mind react. When it's coming straight from you that's my first point of contact. Talk to my heart that's where real talkin' starts.

there'll always be music,A mother sings as she rocks her babies. Children sing the noted nursery rhymes. The old church bell is ringing for the Sunday morning singing. Music is as old as the time. As the farmer works the fields he sings a song. The songbirds in the trees sing along. And the wind makes melodies as it whistles through the trees. Man's burdens are made lighter with a song. There'll always be music as long as there's a story to be told. There'll always be music cause music is the voice of the song. There'll always be music. Rain makes rhytmic sounds when it's falling. There's music in a new born baby's cry. There's music all around and there is no sweeter sound. For that's the way a man expresses life. In heaven there's a choir of angels singing. We often heard about God's angel band. Music will live on when men on earth are gone. There'll still be music in that promised land. There'll always be music
