it's over,"I can hear you say. that you can't pretend. tearing every illusions ours again. I dont wanna talk,. not even to work. this is just the last thing i never thought.... That you will be away from me. and someone else. just took your love away. Cause you and me its over,over. our love is gone. just empty places no sun, no fun. your thousand stars above me. everything is over our love is gone. When I look around. I can feel my heart. listen every moment by your side. how could i forget. the first day we met. wishing to belive in fairy tales. With you away. its just the end. this lonelyness. just makes me wanna scape. Cause you and me its over,over. our love is gone. just empty places no sun no fun. your thousand stars above me. everything is over our love is gone. you and me its over,over. our love is gone. just empty places no sun, no fun. your thousand stars above me. everything is over our love is gone. I can't stop feeling,. I can't stop dreaming. about you baby. take me back. my love. your right here beside. me your kisses dont let me go.... . . Luiz Felipe"
nothing it is,"I can hear you say. That you can’t pretend. To remember lose you around again. I don’t wanna talk. not even to walk. this is just the lasting ever thought. that you will be away from me. and someone else just took you left away. ‘cause you and me it’s over, over our love is gone. just into places no sun, no fun. your thoughts starts about me. everything is over our love is gone. when I look around. I can see my heart. Losing every moment by your side. how could I forget the first day we met. wishing to believe in fairy tales. with you away it’s just the end. This loneliness just makes me wanna escape. ‘cause you and me it’s over, over our love is gone. just into places no sun, no fun. your thoughts starts about me. everything is over our love is gone. you and me it’s over, over our love is gone. Just into places no sun, no fun. you’re thoughts starts about me. everything is over our love is gone. I can still feel you,. I can still dreaming. About you baby take me back right now. your heart keep inside me. Your kisses are making me gone. nananana. nanana"
