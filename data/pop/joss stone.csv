But why should I tell you. It's not your concern. You win some, you lose some. Well I've lost and I've learned. Is just that I'm so lonely. With no place to turn. And here at the end, I find. The love that we had. Stays right on my mind. If you were nearer. If you had a mirror. Maybe you could count my tears. And if you were nearer. It would all be clearer. How I wish that you were here. How I wish that you were here. How I wish that you were here. And baby boy I was just so tired. So I laid down to dream a while. But lately I've been so uninspired. Without the comfort of your smile. But I'm not complaining. Cause that's just how it goes. There's always some heartache. In this world, I suppose. But you can't imagine. But nobody knows. The love we had stays on my mind. The love we had stays on my mind. The love we had stays on my mind. Tha love we had stays on my mind"

Somewhere after midnight. In my wildest fantasy. Somewhere just beyond my reach. There's someone reaching back for me. Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat. It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet. Up where the mountains meet the heavens above. Out where the lightning splits the sea. I would swear that there's someone somewhere. Watching me. Through the wind and the chill and the rain. And the storm and the flood. I can fell his approach. Like a fire in my blood

security,A loss that would have thrown. A hole through anybody's soul. And you were only human after all. So don't hold back the tears my dear. Release them so your eyes can clear. I know that you will rise again. But you gotta let them fall. I wish that I could snap my fingers. Erase the past but no. You cannot rewind reality. Once the tape's unrolled. Chorus:. If your spirit's broken and you can't bare the pain. I will help you put the pieces back. A little more each day. And if your heart is locked and you can't find the key. Lay your head upon my shoulder. I'll set you free. I'll be your security. A moment of despair. That forces you to say that life's unfair. It makes you scared of what tomorrow may bring. But don't go giving into fear. Stop hiding all alone in there. The show keeps going on and on. But you'll miss the whole damn thing. I wish I had a crystal ball to see what the future holds. But we don't know how the story ends till it's all been told. Chorus. On any clock upon the wall. The time is always now. So baby kiss the past goodbye. Don't let the future blow your mind. Just sit back and chill. Take things as they come. You can't be afraid. To live for today. I will be with you each step of the way. Chorus (2x). . . Por: Otavio Moreira

snakes and ladders,In the game of love. It takes all you got. Just to keep it moving up. Don't you wanna reach the top. But heaven seems such a crazy dream. If your heart has room for doubt. You're neither in you're neither out. 99 1/2 it just won't do. You gotta give me all of you. Not asking too much of a heart that's true. So tell me.... Chorus. What's the name of the game that we are playing. But whenever I think that we are winning. Then you roll the dice take a slide. Right back to the one from 99. Is it gonna go on like this forever. Are we gonna to take that last step together. Going round and round and up and down. Feels just like snakes and ladders. Baby don't it feel like a carousel. Where all the world is rushing by. But when it stops you realize. That you're right back where you started at. I need a little more than that. Is time for us to face the facts. Whether to be or not to be. That is the question so it seems. We're going nowhere in between. So tell me.... Chorus. Don't wanna play this game anymore. I gotta know right now for sure. What am I giving my heart for. Baby I need a little more. Don't leave me hanging on a string. Now that I gave you everything. . Not when I play to win. Snakes and ladders. Chorus (2x). (Lalalalalala. Lalalalalalalalala). .

But why should I tell you. It's not your concern. You win some, you lose some. Well I've lost and I've learned. Is just that I'm so lonely. With no place to turn. And here at the end, I find. The love that we had. Stays right on my mind. If you were nearer. If you had a mirror. Maybe you could count my tears. And if you were nearer. It would all be clearer. How I wish that you were here. How I wish that you were here. How I wish that you were here. And baby boy I was just so tired. So I laid down to dream a while. But lately I've been so uninspired. Without the comfort of your smile. But I'm not complaining. Cause that's just how it goes. There's always some heartache. In this world, I suppose. But you can't imagine. But nobody knows. The love we had stays on my mind. The love we had stays on my mind. The love we had stays on my mind. Tha love we had stays on my mind"

way oh,"Til we meet again, hold on. Til we speak again, keep strong. The world don't need to know what's going on. Keep up your head until we meet again. The kiss you left on my bedside light. The words you whisper make me feel right. The clothes you scattered on the porch that night. Is all so. You're my special lover man. Always undercover man. See now this I can't stand. We got a problem, babe. You're my precious lover man. And I know I'll never land. Another like you. I can't stand, my secret lover man. Way oh, way oh. Way oh, way oh. Way oh, way oh. Way oh, way oh.

He's my man, my heart, my buffalo soldier. From where I'm standin' there is no turnin' back. At second since I heard his rhythm it was over. I don't want no double time opinion. Most efficient enough, I'm with him. Just stop. Cause you know. You're my special lover man. Always undercover man. See now this I can't stand. We got a problem, babe. You're my precious lover man.

They'll never know, that's the beauty of love. Way oh. Way oh, way oh, way oh. Way oh, way oh, way oh. I hear the chirpin' of the choir in the back. Made up their minds they don't wanna get to know you. They get to chattin' up all kind of trash. Not much is happenin' in their lives, they just get older. They only dig me better with a problem. That don't feel good to myself so I give them not. Cause I know that he's never gonna do me like that. He's my man, my heart, my buffalo soldier. From where I'm standin' there is no turnin' back. At second since I heard his rhythm it was over. I don't want no double time opinion. Most efficient enough, I'm with him. Just stop. Just stop. Way oh, way oh. Way oh, way oh. Way oh, way oh.

what ever happened to the heroes,"I wish i could fly. Like a jet plane. I could read the minds. Of my enemies. Worship a poster. Carry a lunch box. Have a super hero. To come and rescue me.

Fast food, fast cars and remote control. I just need someone, to look up to. To help me down, this winding road. (Whatever happened to the heroes). Joe Demagio. Martin Luther King. Mother Theresa. Princess Diana. Now it's Kurt Cobane. Take a pill for the pain. Celebrity mentality. Before you even spell your name. I know I'm full of imperfections, baby aren’t we all. But i could use a good example, stop before i fall. (Stop before I fall, what happened to). Whatever happened to the heroes?. (Oh, Oh). Fast food, fast cars and remote control. (Remote control). I just need someone, to look up to. To help me down, this winding road. (This winding road). So whatever happened to the heroes?. We fall to the waste side. You've been to the dark side. Buried alive. Before my eyes. Been brought to life. A zillion times. They like to build you up. Just to break you down, down, down. Just to break you down, oh. Whatever happened to the heroes?. (Whatever happened to the heroes?). Fast food, fast cars and remote control. (Oh yeah, what happened to the heroes, what happened to the heroes?). I just need someone, to look up to.
