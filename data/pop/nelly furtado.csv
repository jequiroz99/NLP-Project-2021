say it right,"In the day, in the night. Say it right, say it all. You either got it or you don't. You either stand or you fall. When your will is broken. When it slips from your hand.

And all of what I feel I could show. You tonight, you tonight. Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me. No, you don't mean nothing at all to me. But you've got what it takes to set me free. Oh, you could mean everything to me. From my hands I could give you. Something that I made. From my mouth. I could sing you another brick that I laid. From my body I could show you a place. God knows. You should know the space is holy. Do you really want to go?"

all good things (come to an end),Honestly what will become of me. I don't like reality. It's way too clear to me. But really life is daily. We are what we don't see. We miss everything daydreaming. Flames to dust. Lovers to friends. Why do all good things come to an end?. Traveling I always stop at exits. Wondering if I'll stay. Young and restless. Living this way I stress less. I want to pull away when the dream dies. The pain sets it and I don't cry. I only feel gravity and I wonder why. Flames to dust. Lovers to friends. Why do all good things come to an end?. Dogs were whistling a new tune. Barking at the new moon. Hoping it would come soon so that they could die. Flames to dust. Lovers to friends. Why do all good things come to an end?. When the dogs were barking at the new moon. Whistling a new tune. Hoping it would come soon. And the sun was wondering if it should. stay away for a. day until the feeling went away. And the sky was falling and the clouds were dropping. and the the rain forgot how to bring salvation. And the dogs were barking at the new moon. Whistling a new tune. So they could die. Hoping it would come soon so that they could die

That you don't know me that well. And though my love is rare. And though my love is true. (Chorus). It's not that I wanna say goodbye. It's just that every time you try to tell me, me that you love me. Each and every single day I know. I'm gonna have to eventually give you away. And though my love is rare,rare,rare.

Shaky shaky steps in the middle of the day. A fire in my path and a cool decay. Of limbs and tooth under my skin. Oh, freedom, where do I begin?. I'm changing my inflection and how I say the words. Maybe it will sound like something they've never heard. Oh, death of the party. I picked up the chalice of malice. And drank till I was full, I drank till I was full. I was thirsty but I drank till I was full,. I drank till I, till I,till I was full. . There's a fever in my bones that I know so well. I keep my head low low low to avoid the swell. But it'll be cold in hell, it'll be cold in hell. Before they put me in that chamber. So I'm cleaning up as fast as I can. I'm cleaning up as fast as I can. Cuz you can't unbreak what you break, you can't unfake the very fake. You cannot fuel without a tank,. no you can't unbreak what you break, what you break. . Chorus x 2."
afraid (feat. attitude),What they say what they say what they say. You speak out all you feel is defiance. All you need is some self-reliance. Cuz this world is gonna always try us. And all you wanted was to run for cover. Well here's looking to yourself and no other. We're all searching for that special something. And we keep on running. We all have the choice to take the lead or follow. I want to feel the light shine on me. You're so afraid of what people might say. But that's okay cuz you're only human. You're so afraid of what people might say. But that's okay you'll soon get strong enough. You're so afraid of what people might say. But that's okay cuz you're only human. You're so afraid of what people might say. You're going to break so please don't do it. You wanna spread your wings but you're not sure. Don't wanna leave your comforts. Wanna find a cure. We're afraid of who we see in the mirror. We wanna let go but it feels too pure. Who wants to be alone in this world. You look around and all you see is hurt. But the light it always guides us. If we move with a little trust. A diamond don't define what shine is. I don't need a Rolex to know what the time is. You got yours let me find what mine in. I'm a survivor look how strong my mind is. I stand on my own it's all me. Regardless of whatever they call me. I'm a leader not a follower. And I'd rather be paid and popular. Ride homie get your dollars up. We're in the belly of the beast that already swallowed us
all good things (come to an end),Honestly what will become of me. I don't like reality. It's way too clear to me. But really life is daily. We are what we don't see. We miss everything daydreaming. Flames to dust. Lovers to friends. Why do all good things come to an end?. Traveling I always stop at exits. Wondering if I'll stay. Young and restless. Living this way I stress less. I want to pull away when the dream dies. The pain sets it and I don't cry. I only feel gravity and I wonder why. Flames to dust. Lovers to friends. Why do all good things come to an end?. Dogs were whistling a new tune. Barking at the new moon. Hoping it would come soon so that they could die. Flames to dust. Lovers to friends. Why do all good things come to an end?. When the dogs were barking at the new moon. Whistling a new tune. Hoping it would come soon. And the sun was wondering if it should. stay away for a. day until the feeling went away. And the sky was falling and the clouds were dropping. and the the rain forgot how to bring salvation. And the dogs were barking at the new moon. Whistling a new tune. So they could die. Hoping it would come soon so that they could die
baby girl,"Nelly Furtado. Baby Girl. I’ve seen a man cry. I’ve seen a man die inside. I’ve seen him say to me that he is only mine. That he gotta do what is best for him. Never let me in, not even begin. To tell me I’m the one under his moon and sun. That I am the thing that revolves around him. But while on top of him. I know what’s best for him. I’ll show him how to win. And let me in cuz. 1 - I don’t wanna be your baby girl. I don’t wanna be your little pearl. I just wanna be what’s best for me. To be one-da-dum with my own star under my own sun. We’re all sorry now, I didn’t mean to wow. Make you cry like that, it’s just a little spat. Still I want you to know, though I love you so. It’s mostly me dreaming, forcing, believing. That you’re an ideal, hell I never steal. But I stole you from, from another one. So take yourself and wrap around my little finger. Cuz that’s how I think it should swing. Repeat 1. Why can’t he see. Why can’t he see. What’s inside of me, yeah. Don’t you, don’t you call me coochie-coo, a little girl now. Don’t you gaga goo no coochie-coo girl now. I’m so much more, can’t you see?. Can’t you see?. Look who’s writing now a token of their love. Can’t you see love that it’s just because. I wanted a cheap way to get inside your head. And not a cheap way to get inside your bed. Oh you’re running now, with that silly one. It’s all over now, this woman’s just begun. Maybe we’ll see about the will and the way. Butterflies return some day. Repeat 1."

Sometimes my skin's so thick it's frail. I just need to be ignored 'til I wake up to the beaty that is yours. And it all comes to life so suddenly. This is a place so deep, the water's so deep I hesitate, cause. All the energy it takes to feel this power. I tend to run, I tend to hide, I tend to scream 'til I find you and I know I got you.

Just a little look has got me feeling things. Just a little taste has got me seeing things. Just a little touch has got me off the chains. Doing things that I don't want to. Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up). Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough). Do it like you do it to me just open up don't you know how much I want you. We're sitting real close and I can feel your breath. I wanna touch your hand but I lay back. 'cause you know this thing could spiral in the night. I've changed my mind I'm ready for you this time. We're sitting real close I can feel your breath I wanna touch your hand but I lay back We're sitting real close I can feel your breath I wanna touch your hand I cannot fight it off.

don't leave me,Here I go again. With my head in my hands. When you say you'll call but you don't. And then I'll pretend. This is the last time. That I'll take you back when you say you're sorry. Don't leave me no more. Every time you walk out the door. I don't know if you're gonna come back around here anymore. Don't leave me no more. Every time you walk out the door. I don't know if you're gonna come back to me here anymore. Don't leave. Don't leave. I used to be a queen. But now I'm a shadow of me. I deserve more but love is a chore. And wanting you has made me so weak. Don't leave me no more. Every time you walk out the door. I don't know if you're gonna come back around here anymore. Don't leave me no more. Every time you walk out the door. I don't know if you're gonna come back to me here anymore. Don't leave. Don't leave. I'm such a fool for you. And you keep playing and playing around. Until the sun comes down and rises again in the morning. And my heart keeps breaking and breaking. And I'm tired of wasting and wasting away for a cure. Don't leave me no more. Every time you walk out the door. I don't know if you're gonna come back around here anymore. Don't leave me no more. Every time you walk out the door. I don't know if you're gonna come back to me here anymore. Don't leave. Don't leave. My heart keeps breaking and breaking and breaking down. You keep playing and playing and playing around
end game,I stayed up all night with my phone right beside me. I'm waiting but you'll never call. And I communicate and know when I relate. It's like we're not together at all. I stayed up all night and I stared at the ceiling. I wonder where we went wrong. It's like I'm psychic and I know what's around the corner. And I don't wanna be alone. I need to know if you're still in love. I need to know how you feel about us. Tell me what's your end game. Are we on the same page?. Running in the same race?. Or is this just to please me. Tell me what's your end game. Are we on the same page?. Is this just a bad day. Or do you really need space. I stayed up all night and I replayed the past. With over everything that you said. Feel like an idiot the how far this went. I act on really over my head. I need to know if you still in love. Tell me what's your end game. Are we on the same page?. Are we running in the same race?. Or am I just still playing. Tell me what's your end game. Are we on the same page?. Is this just a bad day. Or do you really need space. Unless you can say that you're really a mess. I wish you could tell that you're really a mess. I really wish I could say that I'm really a mess. But you're not at all. Baby I'm a billionaire. I admit that I'm really a mess.

enemy,"I want everything to be perfect. Pick you apart at the seams. Drown you out if I don't want to hear you. Crush every single one of your dreams. I'm going under the water it's pulling me down. I can't help myself. I'm my own worst enemy, enemy, enemy. It'll be the end of me, end of me, end of me. I wanted to go the distance. I met everything with resistance. I pulled the pin out on the grenade. Burned down everything I had made. As I struggle in here I see angels near. Can't help myself. I'm my own worst enemy, enemy, enemy. It'll be the end of me, end of me, end of me. And the coast is clear on me, clear on me, clear on me. I'm my own worst enemy, enemy. I'm an open field. I put on my armour. Strap on my boots.

explode,"Peso... Joga... Ginga... Roda. Vera's face burnt as a memory of bedroom fun. With a ligther and some hairspray. Smoking in the girls' room. Not worse than Shelley's rape behind the Mcdonald's. By a man she thought was fine, didn't tell anybody. Maybe back then we just thought that she was getting some. Now we look back and see that she didn't know how. We never thought that we'd get caught up. Stuck in the teenage waste. As we explode. As we explode. Then getting drunk in the bushes by the road. Outside the Kmart rolling around in them to see. If you would get prickled, slip the acid on your tongue. Rooftop mall parkade, we couldn't get enough. Then count the stars and the ten million woes. Just you and the universe judging each other. We never knew that we'd get caught up. Stuck in the teenage waste. As we explode. As we explode. As we explode. As we let go. Peso... Roda... Ginga... Joga. It's a fight, it's a fight and you finally belong. Got a shiner now and it's more than a battle scar. More than a battle scar, such a good, good story to tell. At lunch break, lunch break, lunch break, lunch break. Such a good, good story to tell. You bully, you break, you bully, you break. You fake, you fake, you fake, you fake. You smoke, you toke, you want, you flaunt. You hit it and you're in it and it's spinning. And it's wild. We never thought that we'd get caught up. Stuck in the teenage waste. As we explode. As we explode. As we explode. As we let go. We're counting the stars. We're counting the stars. We're gonna go far, we're gonna go far. We're counting the stars. We're counting the stars. We're not very far, we're not very far. And it's you and me in the open air. It's truth or dare, we don't care. We're counting the stars. We're counting the stars. We're counting the stars. We're counting the stars"

getaway,"(Intro). Ah what you say boy?. Nelly. Stack$. (Bridge). Oh yea, oh yea. Oh yea, oh yea. Oh yea, oh yea. Oh yea. (Verse). It's all good, I don't even miss you anymore and. It's all good, I don't wish it was you at my door and. It's our love, maybe we can't even stay friends. It's our love, if it's gotta end it's gotta end. (Verse). They say trouble never had a face. So you don't know what love is til it's took away. Crazy things that you in or ain't you can't escape. Think about the money made and it ain't shit. My playing days coming early and I change quick. Honey we could fly away in my spaceship. Goodbye fly, gladiator style Russell. Mel Gibson tussles. Love the way you always lie, love how I don't trust you. She tell me love is like a prison, wish you wanna run. Hold yo breath 'cus the drama always makes it fun. What a time, blow yo mind, I can set you off. Pull you by the arm, tell me what went wrong. (Pre-Chorus). I wanna get away (Why? Why?). Thinkin of us, baby (Why? Why?). And I be going crazy for the longest time (Why? Why?). I wanna getaway (Why? Why?). Thinkin I was sinkin (Why? Why?). And now we're sinkin deep, couldn't even tell me why. (Why? Why?). (Chorus). I need water, I'm so thirsty. And you're freakin me out, the way you going about. And won't you please let me out of here. (please let me out of here). Our love is jah it's lost a vibe length. I haven't got time to get to the other side. Of this desert we ride so... bye bye. (Verse). It's all good, I used to be inspired. But now I'm feelin tired, I've gotta say. It's all good, there was an emptiness but. 'Cus when you went of it I felt somewhere else. (Pre-Chorus). I wanna get away (Why? Why?). Thinkin of us, baby (Why? Why?). And I be going crazy for the longest time (Why? Why?). I wanna getaway (Why? Why?). Thinkin I was sinkin (Why? Why?). And now we're sinkin deep, couldn't even tell me why. (Why? Why?). (Chorus). I need water, I'm so thirsty. And you're freakin me out, the way you going about. And won't you please let me out of here. (please let me out of here). Our love is jah it's lost a vibe length. I haven't got time to get to the other side. Of this desert we ride so... bye bye. (Verse). I'm shuttin my door down. Want you no more. All the G's that I had just fell to the floor now. Once as the chariots go pick up the pieces. Even if you were a prince or king o even Jesus. I'm married to myself right now baby. The keys are in the engine, I'mma give this. Another driver now but it's over now. If you said you argue wise you'll wanna have to tell yo lies. That was true - all of those times. I said I'll love you til I die but time is time. We're far belong, our love was fire but now I'm strong. (Verse). So when you want it, you want it. When you want it, I get it. All that hootin and hollering, it ain't making a difference. Psychedelic embellish but maybe prison my sentence. I try explain this, I'm famous to groupies pry on my bidness. Never been copasetic when you travellin promotin records. And we fight Skype. Yikes, she say she pregnant. And it's all bad, shit was good a week ago. Performin at Summer Jam, how'd I leave er at the show?. I thought I fuckin told yall, this ain't a wannabe song. Might fly a little in the cold, or really like 3 story. 365 ways to get to yo heart. Yo lovin is strainin, it may be best if we part. Done. (Bridge). Oh yea, oh yea. Oh yea, oh yea. Oh yea, oh yea. Oh yea. (Pre-Chorus). I wanna get away (Why? Why?). Thinkin of us, baby (Why? Why?). And I be going crazy for the longest time (Why? Why?). I wanna getaway (Why? Why?). Thinkin I was sinkin (Why? Why?). And now we're sinkin deep, couldn't even tell me why. (Why? Why?). (Chorus 2). I got nothing left to say to you. I got nothing left to do it. No, you cannot seem to do this. We just gotta go and do this. Nothing, nothing left to say to you. I got nothing left to do it. I got no time for you, I'll spend it. Now all this love for you has ended. I did it all"

Hey, man, I let my conscience get in the way!. And there's a shadow in the sky , but it looks like rain,. And shit is gonna fly once again,. And I don't mean to rain on your parade,. But pathos has got me once again.... And I don't want ambivalence. No I don't want ambivelence no more. No I don't want ambivelence no more. I said I don't want ambivalence,. No I don't want ambivalence no more!"

And my over capacitated bank account. Money is all I think about. Of my life it's a highlight. Tired of being low I'm ready for the high life. Look at me now. Look at how I get down. Stubs and Wooten on my feet. I'm the flyest youngin in town. But I'm loosin it. My vision has just become an illusion. And Now my highlife is low again. Struggling to hold it in I was on a mission. And messed everything up making all the wrong decisions. I know it's not the end Well then again it might be. And it's sucks god forbid you ever end up like me. And now I'm singing like.

But I want you. A glass of water on a sunny day. The cold air as it hits our faces. I can't face it. In december on the sidewalk as we talk. And I just fall out of myself. I just fall out of myself. I can't help it. I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live. Getting what I need and never what I want. Cause I don't need you. But I want you. I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live. Getting what I need and never what I want. Cause I don't want to. But I want you. And I feel so alive. And I can't get back down on the ground. I feel so alive when I go after what I want. And this fever is going wild. And I'm not gonna settle down. And I want what I want. I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live. Getting what I need and never what I want. Cause I don't need you.

Why don't you think of me anymore?. Why don't you think of me anymore?. Look what life's done to you. You hear lies in everybody's truths. Have you just grown up and given up?. And you don't believe in magic anymore. Have you just grown up and given up?. And I keep on bending all my lines. To fit into a place that feels nice. To do my work and then go home tonight. I put away all my red shoes. So that I wouldn't get the blues. Thinking about the time that I knew how to dance. Have you just grown up and given up?. And you don't believe in magic anymore.

Shaky shaky steps in the middle of the day. A fire in my path and a cool decay. Of limbs and tooth under my skin. Oh, freedom, where do I begin?. I'm changing my inflection and how I say the words. Maybe it will sound like something they've never heard. Oh, death of the party. I picked up the chalice of malice. And drank till I was full, I drank till I was full. I was thirsty but I drank till I was full,. I drank till I, till I,till I was full. . There's a fever in my bones that I know so well. I keep my head low low low to avoid the swell. But it'll be cold in hell, it'll be cold in hell. Before they put me in that chamber. So I'm cleaning up as fast as I can. I'm cleaning up as fast as I can. Cuz you can't unbreak what you break, you can't unfake the very fake. You cannot fuel without a tank,. no you can't unbreak what you break, what you break. . Chorus x 2."

picture perfect,"Picture perfect a life that you saw in a magazine. Or maybe a travelling book. Wanted to get on that plane and fly away. Cause you are a rock star deep down inside. You walk with a swagger, got nothin´ to hide. Cigarette in your mouth, a cuff on your jeans. Your sideburns are perfect, you're a perfect and lean. So you made an oil painting to inmortalise. All of the hope and vision in your eyes. In your leisure coat and cowboy hat. North american records and so much to bat for. Please bring me along. Please bring me along. Because I want to see everything you have to offer me. Get a job lifting cement. Oh it's so dry when it rains it gets wet. And the village was great, now it's a suburb. You left behind half of all that you had learnt. Relearn a couple of things along the way. The thrift shop so clean all for half what you'd pay. So you try everything on, on for size. Drop top your Camaro and go for a ride. Please bring me along. Please bring me along. Because i want to see everything you have to offer me. And I don't mind to sit here and waste my time. Oh but this world is not mine to define. And I want to shine. Please bring me along. Please take me away. I don't want to stay. And I want to see everything you have to offer me. And I want to see everything you have to offer me. And I want to see everything you have to offer me. I want to see everything the world has to offer me. I want to see everything the world has to offer me. I want to show everything i have to offer it. I want to show everything i have to offer it now"

Wanna be the one to spin the wheel. I know that we can only give. When we have hope. But I don't wanna live. Without any goals. Can't protect me from nothing. Can't save me from the truth. You can't even save me from you. So don't sell me no pipe dreams. I wanna feel the good and bad in everything. Even when it hurts, even when it hurts. I know that we can only give. When we got a little hope. But I don't like the burden. Of living with these ghosts. Yes I will hold my head high. When I walk in your parade. But I will always check my gait. I will always watch my gait. Pipe dreams. Pipe dreams. Pipe dreams. Pipe dreams. If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on. If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on.

red balloons,"There's a string wrapped aroung my finger. It's getting tighter everyday. And it just goes on forever. It's wrapped around every word you said. It's like a memory. A shoebox in my mind. It's calling out to me to open up and look inside. It makes me believe in all we could have been. But all the things we were. It's just me imagining. Take these red balloons and watch them fly away. I'm untying my heart and letting go today. Time has come for me to see the truth. And walk up to the edge and let go all these red balloons. There's a shadow when I walk forward. And it keeps trying to hold me back. I can cry at the strangest moments. Reminding me of what I can't have. Don't wanna believe in all we could have been. Cause I'm so tired of everything I'm imaging. Take these red balloons and watch them fly away. I'm untying my heart and letting go today. Time has come for me to see the truth. And walk up to the edge and let go all these red balloons. The child in me wants to run. And collect every single balloon and never forget. The child in me wants to live in a dream of carousels. And wish me well. Take these red balloons and watch them fly away. I'm untying my heart and letting go today. Cause every single dream of the past. Does nothing for me or hold me back.

sacrifice (ft. the roots),"Listen, I got you phobic off of this like arachnids. Drastic, it ain't plastic it's Pro-Blackness. Grown man tactics, no pediatrics. the kind of track that make the comeback miraculous. the catalyst, Thought with the knack for splashin'. I'm dashin' I mastered the craft of mashin'. The level-headed throughbred, the female's passion. Mag-netic attraction be keepin' them askin'. The crews in the Cadillacs with the Pendergrassin'. Swerve half-naked, won't come near crashin'. But if I go to heaven, would y'all know my name. or would it be the same for you like I was Eric Clapton, huh?. Clap for you freedom dog, that's what's happening. My spit take critical political action. The hustle is a puzzle each piece is a fraction. And every word that's understood is a transaction. I'm an S.P. soldier, microphone holder. Rep Philly set from Bolivia to Boulder. Paris, France to Tip and Tioga. How we gonna make it through the dark, I show ya. [Chorus]. I tell you one lesson I learned. If you want to be something in life. You ain't gonna get it unless. You give a little bit of sacrifice. Ooohh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry. You need a heart that's filled with music. If you use it you can fly. If you want to be high. Listen, yo kick off your shoes, jump off the jock. I fly higher than them dudes, from off your block. My name Black, the style is unorthodox. It tap chins in your mens 'til you thought could box. A couple of people wanted Thought to stop, but guess what?. My man grab the missile, plug for the gut. Now next time beatty stop being such a glut. I'm precise with it like Faheim with haircuts. We up close on 'em with toast but no crust. It's fructose on 'em they froze and won't bust. Choke on your face you jewels is lacklust. Got to put it to you straight, y'all fools is jacked up. Came close to the upmost but no cigar. Nose to the grindstone, head to the stars. The number one runner with the number one drummer. Grammy award winnin' it's the world's eighth wonder. Come on. I tell you one lesson I learned. If you want to be something in life. You ain't gonna get it unless. You give a little bit of sacrifice. Ooohh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry. You need a heart that's filled with music. If you use it you can fly. If you want to be high. Your first impression might be I'm a asshole. Or say I'm sometimey and give people a hassle. Or try to suntouch and put the heat in the capsule. Dog I'm far deeper than that though; I get in the zone. Recognize I'm a rolling stone. No time to lollygag or lounge with scaliwags. Give me the disc or I put it where your body at. Old school spit flow laid over Trotter tracks. With no apology fraud or trick-knowledgy. Just trust, what I see and I say and follow me my way. I read an open booklet inside me. The star of the story that groove teller got me. Through all the dark times part of the business. The light be contingent on small forensics. My microphone'll make a man a newborn infant. It's true so the crew gon' sense it. I get in the zone. I tell you one lesson I learned. If you want to be something in life. You ain't gonna get it unless. You give a little bit of sacrifice. Ooohh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry. You need a heart that's filled with music. If you use it you can fly. If you want to be high. I tell you one lesson I learned.

stars,There are so many stars in the sky tonight. Which one will I take in my hand?. There are so many ways I can live my life. Which one will I make part of my plan?. There are so many spirits in the air tonight. Trying to pull me away. You're a part of me. You're in every breath that I breathe. And every step forward that I take. And then I take a step backwards. If I don't see your face. You're a part of me. You're in every song that I sing. And every bird that sings to me. This is what I dream. To be real. This is my reality. There are so many songs on the people's faces. Everyone could be yours but they're not. And all is lost if I count the truth. To my own heart. You're a part of me. You're in every breath that I breathe. And every step forward that I take. And then I take a step backwards. When I can't see your face. You're a part of me. You're in every song that I sing. And every bird that sings to me. This is what I dream. To be real. This is my reality. Because my heart is a lonely hunter. Dying to strike out. Grabbed you into my world when you didn't even ask. But you always knew that you had a part. You're a part of me. You're in every breath that I breathe. And every step forward that I take. And then I take a step backwards. When I don't see your face. You're a part of me. You're in every song that I sing. And every word that speaks to me. This is what I believe. To be real. This is my reality. I live in this sea. There are so many stars in the sky. Tonight

te busqué (versão bilíngue),I've been high I've been low. I've been fast I've been slow. I've had nowhere to go. Missed the bus missed the show. I've been down on my luck. I've felt like giving up. My life locked in a trunk. When it hurt way too much. I needed a reason to live. Some love inside me to give. I couldn't rest I had to keep on searching. (CHORUS). Te busqué de bajo de las piedras y no te encontré. En la manana fria y en la noche te busqué. Hasta enloquecer. Pero tu llegaste a mi vida como una luz. Sanando las heridas de mi corazón. Haciendome sentir vivo otra vez. I've been too sad to speak and too tired to eat. Been too lonely to sing the devil cut off my wings. I've been hurt by my past but I feel the future. In my dreams and it lasts I wake up I'm not sure. I wanted to find the light something just didn't feel right. I needed an answer to end all my searching. (CHORUS). I look in the mirror the picture's getting clearer. I wanna be myself but does the world really need her. I ache for this earth. I stopped going to church. See God in the trees makes me fall to my knees. My depression keeps building like a cup overfilling. My heart so rigid I keep it in the fridge. It hurts so bad that I can't dry my eyes. Cuz they keep on refillin' with the tears that I cry.... (CHORUS) x4. by juu

I'm not looking back. But I want to look around me now. Time stand still. See more of the people. And the places that surround me now. Time stand still. Freeze this moment. A little bit longer. Make each sensation. A little bit stronger. Experience slips away.... Experience slips away.... Time stand still. I turn my face to the sun. I close my eyes. I let my defenses down. All those wounds. That I can't get unwound. I let my past go too fast. No time to pause. If I could slow it all down. Like some captain,. Whose ship runs aground. I can wait until the tide comes around. Time stand still. I'm not looking back. But I want to look around me now. Time stand still. See more of the people. And the places that surround me. Now. Freeze this moment. A little bit longer. Make each sensation. A little bit stronger. Make each impression. A little bit stronger. Freeze this motion. A little bit longer. The innocence slips away.... The innocence slips away.... Time stand still. Time stand still. I'm not looking back. But I want to look around me now. See more of the people. And the places that surround me now. Time stand still. Summer's going fast.

Experience slips away.... The innocence slips away..."

trynna finda way,"I left my heart in San Francisco with some club kids. On a crowded street somewhere. The sky was red and he said,. ""Would you like to come be a part of my North American Dream?"". I could try to chase life down. Down the street and I'd find. The separation of fact and. Fiction. I'm tryin' a find a way. I'm tryin' a find a right. And if I budge I just might. I'm tryin' a find a way. I'm tryin' a find a right. And if I budge I just might. I left my conscience somewhere with my rhythm. I heard about it from the mouth of a man. He was hopping some trains and combing the land. Looking for a lover planted in the east. Trying to run from the dreaded fist beast. And it lies, it lies. In the picket fence call. It was my own paradise with. My own private corridor. I'm tryin' a find a way. I'm tryin' a find a right. And if I budge I just might. I'm tryin' a find a way. I'm tryin' a find a right. And if I budge I just might. So I'm dancing to a new beat and it came to me in bed. My veins became a strain of light that I let to flow instead. And a wish came to me like Peter Pan at my window and said. ""Evolve your destiny child and you'll never walk alone, no.. You'll never walk alone,"" but. Travel to the land of surrender. Till' you can't cry no more. Till you can't, till you can't. And you'll never walk alone. All this inspiration is passing me by. All I can do is chill when I really wanna fly. And this pollution do nothing but dirty up my mind. Faster than forever in the blink of an eye. To see past my lethargy is hard I feign. The beauty of my youth is gone. But the chemicals remain. I'm tryin' a find a way. I'm tryin' a find a right. And if I budge I just might. I'm tryin' a find a way. I'm tryin' a find a right. And if I budge I just might. I'm tryin' a find a way. I'm tryin' a find a right. And if I budge I just might. I travel to this land of surrender but I see it's all over me,. Over and over. again...and I try and I try and I try.... An angel on my left side and a devil on my right... And they fight and they fight and they fight..they're fighting,. They're fighting, they're fighting for my attention...hello?. You have my attention...Do I have your attention.... Can I have your attention please?...please,. You've made such such an impression on me"

all good things (come to an end),Honestly what will become of me. I don't like reality. It's way too clear to me. But really life is daily. We are what we don't see. We miss everything daydreaming. Flames to dust. Lovers to friends. Why do all good things come to an end?. Traveling I always stop at exits. Wondering if I'll stay. Young and restless. Living this way I stress less. I want to pull away when the dream dies. The pain sets it and I don't cry. I only feel gravity and I wonder why. Flames to dust. Lovers to friends. Why do all good things come to an end?. Dogs were whistling a new tune. Barking at the new moon. Hoping it would come soon so that they could die. Flames to dust. Lovers to friends. Why do all good things come to an end?. When the dogs were barking at the new moon. Whistling a new tune. Hoping it would come soon. And the sun was wondering if it should. stay away for a. day until the feeling went away. And the sky was falling and the clouds were dropping. and the the rain forgot how to bring salvation. And the dogs were barking at the new moon. Whistling a new tune. So they could die. Hoping it would come soon so that they could die

party,"Talking to the mirror again but it's not listening. Cleaning my dirty mind like a toilet but it won't give in. Drinking spirits in the hopes that I will find myself one. But all I can rectify is that the party's just begun. . Chorus:. Party's just begun. Party's just begun. Party's just begun. Party's just begun. . I feel like falling asleep and never waking up. It's not that my glass is empty but I need another cup. When all of the doors around me just shut one by one. I feel like falling asleep but the party's just begun. . Chorus. Shaky shaky steps in the middle of the day. A fire in my path and a cool decay. Of limbs and tooth under my skin. Oh, freedom, where do I begin?. I'm changing my inflection and how I say the words. Maybe it will sound like something they've never heard. Oh, death of the party. I picked up the chalice of malice. And drank till I was full, I drank till I was full. I was thirsty but I drank till I was full,. I drank till I, till I,till I was full. . There's a fever in my bones that I know so well. I keep my head low low low to avoid the swell. But it'll be cold in hell, it'll be cold in hell. Before they put me in that chamber. So I'm cleaning up as fast as I can. I'm cleaning up as fast as I can. Cuz you can't unbreak what you break, you can't unfake the very fake. You cannot fuel without a tank,. no you can't unbreak what you break, what you break. . Chorus x 2."
afraid (feat. attitude),What they say what they say what they say. You speak out all you feel is defiance. All you need is some self-reliance. Cuz this world is gonna always try us. And all you wanted was to run for cover. Well here's looking to yourself and no other. We're all searching for that special something. And we keep on running. We all have the choice to take the lead or follow. I want to feel the light shine on me. You're so afraid of what people might say. But that's okay cuz you're only human. You're so afraid of what people might say. But that's okay you'll soon get strong enough. You're so afraid of what people might say. But that's okay cuz you're only human. You're so afraid of what people might say. You're going to break so please don't do it. You wanna spread your wings but you're not sure. Don't wanna leave your comforts. Wanna find a cure. We're afraid of who we see in the mirror. We wanna let go but it feels too pure. Who wants to be alone in this world. You look around and all you see is hurt. But the light it always guides us. If we move with a little trust. A diamond don't define what shine is. I don't need a Rolex to know what the time is. You got yours let me find what mine in. I'm a survivor look how strong my mind is. I stand on my own it's all me. Regardless of whatever they call me. I'm a leader not a follower. And I'd rather be paid and popular. Ride homie get your dollars up. We're in the belly of the beast that already swallowed us
all good things (come to an end),Honestly what will become of me. I don't like reality. It's way too clear to me. But really life is daily. We are what we don't see. We miss everything daydreaming. Flames to dust. Lovers to friends. Why do all good things come to an end?. Traveling I always stop at exits. Wondering if I'll stay. Young and restless. Living this way I stress less. I want to pull away when the dream dies. The pain sets it and I don't cry. I only feel gravity and I wonder why. Flames to dust. Lovers to friends. Why do all good things come to an end?. Dogs were whistling a new tune. Barking at the new moon. Hoping it would come soon so that they could die. Flames to dust. Lovers to friends. Why do all good things come to an end?. When the dogs were barking at the new moon. Whistling a new tune. Hoping it would come soon. And the sun was wondering if it should. stay away for a. day until the feeling went away. And the sky was falling and the clouds were dropping. and the the rain forgot how to bring salvation. And the dogs were barking at the new moon. Whistling a new tune. So they could die. Hoping it would come soon so that they could die
baby girl,"Nelly Furtado. Baby Girl. I’ve seen a man cry. I’ve seen a man die inside. I’ve seen him say to me that he is only mine. That he gotta do what is best for him. Never let me in, not even begin. To tell me I’m the one under his moon and sun. That I am the thing that revolves around him. But while on top of him. I know what’s best for him. I’ll show him how to win. And let me in cuz. 1 - I don’t wanna be your baby girl. I don’t wanna be your little pearl. I just wanna be what’s best for me. To be one-da-dum with my own star under my own sun. We’re all sorry now, I didn’t mean to wow. Make you cry like that, it’s just a little spat. Still I want you to know, though I love you so. It’s mostly me dreaming, forcing, believing. That you’re an ideal, hell I never steal. But I stole you from, from another one. So take yourself and wrap around my little finger. Cuz that’s how I think it should swing. Repeat 1. Why can’t he see. Why can’t he see. What’s inside of me, yeah. Don’t you, don’t you call me coochie-coo, a little girl now. Don’t you gaga goo no coochie-coo girl now. I’m so much more, can’t you see?. Can’t you see?. Look who’s writing now a token of their love. Can’t you see love that it’s just because. I wanted a cheap way to get inside your head. And not a cheap way to get inside your bed. Oh you’re running now, with that silly one. It’s all over now, this woman’s just begun. Maybe we’ll see about the will and the way. Butterflies return some day. Repeat 1."

You are, you are the realest thing I know. Hands down. The realest thing I know. I am not used to being carried. Or being able to carry a pretty song. I have been bruised by my many trails. Sometimes my skin's so thick it's frail. I just need to be ignored 'til I wake up to the beaty that is yours. And it all comes to life so suddenly. This is a place so deep, the water's so deep I hesitate, cause. All the energy it takes to feel this power. I tend to run, I tend to hide, I tend to scream 'til I find you and I know I got you.

do it,You're standing at the door. I'm falling to the floor. You look even better than you did before. I'm staring at my feet. Wondering if I can do this. It's been a while but I couldn't forget you. Just a little look has got me feeling things. Just a little taste has got me seeing things. Just a little touch has got me off the chains. Doing things that I don't want to. Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up). Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough). Do it like you do it to me just open up don't you know how much I want you. We're sitting real close and I can feel your breath. I wanna touch your hand but I lay back. 'cause you know this thing could spiral in the night. I've changed my mind I'm ready for you this time. We're sitting real close I can feel your breath I wanna touch your hand but I lay back We're sitting real close I can feel your breath I wanna touch your hand I cannot fight it off.

I don't know if you're gonna come back to me here anymore. Don't leave. Don't leave. I used to be a queen. But now I'm a shadow of me. I deserve more but love is a chore. And wanting you has made me so weak. Don't leave me no more. Every time you walk out the door. I don't know if you're gonna come back around here anymore. Don't leave me no more. Every time you walk out the door. I don't know if you're gonna come back to me here anymore. Don't leave. Don't leave. I'm such a fool for you. And you keep playing and playing around. Until the sun comes down and rises again in the morning. And my heart keeps breaking and breaking. And I'm tired of wasting and wasting away for a cure. Don't leave me no more. Every time you walk out the door. I don't know if you're gonna come back around here anymore. Don't leave me no more. Every time you walk out the door. I don't know if you're gonna come back to me here anymore. Don't leave. Don't leave. My heart keeps breaking and breaking and breaking down. You keep playing and playing and playing around

explode,"Peso... Joga... Ginga... Roda. Vera's face burnt as a memory of bedroom fun. With a ligther and some hairspray. Smoking in the girls' room. Not worse than Shelley's rape behind the Mcdonald's. By a man she thought was fine, didn't tell anybody. Maybe back then we just thought that she was getting some. Now we look back and see that she didn't know how. We never thought that we'd get caught up. Stuck in the teenage waste. As we explode. As we explode. Then getting drunk in the bushes by the road. Outside the Kmart rolling around in them to see. If you would get prickled, slip the acid on your tongue. Rooftop mall parkade, we couldn't get enough. Then count the stars and the ten million woes. Just you and the universe judging each other. We never knew that we'd get caught up. Stuck in the teenage waste. As we explode. As we explode. As we explode. As we let go. Peso... Roda... Ginga... Joga. It's a fight, it's a fight and you finally belong. Got a shiner now and it's more than a battle scar. More than a battle scar, such a good, good story to tell. At lunch break, lunch break, lunch break, lunch break. Such a good, good story to tell. You bully, you break, you bully, you break. You fake, you fake, you fake, you fake. You smoke, you toke, you want, you flaunt. You hit it and you're in it and it's spinning. And it's wild. We never thought that we'd get caught up. Stuck in the teenage waste. As we explode. As we explode. As we explode. As we let go. We're counting the stars. We're counting the stars. We're gonna go far, we're gonna go far. We're counting the stars. We're counting the stars. We're not very far, we're not very far. And it's you and me in the open air. It's truth or dare, we don't care. We're counting the stars. We're counting the stars. We're counting the stars. We're counting the stars"

getaway,"(Intro). Ah what you say boy?. Nelly. Stack$. (Bridge). Oh yea, oh yea. Oh yea, oh yea. Oh yea, oh yea. Oh yea. (Verse). It's all good, I don't even miss you anymore and. It's all good, I don't wish it was you at my door and. It's our love, maybe we can't even stay friends. It's our love, if it's gotta end it's gotta end. (Verse). They say trouble never had a face. So you don't know what love is til it's took away. Crazy things that you in or ain't you can't escape. Think about the money made and it ain't shit. My playing days coming early and I change quick. Honey we could fly away in my spaceship. Goodbye fly, gladiator style Russell. Mel Gibson tussles. Love the way you always lie, love how I don't trust you. She tell me love is like a prison, wish you wanna run. Hold yo breath 'cus the drama always makes it fun. What a time, blow yo mind, I can set you off. Pull you by the arm, tell me what went wrong. (Pre-Chorus). I wanna get away (Why? Why?). Thinkin of us, baby (Why? Why?). And I be going crazy for the longest time (Why? Why?). I wanna getaway (Why? Why?). Thinkin I was sinkin (Why? Why?). And now we're sinkin deep, couldn't even tell me why. (Why? Why?). (Chorus). I need water, I'm so thirsty. And you're freakin me out, the way you going about. And won't you please let me out of here. (please let me out of here). Our love is jah it's lost a vibe length. I haven't got time to get to the other side. Of this desert we ride so... bye bye. (Verse). It's all good, I used to be inspired. But now I'm feelin tired, I've gotta say. It's all good, there was an emptiness but. 'Cus when you went of it I felt somewhere else. (Pre-Chorus). I wanna get away (Why? Why?). Thinkin of us, baby (Why? Why?). And I be going crazy for the longest time (Why? Why?). I wanna getaway (Why? Why?). Thinkin I was sinkin (Why? Why?). And now we're sinkin deep, couldn't even tell me why. (Why? Why?). (Chorus). I need water, I'm so thirsty. And you're freakin me out, the way you going about. And won't you please let me out of here. (please let me out of here). Our love is jah it's lost a vibe length. I haven't got time to get to the other side. Of this desert we ride so... bye bye. (Verse). I'm shuttin my door down. Want you no more. All the G's that I had just fell to the floor now. Once as the chariots go pick up the pieces. Even if you were a prince or king o even Jesus. I'm married to myself right now baby. The keys are in the engine, I'mma give this. Another driver now but it's over now. If you said you argue wise you'll wanna have to tell yo lies. That was true - all of those times. I said I'll love you til I die but time is time. We're far belong, our love was fire but now I'm strong. (Verse). So when you want it, you want it. When you want it, I get it. All that hootin and hollering, it ain't making a difference. Psychedelic embellish but maybe prison my sentence. I try explain this, I'm famous to groupies pry on my bidness. Never been copasetic when you travellin promotin records. And we fight Skype. Yikes, she say she pregnant. And it's all bad, shit was good a week ago. Performin at Summer Jam, how'd I leave er at the show?. I thought I fuckin told yall, this ain't a wannabe song. Might fly a little in the cold, or really like 3 story. 365 ways to get to yo heart. Yo lovin is strainin, it may be best if we part. Done. (Bridge). Oh yea, oh yea. Oh yea, oh yea. Oh yea, oh yea. Oh yea. (Pre-Chorus). I wanna get away (Why? Why?). Thinkin of us, baby (Why? Why?). And I be going crazy for the longest time (Why? Why?). I wanna getaway (Why? Why?). Thinkin I was sinkin (Why? Why?). And now we're sinkin deep, couldn't even tell me why. (Why? Why?). (Chorus 2). I got nothing left to say to you. I got nothing left to do it. No, you cannot seem to do this. We just gotta go and do this. Nothing, nothing left to say to you. I got nothing left to do it. I got no time for you, I'll spend it. Now all this love for you has ended. I did it all"

Hey, man, we look at each other with ample eyes,. And why not some time to discover what's behind your eyes?. And I've got so many questions that I want to ask you.. I am so tired of mirrors- pour me a glass of your wine!. And there's a shadow in the sky and it looks like rain,. And shit is gonna fly once again!. I've got a bunch of government cheques at my door.. Each morning I send them back but they only send me more.. I look at myself in the mirror; am I vital today?. Hey, man, I let my conscience get in the way!. And there's a shadow in the sky , but it looks like rain,. And shit is gonna fly once again,. And I don't mean to rain on your parade,. But pathos has got me once again.... And I don't want ambivalence. No I don't want ambivelence no more. No I don't want ambivelence no more. I said I don't want ambivalence,. No I don't want ambivalence no more!"

And my over capacitated bank account. Money is all I think about. Of my life it's a highlight. Tired of being low I'm ready for the high life. Look at me now. Look at how I get down. Stubs and Wooten on my feet. I'm the flyest youngin in town. But I'm loosin it. My vision has just become an illusion. And Now my highlife is low again. Struggling to hold it in I was on a mission. And messed everything up making all the wrong decisions. I know it's not the end Well then again it might be. And it's sucks god forbid you ever end up like me. And now I'm singing like.

Shaky shaky steps in the middle of the day. A fire in my path and a cool decay. Of limbs and tooth under my skin. Oh, freedom, where do I begin?. I'm changing my inflection and how I say the words. Maybe it will sound like something they've never heard. Oh, death of the party. I picked up the chalice of malice. And drank till I was full, I drank till I was full. I was thirsty but I drank till I was full,. I drank till I, till I,till I was full. . There's a fever in my bones that I know so well. I keep my head low low low to avoid the swell. But it'll be cold in hell, it'll be cold in hell. Before they put me in that chamber. So I'm cleaning up as fast as I can. I'm cleaning up as fast as I can.

Like a phoenix. Rising from the ashes. Like a phoenix. Rising from the flame. You're gonna be alright. You're gonna be alright. You're gonna be alright again. Oh, brother. Your hands are tired. You've been holding the world up. And you're losing your grip. If you knew now what you knew then. Then maybe you'd be whole again. But everyone falls down. But, like a phoenix. Rising from the ashes. Like a phoenix. Rising from the pain. You're gonna be alright. You're gonna be alright. You're gonna be alright again. You build a castle in the clouds. Mind the fire burning down. But you're still standing anyway. When all you needed from the start. Was waiting there inside your heart to be born again. Like a phoenix. Like a phoenix. You're gonna be alright. You're gonna be alright. You're gonna be alright again, alright again. You're gonna be alright. You're gonna be alright. You're gonna be alright again"
picture perfect,"Picture perfect a life that you saw in a magazine. Or maybe a travelling book. Wanted to get on that plane and fly away. Cause you are a rock star deep down inside. You walk with a swagger, got nothin´ to hide. Cigarette in your mouth, a cuff on your jeans. Your sideburns are perfect, you're a perfect and lean. So you made an oil painting to inmortalise. All of the hope and vision in your eyes. In your leisure coat and cowboy hat. North american records and so much to bat for. Please bring me along. Please bring me along. Because I want to see everything you have to offer me. Get a job lifting cement. Oh it's so dry when it rains it gets wet. And the village was great, now it's a suburb. You left behind half of all that you had learnt. Relearn a couple of things along the way. The thrift shop so clean all for half what you'd pay. So you try everything on, on for size. Drop top your Camaro and go for a ride. Please bring me along. Please bring me along. Because i want to see everything you have to offer me. And I don't mind to sit here and waste my time. Oh but this world is not mine to define. And I want to shine. Please bring me along. Please take me away. I don't want to stay. And I want to see everything you have to offer me. And I want to see everything you have to offer me. And I want to see everything you have to offer me. I want to see everything the world has to offer me. I want to see everything the world has to offer me. I want to show everything i have to offer it. I want to show everything i have to offer it now"

Wanna be the one to spin the wheel. I know that we can only give. When we have hope. But I don't wanna live. Without any goals. Can't protect me from nothing. Can't save me from the truth. You can't even save me from you. So don't sell me no pipe dreams. I wanna feel the good and bad in everything. Even when it hurts, even when it hurts. I know that we can only give. When we got a little hope. But I don't like the burden. Of living with these ghosts. Yes I will hold my head high. When I walk in your parade. But I will always check my gait. I will always watch my gait. Pipe dreams. Pipe dreams. Pipe dreams. Pipe dreams. If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on. If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on.

red balloons,"There's a string wrapped aroung my finger. It's getting tighter everyday. And it just goes on forever. It's wrapped around every word you said. It's like a memory. A shoebox in my mind. It's calling out to me to open up and look inside. It makes me believe in all we could have been. But all the things we were. It's just me imagining. Take these red balloons and watch them fly away. I'm untying my heart and letting go today. Time has come for me to see the truth. And walk up to the edge and let go all these red balloons. There's a shadow when I walk forward. And it keeps trying to hold me back. I can cry at the strangest moments. Reminding me of what I can't have. Don't wanna believe in all we could have been. Cause I'm so tired of everything I'm imaging. Take these red balloons and watch them fly away. I'm untying my heart and letting go today. Time has come for me to see the truth. And walk up to the edge and let go all these red balloons. The child in me wants to run. And collect every single balloon and never forget. The child in me wants to live in a dream of carousels. And wish me well. Take these red balloons and watch them fly away. I'm untying my heart and letting go today. Cause every single dream of the past. Does nothing for me or hold me back. Time has come for me to see the truth. I walked up to the edge and let go all these red balloons. Red balloons, Red balloons, Red balloons. Yes they've flown away. The tears are in my eyes. I said goodbye"

sacrifice (ft. the roots),"Listen, I got you phobic off of this like arachnids. Drastic, it ain't plastic it's Pro-Blackness. Grown man tactics, no pediatrics. the kind of track that make the comeback miraculous. the catalyst, Thought with the knack for splashin'. I'm dashin' I mastered the craft of mashin'. The level-headed throughbred, the female's passion. Mag-netic attraction be keepin' them askin'. The crews in the Cadillacs with the Pendergrassin'. Swerve half-naked, won't come near crashin'. But if I go to heaven, would y'all know my name. or would it be the same for you like I was Eric Clapton, huh?. Clap for you freedom dog, that's what's happening. My spit take critical political action. The hustle is a puzzle each piece is a fraction. And every word that's understood is a transaction. I'm an S.P. soldier, microphone holder. Rep Philly set from Bolivia to Boulder. Paris, France to Tip and Tioga. How we gonna make it through the dark, I show ya. [Chorus]. I tell you one lesson I learned. If you want to be something in life. You ain't gonna get it unless. You give a little bit of sacrifice. Ooohh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry. You need a heart that's filled with music. If you use it you can fly. If you want to be high. Listen, yo kick off your shoes, jump off the jock. I fly higher than them dudes, from off your block. My name Black, the style is unorthodox. It tap chins in your mens 'til you thought could box. A couple of people wanted Thought to stop, but guess what?. My man grab the missile, plug for the gut. Now next time beatty stop being such a glut. I'm precise with it like Faheim with haircuts. We up close on 'em with toast but no crust. It's fructose on 'em they froze and won't bust. Choke on your face you jewels is lacklust. Got to put it to you straight, y'all fools is jacked up. Came close to the upmost but no cigar. Nose to the grindstone, head to the stars. The number one runner with the number one drummer. Grammy award winnin' it's the world's eighth wonder. Come on. I tell you one lesson I learned. If you want to be something in life. You ain't gonna get it unless. You give a little bit of sacrifice. Ooohh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry. You need a heart that's filled with music. If you use it you can fly. If you want to be high. Your first impression might be I'm a asshole. Or say I'm sometimey and give people a hassle. Or try to suntouch and put the heat in the capsule. Dog I'm far deeper than that though; I get in the zone. Recognize I'm a rolling stone. No time to lollygag or lounge with scaliwags. Give me the disc or I put it where your body at. Old school spit flow laid over Trotter tracks. With no apology fraud or trick-knowledgy. Just trust, what I see and I say and follow me my way. I read an open booklet inside me. The star of the story that groove teller got me. Through all the dark times part of the business. The light be contingent on small forensics. My microphone'll make a man a newborn infant. It's true so the crew gon' sense it. I get in the zone. I tell you one lesson I learned. If you want to be something in life. You ain't gonna get it unless. You give a little bit of sacrifice. Ooohh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry. You need a heart that's filled with music. If you use it you can fly. If you want to be high. I tell you one lesson I learned. If you want to be something in life. You ain't gonna get it unless. You give a little bit of sacrifice. Ooohh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry. You need a heart that's filled with music.

Ooohh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry. You need a heart that's filled with music. If you use it you can fly. If you want to be high. The fact of the matter is a matter of fact...."

stars,There are so many stars in the sky tonight. Which one will I take in my hand?. There are so many ways I can live my life. Which one will I make part of my plan?. There are so many spirits in the air tonight. Trying to pull me away. You're a part of me. You're in every breath that I breathe. And every step forward that I take. And then I take a step backwards. If I don't see your face. You're a part of me. You're in every song that I sing. And every bird that sings to me. This is what I dream. To be real. This is my reality. There are so many songs on the people's faces. Everyone could be yours but they're not. And all is lost if I count the truth. To my own heart. You're a part of me.

te busqué (versão bilíngue),I've been high I've been low. I've been fast I've been slow. I've had nowhere to go. Missed the bus missed the show. I've been down on my luck. I've felt like giving up. My life locked in a trunk. When it hurt way too much. I needed a reason to live. Some love inside me to give. I couldn't rest I had to keep on searching. (CHORUS). Te busqué de bajo de las piedras y no te encontré. En la manana fria y en la noche te busqué. Hasta enloquecer. Pero tu llegaste a mi vida como una luz. Sanando las heridas de mi corazón. Haciendome sentir vivo otra vez. I've been too sad to speak and too tired to eat. Been too lonely to sing the devil cut off my wings. I've been hurt by my past but I feel the future. In my dreams and it lasts I wake up I'm not sure. I wanted to find the light something just didn't feel right. I needed an answer to end all my searching. (CHORUS). I look in the mirror the picture's getting clearer. I wanna be myself but does the world really need her. I ache for this earth. I stopped going to church. See God in the trees makes me fall to my knees. My depression keeps building like a cup overfilling. My heart so rigid I keep it in the fridge. It hurts so bad that I can't dry my eyes. Cuz they keep on refillin' with the tears that I cry.... (CHORUS) x4. by juu

I'm not looking back. But I want to look around me now. Time stand still. See more of the people. And the places that surround me now. Time stand still. Freeze this moment. A little bit longer. Make each sensation. A little bit stronger. Experience slips away.... Experience slips away.... Time stand still. I turn my face to the sun. I close my eyes. I let my defenses down. All those wounds. That I can't get unwound. I let my past go too fast. No time to pause. If I could slow it all down. Like some captain,. Whose ship runs aground. I can wait until the tide comes around. Time stand still. I'm not looking back. But I want to look around me now. Time stand still. See more of the people. And the places that surround me. Now. Freeze this moment. A little bit longer. Make each sensation. A little bit stronger. Make each impression. A little bit stronger. Freeze this motion. A little bit longer. The innocence slips away.... The innocence slips away.... Time stand still. Time stand still. I'm not looking back. But I want to look around me now. See more of the people. And the places that surround me now. Time stand still. Summer's going fast. The nights growing colder. Children growing up. Old friends growing older. Freeze this moment. A little bit longer. Make each sensation. A little bit stronger. Experience slips away.... Experience slips away.... The innocence slips away..."

trynna finda way,"I left my heart in San Francisco with some club kids. On a crowded street somewhere. The sky was red and he said,. ""Would you like to come be a part of my North American Dream?"". I could try to chase life down. Down the street and I'd find. The separation of fact and. Fiction. I'm tryin' a find a way. I'm tryin' a find a right. And if I budge I just might. I'm tryin' a find a way. I'm tryin' a find a right. And if I budge I just might. I left my conscience somewhere with my rhythm. I heard about it from the mouth of a man. He was hopping some trains and combing the land. Looking for a lover planted in the east. Trying to run from the dreaded fist beast. And it lies, it lies. In the picket fence call. It was my own paradise with. My own private corridor. I'm tryin' a find a way. I'm tryin' a find a right. And if I budge I just might. I'm tryin' a find a way. I'm tryin' a find a right. And if I budge I just might. So I'm dancing to a new beat and it came to me in bed. My veins became a strain of light that I let to flow instead. And a wish came to me like Peter Pan at my window and said. ""Evolve your destiny child and you'll never walk alone, no.. You'll never walk alone,"" but. Travel to the land of surrender. Till' you can't cry no more. Till you can't, till you can't. And you'll never walk alone. All this inspiration is passing me by. All I can do is chill when I really wanna fly. And this pollution do nothing but dirty up my mind. Faster than forever in the blink of an eye. To see past my lethargy is hard I feign. The beauty of my youth is gone. But the chemicals remain. I'm tryin' a find a way. I'm tryin' a find a right. And if I budge I just might. I'm tryin' a find a way. I'm tryin' a find a right. And if I budge I just might. I'm tryin' a find a way. I'm tryin' a find a right. And if I budge I just might. I travel to this land of surrender but I see it's all over me,. Over and over. again...and I try and I try and I try.... An angel on my left side and a devil on my right... And they fight and they fight and they fight..they're fighting,. They're fighting, they're fighting for my attention...hello?. You have my attention...Do I have your attention.... Can I have your attention please?...please,. You've made such such an impression on me"

All the love it's all that we need. Breathing it out. Breathing it in. No one knows where it all ends and. Where it begins, where it begins. Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. (Chorus:). Look around. Can't you feel?. All the love is all that you need. Breathing it out. Breathing it in. No one knows where it all ends. Look around. Can't you feel?. All the love is all that you need. Breathing it out. Breathing it in. No one knows where it all ends and. Where it begins, where it begins. Crédito: Ivna Cardoso"

Til the sun comes up till the sun comes up. Don't take me home. Til the sun comes up till the sun comes up. Don't take me home. Til the sun comes up till the sun comes up. Right next to me. You wanna be. Till the sun comes up. [Verse 2:]. I am going nowhere in a hurry. Baby come take away all my worries. But with that moon in the sky. Who wants to be alone. And when the stars shine so bright. Who wants to be alone. Don't take me home. Til the sun comes up till the sun comes up. Don't take me home. Til the sun comes up till the sun comes up. Don't take me home. Til the sun comes up till the sun comes up. Don't take
