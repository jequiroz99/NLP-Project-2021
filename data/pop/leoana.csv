I wanna feel like you've let me go. So let me go. Don't you remember how I used to like. Being on the line?. I dreamed you dreamed of me calling out my name. Is it worth the price?. Cut cover, take that test. Hold courage to your chest. Don't wanna wait for you. Don't wanna have to lose. All that I compromised. To feel another high. I've got to keep it down tonight. And oh, oh, oh. I was a king under your control. And oh, oh, oh. I wanna feel like you've let me go. I had to break myself to carry on. No love and no admission. Take this from me tonight. Oh, oh let's fight. Oh, oh, oh let's fight. Oh, oh let's fight. Oh, oh oh. And oh, oh, oh. I was a king under your control. And oh, oh, oh. I wanna feel like you've let me go. So let me go.

Need some self control. And deep down, I know this never works. But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt. Oh, won't you stay with me?. 'Cause you're all I need. This ain't love, it's clear to see. But darling, stay with me. Oh, won't you stay with me?. 'Cause you're all I need. This ain't love, it's clear to see. But darling, stay with me"
