i try (but i can't),"It was a beautiful story. A lot of dreams kisses all beautiful moments. But it was difficult for you to say I love you. Even though you said you try to do everything on. silence. What people said. Was most important for you and you run away. And my heart is broken. Because you left me despite what you felt. And now I am so confused memories. That came but in my life I want to escape. I just want to cry my tears. Because the only thing I know for this. But I, I try to forget all. Why I can't, I can't to forget all. If you are not here. Some days I fell so depress. To remember that now you are just my friend. Because you close and put a cross in this story. Don't you remember you decided. What people said. Was most important for you and you run away. And my heart is broken. Because you left me despite what you felt. And now I am so confused memories. That came but in my life I want to escape. I just want to cry my tears. Because the only thing I know for this. But I, I try to forget all. Why I can't, I can't to forget all. I want you speaking in front of me. Explain me all the things that you don't. Even believe. Because you run away with your proud. And now I am so confused memories. That came but in my life I want to escape. I just want to cry my tears. Because the only thing I know for this. But I, I try to forget all. Why I can't, I can't to forget all. If you are not here"
