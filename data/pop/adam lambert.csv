My heart is a ghost town. Died last night in my dreams. All the machines. Had been disconnected. Time was thrown at the wind. And all of my friends. Had been disaffected. Now I'm searching for trust. In a city of rust. A city of vampires. Tonight Elvis is dead. And everyone's spread. And love is a satire. And now I know my heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. There's no one left in the world. I'm gunslingin'. Don't give a damn if I go. Down down down. I got a voice in my head that keeps singin'. Oh. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. Oh, my heart is a ghost town. (Said, my heart). My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town"
