king of the free ride,"I see the world go round. You know the wind is friend of mine. I hear the sea out loud. And I can't get you out of my mind. Spend my life in the air. The waves know I'm there. The wings of passions fly me. Because I'm free, free when I ride. Pico Alto, Ekua. Uluwatu, Pipeline. Jhquehy, Number Three's. Joaquina, Waikiki. The weather soon is gonna change. The water is getting colder. And when the tide is lower. My kingdom will be over. Santa Marta, Serrambi. Stella Maris, Maverick's. Coco Loco, Lacanau. Lopes Mendes, Francês, Jeffrey's Bay. Itaúna, Mentawai. Waimea, Sunset. Rosa Norte, Rock Point. Árpex, Árpex"
smoke on the water,"We all came out to Montreux. On the Lake Geneva shoreline. To make records with a mobile. We didn't have much time. Frank Zappa and the Mothers. Were at the best place around. But some stupid with a flare gun. Burned the place to the ground. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. They burned down the gambling house. It died with an awful sound. Funky Claude was running in and out. Pulling kids out the ground. When it all was over. We had to find another place. But Swiss time was running out. It seemed that we would lose the race. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky"
someday,Are we lovers out of moon. Are we singing out of tune. If I'm not good enough for you. Let this distance grow between us. I can't stay forever. Ok. We can get together. Someday. On the other side of the way. Could I take your hesitation. Could I show you my regret. Someone help me to forget. This big egg inside my head. I can't say forever. Ok. Let's ride a wave together. Someday. On the other side.... What is.... This thing.... Called us....
tempted,"I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste. a flannel for my face. pyjamas, a hair brush. new shoes and a case. i said to my reflection. let's get out of this place. past the church and the steeple. the laundry on the hill. billboards and the buildings. memories of it still keep calling. and calling. but forget it all. i know i will. tempted by the fruit of another. tempted but the truth is discovered. what's been going on. now that you have gone. there's no other. tempted by the fruit of another. tempted but the truth is discovered. i'm at the car park, the airport. the baggage caroussel. the people keep on crowding. i'm wishing i was well. i said there´s no ocasion there's. no estory i could tell. at my bedside empty pocket. a foot without a sock. and your body gets much closer. i flumbed for the clock. alarmed by the seduction. i wish that it would stop. tempted by the fruit of another. tempted but the truth is discovered. what's been going on. now that you have gone. there's no other. tempted by the fruit of another. tempted but the truth is discovered. i bought a novel, some perfume. a fortune all for you. but it's not my concious. that's hates to be untrue. i ask to my reflection. tell me what is there to do. by:Thaís"
