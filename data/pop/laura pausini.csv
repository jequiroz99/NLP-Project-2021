all at once,"All at once,. I finally took a moment and I'm realizing that. You're not coming back. And it finally hit me. All at once. All at once. I started counting teardrops and at least a million fell. My eyes began to swell. And all my dreams were shattered. All at once. Ever since I met you. You're the only love I've known. And I can't forget you. So I must face it all alone. All at once. I'm drifting on a lonely sea. Wishing you'd come back to me. And that's all that matters now. All at once. I'm drifting on a lonely sea. Holding on to memories. And it hurts me more than you know. So much more than it shows. All at once. All at once,. I looked around and found that you were with another love. In someone else's arms. And all my dreams were shattered. All at once. All at once. The smile that used to greet me brightened someone else's day. She took your smile away. And left me with just memories. All at once. Ever since I met you. You're the only love I've known. And I can't forget you. So I must face it all alone. All at once. I'm drifting on a lonely sea. Wishing you'd come back to me. And that's all that matters now. All at once.

do i dare,"Even now when I see you. I start to relieve you. Don't know how. I could ever begin to forgive you. I never thought about it. I learned to live without it. But nothing seem to feel the same. If I should try again and you should lie again. Don't know if I could stand the pain. Do I dare?. Let you in once again and surrender. Should I care?. Should I trust when my heart still remember?. How you lied how I cried. Now I see you wanna make it, try!. So I ask won't you hear my prayer?. Do I love you? Do I trust you?. Do I dare?. Oh Yeah. Tell me why did you play such a game at September?. Pretty lies. Were you real?. Were you just to pretend?. When I ain't back again. Saying it that was then. How are you gonna change your way?. I don't know what to do. Cause I am still feeling you. But will the story end the same?. Do I dare?. Let you in once again and surrender. Let you back in my life. Should I care?. Should I trust when my heart still remember?. And it cuts like a knife. How you lied how I cried. Now I say you wanna make it, try!. So I ask you to hear my prayer?. Do I love you? Do I trust you?. Do I dare?. Oh yeah. I never thought about it. I learned to live without it. But now sometimes I feel just like I am gonna die without it. I don't know what to do. Cause I am still feeling you. And I am still afraid that you'd break my heart in two. Don't know if I could stand the pain. But will the story end the same. Do I dare? Do I trust? Do I dare?. Let you in once again and surrender. Should I care?. Should I trust when my heart still remember?. When my heart still remember. How you lied how I cried. Now I see you wanna make it, try!. So I ask won't you to hear my prayer. Do I love? Do I trust? Do I dare?. I never thought about it. I learned to live without it. But now sometimes I feel just like I am gonna die without it. I don't know what to do.

every little thing you do,When you listen to my heart. Oh I like it. When you touch me. I get so excited. And I never thought that I would say. I'm upon away and so into. Every little thing you do. When you look at me that way. Oh it moves me. When you take my hand the love goes right through me. And the reason that it feels so good. Is because you put your heart into. Every little thing you do. You're the rhythm in my song. You're the switch that turns me on. The only place where I belong or want to be. You're the half that makes me whole. The only one who seizes my soul. Baby it's so real but still I can't believe. Every little thing that you do to me. When you take my hands. I like it. Oh I Like it. When you listen to my heart. Oh I like it. I like it. Even in the night when you're not here with me. My sweetest dreams still take me to. Every little thing you do. You're the rhythm in my song. You're the switch that turns me on. The only place where I belong and or want to be. You're the heaven that makes me hope. The only one who seizes my soul. Baby it's so real but still I can't believe. You're the rhythm in my song. You're the switch that turns me on. The only place where I belong and want to be with you. You're the heaven that makes me hope. The only one who seizes my soul. Baby it's so real but still I can't believe. Every little thing you do to me. I Like it. I like it. Every little thing. I like it.
everyday is a monday,"Feels like I´ve been frozen in time. And I´m looking for an easy way. To get on with my life. But I know, you´re the one to tell. I´ve been putting on a masquerade. I ain´t doing that well. Everything has crashed. And I´m losing this game. Can´t help myself but wonder. Do you feel the same?. How could I ever say goodbye. Everyday is a Monday. Without you by my side. I must have been a fool to try. Everyday is a Monday. Without you in my life. Tell me, it´s a big mistake. ´Cause I kinda I learned my lesson. More than I can take. Freedom, had a price to pay. I don´t want to be the one. To throw it all away. Everything has crashed. And I´m losing this game. Can´t help myself but wonder. Do you feel the same?. (Chorus). We were the weekend always living to be free. Now I´m stuck here on Monday, when I need you every day of the week. Everything has crashed. And I´m losing this game. Can´t help myself but wonder. Do you feel the same?. (Chorus)"

heal the world (feat. tiziano ferro),"There's a place in your heart. And I know that it is love. And this place could be much. Brighter than tomorrow. And if you really try. You'll find there's no need to cry. In this place you'll feel. There's no hurt or sorrow. There are ways to get there. If you care enough for the living. Make a little space. Make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place. For you and for me. And the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living. Make it a better place. For you and for me. If you want to know why. There's love that cannot lie. Love is strong. It only cares of joyful giving. If we try we shall see. In this bliss we cannot feel. Fear od dread. We stop existing and start living. The it feels that always. Love's enough for us growing. So make a better world. Make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place. For you and for me. And the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living. Make a better place for you and for me. And the dream we were conceived in. Will reveal a joyful face. And the world we once believed in. Will shine again in grace. Then why do we keep strangling life. Wound this earth, crucify its soul. Though it's plain to see. This world is heavenly. Be god's glow. We could fly so high. Let our spirits never die. In my heart I feel you are all my brothers. Create a world with no fear. Together we cry happy tears. See the nations turn their swords into plowshares. We could really get there. If you cared enough for the living. Make a little space. To make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place. For you and for me. And the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living. Make a better place for you and for me. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living. Make a better place for you and for me. You and for me"

i need love,"I'd cross the desert to be where you are. All the things I'd do to be close to you. A million miles wouldn´t seem that far. I'd go anywhere just to win your heart. But wherever this leads. There's something I need. I need love. The kind that makes you wanna live. The kind that makes you wanna breathe. The kind that makes you feel too much. And I need you. To help me find a better way. And I guess you never thought you'd hear me say. I need love. I need love. And when I see you I just lose my mind. You're the everything I thought I'd never find. Must be an angel watching over me. With a little luck we're gonna make you mine. 'Cause I wanna believe (I want to believe). In all we can be (all we can be). I need love. The kind that makes you wanna live. The kind that makes you wanna breathe. The kind that makes you feel too much. And I need you. To help me find a better way. And I guess you never thought you'd hear me say. I need love. I need love. And oh, I will catch you when you fall. Be the greatest love of all. I promise to be. If you give me what I need, I need. I need love. I need you. The kind that makes me feel. The one that makes you wanna live. The one that makes you wanna breathe. And I need you. To help me find a better way. And I guess you never throught you'd hear me say. I need love. I need love. I need love, baby. I need love. I'd cross the desert. I'd cross the desert to be where you are"
if that's love,"If you're gonna break my heart and leave. Make promises you don't intend to keep. If that's love then I want no part. But if you think that love sure last for life. If you believe it's more than just one night. If that's love then you've got my heart. If you rather hold on to your pride. And wipe away the tears you make me cry. If that's love then I want no part. But if you're gonna be there when I need. Someone to just hold me tenderly. If that's love then you've got my heart. If the kind of love that you bring. Comes with no demands and no strings. If in your eyes I see for sure. That you're the one I'm waiting for. I'll give my heart, my soul, my everything. If I have to let go out my dreams. Because someone I never never thought I'd be. If that's love I want, I want no part. But if you're gonna be that kind of man. Who's waiting just to take me as I am. If that's love then you've got my heart. Tell me in your arms I'll be safe, baby tell me. Loneliness I'm fear in all place. The only thing you have to do. The only thing I ask could be you. Is give your heart, your soul and your faith. And if you can't give those things to me. Then hard I just have to tell you honestly. If that's love I want no part. But if you say you finally found in me. The only place that you could ever be. If that's love you've got my heart. If that's love baby you've got my heart. If that's love. If that's love. If that's love baby you've, baby you. You got my heart."
imagine,Imagine there's no heaven. It's easy if you try. No hell below us. Above us only sky. Imagine all the people. Living for today. Imagine there's no countries. It isn't hard to do. Nothing to kill or die for. And no religion too. Imagine all the people. Living life in peace. You may say. I'm a dreamer. But I'm not the only one. I hope some day. You'll join us. And the world will be as one. Imagine no possessions. I wonder if you can. No need for greed or hunger. A brotherhood of man. Imagine all the people. Sharing all the world. You may say. I'm a dreamer. But I'm not the only one. I hope some day. You'll join us. And the world will be as one
it's beginning to look a lot like christmas,It's beginning to look a lot like christmas. Everywhere you go. Take a look in the five-and-ten. Glistening once again. With candy canes and silver lanes aglow. It's beginning to look a lot like christmas. Toys in every store. But the prettiest sight to see. Is the holly that will be. On your own front door. A pair of hopalong boots. And a pistol that shoots. Is the wish of barney and ben. Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk. Is the hope of janice and jen. And mom and dad can hardly wait. For school to start again. It's beginning to look a lot like christmas. Everywhere you go. There's a tree in the grand hotel. One in the park as well. The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow. It's beginning to look a lot like christmas. Soon the bells will start. And the thing that will make them. Ring is the carol that you sing. Right within your heart. It's beginning to look a lot like christmas. Toys in every store. But the prettiest sight to see. Is the holly that will be. On your own front door. So it's christmas once more
it's not goodbye,Now what if I never kiss your lips again. Or feel the touch of your sweet embrace. How would I ever go on?. Without you there's no place to belong. Well someday love is going to lead you back to me. But till it does I'll have an empty heart. So I'll just have to believe. Somewhere out there you're thinking of me. Till the day I'll let you go. Till we say our next hello its not goodbye. Till I see you again. I'll be right here remembering when. And if time is on our side. There will be no tears to cry on down the road. There is one thing I can't deny. It's not goodbye. You think I'd be strong enough to make it trough. And rise above when the rain falls down. But it's so hard to be strong. When you've been missing somebody so long. Its just a matter of time I'm sure. But time takes time and I can't hold on. So wont you try as hard as you can. Put my broken heart together again?. Till the day I'll let you go. Untill we say our next hello it's not goodbye. Till I see you again. I'll be right here remembering when. And if time is on our side. There will be no tears to cry on down the road. There is one thing I can't deny. It's not goodbye. EEhh. It's not goodbye. Till the day I'll let you go. Untill we say our next hello its not goodbye. Till I see you again. I'll be right here remembering when. And if time is on our side. There will be no tears to cry on down the road. There is one thing I can't deny. It's not goodbye. It's not goodbye. Till I see you. I'll be right here rememebering when. Time is on our side. No more tears to cry. And I can't deny. It's not goodbye. No more tears to cry. It's not goodbye

looking for an angel,Well I'm looking for an angel. Someone to watch over me. Someone to lean on my shoulder. I wanna feel how love can be. But these things they don't come easy.

love comes from the inside,Looking for my self control. In the world that got no soul. When will I come home?. Some say I'm a rolling stone. wearing someone else's clothes. When will I go home.

Do you believe that love comes from the inside?. Got to believe this time that love comes from the inside. Looking for a friend of mine. Trying to find some piece of mind. Happiness is hard to find. As I've been looking for love. You know the wrong faces. Hanging around in too many places. When will I come home?. Cloudy and murky is my vision. When I am looking for the answer. I am running out of time. Stand up and show me you'll deliver. Would you help clear my conscience. Coz I wanna taste the wine. Do you believe that love comes from the inside?. Got to believe this time that love comes from the inside. Cloudy and murky is my vision. When I am looking for the answer. I am running out of time. Stand up and show me you'll deliver.

one more time,Nothing I must do. Nowhere I should be. No one in my life. To answer to but me. No more candlelight. No more purple skies. No one to be near. As my heart slowly dies. If I could hold you one more time. like in the days when you were mine. I'd look at you 'till I was blind. So you would stay. I'd say a prayer each time you'd smile. Cradle the moments like a child. I'd stop the world if only I. Could hold you one more time. (hmmmmmm). I've memorized your face. I know your touch by heart. Still lost in your embrace. I'd dream of where you are. (hmmm). If I could hold you one more time. Like in the days when you were mine. I'd look at you 'till I was blind. So you would stay. I'd say a prayer each time you'd smile. Cradle the moments like a child.

radiant (feat. kylie minogue),"Maybe. Maybe I was slow to see that change was coming. Maybe I just wouldn't change our life. Now I'm left with something that is fixed. And that it's what you mean to me. It's just that, at night. When I've fallen asleep, you arrive. And I feel that deep within me I hide. The things that you don't know about me. Letting go, no more fighting. Time will show you what you mean to me. Letting go, free my instincts. From the darkness I will re-emerge. Radiant, radiant. And sometimes I'll be incomprehensible. But I won't be how you wanted me to be. I inevitably won't be everything. That you think. When stones rain down and it's not easy. No, to keep on balancing. And buried deep inside. Is all the love that you don't know I hold. Letting go, no more fighting. Time will show you what you mean to me. Letting go, free my instincts. From the darkness I will re-emerge. Radiant, radiant. Oh, oh, oh. Letting go, no more fighting. Time will show you what you mean to me. Letting go, free my instincts. From the darkness I will re-emerge. Radiant. (Radiant). Radiant. Radiant. Maybe we haven't been made to change. And maybe I just wouldn't change our life"

separate lives,"(Laura Pausini & Phil Collins). You called me from the room in your hotel. All full of romance for someone that you met. And telling me how sorry you were, leaving so soon. And that you miss me sometimes when you're alone in your room. Do I feel lonely too?. You have no right to ask me how I feel. You have no right to speak to me so kind. We can't go on just holding on to time. Now that we're living separate lives. Well I held on to let you go. And if you lost your love for me, well you never let it show.

the extra mile,"Countless eyes are watching. In this our finest hour. It's time to realise the dream. And who we really are. I'm gonna freeze this space and time. Rise to meet the call.

the loneliness,"I don't even know if he still thinks of me. Once he got on board that unforgiving train. I imagine that he whiled away the time. Through the cold Grey morning and the city rain. Thinking of somebody else who'll run to him. Who'll ask him ""Did you miss me maybe now and then?"". Laughing he'll say ""Well I met this funny girl,. But just a summer thing I won't see her again"". Oh God I hope I'm wrong. But I'm not feeling very strong. I've been so up and down so sad. So happy feeling good and bad. I'm young I'm old I laugh I cry. I tell the truth but that's a lie. I've been so in and out so wild. so well behaved so pure defiled. It’s only to demand. That’s why I hate to say. The night I’d. The night I’d. And no I wasn't crazy to do what we did. I even wish I'd been a bit more crazy still. And kept a little more of him to see me through. He loved me all he could I never had my fill. And then I'm back inside my room he knows so well. I feel again the way he moved I take it slow. I talk to him and he becomes a part of me. And then I know he'll never let the summer go. Oh God I hope I'm right. I won't give in without a fight. And I can take the words they throw. At me for none of them could know. That we had something very few. Will ever find their whole life through. I wouldn't change a single day. Although the price I have to pay. Is all this loneliness. An emptiness that's breaking me apart. It tears me up it pulls me down and then. It wraps around my heart. It’s only truth that makes us see. Does he remember all he said to me. I've been so up and down so sad. So happy feeling good and bad. I'm young I'm old I laugh I cry. I tell the truth but that's a lie. I've been so in and out so wild. So well behaved so pure defiled. But oh this loneliness. Does he remember all he said to me. But I can take the words they know. That we had something very few. We’ll ever find their whole life through. I wouldn't change a single day. Although the price I have to pay. Is all this loneliness…."
