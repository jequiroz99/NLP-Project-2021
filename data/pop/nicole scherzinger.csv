don't cry for me argentina,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange. When I try to explain how I feel. That I still need your love. After all that I've done. You won't believe me. All you will see is a girl you once knew. Although she's dressed up to the nines. At sixes and sevens with you. I had to let it happen, I had to change. Couldn't stay all my life down at heel. Looking out of the window. Staying out of the sun. So I chose freedom. Running around, trying everything new. But nothing impressed me at all. I never expected it to. Don't cry for me Argentina. The truth is I never left you. All through my wild days, my mad existence. I kept my promise, don't keep your distance. And as for fortune, and as for fame. I never invited them in. Though it seemed to the world. They were all I desired. They are illusions. They're not the solutions they promised to be. The answer was here all the time. I love you, and hope you love me. Don't cry for me Argentina. Don't cry for me Argentina. The truth is I never left you. All through my wild days, my mad existence. I kept my promise, don't keep your distance. Have I said too much?. There's nothing more I can think of to say to you. But all you have to do is look at me to know. That every word is true. Don't cry for me Argentina"

It took all the strength I had. but I crawled up on my feet again. Now you're trying to lure me back but. No, those days are gone, my friend. I loved you so much that I thought someday. that you could change. But all you brought me was a heart full of pain. You can't touch me now there's no feeling left.

You were always jealous over such crazy stuff. You can't touch me now there's no feeling left. If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath. What you did to me boy I can't forget. If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath. Don't hold your breath. Move on, don't look back. I jumped off a train running off the tracks. Your day is gone face the facts. A bad movie ends and the screen fades to black. What you did to me boy I can't forget. If you think I'm coming back... (don't hold your breath). You can't touch me now there's no feeling left.

See him move through smoke and mirrors. Feel his presence in the crowd. Other girls they gather around him. If I had him I wouldn't let him out. Golden eye, not lace or leather. Golden chain take him to the spot. Golden eye, I'll show him forever. It'll take forever to see what I've got. You'll never know how I watched you from the shadows as a child. You'll never know how it feels to get so close and be denied. It's a gold and honey trap I've got for you tonight. Revenge is a kiss this time I won't miss. Now I've got you in my sight.

how do you let go of the one you love?,"While you're killing time, time is killing me. Another tomorrow turns to a week. Three simple words, now bittersweet. You don't get what you you want. you get what you need. Been through the desert, and I've overcome. But I don't have the answer to this one. How do you let go of the one you love. When your heart doesn't know how to give up?. As hard as it is, I know it's best for us. I still hurt like a little girl. but all grown up. . How do you take the first step. and not look back. Cut the strings to the world attached. Wash it down when it's all you know?. How do you take the first breath. before you jump off. Give it all when it's not enough. How do you let go of the one you love?. Scared of waking up alone. Scared to find out you were wrong. Is it the fear that makes me feel so numb?. Oh, I haven't been myself for so long. Been through the desert, and I still hold on. But I don't have the answer to this one. How do you let go of the one you love. When your heart doesn't know how to give up?. As hard as it is, I know it's best for us. I still hurt like a little girl. but all grown up. [Post-Chorus]. How do you take the first step and not look back. Cut the strings to the world attached. Wash it down when it's all you know?. How do you take the first breath. before you jump off. Give it all when it's not enough. How do you let go of the one you love?. [?] say it's over?. (This is goin' nowhere). Made up my mind, and write it down. (Gotta do it now). Finally found the courage to be stronger. (Finally getting out). Then I hear your voice, I stop and turn around. Yeah, turn around, yeah. How do you let go of the one you love. When your heart doesn't know how to give up?. As hard as it is, I know it's best for us. I still hurt like a little girl. but all grown up. How do you take the first step and not look back. Cut the strings to the world attached. Wash it down when it's all you know?. How do you take the first breath. before you jump off. Give it all when it's not enough. How do you let go of the one you love?. (How do you let go of the one you love?).

We could have had it all. We could have had it all. It all, it all it all,. We could have had it all. Rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand. And you played it. To the beat.

Run, run, run. Darling I know that you're just like me. You give your love up way too fast. But once it's gone it's gone forever. And there's no coming back from that.

don't cry for me argentina,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange. When I try to explain how I feel. That I still need your love. After all that I've done. You won't believe me. All you will see is a girl you once knew. Although she's dressed up to the nines. At sixes and sevens with you. I had to let it happen, I had to change. Couldn't stay all my life down at heel. Looking out of the window. Staying out of the sun. So I chose freedom. Running around, trying everything new. But nothing impressed me at all. I never expected it to. Don't cry for me Argentina. The truth is I never left you. All through my wild days, my mad existence. I kept my promise, don't keep your distance. And as for fortune, and as for fame. I never invited them in. Though it seemed to the world. They were all I desired. They are illusions. They're not the solutions they promised to be. The answer was here all the time. I love you, and hope you love me. Don't cry for me Argentina. Don't cry for me Argentina. The truth is I never left you. All through my wild days, my mad existence. I kept my promise, don't keep your distance. Have I said too much?. There's nothing more I can think of to say to you. But all you have to do is look at me to know. That every word is true. Don't cry for me Argentina"

It took all the strength I had. but I crawled up on my feet again. Now you're trying to lure me back but. No, those days are gone, my friend. I loved you so much that I thought someday. that you could change. But all you brought me was a heart full of pain. You can't touch me now there's no feeling left.

You were always jealous over such crazy stuff. You can't touch me now there's no feeling left. If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath. What you did to me boy I can't forget. If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath. Don't hold your breath. Move on, don't look back. I jumped off a train running off the tracks. Your day is gone face the facts. A bad movie ends and the screen fades to black. What you did to me boy I can't forget. If you think I'm coming back... (don't hold your breath). You can't touch me now there's no feeling left.

how do you let go of the one you love?,"While you're killing time, time is killing me. Another tomorrow turns to a week. Three simple words, now bittersweet. You don't get what you you want. you get what you need. Been through the desert, and I've overcome. But I don't have the answer to this one. How do you let go of the one you love. When your heart doesn't know how to give up?. As hard as it is, I know it's best for us. I still hurt like a little girl. but all grown up. . How do you take the first step. and not look back. Cut the strings to the world attached. Wash it down when it's all you know?. How do you take the first breath. before you jump off. Give it all when it's not enough. How do you let go of the one you love?. Scared of waking up alone. Scared to find out you were wrong. Is it the fear that makes me feel so numb?. Oh, I haven't been myself for so long. Been through the desert, and I still hold on. But I don't have the answer to this one. How do you let go of the one you love. When your heart doesn't know how to give up?. As hard as it is, I know it's best for us. I still hurt like a little girl. but all grown up. [Post-Chorus]. How do you take the first step and not look back. Cut the strings to the world attached. Wash it down when it's all you know?. How do you take the first breath. before you jump off. Give it all when it's not enough. How do you let go of the one you love?. [?] say it's over?. (This is goin' nowhere). Made up my mind, and write it down. (Gotta do it now). Finally found the courage to be stronger. (Finally getting out). Then I hear your voice, I stop and turn around. Yeah, turn around, yeah. How do you let go of the one you love. When your heart doesn't know how to give up?. As hard as it is, I know it's best for us. I still hurt like a little girl. but all grown up. How do you take the first step and not look back. Cut the strings to the world attached. Wash it down when it's all you know?. How do you take the first breath. before you jump off. Give it all when it's not enough. How do you let go of the one you love?. (How do you let go of the one you love?).

zoo,"We step up, the club is flooded. All of a sudden, it's a herd. Chickens be talkin', I keep walkin'. They just a flock of birds. Playas and gators, gorillas holdin' up the wall. Half past two. It's a zoo. I'm sippin' and slippin' on my pinot. But I know what he want. Two steps ahead of ya. He's out on a hunt. Lookin' like Bambi, I'm candy. And he want a taste. Half past two. It's a zoo. Look at all these animals in here. Moving like some wild and crazy bandits. Party people up in it. So gone, they on automatic. Look at all these animals in here. Moving like some wild and crazy bandits. You lookin' for a mate, we'll find you a boo. You just might see one in this zoo. Zoo, zoo, zoo. Animals on the loose, loose, loose. We get wind up like. It's a zoo, zoo, zoo. Animals on the loose, loose, loose. It's like we up in the zoo. Zoo. Strapped like a pony, only here with a flawless mane. Like crazy, hit me baby. I'm wild and I can't be tamed. Eagle eye, I spot him, I got him. I don't have to chase. Half past two. It's a zoo. He picks up my fragrance, he goes crazy. He scoops me like Tarzan. We hit the floor, but we proceeded to do our mating dance. Get in the way. Half past two. It's a zoo. You can't expect for me to just sit right here. And keep it together babe. (Keep it together babe). The animal in me won't let me be. And all everything is about to drive me crazy. I just can't take anymore. I think I'm losing control. I feel like letting it go. Giving into my instincts. I just can't take anymore. I think I'm losing control. I feel like letting it go. Giving into my instincts"
