don't cry for me argentina,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange. When I try to explain how I feel. That I still need your love. After all that I've done. You won't believe me. All you will see is a girl you once knew. Although she's dressed up to the nines. At sixes and sevens with you. I had to let it happen, I had to change. Couldn't stay all my life down at heel. Looking out of the window. Staying out of the sun. So I chose freedom. Running around, trying everything new. But nothing impressed me at all. I never expected it to. Don't cry for me Argentina. The truth is I never left you. All through my wild days, my mad existence. I kept my promise, don't keep your distance. And as for fortune, and as for fame. I never invited them in. Though it seemed to the world. They were all I desired. They are illusions. They're not the solutions they promised to be. The answer was here all the time. I love you, and hope you love me. Don't cry for me Argentina. Don't cry for me Argentina. The truth is I never left you. All through my wild days, my mad existence. I kept my promise, don't keep your distance. Have I said too much?. There's nothing more I can think of to say to you. But all you have to do is look at me to know. That every word is true. Don't cry for me Argentina"

It took all the strength I had. but I crawled up on my feet again. Now you're trying to lure me back but. No, those days are gone, my friend. I loved you so much that I thought someday. that you could change. But all you brought me was a heart full of pain. You can't touch me now there's no feeling left.

You were always jealous over such crazy stuff. You can't touch me now there's no feeling left. If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath. What you did to me boy I can't forget. If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath. Don't hold your breath. Move on, don't look back. I jumped off a train running off the tracks. Your day is gone face the facts. A bad movie ends and the screen fades to black. What you did to me boy I can't forget. If you think I'm coming back... (don't hold your breath). You can't touch me now there's no feeling left.

how do you let go of the one you love?,"While you're killing time, time is killing me. Another tomorrow turns to a week. Three simple words, now bittersweet. You don't get what you you want. you get what you need. Been through the desert, and I've overcome. But I don't have the answer to this one. How do you let go of the one you love. When your heart doesn't know how to give up?. As hard as it is, I know it's best for us. I still hurt like a little girl. but all grown up. . How do you take the first step. and not look back. Cut the strings to the world attached. Wash it down when it's all you know?. How do you take the first breath. before you jump off. Give it all when it's not enough. How do you let go of the one you love?. Scared of waking up alone. Scared to find out you were wrong. Is it the fear that makes me feel so numb?. Oh, I haven't been myself for so long. Been through the desert, and I still hold on. But I don't have the answer to this one. How do you let go of the one you love. When your heart doesn't know how to give up?. As hard as it is, I know it's best for us. I still hurt like a little girl. but all grown up. [Post-Chorus]. How do you take the first step and not look back. Cut the strings to the world attached.

Let you inside my world, I still want you in it. Need you in my life and I just can't let you go. You've been here from the start. And baby, now, you own my heart. If we let this fall apart. We lose everything. [chorus]. Whatever happens. When this world is closing in. We keep paying for our sins. I can feel the cost of this loving. Whatever happens. If our truth becomes a lie. I don't know who will survive. Can't you see me hanging on for life. Whatever happens ss. Whatever happens ss. Whatever happens ss. Don't let go of my hand [2x]. I'm hold on to this love scene. No matter more. Wanna love this one, last grip and don't. Lose the chance to find all that we were livin' for. I will hold on forever. Paste our love back together. Just promise me, whatever happens. . [chorus]. Whatever happens. When this world is closing in. We keep paying for our sins. I can feel the cost of this loving. Whatever happens. If our truth becomes a lie. I don't know who will survive. Can't you see me hanging on for life. Whatever happens ss. Whatever happens ss. Whatever happens ss.

The many positions she did made your day. I know you must wonder how she get that way. Don't ask you might not wanna hear what she'll say. Just look in the past and the ways you had fun. Would you wanna know when the things you had done. She might lose her cool and be tempted to run. So what heave you learned when it's all said and done. [Verse 4: Shaggy]. You think of the info that you really don't wanna hear. Your stirrin the feelings that you know you can't really. bare. So what if the answer you can prevent your biggest fear.

don't cry for me argentina,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange. When I try to explain how I feel. That I still need your love. After all that I've done. You won't believe me. All you will see is a girl you once knew. Although she's dressed up to the nines. At sixes and sevens with you. I had to let it happen, I had to change. Couldn't stay all my life down at heel. Looking out of the window. Staying out of the sun. So I chose freedom. Running around, trying everything new. But nothing impressed me at all. I never expected it to. Don't cry for me Argentina. The truth is I never left you. All through my wild days, my mad existence. I kept my promise, don't keep your distance. And as for fortune, and as for fame. I never invited them in. Though it seemed to the world. They were all I desired. They are illusions. They're not the solutions they promised to be. The answer was here all the time. I love you, and hope you love me. Don't cry for me Argentina. Don't cry for me Argentina. The truth is I never left you. All through my wild days, my mad existence. I kept my promise, don't keep your distance. Have I said too much?. There's nothing more I can think of to say to you. But all you have to do is look at me to know. That every word is true. Don't cry for me Argentina"

It took all the strength I had. but I crawled up on my feet again. Now you're trying to lure me back but. No, those days are gone, my friend. I loved you so much that I thought someday. that you could change. But all you brought me was a heart full of pain. You can't touch me now there's no feeling left.

You were always jealous over such crazy stuff. You can't touch me now there's no feeling left. If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath. What you did to me boy I can't forget. If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath. Don't hold your breath. Move on, don't look back. I jumped off a train running off the tracks. Your day is gone face the facts. A bad movie ends and the screen fades to black. What you did to me boy I can't forget. If you think I'm coming back... (don't hold your breath). You can't touch me now there's no feeling left.

how do you let go of the one you love?,"While you're killing time, time is killing me. Another tomorrow turns to a week. Three simple words, now bittersweet. You don't get what you you want. you get what you need. Been through the desert, and I've overcome. But I don't have the answer to this one. How do you let go of the one you love. When your heart doesn't know how to give up?. As hard as it is, I know it's best for us. I still hurt like a little girl. but all grown up. . How do you take the first step. and not look back. Cut the strings to the world attached. Wash it down when it's all you know?. How do you take the first breath. before you jump off. Give it all when it's not enough. How do you let go of the one you love?. Scared of waking up alone. Scared to find out you were wrong. Is it the fear that makes me feel so numb?. Oh, I haven't been myself for so long. Been through the desert, and I still hold on. But I don't have the answer to this one. How do you let go of the one you love. When your heart doesn't know how to give up?. As hard as it is, I know it's best for us. I still hurt like a little girl. but all grown up. [Post-Chorus]. How do you take the first step and not look back. Cut the strings to the world attached.

How do you take the first breath. before you jump off. Give it all when it's not enough. How do you let go of the one you love?. (How do you let go of the one you love?).

zoo,"We step up, the club is flooded. All of a sudden, it's a herd. Chickens be talkin', I keep walkin'. They just a flock of birds. Playas and gators, gorillas holdin' up the wall. Half past two. It's a zoo. I'm sippin' and slippin' on my pinot. But I know what he want. Two steps ahead of ya. He's out on a hunt. Lookin' like Bambi, I'm candy. And he want a taste. Half past two. It's a zoo. Look at all these animals in here. Moving like some wild and crazy bandits. Party people up in it. So gone, they on automatic. Look at all these animals in here. Moving like some wild and crazy bandits. You lookin' for a mate, we'll find you a boo. You just might see one in this zoo. Zoo, zoo, zoo. Animals on the loose, loose, loose. We get wind up like. It's a zoo, zoo, zoo. Animals on the loose, loose, loose. It's like we up in the zoo. Zoo. Strapped like a pony, only here with a flawless mane. Like crazy, hit me baby. I'm wild and I can't be tamed. Eagle eye, I spot him, I got him. I don't have to chase. Half past two. It's a zoo. He picks up my fragrance, he goes crazy. He scoops me like Tarzan. We hit the floor, but we proceeded to do our mating dance. Get in the way. Half past two. It's a zoo. You can't expect for me to just sit right here. And keep it together babe. (Keep it together babe). The animal in me won't let me be. And all everything is about to drive me crazy. I just can't take anymore. I think I'm losing control. I feel like letting it go. Giving into my instincts. I just can't take anymore. I think I'm losing control. I feel like letting it go. Giving into my instincts"
