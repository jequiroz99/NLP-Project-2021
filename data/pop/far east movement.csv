Lunch time: tuna sandwich and a coke. Pen, no book and a pack of newports. City of angels, city don't slow down. Gotta keep movin' because my mama don't know how. You loosin' what I found, right under yo' nose. Everydays beautiful as long as you grow it. Maai, what a day and I got what it takes. I got that keep on, keep on, keep on.

Now I undestand stopping crime's your job. But since I ain't a criminal and I don't rob. Or steal from anyone don't bother me dawg. Busting U-turns to follow me far up the street,. With your hand on your heat, ""Now what's that for? "". I ain't a thug just because I got a hat on. Don't pull me over just to act like an [expletive]. And if you don't believe my answers, ""What you ask for? "". My skin color and police are like past foes. When they was hanging us from trees with a lasso. They oversee a steady beat on my ass yo.

Man this is [expletive] dawg, it just ain't right. Both of us locked up on the same damn night?. They pulled me over telling me I made an illegal right. [Kev Nish:].

I write them right back tell them, ""Please be patient"". You getting what you give Yeah, you got what you wanted. None of ya'll are fam, I ain't keeping a promise. What do you expect from a kid who's in college. Yeah, I got a lotta credit so you know I'm a charge. New rims, DVD's, lava lamps. And if we need some [expletive] get a cash advance.

We level, level with these palm trees. Level with the palm trees"
lights out (go crazy) (junior caldera feat. far east movement & natalia kills),"I can see you in the dark. I see you hi-hi-hiding away. I can feel you in the dark mist.

Made you think that she's the one. And she'll wake up and then your gone. You got the matrix in your head. Run it, run over, gather up, play it. But I know you when you can't lie. No baby you can't lie. You run but you can't hide. I see you when you're pulling. The wool over my eyes. The wool over my eyes. LIGHTS OUT!. (Go crazy, go go go, lights out, go crazy, go go go, go crazy). Hide and seek. Made you peek. Put you to sleep, like Quashi. Wrapped by tie around your neck. That's what I call a freak on a leash. Help yourself, grab my belt. Torn my pants, straight to hell. Oh my god natalia kills kills. This must be how heaven feels. I know you when you can't lie. No baby you can't lie. You run but you can't hide. I see you when you're pulling. The wool over my eyes. The wool over my eyes. LIGHTS OUT!. (Go crazy, go go go, lights out, go crazy, go go go, go crazy)"

smile (feat. ken oak),"[Chorus: Ken Oak]. Smile, smile smile for me. Why don'tcha smile, you can be free. In a little while, your heart will see. Just like a child, smile for me. [Prohgress:]. Yo, stress is eatin' me alive. Can't enjoy a moment, even worry on the rise. 9 times out of 10, when you stop to smell the roses. Is when the opposition sneaks right under your noses. I keep my eyes open, for enemies and fakes. My body's gettin' tired, how long can they wait?. What's it gonna take, one mistake and they nail ya. Mama can't wait 'til she can label me a failure. 50 in the hole and it's blurring out my vision. Sometimes I really wonder if I made the right decision. The future of my seed in the hands of my homies. One's in and out, the other's duckin from the police. I reciprocate, work my fingers to the bone. 7 days a week in this shitty studio. I got one hope, if it's gone then it's all bad. But Catch never sleep, what if he dies in a car crash?. [Chorus:]. Smile, smile smile for me. Why don'tcha smile, you can be free. In a little while, your heart will see. Just like a child, smile for me. [J-Splif:]. Yo, I'm in a choke hold, it's gettin harder to breath. Havin terrifying dreams in my sleep, shit is deep. I try to fly away, but someone's tuggin at my feet. Feelin out of reach with myself in time of need. Out of my zone, fully losin control. And no amount of dope can make my problems just go. I'm losin my sanity, so I take a few hits. Escape from reality cause the truth makes me sick. Another gloomy day, the sun's been out of touch. Locked in my room all alone, feelin' stuck. The pressure's kickin' in, and this Prozac ain't enough. And I know in the future I'm a lose the ones I love. It scares me to death, but the clock won't stop tickin'. So I keep livin' with my hopes and ambitions. Enjoy my stay on Earth, flash my pearly whites. Cause when it hits your turn, you gon' take an early flight. [Chorus:]. In a little while, your heart will see. Just like a child, smile for me. [KevNish:]. Chillin' in the Village feelin' right. In the mornin' yawnin cause the doja got me high. My scrambled Cinemax and HBO is out of sight. I'm infomercial zonin', do I flip or do I buy?. I'm messin' with this chick, caught on my dick. Thinkin' how she fell in love. With a pimp, wantin' a hit, wantin' none of the above. Now some kid's up in the mix, playa's never usin glove. My Sidekick's out of service cause my anytime is up. Eyes is closed, cause I'm hopin' when I open 'em. Time won't go back to 1999 when my mind was wrong. Educated with the answer to open doors, hold the phone, pause. You's a fool, wanna make it in the swimmin pool, blew his cool. My reflections need a miracle, life is full. Of everything I never wanted. Dive in, thank the Lord I can't swim. [Chorus:]. Smile, smile smile for me. Why don'tcha smile, you can be free. In a little while, your heart will see. Just like a child, smile for me"

Hustling from dusk to dawn and. I give high mileage and great performance. Take a ride you can feel the horses. Proh is all business, bounty hunter. Welcome to the jungle, bust ya. Get attached, nah I ain't your man. I swing like the new tarzan. And I'm out for my next prey, can't delay. Lioness thru the glass of the mandalay. I get that play then I'm on my way.

Midnight at the zoo and the lights are flashing. Girls are dancing with their butt cheeks flapping. I smell reefer, somebody better pass it. To the left and I'm next to get plastered. Now that's better, back to the action. We going to play around and always keep it crackin'. So let's boogie, boogie on down. I'm an animal, I'm about to get wild. I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa). I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa-animal). I'm an animal, I, I. I'm an animal, I, I. I'm an animal, I, I. I, I, animal. What's the sound, time for chow. I'll eat your insides pound for pound. Animal instincts, I'm on the prowl. Looking for a girl with a freaky style. Bare back pussy cat in the pocket. Type in the password to unlock it. After dark is when the is dogs barking. Animal house and I came to party. So I'm gonna rock right now. I'm kevnish and I came to get down. I'm not internationally known. But I'm here to rock the microphone so let's go. I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa). I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa-animal). I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa). I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa-animal). I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa).

We only do it in the am. We only do it in the am. We only do it in the A to the M. Then we do it again, baby. by: ehnois"

Because I do, what I do, what I do what I want. Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want. Man I do, what I do, what I do what I want. Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want. Wild out stylin', I came to get down. And ya can't believe that fm on your dial. Hatin' on my crown 'cause the kicks stand out. When I kick the raw sound, then I make ya walk it out. Yeah critics try to test the best. I'm flippin' nose at shows 'cause I dress the best. Fm on my chest, I rep the west. I'm world-wide, haters on house arrest. So when they tell ya how to do yo thang. You tell em step off 'cause the kicks so clean. I got no shame, I'm proud like a champion. I'm at the top of my game. Because I do, what I do, what I do what I want.

Homie fall back, just tryna chill with my pontiac. Pick up a girl, maybe pick two. Im'ma big deal and I'm from a sick crew. It's the 18, we get the job done. It's 24/7 always on the run. Reppin' la, that's where I'm from. Aim for the top, coming straight from the slums. Sick of the hate that's pointed to my dome. Quiet all the yappin', you fake jenny jones. How can you doubt me, I got to much passion. Reppin' fm till they drop in my casket. Try and tell me this and try and tell me that. But I know, I know, I know, I know, I know. It goes in one eat and right out the other. 'cause I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't. Yeah yeah yeah. Say I don't care. I throw my hands in the air. I do it my way. I got no fear. Say I do what I want. Yeah I do what I want. You know I do what I want. I do what I want. Workin' 9 to 9, I'm just tryna sing it live. Is it really any different that I'm wokin' on my rhymes. 'cause my swagger to sick, all my flows too cool. Or the fact that I wear my shades in the early afternoon. Really buggin you? sorry I didn't know about the rules. But I'm pretty sure that mama didn't raise no fool. You can say watchu will, but it ain't no use. Im'ma still low ride, throwin' up the double u. I got my vans on they cost a billion. I do what I want and there ain't no stealin'. Flow so cold 'cause ya boy is chillin'. Haters can't fight the feelin'. Because I do, what I do, what I do what I want. Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want. Man I do, what I do, what I do what I want. Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want. Yeah yeah yeah. Say I don't care. I throw my hands in the air. I do it my way. I got no fear. Say I do what I want. Yeah I do what I want. You know I do what I want. I do what I want"

Yo, people say that I shouldn't be chasing papers. The ones who say it claim they ain't movers and shakers. I mean, I feel the principle, but back to reality. What's the point of me workin' if I can't feed my family. Strategy, I got none and that's abundantly clear. So I take pride to be the new pioneer.

You know I earned it, puttin' in work like my granddad first did. My man Catch birthed it, innovated a purpose. Power to the people no matter the surface. When we rise together you gonna' say it's worth it. And if time is money, I got seconds to earn it. Without you, there's nothin' like an empty bucket. Without you, I'd say bucket? (Who that?).

smile (feat. ken oak),"[Chorus: Ken Oak]. Smile, smile smile for me. Why don'tcha smile, you can be free. In a little while, your heart will see. Just like a child, smile for me. [Prohgress:]. Yo, stress is eatin' me alive. Can't enjoy a moment, even worry on the rise. 9 times out of 10, when you stop to smell the roses. Is when the opposition sneaks right under your noses. I keep my eyes open, for enemies and fakes. My body's gettin' tired, how long can they wait?. What's it gonna take, one mistake and they nail ya. Mama can't wait 'til she can label me a failure. 50 in the hole and it's blurring out my vision. Sometimes I really wonder if I made the right decision. The future of my seed in the hands of my homies. One's in and out, the other's duckin from the police. I reciprocate, work my fingers to the bone. 7 days a week in this shitty studio. I got one hope, if it's gone then it's all bad. But Catch never sleep, what if he dies in a car crash?. [Chorus:]. Smile, smile smile for me. Why don'tcha smile, you can be free. In a little while, your heart will see. Just like a child, smile for me. [J-Splif:]. Yo, I'm in a choke hold, it's gettin harder to breath. Havin terrifying dreams in my sleep, shit is deep. I try to fly away, but someone's tuggin at my feet. Feelin out of reach with myself in time of need. Out of my zone, fully losin control. And no amount of dope can make my problems just go. I'm losin my sanity, so I take a few hits. Escape from reality cause the truth makes me sick. Another gloomy day, the sun's been out of touch. Locked in my room all alone, feelin' stuck. The pressure's kickin' in, and this Prozac ain't enough. And I know in the future I'm a lose the ones I love. It scares me to death, but the clock won't stop tickin'. So I keep livin' with my hopes and ambitions. Enjoy my stay on Earth, flash my pearly whites. Cause when it hits your turn, you gon' take an early flight. [Chorus:]. In a little while, your heart will see. Just like a child, smile for me. [KevNish:]. Chillin' in the Village feelin' right. In the mornin' yawnin cause the doja got me high. My scrambled Cinemax and HBO is out of sight. I'm infomercial zonin', do I flip or do I buy?. I'm messin' with this chick, caught on my dick. Thinkin' how she fell in love. With a pimp, wantin' a hit, wantin' none of the above. Now some kid's up in the mix, playa's never usin glove. My Sidekick's out of service cause my anytime is up. Eyes is closed, cause I'm hopin' when I open 'em. Time won't go back to 1999 when my mind was wrong. Educated with the answer to open doors, hold the phone, pause. You's a fool, wanna make it in the swimmin pool, blew his cool. My reflections need a miracle, life is full. Of everything I never wanted. Dive in, thank the Lord I can't swim. [Chorus:].
