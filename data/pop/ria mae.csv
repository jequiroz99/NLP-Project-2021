clothes off,"I told you I'm not waiting on the wall. You look way too good to leave this up to luck. And I don't want your heart. Your soul. Or your hand. I want your body (want your body). Instead. (Now, now, now, now). Take your clothes off. I've been on your case. Plotting on the ways I can make you mine (mine, mine). Hardly goes a day. Hardly goes away. It must be right (right, right). Open up your door. What are you doing?. We're wasting time. I can see you. Looking at me (looking at me). Is it all in my mind (mind, mind). I told you I'm not waiting on the wall. You look way too good to leave this up to luck. And I don't want your heart. Your soul. Or your hand. I want your body (want your body). Instead. (Now, now, now, now). Take your clothes off. Take your clothes off. Got me in a hold. Everything is moving slow. Time disappears. Wasting to a stop by. You can read my thoughts. When you're near. Nothing is the same. As it was before you got here. Oh ooh, tell 'em not to wake me up. It's all in my mind (mind, mind). I told you I'm not waiting on the wall. You look way too good to leave this up to luck. And I don't want your heart. Your soul. Or your hand. I want your body (want your body). Instead. (Now, now, now, now). Take your clothes off. Take your clothes off. No fallen falling for you. No fallen falling for you. Tell me what you. Tell me, what do you want?. Why are you taking so long?. Why are you taking so long?. Why are you taking so long?. 'Cause I told you I'm not waiting on the wall. You look way too good to leave this up to luck. And I don't want your heart. Your soul. Or your hand. I want your body (want your body). Instead. (Now, now, now, now). Take your clothes off. Take your clothes off"
