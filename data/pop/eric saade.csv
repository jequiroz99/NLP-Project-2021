All I see is clouds, don't see you. I don't wanna see your face again. Again, again, again. Looking down at myself. All alone, there is no one else. Try to scream, I need help. As I'm going through my darkest hour. Try to fight for a light. At the end of this broken light. There's a war, in my mind. As I'm going through my darkest hour. And I need something to open my eyes. Drinking you away, that's my defense. All I see is clouds don't see you. I don't wanna lose myself again. Again, again, again. Hear the sound of falling rain. Pouring down in my brain. I can't sleep, turn insane. As I'm going through my darkest hour"
