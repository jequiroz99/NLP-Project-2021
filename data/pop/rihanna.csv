love the way you lie,"(Rihanna). Just gonna stand there. And watch me burn. But that's alright. Because I like. The way it hurts. Just gonna stand there. And hear me cry. But that's alright. Because I love. The way you lie. I love the way you lie. (Eminem). I can't tell you what it really is. I can only tell you what it feels like. And right now there's a steel knife. In my windpipe. I can't breathe. But I still fight. While I can fight. As long as the wrong feels right. It's like I'm in flight. I offer love. Drunk from the hate. It's like I'm huffing paint. And I love it the more that I suffer. I sufficate. Can't break the fall. About to drown. She resuscitates me. She fucking hates me. And I love it. Wait. Where you going. I'm leaving you. No you ain't. Come back. We're running right back. Here we go again. It's so insane. Cause when it's going good. It's going great. I'm Superman. With the wind in his bag. She's Lois Lane. But when it's bad. It's awful. I feel so ashamed. I snap. Who's that dude. I don't even know his name. I laid hands on him. I'll never stoop so low again. I guess I don't know my own strength. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there. And watch me burn. But that's alright. Because I like. The way it hurts. Just gonna stand there. And hear me cry. But that's alright. Because I love. The way you lie. I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. (Eminem). You ever love somebody so much. You can barely breathe. When you're with them. You meet. And neither one of you. Even know what hit 'em. Got that warm fuzzy feeling. Yeah them chills. Used to get 'em. Now you're getting fucking sick. Of looking at 'em. You swore you've never hit 'em. Never do nothing to hurt 'em. Now you're in each other's face. Spewing venom. And these words. When you spit 'em. You push. Pull each other's hair. Scratch, claw, pit 'em. Throw 'em down. Pin 'em. So lost in the moments. When you're in 'em. It's the craze that the corporate. Controls you both. So they say it's best. To go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know ya. Cause today. That was yesterday. Yesterday is over. It's a different day. Sound like broken records. Playin' over. But you promised her. Next time you'll show restraint. You don't get another chance. Life is no Nintendo game. But you lied again. Now you get to watch her leave. Out the window. Guess that's why they call it window pane. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there. And watch me burn. But that's alright. Because I like. The way it hurts. Just gonna stand there. And hear me cry. But that's alright. Because I love. The way you lie. I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. (Eminem). Now I know we said things. Did things. That we didn't mean. And we fall back. Into the same patterns. Same routine. But your temper's just as bad. As mine is. You're the same as me. But when it comes to love. You're just as blinded. Baby please come back. It wasn't you. Baby it was me. Maybe our relationship. Isn't as crazy as it seems. Maybe that's what happens. When a tornado meets a volcano. All I know is. I love you too much. To walk away though. Come inside. Pick up your bags off the sidewalk. Don't you hear sincerity. In my voice when I talk. Told you this is my fault. Look me in the eyeball. Next time I'm pissed. I'll aim my fist. At the dry wall. Next time. There will be no next time. I apologize. Even though I know it's lies. I'm tired of the games. I just want her back. I know I'm a liar. If she ever tries to fucking leave again. I'mma tie her to the bed. And set this house on fire. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there. And watch me burn. But that's alright. Because I like. The way it hurts. Just gonna stand there. And hear me cry. But that's alright. Because I love. The way you lie. I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie"

And it kills him inside. To know that I am happy with some other guy. I can see him dying. I don't wanna do this anymore. I don't wanna be the reason why. Everytime I walk out the door. I see him die a little more inside. I don't wanna hurt him anymore. I don't wanna take away his life. I don't wanna be.... A murderer. I feel it in the air. As I'm doing my hair. Preparing for another date. A kiss up on my cheek. He's here reluctantly. As if I'm gonna be out late. I say I won't be long. Just hanging with the girls. A lie I didn't have to tell. Because we both know. Where I'm about to go. And we know it very well. Because I know that he knows I'm unfaithful. And it kills him inside. To know that I am happy with some other guy. I can see him dying. I don't wanna do this anymore. I don't wanna be the reason why. Everytime I walk out the door. I see him die a little more inside. I don't wanna hurt him anymore.

I'm on my way so don't close that gate. If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight and. I'll be right back at it by the end of the night. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. Yeah somebody take me back to the days. Before this was a job before I got paid. Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank. Yeah back when I was trying to get into the subway. And back when I was rappin for the hell of it. But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant. I'm guessing that if we could make some wishes out or. airplanes. Then maybe oh maybe I'd go back to the days. Before the politics that we call the rap game. And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape. And back before when I tried to cover up my slang. But this is for the Decatur what's up Bobby Ray. So can I get a wish to end the politics. And get back to the music that started this shit. So here I stand and then again I say. I'm hopin we can make some wishes outa airplanes. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now (Repeat). I could really use a wish right now. I could really use a wish right now. Like, like, like shootin stars. I could really use a wish right now. A wish a wish right now"

darling nikki,"I knew a girl named Nikki. I guess u could say she was a sex fiend. I met her in a hotel lobby. Masturbating with a magazine. She said ""how'd u like to waste some time?"". And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind. She took me to her castle. And I just couldn't believe my eyes. She had so many devices. Everything that money could buy. She said ""sign your name on the dotted line"". The lights went out. And Nikki started to grind. Nikki. The castle started spinning. Or maybe it was my brain. I can't tell u what she did to me. But my body will never be the same. Her lovin' will kick your behind. Oh, she'll show u no mercy. But she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show u how to grind. Darlin' Nikki. Woke up the next morning. Nikki wasn't there. I looked all over and all I found. Was a phone number on the stairs. It said thank u for a funky time. Call me up whenever u want to grind. Oh, Nikki, ohhhh.

Before I betray them I slit my wrists. At the top is just us niggas. Cause I don't really trust niggas. And we made it through the hurricane. So celebrate and light the Mary Jane. We gon' make it, that's on everything. Truest girls get half naked, every spring. They saying, ""Hey Kanye. We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,"". Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain. So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break. On the radio, man I miss myself. I need to just step back and kiss myself. Baby, just step up and kiss the belt.

fly,"[Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. I wish today it will rain all day. Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away. Trying to forgive you for abandoning me. Praying but I think I'm still an angel away. Angel away, yeah strange in a way. Maybe that is why I chase strangers away. They got their guns out aiming at me. But I become near when they aiming at me. Me, me, me against them. Me against enemies, me against friends. Somehow they both seem to become one. A sea full of sharks and they all see blood. They start coming and I start rising. Must be surprising, I'm just summising. Win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher. More fire. [Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. Everybody wanna try to box me in. Suffocating everytime it locks me in. Paint they own pictures than they crop me in. But I will remain where the top begins. Cause I am not a word, I am not a line. I am not a girl that can every be defined. I am not fly, I am levitation. I represent an entire generation. I hear the criticism loud and clear. That is how I know that the time is near. So we become alive in a time of fear. And I aint got no muthaf-cking time to spare. Cry my eyes out for days upon days. Such a heavy burden placed upon me. But when you go hard. Your nay's become yay's. Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's. [Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj - Bridge]. Get ready for it. Get ready for it. Get ready for it. I came to win. Get ready for it. Get ready for it. I came to win. [Rihanna - Chorus]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly"

The love is gone we can't pretend. No matter who else I gave my heart to. There's a part of it that still belongs to you. [Chorus]. You taught me how to laugh. You taught me how to cry. When I gave up you even taught me how to try. There's one more thing to learn before I spread my. wings and fly. You gonna have to teach me how to say. Goodbye, goodbye. You made me stronger now honestly. Gave my heart and voice to speak. You must've known this day will come. But the lessons are all gone. All except for one, no. [Chorus]. You taught me how to laugh. You taught me how to cry. When I gave up you even taught me how to try. There's one more thing to learn. Before I spread my wings and fly. You gonna have to teach me how to say. Goodbye, goodbye. You gonna have to teach me how to say. Goodbye"

It's been a minute since I saw you boy. Must admit it’s good to hear your voice. And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around. See you haven't lost your sense of style. And you still could melt me with your smile. Can't deny that I still got these feelings deep inside. [Hook]. It's funny how things could change. But still remain the same. Isn't love just a crazy game. Baby here I go again. [Chorus]. I look into your eyes and then. My heart remembers when. And I realize I neva gotten over you. Everytime I hear your name. It's like the sun shined through the rain. And I realize it's happenin'. Baby here I go again. Here I Go Again. [Verse 2]. Still remember how you make me weak. How I fought to find the words to speak. I just cant excape the memories. I tried but I just cant break free. Thought I closed the door on what we had. But these feelings just keep comin back. Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that. [Hook]. [Chorus]
hero,"There is a hero. If you look inside your heart. You don't have to be afraid of what you are. There's an answer. If you reach into your soul. And the sorrow you know. Will melt away. And then a hero comes along. With the strength to carry on. And you cast your fears aside. And you know you can survive. So when you feel like hope is gone. Look inside you and be strong. And you'll finally see the truth. That a hero lies in you. It is a long road. When you face the world alone. No one reaches out a hand for you to hold. You can find love. If you search within yourself. And the emptiness you felt. Will disappear. And then a hero comes along. With the strength to carry on. And you cast your fears aside. And you know you can survive. So when you feel like hope is gone. Look inside you and be strong. And you'll finally see the truth. That a hero lies in you. Lord knows. Dreams are hard to follow. But do not let anyone tear them away. Hold on, there will be tomorrow. In time, you'll find the way. And then a hero comes along. With the strength to carry on. And you cast your fears aside. And you know you can survive. So when you feel like hope is gone. Look inside you and be strong. And you'll finally see the truth. That a hero lies in you. That a hero lies in.... you. That a hero lies in.... you"

Because I love. The way you lie. I love the way you lie. (Eminem). I can't tell you what it really is. I can only tell you what it feels like. And right now there's a steel knife. In my windpipe. I can't breathe. But I still fight. While I can fight. As long as the wrong feels right. It's like I'm in flight. I offer love. Drunk from the hate. It's like I'm huffing paint. And I love it the more that I suffer. I sufficate. Can't break the fall. About to drown. She resuscitates me. She fucking hates me. And I love it. Wait. Where you going. I'm leaving you. No you ain't. Come back. We're running right back. Here we go again. It's so insane. Cause when it's going good. It's going great. I'm Superman. With the wind in his bag. She's Lois Lane. But when it's bad. It's awful. I feel so ashamed. I snap. Who's that dude. I don't even know his name. I laid hands on him. I'll never stoop so low again. I guess I don't know my own strength.

Never do nothing to hurt 'em. Now you're in each other's face. Spewing venom. And these words. When you spit 'em. You push. Pull each other's hair. Scratch, claw, pit 'em. Throw 'em down. Pin 'em. So lost in the moments. When you're in 'em. It's the craze that the corporate. Controls you both. So they say it's best. To go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know ya. Cause today. That was yesterday. Yesterday is over. It's a different day. Sound like broken records. Playin' over. But you promised her. Next time you'll show restraint. You don't get another chance. Life is no Nintendo game. But you lied again. Now you get to watch her leave. Out the window. Guess that's why they call it window pane. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there. And watch me burn.

(Eminem). Now I know we said things. Did things. That we didn't mean. And we fall back. Into the same patterns. Same routine. But your temper's just as bad. As mine is. You're the same as me. But when it comes to love. You're just as blinded. Baby please come back. It wasn't you. Baby it was me. Maybe our relationship. Isn't as crazy as it seems. Maybe that's what happens. When a tornado meets a volcano. All I know is. I love you too much. To walk away though. Come inside. Pick up your bags off the sidewalk. Don't you hear sincerity. In my voice when I talk. Told you this is my fault. Look me in the eyeball. Next time I'm pissed. I'll aim my fist. At the dry wall. Next time. There will be no next time. I apologize. Even though I know it's lies. I'm tired of the games. I just want her back. I know I'm a liar. If she ever tries to fucking leave again. I'mma tie her to the bed. And set this house on fire. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there.

love the way you lie (part 2),"On the first page of our story. The future seemed so bright. Then this thing turned out so evil. I don't know why I'm still surprised. Even angels have their wicked schemes. And you take that to new extremes. But you'll always be my hero. Even though you've lost your mind. [Chorus]. Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. But that's alright because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. But that's alright because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. Ohhh, I love the way you lie. Now there's gravel in our voices. Glass is shattered from the fight. In this tug of war, you'll always win. Even when I'm right. ‘Cause you feed me fables from your hand. With violent words and empty threats. And it's sick that all these battles. Are what keeps me satisfied. [Chorus]. Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. But that's all right because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. But that's all right because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. Ohhh, I love the way you lie. So maybe I'm a masochist. I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave. Til the walls are goin' up. In smoke with all our memories. [Eminem]. This morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face. Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction. Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry. That you pushed me into the coffee table last night. So I can push you off me. Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me. Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy. Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me. Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me. Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the. Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we. Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs. That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky. Together we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills. You hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'?. I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count. But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain. Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counsellin'. This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand. Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it. With you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, I'm out it. [Chorus]. Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. But that's alright because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. But that's alright because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. Ohhh, I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie"

man down (remix),"[Eve:]. Ay yo it all started with a simple conversation. Everything was good until we had that altercation. Screaming in my face he should have known I wouldn't take it. Should have been long gone but the fighter in me faced it. I tried to calm him down really, man, I tried to save him. I even called his people like you better come and take him. You better come and get him 'fore he ends up on a table. Fighting for his life or his record with a label. Never put his hands on me again man life gone. And I never regret my whole life long. Cause he did it to himself all the fault was his. I don't feel bad that's just what it is. Should have known better speaking to me like a kid. Should have just let it go, would have let him live. Ha ha would have let him live. [Rihanna:]. Cause I didn't mean to hurt him. Coulda been somebody's son. And I took his heart when. I pulled out that gun. Rum pa pa pum rum pa pa pum rum pa pa pum.

And I'm lost and confused. I've got nothing to lose. Hope to hear from you soon. P.S. I'm still not over you. Still not over you. Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on. But there's a lot of feelings that still remain after you were gone. I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me. But it seems there's always somethin right there to remind me. Like a silly joke, or somethin on the t.v.. Boy it aint easy. When I hear our song. I get that same old feeling. Wish I could press rewind. Turn back the hands of time. And I shouldn't be telling you. Don't you know I've tried and I've tried. To get you out my mind. But it don't get no better. As each day goes by. And I'm lost and confused. I've got nothing to lose. Hope to hear from you soon. P.S. I'm still not over you. Still not over you. Did you know I kept all of your pictures. Don't have the strength to part with them yet. (Oh no) Tried to erase the way your kisses taste. But some things a girl can never forget. Don't you know I've tried and I've tried. To get you out my mind. But it don't get no better. As each day goes by. And I'm lost and confused. I've got nothing to lose. Hope to hear from you soon. P.S. I'm still not over you. Still not over you"

question existing,"Ohh, hmmm. Take off my shirt, loosen the buttons. And undo my skirt. Stare at myself in the mirror. Pick me apart piece by piece. Sorrow decrease, pressure release. I put in work. Did more than called upon, more than deserved. When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes). But it taught me before a decision ask this question first. [Chorus]. Who am I living for? (Ooh yeah). Is this my limit?. Can I endure some more?. Chances are given, question existing. Who am I living for? (Ooohh). Is this my limit?. Can I endure some more?. Chances are given, question existing. Take off my cool, show them that under here. I'm just like you. Do the mistakes I make, make me a fool. Or a human with flaws. Admit that I'm lost. Round of applause. Take the abuse. Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose. It's entertainment. Is that an excuse? (No). But the question that lingers whether win or lose. [Chorus]. Dear diary, it's Robyn. Entertaining is something I do for a living. It's not who I am. I like to think that I'm pretty normal. I laugh, I get mad, I hurt. I think guys suck sometimes. But when you're in the spotlight everything seems good (Oooh yeah). Sometimes I feel like I have it worst cause I always have to keep my guard up. I don't know who to trust. I don't know who wants to date me for who I am. Or who wants to be my friend for who I REALLY am. [Chorus]. ×"

russian roulette,"Take a breath, take it deep. Calm yourself, he says to me. If you play, you play for keeps. Take the gun, and count to three. I'm sweating now, moving slow. No time to think, my turn to go. (Chorus). And you can see my heart beating. You can see it through my chest. And I'm terrified but I'm not leaving. Know that I must pass this test. So just pull the trigger. Say a prayer to yourself. He says close your eyes. Sometimes it helps. And then I get a scary thought. That he's here means he's never lost. (Chorus). And you can see my heart beating. You can see it through my chest. And I'm terrified but I'm not leaving. Know that I must pass this test. So just pull the trigger. . As my life flashes before my eyes. I'm wondering will I ever see another sunrise?. So many won't get the chance to say goodbye. But it's too late too pick up the value of my life. (Chorus). And you can see my heart beating. You can see it through my chest. And I'm terrified but I'm not leaving. Know that I must pass this test. And you can see my heart beating.

suicide,Everywhere is still. Everything is restless in my heart. I hate the way this feels. Suddenly I'm scared to be apart. The days are dark when you're not around. The air is getting hard to breathe. I wish that you would just put me down. I wish that I could go to sleep. Loving you is suicide. I don't know should go or should I stay.

Cause I'm standing over the edge. I should let you go. Tell myself the things I need to hear. But my brain is why you're wrong. That's why I'm loving you when you're not here. Feels like I drown in your every word. And every breath that's in between. Somehow you got me where it really hurts. It's killing every part of me. Loving you is suicide. I don't know should go or should I stay. I'm tryna to keep myself alive. Knowing there's a chance it's all too late. But I heard you say you loved me. That's the part I can't forget. And I wish that you'd come save me. Boy cause I'm standing over the edge. Loving you is suicide. And my world's about to break. And I... had as much as I can take. And love is a long way down. Loving you is suicide. And it's getting harder everyday. I'm tryna to keep myself alive. Knowing there's a chance it's all too late. And I'm way past every moment. But I'm still determined to fight. And I know it's taking all my strength. To keep emotions alive. Loving you is suicide

Oh the bitch is back. Stone cold sober as a matter of fact. I can bitch, I can bitch. `Cause I'm better than you. It's the way that I move. The things that I do. I entertain by picking brains. Sell my soul by dropping names. I don't like those, my God, what's that"

She wants to lead the Glamorous Life. Without love. It ain't much. She saw him standing in the section marked. If you have to ask you can't afford it lingerie.

Diamonds and furs. Love would only conquer my head. She wants to lead the Glamorous Life. She don't need a man's touch. She wants to lead the Glamorous Life. Without love. It ain't much.

the monster,"[Hook: Rihanna]. I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed. Get along with the voices inside of my head. You trying to save me, stop holding your breath. And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy. [Verse 1: Eminem]. I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek. Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosey. Wanted to receive attention for my music. Wanted to be left alone, public excuse me. Been wanting my cake, and eat it too. for wanting it both ways. Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated. When I blew seep it was confusing. Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf. Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam, wooh. Hit the lottery, oh wee. With what I gave up to get was bittersweet. It was like winning a huge meet. Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink. I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep. Going cucko and cooky as Kool Keith. But I'm actually weirder than you think. Cause I'm. [Hook]. Well, that's not fair. Well, that's not fair. [Verse 2: Eminem]. Now I ain't much of a poet. But I know somebody once told me. to seize the moment and don't squander it. Cause you never know when it. all could be over tomorrow so I keep conjuring. Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from. (Yeah, ponder it. Do you wonder there's no wonder you're losing your mind. The way you're brought up?). Yo-lo-lo-lo-yee-whoo. I think you've been wandering off down yonder. And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen. Cause I needed an intervention in this. to intervene between me and this monster. And save me from myself and all this conflict. Cause the very thing that I love is killing me. and I can't conquer it. My OCD is conking me in the head. Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking. I'm just relaying what the voice of my head saying. Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the. [Hook]. Well, that's not fair. Well, that's not fair. [Verse 3: Eminem]. Call me crazy, but I had this vision. One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian. But until then drums get killed I'm coming straight at. Emcees, blood get spilled and I. Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track. Give every kid who got played that. Pumped the villian and shit that say back. To the kids who played 'em. I ain't here to save the fucking children. But if one kid out of a hundred million. Who are going through a struggle feels and relates. that's great. It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back. In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that. Straw into gold chump. I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack. Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts. I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that. It's nothing, I'm still friends with the. [Hook]. Well, that's not fair. Well, that's not fair"

we ride,We ride when we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. When we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. It's real late. 'Bout a quarter to 1. Thinking about everything. We become. And I hate it. I thought we could make it. But I'm ready to jet this. Just wanna forget about it. I saw her pictures. And the letters she sent. You had me thinking. You were out with your friends. I'm so foolish. Play me like I'm stupid. 'Cause I thought it was just you and I (oh). Now I look back on the time. That we spent and. I see it in my mind. Playing over and over again. 'Cause boy right now. You got me breaking down. And I just can't figure out why. But this is what you say. We ride when we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. (we used to say). When we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. We ride when we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. (I remember what you used to say). When we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. Visions in my mind. Of the day that we met. You showed me things. That'll never forget. Took me swimming. In the ocean. You had my head up in the clouds. Make me feel like I'm floating (yeah). You think I'm playing. When you know it's the truth. Nobody else can do it. Quite like I do. All my kisses. And my loving. But ain't nobody. Better than us.

To let go. Of everything (everything) that we planned. And start all over again. Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it. I won't forget how you do it. Sweet baby. This is where the game ends now. Somehow wanna believe you and me. We can figure it out. We ride when we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. When we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. So you make me say boy. I wish that you come hold me. When I'm lonely. When I need someone to talk to. You would phone me. Just like everything you told me. (when we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die). Boy you forgot about the promises. You made me. And now we'll let the memories. Just fade away. But I remember. What you used to say. (when we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die).

What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to the sucker. Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta. Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast. Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask. I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you. stay with him today I'm still here. I refuse to give up -- cause I believe in what we share. You're livin in prison and what he's givin can't compare. Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know.

And checkin for these hoochies that be on me cause they phony. But you was different - I got no need to be suspicious. Cause I can tell - my life with you would be delicious. The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted. I'm sittin here hoping that we can find some way to kick it. Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it. Slowly advance and miss my chance not to miss it. You blow me kisses. when he ain't lookin, now your heart's tooken. My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook. Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow. Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow. Let you know I care - that someone's there for your struggle. Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble. I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more. I told you before, no time to waste we can hook up at the store. Can you get away?.

When I need someone to talk to. You would phone me. Just like everything you told me. (when we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die). Boy you forgot about the promises. You made me. And now we'll let the memories. Just fade away. But I remember. What you used to say. (when we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die). [Chorus x4: Rihanna (TuPac)].

what now,"I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat. I shouldn't be crying,. Tears were for the weaker days. I'm stronger now or so I say. But something's missing.

love the way you lie,"(Rihanna). Just gonna stand there. And watch me burn. But that's alright. Because I like. The way it hurts. Just gonna stand there. And hear me cry. But that's alright. Because I love. The way you lie. I love the way you lie. (Eminem). I can't tell you what it really is. I can only tell you what it feels like. And right now there's a steel knife. In my windpipe. I can't breathe. But I still fight. While I can fight. As long as the wrong feels right. It's like I'm in flight. I offer love. Drunk from the hate. It's like I'm huffing paint. And I love it the more that I suffer. I sufficate. Can't break the fall. About to drown. She resuscitates me. She fucking hates me. And I love it. Wait. Where you going. I'm leaving you. No you ain't. Come back. We're running right back. Here we go again. It's so insane. Cause when it's going good. It's going great. I'm Superman. With the wind in his bag. She's Lois Lane. But when it's bad. It's awful. I feel so ashamed. I snap. Who's that dude. I don't even know his name. I laid hands on him. I'll never stoop so low again. I guess I don't know my own strength. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there. And watch me burn. But that's alright. Because I like. The way it hurts. Just gonna stand there. And hear me cry. But that's alright. Because I love. The way you lie. I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. (Eminem). You ever love somebody so much. You can barely breathe. When you're with them. You meet. And neither one of you. Even know what hit 'em. Got that warm fuzzy feeling. Yeah them chills. Used to get 'em. Now you're getting fucking sick. Of looking at 'em. You swore you've never hit 'em. Never do nothing to hurt 'em. Now you're in each other's face. Spewing venom. And these words. When you spit 'em. You push. Pull each other's hair. Scratch, claw, pit 'em. Throw 'em down. Pin 'em. So lost in the moments. When you're in 'em. It's the craze that the corporate. Controls you both. So they say it's best. To go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know ya. Cause today. That was yesterday. Yesterday is over. It's a different day. Sound like broken records. Playin' over. But you promised her. Next time you'll show restraint. You don't get another chance. Life is no Nintendo game. But you lied again. Now you get to watch her leave. Out the window. Guess that's why they call it window pane. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there. And watch me burn. But that's alright. Because I like. The way it hurts. Just gonna stand there. And hear me cry. But that's alright. Because I love. The way you lie. I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. (Eminem). Now I know we said things. Did things. That we didn't mean. And we fall back. Into the same patterns. Same routine. But your temper's just as bad. As mine is. You're the same as me. But when it comes to love. You're just as blinded. Baby please come back. It wasn't you. Baby it was me. Maybe our relationship. Isn't as crazy as it seems. Maybe that's what happens. When a tornado meets a volcano. All I know is. I love you too much. To walk away though. Come inside. Pick up your bags off the sidewalk. Don't you hear sincerity. In my voice when I talk. Told you this is my fault. Look me in the eyeball. Next time I'm pissed. I'll aim my fist. At the dry wall. Next time. There will be no next time. I apologize. Even though I know it's lies. I'm tired of the games. I just want her back. I know I'm a liar. If she ever tries to fucking leave again. I'mma tie her to the bed. And set this house on fire. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there. And watch me burn. But that's alright. Because I like. The way it hurts. Just gonna stand there. And hear me cry. But that's alright. Because I love. The way you lie. I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie"

hate that i love you (feat. ne-yo),"That's how much I love you. That's how much I need you. And I can't stand you. Must everything you do make me wanna smile. Can I not like it for a while ?. No.. but you won't let me. You upset me girl, then you kiss my lips. All of a sudden I forget that I was upset. Can't remember what you did. But I hate it. You know exactly what to do. So that I can't stay mad at you. For too long, that's wrong. But, I hate it. You know exactly how to touch. So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more. So I despise that I adore you. And I hate how much I love you boy. I can't stand how much I need you. And I hate how much I love you boy. But I just can't let you go. And I hate that I love you so... And you completely know the power that you have. The only one that makes me laugh. Sad and it's not fair how you take advantage of the fact that I. Love you beyond the reason why. And it just ain't right. And I hate how much I love you girl. I can't stand how much I need you. And I hate how much I love you girl. But I just can't let you go. and I hate that I love you so. One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me. And your kiss won't make me weak. But no one in this world knows me the way you know me. So you'll probably always have a spell on me. That's how much I love you. That's how much I need you. That's how much I love you. That's how much I need you. And I hate that I love you so. And I hate how much I love you boy.

I can’t find a way to make it right. and we both know that the stories ending,. we play the part but we're just pretending. and I can’t hide the tears. cause even though your here,. it feels like you’re a million miles away.. Was it me,. or was it you that broke away?. for what we were, it’s like a season love is change and every. time I think about it,. it tears me up inside. Like the rivers of emotions. but I got no more tears to cry.. It feels like you’re a million miles away. as your lying here with me tonight. I can’t even find the words to say. I can’t find a way to make it right. and we both know that the stories ending,. we play the part but we're just pretending. and I can’t hide the tears. cause even though your here,. it feels like you’re a million miles away.. We can try to talk it over. but we walked that road before,. while our song is playing its last note,. we both know for sure. that its time to close that door.. It feels like you’re a million miles away. as your lying here with me tonight. I can’t even find the words to say. I can’t find a way to make it right. and we both know that the stories ending,. we play the part but we're just pretending. and I can’t hide the tears. cause even though your here,. it feels like you’re a million miles away."
airplanes,"Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. I could use a dream or a Jeanie or a wish. To go back to a place much simpler than this. 'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'. And all the glitz and glam and the fashion. And all the pandemonium and all the madness. There comes a time when you fade to the blackness. And when you're starin at the phone in your lap. And you hopin' but them people never call you back. But that's just how the story unfolds. You get another hand soon after you fold. And when your plans unravel in the sand. What would you wish for if you had one chance?. So airplane airplane sorry I'm late. I'm on my way so don't close that gate. If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight and. I'll be right back at it by the end of the night. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. Yeah somebody take me back to the days. Before this was a job before I got paid. Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank. Yeah back when I was trying to get into the subway. And back when I was rappin for the hell of it. But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant. I'm guessing that if we could make some wishes out or. airplanes. Then maybe oh maybe I'd go back to the days. Before the politics that we call the rap game. And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape. And back before when I tried to cover up my slang. But this is for the Decatur what's up Bobby Ray. So can I get a wish to end the politics. And get back to the music that started this shit. So here I stand and then again I say. I'm hopin we can make some wishes outa airplanes. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now (Repeat). I could really use a wish right now. I could really use a wish right now. Like, like, like shootin stars. I could really use a wish right now. A wish a wish right now"

We gon' make it, that's on everything. Truest girls get half naked, every spring. They saying, ""Hey Kanye. We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,"". Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain. So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break. On the radio, man I miss myself. I need to just step back and kiss myself. Baby, just step up and kiss the belt.

fly,"[Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. I wish today it will rain all day. Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away. Trying to forgive you for abandoning me. Praying but I think I'm still an angel away. Angel away, yeah strange in a way. Maybe that is why I chase strangers away. They got their guns out aiming at me. But I become near when they aiming at me. Me, me, me against them. Me against enemies, me against friends. Somehow they both seem to become one. A sea full of sharks and they all see blood. They start coming and I start rising. Must be surprising, I'm just summising. Win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher. More fire. [Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. Everybody wanna try to box me in. Suffocating everytime it locks me in. Paint they own pictures than they crop me in. But I will remain where the top begins. Cause I am not a word, I am not a line. I am not a girl that can every be defined. I am not fly, I am levitation. I represent an entire generation. I hear the criticism loud and clear. That is how I know that the time is near. So we become alive in a time of fear. And I aint got no muthaf-cking time to spare. Cry my eyes out for days upon days. Such a heavy burden placed upon me. But when you go hard. Your nay's become yay's. Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's. [Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly.

Take it to the tele and make her a victim. Controlling the brain, ball play you in the face. They shake the spot, she's just another case. [Chorus]. Easy for a good girl to gone bad. And once we've gone (gone). There's belief we've gone forever. Don't be the reason. Don't be the reason. You better learn how to treat us right. Cause onces a good girl goes bad. We die forever. He's staying with a flock of them oh, yeah. Got a girl at home but he don't care. Won't care (won't care). All he'll do is keep me at home,. won't let me go no-where. He thinks because I'm at home. I won't be gettin it on. And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets. Chicks calling the house, no stop its. Getting out of control. finally I can't take no more. Because I met her on the stairs,. saying this is the end. I packed my bag and left with your best friend. [Chorus]. Easy for a good girl to gone bad. And once we've gone (gone). There's belief we've gone forever. Don't be the reason. Don't be the reason. You better learn how to treat us right. Cause onces a good girl goes bad. We die forever. We stay, moving around, so low.

goodbye,"I rest my hand across your lips. Feel your breath by my fingertips. No longer can I lay what is right. But this love it won't get appropriate without a fight. I'd rather note and tear it up. There are no words that can say no. No I'm gonna hurt you and I'll walk out that door. But I swear it's gonna hurt me even more. [Chorus]. You taught me how to laugh. You taught me how to cry. When I gave up you even taught me how to try. There's one more thing to learn before I spread my. wings and fly. You gonna have to teach me how to say. Goodbye, goodbye. Wish I could see the dreams tonight. Wish I could name and turn them right. Tempted to turn back just one last kiss. But my heart tells me it's bad as just like this. So this is how the story ends. The love is gone we can't pretend. No matter who else I gave my heart to. There's a part of it that still belongs to you. [Chorus]. You taught me how to laugh. You taught me how to cry. When I gave up you even taught me how to try. There's one more thing to learn before I spread my. wings and fly. You gonna have to teach me how to say. Goodbye, goodbye. You made me stronger now honestly. Gave my heart and voice to speak. You must've known this day will come. But the lessons are all gone. All except for one, no. [Chorus]. You taught me how to laugh. You taught me how to cry. When I gave up you even taught me how to try. There's one more thing to learn. Before I spread my wings and fly. You gonna have to teach me how to say. Goodbye, goodbye. You gonna have to teach me how to say. Goodbye"

It's been a minute since I saw you boy. Must admit it’s good to hear your voice. And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around. See you haven't lost your sense of style. And you still could melt me with your smile. Can't deny that I still got these feelings deep inside. [Hook]. It's funny how things could change. But still remain the same. Isn't love just a crazy game. Baby here I go again. [Chorus]. I look into your eyes and then. My heart remembers when. And I realize I neva gotten over you. Everytime I hear your name. It's like the sun shined through the rain. And I realize it's happenin'. Baby here I go again. Here I Go Again. [Verse 2]. Still remember how you make me weak. How I fought to find the words to speak. I just cant excape the memories. I tried but I just cant break free. Thought I closed the door on what we had. But these feelings just keep comin back. Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that. [Hook]. [Chorus]
hero,"There is a hero. If you look inside your heart. You don't have to be afraid of what you are. There's an answer. If you reach into your soul. And the sorrow you know. Will melt away. And then a hero comes along. With the strength to carry on. And you cast your fears aside. And you know you can survive. So when you feel like hope is gone. Look inside you and be strong. And you'll finally see the truth. That a hero lies in you. It is a long road. When you face the world alone. No one reaches out a hand for you to hold. You can find love. If you search within yourself. And the emptiness you felt. Will disappear. And then a hero comes along. With the strength to carry on. And you cast your fears aside. And you know you can survive. So when you feel like hope is gone. Look inside you and be strong. And you'll finally see the truth. That a hero lies in you. Lord knows. Dreams are hard to follow. But do not let anyone tear them away. Hold on, there will be tomorrow. In time, you'll find the way. And then a hero comes along. With the strength to carry on. And you cast your fears aside. And you know you can survive. So when you feel like hope is gone. Look inside you and be strong. And you'll finally see the truth. That a hero lies in you. That a hero lies in.... you. That a hero lies in.... you"

Because I love. The way you lie. I love the way you lie. (Eminem). I can't tell you what it really is. I can only tell you what it feels like. And right now there's a steel knife. In my windpipe. I can't breathe. But I still fight. While I can fight. As long as the wrong feels right. It's like I'm in flight. I offer love. Drunk from the hate. It's like I'm huffing paint. And I love it the more that I suffer. I sufficate. Can't break the fall. About to drown. She resuscitates me. She fucking hates me. And I love it. Wait. Where you going. I'm leaving you. No you ain't. Come back. We're running right back. Here we go again. It's so insane. Cause when it's going good. It's going great. I'm Superman. With the wind in his bag. She's Lois Lane. But when it's bad. It's awful. I feel so ashamed. I snap. Who's that dude. I don't even know his name. I laid hands on him. I'll never stoop so low again. I guess I don't know my own strength.

Never do nothing to hurt 'em. Now you're in each other's face. Spewing venom. And these words. When you spit 'em. You push. Pull each other's hair. Scratch, claw, pit 'em. Throw 'em down. Pin 'em. So lost in the moments. When you're in 'em. It's the craze that the corporate. Controls you both. So they say it's best. To go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know ya. Cause today. That was yesterday. Yesterday is over. It's a different day. Sound like broken records. Playin' over. But you promised her. Next time you'll show restraint. You don't get another chance. Life is no Nintendo game. But you lied again. Now you get to watch her leave. Out the window. Guess that's why they call it window pane. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there. And watch me burn.

(Eminem). Now I know we said things. Did things. That we didn't mean. And we fall back. Into the same patterns. Same routine. But your temper's just as bad. As mine is. You're the same as me. But when it comes to love. You're just as blinded. Baby please come back. It wasn't you. Baby it was me. Maybe our relationship. Isn't as crazy as it seems. Maybe that's what happens. When a tornado meets a volcano. All I know is. I love you too much. To walk away though. Come inside. Pick up your bags off the sidewalk. Don't you hear sincerity. In my voice when I talk. Told you this is my fault. Look me in the eyeball. Next time I'm pissed. I'll aim my fist. At the dry wall. Next time. There will be no next time. I apologize. Even though I know it's lies. I'm tired of the games. I just want her back. I know I'm a liar. If she ever tries to fucking leave again. I'mma tie her to the bed. And set this house on fire. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there.

love the way you lie (part 2),"On the first page of our story. The future seemed so bright. Then this thing turned out so evil. I don't know why I'm still surprised. Even angels have their wicked schemes. And you take that to new extremes. But you'll always be my hero. Even though you've lost your mind. [Chorus]. Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. But that's alright because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. But that's alright because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. Ohhh, I love the way you lie. Now there's gravel in our voices. Glass is shattered from the fight. In this tug of war, you'll always win. Even when I'm right. ‘Cause you feed me fables from your hand. With violent words and empty threats. And it's sick that all these battles. Are what keeps me satisfied. [Chorus]. Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. But that's all right because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. But that's all right because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. Ohhh, I love the way you lie. So maybe I'm a masochist. I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave. Til the walls are goin' up. In smoke with all our memories. [Eminem]. This morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face. Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction. Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry. That you pushed me into the coffee table last night. So I can push you off me. Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me. Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy. Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me. Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me. Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the. Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we. Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs. That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky. Together we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills. You hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'?. I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count. But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain. Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counsellin'. This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand. Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it. With you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, I'm out it. [Chorus]. Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. But that's alright because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. But that's alright because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. Ohhh, I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie"

man down (remix),"[Eve:]. Ay yo it all started with a simple conversation. Everything was good until we had that altercation. Screaming in my face he should have known I wouldn't take it. Should have been long gone but the fighter in me faced it. I tried to calm him down really, man, I tried to save him. I even called his people like you better come and take him. You better come and get him 'fore he ends up on a table. Fighting for his life or his record with a label. Never put his hands on me again man life gone. And I never regret my whole life long. Cause he did it to himself all the fault was his. I don't feel bad that's just what it is. Should have known better speaking to me like a kid. Should have just let it go, would have let him live.

And it might be easier. The words might come out better. How's your mother, how's your little brother?. Does he still look just like you?. So many things I wanna know the answers to. Wish I could press rewind. And rewrite every line. To the story of me and you. Don't you know I've tried and I've tried. To get you out my mind. But it don't get no better. As each day goes by. And I'm lost and confused. I've got nothing to lose. Hope to hear from you soon. P.S. I'm still not over you. Still not over you. Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on. But there's a lot of feelings that still remain after you were gone. I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me. But it seems there's always somethin right there to remind me. Like a silly joke, or somethin on the t.v.. Boy it aint easy. When I hear our song. I get that same old feeling. Wish I could press rewind. Turn back the hands of time. And I shouldn't be telling you. Don't you know I've tried and I've tried. To get you out my mind. But it don't get no better. As each day goes by. And I'm lost and confused. I've got nothing to lose. Hope to hear from you soon. P.S. I'm still not over you. Still not over you. Did you know I kept all of your pictures. Don't have the strength to part with them yet. (Oh no) Tried to erase the way your kisses taste. But some things a girl can never forget. Don't you know I've tried and I've tried. To get you out my mind. But it don't get no better. As each day goes by. And I'm lost and confused. I've got nothing to lose. Hope to hear from you soon. P.S. I'm still not over you. Still not over you"

question existing,"Ohh, hmmm. Take off my shirt, loosen the buttons. And undo my skirt. Stare at myself in the mirror. Pick me apart piece by piece. Sorrow decrease, pressure release. I put in work. Did more than called upon, more than deserved. When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes). But it taught me before a decision ask this question first. [Chorus]. Who am I living for? (Ooh yeah). Is this my limit?. Can I endure some more?. Chances are given, question existing. Who am I living for? (Ooohh). Is this my limit?. Can I endure some more?. Chances are given, question existing. Take off my cool, show them that under here. I'm just like you. Do the mistakes I make, make me a fool. Or a human with flaws. Admit that I'm lost. Round of applause. Take the abuse. Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose. It's entertainment. Is that an excuse? (No). But the question that lingers whether win or lose. [Chorus]. Dear diary, it's Robyn. Entertaining is something I do for a living. It's not who I am. I like to think that I'm pretty normal. I laugh, I get mad, I hurt. I think guys suck sometimes. But when you're in the spotlight everything seems good (Oooh yeah). Sometimes I feel like I have it worst cause I always have to keep my guard up. I don't know who to trust. I don't know who wants to date me for who I am. Or who wants to be my friend for who I REALLY am. [Chorus]. ×"

russian roulette,"Take a breath, take it deep. Calm yourself, he says to me. If you play, you play for keeps. Take the gun, and count to three. I'm sweating now, moving slow. No time to think, my turn to go. (Chorus). And you can see my heart beating. You can see it through my chest. And I'm terrified but I'm not leaving. Know that I must pass this test.

The air is getting hard to breathe. I wish that you would just put me down. I wish that I could go to sleep. Loving you is suicide. I don't know should go or should I stay. I'm tryna to keep myself alive. Knowing there's a chance it's all too late. But I heard you say you loved me. That's the part I can't forget. And I wish that you'd come save me. Cause I'm standing over the edge. I should let you go. Tell myself the things I need to hear. But my brain is why you're wrong. That's why I'm loving you when you're not here. Feels like I drown in your every word. And every breath that's in between. Somehow you got me where it really hurts. It's killing every part of me. Loving you is suicide. I don't know should go or should I stay. I'm tryna to keep myself alive. Knowing there's a chance it's all too late. But I heard you say you loved me. That's the part I can't forget. And I wish that you'd come save me. Boy cause I'm standing over the edge. Loving you is suicide. And my world's about to break. And I... had as much as I can take. And love is a long way down. Loving you is suicide. And it's getting harder everyday. I'm tryna to keep myself alive. Knowing there's a chance it's all too late. And I'm way past every moment. But I'm still determined to fight. And I know it's taking all my strength. To keep emotions alive. Loving you is suicide

Oh the bitch is back. Stone cold sober as a matter of fact. I can bitch, I can bitch. `Cause I'm better than you. It's the way that I move. The things that I do. I entertain by picking brains. Sell my soul by dropping names. I don't like those, my God, what's that"

She wants to lead the Glamorous Life. Without love. It ain't much. She saw him standing in the section marked. If you have to ask you can't afford it lingerie.

Diamonds and furs. Love would only conquer my head. She wants to lead the Glamorous Life. She don't need a man's touch. She wants to lead the Glamorous Life. Without love. It ain't much.

the monster,"[Hook: Rihanna]. I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed. Get along with the voices inside of my head. You trying to save me, stop holding your breath. And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy. [Verse 1: Eminem]. I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek. Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosey. Wanted to receive attention for my music. Wanted to be left alone, public excuse me. Been wanting my cake, and eat it too. for wanting it both ways. Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated. When I blew seep it was confusing. Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf. Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam, wooh. Hit the lottery, oh wee. With what I gave up to get was bittersweet. It was like winning a huge meet. Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink. I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep. Going cucko and cooky as Kool Keith. But I'm actually weirder than you think. Cause I'm. [Hook]. Well, that's not fair. Well, that's not fair. [Verse 2: Eminem]. Now I ain't much of a poet. But I know somebody once told me. to seize the moment and don't squander it. Cause you never know when it. all could be over tomorrow so I keep conjuring. Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from. (Yeah, ponder it. Do you wonder there's no wonder you're losing your mind. The way you're brought up?). Yo-lo-lo-lo-yee-whoo. I think you've been wandering off down yonder. And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen. Cause I needed an intervention in this. to intervene between me and this monster. And save me from myself and all this conflict. Cause the very thing that I love is killing me. and I can't conquer it. My OCD is conking me in the head. Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking. I'm just relaying what the voice of my head saying. Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the. [Hook]. Well, that's not fair. Well, that's not fair. [Verse 3: Eminem]. Call me crazy, but I had this vision. One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian. But until then drums get killed I'm coming straight at. Emcees, blood get spilled and I. Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track. Give every kid who got played that. Pumped the villian and shit that say back. To the kids who played 'em. I ain't here to save the fucking children. But if one kid out of a hundred million. Who are going through a struggle feels and relates. that's great. It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back. In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that. Straw into gold chump. I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack. Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts. I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that. It's nothing, I'm still friends with the. [Hook]. Well, that's not fair. Well, that's not fair"

we ride,We ride when we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. When we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. It's real late. 'Bout a quarter to 1. Thinking about everything. We become. And I hate it. I thought we could make it. But I'm ready to jet this. Just wanna forget about it. I saw her pictures. And the letters she sent. You had me thinking. You were out with your friends. I'm so foolish. Play me like I'm stupid. 'Cause I thought it was just you and I (oh). Now I look back on the time. That we spent and. I see it in my mind. Playing over and over again. 'Cause boy right now. You got me breaking down. And I just can't figure out why. But this is what you say. We ride when we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. (we used to say). When we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. We ride when we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. (I remember what you used to say). When we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. Visions in my mind. Of the day that we met. You showed me things. That'll never forget. Took me swimming. In the ocean. You had my head up in the clouds. Make me feel like I'm floating (yeah). You think I'm playing. When you know it's the truth. Nobody else can do it. Quite like I do. All my kisses. And my loving. But ain't nobody. Better than us.

To let go. Of everything (everything) that we planned. And start all over again. Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it. I won't forget how you do it. Sweet baby. This is where the game ends now. Somehow wanna believe you and me. We can figure it out. We ride when we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. When we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. So you make me say boy. I wish that you come hold me. When I'm lonely. When I need someone to talk to. You would phone me. Just like everything you told me. (when we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die). Boy you forgot about the promises. You made me. And now we'll let the memories. Just fade away. But I remember. What you used to say. (when we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die).

Me and you - was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely. Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see. A happy home, that's my fantasy. But my reality is problems with your man and me. What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to the sucker. Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta. Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast. Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask. I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you. stay with him today I'm still here. I refuse to give up -- cause I believe in what we share. You're livin in prison and what he's givin can't compare. Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know. Passion it be yours and I'll never let you go. Tell me can you get away?. [Chorus: Rihanna (TuPac)]. We Ride (I'm a straight rider) when we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die.

And checkin for these hoochies that be on me cause they phony. But you was different - I got no need to be suspicious. Cause I can tell - my life with you would be delicious. The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted. I'm sittin here hoping that we can find some way to kick it. Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it. Slowly advance and miss my chance not to miss it. You blow me kisses. when he ain't lookin, now your heart's tooken. My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook. Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow. Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow. Let you know I care - that someone's there for your struggle. Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble. I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more. I told you before, no time to waste we can hook up at the store. Can you get away?. [Chorus x2: Rihanna (TuPac)]. We Ride (I'm a straight rider) when we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. When we ride we ride. It's 'til the day that we die. And i remember what you used to say,. When we ride, we ride its till the day that we die. [Bridge: Rihanna]. Gonna make me say boy. I wish that you come hold me. When I'm lonely. When I need someone to talk to. You would phone me. Just like everything you told me. (when we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die). Boy you forgot about the promises. You made me. And now we'll let the memories. Just fade away. But I remember. What you used to say. (when we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die). [Chorus x4: Rihanna (TuPac)].

Don't you go into her crazy. You should be my baby. It's true. You should be mine (mine, mine, mine). Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh boy. Oh baby, baby, baby. You should be mine. Boy nobody knows you better. We belong together. It's true. You should be mine. Don't you go into her crazy. You should be my baby. It's true. You should be mine (mine, mine, mine). Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh boy. Oh baby, baby, baby"
younger years (feat. scarface),"[Rihanna]. I remember when the world was just me and my mama. All I waited for was to wear my dresses in the summer. Nothing else seemed that important to me. After all I was only young you see. Now im growing up to become another little woman. Hopefully its a new start and a new beginnig. Im not so innocent now. I got big things ahead of me now. I remember when we used to play kids chase. Didnt have to worry about getting them straight a's. Life was simple then. Life was life was life was simple then. I remember when we used to play mommies and daddies. The biggest beef that we had would be who is the mommies. Woahh life was simple then. Life was life was life was simple then. [ScarFace].

Look at me now next year il be 16. But I still look back at primary school life and its routines. Tuesdays first lesson always were abit of maths. And at the end we went over made sure we learnt all the task's. Learning objectives for thursdays were. To complete abit more on forces. and made sure we knew what we learnt. Most lunchtimes all we did was play family had. These memories were all happy not one single sad,. But there are a couple of sad ones that I keep in my heart.

Times ticking and its moving on. Im growing older hopefully wiser. And time will tell. Reminiscing back on them old days. When life was easy thats what pleased me. [ScarFace]. We used to swing on them swings and slide on them slides. But as I got older its just been money on my mind. But I wanna go back to them simpler days. When life itself didn't feel like a maze. The one thing I miss about it all is nursery. When everyday all we did was revise the a-b-c. Memories like this I know that il miss. Nothing we can do now but sit back and reminisce. [Rihanna].
