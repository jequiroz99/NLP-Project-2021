see a little light,Stay alone in my room. Every moment passing too soon. Watch the candles burn into the night. Fall into a dream. Wake up and everything's the same. A second older but alone just like a child. If you just give me a sign. To live and not to die. Then I could see a little light. I could find some peace of mind. I don't know where you are. Maybe near or maybe far. I just need a little light. Hear a clock ticking. On a life that could have meaning. If I could find the love light in your eyes. See a million people. Everyone's so lonely. But we don't have to be alone tonight. Then I could see a little light. I could find some peace of mind. I don't know where you are. Maybe near or maybe far. I just need a little light. If I could see a little light. If I could find some piece of mind. If you just give me a sign. I could see a little light. I don't know where you are. Maybe near or maybe far. I could see a little light. If I could see a little light. I could see a little light. Stay alone in my room. Every moment passing too soon. Watch the candles burn into the night
