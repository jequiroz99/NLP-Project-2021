house of the rising sun,There is a house in New Orleans. They call the Rising Sun. And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl. And God I know I'm one. My mother she's a tailor. She sews those new bluejeans. My father he's a gamblin' man. Down in New Orleans. Now the only thing a gambler needs. Is a suitcase and trunk. And the only time he's ever satisfied. Is when he's on a drunk. I got one foot on the platform. The other foot on the train. I'm goin' back to New Orleans. To wear that ball and chain. Oh mother tell your children. Not to do as I have done. Spend your lives in sin and misery. In the House of the Rising Sun. There is a house in New Orleans. They call the Rising Sun. And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl. And God I know I'm one
matters of the heart,I lose my head. From time to time. I make a fool of myself. In matters of the heart. We should have been holding each other. Instead we talked. I make a fool of myself. In matters of the heart. But I asked before. Your reply was kind and polite. One wants more. When one's denied. I make a fool of myself. In matters of the heart. I won't call it love. But it feels good to have passion in my life. If there's a battle. I hope my head always defers to my heart. In matters of the heart. I guess I'm crazy to think. I can give you what you don't want. I make a fool of myself. In matters of the heart. I wish that I had the power. To make these feelings stop. I lose all self control. In matters of the heart. I can't believe. It's so hard to find someone. To give affection to. And from whom you can receive. I guess it's just the draw of the cards. In matters of the heart. You caught me off guard. Somehow you reached me. Where I thought I had nothing left inside. I've learned my lesson I've been edified. In matters of the heart. I've spent my nights. Where the sleeping dogs lie. Not by your side. It feels so lonely. Once again I've left to much to chance. In matters of the heart. Here I sit. I'm feeling sorry for myself. It's quite a sight. But I have you to thank. For reminding me. We're all alone in this world. And in matters of the heart. I'm already missing you. Although we won't say good-byes. Until tomorrow afternoon. Maybe when and if I see you again. We'll see eye to eye. In matters of the heart. I have no harsh words for you. I have no tears to cry. If the moon were full. I'd be howling inside. It only hurts. In matters of the heart. If today were my birthday. I'd be reborn. As Bronte's bird a bird that could fly. And all accounts would be settled. In matters of the heart. Matters of the heart

I'm trying to protect what I keep inside. All the reasons why I live my life. Some say the devil be a mystical thing. I say the devil he a walking man. He a fool he a liar conjurer and a thief. He try to tell you what you want. Try to tell you what you need. Standing at the point. The road it cross you down. What is at your back. Which way do you turn. Who will come to find you first. Your devils or your gods. All you filks think you run my life. Say I should be willing to compromise. I say all you demons go back to hell. I'll save my soul save myself

be and be not afraid,BE AND BE NOT AFRAID. I believe in mistakes and accidents. That the nature of life is chaos and confusion. That man's rules of law and order. May not stand. And I should be and be not afraid. To reach for heaven. I may think that I know. The true heart's needs. But my pride may bring me low. Unable to see. I'm no closer than yesterday. But tomorrow I may stand. And be and be not afraid. To reach for heaven. I'll see the black car cavalcade. Lights on in the morn. I'll run fast and far away. I'll run without stopping. 'Til hear and feet fail. Or until I can stand. And be and be not afraid. Be and be not afraid. Be and be not afraid. To reach for heaven. © 2004 Tracy Chapman

telling stories,There is fiction in the space between. The lines on your page of memories. Write it down but it doesn't mean. You're not just telling stories. There is fiction in the space between. You and reality. You will do and say anything. To make your everyday life seem less mundane. There is fiction in the space between. You and me. There's a science fiction in the space between. You and me. A fabrication of a grand scheme. Where I am the scary monster. I eat the city and as I leave the scene. In my spaceship I am laughing. In your remembrance of your bad dream. There's no one but you standing. Leave the pity and the blame. For the ones who do not speak. You write the words to get respect and compassion. And for posterity. You write the words and make believe. There is truth in the space between. There is fiction in the space between. You and everybody. Give us all what we need. Give us one more sad sordid story. But in the fiction of the space between. Sometimes a lie is the best thing. Sometimes a lie is the best thing

I think we all could use some sleep"". Last night I heard the screaming. Loud voices behind the wall. Another sleepless night for me. It won't do no good to call. The police. Always come late.

The earth's gravity has pulled me down. But now I've reconciled that in this world. Birds and angels get the wings to fly. If you can believe in this heart of mine. If you can give it a try.

america,You were lost and got lucky. Came upon the shore. Found you were conquering America. You spoke of peace. But waged a war. While you were conquering America. There was land to take. And people to kill. While you were conquering America. You served yourself. Did God's will. While you were conquering America. The ghost of Columbus haunts this world. 'Cause you're still conquering America. The meek won't survive. Or inherit the earth. 'Cause you're still conquering America. America. America. America. You found bodies to serve. Submit and degrade. While you were conquering America. Made us soldiers and junkies. Prisoners and slaves. While you were conquering America. America. America. America. You hands are at my throat. My back's against the wall. Because you're still conquering America. We're sick and tired hungry and poor. 'Cause you're still conquering America. You bomb the very ground. That feeds your own babies. You're still conquering America. Your sons and your daughters. May never sing your praises. While you're conquering America. America. America. America. I see you eyes seek a distant shore. While you're conquering America. Taking rockets to the moon. Trying to find a new world. And you're still conquering America. America. America. America. The ghost of Columbus haunts this world. 'Cause you're still conquering America. You're still conquering America. You're still conquering America. © 2001 Tracy Chapman
another sun,Trouble won't find me. Sorrow won't call. Sadness will turn away. Searching for a new soul. Hardship won't come by. All pain will cease. Somebody will take my place. And suffer for me. If I never see another sun. If I never see another sun. If I never see another sun. Another sun another sun. If no love will confort me. If no kind words come. To offer hope or peace. When I have fallen. If I be a stranger. Friend of no one. I'll gladly take my place. In the world beyond. If I never see another sun. If I never see another sun. If I never see another sun. Another sun another sun. If I lay down and wake to see. The bright light of the morn. Rise up every day. To blind beat and burn. Show me no mercy. For need or want. Let somebody take my place. When the new day dawns. If I never see another sun. If I never see another sun. If I never see another sun. Another sun another sun. Another sun another sun. Another sun another sun. by GabeCraveiro

cold feet,"There was a little boy once upon a time. Who in spite of his young age and small size knew his mind. For every copper penny and clover he would find. Make a wish for better days the end of hard times. For no more cold feet. Cold cold cold cold feet. His clothes were always clean. His face was always scrubbed. There was food on the table enough to fill him up. His house was full of life His house was full of love. But when winter days arrived. There was never money enough to shod his cold feet. Cold cold cold cold feet. He grew up to be a worker determined to succeed. He made a life for himself, free from worldly wants or needs. But with nobody to share the life he'd made. No body to keep him warm at night. When he'd go to sleep he'd sleep alone with his cold feet. Cold cold cold cold feet. One night he walked the street looking to the heaven's above. Searching for a shooting star a benevolent God. When a woman passing by brushed his arm. He turned and found love. He then wished for the courage to ask this stranger. Who she was to not have cold feet. Cold cold cold cold feet. He thought she'd like the party life and want the finer things. So he promised more than he could buy. And he promised her the sun and moon to not have cold feet. Cold cold cold cold feet. He worked day and night his fingers to the bone. Hi worried mind guilty conscience drive him on. He can't give her what she needs. He wants to give her what he thinks she wants. Her sad-eyed face, his empty pockets drive him on and his cold feet. Cold cold cold cold feet. He'd struggled all his life to be an honest man. Proud that the dirt on his palms was the soil of the land. But some guys he knew from high school days. Said they had a plan to get rich quick. And they could count him in if he don't have cold feet. Cold cold cold cold feet. He thought about their offer accepted it without qualms. Dreamt about the life he'd buy. The comfort that would come without cold feet. Cold cold cold cold feet. He decided to tell his wife things would soon turn around. He said the little boy is dead. A man stands with you now without cold feet. Cold cold cold cold feet. Without cold feet - Cold cold cold cold feet. He thought he'd set his clock right - He though he'd read his watch. He left in such a hurry he didn't think to wish for luck. Makes no difference if you're early - No difference if you're late. When you're out of time - The flowers have been laid. You're six feet underground. With cold feet. Cold cold cold cold feet"

But it's alright it's alright. For a dream. I imagine we are gathered. But this time not dressed in black. There's laughing and smiling. Not stabbing in the back. But it's too good to be true. And too bad I still recall the screams. [Chorus]. I keep half the picture. Mostly in my mind. Mama dressed in white. Ripped when she held your hand. Showing no signs of age. Just slightly frayed along the seam. [Chorus]. It's alright. All that I can claim. It's alright. And it will have to do. It's alright. Better than the pain. It's alright. Better than the truth. It's alright. Alright for a dream. It's alright. Better than fate and the great scheme. It's alright. It's alright. For christmas and for New Year. I wish and I resolve. But I'm disappointed by myself. Jesus and Santa Claus. I want to believe. She's been saved. And he's be redeemed. And it's alright it's alright. For a dream

freedom now,They throwed him in jail. And they kept him there. Hoping so he'd die. That his body and spirit would waste away. And soon after that his mind. But every day is born a fool.

going back,No picnic no barbecue out in the back. A yard for parked cars left to rot and forget. For chained-up mad dogs for garbage to sit. Get lost get lost a part from it. I can't see through it. But i can see past. With me with me always. Without going back. Just people and buildings. Not city or town. Great lake crooked river. Flat land water burns. The air not smoke. It tears the eye. Home is where you live. Home is where you'll die. I can't see through it. But i can see past. With me with me always. Without going back. In a glacial slide. Over ice mirrored glass. In a slip and past times. Are in the future brought back. Reflected reflected reflected. Every footstep. No walk in the park. No there is nowhere. No place can replace. What a clear eye reveals. Soft and hard shaped like a wheel. Made me of rubber made me of steel. I can't see through it. But i can see past. With me with me always. Without going back. © 2005 Tracy Chapman

From the lips that once touched mine with a sigh. Goodbye. For you. It's all in your face. The laugh and worry lines. It's all in the one word. You hope will make you young again. Goodbye. It's all in the play. Someone speaks the line. It's all in the one word. That stops and steals the time. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. For me. It's all in a day. It's the part in life. When it's all in the words. To fate and circumstance resigned. Goodbye

less than strangers,You and me. Had some history. Had a semblance of honesty. All that has changed now. We shared words. Only lover speak. How can it be. We are less than strangers. Oh it hurts to lose in love. Let anger and cruelty win. It’s unfair that you doubt your feelings. And that you’ll ever love again. I know that hearts can change. Like the seasons and the wind. But when I said forever. I thought that we’d always be friends. You and me had some history. Had a semblance of honesty. All that has changed now. We shared words. Only lovers speak. How can it be. We are less than strangers. I thought I saw you yesterday. I thought I passed you on the street. I swear I saw your face. I was not imagining. That you stole a glance my way. You walked away from me.

matters of the heart,I lose my head. From time to time. I make a fool of myself. In matters of the heart. We should have been holding each other. Instead we talked. I make a fool of myself. In matters of the heart. But I asked before. Your reply was kind and polite. One wants more. When one's denied. I make a fool of myself. In matters of the heart. I won't call it love. But it feels good to have passion in my life. If there's a battle. I hope my head always defers to my heart. In matters of the heart. I guess I'm crazy to think. I can give you what you don't want. I make a fool of myself. In matters of the heart. I wish that I had the power. To make these feelings stop. I lose all self control. In matters of the heart. I can't believe. It's so hard to find someone. To give affection to. And from whom you can receive. I guess it's just the draw of the cards. In matters of the heart. You caught me off guard. Somehow you reached me. Where I thought I had nothing left inside. I've learned my lesson I've been edified. In matters of the heart. I've spent my nights. Where the sleeping dogs lie. Not by your side. It feels so lonely. Once again I've left to much to chance. In matters of the heart. Here I sit. I'm feeling sorry for myself. It's quite a sight. But I have you to thank. For reminding me. We're all alone in this world. And in matters of the heart. I'm already missing you. Although we won't say good-byes. Until tomorrow afternoon. Maybe when and if I see you again. We'll see eye to eye. In matters of the heart. I have no harsh words for you. I have no tears to cry. If the moon were full. I'd be howling inside. It only hurts. In matters of the heart. If today were my birthday. I'd be reborn. As Bronte's bird a bird that could fly. And all accounts would be settled. In matters of the heart. Matters of the heart
mountains o' things,"The life I've always wanted. I guess I'll never have. I'll be working for somebody else. Until I'm in my grave. I'll be dreaming of a life of ease. And mountains o'things. To have a big expensive car. Drag my furs on the ground. And have a maid that I can tell. To bring me anything. Everyone will look at me with envy and with greed. I'll revel in their attention. And mountains. Oh mountains o'things. Sweet lazy life. Champagne and caviar. I hope you'll come and find me. Cause you know we are. Those who deserve the best in life. And know what money's worth. And those whose sole misfortune. Was having mountains o' nothing at birth. Oh they tell me. There's still time to save my soul. They tell me. Renouce all. Renouce all those material things you gained by. Exploiting other human beings. Consume more than you need. This is the dream. Make your pauper. Or make you queen. I won't die lonely. I'll have it all prearranged. A grave that's deep and wide enough. For me and all my mountains o' things. Mostly I feel lonely. Good good people are. Good people are only. My stepping stones. It's gonna take all my mountains o' things. To surround me. Keep all my enemies away. Keep my sadness and loneliness at bay. I'll be dreaming, dreaming, dreaming..... Dreaming...."
never yours,NEVER YOURS. Say I have known some. Less than I should. Say I have known some. Too well for my own good. Say I'm a saint of mercy. Say I'm a whore. I've been a lot of things. But never yours. I wear my mama's dress. Her finest clothes. Daddy showed me outside. To meet you on the front porch. I laugh at all your jokes. But you look bored. I've been a lot of things but never yours. You never cross my mind. You can be sure. You'll never catch my eye. Waiting for you watching the door. I let you hold me. Dry lip kiss me on the dance hall floor. I've been a lot of things. But never yours. Never yours. Never yours. Never yours. Never yours. Never yours. Never yours. Never yours. Never yours. So you say you won. It was a bet. A game of pool or cards. I repay my family's debt. I let you lie beside me. With no remorse. I've been a lot of things. But never yours. Say I have known some. Less than I should. Say I have known some. Too well for my own good. Say I'm a saint of mercy. Say I'm a whore. I've been a lot of things. But never yours. © 2001 Tracy Chapman

We need to make new symbols. Make new signs. Make a new language. With these we'll define the world. And start all over. Start all over. Start all over. Start all over ..."
nothing yet,Good times and bad. Seen them both. Hope fly out the window. Fortune walk through the door. Learned not to believe. This is as good as it gets. Because we ain't seen nothing yet. Hands untied. But the same shuffle once again. Running all the time. Ain't going nowhere. It's a new page in the same book. It's a new game with the same rules. The lights go down. Fade to black on the set. And we ain't seen nothing yet. Saddled with bonds. Broken and in disrepair. Forty acres to a forty-ounce. Don't seem fair. The sirens rise and wail. Shadowed by Liberty's torch. As the boats that brought us over. Are slowly sinking off the shore. And we ain't seen nothing yet. This life a crime. A blessing and a curse. Chosen and unwanted. Displaced and usurped. I'd run away. But there is nowhere to go. So I'll stand and fight. And hope and pray. That the best is yet to come. And we ain't seen nothing yet
oh holy night,"Oh, Holy Night. The stars. Are brightly shining. It is the night of the dear. Saviour's birth. Long lay the world in sin. And error pining. 'Til He appeared. And the soul felt. It's worth a thrill of hope. The weary world rejoices. For yonder breaks a new. And glorious morn. Fall on your knees. Oh, hear the angel voices. Oh, night divine. Oh, night. When Christ was born. Oh, night divine. Oh night. Oh, Holy night. Fall on your knees. Oh, hear the angel voices. Oh, night divine. Oh, night. When Christ was born. Oh, night divine. Oh, night. Oh, Holy night"

So over in love with you. I don't even care. Hot sun shines. And lays bare. Shadows cross cut. Heavy air. So over in love with you. I don't even care. The tide that washes in and out.

paper and ink,Touched the mirror. Broke the surface of the water. Saw my true self. All illusions shattered. Money's only paper only ink. We'll destroy ourselves if we can't agree. How the world turns. Who made the sun. Who owns the sea. The world we know will fall piece by piece. Sat down up close to the colored black hole. Like they'd always told me not to. Saw the one dimension polka dot pacifier. And all illusions shattered. Money's only paper only ink. We'll destroy ourselves if we can't agree. How the world turns. Who made the sun. Who owns the sea. The world we know will fall piece by piece. Bared myself wholly heart and body unadorned. Stripped down solely. To the evil and the good. Felt no shame. Naked to the world. And all illusions shattered. Money's only paper only ink. We'll destroy ourselves if we can't agree. How the world turns. Who made the sun. Who owns the sea. The world we know will fall piece by piece. Faced towards the sea. Looked to heaven up above. Felt the world revolve around me. No one could tell me otherwise. But the turbulent waters won't reflect this life. Only the sun the moon and sky. And all illusions shattered. Money's only paper only ink. We'll destroy ourselves if we can't agree. How the world turns. Who made the sun. Who owns the sea. The world we know will fall piece by piece. Money's only paper only ink
remember the tinman,"There are locks on the doors. And chains stretched across all the entries to the inside. There's a gate and a fence. And bars to protect from only God knows what lurks outside. Who stole your heart left you with a space. That no one and nothing can fill. Who stole your heart who took it away. Knowing that without it you can't live. Who took away the part so essential to the whole. Left you a hollow body. Skin and bone. What robber what thief who stole your heart and the key. Who stole your heart. The smile from your face. The innocence the light from your eyes. Who stole your heart or did you give it away. And if so then when and why. Who took away the part so essential to the whole. Left you a hollow body. Skin and bone. What robber what thief. Who stole your heart and the key. Now all sentiment is gone. Now you have no trust in no one. Who stole your heart. Did you know but forget the method and moment in time. Was it a trickster using mirrors and sleight of hand. A strong elixir or a potion that you drank. Who hurt your heart. Bruised it in a place. That no one and nothing can heal. You've gone to wizards, princes and magic men. You've gone to witches, the good the bad the indifferent. But still all sentiment is gone. But still you have no trust in no one. If you can tear down the walls. Throw your armor away remove all roadblocks barricades. If you can forget there are bandits and dragons to slay. And don't forget that you defend an empty space. And remember the tinman. Found he had what he thought he lacked. Remember the tinman. Go find your hear and take it back. Who stole your heart. Maybe no one can say. One day you will find it I pray"

smoke and ashes,"I'd heard rumors and I'd heard talk. About the trail you'd left of broken hearts. About the sea of tears too wide to cross. But a little bad press has never scared me off. So I burned a path to figure out. How to get me some of what you got. I've got a red hot heart. If the talk is true your's is the same. And we should be together. And let our passions fan love's flame. When I looked for you I almost passed you by. You were so cool and calm I thought my friends had lied. But I thought so much reserve must make you wild inside. It was there and then that I knew I had to get some of what you got. I've got a red hot heart. If the talk is true your's is the same. And we should be together. And let our passions fan love's flame. I thought I'd won your heart when I held you hand in mine. I thought it was true love the way we complemented each other. But my right is your wrong. And when you're right then I'm left with nothing. Your light and your heat have all been spent. Leaving only smoke and ashes. Only smoke and ashes baby. I've got a red hot heart. Any your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins. I say there's fire down below. You say it's only smoke and ashes baby. I'm crying all the time. Salty stinging tears. And mourning for the past carbon-dated years. But knowing now for certain that you were always right. Because if a breeze could blow you out of my life. It's only smoke and ashes baby. Only smoke and ashes baby. I've got a red hot heart. And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins. I say there's fire down below. You say it's only smoke and ashes baby. I was blinded by devotion. My unwavering love for you. So blinded that I thought all your lies were true. But now I know for certain since you've gone away. It was just a smoldering fire I mistook for a blaze. Only smoke and ashes baby. I've got a red hot heart. And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins. I say there's fire down below. You say it's only smoke and ashes baby. Only smoke and ashes baby, baby ..."
so,So you make a little money. Off of somebody else's sweat. So some people starve a little. While you get fat. While you get fat. So you grind and grind. And you push and shove. And claim that those most worthy. Will get what they deserve. What they deserve. It can't be true. It can't be true. Because I've seen too many hungry faces. I've seen too many with the likes of you. It can't be true. For you everything has it's price. You give nothing away for free. If silence were truly golden. I guess no one could sleep. No one could sleep. You have money at your fingertips. People at your beck and call. And you're fool enough. To think for a price. You can have the whole wide world. For all our sake's. And all our lives. We must hope the words. That come from your lips. We must hope those words are lies. For all our sake's. And all our lives. We must hope the dreams. Soulless visions that you have. Are never realized. So. You've got a big house. And you drive a fancy car. So what if your pockets are full. If you have an empty heart. You snap your fingers. And all the waters part. So what if the people bow down. If they show you no regard. Your left hand. Always watches your right. So what if you trust in God. If you can't sleep at night. You think you've made it. You think you've got what everyone wants. So what if you're a big fat man. With an empty little heart. Who has made a little money. Off of somebody else's sweat. Who watched the people starve. While you got fat. While you got fat. You got fat. You got fat

I’m at the mercy of the world. I guess I’m lucky to be alive. They say we’ve fallen through the cracks. They say the system works. But we won’t let it. Help. I guess they never stop to think. We might not just want handouts. But a way to make an honest living. Living this ain’t living. What did I do deserve this. Had my trust in god. Worked everyday of my life. Thought I had some guarantees. That’s what I thought. At least that’s what I thought. Last night I had another restless sleep. Wondering what tomorrow might bring. Last night I dreamed. A cold blue light was shining down on me. I screamed myself awake. Thought I must be dying. Thought I must be dying

Abandoned alone. The end. Soon to come. As the last person. On Earth. As. The waters rise. At the end. Of the world. Thought I bear. The weight. Of the rock. And the dirt. I know. I'm worthy. Of your love. As. The last person. On the Earth. As the water rise. At the end. Of the world. Thought I bear. The weight. Of the rock. And the dirt. I know. I'm worthy. Of your love. As the last person. On the Earth
the love that you had,The love that you had. In your heart is gone. Any touch of sincerity. Any trace of compassion. What hardened your heart?. What turned it to stone?. What made you forget?. You were in love with someone. Your hands don't reach out. Your voice doesn't call me. I know you've stopped listening. Your eyes look straight through me. If nights are like this. I'd rather be alone. Who said you could forget. You were in love with someone?. Tell me what hardened your heart. Tell me what turned it to stone. Tell me what made you forget. You were in love with someone. Was I wrong to forgive. Your indiscretions?. Should I have been more hysterical. Less understanding?. If you're looking for a villain. Go on assume the role. But don't say that it's my fault. That you're not in love with someone. Tell me what hardened your heart. Tell me what turned it to stone. Tell me what made you forget. You were in love with someone. Tell me there's someone in your life. I'll fight to keep your for my own. Tell me because I really want to know. Why you can't be in love with someone
the only one,She was the only one. Of my flesh and blood. Now I have no calling. I can do no worldly good. I sit silent. I sit mourning. I sit listless all the day. I've mostly lost the voice to speak. And any words to say except. Does heaven have enough angels yet?. I've gone hard. And I've gone cold. I can't make the piece of this cracked life fit. Please forgive me for wanting to know. Does heaven have enough angels yet?. She was the only one. Of my own flesh and blood. Sometimes I hear her calling. Straight from the house of god
the promise,"If you wait for me then I'll come for you. Although I've travelled far. I always hold a place for you in my heart. If you think of me, if you miss me once in awhile. Then I'll return to you, I'll return and fill that space in your heart. Remembering your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace. I'll find my way back to you. If you'll be waiting. If you dream of me like I dream of you. In a place that's warm and dark. In a place where I can feel the beating of your heart. Remembering your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace. I'll find my way back to you. If you'll be waiting. I've longed for you and I have desired to see your face, your smile. To be with you wherever you are. Remembering your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace. I'll find my way back to you. Please say you'll be waiting. Together again. It would feel so good to be in your arms. Where all my journeys end. You can make a promise, if it's one that you can keep. I vow to come for you, if you'll wait for me. Say you'll hold a place for me in your heart"
the rape of the world,Mother of us all. Place of our birth. How can we stand aside. And watch the rape of the wold. This the beginning of the end. This the most heinous of crimes. This the deadliest of sins. The greatest violation of all time. Mother of us all. Place of our birth. We all are witness. To the rape of the world. You've seen her stripped mined. You've heard of bombs exploded underground. You know the sun shines. Hotter than ever before. Mother of us all. Place of our birth. We all are witness. To the rape of the world. Some claim to have crowned her. A queen. With cities of concrete and steel. But there is no glory no honor. In what results. From the rape of the world. Mother of us all. Place of our birth. We all are witness. To the rape of the world. She has been clear-cut. She has been dumped on. She has been poisoned and beaten up. And we have been witness. To the rape of the world. Mother of us all. Place of our birth. How can we stand aside. And watch the rape of the world. If you look you'll see it with your own eyes. If you listen you will hear her cries. If you care you will stand and testify. And stop the rape of the world. Stop the rape of the world. Mother of us all. Mother of us all. Mother of us all. Mother of us all
thinking of you,I used to think. About what's real and true. What can not be proven. What can be assumed. Once when I was younger. In the bloom of youth. I received an honest answer. When a lie would do. Chorus:. And now all I do is sit. In my darkened room. And on accasion break my silence. To howl at the moon. To curse every nerve. And neuron in my brain. That won't stop the pain I'm feeling. And let me stop thinking. I used to think. Galileo would agree. That the world was round. And you'd come round to me. But I have looked for you. And you're nowhere in sight. The world must be flat. The Babylonians were right. [Chorus]. I used to think. Consider gravity. If I placed you on a pedestal. You'd slip and fall for me. But you floated on the air. Far away at light speed. I guess some objects do defy. The laws that we conceive. [Chorus]. I used to think. It took all my time. Analysing you. Your mind on my mind. Your name my mantra. Repeated on my lips. That once tried to kiss you. A memory unrepressed. [Chorus]. Stop thinking of you. Stop thinking of you. Stop thinking of you
this time,This time. I wont show I'm vulnerable. This time. I won't give in first. This time. I will hold out with my love. This time. I will not be hurt. I'm gonna love myself. More than anyone else. I'm gonna treat me right. I'm gonna make you say. That you love me first. And you'll be the one. with the most to lose tonight. This time. I'm gonna keep my heart locked safe inside. This time. I'm gonna be the one. To win your love. your affection. To hide my fear of rejection. This time.
three little birds,"Don't worry about a thing. 'Cause every little thing gonna be all right. Singin': ""Don't worry about a thing. 'Cause every little thing gonna be all right!"". Rise up this mornin'. Smiled with the risin' sun. Three little birds. Pitch by my doorstep. Singin' sweet songs. Of melodies pure and true. Sayin', ""This is my message to you-ou-ou:"". Singin': ""Don't worry 'bout a thing,. 'Cause every little thing gonna be all right."". Singin': ""Don't worry (don't worry) 'bout a thing,. 'Cause every little thing gonna be all right!"". Rise up this mornin',. Smiled with the risin' sun,. Three little birds. Pitch by my doorstep. Singin' sweet songs. Of melodies pure and true. Sayin', ""This is my message to you-ou-ou:"". Singin': ""Don't worry about a thing, worry about a thing, oh!. Every little thing gonna be all right"
unsung psalm,There would be psalms sung by a choir. I would have a white robe a halo newly acquired. I'd be at peace and I'd have no desire. If I'd lived right. There would be cherubs with tiny harps arrows and bows. I'd have a halo and a flowing white robe. I'd be enfolded by a celestial light. If I'd lived right. But I'm feeling hot and bothered under the collar. I feel the sweat breaking out on my brow. I feel the heat and I know it's the passion. The love I can't disavow. If this is a dream wake me up now. If this is a movie let's edit these scenes out. It would be a PG instead of an X-rated life. If I'd lived right. Some would call me a cheat call me a liar. Say that I've been defeated by the basest desires. Yes I have strayed and succumbed to my vices. But I tried to live right. But I have no regrets no guilts in my heart. I only feel sadness for any pain that I've caused. I guess I wouldn't bother to worry at all. If I'd lived right. Do you live by the book do you play by the rules?. Do you care what is thought by others about you?. If this day is all that is promised to you. Do you live for the future the present the past?. If there is one thing I know I know I will die. If anyone cares some stranger may critique my life. I may be revered or defamed and decried. But I tried to live right. There would be psalms sung by a choir. I would have a white robe a halo newly acquired. I'd be at peace and I'd have no desire. If I'd lived right
wedding song,I've been having dreams and visions. In them you are always standing. Right beside me. I reach out for your hand. To see your arms extending. outstretched towards me. For you I don the veil. By your light. Others pale by comparison. I place my faith in love. My fate in this communion. I've been having dreams and visions. In them you are always standing. Right beside me. I reach out for your hand. To see your arms extending. Outstretched towards me. To you I give my pledge. I honor all that's good. In this life we're living. To think not only of myself. But of the greater union. Can I get a witness. There is salvation and rapture for the lonely. Can I get a witness. Bless this day sacred and holy. Sacred and Holy. I've been having dreams and visions. In them you are always standing. Right beside me. I reach out for your hand. To see your arms extending. Outstretched towards me. With you I am revealed. All my shame all my faults and virtues. Behold body mind and spirit. Heart and soul devoted all to you. Can I get a witness. Bless this day sacred and holy. Sacred and Holy
why,Why ?. Why do the babies starve. When there's enough food to feed the world. Why when there're so many of us. Are there people still alone. Why are the missiles called peace keepers. When they're aimed to kill. Why is a woman still not safe. When she's in her home. Love is hate. War is peace. No is yes. And we're all free. But somebody's gonna have to answer. The time is coming soon. Admidst all these questions and contradictions. There're some who seek the truth. But somebody's gonna have to answer. The time is coming soon. When the blind remove their blinders. And the speechless speak the truth.
woman's work,Early in the morning she rises. The woman's work is never done. And it's not because she doesn't try. She's fighting a battle with no one on her side. She rises up in the morning. And she works 'til way past dusk. The woman better slow down. Or she's gonna come down hard. Early in the morning she rises. The woman's work is never done
you're the one,Some say you're crazy. Say that you're no good. Say your family's cursed with bad blood. But I think you're cute and misunderstood. And I wouldn't change you if I could. Let'em talk you down. Call you names. My mind's made up. It ain't gonna change. I'm sure in my heart. Happy and free. You're the one you're the one. You're the one for me. Some say you're bitter. Think you're mean. Uncouth untamed and unrestrained. But I think you're sensitive and sweet. Stay as you are don't change a thing. Let'em talk you down. Call you names. My mind's made up. It ain't gonna change. I'm sure in my heart. Happy and free. You're the one you're the one. You're the one for me. Some say you're bawdy. Wicked and wild. A restless useless juvenile. But I think you're funny and I like your smile. Want to be with you want you to stay awhile. Let'em talk you down. Call you names. My mind's made up. It ain't gonna change. I'm sure in my heart. Happy and free. You're the one you're the one. You're the one for me. A no 'count mixed up. Amount to nothing. A day away from a bum on the street. Some low class kind of royalty. That's what they say about you. When they're talking to me. Some say you're bad. A bad bad seed. You love to play with fire you love gambling. But I know what you love and I know what you need. And I like it when you play with me. Let'em talk you down. Call you names. My mind's made up. It ain't gonna change. I'm sure in my heart. Happy and free. You're the one you're the one. You're the one for me. I'm sure in my heart. Happy and free. You're the one you're the one. You're the one for me. . /lovelydoll
