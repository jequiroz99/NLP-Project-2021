You wanna leave it all behind. Take a little time. I need a reason why aaa. Baby you're the road that leads me home. The reason that my heart won't turn to stone. You told me that I'd never walk alone. You gotta help me understand. Take a little time. Baby tell me why. You wanna leave it all behind. Take a little time. I need a reason why. You wanna leave it all behind. You gotta take a little time. Because I need a reason why. You wanna leave it all behind. You have my love always. You're not alone..... You wanna leave it all behind.

sad song,"You got your clothes and your books and your empty smile. You took your time but you're finally out. Now I can breathe, I can dance, I can run amok. You think I'm cruel but you know that I'm right. 'Cause we were ordinary, bored and wary of the things we said. It ain't a crime to sing a sad song. One about love, now that it's gone. It ain't a crime to sing a sad song. One about us, now that we're done. You give me wings, give me life when you're not around. You were no good 'til I left you behind. You made me gray, just a face in another crowd. Now I'm alone and I'm one of a kind. Yeah we were ordinary, quiet contrary to a stormy daze. It ain't a crime to sing a sad song. One about love, now that it's gone. It ain't a crime to sing a sad song. One about us, now that we're done. And I knew that we were wrong, but you needed me to move you along. And I know we didn't belong together. We were ordinary, bored and wary of the things we said. It ain't a crime to sing a sad song. One about love, now that it's gone. It ain't a crime to sing a sad song. One about us, now that we're done. It ain't a crime to sing a sad song. One about love, now that it's gone. It ain't a crime to sing a sad song. One about us, now that we're done. It ain't a crime to sing a sad song, one about love. Now that it's gone"

Out of the pouring rain, to face another pain... Why you so afraid of the other side?. It's just a big parade, it's people on display.. If one should stumble, imagine what the rest would say.. They're making harmless sounds.. Their heads go round and round.. Why do you stay away from the other side?. Now you have to believe in me.. I'll live Until The Day I die.. You have to believe in me.. I'll live Until The Day I die.. Until The Day I Die. You'll see me in the clouds, laughing a bit too loud.. You'll see me crying 'cause I'm too crazy to be proud.. Today I'll celebrate, tomorrow is too late.. I'll be out there pushing the boderline.. Postponing is a crime, who knows if I have time.. When this is over I hope I never walked the line.. So call me immature, at least I know I'm sure.. I'll be crossing over the boderline.. Now you have to believe in me.. I'll live Until The Day I die.. You have to believe in me.. I'll live Until The Day I die.. Until The Day I Die. (Have to Believe...). I hear everybody say that today is the day and. Sooner or later my luck is gotta change.. Well, that day is never near if you're. Living by you're fear.. Stand up and shout “You're Alive”. Until The Day I Die. Now you have to believe in me.. I'll live Until The Day I die..
