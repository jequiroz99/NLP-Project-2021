claustrophobic (feat. pell),"Just gotta be me. So many voices. Pj, you're not mainstream enough, yeah. Would you consider us changing some stuff. Like everything about who you are, ah. No offense, we're just trying to make you a star. But I must admit, I'm claustrophobic. I have a hard time trying to fit into your small mind. And I have a habit of dreaming bigger than anything. I can see right in front of me. Pj, you're not quite street enough. Thug life my nigga. Act a little more tough. Or, can you switch your style up a little more?. You can be yourself later. for now we need the radio. But I must admit, I'm claustrophobic. I have a hard time trying to fit into your small mind. And I have a habit of dreaming bigger than anything that. I can see right in front of me. Can't see, the forest for the trees. The movement for the breeze. Standing on my own feet. Can't see, what you might want from me. Think it's better if we be ourselves. They clutchin' to my talents more than Catholics do a rosary. Steady ask, where that accent traveled?. You from New Orleans?. Gold soul, why I dabble with negative energy. When all I really fiend is a posi-sensibility. Not the hardest rapper. but I'm 'bout it much as Master P. Don't play with me, 504 my home. Don't you know that. Flooding through the streets. You should probably take a Kodak. Photosynthesize probably right in front yo' eyes. Made a trip to Cali and came back a different guy. Living through the same eyes, riding Uber, still got drive. Been the truest never lie and I need a little space. 'Cause I'm better doing me. Just recite if you relate. I'm claustrophobic. I have a hard time to fit into your small mind. And I have a habit of dreaming. Bigger than anything. I can see right in front of me. Another man, just gotta be you. I think that the thing makes us unique. It's our differences with our treasures. Somebody always tryna make you fit in a box. And never seen again, don't think it's possible"

claustrophobic (feat. pell),"Just gotta be me. So many voices. Pj, you're not mainstream enough, yeah. Would you consider us changing some stuff. Like everything about who you are, ah. No offense, we're just trying to make you a star. But I must admit, I'm claustrophobic. I have a hard time trying to fit into your small mind. And I have a habit of dreaming bigger than anything. I can see right in front of me. Pj, you're not quite street enough. Thug life my nigga. Act a little more tough. Or, can you switch your style up a little more?. You can be yourself later. for now we need the radio. But I must admit, I'm claustrophobic. I have a hard time trying to fit into your small mind. And I have a habit of dreaming bigger than anything that. I can see right in front of me. Can't see, the forest for the trees. The movement for the breeze. Standing on my own feet. Can't see, what you might want from me. Think it's better if we be ourselves. They clutchin' to my talents more than Catholics do a rosary. Steady ask, where that accent traveled?. You from New Orleans?. Gold soul, why I dabble with negative energy. When all I really fiend is a posi-sensibility. Not the hardest rapper. but I'm 'bout it much as Master P. Don't play with me, 504 my home. Don't you know that. Flooding through the streets. You should probably take a Kodak. Photosynthesize probably right in front yo' eyes. Made a trip to Cali and came back a different guy. Living through the same eyes, riding Uber, still got drive. Been the truest never lie and I need a little space. 'Cause I'm better doing me. Just recite if you relate. I'm claustrophobic. I have a hard time to fit into your small mind. And I have a habit of dreaming. Bigger than anything. I can see right in front of me. Another man, just gotta be you. I think that the thing makes us unique. It's our differences with our treasures. Somebody always tryna make you fit in a box. And never seen again, don't think it's possible"
