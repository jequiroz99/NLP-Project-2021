i'll follow you into the dark,Love of mine some day you will die. But I'll be close behind. I'll follow you into the dark. No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white.

When your soul embarks. Then I'll follow you into the dark. You and me have seen everything to see. From Bangkok to Calgary. And the soles of your shoes are all worn down. The time for sleep is now. It's nothing to cry about. Cause we'll hold each other soon. The blackest of rooms. If heaven and hell decide. That they both are satisfied. Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs. If there's no one beside you. When your soul embarks. Then I'll follow you into the dark. Then I'll follow you into the dark
