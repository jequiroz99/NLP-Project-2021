she came in through the bathroom window,"Oh look out. She came in through the bathroom window. Protected by a silver spoon. But now she sucks her thumb and wonders. By the banks of her own lagoon. Didn't anybody tell her?. Didn't anybody see?. Sunday's on the phone to monday. Tuesday's on the phone to me. She said she'd always been a dancer. She worked at fifteen clubs a day. And though she thought I knew the answer. Well I knew but I could not say. And so I quit the police department. And got myself a steady job. And though she tried her best to help me. She could steal, but she could not rob. Didn't anybody tell her?. Didn't anybody see?. Sunday's on the phone to monday. Tuesday's on the phone to me"
