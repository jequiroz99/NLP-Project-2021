I kept telling myself that I have not even one memory of you left. repeat *. Its really late. You already left. But I can't forget you. I believed that I forgot you. But really, I believed that you'd surely come back. Maybe I have to hate you and miss you 'til the end. When you left, I had a harder time. Please come back to me baby.

memories (won't let go),"these days i feel it all. every corner of my mind. the weekends at the mall. your sunday morning calls. walkin' through the park, happily as we go. that night we swore we had the nicest time so i. knew you were the one, you had to be the one. hoping you and i would never ever see wrong. slowly you were hard to see. who wouldn't i'se worry. you leavin' before my eyes. i'm telling you now i cannot lie. [chorus]. no matter how i try, oh. these memories wont let go. inside of me much sorrow. and i cannot pretend, it's killing me, ya know?. seems like i'll never find that time for moving on. lord knows i'm only human. can't help what i'm doin'. trying to get by these memories of my own. [vrs2]. so unbelievably real this can't be happening. we've shared too much of us. love i thought it was. but shame on silly me, for having such a heart of-. care trust and harmony that's what i'm living for. i see no other road.. that's what i've been told. at times i still deny- it wasn't meant to be, no. slowly it can possibly. you're right, now, who am i joking?. you leaving before my eyes. i'll tell you again i cannot lie. [[chorus]]. no matter how i try, oh. these memories wont let go. inside of me much sorrow. and i cannot pretend, it's killing me, ya know?. seems like i'll never find that time for moving on. lord knows i'm only human. can't help what i'm doin'. trying to get by these memories of my own. [bridge]. from now i'll tell myself i can do it. it won't be easy but i'll get through it. just look ahead and put the past behind for me. and believe though my heart's been broken. everything is gonna be all right. [[[chorus]]]. no matter how i try, oh. these memories wont let go. inside of me much sorrow. and i cannot pretend, it's killing me, ya know?. seems like i'll never find that time for moving on. lord knows i'm only human. can't help what i'm doin'. trying to get by these memories of my own.
