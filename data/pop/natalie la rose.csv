Y'know I'm blind so why d'you disagree. Take me away cos I just don't want to stay. And the lies you make me say. Are getting deeper every day. These are crazy days but they make me shine.

the right song,"Feel it in my bones. This anticipation. See him through the smoke. So hard to be patient. There is a clock in mind. We running out of time. Killing it goes so easily. I want to feel him breathe. I want his hands on me. You know there's just one thing I need. You know there's just one thing I need. Just one thing I need, I need, I need, I need, I need. Alright. Come on, lift me with the right song. I've been waiting for it all night, baby. Before they turn the lights on, yeah. Come on, lift me with the right, ight, ight, ight song. Run that bass, run that bass. Through my veins. Come and take me away, take me away. Alright. Come on, lift me with the right song. Come on, lift me with the right, ight, ight, ight song. Don't know where this goes. I let the wind take me. Into the unknown. No more hesitating. There is a clock in mind. We running out of time. Killing it goes so easily. I want to feel him breathe.
