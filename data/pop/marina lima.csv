blue skies,Blue skies smiling at me. Nothing but blue skies. Do I see. Blue days all of them gone. Nothing but blue skies. From now on. I? ve never seen the sun shining so bright. Never saw things go? in so right. Noticing the days hurrien by. When your in love my how they fly. Blue birds singing a song. Nothing but blue skies. From now on
call me,"If you're feelin' sad and lonely. there's a service I can render. Tell the one who loves you only. I can be so warm and tender. Call me, don't be afraid, you can call me. Maybe It's late but just call me. Tell me and I'll be around. When it seems your friends desert you. there's somebody thinking of you. I'm the one who never hurt you. Maybe that's because I love you. Call me, don't be afraid, you can call me. Maybe It's late but just call me. Tell me and I'll be around. If you call I'll be right with you. You and I should be together. Take this love I long to give you. I'll be at your side forever. Call me, don't be afraid, you can call me. Maybe It's late but just call me. Tell me and I'll be around"
hearts,Is everything all right. I just called to say. How lost I feel without you. Miles away. I really can't believe I'm here and. How I still care about you. Hearts can break. Are never mend together. Love can fade away. Hearts cap cry. When love won't stay forever. Hearts can be that way. Is everything the same. Do you ever think of me. And how we loved one another. Will you change your mind?. Will you have me back again. Or have you found yourself a new lover. Is everything ok. I just thought I'd write a song. To tell world how I miss you. 'cause each every day. I think of all the words I never said. All the chances that I had to. Hearts can break
it's not enough,It? s not enough. To hold the world im my arms for the night. I? d have nothing. No reason to write. It? s not enough. To hold the key to the stars and the heavens. If heaven is just a place. In space. All of these plans I have made. And lands I? ve laid to waste. These crazy dangers. I? ve been all too willing to face. When love was all I ever wanted?. It? s not enough. To watch the wheels as they spin in your mind. I? m blind. If I can? t see the heaven. In your eyes
keep walkin',I walk down the line. I feel I'm alive. The warmth of the brave. Has kept me awake. So now my dear. No more tears. The wind hits my face. It shivers inside. And whispers my trace. I've nothing to hide. So now my dear. No more fears. How awake must one be. To feel the light shine on thee?. Answers to come in a while. To brighten the pile. Of doubts and regrets. One's kept in the nest. So now my dear It's oh So clear. Keep walkin'
nightie night,Love. As we close our eyes. Nightie Night. Love. Whisper no goodbyes. Nightie night. Night. The night is an ocean. Where love can get lost at sea. Good night. When you awaken. I pray you'll remember me. Love. As you fall asleep. Nightie night. My love. Don't you fall too deep. Nightie night. Night. The night is a desert. A desert that we must cross. Good night. I pray that this moment. Will never be lost. Never be lost?
only you,Only you. Can make this world seem right. Only you. Can make the darkness bright. Only you. And you alone. Can treat me like you do. And fill my heart with love for. Only you. Only you. Can make this change in me. For it? s true. You are my destiny. When you hold my hand. I understand the magic that you do. You? re my dream come true. My one and only you
stay,"I can bear clouds in my sunny days. I'm not hurt by years drifting away. I never fear when you are near. Please baby stay. Some nights may seem long, sulky and grey. But held in your arms I'm sheltered and safe. Soft velvet touch I miss so much. Please baby stay. I know life ain't always fair. But can't you see that together we can. Make it easier to bear. I'll live without champagne ou pat√©. But far from your touch I'm led astray. Wonderful things easily grow winds. So please baby stay"
