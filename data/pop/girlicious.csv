Every scribe and every scholar. No winners in this debate. Everybody seems to stand up taller. When you're easy to explain. I don't need to know what I don't know. Just got to let it go. Be real to me now. That's all I'm asking. Be real somehow. More than anything. More than anything. So lay down the sword. And put away the doctrine. Love a little more, love a little more. 'Cause everybody's broken"

the way we were,"Memories. Like the corners of my mind. Misty water-colored. Memories. Of the way we were. Scattered pictures. Of the smiles we left behind. Smiles we gave to one another. For the way we were. Can it be that. It was all so simple then. Or has time rewritten every line. If we had the chance to do it all again. Tell me, would we, could we. Memories may be beautiful and yet. What's too painful to remember. We simply choose to forget. So it's the laughter we will remember. Whenever we remember. The way we were, the way we were. I would not replace. Or erase all our memories. Lessons given to us we learned so unselfishly. So take this moment. Take an extra breath. With respect. For our time. Can't rewind. What's just meant to be. But now we gotta move on. We gotta stay strong. Celebrating us all night long. No regrets, don't forget. That our time together. Was truly beautiful. These memories will live forever"
