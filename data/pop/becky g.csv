A few blocks from the Englewood cemetery. I lived through hard times, according to my memory. Then I learned to rhyme like I'm reading up the dictionary. I still walk to the Kelso Market. Even though I get to walk them red carpets. My family lived in my grampa's garage. So I started working just to help out my pops. It all started when my grandpa crossed over. Now one day I might be a crossover. Right now it's just who is that girl?. But one day Imma be all around the world. I still get grounded, always stay grounded. Still do chores even when I'm on tour. One thing's for sure, Ima always be me. That what's up? Becky, Becky, Becky G. I won't stop till I get to the top. I'm so I'm so Becky from the block. Always had a little, but I want a lot.

No matter where I go I know where I came from. You what you know about the in and out lines. And what you know about that 4×5 drive. My life is changing quickly right before my eyes. It hits me every time that I'm on Hollywood divine. If you wanna date me, you gotta ask my Daddy. And my 30 uncles, you can meet them in an alley!. And one day Ima bring home a Grammy. But no matter what I'll be bringing home randies. Donuts,so what,holler when you see me. I'm still the same B, even when I'm on TV. Still rocking Js with my diamonds and pearls. You can take me out the hood, but not the hood out of the girl. Yes I love sushi, love my calamari. But ain't no better chef than my very own mommy. If you can't catch me warming in my barrio. I'm with my litas praying the Rosario. Englewood, Englewood, Englewood. I won't stop till I get to the top. I'm so I'm so Becky from the block. Always had a little, but I want a lot.

And I was naive and yes I believe. All the B. S that he was telling to me. Taken without but I was wrong. He didn't know what he had till I was gone. I hope she was worth it, he had me cursing.
