hey jude,"Hey, Jude, don't make it bad. Take a sad song and make it better. Remember to let her into your heart. Then you can start to make it better. Hey, Jude, don't be afraid. You were made to go out and get her. The minute you let her under your skin. Then you begin to make it better. And anytime you feel the pain. Hey, Jude, refrain. Don't carry the world. Upon your shoulders. Well you know that it's a fool. Who plays it cool. By making his world a little colder. Na na na na na na na na na. Hey, Jude, don't make it bad.

reacender (shine),"Vai amanhecer. A luz. Já vem. E a sombra da tristeza se desfaz. Shine your light and then,. I will believe that love could find us one last time. Vou tentando te esquecer. Em cada lugar. E as horas passam devagar. Insistindo em perguntar. De nós. Por que?. A vida inteira pra lembrar. Você.... Shine your light again,. shine down, oh please. I am darkness til you look at me. Vai reacender. Manhã. Que traz. Eu e você uma vez mais. And did you think i would forget?. Or that i didn't care,when to me you're everywhere?. And to be there by your side. I just close my eyes. I'm still blinded by the light when you shine. E a esperança ainda mora em mim. Sobrevive em teu olhar. I didn't know what it could mean until now. Shine your light again,. shine down, oh please. I am darkness til you look at me. Vai reacender. Manhã. Que traz. Eu e você uma vez mais. that love could find us one last time. Num novo dia ter. Você. You shine"
she's leaving home,Wednesday morning at 5 o' clock as the day begins. Silently closing her bedroom door. Leaving the note that she hoped would say more. She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief. Quietly turning the back door key. Stepping outside she is free. She (we gave her most of our lives). is leaving (sacrifice most of our lives). home (we gave her everything money could buy). She's leaving home after living alone for so many years (bye bye). Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown. Picks up the letter that's lying there. Standing alove at the top of the stairs. She breaks down and cries to her husband. Daddy our baby's gone. Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly. How could she do this to me. She (we never thought of ourselves). is leaving (never a thought for ourselves). home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by). She's leaving home after living alone for so many years (bye bye). Friday morning at 9 o' clock she is far away. Waiting to keep the appointment she made. Meeting a man from the motor trade. She (what did we do that was wrong). is having (we didn't know it was wrong). fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy). Something inside that was always denied for so many years (bye bye). She's leaving home (bye bye).
sk8er boi (cover avril lavigne),He was a boy. She was a girl. Can I make it anymore obvious?. He was a punk. She did ballet. What more can I say?. He wanted her. She'd never tell. Secretly she wanted him as well. But all of her friends. Stuck up their nose. They had a problem with his baggy clothes. [Chorus]. He was a skater boy. She said see you later boy. He wasn't good enough for her. She had a pretty face. But her head was up in space. She needed to come back down to earth. Five years from now. She sits at home. Feeding the baby. She's all alone. She turns on tv. Guess who she sees?. Skater boy rockin' up MTV.. She calls up her friends. They already know. And they've all got tickets to see his show. She tags along. Stands in the crowd. Looks up at the man that she turned down. [Chorus]. He was a skater boy. She said see you later boy. He wasn't good enough for her. Now he's a superstar. Slammin' on his guitar. Does your pretty face see what he's worth?. He was a skater boy. She said see you later boy. He wasn't good enough for her. Now he's a superstar. Slammin' on his guitar. Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
what a wonderful world,"I see trees of green, red roses too. I see them bloom for me and you. And I think to myself what a wonderful world.. I see skies of blue and clouds of white. The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night. And I think to myself what a wonderful world.. The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky. Are also on the faces of people going by. I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do. They’re really saying I love you.. I hear babies crying, I watch them grow. They’ll learn much more than I’ll never know. And I think to myself what a wonderful world. Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world.. . by: Niih."
yesterday,All my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as thought they're here to stay. Oh I belive in yesterday. Suddenly. I'm not half the man I used to be. There's a shadow hanging over me. Oh yesterday came suddenly. Why she had to go I don't know. She wouldn't say. I said something wrong. Now I long for yesterday. Yesterday. Love was such an easy game to play. Now I need a place to hide away. Oh I belive in yesterday
