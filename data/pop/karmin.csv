23,Everyone has problems. No one wants to hear. Waiting for the elephant. In the room to disappear. Livin' up the home life. Without a single care. The silver spoon that fed me. Had always made life fair. But life will cycle through. Make you pay your dues. But now i see. Nothin' comes for free. 23. Why don't you come clean?. Please don't be mean. Growing up is hard on me. You never know the worth of. Something 'til it's gone. Sittin' here and prayin'. Nothing will go wrong. Youth is slowly wasted. As the time goes by. I still see the world. Through a child's eye. But life will cycle through. Make you pay your dues. But now i see. Nothin' comes for free. 23. Why don't you come clean?. Please don't be mean. Growing up is hard on me. I don't recall. I can barely remember. Wasting the time. Until september. Time caught up to me. When i woke up. 23. Why don't you come clean?. Please don't be mean. Growing up is hard on me. . .

inside out,"Started out pretending. With my good intentions on the line. When did I get locked in. When did I get stuck here wasting time. Try convincing yourself but you're not sure. If you're using your brain it's the hearts turn. Can’t you see, I’m just starting. To live life inside out. Can’t you see, I was faking. But now I’m all about. Inside out, inside out. No more outside looking in. Can’t you see I’m just trying. Working through the weekend. Make a living that won’t let me live. Say I got some time left. But they tell me time does not forgive. I was playing with fire so I got burned. But I've been using my brain it's the hearts turn. Chorus. Oh - I guess this life ain’t for me. Oh - I’m just the missing puzzle piece. Oh - my inside’s screaming out, to be free to be free"
let it go,"Perfection's only a game and just for losers. Addicted just to the chase, you’ll be a user. But try and take it from me, I played and never won. Your life will get in the way and make you humble. Oh life will make you so tall before you crumble. No don’t go fighting the tide, you’ll always be outdone. [chorus]. And though the rain falls outta the sky. Without a rhyme or reason why. Nobody says you gotta be dry. Let it go, let it go, let it go. And when the wind blows outta control. You gotta go with, go with the flow. Cause where it’s blowing nobody knows. Let it go, let it go, let it go. Some jokes are better when standing at a distance. So you can laugh with the rest without resistance. No don’t pretend that you’re safe ya life has other plans. Before you know it you find the joke is on ya. You gonna fight it or roll it off your shoulder?. Just take a minute and wait you gotta understand. Chorus. Never perfect the perfection. Life is meant to fail. Never forget your direction. Keep an open sail"
let's get lost,"I'm just a dreamer with my feet in the sand. Soaking the sun here in my paradise land. The tropical breeze keeps the sweat off my brow. Leaves me just as happy as my brain will allow. Let's get lost in a dream together. Let's get lost where there's nothing but good weather. Let's get lost in a dream together with our feet in the sand. In a paradise land. I'm just a dreamer where the tables' set for two. No one else around here except for me and you. Palm trees lean keeping us in the shade. And every, every time we leave here we only wish we could've stayed. Let's get lost in a dream together. Let's get lost where there's nothing but good weather. Let's get lost in a dream together with our feet in the sand. In a paradise land. I know I'm the one you want. While your dancing with me under the sun. I know I'm the only one. Cause it feels like it's only begun. And we'll dance for the stars when the sun has gone far away. Let's get lost in a dream together. Let's get lost where there's nothing but good weather. Let's get lost in a dream together with our feet in the sand. In a paradise land. . By: @LincolnAloisio [:"

Let them yell, point and tell. But your heart has all the power. Don't you know your love is louder. If you walk beside me now. Lift the load a couple pounds. Heavy hearts could never slow us down.

With Kim Kardashian's ass, get a flash. Of the passenger side of the Jaguar's dash. (I come through late like Dre with Detox. If these elite jocks, I'll say we're ewoks). Chumps with wee caps, pull up your knee socks. Then pump your Reeboks, then jump the tree tops. (Skintone fair, syndrome rare. The peasant isn't pleasant but the king don't care.

I survive, on the top. And I'm not gonna stop. So I gotta leave something, so I gotta leave something. Something to leave behind, something that I define. I just wanna be seen and heard. Something to freeze in time, something that I call mine. I just wanna be remembered. Secret's out, we're the same. Holding out in the pride game. Over time, colors fade. Nothing but age will claim. Where we've been, where we were. When I'm 6 feet under. What will be my legacy. It's all that I got. So I gotta leave something, so I gotta leave something. Something to leave behind, something that I define. I just wanna be seen and heard. Something to freeze in time, something that I call mine. I just wanna be remembered (2x). . . By: LincolnAloisio"
save me now,"Please save me now. I'm never gonna leave this town. I'll hang around. 'Til all the buildings crumble down. Stacking up my dreams inside. I watch another train go by. Can't find my ticket to ride. He was a good guy, bad lie, king of con artists. I think of those days with my heart in the harness. And you can presume that he was groomed to bloom. Assumed his doom and lacked in the cash to move. He was my broken Caddy daddy, stranger danger savvy. Killed my innocent first love when it ended badly. Three years and the grand finale. He called me drunk one night from his bachelor party. Said, ""I get married tomorrow. How are you doing? "". Said, ""I'm packing my baggage because my dreams are pursuing"". He said, ""I'm glad that you're happy. I'm starting a family. But maybe someday we could hook up in Miami"". Please save me now. I'm never gonna leave this town. I'll hang around. 'Til all the buildings crumble down. Stacking up my dreams inside. I watch another train go by. Can't find my ticket to ride. Sometimes a wrong feels right, and damn, the shit's vicious. A minute there, I thought love was fictitious. Like he was the one, I thought my life was done. I dropped the gun, broke out and began to run. I had no friends to carry me. My family scaring me. I felt the call of the city was daring me. To let it all go and forget the face. They probably tuned in for my rise to fame. He could be polishing tractors, I'm x-ing my factors. He could've come with if he had the adapters. I wish that I could've saved him or made my amends. But I don't really need it. Don't read it if you know how it ends. Please save me now. I'm never gonna leave this town. I'll hang around. 'Til all the buildings crumble down. Stacking up my dreams inside. I watch another train go by. Can't find my ticket to ride. When the train come 'round don't skip the tracks. Don't let nobody hold you back. Just ride, ride. When the train come 'round don't skip the tracks. Don't let nobody hold you back. Just ride, ride.

you can tell me,"Is it the traffic in the morning that starts to burn the fuse?. Is it another verbal warning that shrinks you in your shoes?.

When it's all said and done. You can tell me, you can tell me. At the end of the day, you can tell me. Is it the thoughtless words of others that shake you to the bone?. Do you just long for taking cover to hide this working drone?. Is it the empty inspiration or the fear of the unknown?. Is it the lack of motivation that keeps you from your goal?. Oh, trust me I've been there. No one thinks it's fair. When it's all said and done. You can tell me, you can tell me. At the end of the day, you can tell me (2x).

23,Everyone has problems. No one wants to hear. Waiting for the elephant. In the room to disappear. Livin' up the home life. Without a single care. The silver spoon that fed me. Had always made life fair. But life will cycle through. Make you pay your dues. But now i see. Nothin' comes for free. 23. Why don't you come clean?. Please don't be mean. Growing up is hard on me. You never know the worth of. Something 'til it's gone. Sittin' here and prayin'. Nothing will go wrong. Youth is slowly wasted. As the time goes by. I still see the world. Through a child's eye. But life will cycle through. Make you pay your dues. But now i see. Nothin' comes for free. 23. Why don't you come clean?. Please don't be mean. Growing up is hard on me. I don't recall. I can barely remember. Wasting the time. Until september. Time caught up to me. When i woke up. 23. Why don't you come clean?. Please don't be mean. Growing up is hard on me. . .

inside out,"Started out pretending. With my good intentions on the line. When did I get locked in. When did I get stuck here wasting time. Try convincing yourself but you're not sure. If you're using your brain it's the hearts turn. Can’t you see, I’m just starting. To live life inside out. Can’t you see, I was faking. But now I’m all about. Inside out, inside out. No more outside looking in. Can’t you see I’m just trying. Working through the weekend. Make a living that won’t let me live. Say I got some time left. But they tell me time does not forgive. I was playing with fire so I got burned. But I've been using my brain it's the hearts turn. Chorus. Oh - I guess this life ain’t for me. Oh - I’m just the missing puzzle piece. Oh - my inside’s screaming out, to be free to be free"

And though the rain falls outta the sky. Without a rhyme or reason why. Nobody says you gotta be dry. Let it go, let it go, let it go. And when the wind blows outta control. You gotta go with, go with the flow. Cause where it’s blowing nobody knows. Let it go, let it go, let it go. Some jokes are better when standing at a distance. So you can laugh with the rest without resistance. No don’t pretend that you’re safe ya life has other plans. Before you know it you find the joke is on ya. You gonna fight it or roll it off your shoulder?. Just take a minute and wait you gotta understand. Chorus. Never perfect the perfection. Life is meant to fail. Never forget your direction.

I'm just a dreamer where the tables' set for two. No one else around here except for me and you. Palm trees lean keeping us in the shade. And every, every time we leave here we only wish we could've stayed. Let's get lost in a dream together. Let's get lost where there's nothing but good weather. Let's get lost in a dream together with our feet in the sand. In a paradise land. I know I'm the one you want. While your dancing with me under the sun. I know I'm the only one. Cause it feels like it's only begun. And we'll dance for the stars when the sun has gone far away. Let's get lost in a dream together. Let's get lost where there's nothing but good weather. Let's get lost in a dream together with our feet in the sand. In a paradise land. . By: @LincolnAloisio [:"

Let them yell, point and tell. But your heart has all the power. Don't you know your love is louder. If you walk beside me now. Lift the load a couple pounds. Heavy hearts could never slow us down. Join the movement, let them talk. Move the mountains, let them watch. Never been a better time now. Words cut you down, steal your crown. But your heart has all the power.

save me now,"Please save me now. I'm never gonna leave this town. I'll hang around. 'Til all the buildings crumble down. Stacking up my dreams inside. I watch another train go by. Can't find my ticket to ride. He was a good guy, bad lie, king of con artists. I think of those days with my heart in the harness. And you can presume that he was groomed to bloom. Assumed his doom and lacked in the cash to move. He was my broken Caddy daddy, stranger danger savvy. Killed my innocent first love when it ended badly. Three years and the grand finale. He called me drunk one night from his bachelor party. Said, ""I get married tomorrow. How are you doing? "". Said, ""I'm packing my baggage because my dreams are pursuing"". He said, ""I'm glad that you're happy. I'm starting a family. But maybe someday we could hook up in Miami"". Please save me now. I'm never gonna leave this town. I'll hang around. 'Til all the buildings crumble down. Stacking up my dreams inside. I watch another train go by. Can't find my ticket to ride. Sometimes a wrong feels right, and damn, the shit's vicious. A minute there, I thought love was fictitious. Like he was the one, I thought my life was done. I dropped the gun, broke out and began to run. I had no friends to carry me. My family scaring me. I felt the call of the city was daring me. To let it all go and forget the face. They probably tuned in for my rise to fame. He could be polishing tractors, I'm x-ing my factors. He could've come with if he had the adapters. I wish that I could've saved him or made my amends. But I don't really need it. Don't read it if you know how it ends. Please save me now. I'm never gonna leave this town. I'll hang around. 'Til all the buildings crumble down. Stacking up my dreams inside. I watch another train go by. Can't find my ticket to ride. When the train come 'round don't skip the tracks. Don't let nobody hold you back. Just ride, ride. When the train come 'round don't skip the tracks. Don't let nobody hold you back. Just ride, ride.

Undivided attention to how your brow sweats. How can I trust you, I'll be losing all bets. It's gamble, I don't wanna pull yet. Paying me in jelly, beans in the belly. When you get nervous I can tell by the smelly. Do me Blue Bonnet, butter me up on it. You can toast love notes, I can burn sonnets. It's apparent I needed to say no. Throw a karat of diamonds on the floor. How can I trust you, all you want is more. I gotta bust you, this means war. You come around here flipping your tricks. I'm letting down my wall my bricks. Least you can do is riddle me this. What's in it for me?. What's in it for me. What's in it for me. What's in it for me. Doesn't matter how much you sugar the fluff. What's in it for me. What's in it for me. What's in it for me. Doesn't matter how much you sugar the fluff"
yesterday,"[Amy Heidemann]. I'm all out, I'm all out, I'm all out. I'm all out, I'm all out, I'm all out. I'm all out, I'm all out, I'm all out. I'm all out, I'm all out. Oh how I missed your eyes. Your half crooked smile. And the magic that you keep in your hands. But goodness, here we go again. Reality knows that I only wanna leave it behind. [Nick Noonan]. You say everytime, it's the final prime. But we needed the spark cause it's all that we got. See the world is tough on forbidden love. And I don't wanna go in alone. Oh, why you got to leave here tomorrow?. Don't you love me like yesterday?. Take my hand and leave all your sorrow. Everything can wait. Oh, why you got to leave here tomorrow?. Don't you love me like yesterday?. Take my hand and leave all your sorrow. Don't throw this away. [Amy Heidemann]. You said you're over this, the fights and the calls. And I thought that you and I had it planned. You told me you were done with her. But she's got the rock. Which is making this too complicated. [Nick Noonan]. You say everytime, it's the final prime. But we needed the spark cause it's all that we got. See the world is tough on forbidden love. And I don't wanna go in alone. Oh, why you got to leave here tomorrow?. Don't you love me like yesterday?. Take my hand and leave all your sorrow. Everything can wait. Oh, why you got to leave here tomorrow?. Don't you love me like yesterday?. Take my hand and leave all your sorrow. Don't throw this away. [Amy Heidemann]. Straight out, movie scene. No one with the camera, see. Doesn't matter what you say, matter what you do. Livin' on security screens. Late night, dancing queen. Hotel, stop machines. Deal that for me, Dominique. I don't know how long I'll be on a streak. Oh, why you got to leave here tomorrow?. Don't you love me like yesterday?. Take my hand and leave all your sorrow. Don't throw this away. Oh, why you got to leave here tomorrow?. Don't you love me like yesterday?. Take my hand and leave all your sorrow. Don't throw this away. [Amy Heidemann]. I'm all out, I'm all out, I'm all out. I'm all out, I'm all out, I'm all out. I'm all out, I'm all out, I'm all out. I'm all out. Ay, ¿por qué te vas a mañana?. ¿No me amas como ayer?. Toma mi mano y dejar sus penas. Todo esperar"
you can tell me,"Is it the traffic in the morning that starts to burn the fuse?. Is it another verbal warning that shrinks you in your shoes?. Is it the lines that eat your lunch break as the hour's flown on by?. Is it a lack of water headache when the wells have all gone dry?. Trust me I've been there. No one thinks it's fair. When it's all said and done. You can tell me, you can tell me. At the end of the day, you can tell me. Is it the thoughtless words of others that shake you to the bone?. Do you just long for taking cover to hide this working drone?. Is it the empty inspiration or the fear of the unknown?. Is it the lack of motivation that keeps you from your goal?. Oh, trust me I've been there. No one thinks it's fair. When it's all said and done. You can tell me, you can tell me. At the end of the day, you can tell me (2x). Dark skies and angry eyes are stirring up a storm. Your fears will reach my ears I'll keep you where it's warm. And I'm just fine to be listening for you. You can tell me, you can tell me. At the end of the day, you can tell me (2x). . . By: @LincolnAloisio [:"
