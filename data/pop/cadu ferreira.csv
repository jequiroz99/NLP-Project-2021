locked,Breathing hard. Cause I'm alone. I see you. Through my bones. I can't sleep. Anymore. 'Cause you don't have the same effect. As before. All my feelings. My whole body is down. Lost in you. Lost in every town. Miles away. The end is coming soon. After sun. Get ready to the moon. Locked in a cage. My body burn in flames. Only you can save me. But you never came. Locked in my head. I just want to forget. Your body's movements. When we lived that moment. Lost in the dark (can you see me?). Falling apart (would you save me?). I am here. Waiting for you. While all my colors. Turns to blue. I close my eyes. And tried to forget. Why aren't you with me. In my bed?. All my feelings. My whole body is down. Lost in you. Lost in every town. Miles away. The end is coming soon. After sun. Get ready to the moon. Locked in a cage. My body burn in flames. Only you can save me. But you never came. Locked in my head. I just want to forget. Your body's movements. When we lived that moment. Lost in the dark (can you see me?). Falling apart (would you save me?). Locked in a cage. My body burn in flames. Only you can save me (only you can save me). But you never came (but you never came). Locked in my head. I just want to forget. Your body's movements (your body's movements). When we lived that moment. Lost in the dark. Falling apart
reborn,"Starting from the zero. Forgetting all the pain. You know, again. Walking to new places. And feeding my mind. Just getting high. I lost my time. Trying to be fine. So now I feel. Like I need something new. You broke my heart. And let me fall apart. I knew it was hard. To be with you. Now I need to reborn. 'Cause my life is a lie. Getting out of the storm. Gotta make it all tonight. Now I need to reborn. Gotta make it all tonight. Day by day I'm living. And I am okay. Don't want to play. I forgot your face. And I forgot your kiss. But it doesn't mean that I miss. I lost my time. Trying to be fine. So now I feel. Like I need something new. You broke my heart. And let me fall apart. I knew it was hard. To be with you. Now I need to reborn. 'Cause my life is a lie. Getting out of the storm. Gotta make it all tonight. Now I need to reborn. Gotta make it all tonight. Now I need to reborn"
rollercoaster,I can be your lover. Today. And if you want forever. I will stay. Cause I can change faster. Than time. Look into my eyes. Are you mine?. All I want is just. Hold your hand. Feel your heart beating. If you can. Cause I will love stronger. Than all. Say you won't. Let me fall. We're going up. We're falling down. We touch the sky. Then hit the ground. It's like a rollercoaster. You make my heart beat. I can't take any longer. You away from me. It's like a rollercoaster. Get ready to one more. I'm feeling I'm stronger. Than I was before. Rollercoaster. I can be your killer. Tonight. I will just sit. And watch you die. Cause I can be the devil. For you. Only if you don't tell me. The truth. All I want is just. Run away. Cause without you. I don't make mistakes. Can I kiss you. For the first time?. After that. I say goodbye. We're going up. We're falling down. We touch the sky. Then hit the ground. It's like a rollercoaster. You make my heart beat. I can't take any longer. You away from me. It's like a rollercoaster. Get ready to one more. I'm feeling I'm stronger. Than I was before. We're going up (rollercoaster). We're falling down. We touch the sky (rollercoaster). Then hit the ground
see you go,I left you in the street. where I gave you the last kiss. That day was so sweet. I felt that I was his. You were so kind to me. I was hypnotized with you. The two of us on that tree. It was good but I knew. Good things don't last long. I always go wrong. I don't think I'm strong. My weakness is this song. I don't want to say it's love. 'cause I don't even know. I've been putting you up. 'cause I don't want to see you go. ('cause I don't want to see you go. Everyday I wait for you. but you never come back. one way or another you attack. take my colors and make me black. Boy you're really powerful. your smile is a sword. that cuts me with the truth. to you are all these chords. Good things don't last long. I always go wrong. I don't think I'm strong. My weakness is this song. I don't want to say it's love. 'cause I don't even know. I've been putting you up. 'cause I don't want to see you go. ('cause I don't want to see you go. 'cause I don't want to see you go
