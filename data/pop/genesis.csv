home by the sea,"Creeping up the blind side, shinning up the wall. Stealing through the dark of night. Climbing through a window, stepping to the floor. Checking to the left and the right. Picking up the pieces, putting them away. Something doesn't feel quite right. Help me someone, let me out of here. Then out of the dark was suddenly heard. ""welcome to the home by the sea"". Coming out the woodwork, through the open door. Pushing from above and below. Shadows with no substance, in the shape of men. Round and down and sideways they go. Adrift without direction, eyes that hold despair. Then as one they sigh and they moan. Help us someone, let us out of here. Living here so long undisturbed. Dreaming of the time we were free. So many years ago. Before the time when we first heard. ""welcome to the home by the sea"". Sit down...Sit down. As we relive our lives in what we tell you. Images of sorrow, pictures of delight. Things that go to make up a life. Endless days of summer, longer nights of gloom. Waiting for the morning light. Scenes of unimportance, photos in a frame. Things that go to make up a life. Help us someone, let us out of here. Living here so long undisturbed. Dreaming of the time we were free. So many years ago. Before the time when we first heard. ""welcome to the home by the sea"". Sit down...Sit down. As we relive our lives in what we tell you. Let us relive our lives in what we tell you. Sit down...Sit down. Cause you won't get away. No with us you will stay. For the rest of your days. So sit down. As we relive our lives in what we tell you. Let us relive our lives in what we tell you"

carpet crawlers,"There is lambswool under my naked feet. The wool is soft and warm. - Gives off some kind of heat. A salamander scurries into flame to be destroyed. Imaginary creatures are trapped in birth on celluloid. The fleas cling to the golden fleece. Hoping they'll find peace. Each thought and gesture are caught in celluloid. There's no hiding in memory. There's no room to avoid. The crawlers cover the floor in the red ochre corridor. For my second sight of people, they've more lifeblood than before. They're moving in time to a heavy wooden door. Where the needle's eye is winking, closing on the poor. The carpet crawlers heed their callers:. ""We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out"". There's only one direction in the faces that I see. It's upward to the ceiling, where the chamber's said to be. Like the forest fight for sunlight, that takes root in every tree. They are pulled up by the magnet, believing they're free. The carpet crawlers heed their callers:. ""We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out"". Mild-mannered supermen are held in kryptonite. And the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright. Through the door a harvest feast is lit by candlelight. It's the bottom of a staircase that spirals out of sight. The carpet crawlers heed their callers:. ""We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out"". The porcelain mannikin with shattered skin fears attack. And the eager pack lift up their pitchers - they carry all they lack. The liquid has congealed, which has seeped out through the crack. And the tickler takes his stickleback. The carpet crawlers heed their callers:. ""We've got to get in to get outWe've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out ... ""."

More like a freak or publicity stunt.. Oh. No.. They've got no horns and they've got no tail. They don't even know of our existence.. Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold.

There, beyond the bounds of your weak imagination. Lie the noble towers of my city, bright and gold.. Let me take you there, show you a living story. Let me show you others such as me. Why did I ever leave?. They've got no horns and they've got no tail. They don't even know of our existence. Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold. That lies in the deep distance, he cried. And wept.. And so we set out with the beast and his horns. And his crazy description of home.. After many days journey we came to a peak. Where the beast gazed abroad and cried out.. We followed his gaze and we thought that maybe we saw. A spire of gold - no, a trick of the eye that's all,. But the beast was gone and a voice was heard:. They've got no horns and they've got no tail. They don't even know of our existence. Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold. That lies in the deep distance. Hello friend, welcome home."
firth of fifth,"The path is clear, though no eyes can see. The course laid down long before. And so with gods and men, the sheep remain inside their pen. Though many times they've seen the way to leave. He rides majestic, past homes of men. Who care not or gaze with joy. To see reflected there, the trees, the sky, the lily fair. The scene of death is lying just below. The mountains cut off the town from view. Like a cancer growth is removed by skill. Let it be revealed. A waterfall, his madrigal. An inland sea, his symphony. Undinal songs urge the sailors on. 'Till lured by the siren's cry.... Now as the river dissolve in sea. So Neptune has claimed another soul. And so with gods and men, the sheep remain inside their pen. Until the shepherd leads his flock away. The sands of time were eroded by. The river of constant change."

And she shakes her head as if to say. That it's the last time you'll look like today. Sail away, away. Ripples never come back. Gone to the other side. Sail away, away. The face that launched a thousand ships. Is sinking fast, that happens you know. The water gets below. Seems not very long ago. Lovelier she was than any that I know. Angels never know it's time. To close the book and gracefully decline. The song has found a tale. My, what a jealous pool is she. The face in the water looks up. And she shakes her head as if to say. That the bluegirls have all gone away. Sail away, away. Ripples never come back. Gone to the other side. Look into the pool. Ripples never come back. Dive to the bottom and go to the top. to see where they have gone. Oh, they've gone to the other side"

Beast that can talk, read the sign.. The creatures they pushed and they prodded his frame. And questioned his story again.. But soon they grew bored of their prey. Beast that can talk?. More like a freak or publicity stunt.. Oh. No.. They've got no horns and they've got no tail. They don't even know of our existence.. Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold. That lies in the deep distance, he cried. And broke down the door of the cage and marched on out.. He grabbed a creature by the scruff of his neck, pointing out:. There, beyond the bounds of your weak imagination. Lie the noble towers of my city, bright and gold.. Let me take you there, show you a living story. Let me show you others such as me. Why did I ever leave?. They've got no horns and they've got no tail. They don't even know of our existence. Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold. That lies in the deep distance, he cried. And wept.. And so we set out with the beast and his horns. And his crazy description of home.. After many days journey we came to a peak. Where the beast gazed abroad and cried out.. We followed his gaze and we thought that maybe we saw. A spire of gold - no, a trick of the eye that's all,. But the beast was gone and a voice was heard:. They've got no horns and they've got no tail. They don't even know of our existence. Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold. That lies in the deep distance. Hello friend, welcome home."
a winter's tale,"The winter's bitterness is lost. It's the fireside warmth that comforts me. The peace for all my thoughts. The night brings shadows to the street. It's the time for dreams of things to come. To creep inside their lives. You're concealing every feeling. Can you find me, deep inside you. Let me touch you, let me keep you. Let me know you're there. You're concealing every feeling. Can you find me, no. Yes deep inside you're a part of me. Every day I need to know I'm there, I'm there, I'm there. [with previous verse sung behind]. The evening fantasy begins. In the sandy lanes that cross the fields. The gentle rain will fall. The morning sweeps away the night. And the dreams of you still haunt my thoughts. Bring meaning to my life. You're concealing every feeling. Can you find me, deep inside you. Let me touch you, let me keep you. Let me know you're there. You're concealing every feeling. Can you find me, no. Yes deep inside you're a part of me. Every day I need to know I'm there, I'm there, I'm there. [with previous verse sung behind]. [ad lib to fade]. Can you hold me with your small hand. Prepare much, length and beauty of our tiny lives. Future's brighter now. Our world is everything to me, to know, I'm there. Lord! You see the world is brighter than the sky. The sky is shining everywhere in our world."

afterglow,"Like the dust that settles all around me. I must find a new home. The ways and holes that used to give me shelter. Are all as one to me now. But I, I would search everywhere. Just to hear your call. And walk upon stranger roads than this one. In a world I used to know before. I miss you more. Than the sun reflecting off my pillow. Bringing the warmth of new life. And the sound that echoes all around me. I caught a glimpse of in the night. But now, now I've lost everything. I give to you my soul. The meaning of all that I believed before. Escapes me in this world of none. No thing, no-one. And I would search everywhere. Just to hear your call. And walk upon stranger roads than this one. In a world I used to know before. For now I've lost everything. I give to you my soul. The meaning of all that I believed before. Escapes me in this world of none. I miss you more."

alien afternoon,"Woke up in the morning staggered out of bed. Thought about getting back again, but went downstairs instead. Read the daily paper have to know the truth. Slammed the door as I ran outside, looked at my watch and cried. Gotta get to work on time. Gotta get to work on time. Then the sky turned a deeper blue. Not a cloud as the sun shone through. But all around rain kept falling to the ground. The wind was blowing but the trees didn't make a sound. Just another alien afternoon. Just another alien afternoon. Time that I was leaving while there's still a chance. Before I start believing in what I see or hear. Nothing here to keep me, nothing anywhere. Gotta get out pack my bags before I go insane. Gotta get away in time. Gotta get away in time. Then the sky turned from blue to green. Took on colours I have never seen. Then a sound started ringing in my ears. I heard voices but in truth there's nobody there. Just another alien afternoon. Just another alien afternoon. To be there back where I belong. To feel again the wind upon my face. To see again all that I took for granted. All that I left and everything I knew. We are home. We are your home. We are all your home. Not another alien afternoon. Never more to go wandering. Never leaving my world behind. There was never a reason. To leave my heart and my home behind. Where I was born is where I should be now. I would never be lonely. I would never be sad again. I wanted to go anywhere. I wanted to see how strange it all could be. Nothing would ever take me away again. Never more to go wandering. Never leaving my world behind. No, no, no, no. Nothing will ever take me away again, away again. No, no, no, no."
all in a mouse's night,"Loving Couple:. I can't see you but I know you're there.. Got to get beside you cos it's really cold out here.. Come up close to me you'll soon be warm.. Hold me tightly like we're sheltering from a storm.. . Mouse:. Think I might go out for a stroll. Into the night, and out of this hole.. Maybe find me a meal.. Walking along this new shag pile. Presents a problem all the while.. Nearly the door.. Suddenly he bumps into wood, the door is closed.. A voice from the bed, he'll be exposed.. Which way to run, must make for the hole,. The light's been turned on, he's blind as a mole in coal.. Now I can see they're coming at me,. They've blocked off my door, I haven't a chance in hell.. . Couple:.

alone tonight,"There's nothing here that I can understand. And no one cares I'm a lonely man. I touch your face and I don't know why. I call your name but you're going by. Now I'm alone again.. I have no name for each and every day. Until the year is done and fades away. There's a time in between the two. The old years gone by but it's not the new. And I, I, I.... I know that'll be all. Alone again, alone again tonight oh I'm. Alone again, alone again tonight oh I'm. Alone again, and it seems to me that every time I try to change. Say that you're say that you'll. Help me reach the other side. When the morning comes the sun is out. And warms me up again. What a funny world it is for me. And all I'll never be. It's not enough, it's not enough.

anyway,"He panics, feels around for a stone and hurls it at the brightest point. The sound of breaking glass echoes around the cave. As his vision is restored he catches sight of two golden gloves about one foot in diameter hovering away down the tunnel.

back in n.y.c.,"No-one seems to take up the chase, and with the familiar faces fresh in his mind he moves into a reconstruction of his old life, above ground - Too much time was one thing he didn't need, so he used to cut through it with a little speed.

Though I don't think even Big will try this trip again.. His horses were edgy, sensing trouble ahead,. but the trouble didn't start until the men were in bed. A-whooping and a-hollering, flashing their knives,. Big and his men were jumped by an all-star Indian tribe.. He was scared, Big Jim was scared. Alive, they called him lucky, but not today.. Cos he died like all good cowboys with his boots on next to his men.. Big Jim, he still won't lie down,. for him the bet is still on.. Some say he rides there, cursing still.. Some say they've seen him.."

""We heed not flatterers,"" he cried,. ""By our command, waters retreat,. Show my power, halt at my feet,"". But the cause was lost,. Now cold winds blow.. For from the north overcast ranks advance. Fear of the storm accusing with rage and scorn.. The waves surround the sinking throne. Singing ""Crown him, crown him,"". ""Those who love our majesty show themselves!"". All bent their knees.. But he forced a smile even though. His hopes lay dashed where offerings fell (where they fell).. ""Nothing can my peace destroy as long as none smile."". More opened ears and opened eyes,.

Where the needle's eye is winking, closing on the poor. The carpet crawlers heed their callers:. ""We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out"". There's only one direction in the faces that I see. It's upward to the ceiling, where the chamber's said to be. Like the forest fight for sunlight, that takes root in every tree. They are pulled up by the magnet, believing they're free. The carpet crawlers heed their callers:. ""We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out"". Mild-mannered supermen are held in kryptonite. And the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright. Through the door a harvest feast is lit by candlelight. It's the bottom of a staircase that spirals out of sight. The carpet crawlers heed their callers:. ""We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out"". The porcelain mannikin with shattered skin fears attack. And the eager pack lift up their pitchers - they carry all they lack. The liquid has congealed, which has seeped out through the crack. And the tickler takes his stickleback. The carpet crawlers heed their callers:. ""We've got to get in to get outWe've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out ... ""."

I would never be the one to say you had no reason. To want me somewhere else far far away. Someday you may understand someday you will see...."

cuckoo cocoon,"Rael regains consciousness in some musky half-light. He is warmly wrapped in some sort of cocoon.

Do you know what you have done?. Do you know what you've begun?. Do you see we shall never be together again?. All of my life.. Lonely people, empty rooms,. Pointless violence, silent tombs.. Could it be that we shall be together again?. Sheets of double glazing help to keep outside the night,. Only foreign city sirens can cut through,. Nylon sheets and blankets help to minimize the cold.. But they can't keep out the chilling sounds.. Will the nightmare soon give way to dreaming. That she is here with me?.

Children are swimming and playing with boats. Their features are changing. Their bodies dissolve and I am alone.. Now see what you've gone and done.. Now see what you've gone and done.. Well now you never did see such a terrible thing. As was seen last night on T.V.. Maybe if we're lucky, they will show it again. Such a terrible thing to see - oh. But there's nothing you can do when you're next in line. You've got to go domino.. Now I'm one with the living and I'm feeling just fine. I know just what I gotta do. Play the game of happiness and never let on. That it only lives on in a song - oh. Well there's nothing you can do when you're next in line. You've got to go domino.. Do you know what you have done?. Do you know what you've begun?. In silence and darkness. Hold each other near tonight. For will it last forever?. Will it last forever - forever.... There's nothing you can do when you're the next in line. You've got to go domino.. Do you know, do you know, do you know what you have done. Do you see what you've begun?.

driving the last spike,"In the early 1800's, large groups of mainly unskilled labourers built England's Railways. The cost in human terms alone was very high.... . Leaving my family behind me. not knowing what lay ahead. waving goodbye, as I left them in tears. remembering all we'd said. I looked to the sky, I offered my prayers. I asked Him for guidance and strength. but the simple beliefs of a simple man. lay in His hands, and on my head. I gave everything that they wanted. but still they wanted more. we sweat and we toiled. good men lost their lives. I don't think they knew what for. I sold them my heart. I sold them my soul. I gave everything I had. ah but they couldn't break my spirit. my dignity fought back,. fightback. can you hear me. can you see. Don't you hear me. don't you see. We worked in gangs for all we were worth. the young boys pulling the wagons. we were digging the tunnel, shifting the earth. it was then that it happened.. No-one knew how the cracks appeared. but as it fell they all disappeared. stone fell like rain. Can you hear me,. Can you see. Don't you hear me. Can you breathe. The smoke cleared, the dust it settled. No one knew how many had died. all around there were broken men. they'd said it was safe, they'd lied. you could hear the cries, you could smell the fear. but good fortune that day was mine. and it occurred to me the heart of a good man. it seems is hard to find.. Can you hear me,. can you see. Don't you hear me. don't you see. We worked, how we worked like. the devil for our pay. through the wind, through the snow,. and through the rain. Blasting and cutting through Gods country like a knife. sweat stinging my eyes, there has to be a better life. Ah but I can hear my childrens' cry. I can see the tears in their eyes. memories of those I've left behind. still ringing in my ears. Will I ever go back again. Will I ever see her face again. I'll never forget that night. As they waved goodbye to their fathers. We came from the South,. and we came from the North. with picks and with spades. and a new kind of order. showing no fear of what lies up ahead. They'll never see the likes of us again. Driving the last spike,. lifting and laying the track. with blistering hands,. the sun burning your back. Oh but I can hear my childrens' cry. I can see the tears in their eyes. memories of those I've left behind. still ringing in my ears. Well I'll always remember that night,. As they waved goodbye to their fathers. We followed the rail, we slept under the stars. digging in darkness, and living with danger. showing no fear of what lies up ahead. they'll never see the likes of us again. can you hear me. can you see. Don't you hear me."
duchess,"Times were good. She never thought about the future, she just did what she would. Oh, but she really cared. About her music, it all seemed so important then. And she dreamed that everytime that she performed. Everyone would cry for more. That all she had to do was step into the light. And everyone would start to roar. And on the road. Where all but a few fall by the wayside, on the grassier verge. She battled through. Against the others in her world, and the sleep, and the odds. But now everytime that she performed. Everybody cried for more. Soon all she had to do was step into the light. For everyone to start to roar. And all the people cried: ""You're the one we've waited for!"". But time went by. It wasn't so easy now, all uphill and not feeling so strong. Yes, times were hard. Too much thinking about the future and what the people might want. And then there was the time that she performed. When NOBODY called for more. And soon everytime she stepped into the light. They really let her know the score. But she dreamed of the times when she sang her songs. And everybody cried for more. When all she had to do was step into the light. For everyone to start to roar. And all the people cried: ""You're the one we've waited for!""."

dusk,"See my hand is moving. touching all that's real. And once it stroked love's body. now it claws the past.. The scent of a flower,. The colours of the morning,. Friends to believe in,. Tears soon forgotten,. See how the rain drives away, another day.. If a leaf as fallen. does the tree lie broken?. And if we draw some water. does the well run dry?. The sigh of a mother,. The screaming of lovers,. Like two angry tigers,. They tear at each other,. See how for him lifetime's fears disappear.. Once Jesus suffered,. Heaven could not see him.. And now my ship is sinking,. The captain stands alone.. A pawn on a chessboard,. A false move by God will now destroy me,. But wait, on the horizon,. A new dawn seems to be rising,."
eleventh earl of mar,"The sun had been up for a couple of hours,. Covered the ground with a layer of gold.. Spirits were high and the raining had stopped,.

Backwards and forwards in a circle they went.. Found a city half open and ready to greet,. The conquering heroes, with blisters on their feet.. Eleventh Earl of Mar. Somehow got them all this far.. Daddy! You Promised, You Promised.. See the Stewart all dressed up. He's got eyes in the back of his head.. Who came in a cockleshell boat. That could only just float,. Couldn't even lift a sword.. Dressed too fine and smelling of wine.. Daddy you've got to go!. Here comes the bishop all dressed up. He's gonna bless you if you're ready to pay.. One wave of his funny old stick,. There's a band of light across your eyes.. Waited a week still they hadn't appeared,. That glorious timing that everyone feared.. So they're riding along on the crest of a wave,. They're headed for London, And that will be their grave.. Eleventh Earl of Mar. Well he couldn't get them down that far. Daddy! I'm waiting, I'm waiting. Time to go to bed now. Never seems too keen. To be a guest now. In a house of dreams. Flying from a hillside. Beckoning the trees. A sailboat's awning. Mimicking the breeze. I'm fighting gravity falling. My Daddy won't let them get me. A voice screams seems to be calling. The face turns features are burning.. Daddy, you've got to go!. See the fifteen going by,. Tell the Lairds and the Lords. They're running backwards today,. And once again you stand alone.. Bury your memories bury your friends,. Leave it alone for a year or two.. Till the stories go hazy and the legends come true,. Then do it again. Some Things never end.. Eleventh Earl of Mar. Won't be going very far.. You Promised, You Promised, You Promised.. DADDY!."
entangled,"When you're asleep they may show you. Aerial views of the ground. Freudian slumber empty of sound. Over the rooftops and houses. Lost as it tries to be seen. Fields of incentive covered with green. Mesmerised children are playing. Meant to be seen but not heard. ""Stop me from dreaming!"". ""Don't be absurd!"". ""Well if we can help you we will. You're looking tired and ill. As I count backwards. Your eyes become heavier still. Sleep, won't you allow yourself fall?. Nothing can hurt you at all. With your consent.

Sometimes entangled in your own dreams. ""Well, if we can help you we will. Soon as you're tired and ill. With your consent. We can experiment further still. Well, thanks to our kindness and skill. You'll have no trouble until. You catch your breath. And the nurse will present you the bill!"""

Oh, and everybody told you ""you're oh so lucky"". Curtains part revealing a country scene. Clothed in green and brown. Evidence of autumn. And recent rain. On a winding lane, a byway. Walking on that road is a certain girl. In all the world the one. Guaranteed to move you and turn your head. When all's been said and done. The girl from all those songs. Who made everything feel right. She came in like an angel, into your lonely life. And filling your world with light. Oh, and everybody told you ""you're oh so lucky"". The night is clear but cool. Ooh maybe dawn is breaking as you turn to find her gone. Then you see the note. Ooh you cannot believe it. And you think you'll go insane.... But that was many years ago. And though the pain is dim. A something still remains. Though you hardly can recall. Her face or form. Her memory lingers on. Ooh she made everything feel right. She came in like an angel (in like an angel),. Into your lonely life (into your life). And filling your world with light."

Far away, away, fading distant lights. Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world. And you know that these are the days of our lives, remember. Like the story that we wish was never ending. We know some time we must reach the final page. Still we carry on just pretending. That there'll always be one more day to go. Far away, away, fading distant lights. Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world. And you know that these are the days of our lives, remember. Another chance hello, another goodbye. And so many things we'll never see again. Days of lives that seem so unimportant. They seem to matter and to count much later on. Far away, away, fading distant lights. Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world.

feeding the fire,"Released as B-side of ""Land Of Confusion"" single, 1986.. . You are terrified by the smallest sound. Because you live your life in such a sheltered world. As do those who surround you. Well I have seen you stung by poisonous flies. And you suffer much too much from their bites. There you sit in your comfort watching other people get caught by the. storm. Many a thing that used to be a secret. Has become so talked about. Not worth a second thought. There's different kinds of secrets now. Times change, it's not enough to say. It seemed a good idea a hundred years ago. You think it's not your problem. It really doesn't matter at all. Every stone that's thrown must fall to the ground. But you don't give a thought to where they might come down. You are feeding the fire over which you'll be roasted. Anywhere that they don't speak the same. In any place that they don't think the same. You think it's not your problem. No no. You think it's not your problem. It really doesn't matter at all. Oh.... Maybe it's not your fate to be a leader of men. But you just leave it all to someone else and complain. You could be so much stronger, but it really doesn't matter any longer. Cos you're feeding the fire over which you'll be roasted."
fireside song,"As daybreak breaks the mist upon the earth. It came to pass that beauty settled there forever more. And as the steam clings close to things to come. It came to pass that solid rock did part for humble life. Once upon a time there was confusion. Disappointment, fear and disillusion. Now there's hope reborn with every morning. See the future clearly at its dawning. Forever drifting slowly towards a hazy emptiness. Whilst water slips into the sea. The father's sad to see it's free. As shadows creep towards their master night. It came to pass that trees defied the wind who shook their leaves. And as the peace descended all around. It came to pass that nature's creatures came to face the world. Once upon a time there was confusion. Disappointment, fear and disillusion. Now there's hope reborn with every morning. See the future clearly at its dawning. Forever drifting slowly towards a hazy emptiness. Whilst water slips into the sea. The father's sad to see it's free. Once upon a time there was confusion. Disappointment, fear and disillusion. Now there's hope reborn with every morning. See the future clearly at its dawning. Once upon a time there was confusion."
firth of fifth,"The path is clear, though no eyes can see. The course laid down long before. And so with gods and men, the sheep remain inside their pen. Though many times they've seen the way to leave. He rides majestic, past homes of men. Who care not or gaze with joy. To see reflected there, the trees, the sky, the lily fair. The scene of death is lying just below. The mountains cut off the town from view. Like a cancer growth is removed by skill. Let it be revealed. A waterfall, his madrigal. An inland sea, his symphony. Undinal songs urge the sailors on. 'Till lured by the siren's cry.... Now as the river dissolve in sea. So Neptune has claimed another soul. And so with gods and men, the sheep remain inside their pen. Until the shepherd leads his flock away. The sands of time were eroded by. The river of constant change."
fly on a windshield,"The sky is overcast and as Rael looks back a dark cloud is descending like a balloon into Times Square. It rests on the ground and shapes itself into a hard edged flat surface, which solidifies and extends itself all the way East and West along 47th Street and reaching up to the dark sky. As the wall takes up its tension it becomes a screen showing what had existed in three dimensions, on the other side just a moment before. The image flickers and then cracks like painted clay and the wall silently moves forward, absorbing everything in its path. The unsuspecting New Yorkers are apparently blind to what is going on.. . There's something solid forming in the air,. And the wall of death is lowered in Times Square.. No-one seems to care,. They carry on as if nothing was there.. . Rael starts to run away towards Columbus Circle. Each time he dares to take a look, the wall has moved another block. At the moment when he thinks he's maintaining his distance from the wall, the wind blows hard and cold slowing down his speed. The wind increases, dries the wet street and picks up the dust off the surface, throwing it into Rael's face. More and more dirt is blown up and it begins to settle on Rael's skin and clothes, making a solid layered coat that brings him gradually to a terrified stillness. A sitting duck.. The wind is blowing harder now,. Blowing dust into my eyes.. The dust settles on my skin,. Making a crust I cannot move in."

going out to get you,I can pacify your violence. I can guarantee no pain. Feel the ugly force of motion. Deep inside your guilty brain. Going out to get you. Going out to get you. Going out to get you. Pulpit of the Python. Chasing out the innocents defiled. Leave your weapon in the cool stream. Rest your body on the stone. Multitude will beckon to a clear sky. Rise again to follow all who came. Are you really evil?. I saw you in the Devil’s Kitchen. Cooking for the Queen of Spades. Hiding in your pretty laces. Licking fingers sunk in jam. Going out to get you. Going out to get you. Going out to get you. Pulpit of the Python. Chasing out the innocents defiled. Curl your flimsy leaves around me. Sorceress you cannot still command. Burning in the orifice of Hades. Sacrifice your magic to my hand. Are you really evil?. I saw you in the Hermit's garden. Picking fruit to fill his flesh. Tacking spells to take his body. Trapping him inside your mesh. Going out to get you. Going out to get you. Going out to get you. Pulpit of the Python. Chasing out the innocents defiled

All of the pieces in the sky.. There was once a harvest in this land.. Reap from the turquoise sky, harlequin, harlequin,. Dancing round, three children fill the glade,. Theirs was the laughter in the winding stream, and in between.. Close your door, the picture fades again. From the flames in the firelight.. All, always the same,. But there appears in the shades of dawning,. Though your eyes are dim,. All of the pieces in the sky.. All, all is not lost,. And light appears in the shades of dawning. When your eyes can see. Order the pieces, put them back, put them back.."

hidden in the world of dawn,"Pastel colours bring the sky to life. Cleanse the night with a breath of dawn. Silence broken when a baby cries. Piercing the mist that cloaks the cool. Outside. The streets are beginning to moan. Gently now. Daylight lays on the ground. Dew drops trickle down leaves. Gently now. Soaking the pathway of the father's. Motions. Windows opening as the postman calls. Letters to smell; letters to burn. Daily papers through the hole in the door. Sex and news fill the wisdom of a million. Minds. Time is a measure of strength. Quickly now. Speed is the cause of decay. Traffic is humble to fall. On your knees. Pushing and pulling the tired. Little men in their cars. Wake up! your conscience is calling!. Reality begins at nine. Wake up! think what you're missing. Hidden in the world of dawn. Rest your body with soothing sleep. Dream of the hours you left behind. Listen carefully for the break of day. The twilight's near, silence brings the. Fantasy here. Silhouettes mingle with sky. Backed with smog. Ripples of morning flow by. The quietness flavours the glow. Breathe it in. Imagine the bliss that is glazing the warm face. Agleam. Wake up! your conscience is calling!. Reality begins at nine. Wake up! think what you're missing. Hidden in the world of dawn."

home by the sea,"Creeping up the blind side, shinning up the wall. Stealing through the dark of night. Climbing through a window, stepping to the floor. Checking to the left and the right. Picking up the pieces, putting them away. Something doesn't feel quite right. Help me someone, let me out of here. Then out of the dark was suddenly heard. ""welcome to the home by the sea"". Coming out the woodwork, through the open door. Pushing from above and below. Shadows with no substance, in the shape of men. Round and down and sideways they go. Adrift without direction, eyes that hold despair. Then as one they sigh and they moan. Help us someone, let us out of here. Living here so long undisturbed. Dreaming of the time we were free. So many years ago. Before the time when we first heard. ""welcome to the home by the sea"". Sit down...Sit down. As we relive our lives in what we tell you. Images of sorrow, pictures of delight. Things that go to make up a life. Endless days of summer, longer nights of gloom. Waiting for the morning light. Scenes of unimportance, photos in a frame. Things that go to make up a life. Help us someone, let us out of here. Living here so long undisturbed. Dreaming of the time we were free. So many years ago. Before the time when we first heard. ""welcome to the home by the sea"". Sit down...Sit down. As we relive our lives in what we tell you. Let us relive our lives in what we tell you. Sit down...Sit down. Cause you won't get away. No with us you will stay. For the rest of your days. So sit down. As we relive our lives in what we tell you. Let us relive our lives in what we tell you"

Your bowler hats are turning green. Your city suits are coloured cream. You, you who changed my life. You made it misery, sadness reins alone. Wonder why you do this, to me. When I've tried so hard for you. People talking to the man who's digging a hole, in his mind. He's no need to worry, he's deaf and blind. See the dustman doing his round in a Rolls made of glass. He's gained everything because he's got class. Friends are leaving me when I did everything. Just as they used to behave. Trying to copy them, losing my real self. Floating away in a cloud. Your minds have blown you out of step. The rules you taught you never kept. You, you who changed my life. You made it misery, sadness reins alone. Wonder why you do this, to me."

Switch me on, let me go. - I have a mind of my own. I wish you were here. In hiding. I lie silent at last. I'm free from my past. I walk among the tall trees. This is beauty I know. I'm in love with it all. I have freedom to love. In hiding. Pick me up, put me down. Push me in, turn me round. Switch me on, let me go. - I have a mind of my own. Pick me up, put me down. Push me in, turn me round. Switch me on, let me go."
in limbo,"Please take me away. Far from this place. Leaving me here. Take me away. To the furthest star in the sky. Take me away. To the deepest cave of the night. Take me away. Voices of love, here am I. In the sad sad world of fear. Take me away. From the power of my ambition. And I'll be happy. I, I've conquered time. Where will I go?. Am I still mine?. Take me away. To the furthest star in the sky. Take me away. To the deepest cave of the night. Take me away. Voices of love, here am I. In the sad sad world of fear. Take me away. From the power of my ambition. And I'll be happy. Peace - floating in limbo. Limbo - leading me nowhere. Peace - now without motion. I cry - when will I die?. God - where is my soul now?."
in the air tonight,"I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord. I've been waiting for this moment, all my life, Oh Lord. Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, Oh Lord. Well, if you told me you were drowning. I would not lend a hand. I've seen your face before my friend. But I don't know if you know who I am. Well, I was there and I saw what you did. I saw it with my own two eyes. So you can wipe off the grin, I know where you've been. It's all been a pack of lies. And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, Oh Lord. I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord. can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord. And I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh Lord, Oh Lord. Well I remember, I remember don't worry. How could I ever forget, it's the first time, the last time we ever met. But I know the reason why you keep your silence up, no you don't fool me. The hurt doesn't show; but the pain still grows. It's no stranger to you or me. And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord..."
in the beginning,"Ocean of motion. Squirming around and up and down. Pushing together. Scattering mountains all around you. That is the sound of a new born world. And the light from a curious sky. It has begun. You're in the hands of destiny. Thrashing with violence. Hurling its lava up and down. Furnace of frenzy. Burning with power uncontrolled. That is the sound of a new born world. And the light from a curious sky. It has begun. You're in the hands of destiny. Is that the chariot with stallions gold?. Is that a prince of heaven on the ground?. Is that the roar of a thundercrash?. This is my world and it's waiting to be crowned. Father, son, looks down with happiness. Life is on its way. Ocean of motion. Squirming around and up and down. Pushing together. Scattering mountains all around you. That is the sound of a new born world. And the light from a curious sky. It has begun. You're in the hands of destiny. Is that the chariot with stallions gold?. Is that a prince of heaven on the ground?. Is that the roar of a thundercrash?. This is my world and it's waiting to be crowned. Father, son, looks down with happiness."
in the cage,"I got sunshine in my stomach. Like I just rocked my baby to sleep.. I got sunshine in my stomach. But I can't keep me from creeping sleep,. Sleep, deep in the deep.. Rockface moves to press my skin. White liquids turn sour within. Turn fast - turn sour. Turn sweat - turn sour.. Must tell myself that I'm not here.. I'm drowning in a liquid fear.. Bottled in a strong compression,. My distortion shows obsession. In the cave.. Get me out of this cave !. If I keep self-control,. I'll be safe in my soul.. And the childhood belief. Brings a moment's relief,. But my cynic soon returns. And the lifeboat burns.. My spirit just never learns.. Stalactites, stalagmites. Shut me in, lock me tight.. Lips are dry, throat is dry.. Feel like burning, stomach churning,. I'm dressed up in a white costume. Padding out left-over room.. Body stretching, feel the wretching. In the cage. Get me out of the cage!. In the glare of a light. I see a strange kind of sight;. O cages joined to from a star. Each person can't go very far;. All tied to their things. They are netted by their strings,. Free to flutter in memories of their wasted wings.. Outside the cage I see my brother John,. He turn his head so slowly round.. I cry out ""Help!"" before he can be gone,. And he looks at me without a sound.. And I shout out ""John please help me !"". But he does not even want to try to speak.. I'm helpless in my violent rage. And a silent tear of blood dribbles down his cheek.. My little runaway.. In a trap, feel a starp. Holding still, Pinned for kill.. Chances narrow that I'll make it,. In the cushioned straitjacket.. Just like 22nd St,. And they got me by my neck and feet.. Pressure's building, can't take more.. My headache's charged. Earaches roar.. In this pain. Get me out of this pain.. If I could change to liquid,. I could fill the cracks up in the rock,. But I know that I am solid. And I am my own bad luck.. Outside John disappears and my cage dissolves,. And without any reason my body revolvess.. Keep on turning. Keep on turning. Keep on turning. Keep on turning. Keep on turning. Turning around. Just spinning around.. Down, down, down..........."
in the rapids,"He dives down into the cold water. At first he is thrown onto the rocks, and pulled under the water by a fast moving channel, which takes him right past John, down river.. . Moving down the water. John is drifting out of sight,. Its only at the turning point. That you find out how you fight.. In the cold, feel the cold. all around. And the rush of crashing water. Surrounds me with its sound.. . Rael manages to grab a rock, pull himself to the surface and catch his breath. As John is carried past, Rael throws himself in again and catches hold of his arm. He knocks John unconscious and then locking themselves together, he rides the rapids into the slow running water, where he can swim to safety.. Striking out to reach you. I can't get through to the other side,. When you're racing in the rapids. There's only one way, thats to ride.. Taken down, taken down. by the undertow. I'm spiralled down the river bed,. My fire is burning low.. Catching hold of a rock that's firm,. I'm waiting for John to be carried past.. We hold together, hold together and shoot the rapids fast.. . But as he hauls his brother's limp body onto the bank he lies him out and looks hopefully into his eyes for a sign of life. He staggers back in recoil, for staring at him with eyes wide open is not John's face - but his own.. And when the waters slow down. The dark and the deep. have no-one, no-one, no-one, no-one. no-one left to keep.. Hang on John! We're out of this at last.. Somethings changed, that's not your face.. It's mine - it's mine!."
in the wilderness,"Leaving all the world to play they disappear. And the leaves have gathered dust to run like deer. Tearing pieces from our lives to feed the dawn. Mist surrounds the seagulls christened by the storm. Music, all I hear is music - guaranteed to please. And I look for something else. Rain drops pouring down the rooftops. Flowing in the drains. As the people run their lives. As their lives are run by time. Fighting enemies with weapons made to kill. Death is easy as a substitute for pride. Victors join together, happy in their bed. Leaving cold outside the children of the dead. Music, all I hear is music - guaranteed to please. And I look for something else. Rain drops pouring down the rooftops. Flowing in the drains. As the people run their lives."
in too deep,"All the time I was searching. Nowhere to run to. It started me thinking. Wondering what I could make of my life. And who'd be waiting. Asking all kinds of questions to myself. But never finding the answers. Crying at the top of my voice. But no-one listening. All this time. I still remember everything you said. There's so much you promised. How could I ever forget. Listen. You know I love you but I just can't take this. You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps. Although I need you I'm not gonna make this. You know I want to but I'm in too deep. So listen, listen to me. Oh you must believe me. I can feel your eyes go thru me. But I don't know why. Oh I know you're going. But I can't believe. It's the way that you're leaving. It's like we never knew each other at all. It may be my fault. I gave you too many reasons for being alone. When I didn't want to. I thought you'd always be there. I almost believed you. All this time. I still remember everything you said. There's so much you promised. How could I ever forget. Listen. You know I love you but I just can't take this. You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps. Although I need you I'm not gonna make this. You know I want to but I'm in too deep. So listen, listen to me. I can feel your eyes go thru me. It seems I've spent too long. Only thinking about myself. Now I want to spend my life. Just caring about somebody else. Listen. You know I love you but I just can't take this. You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps. Although I need you I'm not gonna make this. You know I want to but I'm in too deep"

it,"Rael cannot look away from those eyes, mesmerized by his own image. In a quick movement, his consciousness darts from one face to the other, then back again, until his presence is no longer solidly contained in one or the other. In this fluid state he observes both bodies outlined in yellow and the surrounding scenery melting into a purple haze. With a sudden rush of energy up both spinal columns, their bodies, as well, finally dissolve into the haze.. All this takes place without a single sunset, without a single bell ringing and without a single blossom falling from the sky. Yet it fills everything with its mysterious intoxicating presence. It's over to you.. . When its cold, it come slow. it is warm, just watch it grow. - all around me. it is here. it is now.. Just a little bit of it can bring you up or down.. Like the supper it is cooking in your hometown.. it is chicken, it is eggs,. it is in between your legs.. it is walking on the moon,. leaving your cocoon.. it is the jigsaw. it is purple haze.. it never stays in one place, but it's not a passing phase,. it is in the singles bar, in the distance of the face. it is in between the cages, it is always in a space. it is here. it is now.. Any rock can be made to roll. If you've enough of it to pay the toll. it has no home in words or goal. Not even in your favourite hole. it is the hope for the dope. Who rides the horse without a hoof. it is shaken not stirred;. Cocktails on the roof.. When you eat right through it you see everything alive. it is inside spirit, with enough grit to survive. If you think that its pretentious, you've been taken for a ride.. Look across the mirror sonny, before you choose decide. it is here. it is now. it is Real. it is Rael. 'cos it's only knock and knowall, but I like it...."

Hoping nobody sees. Feeling can be easy. Think how I feel. What will (can) you say?. What will you do?. Why can't you see?. It's yourself I love. (Don't you know I'm not asking. You must have made up your mind. Is it worth the pain you're causing. To those you're leaving behind. What will you say?. What will you do?. Why can't you see?. It's yourself I love). Don't you know I'd like some answers. You could give me a call. I hardly know the reason. And I really feel no good at all. Where will you go?. Where will you be?. Where can I try?."

lilywhite lilith,"He stands by a middle-aged woman, with a very pale skin who is quietly talking to herself. He discovers she is blind and asking for a guide. ""What's the use of a guide if you got nowhere to go"" asks Rael. ""I've got somewhere to go,"" she replies ""if you take me through the noise, I'll show you. I'm a creature of the caves and I follow the way the breezes blow."". He leads her across the room and they leave the crowd, who dismiss their departure as certain to fail.. . The chamber was in confusion - all the voices shouting loud.. I could only just hear, a voice quite near say, ""Please help me. through the crowd"". 'Said if I helped her thru' she could help me too, but I could. see that she was wholly blind.. But from her pale face and her pale skin, a moonlight shined.. Lilywhite Lilith,. She gonna take you thru' the tunnel of night. Lilywhite Lilith,. She gonna lead you right.. . When through the door, the woman leads Rael down the tunnel. The light of the chamber soon fades and despite her confident step Rael often stumbles in the darkness.. After a long walk they arrive in what Rael judges to be a big round cave, and she speaks a second time asking him to sit down. It feels like a cold stone throne.. ""Rael, sit here. They will come for you soon. Don't be afraid."" And failing to explain any more she walks off. He faces his fear once again.. . When I'd led her through the people, the angry noise began to grow.. She said ""Let me feel the way the breezes blow, and I'll show. you where to go."". So I followed her into a big round cave, she said ""They're. coming for you, now don't be afraid."". Then she sat me down on a cold stone throne, carved in jade.. Lilywhite Lilith,. She gonna take you thru' the tunnel of night.. Lilywhite Lilith,. She gonna lead you right.. . A tunnel is lit up to the left of him, and he begins to shake. As it grows brighter, he hears a non-metallic whirring sound. The light is getting painfully bright, reflecting as white off the walls until his vision is lost in a sort of snow blindness.. She leaves me in my darkness,. I have to face, face my fear,. And the darkness closes in on me,. I can hear a whirring sound growing near.. I can see the corner of the tunnel,. Lit up by whatever's coming here.. Two golden globes float into the room."

looking for someone,"Looking for someone, I guess I'm doing that,. Trying to find a mem'ry in a dark room.. Dirty man, you're looking like a Buddha,. I know you well - yeah.. Keep on a straight line, I don't believe I can,. Trying to find a needle in a haystack.. Chilly wind you're piercing like a dagger,. It hurts me so - yeah.. Nobody needs to discover me,. I'm back again.. You see the sunlight through the. Trees to keep you warm,. In peaceful shades of green.. Yet in the darkness of my mind. Damascus wasn't far behind.. Lost in a subway, I guess I'm losing time,. There's a man looking at a magazine.. You're such a fool, your mumbo-jumbo. Never tells me anything - yeah.. Nobody needs to discover me,. I'm back again.. You feel the ashes from the. Fire that kept you warm.. Its comfort disappears,. But still the only friend I know. Would never tell me where I go.. Looking for someone,. And now I've found myself a name.. Come away, leave me,. All that I have I will give.. Leave me, leave me,."

lurker,Meanwhile lurking by a stone in the mud. Two eyes looked to see what I was and. Then something spoke and this is what. It said to me........ Clothes of brass and hair of brown. Seldom need to breathe. Don't need no wings to fly. Ooh and a heart of stone. And a fear of fire and water. Who am I?. Clothes of brass and hair of brown. Seldom need to breathe. Don't need no wings to fly. And a heart of stone. And a fear of fire and water. Who am I?.
mad man moon,"Was it summer when the river ran dry,. Or was it just another dam.. When the evil of a snowflake in June. Could still be a source of relief.. O how I love you, I once cried long ago,. But I was the one who decided to go.. To search beyond the final crest,. Though I'd heard it said just birds could dwell so high.. So I pretended to have wings for my arms. And took off in the air.. I flew to places which the clouds never see,. Too close to the deserts of sand,. Where a thousand mirages, the shepherds of lies. Forced me to land and take a disguise.. I would welcome a horse's kick to send me back. If I could find a horse not made of sand.. If this desert's all there'll ever be. Then tell me what becomes of me.. A fall of rain?. That must have been another of your dreams,. A dream of mad man moon.. Hey man,. I'm the sand man.. And boy have I news for you;. They're gonna throw you in gaol. And you know they can't fail. 'Cos sand is thicker than blood.. But a prison in sand. Is a haven in hell,. For a gaol can give you a goal. [and a] goal can find you a role. On a muddy pitch in Newcastle,. Where it rains so much. You can't wait for a touch. Of sun and sand, sun and sand.... Within the valley of shadowless death. They pray for thunderclouds and rain,. But to the multitude who stand in the rain. Heaven is where the sun shines.. The grass will be greener till the stems turn to brown. And thoughts will fly higher till the earth brings them down.. Forever caught in desert lands one has to learn. To disbelieve the sea.. If this desert's all there'll ever be. Then tell me what becomes of me.. A fall of rain?. That must have been another of your dreams,. A dream of mad man moon.."

Me and Sarah Jane,. Sarah Jane.. Searching for a clue.. Traces on the sand.. First I'm flying, going round round round,. Then I'm sliding going down down down,. Doesn't matter where I start I always end up. Falling through those same old crowded rooms.. Me and Sarah Jane,. We had it coming. All the pain,. Walking down the streets,. And finding nothing is the same,. And now the city lights are dimming one by one,. It costs too much money to keep them all on.. Me and Sarah Jane,. In silence walk along the shore,. Tears of joy and mocking laughter,. Words lost in the wind.. The tide was rising,. But there we stayed,. We had no fear of dying. We weren't afraid"
me and virgil,"Ma would never say what happened. And we knew better than push too hard. We knew we had all the chores to tend to. Like fixing fences and helping her. Washing dishes and making coffee. Me and Virgil'd chop some wood. But we'd stop our swinging. Just to listen to her crying. It didn't sound too good. I can remember, too well. But we never thought to pay much heed. We learned to live life the best we could. But then one day pa upped and left us. High and dry without a word. Seemed a pity. My ma was pretty. But I soon learned life ain't that way. And I can remember hearing her weeping. While we were sleeping next to her. I can remember. I'll never forgive and I'll never forget. Cos pa you broke her heart. Ooh pa you broke her heart. You broke her heart. Ooh pa you broke her heart. Well the years rolled by. And 'fore we knew it. Our sister got married and moved out west. I stayed with ma, cos I couldn't desert her. I knew it would hurt her to be alone. So we pulled tighter. We said we'd try to make things easy. And raise a smile. But as the night came. We'd hear her crying. Praying for pa to come back again. I can remember. I'll never forgive him and I'll never forget. Cos pa you broke her heart. Oh pa you broke her heart. And then the winter came. I'd never known it colder. Ooh it seemed the worst for years. And the night she died I swear I saw her smiling. Saying I was a big boy now, no tears. So I packed up all we had, and Virgil got the horses. And we paid our last respects and gave the whip a crack. Ooh, seemed a big bad world, we were riding into. Me and Virgil both agreed, we best head off. And don't look back. Nothing but desert all around. Oh it made me wonder. Lord it's hard to carry on. When you're sick with hunger. Weeks and months of sleeping rough. Keeping clear of danger. Seems we were miles from anywhere. And too far gone to change it. We'd best keep going, don't look back. Well me and Virgil we beat the desert. Riding fast and riding hard. We hit the city, the past behind us. So we raised some hell, we had some fun. But real soon I met a lady oh so pretty, and oh so fine. 'fore too long I found myself married. With a home of my own and a blue eyed son. And 'til this day I can hear ma saying to me -."
misunderstanding,"There must be some misunderstanding. There must be some kind of mistake. I waited in the rain for hours. And you were late. Now it's not like me to say the right thing. But you could've called to let me know. I checked your number twice, don't understand it. So I went home. Well I'd been waiting for this weekend. I thought that maybe we could see a show. Never dreamed I'd have this feeling. Oh but seeing you is believing. That's why I don't know why. You didn't show up that night. There must be some misunderstanding. There must be some kind of mistake. I was waiting in the rain for hours. And you were late. Since then I've been running around trying to find you. I went to the places that we always go. I rang your HOUSE but got no answer. Jumped in my car, I went round there. Still don't believe it. He was just leaving. There must be some misunderstanding."
more fool me,"Here am I. Who while away the mornings. Since you've gone. Too long have I lay alone. Not knowing which way to turn.. And there you are. Quite sure that you were right. Knowing full well. That I'd be the first one. To go down.. And you'd be the one who was laughing. Except when things weren't going your way. And then the lady would say that she'd had enough. Wandering around on her own.. The day you left. Well I think you knew you'd not be back. Well at least it would seem that way. Because you never said goodbye.. But when it comes round to you and me. I'm sure it will work out alright.. And you'd be the one who was laughing. And giving me something I don't need. And you know, I'd always hold you and keep you warm. Oh! more fool me.. Ah, but when it comes. Round to you and me. I ask myself. Do I really believe. In your love.. Yes, I'm sure it will work out alright.."
never a time,"There is never a time to say. cos it seems to me we've lost our way. so we carry on, down the road. and we live our lives haunted by. all the things we say and do. keep on missing, when I'm alone with you.

All I know is what is true. All I ask is for you. To just look around and see. You live your life locked in a dream. Where nothing is real, and not what it seems. We can't go on another day. Just being afraid to say. It's a long long way to fall. When we both thought we had it all. Well you know it's the time to say. cos we're all played out, we've lost our way.

no son of mine,"Well the key to my survival. was never in much doubt. the question was how I could keep sane. trying to find the way out. things were never easy for me. peace of mind was hard to find. and I needed a place where I could hide. somewhere I could call mine. I didn't think much about it. tell it started happening all the time. soon I was living with the fear everyday. of what might happen that night. I couldn't stand to hear the. crying of my mother. and I remember when.

one day,"Don't get me wrong. I think I'm in love. But the feeling in the word is more. Than your crystal eyes will ever see in me. Don't get me wrong. Open your eyes. Although I cannot show my heart. I'll watch and hope while you are near to me. One day I'll capture you. And call you to my side. One day I'll take you from. The boredom of our lives. One day we'll fly away. To the kingdom of my dreams. One day I'll find myself. And wrap it in my love for you. Birds of the sky, may I borrow your wings?. Very soon I'll ask my love. To travel with me to the world outside. Cherry trees, may I borrow your bloom?. Very soon I'll ask my love. To come inside the nest I'll build alone. One day I'll capture you. And call you to my side. One day I'll take you from. The boredom of our lives. One day we'll fly away. To the kingdom of my dreams. One day I'll find myself. And wrap it in my love for you. Animal friends. Help me decide. When should I ask my love to leave?. I'll beg of you that she'll say yes to me. Breathe in deep. Now is the time. She looks at me and gently smiles. As if she knew I'd ask her all the time. One day I'll capture you. And call you to my side. One day I'll take you from. The boredom of our lives. One day we'll fly away. To the kingdom of my dreams. One day I'll find myself."
one for the vine,"Fifty thousand men were sent to do the will of one.. His claim was phrased quite simply, though he never voiced it loud,. I am he, the chosen one.. In his name they could slaughter, for his name they could die.. Though many there were believed in him, still more were sure he lied,. But they'll fight the battle on.. Then one whose faith had died. Fled back up the mountainside,. But before the top was made,. A misplaced footfall made him stray. From the path prepared for him.. Off of the mountain,. On to a wilderness of ice.. This unexpected vision made them stand and shake with fear,. But nothing was his fright compared with those who saw him appear.. Terror filled their minds with awe.. Simple were the folk who lived. Upon this frozen wave.. So not surprising was their thought,. This is he, God's chosen one,. Who's come to save us from. All our oppressors.. We shall be kings on this world.. Follow me!. I'll play the game you want me,. Until I find a way back home.. Follow me!. I give you strength inside you,. Courage to win your battles -. No, no, no, this can't go on,. This will be all that I fled from.. Let me rest for a while.. He walked into a valley,. All alone.. There he talked with water, and then with the vine.. They leave me no choice.. I must lead them to glory or most likely to death.. They travelled cross the plateau of ice, up to its edge.. Then they crossed a mountain range and saw the final plain.. Still he urged the people on.. Then, on a distant slope,. He observed one without hope. Flee back up the mountainside.. He thought he recognised him by his walk,. And by the way he fell,. And by the way he."
one man's fool,"As the buildings crumble, tumble to the ground. And the dust-filled smoke rises in the air. You know that somebody somewhere looks with pride, they're satisfied. To all who think they know. To everyone that knows that they're right. D'you ever wonder why. D'you never ask the question even in the depths of night?. Now as the daylight fading ends another day. For too many life will never be the same. And it is all for the reason they will never understand. To all who think they know. To everyone that knows that they're right. D'you ever wonder why. D'you never ask the question even in the depths of night?. And on the morning after do you realise. See the ruined faces and the ruined lives. Inside your head do you never have the thought a moment of doubt?. To all who think they know. To everyone that knows that they're right. D'you ever wonder why. D'you never ask the question even in the depths of night?. There are only dreams one like any other. What means the earth to one or few means nothing to another. There are only dreams like any other. Drawing lines upon the sand, on the land, on the sea. Then dying to defend them seems quite meaningless to me. Don't you know what means the earth to some or only one. Can mean just nothing nothing nothing to another. There are only dreams like any other. There are only differences, worth living but not dying for. One man's joy makes another man weep. Nothing you can do is ever gonna change it. One man's saint is another man's fool. One man's hot is another man's cool. And when the war is over, won. Will there be peace for evermore?. Statues carved right out of stone, out of wood, made from gold. Praying for their mercy that won't save their souls. Don't you know what means the earth to some or only one. Can mean just nothing nothing nothing to another. There are only dreams like any other. There are only hopes and beliefs one like any other (there are only dreams like any other). Worth living but not dying for. Living but not dying for not killing for. There are only dreams like any other like any other. To all of those who think that they know. All I can say yes all I can say. One man's joy makes another man weep. Nothing you can do is ever gonna change it. One man's saint is another man's fool. One man's hot is another man's cool. There are only dreams like any other. There are only hopes and beliefs, one like any other. There are only dreams like any other...."

open door,"I see your smiling face, by the open door. There's the morning light. Shining in your hair, and in your eyes. And just a little way behind that smile of yours. I see another one, oh so far away. If only for one second, I could hold you close to me. When the Master calls for me again. There's nothing I can say, or I can do. Goodbye, my love. Time has come to say farewell. I hear the call again. Goodbye to the world. I've sheltered for so long. Oh there's so much my love, that I can never say. And in a little while, in a little while. There's nothing left to see. As the years go by and I have not returned. And the night has come, falling all around. Ooh if you count the stars you'll know. How many have gone out. And when the Master calls for me again. There's nothing that I can say. Or I can do. Stand in the sun. Shut your eyes and feel the world. It's changing every day. Goodbye my love. Each day will seem so long. Ooh there's so much I feel, that I can never say. I can't see you. I can't feel you anymore."
pacidy,"1970. Officially unreleased.. . Pacidy, my love. Glowing ember of evening. Your eyes are frozen with guilt. I read my fate on your cheeks. The smoldering coals of a passion. Once a meadow of hope. Days of minstrels and bright steeds. Autumn nights and silk sheets. Your tender battle shadow on me. Scented lavender kiss-es, soft and warm. The union of strength in a love against life. Love against life. Pacidy, my love. Your touch, so limp, was once frenzied. Your argon lips were once sweet. A life has slipped through my hands. My spirits sift in a stale sigh. Did love exist as a dream?. Mother fawn of a pine wood. Shepherdess of my grief. Veils a freedom not for me. Far beyond the steep ridge, where blizzards. Blast the spirit of man, the frailest of beasts. Frailest of beasts. Where blizzards. Blast the spirit of man, the frailest of beasts. Frailest of beasts. Where blizzards. Blast the spirit of man, the frailest of beasts."

pigeons,"Released on ""Spot The Pigeon E.P."", 1977.. . Who put fifty tons of shit on the Foreign Office roof?. Who suffers from nine known diseases?. Who gets up in the morning when the sun comes up. And makes their beds, paper clips, bus tickets. All around their heads?. Who congregate around Trafalgar Square. Taking pot shots at the tourists?. Oh you've got to watch out. When you wander round the square in the morning. Cos they're everywhere, they're everywhere. Here we have an honest man. A civil servant to boot. He lived high up in the Ministry. And when he wished to make a point. He knew just what to do. His window ledges were all covered in grease. ""I want them out of here"". He said to me, ""I want them gone"". Because you see - Oh don't you see. None of us are getting any younger. You've got to follow your nose. And if it tells you that you've got to go. Well that's because, they're everywhere,. They're everywhere. So we called in those men, those horrible men. We set them to work on the rooftops. You see their van is very plain. And I know they're too ashamed. To wear their by appointment badges anymore. Sometimes they use vaseline, sometimes they use the pill. I've often seen them with a gun. But as the years go by, old habits seem to die. And nowadays they knockatize them all. Oh you've got to watch out. As you wander round the square in the morning."

Again and again I ask myself was I wrong?. Oh but time's a healer, and heaven knows I've been strong. Maybe we could try. Maybe we would work this time. Oh I can remember when it was easy to say I love you. But things have changed since then, now I really can't say if I still do. But I can try. Cos I know the kids are well, yes you're a mother to the world. Oh but I miss my boy. I hope he's good as gold. But enough of me, tell me how are you? You look good. Oh you've lost some weight I can see, your hair looks nice, you look. good. Maybe we should try, don't say it! I know why. But y'know, I can remember when it was easy to say I love you. But things have changed since then, now I really can't say if I still do. But I can try. Cos I know the kids are well, yes you're a mother to the world. But I miss my boy.

As he nears the water's edge he sees John losing strength.. . Struggling down the slope,. There's not much hope.. I begin to try to ride the scree. but the rocks are tumbling all around me..

ripples,"Bluegirls come in every size. some are wise and some otherwise. They've got pretty blue eyes. For an hour a man may change. For an hour her face looks strange. Looks strange, looks strange. Marching through the promised land. Where the honey flows and takes you by the hand. Pulls you down on your knees. While you're down a pool appears. The face in the water looks up. And she shakes her head as if to say. That it's the last time you'll look like today. Sail away, away. Ripples never come back. Gone to the other side. Sail away, away. The face that launched a thousand ships. Is sinking fast, that happens you know. The water gets below. Seems not very long ago. Lovelier she was than any that I know. Angels never know it's time. To close the book and gracefully decline. The song has found a tale. My, what a jealous pool is she. The face in the water looks up. And she shakes her head as if to say. That the bluegirls have all gone away. Sail away, away. Ripples never come back. Gone to the other side. Look into the pool. Ripples never come back. Dive to the bottom and go to the top. to see where they have gone. Oh, they've gone to the other side"
"robbery, assault and battery","The streets were deserted though the police were alerted,. They considered the phone call a hoax.. Furtively glancing then jauntily prancing. The youth caught the guards unaware.. Slipping between them he ought to have seen then. The eyes and their owner so near.. With torch shining bright he strode on in the night. Till he came to the room with the safe.. ""Hello son, I hope you're having fun."". ""You've got it wrong Sir, I'm only the cleaner."". With that he fired, the other saying as he died,. ""You've done me wrong,"" it's the same old song forever.. Robbery, assault and battery,. The felon and his felony.. Robbery, assault and battery,. The felon and his felony.. Picked up the diamonds and bundles of fivers. He pushed them well down in his sack.. But the alarm had been sounded, he was completely surrounded. But he had some more tricks up his sleeve.. ""Come outside with your hands held high."". ""You'll not get me alive Sir, I promise you that Sir."". With that he fired, the other saying as he died.

I've run of luck. I've almost run out of time. Ooh forgive me, ooh forgive me. I don't mean to share all my fears. Like the man in the middle. Says he just passes on decision. I could always find someone to put the blame on. But I know in my heart of hearts. There is nobody else it was me from the start. As God is my witness, no matter the score. I could never, I could never not do it again. Hard as I might try. I've run of luck, I've run out of time. I've almost run out of tears. --------. I've run of luck, I've run out of time. I've almost run out of tears. --------. Ooh believe me, ooh believe me. I don't mean to hurt you, no more crying. A wolf needs no reason to hunt and kill it's prey. He could no more change than give up breathing. So I know in my heart of hearts. I will always be the way that I am. In the joy of a moment, in the blackest despair. I will never, never, never let anyone in. Hard as I might try. I've run of luck, I've run out of time....."

The night will soon be over. And nothing and no one will ever know.. Open my eyes Joe. I'd like to see the daylight. The clock on the wall says it's time to leave.. Never seen the same face twice. Never walked the same way. The little love that I have known. I keep to myself.. If there's a fire it's asleep in my bed. I must leave it to burn till it burns itself out. Catch as you can I'm not staying here long. I'll be coming back early or never at all."

I'll be alright (don't talk back to me). (without you'll fail to see, you never spare a thought for me). I'll be alright (don't talk back to me). (so many things you said, going round in circles). I'll be alright (don't talk back to me). (I'll rise above it all, enough to see another day). I'll be alright. I'll be alright. Don't talk back to me...."
snowbound,"Lay your body down upon the midnight snow,. Feel the cold of winter in your hair. Here in a world of your own,. In a casing that's grown. To a children's delight. That arrived overnight.. And here they come to play their magic games. Carving names upon your frozen hand.. Here in a world of your own,. Like a sleeper whose eyes. Sees the pain with surprise. As it smothers your cries. They'll never never know.. Hey there's a Snowman. Hey, Hey what a Snowman. Pray for the Snowman. Ooh, Ooh what a Snowman. They say a snow year's a good year. Filled with the love of all who lie so deep.. Smiling faces tear your body to the ground. Covered red that only we can see.. Here in a ball that they made. From the snow on the ground,. See it rolling away. Wild eyes to the sky. They'll never, never know.. Hey there's a Snowman. Hey what a Snowman. Pray for the Snowman. Ooh, Ooh what a Snowman. They say a snow year's a good year. Filled with the love of all who lie so deep.. Hey there goes the Snowman. Hey there what a Snowman. Hey there lies the Snowman. Hey he was a Snowman. They say a snow year's a good year."
squonk,"Like father like son. Not flesh nor fish nor bone. A red rag hangs from an open mouth.. Alive at both ends but a little dead in the middle,. A-tumbling and a-bumbling he will go.. All the King's horses and all the King's men. Could never put a smile on that face.. He's a sly one, he's a shy one. Wouldn't you be too.. Scared to be left all on his own.. Hasn't a, hasn't a friend to play with, the Ugly Duckling. The pressure on, the bubble will burst before our eyes.. All the while in perfect time. His tears are falling on the ground. BUT IF YOU DON'T STAND UP YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE.. Go a little faster now, you might get there in time.. Mirror mirror on the wall,. His heart was broken long before he ever came to you.. Stop your tears from falling,. The trail they leave is very clear for all to see at night. all to see at night.. In season, out of season. What's the difference when you don't know the reason.. In one hand bread, the other a stone.. The Hunter enters the forest.. All are not huntsmen who can blow the huntsman's horn. By the look of this one you've not got much to fear.. Here I am, I'm very fierce and frightening. Come to match my skill to yours.. Now listen here, listen to me, don't you run away now. I am a friend, I'd really like to play with you.. Making noises my little furry friend would make. I'll trick him, then I'll kick him into my sack.. You better watch out... You better watch out.. I've got you, I've got you, you'll never get away.. Walking home that night. The sack across my back, the sound of sobbing on my shoulder.. When suddenly it stopped,. I opened up the sack, all that I had. A pool of bubbles and tears - JUST A POOL OF TEARS.. All in all you are a very dying race. Placing trust upon a cruel world.. You never had the things you thought you should have had. And you'll not get them now,. And all the while in perfect time. Your tears are falling on the ground.. . The Squonk is of a very retiring disposition and due to its ugliness, weeps constantly. It is easy prey for hunters who simply follow a tear-stained trail. When cornered it will dissolve itself into tears.."
stagnation,"Here today the red sky tells its tale. But the only listening eyes are mine. There is peace amongst the hills. And the night will cover all my pride. Blessed are they who smile from bodies free. Seems to me like any other crowd. Who are waiting to be saved. Wait, there still is time for washing in the pool. Wash away the past. Moon, my long lost friend is smiling from above. Smiling at my tears. Come, we'll walk the path that takes us to my home. Keep outside the night. The ice-cold knife has come to decorate the dead. Somehow. And each will find a home. And there will still be time for loving my friend. - you are there -. And will I wait forever beside the silent mirror. And fish for bitter minnows. Amongst the weeds and slimy waters. I, I, I, I, I,. I, I, I, I, I, said I wanna sit down. I, I, I, I, I,. I, I, I, I, I, said I wanna sit down. I want a drink, I want a drink. To take all the dust and the dirt from my throat. I want a drink, I want a drink. To wash out the filth that is deep in my guts. I want a drink. Then let us drink. Then let us smile. Then let us go"

With the thumpire's shout, they all start to clout. - there's no guns in this gentleman's bout.. Georgie moves in on the outside left. with a chain flying round his head;. and Harold Demure, from Art Literature,. nips up the nearest tree.. (Here come the cavalry!). Amidst the battle roar,. accountants keep the score: 10-4.. They've never been alone, after getting a radiophone.. The bluebells are ringing for Sweetmeal Sam, real ham,. handing out bread and jam just like any picnic.. It's 5-4 on William Wright; he made his pile on Derby night.. When Billy was a kid, walking the streets,. the other kids hid - so they did!. And now, after working hard in security trade, he's got it made.. The shops that need aid are those that haven't paid..

And his friend, Liquid Len by name,. of Wine, Women and Wandsworth fame,. said ""I'm breaking the legs of the bastard that got me framed!"". They called me the Reverend when I entered the Church unstained;. my employers have changed but the name has remained.. It all began when I went on a tour,. hoping to find some furniture.. I followed a sign - it said ""Beautiful Chest"".. It led to a lady who showed me her best.. She was taken by surprise when I quickly closed my eyes.. So she rang the bell, and quick as hell. Bob the Nob came out on his job. to see what the trouble was.. ""Louise, is the Reverend hard to please?"". ""You're telling me!"". ""Perhaps, sir, if it's not too late.. we could interest you in our old-fashioned Staffordshire plate?"". ""Oh no, not me, I'm a man of repute."". But the Devil caught hold of my soul and a voice called out ""Shoot!"". To save my steeple, I visited people;. for this I'd gone when I met Little John.. His name came, I understood,. when the judge said ""You're a robbing hood."". He told me of his strange foundation,. conceived on sight of the Woodstock nation;. he'd had to hide his reputation.. When poor, 'twas salvation from door to door.. But now, with a pin-up guru every week,. it's Love, Peace & Truth Incorporated for all who seek.. He employed me as a karma-ma-mechanic, with overall charms.. His hands were then fit to receive, receive alms.. That's why we're in. the Battle of Epping Forest,. yes it's the Battle of Epping Forest,. right outside your door.. We guard your souls for peanuts,. and we guard your shops and houses. for just a little more..

the carpet crawlers,"He returns from his mixed-up memories to the passage he was previously stuck in. This time he discovers a long carpeted corridor.. . There is lambswool under my naked feet.. The wool is soft and warm,. - gives off some kind of heat.. A salamander scurries into flame to be destroyed.. Imaginary creatures are trapped in birth on celluloid.. The fleas cling to the golden fleece,. Hoping they'll find peace.. Each thought and gesture are caught in celluloid.. There's no hiding in my memory.. There's no room to avoid.. . The walls are painted in red ochre and are marked by strange insignia, some looking like a bulls-eye, others of birds and boats. Further down the corridor, he can see some people; all kneeling. With broken sighs and murmurs they struggle, in their slow motion to move towards a wooden door at the end. Having seen only the inanimate bodies in the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging, Rael rushes to talk to them.. The crawlers cover the floor in the red ochre corridor.. For my second sight of people, they've more lifeblood than before.. They're moving in time to a heavy wooden door,. Where the needle's eye is winking, closing in on the poor.. The carpet crawlers heed their callers:. ""We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out."". . ""What's going on?"" he cries to a muttering monk, who conceals a yawn and replies ""It's a long time yet before the dawn."" A sphinx-like crawler calls his name saying ""Don't ask him, the monk is drunk. Each one of us is trying to reach the top of the stairs, a way out will await us there."" Not asking how he can move freely, our hero goes boldly through the door. Behind a table loaded with food, is a spiral staircase going up into the ceiling.. There's only one direction in the faces that I see;. It's upward to the ceiling, where the chamber's said to be.. Like the forest fight for sunlight, that takes root in every tree.. They are pulled up by the magnet, believing they're free.. The carpet crawlers heed their callers:. ""We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out."". Mild mannered supermen are held in kryptonite,. And the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing. bright.. Through a door a harvest feast is lit by candlelight;. It's the bottom of a staircase that spirals out of sight.. The carpet crawlers heed their callers:. ""We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out."". The porcelain mannikin with shattered skin fears attack.. The eager pack lift up their pitchers - they carry all they lack.. The liquid has congealed, which has seeped out through the crack,. And the tickler takes his stickleback.. The carpet crawlers heed their callers:. ""We've got to get in to get out. We've got to get in to get out"
the chamber of 32 doors,"At the top of the stairs he finds a chamber. It is almost a hemisphere with a great many doors all the way round its circumference. There is a large crowd, huddled in various groups. From the shouting, Rael learns that there are 32 doors, but only one that leads out. Their voices get louder and louder until Rael screams ""Shut up!"" There is a momentary silence and then Rael finds himself the focus as they direct their advice and commands to their new found recruit. Bred on trash, fed on ash the jigsaw master has got to move faster. Rael sees a quiet corner and rushes to it.. . At the top of the stairs, there's hundreds of people,. running around to all the doors.. They try to find, find themselves an audience;. their deductions need applause.. The rich man stands in front of me,. The poor man behind my back.. They believe they can control the game,. but the juggler holds another pack.. I need someone to believe in, someone to trust.. I need someone to believe in, someone to trust.. I'd rather trust a countryman than a townman,. You can judge by his eyes, take a look if you can,. He'll smile through his guard,. Survival trains hard.. I'd rather trust a man who works with his hands,. He looks at you once, you know he understands,. Don't need any shield,. When you're out in the field.. But down here,. I'm so alone with my fear,. With everything that I hear.. And every single door, that I've walked through. Brings me back here again,. I've got to find my own way.. The priest and the magician,. Singing all the chants that they have ever heard;. and they're all calling out my name,. Even academics, searching printed word.. My father to the left of me,. My mother to the right,. Like everyone else they're pointing. But nowhere feels quite right.. And I need someone to believe in, someone to trust.. I need someone to believe in, someone to trust.. I'd rather trust a man who doesn't shout what he's found,. There's no need to sell if you're homeward bound.. If I choose a side,. He won't take me for a ride.. Back inside. This chamber of so many doors;. I've nowhere, nowhere to hide.. I'd give you all of my dreams, if you'd help me,. Find a door. That doesn't lead me back again. - take me away.."
the cinema show,"Home from work our Juliet. Clears her morning meal.. She dabs her skin with pretty smells. Concealing to appeal.. I will make my bed,. She said, but turned to go.. Can she be late for her cinema show?. Romeo locks his basement flat,. And scurries up the stair.. With head held high and floral tie,. A weekend millionaire.. I will make my bed. With her tonight, he cries.. Can he fail armed with his chocolate surprise?. Take a little trip back with father Tiresias,. Listen to the old one speak of all he has lived through.. I have crossed between the poles, for me there's no mystery.. Once a man, like the sea I raged,. Once a woman, like the earth I gave.. But there is in fact more earth than sea..

the colony of slippermen,"The Arrival. Leaving by the same door from which he had come in, he finds some sort of freaks ghetto on the other side. When they catch sight of him, the entire street of distorted figures burst into laughter. One of the colony approaches him.. Rael:. I wandered lonely as a cloud,. Till I came upon this dirty street.. I've never seen a stranger crowd;. Slubberdegullions on squeaky feet,. Continually pacing,. With nonchalant embracing,. Each orifice disgracing. And one facing me moves to say ""hellay"".. . He is grotesque in every feature, a mixture of ugly lumps and stumps. His lips slip across his chin as he smiles in welcome and offers his slippery handshake.. His skin's all covered in slimy lumps.. With lips that slide across each chin.. His twisted limbs like rubber stumps. Are waved in welcome say 'Please join in.'. My grip must be flipping,. Cos his handshake keeps slipping,. My hopes keep on dipping. And his lips keep on smiling all the time.. . Rael is a little disillusioned, when the Slipperman reveals that the entire colony have one-by-one been through the same glorious romantic tragedy with the same three Lamia, who regenerate themselves every time, and that now Rael shares their physical appearance and shadowy fate.. Slipperman:. ""We, like you, have tasted love.. Don't be alarmed at what you see,. You yourself are just the same. As what you see in me."". . Rael:. Me, like you? like that!. . Slipperman:. ""You better watch it son, your sentence has only just begun. You better run and join your brother John."". . Amongst the contorted faces of the Slippermen, Rael recognises what is left of his brother John. They hug each other.. . A Visit To The Doktor. John bitterly explains that the entire life of the Slipperman is devoted to satisfying the never-ending hunger of the senses, which has been inherited from the Lamia. There is only one escape route; a dreaded visit to the notorious Doktor Dyper who will remove the source of the problems, or to put it less politely, castrate.. They discuss the deceptively-named escape for a long time and decide to go together to visit the Doktor.. Slipperman:. ""You're in the colony of slippermen.. There's no who? why? what? or when?. You get out if you've got the gripe. To see, Doktor Dyper, reformed sniper - he'll whip off your. windscreenwiper"". . Rael:. John and I are able. To face the Doktor and his marble table.. . The Doktor:. Understand Rael, that's the end of your tail.. . Rael:. ""Don't delay, dock the dick!"". I watch his countdown timer tick..... . The Raven. They survive the ordeal and are presented with the offensive weapons in sterile yellow plastic tubes, with gold chains. ""People usually wear them around their necks,"" said the Doktor handing them over. ""The operation does not necessarily exclude use of the facility again, for short periods, but of course when you want it you must provide us with considerable advance warning."". . He places the number into a tube,. It's a yellow plastic ""shoobedoobe"".. It says: ""Though your fingers may tickle. You'll be safe in our pickle."". . As the brothers talk themselves through their new predicament, a big black raven flies into the cave, swoops down, grabs Rael's tube right out of his hands and carries it up into the air in his beak.. Suddenly, black cloud come down from the sky.. It's a supersized black bird that sure can fly.... The raven brings on darkness and night. He flies right down, gives me one hell of a fright.. He take the tube right out of my hands. Man, I've got to find out where that black bird lands.. . Rael calls for John to go with him.. And he replies ""I will not chase a black raven. Down here you must read and obey the omens. There's disaster where the raven flies."". . ""Look here John, I've got to run. I need you now, you going to come?"". He says to me:. . John:. ""Now can't you see. Where the raven flies there's jeopardy.. We've been cured on the couch. Now you're sick with your grouch.. I'll not risk my honey pouch. Which my slouch will wear slung very low."". . So once more John deserts his brother.. Rael:. He walks away and leaves me once again.. Even though I never learn,. I'd hoped he'd show just some concern.. . The bird leads Rael down a narrow tunnel, he seems to be allowing him to keep at a closed distance. But as Rael thinks he might almost catch hold of the bird, the tunnel opens and finishes at an enormous subterranean ravine. Casually, the raven drops his precious load into the rushing waters at the bottom. It's enough to drive a poor boy ravin' mad.. Seeing the dangers of the steep cliff, our courageous hero stands impotent and glowers.. . I'm in the agony of Slipperpain. I pray my undercarriage will sustain.. The chase is on, the pace is hot. But I'm running so very hard with everything that I've got.. He leads me down an underpass. Though it narrows, he still flies very fast,. When the tunnel stops. Catch sight of the tube, just as it drops.. I'm on top of a bank too steep to climb. I see it hit the water just in time. to watch it float away...."
the conqueror,"He climbs inside the looking glass. And points at anything he hates. He calls to you, ""Hey look out son. There's a gun they're pointing at your pretty face"". And the heads they are a rolling. Cos the conqueror is on his way. And the justice day is coming. For the conqueror is on his way. Five hundred little women. Are calling at their hero's door. Yes, their hero is working overtime. He's squirming on an empty floor. And the heads they are a rolling. Cos the conqueror is on his way. And the justice day is coming. For the conqueror is on his way. He's bought the castle on the hill. He's bought it just to knock it down. The local power shout him down. They say he's just an empty-headed clown. And the heads they are a rolling. Cos the conqueror is on his way. And the justice day is coming. For the conqueror is on his way. He's busy building monuments. To hide inside his empty grave.

the day the light went out,"Released as B-side of ""Many Too Many"" single, 1978.. . When they went to bed that night no-one would have believed. That in the morning light would not be there. The dark hung heavy on the air like the grip of a jealous man. No place was there known to have been spared. Then panic took control of minds as fear hit everyone. The day the light went out of the daytime sky. Artificial light could hardly penetrate the gloom. Nothing out of reach could be observed. Looting, pillage, murder, rape became the rule of that day. Who hit him no one knew or whom he hit. Cars were caught in pileups and the planes could never land. The day the light went out of the daytime sky. ""Now I can rest here after my journey. Now I can feed here before I continue"". Some there were who's heads were clear who sought, tried to find. The nature of this deadly foe, the dark. It seemed the sun was still somewhere though hidden from their sight. By something, though amorphous, yet alive. And so they looked for ways to rid themselves of the parasite. The day the light went out of the daytime sky. ""Now I can rest here after my journey. Now I can feed here before I continue"". They tried in many fruitless ways to see the noonday sun. By blasting with their missiles through the dark. But soon a kind of sleepy state came over everyone. Till nothing seemed to stir or even breathe. And when the darkness chose to disappear not many had survived. Then came a shadow - another had arrived."
the dividing line,"There has always been a dividing line. But you choose, you choose, yes you choose not to see it. And then you wonder why you fall. It cuts through the heart of every city. If you climb to the top of the highest building. You can see where it falls 'cause the streetlights stop. The colours start to change. You hear a voice inside you. Not the words that you wanted to hear. Not the things that you wanted to see hey, hey, hey, hey. In the comfort and safety of your own home. Remember those outside in the cold. And the wind and the rain. And take in your hands a little ray of light. And turn it into a beam that pierces the darkness of the night. There has always been a dividing line. But you choose, you choose, yes you choose not to see it. Sometimes we believe if we close our eyes. The rain might wash it away. That's why we stumble and we fall. Not the words that you wanted to hear. Not the things that you wanted to see hey, hey, hey, hey. When everything that you hold dear to you. Has finally faded away from your life. The last cold ray of sunshine slowly disappears. Round the corner of the building. And leaves you alone. When darkness covers the city and the streets are silent too. What will you turn to...."
the fountain of salmacis,"Hermaphrodite: a flower containing both male and female organs; a person or animal of both sexes.. The child Hermaphroditus was the son of Hermes and Aphrodite, the result of a secret love affair. For this reason he was entrusted to the nymphs of the isolated Mount Ida, who allowed him to grow up as a wild creature of the woods. After his encounter with the water-nymph Salmacis, he laid a curse upon the water. According to fable, all persons who bathed in the water became hermaphrodites.. . From a dense forest of tall dark pinewood,. Mount Ida rises like an island.. Within a hidden cave, nymphs had kept a child;. Hermaphroditus, son of gods, so afraid of their love.. As the dawn creeps up the sky. The hunter caught sight of a doe.. In desire for conquest,. He found himself within a glade he'd not beheld before.. Hermaphroditus: Narrator:. ""Where are you, my father? ""Then he could go no farther. Give wisdom to your son"" Now lost, the boy was guided by the sun"". And as his strength began to fail. He saw a shimmering lake.. A shadow in the dark green depths. Disturbed the strange tranquility.. Salmacis: Narrator:. ""The waters are disturbed ""The waters are disturbed. Some creature has been stirred"" Naiad queen Salmacis has been stirred"". As he rushed to quench his thirst,. A fountain spring appeared before him. And as his heated breath brushed through the cool mist,. A liquid voice called, ""Son of gods, drink from my spring"".. The water tasted strangely sweet.. Behind him the voice called again.. He turned and saw her, in a cloak of mist alone. And as he gazed, her eyes were filled with the darkness of the lake.. Salmacis: Narrator:. ""We shall be one ""She wanted them as one. We shall be joined as one"" Yet he had no desire to be one"". Hermaphroditus: ""Away from me cold-blooded woman. Your thirst is not mine"". Salmacis: ""Nothing will cause us to part. Hear me, O Gods"". Unearthly calm descended from the sky. And then their flesh and bones were strangely merged. Forever to be joined as one.. The creature crawled into the lake.. A fading voice was heard:. ""And I beg, yes I beg that all who touch this spring. May share my fate"". Salmacis: Narrator:. ""We are the one ""The two are now made one,. We are the one"" Demi-god and nymph are now made one"". Both had given everything they had.. A lover's dream had been fulfilled at last,."

the lady lies,"The man steps out in the moonlight. At the sound of a scream from below.. He thinks he is a warrior. So he picks up his sword and goes.. From the mouth of the monster. He rescues the maiden fair.. But we know she's a demon. Come to lure him to demon's lair.. Through restless foliage and tall trees he leads. To a house in a clearing, a place in her fear she. calls home.. ""Come with me, I need you,. I fear the dark and I live all alone.. I'll give you wine and food too. And something special after if you like."". And though his body bids him. To enter in with her,. There was something in her manner. That his mind could not ignore.. Also it is whispered. In the kingdom far and wide,. To beware a little cottage. In the forest in a glade.. For who knows what magic takes place in his world?. So he just thanks her kindly preparing to go on his way.. ""Come with me, I need you,. I fear the dark and I live all alone.. I'll give you wine and food too. And something special after if you like.. Come to my garden,. Taste the fruits and the spices of love.. You can't resist me,. I'm the kind that your dreams tell you of."". ""So glad you could make it. We had everything arranged.. So glad you saw fit to pay a call."". Some men never listen,. And others never learn,. But why this man did as he did. Only he will ever know.. He knew he was walking. Into a waiting trap,. Neatly set up for him. With a bait so richly wrapped.. So he went inside there to take on what he found. But he never escaped them, for who can escape what he desires?. ""Come with me, I need you,. I fear the dark and I live all alone.. I'll give you wine and food too"
the lamb lies down on broadway,"The lamb lies down on Broadway. And the lamb lies down on Broadway.. Early morning Manhattan,. Ocean winds blow on the land.. The Movie-Palace is now undone,. The all-night watchmen have had their fun.. Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show,. It's the same old ending-time to go.. Get out!. It seems they cannot leave their dream.. There's something moving in the sidewalk steam,. And the lamb lies down on Broadway.. Nightime's flyers feel their pains.. Drugstore takes down the chains.. Metal motion comes in bursts,. But the gas station can quench that thirst.. Suspension cracked on unmade road. The trucker's eyes read 'Overload'. And out on the subway,. Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid. Exits into daylight, spraygun hid,. And the lamb lies down on Broadway.. The lamb seems right out of place,. Yet the Broadway street sceng finds a focus in its face.. Somehow it's lying there,. Brings a stillness to the air.. Though man-made light, at night is very bright,. There's no whitewash victim,. As the neons dim, to the coat of white.. Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid,. Wipes his gun-he's forgotten what he did,. And the lamb lies down on Broadway.. Suzanne tired her work all done,. Thinks money-honey-be on-neon.. Cabman's velvet glove sounds the horn. And the sawdust king spits out his scorn.. Wonder women draw your blind!. Don't look at me! I'm not your kind.. I'm Rael!. Something inside me has just begun,. Lord knows what I have done,. And the lamb lies down on Broadway.. On Broadway-. They say the lights are always bright on Broadway.. They say there's always magic in the air.."
the lamia,"Rael touches his face to confirm that he is still alive. He writes Death off as an illusion, but notices a thick musky scent hanging in the air. He moves to the corner where the scent is stronger, discovering a crack in the rubble through which it is entering. He tries to shift the stones and eventually clears a hole large enough to crawl out of. The perfume is even stronger on the other side and he sets off to find its source, with a new-found energy.. The scent grows richer, he knows he must be near,. He finds a long passageway lit by chandelier.. Each step he takes, the perfumes change. From familiar fragrance to flavours strange.. A magnificent chamber meets his eye.. He finally reaches a very ornate pink-water pool. It is lavishly decorated with gold fittings. The walls around the pool are covered with a maroon velvet up which honeysuckle is growing. From out of the mist on the water comes a series of ripples.. Inside, a long rose-water pool is shrouded by fine mist.. Stepping in the moist silence, with a warm breeze he's gently kissed.. Thinking he is quite alone,. He enters the room, as if it were his own. But ripples on the sweet pink water. Reveal some company unthought of -. Three snakelike creatures are swimming towards Rael. Each reptilian creature has the diminutive head and breasts of a beautiful woman. His horror gives way to infatuation as their soft green eyes show their welcome. The Lamia invite him to taste the sweet water and he is quick to enter the pool. As soon as he swallows some liquid, a pale blue luminescence drips off from his skin. The Lamia lick the liquid; very gently as they begin, with each new touch, he feels the need to give more and more.. Rael stands astonished doubting his sight,. Struck by beauty, gripped in fright;. Three vermilion snakes of female face. The smallest motion, filled with grace.. Muted melodies fill the echoing hall,. But there is no sign of warning in the siren's call:. ""Rael welcome, we are the Lamia of the pool.. We have been waiting for our waters to bring you cool."". Putting fear beside him, he trusts in beauty blind,. He slips into the nectar, leaving his shredded clothes behind.. ""With their tongues, they test, taste and judge all that is mine.. They move in a series of caresses. That glide up and down my spine.. They knead his flesh until his bones appear to melt, and at a point at which he feels he cannot go beyond, they nibble at his body. Taking in the first drops of his blood, their eyes blacken and their bodies are shaken. Distraught with helpless passion he watches as his lovers die. In a desperate attempt to bring what is left of them into his being, he takes and eats their bodies, and struggles to leave his lovers' nest.. As they nibble the fruit of my flesh, I feel no pain,. Only a magic that a name would stain.. With the first drop of my blood in their veins. Their faces are convulsed in mortal pains.. The fairest cries, 'We all have loved you Rael'."". Each empty snakelike body floats,. Silent sorrow in empty boats.. A sickly sourness fills the room,. The bitter harvest of a dying bloom.. Looking for motion I know I will not find,. I stroke the curls now turning pale, in which I'd lain entwined. ""O Lamia, your flesh that remains I will take as my food"". It is the scent of garlic that lingers on my chocolate fingers.. Looking behind me, the water turns icy blue,. The lights are dimmed and once again the stage is set for you."
the light dies down on broadway,"He follows a small path running along the top, and watches the tube bobbing up and down in the water as the fast current carries it away. However, as he walks around a corner Rael sees a sky-light above him, apparently built into the bank. Through it he can see the green grass of home, well not exactly; he can see Broadway.. . As he walks along the gorge's edge,. He meets a sense of yesteryear.. A window in the bank above his head. Reveals his home amidst the streets.. Subway sounds, the sounds of complaint. The smell of acid on his gun of paint.. As it carves out anger in a blood-red band,. Destroyed tomorrow by an unknown hand;. - My home.. Is this the way out from the endless scene?. Or just an entrance to another dream?. And the light dies down on Broadway.. . His heart, now a little bristly, is shaken by a surge of joy and he starts to run, arms wide open, to the way out. At this precise point in time his ears pick up a voice screaming for help. Someone is struggling in the rapids below. It's John.. But as the skylight beckons him to leave,. He hears a scream from far below.. Within the raging water, writhes the form. Of brother John, he cries for help.. . He pauses for a moment remembering how his brother had abandoned him. Then the window begins to fade - it's time for action.. The gate is fading now, but open wide.. But John is drowning, I must decide. Between the freedom I had in the rat-race,. Or to stay forever in this forsaken place;. Hey John!. He makes for the river and the gate is gone,. Back to the void where it came from.. And the light dies down on Broadway.."
the magic of time,The magic of time that surrounded the world. In the mist and the cloud of new life. The seas had been filled and the air made clean. Awaiting the change on the ground. Sunlight in the daytime and the dew came at night. And the rain fell to dampen the earth. And the rain filled the rivers and the rivers the lakes. And the life on the ground did emerge. Rock is hidden by moss and flowers. The trees are clothed in green. The silent sun has fashioned the world. A stage for man to come. The magic of time that surrounded the world. In the mist and the cloud of new life. The seas had been filled and the air made clean. Awaiting the change on the ground
the mistery of the flannan isle lighthouse,"Flannan Isle lies in the South by the Point of Kedgeree. Forty-seven miles from land in the roughest part of the sea. On the finest day the sea is black. They say no one has ever come back from there. They say the wicked spirits haunt the lighthouse in the night. Fierce ghosts of many men who tried to stop the warning light. Waves are hurled against the ugly rocks. Spray is changed at once to a wall of ice. Bird who wants to rest its tired wings. Lands, and it is turned to a [dummy?] of stone. The island's rocks have many caves that smell of dying flesh. They lure the strangers to their maze of never ending length. The empty cave is filled with sound. [A madman lying???] in the ground below. Each month a boat is sucked to perish by the rocky isle. Each time the moon is full the currents are directed there. Boats that sail too near to Flannan Isle. Feel the weather change and they turn away. If they dare to look behind them, still. Screams of disappointment fill the air"

time table,"A carved oak table,. Tells a tale. Of times when kings and queens sipped wine from goblets gold,. And the brave would lead their ladies from out of the room. to arbours cool.. A time of valour, and legends born. A time when honour meant much more to a man than life. And the days knew only strife to tell right from wrong. Through lance and sword.. Why, why can we never be sure till we die. Or have killed for an answer,. Why, why do we suffer each race to believe. That no race has been grander. It seems because through time and space. Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore.. A dusty table. Musty smells. Tarnished silver lies discarded upon the floor. Only feeble light descends through a film of grey. That scars the panes.. Gone the carving,. And those who left their mark,. Gone the kings and queens now only the rats hold sway. And the weak must die according to nature's law. As old as they.. Why, why can we never be sure till we die. Or have killed for an answer,. Why, why do we suffer each race to believe. That no race has been grander. It seems because through time and space. Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore.."

twilight alehouse,"1971. Released as B-side of ""I Know What I Like"" single, 1974.. Is it really true what they're saying. Are you really sure there's nobody come for me. When I'm walking home there is no-one. Once there was a house, full of laughter - so warm. Trying to pretend there is someone. Someone who will care when I need it. I will now receive my comfort, conjured by the magic power of wine. Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling good. Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling fine. Just a drink to take my sorrow. Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow. Just a drink to make me feel like a man again. Now I'm down. When I walk outside, there is nowhere. Children follow me, with their laughter - so cold.... Casting just a glance at the churchyard. Casting just a glance, at my painted female friend.. Now I'm on my way, I am falling. Got to find some 'elp, ooh I will need that now. So I will receive my comfort, conjured by the magic power of wine. Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling good. Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling fine. Just a drink to take my sorrow. Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow. Just a drink to make me feel like a man again. Now I'm down....

uncertain weather,"A day of uncertain weather. Captured in a frame forever. A face in a faded photograph. He must have had a life. Maybe with a family. People who meant everything to him. A sinner, a saint, a soldier. Caught up in a war he never. Had a chance to start or build a life. All gone long ago. Leaving no trace. Disappearing like smoke in the wind. To become just a face without a name. Leaving no trace. Disappearing like smoke in the wind. Hopes and fears important plans. Forgotten memories. Footsteps fading in the sand, ooh. Schemes and dreams small and grand. Nothing left to see. Footsteps fading in the sand, ooh. Someone who cast a shadow. Maybe just a lazy man. Doesn't make much difference now it's true. A day of uncertain weather. Captured in a frame forever. A face in a faded photograph. All gone long ago. Leaving no trace. Disappearing like smoke in the wind. To become just a face without a name. One more to add to the total. Of those never heard of again. Yes he's gone. Just a face without a name. Leaving no trace. Disappearing like smoke in the wind. All gone. Just a face without a name. Leaving no trace. Disappearing like smoke in the wind...."

Cold, they prepare for a sleepless night.. Maybe this will be their last fight.. But we're safe in each other's embrace,. All fears go out as I look on your face -. Better think awhile.

vancouver,"Released as B-side of ""Many Too Many"" single, 1978.. . She packed her bags and dressed. Long before the sunrise. No one knew. She told them many times. About how she would teach them. And now it's time. Standing quietly by the door. Her face is numb with fear. She stops and then goes on. ""Leave forever - it's now or never"". Quickly walking down the street. It's cold and grey, dawn's breaking. She don't mind (she don't mind). Why she feels so grown up now. Her life is just beginning. She don't know (she don't know). She's standing in the pouring rain. Her make-up's running down. She wonders now she's here. ""Where will I go? Who do I know?"". Now, now she's not quite so sure. I may be wrong but home seems so much more friendly now. And they might worry but she doesn't want them to. Cos causing pain, that's not the thing that she set out to do. So she's back in bed before. Anyone can miss her. She feels good (she feels good). Knowing the chance was there. Deciding not to take it. That's her choice (that's her choice). She's still awake, her mum comes in. ""Me and dad, we've had a chat. And we're sorry for the things we said."
visions of angels,"Standing in a forest gazing at the sun. looking at the trees but there's not even one. See a rippling stream that smiles and then goes by. run to feel its comfort but the water's dry.. I see her face and run to take her hand. Whey she's never there I don't understand. The trumpets sound my whole world crumbles down. Visions of angels all around. dance in the sky. Leaving me here. forever goodbye.. As the leaves will crumble so will fall my love. for the fragile beauty of our lives must fade. Though I once remember echoes of my youth. now I sense no past, no love that ends in love. Take this dream the stars have filled with light. As the blossom glides like snowflakes from the trees. In vengeance to a god no-one can reach.. Visions of angels all around. dance in the sky. Leaving me here. forever goodbye.. Ice is moving and world's begun to freeze. see the sunlight stopped and deadened by the breeze. Minds are empty bodies move insensitive. some believe that when they die they really live. I believe there never is an end. God gave up this world its people long ago. Why she's never there I still don't understand. Visions of angels all around. dance in the sky. Leaving me here. forever goodbye.. Visions of angels all around. dance in the sky. Leaving me here."

Maybe the lizard's shed its tail,. This is the end of man's long union with Earth.. Judge not this race by empty remains. Do you judge God by his creatures when they are dead?. For now, the lizard's shed it's tail. This is the end of man's long union with Earth.. From life alone to life as one,. Think not now your journey's done. For though your ship be sturdy, no.

I can see in the softness there. Where the sunshine is gliding in. Fill your mind with love. Find the world of future glory. You can meet yourself. Where the sour turns to sweet.

white mountain,"Thin hung the web like a trap in a cage. The fox lay asleep in his lair. Fangs frantic paws told the tale of his sin. Far off the chase shrieked revenge. Outcast he trespassed where no wolf may tread. The last sacred haunt of the dead. He learnt of a truth which only one wolf may know. The sceptre and crown of the king. Howling for blood, One-eye leads on the pack. Plunging through forests and snow-storms. Steep rose the ridge, ghostly peaks climbed the sky. Fang sped through jungles of ice. Hard on his rail, One-eye drew from the pack. An old hero conquered by none. Steep, far too steep, grew the pathway ahead. Descent was the only escape. A wolf never flees in the face of his foe. Fang knew the price he would pay. One-eye stood before him. With the crown upon his head. Sceptre raised to deal the deadly blow. Fang, Son of Great Fang, the Traitor we seek. The laws of the Brethren say this:. That only the King sees the Crown of the Gods. And he, the Ursurper must die -. Snarling he tore at the throat of his foe. But Fang fought the hero in vain. Dawn saw the white mountain tinted with red. Never would the Crown leave again. One-eye hid the Crown and with laurels on his head. Returned amongst the tribe and dwelt in peace."

window,"Slowly I stretch out my arms, freely. Shadows of night disappear. Rise from the slough of despond, find the pathway. Guiding us forward through pastures of dream day. Days to enjoy, peace I knew once before me. Dawning to dusk on the hills until morning. Come see me take my hand. Come see me in my land. Flying invisibly high, watch me. All on a beautiful sky, I'll be. Clear and serene in the love I've discovered. Long search is over, the soul is uncovered. Resting on joy that abounds without ceasing. Bidding farewell to the fears now decreasing. Come see me take my hand. Come see me in my land. High on a golden crested wave she sits. The little nymphs dance in her hair. The trees all beckon to the sky to bless their empty lives. Horizons come to sip wine there. The veiled mist reveals the wandering ship upon the reef. The albatross flies to the stern. But only Jack Frost saw the kiss you gave him in return. Crossing the mountains of truth see them. Soaring majestically high, and then. Stop at the warning light, see it flash brightly. Thunder awakes me, the crashes beside me. Shatters the scene and brings chaos to beauty. Leading us forward where destiny may be. Come see me take my hand."
