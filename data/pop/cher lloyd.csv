where is the love,"What's wrong with the world mama?. People living like aint got no mamas. I think the whole worlds addicted to the drama. Only attracted to the things that bring you trauma. Overseas yeah we tryin to stop terrorism. But we still got terrorists here livin. In the USA the big CIA the Bloodz and the Crips and the KKK. But if you only have love for your own race. Then you only leave space to discriminate. And to discriminate only generates hate. And if you hatin you're bound to get irate. Yeah madness is what you demonstrate. And that's exactly how anger works and operates. You gotta have love just to set it straight. Take control of your mind and meditate. Let your soul gravitate to the love y'all. People killing people dying. Children hurtin you hear them crying. Can you practice what you preach. Would you turn the other cheek?. Father Father Father help us. Send some guidance from above. Cause people got me got me questioning. Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the love2x). It just ain't the same all ways have changed. New days are strange is the world the insane?. If love and peace so strong. Why are there pieces of love that don't belong. Nations dropping bombs. Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones. With ongoing suffering. As the youth die young. So ask yourself is the loving really strong?. So I can ask myself really what is going wrong. With this world that we living in. People keep on giving in. Makin wrong decisions. Only visions of them livin and. Not respecting each other. Deny thy brother. The wars' going on but the reasons' undercover. The truth is kept secret. Swept under the rug. If you never know truth. Then you never know love. Where's the love y'all?(I don't know). Where's the truth y'all?(I don't know). Where's the love y'all?. People killing people dying. Children hurtin you hear them crying. Can practice what you preach. Would you turn the other cheek?. Father father father help us. Send some guidance from above. Cause people got me got me questioning. Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the lovex2). I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder. As I'm getting older y'all people get colder. Most of us only care about money makin. Selfishness got us followin the wrong direction. Wrong information always shown by the media. Negative images is the main criteria. Infecting their young minds faster than bacteria. Kids wanna act like what the see in the cinema. Whatever happened to the values of humanity. Whatever happened to the fairness and equality. Instead of spreading love, we're spreading anomosity. Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling under. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling down. It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feeling under. I gotta keep my faith alive, until love is found. People killing people dying. Children hurtin you hear them crying. Can you practice what you preach. Would you turn the other cheek?.

what i like,"I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it. Oh baby, that's what I like. We in the goon grade, goose with the sprite. Loose sipping dreaming juice, wild for the night. She wanna find out if the dog bites. Oh baby, that's what I like. We hitting the front row, all up in the street. Brim when she say my name, last she a freak. She wanna get down on the first night. Oh baby, that's what I like. I got them like. Going down!. I got these French chicks tryina French kiss in my ear. They telling me like I'm. Going down!. 'Cause when I rock and write 7 days a week.

Now, we in the bar no charge getting drunk. Hot ladies taking shots like it's Starbucks. College girls they just wanna party all night. Oh baby, that's what I like. Alright, body shots, making a scene. Straight A's over C's but she's taking a D. And if I hit it once she'll be begging for it twice. Oh baby, that's what I like. I got 'em like. Going down!. These chicks tell me I'm the fresh prince. If not, the next best since. I'm the. Going down!. 'Cause when I rock and write 7 days a week. I got 'em singing like. (x2).

Go give me one for the money, two for the rhythm. Three for these beautiful women that ever giving me attention. Now that I made rapping my profession. They undressing bodies looking like perfection it's a blessing. I'm an east coast kid on a west coast life. Drive on a quest like q tip and fife. And would you bring a friend if I ask real nice?. Oh baby, that's what I like. (x2). I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it. I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it. I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it. Oh baby, that's what I like.

where is the love,"What's wrong with the world mama?. People living like aint got no mamas. I think the whole worlds addicted to the drama. Only attracted to the things that bring you trauma. Overseas yeah we tryin to stop terrorism. But we still got terrorists here livin. In the USA the big CIA the Bloodz and the Crips and the KKK. But if you only have love for your own race. Then you only leave space to discriminate. And to discriminate only generates hate. And if you hatin you're bound to get irate. Yeah madness is what you demonstrate. And that's exactly how anger works and operates. You gotta have love just to set it straight. Take control of your mind and meditate. Let your soul gravitate to the love y'all. People killing people dying. Children hurtin you hear them crying. Can you practice what you preach. Would you turn the other cheek?. Father Father Father help us. Send some guidance from above. Cause people got me got me questioning. Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the love2x). It just ain't the same all ways have changed. New days are strange is the world the insane?. If love and peace so strong. Why are there pieces of love that don't belong. Nations dropping bombs. Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones. With ongoing suffering. As the youth die young. So ask yourself is the loving really strong?. So I can ask myself really what is going wrong. With this world that we living in. People keep on giving in. Makin wrong decisions. Only visions of them livin and. Not respecting each other. Deny thy brother. The wars' going on but the reasons' undercover. The truth is kept secret. Swept under the rug. If you never know truth. Then you never know love. Where's the love y'all?(I don't know). Where's the truth y'all?(I don't know). Where's the love y'all?. People killing people dying. Children hurtin you hear them crying. Can practice what you preach. Would you turn the other cheek?. Father father father help us. Send some guidance from above. Cause people got me got me questioning. Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the lovex2). I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder. As I'm getting older y'all people get colder. Most of us only care about money makin. Selfishness got us followin the wrong direction. Wrong information always shown by the media. Negative images is the main criteria. Infecting their young minds faster than bacteria. Kids wanna act like what the see in the cinema. Whatever happened to the values of humanity. Whatever happened to the fairness and equality. Instead of spreading love, we're spreading anomosity. Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling under. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling down. It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feeling under. I gotta keep my faith alive, until love is found. People killing people dying. Children hurtin you hear them crying. Can you practice what you preach. Would you turn the other cheek?. Father Father Father help us. Send some guidance from above. Cause people got me got me questioning. Where is the love?(fade)"

where is the love,"What's wrong with the world mama?. People living like aint got no mamas. I think the whole worlds addicted to the drama. Only attracted to the things that bring you trauma. Overseas yeah we tryin to stop terrorism. But we still got terrorists here livin. In the USA the big CIA the Bloodz and the Crips and the KKK. But if you only have love for your own race. Then you only leave space to discriminate. And to discriminate only generates hate. And if you hatin you're bound to get irate. Yeah madness is what you demonstrate. And that's exactly how anger works and operates. You gotta have love just to set it straight. Take control of your mind and meditate. Let your soul gravitate to the love y'all. People killing people dying. Children hurtin you hear them crying. Can you practice what you preach. Would you turn the other cheek?. Father Father Father help us. Send some guidance from above. Cause people got me got me questioning. Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the love2x). It just ain't the same all ways have changed. New days are strange is the world the insane?. If love and peace so strong. Why are there pieces of love that don't belong. Nations dropping bombs. Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones. With ongoing suffering. As the youth die young. So ask yourself is the loving really strong?. So I can ask myself really what is going wrong. With this world that we living in. People keep on giving in. Makin wrong decisions. Only visions of them livin and. Not respecting each other. Deny thy brother. The wars' going on but the reasons' undercover. The truth is kept secret. Swept under the rug. If you never know truth. Then you never know love. Where's the love y'all?(I don't know). Where's the truth y'all?(I don't know). Where's the love y'all?. People killing people dying. Children hurtin you hear them crying. Can practice what you preach. Would you turn the other cheek?. Father father father help us. Send some guidance from above. Cause people got me got me questioning. Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the lovex2). I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder. As I'm getting older y'all people get colder. Most of us only care about money makin. Selfishness got us followin the wrong direction. Wrong information always shown by the media. Negative images is the main criteria. Infecting their young minds faster than bacteria. Kids wanna act like what the see in the cinema. Whatever happened to the values of humanity. Whatever happened to the fairness and equality. Instead of spreading love, we're spreading anomosity. Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling under. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling down. It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feeling under. I gotta keep my faith alive, until love is found. People killing people dying. Children hurtin you hear them crying. Can you practice what you preach. Would you turn the other cheek?.

I guess I need you, baby. And everytime I see you in my dreams. I see your face. It's haunting me. I guess I need you, baby. I may have made it rain. Please forgive me. My weakness caused you pain. And this song's my sorry. And everytime I try to fly. I fall without my wings. I feel so small. I guess I need you, baby. And everytime I see you in my dreams. I see your face. You're haunting me. I guess I need you, baby"
goodnight,"What if daddy was right?. What if there's no forever?. Would you kiss me goodnight?. So that I could remember?. Keep you frozen in time. Like they do in the pictures. And if I close my eyes. Would I still think of patience?. Stay with me, don't disappear. To tell the truth, I need you here. I'm afraid, I can barely breath. I need your words, to comfort me. Say goodnight, would you say goodnight?. What if daddy was right?. And I knew all the answers?. But they could give me the world. But that wouldn't matter. And if the gates open wide, and make you an angel. Two tears in my eyes, I'd save you're seat at the table. Stay with me, don't disappear. To tell the truth, I need you here. I'm afraid, I can barely breath. I need your words, to comfort me. Say goodnight, would you say goodnight?"

Oh baby, that's what I like. I got them like. Going down!. I got these French chicks tryina French kiss in my ear. They telling me like I'm. Going down!. 'Cause when I rock and write 7 days a week.

Now, we in the bar no charge getting drunk. Hot ladies taking shots like it's Starbucks. College girls they just wanna party all night. Oh baby, that's what I like. Alright, body shots, making a scene. Straight A's over C's but she's taking a D. And if I hit it once she'll be begging for it twice. Oh baby, that's what I like. I got 'em like. Going down!. These chicks tell me I'm the fresh prince. If not, the next best since. I'm the. Going down!. 'Cause when I rock and write 7 days a week. I got 'em singing like. (x2).

where is the love,"What's wrong with the world mama?. People living like aint got no mamas. I think the whole worlds addicted to the drama. Only attracted to the things that bring you trauma. Overseas yeah we tryin to stop terrorism. But we still got terrorists here livin. In the USA the big CIA the Bloodz and the Crips and the KKK. But if you only have love for your own race. Then you only leave space to discriminate. And to discriminate only generates hate. And if you hatin you're bound to get irate. Yeah madness is what you demonstrate. And that's exactly how anger works and operates. You gotta have love just to set it straight. Take control of your mind and meditate. Let your soul gravitate to the love y'all. People killing people dying. Children hurtin you hear them crying. Can you practice what you preach. Would you turn the other cheek?. Father Father Father help us. Send some guidance from above. Cause people got me got me questioning. Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the love2x). It just ain't the same all ways have changed. New days are strange is the world the insane?. If love and peace so strong. Why are there pieces of love that don't belong. Nations dropping bombs. Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones. With ongoing suffering. As the youth die young. So ask yourself is the loving really strong?. So I can ask myself really what is going wrong. With this world that we living in. People keep on giving in. Makin wrong decisions. Only visions of them livin and. Not respecting each other. Deny thy brother. The wars' going on but the reasons' undercover. The truth is kept secret. Swept under the rug. If you never know truth. Then you never know love. Where's the love y'all?(I don't know). Where's the truth y'all?(I don't know). Where's the love y'all?. People killing people dying. Children hurtin you hear them crying. Can practice what you preach. Would you turn the other cheek?. Father father father help us. Send some guidance from above. Cause people got me got me questioning. Where is the love?(where is the lovex3)(the lovex2). I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder. As I'm getting older y'all people get colder. Most of us only care about money makin. Selfishness got us followin the wrong direction. Wrong information always shown by the media. Negative images is the main criteria. Infecting their young minds faster than bacteria. Kids wanna act like what the see in the cinema. Whatever happened to the values of humanity. Whatever happened to the fairness and equality. Instead of spreading love, we're spreading anomosity. Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling under. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling down. It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feeling under. I gotta keep my faith alive, until love is found. People killing people dying. Children hurtin you hear them crying. Can you practice what you preach. Would you turn the other cheek?. Father Father Father help us. Send some guidance from above. Cause people got me got me questioning. Where is the love?(fade)"
