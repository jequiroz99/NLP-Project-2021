cardiac arrest,"Cardiac Arrest. Papers in the morning. Bowler hat on head. Walking to the bus stop. He's longing for his bed. Waiting with his neighbours. In the rush-hour queue. Got to get the first bus. So much for him to do. He's got to hurry got to get his seat. Can't miss his place, got to rest his feet. Ten more minutes till he gets there. The crossword's nearly done. It's getting so hard these days. Not nearly so much fun. His mind wanders to the office. His telephone, desk and chair. He's been happy with the company. They've treated him real fair. Think of seven letters begin and end in 'C'. Like a big American car but misspelt with a 'D'. I wish this bus'd get a move on. Driver's taking his time. I just don't know I'll be late. Oh dear, what will the boss say?. Pull yourself together now. Don't get in a state. Don't you worry, there's no hurry. It's a lovely day. Could all be going your way. Take the doc's advice. Let up, enjoy your life. Listen to what they say. It's not a game they play. Never get there at this rate. He's caught up in a jam. There's a meeting this morning. It's just his luck, oh damn. His hand dives in his pocket. For his handkerchief. Pearls of sweat on his bowler. His pulse-beat seems so brief. Eyes fall on his wrist-watch, the seconds pass real slow. Gasping for the hot air but the chest pain it won't go. Tried to ask for help. But can't seem to speak a word. Words are whispered frantically. But don't seem to be heard. What about the wife and kids?. They all depend on me. We're so sorry, we told you not to hurry. Now it's just too late. You've got a certain date. We thought we made it clear. We all voiced our inner fears. We left it up to you. There's nothing we can do."

clerkenwell polka,I request that the best of our minds. Be impressed to repent of their crimes. For the truth is there all for to see. What can be said in defence of man's tyranny. To declare to contempt of the view. That to conform to the norm is what you do. If you live wracked in anger and in shame. The only road you find's that hard road my friend. I concur to defer to the sound. Of discontent when it's meant by the crowd. If in fairness is how you see it end. The only road you'll walk's that hard road my friend. And the papers they were printing they did sell. In Clerkenwell there were presses turning. And the emigrees they boarded ships and sailed. They could not fail to bring passions burning. La da da da-da. Why deny that the lie that is sent. Makes you live work and die for some rent. If you're happy then to leave it up to them. The only road you'll know's that hard road my friend. We resent the intent of the few. Who do conspire to acquire what's our due. If you don't know you're rights and defend. The only road you'll goes that hard road my friend. If you fall and you crawl towards debt. And the sum it is more than what was leant. If you can't keep your eyes on the change. The only road you'll walk's that bloody road my friend. Ah yip da didi didi dee. Ah yip da didi didi dee. Ah yip da didi didi dee. Ah yip da didi didi dee

coldest day,"No I never heard through the grapevine. How you left long before your time. But in France on the radio. I could not understand a word. But I felt you go. We waited all night for the midnight lover's calling. It was the coldest day of the year. And I'm still thawing. I didn't sleep a wink. But while radio played. I was day dreaming. Of what might have been. While the cold night air was freezing. The coldest night. The coldest day of the year. What is happening mother father please. Who will save us from the autumn breeze. Shivering to a halt no one wants to speak too soon. Although we all knew under the pale blue moon. The pale moon. The pale blue moon. What happens then when the sun goes down. Tell me what's the word Johannesburg. When the rent goes up and the lights go down. On the coldest day outside the coldest town. We waited all night and I'm still falling. I didn't sleep a wink. But while radio played. I was day dreaming. Of what might have been. While the cold night air was freezing. The coldest night. The coldest day of the year. The coldest night. The coldest day of the year. The coldest night, day, year.."

People talk about me behind my back. They dont understand its the passion they lack. People go around and whisper my name. They think its a laugh because I never complain. But to my face they are always the same. They dont understand its a crying shame. you always sais that you needed me,. Exactly what for I find it hard to see. I've sat up all night wishing you were still mine. Now I understand theres better things to do with my Time. I cry cos my heart is in pain. I cry though I know its in vain.

decieves the eye,"In the earliest days of my shoplifting career,. You could safely say I was filled with fear.. It was nail biting work from the very start,. But several quick sucesses soon gave me heart.. After a while I could pick or nick or steal,. Some shirts some trousers and a few LPs.. No-one ever stopped me, they didn't seem to care.. It sometimes seemed to me that there was no-one there.. Then a fine summers day my mates and me,. Set off down the westend on our usual spree.. Things were as normal for an hour or so,. Then my nimble hands were a bit too slow.. Two store detectives made a fast approach,. One grabbed my jacket (you're nicked!). The other grabbed my throat.. So they caught me at last, one said with joy:. ""You'll have to do some time, my light fingered boy!"". If only I'd remembered my common sense,. They captured me red-handed with evidence.. If I go to the manager and say I'm sorry,. Maybe he'll forgive me for my youthful folly.. But what will me social worker say,. If I don't come home today?. He'll give me a clout!. What if they don't let me out?. I told him I'm on me own!. Don't they understand?. I'm from a broken home!. I'll tell them I'm the product of a broken home,. And I always went out on my own.. Was it too late to say I'd pay,. And I'll never steal again 'till the end of my days?. Because I have no friends to call as such,. Money and posessions I did not have much,. So I started to steal in order to get by.. The quickness of the hand deceives the eye.. deceives the eye the eye the eye...."

going to the top,When you're going to the top and you have no time to stop. Then you have to travel light and you'd better go by night. Cause its not a pretty sight when you're going to the top. And you're never going to stop and you won't let nobody block. Your way to the top. And though bodies they may fall old friends up against the wall. Can't let feelings in the way as if you had some anyway. Some will have to move aside true intent you'll always hide. Wagging tongues may call you snide you may not know who's on your side. When you're going to the top. But you could let it go tonight. Watch it all fade out of sight. There's still some time to mend your ways. Don't you know its love that pays. Still you've heard it all before and I don't want to be a bore. So I'll just be on my way maybe we will meet one day. Probably won't have much to say if I see you passing by. Cause you're going much to high and you may well never stop. Cause you're going to the top. Maybe we will meet one day. Probably won't have much to say. So I'll just say toodle ooh and the best of luck to you. When I see you passing by when you're going much too high. When you're going to the top. When you're going to the toooooooop. When you're going to the toooooooop. But you could take my hand tonight. We'd let it all fade out of sight. There's still some time to mend your ways.
grey day,"When I get home it's late at night,. I'm black and bloody from my life,. I haven't time to clean my hands,. Cuts will only sting me through my dreams.. It's well past midnight as I lie. In a semi-conscious state.. I dream of people fighting me. Without any reason I can see.. In the morning I awake,. My arms my legs my body aches,. The sky outside is wet and grey. So begins another weary day.. So begins another weary day.. After eating I go out,. People passing by me shout.. I can't stand this agony. Why don't they talk to me?. In the park I have to rest. I lie down and I do my best,. The rain is falling on my face. I wish I could sink without a trace.. In the morning I awake,. My arms my legs my body aches,. The sky outside is wet and grey,. So begins another weary day.. So begins another weary day.. In the park I have to rest. I lie down and I do my best,. The rain is falling on my face. I wish I could sink without a trace.. In the morning I awake,. My arms my legs my body aches,. The sky outside is wet and grey,. So begins another weary day.. So begins another weary day.."
guns,"(Yoohoo, etc. Oh Hello. Hello.). I read a brand new paper. About a man who had a thousand guns. Lived in the Southern States. Ran away from everyone. Felt it wasn't safe. Even in the Southern States. I read a brand new paper. Walking down my own street. The man with a thousand guns. Has taken to his feet. He felt it wasn't safe. Even in the Southern States. He thought that he might die. But was he frightened by. Anyone with a gun?. Well, every stranger's danger. Everybody has one. But alone and hungry. He couldn't eat his...... Guns. I watched my television. Sitting on the floor. The window man was watching. Me and a million more. He read me the news. Someone's getting abused. He thought that we might die. He wasn't frightened why. Everyone has a bomb. It's a passing danger. Or so he said. Everybody has one. Care to see or just wait. (That's just great)."

in the middle of the night,"Nice man George, newsagent on the corner. Not very rich, but never any poorer. Jaunty old George, a happy sixty-three. Not very tall, but healthier than me. He whistles timeless tunes as he saunters down the street. Springs in his legs and elastic in his feet. But in the middle of the night, he steals through your garden. Gives your hosiery a fright and doesn't say pardon. As soft as a breeze with an arm full of underwear. On his hands and knees, dreams about the knicker scare. Hello there George, newsagent on the corner. How's the old car, yes the climate's getting warmer. Chatty old George as you get your morning paper. Read about the knicker thief, underwear taker. Bids you 'Good day', as you wander out the door. Never closes early, always cleans the floor. But when darkness hits the town and there's washing on your line. Get your knickers down, before the dreaded sign. When the clock strikes eight and you're snuggled up in bed. He'll be at the garden gate, filling underwear with dread. Nice man George, newsagent on the corner. He was closed today, maybe gone to mow the lawn. I had to go further down the road to get me current bun. Hello, isn't that George on page one ?. No it couldn't be, but yes it is. Difficult to see from these photofits. But they are after him, of that you can be sure. They've called him on the phone, they've knocked on his door. a-But he's gone away, gone to stay with some mates. He got the papers early and saw his own face."

It seems like a million years ago. That he left his life behind. The moment came for him to go. He said goodbye to his wife and child. He started out walking. Never looked back. It was too much pain. Between Glasgow and London. One hot summer he forgot his name. Can you remember his name?. Doo doodle eh do do. But he started out. Standing on corners. And talking out loud too loud. You see he couldn't believe in himself the world. Or anything he heard. Can you remember his name?. Doo doodle eh do do. Can you remember his name?. Doo doodle eh do do. Ditto Woooh!.

lola,"I met her in a club down in Old Soho. Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry-cola. C-o-l-a cola. She walked up to me and she asked me to dance. I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said, Lola. L-o-l-a Lola la-la-la-la Lola. Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy. But when she squeezed me tight, she nearly broke my spine. Oh my Lola L-o-l-a Lola. And I'm not dumb but I can't understand. Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man. Lola L-o-l-a Lola la-la-la-la Lola. We drank champagne and danced all night. Under electric candlelight. She picked me up and sat me on her knee. And said, ""little boy, won't you come home with me"". Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy. But when I looked in her eyes I almost fell for my Lola. L-o-l-a Lola la-la-la-la Lola. Lola L-o-l-a Lola la-la-la-la Lola. I pushed her away. I walked to the door. I fell to the floor. I got down on my knees. Then I looked at her and she at me. Well, that's the way that I wanted to stay. And I always want it to be that way for my Lola. Lo-la Lola. Girls will be boys and boys will be girls. It's a mixed up, muddled up, shooked up world except for Lola. Lo-la la-la-la-la Lola. Well, I left home just a week ago. And I'd never kissed a woman before. But Lola smiled and took me by the hand. And said little boy I'm gonna make you a man. Well, I'm not the world's most masculine man. But I know what I am, I'm glad I'm man. And so is Lola"

Memories can make you cry. I close my eyes, my tears I try to hide. I was thinking about. Tammo land. Of all the funny places. I was thinking a short time ago. Catch me, I'm falling into my past.

mk ii,"There's a MKII parked on the cobbles. Of a Chelsea Mews, and out of the shadows. Steps a figure, silver mohair bright. Into the moonshine out in to the night. And in the darkness, one stray moonbeam. Creeps through the curtains on the unmade bed. She stares at the ceiling, just an empty feeling. He starts the Jaguar and drives away. And no one breathes a word. Cos even breathing can be heard. Right through the silver screen. They've made inquiries, they'll make it easy. But she won't answer cos she's not really there. He throws his gloves out the open window. He lights a cigarette and drives away. He starts the Jaguar and drives away....."
mr speaker gets the word,Wriggles from his captor's arms. Mr speaker gets the word and. Running now from the alarms. Speaks his mind free as a bird. Free now to roam around. Stand up straight when he quotes. Spread the word that he has found. Books of verse and scribbled notes. Mister speaker gets the word. (To tell the secrets he has heard). Speaks so fast his words are slurred. (Mister speaker gets the word). Stands up straight outside my door. I bring you now the words I've learned. To whom it may concern senor. Tell my friends I have returned. Mister speaker gets the word. (To tell the secrets he has heard). Speaks so fast his words are slurred. (Mister speaker gets the word). Excitement rages through his brain. Stirred and stirred throughout the years. Not enough time to explain. Eyes of many sighs of fear. Making space from Colney Hatch Lane. Just some poetry my friend. Scuttles past my window frame. Vanishes right round the bend. Mister speaker gets the word. (To tell the secrets he has heard). Speaks so fast his words are slurred. (Mister speaker gets the word).

mummy's boy,"In the pub, about seven thirty. Mother makes sure that his face ain't dirty. Him and mother go everywhere. Holds her hand without a care. Lived with mother for fourty years.

my girl,My girl's mad at me. I didn't wanna go see the film tonight. I found it hard to say. She thought I'd had enough of her. Why can't she see. She's lovely to me?. But I like to stay in. And watch t.v. on my own. Every now and then. My girl's mad at me. Been on the telephone for an hour. We hardly said a word. I tried and tried but I could not be heard. Why can't I explain?.

never ask twice aka airplane,"Please observe my continental alligator skin line shoulder bag. I've covered it in stickers from far and wide. And stuffed it full of suits and matching ties. I've travelled on the seas and I've travelled on the land. And there's not a single person I can't understand. I've forgotten the languages and wave my cash. I've enjoyed every minute of it with a splash. I wear a Panama on my Brilcremed hair. I think I carry it with a certain flair. When travelling abroad I know the score. With the voice of authority from the first a-world war. I went all through to Congo on a magic pleasure knock. Staving off disease with hallucinogenic drugs. With a mind-bending root from a local native source. Made my mind and my body have a premature divorce. I felt like I was sliding from a massive height. It seemed like it was morning in the middle of the night. My eyes were open, though there's nothing much to see. A swirling mist of images. The seas are my friend and the skies my home. When clinging to the arm-rests, I travel alone. I'm always ready to give advice. Travelling companions never ask twice. I've travelled on the seas and I've travelled on the land. And there's not a single person I can't understand. I've forgotten the languages and wave my cash. I've enjoyed every minute of it with a splash. I've travelled on the seas and I've travelled on the land. And there's not a single person I can't understand. I've forgotten the languages and wave my cash. I've enjoyed every minute of it with a splash."
never knew your name,"It was very late in the discotheque. I was feeling blue as i sometimes do. I turned around it was time to go. A face in the crowd a face i didn't know. We got to talking for a little while. You said it's not the sort of thing you usually do. Talking to strangers so late in the night. These days you never know. Well i thought you were nice i even told you so. But you smiled so shyly and said to me. I bet you say that to all the girls you meet. But it isn't so. Yes, the club was closing so we had to leave. We walked out together just a little ill at ease. I would have liked to have walked you home. But you said you'd catch the bus so i ended up alone. I never knew your name nor your telephone number. Will i ever see you again? i wonder?. It wasn't any longer than an hour or two. That lonely street i said goodbye to you. You glanced back at me as i turned the corner. Was the last i saw of you. Oh i wanted to call, call out your name. But stupid pride and idiot shame. Hesitated, scared of playing the fool. So you walked away, from mr cool. I never knew your name nor your telephone number. Will i ever see you again? i wonder?. No, i never knew your name nor your telephone number. Will i see you again? oh girl i wonder?. It was very late in the discotheque. I was feeling blue as i sometimes do. I thought you were nice i told you so. But i ended up alone. No, i never knew your name nor your telephone number. Will i ever see you again? girl, i wonder?.

new delhi,New Delhi at three A.M.. Just arrived by K.L.M.. Left the airport in the heat. In the bus strange people meet. Driving through the starless night. Passing very unusual sights. Left the bus at five to five. Caught a taxi started to drive. He thought I was a millionaire. And accordingly put up the fare. Dawn was breaking in the east. Causing this hot night to cease. Mosquitos buzzing in my ears. Grating sound of clashing gears. Burning rubber filled the air. Taxi driver began to swear. The heat was burning my head was turning. It was then the car broke down. Just on the outskirts of town. A camel from the Dhrangadhra. Silently passed by our car. A vulture circled high above in the air. I had to shade my eyes to cover the glare. Sweating in the plastic seats. Hard to breathe in the increasing heat. Lying back my mind started to. Drift into an uneasy sleep. I dreamt I was in New Delhi. Slowly dying of la grippe.
night boat to cairo,"It's just gone noon half past monsoon. On the banks of the river Nile. Here comes the boat only half-afloat. Oarsman grins a toothless smile. Only just one more to this desolate shore. Last boat along the river Nile. Doesn't seem to care, no more wind in his hair. As he reaches his last half mile. The oar snaps in his hand before he reaches dry land. But the sound doesn't deafen his smile. Just pokes at wet sand with an oar in his hand. Floats off down the river Nile. Floats off down the river Nile. All aboard, night boat to Cairo. Night boat to Cairo."
no money,She'd gotten used to the idle life. Following the sun was her full time occupation. A lesson to us all footloose for the education. Oh but look at her now foxtrotting the globe. With her head in the clouds. I haven't got no money to keep this affair afloat. And I don't think that its funny it looks like I've sunk my boat. But she'll keep me dangling on and on and on. Well furs and pearls I'm trapped in your pocket. Where six foot toys stumble upon it. Your high class ways have seen better days. But to me you'll always be complicating infatuating. I haven't got no money to keep this affair afloat. And I don't think that its funny it looks like I've sunk my boat. I haven't got no money to keep this affair afloat. And I don't think that its funny it looks like I've sunk my boat. But she keeps me dangling on and on and on. Royal Britannia the jet set dreams on and on. Into another sun drenched scene. Where kings and queens and jesters preen. I haven't got no money to keep this affair afloat. And I don't think that its funny it looks like I've sunk my boat. I haven't got no money to keep this affair afloat.
not home today,"She says he's gone away on a short holiday. He won't be back for awhile. The twleve from the bench stood up. And hesitated he'll be leaving. right after this trial. Circumstance, evidence who can cheat providence. He wished he could go back again. A flick of the wrist. He wished that he missed. Not guilty is all he can say. Pass 'round the gossip now. Let's wait and see. Pass 'round the tray now. Let's have some tea. My boys haven't seen him. He's been working away. Don't bother asking. he's not home today. Not home today. T-shirts and badges. With free tickles and smudges. In the end you'll believe what you feel. When ten hands are aiming. And no-one is complaining. In a sense it could be more real."
nutty theme,"Hello Good Evening And Welcome. I've been down the high road towards the crossroads. To hear the sound thats buggin me.. Catchy little rhythms in music and rhyme, its that nutty sound you see.. Rhythm..... As I got nearer I heard it clearer , it started to affect my brain. Its that nutty rhythm that gets yout thinking your almost going insane.. I felt the greound shake,. I had a feeling I was sitting on an old steam train. Shaking in me knee bones and me elbows, its driving me around the bend. Uncontrollable feelings sends me reeling,. Theres no need top pretend. Melody.... It had me spell bound, span me head round,. I could feel myself going mad.. Now I am an addict,. I have to hear it,. Everything else sounds bad......"

on the town,"Oh it's early in the morning. It's raining and the streetlights. Streaming through my windows. Casting shadows on the ceiling. The room is oh so empty. Stand against the wall. The clock is ticking loudly. It's deafening in this quiet room. (A car is quietly passing). (The door is softly closing). Oh how long have I been waiting?. (Footsteps hesitating).

one better day,"Arlington House. Address no fixed abode. An old man in a three-piece suite. Sits in the road. He stares across the water. And sees right through the lock. But on and up like outstretched hands. His mumbled words, his fumbled words. Further down there's a photo booth. A million plastic bags. And an old woman filling out. A million baggage tags. But when she get thrown out. Three bags at a time. She spies the old chap in the road. To share her bags with, she has bags of time. Surrounded by his past. On a short white line. He sits while cars pass. Either side. Takes his time. Trying to remember. One better day. A while ago when people stopped. To hear him say. Walking 'round you sometimes. Hear the sunshine. Beating down in time with the. Rhythm of your shoes. Now she has walked. Enough through rainy town. She rests her back against his. And sits down. She's trying to remember. One better day. Awhile ago when people stopped. To hear her say. Walking 'round you sometimes. Hear the sunshine. Beating down in time with the. Rhythm of your shoes. Walking 'round you sometimes. Hear the sunshine. Beating down in time with the. Rhythm of your shoes. The feeling of arriving. When you've nothing left to lose."

Lifting up another catch and slipping through the blind. It's... it's so easy. Lighting up another match to see what I can find. It's... become so easy. But after a while. You can hear yourself breathe. What seems a long long while. You can feel yourself sealed. Ones second thoughtlessness. Nobody's home. One's second thoughtlessness. One's second thoughtlessness.

primrose hill,A man opened his window and stared up Primrose Hill. Out there enjoying themselves I've seen them from this sill. Green splashed with white and red going brown. Children baiting animals running up and down. I stare out of this window. See the world go past. Slipping from the newspapers stacked against the wall. Piles of colour supplements squeeze between his fall. For a fleeting second I was up that hill. Although I've never been there I wish I was there still. I stare out of this window. See the world go past. I've read and looked at everything. I know it off by heart. Deliveries every day newspapers and food. Never had to venture out the phone has been removed. Open up the window and stare up Primrose Hill. Sitting here it's dark outside and everything is still. I stare out of this window. See the world go past. I've read and looked at everything. I know it off by heart.

prospects,"A train ride to Tuesday. A platform far away. Scarlet shades of evening move clouds of grey. Awaking, arriving. The dirty station where. He passes crowds of people who don't see him there. Here's a desert island room. For a man who's cast away. Stranded in this home from home. >From his family. Far away. Home.. Well this is it. This is it. Is this my heart. I miss you with all my heart. This is not. Is this not. My home. One shoe-lace cardboard suitcase. One passport from the Queen. One room for a light bulb. Where no-one's been. Sticks and stones, my old bones. Not like nineteen fifty-four. Then the liked me fine. But not anymore. This empty room. Where he's marooned. With nothing left to say. But in the dark. He thinks of home far away. Home.. Well this is it. This is it. Is this my heart. I miss you with all my heart. This is not. Is this not. My home. I feel cold, getting old. More than the climate's changed. Stranded on this island. The rate of exchange. Here's a desert island room. For a man who's cast-away. Today he will not be at work. There is no work anyway. How is it when you feel it. Do you wonder what gets you down. You're looking in the windows. When you walk this town."

razor blade alley,"Ooooo, I didn't talk too much, in fact not at all. But to ask for the price, I was to be no fool. Money's no time to waste or to shoot up the wall. You got the know how, the place did you take media school. She lead the way from the alley back to her house. Must not be seen going in, must not be seen coming out. She said I look mighty but thin she told me. I'm gonna give you a second helping. Ooooo, razor blade alley I've been there. Razor blade alley neither of us can. It was the prime time but the wrong place. It was my first time I hope my last date. I'm just too shy to check in. But this pain of this a razors is cutting in. Awwwoh. Ummmm, felt like a knight with the shining armour on at the time. She thought she was in a dream floating up on cloud nine. Now I awake she is nowhere, but the razor cuts deeper everywhere. Awwwoh."

It came and then went. Samantha, Samantha dear. I have to be gone. Samantha, oh Samantha dear. But ooh, she slept on. Well I've itched a thousand itches. But this one tops them all. While crouched down with an ear to the ground. I saw the call. Springing up in disbelief. The supension spilt. And peering in a bathroom mirror. Hung the men with guilt. Samantha, Samantha dear.

There was so much more I meant to say to you. You know they still want to talk about you. But they don't want anything too real. So most of the conversation revolves around. Things that happened twenty years ago. They must have told you everything has changed everything. Oh everything must change everything. Its not Saturday night Sunday morning.

shadow of fear,"I walk through Camden town in the evening,. strolling silently and hardly breathing.. Footsteps behind me slightly quicker,. the corner of my eye a shadowy flicker.. I wonder if he's after my soul again tonight.. Stops to whisper with the shadows but still keeps me in his sight.. I shout at passing strangers but they don't seem aware,. don't want to get involved in my spiritual affair.. Tonight my fears are growing worse and worse.. I feel him brewing up an evil curse.. I sense a chill creep up my spine. I want to scream but only whine. because I know it can't be true. mind's gone now legs it's up to you.. I wonder if he's after my soul again tonight.. Stops to whisper in the shadows but still keeps me in his sight.. I shout at passing strangers but they don't seem aware,. don't want to get involved in my spititual affair. I try to accept him as my partner.. He still makes cold his manic laughter.. But every time I try to turn around he throws my fears. and makes no sound he stirs them to the ground.. Acheing muscles, puff and pant I run.. To stagger home and hide behind my mum.. But even when I'm safely in my bed.. I know that he is waiting in my head.. I wonder if he's after my soul again tonight.. Stops to whisper in the shadows but still keeps me in his sight.. I shout at passing strangers but they don't seem aware,. don't want to get involved in my spiritual affair."
shadow on my house,"I loved the girl but I messed her up.. Now she's with another so I've found.. They say ""Better to have loved and lost, than not have loved at all"".. But much more than my foolish pride, has took a fall.. They all tell me about, mistakes that I have made.. And I have no doubt, my hand was overplayed.. There's a shadow on my house, the window's shed no light.. Since you've gone it seems so wrong, I can't tell day from night.. All too late I have learnt.. Burn the candle at both ends and you'll get burnt.. How could there be, a fool such as I?. To let you walk away, out of my life.. Sitting here alone all the days seem the same.. I don't know how much longer I can stand the pain.. There's a shadow on my house, the window's shed no light.. Since you've gone it seems so wrong, I can't tell day from night.."

sugar and spice,I thought I'd seen you round before. Then you came knocking on my door. You were only 16 years. And yet you took away all of my fears. I held your hand and then I knew.

the liberty of norton folgate,"This is the story of the Liberty of Norton Folgate. Old Jack Norris, 'The Musical Shrimp'. And the cadging ramble. A little bit of this. Would you like a bit of that?. But in weather like this. You should wear a coat, a nice warm hat. A needle and thread. The hand stitches of time. Battling Lavinski versus Jackie Burke. Bobbing and weaving an invisible line. So step for step and both light on our feet. We'll travel many a long, dim, silent street. Would you like a bit of this. Or a little bit of that missus. A little bit of what you like does you no harm. You know that. The perpetual steady echo of the passing beat. A continual dark river of people. In their transience and in its permanence. But when the streetlamp fills the gutter with gold. So many priceless items bought and sold. So step for step and both light on our feet. We'll travel many a long, dim, silent street - together. Once round Arnold Circus. Up through Petticoat Lane. Past The Well of Shadows. And once back round again. Arm in arm with an abstracted air, to where. The people stared at the upstairs windows. Because we are living like kings. And these days will last forever. Cos sailors from Africa, China and the Archipelago of Malay. Jump ship ragged and penniless into Shadwell's Tiger Bay. The Welsh and Irish Wagtails - mothers of midnight. The music hall carousal is spilling out into bonfire light. Sending half crazed shadows, giants. Dancing up the brick wall. Of Mr. Truman's beer factory. Waving bottles ten feet tall. Whether one calls it Spitalfields, Whitechapel,. Tower Hamlets or Bangle Town. We're all dancing in the moonlight. We're all on borrowed ground. Oh I'm just walking down to. I'm just floating down through. Won't you come with me?. To the Liberty of Norton Folgate. But wait, what's that. Dan Leno and a Lime house Gollum. Purposefully walking nowhere. Oh I'm happy just floating about (have a banana). On a Sunday afternoon. The stall holders all call and shout (to no-one in particular). Avoiding people you know. You're just basking in your own company. The Technicolor worlds going by. But you're the lead in your own movie. Cos in the Liberty of Norton Folgate. Walking wild and free. In your second hand coat. Happy just to float. In this little taste of liberty. A part of everything you see. There coming left or right. Trying to flog you stuff you don't need or want. And a smiling chap takes your hand and drags you. In his uncles restaurant (here, here, here, here). There's a Chinese man trying hard to flog you moody DVDs. You know you've seen the film, its black and white, it's got no sound. And a man's head pops up and down right across you wide screen TV. Only a fiver (how much?). Alright two for eight quid. (‘Ere y'ar, look look, I'm giving it away). Cos in the Liberty of Norton Folgate. Walking wild and free. In your second hand coat. Happy just to float. In this little piece of liberty. You're a part of everything you see. Cos it's steady old fellows, pickpockets,. dandies, extortioners and night wanderers. The feeble, the ghastly upon whom death had placed a very sure hand. Some in shreds and patches,. reeling inarticulate full of noisy and inordinate vivacity. Which jars discordantly upon the ear and. give an aching sensation to both pair of eyeballs. (noisy and inordinate vivacity). In the beginning I'd the fear of the immigrant. In the beginning was the fear of the immigrant. He's made his way down to the dark riverside. In the beginning was the fear of the immigrant. In the beginning was the fear of the immigrant. He made his home there by the dark riverside. He made his home there down by the riverside. They made their homes there down by the riverside. The city sprang from the dark river Thames. They made their home there down by the riverside. They made their homes there down by the riverside. The city sprang up from the dark mud of the Thames. I say it again. Cos in the Liberty of Norton Folgate. Walking wild and free. And in your second hand coat. Happy just to float. In this little taste of liberty. Cos you're a part of everything you see. Yes you're a part of everything you see. With a little bit of this. And a little bit of that. A little bit of what you like does you no harm. You know that"
the prince,Buster he sold the heat. with a rocksteady beat. An earthquake is erupting. but not in orange street. a ghost dance is preparing. you got to help us with your feet. If you're not in the mood to dance. step back grab yourself a seat. this may not be uptown Jamaica. but we promise you a treat. CHORUS:. Buster bowl me over. with you bogus dance. shuffle me off my feet. even if i kept on running. i'd never get to orange street. So i say there's not much left to say. for the man who set the beat. so i leave it up to you out there. to get him back on his feet. CHORUS x 1. Bring back the who is the we want the. Bring back the Prince.
the rise and fall,"These are the streets I used to walk. On summer nights, sit out and talk. That's the house where I used to live. I remember what I would give.. This is the town I won't forget. And after anger there's nothing left. Walking now round and round. Familiar sights are open ground.. Being here again. I can recall. Forgotten moments. The rise and fall.. We used to live where children play. They leave their homes a mile away. To come and stand in trees and grass. Where we once walked the memories last.. Being here again. I can recall. Forgotten moments. The rise and fall.. The sun shines east, the sun shines west. But I know where the sun shines best. Casey street in the afternoon. Once again it's over too soon.. Being here again. I can recall. Forgotten moments. The rise and fall.. Being here again. I can recall. Forgotten moments. The rise and fall.. Rise. (Rise). (Rise). Rise and fall. Rise and fall."
the sun and the rain,"It's raining again,. I'm hearing its pitter patter down.. It's wet in the street. Reflecting the lights and splashing feet,. Nowhere to go,. And nothing I have to do, have to do.. It's raining again,. I follow the Christmas lights down town.. I'm leaving the flow. Of people walking all around,. Round and round,. I hear the sound of rain falling in my ears. Washing away the weariness like tears.. I can feel my troubles running down,. Disappear into the silent sound.. Just walking along,. My clothes are soaked right through to the skin,. I haven't a doubt, that this is what life is all about,. The sun and the rain.. Scraps of paper(???) washing down the drain.. I feel the rain falling on my face. I can say there is no better place. Than standing up in the falling down. In so much rain I could almost drown.. It's raining again. A crack in the clouds reveals blue skies. I've been feeling so low(low). But now everything is on my side. The sun and the rain.. Walk with me fill my heart again. I hear the rain falling in my ears. Washing away the weariness like tears.. I can feel my troubles running down,. Disappear into the silent sound.. I feel the rain falling on my face. I can say there is no better place. Than standing up in the falling down. In so much rain I could almost drown.. Do de do do de do do do. Do de do de do de do do do."
the wizard,I can read whatâ€™s going through your mind. I can see what you hide in your eyes. Yes I'm going to put a spell on you. Just to see what you will do. I'm a wizard and there's magic in the air. I'm a sinner and my friend you'd best beware. There's music everywhere. Can you see the full moon in the sky?. Time like water flows by till we die. Every moment wasted leaves its mark. Each setting sun leaves us standing in the dark. One must forgive the noisy rushing fools. Who have no time for nature's natural school. They cannot see the life that's in their hands.
the young and the old,"Whoa oh. Staggering home everybody sings. All the old songs the cockney routines. All the old women, all the young men. Try changing places then back again. Old man in the morning,. Young man at night. Breakfast full of wisdom. Until you hit the lights. Knock back the drinks , hitch up your skirt. Fall over backwords undo your shirt. Everyone shouting what a terrible state. Age creeping backwards as it gets late. Old man in the morning,. Young man at night. Breakfast full of wisdom. Until you hit the lights. Have a quick short, forget about work. Have a couple more then you go beserk. Who cares about this morning, Wise old man. The wisdom comes up later and goes down the pan. Old man in the morning,. Young man at night. Breakfast full of wisdom. Until you hit the lights. Then another round, forget whos turn. Waking up to feel your stomach churn. Whos in the chair and whos on the floor. Incoherants knocking on the Door. Old man in the morning,. Young man at night. Breakfast full of wisdom. Until you hit the lights. Hit the Lights."
time,When I considered how my life is spent. They cry but I know that everything is heaven sent. But why do people lie when all they want is truth at their tables. The sky is looking very blue today. It's so fine I'd agree with every word you say. About it it must be said it doesn't mean much at all. Time you make changes. Time you'll add ages. Time is walking with you by your side. There's no reason that we should complain. In the night everybody looks the same. It's so sad but we don't seem to be going forward at all. (Time). (Time). Time. Time you make changes. Time you'll add ages. Time is walking with you by your side. Time you make changes. Time you'll add ages. Time is walking with you by your side. (Come on time). Time you make changes. Time you'll add ages. Time is walking with you by your side. Time gentlemen please. Time. Time.
time for tea,"Scouring through the wasteland. With an uge to take. Anything that comes into view. Only ten more puffs to tea time. I've found eating so time consuming. WIllie, oh Willie she cried. It's time for tea. WIllie, where in hell has he gone. It's time for tea. South of the wateland at your D.I.Y.. The inconsiderate rings his till. Offering plans of easy credit. Claims he'll cause a killing in the school half term. WIllie, oh Willie she cried. It's time for tea. WIllie, where in hell has he gone. It's time for tea. And welly well well well what have I found here. A hiding place made by frigid air. I think I'll try it on and give my mates a scare. They'll all be searching neither here nor there. WIllie, oh Willie she cried. It's time for tea. WIllie, where in hell has he gone. It's time for tea. Long depress of autumn breeze. Sucking on a rubber back teeth. Plays into the hands of the hardware man. Who selfishly ""I don't care""."
tiptoes,"Waking up again another sleepless night. Climbing taller buildings more dreams of flight. In a pool of sweat not knowing what to do. No more earth-bound feelings a diff'rent point of view. Moment of truth he heads towards the building. His glazed eyes stare vacantly following his feelings. No turning back the door's already shutting. Standing on his tiptoes to reach the nineteenth button. To miss a grasping hand. (I'm falling again). And squash a passer-by. (I'm falling again). He wanted to see some evidence. (I'm falling again). That he could really fly. Balanced on the edge only time could tell. Some say he was pushed, others say he fell. Standing on that rooftop his brain told him 'no'. But all the dreams in nights before told him he must go. To miss a grasping hand. (I'm falling again). And squash a passer-by. (I'm falling again). He wanted to see some evidence. (I'm falling again). That he could really fly. His questions and himself. Nearly fell on stony ground. He could've embarrassed his family. Who watched him from the crowd. Balanced on the edge only time could tell. Some say he was pushed, others say he fell. To miss a grasping hand. (I'm falling again). And squash a passer-by. (I'm falling again). He wanted to see some evidence. (I'm falling again). That he could really fly. (I'm falling ...)."
tommorows dream,"A cage of my own, this cage is my home,. And oh so alone am I.. From above all around helpless to the sound. Of my brother's cry.. Just leave us alone, we don't want to moan,. Only if you make us.. Smashed on the lock until I've had to, drop.. Tried to get my message through.. Off goes another with another's brother,. My arms try to bend across to a friend.. You can't burn me with your laser beam,. It's pointed at you and tomorrow's dream.. You'll burn my body quietly set free,. And I'll cry for you as I sway from my tree.. I'd give you my brain nothing you would gain,. Its misery seeps from you.. When leaving my cage I am in a rage. Because I know what you're up to.. When you walk away remember next day,. Not a second I've slept, awake I'll have kept.. When I reappear, don't look on in fear. My hands could kill. But they never will.. You can't burn me with your laser beam,. It's pointed at you and tomorrow's dream.. You'll burn my body quietly set free,. And I'll cry for you as I sway from my tree.."
tommorows just another day,"Trying hard, I thought I'd done my best. All my life, I can't get no rest. Some who've closed the door before. Say I can't carry on no more.. I hear them saying. Tomorrow's just another day. I hear them saying. And it gets better every day. I hear them saying. Tomorrow's just another day. Listened long, tried to take it in. All these facts leave me in the swim. It's down and down there is no up. I think that I've run out of luck.. I hear them saying. Tomorrow's just another day. I hear them saying. And it gets better every day. I hear them saying. Tomorrow's just another day. Tomorrow's just another... day. Walking now, over covered ground. There is a chance if I move around. I need a moment to reflect. On the friendships I have wrecked.. Why is it I, don't I always try ?. I hear them say. Tomorrow's just another day. I hear them say. And it gets better every day. I hear them say. Tomorrow's just another day. I hear them say. And it gets better every day. I heard them say. Tomorrow's just another day. I hear them say. Tomorrow's just another day. Tomorrow's just another.... I hear them saying. Tomorrow's just another day. I hear them saying. And it gets better every day. I hear them saying. Tomorrow's just another day."
turning blue,With the ease of a practised smile. The tears of a crocodile. Well shake then wash your hands. Of the smell of foreign land. The propaganda woman said. It might be worse you could be dead. Now we've an impressive show. Let's wind it up and watch it go. Still a strange thing to me. Is there's no place I'd rather be. Rollercoasting backwards to. Up and down and turning blue. No pie in the sky. For the small man gets smaller. But a poke in the eye. From an unwelcome caller. Still a strange thing to me. Is there's no place I'd rather be. Rollercoasting backwards to. Up and down and turning blue. Policeman's eyes on overload. A fractured island might explode. A million pieces washed ashore. From Disneyland to Warsaw. Let's have a rehearsal run. An underground holiday in the sun. Take time to sit and reflect. A white wall where the sun collects. Still a strange thing to me. Is there's no place I'd rather be. Rollercoasting backwards to. Up and down and turning blue.
uncle sam,"Here they come again hop scotching up to my door. One by one again knockety knock knocking upon my floor. Swinging on my gate they gain entry by the yard. Pulling at my hair they scream paint your thoughts upon my card. But not tonight I've got studies to examine. Tomorrow I'll be watching all the Queen's men. A talent contest on Monday with my Uncle Sam. Who now takes up all of my time he gives me things to do. 'Cause he's a wonderful man. But I'm sailing across the sea to see my Uncle Sam. I'm sailing across the sea to be with my Uncle Sam. To be with my Uncle Sam. Silly little sniggers from the women liberators. But I'll stand and hold my post. Polished buttons and erect I'll raise the flag. I'll show those women who's the most. But not tonight I've got studies to examine. Tomorrow I'll be watching all the Queen's men. A talent contest on Monday with my Uncle Sam. Who now takes up all of my time, gives me things to do. He's a wonderful man. But I'm sailing across the sea to see my Uncle Sam.

victoria gardens,"You're looking and listening and hoping. that things are changing for the better. You're trying to see if what you're teaching is the truth sir. You're looking and listening and hoping. that things will change for better. Don't want to preach or teach the blues to you now brother. I just left Victoria Gardens. And walked through cardboard city land. A burnt out star was asking. How would I like to shake his hand. I walked on in no hurry (hurry hurry hurry). And wondered where did we go wrong?. We're looking and listening and hoping. that things are changing for the better. Don't want to preach or teach the blues to you now brother. I walked on in no hurry (hurry hurry hurry).

Looking listening hoping that things are changing for the better. And trying to see if what you're teaching is the truth sir. She said it's for the good of us all. (of us all, of us all, of us all). Looking listening hoping that things are changing for the better. Don't want to preach or teach the blues to you now brother. I'm not so sure. (sure, sure, sure). And now it is early evening. I look across grey Leicester Square. A large and silent crowd were walking. Said they had every right to be there."
waltz into mischief,The latest and greatest. Amazing arrival. No conscience no shame. For the game of survival. Theives and villians. And fraudulent swindlers. Gathered in tribute. With masks of respect. A big hand hooray. Oh come all ye trustful. Let the band play. A waltz into mischief. The chairman is speaking. Instructs the apprentice. All faces are turned. To the wizard of sentence. Years of experience. Fall from his tongue. Like teardops to puddles. They ripple among. A big hand hooray. Oh come all ye trustful. Let the band play. A waltz into mischief. This king of the cowboys. Holds fast his deception. Rides their misgivings. To rapturous reception. Calls on the crowd. Of white pointed heads. To check under carpets.

when dawn arrives,"He hums tonight through his streets,. My unlatched window the tune repeats,. The kerb-crawling car winds down to a stop.. A few seconds mumble then whisks him off.. Sick and tired of abuse,. Controlled signs of hysteria,. But like when dawn arrives,. He remembers his leisure.. He runs tonight through his block,. A crack in the curtain is unlocked.. No meeting with a mother or greeting a friend. A sharp-looking boot-jack with some time to spend.. Sick and tired of abuse,. Controlled signs of hysteria,. But like when dawn arrives,. He remembers his leisure.. He cries tonight. Through his manner. I can see his conscience. Get the better. From a door-way stepped in. Shadowed leather. Exchanging handshakes for money. And pleasure.. He crawls tonight through his scum,. From my dirty window his body's numb.. Beneath the street-lamp tilts shoulders bent,. Then meets his pick-up who pays his rent.. Sick and tired of abuse,. Controlled signs of hysteria,. But like when dawn arrives,. He remembers his leisure.. His pleasure."
white heat,"Down between the sunbeams the moneylenders chat. Hiding in the shade outside a council flat. Kids in the lift looking for things to throw. And practising their aim on the heads below.

The whole world is melting.. (White white heat). I'm still not in until a week next Wednesday. I'm holidaying on the roof &copy;til the big bad wolf goes away. In the street the pavement is melting.

Hiding in the shade outside a council flat. By the hairs on my chinny chin chin. I shall not let you in.. In the street the pavement is melting. Crumbling for the luckiest girl. The whole world is melting.. (For the luckiest girl in all the world). (White, white heat)."
