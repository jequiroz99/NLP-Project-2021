ready for love,"One more time. Ready for love. I'm ready for love. Tasting the sweet of life. The heat and light of love. Again. Ready for love. I'm ready for love. Wandering why so many stars are shining. Why so many people fall in love. So many times, so many ways. Since paradise, until the end of times. We are. Ready for love. I'm ready for love. Ready to play the game. Of joy and pain of love. Again. Ready For love. I'm ready for love. Wandering why so many eyes are crying. Why so many lovers are apart. We never know, it's just a show. We only know it's over when we start. Once more. Ready for love. I'm ready for love. Learning to play by heart. This foolish art of love. Again"
