Could've been my lover. Everyday day of my life. Could've been so beautiful. Could've been so right. You can't hold what could've been. On a cold and lonely night. Could've been so beautiful. Could've been so right. You can't hold what could've been. On a cold and lonely night. No, no. How can you hold what could've been. On a cold and lonely night"

Always something breaking us in two. You and I could never live alone. But don't you feel like breaking out. Just one day on your own. Why does what I'm saying hurt you. I didn't say that we were through. Always something breaking us in two. They say two hearts should beat as one for us. We'll fight it out to see it through. I say that you won't bee too much fun for us. Though it's oh so nice to get advice it's oh so hard to do. Could we be much closer if we tried. We could stay at home and stare into each other's eyes. Maybe we could last an hour. Maybe then we'd see right through. Always something breaking us in two.

can we still be friends,"We can't play this game anymore, but. Can we still be friends?. Things just can't go on like before, but. Can we still be friends?. We had something to learn. Now it's time for the wheel to turn. Things are said one by one. Before you know it's all gone. Let's admit we made a mistake, but. Can we still be friends?. Heartbreak's never easy to take, but. Can we still be friends?. It's a strange sad affair. Sometimes seems like we just don't care. Don't waste time feeling hurt. We've been through hell together. La la la la, la la la la. Can we still be friends?. Can we still get together sometime?. Life will still go on and on and on and on. We awoke from our dream. Things are not always what they seem. Memories linger on.

can't you just adore her?,She likes chocolate in the morning. She drinks her coffee late at night. You can sense that she is guarded. But that’s alright. She’ll fall asleep while your still talking. With unfinished books beside her bed. She’ll cancel all of her appointments. And go shopping instead. CHORUS. And in spite of what is right. Far beyond what she’d except. When the moon begs the question. Will you have the answer yet?. Can’t you just adore her?. Can’t you just adore her?. She loves to watch the sunset. But she is partial to the rain. With those tears and that umbrella. Her allure goes unexplained. You made dinner in your apartment. You both assume that she’ll be late. She always has the best intentions. Her goodness is innate. CHORUS. And in spite of what is right. Far beyond what she’d except. When the moon begs the question. Will you have the answer yet. Can’t you just adore her?. Can’t you just adore her?. Why can’t you just adore her?. I like chocolate in the morning. I drink my coffee late at night

But you must see me in the corner of your eye. [Chorus]. . And now I’m ready. And now I’m ready. And now I’m ready to be. Extraordinary. Waking up to wake up some day. I am my own prey. Stopping off at a sidewalk cafe. The wind is playing in the trees. Kicking up confetti leaves. Sings as if it’s all to say. [Chorus]. And now I’m ready. And now I’m ready. And now I’m ready to be. Extraordinary. And now I’m ready. And now I’m ready. And now I’m ready to be. Extraordinary

I thought I knew you well. Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha. Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha. Oooooh.... Here comes Malone fresh in from the cure. Slaughtered the sheep lined up on my windowsill.

To the morning light. CHORUS"

Refrão:. Auh-de-doo-auh-de-doo-dah-day. Auh-de-doo-auh-de-day-dee. He whistled and he sang 'til the green woods rang. And he won the heart of a lady.. She left her father's castle gate. She left her own true lover. She left her servants and her estate. To follow her gypsy rover. Refrão. Her father mounted his fastest steed. And ranged the valley over. He sought his daughter at great speed. And her whistling gypsy rover. Refrão. At last he came to a masion fine. Down by the River Clady. And there was music and there was wine.

The Merrimack River is flowing. Thunder rolling over. Don’t say you’re not amazed when you know you are. And don’t say you’re not afraid when you know you are. Rows of boys and girls. Line up to see the world. Candy-coated promise. Just out of reach when you want it. Give me something sweet. Bring me to the brink. I’ll leave without hesitation. To a world without limitation. Rock me patient, slowly. Don’t say you’re not amazed when you know you are. And don’t say you’re not afraid when you know you are. You know you are. A world that moves too fast. A mouth of broken glass. It may not seem so painful. By January, the rain will swallow. Change will follow. Don’t say you’re not amazed when you know you are. Don’t say you’re not afraid when you know you are. You know you are. I know you are"

only hope,"Spoken:. Is your. All I know you're beautiful, you sing for me. There's a song that's inside of my soul. It's the one that I've tried. to write over and over again. I'm awake in the infinite cold. But you sing to me over and over and over again. So I lay my head back down. And I lift my hands and pray. To be only yours I pray. To be only yours I know now. You're my only hope. Sing to me the song of the stars. Of your galaxy dancing. and laughing and laughing again. When it feels like my dreams are so far. Sing to me all the plans. that you have for me over again. So I lay my head back down. And I lift my hands and pray. To be only yours I pray. To be only yours I know now. You're my only hope. I give you my destiny. Im giving you all of me. I want your symphony. Singing in all that I am. At the top of my lungs. I'm giving you all I have. So I lay my head back down. And I lift my hands and pray. To be only yours I pray. To be only yours I pray. To be only yours I know now. You're my only hope. Spoken:. Jane, you saved my life. I always miss you and I love. It's like the wind. I can't see it. But I can feel it"
pocket philosopher,"Verse One. Now I am walking on my own two feet.. The sun is shining.. My shadow is stretched across the street.. And I meet the eyes of the stranger, I can't quite place him but I wouldn't replace him.. For a second or a minute or an hour of the day.. Verse Two. I turn the corner, I was feeling good.. All the birds are humming, all the bees are buzzing.. And the trees and the leaves,. Looked a little bit greener.. And the air felt cleaner.. Yah, I’ve must been dreaming.. For a second or a minute. But maybe that’s okay.. Hey, come on let’s play a song.. Two or three or four.. Five or if you want more.. Or maybe you got somewhere else to be.. Be…… whoever you want to be!. Whatever you want to see.. Whatever you want to see.. I was awoken by the morning light.. My heart felt happy, I was quiet ready.. For the makeup or breakup.. Another good reason,. One that is pleasing.. In the world without season.. Cuz the truth is not pretty when it hits you in the face.. Hey, come on let’s play a song.. Two or three or four.. Five or if you want more.. Or maybe you got somewhere else to be.. Hey, come on let’s play a song.. Two or three or four.. Five or if you want more.. Or maybe I’ll just sing myself back to sleep."

saturate me,"The desert I wander lacks its mirage. There´s no mistaking the barrage. Of sand and wind that tears my skin. Leaving what´s without, exposing what´s within. Forsaken, left here in my barren desolate.... CHORUS. My soul is evaporating, won´t you saturate me,. won´t you saturate me. Rain down on me with life. My soul is evaporating, won´t you saturate me,. won´t you saturate me. Storm around me bring the tide. My days stretch long into the heat. As the sun brightens my defeat. My lips are chapped, they´re parched and dry. My thirst it builds with every day gone by. Forsaken, left here in my barren desolate.... CHORUS. The dunes that shift, drift and lift in the wind. Cover up my hope as I start to give in. To the cracks and creases and the dips in my will. As I am pushed toward the brink, I drink down arid swill. CHORUS."
secret love,Once I had a secret love. That lived within the heart of me. All too soon my secret love. Became impatient to be free. So I told the friendly star. The way that dreamers often do. Just how wonderful you are. And why I'm so in love with you. Now I should it from the highest hills. Even told the golden daffodils. At last my heart's an open door. And my secret love's no secret anymore. (Repeat)

someday we'll know,"Ninety miles outside Chicago. Can't stop driving I don't know why. So many questions, that need an answer. Two years later, you're still on my mind. Whatever happened to Amelia Earhart. Who holds the stars up in the sky. Is true love just once in a lifetime. Did the captain of the Titanic cry?. Someday we'll know. If love can move a mountain. Someday we'll know. Why the sky is blue. Someday we'll know why I wasn't meant for you. Does anybody know the way to Atlantis?. What the wind says when she cries?. I'm speeding by the place that I met you. For the ninety-seventh time, tonight. Someday we'll know. If love can move a mountain. Someday we'll know. Why the sky is blue. Someday we'll know. Why I wasn't meant for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Someday we'll know. Why Samson loved Delilah. One day I'll go. Dancing on the moon. Someday you'll know that I was the one for you. I bought a ticket to the end of the rainbow. Watch the stars crash in the sea. If I can ask God just one question. Why aren't you here with me, tonight?. Someday we'll know. If love can move a mountain. Someday we'll know. Why the sky is blue. Someday we'll know why I wasn't meant for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Someday we'll know. Why Samson loved Delilah.

song about home,"Could I close the door behind me. And lock myself outside alone?. Could somebody please remind me. Why this bird still hasn't still flown. To a treetop on the mountainside. Or joined an arrow in the sky. I know, I know someday I will be home. To many dreams of my house burning. Where I'm the one who struck the match. Try to find the meaning. A life on fire, a bird a will hatch. To a treetop on the mountainside. Or join an arrow in the sky. I know, I know someday I will be home. Oh I am not afraid of alone. No I am not afraid of my own missteps. There's no regrets. At least not yet. Not yet. Took a bus across the country. My bags were full, they weighed me down. And on that trail to California. Shed my skin in every town. To a treetop on the mountainside. And joined an arrow in the sky. I know, I know finally found a home. I know, I know finally found a home. For now. A home. For now"

swept away,Tried to find one more moment. Before we open our eyes. Give me something more form this ocean. That kiss that we don't have to hide. I hold you away a hand to my heart. Wildly cautious and still. I'm swept away. You allow me your sweet surrender. You're a page of old poetry. That I may have never discovered. But you read it like it was waiting for me. You smile with your eyes. Before it reaches your mouth. Wildly guarded and still. CHORUS:. I'm swept away. Like a stone that gets lost in the tide. Swept away. And I'm fighting to stay on your side. One night I'm fine and then you call and I cave. I'm just swept away. Take your hand with immediate comfort. Took your friendship right to my arms. Caught up in that feeling I've searched for. And I hardly know who you are. .... Trying so hard to stand still. CHORUS:. I'm a sensitive ..... And the weight of your words carry just what I need to hear. My questions are starting to settle. And the ocean is calm once again

Set the FLOOR on fire, when you come alive. (chorus). And we're dancin. And it feels alright. I can't control my desire. And we're dancin. And it feels alright. (yeah). And we're dancin. And it feels alright. Can't hold me down, gotta reach for the sky. And we're dancin. And it feels alright. (yeah). (verse 2). Some people don't know the love you present. They pretend but they don't understand. That it's natural, you're in a world of your own. (break). (chorus). Push it to the max. Feel the room fall at your feet. Don't you dare hold back. Cuz it feels so good inside. (instrumental solo). (break). (chrous)."

when i talk to you,"Yeah. Remember me? Feels like forever. Since the days when we were friends. Don't understand all these changes. I'm still the same, no need to pretend. Where'd it go, do you know?. Maybe it just doesn't matter. 'Cause when I try to talk to you. I feel like I'm not getting through to you. Where did we go wrong? It's hard to be strong. When I talk, when I talk to you. There were times, in the beginning. When you were there when I needed you most. We'd sit and talk about the future. And laugh about us getting old. Do you know how it feels?. I hope that you know that it matters. But when I try to talk to you. I feel like I'm not getting through to you. Where did we go wrong? It's hard to be strong. When I talk, when I talk to you. I want you to know everything that I am. Don't want to know what life would be without you. When I try to talk to you. I feel like I'm not getting through to you. Where did we go wrong? It's hard to be strong. When I talk, when I talk to you. When I talk to you. When I talk to you heyyy. When I talk to you, when i talk to you,. When I talk to you. When I talk to you."
whole of the moon,"I pictured a rainbow,. You held it in your hands,. I had flashes,. But you saw the plan,. I wandered out in the world for years,. While you just stayed in your room,. I saw the crescent,. You saw the whole of the moon,. The whole of the moon.. You were there at the turnstiles,. With the wind at your heels,. You stretched for the stars,. And you know how it feels,. To reach too high,. Too far. Too soon,. You saw the whole of the moon.. and I was grounded,. While you filled the skies,. I was dumbfounded by truth,. You cut through lies,. I saw the rain-dirty valley,. You saw brigadoon,. I saw the crescent,. You saw the whole of the moon.. I spoke about wings,. You just flew,. well I wondered, i guessed, and i tried,. You just knew,. well I sighed,. But you swooned,. I saw the crescent,. You saw the whole of the moon,. The whole of the moon.. With a torch in your pocket,. And the wind at your heels,. You climbed on the ladder,. And you know how it feels,. To reach too high,. Too far,. Too soon,. You saw the whole of the moon,. The whole of the moon.. Unicorns and cannonballs,. Palaces and piers,. Trumpets, towers, and tenemets,. Wide oceans full of tears,. Flag, rags, ferry boats,. Scimitars and scarves,. Every precious dream and vision,. Underneath the stars.. You climbed on the ladder,. With the wind in your sails,. You came like a comet,. Blazing your trail,. Too high,. Too far,. Too soon,. You saw the whole of the moon,. Whole of the moon ...."

winter wonderland,Sleigh bells ring. Are you listening. In the lane. Snow is glistening. A beautiful sight. We're happy tonight. Walking in a winter wonderland. Gone away is the blue bird. Here to stay is a new bird. He songs a love song. As we go along. Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman. And pretend that he is Parson Brown. He'll say are you married?. We'll say no man. But you can do the job. While you're in town. Later on we'll conspire. As we dream by the fire. To face unafraid. The plans that we made. Walking in a winter wonderland
