moments that matter,"Looking back on the photo album of my life. It's the little things that make us smile (that, that,. that, that make us smile). Like very first time that you discovered true love.

Just look around at the sunsets and waterfalls. And you know God's very close. 'Cause you feel the Lord's love is very close. It's like that first time that I learned my history. 'Cause my dad took the time, opened my eyes, and broke. it all down for me. I still remember my mother asking me how my day went. when I came home from school. And these are very sweet memories.

Two worlds, one family. Trust your heart. Let fate decide. To guide these lies we see. Softly tread the sand below your feet now. Two worlds, one family. Trust your heart. Let fate decide. To guide these lives we see. Raise your head up. Lift high the load. Take strength from those that need you. Build high the walls. Build strong the beams. A new life is waiting. But danger's no stranger here. No words describe a mother's tears. No words can heal a broken heart. A dream is gone, but where there's hope. Put your faith in what you most believe in. Two worlds, one family. Trust your heart. Let fate decide. To guide these lies we see. Somewhere something is calling for you. Two worlds, one family. Trust your heart. Let fate decide. Tu guide these lives we see"

whatever it takes,"Uh, oh, whatever it takes 2x. Stand outside your place down on my knees. In the pouring rain if thats what you need. To see that I ain't, ain't trying to be. Here for a day but for eternity. Not playing no games I wish you would see. Just trying to get you on the same page. If you feel half of what I feel. Then you know its kind of scary to need somebody else. But this love is necessary. Its keeping me alive. Its why my heart is beating. Its why I got to try. To get you with me. So baby. Oh Ill do whatever it takes. And I ain't going to quit it until youre here with me. Oh Ill do whatever it takes. If anybody out theres feeling the same let me hear you. say. Uh, oh, whatever it takes 2x. Id spend it all buy diamonds and pearls. Itd be worth the fall if you were my girl. Just say youll play along and Ill give you the world. I just need you near me don't care how much it hurts. I'm so determined I swear Ill make it work. Itll be all about you Ill put you first. If you feel half of what I feel. Then you know its kind of scary to need somebody else. But this love is necessary. Its keeping me alive. Its why my heart is beating. Its why I got to try. To get you with me. So baby. Oh Ill do whatever it takes. And I ain't going to quit it until youre here with me. Oh Ill do whatever it takes. If anybody out theres feeling the same let me hear you. say.

where do i go from here,"Where do I go. Every direction. Seems to be against the flow. And who will I be. What does it mean to just me. So tired of having to choose. Where I'll be and what I'm gonna do. CHORUS. Lost in confusion I feel like I'm losing it all. Where do I go from here. With all this confusion now who's gonna break my fall. There's no one left to call. Nothing is clear. Where do I go from here?. Did I let you down. My good intentions never seem to come around. And I have to believe. That there's an answer I can't see. So tired of having to choose. Where I'll be and what I'm gonna do. Lost in confusion I feel like I'm losing it all. Where do I go from here. With all this confusion now who's gonna break my fall. There's no one left to call. Nothing is clear. Where do I go from here?. I can't tell what's up or down. My head's spinning all the time. Everytime that I turn around. There's another useless sign. I wanna know but I don't know. Which way I'm gonna go. Where will I go, yeah. Which way will I go, ohhh. Lost in confusion I feel like I'm losing it all. Where do I go from here. With all this confusion now who's gonna break my fall. There's no one left to call. Lost in confusion I feel like I'm losing it all. Where do I go from here. Nothing is clear. Where do I go from here?. Where do I go. Tell me where do I go"
