I don't wanna let you go neither. To tell you the truth mami, i need ya. Anything to please ya- body of a diva,. She hotter than a fever,. Try to cool her down ice rocks on her finger. When i get up set or frustrated she sing to me. Gettin paid gotta cook and clean for me. Tryed to leave a few times, but she came back. Can't let you go, i'm not ashamed to say that. [chorus: x2]. No i just can't let you go, 'cause i been lovin' you too long. Take it back to how it was baby, you know i'm goin crazy. No i can't do this no more. 'cause i just cant let you go, i keep on comin back for more. I told myself now its over, but i still love ya. I can't let you go. by:Jéssica Ortega"

i am australian,"I came from the dream-time, from the dusty red soil plains. I am the ancient heart, the keeper of the flame. I stood upon the rocky shore, I watched the tall ships come. For forty thousand years I've been the first Australian. We are one, but we are many. And from all the lands on earth we come. We share a dream and sing with one voice. I am, you are, we are Australian. I came upon the prison ship, bowed down by iron chains. I cleared the land, endured the lash and waited for the rains. I'm a settler, I'm a farmer's wife on a dry and barren run. A convict then a free man, I became Australian. We are one, but we are many. And from all the lands on earth we come. We share a dream and sing with one voice. I am, you are, we are Australian. I'm the daughter of a digger who sought the mother lode. The girl became a woman on the long and dusty road. I'm a child of the depression, I saw the good times come. I'm a bushy, I'm a battler, I am Australian. We are one, but we are many. And from all the lands on earth we come. We share a dream and sing with one voice. I am, you are, we are Australian. I'm a teller of stories, I'm a singer of songs. I am Albert Namatjira, I paint the ghostly gums. I am Clancy on his horse, I'm Ned Kelly on the run. I'm the one who waltzed Matilda, I am Australian. We are one, but we are many. And from all the lands on earth we come. We share a dream and sing with one voice. I am, you are, we are Australian. There are no words of comfort. that can hope to ease the pain. Of losing homes and loved ones the memories will remain. Within the silent tears you? ll find the strength to carry on. You? re not alone, we are with you. We are Australian!. We are one, but we are many. And from all the lands on earth we come. We share a dream and sing with one voice. I am, you are, we are Australian. There are so many heroes whose stories must be told. They fought the raging fires of hell. and saved so many souls. From the ashes of despair our towns will rise again!. We mourn your loss, we will rebuild. We are Australian!. We are one, but we are many. And from all the lands on earth we come. We share a dream and sing with one voice. I am, you are, we are Australian. I'm the hot wind from the desert. I'm the black soil of the plains. I'm the mountains and the valleys. I'm the drought and flooding rains. I am the rock, I am the sky, the rivers when they run. The spirit of this great land, I am Australian. We are one, but we are many. And from all the lands on earth we come. We share a dream and sing with one voice. I am, you are, we are Australian. I am, you are, we are Australian!. We are one? ... We are many? ... We are Australian!"
