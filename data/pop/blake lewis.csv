sad song,"Wake me up on the bat (3X). Wake me up on the battle. Waking up on the battlefield. Feels like a gun fire in our eyes. Can’t change the way we feel. It hurts us every time. Torn hearts that will never heal. There’s nothing left in here. And we fight. While we cry. It’s surrender, do or die. And we don’t know why. CHORUS. This is a sad song. For the long gone. With melodies that heal me. This is a sad song. Just sing with me tonight. Just sing with me. Woah oh, woah oh oh (2X). This bed is a battlefield. All along with your memories in my heart. Lie awake and my fate is sealed. You haunt me in the dark. Love you, the death of me. One touch you could make me bleed. Now we fight. While we cry. It’s surrender, do or die. And we don’t know why. CHORUS. This is a sad song. For the long gone. With melodies that heal me. This is a sad song. Just sing with me tonight. Just sing with me. Woah oh, woah oh oh (2X). This is a sad song. Wounded and walked on. With words that make your heart ache. This is a sad song. This is a goodbye. CHORUS. This is a sad song. For the long gone. With melodies that heal me. This is a sad song. Just sing with me tonight. Just sing with me. Woah oh, woah oh oh…. Will you march with me?. Will you march with me?. Will you march with me?. Who will march with me?. This is a sad song…"
