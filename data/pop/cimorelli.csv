He'll burn me down. With our hearts on fire we lit up. The night left our fears behind. Running for our lives like we'd never die. And it felt like magic but I knew I couldn't have it. We were just so close it's tragic. We could feel the burn of our hearts on fire. Our hearts on fire. I can't even breathe you're like a shooting star. I know you could burn out but I can't see that far. Get a little closer and the sparks shine in your eyes. And I don't stand a chance. And I know it's a long way down but I'm holding on. You flash that smile my hearts giving out. There's no way I could forget you now. Forget you now. With our hearts on fire we lit up the night. Left our fears behind.

I feel because I'm alive. Sometimes it's not easy to. And I don't want to feel. But if I close off and just be numb. What would I become?. Shutting down. Getting by. Even though. There's pain inside. Is how I know. I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive. I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive. I feel because I'm alive. And if I break. Wanna feel every single thing. I'm alive.

coming home,"[Chorus]. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming home. Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes. I'm coming home, I'm coming home. Tell the world that I'm coming. Back where I belong. Teah I never felt so strong. (I'm back baby). I feel like there's nothing that I can't try. and if you with me put your hands high. (put your hands high). If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you. And you, the dreams are for you. I hear ""The Tears of a Clown"". I hate that song. I feel like they talking to me when it comes on. Another day another dawn. Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math I'm gone. What am I s'posed to do when the club lights come on. It's easy to be Puff, it's harder to be Sean. What if the twins ask why I ain't marry their mom. (why, damn!). How do I respond?. What if my son stares with a face like my own. And says he wants to be like me when he's grown. Damn!. But I ain't finished growing. Another night the inevitible prolongs. Another day another dawn. Just tell Keisha and Taresha I'll be better in the morn'. Another lie that I carry on. I need to get back to the place I belong. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. ""A house is Not a Home"", I hate this song. Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone. And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it. And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it. But you felt it and still feel it. And money can't make up for it or conceal it. But you deal with it and you keep ballin'. Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'. Baby, we've been living in sin. 'Cause we've been really in love. But we've been living as friends. So you've been a guest in your own home. It's time to make your house your home. Pick up your phone, come on. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. ""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song. Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong. I thought I told y'all that we won't stop. We back cruising through Harlem, Viso blocks. It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy. Drove me away then embraced me. Forgave me for all of my shortcomings. Welcome to my homecoming. Yeah it's been a long time coming. Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles. Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs. Made it back, lost my dog. (I miss you BIG). And here I stand, a better man!. (a better man). Thank you Lord. (Thank you Lord). [Chorus]"

cruise,"Baby you a song. You make me wanna roll. My windows down and cruise. Hey baby!. When I first saw him, first day summer. He's poppin' right out of the south georgia water. Thought, oh my my, he trough me out my head. Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said. Baby you a song. You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise.

So baby you a song. You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise. He was looking so southern and singin' marshall tucker. We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer. I hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said. Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck. Baby you a song. You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise. Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle. Every little farm town with you. In this brand new chevy with a lift kit. Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it.

Hey country boy, this country girl. Like everything about you. Don't change a thing, no way. You stay the same and I got you. Goodnight summer sun fall to his knees. And I looked at him and he looked at me. And he turned on those cassi lights. That drove all night, cause ir felt so right. Him and I, and it feels so right. Heeling mark, and grabbed my guitar. And strummed a couple chords. And sang from the heart. Boy you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'. Yeah I can't get you out of my head!. Baby you a song. You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise. Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle. Every little farm town with you. In this brand new chevy with a lift kit. Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it. Come on! So baby you a song. You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise"

everything you have,"I used to think that happiness. Was feeling like you finally won. I couldn't rest knowing someone else. Might be out there having more fun. More pressure, more time. Do everything right. Don't smile, don't care. Don't waste your Friday night. Look perfect, stand still. Blend in, don't lose the fight. Sometimes it's easy to get carried away. Listening to the things that people say. Feeling like nobody's got your back. But everything you need is everything you have. Ooh.... I used to think that beautiful. Was looking like a perfect 10. I couldn't see I was good enough. Couldn't get past everything they said. More pressure, more time. Do everything right. Don't smile, don't care. Don't waste your Friday night. Look perfect, stand still. Blend in, don't lose the fight. Sometimes it's easy to get carried away. Listening to the things that people say. Feeling like nobody's got your back. But everything you need is everything you have. Looking all around, can't you feel the pain?. Talking like they know but they don't know a thing. You can leave tonight and never look back.

good enough,"I don't know why he left. But he's been gone for seven months. There's a tension in the air that's not so fun. Mom's been losing weight, I can tell she's not okay. I wonder if it's my fault he went away. I feel like I'm drowning, I feel like I'm broken. I've been ripped down the middle, I am ripped down the middle. My house is a war zone, my life is a battle.

Is there any way, I'll ever be good enough?. Is there any way, I'll ever be good enough?. I don't know why he left, but I don't think he's coming back. Relationships don't come easy to me. I never learned how to love or how to stay when things get rough. How can you know something you're never seen?. I feel like a hurricane, my heart is breaking.

headlights,Flannels and ripped jeans. And friday nights. Now all I see. Is fields and fences. Remembering. Flickering lights. On a sunday. Just wanting to feel something. These memories won't let me be. So I just play them back. I see summer rain. And that Autumn change. It all came so fast. Smell of wood burning. Sparks jumpin' around. I thought by now. I'd have it all figured out. With our hoods up. And our hearts out. I was fearless. Before I got let down. I wonder if I could. Get back to that place now. I got two headlights. And a thousand miles to go. Two hundred feet of light. On this dark and windy road. Midnight stars haunt my sky. Burning scars fill my mind. I'm waiting on a wish to come true. Maybe I can find my way. Back to where I belong. Just following my headlights. Headlights. Maybe I don't have to see. Where I'm going. Just follow my headlights. I'm searching back roads. For wishes and dreams. Long gone. Ripped at the seams. Whispered a quiet prayer. In this heart of mine. Filled with questions. As big as the Tennessee sky. And like ghosts these memories. Just follow me around. Looking back I never thought that. I'd leave that town. Airplanes and shooting stars. Where my company all along. The moon stayed at the same. But those days are long gone. With our hoods up. And our hearts out. I was fearless. Before I got let down. I wonder if I could. Get back to that place now. I got two headlights. And a thousand miles to go.

He'll burn me down. With our hearts on fire we lit up. The night left our fears behind. Running for our lives like we'd never die. And it felt like magic but I knew I couldn't have it. We were just so close it's tragic. We could feel the burn of our hearts on fire. Our hearts on fire. I can't even breathe you're like a shooting star.

roar,"I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath. Scared to rock the boat and make a mess. So I sat quietly, agreed politely. I guess that I forgot I had a choice.

Like thunder gonna shake the ground. You held me down, but I got up. Get ready 'cause I've had enough. I see it all, I see it now. I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire.

rolling in the deep,"There's a fire starting in my heart. Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark. Finally I can see you crystal clear. Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare. See how I leave with every piece of you. Don't underestimate the things that I will do. There's a fire starting in my heart. Reaching a fever pitch. And it's bringing me out the dark. The scars of your love remind me of us. They keep me thinking that we almost had it all. The scars of your love they leave me breathless. I can't help feeling. We could've had it all. Rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand. And you played it. To the beat. Baby I have no story to be told. But I've heard one of you. And I'm gonna make your head burn. Think of me in the depths of your despair. Making a home down there. As mine sure won't be shared. The scars of your love remind me of us. They keep me thinking that we almost had it all. The scars of your love they leave me breathless. I can't help feeling. We could've had it all. Rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand. And you played it. To the beat. We could've had it all. Rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand. But you played it. With the beating. Throw your soul through every open door. Count your blessings to find what you look for. Turned my sorrow into treasured gold. You pay me back in kind. And reap just what you sow. We could've had it all. We could've had it all. It all, it all it all. We could've had it all. Rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand. And you played it. To the beat. We could've had it all. Rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand. But you played it. To the beat"

some nights,"Some nights, i wake up cashing in my bad luck; some nights, i call it a draw. Some nights, i wish that my lips could build a castle. Some nights, i wish they'd just fall off.

This is it, girls, this is war - what are we waiting for?. Why don't we break the rules already?. I was never one to believe the hype - save that for the black and white. I try twice as hard and i'm half as liked,. But here they come again to jack my style. And that's alright; i found a martyr in my bed tonight.

That is it, guys, that is all - five minutes in and i'm bored again. Ten years of this, i'm not sure if anybody understands. This is not one for the folks back home; i'm sorry to leave, mom, i had to go. Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?. My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she called ""love"". But when i look into my nephews eyes.... Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things they can come from.... Some terrible lies.. The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream i just had about you and me. I called you up, but we'd both agree it's for the best you don't listen.

sunsets and heartbreak,The streetlights were gold. You were standing by my car. I jumped and you caught me. I'm hanging on your every word. And I can barely breathe. And you're so tall when I'm next to you. I look up at you. And try to hide my smile. You walk me to my door. I've pictured this million times before. I'm sitting on these stars. Staring at the wall. But light's shinning. But I can't see at all. Just tryna connect things in my mind. Wish I could have this my way. But I know you can't stay. You stand there in my driveway. You're a red light on a highway. And I'm drowning. In the sound of your name. Between late nights and mistakes. I can't stand in this earthquake. I Look up at the sky. The lights starting to face. Here comes sunsets and heartbreak. I'm going down. I'm going down. I'm going down. Our story is sunsets and heartbreak. Sitting in my car today. It's like nothing even happened yesterday. But you were here right next to me. I swear I could replay it all day long. When I sang that song. Looked over at you. Saw your smile. And I was gone. This little town is magic. It's making me feel things. I never thought I would. My name's in your phone every night. You tell me about your sister and your family. Gave myself away now you know. I'm in love with your laugh. Cause I can't even hold it back. Wish we could just stay here. But I know it's not real. You stand there in my driveway. You're a red light on a highway. And I'm drowning. In the sound of your name. Between late nights and mistakes. I can't stand in this earthquake. I Look up at the sky. The lights starting to face. Here comes sunsets and heartbreak. I'm going down. I'm going down. I'm going down. Our story is sunsets and heartbreak. I don't wanna say goodbye. I don't wanna say goodbye. I don't wanna say goodbye. Maybe if I close my eyes. Maybe if I hold real tight.

take me home,"I let him back into my life at the worst time. And I shattered when we said goodbye. Since then, my head's been so filled with fear. I've been too afraid to try.

the last time,"It all started right here. Where we said good-bye. I didn't think that this would. Really be the last time. You said, ""hey is that the sweatshirt. That you wore when I met you? "". When I think about how hard. It'll be to ever forget you. Do you remember on the very first night. When you stopped the car. Got out and said, ""you can drive. "". And I asked. ""how many girls have you ever let. Drive your car? "". You said, ""you are the first one. "". [amy:]. Now when I hear the phone, I think it's you. Think of all the things you made me do. I just can't believe I cried in front of you. Your friend, he thinks you're crazy now. Everytime you say we're hanging out. All of that means nothing now. [lisa & background vocals by cimorelli:]. You know how bad I am at saying good-bye. You I tried to do this so many times. Would you believe me if I told you tonight. This is the last time!. ( [christina:] the last time).

I put my hood up and you told me. That I looked just like an eskimo. Who has a really lovely smile!. [dani:]. Now you're slowly driving me insane. Cause I know you only want the chase. And I can tell you really like. To play this game. Now you wrote my initials on your hand. But I wish that we could take it all back. Whatever we are won't last. ( [cimorelli:] won't last!).

[lauren:]. You got me staying up late. Freaking out, sleeping in. I say, ""I swear I'm done"". And delete your number again. You said, ""I'm dying"". But you act like you don't care. So I'll just pretend. This is the last time!. ( [christina:] the last time). ( [lisa:] the last time). This is the last time!. ( [christina:] the last time). ( [lisa:] the last time).

You got a hold on me. I danced across the parking lot. So nervous but I laughed it off. Now I can't stop looking. At my phone. Just wanna see your name. When I close my eyes all I see. Is me right there in his front seat. His headlights pouring down my street. I try to forget but I can't lie. His words keep me. Up at night. If it's four thirty and I can't sleep. You don't have to guess. What's keeping me up at night. What's keeping me up at night. Sitting on the tailgate,. Head on your shoulder. I love that you drove all the way out here. Just to get closer. Last night our phone call lasted for hours. I was in my bed whispering,. Trying not to wake up my sister. Outside my front door,. When you drop me off. Before I go in take a second. Just to breathe in this moment. Reality sets in. Maybe I don't like your shoes. And you might think sometimes I'm rude. (well that's true). But still you find a way. To never let me sleep. When I close my eyes all I see. Is me right there in his front seat. His headlights pouring down my street. I try to forget but I can't lie. His words keep me. Up at night. If it's four thirty and I can't sleep. You don't have to guess. What's keeping me up at night. What's keeping me up at night. I couldn't stop this if I tried. When all the streets whisper.

Wouldn't bow down. Gravity hurts. You made it so sweet. Till I woke up on. On the concrete. Falling from cloud 9. Crashing from the high. I'm letting go tonight. Yeah, I'm falling from cloud 9. I'm wide awake. Not losing any sleep. I picked up every piece. And landed on my feet. I'm wide awake. Need nothing to complete myself, no. I'm wide awake. Yeah, I am born again. Out of the lion's den. I don't have to pretend. And it's too late. The story's over now, the end. I wish I knew then. What I know now. Wouldn't dive in. Wouldn't bow down. Gravity hurts. You made it so sweet. Till I woke up on. On the concrete. Falling from cloud 9. It was out of the blue, I'm. Crashing from the high. I'm letting go tonight. Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm. I'm falling from cloud 9. I'm wide awake. Thunder rumbling. Castles crumbling (I'm wide awake). I am trying to hold on (I'm wide awake). God knows that I tried. Seeing the bright side (I'm wide awake). But I'm not blind anymore. I'm wide awake. I'm wide awake. Yeah, I'm falling from cloud 9. It was out of the blue, I'm. Crashing from the high. You know I'm letting go tonight. Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm. I'm falling from cloud 9. I'm wide awake. I'm wide awake. I'm wide awake. I'm wide awake. I'm wide awake"
wildest dreams,"He said ""let's get out of this town. Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"". I thought nothing can't help me now. Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down. He was sort of punk rock, I grew up on hip hop. You found me better than my favorite sweater. And I know that love is mean, and love hurts. And I still remember that day we met in december. Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress. Staring at the sunset, babe. Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again. Even if it's just in your, wildest dreams, ahh. Wildest dreams, ahh. He said no one else knows me like you. And I can't help but fall, theres nothing I can do. And his voice is a familiar sound. Nothing lasts forever, but this is getting good now. But he headed out on sunday. Said he'd come on monday. I stayed up waiting, anticipating and facing. But he was chasing paper. Caught up in the game it was the last I heard. Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress. Staring at the sunset, babe. Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again. Even if it's just in your, wildest dreams, ahh. Wildest dreams, ahh. See me in hindsight. Thinking about you all night. Burning it down. Someday when you leave me. I bet these memories follow you around. See me in hindsight. Thinking about you all night. Burning it down. Someday when you leave me. I bet these memories follow you around. (Follow you around). Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress. Staring at the sunset, babe. Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again. Even if it's just in your, wildest dreams, ahh. Wildest dreams, ahh. (I will love you til the end of time. Probably a million years. Promise you'll remember that your mine. Baby can you see throught the tears. That I love you more than ever before. Say you'll remember baby. Say you'll remember baby. I will love you til the end of time)"

worth the fight,I let their words in. I let them get the best of me. Lying on the bathroom floor thinking there was nothing left in me. And there's a pain that comes when I look up and see that I am alone. My own struggle I am drowning in. And you should see the nights that I have lived through. The scars the screams the fights I let myself lose. I am I perfect. I am a human. I lose direction. But still the one thing I can't deny. Screaming in my veins. Is that life is worth living. I've still got a purpose. When I can't see the reasons. There's still something inside of me saying. I can take the pain. Bring it on. Let it rain. It's only gonna make me better in the end. I'll take this broken heart. I'll pick it up every part. It's never too late to restart. And I might fall. But that won't change my mind. I choose to believe. It's worth the fight. It's worth the fight. I'm worth the fight. I won't let this take me down tonight. Cause I know this spark inside could turn into a fire. And I can make it through tonight. Even when it's killing me just to breathe. I know I can make it out of here. Make it out of here. I can take the pain. Bring it on. Let it rain. It's only gonna make me better in the end. I'll take this broken heart. I'll pick it up every part. It's never too late to restart. And I might fall. But that won't change my mind. I choose to believe. It's worth the fight. It's worth the fight. I'm worth the fight. I'll keep my head up. I'll keep my voice strong. When my heart's weak. And the night's long. Even when it feels like there is nothing left in me. I won't let it get the best of me. I'll light a candle. Bow my head and say a prayer. Take a walk. Breathe in the words and say. I'll be okay. I'll be okay. I can take the pain. Bring it on. Let it rain. It's only gonna make me better. I'll take this broken heart. I'll pick it up every part. It's never too late to restart. And I might fall. But that won't change my mind. I choose to believe. It's worth the fight. It's worth the fight. I'm worth the fight
wrong,"I wait before I call you. I don't text back right away. I try to look like I have got a life. I make sure I look perfect. I make sure that you see. I'm just trying to be something you like. I don't always want to smile. I don't always want to pout. I'd love someone to come figure me out. But I sit here by the sidelines. And they always turn me down. So I change myself and go another round. I'm just trying to be something that makes you happy. I'm just trying to be something you want. I just want to feel your eyes looking at me. I'm just tired of always being wrong. OOhh oohh. I rearrange my schedule. I make sure that I'm free. If I don't try, we'll never hang out. I'm sure there are people. Who would like to catch me. But I'm too busy chasing to turn around. I know I can't be perfect. But one day I'll be close. And that's when someone will love me the most. So I'll just keep on trying. I'll do the best I can. I can't compete just being who I am. I'm just trying to be something that makes you happy. I'm just trying to be something you want. I just want to feel your eyes looking at me. I'm just tired of always being wrong. OOhh oohh. I try so hard. I change so much. I put on a mask. I hide all of my feelings so well. But every time they fall for it, it's all just a lie. 'Cause I know that I'm not being myself. I'm just trying to be something that makes you happy. I'm just trying to be something you want. I just want to feel your eyes looking at me. I'm just tired of always being wrong. OOhh oohh. OOhh oohh. OOhh oohh"
