the winner takes it all,I don't wanna talk. About the things we've gone through. Though it's hurting me. Now it's history. I've played all my cards. And that's what you've done too. Nothing more to say. No more ace to play. The winner takes it all. The loser standing small. Beside the victory. That's a destiny. I was in your arms. Thinking I belonged there. I figured it made sense. Building me a fence. Building me a home. Thinking I'd be strong there. But I was a fool. Playing by the rules. The gods may throw a dice. Their minds as cold as ice. And someone way down here. Loses someone dear. The winner takes it all.. The loser has to fall. It's simple and it's plain.. Why should I complain.. But tell me does she kiss. Like I used to kiss you?. Does it feel the same. When she calls your name?. Somewhere deep inside. You must know I miss you. But what can I say. Rules must be obeyed. The judges will decide. The likes of me abide. Spectators of the show. Always staying low. The game is on again. A lover or a friend. A big thing or a small. The winner takes it all. I don't wanna talk. If it makes you feel sad. And I understand. You've come to shake my hand. I apologize. If it makes you feel bad. Seeing me so tense. No self-confidence. But you see. The winner takes it all. The winner takes it all.... So the winner.... Takes it all.... And the loser.... Has to fall.... Throw a dice.... Cold as ice.... Way down here.... Someone dear.... Takes it all.... Has to fall...

And we were caught in our sleep. Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe. You really had the power. I only saw it as dreams you would weave. Until the final hour. So in the morning your ship will be sailing. Now that your father and sister are gone. There is no reason for you to linger. You're grieving deeply but still moving on. You know the future is casting a shadow. No one else sees it but you know you're fate. Packing your bags, being slow and thorough. Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait. Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood. Now the last day is dawning. Some of us wanted but none of us could. Listen to words of warning. But on the darkest of nights. Nobody knew how to fight. And we were caught in our sleep. Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe. You really had the power. I only saw it as dreams you would weave. Until the final hour. I watched the ship leaving harbour at sunrise. Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain. She stood on deck, just a tiny figure. Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain. Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood. Now the last day is dawning. Some of us wanted but none of us could. Listen to words of warning. But on the darkest of nights. Nobody knew how to fight.

fernando,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?. I remember long ago. another starry night like this. In the firelight Fernando. You were humming to yourself. and softly strumming your guitar. I could hear the distant drums. And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar. They were closer now Fernando. Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally. I was so afraid Fernando. We were young and full of life. and none of us prepared to die. And I'm not ashamed to say. The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry. There was something in the air that night. The stars were bright, Fernando. They were shining there for you and me. For liberty, Fernando. Though we never thought that we could lose. There's no regret. If I had to do the same again. I would, my friend, Fernando. Now we're old and grey Fernando. And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand. Can you hear the drums Fernando?. Do you still recall the frightful night. we crossed the Rio Grande?. I can see it in your eyes. How proud you were. to fight for freedom in this land. There was something in the air that night. The stars were bright, Fernando. They were shining there for you and me. For liberty, Fernando. Though we never thought that we could lose. There's no regret. If I had to do the same again.

free as a bumble bee,"I'm down and I feel depressed. Sitting here just waiting. For next bus travelling. Downtown. It's a crying shame. Isn't it. The beautiful weather. If I could have my way. Well, I would not be working. On a day like this I know what I'd like to be. As free as a bumble bee. Take a sip from. Every flower. Free as a bumble bee. While away each lazy hour. What a good life.

from a twinkling star to a passing angel,"Twinkle, Twinkle little star. How I wonder what you are. Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky. Seems to me you shine your light. Down to me to say goodnight. Twinkle, Twinkle my old friend. Sleep is waiting round the bend. While you travel through the milky way. From a far. Twinkle, Twinkle, Twinkle little star.. Raindrops on a window pane. Stillness of a summer rain. Silently the haze drifts through the trees. Slowly dawn is breaking through. Yet a morning without you. Curtins rustling in the breeze. I'm still trapped within my dreams. Daylight makes it's way into my mind. Coming through. Yet another morning without you.. Finally when darkness falls. Casting shadows on the walls. In the twilight hour I am alone. Sitting near the fireplace. Dying embers warm my face. In this peaceful solitude. All the outside world subdued. Everything comes backs to me again. In the gloom. Like an angel passing through my room. Mmm, Mmm, Mmm- echoes of a voice I knew. Half awake in half in dreams. Seeing long forgotten scenes. So the present runs into the past. Now and then become entwined. Playing games within my mind. Like the embers as they die. Love was one prolonged goodbye. And it all comes back to me tonight. In the gloom. Like an angel passing through my room.. I close my eyes. And my twilight images go by. All too soon. Like an angel passing through my room"

hamlet iii,"When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground. When the air gets cold then I think of us. Of you and I. And it almost makes me cry. So sad and kind of bitter sweet. And the memories filled with tears. And I feel my heart will break. Guess it all was my mistake. Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees. The rain fell softly on your face. Oh I remember every little thing about that day. I remember every place. Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds. The rain fell softly on your face. The memories of our time together cannot be replaced."

i have a dream,I have a dream. A song to sing. To help me cope. With anything. If you see the wonder. Of a fairy tale. You can take the future. Even if you fail. I believe in angels. Something good in. Everything I see. I believe in angels. When I know the time. Is right for me. I'll cross the stream. I have a dream. I have a dream. A fantasy. To help me through. Reality. And my destination. Makes it worth the while. Pushing through the darkness. Still another mile. I believe in angels. Something good in. Everything I see. I believe in angels. When I know the time.

i let the music speak,"I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs. No poet has ever painted. Voices call out to me, straight to my heart. So strange yet we're so well acquainted. I let the music speak, with no restraints. I let my feelings take over. Carry my soul away into the world. Where beauty meets the darkness of the day. Where my mind is like an open window. Where the high and healing winds blow. From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me. I let them take me. (Let them wake me, let them now, let them take me). Let it be a joke. Let it be a smile. Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while. Let it be a tear. Let it be a sigh. Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry. Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn. Rustling down an old alley. And in the dead of night I find myself. A blind man in some ancient valley. I let the music speak, leading me gently. Urging me like a lover. Leading me all the way. Into a place. Where beauty will defeat the darkest day. Where I'm one with every grand illusion. No disturbance, no intrusion. Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me. I let them use me. (All illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion). Let it be a joke. Let it be a smile. Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while. Let it be a tear. Let it be a sigh. Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry. Let it be a tear. Let it be a sigh. Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry. Let it be the joy of each new sunrise. Or the moment when a day dies. I surrender without reservation. No explanations. No questions why. I take it to me and let it flow through me. Yes, I let the music speak. I let the music speak"
i saw it in the mirror,"I saw it in the mirror, I saw it in my face. That I'm no longer needed, anyone can take my place. I saw it in the mirror when I look into my eyes. 'Cause something sure is wrong when this boy cries. (This boy cries). I saw it in the mirror, my head is hanging low. And I ain't too familiar with the feelings that I show. I know you say you love me, but I'm looking through your lies. It doesn't really bother you if this boy cries. (This boy cries). I never thought I could cry for you. But honey I will miss you 'til the day I die. ('Til the day I die). I saw it in the mirror, I saw it in my face. That I'm no longer needed, anyone can take my place.

It sounds so nice, well-planned and wise. Never expecting surprises. I wonder, it's frightening. Leaving now, is that the right thing. I wonder, it scares me. But who the the hell am I if I don't even try. I'm not a coward. Oh no, I'll be strong. One chance in a lifetime. Yes I will take it, it can't go wrong. My friends and my family, this dull little town. Buses I've missed, boys that I've kissed. Everything old and familiar. I wonder, it's frightening. Leaving now, is that the right thing.

But now it isn't true. Now everything is new. And all I've learned has overturned. I beg of you. Don't go wasting your emotion. Lay all your love on me. It was like shooting a sitting duck. A little small talk, a smile and baby I was stuck. I still don't know what you've done with me. A grown-up woman should never fall so easily. I feel a kind of fear. When I don't have you near. Unsatisfied, I skip my pride. I beg you dear. Don't go wasting your emotion. Lay all your love on me. Don't go sharing your devotion. Lay all your love on me. I've had a few little love affairs. They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce. I used to think that was sensible. It makes the truth even more incomprehensible. 'Cause everything is new. And everything is you.

Seeing long forgotten scenes. So the present runs into the past. Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind. Like the embers as they die. Love was one prolonged good-bye. And it all comes back to me tonight. In the gloom. Like an angel passing through my room. I close my eyes. And my twilight images go by. All too soon. Like an angel passing through my room"

under attack,"Don't know how to take it, don't know where to go. My resistance running low. And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so. (You know that I'm nobody's fool). I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me. I don't have a strategy. It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be. Under attack, I'm being taken. About to crack, defences breaking. Won't somebody please have a heart. Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart. Under attack, I'm taking cover. He's on my track, my chasing lover. Thinking nothing can stop him now. Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how. This is getting crazy, I should tell him so. Really let my anger show. Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no. (I'm kind of certain that's the truth). Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well. Something like a magic spell. I hardly dare to think of what could happen. Where I'd be if I fell. Under attack, I'm being taken. About to crack, defences breaking. Won't somebody please have a heart. Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart. Under attack, I'm taking cover.

what about livingstone,"Went to buy me a paper at the local news-stand. And then I heard them laugh and say. Look, they're gonna go flying way up to the moon now. Hey, what's it good for anyway. So I said. Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may. What about Livingstone. What about all those men. Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way. Tell me, wasn't it worth the while. Travelling up the Nile. Putting themselves on test. Didn't that help the rest. Wasn't it worth it then. What about Livingstone. And all of those fellas at the local news-stand. Didn't know what to answer or what to say. So I told them about him, that he was just like. One of those spacemen in his way. And if you laugh at them. Then there's only a thing I can say. What about Livingstone. What about all those men. Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way. Tell me, wasn't it worth the while. Travelling up the Nile. Putting themselves on test. Didn't that help the rest. Wasn't it worth it then. What about Livingstone. (Didn't he do it, well didn't he). What about all those men. (Didn't he do it, well didn't he).

when all is said and done,"Here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the bill. Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill. Birds of passage, you and me. We fly instinctively. When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun. Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done. In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks. Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex. We're still striving for the sky. No taste for humble pie. Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun. Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done. It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor. How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more. Clear-headed and open-eyed. With nothing left untried. Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run. There's no hurry any more when all is said and done. Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run. There's no hurry any more when all is said and done"
when i kissed the teacher,"Everybody screamed when I kissed the teacher. And they must have thought they dreamed when I kissed the teacher. All my friends at school. They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool. Nearly petrified 'cos he was taken by surprise. When I kissed the teacher. Couldn't quite believe his eyes, when I kissed the teacher. My whole class went wild. As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled. I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher. One of these days. Gonna tell him I dream of him every night. One of these days. Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright. I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher. Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher. Leaning over me, he was trying to explain the laws of geometry. And I couldn't help it, I just had to kiss the teacher. One of these days. Gonna tell him I dream of him every night. One of these days. Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright. What a crazy day, when I kissed the teacher. All my sense had flown away when I kissed the teacher. My whole class went wild. As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled. I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher. (I wanna hug, hug, hug him). When I kissed the teacher. (I wanna hug, hug him). When I kissed the teacher. (I wanna hug, hug, hug him). When I kissed the teacher. (I wanna hug, hug him). When I kissed the teacher."
why did it have to be me,"When you were lonely, you needed a man. Someone to lean on, well I understand. It's only natural. But why did it have to be me. Nights can be empty, nights can be cold. So you were looking for someone to hold. That's only natural. But why did it have to be me. I was so lonesome, I was blue. I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I. Always thought you knew the reason why. I only wanted a little love affair. Now I can see you are beginning to care. But baby, believe me. It's better to forget me. Men are toys in the game that you play. When you get tired, you throw them away. That's only natural. But why did it have to be me. Falling in love with a woman like you. Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do. It's only natural. But why did it have to be me. I was so lonesome, I was blue. I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I. Always thought you knew the reason why. I only wanted a little love affair. Now I can see you are beginning to care. But baby, believe me."
you owe me one,Now there's a shadow falling over our faces. Doubt forever in our hearts. And in a while we'll stop to pick up the traces. We won't find the missing parts. Buy me a ticket I'll go to the Bahamas. I need a rest from our petty little dramas. Yes I really do. Aha. Look what you've done. I'm missing all the fun. Baby you owe me one. Aha. My turn to run. A chance to feel the sun. Baby you owe me one. I wasn't ready for this kind of intrusion. I was taken by surprise. Now both of us are in a state of confusion. Hesitation in our eyes. Something unwanted has entered our existence. I think it's better to view it from a distance. Yes I really do. Aha. Look what you've done. I'm missing all the fun. Baby you owe me one. Aha. My turn to run. A chance to feel the sun. Baby you owe me one. Aha. Look what you've done. I'm missing all the fun. Baby you owe me one. Aha. My turn to run. A chance to feel the sun. Baby you owe me one. Aha. Look what you've done. I'm missing all the fun. Baby you owe me one. Aha. My turn to run. A chance to feel the sun. Baby you owe me one. Aha. Look what you've done. I'm missing all the fun. Baby you owe me one. Aha. My turn to run. A chance to feel the sun.
