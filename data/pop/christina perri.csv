a thousand years,Heart beats fast. Colors and promises. How to be brave. How can I love. When I'm afraid to fall. But watching you stand alone. All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow.

I will be brave. I will not let anything take away. What's standing in front of me. Every breath. Every hour has come to this. One step closer. I have died every day waiting for you. Darling don't be afraid. I have loved you for a thousand years. I'll love you for a thousand more. And all along I believed I would find you. Time has brought your heart to me. I have loved you for a thousand years. I'll love you for a thousand more. One step closer. One step closer. I have died every day waiting for you. Darling don't be afraid I have loved you.

human,"I can hold my breath. I can bite my tongue. I can stay awake for days. If that's what you want. Be your number one. I can fake a smile. I can force a laugh. I can dance and play the part. If that's what you ask. Give you all I am. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. But I'm only human. And I bleed when I fall down. I'm only human. And I crash and I break down. Your words in my head, knives in my heart. You build me up and then I fall apart. 'Cause I'm only human. I can turn it on. Be a good machine. I can hold the weight of worlds. If that's what you need. Be your everything. I can do it. I can do it. I'll get through it. But I'm only human. And I bleed when I fall down. I'm only human. And I crash and I break down. Your words in my head, knives in my heart. You build me up and then I fall apart. 'Cause I'm only human. I'm only human. I'm only human. Just a little human. I can take so much.

all that matters,"When I thought that my whole world had ended. The colors had faded to grey. Just when I had given up on hoping. The feelings, they rush back again. There's bright light in the sky tonight. Guiding us safely to shore. Not afraid anymore. All that matters now. Is where we go from here. There's an easier way if we live for today. To find out all we are is all that matters. Is all that matters. Remember all you'd forgotten. The joy and the simplest of things. Refused to take life for granted. But choose to celebrate all that life brings. There's bright light in the sky tonight. Guiding us safely to shore. Not afraid anymore. All that matters now. Is where we go from here.

Somebody who won't change. I tried to be brave. Nothing's coming easy. And all at once. I feel a little queasy. Oh, but if you lost my remedy. Won't you please come and be with me. It's not like there's much better. Nobody's grass is as green as mine. I can't say that I'm satisfied. Three thousand miles from your kiss goodbye. I'm gonna lay back down. Hope the wind takes me around. I gotta find some courage in this town. And everybody's afraid. 'Cause chances come from change. And everybody's afraid. 'Cause chances come from break in. Chances are your breaking open. I'm gonna lay back down. Hope the wind takes me around. I gotta find some courage in this town. 'Cause nobody's going to save. Somebody who wont change.

butterfly,You're a pretty butterfly. You keep on passing by. You never land inside my hands. Your home is in the sky. And there's a lesson waiting to be learned. The firestarters always get the best. And the good guys never get the girl. No shooting stars cannot fix the world. And I've made the same mistakes. But I won't this time. No I won't this time. And you're a pretty butterfly. And I believed all your lies. Blinded by your sideways smile. And the kindness in your eyes. But there's a limit to your flight. I can offer you a better life. But you keep on flying from the light. And I've lost my faith in wrong and right. And I've made the same mistakes. But I won't this time. No I won't this time. I know exactly what you do. I made them sure I studied you. You won't pick me. I'm just a breeze underneath your wings. So I pray each night you change your mind. And maybe I'm worth the fight. But I am wrong every time. You only know how to fly. You only know how to fly. You only know how to fly
crazy,Everyone thinks I'm crazy. For thinking that when you see me. You're gonna love me. But I tell them it's easy. Like loving is supposed to be. Walk into the room love. I'll be waiting.

Or hang-up for you. Walk beside this lullaby love. For dreams of you and I love. Miles and miles and miles oh my love. I've come to find. Find you. How many ways. Can I explain my love for you. Without sounding like a little girl. Looking up to you. Taught me everything. Yes you taught. ...Taught me pain. And because of you I've changed. Everyone thinks I'm crazy.

i will follow you into the dark,"Love of mine someday you will die. But I'll be close behind. I'll follow you into the dark. No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white.

When your soul embarks. Then I'll follow you into the dark. In catholic school as vicious as Roman rule. I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black. And I held my tongue as she told me. ""Son fear is the heart of love"". So I never went back. If heaven and hell decide. That they both are satisfied. Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs. If there's no one beside you. When your soul embarks. Then I'll follow you into the dark. You and me have seen everything to see. From Bangcock to Calgary. And the soles of your shoes are all worn down. The time for sleep is now. There's nothing to cry about. Cause we'll hold each other soon. In the blackest of rooms. If heaven and hell decide. That they both are satisfied. Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs. If there's no one beside you. When your soul embarks. Then I'll follow you into the dark. Then I'll follow you into the dark. . by Gabriel Leite"

There's something bout' December. Let all your memories. Hold you close. No matter where you are. You're not alone. Because the ones you love. Are never far. If Christmas is in your heart
stay awake,"Stay awake, don't rest your head. Don't lie down upon your bed. While the moon drifts in the skies. Stay awake, don't close your eyes. Though the world is fast asleep. Though your pillow's soft and deep. You're not sleepy as you seem. Stay awake, don't nod and dream. Stay awake, don't nod and dream"
the blowers daughter,"And so it's. Just like you said it would be. Life goes easy on me. Most of the time. And so it's. The shorter story. No love, no glory. No hero in her sky. I can't take my eyes of you. I can't take my eyes of you. I can't take my eyes of you. I can't take my eyes of you. I can't take my eyes of you. I can't take my eyes.... And so it's. Just like you said it should be. We'll both forget the breeze. Most of the time. And so it's. The colder water. The blower's daughter. The pupil in denial. I can't take my eyes of you. I can't take my eyes of you. I can't take my eyes of you. I can't take my eyes of you. I can't take my eyes of you. I can't take my eyes.... Did i say that i loathe you?. Did i say that i want to. Leave it all behind?. I can't take my mind of you. I can't take my mind of you. I can't take my mind of you. I can't take my mind of you. I can't take my mind of you. I can't take my mind....

the lonely,"2am, where do I begin. Crying off my face again. The silent sound of loneliness. Wants to follow me to bed. I'm the ghost of a girl. That I want to be most. I'm the shell of a girl. That I used to know well. Dancing slowly in an empty room. Can the lonely take the place of you. I sing myself a quiet lullaby. Let you go and let the lonely in. To take my heart again. Too afraid, to go inside. For the pain of one more loveless night. For the loneliness will stay with me. And hold me till I fall asleep. I'm the ghost of a girl. That I want to be most. I'm the shell of a girl. That I used to know well. Dancing slowly in an empty room. Can the lonely take the place of you. I sing myself a quiet lullaby. Let you go and let the lonely in. To take my heart again. Broken pieces of. A barely breathing story. Where there once was love. Now there's only me. And the lonely.... Dancing slowly in an empty room. Can the lonely take the place of you. I sing myself a quiet lullaby. Let you go and let the lonely in. To take my heart again..."
the scientist (cover),"Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry. You don't know how lovely you are. I had to find you, tell you I need you. And tell you I set you apart. Tell me your secrets, And ask me your questions. Oh let's go back to the start. Running in circles, Coming in tails. Heads on a science apart. Nobody said it was easy. It's such a shame for us to part. Nobody said it was easy. No one ever said it would be this hard. Oh take me back to the start. I was just guessing at numbers and figures. Pulling the puzzles apart. Questions of science, science and progress. Don't speak as loud as my heart. And tell me you love me, Come back and haunt me. Oh when I rush to the start. Running in circles, Chasing tails. Coming back as we are. Nobody said it was easy. Oh it's such a shame for us to part. Nobody said it was easy. No one ever said it would be so hard. I'm going back to the start. Aah oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh (x4)"
the words,"All of the lights land on you. The rest of the world fades from view. And all of the love I see. Please please say you feel it too. And all of the noise I hear inside. Restless and loud unspoken and wild. And all that you need to say to make it all go away. It's that you feel the same way too. And I know the scariest part is letting go. Cause love is a ghost you can't control. I promise you the truth can't hurt us now. So let the words slip out of your mouth. And all of the steps that land me to you. And all of the hell I had to walk through. But I wouldn't trade a day for the chance to say. My love I'm in love with you. And I know the scariest part is letting go. Cause love is a ghost you can't control. I promise you the truth can't hurt us now. So let the words slip out of your mouth. I know that we're both afraid. We both made the same mistakes. An open heart is an open wound to you. And in the wind of a heavy choice. Love has a quiet voice. Still your mind, now I'm yours to choose. And I know the scariest part is letting go. Let my love be the light that guides you home. And I know the scariest part is letting go. Cause love is a ghost you can't control. I promise you the truth can't hurt us now. So let the words slip out of your mouth"
