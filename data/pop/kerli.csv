And I walk barefoot on a field of swords. You have mastered the art of cruelty. And I curse this hell. And I hate your guts. And I swear I'll dance with the devil never again. But we'll be making love like savages. I'll lick the poison from right off your kiss. Fall on rosy thorns for a taste of lethal bliss. Oh we'll be making love like savages. Savages. Savages. Savages.

And the dreams that you dare to dream. Really do come true. Someday I'll wish upon a star. And wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Where troubles melt like lemon drops. Away above the chimney tops. That's where you'll find me. Somewhere over the rainbow. Bluebirds fly. Birds fly over the rainbow. Why then, oh, why can't I?. Somewhere over the rainbow. Skys are blue. And the dreams that you dare to dream. Really do come true"
song for liisu,Hush now little sister. I am here with you. Liisu don't you worry. We will make it trough. Take your mask off. Leave your worries. Cause no one's here you see. Let my embrace be your pillow. It's just you and me. Tonight. I know it didn't go your way. Sleep tight. And wake up for a brand new day. I'll be by your side. So sleep tight. Don't cry little sister. I know what you're worth. Life is full of heartache. And everybody hurts. You can have faith. I'm your shelter. Lay your head to rest. Tonight. I know it didnt go your way. Sleep tight. And wake up for a brand new day. I'll be by your side. So sleep tight

This is about to get hazy. Feels like time is passing me by. While I am standing still. Oh, what a ride. I wanna make you mine. Spending my time in the waiting line. Oh, what a ride. My navegation guide. And for every green light there's a warning sign. Like a speed limit. Like a bump on the road. Like a five o'clock traffic on the highway. Like a speed limit.

whispers (with phutureprimitive),"Changes in winds they're leaving me high and dry. Out in the open I got no place to hide. Breaking the silence, the traces of truth begin to show. Tuning my ears to the sound that I can't deny. Cracks in the stillness, motion in standing by. I make out the voices and know it's time that I let go. Cause they're calling my name. Cause they're calling my name. And I'll follow the whispers. Coming from afar, screaming I can't stay. And I'll trust the shivers. Running down my heart, I can't look away. And everything that I've known is failing me. Begging to escape. And I'll follow the whispers. Coming from afar, screaming I can't stay"

scar tissue,"Turn my back, to the door. Feel so much better now. Don't even try anymore. Nothing left to lose. There's a voice that's in the air. Saying don't look back nowhere. There's a voice that's always there. And I'll never be, quite the same as I was before this. Part of you still remains, though it's out of focus. You're just somewhere that I've been. And I won't go back again. You're just somewhere that I've been. Breathing in, breathing out. Ain't that what it's all about?. Living life crazy loud. Like a girl's supposed to. No more words, in my mouth. Nothing left to figure out. I don't think I'll ever undo. The scar tissue. That's the way I feel tonight. I can't just press delete. Expect the world to make it right. I know that no can do. Got to let the pain just hurt. Try to live and let it burn. Follow, watch the world keep turning. Yeah, and I'll never be like I was the day I met you. To naive, yes, I was. That's why I let you in. Wear your memory like a stain. Can't erase or numb my pain. Here to stay with me forever. Breathing in, breathing out. Ain't that what it's all about?. Live a life crazy loud. Like a girl's supposed to. No more words, in my mouth. Nothing left to figure out. I don't think I'll ever undo. The scar tissue. One of these days I'll wake up from this. Bad dream I'm dreaming. One of these days I'll pray that I'll be over, over, over you. One of these days I'll realize that I'm so tired of feeling confused. But for now, there's a reason that you're still here in my heart. Breathing in, breathing out. Ain't that what it's all about?. Live a life crazy loud. Like a girl's supposed to. No more words, in my mouth. Nothing left to figure out. I don't think I'll ever undo. The scar tissue. Breathing in, breathing out. Ain't that what it's all about?. Live a life crazy loud. Like a girl's supposed to. No more words, in my mouth. Nothing left for me to doubt. I don't think I'll ever undo. The scar tissue"

Away above the chimney tops. That's where you'll find me. Somewhere over the rainbow. Bluebirds fly. Birds fly over the rainbow. Why then, oh, why can't I?. Somewhere over the rainbow. Skys are blue. And the dreams that you dare to dream. Really do come true"

And too much is never enough of you. And too much is never enough of you. Feel you dripping from my pours. But I keep wanting more. Until my skin is bruised. Too much, too much. Is never enough of you. Is never enough of you. Longing for your touch in between my sheets. I just wanna catch you falling into me. We're melting together until you make me cry. You can give me all you have but I won't be satisfied. 'Cause too much is never enough of you. And too much is never enough of you. Feel you dripping from my pours. But I keep wanting more. Until my skin is bruised. It's never enough of you. If I had a gun, I'd shoot you with love. So you could never leave. I'd use my arms to tie you up. So you'd always be with me. 'Cause I can't sleep, I can't sleep without you here. Without you here. And too much is never enough of you. And too much is never enough of you. Feel you dripping from my pours. But I keep wanting more. Until my skin is bruised. Too much, too much. Is never enough of you. Is never enough of you"
tricked by love,Don't wait the greatest. I don't wanna feel this. I'm better without this. Without it in my head. Without it in my head. I have been aching. Hurting and breaking. Crying and shaking. It's better in the end. So better in the end. I'm not an emotional. I don't want to be tricked by love again. I'm so bad at faking. I cannot do this. Don't know how to play with. Whatever's in my hands. Whatever's in my hands. I'm not an emotional. I don't want to be tricked by love again. I can't be devotional. I don't want to be tricked by love again. I have nothing left to give. It's your only time to leave. And you're better without me. Don't say hey. Just go away. I'm not an emotional. I don't want to be tricked by love again. I can't be devotional. I don't want to be tricked by love again
"up, up, up",Congratulations. False expectations. Wrong destination. And realization. That is. Manifestation. Fake sensation. Just imitation. Endless frustration.

what u c ain't what u get,I know you can't see this clearly. Now that you're moving closer. What you should do is fear me. There are things that you don't know. What you see ain't what you get. You're better off without me. I will only make you cry. I'm too fucked up inside. We can't be together. I will only make you cry. I'm stuck inside this life. Always and forever. Maybe it's wrong to hurt you. Like you don't mean a thing at all. 'Cause when I dream I'm with you. But I'm trapped inside my walls. What you see ain't what you get. You're better off without me.

when nobody loves you,"Silence is golden. You will see. You will see. Your diamond shield is broken. You are free. You are free. Burn it down to the ground. Destroy, create no sound. No elements all around. I shall rise again. If no one can hurt you. Then nobody loves you. If no one can break you. Then nobody loves you. If no one can change you. And no one can save you. If nobody loves you. I do. Honey cuts like razor blades. Sets you free. Sets you free. The only constant. Things have change. You will see. You will see. Burn it down to the ground. Destroy, create no sound. No elements all around. I shall rise again. If no one can hurt you. Then nobody loves you. If no one can break you. Then nobody loves you. If no one can change you.

when you cry,"When we met it was almost summer. And at night we heard crashed oceans all the time. And the rain made a crash like thunder. I want to sleep but you brought me back to life.

whispers (with phutureprimitive),"Changes in winds they're leaving me high and dry. Out in the open I got no place to hide. Breaking the silence, the traces of truth begin to show. Tuning my ears to the sound that I can't deny. Cracks in the stillness, motion in standing by. I make out the voices and know it's time that I let go. Cause they're calling my name. Cause they're calling my name. And I'll follow the whispers. Coming from afar, screaming I can't stay. And I'll trust the shivers. Running down my heart, I can't look away. And everything that I've known is failing me. Begging to escape. And I'll follow the whispers. Coming from afar, screaming I can't stay"
worlds apart (feat. seven lions),"I keep reaching. But you're not reaching back. You're not reaching back. Trying to get in, find you through the cracks. Find you through the cracks. Guess I'm trying to say (guess I'm trying to say). It hurts to feel this far (it hurts to feel this far). Like million miles away. When next to me, next to me you are. And if you are sitting right here. Then why are we worlds apart?. Why are we worlds apart?. If you're so near. Then why do you feel this far?. Why are we worlds apart?. Oh. We're not that different, you know. I play amongst the stars and then fall so low. I trying to make sense as I go. 'Cause nothing. 'Cause nothing. 'Cause nothing is ever just so. Why are we worlds apart?. Why are we worlds apart?. Why are we worlds apart?. Why are we?. Why are we worlds apart?. Why are we worlds apart?. Guess I'm trying to say (guess I'm trying to say). It hurts to feel this far (it hurts to feel this far). Like million miles away. When next to me, next to me you are. And if you are sitting right here. Then why are we worlds apart?.

zero gravity,Feels like coming home. After traveling a million miles. I am not alone. Searching for starlight in the darkest skies. A complex surface. Laid out right before our eyes. Everything makes sense. Now that you are by my side. I'm as light as I can be. You've got me feeling weightless. Take me on an odyssey. You've got me feeling weightless. You make me float free. My love for you it's endless. No ties are binding me. Now I'm in zero gravity. Now I'm in zero gravity. Now I'm in zero gravity. All the pain in me. No more needs to be expressed. Feels like I can breath. You lift a burden off my chest. Traces of sadness. No more chain me to the ground. I am limitless. Ever since you came around. I'm as light as I can be. You've got me feeling weightless. Take me on an odyssey. You've got me feeling weightless. You make me float free. My love for you it's endless. No ties are binding me. Now I'm in zero gravity. Now I'm in zero gravity. Now I'm in zero gravity. Now I'm in zero gravity. Now I'm in zero gravity. I'm as light as I can be. You've got me feeling weightless. Take me on an odyssey. You've got me feeling weightless
