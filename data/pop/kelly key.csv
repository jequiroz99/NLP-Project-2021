let it glow,"You search for the stars under a grey sky. You are living your night life in the shadows. You don't have to feel down, fly up of the ground. Hands be making the song, up and high. You're alive. All that you are looking for it's on the dance floor. When you feel the lights on. Let it glow, let it glow, let it glow. To shine your lights. Let it glow, let it glow, let it glow. Until the night. Let it glow. Let it glow. Let it glow. Glow. You search for the stars under a grey sky. You are living your night life in the shadows. You don't have to feel down, fly up of the ground. Hands be making the song, up and high. You're alive. All that you are looking for it's on the dance floor. When you feel the lights on. Let it glow, let it glow, let it glow. To shine your lights. Let it glow, let it glow, let it glow. Until the night. Let it glow, let it glow, let it glow. To shine your lights. Let it glow, let it glow, let it glow. Until the night. Night, night, night, night. Let it glow. Let it glow. Let it glow!"
