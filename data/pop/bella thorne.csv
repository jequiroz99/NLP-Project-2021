Same guy called, halloween party. Waited all night for him to show. This time his car wouldn't go. Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late. Trudge on home to celebrate. In a quiet way, unwind. Doing Christmas right this time. A&P has provided me. with the world's smallest turkey. already in the oven, nice and hot. Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?. So on with the boots, back out in the snow. To the only all-night grocery. When what to my wondering eyes should appear. In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!. ""I'm spending this one alone, "" he said. ""Need a break; this year's been crazy. "". I said, ""Me too, but why are you?. You mean you forgot cranberries too? "". Then suddenly we laughed and laughed. Caught on to what was happening. That Christmas magic's brought this tale. To a very happy ending! "". Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. Couldn't miss this one this year!. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!.
