21st century christmas,"The satellite's tracking Santa. We'll text our Christmas list. And leave our mobile numbers. To help out old Saint Nick. Sometimes we stop and wonder. Has that old bubble burst?. Or will this Christmas morning. Be like the first?. But tonight we'll still thank Santa Claus. And raise a glass to friends of ours. Peace on earth, goodwill to all. The future is the past. Let's have a slow light, snowball fight. Silent night, dynamite. 21st century Christmas. Magic morn, tree adorned. All at home, safe from harm. 21st century Christmas. We'll microwave some popcorn. And put on a Dvd. Thanks Uncle Jimmy Saville. For fixing you and me. These days we watch and wonder. Has Christmas lost it's touch?. And will our chocolate money. Be worth that much?"

7 summers,So just how long did it take you. To know that she was the one?. You've known her since the Autumn. And 7 Summer's seemed to pass you by. Do you remember the Isle of Wight?. Sand in your hair and the chill of the night. Now I'm not trying to tell you. What you should do with your life. You know you have my blessing. But 7 Summer's seemed to pass you by. Do you remember the Isle of Wight?. Sand in your hair and the chill of the night. Do you remember when we said goodbye?. Hand on my lips when you started to cry

afraid to go home,"Transcribed by Kevin Hung. Hearing tunes in other rooms. They stay, they stay like morning rays. Summer in sound tumbling down. The sun around my face. Leaves are green like tambourines. A walk, a walk in morning dew. Soul in the breeze. Places like theses. The times I shared with you. . Can we slow it down, slow it down. I'm afraid to go home. I'm afraid to go home. Can we slow it down, slow it down. Scared of being alone. Scared to answer the phone. I'm afraid to go home. . Ocean view is drowned in blue. The waves, the waves against the shore. Say I don't care but knowing he's there. I'll pour a couple more. . Can we slow it down, slow it down. I'm afraid to go home. I'm afraid to go home. Can we slow it down, slow it down. I'm afraid to go home. I'm afraid to go home."

Got himself a mobile. Got a house, one wrinkle. Couldn't get a signal. Pretty fast put a mast. On the neighbouring flats. A little girl called jill. Will become very ill. But that is years away. So who gives a hey?. 5 star review - who?. Bought a new lp. Had to agree. With the critic - really dug my lyric. Tolerate all the people who hate. When they walk all over you.

another cup of coffee,And she pours herself another cup of coffee. As she contemplates the stain across the wall. And it's in between the cleaning and the washing. That's when looking back's the hardest part of all. And she always did her best to try and please him. While he always did his best to make her cry. And she got down on her knees to stop him leaving. But he always knew one day he'd say goodbye. Where are your friends?. Where are your children?. Is this your house?. Is this your home?. Does nothing ever last forever?. Does everybody sleep alone?. And he tears the business tags from his old suitcase. As he packs away the pieces of his life. They all love him but they always try to change him. That's what happens when a girl becomes a wife.

Where are your friends?. Where are your children?. Is this your house?. Is this your home?. Does nothing ever last forever?. Does everybody sleep alone?. Don't look back. Don't give up.

are we gonna be alright?,Is there a better way than what we know of?. Anger swelling through the dead of night time too. Do we know better ways than what we're showing?. Laughter breaking through the shadow's hour. Are we gonna be alright?. Are we gonna be alright?. Some are never gonna get as close. As we have learnt to. And even if they might. We'd end up alright. Summer's never gonna be the same again. You never felt it once - the breath of heaven. Swept away the heroes from my mind. And still you talk of him as being greater. But no one's ever gonna reach us now

constantly,All day I'm walking in a dream. I think about you constantly. Just like an overflowing stream. Your memory haunts me constantly. Shadows fall and I try to drive you from my mind. So you're no longer near to me. But my heart sees you there with me. Every sunset you share with me. The rain that patters through the trees. Reminds me of you constantly. Your name is whispered by the breeze. And lovebirds bring your song to me. Just as sure as the stars keep burning in the sky. Your love will stay a flame in me. A flame that burns so bright. Not only through the night but constantly. The stars keep burning in the sky. Your love will stay a flame in me. A flame that burns so bright. Not only through the night but constantly.

haunted jukebox,Ghosts. Of an ancient song. Seem to hide in many places. Bringing back so many faces. And I. Know that it's been too long. But the spirits in the air. It's like the tunes are everywhere. I wanna go. I can't escape. I'm sure you know. They leave me haunted. I was just 15. In November '82. When I would meet you after school. And there was bonfires on Halloween. Frosty little windows. All the songs we used to listen to each time. Hands in gloves and yours in mine. Going round and round my mind. They leave me haunted. One night in Allentown. When you called me on the phone. And told me you were coming over. Fine 45s you found. Now every time I hear them. Knowing you're not near and won't be soon. It goes much further in our tune. When every record in the room. They leave me haunted. Haunted. Haunted. Haunted. She said. Sometimes it makes me wanna die. Sometimes it makes me scream and shout. And when the record's over. Just tell me what it's all about. Sometimes it makes me wanna die. Sometimes it makes me scream and shout. And when the record's over. Just tell me what it's all about. Haunted. Haunted. Haunted. Haunted. Haunted. Haunted. Haunted. Haunted. Haunted

over the border,"When I was 10 I wanted to explore the World. There were these older kids at school who'd gone all the way to. Somerset. Just to see Peter Gabriel's house, Peter Gabriel from Genesis. They way they'd dressed,. the way their hair fell over their coat collars. It all happened because of music, I wanted to know why. I couldn't go to Somerset on my own, so I used. Top of the pops as my World Atlas. In 1974, I bought my first single, from Woollies in Redhill. I started to memorise the charts, to memorise the leagues. Tuesday lunchtime at 12:45, Saturday afternoon at five o'clock. I didn't go to church, I didn't need to. Green and yellow harvests, pink pies,. silver bells and the strange and. Important sound of the synthesiser.. Over the border, I'm growing older,. heaven only knows what's on it's way. Every single day, love is here to stay. Over the border, I'm growing older,. heaven only knows what's on it's way. Every single day, love is here to stay. Kevin drove us to parties in his Morris Minor. And there were boys, and there was booze, and. mock Tudor semis. And first kisses, and terrible chat up lines. But in the end, the conversation always turned to music. I was in love, and I knew he loved me. because he made me a tape. I played it in my bedroom, I lived in my bedroom, all of us did. Reading Smash Hits and Record Mirror,. Paul Morley and the Nme,. Dave Mcculloch and Sounds, Modern Eon and Modern English. Mute, Why, Zoo, Factory. Cutting them up, sucking them in,. managing the story on our own.

Every single day, love is here to stay. I had my mocks a month later. But I just wanted to listen to Dexys,. New Order, anything on postcard. A few weeks and I'd be free. A few weeks and music wouldn't have to be so private,. it would be there for. Me. It would be there for me, and when I was married, and when. I had kids. Would Marc Bolan still be so important.

slow down at the castle,Slow down at the castle. Things to straighten in her head. And she knows it's not a castle. But that's what they've always said. Shaded by the tower. As she clambers to her seat. With the ash of last night's party. Clinging grimly to her feet. Not for the first time. She's made her bed. Now she leaves that all behind. And turns her mind to playful things instead. Days spent making stories. For the faces that pass by. From the lonely tea shop owner. To the misbehaving wife. Now they're growing ever wilder. As the people start to go. Now she dreams that there's assassins. Hiding in the woods below. Not for the first time. She's made her bed. Now she leaves that all behind. And turns her mind to playful things instead. And she knows this must end. As the long shadows start to blend. She must be on her way

sometimes in winter,"[lyrics as transcribed by Juha Heikkinen]. [Sometimes in Winter:]. When I come home in the evening. Cry at the silence waiting for me, and. He bring me a warm cup with coffee. Instead of the love you know that I need. Wait, wait.. Sometimes in winter, love can go astray.. Lonely, don't you get lonely, don't you get lonely for me.. He cradled my head as he held me. I swore I could feel the earth turning round. But love seemed to go with the season. Now touching you feels like rain coming down. Sometimes in winter, love can go astray.. Lonely, don't you get lonely, don't you get lonely for me.. Little girl, she stands alone. This is search until we find, gee. Now we're on the road to hell.... Sometimes in winter, love can go astray.. Lonely, don't you get lonely, don't you get lonely for me.. For me. For me. For me.. [Winter Melody:]. Deepest winter will set in.."

Time to stop, think it over. My perfect city, see it turning to gold. Had to stop, think it over. Could he be a lover. I need a little more time. Could he be a friend. Just a week or so. Could you find another. Mmm, I can't play that game. I don't know if i'm coming or going. Could he be a lover. I've travelled all this way. Could he be a friend. Well, I want more. Could you find another. There's a ship in the ocean. Another day, feel like it could float away. Feel like it float away"

Questions always questions. I'll just speak in slow motion. About obsessions with boys on the floor. Take that smile off your face. Wipe that tear from your eye. Don't say you're sorry for me. Now look at me like a stormtrooper in drag. And i'll let you feel exactly like I do. It's so disgusting I'm so tired of rhythm. And needles in arms. I don't want your point of view. Nothing to do. Nothing to do steal. And there's nothing to say. Love it. Love it. I need to."
