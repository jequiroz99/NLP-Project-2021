I've just let these little things. Slip out of my mouth. 'Cause it's you. Oh it's you. It's you. They add up to. And I'm in love with you. And all these little things. I won't let these little things. Slip out of my mouth. But if it's true. It's you. It's you. They add up to. I'm in love with you. And all your little things"

Because I'm missing half of me. And being here without you. It's like I'm waking up to. Only half a blue sky. Kinda there but not quite. I'm walking round with just one shoe. I'm a half a heart without you. I'm half the man, at best. With half an arrow in my chest. I miss everything we do. I'm a half a heart without you. Forget all we said that night. No it doesn't even matter. Cause we both got split in two. If you could spare an hour or so. We'll go for the lunch down by the river. We could really talk it through. And being here without you.

no control,"Stained coffee cup. Just that fingerprinted lipstick's not enough. Sleep, where you lay. Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case. Waking up. Beside you I'm a loaded gun. I can't contain this anymore. I'm all yours, I've got no control. Powerless. And I don't care it's obvious. I just can't get enough of you. The battle's down my eyes are closed. No control (control). Taste, on my tongue. I don't want to wash away the night before. And the heat, where you laid. I could stay right here and burn in it all day. Waking up. Beside you I'm a loaded gun. I can't contain this anymore. I'm all yours, I've got no control. Powerless. And I don't care it's obvious. I just can't get enough of you. The battle's down my eyes are closed. No control. Lost my senses, I'm defenceless. Her perfume's holding me ransom. Sweet and sour, I devour. Lying here I count the hours. Waking up. Beside you I'm a loaded gun. I can't contain this anymore. I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control. No control. Powerless. And I don't care it's obvious. I just can't get enough of you. The battle's down my eyes are closed.

over again,"Said I'd never leave her. Cause our hands fit like my T-shirt. Tongue tied over three words, cursed. Running over thoughts that made my feet hurt. Body's intertwined with her lips. Now she's feeling so low since she went solo. Hole in the middle of my heart like a polo. And it's no joke to me. So can we do it all over again. If you're pretending from the start like this. With a tight grip, then my kiss. Can mend your broken heart. I might miss everything you said to me. And I can lend you broken parts. That might fit like this. And I will give you all my heart. So we can start it all over again. Can we take the same road. Two days in the same clothes. And I know just what she'll say if I make all this pain go. Can we stop this for a minute. You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it. Tell me with your mind, body and spirit. I can make your tears fall down. Like the showers that are British. Whether we're together or apart. We can both remove the masks. And admit we regret it from the start. If you're pretending from the start like this. With a tight grip, then my kiss. Can mend your broken heart. I might miss everything you said to me. And I can lend you broken parts. That might fit like this. And I will give you all my heart. So we can start it all over again. You'll never know how to make it on your own. And you'll never show weakness for letting go. I guess you're still hurt if this is over. But do you really want to be alone?. If you're pretending from the start like this. With a tight grip, then my kiss. Can mend your broken heart. I might miss everything you said to me. And I can lend you broken parts. That might fit like this. And I will give you all my heart. So we can start it all over again. If you're pretending from the start like this. With a tight grip, then my kiss.

you are so beautiful,"You are so beautiful to me. You are so beautiful to me. Can't you see? oh oh oh. You're everything I've hoped for. And you are everything I need. You are so beautiful to me. You are so beautiful to me. Can't you see? oh oh, oh yeah. You're everything I've hoped for. And you?re everything I need. You are so beautiful. To me"
your math skills are terrible,"You're insecure, so half of four,. Your old brains are not what they were before,. Add two threes, it's fine for us,. 'cause we're young and we can. Still remember stuff. Everyone else can multiply by 60,. Everyone else can add two. Now take off one hundred and add on 24,. Then divide by two and add on seven more. And if you're struggling now. It's not hard to tell. You don't know. That your maths skills are terrible. If only you had a mind like me. You'd understand how to divide the sum by three,. And then just add on the age of this Oap. You don't know. That your maths skills are terrible. It's really kind of pitifull"
your song,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside. I'm not one of those, who can easily hide. I don't have much money, but boy if I did. I'd buy a big house where we both could live.. If I was a sculptor, but then again no,. Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show. I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do. My gift is my song and this one's for you.. And you can tell everybody, this is your song. It maybe quite simple but now that it's done,. I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind. That I put down in words. How wonderful life is now you're in the world.. I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss. Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross. But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song,. It's for people like you, that keep it turned on.. So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do. You see I've forgotten, if they're green or they're blue. Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean. Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen.. And you can tell everybody, this is your song. It maybe quite simple but now that it's done,. I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind. That I put down in words. How wonderful life is now you're in the world"
