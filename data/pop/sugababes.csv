I got what you need here, talk to me. And help me breathe. I wanna hold on. to sweet memories. Coz wasting time until your heart and mind realize desire. Oh boy!. I won't disguise my love for you-It's true I can't. Wait for you to be there. All my life, I need. Someone to make me feel good. And I wish that it is you. Every journey another sign. Images always pass me by. Feel like leaving the walk behind. When I think of you. Every moment I'm fighting this. Had to erase all your messages. Couldn't handle the things we said. Still I'm feeling you. It's driving me crazy, baby. Lately you've been slipping away from me. I try to keep holding on. I cannot be wrong. There's something I didn't see. We break up and make it up. Back and forth we never stop. Everytime a change of heart. I can't keep up. When you say yes then I say no. When it turns hot, we make it cold. But still something between us holds together. We break up and make it up. Back and forth we never stop. Everytime a change of heart. I can't keep up. When you say yes then I say no. When it turns hot, we make it cold. But still something between us holds together. Sometime a light in me. I think our time is over. Aint how funny how sweet I dream. but the bed keeps on getting colder. Sometimes when I close my eyes. It feels like I'm living by numbers. Cos I've been holding you so damn tight. I gotta stop cos it's pulling me under. It's driving me crazy, baby. Lately you've been slipping away from me. I try to keep holding on. I cannot be wrong. There's something I didn't see. We break up and make it up. Back and forth we never stop. Everytime a change of heart. I can't keep up.

angels with dirty faces,"I'm confused, I don't know. Which way do I really go. This guy is fly. But another one pass me by. Stuck in the middle of this spot. That is too damn hot.

Won't reveal the sneaky side of me. All day and night I creep out. I think about who I'm gonna go and link up. Don't think that I'm innocent, baby. 'coz this is driving me crazy.

I'm just a girl who likes to let it go. Party with my ladies 'til dawn. Still don't just let it go. Move your heads to the beat. And shake it down like you never did before. Move a little closer come with me. I'll show you the place to be. That's what he said to me. You don't know where we go. You don't know. That we're angels with dirty faces in the morning.

Sexy, classy. Don't think you'll put it past me. Angels in the day. But at night could be nasty. Keisha: wanna have the fellas locked on ice. Mutya: wanna play around with them like dice. Heidi: he didn't know I was a freak until he met me after dark. He thought this girl was a chic. You don't know where we go. You don't know. That we're angels with dirty faces in the morning. You don't know we've been on the town low. You don't know that we're missing to the morning. You don't know where we go. You don't know. That we're angels with dirty faces in the morning.

can we call a truce,"Can we call a truce?. We both have our truths. And I just wish this god damn mess.... We could try and play it cool when it's going down. I don't wanna fight.

I memorised it piece by piece, but I guess it's not that easy. Now it seems like I'm back on scratch again. And it seems like in all the fighting. We're losing sight.

Every second that you're gone I want you by my side. Another minute with you not around. I just might lose my mind. Was I wrong all the while or were you just not right?. We're supposed to be side by side. All I wanna do is set things right. Can we call a truce?. We both have our truths. And I just wish this god damn mess....

Push the thought of you away, do it today. Chorus. I'm older than my years, drowning in my tears. Surrounded by the fears, since you went away. A year ago, at Christmas. You locked away your secrets, kept them away from me. I only came to say goodbye, now you finally see. You wanna start all over again, make it work this time. But I don't wanna end up feeling far away from fine. I memorised what you said to me, so suprised. It was hell to be, so fustrated with the way we were. Not a single word could make it work. Now look at us today, we blew it away. Repeat chorus to fade."

Midas is king and he holds me so tight. And turns me to gold in the sunlight. I look around but I can't find you. (raise it up). If only I could see your face. (raise it up). Instead of rushing towards the skyline. (raise it up). I wish that I could just be brave. I must become a lion hearted girl. Ready for a fight. Before I make the final sacrifice.

So are you. So are you. Cooler than the red dress. Coz I'm cooler. Coz I'm cooler. Coz I'm cooler than the red dress. Coz I'm cooler. Coz I'm cooler. And when you're sure. You'll never let her play you again. She'll put on your favourite smile. Unplug the phone to get you alone. Dirty dance. Her hips will send you into a trance. Coz I'm cooler than the red dress. I'd rather catch a guy on my own (let me get it). Coz what you see the man gets (don't forget it). And if you don't I'm better off here alone. Ow, ow, ow. Done the candlelight to make you stay over.

Sweat running down my back. I'm wearing leather, black. Falling into a trap. There is no turning back. I got my ladies with me. Fellas get cool and freaky. But we've gotta keep him tame. Cos we don't wanna play that game. Everybody from the block. Needs to be feeling nice. It ain't no weakest party. But get up enjoy the ride. What you see and what you hear. Can never be exposed. Acting out of character. Is everything we know. I'm caught up in the middle. Jumping through the riddle. I'm falling just a little tonight (uh uh uh). Cos everybody's making trouble. Someone's burst their bubble. But we'll be getting by alright (uh uh uh). Eleven hours on a brand new day. I'm getting ready to go out and play. It's late at night, I'm caught in a groove. I'd kiss my ass before I'm feeling blue. Why don't you cry. For the day. Say goodbye. Runaway. Why don't you cry. For the day. Say goodbye. I said ok, 'cos. Ooh, won't you miss me like a hole in the head. Because I do boy (I do). And it's cool boy (yeah it's cool). And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed. Because of you boy, (I do boy).

Cynical and that was just me. You were never supposed to be. Part of what I would call amazing. It took so long to finally see. I didn't want to fall in love with you. I didn't want to know the things I knew. It wasn't until I look into the mirror. To Denial. Anything that you want boy (you know I got it). Anytime that you need it (you know I'm on it). Anything that you want boy (you know I got it). Anytime that you need it (you know I'm on it). Anything that you want boy (you know I got it). Anytime that you need it (you know I'm on it).

I'm ready to do something to relieve this mission. After waiting patiently for him to come and get it. He came on through and asked me if I wanted to get with him. I knew I had my mind made up from the very beginning. Won't miss this opportunity so you and me could feel it 'cos. (Push The Button, baby) If you're ready for me boy. You'd better.

Never sampled the flavouring?. Someday baby. We could have it all. (you on me,me on you,smoking till' we both turn blue). A steady speed. And we could we have it all. (me on you, you on me your kind of boring me to sleep). But we keep on falling over everything. When you and me. We could have it all. You're street smart with a big heart. You look like your having it. Talk fast, words last. When you look like your diggin' it. But i don't subscribe to the state that we're living it. Was it cause' we. We couldn't handle the flavouring. Someday maybe. We could have it all. (you on me, me on you, smoking till' we both turn blue). A steady speed. And we could have it all. (me on you, you on me, you're kind of boring me to sleep). But we keep falling over everything. When you and me. We could have it all. Better things are gonna come our way. You know we're gonna make it through this change. We're sitting tight as a tourniquet. Beliving we could. Have it all someday. Someday baby. We could have it all. (you on me, me on you, smoking till' we both turn blue). A steady speed. And we could have it all. (me on you, you on me, you're kind of boring me to sleep). But we keep falling over everything. When you and me. We could have it all."

whatever makes you happy,"You ain't gotta make it hard if it's easy. Applying pressure on the wound when it's bleeding. Hangin' with the guys cos it's just cool being me. Too much talking from the girls drive me crazy. You're telling me your definition of a pop star. You give a smile as you cover up your heart. So tell me what to say and I'll deliver it. I won't stop, can't stop, cos I'm living it. Chorus:. Whatever makes you happy. Is it crazy to be happy?. Cos it's doing it for me. Is it making you crazy that I'm happy?. Lately, you ain't doing it for me. Now let me break it down. Tell you what it means to me. I don't wanna spend my time in the VIP. I gotta meet someone who doesn't need publicity. Cos your style is..... And you can justify everything. But it don't really matter when reality kicks in. So tell me what to say and I'll deliver it. I won't stop, can't stop, cos I'm living it. Chorus:. Whatever makes you happy. Is it crazy to be happy?. Cos it's doing it for me. Is it making you crazy that I'm happy?. Lately, you ain't doing it for me. (You ain't doing it for me). So whatever makes you happy. Is it crazy to be happy?. Cos it's doing it for me. Is it making you crazy that I'm happy?. Lately, you ain't doing it for me. (You ain't doing it for me). I'm finding out I don't wanna be in this place. Cos it's about the music, not the fame. Chorus:. So whatever makes you happy. Is it crazy to be happy?. Cos it's doing it for me (cos it's doing it for me). Is it making you crazy that I'm happy?. Lately, you ain't doing it for me. (You ain't doing it for me). So whatever makes you happy. Is it crazy to be happy?. Cos it's doing it for me. Is it making you crazy (crazy) that I'm happy (happy)?. Lately, you ain't doing it for me. (You ain't doing it for me). So whatever makes you happy. Is it crazy to be happy?. Cos it's doing it for me."

Times before you break my small. You claim you love me, tease me, leave me, hold me, please me. Get off I'm movin on. Cos I'm tryin to take control. Chorus:. But it's you talking dirty. When I'm trying to sleep. And it's you, said you love me. After just one week. Tell me who's always calling on my telephone. Now it's you tryin to tell me. We should take things slow. And you said: ""don't go, don't go, please don't go. Please don't leave me, on my own. Don't go, don't go, please don't go. Please don't leave me, on my own"".

I forgive what you do then you want it back. I'm sick of playing this game. I ain't sticking with a claim fame. Stop this, right now. You crossed the line so baby get the hell out. Chorus:.

Make up your mind boy. Silly games you're always playing. Have no time boy. To sit and chase you. I ain't staying. Well, thinking it's funny. Well, you're spending money. And, every time you wanna get the upper hand remember. I'll be walking away looking cool with my. Matching bag and the jewels that I took. Don't you ever say it's not necessary. Then beg to come back. I ain't having that. Ooh whoa. Chorus:. But it's you talking dirty. When I'm trying to sleep. And it's you, said you love me. After just one week.

Left from selling my rims on the car. Parked behind the bar. And baby that's you on a good day. And baby that's you on a good day. Disaster is always just a beat away. But baby I'm sticking with you anyway. You messed up like when I went to Tokyo. For promotion and got back had a bill for two G's. From when you fell asleep calling me overseas. Asking 'bout my goal for the cash machine and you just. said yeah. But you tried to keep the house key. But then your new party friends went and called for. Some stripper and then I just said (fine). And baby that's you on a good day. And baby that's you on a good day. Disaster is always just a beat away. But baby I'm sticking with you anyway. And baby that's you on a good day.
