the ballad of paul k,"He´s drinking cold corona. Feels like is getting older. Now and noticing how he's finding. Grey hairs left in the shower. Tattoos fade by the hour. And he can't understand these feelings. Why life is getting him down. He used to smile now he frowns. And cries inside. It's been this way for a while. And he can´t seem to put things right. When life has been unkind. And you're losing your mind. Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find. It feels like time's not on your side. He doesn't like to mention. Applying for his pension. So his children don't know he's heading. Into a mid-life crisis. He can't afford the prices for. The new kitchen floor he's buying. He's been a drunk all his life. Two kids, and dog and a wife. He doesn´t know. And in the daytime he just sits and watches television shows. When life has been unkind. And you´re losing your mind. Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find. It feels like time´s not on your side. Don't know why but somehow. The ones you love you hate now,. you feel down and blue. Look at what you've thrown away. They stood beside you all the way. Now it's too late, it's too late for you. When life has been unkind. And you´re losing your mind. Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find. It feels like time´s not on your side"

Cuz baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider. But I gotta find out how it feels. I wanna know if your love is wild. I wanna know if love is real. Beyond the palace hemi-powered drones. Scream down the boulevard. Girls comb their hair in review mirrors. And the boys try to look so hard. The amusement park rises bold and stark. And kids are huddled on the beach in the mist. I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight. In an everlasting kiss. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. One, two, three, four. Highway's jammed with broken heroes. On a last-chance power drive. Everybody's out on the road tonight but. There's no place left to hide. Together Wendy we can live with the sadness. I'll love you with all the madness in my soul. Oh, someday girl I don't know when. We're gonna get to that place where really wanna go. And we'll walk in the sun. But till then tramps like us, baby we were born to. run. Tramps like us, baby we were born to run.

love is easy (dougie style),"Today, I'm laughing the clouds away,. I hear what the flowers say,. And drinking every drop of rain.. And I see, places that I have been. In ways that I've never seen.

What, do you want the moon?. Just say the world now and I'll throw a lasso around it. And put it down. Gee, that's a pretty good idea. I'll give you the moon, Mary). If this is love, then love is easy. It's the easiest thing to do. If this is love, then love completes me. Cause it feels like I've been missing you. A simple equation. With no complications to leave you confused. If this is love.... It's the easiest thing to do.... (So...So...anyway Mary. I'm having a bit of trouble pulling the moon down with a lasso. Turns out you can't actually do that. Is there anything else you'd like?. Just like, you know, a bunch of flowers or some chocolates,. Or maybe just dinner or a movie or something. I can't actually get the moon so,. Can we just forget I ever said that?. I'm sorry). By: @Lavignsen"
love is on the radio,"I was alone and my stomach was twisted. But I can get up now, the dark clouds have lifted. Back in the old life before you existed. I couldn't see right. My windows were misted. Said one word, made me feel much better. Starts with ""L"" and it's got four letters. Things are looking up. Looking up (hey). There's magic everywhere you go. Strangers stop to say hello (hello, hello, hello). So turn it up. Turn it up (hey). As loud as you can make it go. 'Cause love is on the radio. Now that I've found you my heart's beating faster. We could be happy forever and after. We could be married, like Mrs. and Mr. We'll have a son and we'll give him a sister. Just one thing holding us together. A four letter word and it lasts forever. Things are looking up. Looking up (hey). There's magic everywhere you go. Strangers stop to say hello (hello, hello, hello). So turn it up. Turn it up (hey). As loud as you can make it go. 'Cause love is on the radio. Love is on the radio. Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up). Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up). Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up). Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up). Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up). Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up). Love is on the radio. Funny one thing led to another. You came along, filled my days with colour. And it's been an everlasting summer. Since we found each other. Things are looking up. Looking up (hey). There's magic everywhere you go. Strangers stop to say hello (hello, hello, hello). So turn it up. Turn it up (hey). As loud as you can make it go. Play until your speakers blow. And listen 'till your ears explode. 'Cause love is on the radio"
making love,"Making love. Making love. Making love. Making love. Making.... I don't have much in the way of possesions or money. My empty pocket and wallet have seen better days. But I think to myself:. ""Why am I so worried out?"". 'Cause if we're not making money. We might as well be making love. I'm working day after day just to pay off the taxman (Taxman). Counting the pounds and the pennies as they roll away. But I think to myself:. ""I'm good with what I've got"". Cause if we're not making money. Baby, we should be making love. I can't afford the things you adore and I'm sorry. But big diamond rings don't mean anything. We're making love on the floor. Na, na, na, na....

mcfly the musical,"10 years have gone by, in the blink of an eye. Time really seems to fly when you're in Mcfly. So thanks for coming here tonight. I hope that we aren't playing shite. And if we are, please be polite, or Doug will cry. I wrote this song so that collectively we could get some perspective. Before we play and you scream, cheer and clap. So please allow me, if I may, to take you some place far away. And quickly give a brief 10 year recap. In 2001, I attended an audition and became the 4th addition to the Busted 1st edition. After 24 hours, those frickin' Busted bastards. Kicked me out and told me I was not what they're after. But I'd have done the same if I was in their position. But I'd have kicked the one out with the eyebrow condition. That wasn't the end, no, it didn't stop there. In 2003, up in Bolton somewhere. I met someone with talent oozing out of his bones. That's right folks, he was called Danny Jones. His skills on the guitar really are quite insane. But what balances his talent is his microscopic brain. He agreed that him and me should write a bunch of songs. So we got a record deal and here's where it goes wrong. We held an audition and two guys came along. Called Dougie and Harry, and that's how Mcfly was born. Being Mcfly is pretty awesome, you get to do radical things. Like touring round the world from Madrid to Brazil. Or building schools in Africa for kids that are ill. Yes, everyday is different but equally thrilling. There's no way of knowing what tomorrow will bring. Being Mcfly is pretty awesome, it's not very hard to see why. It's so awesome being M-C-F-L-Y. Being Mcfly is pretty wicked, but I am just one of four guys. I'm the only one who's not been on reality shows. But if I did I'd know I'd be receiving your votes. 'Cause I can do the tango with some folks that are famous. Or chill out in the jungle eating ostrich's anus. Or there's the Big Brother house, but I would never go in. 'Cause I'd rather sing some opera with Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. Or I could stay home writing songs for One Direction. In search for sing-alongable musical perfection. And spend an hour admiring my Harry Potter wand collection. Dougie wants to add a joke in here about erections. But it's a family show, so I'm making some corrections. For those penis eating, jungle swingers, ballroom dancing, opera singers. Being Mcfly is pretty awesome, it's not very hard to see why. It's so awesome being M-C-F-L-Y. It's been M-otional. C-ms so F-fortless. I'd do it all again for the L of it. Just don't ask me Y. It's been M-barrassing. C-eems so F-ing stressful. But overall it's been de-L-ightful. It's hard to Y-ne. Every now and then the strangest things go on. Like being on the cover of a gay magazine with no clothes on. But after 10 years of it, we just don't give a shit. We will do anything, literally anything. We might even pull our trousers down and wave around our danglings. Being Mcfly is pretty awesome, but it's not been the easiest ride. Dougie went to rehab and thank God he came back. I lost loads of weight and now I'm no longer fat. And Danny's going bald so he might start wearing hats. We've had our share of tabloid covered exploited romance. We still don't know if Harry really shagged Lindsay Lohan. Check me out, 'cause I can play piano with one hand. That's how awesome you become if you are in my band. You paid for the ticket so should probably buy a programme. Oh, being Mcfly is freakin' awesome!. But I am only one of four. The other three are equally as awesome as me. We're just about as awesome as a pop band can be. Our awesomeness is tangible, it's easy to see. Why we're so freaking radical, occasionally magical. Dramatical, fanatical, for us, matter-of-factual. It's actual, fantastical, contractual, we sold out shows!. There's no turning back at all from Mcfly. M-otional after 10 years. C - see my eyes are filling with tears. F - it's effortless. L - like elephants!. Y - 'cause we're awesome!. Just like Mcfly. M! C! F! L! Y!"

When she walks in the room my heart goes boom, yeah. Ba ba ba ba ba da ba [x2]. I tried to take her home but she said:. You're no good for me!. The first time that I saw her she stole my heart,.

pinball wizard,"Ever since I was a young boy. I played the silver ball. From Soho down to Brighton. I must have played them all. But I ain't seen nothing like him. In any amusement hall. That deaf, dumb and blind kid. SURE PLAYS A MEAN PINBALL!. He stands like a statue. Becomes part of the machine. Feeling all the bumpers. Always playing clean. He plays by intuition. The digit counts his ball. That deaf, dumb and blind kid. Sure plays a mean pinball. He's a pinball wizard. There has to be a twist. A pinball wizard. Got ""such a supple wrist. How do you think he does it. I DON'T KNOW!. What makes him so good. Ain't got no distractions. Can't hear no buzzers and bells. Don't see no lights a-flashin. He plays by sense of smell. Always gets a replay. Never see him fall. That deaf, dumb, and blind kid. Sure plays a mean pinball. I thought I was. The Bally table king. But I just handed. My pinball crown to him. He put up my favorite table. He can beat my best. His disciples lead him in. And he just does the rest. He's got crazy flipper fingers. I never see them fall. That deaf, dumb and blind kid. Sure plays a mean pinball. By : Jeniffer M. Tognon"

something nice (tom fletcher),"I couldn't live without you. Wouldn't make it pass. Three minutes without you. Or I would collapse. If you wasn't with me. I would go all dizzy.

Or forgetful it relaxes me to know that you are always there. I wouldn't be the same. You would surely see a change. If I had to spend a day without you. Flowing through my viens. You never wanted anything in return. Even though you're so easily bound. I couldn't live without you. Wouldn't want to try. Waking up without you. Surely I would die. Even when I'm sleeping. You are with me when I'm dreaming. I'm holping and believing. You're not leaving. This world sucks without you. All this blue and green. Wouldn't be without you. You're essentially. What my life is about. What my world revolves around. I just coldn't live without you. Oxygen, oxygen"

the ballad of paul k,"He´s drinking cold corona. Feels like is getting older. Now and noticing how he's finding. Grey hairs left in the shower. Tattoos fade by the hour. And he can't understand these feelings. Why life is getting him down. He used to smile now he frowns. And cries inside. It's been this way for a while. And he can´t seem to put things right. When life has been unkind. And you're losing your mind. Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find. It feels like time's not on your side. He doesn't like to mention. Applying for his pension. So his children don't know he's heading. Into a mid-life crisis. He can't afford the prices for. The new kitchen floor he's buying. He's been a drunk all his life. Two kids, and dog and a wife. He doesn´t know. And in the daytime he just sits and watches television shows. When life has been unkind. And you´re losing your mind. Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find. It feels like time´s not on your side. Don't know why but somehow. The ones you love you hate now,. you feel down and blue. Look at what you've thrown away. They stood beside you all the way. Now it's too late, it's too late for you. When life has been unkind. And you´re losing your mind. Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find. It feels like time´s not on your side"

When all the lights go down,. What do they show me?. The rules are all the same. It's just a different game. To tell you how I feel. Although it seems so rare. I was always there. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way you make me feel. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way you make me feel. I took a little time. Scripting all the things that I tell you. I'll send them through the mail. And if all goes well. it'd be a day or two. I spent some extra nights. Trying to forget the things that I've shown you. By now the smoke is cleared. And all along I feared. It would turn out this way. Though it might be wrong. My light is always on. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way you make me feel. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way you make me feel. Ba, ba, ba, ba, baBa, baBa, ba, ba, ba, baBa, baBa, ba, ba, ba, baBa, baBa, ba, ba, ba, ba. Look at us now. Ask me how did this get so. I'll tell you how. I drag my shoes on the ground. But I'm taking 'em off (taking 'em off). And I'm ready to walk, yeah. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way you make me feel. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way you make me feel, yeah.

the winner takes it all,"I don't wanna talk. About the things we've gone through. Though it's hurting me. Now it's history. I've played all my cards. And that's what you've done too. Nothing more to say. No more ace to play. The winner takes it all. The loser has to fall. Beside the destiny. That's a destiny. I was in your arms. Thinking I'd belong there. I figured it made sense. Building me a fence. Building me a home. Thinking I'd be strong there. But I was a fool. Playing by the rules. The gods may throw a dice. Their minds as cold as ice. And someone way down here. Loses someone dear. The winner takes it all. The loser has to fall. It's simple and it's plain.. Why should I complain.. But tell me does he kiss. Like I used to kiss you?. Does it feel the same. When he calls your name?. Somewhere deep inside. You must know I miss you. But what can I say. Rules must be obeyed. The judges will decide. The likes of me abide. Spectators of the show. Always staying low. The game is on again. A lover or a friend. A big thing or a small. The winner takes it all. I don't wanna talk. If it makes you feel sad. And I understand. You've come to shake my hand. I apologize. If it makes you feel bad. Seeing me so tense. No self-confidence. But you see. The winner takes it all. The winner takes it all. Oh, the winner takes it all. The winner takes it all, yeah"

We gotta chase the storm. Get out and touch the rain. You spend a lifetime waiting. Tomorrow chasing. With a cracked open shell of somebody you love. In the graveyard hour. The wind strikes and takes the power. It's those gods crying out for you to touch the tears. Woah, when it starts to pour. (sing!). Get out and touch the rain. Where rivers start to flow.

Something else. Our lives are short. But the nights are long. Mrs Halloween. Is drinking at the bar again in New Orleans. She throws another dart. It narrowly avoids my lonely broken heart. Torn apart. These summer girls are really. Something else(It won't be long). Our lives are short. But the nights are long. The nights go on and on. The nights go on and on. The nights go on and on. So pinch me I must be dreaming. My life has lost all its meaning. But I like the way I'm feeling now. Kissing her lips at midnight. Under the stars and moonlight. But I never thought we'd be this wrong. The nights go on and on. The nights go on and on. The nights go on and on. She's looking good tonight. I love the way she glows in ultraviolet light. Intoxicate my mind. I know that love is blind and I'm not seeing right. I'm not alright. These summer girls are really. Something else(It won't be long). Our lives are short. But the nights are long. These summer girls are really. Something else. Our lives are short (It won't be long). But the nights are long. The nights go on and on. The nights go on and on. The nights go on and on

the ballad of paul k,"He´s drinking cold corona. Feels like is getting older. Now and noticing how he's finding. Grey hairs left in the shower. Tattoos fade by the hour. And he can't understand these feelings. Why life is getting him down. He used to smile now he frowns. And cries inside. It's been this way for a while. And he can´t seem to put things right. When life has been unkind. And you're losing your mind. Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find. It feels like time's not on your side. He doesn't like to mention. Applying for his pension. So his children don't know he's heading. Into a mid-life crisis. He can't afford the prices for. The new kitchen floor he's buying. He's been a drunk all his life. Two kids, and dog and a wife. He doesn´t know. And in the daytime he just sits and watches television shows. When life has been unkind. And you´re losing your mind. Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find. It feels like time´s not on your side. Don't know why but somehow. The ones you love you hate now,. you feel down and blue. Look at what you've thrown away. They stood beside you all the way. Now it's too late, it's too late for you. When life has been unkind. And you´re losing your mind. Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find. It feels like time´s not on your side"

Cuz baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider. But I gotta find out how it feels. I wanna know if your love is wild. I wanna know if love is real. Beyond the palace hemi-powered drones. Scream down the boulevard. Girls comb their hair in review mirrors. And the boys try to look so hard. The amusement park rises bold and stark. And kids are huddled on the beach in the mist. I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight. In an everlasting kiss. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. One, two, three, four. Highway's jammed with broken heroes. On a last-chance power drive. Everybody's out on the road tonight but. There's no place left to hide. Together Wendy we can live with the sadness. I'll love you with all the madness in my soul. Oh, someday girl I don't know when. We're gonna get to that place where really wanna go. And we'll walk in the sun. But till then tramps like us, baby we were born to. run. Tramps like us, baby we were born to run.

When all the luxuries she owns, should be mine. Now I start to wonder why. You shrug me off when I say hi. Treat me so bad despite how hard I try. Goodbye to you, been wasting all my time. You're no longer mine, and now you've left me. I can't seem to get you off my mind. That's when I realized, you had me hypnotised. Girl you can't hold me back no more.

love is easy (dougie style),"Today, I'm laughing the clouds away,. I hear what the flowers say,. And drinking every drop of rain.. And I see, places that I have been. In ways that I've never seen. My side of the grass is green. I can't believe that it's so simple. It feels so natural to me. If this is love, then love is easy. It's the easiest thing to do. If this is love, then love completes me. Cause it feels like I've been missing you. A simple equation. With no complications to leave you confused. If this is love love love. It's the easiest thing to do.... Feel the way that I do. To watching the grey skies bloom. And make dirty streets look new. And the birds sing.... And now I know exactly what they mean. I can't believe that it's so simple. Feels so natural to me. If this is love, then love is easy. It's the easiest thing to do. If this is love, then love completes me. Cause it feels like I've been missing you. A simple equation. With no complications to leave you confused. If this is love love love. It's the easiest thing to do.... (What do you want Mary?. What, do you want the moon?. Just say the world now and I'll throw a lasso around it. And put it down. Gee, that's a pretty good idea. I'll give you the moon, Mary). If this is love, then love is easy. It's the easiest thing to do. If this is love, then love completes me. Cause it feels like I've been missing you. A simple equation. With no complications to leave you confused. If this is love.... It's the easiest thing to do.... (So...So...anyway Mary. I'm having a bit of trouble pulling the moon down with a lasso. Turns out you can't actually do that. Is there anything else you'd like?. Just like, you know, a bunch of flowers or some chocolates,. Or maybe just dinner or a movie or something. I can't actually get the moon so,. Can we just forget I ever said that?. I'm sorry). By: @Lavignsen"
love is on the radio,"I was alone and my stomach was twisted. But I can get up now, the dark clouds have lifted. Back in the old life before you existed. I couldn't see right. My windows were misted. Said one word, made me feel much better. Starts with ""L"" and it's got four letters. Things are looking up. Looking up (hey). There's magic everywhere you go. Strangers stop to say hello (hello, hello, hello). So turn it up. Turn it up (hey). As loud as you can make it go. 'Cause love is on the radio. Now that I've found you my heart's beating faster. We could be happy forever and after. We could be married, like Mrs. and Mr. We'll have a son and we'll give him a sister. Just one thing holding us together. A four letter word and it lasts forever. Things are looking up. Looking up (hey). There's magic everywhere you go. Strangers stop to say hello (hello, hello, hello). So turn it up. Turn it up (hey). As loud as you can make it go. 'Cause love is on the radio. Love is on the radio. Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up). Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up). Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up). Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up). Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up). Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up). Love is on the radio. Funny one thing led to another. You came along, filled my days with colour. And it's been an everlasting summer. Since we found each other. Things are looking up. Looking up (hey). There's magic everywhere you go. Strangers stop to say hello (hello, hello, hello). So turn it up. Turn it up (hey). As loud as you can make it go. Play until your speakers blow. And listen 'till your ears explode. 'Cause love is on the radio"
making love,"Making love. Making love. Making love. Making love. Making.... I don't have much in the way of possesions or money. My empty pocket and wallet have seen better days. But I think to myself:. ""Why am I so worried out?"". 'Cause if we're not making money. We might as well be making love. I'm working day after day just to pay off the taxman (Taxman). Counting the pounds and the pennies as they roll away. But I think to myself:. ""I'm good with what I've got"". Cause if we're not making money. Baby, we should be making love. I can't afford the things you adore and I'm sorry. But big diamond rings don't mean anything. We're making love on the floor. Na, na, na, na....

mcfly the musical,"10 years have gone by, in the blink of an eye. Time really seems to fly when you're in Mcfly. So thanks for coming here tonight. I hope that we aren't playing shite. And if we are, please be polite, or Doug will cry. I wrote this song so that collectively we could get some perspective. Before we play and you scream, cheer and clap. So please allow me, if I may, to take you some place far away. And quickly give a brief 10 year recap. In 2001, I attended an audition and became the 4th addition to the Busted 1st edition. After 24 hours, those frickin' Busted bastards. Kicked me out and told me I was not what they're after. But I'd have done the same if I was in their position. But I'd have kicked the one out with the eyebrow condition. That wasn't the end, no, it didn't stop there. In 2003, up in Bolton somewhere. I met someone with talent oozing out of his bones. That's right folks, he was called Danny Jones. His skills on the guitar really are quite insane. But what balances his talent is his microscopic brain. He agreed that him and me should write a bunch of songs. So we got a record deal and here's where it goes wrong. We held an audition and two guys came along. Called Dougie and Harry, and that's how Mcfly was born. Being Mcfly is pretty awesome, you get to do radical things. Like touring round the world from Madrid to Brazil. Or building schools in Africa for kids that are ill. Yes, everyday is different but equally thrilling. There's no way of knowing what tomorrow will bring. Being Mcfly is pretty awesome, it's not very hard to see why. It's so awesome being M-C-F-L-Y. Being Mcfly is pretty wicked, but I am just one of four guys. I'm the only one who's not been on reality shows. But if I did I'd know I'd be receiving your votes. 'Cause I can do the tango with some folks that are famous. Or chill out in the jungle eating ostrich's anus. Or there's the Big Brother house, but I would never go in. 'Cause I'd rather sing some opera with Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. Or I could stay home writing songs for One Direction. In search for sing-alongable musical perfection. And spend an hour admiring my Harry Potter wand collection. Dougie wants to add a joke in here about erections. But it's a family show, so I'm making some corrections. For those penis eating, jungle swingers, ballroom dancing, opera singers. Being Mcfly is pretty awesome, it's not very hard to see why. It's so awesome being M-C-F-L-Y. It's been M-otional. C-ms so F-fortless. I'd do it all again for the L of it. Just don't ask me Y. It's been M-barrassing. C-eems so F-ing stressful. But overall it's been de-L-ightful. It's hard to Y-ne. Every now and then the strangest things go on. Like being on the cover of a gay magazine with no clothes on. But after 10 years of it, we just don't give a shit. We will do anything, literally anything. We might even pull our trousers down and wave around our danglings. Being Mcfly is pretty awesome, but it's not been the easiest ride. Dougie went to rehab and thank God he came back. I lost loads of weight and now I'm no longer fat. And Danny's going bald so he might start wearing hats. We've had our share of tabloid covered exploited romance. We still don't know if Harry really shagged Lindsay Lohan. Check me out, 'cause I can play piano with one hand. That's how awesome you become if you are in my band. You paid for the ticket so should probably buy a programme. Oh, being Mcfly is freakin' awesome!. But I am only one of four. The other three are equally as awesome as me. We're just about as awesome as a pop band can be. Our awesomeness is tangible, it's easy to see. Why we're so freaking radical, occasionally magical. Dramatical, fanatical, for us, matter-of-factual. It's actual, fantastical, contractual, we sold out shows!. There's no turning back at all from Mcfly. M-otional after 10 years. C - see my eyes are filling with tears. F - it's effortless. L - like elephants!. Y - 'cause we're awesome!. Just like Mcfly. M! C! F! L! Y!"

When she walks in the room my heart goes boom, yeah. Ba ba ba ba ba da ba [x2]. I tried to take her home but she said:. You're no good for me!. The first time that I saw her she stole my heart,. And if we were together, nothing could tear us apart,. When she walks in the room my heart goes boom [x3]. I tried to take her home but she said: you're no good for me. When she walks in the room my heart goes boom,. Ba ba ba ba ba da ba [x2]. I tried to take her home but she said you're no good for me. Ba ba ba ba ba da ba [x8]"

pinball wizard,"Ever since I was a young boy. I played the silver ball. From Soho down to Brighton. I must have played them all. But I ain't seen nothing like him. In any amusement hall. That deaf, dumb and blind kid. SURE PLAYS A MEAN PINBALL!. He stands like a statue. Becomes part of the machine. Feeling all the bumpers. Always playing clean. He plays by intuition. The digit counts his ball. That deaf, dumb and blind kid. Sure plays a mean pinball. He's a pinball wizard. There has to be a twist. A pinball wizard. Got ""such a supple wrist. How do you think he does it. I DON'T KNOW!. What makes him so good. Ain't got no distractions. Can't hear no buzzers and bells. Don't see no lights a-flashin. He plays by sense of smell. Always gets a replay. Never see him fall. That deaf, dumb, and blind kid. Sure plays a mean pinball. I thought I was. The Bally table king. But I just handed. My pinball crown to him. He put up my favorite table. He can beat my best. His disciples lead him in. And he just does the rest. He's got crazy flipper fingers. I never see them fall. That deaf, dumb and blind kid. Sure plays a mean pinball. By : Jeniffer M. Tognon"

something nice (tom fletcher),"I couldn't live without you. Wouldn't make it pass. Three minutes without you. Or I would collapse. If you wasn't with me. I would go all dizzy. Need to have you near me constantly. You've always been beside me. So dependable. Like the soul inside me. Warm and wonderful. If I get distracted. Or forgetful it relaxes me to know that you are always there. I wouldn't be the same. You would surely see a change. If I had to spend a day without you. Flowing through my viens. You never wanted anything in return. Even though you're so easily bound. I couldn't live without you. Wouldn't want to try. Waking up without you. Surely I would die. Even when I'm sleeping. You are with me when I'm dreaming. I'm holping and believing. You're not leaving. This world sucks without you. All this blue and green. Wouldn't be without you. You're essentially. What my life is about. What my world revolves around. I just coldn't live without you. Oxygen, oxygen"

the ballad of paul k,"He´s drinking cold corona. Feels like is getting older. Now and noticing how he's finding. Grey hairs left in the shower. Tattoos fade by the hour. And he can't understand these feelings. Why life is getting him down. He used to smile now he frowns. And cries inside. It's been this way for a while. And he can´t seem to put things right. When life has been unkind. And you're losing your mind. Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find. It feels like time's not on your side. He doesn't like to mention. Applying for his pension. So his children don't know he's heading. Into a mid-life crisis. He can't afford the prices for. The new kitchen floor he's buying. He's been a drunk all his life. Two kids, and dog and a wife. He doesn´t know. And in the daytime he just sits and watches television shows. When life has been unkind. And you´re losing your mind. Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find. It feels like time´s not on your side. Don't know why but somehow. The ones you love you hate now,. you feel down and blue. Look at what you've thrown away. They stood beside you all the way. Now it's too late, it's too late for you. When life has been unkind. And you´re losing your mind. Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find. It feels like time´s not on your side"

I'm dying to take you home. I'm dying to thank you all. I'm dying to thank you all. I thank you all. And if this is the last song I ever sing. Then I'm giving it everything. I'm giving it all. And if this is the last song I ever play. Then I guess its time to say. We thank you all...."
the way you make me feel,"I think yesterday. And all the times I spent being lonely. I watched the young be young. While all the singers sung. About the way I felt. The days are here again. When all the lights go down,. What do they show me?. The rules are all the same. It's just a different game. To tell you how I feel. Although it seems so rare. I was always there. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way you make me feel. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way you make me feel. I took a little time. Scripting all the things that I tell you. I'll send them through the mail. And if all goes well. it'd be a day or two. I spent some extra nights. Trying to forget the things that I've shown you. By now the smoke is cleared. And all along I feared. It would turn out this way. Though it might be wrong. My light is always on. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way you make me feel. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way you make me feel. Ba, ba, ba, ba, baBa, baBa, ba, ba, ba, baBa, baBa, ba, ba, ba, baBa, baBa, ba, ba, ba, ba. Look at us now. Ask me how did this get so. I'll tell you how. I drag my shoes on the ground. But I'm taking 'em off (taking 'em off). And I'm ready to walk, yeah. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way you make me feel. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way. Oooh, oooh I can't stop digging the way you make me feel, yeah.

the winner takes it all,"I don't wanna talk. About the things we've gone through. Though it's hurting me. Now it's history. I've played all my cards. And that's what you've done too. Nothing more to say. No more ace to play. The winner takes it all. The loser has to fall. Beside the destiny. That's a destiny. I was in your arms. Thinking I'd belong there. I figured it made sense. Building me a fence. Building me a home. Thinking I'd be strong there. But I was a fool. Playing by the rules. The gods may throw a dice. Their minds as cold as ice. And someone way down here. Loses someone dear. The winner takes it all. The loser has to fall. It's simple and it's plain.. Why should I complain.. But tell me does he kiss. Like I used to kiss you?. Does it feel the same. When he calls your name?. Somewhere deep inside. You must know I miss you. But what can I say. Rules must be obeyed. The judges will decide. The likes of me abide. Spectators of the show. Always staying low. The game is on again. A lover or a friend. A big thing or a small. The winner takes it all. I don't wanna talk. If it makes you feel sad. And I understand. You've come to shake my hand. I apologize. If it makes you feel bad. Seeing me so tense. No self-confidence. But you see. The winner takes it all. The winner takes it all. Oh, the winner takes it all. The winner takes it all, yeah"

We gotta chase the storm. Get out and touch the rain. You spend a lifetime waiting. Tomorrow chasing. With a cracked open shell of somebody you love. In the graveyard hour. The wind strikes and takes the power. It's those gods crying out for you to touch the tears. Woah, when it starts to pour. (sing!). Get out and touch the rain. Where rivers start to flow.

ultraviolet,Nothing goes to plan. It's all a game of chance they say in Wonderland. There's magic in the air. A tragic love affair that I don't understand. These summer girls are really. Something else. Our lives are short. But the nights are long. Mrs Halloween. Is drinking at the bar again in New Orleans. She throws another dart. It narrowly avoids my lonely broken heart. Torn apart. These summer girls are really. Something else(It won't be long). Our lives are short. But the nights are long. The nights go on and on. The nights go on and on. The nights go on and on. So pinch me I must be dreaming. My life has lost all its meaning. But I like the way I'm feeling now. Kissing her lips at midnight. Under the stars and moonlight. But I never thought we'd be this wrong. The nights go on and on. The nights go on and on. The nights go on and on. She's looking good tonight. I love the way she glows in ultraviolet light. Intoxicate my mind. I know that love is blind and I'm not seeing right. I'm not alright. These summer girls are really. Something else(It won't be long). Our lives are short. But the nights are long.

(oh baby don't you know). Winter, spring, summer or fall. All you've got to do is call. Lord, I'll be there yes I will. You've got a friend. Oh, you've got a friend. Aint it good to know you've got a friend. Aint it good to know you've got a friend. You've got a friend"
