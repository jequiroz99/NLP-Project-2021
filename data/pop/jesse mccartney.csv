When nobody else can help. Because you live, girl. My world has twice as many stars in the sky. Because you live, I live. Because you live, there's a reason why. I carry on when I lose the fight.

best day of my life,(Verse 1). Wake up around a half past 10. Cant believe that I'm late again. Put down about a quart of caffeine. To start my pulse and then. I grab my jeans off the floor. Then I hit the door. Its just the same old same. It goes to show you never know. When everything's about to change. (Chorus). Just another day. It started out like any other. Just another girl. Who took my breath away. Then she turned around. She took me down. Just another day that I. Have the best day of my life. (Verse 2). Cant say exactly what it was. She's not the usual type. She wore a cowboy hat. With her red Prada boots. And a Gwen Stefani smile. Then she pulled out a pen. And surprised me when. She wrote her number on my hand. Then she was gone. But from now on. I'm gonna be a different man. (Chorus). Just another day. It started out like any other. Just another girl. Who took my breath away. Then she turned around. She took me down. Just another day that I.

all about us,"I'm on cloud nine. I end your sentences, you start mine. When I'm wrong you say that I'm right. I never felt the way I do when I'm with you. But it's been part time. And I feel it coming, we're in twilight. Grey area wants me to choose sides. And this line of questioning is new. Out of the blue, she says. Are you all about us?. Tell me you're the one that I can trust. Tell me that forever's never enough. That I'm the only one that's getting your love. Are you all about us?. Am I all about us?. I know that she's someone that I can trust. But committing somehow feels like giving up. And I love this girl but do I love her enough. To be all about us. Are you all about us?. Now I'm tongue tied. I kiss her lips trying to kill time. She tells me to say something and don't lie. My indecision is a clue, I'm torn in two. If I had it my way. We'd stay the same nothing would have to change. But I hear those words like they're on replay. This line of questioning is new. Out of the blue, she says. Are you all about us?. Tell me you're the one that I can trust. Tell me that forever's never enough. That I'm the only one that's getting your love. Are you all about us?. Am I all about us?. I know that she's someone that I can trust. But committing somehow feels like giving up. And I love this girl but do I love her enough. To be all about us. Are you all about us?. Ain't nobody love you, baby, like I do. And you better believe it. But I just need a little more time to think this through. It's true, it's true, it's me, not you. Are you all about us?. Are you all about us, about us, about us?. Are you all about us?. Tell me you're the one that I can trust. Tell me that forever's never enough. That I'm the only one that's getting your love. Are you all about us?. Am I all about us?. I know that she's someone that I can trust. But committing somehow feels like giving up. And I love this girl but do I love her enough. To be all about us. Are you all about us?"
anybody,"She left me hangin' by a thread again. I stood there waiting like a fool for her. I never dreamed that I'd be in this place. But here I am all alone. It's not the first time that she's walked away. Changed all our plans within the blink of an eye. And looking back it's always been the same. But I refused to see it all for what it was. [Chorus:]. Has anybody ever felt this way. Has anybody been ripped apart. Anybody give everything to the one they love. Am I the only one left behind. Am I the only one who hates goodbyes. God I know this can't go on forever. I wonder if she ever thinks of me. And all the promises she swore to keep. Some nights I lay in bed just burning up. 'Cause I know that she's out with someone else. [Chorus]. I was the one who gave up everything for her. When no one would listen I heard every word, oh. It took me so long to see that maybe I am better off alone. [Chorus X2]. God I know this can't go on. All I wanna do is just move on. God I know this can't go on forever. Yeah I know this won't go on forever. God I know this can't go on forever"

My world has twice as many stars in the sky. It's allright, I survived, I'm alive again. Cause of you, made it through every storm. What is life, what's the use if you're killing time. I'm so glad I've found an angel. Someone who was there when all my hopes fell. I wanna fly looking in your eyes. Because you live and breathe. Because you make me believe in myself. When nobody else can help. Because you live, girl. My world has twice as many stars in the sky. Because you live, I live. Because you live, there's a reason why. I carry on when I lose the fight. I want to give what you've given me always. Because you live and breathe. Because you make me believe in myself. When nobody else can help. Because you live, girl. My world has twice as many stars in the sky. Because you live and breathe. Because you make me believe in myself. When nobody else can help. Because you live, girl.

best day of my life,(Verse 1). Wake up around a half past 10. Cant believe that I'm late again. Put down about a quart of caffeine. To start my pulse and then. I grab my jeans off the floor. Then I hit the door. Its just the same old same. It goes to show you never know. When everything's about to change. (Chorus). Just another day. It started out like any other. Just another girl. Who took my breath away. Then she turned around. She took me down. Just another day that I. Have the best day of my life. (Verse 2). Cant say exactly what it was. She's not the usual type. She wore a cowboy hat. With her red Prada boots. And a Gwen Stefani smile. Then she pulled out a pen. And surprised me when. She wrote her number on my hand. Then she was gone. But from now on. I'm gonna be a different man. (Chorus). Just another day. It started out like any other. Just another girl. Who took my breath away. Then she turned around. She took me down. Just another day that I. Have the best day of my life. (Bridge). I guess it goes to show. You never really know. When everything's about to change. (Chorus x2). Just another day. It started out like any other.

I see your face. Yet everyone around me. Thinks. That I'm going crazy. Maybe, maybe. (Chorus). And it's draining all of me. Oh, they find it. Hard to believe. I'll be wearing these scars.

Is it fear that makes us blind?. Tell me, why is love so hard to find?. If we hear so much about it. And we can´t go on without it. Let the mystery unwind. Tell me, why is love so hard to find?. All I know is when you find it. Even earth can feel like you're in heaven. Tell me now, unlock the secret. Help us all to find the hidden treasure. From the moment we arrive. We want to fill the space inside. We all need to feel alive. [REPEAT CHORUS]. Don't you know I'm never gonna give up. 'Til I find the love?. I'll be searchin' the whole world over. To find my love.... [REPEAT CHORUS]"
winter wonderland,Sleigh bells ring. Are you listening. In the lane. Snow is glistening. A beautiful sight. We're happy tonight. Walking in a winter wonderland. Gone away is the bluebird. Here to stay is a new bird. He sings a love song. As we go along. Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman. Then pretend he is Parson Brown. He'll say: Are you married?. We'll say: No man. But you can do the job. When you're in town. Later on. We'll conspire. As we dream by the fire. To face unafraid. The plans that we've made. Walking in a winter wonderland. Winter wonderland. Winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman. And pretend that he's a circus clown. We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman. Until the other kids knock him down. walking. When it snows. Ain't it thrilling. Though your nose gets a chilling. We'll frolic and play. The Eskimo way. Walking in a winter wonderland. walking in a winter. walking in a winter. I'm walking. Wonderland. Wonderland
without u,"I like when you whisper softly. Things only I should hear. That lead me on. I like the way you smile at me. And make me feel like nothin'. Can go wrong. Tell me this will last forever. Dont you ever leave. Chrous:. I dont wanna be without you. dream without you. walk without you. talk without you baby. Never take a chance without you. Dance without you. Nothing is the same without you baby. I could never deal without you. Heal without you. Begin without you. End without you. Baby, Im in need. I can't breathe. No, I don't wanna be.... Without you. I dont wanna be without you. dream without you. walk without you. talk without you baby. I love when your eyes watch over me. With a look only I can tell. Whats on your mind. I love the way that you find me. Whenever I've lost my way. You're just in time. Baby we've got something started. Say we'll never stop. I dont wanna be without you. dream without you. walk without you. talk without you baby. I'll lock up my heart. and throw away the key. if thats what it takes. To keep you with me. You open the door. To all thats good in me. I cant deny the truth. That I could never be without you. I dont wanna be without you. dream without you. walk without you. talk without you baby. ~*~*~* by Mah Pignatari"

young love,"We've been together a minute. Seen couples come and go. When people ask how we did it. I flash a picture of you. 'Cause lookin' at you, it still feels like the day I met you. Lookin' at you, I'm still weak in the knees. Young love, girl, I'm still drooling like a baby. Young love, it feels like I'm seventeen. So what if we're older than we're acting lately. Young love is all that we'll ever be. So hit the lights, crack the wine, baby lock the door. Slippin' out of our clothes, throw 'em on the floor. Dirty dancin' to our song on the radio. Young love, (hey!) is all that we'll ever be. You've always been something different. A cut above the rest. My number one with a bullet. You hit me right in the chest. 'Cause lookin' at you, it still feels like the day I met you. Lookin' at you, still knocks me off my feet. Young love, girl, I'm still drooling like a baby. Young love, it feels like I'm seventeen. So what if we're older than we're acting lately. Young love is all that we'll ever be. So hit the lights, crack the wine, baby lock the door. Slippin' out of our clothes, throw 'em on the floor. Dirty dancin' to our song on the radio. Young love, (hey!) is all that we'll ever be. And we both know that we'll never find another (no). That'll ever compare to you and me. 'Cause with you it's like the fun is never over (hey). Forever young we will be. Young love. Young love (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh). Young love, girl, I'm still drooling like a baby. Young love, it feels like I'm seventeen. So what if we're older than we're acting lately. Young love is all that we'll ever be. So hit the lights, crack the wine, baby lock the door. Slippin' out of our clothes, throw 'em on the floor. Dirty dancin' to our song on the radio. Young love, (hey!) is all that we'll ever be"
