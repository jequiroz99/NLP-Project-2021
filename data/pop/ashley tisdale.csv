how do you love someone,"Mama never taught me how to love. Daddy never taught me how to feel. Mama never taught me how to touch. Daddy never showed me how to heal. Mama never set a good example. Daddy never held mama's hand. Mama found everything hard to handle. Daddy never stood up like a man. I've walked around broken, emotionally frozen. Getting it on, getting it wrong. (Chorus). How do you love someone without getting hurt?. How do you love someone without crawling in the dirt?. So far in my life, clouds have blocked the sun. How do you love, how do you love someone?. How do you love, how do you love someone?. I was always the chosen child. The biggest scandal I became. They told me I'd never survive. But survival's my middle name. I've walked around hopin', just barely copin'. Gettin' it on, gettin' it wrong. (Chorus). How do you love someone without getting hurt?. How do you love someone without crawling in the dirt?. So far in my life, clouds have blocked the sun. How do you love, how do you love someone?. How do you love, how do you love someone?. It's hard to talk... to say what's deep inside. It's hard to tell the truth when you've always lied. (Chorus). How do you love someone without getting hurt?. How do you love someone without crawling in the dirt?. So far in my life, clouds have blocked the sun. How do you love, how do you love someone?. How do you love someone and make it last?. How do you love someone without tripping out the past?. So far in my life, clouds have blocked the sun. How do you love, how do you love someone?. How do you love, how do you love someone?. Someone..."

I think everyone can learn. With your life. With your talent. Because legends don't die. They only eternalize. I think if everyone search about you. They will see that you was a genius. And the entertainers of today. Can learn with you. How to be a hero. Reading about your story. I saw that no one will be like you. Because you're irreplaceable. And the entertainers of today. Can learn with you. How to be a hero. But I still ask myself. Why did you had to go. People die and go to heaven. But you died. And now you're in Neverland. Living with your best friend. The eternal Peter Pan"

too many walls,"Wish on a rainbows is all I can do. Dream of the good times that we never knew. No late nights in the warmth of your arms. I'll dream on. Living in wonder, thinking of you. Still looking for ways to uncover the truth. You're so young is all they can say. They don't know.. If I could change the way of the world. I'd be your girl. Too many walls have been built inbetween us. Too many dreams have been shattered around us. If I seem to give up they'll still never win. Deep in my heart I know the strength is within. Watching the others chances drift by. They'll never discover these feelings I hide. Deep inside I'm falling apart. All alone with a broken heart. Thinking in silence is all they allow. These words still unspoken may never be found. All these dreams one day will be mine. They cross my mind. My time has yet to come. Until then. Too many walls have been built inbetween us. Too many dreams have been shattered around us. If I seem to give up they'll still never win. Deep in my heart I know the strength is within. Chorus to fade....."

They say that breaking up is a hard thing to do. But oh so easy when you're dumping a fool. If you did it then admit it cause it's written all. over your face. Called your bluff. Had enough. I'm so over it. You'll be sorry but don't worry cause you're. really not that hard to replace. Tough luck. You suck. That was such a waste. Chorus:. Whatcha waiting for. Come over and give it to me. Whatcha waiting for. I already know what you did. Whatcha waiting for. Whatcha running from. Baby, baby, baby. Why you're cheating on me. Whatcha waiting for. I?m everything you will never be. I?m walking out the door. Go ahead and crawl on your knees. Whatcha waiting for. Whatcha running from. Baby, baby, baby. How could you do this to me. . La la la la la la. That don't work anymore. Shut your mouth. I don't care. Game is over. La la la la la la. Heard it all before. No way back. You so whack. You're a loner (loner). Whatcha waiting for. You messing with my head. I can't take this no more. And all the things you said?. Chorus:. Whatcha waiting for. Come over and give it to me. Whatcha waiting for. I already know what you did. Whatcha waiting for. Whatcha running from. Baby, baby, baby. Why you're cheating on me. Whatcha waiting for. I?m everything you will never be. I?m walking out the door. Go ahead and crawl on your knees.

who i am?,[Verse 1]. All alone in the dark. Now that our walk in the park. Has headed suddenly off a cliff. It's like you're dragging me down. Our loves's six feet underground. And now I'm finding it hard to breathe. Our days have turned into mud (don't know don't think you know me). And now I know that I'm done. [Chorus]. You never call me by name. Think I want you to change. Think you know me. But you don't really know what I mean. You say I take it too deep. You think you know me. But you don't really know who I am. [Verse 2]. Now I'm seen the light. Paid the toll of our fights. I'm driving away from you. I won't get stuck in the past. How could you think this would last. You're just a bump in the road for me. Our days had turned into mud (don't know don't think you know me). And now I know that I'm done. [Chorus]. You never call me by name. Think I want you to change. Think you know me. But you don't really know what I mean. You say I take it too deep. You think you know me. But you don't really know who I am. [Chorus]. You never call me by name. Think I want you to change. Think you know me. But you don't really know what I mean. You say I take it too deep. You think you know me. But you don't really know who I am

you're always here,"I looked to the sky last night. And my eyes caught the light of a star. Burning like the memories of brighter days. And I know this life is all mine. Just a moment in time. But every day is another beggining so. Hold yourself together. You know it's for the better. Now it's our turn. It's our turn to carry this way. Nothing is forever. You can't predict the weather. Now it's our time. And I'll help you carry this way. They say the love won't die. And then I realize. What will be, will be. You're always here with me. And in the darkest night. I feel you by my side. What will be, will be. You're always here with me. Meet me in my dreams. And you can help me believe. Tell me that are gonna be better days. To see your face. And feel your embrace. I swear, I'll never forget what you gave. So I. Hold myself together. I know it's for the better. Now it's my turn. It's my turn to carry this way. Nothing is forever. You can't predict the weather. Now you'll be there. And help me carry this way. They say that love won't die. And then I realize. What will be, will be. You're always here with me. And in the darkest night. I feel you by my side. What will be, will be. You're always here with me. And if the day goes by. And you start to question why. (Tell me why). There's a way to hold on. Just gotta stay strong. Close your eyes and you will find. Love lives on inside. They say that love won't die. And then I realize. What will be, will be. You're always here with me. And in the darkest night. I feel you by my side. What will be, will be. You're always here with me. What will be, will be. You're always here with me. What will be, will be. You're always here with me"
