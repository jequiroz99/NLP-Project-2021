But until then, I'll be posted up right here rain, sleet, hail, snow (hail snow). But until then, I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough (gettin' dough). [verse 1]. First, let me explain that I'm just a black man,. And I come from the darkside, so I'm havin a hard time stayin on track man,. My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin yet.

blood into gold,Akon. [Peter Buffett]. When I go to sleep at night. I wonder why I don't feel the pain. From where the sun is shining bright. But empty shells of lives remain. I know the news will tell me why. And we'll watch others take the fall. But who will hear when someone cries. That saving one can save us all. Can you open your heart?. Will you give me your hand?. Can you look in my eyes?. Will you see who I am?. The blood of your sons and. The blood of your daughters. The blood of my sisters. The blood of my brothers. The blood of your fathers. The blood of your mothers. All that you own through the blood of another. [Akon]. See when I go to sleep at night. Everything seems to fade away. If I live to see daylight. What part of life will I decide to change?. I see the sun.. Kind of reminds me of the gold that brightens our day. I see the rain. And also see all the blood that it washes away. The blood of your sons and. The blood of your daughters. The blood of my sisters. The blood of my brothers. The blood of your fathers. The blood of your mothers. All that you own through the blood of another. [Peter Buffett]. Now it's time to shine the light. In all the corners that we fear. We can win without a fight. But only love can take us there. Can you open your heart?. Will you give me your hand?. Can you look in my eyes?. Will you see who I am?. The blood of your sons and. The blood of your daughters. The blood of my sisters. The blood of my brothers. The blood of your fathers. The blood of your mothers. All that you own through the blood of another. The blood of your sons and. The blood of your daughters. The blood of my sisters. The blood of my brothers. The blood of your fathers. The blood of your mothers. All that you own through the blood of another
blown away,"[Akon]. Cheh. [Styles P]. This shit is crazy. Crazy. [Akon]. It's one of those things man. You gotta experience to know what I'm talkin' about. Ha ha. It's where the goin' get rough. [Styles P]. Akon. [Akon]. The tough stay tough. [Styles P]. Styles P. [Akon]. Up front. Let's go. Konvict. [Akon]. We in too deep to turn back now D. [Styles P]. Sure is. [Akon]. Watch yourself. Before you get. Blown away. [Styles P]. You know where I come from. The place where your fate is a mic. Or a bull or a dum dum. A jail cell a pine box. And brothers is dumb young. Young boys. Still bustin' guns for the slum. that they come from. Cops is the only ones they gon' run from. That's it. They puttin' they hood up. But 9 out of 10 of us ain't got good luck. You gon' ride on a man and catch 25. Or get hit and get sent to the other side. You lose both sides of the coin. So me I play the hood baby. Not in the. Mama got a little church I could join. But I didn't go yet. Man got a mosque I could join. But I didn't go yet. Cool with the devil on my back. I'm in cold sweats. Bout to do some dirt. In some dirty black old sweats. If you known you shoulda shown the way. Mosta the hood bout to get blown away. [Akon]. Cause I was raised up to show no fear. Cowardly hearts'll never last long here. If you ain't man enough to make shit clear. Guaranteed you'll get blown away. Cause I done seen the block break down tears. And I done seen the cops break my peers. Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years. Tryin' not to get blown away. See I ain't never shot nobody. But I'm known for fightin'. So when I strike man. You'll think you been struck by lightning. Shouldn't have to prove myself by killin' a nigga. Even a child could figure out how to pull the trigga. Retaliation only takes anger mixed with passion. So you target in the distance and keep on blastin'. They say guns don't kill people, people do. So when you're hit man. You feel that shit the evils do. Can't see myself get beat down. My eyes swollen. Mom's cryin' they don't know what happened. My pride's stolen. If I ain't got my heat then I got a blade. That hit ya off. Cause I was raised up to show no fear. Cowardly hearts'll never last long here. If you ain't man enough to make shit clear. Guaranteed you'll get blown away. Cause I done seen the block break down tears. And I done seen the cops break my peers. Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years. Tryin' not to get blown away. Keep my eye out for jakes. Ears to the streets. Other eye out for snakes. And these scandalous freaks. If we ain't on good terms. Don't bother to speak. Don't smile and try to spark a convo with me. Same thing'll make ya laugh it'll make ya cry. This quiet nigga, he'll take ya life. Hate for it to be the world's sacrifice. If somebody else could travel. Through the tunnel of life. Cause I'm that type of guy I'll be there. When you're ridin'. But I'll stay to myself. So if you see me out there. with a bear we fightin'. Then nigga go help the bear. Cause I was raised up to show no fear. Cowardly hearts'll never last long here. If you ain't man enough to make shit clear. Guaranteed you'll get blown away. Cause I done seen the block break down tears. And I done seen the cops break my peers. Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years. Tryin' not to get blown away"

boss life,"[Snoop Dogg]. Some of 'em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block. Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop. But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't. That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life. So many niggaz wanna play but still got dues to pay. Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay. But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't. That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life. Now this is for the B's and the C's, and the D's and the H's. And the G's puttin work in overseas. At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed. Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me. Baby this is presidential really. A pocket full of women understanding how I'm living. Show them hoes how you winning. It's the beginning with the pearls you're given. The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon. But everyday like 50 say, it's +Many Men+. They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends. But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs. Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'ma have to let 'em go. You know how the Dogg roll.. don't get it twisted. 'Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit. A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin pimpish. And it's comin from the Beach where them niggaz is a beast. But I just listen, all that shit is in my past. I'm connected to the purse first nigga.. the ass last. From Long Beach to Venice is the premise. Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish. [Chorus: Akon]. See me man, I'm nothin like you. I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to. I'm leanin in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin. Me, I'm ridin by ya on the corner, block slangin. I'm livin that boss' life (life). The hoes come runnin when they see me comin. I'm livin that boss' life (life). You can have anything just don't fuck with my money (my money). [Snoop Dogg]. This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South. Khaki's and them Tim's and them niggaz with the platinum mouths. Thinkin that they blessed by the actions that be comin out. When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout. But trickin ain't the route (route), that's even if you got it. There's a method to you holdin it when they can't do without it. Just put the key up in it nigga if she 'bout it. You can have her and her partner, fuckin with it for a dolla. If she a balla, she gon' ride with a shot caller. Roll with the Bo$$ Dogg in the back of a blue Impala. And if she follow.. then she gon' swallow. All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow. But I would never bother breakin out (Tha Doggfather). 'Less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin diamonds on his collar. I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners. Walkin on the blue carpet with the Doctor (Doctor). [Chorus: Akon]. See me man, I'm nothin like you. I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to. I'm leanin in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin. Me, I'm ridin by ya on the corner, block slangin.

celebrity,"[lloyd banks]. I just touched down, ferrari to concrete. I ain't even home and they're talking about me. F-ck out my ear if you talking 'bout freedom n-gger. Free don't pay the bills im ballin' all out, b!. You rappers don't know me. Nah I ain't your homie. If your name aint em, ferrari or tony. I like my wheel chromey. My bentley my rolly. My magnum my forty. South jamaica shawty. These losses I took in the gut yo. The work's still here, I'm just cooking it up slow. Clear my mind, you whippin' the truck load. My pop dead, but he live through his son though. If rap aint work, I'll be pimpin' on some hoe. Still eating lobster and shrimp in the bungalow. I'm back like crack over the drumroll. You know, wherever I go the gun go. [akon - chorus]. We on the grind (hey) all the time (hey). Ain't bout to let a n-gga come and snatch mine. I keep a nine, you see the shine. I might just let your ass slide this time. While I get this paper, paper. While I get this paper, paper. Cause I'm a celebrity. (I don't need none of y'all). Ghetto celebrity. (keep your punk-ass awards). I'm a celebrity. (take your fake smile off). Ghetto celebrity. Aint nothing changed n-gger. [lloyd banks - verse 2]. The media will test ya, popularity is pressure. Porche panamera. Platinum hammer through the metal. Wreck the booth up, I'm too tough. That inner city grammer. Step your jewels up, they bruised up. I'll sparkle for the camera. Harsh reality's what (?) holding them back from opening. Verbal attack all over these n-ggas, push the herd to the back. I'm the kind that they pray on, spending half of their day on. Lay on, n-ggas for days, just shots spray on. My sound system knock and in pound tupac. 6-4 Jumping like the ground too hot. They spot me, they chase a n-gga down two blocks. Two shots in the air for n-ggas that aint here. Two tone, two door, grey top, roof floor. Green guap galore, in and out of new hall. That bright light you saw, was a paparazzi flash. I'm tryna snap a picture through your maserati glass. . [chorus]. [eminem]. ?there are enough insults in my head. To fill up a swear jar. And have it overflowing so dont get me going, don't dare start. You'll never see me again, amelia earhart. I'm poppin' a wheelie off to a really unfair start. I'm past grinding for me, guess I just be grounded up. Like ground round or a pound of chuck. Tightly wound as f-ck. Till the fire marshalls come shut. Fire marshall ground 'em up. I guess you should just shut the f-ck up. And stop f-cking around and duck. I aint playing this time, I told you I'm not down for blunts. To say I keep it 100 would probably sound redundant. Like calling a bitch a hoe, or asking a gal to suck. And blowing your d-ck cock. Is she up to scew and down to f-ck. It's a man's world and I'm trapped in a land of smut. With a thousand sluts wrapped with muzzles. Running through a house of muts. Otherwords I'm shutting up everyone one of you bitches mouth's up. And I'm watching my language if I tell you to kiss my f-cking butt. And aint sh-t changed, my sh-t still dont stink player. My farts may have become staler ever since I became a trailer park celebrity. Maybe my complexion became a little paler. Poster job for white trash, I'm a garbage pale kid sailor. Yeah, see me up all in your b-tch means I'ma rape her,. All I got for these hoes is d-ck duck tape and a stapler so b-tch you better look for table scraps to scrape her. I don't subscribe to the news or the free press but homie I get the paper!"

ghetto (unnoficial remix feat. 2pac & biggie),"Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin. I know how it feel to wake up fucked up. Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell. People look at you like youse the user. Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser. But they don't know about your stress-filled day. Baby on the way mad bills to pay. That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce. And wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, sshit. I remember I was just like you. Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's. Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G. I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me. She was forced to kick me out, no doubt. Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South. Packed up my tools for my raw power move. Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves. For chumps tryin to stop my flow. And what they don't know will show on the autopsy. Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick. Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it. Smoking mad Newports cause I'm due in court. For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York. Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man. You better have your gat in hand, cause man. Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin. Our lifestyles be close captioned. Addicted to fatal attractions. Pictures of actions be played back. In the midst of mashin'. No fairy tales for this young black male. Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales. Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture. Or the repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures. Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches. Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures. Why shed tears? Save your sympathy. My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary. Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe. If you believe then you can achieve. Just look at me. Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on. Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on. To all the seeds that follow me. Protect your essence. Born with less, but you still precious. Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin. Gun shots every night in the (ghetto). Crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto). Every day is a fight in the (ghetto). (oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto). Got kids to feed in the (ghetto).

With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects. They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs. And when he start to bust he like to ask, ""Who's next? "". At last, I'm literally loungin black.

i am not my hair,"I Am Not my Hair (ft. India Arie). Akon. [Akon: Verse 1]. Konvict. Konvict Music uh huh. See I can kind of recall a lil ways back. Small tryin to ball always been black. And my hair I tried it all I even went flat. Had a gummy curled on top and all that crap (o oh). Just tryin to be appreciated. Nappy headed brothers never had no ladies. Never hit the barber shop real quick. Had a mini lil twist and it drove her crazy (crazy). Then I couldnt get no job. Cuz corporate wouldn't hire no dreadlocks. Then I thought about my dogs on the block. Kinda understand why they chose to steal and rob. Was it the hair that got me this far?. All these girls these cribs these cars?. I hate to say it but it seem so flawed. Success didnt come til I cut it all off. [India.Arie: Verse 1]. Little girl with the press and curl. Age eight I got a Jheri curl. Thirteen and I got a relaxer. I was a source of so much laughter. At fifteen when it all broke off. Eighteen and I went all natural. February two thousand and two. I went on and did. What I had to do. Because it was time to change my life. To become the women that I am inside. Ninety-seven dreadlocks all gone. I looked in the mirror. For the first time and saw that HEY,. [Chorus]. I am not my hair. I am not this skin. I am not your expectations no no. I am not my hair. I am not this skin. I am a soul that lives within. [India.Arie: Verse 2].

Or get in on lock. Like Bob Marley. You can rock it straight. Like Oprah Winfrey. If it's not what's on your head. It's what's underneath and say HEY,. [Chorus]. [Akon: Verse 2]. Who cares if you don't like that. With nothin to lose postin with the wave cap. And the cops want to harass because I got waves. Ain't see nothin like that in all my days (o oh). And you gotta change all this feelings. They be judging one another by their appearance. Yes India, i feel ya girl. Now go 'head talk to the rest of the world because,. . [Bridge]. (Whoa, whoa, whoa). Does the way I wear my hair make me a better person?. (Whoa, whoa, whoa). Does the way I wear my hair make me a better friend? Oooh. (Whoa, whoa, whoa). Does the way I wear my hair determine my integrity?. (Whoa, whoa, whoa). I am expressing my creativity,. (Whoa, whoa, whoa). [India.Arie: Verse 3]. Breast Cancer and Chemotherapy.

i just had sex,"(Andy Samberg). Sometimes (Oh-oh-ohhh). Something beautiful happens in this world (Akon!). You don't know how to express yourself, so (And Lonely Island!). You just gotta sing. (Akon). I just had sex (Ay). And it felt so good (Felt so good). A woman let me put my penis inside of her (Her). I just had see-eeay-ee-ex. And I'll never go back (Never go back). To the not-havin'-sex ways of the past. (Samberg). Have you ever had sex? I have, it felt great (Yeah). It felt so good when I did it with my penis (Yeah). A girl let me do it, it literally just happened. Having sex should make a nice man out the meanest. (Jorma Taccone). Never guess where I just came from, I had sex. If I had to describe the feelin', it was the best. When I had the sex, man, my penis felt great. And I called my parents right after I was done. (Samberg). Oh, hey, didn't see you there, guess what I just did?. Had sex, undressed, saw her boobies and the rest. (Was sure nice of her to let you do that thing). Nice of any girl ever (Now sing). I just had sex (Ay). And it felt so good (Felt so good). A woman let me put my penis inside of her (Her). I wanna tell the world. To be honest, I'm surprised she even wanted me to do it. (Doesn't really make sense) But man, screw it. (I ain't one to argue with a good thing) She could be my wife!. (That good?) The best thirty seconds of my life. I'm so humbled by a girl's ability to let me do her. Cause honestly, I'd have sex with a pile of manure. With that in mind, a soft, nice-smellin' girl's better. Plus she let me wear my chain. And my turtleneck sweaters. So this one's dedicated to them girls. That let us flop around on top of them. If you're near or far, whether short or tall. We wanna thank you all for lettin' us fuck you. She kept lookin' at her watch (Doesn't matter, had sex!). But I cried the whole time (Doesn't matter, had sex!). I think she might've been a racist (Doesn't matter, had sex!). She put a bag on my head (Still counts!). I just had sex (Ay). And my dreams came true. (Dreams came true). So if you had sex in the last thirty minutes. Then you qualified to sing with me. I just had se-eeee-ex (Everybody sing!). And it felt so good (We all had sex! ). A woman let me put my penis inside of her. I just had se-ay-eeee-ex (I just had sex). And I'll never go back (Never go back). To the not-havin'-seeex ways of the past"

But until then, I'll be posted up right here rain, sleet, hail, snow (hail snow). But until then, I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough (gettin' dough). [verse 1]. First, let me explain that I'm just a black man,. And I come from the darkside, so I'm havin a hard time stayin on track man,. My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin yet.

Tryna get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track. And I keep runnin away the ones that say they love me the most. How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close? And uh,. I just don't know but I be out here fightin demons and. It's like the curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland and. Lord, would you help me? And stop this pain.

jumping the broom,"[Verse 1]. A part of me knows, a part of me knows. A part of me don't want nothing you're not a part of. No way that I, would wish to die.

As jumping the broom, jumping the broom. You'd jump for me and I'd jump for you. Jumping the broom, jumping the broom. Nothing my love wouldn't do for you. [Verse 2].

They say they want that hot shhhh, say no more. Had to walk around the block, couldn't take no more!. Like escaper from the rock, couldn't wait no more. Sean Con cocked penis mightier than the sword. So I'm sleeping with the whores while I file for divorce. Plain and simple and in short, when it rains, man, it pours. Stepping in manure, second sippin in the moor. Quickest leopard gets the boar, secret weapons win the war. Guessed, but I'm pretty sure that I'm destined to endure. Flesh into the core, Pauly D to Pauly Shore. World of cyborgs and tours of cyberspace. What's behind the door, the allure something strange?. Of course, this is why I came, the forces are untamed. No corporate or dumb fame, I'll record for chump change. Course is unphased, contorted or concave. I'm sort of a poor sport, nothing short of Liu Kang. Got me feeling like. [Hook: Akon]. I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes. My scars and my stripes, You know I will survive. The strength that I find when I dig down deep inside. Got me still in this fight, and I'll be the last man standing!. Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!. Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!. [Verse 2: Asher Roth]. I tried conversing with God, but only hearing myself. I be throwing up a lot but I ain't here for my health. When I'm feeling like blah, I had to loosen my belt. Ate the corn right off the cob, didn't need no help. So, now I've come to realize I'm on my own for real. So most of em I approach em with a Slomin's Shield. Keep my enemies close cause they prone to steal. When friends become foes know you're doing it well. Just keep it going. I'm a red pill taker, who's my real maker?. Group homes and tombstones to feel safer. Loopholes for new souls, lets keep praying. Too grown to complain, I create the lane I stay in. Forever underrated, so now I'm Nicholas Cage-ing it. Doing all about anything as long as you put my face in it. Face it, I didn't want to be famous, but that's the way it is. Way I play the game, it's no wonder the brother made it like. [Hook]"

live by the gun,You live by the gun die by the gun. Ain't nowhere to hide nowhere to run. From de rom pa-pa-pom-pom pack a A-K. In the heart of the slums that's where we stay. I know this lil nigga man he only 5'3. Napoleon complex that's what I see. He pack a 4-5 when he walking through the streets. So even in the winter time the nigga got heat ya feel me. He never knew his pops. His momma tryna raise him but his daddy is the block. Thug life tat so they call him lil pac. He hustle in the trap so he really hates cops ya feel me. He only 16 really too young to even know what life mean. Knuckle head nigga think he know everything. He headed to the grave. or he heading to the bing believe me. Screaming crime don't stop. he either gonna rap play ball or sling rock. Once he making money he don't really give a fuck. Live fast die young ball until his times up ya see me. So now ya can't run away ain't got no protection. You brought this on yourself this is the end of the road. Ain't shit you can say you just gotta take it. You live by the gun die by the gun. Ya kinda had that coming. He was born with drugs up in his veins. Because his momma was addicted to cocaine. A beast on the court but that was about to change. Once he made a couple dollars from a dice game. Moved out his house now he lives in the fast lane. Thinks that he's grown you can't tell him a damn thing. Get it all on his own so he crowned himself king. Try take it from him he let 8 shots sing straight up. Having shoot outs with the police. It happens when you're raised in the belly of the beast. A chip on his shoulder claiming that he run the streets. A real life D-bo if you got it he want piece. But it's only a matter of damn time. Before he's laid out with his mom crying. Hooked up to a respirator while the doctor trying. To bring him back. but the clock's stopped and homie done ran outta time. So now ya can't run away ain't got no protection. You brought this on yourself this is the end of the road. Ain't shit you can say you just gotta take it. You live by the gun die by the gun. Ya kinda had that coming

pray for kaya,"(verse 1). As far girls go, she was my bestfriend.. I go to pick her up, but she aint dressed yet.. I told her that ive cancelled, so she aint cripped yet.. Just so I could suprise her, never forget get.. Three days before it happened, we were in the west end.. We were about to catch a movie, after we just ate.. See we would talk for hours, was like we just met.. We had a thing before, but now were just friends.. I told her everything, she showed me everything.. She told me anything, I would give anything.. Just to see her smile at me, or just to see her smile at me.. Wake up from her sleep so an. I expect to see her whine at me.. Because I wasnt there, to tell her not to go.. Into the car that day, and end up on the road.. When that car would crash, but she never lost her soul.. Shes in a coma hanging on, but she dosent wana go.. Because shes a star out here, and yeah shes on her own.. Everybody's praying for her, she aint on her own.. I just wished that I coulda called her on her phone that day,. And told her not to go that day.. I just wana know why,. God would make em when. e knew that he would take em young.. Poor girls,. One died on the scene and her name was patience.. And the rest of them were patience,. had everybody pasin up and down. The hospital halls and praying. and saying god dont take em please.. (chourus). I dont wana leave,but they wont let me stay.. I wish I had the powers, to take the pain away.. Wipe away the tears, and take the rain away. Gona be together forever, so I get down and pray.. I dont wana leave, but they wont let me stay.. I wish I had the powers, to take the pain away.. Wipe away the tears, and take the rain away.. Wana be together forever, so I get down and pray.. (verse 2). The next day a second girl passes away and her.. Face is pasted all over the myspace to make it worse.. I didnt know her but I know her name was d crystal.. I know your family miss you, and I cant say the words.. To describe this whole scenario, have to say it hurts.. Its an understatment, yeah. I'm tryna pray but wil the prayers work.. Because we prayed for puff, but god still took him.. But ama keep on praying, because gods still looking.. And kaya's still sleeping, I wana wake her up.. But gods still peeping, he wants to take her up.. One of the few girls I know, that really aint curupt.. She called herself the king of clubs,. I call her the queen of hearts.. Tryna reassure her friends,. but deep inside my heart would race.. I wana ask her sister questions. or even look her farther in the face.. Because I knew there could be news. that would be hard to take.. After days of hanging on, sadly kaya passed away.. (chourus). I dont wana leave,but they wont let me stay.. I wish I had the powers, to take the pain away.. Wipe away the tears, and take the rain away. Wana be together forever, so I get down and pray.. I dont wana leave, but they wont let me stay.. I wish I had the powers, to take the pain away.. Wipe away the tears, and take the rain away.. Wana be together forever, so I get down and pray.. (verse 3). If you've got abit of fire in you.. Listen, it means uve got abit of kaya in you.. U need to use it to search for something higher in you.. And you need to realise theres something higher then you.. If you aim for the stars, and start admiring you.. And lifes to short, to live without the fighter in you.. Prayers moves mountains, so hold up your hands.. Praying could change your life, but not go to plan.. (chourus). I dont wana leave,but they wont let me stay.. I wish I had the powers, to take the pain away.. Wipe away the tears, and take the rain away. Gona be together forever, so I get down and pray.. I dont wana leave, but they wont let me stay.. I really wana breath but anyday could be the day.. Because when its time to go, its your time to go.. So live your life like you know get on your knees and pray."

should i move?,"Decisions. This was the hardest day of my life. Should I stay or should I go?. Help me, Lord, to decide. Three blocks from home. When she caught my eye. I shouldn't even be looking. But she just had to be mine. Ten bedrooms, ten baths. 7, 000 square feet. I was week in the knees. She was the house of my dreams. I had just moved in. To the place down the block. And now I'm thinking 'bout moving?. Imagine my shock. I talked to my real estate guy, Peter. He was like. Your house is beautiful, yo. How could you leave her?. 6, 000 square feet. A dolphin-themed pool. If I'm being honest, Connor, yo. I think you're a fool. But it's cool. You can definitely afford both places. Tell me what to do, God. My heart's torn in pieces. So many options. And all in my price range. This decision is torture. My head's playing mind games. Should I move? (Should I move y'all?). Tell me should I buy this new place? (Tell me should I buy it?). Should I move y'all? (With my money). It'd be nice to have some more space (More space). So I turned to my friends. Playing out by the pool. As I sipped on my drink. I screamed what should I do?. They just shrugged. And I could tell that I was on my own. With this decision, no vision. Which house to call my home. I had to get away. So I flew to Majorca. Dove in the ocean. Went swimming with dorphins. I drank too many piña coladas. And fell asleep. Had a dream about both houses. And began to weep. Tell me how houses. Can one man own?. I'll be paying in cash. Got no need for a loan (but still). Should I move? (Should I move?). Tell me should I buy this new place? (I don't know what to do). Should I move y'all? (I think I should just buy it). It'd be nice to have some more space (I think I'm gon' buy it). So much pain, so many struggles. But I made it through. I bought the house, it's beautiful. And I kept the old one for my dogs. Sometimes it just works out (Shit works out). Peace. Oh, and now I own two houses, oh"

snitch,"[Akon]. Convict Convict. [Eminem]. YEAHHH (YEAHHH). HAHA (HAHA). SHADY (SHADY). [Akon]. Convict Music. [Eminem]. GUESS WHO'S BACK. [Obie Trice]. Still here haters. [Akon]. Akon and Obie... *Trice*. Yeaah. [Obie Trice]. Whatchu gonna do with it A?. Whatchu gonna do?. [Akon]. Take 'em on back to the street. [Chrous: Akon]. I keep the 40 cal on my side. Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster. You see a nigga pass by. Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya. Got glocks for sale, red tops for sale. Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you. Just don't, whatever you do, snitch. Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah. . [Verse 1: Obie Trice]. It's risky, the bitch tenderize outta nigger. His history's snitch, who decided he's a member?. Once he got pitched, coincided with law. Same homie say he lay it down for the bar. Brought gang squad around Oz. How could it be?. Been homies since superman draws. Only phoniness never came to par. He had us, a true neighborhood actor. Had his back with day's, now we see through him like X-Rays. Cuffed in that Adam car, no matter his loss. We at 'em, it's war. Knowin not to cross those reservoir dogs. You help to plant seeds, just to be a vegetable?. When we invest in team, its to the death for sho'. No X and O's, tex calicos. Aim at your chest nigga. [Chorus: Akon]. I keep the 40 cal on my side. Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster. You see a nigga pass by. Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya. Got glocks for sale, redtops for sale. Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you. Just dont, whatever you do, snitch. Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah. [Verse 2: Obie Trice]. We started out as a crew, when one speak, it's all honest. Private conferences when we eat, benihana's. Recondences when we peep enemies on us. Been in these corners. Sellin' like anything on us. Knowing heaven'll shun us being devil's miners. But that ain't got shit to do with the tea in China. We gon' keep the grind up till death can find us. Mean time, leanin in them European whips reclined up. It's eye for an eye for the riders. We ain't trying to get locked up, we Soul Survivors. Po Po's is cowards, its no you, its ours. We vow this, mixing yayo with soda powder. Who woulda known he would fold and cower. Once the captain showed, he sold whole McDonalds. No X and O's, tex calicos. Aim at your chest nigga. [Chorus: Akon]. I keep the 40 cal on my side. Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster. You see a nigga pass by. Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya. Got glocks for sale, red tops for sale. Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you. Just dont, whatever you do, snitch. Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah. [Verse 3: Obie Trice]. Nowadays, Sammy the Bull's, got the game full. So he moved to a rural area to keep cool. They snitchin on the snitch now, it's nothing to tell. Nowadays your circle should be small as hell. Ain't tryin to meet new faces, this don't interest me. Even if we bubble slow, we get it eventually. No penitentiary, there'll be no clemency. You will meet the lord snitchin, given us a century. These cats is rats now, the streets need decon. Thats how they react now, weak, when the heat's on them. Stop snitchen, you asked for the life you live in. It's act is not permitted, no where on the map. It is forbidden to send a nigga to prison. If you've been in it along with 'em. And then snitchen become hidden. So it's no X and O's, this is how it goes. aim at your chest nigga. [Chorus: Akon]. I keep the 40 cal on my side. Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster. You see a nigga pass by. Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya. Got glocks for sale, drop tops for sale. Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you. Just dont, whatever you do, snitch. Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah. [Obie Trice]. You rat bastard! (bastard)"

You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day. Stay down stay down just to live a better way. Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day. Stay down stay down just to live a better way. [Flashy Verse 1]. How many blacks gotta die by the hands of another. Don't you understand that man's the same color so that man is your brother. That's what happens when that man is from the gutter. And that man is a hustler trying to survive, moving grams of that butter. See, his momma was a dope fiend, poppa was a rolling stone. He never knew what family was he grew up in a broken home. Ever since twelve years old he was known as grown. 'cause ever since twelve years old he was on his own. And even though it seemed like school was the best. plan. His only choice was distributing the rock like. Def-jam. While everybody else was getting diplomas. He graduated from the middle of the strip to the. corner. But I don't knock him cause he tryin to bubble. There's no food on the table, the rents past due and that's why he hustles. And I ain't sayin that it`s right to be dealin`. All I'm sayin is I feel him I guess. I just see eye 2 eye wit his struggle you know. [Akon]. How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets. How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat. You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day. Stay down stay down just to live a better way. Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day. Stay down stay down just to live a better way. [Flashy Verse 2]. Now baby girl's got a promising future. But her mom`s passed away while she was younger and her father's a loser. He'd always abused her but what else you expect from a coward. He wasn't even proud when she got accepted to Howard. And even though she loves college everyday it would stress her. But it wasn't cause of exams or she hate her. professor. It was her financial situation here she couldn't pay a semester. And the only means of making it better was totally. reversing the role. Lap dancing working that pole even though deep down it`s hurting her soul. And even if it meant taking off her clothes. She was down for what ever to help her accomplish her personal goals. And I ain't trippin off a-how shortie livin. She gotta pay her tuiton put food in the kitchen and that's why she strippin. And I ain't sayin I agree with her job but shit times is hard. I guess I just see eye to eye with her vision you. know. [Akon]. How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets. How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat. You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day. Stay down stay down just to live a better way. Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day. Stay down stay down just to live a better way. [Flashy Verse 3]. Now see the moral of the story is this. If you ain't tryin to help stop our troubles then. don't knock our hustle. `Cause really at the end of the day it`s not ya'll. struggle. But you always got something to say. Well hear this fuck you. Yeah that's right I'm talking to you come try to sleep in our beds. Eat off our plates, take a walk in our shoes. Look at the world from our view try to live by our. rules. Drink the same water we do, put your kids in our. schools. I guarantee you won't maintain your health you'll. probably try to end it all. And hang yourself or bang yourself. You couldn't possibly understand all pain we felt. And without folding your hands play the games we. dealt. I'm being real I ain't tryin to be evil. Look how we live, look how ya'll live. C'mon be serious how is we equal. Matter fact I feel I'm wasting my time. I'm finished writing this rhyme. Ya'll never gonna see eye to eye with my people you know. [Akon]. How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets. How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat. You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day. Stay down stay down just to live a better way. Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day. Stay down stay down just to live a better way (Repeat 2X)"

Cuz I was lost and couldn't find a way.... and now I look forward to every day....(welcome to my sunny day).... Block don't stop always stayed hot.... No matter how the seasons got... I still remember when they took me away..... Kept it on lock. then I got caught. then I realized that I had to stop.... Then I took the time to explore a better way.... Searched high and low, so close, yet so far to go.... I just know, there`s a sunny day. Who'd ever thought that I would see this day..... Where I would see my ghetto life fade away.... `Cos I was lost and couldn't find a way.... And now I look forward to every day..... Welcome to my sunny day.... My sunny day.... Everyday..... A better day.... Welcome to my sunny day.... My sunny day..... Every day.... A better day.... Welcome to my sunny day.... Been a long day.... On my way to my holy place to pray.... Give thanks for every blessing given to me.... I know there`s more to see... more to me.... no more living in misery.... `Cos this is how I visioned life to beee...... Searched high and low, so close, yet so far to go.... I just know, there`s a sunny day. Who'd ever thought that I would see this day..... Where I would see my ghetto life fade away.... `Cos I was lost and couldn't find a way.... and now I look forward to every day..... Welcome to my sunny day.... My sunny day.... Everyday..... A better day.... Welcome to my sunny day.... My sunny day..... Every day.... A better day.... Welcome to my sunny day..."

For triple times the money and spending it like they wanna. They got they mind on they money, money on they mind. They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines. See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind. And ain't nobody takin from us, and that's the bottom line. But I know, there's a drop in the block. You move slow, you getting pressure from cops. You don't know, not to lay low. Because 25 to life's no joke. To all my real gorillas thuggin. On top of corners every day strugglin. All the beautiful women gettin money. Washin' them dollar bills like laundry. [Chorus: (Akon) ] (x2). Cos I'ma tell you like Wu told me. Cash rules everything around me. Singin dollar dollar bill y all (dollar, dollar bill y all). Singin dollar dollar bill y all (dollar, dollar bill y all). [Bridge: (Wyclef Jean) ]. Money, money-money-money. Money, money-money-money.

She wears a dress to the T like the letter. And if you make it rain she will be under the weather. She used to run track back in high school. Now she tricks off the track right by school. She takes a loss cos she don't wanna see her child lose. So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used. And then she runs to the pastor. And he tells her there will be a new chapter. But she feels no different after. And then she asks him (where my money at?). [Chorus: (Akon) ] (x2). Cos I'ma tell you like Wu told me. Cash rules everything around me.

time is money,"[Intro - Big Meech]. This Big Meech from the richest black. muthafucking gang in the world. My nigga always say,. there's only two things a nigga can do for you. You either got time or money, can't have em both. Nigga with money, don't have no time. Nigga with time, don't have no money. We don't have a lot of time around here cause time is money. [Verse 1 - Akon]. Give me one minute, cause you tripping. Too much time on your hands, you slipping. Why you focused on all this dealing?. When niggas coming in through the back door stealing?. Crib on the hill: now that's good living. Harder to reach when you make your first million. So much money gotta stack to the ceiling. And I'mma keep doing this forever, God-willing. Real niggas like me don't catch feelings. Only broke niggas be out there grilling. Say you getting money but you ain't even tipping. A big-booty girl in front of you dipping. Fronting like you really doing all that shipping. Man you gotta be, gotta be kidding. Don't even try cause my weapon is hidden. My nigga is ready to do some killing. [Hook - Akon]. I'mma tell you just one time: give me what's mine. Cause I don't have time to waste. I'll be on my grind, money on my mind. And I won't stop getting paid. Living this life of mine. I don't know if you really got what it takes. Hustling's in my blood and it just won't go away. Time, money, time, money. Nigga with money, don't have no time. Nigga with time, don't have no money. [Verse 2 - Akon]. Akon live in one year, made millions. Everybody got money: nigga, we chillin. Ain't got no time: it's some bad feelings. Especially when you want a little sexual healing. Girlfriend's pulling, family's pulling. In every direction, everybody need money. My lifestyle redefine how they all living. If I keep it up I'll be broke in a minute. My kinfolk's on the block and they dealing. All my goons are still out there killing. Man I be running, got no time to be skipping. Trying to hit a home run in the 9th inning. Meech locked up, copped out, for a killing. Taking care of mine, San Quen chilling. That's my homie, you can trust that nigga. Just a matter of time before I get back with him. [Hook - Akon]. I'mma tell you just one time: give me what's mine. Cause I don't have time to waste. I'll be on my grind, money on my mind. And I don't stop getting paid. Living this life of mine. I don't really know if you really got what it takes. Hustling's in my blood and it just won't go away. Time, money, time, money. Nigga with money, don't have no time. Nigga with time, don't have no money. [Verse 3 - Akon]. Gotta look out for haters if you wanna be blockin'. Look out for stick up kids that be robbin'. Look out for ladies with their hands in your pocket. If you don't, you'll be the next hot topic. Don't wanna be the next one dropping. 6 feet deep like conans coffin. I'd rather see you out there flossing. Love to see another brother getting it poppin. Chase that paper, don't you wait up. Get your money nigga, fuck them haters. Everybody complain about your time. You ain't got none? Find a way to make it up later. Cause I ain't got time for all that. And you ain't got time for all that. And I don't wanna waste your time. On behalf of BMF bring Meech back!. Time is money, time is money. Time is money, time is money. Time money, time money. time is money. Time money, time money. Nigga with money, don't have no time. Nigga with time, don't have no money. Nigga with money, don't have no time. Nigga with time, don't have no money"
tired of runnin',I'm sittin' on my porch watchin the law. As they ride past in their patrol cars. So tell me why I feel the enemy. They're supposed to be here protectin' me. I mighta went too far. Helpin' the contribute to makin' their job hard. Servin' fiends like these people ain't no enemy. I can't believe I'm out here killin' my community. If you knew how far I came. From where I am and where I used to be. Don't want it. You can tell by the look of me. This gangsta life ain't no longer in me. And I'm tired of the runnin. Tired of the runnin. Runnin from the law.

I know there's things I coulda done a lot better. Instead I'm in the streets tryin' to make that cheddar. Thinkin' in my mind you gonna be there forever. I know I coulda let it all go. Let it all go. But I was thinkin' it would make life better. Instead I'm sittin in this cell writin' this letter. Thought I wouldn't get caught cause I was way too clever. I learned there's no one to catch ya when ya fallin. And they'll be no one to hear ya when you're callin. Do you know what it's like to wake up in the mornin. While you're starvin you're hearin bugs crawlin'. Reminiscing on them days you was walkin. With pretty women on your arm. While you're starsick. Thankful that I didn't end up in a coffin. Somethin you see too often. I'm tired of the runnin. Tired of the runnin. Runnin from the law. Baby you gotta believe me. Said I'm tired of the runnin. Tired of the runnin. Tired of the runnin. Runnin from the law. Baby ya gotta believe me. Said I'm tired. So tired. Said I'm tired of the runnin. Tired of the runnin. Runnin from the law. Baby you gotta believe me. Said I'm tired of the runnin. Tired of the runnin. Tired of the runnin. Runnin from the law

Poppin, scrapes, scrapin, old school swanging, triple gold degons. Hustlers hustle gangsters banging. Whatch fo colour you wear and watch for u hangin. Whatch for you claiming its B's and C's. This is G's is more than palm trees and weed. Is more than movie stars and models. Is more than Holleywood Boulevard and Roscoes. More like east-side browns pat and vato. Take it up north to the bay when we ghosts ride out locs. Your boy flow colder Tahoe then Robie out Roscoes got a pacaralo. Side show 24's on this shure box. Gass stepped brake everybody shake it real lops. And give it up for Mac Dre and Pac. All eyez on that heify move me call it baywatch. And i'm youck hasselhoff the boss. 24's on the porsche yeah it cost a floss. Venn this bitch that you brought yeah sho toss the boss. Was the chicken straight without the sauce?. Take it off. [chorus]x2. Westside westside G's throw your setzi. And represent from felix midgeon tooky. To my dudes in the pen[itenciary] to my youngsters in groovy. Ice cubes on my neck pack a mac10 uzzy. Only pussy vertical high like AMG. Cause its funky enough like DOC. Young duzine like Eazy-E. And the whole Cali will love it like Tupac and Dre. Top dog like SN double O P. Daz and Kurupt raised gin like the DPG. I used to pack a hammer tricked crooked eye. y'all make me a rapper a hammer a crooked eye. I like my mommma new ports banging too shorts. Back in 86' when rappers all new born. Cool man spice one dangerous thing. Richie Rich for them boss. Niggaz slanging the cain. But on seat is like keep the sneak. We get that mailman like 40 bleed the streets. Out Cali... [chorus]x2. . REG IME LBC yeah that's me. I do been high since the day of dust shack. The hood done fashion bricks and big masters. Gone fresh coes got swagged your big dad. Gang bang started with the tribe to plee at. Kicked down at door ripped up the floor. First motherf**kers to rap for Sign Moore. Bow be back take a look and face it. The Julio Cezar chapped before this rap shit. To inverce with my toughts i'm a classic. All school rap daddy on your caskets. [chorus]x2"

when i get on,"|Verse 1|. Look, my gift (my gift), my curse (curse). Ima put it all out in one verse (yes). So ima start by asking niggas whats worse. Going to a 9 to 5, grindin 'till I eat dirt (never). You should know (know), what I do it for (for). 'Cause I don't ever wanna go back to being broke (no). I don't ever wanna go back to the 3rd floor. 08C, apartment 224. So I don't drink and I don't smoke. Don't get sleep, nah i just work. My and my brother, we've been doing this since knee-high. But ain't nobody checking for niggas in D.I. So we fly, I mean we flew. In to Georgia and we made plans too (what). Get heard (get heard), and be seen (seen). Put on for our city by any means (yes!). |Chorus|. Thinkin' about whats been going wrong. Wondering when my time's gonna come. I've payed the cost, and worked so hard. So I can't wait 'till I get on. When it's my turn to be the boss. Ima show these niggas who put me off. That I'm the don, the only one. So I can't wait 'till I get on. Ima lose my mind if I don't get on. That's why I grind 'till I get on. 'Cause I'm gon' shine when I get on. So I can't wait 'till I get on. Ima push these rides when I get on. Spit these lines when I get on. Ima be king when I get on. So I can't wait 'till I get on. |Verse 2|. How do I reign. In this over-saturated game. When everything I'm hearing is really sounding the same. If we lose you know who they gon' blame - us!. For not doing a song with T-Pain. Or even Akon or any big names. Spit it like Jeezy, Kanye or Lil' Wayne. And I'm a fan of 'em all. But the fact still remains - that I won't. 'Cause we tryna create our own lane. I swear to God that I will never change. I refuse to compromise and be a victim of the game. I speak it from the heart so the world can feel my pain. Told you I don't care about the fame. I'm like a new Jay-Z with a Virgin Island swag. And a A-Town bounce with my Virgin Islands flag. Pardon me if I brag but see we ain't never had. Wake the neighbors, tell them haters that we came to make you mad. And I've been. |Chorus|. Thinkin' about whats been going wrong. Wondering when my time's gonna come. I've payed the cost, and worked so hard. So I can't wait 'till I get on. When it's my turn to be the boss. Ima show these niggas who put me off. That I'm the don, the only one. So I can't wait 'till I get on. Ima lose my mind if I don't get on. That's why I grind 'till I get on. 'Cause I'm gon' shine when I get on. So I can't wait 'till I get on. Ima push these rides when I get on. Spit these lines when I get on. Ima be king when I get on. So I can't wait 'till I get on. |Bridge|. Feels like I'm gonna lose my mind. No matter what, we won't compromise. Ima rise from the bottom to the top one day. Swear that it never gon' stop, no way. And I don't care what these haters got to say. I knew that I was gonna make it there. |Chorus|. Thinkin' about whats been going wrong. Wondering when my time's gonna come. I've payed the cost, and worked so hard. So I can't wait 'till I get on. When it's my turn to be the boss. Ima show these niggas who put me off. That I'm the don, the only one. So I can't wait 'till I get on. Ima lose my mind if I don't get on. That's why I grind 'till I get on. 'Cause I'm gon' shine when I get on. So I can't wait 'till I get on. Ima push these rides when I get on. Spit these lines when I get on. Ima be king when I get on. So I can't wait 'till I get on. Ima lose my mind if I don't get on. Wondering when my time's gonna come. Wait 'till I get on. When it's my turn to be the boss. Ima be king when I get on. Wait 'till I get on"

y.o (youthful offerders),"[Chorus: Akon]. The mayor saying the crime slowed down. That explains why there's so many cops in my town. I done did so many years in the struggle man. Don't know how to live out the gutter man. Them youngins taking over the old land. And gang banging and moving down south to expand. See all them little kids packing muscle man. And they take it real serious when they hustle man. [Verse 1]. No father figure there so he been a bastard. Knee deep in the street even when its drastic. Them things come wrapped still neat in the plastic. All he doing is bringing heat to his demographic. Thank God the Ogs is holding him. Short fuse his complex Napoleon. You can try and talk to him but he ain't there. He done did a little bid so he ain't scared. Yeah but when he get to drinking that's when he gets to thinking. Bout them bitches got him tweakin' Baby mom's is tweaking. Hustle all week to get fresh on the weekend. Now he going off the deep in. [Chorus: Akon]. The mayor saying the crime slowed down. That explains why there's so many cops in my town. I done did so many years in the struggle man. Don't know how to live out the gutter man. Them youngins taking over the old land. And gang banging and mocing down south to expand. See all them little kids packing muscle man. And they take it real serious when they hustle man. [Verse 2]. Learned how to clap before he learned how to stack. Now he doing 30 something years in the max. With numbers like that it take years to relax. And its violent so its mandatory years on the back. Ruthless I'm just tryna tell you what the truth is. He ain't even want to hustle he just wanted to shoot shit. Get high, get some pussy, run around stupid. Really a good kid he just always wanted to do shit. Drop on the jux you can give him a quick call. But kicking it with him is like talking to a brick wall. Comes from a good fam so his books stay right. He only 23 he got a chance to see daylight. [Chorus: Akon]. The mayor saying the crime slowed down. That explains why there's so many cops in my town. I done did so many years in the struggle man. Don't know how to live out the gutter man. Them youngins taking over the old land. And gang banging and mocing down south to expand. See all them little kids packing muscle man. And they take it real serious when they hustle man. [Verse 3]. Don't be playing em close. Keep the work away from the guns. Keep the money away from them both. Keep it trill with your set. Make em feel your respect. No matter what you do never reveal your connect. Don't be running your mouth. You know what it is. If you ain't never tell it how would they know what you did. That thing on your waist got that thing out the lot. You still gotta eat dog if you banging or not. Frustration builds up then gotta release. When the crime slows down the dolla increase. Hundred grand in the duffel them younging will buss you. And they take it real serious when they hustle. [Chorus: Akon]. The mayor saying the crime slowed down. That explains why there's so many cops in my town. I done did so many years in the struggle man. Don't know how to live out the gutter man. Them youngins taking over the old land. And gang banging and mocing down south to expand. See all them little kids packing muscle man. And they take it real serious when they hustle man.

It Ain't my fault cause I, try to get away but trouble follows me,. And still I try so hard, hopin one day they'll come and rescue me,. But until then, I'll be posted up right here rain, sleet, hail, snow (hail snow). But until then, I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough (gettin' dough). [verse 1]. First, let me explain that I'm just a black man,. And I come from the darkside, so I'm havin a hard time stayin on track man,. My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin yet.

blood into gold,Akon. [Peter Buffett]. When I go to sleep at night. I wonder why I don't feel the pain. From where the sun is shining bright. But empty shells of lives remain. I know the news will tell me why. And we'll watch others take the fall. But who will hear when someone cries. That saving one can save us all. Can you open your heart?. Will you give me your hand?. Can you look in my eyes?. Will you see who I am?. The blood of your sons and. The blood of your daughters. The blood of my sisters. The blood of my brothers. The blood of your fathers. The blood of your mothers. All that you own through the blood of another. [Akon]. See when I go to sleep at night. Everything seems to fade away. If I live to see daylight. What part of life will I decide to change?. I see the sun.. Kind of reminds me of the gold that brightens our day. I see the rain. And also see all the blood that it washes away. The blood of your sons and. The blood of your daughters. The blood of my sisters. The blood of my brothers. The blood of your fathers. The blood of your mothers. All that you own through the blood of another. [Peter Buffett]. Now it's time to shine the light. In all the corners that we fear. We can win without a fight. But only love can take us there. Can you open your heart?. Will you give me your hand?. Can you look in my eyes?. Will you see who I am?. The blood of your sons and. The blood of your daughters. The blood of my sisters. The blood of my brothers. The blood of your fathers. The blood of your mothers. All that you own through the blood of another. The blood of your sons and. The blood of your daughters.

blown away,"[Akon]. Cheh. [Styles P]. This shit is crazy. Crazy. [Akon]. It's one of those things man. You gotta experience to know what I'm talkin' about. Ha ha. It's where the goin' get rough. [Styles P]. Akon. [Akon]. The tough stay tough. [Styles P]. Styles P. [Akon]. Up front. Let's go. Konvict. [Akon]. We in too deep to turn back now D. [Styles P]. Sure is. [Akon]. Watch yourself. Before you get. Blown away. [Styles P]. You know where I come from. The place where your fate is a mic. Or a bull or a dum dum. A jail cell a pine box. And brothers is dumb young. Young boys. Still bustin' guns for the slum. that they come from. Cops is the only ones they gon' run from. That's it. They puttin' they hood up. But 9 out of 10 of us ain't got good luck. You gon' ride on a man and catch 25. Or get hit and get sent to the other side. You lose both sides of the coin. So me I play the hood baby. Not in the. Mama got a little church I could join. But I didn't go yet. Man got a mosque I could join. But I didn't go yet. Cool with the devil on my back. I'm in cold sweats. Bout to do some dirt. In some dirty black old sweats. If you known you shoulda shown the way. Mosta the hood bout to get blown away. [Akon]. Cause I was raised up to show no fear. Cowardly hearts'll never last long here. If you ain't man enough to make shit clear. Guaranteed you'll get blown away. Cause I done seen the block break down tears. And I done seen the cops break my peers. Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years. Tryin' not to get blown away. See I ain't never shot nobody. But I'm known for fightin'. So when I strike man. You'll think you been struck by lightning. Shouldn't have to prove myself by killin' a nigga. Even a child could figure out how to pull the trigga. Retaliation only takes anger mixed with passion. So you target in the distance and keep on blastin'. They say guns don't kill people, people do. So when you're hit man. You feel that shit the evils do. Can't see myself get beat down. My eyes swollen. Mom's cryin' they don't know what happened. My pride's stolen. If I ain't got my heat then I got a blade. That hit ya off. Cause I was raised up to show no fear. Cowardly hearts'll never last long here. If you ain't man enough to make shit clear. Guaranteed you'll get blown away. Cause I done seen the block break down tears. And I done seen the cops break my peers. Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years. Tryin' not to get blown away. Keep my eye out for jakes. Ears to the streets. Other eye out for snakes. And these scandalous freaks. If we ain't on good terms. Don't bother to speak. Don't smile and try to spark a convo with me. Same thing'll make ya laugh it'll make ya cry. This quiet nigga, he'll take ya life. Hate for it to be the world's sacrifice. If somebody else could travel. Through the tunnel of life. Cause I'm that type of guy I'll be there. When you're ridin'. But I'll stay to myself. So if you see me out there. with a bear we fightin'. Then nigga go help the bear. Cause I was raised up to show no fear. Cowardly hearts'll never last long here. If you ain't man enough to make shit clear. Guaranteed you'll get blown away. Cause I done seen the block break down tears. And I done seen the cops break my peers. Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years. Tryin' not to get blown away"

boss life,"[Snoop Dogg]. Some of 'em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block. Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop. But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't. That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life. So many niggaz wanna play but still got dues to pay. Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay. But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't. That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life. Now this is for the B's and the C's, and the D's and the H's. And the G's puttin work in overseas. At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed. Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me. Baby this is presidential really. A pocket full of women understanding how I'm living. Show them hoes how you winning. It's the beginning with the pearls you're given. The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon. But everyday like 50 say, it's +Many Men+. They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends. But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs. Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'ma have to let 'em go. You know how the Dogg roll.. don't get it twisted. 'Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit. A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin pimpish. And it's comin from the Beach where them niggaz is a beast. But I just listen, all that shit is in my past. I'm connected to the purse first nigga.. the ass last. From Long Beach to Venice is the premise. Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish. [Chorus: Akon]. See me man, I'm nothin like you. I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to. I'm leanin in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin. Me, I'm ridin by ya on the corner, block slangin. I'm livin that boss' life (life). The hoes come runnin when they see me comin. I'm livin that boss' life (life). You can have anything just don't fuck with my money (my money). [Snoop Dogg]. This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South. Khaki's and them Tim's and them niggaz with the platinum mouths. Thinkin that they blessed by the actions that be comin out. When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout. But trickin ain't the route (route), that's even if you got it. There's a method to you holdin it when they can't do without it. Just put the key up in it nigga if she 'bout it. You can have her and her partner, fuckin with it for a dolla. If she a balla, she gon' ride with a shot caller. Roll with the Bo$$ Dogg in the back of a blue Impala. And if she follow.. then she gon' swallow. All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow. But I would never bother breakin out (Tha Doggfather). 'Less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin diamonds on his collar. I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners. Walkin on the blue carpet with the Doctor (Doctor). [Chorus: Akon]. See me man, I'm nothin like you. I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to. I'm leanin in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin. Me, I'm ridin by ya on the corner, block slangin.

celebrity,"[lloyd banks]. I just touched down, ferrari to concrete. I ain't even home and they're talking about me. F-ck out my ear if you talking 'bout freedom n-gger. Free don't pay the bills im ballin' all out, b!. You rappers don't know me. Nah I ain't your homie. If your name aint em, ferrari or tony. I like my wheel chromey. My bentley my rolly. My magnum my forty. South jamaica shawty. These losses I took in the gut yo. The work's still here, I'm just cooking it up slow. Clear my mind, you whippin' the truck load. My pop dead, but he live through his son though. If rap aint work, I'll be pimpin' on some hoe. Still eating lobster and shrimp in the bungalow. I'm back like crack over the drumroll. You know, wherever I go the gun go. [akon - chorus]. We on the grind (hey) all the time (hey). Ain't bout to let a n-gga come and snatch mine. I keep a nine, you see the shine. I might just let your ass slide this time. While I get this paper, paper. While I get this paper, paper. Cause I'm a celebrity. (I don't need none of y'all). Ghetto celebrity. (keep your punk-ass awards). I'm a celebrity. (take your fake smile off). Ghetto celebrity. Aint nothing changed n-gger. [lloyd banks - verse 2]. The media will test ya, popularity is pressure. Porche panamera. Platinum hammer through the metal. Wreck the booth up, I'm too tough. That inner city grammer. Step your jewels up, they bruised up. I'll sparkle for the camera. Harsh reality's what (?) holding them back from opening. Verbal attack all over these n-ggas, push the herd to the back. I'm the kind that they pray on, spending half of their day on. Lay on, n-ggas for days, just shots spray on. My sound system knock and in pound tupac. 6-4 Jumping like the ground too hot. They spot me, they chase a n-gga down two blocks. Two shots in the air for n-ggas that aint here. Two tone, two door, grey top, roof floor. Green guap galore, in and out of new hall. That bright light you saw, was a paparazzi flash. I'm tryna snap a picture through your maserati glass. . [chorus]. [eminem]. ?there are enough insults in my head. To fill up a swear jar. And have it overflowing so dont get me going, don't dare start. You'll never see me again, amelia earhart. I'm poppin' a wheelie off to a really unfair start. I'm past grinding for me, guess I just be grounded up. Like ground round or a pound of chuck. Tightly wound as f-ck. Till the fire marshalls come shut. Fire marshall ground 'em up. I guess you should just shut the f-ck up. And stop f-cking around and duck. I aint playing this time, I told you I'm not down for blunts. To say I keep it 100 would probably sound redundant. Like calling a bitch a hoe, or asking a gal to suck. And blowing your d-ck cock. Is she up to scew and down to f-ck. It's a man's world and I'm trapped in a land of smut. With a thousand sluts wrapped with muzzles. Running through a house of muts. Otherwords I'm shutting up everyone one of you bitches mouth's up. And I'm watching my language if I tell you to kiss my f-cking butt. And aint sh-t changed, my sh-t still dont stink player. My farts may have become staler ever since I became a trailer park celebrity. Maybe my complexion became a little paler. Poster job for white trash, I'm a garbage pale kid sailor. Yeah, see me up all in your b-tch means I'ma rape her,. All I got for these hoes is d-ck duck tape and a stapler so b-tch you better look for table scraps to scrape her. I don't subscribe to the news or the free press but homie I get the paper!"

ghetto (unnoficial remix feat. 2pac & biggie),"Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin. I know how it feel to wake up fucked up. Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell. People look at you like youse the user. Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser. But they don't know about your stress-filled day. Baby on the way mad bills to pay. That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce. And wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, sshit. I remember I was just like you. Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's. Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G. I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me. She was forced to kick me out, no doubt. Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South. Packed up my tools for my raw power move. Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves. For chumps tryin to stop my flow. And what they don't know will show on the autopsy. Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick. Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it. Smoking mad Newports cause I'm due in court. For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York. Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man. You better have your gat in hand, cause man. Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin. Our lifestyles be close captioned. Addicted to fatal attractions. Pictures of actions be played back. In the midst of mashin'. No fairy tales for this young black male. Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales. Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture. Or the repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures. Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches. Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures. Why shed tears? Save your sympathy. My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary. Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe. If you believe then you can achieve. Just look at me. Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on. Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on. To all the seeds that follow me. Protect your essence. Born with less, but you still precious. Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin. Gun shots every night in the (ghetto). Crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto). Every day is a fight in the (ghetto). (oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto). Got kids to feed in the (ghetto).

i am not my hair,"I Am Not my Hair (ft. India Arie). Akon. [Akon: Verse 1]. Konvict. Konvict Music uh huh. See I can kind of recall a lil ways back. Small tryin to ball always been black. And my hair I tried it all I even went flat. Had a gummy curled on top and all that crap (o oh). Just tryin to be appreciated. Nappy headed brothers never had no ladies. Never hit the barber shop real quick. Had a mini lil twist and it drove her crazy (crazy). Then I couldnt get no job. Cuz corporate wouldn't hire no dreadlocks. Then I thought about my dogs on the block. Kinda understand why they chose to steal and rob. Was it the hair that got me this far?. All these girls these cribs these cars?. I hate to say it but it seem so flawed. Success didnt come til I cut it all off. [India.Arie: Verse 1]. Little girl with the press and curl. Age eight I got a Jheri curl. Thirteen and I got a relaxer. I was a source of so much laughter. At fifteen when it all broke off. Eighteen and I went all natural. February two thousand and two. I went on and did. What I had to do. Because it was time to change my life. To become the women that I am inside. Ninety-seven dreadlocks all gone. I looked in the mirror. For the first time and saw that HEY,. [Chorus]. I am not my hair. I am not this skin. I am not your expectations no no. I am not my hair. I am not this skin. I am a soul that lives within. [India.Arie: Verse 2]. Good hair means curls and waves. Bad hair means you look like a slave. At the turn of the century. It's time for us to redefine who we be. You can shave it off. Like a South African beauty. Or get in on lock. Like Bob Marley. You can rock it straight. Like Oprah Winfrey. If it's not what's on your head. It's what's underneath and say HEY,. [Chorus]. [Akon: Verse 2]. Who cares if you don't like that. With nothin to lose postin with the wave cap. And the cops want to harass because I got waves. Ain't see nothin like that in all my days (o oh). And you gotta change all this feelings. They be judging one another by their appearance. Yes India, i feel ya girl. Now go 'head talk to the rest of the world because,. . [Bridge]. (Whoa, whoa, whoa). Does the way I wear my hair make me a better person?. (Whoa, whoa, whoa). Does the way I wear my hair make me a better friend? Oooh. (Whoa, whoa, whoa). Does the way I wear my hair determine my integrity?. (Whoa, whoa, whoa). I am expressing my creativity,. (Whoa, whoa, whoa). [India.Arie: Verse 3]. Breast Cancer and Chemotherapy. Took away her crown and glory. She promised God if she was to survive. She would enjoy everyday of her life ooh. On national television. Her diamond eyes are sparkling. Bald headed like a full moon shining. Singing out to the whole wide world like HEY,up by. Big Frog. [Chorus til fade]"

i just had sex,"(Andy Samberg). Sometimes (Oh-oh-ohhh). Something beautiful happens in this world (Akon!). You don't know how to express yourself, so (And Lonely Island!). You just gotta sing. (Akon). I just had sex (Ay). And it felt so good (Felt so good). A woman let me put my penis inside of her (Her). I just had see-eeay-ee-ex. And I'll never go back (Never go back). To the not-havin'-sex ways of the past. (Samberg). Have you ever had sex? I have, it felt great (Yeah). It felt so good when I did it with my penis (Yeah). A girl let me do it, it literally just happened. Having sex should make a nice man out the meanest. (Jorma Taccone). Never guess where I just came from, I had sex. If I had to describe the feelin', it was the best. When I had the sex, man, my penis felt great. And I called my parents right after I was done. (Samberg). Oh, hey, didn't see you there, guess what I just did?. Had sex, undressed, saw her boobies and the rest. (Was sure nice of her to let you do that thing). Nice of any girl ever (Now sing). I just had sex (Ay). And it felt so good (Felt so good). A woman let me put my penis inside of her (Her). I wanna tell the world. To be honest, I'm surprised she even wanted me to do it. (Doesn't really make sense) But man, screw it. (I ain't one to argue with a good thing) She could be my wife!. (That good?) The best thirty seconds of my life. I'm so humbled by a girl's ability to let me do her. Cause honestly, I'd have sex with a pile of manure. With that in mind, a soft, nice-smellin' girl's better. Plus she let me wear my chain. And my turtleneck sweaters. So this one's dedicated to them girls. That let us flop around on top of them. If you're near or far, whether short or tall. We wanna thank you all for lettin' us fuck you. She kept lookin' at her watch (Doesn't matter, had sex!). But I cried the whole time (Doesn't matter, had sex!). I think she might've been a racist (Doesn't matter, had sex!). She put a bag on my head (Still counts!). I just had sex (Ay). And my dreams came true. (Dreams came true). So if you had sex in the last thirty minutes. Then you qualified to sing with me. I just had se-eeee-ex (Everybody sing!). And it felt so good (We all had sex! ). A woman let me put my penis inside of her. I just had se-ay-eeee-ex (I just had sex). And I'll never go back (Never go back). To the not-havin'-seeex ways of the past"

Creator took me by the hand and led the way-ay. to make the story short thats why I'm here today. {Chorus}. What about that day you said I would not ----. And about that day you kicked me out onto the bricks. What about that time you said I wouldnt make a dime. And about that time you said I couldn't make you mine. Destination to the bank overseas. Where Akons treated like royalty. Cause there's so much in this world i have to see-e. The ? is rolling so jump in a follow me-e. {Breakdown}. Born and raised in Africa trying to make a scene.

Holla at me cuz I got it all day. No need to fly to Jamaica. Quarter ganja, we can get the same thing. You want that bom bom biggy, holla at my niggi right here in LA. Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. [Nate Dogg]. Hold up, wait a minute. Let me put some kush up in it. Hold up, wait a minute. Let me put some kush up in it. [Snoop Dogg]. Still I am. Tighter than the pants on Will.I.Am. Backthrow, back still, I have a pound in my backpack. Next to where the swishas at, smokin' presidential. Got some bubba, I give ya that. Need it for my cataracts.

last man standing,"[Intro: Akon]. Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!. Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!. Akon and Asher Roth. [Verse 1: Asher Roth]. They say they want that hot shhhh, say no more. Had to walk around the block, couldn't take no more!. Like escaper from the rock, couldn't wait no more. Sean Con cocked penis mightier than the sword. So I'm sleeping with the whores while I file for divorce. Plain and simple and in short, when it rains, man, it pours. Stepping in manure, second sippin in the moor. Quickest leopard gets the boar, secret weapons win the war. Guessed, but I'm pretty sure that I'm destined to endure. Flesh into the core, Pauly D to Pauly Shore. World of cyborgs and tours of cyberspace. What's behind the door, the allure something strange?. Of course, this is why I came, the forces are untamed. No corporate or dumb fame, I'll record for chump change. Course is unphased, contorted or concave. I'm sort of a poor sport, nothing short of Liu Kang. Got me feeling like. [Hook: Akon]. I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes. My scars and my stripes, You know I will survive. The strength that I find when I dig down deep inside. Got me still in this fight, and I'll be the last man standing!. Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!. Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!. [Verse 2: Asher Roth]. I tried conversing with God, but only hearing myself. I be throwing up a lot but I ain't here for my health. When I'm feeling like blah, I had to loosen my belt. Ate the corn right off the cob, didn't need no help. So, now I've come to realize I'm on my own for real. So most of em I approach em with a Slomin's Shield. Keep my enemies close cause they prone to steal. When friends become foes know you're doing it well. Just keep it going. I'm a red pill taker, who's my real maker?. Group homes and tombstones to feel safer. Loopholes for new souls, lets keep praying. Too grown to complain, I create the lane I stay in. Forever underrated, so now I'm Nicholas Cage-ing it. Doing all about anything as long as you put my face in it. Face it, I didn't want to be famous, but that's the way it is. Way I play the game, it's no wonder the brother made it like. [Hook]"

live by the gun,You live by the gun die by the gun. Ain't nowhere to hide nowhere to run. From de rom pa-pa-pom-pom pack a A-K. In the heart of the slums that's where we stay. I know this lil nigga man he only 5'3. Napoleon complex that's what I see. He pack a 4-5 when he walking through the streets. So even in the winter time the nigga got heat ya feel me. He never knew his pops. His momma tryna raise him but his daddy is the block. Thug life tat so they call him lil pac. He hustle in the trap so he really hates cops ya feel me. He only 16 really too young to even know what life mean. Knuckle head nigga think he know everything. He headed to the grave. or he heading to the bing believe me. Screaming crime don't stop. he either gonna rap play ball or sling rock. Once he making money he don't really give a fuck. Live fast die young ball until his times up ya see me. So now ya can't run away ain't got no protection. You brought this on yourself this is the end of the road. Ain't shit you can say you just gotta take it. You live by the gun die by the gun. Ya kinda had that coming. He was born with drugs up in his veins. Because his momma was addicted to cocaine. A beast on the court but that was about to change. Once he made a couple dollars from a dice game. Moved out his house now he lives in the fast lane. Thinks that he's grown you can't tell him a damn thing. Get it all on his own so he crowned himself king. Try take it from him he let 8 shots sing straight up. Having shoot outs with the police. It happens when you're raised in the belly of the beast. A chip on his shoulder claiming that he run the streets. A real life D-bo if you got it he want piece. But it's only a matter of damn time. Before he's laid out with his mom crying. Hooked up to a respirator while the doctor trying. To bring him back. but the clock's stopped and homie done ran outta time. So now ya can't run away ain't got no protection. You brought this on yourself this is the end of the road. Ain't shit you can say you just gotta take it. You live by the gun die by the gun. Ya kinda had that coming

long gone (ft. rock city),[Akon:]. I used to tell my homie. Slow down time after time. But he never would listen. Until he got some time. The life that he was living. I knew it wasn't right.

I told her man I love you, pulled her to the dance floor. And that's when she whispered, be careful what you ask for. I grabbed her by the waist and I sat her on the table. Explained how her heartburn she's giving me is painful. And now you wanna leave cause you feel empty inside. Well none of my friends trust me with you to drive. I'm so into you I hope you're feeling it. I need you in my life and the reason is. Chorus. How many times I gotta tell you why you stressing me for.

pray for kaya,"(verse 1). As far girls go, she was my bestfriend.. I go to pick her up, but she aint dressed yet.. I told her that ive cancelled, so she aint cripped yet.. Just so I could suprise her, never forget get.. Three days before it happened, we were in the west end.. We were about to catch a movie, after we just ate.. See we would talk for hours, was like we just met.. We had a thing before, but now were just friends.. I told her everything, she showed me everything.. She told me anything, I would give anything.. Just to see her smile at me, or just to see her smile at me.. Wake up from her sleep so an. I expect to see her whine at me.. Because I wasnt there, to tell her not to go.. Into the car that day, and end up on the road.. When that car would crash, but she never lost her soul.. Shes in a coma hanging on, but she dosent wana go.. Because shes a star out here, and yeah shes on her own.. Everybody's praying for her, she aint on her own.. I just wished that I coulda called her on her phone that day,. And told her not to go that day.. I just wana know why,. God would make em when. e knew that he would take em young.. Poor girls,. One died on the scene and her name was patience.. And the rest of them were patience,. had everybody pasin up and down. The hospital halls and praying. and saying god dont take em please.. (chourus). I dont wana leave,but they wont let me stay.. I wish I had the powers, to take the pain away.. Wipe away the tears, and take the rain away. Gona be together forever, so I get down and pray.. I dont wana leave, but they wont let me stay.. I wish I had the powers, to take the pain away.. Wipe away the tears, and take the rain away.. Wana be together forever, so I get down and pray.. (verse 2). The next day a second girl passes away and her.. Face is pasted all over the myspace to make it worse.. I didnt know her but I know her name was d crystal.. I know your family miss you, and I cant say the words.. To describe this whole scenario, have to say it hurts.. Its an understatment, yeah. I'm tryna pray but wil the prayers work.. Because we prayed for puff, but god still took him.. But ama keep on praying, because gods still looking.. And kaya's still sleeping, I wana wake her up.. But gods still peeping, he wants to take her up.. One of the few girls I know, that really aint curupt.. She called herself the king of clubs,. I call her the queen of hearts.. Tryna reassure her friends,. but deep inside my heart would race.. I wana ask her sister questions. or even look her farther in the face.. Because I knew there could be news. that would be hard to take.. After days of hanging on, sadly kaya passed away.. (chourus). I dont wana leave,but they wont let me stay.. I wish I had the powers, to take the pain away.. Wipe away the tears, and take the rain away. Wana be together forever, so I get down and pray.. I dont wana leave, but they wont let me stay.. I wish I had the powers, to take the pain away.. Wipe away the tears, and take the rain away.. Wana be together forever, so I get down and pray.. (verse 3). If you've got abit of fire in you.. Listen, it means uve got abit of kaya in you.. U need to use it to search for something higher in you.. And you need to realise theres something higher then you.. If you aim for the stars, and start admiring you.. And lifes to short, to live without the fighter in you.. Prayers moves mountains, so hold up your hands.. Praying could change your life, but not go to plan.. (chourus). I dont wana leave,but they wont let me stay.. I wish I had the powers, to take the pain away.. Wipe away the tears, and take the rain away. Gona be together forever, so I get down and pray.. I dont wana leave, but they wont let me stay.. I really wana breath but anyday could be the day.. Because when its time to go, its your time to go.. So live your life like you know get on your knees and pray."

ridin overseas,"'m looking in my rearview.... I can see a clearer view of you.. (Konvict, Kon...). (This is the remix!) I see you waiting, I know you hate it.... I see them watching, they waiting,. For an oppurtunity to ride up on me,. Hopin' they don't roll up on me, cuz today I'm ridin' dirty,. And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight!. I see them watching, and waiting,. For an oppurtunity to ride up on me,. Hopin' they don't roll up on me, cuz today I'm ridin' dirty, (Cheah!). And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight! (C'mon!). Chamillionaire:. I got twenty grand in my pocket and, I'm riding round with my pockets crammed,. You the one that got the contraband, you smokin' that like you in Amsterdam,. Before I know it, I see them sirens, I'm pullin' over, ""Hey, we just ridin'!"",. ""Don't talk back, won't be no violence, just shut up and sit in your seat in silence"",. Now the police is searching who, they searching me and then they searching you,. They smell the breeze and you smell like trees, cuz you hit the blunt, and you hit the purple too,. Now the lie is irreversible, cuz you just told them we was riding clean,. They question you but they ain't question me yet, I'm thinking the police ain't find a thing,. (Yup) Standing on the side of the freeway, wishing they would just hurry up,. And I can see him walkin' up to me like he about put me up in 'em cuffs,. I turn around and I look at you, and you turn away like you feelin' sick,. I'm going to jail for what I didn't commit, I must admit that I hate a snitch.... Akon:. I see them watching, they waiting,. For an oppurtunity to ride up on me,. Hopin' they don't roll up on me, cuz today I'm ridin' dirty,. And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight!. I see them watching, and waiting,.

Ever since they heard the song 'Ridin Dirty', the whole world been listening, I'm glad you heard me,. Some cops that representing the badge assure me, every cop ain't bad or tryna scare me,. A year later, after 'White 'n Nerdy', on the grind, still tryin', still flyin' birdies,. That stuff in your cuff still drivin' swervy, ridin' dirty like a vehicle inside the Derby,. A little inspired by UGK, and the rest inspired by the life I'm living,. Seen that Impala, he was drunk and that's when I saw the red lights go get him,. And it's ironic that during the chase, he murdered Chase, and this kid was Christian,. Movin' target went across the street and unfortunately the car didn't miss him,. And now the family is soon to know, that they gone have to do another funeral,. The angels ain't singing to your tune no more, don't move too fast, baby, move it slow.... Cuz one day in here, baby... Next thing you know,. Next thing you know, everything you used to move don't move no mo'!. I see them watching, they waiting,. For an oppurtunity to ride up on me,. Hopin' they don't roll up on me, cuz today I'm ridin' dirty,. And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight!. I see them watching, and waiting,. For an oppurtunity to ride up on me, (This is not a movie, it's real life!). Hopin' they don't roll up on me, cuz today I'm ridin' dirty,. And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight!. Chamillionaire:. It's real life... It ain't just a song, it's a message..... Nobody ever opens their eyes 'till someone gets killed.... Rest In Peace to Sean Bell..... Chamillïtary man!.

should i move?,"Decisions. This was the hardest day of my life. Should I stay or should I go?. Help me, Lord, to decide. Three blocks from home. When she caught my eye. I shouldn't even be looking. But she just had to be mine. Ten bedrooms, ten baths. 7, 000 square feet. I was week in the knees. She was the house of my dreams. I had just moved in. To the place down the block. And now I'm thinking 'bout moving?. Imagine my shock. I talked to my real estate guy, Peter. He was like. Your house is beautiful, yo. How could you leave her?. 6, 000 square feet. A dolphin-themed pool. If I'm being honest, Connor, yo. I think you're a fool. But it's cool. You can definitely afford both places. Tell me what to do, God. My heart's torn in pieces. So many options. And all in my price range. This decision is torture. My head's playing mind games. Should I move? (Should I move y'all?). Tell me should I buy this new place? (Tell me should I buy it?). Should I move y'all? (With my money). It'd be nice to have some more space (More space). So I turned to my friends. Playing out by the pool. As I sipped on my drink. I screamed what should I do?. They just shrugged. And I could tell that I was on my own. With this decision, no vision. Which house to call my home. I had to get away. So I flew to Majorca. Dove in the ocean. Went swimming with dorphins. I drank too many piña coladas. And fell asleep. Had a dream about both houses. And began to weep. Tell me how houses. Can one man own?. I'll be paying in cash. Got no need for a loan (but still). Should I move? (Should I move?). Tell me should I buy this new place? (I don't know what to do). Should I move y'all? (I think I should just buy it). It'd be nice to have some more space (I think I'm gon' buy it). So much pain, so many struggles. But I made it through. I bought the house, it's beautiful. And I kept the old one for my dogs. Sometimes it just works out (Shit works out). Peace. Oh, and now I own two houses, oh"

Akon and Obie... *Trice*. Yeaah. [Obie Trice]. Whatchu gonna do with it A?. Whatchu gonna do?. [Akon]. Take 'em on back to the street. [Chrous: Akon]. I keep the 40 cal on my side. Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster. You see a nigga pass by. Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya. Got glocks for sale, red tops for sale. Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you. Just don't, whatever you do, snitch. Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah. . [Verse 1: Obie Trice]. It's risky, the bitch tenderize outta nigger. His history's snitch, who decided he's a member?. Once he got pitched, coincided with law. Same homie say he lay it down for the bar. Brought gang squad around Oz. How could it be?. Been homies since superman draws. Only phoniness never came to par. He had us, a true neighborhood actor. Had his back with day's, now we see through him like X-Rays. Cuffed in that Adam car, no matter his loss. We at 'em, it's war. Knowin not to cross those reservoir dogs. You help to plant seeds, just to be a vegetable?. When we invest in team, its to the death for sho'. No X and O's, tex calicos. Aim at your chest nigga. [Chorus: Akon]. I keep the 40 cal on my side. Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster. You see a nigga pass by. Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya. Got glocks for sale, redtops for sale. Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you. Just dont, whatever you do, snitch. Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah. [Verse 2: Obie Trice]. We started out as a crew, when one speak, it's all honest. Private conferences when we eat, benihana's. Recondences when we peep enemies on us. Been in these corners. Sellin' like anything on us. Knowing heaven'll shun us being devil's miners. But that ain't got shit to do with the tea in China. We gon' keep the grind up till death can find us. Mean time, leanin in them European whips reclined up. It's eye for an eye for the riders. We ain't trying to get locked up, we Soul Survivors. Po Po's is cowards, its no you, its ours. We vow this, mixing yayo with soda powder. Who woulda known he would fold and cower. Once the captain showed, he sold whole McDonalds. No X and O's, tex calicos. Aim at your chest nigga. [Chorus: Akon]. I keep the 40 cal on my side. Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster. You see a nigga pass by. Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya. Got glocks for sale, red tops for sale. Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you. Just dont, whatever you do, snitch. Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah. [Verse 3: Obie Trice]. Nowadays, Sammy the Bull's, got the game full. So he moved to a rural area to keep cool. They snitchin on the snitch now, it's nothing to tell. Nowadays your circle should be small as hell. Ain't tryin to meet new faces, this don't interest me. Even if we bubble slow, we get it eventually. No penitentiary, there'll be no clemency. You will meet the lord snitchin, given us a century. These cats is rats now, the streets need decon. Thats how they react now, weak, when the heat's on them. Stop snitchen, you asked for the life you live in. It's act is not permitted, no where on the map. It is forbidden to send a nigga to prison. If you've been in it along with 'em. And then snitchen become hidden. So it's no X and O's, this is how it goes. aim at your chest nigga. [Chorus: Akon]. I keep the 40 cal on my side. Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster. You see a nigga pass by. Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya. Got glocks for sale, drop tops for sale. Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you. Just dont, whatever you do, snitch. Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah. [Obie Trice]. You rat bastard! (bastard)"

You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day. Stay down stay down just to live a better way. Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day. Stay down stay down just to live a better way. [Flashy Verse 1]. How many blacks gotta die by the hands of another. Don't you understand that man's the same color so that man is your brother. That's what happens when that man is from the gutter. And that man is a hustler trying to survive, moving grams of that butter. See, his momma was a dope fiend, poppa was a rolling stone. He never knew what family was he grew up in a broken home. Ever since twelve years old he was known as grown. 'cause ever since twelve years old he was on his own. And even though it seemed like school was the best. plan. His only choice was distributing the rock like. Def-jam. While everybody else was getting diplomas. He graduated from the middle of the strip to the. corner. But I don't knock him cause he tryin to bubble. There's no food on the table, the rents past due and that's why he hustles. And I ain't sayin that it`s right to be dealin`. All I'm sayin is I feel him I guess. I just see eye 2 eye wit his struggle you know. [Akon].

Now baby girl's got a promising future. But her mom`s passed away while she was younger and her father's a loser. He'd always abused her but what else you expect from a coward. He wasn't even proud when she got accepted to Howard. And even though she loves college everyday it would stress her. But it wasn't cause of exams or she hate her. professor. It was her financial situation here she couldn't pay a semester. And the only means of making it better was totally. reversing the role. Lap dancing working that pole even though deep down it`s hurting her soul. And even if it meant taking off her clothes. She was down for what ever to help her accomplish her personal goals. And I ain't trippin off a-how shortie livin. She gotta pay her tuiton put food in the kitchen and that's why she strippin. And I ain't sayin I agree with her job but shit times is hard. I guess I just see eye to eye with her vision you. know. [Akon]. How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets. How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat. You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day. Stay down stay down just to live a better way. Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day. Stay down stay down just to live a better way. [Flashy Verse 3]. Now see the moral of the story is this. If you ain't tryin to help stop our troubles then. don't knock our hustle. `Cause really at the end of the day it`s not ya'll. struggle. But you always got something to say. Well hear this fuck you. Yeah that's right I'm talking to you come try to sleep in our beds. Eat off our plates, take a walk in our shoes. Look at the world from our view try to live by our. rules. Drink the same water we do, put your kids in our. schools. I guarantee you won't maintain your health you'll. probably try to end it all. And hang yourself or bang yourself. You couldn't possibly understand all pain we felt. And without folding your hands play the games we. dealt. I'm being real I ain't tryin to be evil. Look how we live, look how ya'll live. C'mon be serious how is we equal. Matter fact I feel I'm wasting my time. I'm finished writing this rhyme. Ya'll never gonna see eye to eye with my people you know. [Akon]. How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets. How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat. You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day. Stay down stay down just to live a better way. Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day. Stay down stay down just to live a better way (Repeat 2X)"

time is money,"[Intro - Big Meech]. This Big Meech from the richest black. muthafucking gang in the world. My nigga always say,. there's only two things a nigga can do for you. You either got time or money, can't have em both. Nigga with money, don't have no time. Nigga with time, don't have no money. We don't have a lot of time around here cause time is money. [Verse 1 - Akon]. Give me one minute, cause you tripping. Too much time on your hands, you slipping. Why you focused on all this dealing?. When niggas coming in through the back door stealing?. Crib on the hill: now that's good living. Harder to reach when you make your first million. So much money gotta stack to the ceiling. And I'mma keep doing this forever, God-willing. Real niggas like me don't catch feelings. Only broke niggas be out there grilling. Say you getting money but you ain't even tipping. A big-booty girl in front of you dipping. Fronting like you really doing all that shipping. Man you gotta be, gotta be kidding. Don't even try cause my weapon is hidden. My nigga is ready to do some killing. [Hook - Akon]. I'mma tell you just one time: give me what's mine. Cause I don't have time to waste. I'll be on my grind, money on my mind. And I won't stop getting paid. Living this life of mine. I don't know if you really got what it takes. Hustling's in my blood and it just won't go away. Time, money, time, money. Nigga with money, don't have no time. Nigga with time, don't have no money. [Verse 2 - Akon]. Akon live in one year, made millions. Everybody got money: nigga, we chillin. Ain't got no time: it's some bad feelings. Especially when you want a little sexual healing. Girlfriend's pulling, family's pulling. In every direction, everybody need money. My lifestyle redefine how they all living. If I keep it up I'll be broke in a minute. My kinfolk's on the block and they dealing. All my goons are still out there killing. Man I be running, got no time to be skipping. Trying to hit a home run in the 9th inning. Meech locked up, copped out, for a killing. Taking care of mine, San Quen chilling. That's my homie, you can trust that nigga. Just a matter of time before I get back with him. [Hook - Akon]. I'mma tell you just one time: give me what's mine. Cause I don't have time to waste. I'll be on my grind, money on my mind. And I don't stop getting paid. Living this life of mine. I don't really know if you really got what it takes. Hustling's in my blood and it just won't go away. Time, money, time, money. Nigga with money, don't have no time. Nigga with time, don't have no money. [Verse 3 - Akon]. Gotta look out for haters if you wanna be blockin'. Look out for stick up kids that be robbin'. Look out for ladies with their hands in your pocket. If you don't, you'll be the next hot topic. Don't wanna be the next one dropping. 6 feet deep like conans coffin. I'd rather see you out there flossing. Love to see another brother getting it poppin. Chase that paper, don't you wait up. Get your money nigga, fuck them haters. Everybody complain about your time. You ain't got none? Find a way to make it up later. Cause I ain't got time for all that. And you ain't got time for all that. And I don't wanna waste your time. On behalf of BMF bring Meech back!. Time is money, time is money. Time is money, time is money. Time money, time money. time is money. Time money, time money. Nigga with money, don't have no time. Nigga with time, don't have no money.

But I was thinkin' it would make life better. Instead I'm sittin in this cell writin' this letter. Thought I wouldn't get caught cause I was way too clever. I learned there's no one to catch ya when ya fallin. And they'll be no one to hear ya when you're callin. Do you know what it's like to wake up in the mornin. While you're starvin you're hearin bugs crawlin'. Reminiscing on them days you was walkin. With pretty women on your arm. While you're starsick. Thankful that I didn't end up in a coffin. Somethin you see too often. I'm tired of the runnin. Tired of the runnin. Runnin from the law. Baby you gotta believe me. Said I'm tired of the runnin. Tired of the runnin. Tired of the runnin. Runnin from the law. Baby ya gotta believe me. Said I'm tired. So tired. Said I'm tired of the runnin. Tired of the runnin. Runnin from the law. Baby you gotta believe me. Said I'm tired of the runnin. Tired of the runnin. Tired of the runnin. Runnin from the law

Going to a 9 to 5, grindin 'till I eat dirt (never). You should know (know), what I do it for (for). 'Cause I don't ever wanna go back to being broke (no). I don't ever wanna go back to the 3rd floor. 08C, apartment 224. So I don't drink and I don't smoke. Don't get sleep, nah i just work. My and my brother, we've been doing this since knee-high. But ain't nobody checking for niggas in D.I. So we fly, I mean we flew. In to Georgia and we made plans too (what). Get heard (get heard), and be seen (seen). Put on for our city by any means (yes!). |Chorus|. Thinkin' about whats been going wrong. Wondering when my time's gonna come. I've payed the cost, and worked so hard. So I can't wait 'till I get on.

That's why I grind 'till I get on. 'Cause I'm gon' shine when I get on. So I can't wait 'till I get on. Ima push these rides when I get on. Spit these lines when I get on. Ima be king when I get on. So I can't wait 'till I get on. |Verse 2|. How do I reign. In this over-saturated game. When everything I'm hearing is really sounding the same. If we lose you know who they gon' blame - us!. For not doing a song with T-Pain. Or even Akon or any big names. Spit it like Jeezy, Kanye or Lil' Wayne. And I'm a fan of 'em all. But the fact still remains - that I won't. 'Cause we tryna create our own lane. I swear to God that I will never change. I refuse to compromise and be a victim of the game. I speak it from the heart so the world can feel my pain. Told you I don't care about the fame. I'm like a new Jay-Z with a Virgin Island swag. And a A-Town bounce with my Virgin Islands flag. Pardon me if I brag but see we ain't never had. Wake the neighbors, tell them haters that we came to make you mad. And I've been. |Chorus|. Thinkin' about whats been going wrong. Wondering when my time's gonna come. I've payed the cost, and worked so hard. So I can't wait 'till I get on. When it's my turn to be the boss. Ima show these niggas who put me off. That I'm the don, the only one. So I can't wait 'till I get on. Ima lose my mind if I don't get on. That's why I grind 'till I get on. 'Cause I'm gon' shine when I get on. So I can't wait 'till I get on. Ima push these rides when I get on. Spit these lines when I get on. Ima be king when I get on. So I can't wait 'till I get on. |Bridge|. Feels like I'm gonna lose my mind. No matter what, we won't compromise. Ima rise from the bottom to the top one day. Swear that it never gon' stop, no way. And I don't care what these haters got to say. I knew that I was gonna make it there. |Chorus|. Thinkin' about whats been going wrong. Wondering when my time's gonna come. I've payed the cost, and worked so hard. So I can't wait 'till I get on. When it's my turn to be the boss. Ima show these niggas who put me off. That I'm the don, the only one. So I can't wait 'till I get on. Ima lose my mind if I don't get on. That's why I grind 'till I get on. 'Cause I'm gon' shine when I get on. So I can't wait 'till I get on. Ima push these rides when I get on. Spit these lines when I get on. Ima be king when I get on. So I can't wait 'till I get on. Ima lose my mind if I don't get on. Wondering when my time's gonna come. Wait 'till I get on. When it's my turn to be the boss. Ima be king when I get on.

But the swagger so crazy. He ain't right for me still wanna be his lady. No he ain't right, but the one, that is just don't phase me. Why don't it phase me, why don't it phase me.. [Hook:]. Now do your thang girl~ and work it out, and work it out. Now do your thang girl~ and work it out, and work it out. Now do your thang girl~ and work it out, and work it out. Just do your thang girl~ now work it out, and work it out. [Keyshia Cole:]. I try to stay up, hes my wake up call. 4:30 in the morning, he didn't call me. Either way I'm feeling, try to fake it up. Cause I love how you touch me boy. Oooo~losing control and I'm waiting for. The next time you hold me close and tell me I'm beautiful. Just let me go, I can't let go. I know I'm outta my mind, cause I know that (he ain't right). [Chorus:]. I know he ain't right for me. But the swagger so (he just ain't right) crazy. He ain't right for me still wanna be his lady (yeeaaah). Though he ain't right, but the one, that is just don't phase me. (he just ain't right). Why don't it phase me, why don't it phase me.. [Hook:]. Now do your thang girl~ and work it out, (ooohhh) and work it out. Now do your thang girl~ and work it out, (work it out)and work it out. Now do your thang girl~ and work it out, (eh, eh, eh, eh) and work it out. Just do your thang girl~ now work it out, (WORK IT OUT)and work it out.

y.o (youthful offerders),"[Chorus: Akon]. The mayor saying the crime slowed down. That explains why there's so many cops in my town. I done did so many years in the struggle man. Don't know how to live out the gutter man. Them youngins taking over the old land. And gang banging and moving down south to expand. See all them little kids packing muscle man. And they take it real serious when they hustle man. [Verse 1]. No father figure there so he been a bastard. Knee deep in the street even when its drastic. Them things come wrapped still neat in the plastic. All he doing is bringing heat to his demographic. Thank God the Ogs is holding him. Short fuse his complex Napoleon. You can try and talk to him but he ain't there. He done did a little bid so he ain't scared. Yeah but when he get to drinking that's when he gets to thinking. Bout them bitches got him tweakin' Baby mom's is tweaking. Hustle all week to get fresh on the weekend. Now he going off the deep in. [Chorus: Akon]. The mayor saying the crime slowed down. That explains why there's so many cops in my town. I done did so many years in the struggle man. Don't know how to live out the gutter man. Them youngins taking over the old land. And gang banging and mocing down south to expand. See all them little kids packing muscle man. And they take it real serious when they hustle man. [Verse 2]. Learned how to clap before he learned how to stack. Now he doing 30 something years in the max. With numbers like that it take years to relax. And its violent so its mandatory years on the back. Ruthless I'm just tryna tell you what the truth is. He ain't even want to hustle he just wanted to shoot shit. Get high, get some pussy, run around stupid. Really a good kid he just always wanted to do shit. Drop on the jux you can give him a quick call. But kicking it with him is like talking to a brick wall. Comes from a good fam so his books stay right. He only 23 he got a chance to see daylight. [Chorus: Akon]. The mayor saying the crime slowed down. That explains why there's so many cops in my town. I done did so many years in the struggle man. Don't know how to live out the gutter man. Them youngins taking over the old land. And gang banging and mocing down south to expand. See all them little kids packing muscle man. And they take it real serious when they hustle man. [Verse 3]. Don't be playing em close. Keep the work away from the guns. Keep the money away from them both. Keep it trill with your set. Make em feel your respect. No matter what you do never reveal your connect. Don't be running your mouth. You know what it is. If you ain't never tell it how would they know what you did. That thing on your waist got that thing out the lot. You still gotta eat dog if you banging or not. Frustration builds up then gotta release. When the crime slows down the dolla increase. Hundred grand in the duffel them younging will buss you. And they take it real serious when they hustle. [Chorus: Akon]. The mayor saying the crime slowed down. That explains why there's so many cops in my town. I done did so many years in the struggle man. Don't know how to live out the gutter man. Them youngins taking over the old land. And gang banging and mocing down south to expand. See all them little kids packing muscle man. And they take it real serious when they hustle man. [Chorus: Akon]. The mayor saying the crime slowed down. That explains why there's so many cops in my town. I done did so many years in the struggle man. Don't know how to live out the gutter man. Them youngins taking over the old land. And gang banging and mocing down south to expand. See all them little kids packing muscle man. And they take it real serious when they hustle man"

you make it real,"So much craziness surrounding me. So much going on, it gets hard to breathe. All my faith has gone you bring it back to me. You make it real for me. Well I'm not sure of my priorities. I've lost sight of where I'm meant to be. and like holy water washing over me. you make it real for me. And I'm running to you baby. you are the only one who save me. that's why I've been missing you lately. 'Cause you make it real for me. When my head is strong but my heart is weak. I'm full of hurricanes and uncertainty. but I can find the words. you teach my heart to speak. you make it real for me yeah. And I'm running to you baby. you are the only one who save me. that's why i've been missing you lately. 'Cause you make it real for me. Everybody's talking in words. I don't understand. you got to be the only one. who knows just who I am. and you shine in the distance. I hope I can make it through. 'cause the only place. that I want to be. is right back home with you. I guess theres so much more. I have to learn. But if you're here with me. I know which way to turn. You always give me somewhere,. somewhere I can run. You make it real for me. And I'm running to you baby. Cause you are the only one who save me. That's why I've been missing you lately.
