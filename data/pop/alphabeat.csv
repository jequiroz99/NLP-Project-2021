younger than yesterday,"I don't know what to say, but we could run away from everything ‘round here.. We could jump on a plane and fall in love again,. With everything out there.. You get me high on this since we ran,. Now I know our future is.. You keep me low on stressing limits, girl,. I never ever thought life could be like this.. I really wanna get you away,. Baby, don't stop, it is hard to believe,. I'm younger than yesterday when I'm with you.. I don't know what to say, but if we run away. I won't speak, I'll like what you chose.. I will walk up the streets of every town. As long as you're around.. You get me high when miles are killer,. Keep it cool for what it is.. You pick me up when days are filler,. I never ever thought life could be like this.. I really wanna get you away,. Baby, don't stop, it is hard to believe,. I'm younger than yesterday when I'm with you.. I really wanna get you away,. Baby, don't stop, it is hard to believe,. I'm younger than yesterday when I'm with you.. We can do whatever and there is nothing we could lose,. Every night together and I don't even have to chose.. ‘cause my mind is always set on you.. We can go wherever and there is nothing we could lose,. Every night together and I don't even have to chose.. ‘cause my mind is always set on you. My mind is always set on you.. I really wanna get you away,. Baby, don't stop, it is hard to believe,. I'm younger than yesterday when I'm with you.. I really wanna get you away,. Baby, don't stop, it is hard to believe,. I'm younger than yesterday when I'm with you.. Really wanna get away.. I'm younger than yesterday when I'm with you."
