But I still know how to get wild. 'Cause I'm a grown-ass man. I'm a grown-ass man child, baby (Whoa oh oh oh oh). Child, mama (Whoa oh oh oh oh). I'm Peter Pan with a Cuban in my hand. I'm a grown-ass man child, mama (Whoa oh oh oh oh). I'll have a second bowl of Oreo a la mode. Watching my favorite show. rocking custom socks and boxers. Flash Pass at Six Flags, I'm a master Monopoly badass. Loser grows a mustache and must wear it to her parents. (No). I'm a grown-ass man child, baby (Whoa oh oh oh oh). Child, mama (Whoa oh oh oh oh). I'm Peter Pan with a Cuban in my hand. I'm a grown-ass man child, mama (Whoa oh oh oh oh). Child, baby (Whoa oh oh oh oh). Child, mama (Whoa oh oh oh oh). Belated kid in a Mercedes-Benz. I'm a grown-ass man child"
build me a girl,"(Verse 1). I was nearly a soul getting ready to go. Having one last talk with my maker. He said you’re going to earth for better or worse. We’ll see you back here sooner or later. So I said to him, as I spread my wings. Would you do one thing for me. (chorus). Would you build me a girl from all over the world. I promise I will always adore you. Made in Japan, with style of Milan and smile from California. Brazilian walk, head from New York, pretty Parisian curls. Build me a girl. Build me a girl. (Verse 2). Well the days went by. Wondering why, why it was I hadn’t found her. I was staring at eyes. Smiling at smiles. Still I was none the wiser. And you know I don’t. Don’t mean to impose. But I thought we had a deal. (chorus). (Bridge). So calling all woman who fit this description. If I’m what you’re missing. Then please just listen to the wind. The clouds they’re all screaming out, they’re trying to bring you to me. So please don’t shut them out. Because there is a lady who is made for me. Yes, there is a lady who has been made for me. (chorus) x2"
stepping stones,"I can't say that love is gone. Something still feels wrong. I find myself so far from you, oh. Foot in, one foot out. I chase my tail about. You analyse my every move, oh. See you don't need me now. I'll just slow you down. You can stand all on your own, oh. The love we shared was real. The secrets we revealed. I hope I was a stepping stone, oh.

There's so much more below. The surface we all search to find. The one's that help us grow. And you have done that much for me. And I hope I've been a stepping stone. Looking back on what was done. Sure, I hurt you some. Sure, you threw a few low blows, oh. But when the bruises heal. I'll take down my shield. And thank God above I know you. Because you are more yourself than when I met you. And I can say the same. I'm more myself than when I met you. And oh, I just want you to know. This is not a waste of time. There's so much more below. The surface we all search to find. The one's that help us grow. And you have done that much for me. So please I ask you don't. Toss the work we've done aside. Because we're letting go. This is just a piece of life. Focus on the whole. We have come so far. Well I hope you use my back to step across the pond. And I hope by pushing off me, you will land upon. The guy who's surely out there to whom you belong. Find him now. And oh, I just want you to know. This is not a waste of time. There's so much more below. The surface we all search to find. The one's that help us grow. And you have done that much for me. So please I ask you don't. Toss the work we've done aside. Because we're letting go. This is just a piece of life. Focus on the whole. We have come so far. Sing it out,. I needed, I needed.

slow,"A charcoal heart that you can't ignore. Cause you've been burned before. You tell me that everything that is good will end. You were building castles in the air. But they fell to the ground there was nothing there. You said you'd never get so close again. And lately, it's yellow lights and you're breaking. Say you just want to wait and see it all unfold. But baby when you find what you're seeking. Something you can believe in you just got to go. (chorus). So let's not take it slow. Let's not take it slow. I don't want to take it slow. Let's not take it slow. I don't want to rush your love. I can never get enough. I'm sitting outside your door. I give you everything you need. Sunshine, the world and all your dreams. So what are we waiting for. But lately, it's yellow lights and you're breaking. Say you just want to wait and see it all unfold. But baby when you find what you're seeking. Something you can believe in you just got to go. So let's not take it slow. Let's not take it slow. I don't want to take it slow. Let's not take it slow. Waiting for the perfect storm. We've been slowly chasing love. Now it's time to cross the line. And I want more. But lately, it's yellow lights and your breaking. Say you just want to wait and see it all unfold.

you should know better,"I'm on the phone, you turn your back on me. We're all alone, why is this happening. I never thought I would be questioning the one I, one I love. But here we are wrapped up in silence. Can we sound the alarm both so defiant and. Don't know where to start. I keep colliding with the one I, one I love. Don't make it so hard for me to stay. You should know better than that. Before you go on breaking my heart. And I fall even deeper in love. And my lungs screaming out can you hear me. You should know better than that. And here we are, here we are. If I could leave, I would be leaving. Cause I cannot believe what I am hearing. Tell me, how can it be. I'm second guessing on the one I, one I love. Don't make it so hard for me to stay. You should know better than that. Before you go on breaking my heart. And I fall even deeper in love. And my lungs screaming out can you hear me. You should know better than that. And here we are, here we are. Some forgive just to forget. I have not forgotten yet, I still believe in you. But there is a crack in our cement. This time it's permanent, permanent. You should know better than that. Before you go on breaking my heart. And I fall even deeper in love. And my lungs screaming out can you hear me. You should know better than that. And here we are, here we are"

biggest man in los angeles,"(Verse 1). I got my start on the street. With the monkey next to me he’ll. Shake your hand for a dollar,. If you’re nice kiss your cheek. To my left I can see. Chinese flipping bowls on their heads from their feet. Yo. Strolling on the scene. Are my arch-enemies. Break-dancers take your crowd, your girl, your money. Balloon man’s telling me to turn down please. And the psychic agrees. I begin to see that. Oh I’m home, I’m right where I belong. And there’s no where else that I’d rather be. (Chorus). Because those moments on the street. When crowd would rock with me. I felt like the biggest man, the biggest man in Los Angeles. You see all I really need. Are some ears to hear me dream. I feel like the biggest man, the biggest man in Los Angeles. Standing on the street, yeah. Just standing on the street. (Verse 2). Trombone cuts deep through the crowd doing Motown moves. With his hat tucked down. A belly dancer passes the tip jar around. And the men are confused, slightly aroused. Muslims, Christians preaching, wishing. I would shut up so the people could listen. Supposed to cut through all this noise. With my little voice, I begin to see that. Oh I’m home, I’m right where I belong. And there’s no where else that I’d rather be. (chorus). And the day goes dark. I pack my car. Stare out at the ocean. Take some time. A quiet smile. Let it all just soak in. (chorus) x2"

holding out,"When I met you love, I hadn't done the dirty yet. Call me the unicorn, they said that I didn't exist. Truth is my heart was torn, the v had a couple of rips.

Waiting for the right one and now I know. That I was holding out for you. Yeah I've been holding out for you. And the neighbors they are all haters cuz they say we go to loud. I've been holding out for you. And a couple times thought that I'd not make it. Laying on the bed, both of us half naked. But in the nick of time something in my heart said save it. Here we go again, another awkward conversation. A little bit of prayer a little bit of porn stars. Another night sleeping on my own. Waiting for the right one to come along. Waiting for the right one and now I know. That I was holding out for you. Yeah I've been holding out for you. And the neighbors they are all haters cuz they say we go to loud.

And my vocal tickle your ear. And you almost can feel me here. And my piano will kiss you slow tonight. As far as ladies go, baby you should know you're so patient. You're a thick skinned definition of low maintenance. But if enough time goes by, you can't help but dim your light. An empty house can make a cold heart feel so naked.

And my piano will kiss you slow tonight. And my vocals tickle your ear. And you almost can feel me here. And my piano will kiss you slow tonight. Yeah, let the the piano be your second home.

love love love (let you go),"(Verse 1). It’s like I’ve been feeling like a helium balloon. You know I’m always on the rise. Or is this love, love, love, love, love?. Dead winter but it feels like June. With a smile I can’t hide. Or is this love, love, love, love, love?. . No defenses I’m too deep for common sense. Well it’s love, love, love, love, love. Oh my I’m so delighted; I don’t try to even fight it. I think you should know that I will never let you go. (chorus). Oh I won’t, I won’t let you go. I won’t let you go. I won’t, I won’t let you go. I won’t let you go. I won’t let you go now. (Verse 2). I’ve been feeling like you’re swimming through my hair. You know you’re always on my mind. Or is this love, love, love, love, love?. Dead broke feeling like a millionaire. With a twinkle in my eye. Or is this love, love, love, love, love?. No defenses I’m too deep for common sense. Well it’s love, love, love, love, love. Oh my I’m so delighted; I don’t try to even fight it. I think you should know, that I will never let you go. (chorus). (Bridge). I’ve been sleeping on a cloud called number nine. Walking on the air and staring at the sky. I can’t remember ever feeling so alive. It’s like you brought me back to life. Well you turned on all the lights, somehow. No defenses I’m too deep for common sense. Well it’s love, love, love, love, love. (chorus) x2"
lunatic,"(Verse 1). I’ve got five bucks sitting at a coffee shop. I just wrote a lyric that made me stop. Think about the world and what I got. It’s a beautiful, beautiful day. I’ve got dreams for food and hope for drink. A new chance coming every time I blink. Sunset dripping off the thoughts I think. It’s a beautiful, beautiful day. And maybe I should care more about safety. But I can’t ignore or betray these voices singing. (chorus). You can do this, you can do this. You are not a lunatic. Crazy would be changing your mind. You can do this, you can do this. You are not a lunatic. Crazy would be leaving it behind. (Verse 2). I‘ve got five bucks waiting on a matinee. I love to see films in the middle of the day. Same movie seen a different way. I don’t think that makes me crazy. And I start work on the opposite side, of the clock. Tic tock clubs open at nine. I like to rock till the early daylight. Write music till five, this is my life. Maybe I should care more about safety. But I can’t ignore or betray these voices singing. (chorus). (Bridge). I will wiggle in a straight jacket forever. This is not some slight disease we can try and cure. This is one thing in my life that I know for sure. There is no turning back now. And maybe I should care more about safety. But I can’t ignore or betray these voices singing. (chorus)"
masterpiece,"Life is a canvas you paint in the mind. Colors dance, spill outside the lines. I refuse to settle, never the black and white. Rock the neons until the day I die. I'm on a constant search to make my heart swell. Bite off too much, chew like hell. Half my nights spent in a hotel. Price I paid to escape the conveyor belt. One, you get one heartbeat so, take it seriously. This is your masterpiece, don't forget to dream. And taste the colors in the air you breathe. It's your masterpiece, go ahead and feel it all. Don't stop till it is beautiful. Don't stop till it is beautiful. Don't stop till it is beautiful. Close my eyelids, take a deep breath. Feel the lightening down to my chest. I'm just a piece of art, and the paints fresh. Cuz I'm not yet finished yet. I've got a pregnant mind that wants to give birth. Breathe life into these big words. I can hear the universe in my ear. She whispers, you get one, one heartbeat so take it seriously. This is your masterpiece, don't forget to dream. And taste the colors in the air you breathe. It's your masterpiece, go ahead and feel it all. Don't stop till it is beautiful. Don't stop till it is beautiful. Don't stop till it is beautiful. And you can settle for a normal life. Said that your afraid of heights. But you were meant to light the sky. This is your masterpiece. Don't forget to breathe and taste the colors in the air you breathe. This is your masterpiece go ahead and feel it all. Don't stop till it is beautiful. Don't stop till it is beautiful. Don't stop till it is beautiful. Don't stop till it is beautiful"
