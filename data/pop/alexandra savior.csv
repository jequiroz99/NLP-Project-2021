cupid,Filled in the hole in the road. We were speaking in code. Stuck in fantasy mode. Whoever really liked. Coming back down to Earth. It's not that it hurt. It was just so much worse. With anyone but you. [Chorus]. Know a shortcut. A sure shot. I forgot. How it ought to feel. I don't know what to do. It's a whole lot. To hold back. You know that. Cupid shoots to kill. [Verse 2]. There's a mysterious force. It sinks in it's claws. Pulls me closer to yours. Some cosmic business. Illuminating allure. What are we waiting for. Never hated you more. Why does nobody but you. [Chorus]. Know a shortcut. A sure shot. I forgot. How it ought to feel. I don't know what to do. It's a whole lot. To hold back. You know that. Cupid shoots to kill. [Guitar solo]. [Chorus]. Know a shortcut. A sure shot. I forgot. How it ought to feel. I don't know what to do. It's a whole lot. To hold back. You know that. Cupid shoots to kill

girlie,"Hopelessly showbiz, so she is. She's got friends you haven't met, ]. they smoke menthol cigarettes. Bogus psychosis, she floats on in. and she ain't never anywhere. So you're lucky that she's here. Talk about Hollywood problems, she's got 'em. She's always looking for a wilder ride. And she'll be fuckin' with her phone all night. She calls me 'Girlie'. She gets in corners where water can't. Got that look upon her face,. says she's twenty minutes late. Her shit is sordid she's all for it. until her eyeballs start to bleed.

m.t.m.e,"Well it never was all that clear. Why you left me standing in the middle of horizon. Drank me down. No I never did completely know why you sunk down on my gas pedal. Always trying. To skip the town. Scribble down in pencil. 10 track souvenir. Audio memento. Music to my ears. No I never really understood how you do it like a stranger does. Send me flying every time. I never really wondered why I was just trying to pass some time. I ain't crying, I'm just fine. Scribble down in pencil. 10 track souvenir. Audio memento. Music to my ears. You questioned my credentials. You quoted Vladimir. You're Dario Argento. Music to my ears. Music to my ears. Music to my ears. Music to my ears. I never really wondered why. I was just trying to pass some time. I ain't crying, I'm just fine"
mirage,"Violet was tickling my fancy. Gives out just the right amount of soul. I wonder if it makes me sound too old. Decided that it's Stella or a Candy. Seems as if I'm spinning down a pole. Swept them over to the stack of no's. [Chours]. La-di-dah. I sing songs about. Whatever the fuck they want. Whatever the fuck they want. And ooh-eh-ooh. I'm so blue. Anna-Marie Mirage. Painting my tear drops on. And on, and on, and on. [Verse 2]. Staring through the window of a wig store. Crying through the credits of a show. That you've seen a bunch of times before. An inch away from settling on Coco. Shame that she's that girl you used to know. Loved her, but we had to let her go. [Chours]. La-di-dah. We sing songs about. Whatever the fuck they want. Whatever the fuck they want. And ooh-eh-ooh. We're so blue. Anna-Marie Mirage. Painting our tear drops on. And on, and on, and on. [Bridge]. Anna-Marie Mirage. Shooting a mood collage. Pi√±ata paper heart. I don't know where she starts. And I stop. [Verse 3]. Dress me like the front of a casino. Push me down another rabbit hole. Touch me like I'm gonna turn to gold. She's almost like a million other people. That you'll never really get to know. And it feels as if she's swallowing me whole. [Chours]. La-di-dah. We sing songs about. Whatever the fuck she wants. Whatever the fuck she wants. And ooh-eh-ooh. We're so blue. Anna-Marie Mirage. She's painting our tear drops on. And on, and on, and on"
mystery girl,"In my mind, I've acquired a tangle. I can't undo. I've been thinking about nothing else. Lately. Does it feel as if somebody's keeping an eye on you?. Peripheral vision. Playing tricks on you. Awooh. 'been meaning to say. I just wanna be where you are. Before you escape. Awooh. Hush now. Don't explain. Wound up with a heavy heart. From waiting in the rain. Pardon me, baby. But who's the mystery girl?. Don't you try to calm me down. Don't you try to calm me down. Pardon me, baby. But who's the mystery girl?. Mystery girl. Was it just you and her?. Did you go in the photo booth?. Was it loud?. Was it hot?. Was it lively enough. For you?. Is she likely to be there. If I were to show up soon?. The little suspicions. Clinging onto me. Awooh. 'been meaning to say. I just wanna be where you are. Before you escape. Awooh. Hush now. Don't explain. Wound up with a heavy heart. From waiting in the rain. Pardon me, baby. But who's the mystery girl?. Don't you try to calm me down. Don't you try to calm me down. Pardon me, baby. But who's the mystery girl?. Mystery girl. Awooh. OOhh. I know that we're growing apart. Because your planet precedes yourself. (Awooh...). I know that we're growing apart. Because your planet precedes yourself. Don't you try to calm me down!. Don't you try to calm me down!. Don't you try to calm me down!. Don't you try to calm me down!"
risk,"There's a color running through your blood. Such a hasty shade of blonde. You're that awful sort of dangerous. Kind that keeps me hanging on. Darkness does appear when. I can see the secrets hangin' 'round your neck. When we're shirtless, assessing the risk. Prick your finger on a kiss. Tell no one about it. They don't need to know. I'd chalk a line around it. If I could let you go. Keep me quiet, honey. And I promise to. Tell no one about you. Trap the passion, baby, lock the trunk. Catch the keys and hit the road. Went to sleep hungover, woke up drunk. Baby shake that aspirin snowglobe. Darkness does appear when. I'll present you with a temporary fix. My accomplice, this bottomless pit. It's 'bout as deep as it could get. Tell no one about it. They don't need to know. I'd chalk a line around it. If I could let you go. Keep me quiet, honey. And I promise to. Tell no one about you. The reflection. In the cold. You're on the run. Things got me wonderin'. How the sun came up before. Tell no one about it. They don't need to know. I'd chalk a line around it. If I could let you go. Keep me quiet, honey. And I promise to. Tell no one about you"
shades,"[Verse 1]. I left your house when you were sleeping. Hadn't correctly got my head screwed on. Tried to find a way to write a note. Couldn't get your shower to work. I sort of wish that it was raining. So that I could pull the hood up on my coat. I'm always happy to be leaving. Could be the company I'm keeping. [Bridge]. Like when you're looking for your shades. Riflin' through your pockets. And you find them on your face. [Chorus]. Ooh I can't escape it, abnormal behavior. Uncontrollably vapor. And on, 'bout some. Thing done. Sooner or later. This strange little arrangement. And all of its exchanges. Must cease. . [Verse 2]. Shouldn't have come back. Shouldn't have switched it on at all. Didn't mean to hold you so close. But you know how it goes. I sort of wish that it was sunset. I kind of wish that it was New Year's Day. On a vacant street. I cast a long-eyed shadow. [Bridge]. Like when you're looking for your shades. Rifling through your pockets. And you find them on your face. Walking around in a daze. I don't want to stop it. Baby let you trade. [Chorus]. Ooh I can't escape it. Abnormal behavior, uncontrollably vapor. And on about some. Thing done. Sooner or later. This strange little arrangement. And all of its exchanges. Must cease. . Not easy to see where to go. The misty middle twist and swallow. The curves are the only part. I know. And maybe takes a side of cool. Ooh. Awooh"
vanishing point,"Twisted on a dead straight road. Haven't got a change of clothes. We just split-- call me crazy. But I think they might be onto us. Everybody else can eat my dust. Shall we make believe they're chasing us?. Make a wish for me baby. 'Cause I think they might be catching up. You're a thousand times mine. I'm a thousand times yours. A thousand times mine. And I want a thousand more. Oh, until the vanishing point. And baby, not a moment before. You're a thousand times mine. And I am a thousand yours. As if the earth's reserved for you and I. Not a soul for miles on either side. We just slipped off the radar. And I think they might be onto us. You're a thousand times mine. I'm a thousand times yours. A thousand times mine. And I want a thousand more. Oh, until the vanishing point. And baby, not a moment before. You're a thousand times mine. And I am a thousand yours. A thousand yours. Spectacular blacklight poster neon sky. To which the sun so quickly unsubscribes. Want to call it a night. But I think they might be onto us. Oh, until the vanishing point. And baby, not a moment before. You're a thousand times mine. And I am a thousand yours. A thousand yours. A thousand yours"
