Please Mr DJ won't you turn the music down. Why can't you understand. I'm too hurt to dance tonight. I was setting looking silent. He said I stood out from the crowd. He offered me a friendly face. To wipe away my fright. But I won't talk to strangers. There words are all the same. So I drowned inside this drinking glass. To take away the pain. If they call it heartache. If they call it heartache. Why is the rest of my body aching?. Why is the rest of my body shaking?. Please Mr DJ won't you turn the music down. Why can't you understand. I'm too hurt to dance tonight. Please Mr DJ won't you turn the music down. Why can't you understand. I'm too hurt to dance tonight

And I'm scared. Coffee stains. On your favorite book. Remind me of you. So I can't even look. The magazines. You left on the floor. You won't need. Them anymore. A towel left. Hangin on the wall. No sign of wet foosteps. In the hall. There's no smell. Of your sweet cologne. I'm lying here alone. I'm scared. To face another day. 'Cause the fear in me. Just won't go away. In an instant.

The first cut is the deepest. Baby I know. The first cut is the deepest. 'Cause when it comes. To being lucky she's cursed. When it comes. To lovin' me she's worst. But when it comes. To being loved she's first. That's how I know. The first cut is the deepest. Baby I know. The first cut is the deepest"

too hurt to dance,I stood there in the shadows of a place we used to go. Drinking Cocktail after Cocktail. Wondering if you'd show. My head started spinning. My mouth was feeling dry. Lost inside the music. I was trying not to cry. If they call it heartache. If they call it heartache. Why is the rest of my body aching. Why is the rest of my body shaking. Please Mr DJ won't you turn the music down. Why can't you understand. I'm too hurt to dance tonight. I was setting looking silent. He said I stood out from the crowd. He offered me a friendly face. To wipe away my fright. But I won't talk to strangers. There words are all the same. So I drowned inside this drinking glass. To take away the pain. If they call it heartache. If they call it heartache. Why is the rest of my body aching?. Why is the rest of my body shaking?. Please Mr DJ won't you turn the music down. Why can't you understand. I'm too hurt to dance tonight. Please Mr DJ won't you turn the music down. Why can't you understand. I'm too hurt to dance tonight

whole lot of love,I feel frustrated all the time. Over and over. Bittersweet you and me. Ain't no ways to understand. Now I believe we'll make it to end. When you just couldn't feel. I negotiate. Between love and hate. And it wise up just the same. Try to understand it. Feel you could comprehend. And negotiate the bail. Took a lot of love to hate you. The way I do. Took a lot of love. Whole lot of love. Whole lot of love to hate you. The way I do. Whole lot of love. Whole lot of love. How to see regret in your eyes. Stone cold somber. Can't deny what you do to me. Hundred times I've asked of you to think of me. But what more could you do. You just couldn't hide the truth. I compromised. To get by. To survive. You won't see me right. I give it taste. Happy overstate. Sure I'm moving on. I'll be standing strong. Took a lot of love to hate you. The way I do. Took a lot of love. Whole lot of love. Whole lot of love to hate you. The way I do. Whole lot of love. Whole lot of love. Whole lot of love. Whole lot of love. Whole lot of love. Whole lot of love. Hear me. As I say. Took a whole lot of love. To feel this way. Understand that I tried. But he pushed all the love aside. It took a lot of love to hate you. The way I do. Took a lot of love. Whole lot of love. Whole lot of love to hate you. The way I do. Whole lot of love. Whole lot of love. I negotiate. Between love and hate. I negotiate. With a whole lot of love. I negotiate. Between love and hate. And it wise up just the same. Took a lot of love to hate you. The way I do. Took a lot of love. Whole lot of love. Whole lot of love to hate you. The way I do. Whole lot of love. Whole lot of love
