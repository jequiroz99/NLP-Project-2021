i'm on my way,"Two hearts beating as one. That's all I think about. Until my journey's done. Ten miles, ten miles away. That's all that's left to go. Until I see your face. Oh my love. She says to me.... Oh my love. I'm waitin' for you. (Chorus:). Hey I'm on my way. I guess you gotta. Feel the pain. Won't be late. To teach your soul. To pray. It's ok. Your tears are like. The rain. Let's get crazy. Come what may. Come on. I wanna love you. Baby gimme sexo.... Lover, the moment has come. I'll give it all to you until I come undone. Lover, I live for your touch. So many nights alone. I've missed your kiss soooo much. Oh my heart. Was hers to be. Oh my love. I'm livin' for you. (Chorus)"
if you ever saw her,"She's got the look in her eye. That says she knows why. Just to taste her is never enough. She gets a thrill outta lovin'. And watching you suffering. She says you can look but. you don't touch. So don't go fooling yourself. Like so many others. Who've fallen for only a smile. But if you're in for the ride. Hold on tight. Adiós, and kiss your heart goodbye. Chorus:. Oh and if you ever saw her. Well, she's every dream girl from. Monroe to Madonna. You'll swear she walks on water. She's so fine. Oh and if you ever kissed her. Well, tell you my friend you could. never resist her. And if you ever saw her, you'd know why. She holds your heart in your hand. She'll make you a man. But she'll play however she wants. Just when you think you are winning. Your head startsa a spinning. You open your eyes and she's gone. So, dont belive you're the one. Don't think that this dream is forever. It's only a game. But if you are in for the ride. Hold on tight. Adiós, and kiss your heart goodbye. Repeat Chorus. Know why, you'd know why. She's an atom bomb and she's wating. To blow you away. Away, you better run for cover and pray. Adiós, and kiss your heart goodbye. Repeat Chorus."
it's alright,"Dissipate your every move. I got nothing left to prove. Something, something I can't explain. Every time I look at you, I realize what I got to do. it's soothing and take you under the rain. And I feel so nice.... Crossing all the lines, taking any chance. Doing what we need to feel alive. . And I feel so right.... Come and do it now,we got to scream, scream all night. (Chorus). It's alright, don't be afraid don't hesitate now. Feels right, let's take it now don't wait for later. tonight, and if it feels right just let it go. And if it's alright you got to let it flow (2x). If I'm wrong don't want to know. If I'm right just let it show. It's crazy, so crazy it just might be. I only care about today,. tomorrow is too far away. Let's take it, and run run away with me. It feels so nice.... Crossing all the lines, taking any chance. Doing wat we need to feel alive. Yeah it feels so right..... Come and do it now, we got to scream, scream all night. (Chorus). I think I love you, and I need you by my side baby, to the morning light. I know I want you, what I got for you is love. I got love, love, love, love.... (Chorus). Don't be afraid don't hesitate now.

nobody wants to be lonely (feat. christina aguilera),"There you are. In a darkened room. And you're all alone. Looking out the window. Your heart is cold. And lost the will to love. Like a broken arrow. Here I stand in the shadows. Come to me. Come to me. Can't you see that. (Chorus:). Nobody wants to be lonely. Nobody wants to cry. My body's longing to hold you. So bad it hurts inside. Time is precious and it's. Slipping away. And I've been waitin' for you all of my life. Nobody wants to be lonely. So why. Why don't you let me love you. Can you hear my voice. Do you hear my song. It's a seranade. So your heart can find me. And suddenly you're. Flying down the stairs. Into my arms, baby. Before I start going crazy. Run to me. Run to me. Cause I'm dyin'. (chorus). I wanna feel you need me. Just like the air you're breathin'. I need you here in my life. Don't walk away. Don't walk away. Don't walk away. Walk away, no no no.

"oh, what a circus","Oh, what a circus. Oh, what a show. Argentina has gone to town. Over the death of an actress. Called eva peron. We've all gone crazy. Mourning all day and mourning all night. Falling over ourselves to get all. Of the misery right. Oh, what an exit. That's how to go. When they're bringing your curtain down. Demand to be buried like eva peron. It's quite a sunset and good for the country. In a roundabout way. We've made the front page of all. The world's papers today. But, who is this santa evita. Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow. What kind of goddess has lived among us. How will we ever get by without her?. She had her moments. She had some style. The best show in town was the crowd. Outside the casa rosada. Crying eva peron. But that's all gone now. As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears. We're all gonna see and how. She did nothing for years. [ensemble]. Salve regina mater misericordiae. Vita dulcedo et spes nostra. Salve salve regina. Ad te clamamus exules filii eva. Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes. O clemens, o pia. You let down your people evita. You were supposed to have been immortal. That's all they wanted, not much to ask for. But, in the end you could not deliver. Sing you fools but, you've got it wrong. Enjoy your prayers. Because you haven't got long. Your queen is dead, your king is through. She's not coming back to you. Show business kept us all alive. Since seventeen october 1945. But the story's gone. The glamour's worn thin. That's a pretty bad state. For a state to be in. Instead of government, we had a stage. Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage. Instead of help, we were given a crowd. She didn't say much but, she said it loud. And who am I who dares to keep. His head held high while millions weep?. Why the exception to the rule?. Opportunist, traitor, fool. Or just a man who grew and saw. From seventeen to twenty-four. His country bled, crucified. She's not the only one who's died. Sing you fools but, you've got it wrong. Enjoy your prayers. Because you haven't got long. Your queen is dead, your king is through. She's not coming back to you. [ensemble]. Salve regina mater misericordiae. Vita dulcedo et spes nostra. Salve salve regina peron. Ad te clemamus exules filii eva. Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes. O clemens o pia. [eva]. Don't cry for me, argentina. For I am ordinary unimportant. And undeserving of such attention. Unless we all are. I think we all are. Ride on my train oh, my people. And when it's your turn to die. You'll remember. They find those cannons sing lamentations. Not just for eva for argentina. Not just for eva for everybody. So share my glory, so share my coffin. So share my glory, so share my coffin. [che]. It's our funeral too. Now eva peron had every disadvantage. You need if you're gonna succeed. No money, no class, no father. No bright lights. There was nowhere she'd been. At the age of fifteen. As this tango singer found out. A tango singer. Augustine migaldi. Who has the distinction of being. The first man to be of use to eva duerte"

Wherever it may lead. Let your private emotion come to me. Let your private emotion come to me. Let your private emotion come to me. Come to me, come to me."

Relight my fire. Cos I need your love. Turn back the time till the days when our love was new, do you remember. No matter what was happenin I was there with you, aha.

Strong enough to walk on through the night. There's a new day on the other side. Cos I got hope in my soul. And I'll keep walking baby. Keep on walking baby."

Shine brighter than a rain of falling stars. Time stops to let our heartbeats synchronize. This endless night. There’s no goodbye. This moment will last forever. This moment will last forever. I know you would catch me. Should I fall from grace. If I heard you drowning in the dark. I'd dive into the waves. We can make a vow and seal it with a kiss. The moment that we share will matter. More than those we missed. Shine brighter than a rain of falling stars. Time stops to let our heartbeats synchronize. This endless night. There’s no goodbye. This moment will last forever. This moment will last forever. In another place. In another time. In another space. In another life. In another world. You would still be mine. We'll shine. We'll shine.

Don't you know that we are only human?. So be gentle and be kind. And be true to your own mind. I wonder what you want from me. You know it's all inside of you. Inside of you. Love and anger, trues and lies. It's the ups and downs, the wrongs, the right. Say your prayer, turn out the light. Everything that you've become. What turns you off, what turns you on. Who you are, where you're from. Sleep tight. Everything's exactly as it should be. So let go all of your fears. And hold on to what it's here. The universe is turning and the lessons you've been learning. They make you who you are. You've made it through this far. I wonder what you want to be. You know it's all inside of you. Inside of you. Love and anger, trues and lies. It's the ups and downs, the wrongs, the right. Say your prayer, turn out the light. Everything that you've become. What turns you off, what turns you on. Who you are, where you're from.... Whatever you do, whenever. You've got to trust yourself. You're holding it all together so long. People come and go but you will know yourself forever. I wonder what you want to be. You know it's all inside of you. Oh, inside of you. Love and anger, trues and lies. It's the ups and downs, the wrongs, the right. Say your prayer, turn out the light. Everything that you've become. What turns you off, what turns you on. Who you are, where you're from. Sleep tight. Love and end the truth of life. It's the ups and downs, the wrongs, the right (Sleep tight). Say your prayer, turn out the light. Everything that you've become. What turns you off, what turns you on (Sleep tight). Who you are, where you're from. Sleep tight. Turn off the light. And you'll be fine. And then, you'll smile. Everything that you've become. What turns you off, what turns you on. Who you are, where you're from. Sleep tight"
spanish eyes,I met a girl at the carneval. In Rio de Janeiro. We danced all night on the boulevard. In doorway we did the tango. I miss her lips. And the way she sashayed her hip. As she shook her sholders. I miss the smell of her hair. I don't care if it takes my whole life. to find her. CHORUS:. We were dancing in the summer rain. We were dancing through the night. She never said her real name. So I called her Spanish Eyes. Spanish Eyes. The sun came up. And the girl was gone. Her masqurade was over. I serched the streets. Drunk with love. But no one seemed to know her. I miss the touch. Of her body so much. I long for the warmth inside ger. Somewhere in time she will come. back to me. And I'll spend my whole life beside her. REPAT CHORUS.
stop time tonight,"I want to hide, in your eyes. Hold you tight, and wrap this night around me. I want to feel, to feel you breathe to be. To be where you are, where you are. To hold while you're sleeping. To be there while you're dreaming. (Chorus). I wish that we could stop time tonight. Stay in this moment forever. I wish that we could live in this kiss. And stay just like this. Together, together. I want to lay here with you. Kiss you slow and hold you close forever. I wan to reach, and feel you near, right here. Right here in my arms, in my arms. To hold you while you're sleeping. To be lost in this feeling. (Chorus). I just want to stay with you, for always, always. I don't want this night to end. To hold you while you're dreaming. (Chorus 2x). Stop time tonight. Stay just like this baby. together, together. Stop tome, tonight..."

the touch,"Oh, it's the middle of the night. And I'm reaching out for you. In the darkness. I can feel your touch break through. When I look into your eyes. And your skin is against my skin. I will hold you 'till the sun comes crashing in. Where would I be now. Without the tenderness that you possess. The touch... the touch that makes me strong. That keeps me holdin' on. I come to you when times are tough. Your love is just enough. To lift me up so high. There's nothing I won't give. To be with you, to reach for you. I live... for the touch. Oh, I wanna be the one you need. I need to be the one you see. I gotta justify the faith you have in me. You're the beauty in my life. You're the sun that lights my soul. You're the other half I need to make me whole. Who would I be now. Without the warmth you bring to everything. The touch... the touch that makes me strong. That keeps me holdin' on. I come to you when times are tough. Your love is just enough. To lift me up so high. There's nothin' I won't give. To be with you, to reach for you. I live... for the touch. All my life has been a journey, here to you. Every road and river. Brought me closer to the touch. The touch... the touch that makes me strong. That keeps me holdin' on. I come to you when times are tough. Your love is just enough. To lift me up so high. There's nothing I won't give. To be with you, to reach for you. I live... for the touch"

til i get to you,"I'm going to swim the mountains. I'm going to climb the sea. I'm going to surf the fields in front of me. I'm going to pass the buildings, that silver cage. Pass the smiling faces with the hidden rage. (Chorus). Til I find you, feel you, breathe you,. touch you, taste your truth.... And I... never going to stop til I get to you.

you stay with me,"Met you underneath the moon. Night was over much too soon. We shared a kiss till day light came. And kissed the night goodbye. When the sun came up that day. We smiled and went uor separate ways. But i can't leave the thought of you behind. CHORUS:. Oh, you stay with me you stay with me. Oh, in my heart and on my mind. Oh, like a melody that keeps haunting me. Oh, you stay. I look inside the small cafes. And hope by chance to see your face. I hear your voice and realize it's just a summer wind. Something in you eyes that night. Swept away this heart of mine. Now i just want you in my arms again. CHORUS:. Oh, you stay with me you stay with me. Oh, in my heart and on my mind. Oh, like a melody that keeps haunting me. Oh, you stay. . How was i to in that one night. My whole life would change. From the moment i looked in your eyes. I've never been the same. And if i could have one chance to have that moment back again. I'd never let it end I'd never let it end. Met you underneath the moon. Night was over much too soon. We shared a kiss till day light came. And kissed the night goodbye. When the sun came up that day. We smiled and went uor separate ways. But i can't leave the thought of you behind. CHORUS:. Oh, you stay with me you stay with me. Oh, in my heart and on my mind. Oh, like a melody that keeps haunting m. Oh, you stay."
