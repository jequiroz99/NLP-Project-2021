anxious,"Why are you staring at my face for so long?. Never thought home was a place, didn't belong. Want them close but push away it's just wrong. Man, what's wrong?. I'm wrong. Had me running from my dreams. Crazy folk do crazy things. When they think you cut the strings. I know you gonna leave me baby. (Don't leave me baby). They all just leave me baby. Please, don't leave, don't leave, don't. I know you gonna leave me baby. (Don't leave me baby). They all just leave me baby. Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave. I'm anxious. Don't leave, I'm anxious. Don't leave, I'm anxious. (I know you gon' leave me baby). Don't leave, don't leave. (They all just leave me, baby). Don't leave. Please don't leave. It's frustrating that my mind never feels clear. I believed in carrying pain all my years. Prisoner of my fears. Drown myself in my tears. Sometimes I want to abandon myself. I'm still running from my dreams. Burning down all of my trees. Then wonder why I can't breathe. And that's why. You call me running from my dreams. Still learning what they all mean. Still learning what they all mean. I know you gonna leave me baby (baby). (Don't leave me baby). They all just leave me baby (baby). Please don't leave, don't leave, don't. I know you gonna leave me baby (baby). (Don't leave me baby). They all just leave me baby (please). Don't leave, don't leave. I'm anxious. Don't leave, I'm anxious. Don't leave, I'm anxious. (I know you gon' leave me baby). Don't leave, don't leave. (They all just leave me, baby). Don't leave. Please don't leave"
cops,"I called the cops. I called the cops on you. And then they put you. In the padded room. See there was a time. when you made my heart go boom. And they're only happy only a game or two. I try to surprise you romance you. And still couldn't get through to you. Drowning in the water feeling like. I'm in the deep blue sea. Hey, hey, the deep blue sea. Hey, hey, oh. Oho, you did a bad thing. Oho, you did a bad thing. You went, you went crazy baby. You did a bad thing. And I had to call them. to come save me baby. Shadows pave the street behind me. As I'm running through the wind. And I'm not sure which way I'm heading. Since you plunged into the deep end. Oho, you did a bad thing. Oho, you did a bad thing. You went, you went crazy baby. You did a bad thing. And I had to call them. to come save me baby. When you thought that I was cheating. I was being what you need then. And you say that was never enough. But I guess when you're crazy. it's never enough. Since you thought you could get violent. You're in a padded room of silence. And that's why I've called the cops yeah. Said that's why I've called the cops. I called the cops, I called the cops. I called the, I called the, I called the cops. I called the cops, I called the cops. I called the, I called the, I called the cops. Oho, you did a bad thing. Oho, you did a bad thing. You went, you went crazy baby"
ride off (feat. crystal caines),"[Verse 1: Tangina Stone]. Lady, I know you've been through many things. I mean lately, we've both been through many things. It's so crazy. Secretly cut each other deep. We're all masters with a scalpel. But blade runners on our feet. Who knew that the road would be paved with glass. Not wise to turn around and pursue the past. It took a while to convince me that your love would last. So insecure oh my. You know you could just fly or just. Ride off or run away. Ride off, ride off or run away. Ride off or run away. Ride off, ride off. Or run away. Ride off or run away. Ride off, ride off or run away. Run away. Away. [Verse 2: Tangina Stone]. No distance lovers. I know when your eyes glow. When you. You stand beside me. Never afraid to show. The lengths you'd go for me. That's why I'd die. I'd die. That's why I'd die. I'd die. One hundred deaths. before they'd ever take you from my side. You know I'd die. I'd die. Damn right, I'd die. I'd die. Take all my love, no pride. You know you could just fly or just. Ride off or run away. Ride off, ride off or run away. Ride off or run away. Ride off, ride off. Or run away. Ride off or run away. Ride off, ride off or run away. Run away. Away. [Verse 3: Crystal Caines]. I rather just. Ride off to the sunset. Love gets hard. But I rather just trust this. And baby I'm just tryna' do us Justice. Not really tryna' have this talk here in Public. Chill. I wanna stay. Wanna make it work. Cause the thought of you leaving have me on high alerts. Tryna' love you better so you ain't gotta hurt. And when it comes to whatever just know I'll put you first. Sometimes I wanna run. But I'm thinking back. Look at that. What we've become. And I'd be dumb to let you slip baby cause You the uh. Feeling like Rihanna. Talking that talk cause You the one. And You Know that we the Truth. Cause we been through hell and back. and we here that's living proof. Matter fact that's love in proof. Long as I got you. Baby I could never lose. True"
suntan,"I've been on this journey for so long. Stuck in this freezing winter storm. With hearts as cold as ice. Taking love from mine. Pray for a ray of sunlight. Cause I. I just wanna soak up the sun (the sun). And you. You just might be the right one. Cause I. I just wanna soak up the sun (the sun). And you. You just might be the right one. Heartbreak and I went hand in hand. I never saw the beach. But had my head buried in the sand. So now you come along bringing me summer. Your love so bright you're giving me a suntan. No need for winter coats. scarves, hats, or umbrellas. Just maybe some sunscreen. Cause I. I just wanna soak up the sun (the sun). And you. You just might be the right one. Cause I. I just wanna soak up the sun (the sun). And you. You just might be the right one. For me"
wasn't love cafe,"We were always headed down the long road. A long road towards destruction. I've never known a heart could be so cold. Beating 6 degrees below, oh no. Sometimes I wonder if it would have turned out. Different had I stayed. Sometimes I wonder if I would have somewhat. Get my life after you made me feel that way. If you would have just looked at me. The way that I needed you to sometimes. If you would have held my hand. The way that people do. With their fingers intertwined. When they love each other. See you always made me feel like I wasn't me. You called me weak for reacting emotionally. To find the love I gained was love wasted. Damn I hate the beat in this. And the way it tasted. See we all get tired of putting out fires. Our love's not legit, I can't deal with it. We all get tired of putting out fires. Our love's not legit, I can't deal with it. We all get tired sometimes. And that shit will make you lose your mind. If you would have just looked at me. If you would have just looked at me. If you would have just looked at me. If you would have just looked at me. The way that I needed you to sometimes. If you would have held my hand. The way that people do. With their fingers intertwined. When they love each other. When they love each other. When they love each other. When they love each other"
