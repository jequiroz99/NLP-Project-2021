You said no star was out of reach. You stood by me and I stood tall. I had your love I had it all. I'm grateful for each day you gave me. Maybe I don't know that much. But I know this much is true.

how could an angel break my heart (feat. alyssa quijano),"I heard he sang a lullaby. I heard he sang it from his heart. When I found out thought I would die. Because that lullaby was mine. I heard he sealed it with a kiss. He gently kissed her cherry lips. I found that so hard to believe. Because his kiss belonged to me. How could an angel break my heart. Why didn't he catch my falling star. I wish I didn't wish so hard. Maybe I wished our love apart. How could an angel break my heart. I heard her face was white as rain. Soft as a rose that blooms in May. He keeps her picture in a frame. And when he sleeps he calls her name. I wonder if she makes him smile. The way he used to smile at me. I hope she doesn't make him laugh. Because his laugh belongs to me. How could an angel break my heart. Why didn't he catch my falling star. I wish I didn't wish so hard. Maybe I wish our love apart. How could an angel break my heart. Oh my soul is dying, it's crying. I'm trying to understand. Please help me. How could an angel break my heart. Why didn't he catch my falling star. I wish I didn't wish so hard. Maybe I wished our love apart. How could an angel break my heart"

in my life,There are places I remember. All my life though some have changed. Some forever not for better. Some have gone and some remain. All these places have their moments.

And these memories lose their meaning. When I think of love as something new. Though I know I'll never ever lose affection. For people and things that went before. I know I'll often stop and think of them. In my life I love you more. I love you more. Though I know I'll never lose affection. For people and things that went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them. In my life I love you more. I love you more

Mistletoe help to make the season bright. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow. Will find it hard to sleep tonight. They know that Santa's on his way. He's loaded lots of toys and goodies. On his sleigh. And ev'ry mother's. Child is gonna spy to see if. Reindeer really know how to fly. And so, I'm offering this. Simple phrase to kids from. One to ninety-two. Altho' it's been said many times. Many ways. Merry Christmas to you"
the one that got away,"Sorrow after high-school when we first met. Make cold in your mustang to radio. I know my 18 birthday... much tattoo. Used to steal your parents' liquor, clap to the roof. Talk about our future we had a clue. Never plan that one day I was losing you. In another life I would be your girl. We care for what promises, be us against the world. In another life I will make you stay. So I don't have to say you. The one that got away. The one that got away. I was surely you were Johnny Cash. Never worry 'bout the other we met a. Sometimes when I miss you I put those records on, no. Someone said you had your tattoo removed. So you downtown save the roofs. Stamp the face the music I'm no longer your muse. In another life I would be your girl. We care for what promises, be us against the world. In another life I will make you stay. So I don't have to say you're. The one that got away. The one that got away. All this money can't find me a time machine, ohh. Can't replace you with the million ring, ohh. Should have told you what you meant to me, no. 'Cause now I pay the ground. In another life I would be your girl. We care for what promises, be us against the world. In another life I will make you stay. So I don't have to say you. The one that got away. The one that got away. For the one I got away"
the truth is,I almost said the words last night. I told myself the moment wasn't right. No one wants to be the one who says it first. But I been keeping it inside a secret for so long it hurts. The truth is that I love you. And I need to know from you if you love me too. The truth is that I want you completely. So if you love me too I need to know from you. What the truth is. I'm trying to look behind your eyes. I been trying to read between unspoken lines. We keep dancing 'round and we don't know what's real. Can't let the music end. Before we can find a way to say the things we feel. The truth is that I love you. And I need to know from you if you love me too. The truth is that I want you completely. So if you love me too I need to know from you. What the truth is. Oh I thought I could just walk away. That you might be a passing flame. I told myself I wouldn't care. If you weren't there. But the truth is that I love you. And I need to know from you if you love me too. The truth is that I want you completely. So if you love me too I need to know from you. What the truth is. Oh whoa what the truth is. Tell me what the truth is. by caroline tsuchiya
through the years,"I can't remember when you weren't there. When I didn't care for anyone but you. I swear we've been through everything there is. Can't imagine anything we've missed.

I've never been afraid. I've loved the life we've made. And I'm so glad I've stayed. Right here with you. Through the years. I can't remember what I used to do. Who I trusted whom, I listened to before. And I swear you've taught me everything I know. Can't imagine needing someone so. But seems to me. I need you more and more.

wind beneath my wings,"Did you ever know that you're my hero. And everything I would like to be?. I could fly higher than an eagle. 'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings. It must have been cold there in my shadow. To never have sunlight on your face. You were content to let me shine, that's your way. You always walked a step behind. So I was the one with all the glory. While you were the one with all the strength. A beautiful face without a name for so long. A beautiful smile to hide the pain. Did you ever know that you're my hero. And everything I would like to be?. I could fly higher than an eagle. 'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings. It might have appeared to go unnoticed. But I've got it all here in my heart. I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it. I would be nothing without you. Did you ever know that you're my hero?. You're everything I wish I could be. I could fly higher than an eagle. 'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings. And did I ever tell you you're my hero?. You're everything, everything I wish I could be. Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle. 'cause you are the wind beneath my wings. Thank you, you are the wind beneath my wings. Fly, fly, fly away. You let me fly so high. Oh, you, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings. Oh, you, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings. Fly, fly, fly high against the sky. so high I almost touched the sky. Thank you, thank you. You are the wind beneath my wings. Thank you, thank you. Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings"
you and me against the world,You and me against the world. Sometimes it seems like you and me against the world. When all the others turn their backs and walk away. You can count on me to stay. Remember when the circus came to town. And you were frightened by the clown. Wasn't it nice to be around someone that you knew?. Someone who was big and strong and looking out for you. And you and me against the world (you and me against the world). Sometimes it seems like you and me against the world (you and me against the world). And for all the times we've cried I always felt that. God was on our side (God is on our side). And when one of us is gone (when one of us is gone). And one of us is left to carry on. Then remembering will have to do (remembering will have to do). Our memories alone will get us through. Think about the days of me and you. Of you and me against the world. [Interlude]. Hmm. And when one of us is gone. And one of us is left to carry on. Then remembering will have to do. Our memories alone will get us through. Think about the days of me and you.

you raise me up,"When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary. When troubles come and my heart burdened be. Then, I am still and wait here in the silence. Until you come and sit awhile with me.
