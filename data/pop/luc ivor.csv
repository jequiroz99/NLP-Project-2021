diamond graves,"Infected by selfish and empty minds. Surrender, it's for them that we live our life. Our sun is eclipsed for their pride. And shining fancy crown. The black car for the chase carries someone. Who doesn't give a fuck to us. Burry me in diamond graves (just need it). Suffocate me with your lies, erase me. In Jesus name I pray. I love you Jesus, hallelujah, amen!. Lost eyes and an opaque and pale skin. The cage that broke our wings when we tried to see. What happens outside that is involved in mystery. Those who live in our neighborhood. Don't give a fuck to anyone at all. Burry me in diamond graves (just need it). Suffocate me with your lies, erase"
dropwise fucked,"Sometimes you can make me feel better. Dropwise in a different dimension. My head is spinning, I'm so tired of staying only here with it. It's ten in the night so I lost myself in rubbles. Of my town, of my drink and my troubles.. But I'm fine in fact I'm sober, but please pay the bill for me. I'll hold you and say: ""baby never leave me, like them"". We're only living our moment of mistakes. Dropwise fucked I am. The walls of my self prudence fall down. As long as I feel I don't know my own bound. The alcohol fill the emptiness existing in the ground of my house. I hope when I have nothing else I still have you. Drowning me in troubles and solutions too. If I have something loyal I can say it's what you do, you do. I'll hold you and say: ""baby never leave me, like them"". We're only living our moment of mistakes. Dropwise fucked I am. They used to say all day: ""Don't cover you eyes for the world"". In my head what he said: ""the sunset there's no emotion without you"". Oh, you're the reason why I wanna hide. Oh, my weak and emotional side. All I fear is seeing I'm not with you. I rather live an illusion of ""I love you too"". Dropwise fucked I. Dropwise fucked I. Dropwise fucked I. Dropwise fucked I am"

normal life,"I'm spending my time with things I don't care. Nothing in my heart, everything In my head. I remember when I colonized the streets. A childhood memory that died when I arrived here. Damn God I remember it now. I had my family, I had my dog. I had my friends, I had my job. I was happy, I used to live a normal life. without danger, I smoked and get drunk sometimes. Damn God I remember it now. 1th of July they invaded my home. An awful noise, I was alone. But I remember the cold that was in the town. Especially in my bones. breaking like glass in the dark. Thank God I remember it now. I made things wrong, but many things right. I wish I could back to live my life. Stolen for two men, it's the system. Corrupted minds, a few of us survive in this prison. Oh God bring me back to life"
