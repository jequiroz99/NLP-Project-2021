Waiting for the sun. Watching the horizon. Everybody's coming home for summer. But still feels a million miles away. What a feeling, taste the freedom. There with every bite. Finally we're coming home. We shadow-boxed the enemy. Swing until we extradite our fears. Their backed into a corner. Ring the bell, we shed our blood and tears. Like hibernating sun-rays, hoping for the sun. Watching the horizon. Everybody's coming home for summer. But still feels a thousand miles away. What a feeling, taste the freedom. There with every bite. Finally we're coming home. Oh, we suffered in silence. Through storms and through violence. We stayed our way. The waves have sub-sided. Clouds have divided. Found a reason to survive. Found the will to stay alive. That will be the last thing that we do. Heading for summer. Back home for summer. Everybody's coming home for summer. (everybody). But still feels a thousand miles away. What a feeling, (what a feeling). Taste the freedom (taste the freedom). There with every bite. Finally we're coming home. Oh, we're coming home. Oh, I'm coming home"

If that made sense I'd leave it here. I have no lesser business,. I'm Immaterial but I still got things on a wish list,. This is desire; can't you hear it in my c+ english?. I'd love the finer things but that's. Not being realistic, ballistic,. Everybody goes when I'm singing,. I'm sick of singing pain,. So I'm free, broken, winging,. Coming out my heart purer than the way I'm living,. Maybe I'll see you, or maybe I'll just give in.. Yeah, it's just too much now that I'm all grown up,. I've been dragged through the dirt. Now I should be blowing up,. Still I'm blowing, still I'm blowing,. And still I don't know where the hell I should be going,. So I guess it's just live like this til my mind goes snap,. No love, no drug could ever fill this gap,. Yeah I live for the high until it all floods back,. Like the tears of the years that I can't get back..

I bought you t-shirts and chocolate, I sent you jewellery. Look at what you do to me, I'm crying over stupid shit. Your songs are not about me, I am taking back my jewellery. You're such a fuckin homophobe, I wish I never let you in. To think that I was thinking maybe I should let you live. I'm gonna blow up your family like I'm a terrorist. You were my hero, my Jesus, and now you're my nemesis. I'd climb up on your terrace, menace into your fellowship. I'll slit the throats of your relatives, shoot that Jess in the belly. Feed you heroin, I gave you everything. Now you'll come to bed with me forever, you're in debt with me. Chorus. Is this free? I got the letters you sent for me. St Lukes is where you mother-fuckin sentenced me. I just found your number, your the same one that's been texting me. Stalkin me, there's police outside your house, you'd better talk to me. Yeah, send him in, this creepy cunt's ignoring me. I think I hear something, wait, wait (knock knock knock, knock) yeah. (Telephone voice). My name's Paul, I'm a doorman, I wish my mum had aborted me. I'm divorced and I'm lost at the age of forty-three. I'm dressed up and these people are always calling me. Paul, I'm (metallic poison?) and I'm talking about you constantly. Then I found out you were homophobic and it got me so mad. I slaughtered and decided your homophobia was not gonna watch on me. You were threatening to slaughter me? That's all I need. I will always love you my idol, I guess that's all from me. I'm at your door you see, now try ignoring me. (Fighting and shouting noises).

I just coughed and rubbed her merits off. Dream a little dream. Dream a little dream for me, for me. Yeah, yeah. Look at my face, I don't fit the criteria. Look at my crowds, look at all of my experience. Listen they would never take my sound serious. Think of all the pounds, tell me which climb's easiest. I'm hella nervous, producer's say Who's next?. Tell me what kind of dumb shit I'll do next?. My knees tremble, I panic, I'm too stressed. I try and remember if there's any booze left. Inside the bag in the club, number who's next?. Sends an echo through the stadium, echoing who's next?. I'm next on my way to this huge jest. I sing a song and Nicole told me ""You's blessed"". I was screaming, screaming fuck the world inside my head. It taught me I was a waster, I had no common sense. Now there's cameras and suddenly all the times dead. I'll return your merits and pour you a glass of fine red. Dream a little dream. Dream a little dream for me, for me. Dream a little dream. Dream a little dream for me, for me. For me"
without love,"I just saw through a demon. That's why I've got the people feeling so bohemian. I'm the warm one. And I'm cold too. Yeah I'm boro 'til I die. I got Glasgow in my heart. Let's start with you. And how you made me this way. But I forgive the hate. I just hope that some day. You'll say It's you, you. You are the problems. Not me, me. And maybe you'll solve them.

And if I die would you cry?. Would you walk on by?. I bet the later. Sometimes if feels like nothing really matters. It's okay though. I drive a hundred on the stay roads. Straight to hell again. Feels like something happens. Certainly something of importance. That has somehow got avoied. This is all enrage and torment. I've just realized what it all meant.

Get along with our lives. I've made a lot of mistakes in my past. But I refuse to live there. I saw a lot of hearts break in the past. But I refuse to go there. It hurts too much. Looking for a crush. Looking for just any girl just for a touch. I let myself go. I let my angst out. And when I let myself down. I just swag it out. Baby girl I like to dance. But I'm just looking to get your pants. What's wrong with that?. I'm young, forgive me. I live fast die a legend, Whitney. (Instrumental). Say it's you, you. You with the problems. Not me, me. And maybe you'll solve them. Then we, we, can all get along with our lives. Get along with our lives. Say it's you, you. You with the problems. Not me, me. And maybe you'll solve them. Then we, we, can all get along with our lives. Get along with our lives. Along with our lives. (Music By James Arthur Band)"
