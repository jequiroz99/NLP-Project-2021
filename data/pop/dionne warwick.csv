For you put your heart in it,. And so I dream of old Brazil. Where hearts were entertaining June,. We stood beneath an amber moon. And softly murmured ?someday soon?. We kissed and clung together,. Then tomorrow was another day. The morning found me miles away. With still a million things to say. Now when twilight dims the sky above,. Recalling thrills of our love,. There?s one thing I?m certain of;. Return I will. To old Brazil."

begin the beguine,"When they begin the beguine. It brings back the sound of music so tender. It brings back a night of tropical splendor. It brings back a memory evergreen. I'm with you once more under the stars. And down by the shore. An orchestra's playing. And even the palms they seem to be swaying. When they begin the beguine. To live it again is past all endeavor. Except when that tune clutches my heart. And there we are swearing to love forever. And promising never, never to part. What moments divine, what rapture serene. Till clouds came along to disperse. The joy we had tasted. And now, when I hear people curse. The chance that was wasted. I know but too well what they mean. So don't let them begin the beguine. Let the love that was once a fire. Remain an amber. Let it sleep like a dead desire. I only remember. When they begin the beguine. Oh, yes, let them begin the beguine. Make them play. Till the stars that we met before. Return above you. Till you whisper to me once more. Darling, I love you. And we suddenly know what heaven we're in. Yes, when they begin the beguine. When they begin the beguine. When they begin the beguine. Let the love that was once a fire. Remain an amber. Let it sleep like a dead desire. I only remember. When they begin the beguine"
