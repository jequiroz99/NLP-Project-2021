And the cold wind is hitting my face and you're gone. And you're walking away. And I'm helpless sometimes. Wishing's just no good. Cause you don't see me like I wish you would. Cause you never were, and you never will be mine. No, you never were, and you never will be mine. There's a moment to seize everytime that we meet. But you have always keep passing me by.

bumpy ride,"Sometimes life can be a bumpy ride. Sometimes it feels like you're drivin with covered eyes. And you listen to your friend who's in the car by your side. They say they've got your map, what if your friends are tellin' lies. So listen to your heart 'cause you can't see no roadsigns. You don't know where to stop or to turn. Everyone goes through it I'm in the middle of mine. And I try to remember it's the only way to learn. Hold on [you've gotta hold on]. Hold on [you've gotta hold on]. You gotta stay real true to yourself in the game. Of becomin' a woman where the rules never stay the same. Remember who you are, who made you and who's keepin' you here. Who's makin' you not duck for problems in fear?. People in your way, dogs and bitches. Who's lickin' your ass? liers and snitches. Even though it's a bumpy ride. Keep your head above the waterline. Keep focused and you'll make it through. Keep on rollin' is what you've got to do. Even though it's a bumpy ride don't you slip and don't you slide. Love will be there in the end when you come around that bend. You've gotta keep your flow smooth, never hesitate. Never stop believin' always keepin' the faith. But always be critical never naive. 'Cause if you can be that there's so much more you can achieve. Maybe then when you're grown up satisfied and strong. Maybe then you will be happy, happy that you held on."

Cause if you do I'm gonna take our destiny. And turn it into freaky reality. [That's how]. How I know, well it's my female intuition. And something tells me that it's time for some action. Cause I've been waiting for so long for the right moment. to let you know that my desire is too string to let you go. [How]. Chorus. You know it's all about timing that rules everything. And tonight the time is right it is our night tonight. Take your time don't let me stop you do what you wanna do. As long as, as long as you will affect me with the things you do. Tonight's the night the time is right it is our time tonight."

my only reason,"My only reason. Love is my only reason and love can make you do crazy things. And that's why my only explanation is cuz I love you and that's all. Boy I love you and that's all. My friends think I'm crazy. Coz I'm running around with you. But they don't know you like I do, and I do. You're so impossible, so unpredictable. I know, they don't have to tell me. But my heart's made up my mind. It's so irrational, so irresponsible. It may not make sense. But it's making me feel so deep. Love is my only reason and love can make you do crazy things. And that's why my only explanation is cuz I love you and that's all. Boy I love you and that's all. 3:30 in the morning and you're asking why I'm still here. My life would probably be safer if you disappear, but don't disappear no. It's like a burning flame that's stronger in the rain. I ask myself why I do this over and over again. But even with your pain. I still can't walk away until every chance is gone. I'll be here holding on. Love is my only reason and love can make you do crazy things. And that's why my only explanation is cuz I love you and that's all. Boy I love you and that's all. I don't even have a choice, I don't have a choice. These kind of situations have a life of their own. So why isn't my love enough to explain. Why am I acting this way?. Is just that.... Love is my only reason and love can make you do crazy things. And that's why my only explanation is cuz I love you and that's all. Boy I love you and that's all."
my truth,"If I don't say what you wanna hear. If I don't dress in what you want me to wear. If I don't think the way you do. I can't help it cause that's my truth. If my humor makes you bored.

If where I say go, is where you draw the line. Even if I may not agree. I will except cause it's your truth and it sets you free. You see the truth often hurts. But if it's honest it's always worth it. Can't deny that I'm subjective. But no truth can be objective. Even though it's universal. It's always individual. My truth, your truth, his truth, her truth. It doesn't matter as long as it's true. Don't you loose your truth. For whatever it's worth. Don't you try to compromise. With your own lies. You see the truth often hurts.

Then take her to my hotel room and then bone her. You know when in Rome I sat down with the Romans. Said ""We need a black pope and she better be a woman"". There'll be no more celibacy. Even the Vatican knows not to fuck with me. You should know better. Y-You should know better. You should know better than to fuck with me. If you knew better you would do better. You should know better. Y-You should know better. You should know better than to fuck with me. If you knew better you would do better. We big-ballin' in Holland, Amsterdam my man. I got a table at the coffee shop. Where we like to spark a lot. Hangin' in the parking lot blowin' a bleezy. Easy fo sheezy deezy. I crashed a party with the Czar. Threw a molotov cocktail in the bar. And you know my style's revolutionary. Even the Russians know better than to fuck with me. You try to ban me, you can't stand me. Cuz I'm an outlaw. Black president livin' in the White House. Mr. B he wrote a letter to me. The FBI know better than to fuck with me. Yo, I was there at Watergate. You know I rigged my gear got the fuckers on tape. They put the mic in the hand of the wrong MC. Even the CIA knows not to fuck with me. You should know better. Y-You should know better. You should know better than to fuck with me. If you knew better you would do better. You should know better. Y-You should know better. You should know better than to fuck with me. If you knew better you would do better. Tell 'em Snoop, tell 'em like it is. I been there, in there, out there like that. Right back to the hood, a hundred Euro stacks. Shoot motherfuckers just on GP. LAPD know better than to fuck with me. I danced with the devil in Kathmandu. I came hummin' and blastin' with the boogaloo too. Now I declare most solemnly. The prince of darkness know better than to fuck with me. You know not what you know. Tell 'em what I'm in it for. Then I run up in it slow. Really though, silly ho. Yea spend a minute though. I blow an ounce and make you bounce. Just like a sixty-four. Now you know me I'm a woman of peace. I don't never take nothin' don't belong to me. I throw down and say ""Whatever's gonna be, gonna be"". The whole industry knows not to fuck with me. You should know better. Y-You should know better. You should know better than to fuck with me. If you knew better you would do better. You should know better. Y-You should know better. You should know better than to fuck with me. If you knew better you would do better. You should know better. Y-You should know better. You should know better than to fuck with me. If you knew better you would do better"
underneath the heart,"I look into your eyes to see a place, drifting like a saterlite in space,. longing for a touch from someone who feels too much, and yet hold up. your walls before I've gotten close enough, but baby,. I can see the glimmer when you open up the door. and that crack of shining light keeps me coming back for more, to see. ref: Underneath the heart, just before the lips, right behind the soul,. what the mind has yet to know, the dreams you can't belive and the love I. need to show, the place we aim to start is right there,. underneath the heart.. You live inside the castle made of sand,. where tears would only hurt the way it stands.. I want to knock it down, start to fresh on solid grown,. still you hide behind the past like that's what life's all about, but baby. words can not describe true love when true love is really real, and the only. way you know is if you show me how you feel,. ref: Underneath the heart, just before the lips, right behind the soul,. what the mind has yet to know, the dreams you can't belive and the love I. need to show, the place we aim to start is right there,. underneath the heart.. You could spend your hole life in fear of pain, but love is only as deep as. the risk you take, as the risk you take.. ref: Underneath the heart, just before the lips, right behind the soul,. what the mind has yet to know, the dreams you can't belive and the love I. need to show, the place we aim to start is right there,. underneath the heart."
universal woman,"[Verse 1]. She needs a place to rest her broken soul. Longs for a place where love is good. Her passion for him made her heart bold. She sacrificed her womanhood. Love made her brave but oh so vulnerable. But still she keeps on holding on. Some say she's weak, I say she's beautiful. Her weakness prooves that she is strong. [Chorus]. She's a universal woman. And she lives inside of you. She's a universal woman. And love is all she can do. She lost her spirit when she lost her child. To what society demands. And all the children and the mother cried. 'Cause nature can not understand. But everytime she dies she's born again. True love never just goes away. Just like her sacrifice is not in vain. 'Cause she will allways prevail. [Chorus (x1) ]. [Verse 1 (x1) ]. [Chorus (x1) ]. Yeah love. Love"

where did our love go,Thoughts about you and me Thinkin' about what we used to be. Love was strong so were we Until one day it all went wrong. A new body a new face. But no one good enough to fill your empty space. Baby where did our love go. I'm thinkin' about you and me now. Baby both you and I should know. We should know by now. Warming heat coolin' shade Whatever I needed I found in the love we made. Maybe this was meant to be Miss and reminisce of something close to exctasy. But I still hope that you feel our love inside the way I do. Chorus. Thoughts about you and me Thinkin' about what used to be.
who's that girl,"Good girls are pretty like all the time. I'm just pretty some of the time. Good girls are happy and satisfied. I won't stop asking until i die. I just can't deal with the rules.

with every heartbeat (feat. kleerup),"Maybe we could make it alright. We could make it better sometime. Maybe we could make it happen baby. We could keep trying. but things will never change. So I don't look back. Still I'm dying with every step I take. But I don't look back. Just a little, little bit better. Good enough to waste some time. Tell me would it make you happy baby. We could keep trying. but things will never change. So I don't look back. Still I'm dying with every step I take. But I don't look back. We could keep trying. but things will never change. So I don't look back. Still I'm dying with every step I take. But I don't look back. And it hurts with every heartbeat"
you've got that something,"Look at me here I am. I'm givin all of my lovin' every day of my life to you. All you see can be yours. If you show me you want me just one little hint will do. And I know,. I give too much and there is much that I sacrifice. But I've got all the reasons. when I look into your eyes. I know I love you even though I shouldn't and you should know. I've tried to stop. You've got that somethin'. Somethin' I can't describe. Gives me that feelin'. Gives me that freaky vibe. You've got that something that makes me feel so fine. Makes it worth waiting until the day that you will be mine, all mine. You decide take your time. I just want you to know that I'll always be here for you. My friends keep tellin' me:. you've gotta let go!. They say I'm too good for you and maybe that is true. But I just keep on lovin' you the way I did before. And you should know I've tried to stop."
