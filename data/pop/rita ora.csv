Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing. And I don't even need your love. But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough. No, you didn't have to stoop so low. Have your friends collect your records and then change your number. I guess that I don't need, that though. Now you're just somebody that I used to know. Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over. But had me believing it was always something that I'd done. But I don't wanna live that way, reading into every word you say. You said that you could let it go. And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know. But you didn't have to cut me off. Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing. And I don't even need your love. But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough. No, you didn't have to stoop so low. Have your friends collect your records and then change your number.

"young, single & sexy","Tired of sitting here in my room. Waiting for you to change. With my dress and my lipstick on. You should see it on me. It's such a shame. But I know about the girl you called. The one from the park with the pink heels on. We're damaged, uneven. Broken, I'm leavin'. I'm way too fly for that, yea. I won't sit back if you want my love. You act like my love is not enough. Don't make me erase you from my phone. Cause I can always go out alone. Who says you were the first and last. I look in the mirror, know what I am. They say a love can lead you blind. Well not these eyes of mine. So I don't even care. Got my hands in the air. Gonna fill my tank and go. Me and all my girls gonna run around town. We can do whatever we want. Cause I'm young, single and sexy. I'm young, single and sexy. London to New York City. I'm young, single and sexy. He'll be lonely on a Friday night. And that's just what he gets. I been calling him, calling all day. Yet he still hasn't called me yet. And when he does it will be too late, you know. I'll be at the party hanging with my mates. Who am I to sit at home. I'm too busy to wait. I'm way too smart for that. I won't sit here and go back and forth. Don't act like it's okay you just got caught. Constructors can't build this bridge back up. This is how it ends you're outta luck. Who said you were the first and last. I look in the mirror I know what I am. They say a love can lead you blind. Well not these eyes of mine. So I don't even care. Got my hands in the air. Gonna fill my tank and go. Me and all my girls gonna run around town. We can do whatever we want. Cause I'm young, single and sexy. I'm young, single and sexy. London to New York City. I'm young, single and sexy. Now I can dance when I wanna. Clap my hands when I wanna. No one can say come home. Out all night long, oh yea. And I will not be bothered. If I wanna party till tomorrow. I'm sexy and free. That's how it should be. So come on, come on and do it with me oh. So I don't even care. Got my hands in the air. Gonna fill my tank and go (Fill my tank and go). Me and all my girls gonna run around town. We can do whatever we want. Cause I'm young, single and sexy.

your song,"I woke up with a fear this morning. But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue. Alarm without no warning. You're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs. Last night we were way up. Kissing in the back of the cab. And then you say ""love, baby, let's go back to my flat"". And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that. I got a reason so man, put that record on again. I don't want to hear sad songs anymore. I only want to hear love songs. I found my heart up in this place tonight. Don't want to sing mad songs anymore. Only want to sing your song. Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm. I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love. Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like that. No fear but I think I'm falling. I'm not proud. But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run. No risk so I think I'm all in. When I kiss your lips, through my heartbeat thumb. And now we're way up, dancing on the roof of the house. And then we make love. Right there on your best friend's couch. And then you say ""love, this is what is all about"". So keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again. I don't want to hear sad songs anymore. I only want to hear love songs. I found my heart up in this place tonight. Don't want to sing mad songs anymore. Only want to sing your song.
