blame it on the boogie,"Hee, hee, hee, hee. My baby’s always dancin’ and it wouldn’t be a bad thing. But I don’t get no lovin’ and that’s no lie. We spent the night in Frisco at every kinda disco. From that night I kissed our love goodbye. Don’t blame it on the sunshine. Don’t blame it on the moonlight. Don’t blame it on the good times. Blame it on the boogie. Don’t blame it on the sunshine. Don’t blame it on the moonlight. Don’t blame it on the good times. Blame it on the boogie. That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow how it has drugged me. Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet.

Don’t blame it on the moonlight. Don’t on the good times. Blame it on the boogie. This magic music grooves me, that dirty rhythm fools me. The devil’s gotten to me through this dance. I’m full of funky fever, a fire burns inside me. Boogie’s got me in a super trance. Don’t blame it on the sunshine. Don’t blame it on the moonlight. Don’t blame it on the good times. Blame it on the boogie. Don’t you blame it sunshine. Don’t blame it on the moonlight. Don’t blame it on the good times. Blame it on the boogie. Ow (Sunshine). Ooh (Moonlight). Yeah (Good times).

But I was much too busy. Trying to shine. To let your love shine in. Let you slip away. I must have been insane. Stop in the name of love. Don't make me live my life in vain. (Chorus). Give me one more chance. That's all I ask of you. Just one more chance. I'll make it up to you. Just one more chance. That's all I ask of you. I'll build you a world for two. I'll make it up to you. Now since I'm all alone. I'm talking to myself. I know you're out there somewhere. Having fun with someone else. But a distant voice of hope. Echo from within, sayin'. (Don't give up). (Your ship is comin' in). Though my ship's alone. I'll play right to the end. I'm crying outside. heaven's door. Won't you let me back in. . You'll never know. What I've been through. Let your love shine in again"

heartbreak hotel,"Live and sin. Ten years ago on this day,. My heart was yearning.. I promised I would never ever be returning. Where my baby broke my heart. And left me yearning. As we walked into the room,. There were faces. Staring, glaring, tearing through me. Someone said welcome to your doom. Then they smiled with eyes. That looked as if they knew me. This is scaring me. We walked up the stairs. Still concealing gloom. There were two girls sitting in my room. She walked up to my face. And said this is the place,. You said meet you right here at noon. Heartbreak hotel. Heartbreak hotel. Heartbreak hotel. Heartbreak hotel. Hope is dead. She thought that I had cheated for another lover. I turn my back to see that I am undercover. Now I can't convince this girl. There ain't no other. Someone's evil to hurt my soul. Every smile's a trial thought in beguile. To hurt me. Then the man next door had told. He's been here in tears for fifteen years. This is scaring me. We came to this place, where the vicious dwell. And found that wicked women. Run this strange hotel. There was sefra and sue,. Every girl that I knew. And my baby said love is through.. Heartbreak hotel. Heartbreak hotel. Heartbreak hotel. Heartbreak hotel"

love's gone bad,"Ah I feel a fountain in my brain. Ice-cold water runnin' through my pain. Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears. Heart feel sad 'cause Love's Gone Bad. I see a rainbow all in black. Must be a sign you ain't comin' back. Wake up at night callin' your name. I see a face on my window pane. I've been this way since you've been gone. Without your love, I can't go on. Look in the mirror, what do I see?. A cryin' face, kinda looks like me. Now where's the love you promised me?. Where's the tenderness to comfort me?. Everytime some love I choose. I seem to always be the one to lose. Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears. Heart feels sad 'cause Love's Gone Bad. Love's Gone Bad, heart feels sad. Ooh, Black cruel signing up above. It's a sign I live my life without love. Signs on the man, slime's on the sea. Signs everywhere I said I'm destined to be. And if the world baby nothing's right. Since you've been gone baby. Can't sleep at night. You said you'd be true to me. Instead you made a fool of me. Heart feel sad, Love's Gone Bad. Ouw.... Auw, Love's Gone Bad. Heart feel sad. Love's gone Bad. Heart feel sad. Auw!! Ouw.... Ooh, Love's Gone Bad. Heart feel sad. Love's Gone Bad. Love's Gone Bad. Auw!!. Love's Gone Bad. Love's Gone Bad.
