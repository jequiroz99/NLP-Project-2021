with you,"With you. I learned that love was an art and not all are actors. And you have novels that are too short. to the point of being just episodes in vain. With you. I learned that making mistakes and just a way to say. ""I do not know"" and that not everyone is perfect. Do what. Not everything and forever. As you said goodbye. My dreams are no longer your. You and me. How can this happen?. It seemed so perfect. But not everyone is perfect. I wanted to forget how much I messed up. Most everyone makes mistakes. When someone loves another. You and me. You and me. You and me. I try to forget. But I can not. It is impossible to live without you. Feel your smile. It made me well. Feel your hugs. Being with someone. You and me. You and me. You and me"
