finally finding out,"Verse 1:. I didn't wanna be silent. I had a lot to say. I didn't wanna make moves. Until I paved a way. I'm giving in to something. I never gave before. I'm taking on much less.

And my baby's so good for me. I can see my future in our family. If you believe in something. You gotta hold on tight. You can always feel it better. If you close your eyes. Chorus. (Repeat). Bridge:. Our love's what's supposed to be. It takes time. Grows out of trust and honesty. If you dive in, change your mind. 'Cause you don't know how to swim, baby. I turn the lights and go to sleep. Dream of all that we can be. And wake up knowing we can always try Chorus. (Repeat)."

separate ways,"Looking for a way in. It's a big step when you fall in. And every single touch says. How you need it, can you feel me. It takes on a whirlwind. And it blows in like a hurricane. Till you wonder where you are. And how you got so far. I'll be with you. When we go our separate ways. You'll be with me. When we go our separate ways. I have to believe that when you're fast asleep. I'll still be the first one in your dreams. 'Cause I'll be with you. When we go our separate ways. We had to find a way out. From escaping from the faking. Not expecting they'd be taken. You know that I will always. Take you with me when I do not know where to go. You know that you will always be the answer. To the questions I don't know. I'll be with you. When we go our separate ways. You'll be with me. When we go our separate ways. Baby sometimes I get so excited. The night that we met. I was bursting inside. We know that. It must have been fate. That we found it too late. A special relationship died. And I hate that night. It was so good when. It felt like it should. Are the one's that we can't have again. When the times get too tough. And we've both had enough. Maybe we'll find out. That we're still in love."
