signs,"I'm lying alone on the floor. With a feather I found in my hand. I wanna believe its from you. But I just dont think that I can. If theres a God then you'd still be here. And a heaven then why am I in hell. I'm lost and I'm lookin for signs. And maybe I'm just fooling myself. But I swear down my spine I'm getting shivers. Like we kissed for the very first time. Tho the tears are streaming down like rivers. I know I asked you to give me a sign. I'm not scared tho my body starts shakin. I can almost feel you drying my eyes. And even tho my heart is breaking. I know you love me from the other side. Now I see the signs, I see the signs. Keep findin myself on the street. Starin at you from behind. Then I reach out to turn you around. But I'm lookin in a strangers eyes. If theres a God then you'd still be here. Or a heaven then why am I in hell. And tt feels like you just walked thru me. Cos you touch me like no one else. And I swear down my spine I'm getting shivers. Like we kissed for the very first time. Tho the tears are streaming down like rivers. I know I asked you to give me a sign. I'm not scared tho my body starts shakin. I can almost feel you drying my eyes. And even tho my heart is breaking. I know you love me from the other side. Now I see the signs. I see the signs (4x).

time after time,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick. And think of you. caught up in circles. confusion Is nothing new. Flashback--warm nights. Almost left behind. Suitcase of memories. Time after. Sometimes you picture me. I'm walking too far ahead. You're calling to me, I can't hear. What you've said. Then you say--go slow. I fall behind. The second hand unwinds. If you're lost you can look--and you will find me. Time after time. If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting. Time after time. If you're lost you can look--and you will find me. Time after time. If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting. Time after time. After my picture fades and darkness has. Turned to gray. Watching through windows--you're wondering. If I'm OK. Secrets stolen from deep inside. The drum beats out of time. If you're lost you can look--and you will find me. Time after time. If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting. Time after time. You said go slow. I fall behind. The second hand unwinds. If you're lost you can look--and you will find me. Time after time. If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting. Time after time. If you're lost you can look--and you will find me. Time after time. If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting. Time after time. Time after time x 7"
