all about love,Risks and shadows left on the floor. Your heart still beating. With every scar. Your voice still echoing on my mind. And no matter what I do. It is already gone. And no matter what I say. What I do or what I did. We still running out of time. Cause all we did together was. It was all about love. It was all about love. It doesn't matter if was wrong or right. It doesn't matter if you're here or not. It was all about love. It was all about love. I know that it hurts. I know we went wrong. But I don't want to think twice. I don't want to use my mind. But to lo-o-ve you. But to lo-o-ve you. And no matter what I say. What I do or what I did. We still running out of time. Cause all we did together was. It was all about love. It was all about love. Don't you remember when we used. To stay up all night?. Counting the stars in the sky?. Singing our favorite songs on guitar?. Kissing each other under the pale moonlight?. Till the sunrise. Till the sunrise. You held my hand that night. We promissed that we would last forever. But now I see. I was wrong to think right. I was wrong to think right. I was wrong to think right. And no matter what I say. What I do or what I did. We still running out of time. Cause all we did together was. It was all about love. It was all about love. It was all about love. It was all about love. Risks and shadows left on the floor. You're heart still beating. With every scar
bad generation,Turn the lights off. Cause we're already gone. We messed up their hearts. We did everything wrong. They misunderstood. There's nothing wrong. Missing the beat of their hearts. Carrying the weight of the world. We're the bad generation. Missing the love and salvation. A reputation. Depreciation. Oh Oh Oh. They say we lost our souls. And that old is gold. But we own our show. Following the beats of our flow. Oh Oh Oh. Locking them in chains. But there's blood in our veins. They forgot the love. They put everything above. Criticizing their culture. Taking out their future. We're the bad generation. Missing the love and salvation. A reputation. Depreciation. Oh Oh Oh. They said we lost our souls. And that old is gold. But we own our show. Following the beats of our flow. Oh Oh Oh. They can say whatever they want. We will never change. We can never change. And we don't want to change. We're the bad generation. Missing the love and salvation. A reputation. Depreciation. Oh Oh Oh. They said we lost our souls. And that old is gold. But we own our show. Following the beats of our flow. Oh Oh Oh. Just turn the lights off. Cause we're already gone
be with me,You're like a flash. Rounding through my head. Everything I do. Or everything I try to do. Is interrupted by your thoughts. I wrote a million songs for you. And right now I was thinking about us. Hey. Come with me. Cause I'm already in love with you. And since you've gone. I've lost my world. I've tried to sleep without you here. But when I close my eyes. Is like a nightmare. I can't stop thinking about you. Or thinking of losing you. So please don't go away. Don't go away. Be with me. Be with me. It keeps rounding my head. Why you're not here?. What is happening?. What I did wrong?. You simply wreck me from your heart. And stepped into mine. But thinking of losing you. Is like thinking of losing myself. And I can't forget you. Even if I tried to. And since you've gone. I've lost my world. I've tried to sleep without you here. But when I close my eyes. It's like a nightmare. I can't stop thinking about you. Or thinking of losing you. So please don't go away. Don't go away. Be with me. Be with me. Be with. Be with. Be with me. Come back. Be with me
broken path,This is one more sad song. About the hole you left in my chest. I wrote a million songs for you. You simply wreck me from your heart. And what you wanted me to do?. And I'm here singing this song. Cause loving you constantly broke me. Cause I'm. Cause I'm. I'm broken. You left me no choice. You let everything in my arms. What you expected me to do?. But you wreck me. From your heart first. You never loved me. Like I loved you. And what you expected me to do?. I was broken inside. And I'm still broken. You knew from the beginning. That the end was. Our path. So don't blame me now. Don't blame me now. Just don't blame me now. Cause you wreck me. From your heart first. And I was broken. I'm still broken. You left me no choice. You never loved me like I loved you. We knew from the beginning. That the end. Was our path. That the end. Was our path. And I'm broken. I'm still broken

drifting,"You haunt me like. Is everything my fault. Like I'm wrong. And you know I'm trying to get away. But you keep begging me to stay. So let them carry my soul out. And shut you dirty mouth. You had my heart in your hands. Didn't know what to do. Kept blaming me for everything wrong. Saying that it was all my fault. And now. We're drifting. Drifting. Only drifting. Away. What you're going to do about it?. Yeah baby, you're not an angel to guard. So let me drown. Let me take everything down. At least, what is left now. You had my heart in your hands.

Cause baby the first time I saw your eyes. It was like the paradise. You're looking at me. And words can't explain how is. To feel so close to you. Oh Oh Oh. To feel so close to you. Oh. It's your eyes. It's your lips. And your smile. And your soul. I don't know what it is. I just like to be with you. And to love you with everything. . Oh Oh Oh. To feel so close to you. Oh Oh Oh. To feel so close to you
