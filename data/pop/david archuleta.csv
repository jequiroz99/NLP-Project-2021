angels,I sit and wait. Does an angel contemplate my fate. And do they know. The places where we go. When we’re gray and old. ’cause I've been told. That salvation lets their wings unfold.

Whether I’m right or wrong. And down the waterfall. Wherever it may take me. I know that life won’t break me. When I come to call she won’t forsake me. I’m loving angels instead. When I’m feeling weak. And my pain walks down a one way street. I look above. And I know I’ll always be blessed with love. And as the feeling grows. She breathes flesh to my bones.

angel,Spend all your time waiting. For that second chance. For a break that would make it okay. There's always some reason. To feel not good enough. And it's hard at the end of the day. I need some distraction. Oh beautiful release. Memories seep from my veins. Let me be empty. Oh and weightless and maybe. I'll find some peace tonight. In the arms of the angel. Fly away from here. From this dark cold hotel room. And the endlessness that you feel. You are pulled from the wreckage. Of your silent reverie. You're in the arms of the angel. Maybe you find some comfort here. So tired of the straight line. And everywhere you turn. There's vultures and thieves at your back. And the storm keeps on twisting. You keep on building the lies. That you make up for all that you lack. It don't make no difference. Escaping one last time. It's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh. This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees. In the arms of the angel. Fly away from here. From this dark cold hotel room. And the endlessness that you feel. You are pulled from the wreckage. Of your silent reverie. You're in the arms of the angel. Maybe you find some comfort here. You're in the arms of the angel. Maybe you find some comfort here
angels,I sit and wait. Does an angel contemplate my fate. And do they know. The places where we go. When we’re gray and old. ’cause I've been told. That salvation lets their wings unfold. So when I’m lying in my bed. Thoughts running through my head. And I feel the love is dead. I’m loving angels instead. And through it all she offers me protection. A lot of love and affection. Whether I’m right or wrong. And down the waterfall. Wherever it may take me. I know that life won’t break me. When I come to call she won’t forsake me. I’m loving angels instead. When I’m feeling weak. And my pain walks down a one way street. I look above. And I know I’ll always be blessed with love. And as the feeling grows. She breathes flesh to my bones. And when love is dead. I’m loving angels instead. And through it all she offers me protection. A lot of love and affection. Whether I’m right or wrong. And down the waterfall. Wherever it may take me. I know that life won’t break me. When I come to call she won’t forsake me. I’m loving angels instead. And through it all she offers me protection. A lot of love and affection. Whether I’m right or wrong. And down the waterfall. Wherever it may take me. I know that life won’t break me. When I come to call she won’t forsake me.

every word you said,Used to think that the world wasn't round. And everyone believed. Then somebody took a leap of faith. And sailed across the sea. Baby I rolled my eyes when you spoke to me on saturday. You said I shouldn't hold back just because I'm afraid. Afraid to know how I feel. When I'm alone at night in bed. And your voice is calling out in my head. I heard every word you said. Every word you said. How do you know me like this. When did you climb over these walls. You figured out my weakness and you barely know me at all. You… diamonds on every finger of my hand. And it's beautiful. So beautiful to know how I feel. When I'm alone at night in bed. And your voice is calling out in my head. I heard every word you said. Every word you said. I was scared and you know. Fear can always bring you down. I'm ready now. To hear everything. Tell me everything. I used to think I'd never find love. But I listened and I believe. I know how it feels. When I'm alone at night in bed. And your voice is calling out in my head. I heard every word you said. I heard every word you said. Every word you said

falling,"Feels like my life's been passing by. With happiness just bein' a lie. How did I get here, where am I going?. One more day without knowing. Struggling for one more breath. As I'm drowning in a painful death. Can someone reach out for me?. In this dark and dreary sea. 'Cause it seems like no one can. Hear the voice that's calling. Try to take the most I can stand. But I keep falling. I try to chase the memories away. But they haunt me everyday. I hope I get over this phase. 'Cause I'm stuck inside this haze. All I need is a simple lift. Such a sweet and precious gift. So I don't lose it all before. What I have left is nothing more. In my isolating misery. I feel like the epitome. Of darkness and despair. Just leading onto nowhere. Will I be able to win this race?. I'm runnin' at a slow pace. Trying hard to press on. But the motivation's gone. 'Cause it seems like no one can. Hear the voice that's calling.

All I need is a simple lift. Such a sweet and precious gift. So I don't lose it all before. What I have left is nothing more. It may not have to be this way. Waiting for me they could be a new day. Maybe I can revise. And escape from the lies. I try to chase the memories away. But they haunt me everyday. I hope I get over this phase. 'Cause I'm stuck inside this haze. All I need is a simple lift. Such a sweet and precious gift. So I don't lose it all before. What I have left is nothing more. There could be something more. To what my life may have in store.

The music seemed to come from afar. Now Josef and his wife Mary. They come to Bethlehem that night. They have no room to bear the child. Not a single room was inside. Hark, now hear the angels sing. A new king born today. And man will live for evermore. Because of Christmas Day. Passing by they found a little nook. In a stable all forlorn. And in a manger cold and dark. Mary's little boy was born. Hark, now hear the angels sing. A new king born today. And man will live for evermore. Because of Christmas Day. Trumpets sound, an angel sing. Listen to what they say.

You say that I don't know what I want. But I worked out just fine. You said it never could be done. But it worked out just fine, oh. You can say anything you want. But it worked out just fine. If it works for me, then it works for me. If it works for me, then it works for me"
you are my song,"You are the song playing so softly. In my heart I reach for you. You seem so near yet so far. I hope and I pray. You'll be with me someday. I know down inside. You are mine and I'm your true love. Or am I dreaming?. How can I?. Each time I try, you say goodbye. You are there. You look my way, I touch the sky. We can share tomorrow and forevermore. I'll be there to love you so. You are my song. You are my song. I know for sure. That we were meant to fall in love. I look in your eyes. I know what you're thinkin' of. I try not to say the words. That might scare you away. 'Cause I know down inside you are mine. And I'm your true love. Please no more dreaming. How can I?. Each time I try, you say goodbye. You are there. You look my way, I touch the sky. We can share tomorrow and forevermore. I'll be there to love you so. You are my song. You are my song. We can share tomorrow and forevermore. I'll be there to love you so. You are my song. You are my song"
you can,"Mmmmm. Take me where I've never been. Help me on my feet again. Show me that good things come to those who wait. Tell me I'm not on my own. Tell me I won't be alone. Tell me what I'm feeling isn't some mistake. 'Cause if anyone can make me fall in love, you can. Save me from myself, you can. And it's you and no one else. If I could wish upon tomorrow tonight would never end. If you asked me I would follow. But for now I'll just pretend. 'Cause if anyone can make me fall in love, you can. Baby, when you look at me. Tell me what do you see. Are these the eyes of someone you could love?. 'Cause everything that brought me here. Well, not it all seems so clear. Baby, you're the one that I've been dreaming of. If anyone can make me fall in love, you can. Save me from myself, you can. And it's you and no one else. If I could wish upon tomorrow tonight would never end. If you asked me I would follow. But for now I'll just pretend. 'Cause if anyone can make me fall in love. Only you can take me sailing in your deepest eyes. Bring me to my knees and make me cry. And no one's ever done this. Everything was just a lie and I know, yes, I know. This is where it all begins. So tell me it will never end. I can't fool myself, it's you and no one else. If I could wish upon tomorrow tonight would never end. If you asked me I would follow. But for now I'll just pretend. 'Cause if anyone can make me fall in love, you can. Show me that good things come to those who wait"
you're the voice,"We have the chance to turn the pages over. We can write what we wanna write. We gotta make ends meet before we get much older. We're all someone's daughter. We're all someone's son. How long can we look at each other. Down the barrel of a gun. CHORUS :. You're the voice, try and understand it. Make a noise and make it clear. We're not gonna sit in silence. We're not gonna live with fear. This time you know we all can stand together. With the power to be powerful. Believing we can make it better. We're all some someone's daughter. We're all someone's son. How long can we look at each other. Down the barrel of a gun. CHORUS. We're all someone's daughter. We're all someone's son. How long can we look at each other. Down the barrel of a gun. REPEAT CHORUS (TO FADE). By KaRoL"
your eyes don't lie,"I saw you yesterday,. It's been a while. You tried but failed. At holdin' back your smile right then. It's not over yet, I knew, for you. (You see). I couldn't sleep. I thought of nothin' else. I needed help. Everyone was tellin' me. You were movin' on with someone else. But what we had was so special. People can be jealous, oh. I had to see it for myself. I can see it in your eyes. You feel the same about us as I. There is no way the truth can be disguised. You're still in love with me. You were never really out of love with me. Your eyes don't lie. I know I hurt ya,. I know you are hurtin' still (mmm, yeah). But I'll make it up to you. Yeah, baby, I will. 'Cause what we had was so special. You know we can't give it up. Now that I'ma lookin' at you I can see. I can see it in your eyes (your eyes). You feel the same about us as I. There is no way (there is no way). The truth can be disguised. You're still in love with me. You were never really out of love with me. Your eyes don't lie. And they never will, girl. Oh, now that I know. We were apart but your heart never let go. So thank you for showin' me with one look. What used to be, and still is, a possibility. I can see it in your eyes. You feel the same about us as I. There is no way the truth can be disguised. You're still in love with me. You were never really out of love with me. Your eyes don't lie. Your eyes don't lie"
zero gravity,"Tell me what you did to me,. Just there beneath my feet.. Didn't even notice we were miles above the ground.. I'm not afraid of heights,. We crashed into the sky,. Didn't know that I could feel the way that I do now.. I'm not asking for an explanation,. All I know is that you take me away,. And you show me how to fly.. Nothing brings me down,. When you're around.. It's like zero gravity.. The world just disappears when you're here,. It's zero gravity.. When things get messed up,. You lift my head up,. I get lost in the clouds.. There's no sence of time with you and I,. It's zero gravity.. The edges fade away,. 'Till there's no more shades of gray,. You only have to whisper anything at all.. You opened up my eyes,. You turned my lows to highs,. And that's the only way that I know how to fall.. Not gonna analyze and try to fight it,. Don't even care if it makes no sense at all,. Cause with you I would fly.. Nothing brings me down,. When you're around.. It's like zero gravity.. The world just disappears when you're here,. It's zero gravity.. When things get messed up,. You lift my head up,. I get lost in the clouds.. There's no sence of time with you and I,. It's zero gravity.. You make it so easy. To just drift away. I can't imagine being without you. Don't think about it. Don't think about it. Don't think about it. Don't think about it. Don't think about it. Nothing brings me down,. When you're around.. It's like zero gravity.. The world just disappears when you're here,. It's zero gravity.. Nothing brings me down,. When you're around.. It's like zero gravity.. The world just disappears when you're here,. It's zero gravity. It's zero gravity. By: Jota"
