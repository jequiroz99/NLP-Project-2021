all through the years,Longing to sail on. Through the night to the stars. On until sunrise. Where the moon hides her tears. All through the years. If I could see the world through someone else's eyes. If I could see through you would I cast you to one side. And if you gave it all would I throw it all away. Like the leaves in autumn winds. From the window in the kitchen. To the fireside by the chair. Sat in familiar surroundings warm night air. Under the bridges that were burning. Before we reached the other side. All the feelings I remember I cannot hide. Not for want of trying. And if you held me here would the moment fade away. Into obscurity like the night becomes the day. For all the broken promises tell me where do I begin. To throw my caution to the wind. Longing to sail on. Through the night to the stars. On until sunrise. Where the moon hides her tears. All through the years. All through the years all through the years. All through the years all through the years. All through the years all through the years.

Kisses the earth and I am found. Love's young dream could be alien. Strange ways how we fly. Tuning low like a radio. Whispering goodbye. Alien, Wo-Ah, alien. Just so it seems. Softly potent, serene. Vacant and shy. Oo-ah, oo-ah, oo-ah. You are everywhere. Under my skin and in my hair. Love's young dream could be alien. Strange ways, how we fly. Tuning low like a radio. Whispering goodbye.

all through the years,Longing to sail on. Through the night to the stars. On until sunrise. Where the moon hides her tears. All through the years. If I could see the world through someone else's eyes. If I could see through you would I cast you to one side. And if you gave it all would I throw it all away. Like the leaves in autumn winds. From the window in the kitchen. To the fireside by the chair. Sat in familiar surroundings warm night air. Under the bridges that were burning. Before we reached the other side. All the feelings I remember I cannot hide. Not for want of trying. And if you held me here would the moment fade away. Into obscurity like the night becomes the day. For all the broken promises tell me where do I begin. To throw my caution to the wind. Longing to sail on. Through the night to the stars. On until sunrise. Where the moon hides her tears. All through the years. All through the years all through the years. All through the years all through the years. All through the years all through the years.

am i right?,Wandering through the back roads. And the rain comes rushing down. To resolve your love. For this man in his twenties. Am I right?. Am I wrong?. Or am I just dreaming?. Climbing up the backstairs. There's a chill wind in the air. I wrap up from the cold. Pull the blinds in the window. Who was there?. Was it you?. Or am I just dreaming?. Look at all the lonely people. Walking miles around the town. I can see the old cathedral. But I have to play it down. Boats along the river. Setting up their sails. And life carries on as normal. Although you're not around. Waiting at the bus stop. Laughing off the rain. Shaking their umbrellas. Till it starts again. Flowers in the water. Floating off downstream. Paper in the gutter. Blowing in the breeze. Am I right?. Am I wrong?. Or am I just dreaming?.

In old England's land. Shattered glass on the ground. There are no words. To console this earth. To restore old England's pride. Never in a million or so years. Did we suffer so much bloodshed. Here comes the man. With the warm and gentle hands. Her name burned into his brow. Scorn in her eyes. Her back to the cries. We spit upon the life. That never was. And here we stand. In old England's land. The rose is choked by it's thorn. She will cast salt for your wound. Old England wears no crown. Never in a million or so years. Did we suffer so much bloodshed. We didn't want to hurt you. But it's not over yet. No never in a million or so years. Did we suffer so much bloodshed.

crying in the rain,"Can you make it alright?. Can you make it okay?. When the talk don't come out right. You're moving further away. Now I feel no pain. I do my crying in the rain. Everybody hurts when you play in the game of love. Stumble and fall, and it's all in the name of love. Words don't come out right. Can you make it okay?. And the way I feel I keep out of sight. Then make the heartbreak fade away. And the nights are long and cold. I want you here my dear, to hold. Everybody hurts when you play in the game of love.

god rest ye merry gentlemen,God rest ye merry gentlemen. Let nothing you dismay. For Jesus Christ our Savior. Was born upon this day. To save us all from Satan's power. When we were gone astray. Oh tidings of comfort and joy. Comfort and joy. Oh tidings of comfort and joy. From God our Heavenly Father. A blessed angel came. When unto certain shepards. Brought tidings of the same. How that in Bethlehem was born. The son of God by name. Oh tidings of comfort and joy. Comfort and joy. Oh tidings of comfort and joy. Now to the Lord sing praises. All you within this place. And with true love and brotherhood. Each other now embrace. This holy tide of Christmas. All under she'll replace. Oh tidings of comfort and joy. Comfort and joy. Oh tidings of comfort and joy. .
golden heart,"Like a bubble that's floating on high above. I won't break down, I won't cry. But the colours are melting, I am fragile. I've been acting so coldly. And hope some day that you will forgive me. You are the one that knows me for who I really am. It'll all be gone in the morning we are lucky. Owe it all to fortune. Golden heart, tears of love. Shining will glow. There's a light at the end there of this tunnel. I am crawling slowly, I am small. What's been up with me lately. Hardly know me whose that in the mirror?. You are the one that knows my moods of joy and anger. Though you've been coping and lonely we are lucky. Owe it all to fortune. Golden heart, tears of love. Shining will glow. Golden heart, tears of love. Shining will glow. Golden heart, tears of love. Shining will glow"
good night,"Sleepless nights don't bother me at all. If dawn comes I won't worry. Something deep inside keeps me awake. I wish that you were here right beside me, woah. I recall when I was very young. And could not go to sleep. My father sang me songs to make me tired. But memories don't make it easier. So goodnight wherever you are sleeping. And I hope that if you dream you dream of me. So goodnight wherever you are sleeping. And I hope that if you dream you dream of me. Now I lie awake and it's no fun. Tossing and turning. I'd call you if it weren't so very late. But telephones don't bring you close to me, woah. I recall the times we stayed up late. Wide awake but still dreaming. There was nothing on this earth could make me tired. But memories don't make it easier. So goodnight wherever you are sleeping. And I hope that if you dream, if you dream, you dream of me. So goodnight wherever you are sleeping. And I hope that if you dream, if you dream, you dream of me. And I hope that if you dream you dream of me."
grace,"Looking in the papers makes me sorry to be human. a little ray of hope won't hurt at all. a price on every head & it's cheaper when you're dead. quality of life may have to fall. Muffled voices, world in action. Stir the peaceful, need for longing. I, I cannot describe the fear inside my heart. I, hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace. Guess it's human nature to be cruel & to be heartless. but that's no excuse to shoot him when he's down. Crawl in on your knees & then bite the hand that feeds. The cages throw their shadows 'cross the ground. Where's the sense in senseless violence. Hear the silence too forgiving. I cannot describe the fear inside my heart. I, hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace. Press your hands in, into the pavement. Bathed in glory, here's your moment. I cannot describe the fear inside my heart. I, hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace. I cannot describe the fear inside my heart. I, hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace."
hallowed ground,"Everybody's intent on killing someone. The streets are closed and there's a kid on the run. The bullets scream out from gun to gun. Everybody's intent on being someone. The cold and darkness of a criminal dawn. Wrapped in blankets gotta keep ourselves warm. A child in the arms of a teenage mum. Who will be there, who will be the next victim. Of the criminal dawn?. Old friends meet on the edge of town. Sharing conversation, hoping things will soon get better. While the children meet, got the world at their feet. Not knowing what's around the corner. Are we living for an uncertain future?. Down on the corner sits a broken man. Lives by the bottle, swears ""never again"". Lost his money on the dogs and gin. Now he looks for his supper in a garbage can. The kids hang around by the old schoolground. Right by the river where the body was found. Throwing stones on hallowed ground. Who will be there, who will be the next victim. Of the criminal dawn?. Old friends meet on the edge of town. Sharing conversation, hoping things will soon get better. While the children meet, got the world at their feet. Not knowing what's around the corner. Are we living for an uncertain future?. In the cold and darkness of a criminal dawn. Wrapped in blankets gotta keep ourselves warm. A child in the arms of a teenage mum. Who will be there, who will be the last victim. Of the criminal dawn?. Old friends meet on the edge of town. Sharing conversation, hoping things will soon get better. While the children meet, got the world at their feet. Not knowing what's around the corner. Are we living for an uncertain future?."

hideaway,One day the boy decided. To let them know the way he felt inside. He could not stand to hide it. His mother she broke down and cried. Oh my father. Why don't you talk to me now. Oh my mother. Do you still cry yourself to sleep. Are you still proud of your little boy. Don't be afraid. You don't have to hide away. The boy he was rejected. By the people that he cared for. It's not what they expected. But he could not keep it secret anymore. Far from home now. Waiting by the telephone. There's a new world. You can make it on your own. Are you still proud of your little boy. Don't be afraid. You don't have to hide away. Don't be afraid. Love will mend your broken wing. Time will slip away. Learn to be brave.
home,"I ain't never going home. 'Cause I'm having a good time. I ain't never going home. 'Cause my time is come. I'll wait for the winter. To lie at my door. White stretches out before me. Leads me to the hall. White circles play within my mind. Ices over and freezes life. Time will come, time will come, time will fall. Bringing the world to its feet. Bringing the world to its feet. I ain't never turning back. 'Cause I've come this far. And I'm lost within my tracks. I will follow the north star. I'll wait till the springtime. Is breathing at my door. The wilderness before me. Heeds the lions roar. White circles play within my mind. Ices over and freezes life. Time will come, time will come, time will fall. Bringing the world to its feet. Bringing the world to her hands and her knees. I'll wait till the winter. Is lying at my door. Time stretches out before me. A stone's throw from the door. White circles play within my mind. Ices over and freezes life. Time will come, time will come, time will fall. Bringing the world to its feet. Bringing the world to her hands and her feet. Bringing the world to its feet. ."

No love lost between us. when i see you things are looking up. and though it's cold, inside I'm warm. devoid of worries, no love is forlorn. CHORUS. how can i say what must remain unspoken. Don't want to spoil all that we said before. So many cry baby hearts to be broken. Don't want to join in with their crazy wars. You tease, I try to please. Though i know I'm not looking my best tonight. Hard pressed, you've had the rest. Of all the choices, time to make your mind up. and though you smile, you're sad inside. but do not worry 'cause i'll make it right. how can i say what must remain unspoken. Don't want to spoil all that we said before. So many cry baby hearts to be broken. Don't want to join in with their crazy wars."
how many times?,Love leave me alone. I've got troubles of my own. I do believe that I have paid the price. For all the things I've said and done. Every little thing that seemed to go wrong. How many times. Will I regret the chances taken?. Why do I end up. Always the one who is mistaken?. Love leave me to sleep. Let me wallow in my dreams. Till the icy past fades away. The dawning of a brand new day. The echoes of the past that still remind me. How many times. Will I regret the chances taken?. Why do I end up. Always the one who is mistaken?.

Ain't that what your mama told ya?. And I coo. Over you. Call me stupid and misunderstood. I've every right to my own persona. I slip and slide. To the other side. And when it gets down to it.

i love saturday,If they´d ever have told me. That I´d find true love in every way. Would I cry ´till tomorrow. Would I keep the non-believers away. Remember that late night last September. When you held me in your arms so tight. I was feeling kind of low my heart was blue. I was empty till you came. But what a...... Saturday night. Things were going right. As right as they´d ever been. I know that you love me. If they´d ever have told me. That I´d find true love in every way. Would I cry till tomorrow. Would I keep the non-believers away. Was I shy was I good with. This foolish heart. Did I try to deny we would fall apart. Like a night in shining armorur you came over. To save me what a bold out of the blue. Just one look into those eyes.

imagination,What do you do with yourself. When you see the storm clouds rising. Feeling alone with yourself. As the sun fades away. The memories come to and fro. The trouble is they never want to go. They come never go. It's just your imagination rolling over the past. It can change your mind completely. It's just my imagination running wild and too fats. But I know it won't defeat me. Look into the eyes of Medusa. And she'll turn your world to stone. She'll tear at your eyes and seduce you. And your soul will be gone. The messages and hidden dreams. Of former lives and lovers never seen. A love never seen. It's just your imagination rolling over the past. It can change your mind completely. It's just my imagination running wild and too fats. But I know it won't defeat me. What do you do with yourself When your lost on some horizon. Taking a hold of yourself. When you know the timing's wrong. The memories come to and fro.

man in the moon,Stories from the deepest. Part of my heart. Delving under cause to wonder. Why am I falling apart. Scattered all around. This topsy turvy room. Will I find the one. Who takes me there too soon. When the night is cold. And you can't find anything. And your will to survive's. At an all time low. The spirit will fly and return. With a new found energy. So keep it within and delight. As your garden grows. Whispered in some lonesome voice. Too afraid to come out of the dark. Sinking down into the covers. Sleep to the beat of your heart. Spinning all around. This most peculiar room. Will I find the one. Who takes me there too soon. Do be kind. And civilised. And don't descend. Into the dark abyss. And the man up in the moon is shining. Good fortune down on me. And the man up in the moon is shining. Sweet love. Sweet love.
march on down the line,"Lover out my way. I'll stand up to anything. Move on out this heartbeat. The sun is over. A new day, a new way. I'm coming out this time. A new name, let's play the game. And march on down the line. I've got lots to share. About the way I feel inside. Round and round this place. Like a shotgun fire. A new day, a new way. I'm coming out this time. A new name, let's play the game. And march on down the line. (A-ha let's play the game). A new day, a new way. I'm coming out this time. A new name, let's play the game. And march on down the line. Now the fight is won. Stand attendant and tall again. God is on our side. Dance on up to heaven. A new day, a new way. I'm coming out this time. A new name, let's play the game. And march on down the line. (A-ha let's play the game). A new day, a new way. I'm coming out this time. A new name, let's play the game. And march on down the line. A new day, a new way. I'm coming out this time. A new name, let's play the game. And march on down the line."
miracle,It won't be easy it wont be hard. To find the reason to find the rhyme. To get your feet back on the ground. To get your feet back on the ground. Well be going home. Where the passion. Finds the perfect love. Finds the perfect love. Well be going home. Where the passion. Covers me with love. Covers me with love. It won't be out there it cant be far. Falls like a teardrop to the star. A wall of silence all around. A wall of silence all around. The miracle of love. Blinds me with your charms. The miracle of love. Take me in your arms
moon and the sky,"All of a sudden it's gone. Too late to wish a friend farewell. Heard the sea in a shell. Said we would meet in other worlds. See how the moon, she cries. Cool how the tears fill up the sky as snow. Gotta touch the sky. Hold you head in my hand. A taste, a wish, a parting sigh. Takes the boat across the water. Heaves a gentle sigh. See how the moon, she cries. Cool how the tears fill up the sky as snow. Gotta touch the sky. All of a sudden it's gone. Too late to wish a friend farewell. Heard the sea in a shell. Said we would meet in other worlds. See how the moon, she cries. Cool how the tears fill up the sky as snow. Gotta touch the sky. Gotta touch the sky. Gotta touch the sky."
my heart...so blue,I've got her picture. It's there on the wall. I can't remember why. I keep it at all. The doors are cold and. All the windows seem grey. I write the book. There's so much more I should say. Wave goodbye. See my heart...so blue. Wave goodbye. See my heart...so blue. And now it's over. I write it all down. No one to notice. One less face in the crowd. Our eyes are open. When it suits us to say. Dear God in heaven. Show no mercy to me. Wave (wave) goodbye. See my heart...so blue. Wave (wave) goodbye. Lost for you. I shed no tears. And there's no reason for shame. A small consolation. Hides a stone with her name. Just a victim. Still the light shines all bright. I've got her picture. Think I'll hold it tonight. Wave goodbye. See my heart...so blue. Wave goodbye. See my heart...so blue. Wave (wave) goodbye. See my heart...so blue. Wave (wave) goodbye. Lost for you.

I'm dying to show you what love is about. The tears that are falling. There's no room for doubt. For all the changes we've been through. It's an art just to give, will I learn?. To visualize what you want from my life. It's more than enough just to gaze in your eyes. I'm dying to show you what love is about. To tease you and please you. We must work it out. I know all your secrets so sad. For all the changes we've been through"

perchance to dream,"Perchance to dream. Dive into the wall of sound, yeah. Crashing all over me. Turning my world upside-down. And then I see, and I start to breathe. As if for the first time. Suddenly, as calm as can be. Sky full of wonder, tears asunder. Climb through the car. Falling up to meet the road. Something in my head will explode. Oh baby gee. Won't you come and share the world with me. Time with me. Tears on a tin box. I tear out tinder to strike it with, yeah. A little spark is satisfied. Lights up the soft wood. And then I see, and I start to breathe. The mountain in moonshine. Stars on my breath, scares me the best. Flickering mellow shadows. Climb through the air. Falling up to brush the clouds. Static in my hair I blush out loud. Oh baby gee. Won't you come and share the world with me. Time with me. And then I see, and I start to breathe. As if for the first time. Suddenly, as calm as can be. Sky full of wonder, tears me under. Climb through the car. Falling up to meet the road. Something in my head will explode. Oh baby gee. Won't you come and share the world with me. Some time with me. Oh baby gee. Won't you come and share the world with me. Time with me."
perfect stranger,Hell I gave up my time. For a no good affair. You'd think I'd learned by now. To be taken in. By a perfect stranger. Would that I had the know how. Still more fool me. For kidding myself. That's the way it should be. Maybe I should grow up. Would I feel confined to the same space. Or would I feel that I talked myself into a corner. So long you're no friend of mine. You're false and unkind. You're indestructible. No place I'd rather be. Than in the ring with you. We'd go twenty rounds. Still more fool me. For killing myself. That's the way it should be. Maybe I should grow up. Would I feel confined to the same space. Or would I feel that I talked myself into a corner. I see the sky move above me. But I just can't take control. What a sweet sensation. Love sweet sweet love. Oh I feel so bad.
phantom bride,"She was a shy girl from the lonely street. She had no job to do and no friends to meet. She'd sit in silence in her rented room. Dream of her childhood and invented truths. And in her mind she'd drift away. A secret place to steal away. Don't you cry, don't you cry. Let me wipe away the tears from your eyes. Don't you cry, don't you cry. Let me wipe away the tears from your eyes. He was a good boy from the upside of town. Said he could treat her right said he could win her round. Her morning sickness and the kick inside.

piano song,"These are minor, but important changes.... . Never get angry at the stupid people. Though I go crazy at the dullness of my life. Sit and I stare into a dusty window. An empty face stares back at me and cries. My vulnerability rushes up to me. And I'm left here. The rebel without a cause. The deeper I delve into. The consciousness of me with you. The harder it gets. I need to close my eyes. What hurts me most. I'll never see your eyes again. Though I get weary. Doesn't mean that I'm unwilling. My body belies me I'm of fertile mind. As I grow older. The world forgets me. And talks to me as if I'm some kind of child. Their insensitivity washes over me. Till I'm left here. The rebel without a cause. The deeper I delve into. The consciousness of me and you. The harder it gets. I need to close my eyes. What hurts me most. I'll never see your eyes again. The harder it gets. I need to close my eyes. I can't recollect. I'll never see your eyes again. I try to forget. I'll never see your eyes again. What hurts me most. I'll never see your eyes again. Don't touch me."

You keep on eating cars. Then when there's no more cars you go out at night. And eat up bars where the people meet. Face to face. Dance cheek to cheek. One to one. Man to man. Dance toe to toe.

We'll have to go down. Before innocence is lost. And I dream you're with me. You hold me sweetly. And rock me gently to sleep. In your arms. I've been getting used to all the crying. And the games that you play. And if I carry on I'm gonna end up with a. Hole in my head. And there's more to life. Than thrills & spills & dollar bills. We'll have to get through. Some way some how. And I dream you're with me. You hold me sweetly. And rock me gently to sleep. In your arms.
run to the sun,"Run to the sun. For the first time in my life. I'm up to run away. It's not a choice that I made easily. It's not that I'm ashamed. To face the light of day.

Can you feel pain. ."

Took everything left you in the background. Gave it up. You gave enough. I couldn't help the way I was thinking. How did it feel. When I let you down?. Spending your time wasted it on me. The higher we climbed the further we fell to the floor. Now ""sorry"" won't be heard or make amends. I'd give my all to hold you once again"

So I went from day to day. Tho' my life was in a rut. 'Till I thought of what I'd say. Which connection I should cut. I was feeling part of the scenery. I walked right out of the machinery. My heart was going boom boom boom. ""Hey,"" he said, ""grab your things, I've come to take you home."". Yeah back home. When illusion spin her net. I'm never where I want to be. And liberty she pirouette. When I think that I am free. Watched by empty silhouettes. Who close their eyes, but still can see. No one taught them etiquette. I will show another me. Today I don't need a replacement. I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant. My heart was going boom boom boom. ""Hey,"" I said, ""You can keep my things, they've come to take me home.""."

It's not the way that you caress me. Toy with my affection. It's not my sense of emptiness. You fill with your desire. Climb in bed beside me. We can lock the world outside. Touch me, satisfy me. Warm your body next to mine. Ooh sometimes......"

Sail away I am learning my lesson. Mama sends her love and Godspeed you come home. One little white lie. Was enough to conceal my goodbye. Then I stole away kissed her farewell. And wished her the best for her life. Then I stole away woah like a thief in the night. I'm just saying not behind daddy's back. He takes care of her in his overtime. He's no saint I know as he goes around the town. Watch him cry himself to sleep, he's my daddy. Sail away, I will go it alone now. Leave my past behind to seek fortune and fame. One little white lie. Was enough to conceal my goodbye. Then I stole away kissed her farewell. And wished her the best for her life. Then I stole away woah like a thief in the night. Sail away, there's a storm in a teacup. Mama sends her love and Godspeed you come home. One little white lie. Was enough to conceal my goodbye. Then I stole away kissed her farewell. And wished her the best for her life. Then I stole away woah like a thief in the night. One little white lie. Was enough to conceal my goodbye. Then I stole away like a prodigal son. And wished her the best for her life. Then I stole away woah like a thief in the night"
sucker for love,"I'm a sucker for love, all that's artificial. Sometimes below, the belt I hit you. For without love, hell freezes over. And wherever you go searching know I'll want some. Give me back my calling cards and vices. My dignity and romance novels too. The love we have is for the better now. The love we have is for the better now. The love we have is for the better now. The love we have is for the better now. If you wanna know the truth. I'm feeling open ended. For without love, I'm not tremendous. The world we share, it's not pretending. And whenever you go AWOL know I'll be there. Give me back the photographs I sent you. My residence and cool emotion too. The love we have is for the better now. The love we have is for the better now. The love we have is for the better now. The love we have is for the better now. You gotta ride ride ride ride ride. The love we have is for the better now.

sunday girl,Blinded by the vision. I turn and face my back to the wall. Cause I'm locked up in a rhythm. The prism of a big glitter ball. Wrapped around your finger. I'm caught up in the middle with you baby. With some laughter and drinking. There's very little else I can do. Then I go and drop a bombshell upon you. I been making eyes at somebody else. You're no longer number one. She loves the night and all that glitters. Her name in lights around the city. Don't you mess your life up Sunday girl. You rushing down like a roller-coaster. Night on the town gonna make the most of. We can dance till Sunday morning girl. You pushing and a shoving me. Baby like a bitch to the wall. But you're driving me crazy. Right up to fever pitch I could fall. When you shine down your love-light. I'm getting blinded by the sight and sound. She loves the night and all that glitters. Her name in lights around the city. Don't you mess your life up Sunday girl. Then I go and drop a bombshell upon you. I been making eyes at somebody baby. You're no longer number one. She loves the night and all that glitters. Her name in lights around the city. Don't you mess your life up Sunday girl. You rushing down like a roller-coaster. Night on the town gonna make the most of. We can dance till Sunday morning. We can dance till Sunday morning. We can dance till Sunday morning girl

take me back,Take me back to the place. Where I once belonged. This could be anyplace a place. Where you and I could sing this song. Take me back where I hear waterfalls flowing. Let me dive into the lake. Where winter hides the snow. Then comes the summertime. Fields of scarlet poppies grow. Take me back where I see butterflies toing froing. Let me sleep a little while. Underneath the trees. And dream of dragonflies. Where the weary willow weeps for me. Take me back where I see dandelions blowing. And the river flows. I am never gonna take it back again. And the river flows. I am never gonna get it back again. We don't know anything. Trapped in a world full of strangers. Please don't tell me anything. I'd rather fall into you.

the circus,Call it new technology. And they use it to burn. And they show no concern. Work for their prosperity. While the big wheels turn. Now it's too late to learn. Don't upset the teacher. Though we know he lied to you. Don't upset the preacher. Gonna close his eyes for you. And it's a shame. That you're so afraid. Just a worker waiting. In the pouring rain. Putting back the pieces. Of a broken dream. Father worked in industry. Now the work has moved on. And the factories gone. See them sell your history. Where once you were strong. And you used to belong. There was once a future. For a working man. There was once a lifetime. For a skilful hand. Yesterday. Don't upset the teacher. Though we know he lied to you. Don't upset the preacher. Gonna close his eyes for you. Tempers fray so easily. In desperate despair. Is there anyone that cares. Just another tragedy. Just a personal affair. In a room somewhere. There was once a future. For a working man. There was once a lifetime. For a skilful hand. Yesterday.

turns the love to anger,"Lest we forget. The speed at which the world is turning. Careering through space and time. On her fatalistic journey. It scares me half to death. That we tear ourselves apart. A war of love or religion. Close your eyes to the screaming. Now, are we pleased?. How are we free?. See how this obsession. Turns the love to anger. East calling west. Falling onto stony ground. We are lost in our vision. We are primitive and fearless. We send our message of confusion. Across the great divide. With our eyes full of wonder. Still the world goes spinning by. Now, are we pleased?. How are we free?. See how this obsession. Turns the love to anger. Love is where the dream should lie. It's not for us to reason why. Or to ponder over strategy. So come with us and take a ride. Somewhere in the big blue sky. Before it's too late, it's too late, it's too late. Hope you find it baby. What you're looking for. Doesn't really matter. If you're rich or poor. 'Cause you've had your day. Yes you had your day. Now, are we pleased?. How are we free?. See how this obsession. Turns the love to anger."
victim of love,-Chorus:. I don't wanna look. Like some kind of fool. I don't wanna break. My heart over you. I'm building a wall. Everyday it's getting higher. This time I won't end up. Another victim of love. You say that I could. Show some emotion. That I've been. Keeping secrets from you. But I can see through. All your sweet talk. And all of your affection untrue. I'm gonna find you out. If I scream and I shout. You won't break down my protection. Chorus. I'm gonna lock up. What I'm feeling inside. Ain't no way you can. Break down the door. Cause this time I've learned my lesson. You can take this declaration of war. Step right back. Put on your coat and your hat. Gonna avoid all complications. Chorus.
