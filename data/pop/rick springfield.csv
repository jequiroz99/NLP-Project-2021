souls,"SOULS. It all started here, she was a girl form the Midwest. He was a stranger in a strange land. Same old story. He came for the glory. She came looking for a young man's hand. But they found bright lights. And endless nights. And men just used her innocent ways. He found it all so pretty, hypnotized by the city. They lost sight of the reason. They lost count of the days. And they were two Souls searching for each other. One spirit looking for the other. Caught between a hard hard place and a rock. Two Souls searching for heaven. Rolling the dice looking for a seven. To the tick, tick, ticking of time. Gotta beat the clock. Too many nights on the ledge. He acquired a knife-edge. Still the city didn't acquiesce to his demands. Some nights she cried for pity in the heart of the city. The city smacked her hands. He met her one endless night. Her eyes had a light. There was something familiar about the smell of her skin. He held her tighter and tighter. As he danced inside her. She knew from the moment that she let him in. They'd been two Souls searching for each other. One spirit looking for the other. Caught between a hard hard place and a rock. Two Souls searching for heaven. Rolling the dice looking for a seven. To the tick, tick, ticking of time. Gotta beat the clock. Beat the clock.
