who i really am,"I've been thinking about all the things I did. The protagonist of my shit should be me. I ain't lying. I'm just trying to make me feel a little bit better. People saying bullshit that they don't even know. It's so hard, but I am tired, I'll just let it go. Now I'm stronger. in this game I guess I know who is the winner. That's enough this show of hiding what I have inside. I am taking off this social mask that lock me down. Now I'm wiser, I decided to be. Who I really am, who I really am. I need to live, I need to breathe. Who I really am, Fight for me. People saying bullshit that they don't even know. It's so hard, but I am tired, I'll just let it go.
