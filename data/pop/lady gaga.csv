shallow (with bradley cooper),"Tell me somethin' girl. Are you happy in this modern world?. Or do you need more?. Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?. I'm falling. In all the good times I find myself longing for change. And in the bad times I fear myself. Tell me something boy. Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?. Or do you need more?. Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?. I'm falling. In all the good times I find myself longing for change. And in the bad times I fear myself. I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in. I'll never meet the ground. Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us. We're far from the shallow now. In the shallow, shallow. In the shallow, shallow. In the shallow, shallow. We're far from the shallow now. Wooaah. Woaah. I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in. I'll never meet the ground. Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us. We're far from the shallow now. In the shallow, shallow. In the shallow, shallow. In the shallow, shallow. We're far from the shallow now"
always remember us this way,That Arizona sky. Burnin' in your eyes. You look at me and babe I wanna catch on fire. It's buried in my soul. Like California gold. You found the light in me that I couldn't find. So when I'm all choked up. and I can't find the words. Every time we say goodbye baby it hurts. When the sun goes down. And the band won't play. I'll always remember us this way. Lovers in the night. Poets tryin' to write. We don't know how to rhyme but damn we try. But all I really know. You're where I wanna go. The part of me that's you will never die. So when I'm all choked up. and I can't find the words. Every time we say goodbye baby it hurts. When the sun goes down. And the band won't play. I'll always remember us this way. Oh yeah. I don't wanna be just a memory baby yeah. Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo. Oo oo oo oo hoo hoo hoo. Oo oo oo oo hoo hoo hoo. So when I'm all choked up. and I can't find the words. Every time we say goodbye baby it hurts. When the sun goes down and the band won't play. I'll always remember us this way. Way yeah. When you look at me and the whole world fades. I'll always remember us this way. Oouu hmm. OOuu hmm
i'll never love again,"Wish I could. I could have said goodbye. I would have said what I wanted to. Maybe even cried for you. If I knew it would be the last time. I would have broke my heart in two. Tryin' to save a part of you. Don't want to feel another touch. Don't want to start another fire. Don't want to know another kiss. No other name falling off my lips. Don't want to give my heart away. To another stranger. Or let another day begin. Won't even let the sunlight in. No I'll never love again. I'll never love again. OOuu oou oou. When we first met. I never thought that I would fall. I never thought that I'd find myself lyin' in your arms. And I wanna pretend that it's not true. Oh, baby that you're gone. Cause my world keeps turnin' and turnin' and turnin'. and I'm not movin' on. Don't want to feel another touch. Don't want to start another fire. Don't want to know another kiss. No other name falling off my lips. Don't want to give my heart away. To another stranger. Or let another day begin. Won't even let the sunlight in. No I'll never love. I don't wanna know this feeling unless it's you and me. I don't wanna waste a moment. And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me. I would rather wait for you. Don't want to feel another touch. Don't want to start another fire. Don't want to know another kiss. Baby unless they are your lips. Don't want to give my heart away to another stranger. Or let another day begin. Won't even let the sunlight in. OO I'll never love again. Love again. I'll never love again. I'll never love. Again. I won't I won't I swear I can't. I wish I could but I just won't. I'll never love again. I'll never love. Again"

born this way,"(Intro:). ""This is the manifesto of Mother Monster. On Goat, a government-owned alien territory and space. A birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place. But the birth was not finite. It was infinite. As the womb slumbered. And the mitosis of the future began. It was perceived that this infamous moment in life. is not temporal. It is eternal. And thus began the beginning of the new race. A race within the race of humanity. A race which bares no prejudice. No judgement, but boundless freedom. But on that same day. As the eternal mother hovered in the multiverse. Another more terrifying birth took place. The birth of evil. And as she herself split into two. Rotating in agony between two ultimate forces. The pendulum of joice began its dance. It seems easy to imagine. To gravitate instantly and unwaveringly towards good. But she wondered:. How can I protect something so perfect without evil?"". It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M. Just put your paws up. 'Cause you were born this way, baby. My mama told me when I was young. We are all born superstars. She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on. In the glass of her boudoir. 'There's nothin wrong with lovin who you are'. She said, 'cause he made you perfect, babe'. 'So hold your head up girl and you'll go far. Listen to me when I say'. I'm beautiful in my way. 'cause god makes no mistakes. I'm on the right track baby. I was born this way. Don't hide yourself in regret. Just love yourself and you're set. I'm on the right track baby. I was born this way. Ooo there ain't no other way. Baby, I was born this way. Baby, I was born this way.

Don't be a drag - just be a queen. Don't be!. Give yourself prudence. And love your friends. Subway kid, rejoice your truth. In the religion of the insecure. I must be myself, respect my youth. A different lover is not a sin. Believe capital H-I-M (hey hey hey). I love my life I love this record and. Mi amore vole fe yah (love needs faith). I'm beautiful in my way. 'cause god makes no mistakes. I'm on the right track baby. I was born this way. Don't hide yourself in regret. Just love yourself and you're set. I'm on the right track baby. I was born this way.

And father will be pacing the floor. Listen to that fireplace roar. So really I'd better scurry. Beautiful, please don't hurry. Well, maybe just a half a drink more. Put some records on while I pour. And the neighbors might think - baby it's bad out there. Say, what's in this drink? - no cabs to be had out there. I wish I knew how - your eyes are like starlight now. To break the spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell. I ought to say no, no, no sir. Mind if I move in closer?. At least I'm gonna say that I tried. What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?. I really can't stay - baby don't hold out. Baby but it's cold outside. I simply must go - but baby it's cold outside. The answer is no - but baby, it's cold outside. The welcome has been - how lucky that you dropped in. So nice and warm - look out that window, man that's hard. My sister will be suspicious. Gosh, your lips look delicious. My brother will be there at the door. Waves upon a tropical shore. My maiden aunt's mind is vicious. Gosh, your lips are delicious. Well maybe just a cigarette more. Oh, never such a blizzard before. I've got to go home - baby, you'll freeze out there. Say, lend me your coat - it's up to your knees out there. You've really been grand - I thrill when you touch my hand. But don't you see - how can you do this thing to me. There's bound to be talk tomorrow. Think of my lifelong sorrow. At least there will be plenty implied. If you caught pneumonia and died.

bang bang (my baby shot me down),"I was five and he was six. We rode on horses made of sticks. He wore black and I wore white. He would always win the fight. Bang bang, he shot me down. Bang bang, I hit the ground. Bang bang, that awful sound. Bang bang, my baby shot me down. Seasons came and changed the time. When I grew up I called him mine. He would always laugh and say. Remember when we used to play. Bang bang, I shot you down. Bang bang, you hit the ground. Bang bang, that awful sound. Bang bang, I used to shoot you down. Music played and people sang. Just for me the church bells rang. Now he's gone I don't know why. Until this day, sometimes I cry. He didn't even say goodbye. He didn't take the time to lie. Bang bang, he shot me down. Bang bang, I hit the ground. Bang bang, that awful sound. Bang bang, my baby shot me down"

"bewitched, bothered and bewildered (with tony bennett)","After one whole quart of brandy. Like a daisy, I'm awake. With no bromo-seltzer handy. I don't even shake. Men are not a new sensation. I've done pretty well I think. But this half-pint imitation. Put me on the blink. I'm wild again, beguiled again. A simpering, whimpering child again. Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I. Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep. When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep. Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I. Lost my heart, but what of it. He is cold I agree. He can laugh, but I love it. Although the laugh's on me. I'll sing to him, each spring to him. And long, for the day when I'll cling to him. Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I. He's a fool and don't I know it. But a fool can have his charms. I'm in love and don't I show it. Like a babe in arms. Love's the same old sad sensation. Lately I've not slept a wink. Since this half-pint imitation. Put me on the blink. I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot. But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot. Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I. I'll sing to him, each spring to him. And worship the trousers that cling to him. Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I. When he talks, he is seeking. Words to get, off his chest. Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best. Vexed again, perplexed again. Thank God, I can be oversexed again. Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I. Wise at last, my eyes at last. Are cutting you down to your size at last. Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more. Burned a lot, but learned a lot. And now you are broke, so you earned a lot. Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more. Couldn't eat, was dispeptic. Life was so hard to bear. Now my heart's antiseptic. Since you moved out of there. Romance, finis. Your chance, finis. Those ants that invaded my pants, finis. Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more"

born this way,"(Intro:). ""This is the manifesto of Mother Monster. On Goat, a government-owned alien territory and space. A birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place. But the birth was not finite. It was infinite. As the womb slumbered. And the mitosis of the future began. It was perceived that this infamous moment in life. is not temporal. It is eternal. And thus began the beginning of the new race. A race within the race of humanity. A race which bares no prejudice. No judgement, but boundless freedom. But on that same day. As the eternal mother hovered in the multiverse. Another more terrifying birth took place. The birth of evil. And as she herself split into two. Rotating in agony between two ultimate forces. The pendulum of joice began its dance. It seems easy to imagine. To gravitate instantly and unwaveringly towards good. But she wondered:. How can I protect something so perfect without evil?"".

brooklyn nights,"I always thought it was you. You always thought it was me. We always thought we were it. Seemed like a real perfect fit. Those Brooklyn Nights set us free. I always thought even though. We were so young we could grow. Up in the end it'd be us. We'd take the F or the bus. Where Brooklyn Nights set us free. It's not that I don't wanna love you. It's not that I'm really over it, you know (you know). It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death. When we used to be. Brooklyn Nights happy. I miss our cheap chandalier. 'Member when dad hung it there?. And we would watch Rocky IV. The one where the Russian scored. I loved Brigitte Nielsen's hair. I'd call you my champion. Thought we had already won. And cracked open our last beer. Falling asleep in our tears. Those Brooklyn Nights set us free. It's not that I don't wanna love you. It's not that I'm really over it, you know (you know). It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death. When we used to be. Brooklyn Nights happy. I found an old pair of. Keys in my purse that opened. The walkup we shared. How did they get there, jerk?. I wanna see you there. I wanna make it work. I didn't brush my hair. And my lashes are falling. Off of seven years. Of our bad luck dating. I want one last night there. A Brooklyn Night affair. A Brooklyn Night affair. It's not that I don't wanna love you. It's not that I'm really over it, you know (you know). It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death. When we used to be. Brooklyn Nights happy. It's not that I don't want to love you. 'Cause I really tried, and I. Just wanna hang with the old you. For just one Brooklyn Night adieu. Have a drink with your former self. We both won't act like someone else. Maybe then we'd both tell the truth. For just one Brooklyn Night adieu"

david bowie tribute (grammy 2016),"Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Check ignition, and may God's love be with you. This is ground control to Major Tom.

Then we were Ziggy's band. Oh don't lean on me man, cause you can't afford the ticket. I'm back from Suffragette City. Oh don't lean on me man. Cause you ain't got time to check it. You know my Suffragette City. Is outta sight. Suffragette City. You've got your mother in a whirl. She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl. Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress.

(Under pressure). Let's dance. Put on your red shoes and dance the blues. Let's dance. To the song they're playin' on the radio. If you say run, I'll run with you. If you say hide, we'll hide. Because my love for you. Would break my heart in two. If you should fall. Into my arms. And tremble like a flower. I, I will be king. And you, you will be queen. Though nothing will drive them away. We can beat them, just for one day. We can be Heroes, just for one day. We can be Heroes, just for one day. We can be Heroes. We can be Heroes. We can be Heroes. We can be Heroes just for one day.

don't give up (the midway state feat. lady gaga),"In this proud land we grew up strong. We were wanted all along. I was taught to fight, taught to win. I never thought I could fail.

Don't give up. You're not beaten yet. Don't give up. I know you can make it good. Though I saw it all around. Never thought I could be affected. Thought that we'd be the last to go. It is so strange the way things turn. Drove the night toward my home. The place that I was born, on the lakeside. As daylight broke, I saw the earth. The trees had burned down to the ground. Don't give up. You still have us. Don't give up. We don't need much of anything. Don't give up. Cause somewhere there's a place. Where we belong. Rest your head. You worry too much. It's going to be alright. When times get rough. You can fall back on us. Don't give up. Please don't give up. Got to walk out of here. I can't take anymore. Going to stand on that bridge. Keep my eyes down below. Whatever may come. And whatever may go. That rivers flowing. That rivers flowing. Moved on to another town. Tried hard to settle down. For every job, so many men. So many men no-one needs. Don't give up. Cause you have friends. Don't give up. You're not the only one. Don't give up. You still have us. Don't give up. We're proud of who you are. Don't give up.

don't wait to long (with tony bennett),"You are the summer and I am the autumn. Don't wait too long. Your song's beginning while. Mine has been sung. Don't wait too long. Fall is a lovely time of the year. When the leaves turn to gold and brown. But soon fall is ending and winter is near. And the leaves start tumblin' down. Why must the moments go by in such haste?. Don't wait too long. Winter is coming, I've no time to waste. Don't wait too long. So while my heart's gay and foolish. And free and still can sing its song. Share every precious moment with me. Don't wait too long"

One voice forever. we'll live together in peace, love,. Solitude and happiness. Electric Kiss. Fame is our felony. We're so in love with it. Some superstars and masochists. Who dont know where to go. But the poets and the fighters of our time. Put down their weapons and their rounds. And know what they must do. They're gonna start a resistance. They want independence.

From major to minor. Every time we say goodbye

(freezer burn, freezer burn). Making out in this ice box 'til we get freezer burn. (freezer burn, freezer burn). Let's keep on, (keep) on freezin'. Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'. Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn. (freezer burn, freezer burn). Sweat drippin' up our bodies, breathin' small. While you're whispering to me. Ice crystal in this small, small bed. But we make frost when we're touching like that.. Laying here with no blanket. The room's temperature is sub-zero. Baby bring your body closer. 'Cause you keep me warm when you're naked. Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn. (freezer burn, freezer burn). Making out in this ice box 'til we get feezer burn. (freezer burn, freezer burn). Let's keep on, keep on freezin'. Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'. Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn. (freezer burn, freezer burn). Snowflakes at the tip of my fingers.. Frozen in time, our love lingers. Livin' in a world so cold,. Sometimes our hearts are just like icicles. Being with you is all I need. There's nothing we can't handle babe. Lay on my chest, please cover me. Deep frost, on this bed memories. Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn. (freezer burn, freezer burn). Making out in this ice box 'til we get feezer burn. (freezer burn, freezer burn). Let's keep on, keep on freezin'. Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'. Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn. (freezer burn, freezer burn). Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn. (freezer burn, freezer burn). Making out in this ice box 'til we get feezer burn. (freezer burn, freezer burn). Let's keep on, keep on freezin'. Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'.

I think it's really fucking great that she's such a star,. a big beautiful star in the sky, but how am I supposed to shine?. I mean, I think I'd be okay with it, you know,. if I felt like she really was being herself with me.. And maybe she is. I'm starting to think she is,. 'cause when she gets on the stage, she holds nothing back ?. that spotlight, that big rounded spotlight. follows her everywhere she goes.. Sometimes I think it follows her home. I know it does.. I got to get in there.. When she fucks, it's like she covers her face. 'cause she doesn't want me to see,. but she can't stand to have one honest moment. where nobody's watching..

lush life,I used to visit all the very gay places. those come what may places. where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life. to get the feel of life. from jazz and cocktails. the girls I knew had sad. and sullen gray faces. with distingué traces. that used to be there you could see where. they'd been washed away. by too many through the day. twelve o'clocktails. then you came along with your siren's song. to tempt me to madness. I thought for a while that your pointed smile. was tinged with the sadness. of a great love for me. ah yes I was wrong. again I was wrong. life is lonely again. and only last year. everything seemed so assured. now life is awful again. and the thoughtful of heart. could only be a bore. a week in paris will ease the bite of it. all I care is to smile in spite of it. I'll forget you I will. and yet you are still. burning inside my brain. romance is mush. stifling those who strive. I'll live a lush life. in some small dive. and there I'll be. while I rot with the rest. of those whose lives are lonely too

marry the night: the prelude pathétique,"When I look back on my life. It's not that I don't want to see things exactly as they happened. It's just that I prefer to remember them in an artistic way. And truthfully, the lie of it all is much more honest. Because I invented it. Clinical psychology tells us, arguably, that trauma is the ultimate killer. Memories are not recycled like atoms and particles in quantum physics. They can be lost forever. It's sort of like my past is an unfinished painting. And as the artist of that painting. I must fill in all the ugly holes. And make it beautiful again. It's not that I've been dishonest. It's just that I loathe reality. For example, those nurses. They're wearing next season Calvin Klein. And so am I. And the shoes, custom Giuseppe Zanotti. I tipped their gauze caps to the side like parisian berets. Because I think it's romantic. And I also believe that mint will be very big in fashion next spring. Check out this nurse on the right. She's got a great ass. Bam. The truth is, back then at the clinic. They only wore those funny hats to keep the blood out of their hair. And that girl on the left. She ordered gummy bears and a knife a couple of hours ago. They only gave her the gummy bears. I'd wished they'd only given me the gummy bears..."

Touch me and play what you feel. Love let your music be mine. Sing while I harmonize. Let your melodies fly in my direction. Take me to your paradise. On a musical ride. I'm in love with your music baby. You're music to my eyes

Is just to love and be loved in return"". And then one day. One magic day he passed my way. And while we spoke of many things. Fools and kings. This he said to me.

But I just close my eyes and dream. You cant deny me my astronomy. Hey in every mystery, there's a truth. You know I'm tellin', I'm tellin' you-. No matter lightning or thunder,. Buckets of rainwater. You can't flood this town. In a world unknown. You've gotta hold your own. And you can't stop me-. You're never ever ever gonna stop me now. Go ahead and don't believe.

over the rainbow (with patti labelle),"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high. There's a land that I've heard of. Once in a lullaby. Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue. And the dreams that you dare to dream. Really do come true. Some day I'll wish upon a star. And wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Where troubles melt like lemon drops. Away above the chimny tops. That's where you'll find me. Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly. Birds fly over the rainbow. Why, then, oh why can't I?. If happy little blue birds fly. Beyond the rainbow. Why oh why, can't I?"

pout-pourri speechless/ your song (with elton john - live at the grammys),"[Lady Gaga]. I can't believe how you looked at me. With your James Dean glossy eyes. [Elton John]. In your tight jeans with your long hair. And your cigarette stained lies. And I know that it's complicated. [Lady Gaga]. But I'm a loser in love. So baby. [Elton John]. Raise a glass to mend. [Lady Gaga]. All the broken hearts. Of all my wrecked up friends. [Elton John]. I'll never talk again. Oh boy you've left me speechless. You've left me speechless, so speechless. [Lady Gaga]. I'll never love again. Oh friend you've left me speechless. You've left me speechless, so speechless. And you can tell everybody this is your song. [Lady Gaga]. I hope you don't mind. [Elton john]. I hope you don't mind. And after all the boys and girls that we've been through. [Lady Gaga]. Would you give it all up?. [Elton John]. Could you give it all up?. [Lady Gaga]. If I promise boy, to you. [Elton John]. And you can tell everybody this is your song. [Lady Gaga]. It may be quite simple but now that it's done. I hope you don't mind. [Elton John]. I hope you don't mind that I put down in words. How wonderful life is with Gaga in the world. [Lady Gaga]. I'll never write a song. Won't even sing along. Thank you, love you. Sir Elton John...

princess die,"Leave the coffin open when I go. Leave my pearls and lipstick on so everybody knows. Pretty will be the photograph I leave. Laying down on famous knives so everybody sees. Bleach out all the dark. I'll swallow each peroxide shot. Someone I'll know could love and save me from myself. Maybe I'll just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes. I'll be your Princess Die and die with you. I wish that I was strong. I wish that I was wrong. I wish that I could cope. But I took pills and left a note. I'm hungry from an anorexic heart. I've been trying to tell you how I feel. But was never very smart. I'm wrapped in silks made for Egyptian queens. I'll do it in the swimming pool so everybody sees. Bleach out all the dark. I'll swallow each peroxide shot. Volumes I know will love and save me from myself. Maybe I'll just keep clean the shit off of these fancy shoes. I'll be your Princess Die and die with you. Princess Die. I want to see her cry. Princess Die. Princess Die, we want to watch her cry. Princess Die. I wish that I was strong. I wish that I was wrong. I wish that I could cope. But I took pills and left a note. I wish that I would go in my rich boyfriend's limo. Right after he proposed with a 16-carat stone. Wrapped in rose gold. With the paparazzi all swarming around. In my Louis Vuitton white buttoned down. Oh, it's not that deep. So bob your head for another dead blonde. The real princess is in heaven. She just wants to sleep. The final act of life will be my own hands to do. I'll be your Princess Die and die with you"

"""the sound of music"" tribute (oscars 2015)","The hills are alive with the sound of music. With songs they have sung for a thousand years. The hills fill my heart with the sound of music. My heart wants to sing every song it hears. My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds. that rise from the lake to the trees. My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies. from a church on a breeze. To laugh like a book when it trips and falls over. stones on its way. To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray. I go to the hills when my heart is lonely. I know I will hear what I've heard before. My heart will be blessed with the sound of music. And I'll sing once more. Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes. Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes. Silver white winters that melt into springs. These are a few of my favourite things. When the dog bites, when the bee stings. When I'm feeling sad. I simply remember my favourite things. And then I don't feel so bad. Edelweiss, Edelweiss. Bless my homeland forever. Climb ev'ry mountain. Ford ev'ry stream. Follow ev'ry rainbow. 'Till you find your dream. A dream that will need. All the love you can give. Everyday of your life.

viva la vida (cover),"I used to rule the world. Seas would rise when I gave the word. Now in the morning I sleep alone. Sweep the streets I used to own. I used to roll the dice. Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes. Listened as the crowd would sing. Now the old king is dead long live the king. One minute I held the key. Next the walls were closed on me. And I discovered that my castles stand. Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand. I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing. Roman cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield. Missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain. Once you'd gone there was never. Never an honest word. And that was when I ruled the world. It was a wicked and wild wind. Blew down the doors to let me in. Shattered windows and the sound of drums. People couldn't believe what I'd become. Revolutionaries wait. For my head on a silver plate. Just a puppet on a lonely string. Oh who would ever want to be king?. I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing. Roman cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield. My missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain. I know St Peter won't call my name. Never an honest word. But that was when I ruled the world. Hear Jerusalem bells are ringing.

Family tree, love, love your roots. Family tree. It takes a village to raise a child. It might take the whole world just to save a child. And one of the children just might save the world. So we need every boy and girl. And we all need to walk in the same path stride for stride. With hearts and arms open wide. With the same kind of mind. With a true love divine. And never let the blind lead the blind. And never have no fear be a voice for the deaf to hear. Spread the word so the voiceless ones can be heard. Build a road where even the lame can roam free. For you and me. A new world family tree. We're gonna make a pact and stop at the roots and take it back. We all need a family. Oh. Family tree, love, love your roots. Family tree. Sisters and brothers may attack you. But stop to think, why do what they do. Just think first, never burst. Or you'll find out, that you're only making things worse. (Repeat 3 times). We're gonna make a pact and stop at the roots and take it back. We all need a family. Oh. Family tree, love, love your roots. Family tree. Brothers and sisters fill your life with happiness and harmony. And just follow me and the whole world will be your family tree. PEACE"

you're all my little monsters (the simpsons song),"When they're young. All Little Monsters learn. That they are scary. Ugly, stupid. Shunned by cupid,. Overweight, and hairy. But every Monster needs to find. That secret deep inside. That transforms Dr. Jekyll into sexy Mr. Hyde. All my Monsters are beautiful. Discostoodiful, squarerootiful, oldcootiful.. Monsters don't need implants or a bitchin' Monster car. Monsters only need to love the Monsters that they are.. Oh yeah!. Gaga, Dada, Jawa. Peace!"
your song,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside. I'm not one of those, who can easily hide. I don't have much money, but boy if I did. I'd buy a big house where we both could live. If I was a sculptor, but then again no. Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show. I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do. My gift is my song and this one's for you. And you can tell everybody, this is your song. It maybe quite simple but now that it's done. I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind. That I put down in words. How wonderful life is now you're in the world. I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss. Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross. But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song. It's for people like you, that keep it turned on. So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do. You see I've forgotten, if they're green or they're blue. Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean. Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen. And you can tell everybody, this is your song. It maybe quite simple but now that it's done. I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind. That I put down in words. How wonderful life is now you're in the world. I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind. That I put down in words. How wonderful life is now you're, you're in, you're in. You're in the world"
