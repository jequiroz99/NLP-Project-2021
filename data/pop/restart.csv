i carry you with me,"I'd like to write a love song. something simple to make you feel. what I can't say with words alone. 'cause what I'm feeling is more than real. I'd hope the melody would be. something beautiful, something true. that could show you what you mean to me. 'cause i'm nothing when i'm without you. You got to know, I need you so. that only you can make me whole. and only you can save my soul. All I do is think of you. no matter where I go. 'cause everywhere I go. I carry you with me. I'd like to write a love song. so I could sing it to you every day. 'cause you're a dream that I've had so long. and I don't wanna let it slip away. I'd hope the melody would be. something beautiful something true. that could show you what you mean to me. 'cause i'm nothing when i'm without you. You got to know, I need you so. that only you can make me whole. and only you can save my soul. All I do is think of you. no matter where I go. 'cause everywhere I go. I carry you with me. Since the day that I found you. your love's been runnin' in my veins. I need you now to get me through. hear my song, hear me say"
