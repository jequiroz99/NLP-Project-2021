I'd trade it all. For something real. Something that's raw. Something that I, I, I can feel. Flaws and all. Now here's the deal. I don't want nothing. 'Less it's something real. Something real.

how do i get there from here,I took a step into a new direction. Following my heart this time and not my head. But everything I'm feeling now I question. If I'm wrong. what's next. Is there another road that's left. Tell me where it is cuz I can't see it. Every bit of faith that I believed in. Every single smile has disappeared. Now it feels like someone hid the sun where I can't find it. There has to be a world with life this clear. But how do I get there from here. If I can take the earth and spin it backwards. I can change every mistake I've made. But since I'm stuck here only after. I'm feeling lost and afraid. There's got to be a better place. Tell me where it is cuz I can't see it. Every bit of faith that I believed in. Every single smile has disappeared. Now it feels like someone hid the sun where I can't find it. There has to be a world with life this clear. But how do I get there from here. Cuz where I am it's just getting to hard to breathe. Oh it's so hard to breathe. Tell me where it is cuz I can't see it. Every bit of faith that I believed in. Every single smile has disappeared. Now it feels like someone hid the sun where I can't find it. There has to be a world with life this clear. But how do I get there from here.

And it's just begun. Let's get it started, get it started. And go till the sun comes up. The night is young. The night is young. The night is young. Dance together, dance alone, let it out and let it show. Changing colors under the strobe light. I just wanna have some fun, let my worries come undone. Right here right now it's feeling so right. We are lost and found. So let's go turn the beat around. And maybe find a brand new sound. Let's turn it up right now. Because the night is young. And it's just begun.

how do i get there from here,I took a step into a new direction. Following my heart this time and not my head. But everything I'm feeling now I question. If I'm wrong. what's next. Is there another road that's left. Tell me where it is cuz I can't see it. Every bit of faith that I believed in. Every single smile has disappeared. Now it feels like someone hid the sun where I can't find it. There has to be a world with life this clear. But how do I get there from here. If I can take the earth and spin it backwards. I can change every mistake I've made. But since I'm stuck here only after. I'm feeling lost and afraid. There's got to be a better place. Tell me where it is cuz I can't see it.
