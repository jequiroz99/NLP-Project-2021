at the end,"When you open your eyes. tell me all you can see. Things aren't here. as you wanted them always to be. Your dream's come to an end. The road has come to a turn. Now the absence of him. makes you yearn, scream and burn. Play with the time and imagine how she used to be. The dreams you've had. are the memories you'll be left within. Tears are the words you can speak. for a moment and now. The absence of her leaves a hole. your soul feels upside down. At the end of the day. There's nothing you can say. At the end of the night. You just wait for the light. The hours are passing I still call your name. The silence's the answer never will be the same. The moment we had still makes me want to smile. But when you're not here it's just empty inside. I can repeat a hundred times in one life. But nothing will bring you back by my side. All that is left here is me without you. And all that I wish will never, ever. 'Cause I may retell a thousand times in this life. Still my denial keeps dragging me down. All that is left here's a memory of you. And all of my wishes will never, ever be true. At the end of the day. There's nothing you can say. At the end of the night. You just wait for the light"
brings you down,"It's hard to understand. why things here have been so damn cold. And I haven't seen any change in their souls. They are bound to spend their time. helpless and feeling all alone. Such an aching void. You can mask your feelings. Maybe feel at a loss for words. More compelling than your reason. It disconnects you from the world. This desire for relief. keeps you tied to the drug of choice. Such an aching void. And it brings you down. And it brings you down. The feeling you avoided is back. you try, you buy again. Frail is how you feel. and now the time is still. For a moment pain will leave you. but it's right behind the door. Such an aching void. And it brings you down. And it brings you down. And it brings you down. And it brings you down. In the end when all is gone. Death will laugh over your throne. Your great empire will fall apart. You've killed yourself time to depart. In the end when all is done. Cold will take over your bones. And your desires will fall apart. You've killed yourself time to depart"
cards on your side,"He stares at the ground when she is around. Afraid of what his heart might feel. 'Cause she's more than something surreal. She notices him there but she wouldn't dare. So she walks away down the hall. In her mind ""will he ever call? "". When the time has come. There's nowhere to run. By the time you know. It's all out of control. How long can you hold?. When you have to show. The cards are on your side. They look at each other. Don't know one another. Just wondering how this could be. The reason is not here to see. Nothing like we had planned. Never as it began. There are times we just have to let go. 'Cause that's how the story is told. When the time has come. There's nowhere to run. By the time you know. It's all out of control. How long can you hold?. When you have to show. The cards are on your side"
despite what you say,A freedom that a few of us can claim. The moment when there's no one to blame. The breaking point. with all the things you knew. I cast away my pride and disappear. I leave behind my lies and all the fears. When all that matters is nothing but the truth. And looking inside is all I've got to do. I may look like a fool. To you it sounds like an odd decision. Despite what you say. The search for what I'm really made of. To own the keys to live the way I want. And put myself together and be as one. There's certainly more out there you can see. You'll be left to wonder if you sleep. It's not a hoax you'll see when all has been done. I'm headed to the road of the unknown. I may look like a fool. To you it sounds like an odd decision. Despite what you say. I'm free
just fine,"So you wanna be cool. Hang out with your fools. and know me as the one. you're gonna take home. I know. And me? What do you see?. Someone that you'll leave. waiting in line hoping for you. 'Cause I won't. You're tired and weak. from years of negative flow. Four long and downward waves. have washed and left you alone. You won't have me by your side. I will be far from you. You won't wrap me in your lies. 'Cause my choice is to be just fine. Now, maybe somehow. You know what I mean. when I look at you and you look at me. For sure. Take all of your games. I'm not in your race. my road is much clearer than before. Right now. You're tired and weak. from years of negative flow. Four long and downward waves. have washed and left you alone. You won't have me by your side. I will be far from you. You won't wrap me in your lies. 'Cause my choice is to be just fine. . This way I'm in control of how I feel. And not the other way around. You won't have me by your side. I will be far from you. You won't wrap me in your lies. 'Cause my choice is to be just fine"
last goodbye,"This is our night in the fire. and how it's gonna burn away. Flame's going higher. 'till the light of the morning brings a sunny day. Your eyes tell me but I wonder. how it's gonna be when you're gone. In spite of it all, I know. This is what time's held all the way along. Listen to the way I'm moaning. Feel the way we are bound. Entangled with you right now. up and down, on the ground, shining by the light. I wanna keep this endless foreplay. keep looking right into your eyes. I place my hand, we cannot stand. I hold you close, feel your heart beating next to mine. Take this time Let's make love tonight. Feel the way I touch you now. I know you and you know. It's our last goodbye. Today is gone. Tomorrow comes. And we don't know for how long. Take this time Let's make love tonight. Feel the way I touch you now. I know you and you know. It's our last goodbye"
not like you,"I know you want to knock me to the ground. So you can feel good as I'm falling down. The way you did it unveils who you are. The words you said brought us to fall apart. I'm here to tell you prove that you were wrong. My feet are strong my voice works on this song. You almost fooled me into believing so. But I am stronger than you'll ever know. The world is spinning. and time goes round and round. Life's a circle. I am back in town. Your mask has fallen I know who you are. You're nothing but a painting on the wall. Always thinking you were the star above. But now I bury you in this grave below. The world is spinning. and time goes round and round. Life's a circle. I am back in town. Take a good look, can you see?. I am not who I used to be. You never thought this time would come. So I am here and you're alone. But don't think I am just like you. 'Cause everything I want is true. You may look the other way. 'Cause now I'm back and here to stay. The world is spinning. and time goes round and round. Life is a circle. I am back in town"
wandering the streets,"Smoke drifts into my lungs. One more cigarette is gone. The ice melts and waters down the only drink I've got. Guess I need another shot. The bar is about to shutdown. I've been awaiting your call. I'm trying to speak. I rehearse all my lines. I look for relief. A source of light on the edge of a road. It shows me I've got no place to go. The taste in my mouth reminds me of your kiss. But the memory fades with the breeze. I've been drinking all night. Wandering the streets. I've been thinking of you. I got tears on my mind. And I say ""babe"". I've been drinking all night. Wandering the streets. I've been thinking of you. I got tears on my mind. And I say"
