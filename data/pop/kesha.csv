learn to let go,"Been a prisoner of the past. Had a bitterness when I looked back. Was telling everyone it's not that bad. 'Til all my shit hit the fan. I know I'm always like.

Exorcise the demons inside me. Whoa, gotta learn to let it go. The past can't haunt me if I don't let it. Live and learn and never forget it. Whoa, gotta learn to let it go. Had a boogieman under my bed. Putting crazy thoughts inside my head. Always whispering, ""It's all your fault"". He was telling me ""No, you're not that strong"". I know I'm always like. Telling everybody you don't have to be a victim. Life ain't always fair. But hell is living in resentment. Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you.

I think you're hot, I think you're cool. You're the kind of guy I'd stalk in school. But now that I'm famous. You're up my anus. Now I'm gonna eat you, fool. [Pre-Chorus:]. I eat boys up. Breakfast and lunch. Then when I'm thirsty. I drink their blood. Carnivore, animal. I am a cannibal. I eat boys up. You better run. [Chorus:]. I am cannibal. I am cannibal. I'll eat you up. I am cannibal. I am cannibal. I'll eat you up. Whenever you tell me I'm pretty. That's when the hunger really hits me. Your little heart goes pitter patter. I want your liver on a platter. Use your finger to stir my tea. And for dessert I'll suck your teeth. Be too sweet, and you'll be a goner. Yep, I'll pull a Jeffrey Dahmer. [Pre-Chorus]. I eat boys up. Breakfast and lunch. Then when I'm thirsty. I drink their blood. Carnivore, animal. I am a cannibal. I eat boys up. You better run. [Chorus]. I am cannibal. I am cannibal. I'll eat you up. I am cannibal. I am cannibal.

Come get me, Let's get rowdy. Boy you look so damn good on me.. Back to the wall. On my silhouette. When you walked right by. Felt your breath on my neck. And it felt so deep. In a trance of a sleep. Have I seen you before?. Once in a dream. Like a flashback, sneak attack, chain reaction. At the first sight you just might be the right one.. You got something [out of you] like a rerun.. Try but can't explain this chain reaction. You hit me like a shot of whiskey. You got me walking sideways. Tunnel vision feeling frisky. Want to get you stuck on replay. I don't fall like this. I must confess you cast a spell up on me. Shadows of us in the room of sweat. You took my hand to the back and left. And it felt so deep. In a trance of a sleep. Have I seen you before?. Once in a dream. Like a flashback, sneak attack, chain reaction. At the first sight you just might be the right one.. You got something [out of you] like a rerun.. Try but can't explain this chain reaction. Ohhh ohoh, chain reaction. Spin me around, all around. Oh feels like a lifetime. (I've been waiting). One time I look goes down. Then they all hit the ground. (And not deliberate). It all happens for a reason right?. Guess there's no need to fight it right?. Cause one thing leads to another,. Leads to another, leads to another.. Like a flashback, sneak attack, chain reaction. At the first sight you just might be the right one. You got something [out of you] like a rerun.. Try but can't explain this chain reaction. Chain reaction, this chain reaction. Chain reaction, this chain reaction. Chain reaction, this chain reaction. Chain reaction, this chain reaction"
change my mind,"You think I'm easy. You think I worship you upon your throne. But, Baby, that's just me. I would never take you home. Yeah, keep dreaming, Yeah, I'm here alone.

Might actually intrigue me. Just enough to change my mind. You must be crazy. If you think I'd drop everything for some guy. Don't even try to blame me. Just because I'm the one that's got a life. I don't waste my time, now if I could find a guy. Who gets that I kick ass and that I'm. Self-sufficient, independent. Never needed anyone else. Commitment's like prison. I won't let you lock me up.

coming unglued,Put on my best face to impress you. Concerned with things you've never even see. What I wouldn't give to possess you. You'e just the perfect accessory. Practising the right things to say. Every word intended to intrigue. I'd do anything it would take. If I knew you'd fall in love with me. Impeccable picture perfect. Unmanicured and shampooed. But then you walk in the room. Feels like I'm coming unglued. I think I'm coming unglued. It's not like me to just fall apart. Give a shit what other people think. But you're a god a true work of art. Watch me disintegrate piece by piece. On the outside you'd never know. That I'm simply crumbling inside. But my cover will be soon blown. If you ever look me in the eye. Impeccable picture perfect. Unmanicured and shampooed. But then you walk in the room. Feels like I'm coming unglued. I think I'm coming unglued. Freaking out I can barely take a breath. Anticipation making me a nervous wreck. Rooms spinning room round and melting down. But you would never guess. Impeccable picture perfect. Unmanicured and shampooed. But then you walk in the room. Feels like I'm coming unglued. I think I'm coming unglued. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. I think I might be coming unglued

die young (remix) (feat. juicy j & wiz khalifa & becky g),"[Juicy J]. Everybody know Juicy always turnt up. Tour bus smoked out, everybody purped up. 9 to 5 grind and got the whole hood worked up. Ain't getting money then you better get your work up. Pull up in a Porsche drunk, back seat chauffeur. Taylor Gang in here, everybody know us. Hundred bottles, and there's more coming. Same shit tomorrow night, all I know is stunting. 20 shot of Jager, I don't do chasers. White boy wasted, smoking out the vaper. Party with your girl, sweating out my pores. Becky so good, I had to thank the Lord. She won my heart, in the club she go hard. Shake her ass and titties, I threw my card. Love California girls like David Lee Roth. You tell em that you love em.

But for the famous stuff, I wasn't the one to play with. Party all night, getting drunk and raging. Ball so hard, I think I'm gonna be sick. Wake up, roll a joint and do it all again. Yeah, I like to party. Got a cute face and I like your body. You leave sober and you might be sorry. Pour another shot then light the Marley. And what goes down, don't bring it up. Tell them broke niggas they can hang it up. Take six shots, feels like we're dying. Hit this once, feels like you're flying. [Ke$ha]. I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums.

He rings the bell and she looks out the window. and calls the cops. I try to explain that he's mostly tame. As long as there's pizza and video games. That's what you get. when you take Godzilla to meet your mom. While everyone else is running and screaming. I just love being with you. I guess they don't see all the things that I'm seein'. That make you so uniquely you, you, you, you. What do you get when you meet Godzilla and fall in love?"

I can hear the pounding of my heart, can you feel it?. When you take my body to the stars, I believe it. Boy this love is supernatural, can you feel it?. (Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it). Boy this love is. Supernatural. Boy this love is supernatural. (Baby B-Baby B-Baby B-Baby B-Baby B-Baby B-Baby). Baby when were touching in the dark. I can hear the pounding of my heart. Baby when we're touching in the dark, can you feel it?. I can hear the pounding of my heart, can you feel it?. When you take my body to the stars, I believe it. Boy this love is supernatural, can you feel it?"

the harold song,"I miss your soft lips, I miss your white sheets. I miss the scratch of your unshaved face on my cheek. And this is so hard 'cause I didn't see. That you were the love of my life and it kills me. I see your face in strangers on the street. I still say your name when I'm talking in my sleep. And in the limelight I play it off fine. But I can't handle it when I turn off my nightlight. But I can't handle it when I turn off my nightlight. They say that true love hurts. Well this could almost kill me. Young love murder. That is what this must be. I would give it all to not be sleeping alone. The life is fading from me. While you watch my heart bleed. Young love murder. That is what this must be. I would give it all to not be sleeping alone. Remember the time we jumped the fence when. The Stones were playing and we were too broke to get in. You held my hand and they made me cry while. I swore to God it was the best night of my life. Or when you took me across the world we. Promised that this would last forever but now I see. It was my past life, a beautiful time. Drunk off of nothing but each other 'till the sunrise. Drunk off of nothing but each other 'till the sunrise. They say that true love hurts. Well this could almost kill me. Young love murder. That is what this must be. I would give it all to not be sleeping alone. The life is fading from me. While you watch my heart bleed. Young love murder. That is what this must be. I would give it all to not be sleeping alone. It was my past life, a beautiful time. Drunk off of nothing but each other 'till the sunrise. ‘Till the sunrise, 'till the sunrise.

Well I've heard it all before. In the constant state of war. They all said things work out that way. That the beauty and & the pain. No it isn't all the same. But I'm the one that has to change. See, I made up my mind. My excuses left behind. From now on, things work out my way. (Verse 2). When you finally woke up. You found the note I left ya,. You wondered where my mind went. I told you I decided. This morning was just perfect. For everything but hiding. The rains, pulled down, but the sun, and the storm keeps me moving. There's nothing to be losing,. There's fear, all around, in this town, and that's why I'm leaving. Yeah you can't bring me down cause. (Chorus). Well I've heard it all before. In the constant state of war.
