waves,"Woke up feeling sick. Everyday goes like this. I need something. I need something. So I didn't think it twice. I decided to go out. Breathing life. breathing life. 'Cause you know. it's not worth it. when you don't live. a fulfilling life. All the memories make me who I am today. All my feelings moving back and forth like waves. Take my hand and follow me. All my feelings moving back and forth like waves. back and forth like waves. Walkin' in the sand. I'm breathing deep. Watching the landscape. watching the landscape. I can't take it anymore. hate is more than love. I can't figure it out. I can't figure it out. 'Cause you know. it's not worth it. when you don't live. a fulfilling life. All the memories make me who I am today. All my feelings moving back and forth like waves. Take my hand and follow me. All my feelings moving back and forth like waves. back and forth like waves. When you're feeling down so low. No, don't you worry babe. When you doubt yourself, trust me. I'll be there for you. When you're feeling down so low. No, don't you worry babe. When you doubt yourself, trust me. You're beautiful!. All the memories make me who I am today. All my feelings moving back and forth like waves. Take my hand and follow me. All my feelings moving back and forth like waves. back and forth like waves"
