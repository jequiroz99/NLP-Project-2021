back to you (joey pecoraro remix),"Took you like a shot. Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening. Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you. And every time we talk. Every single word builds up to this moment. And I gotta convince myself I don't want it. Even though I do. You could break my heart in two. But when it heals, it beats for you. I know it's forward, but it's true. I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to. When I'm lying close to someone else. You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it. If I could do it all again. I know I'd go back to you. I know I'd go back to you. We never got it right. Playing and replaying old conversations. Overthinking every word and I hate it. 'Cause it's not me. And what's the point in hiding?. Everybody knows we got unfinished business. And I'll regret it if I didn't say. This isn't what it could be. I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to. When I'm lying close to someone else. You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it. If I could do it all again. I know I'd go back to you. I know I'd go back to you. I'd go back to you.

I keep pushing myself even though I can't take it at all. Girl, who taught you how to move like that?. At this pace you're at you're going way too fast. I, I saw you from across the room. It's me versus every guy. It's your choice you choose. I've got friends in highly low places. It's been a long time, it's been a long time. And maybe baby. You can rise above the rest and meet me yeah. Whoa oh whoa whoa oh. Why do I put myself in these situations?. Whoa oh whoa whoa oh. I keep pushing myself even though I can't take it at all. Whoa oh whoa whoa oh. Why do I put myself in these situations?. Whoa oh whoa whoa oh. I keep pushing myself even though I can't take it at all. You're worth losing my self esteem. Your clever words mean nothing more to me. Than a lot I've heard in a movie. You're worth losing my, losing my, losing my self esteem. You're not worth putting myself in these situations. Whoa oh whoa whoa oh. Why do I put myself in these situations?. Whoa oh whoa whoa oh. I keep pushing myself even though I can't take it at all"
winter wonderland,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?. In the lane, snow is glistening. A beautiful sight. We're happy tonight. Walking in a winter wonderland. Gone away is the bluebird. In this place is a new bird. He sings a love song. As we sing along. Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman. Then pretend that he is Parson Brown. He'll say: Are you married?. We'll say: No man. But you can do the job. When you're in town. Later on, we'll conspire. As we dream by the fire. We'll face unafraid. The plans that we've made. Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman. And pretend that he's a circus clown. We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman. Until the alligators knock him down. When it snows, ain't it thrilling. Though your nose gets a chilling. We'll frolic and play. The Eskimo way. Walking in a winter wonderland. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Walking in a winter wonderland. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Walking in a winter wonderland"
wolves (feat. marshmello),"In your eyes, there's a heavy blue. One to love, and one to lose. Sweet divide, a heavy truth. Water or wine, don't make me choose. I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night. Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky. I've been running through the jungle. I've been running with the wolves. To get to you, to get to you. I've been down the darkest alleys. Saw the dark side of the moon. To get to you, to get to you. I've looked for love in every stranger. Took too much to ease the anger. All for you, yeah, all for you. I've been running through the jungle. I've been crying with the wolves. To get to you, to get to you, to get to you. To get to you. To get to you. Your fingertips trace my skin. To places I have never been. Blindly I am following. Break down these walls and come on in. I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night. Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky. I've been running through the jungle. I've been running with the wolves. To get to you, to get to you. I've been down the darkest alleys. Saw the dark side of the moon. To get to you, to get to you. I've looked for love in every stranger. Took too much to ease the anger. All for you, yeah, all for you. I've been running through the jungle. I've been crying with the wolves. To get to you, oh, to get to you. I've been running through the jungle. I've been running with the wolves. To get to you, to get to you. I've been down the darkest alleys. Saw the dark side of the moon. To get to you, to get to you. I've looked for love in every stranger. Took too much to ease the anger. All for you, yeah, all for you. I've been running through the jungle. I've been crying with the wolves. To get to you, oh, to get to you"

you belong with me,"You're on the phone with your girlfriend. She's upset, she's going off about. Something that you said. She doesn't get your humor. Like I do. I'm in my room. It's a typical tuesday night. I'm listening to the kind of music. She doesn't like. She'll never know your story. Like I do. But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts. She's cheer captain, and I'm on the bleachers. Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find. That what you're looking for has been here the whole. time. If you could see. That I'm the one. Who understands you. Been here all along. So why can't you see me. You belong with me. You belong with me.. Walking the streets. With you and your worn out jeans. I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be. Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself. Hey, isn't this easy?. And you've got a smile. That could light up this whole town. I haven't seen it in a while. Since she brought you down. You say you're fine. I know you better than that. Hey what are you doing with a girl like that. But she wears high heels. I wear sneakers. She's cheer captain. I'm on the bleachers. Dreaming about the day. When you wake up and find. That what you're looking for. Has been here the whole time. If you could see. That I'm the one. Who understands you. Been here all along. So why can't you. See, you belong with me. Standing by and waiting at your backdoor. All this time. How could you not know baby. You belong with me. You belong with me.. Oh, I remember you. Driving to my house. In the middle of the night. I'm the one who makes you laugh. When you know you're about to cry. And I know your favorite songs. And you tell me about your dreams. Think I know where you belong. Think I know it's with me. Can't you see. That I'm the one. Who understands you. Been here all along. So why can't you see?. You belong with me.. Standing by and waiting at your backdoor. All this time. How could you not know baby. You belong with me. You belong with me.. You belong with me. Have you ever thought. Just maybe. You belong with me. You belong with me"
