arrivederci roma (with dean martin),"Arriverderci, Roma. Goodbye, goodbye to Rome. City of a million moon lit faces. City of a million warm embraces. Where I found the one of all the faces. Far from home. Arriverderci, Roma. It's time for us to part. Save the wedding bells for my returning. Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning. Please be sure the flame of love keeps burning. In her heart. Arriverderci, Roma. It's time for us to part. Save the wedding bells for my returning. Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning. Please be sure the flame of love keeps burning.

breathe gentle (feat. kelly rowland),"Oh, oh. I want to give you all of me – the underneath. Want you to show me imperfection is actually love. I thought, cursed – I was cursed –. destined to be lonely. A circle in a world of squares. where nobody knows me. So with every footstep I must. follow the kissing moments. I thought were impossible. Breathe gentle, Be gentle. Don't leave me behind. when love goes faster. Breathe gentle, Be gentle. Never let me go when love goes faster. I will be gentle. See, photographs haveonly two dimensions. But love defies all logic in a picture. Above all that is physical, I'm falling. Falling uncontrollably – it terrifies me. So if my compass, it fails me. And I feel I'm walking blind. Don't say goodbye. Don't let me hide. Oh please don't let me spiral. Tortured by you, oh, sweet torture!. I am a pirate -- love my fortune. The walls have fallen now. The key is yours to turn – I'm breathing. Breathe gentle, Be gentle.... Every time I run somehow love runs faster. Without your loneliness is everlasting. I still feel you. But I hear you - loudly. Screaming – ""please wait for me"". Cause I don't want to hurt you. And I don't want to loose this love this time.. Se cerco lo vedo. l'amore va veloce e tu stai indietro. Se cerchi mi vedi Il bene più segreto. sfugge all'uomo che non guarda avanti mai"

So I think I let it out. You're on my mind more than I may sure. You're in my heart more than you may know. Tiziano. And the last thing that I want. Is to you to fall apart. To you I will be clearer. I want you to remember. M&T. In each tear. There's a lesson, (there's a lesson). Makes you wiser than before (wiser). Makes you stronger than you know (stronger). And each tear (each tear).

Più di tutti quanti I drammi che ti ho detto. Io ti amo e che ti amo ora l'ho detto. (each tear). Queste lacrime figlie di un'arma atroce (arma atroce). Queste lacrime si mostrano alla luce. Queste ore ormai umide di lacrime. Cancellano il timore e me che intemplano la lapide. (già, già già, già). No no we can't be held out. No no oh noo I I I can't held out. You you you can't be held out. We we we can't be held out. Love. It makes you so much stronger (stronger). It makes you so much wiser (wiser). In each tear (in each tear). And You're so close to your dreams and no dreams. No mistake, no heartbreak. Can't take away you're meant to be"
karma (feat. john legend),"...When the universe connects us. I know this is karma.... Stare at the sky, can't get out of my bed. There's shadow's circling my head. Where's love, your love.... In another life did I play this game. Leaving me alone with an empty frame. I fear the worst in me. But you know the best in me. 'Cause you see, when I'm honest with honesty. I will stumble through the darkness. Til we see the morning. Is this karma, can you hear me. My heart is singin'. Everything inside I wanna say. I think about you every single day. Is this karma, come and dance. Like we did before I lost you, this is karma. My heart is singin'. Everything inside I wanna say. Every step I'm taking day by day. When the universe connects us. I know this is karma. I can't get the image of you. Out of my mind. The edges of your body. Pushing up against me. Breathing, breathing. There is a silence in my beating heart. A cause and effect that we can't discard. Is all of love a ploy, an energy decoy. Cause you see, if I'm honest with honesty. That means crashing through the mirror. Just to know what love is. Is this karma, can you hear me. My heart is singin'. Everything inside I wanna say. I think about you every single day. Is this karma, come and dance. Like we did before I lost you, this is karma. My heart is singin'. Everything inside I wanna say. Every step I'm taking day by day. When the universe connects us. I know this is karma. Love is karma, come and dance like we did before I lost you..."

universal prayer,"I'm just the same as you. I could be the same age too. Do the same music you do. Everyday. No matter what separates us. The same stars we see at night. No matter what's up against us. Still gonna have dream burning right. I believe we fear what we don't know. We can be our own enemy. But if you concord and. If you tock my hand. I see a girl, you see a man. Chorus:. Everybody has the same dream. A dream in their heart. Get a chance to make a life. Love somebody they want. Open your eyes, we're all the same. We won't be scared. So let's sing together now. Na,na,na,na...in this universal prayer. I see the smoking light. That complicates the simple life. I'm here and you are there. Miles away. All you gotta do is believe. That anything you want you can reach. There's no limit to what we can be. So, open your mind. And set yourself free. Pré-chorus. Chorus. And in this dream I have at night. That I don't understand the world at all. You might be right but it seems to me. That we've come to fight too far. Cause I believe that fears. I try to save our souls. And hardest time will come. And all this pain will go. So try to understand. The precious things I've said. Every woman, every man. Chorus"
