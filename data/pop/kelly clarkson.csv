breakaway,"Grew up in a small town. And when the rain would fall down. I'd just stare out my window. Dreamin' of what could be. And if I'd end up happy. I would pray. Trying hard to reach out. But, when I tried to speak out. Felt like no one could hear me. Wanted to belong here. But something felt so wrong here. So I'd pray. I could break away. I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly. I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky. And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change. And break away. Out of the darkness and into the sun. But, I won't forget all the ones that I love. I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And break away. Wanna feel the warm breeze. Sleep under a palm tree. Feel the rush of the ocean. Get onboard a fast train. Travel on a jetplane, far away. And break away. I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly. I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky. And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change. And break away. Out of the darkness and into the sun. I won't forget all the ones that I love. I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And break away. Buildings with a hundred floors. Swinging round revolving doors. Maybe I don't know where they'll take me. But, gotta keep moving on, moving on. Fly away, break away. I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly. Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye, gotta. Take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And break away. Out of the darkness and into the sun. But, I won't forget the place I come from. I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And break away"

Swallow me then spit me out. For hating you, I blame myself. Seeing you it kills me now. No, I don't cry on the outside. Anymore.... Here I am, once again. I'm torn into pieces. Can't deny it, can't pretend. Just thought you were the one. Broken up, deep inside. But you won't get to see the tears I cry. Behind these hazel eyes. Here I am, once again. I'm torn into pieces.

i had a dream,"If you wanna lead, be a leader. If you wanna dream, be a dreamer. Climb to the top of that mountain. Scream it. But remember when you get to the top. Everything you say is gonna matter. Everything you do is gonna add up. It's what you asked for so. Don't get mad when it's not what you thought. Careful now girl with the Jezebel waist. Fall on your head, but you're queen of cliches. Little one playing with the big boys. Hope you're ready when it comes back around. I had a dream that we were more. A generation to behold. Writing fires with our words. Instead of useless smoke that blurs. The lines are writing on. Expression that lives on. An army with a song. That lingers when we're gone. I had a dream. If you wanna preach, be a preacher. If you wanna teach, be a teacher. Remember that the footprints. You? re leaving will tell us all who you really are. It's too late, you can't see what you're worth. Spreading your legs instead of using your words. Character is shown by the thins that we do. The one thing you're never gonna hide is the truth. 'cause anyone can tell when it's solid now. And anyone can fly with me falling now. I had a dream that we were more. A generation to behold. Writing fires with our words. Instead of useless smoke that blurs. The lines are writing on. Expression that lives on. An army with a song. That lingers when we're gone. I had a dream. I had a dream.

You left open the window till the morning. And the winter walked in. Reality fired her wooden bullet. Splintered under our skin. They say I'm walking on freedom. This is freedom. Now I know. Now I know. Now I know. Now I know. I still don't blame you for leaving,baby. It's cold living with ghosts. I spit, I spit in the eye. I tear, I tear out my heart. and I scatter the bits.

everybody got their something,My face to the sky. Dreaming about just how high. I could go. And if I'll know. When I finally get there. Taking off my glasses. Sun pokes through my lashes. And somehow I know. There's a time for every star to shine. (Chorus:). Everybody got their something. Everybody got there something. Make you smile like an itty bitty child. People keeping score. Say better hurry up and get yours. Cause somebody else. Got your spot. Before you even dropped. Seek and you shall find. Everything in your own sweet time. I'll take my chances. With what I believe is only mine. Busy holding on. So the roof don't fly. Keep you from moving on. So get it right. Turn the tide over. Like a love song. Like a butterfly. Believe if you hand it over. You'll come out all right. (Chorus). Illuminate the silly things. Shed some light on all that's wrong. Everybody need it. Sometime. Sometimes the only thing you got. is what makes you feel like. You're something else altogether. You have everything don't need. another reason to be something. I've been on a ride. and caught up in the landslide. But I'm gonna spread my wings and fly.... (Chorus). There's a time for every star. There's a time for every star ...

Cause I'm gone. Doesn't matter what you do. It's what you did that's hurting you. All I needed was the truth. Now I'm gone. What you see's not what you get. . Fonte: Site Oficial"
good goes the bye,"They say Rome wasn't built in a day. But you and I went and built it anyway. And it only took a second to watch it all fall to dust. I thought you hung up the moon. And you thought I lit up the room. But the lights turned off and it was the end of us. Slam goes the door. Hush goes the phone. Out goes the flame. And I'm standing here alone. Burn goes the drink. Down go the tears. Drip goes the sink. And I'm missing you like hell. Break goes the heart. Wrong goes the right. Good goes the bye. It's like we pulled the pin out of a grenade. It just didn't go off right away. But man did it go off when it finally did. Everything's suddenly magnified. It's loud and it's quiet at the same time. As the echo of it's all over sets in. Slam goes the door. Hush goes the phone. Out goes the flame. And I'm standing here alone. Burn goes the drink. Down go the tears. Drip goes the sink. And I'm missing you like hell. Break goes the heart. Wrong goes the right. Good goes the bye. I can't go back, we can't be friends. And we can't be what we were then. You can't be mine, and I can't be yours. And it's not love anymore. Slam goes the door. Hush goes the phone. Out goes the flame. And I'm standing here alone. Burn goes the drink. Down go the tears. Drip goes the sink. And I'm missing you like hell. Break goes the heart. Wrong goes the right. Goodbye"
hand me downs,"I wish you knew. All the ways I love you. I pray each night. For just a second of your time. And I watch you dance. And I can't help but wonder. If I took this step. Would you notice me at all?. It's just so hard to be so brave. Try to say it all but I never say it. Try to stand so tall but I'm so damn afraid. So afraid. Underneath it all. We're just kids with big dreams. And a stubborn heart. Behind smiles and hand me downs. We're all looking for that light. A little scared. Of the dark. Sometimes I glance. Longer than I should, yeah. Hoping I might catch your eyes. Wandering around this big ol' room. Sink or swim. One day I will whisper. In your ear and tell you. Everything I've been dying to. It's just so hard to be so brave. I try to say it all but I never say it. Try to stand so tall but I'm so damn afraid. So afraid. Underneath it all. We're just kids with big dreams. And a stubborn heart. Behind smiles and hand me downs. We're all looking for that light. A little scared. Underneath it all. We're just kids with big dreams. And a stubborn heart. Behind smiles and hand me downs.

haunted,"Louder, louder. The voices in my head. Whispers taunting. All the things you said. Faster the days go by and I'm still. Stuck in this moment of wanting you here. Time. In the blink of an eye. You held my hand, you held me tight. Now you're gone. And I'm still crying. Shocked, broken. I'm dying inside. Where are you?. I need you. Don't leave me here on my own. Speak to me. Be near me. I can't survive unless I know you're with me. Shadows linger. Only to my eye. I see you, I feel you. Don't leave my side. It's not fair. Just when I found my world. They took you, they broke you, they tore out your heart. I miss you, you hurt me. You left with a smile. Mistaken, your sadness. Was hiding inside. Now all that's left. Are the pieces to find. The mystery you kept. The soul behind a guise. Where are you. I need you. Don't leave me here on my own. Speak to me. Be near me. I can't survive unless I know you're with me. Why did you go?. All these questions run through my mind. I wish I couldn't feel at all. Let me be numb. I'm starting to fall. Where are you?. I need you. Don't leave me here on my own. Speak to me. Be near me. I can't survive unless I know you're with me. Where are you?. Where are you?. You were smiling"
have yourself a merry little christmas,"Have yourself a merry little Christmas. Let your heart be light. From now on. Our troubles will be out of sight. Have yourself a merry little Christmas. Make the Yuletide gay. From now on. Our troubles will be far away. Here we are, as in olden days. Happy golden days gone by. Oldest friends who are dear to us. Gather near to us. Once more. Through the years. We all will be together. If the fates allow. Hang a shining star upon the highest bough. And have yourself a merry little Christmas now"
hear me,You gotta be out there. You gotta be somewhere. Wherever you are. I’m waiting…. Cause there are these nights when. I sing myself to sleep. And I’m hoping my dreams bring. You close to me. Are you listening?. Hear me I’m crying out. I’m ready now. Turn my world upside down. Find me. I’m lost inside this crowd. It’s getting loud. I need you to see. I’m screaming for you to please. Hear me. Can you hear me?. I used to be scared of. Letting someone in. But it gets so lonely. Being on my own. With no one to talk to and. No one to hold me. I’m not always strong. Oh I need you here. Are you listening?. I’m restless and wild. I fall but I try. I need someone to understand. (Can you hear me?). I’m lost in my thoughts. And baby I’ve fought. For all that I’ve got. Can you hear me?. . Fonte: Site Oficial

i remember,"Wednesday, never felt so cold here. Found your letter. Didn't know your words could hurt me still. Laying on the ground, nothing I can do. But wait it out. Creeping in, slowly wearing me down. And I remember. Changing everything I used to need. His arms don't fit the way yours did. But at least they're holding me. He will never leave me, he will never break me. Like you do. And he will never be you. So just tonight I let you in. Close my eyes and I pretend. That it's you instead of him. I kiss his face, hold him close. Whisper softly so he won't know. I'm remembering you again. And I remember. Closer, closer than I like to be. Loving him and letting go of you isn't easy. Nothing you can do, nothing he can be. Nothing I can ever say. I'll keep you here till you fade away. So just tonight I let you in. Close my eyes and I pretend. That it's you instead of him. I kiss his face, hold him close. Whisper softly so he won't know. I'm remembering you again. And I remember. I could fight it, try and forget you. I could fight it but I don't want to. So just tonight I let you in. Close my eyes and I pretend. That it's you instead of him. I kiss his face, hold him close. Whisper softly so he won't know. I'm remembering you again.

i'm moving on,"I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons. Finally content with a past I regret. I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness. For once I'm at peace with myself. I've been burdened with blame, trapped in the past for too long. I'm movin' on. I've lived in this place and I know all the faces. Each one is different but they're always the same. They mean me no harm but it's time that I face it. They'll never allow me to change. But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong. I'm movin' on. I'm movin' on. At last I can see life has been patiently waiting for me. And I know there's no guarantees, but I'm not alone. There comes a time in everyone's life. When all you can see are the years passing by. And I have made up my mind that those days are gone. I sold what I could and packed what I couldn't. Stopped to fill up on my way out of town. I've loved like I should but lived that I shouldn't. I had to lose everything to find out. Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road. I'm movin' on. I'm movin' on. I'm movin' on"

Of your silent reverie. You're in the arms of the angel. May you find some comfort here. You're in the arms of the angel. May you find some comfort here

why,How many times do I have to try to tell you. That I`m sorry for the things I`ve done. But when I start to try to tell you. That`s when you have to tell me. Hey...this kind of trouble`s only just begun. I tell myself too many times. Why don`t you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut. That`s why it hurts so bad to hear the words. That keep on falling from your mouth. Falling from your mouth. Falling from your mouth. Tell me.... Why. Why. I may be mad. I may be blind. I may be viciously unkind. But I can still read what you`re thinking. And I`ve heard it said too many times. That you`d be better off. Besides.... Why can`t you see this boat is sinking. (This boat is sinking this boat is sinking). Let`s go down to the water`s edge. And we can cast away those doubts. Some things are better left unsaid. But they still turn me inside out. Turning inside out turning inside out. Tell me.... Why. Tell me.... Why. This is the book I never read. These are the words I never said. This is the path I`ll never tread. These are the dreams I`ll dream instead. This is the joy that`s seldom spread. These are the tears.... The tears we shed. This is the fear. This is the dread. These are the contents of my head. And these are the years that we have spent. And this is what they represent. And this is how I feel. Do you know how I feel?. `Cause I don`t think you know how I feel. I don`t think you know what I feel. I don`t think you know what I feel. You don`t know what I feel. Why
why don't you try,"I am a woman. Cut in two. By ambitious pride. Stuck in my ways. Between you and my other life. Now I have been around enough to know when love has ended. And I believe that you and I deserve to be extended. Why don't you try. To make me stay. When it's time to go. Why don't you try. To stand in my way. Because we both know. I can't stop myself. Our empty house. You occupy. When I'm far away. Heavier hearts won't justify why I'm gone today. Now I have hung a cloud above our house from always leaving. I figured you would at least make me give a better reason. Why don't you try. To make me stay. When it's time to go. Why don't you try. To stand in my way. Because we both know. I can't stop myself. In the early mornings when I'm up before dawn. Say ""why don't you stay"" but you keep sleeping on. Maybe you're just too used to me being gone. Cause if you know that I go when I go. Then why don't you try. To make me stay. When it's time to go. Why don't you try. To stand in my way. Because we both know. I can't stop myself."

winter dreams (brandon's song),"Drawing hearts on the foggy glass. New love, chase away my past. Nothing but the open road, saddle up, here we go. 1-2-3. First winter here in your arms. Flames rising as we fall like the stars. Making angels in the snow, warm fuzzy, frozen through. Is this a dream?. Don? t wake me up. If this is love. Please, let me be. Swept completely off my feet. This snow globe dream is telling me. This Christmas it all became real. Don? t wake me please. From this winter dream. Winter dream. Winter dream. Built a fire to escape the cold. Ben Crosby on the stereo. Chasing letter on my skin, slowly start sinking in. You love me. Don? t wake me up. If this is love. Please, let me be. Swept completely off my feet. This snow globe dream is telling me. This Christmas it all became real. Don? t wake me please. From this winter?. Dreaming dreams while I? m wide awake. The tree, the lights, staying up late. It? s true. I? m in love with you. Swept completely off my feet. This snow globe dream is telling me. This Christmas it all became real. Don? t wake me please. From this winter dream. Winter dream. Winter dream"

You didn't let me down, you didn't tear me apart. You just opened my eyes, while breaking my heart. You didn't do it for me. I'm not as dumb as you think. You just made me cry. While claiming that you love me. You love me, you love me. You said you loved me but that I. I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough. Stronghold, but fun ride. But rollercoasters aren't just na-na-na-not enough. I keep it in, you wear me out. This kind of love is na-na-na-not enough. Said I'm just a sinking ship, I'm just a sinking ship.
