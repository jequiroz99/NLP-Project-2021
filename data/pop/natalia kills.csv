devils don't fly,"I heard the angels call again. I throw myself a party. Chardonnay and Oxy. I stopped the scream inside my head. I remember when you had me. Floating high like Sid & Nancy. They say it's not the answer but I can't carry on. Cause I got nowhere, no one. Without you boy I'm done. And when I'm gone, remember you're the one. And just because I fight. Don't mean that I never learned how to love. You know devils don't fly. So don't expect me not to fall. Devils don't fly (fly, fly fly). But God we almost had it all. But I got chains and you got wings. You know that life ain't fair sometimes. Devils don't fly, fly, fly. But I try. What's a girl to do when she's not strong. When everyone that holds my hand. Gets cut from all the thorns. I used to put my ear against the wall. To hear the screams, to hear the fall. More reasons to escape it all. And it's not the answer but I can carry on. I give my best smile, my last dime. But I'm always getting wrong. It's not 'cause I'm young or from a broken home. Maybe I'm just fight, 'cause I don't know where I belong. You know devils don't fly. So don't expect me not to fall. Devils don't fly (fly, fly fly). Thank God we almost had it all. But I got chains and you got wings. You know that life ain't fair sometimes. Devils don't fly, fly, fly. But I try. Angels were never meant to fall. And you were the loveliest of all. If I thought God could fix it. I pray for your forgiveness. But I've been cast out thrown out. When I crossed to the other side. No devils don't fly!. You know devils don't fly. So don't expect me not to fall. Devils don't fly (fly, fly fly). Thank God we almost had it all. But I got chains and you got wings. You know that life ain't fair sometimes. Devils don't fly, fly, fly. But I try. But I try"

Through the best days of our lives. We would walk right down the pavement. I know we're gonna be just fine. And I'll put on my dancing shoes real tight. 'Cause it's just another saturday night. Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh. Just another saturday night. Oh oh oh, oh oh oh. Another fist, another wall. We lose ourselves, we lose it all. I wrote him a hundred times. Can you hear my heart. Through the prison bars?. The boys I kiss don't know my name. The tears I cry all taste of blame. Bad luck and dirty cops. I'm a fucking teenage tragedy. I walk lonely streets and I talk big time dreams. So hold on before you see. That you're better off without me. 'Cause when I look up from the pavement. I know we're gonna be just fine. And i'll put on my dancing shoes real tight. 'Cause it's just another saturday night. Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh. Just another saturday night. Oh oh oh, oh oh oh.

Pills fall like diamonds from my purse. Right out the hole in my fur coat. Straight out the gutter goes my antidote. To a broken girl. I promise I'll be the one you want. Don't tell me I'm unfixable. You don't know what it's like. To be seventeen with no place to go. But give me just one night. And I'll be almost fine. Remind me one more time. It's the best days of our lives.

So he packed his bags and jumped on the cheapest flight. It?s kinda funny. In the summer everybody falls in love. Like there living in this heart shaped bubble. Then there?s trouble cuz? one of them gotta go home. So long left you standing in a puddle. I saw this girl with about as much style. As a blind dog looking like she dressing with the lights off. Got a pretty little body. But it?s kind of like a graph cuz? her make-up is right off. Some girls date really nice guys. Tell ?em lies cuz? they know they got cash in there pocket. Some guys need to read those minds. Cuz? they don?t like you but there loving of your wallet. Hey boy ain't you the one from the show. Looking at me like you ain?t see me before. Hey boy looks like you?re ready to roll. But this lil? genius ain?t for me anymore. Guys want girls girls want guys. To be open honest break no promise. Always doing the right thing they say. To bring a smile to your face every single day. Guys that special take control. But they don?t know all the games that we play. They been getting it wrong for soo long. But it?s not there fault we out to tell it to them straight. Relationships are like chocolate chips. Life is the ice cream and you?re the lips. And if it don?t taste good. Then you know you gotta spit it in you napkin. Otherwise you just get sick sick sick. And the games in the chase. So I'll stick stick stick to my wands to avoid all the conflicts. Cuz? this love game gonna get you whipped. If you wanna take a dip i don?t make no promise. Hey boy ain?t you the one from the show. Looking at me like you ain?t see me before. Hey boy looks like you?re ready to roll. But this lil? genius ain?t for me anymore x2. Go verbal go verbal go verbal go verbal. Yeah say it how it is, say it how it is 2x. Créditos: ActivateKillsBr"

I just wanna feel myself for a minute. I want a guy I can climb like Everest. God etiquette, real therapy. He don't gotta be to cleverest. Hips and lips, intelligent. (Pre-Chorus).

Got locked up for a while. I was 14 and I decided you know... I was gonna leave home. And be a... a somebody or whatever. And uhm... like numerous failed attempts. Bad TV shows, bad record deal, bad everything. And I have moved to Hollywood to be a big star. And ended up living in these motels. On sunset boulevard you know. 30 dollars a night really run down. And I would go to these clothing stores at the weekends. To try out these beautiful clothes things I could never afford. Practicing for when I was gonna be rich. You know bad boyfriend, no money, no life. And suddenly it hit me. What the fuck am I doing with my life?. (Chorus) x2. I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself"

I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself. (Talking). Ok this is the part where I talk about myself right?. So after my daddy got uhmm you know... lost everything. Got locked up for a while. I was 14 and I decided you know... I was gonna leave home. And be a... a somebody or whatever. And uhm... like numerous failed attempts. Bad TV shows, bad record deal, bad everything. And I have moved to Hollywood to be a big star. And ended up living in these motels. On sunset boulevard you know. 30 dollars a night really run down. And I would go to these clothing stores at the weekends. To try out these beautiful clothes things I could never afford. Practicing for when I was gonna be rich. You know bad boyfriend, no money, no life. And suddenly it hit me. What the fuck am I doing with my life?. (Chorus) x2. I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself. I just wanna feel myself"

No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. I'll never want you back. I'll never want you back. Take your clothes off. Turn the lights off. You're the best I've ever had.

heaven,"Yesterday you were in front of me. Woke up this morning, all of sudden you're a memory. If life is short as they say it is. I guess we'll meet again sooner than we think we will. They say a picture says a thousand words. But I would trade a thousand pictures to hear one of yours. And I've been saying prayers like I was writing you letters. Cause if heaven's far like I think it is you wouldn't get'em. I know heaven must be beautiful right now. Since they got you baby. Since they got you babe. I know heaven must be beautiful right now. Since they got you baby. Since they took you babe. They say the god is full of misteries. Sometimes I wonder if you tell him that you're missing me?. Cause I miss you everyday like they took summer away. Like they took colour away. And this grey needs to get the hell away from me. And I'm jealous of the angels, cause they see you everyday. And I see you when I'm dreaming, but it doesn't feel the same. And I know my heart is broken, but you can have it anyway. If I coud only see you again. I know heaven must be beautiful right now. Since they got you baby. Since they got you babe. I know heaven must be beautiful right now. Since they got you baby. Since they took you babe. I'd give my life for one last time with you. I'd give my life for one last time with you. Got my spacesuit on. Gona blast off. Take a vacation to where you are. Hoping heaven ain't all that far. And you past me by on a shooting star. Cause I wish so bad... one last chance. Take me back to the photograph. I close my eyes and I feel you laugh. But all I got is frame and glass. Is it selfishness?. Shouda made room for the both of us. Loneliness, I'm not lost but I've got no direction. Parachute gone and I'm falling fast. My heart has stopped but I'm still breathing. Gone numb but still I'm feeling. The less I look the more I'm seeing I just lost my hero. I know heaven must be beautiful right now,. Since they got you baby,. Since they got you babe.. I know heaven must be beautiful right now,. Since they got you baby.. Since they took you babe.. . Créditos: @ActivateKillsBr"
hey boy,"Go verbal go verbal go verbal go verbal. Yeah say it how it is, say it how it is 2x. Let me start from the top with this track. Sit back listen to me chat and relax. All the girls doing this and that. But the guys to busy watching me for that. But I?m in love with rap and there?s no going back. I?ll tell you in advance don't make no plans. Don?t be making drama like a desperada. If you wanna be my buddy then I?m down for that. Some girls try too hard to impress. To attracting my man. To make it look effortless as you can. Some guys so oblivious to a girl. Who?s a catch cuz? there brains in there pants. Some guys make such a fuss i think there boyfriends heads gun bust. But I?m sick of this love thing lust thing impluse making fools out of us. Hey boy ain?t you the one from the show. Looking at me like you ain?t see me before. Hey boy looks like you?re ready to roll. But this lil? genius ain?t for me anymore. Georgy porgy thought he was fly. Kissed all the girls and he made them cry. Got a lot of dads really mad. So he packed his bags and jumped on the cheapest flight. It?s kinda funny. In the summer everybody falls in love. Like there living in this heart shaped bubble. Then there?s trouble cuz? one of them gotta go home. So long left you standing in a puddle. I saw this girl with about as much style. As a blind dog looking like she dressing with the lights off. Got a pretty little body. But it?s kind of like a graph cuz? her make-up is right off. Some girls date really nice guys. Tell ?em lies cuz? they know they got cash in there pocket. Some guys need to read those minds. Cuz? they don?t like you but there loving of your wallet. Hey boy ain't you the one from the show. Looking at me like you ain?t see me before. Hey boy looks like you?re ready to roll. But this lil? genius ain?t for me anymore. Guys want girls girls want guys. To be open honest break no promise. Always doing the right thing they say. To bring a smile to your face every single day. Guys that special take control. But they don?t know all the games that we play. They been getting it wrong for soo long. But it?s not there fault we out to tell it to them straight. Relationships are like chocolate chips. Life is the ice cream and you?re the lips. And if it don?t taste good. Then you know you gotta spit it in you napkin. Otherwise you just get sick sick sick. And the games in the chase. So I'll stick stick stick to my wands to avoid all the conflicts. Cuz? this love game gonna get you whipped. If you wanna take a dip i don?t make no promise. Hey boy ain?t you the one from the show. Looking at me like you ain?t see me before. Hey boy looks like you?re ready to roll. But this lil? genius ain?t for me anymore x2. Go verbal go verbal go verbal go verbal. Yeah say it how it is, say it how it is 2x. Créditos: ActivateKillsBr"

Throwing up all on your best friend's new purse. Girl girl you thought he loves you now. Cuz he bought a couple of rounds. When he left your house he didn't leave his number. Hot mess, hot hot mess. She's a hot mess. Hot mess, hot hot mess. Jocking on my hot mess. Hot mess, hot hot mess. She's a hot mess. Hot mess, hot hot mess. Jocking on my hot mess. I'm not the kind of girl getting dressed in the dark. I've got a mirror in my purse and a fog on my arm. I'll be exclusive for my Gucci, but a whore for Dior. It's not the labels or the tables, but how we got it all. No this ain't fashion week. I can let my clothe and my actions speak. Straw Carabella and my coat Margiela. Don't look at the weather. Just whether I see my face on TV. next time maybe. Girls cold their eye cuz they so mad. I could look fresh in a potato sack. Tell me what kind of chapeau is that. Que c'est sa vie?. How they say in France. when I'm walking past. Shirt so hot, shoes so hot. Talk to me babe, show me what you got. Walk for me babe, show me what you got. That shirt so hot, shoes so hot.

love is a suicide,"You like the smell of blood. When it's pumping like a factory. You like your words to cut. You like to choose the best artillery. I wonder who you're thinking of. Who am I.

Nowhere to go, I'm already inside, you know. Don't want to love you like I love you. This love is a suicide. love is a suicide. love is a suicide. love is a suicide. It feels so surgical. How you dissect every mistake I make. You're like an animal. You bite me hard with every breath I take. When I'm on the ledge. You won't let me fall. Rope around my neck. But you won't take it up. And I'm hearin voices sayin'. Go ahead and commit it. Just go ahead and commit. You can run you can hide, but sooner or later. it's gonna cut like a knife, sooner or later. Nowhere to go, I'm already inside, you know. No one'll love ya like I love ya. Cause love is a suicide. love is a suicide. love is a suicide. love is a suicide. Close your eyes, count to ten. Take the bullet out again. Say my name, hit me hard.. Put that gun right to my heart. BANG!. This love is a suicide (Love is, love is). Love is a suicide (Suicide, suicide).

marlboro lights,"Say you don't love me. Say you don't want me anymore. Tell me it's over, it's over. I'll open my bottle. But no I ain't opening this door. Bath water gets colder. So just say it's over. 'Cause my pocket's broke. My soul is stone. I ruined you again. And a lonely bridge. A rooftop ledge. Could just fix everything. But when I'm alone on the longest nights. I think of you and your Marlboro Lights. And I, I get a bit better. And I'll lay here on the bedroom floor. While your feet walk out. And your daggers fall. And I, I get a little bit better. Say you'll forget me. Say you'll erase me from your mind. Right from the day of our doomed beauty. I saw my future in your eyes. Save the words you've rehearsed. We both know I won't be fine. 'Cause you know that fate won't take my bribes. And I only want what's never mine. So you break the door. You break my heart. You ruin me again. And the passing trucks. And loaded guns. Never could fix anything. But when I'm alone on the longest nights. I think of you and your Marlboro lights. And I, I get a bit better And. I'll lay here on the bedroom floor. While your feet walk out. And your daggers fall. And I, I get a little bit better. When love is made so renegade. You know you're going down in flames. And if our hearts must share a grave. At least can we be friends?. You shoot your words they knock me down. Like rubber bullets raining out. They bounce right off and I get up again. But if no one understands me. At least you could pretend. I never knew when love was true. But I know it's the end. But I'll be here 'til chaos calls. And god ain't listening anymore. 'Cause I, I know that we could be better. And I'll stay here to defy our fears. Even though I know it'll end in tears. 'Cause I, I know that we could be better. When I'm alone on the longest nights. I think of you and your Marlboro lights. And I, I couldn't be better"

television,"Hello Mr. Officer. We're just having fun. You can take the handcuffs off. I promise we won't run. Speed boats and Versace coats. An olive in my glass. Jail bird scars and gold tooth smiles. They love my rich girl class. You took away our money. But you'll never take away our love. And we'll never go to heaven. But who needs to when you live this good?. 'Cause men will fight. And girls will lie. Just like on the television. So don't tell us. That this ain't right. It's just like on the television. The silence. The violence. We don't need to be forgiven. Your business. Go mind it. Cause this ain't fucking Jerry Springer. We say our lines. We do the time. We're just like on the television. Television. If I paint my sins white. Will it make me pure again?. If I wet my mascara eyes. Will the witness be my friend?. Nicotine and low life dreams. Have never felt so warm. When your father's on the bottle. And your mother's on the floor. Got the whole town looking through our window. Every day of the week. On the run, fuck the fun. No this isn't like the movies scenes. 'Cause men will fight. And girls will lie. Just like on the television. So don't tell us. That this ain't right. It's just like on the television. The silence. The violence.

""Bad mistakes and good intentions"". Ain't what they're saying about us in the papers. Fast forward? No. Can't change the station. If it's 7 years. Then 7 years I'm waiting for you. Where I'm from. It all goes wrong. It's not like on the television. The darkest days. Don't fade away. Can't turn it off like television. They laugh and they wave. Behind the glass they're there to stay. But our script, it don't fit. You know bad guy always pays. Now I'm alone. There's no one home. So I turn on my television"
the raven,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,. Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,. While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,. As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.. ""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door. Only this, and nothing more."". Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,. And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.. Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow. From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore. For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore. Nameless here for evermore.. And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain. Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;. So that now, I still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,. ""'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door. Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;. This it is, and nothing more."". Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,. ""Sir,"" said I, ""or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;. But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,. And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,. That I scarce was sure I heard you"" - here. I opened wide the door;. Darkness there, and nothing more.. Deep into that darkness peering, long. I stood there wondering, fearing,. Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;. But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,. And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore!"". This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore!"". Merely this, and nothing more.. Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,. Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.. ""Surely,"" said I, ""surely that is something at my window lattice:. Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore. Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;. 'Tis the wind and nothing more."". Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,. In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;. Not the least obeisance made he;. not a minute stopped or stayed he;. But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door. Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door. Perched, and sat, and nothing more.. Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,. By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.. ""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"". I said, ""art sure no craven,. Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore. Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"". Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."". ""Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,"". I shrieked, upstarting. ""Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!. Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!. Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust above my door!. Take thy beak from out my heart,. and take thy form from off my door!"". Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."". And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting. On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;. And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,. And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws. his shadow on the floor;. And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor. Shall be lifted - nevermore!"
