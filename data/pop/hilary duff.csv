breathe in. breathe out.,"I remember what I wore on our first date. I remember how you felt against my face. I remember all the songs we used to hate. I remember we were sleepless in New York.

(Hey, hey, hey, hey!). (Hey, hey, hey, hey!). When seasons change and ""maybe's"" turn to ""never's"". You learn that nothing lasts. Looking ahead, it seems like life will last forever. But time, it moves so fast. You can dream or you can wish upon a star. And toss your coins into a well. Or you can stare down all your fears right in their eyes. Leaving an echo that will yell. Belong, oh-ooh-oh-oh. We're right where we belong. When was the last time you did something for the first time?. When was the first time you did something for the last time?. Let's find a million things that we could do the first time. You never know-oh, this could be the last time. And we can leave our story like nothing ever told.

The little Voice in my head is never mislead. All of this Noise is what keeps me from making a mess. The little voice in my head just won't let me get with you.

Dragged up from the underworld. Just like some precious pearl. CHORUS X1. Pay no mind to what they say. it doesn't matter anyway. our lips are sealed. Hush my darling. Don't you cry. Cryin' angels.

outlaw,"I don't wanna behave. don't wanna wait for Saturday. it's been a shitty day. And mercury's in retrograde. Cause I'm sick of doing what they tell me. Sick and tired of trying to please.

Nobody's gonna bring me down. I feel like an outlaw. And me mugging in my getaway car. Pretending like I run this town. Nobody's gonna bring me down. So pour me some J. B.

party up,"Artist: Hilary Duff. Album: Metamorphosis. Song: Party Up. . Lyrics :. You are driving me out of my mind. 'Cause you take me everywhere but out at night. What more do you need for me to get with you. [CHORUS:]. I didn't see this coming. Why don't you start me up?. There's no more messin' around. (Come on and light me up). This could be the start of something. Why don't you party-up. Time for you to come on down. I dream about it in my sleep. You seem to like me better when I creep. This time I won't lose. [CHORUS]. You roll me, you use me, you love me and then. You wrap me up and reel me in and use me again. You love me, you hate me, you say it's the end. I know you are gonna do it again and again....

picture this,"Half-dressed, sunrise. midnight, your eyes. Heartbeat, your bed. Sound out what we said. Drink after drink, watch you lean into me. I stare at the floor, bring our eyes up to me. It's all I don't know, your words make me weak. I knew from the start you've taken me. It's not how I pictured this. It's better than it. But we regret the things we said. Picture it getting better than this. Let it live inside our head. Let our hearts cross the line, it's time. I pictured this, it's better than it. Let's leave it where we'll both be missed. Cold cheeks, warm touch. The taste of your tongue. Low lights, your hands. Night time, our time. Kiss after kiss as we lay in the sheets. If heaven is real, then how does it dream?. It's all I don't know, your words make me weak. I knew from the start you've taken me. It's not how I pictured this. It's better than it. But we regret the things we said. Picture it getting better than this. Let it live inside our head. Let our hearts cross the line, it's time. I pictured this, it's better than it. Let's leave it where we'll both be missed. Blurry eyed and tongue tied. Tripping over landmines. Gettin' lost in your mind. Tripping over landlines. Hands creep down my waist. Little slower, now. Hands creep down my waist. Let me show you how. It's not how I pictured this. It's better than it. But we regret the things we said. Picture it getting better than this. Let it live inside our head. Let our hearts cross the line, it's time. I pictured this, it's better than it. Let's leave it where we'll both be missed"

raise your voice,"I found myself today. Oh I found myself and ran away. But somthing pulled me back. the voice of reason, I forgot i had. All I know is you´re not here to say. What you always used to say. But it´s written in the sky tonight. Refrão. So I won´t give up no I won´t break down. Sooner than it seems life turns around. And I will be strong. Even if it all goes wrong. When I´m stading in the dark, I´ll still believe. Someone´s watching over me. I´ve seen that bright light. And i´ts shining on my destiny. Shining all the time, and I won´t be afraid. To follow everywhere it´s taking me. All I know is yesterday is gone. And right now I belong. To this moment, to my dreams. (Refrão). It doesn´t matter what people say. And it doesn´t matter how long it takes. Believe in yourself and you´ll fly high. And it only matters how true you are. Be true yourself and follow your heart.

Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you. There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray. It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day. We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop. At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop. Pop! Pop! Pop!. There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy. When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie. It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives. These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives"

What you always used to say. But it's written in the sky tonight. [CHORUS]. So I won't give up. No, I won't break down. Sooner than it seems life turns around. And I will be strong. Even if it all goes wrong. When I'm standing in the dark. I'll still believe. Someone's watching over me. I´ve Seen that red light. And it's shining on my destiny. Shining all the time. And I won't be afraid. To follow everywhere its taking me. All I know is yesterday is gone. And right now I belong. To this moment to my dreams. [REPEAT CHORUS]. It doesn't matter what people say. It doesn't matter how long it takes. Believe in yourself. And you'll fly high. And it only matters how true you are. Be true to yourself. And follow your heart. So I won't give up. No, I won't break down. Sooner than it seems life turns around. And I will be strong. Even if it all goes wrong. When I'm standing in the dark. I'll still believe. That I won't give up. No, I won't break down. Sooner than it seems life turns around. And I will be strong. Even when it all goes wrong. When I'm standing in the dark. I'll still believe. That someone's watching over.

sparks,"I can't hear a single word. Just know you're talking 'cause your lips keep movin'. Everything I though I learned. Goes out the window, all I want is one thing. You can promise castles, treasures. Babies, I don't care. 'Cause for now you're just enough for me. I want you near. Like a fairytale to feel your breath. Right on my neck. You remember what I love. So baby take me back. Turn the lights down low. And kiss me in the dark. 'Cause when you're touching me. Baby, I see sparks. You make my heart go. You. You, you make my heart go. You. You, you make my heart go. Ticking, tocking like a bomb. Throws me back to when I had you closer. Skin to skin we get it on. Without the love I feel you going bolder. You can promise castles, treasures. Babies, I don't care. 'Cause for now you're just enough for me. I want you near. Like a fairytale to feel your breath. Right on my neck. You remember what I love. So baby take me back. Turn the lights down low. And kiss me in the dark. 'Cause when you're touching me. Baby, I see sparks. You make my heart go. You. You, you make my heart go. You.

stay in love,"We're like broken glass, often by the sea. Holding onto things we don't really need. Our edges used to fit together perfectly. Why does something good always start to bleed?. Hurting, hearts go wild, bruised up, broken down. Praised you, many times, one big lie. Passion, washed away, fake it, fake today. Please give up and just say goodbye. Stay in love, give me a reason. Holding on just for the weekend, crave the world. We're barely breathing, no-oh. Stay in love, give me a reason. Do you remember when I said I'd die for you?. Every single day pretend it's true. Do you remember when I said I'd die for you?. Holding on just for the weekend. All is said and done, all the fights I fought. Trapped each other and waiting to get caught. Two words sitting in the air is all we got. Baby I love you, but we need to break up. Hurting, hearts go wild, bruised up, broken down. Praised you, many times, one big lie. Passion, washed away, fake it, fake today. Please give up and just say goodbye. Stay in love, give me a reason. Holding on just for the weekend, crave the world. We're barely breathing, no-oh. Stay in love, give me a reason. Do you remember when I said I'd die for you?. Every single day pretend it's true. Do you remember when I said I'd die for you?. Holding on just for the weekend. Thought, we'd be different from the rest. I guess just like everybody, everybody else. Thought, we'd be different from the rest. I guess just like everybody, everybody else. Like everybody else, no. Stay in love, give me a reason. Holding on just for the weekend, crave the world. We're barely breathing, no-oh. Stay in love, give me a reason. Do you remember when I said I'd die for you?.

On my list, is just one wish, that it would snow tonight.. When the snow comes down in Tinseltown you'll be dancing in Hollywood.. Slippin and sliding and sleigh riding all over the neighborhood.. You'll be rocking with a stocking on your head so the cold wont get to you.. On Christmas Eve you can believe that wishes do come true.. Oh, when the snow comes down, oh in Tinseltown.. On Christmas Eve, you will believe when the snow comes down in Tinseltown.. You close your eyes, and to your surprise, you see the reindeer fly.. It's choir singing fa la la la la, go walking by.. Singing and ringing ride along and church bells in the air.. It seems so real, that you can feel the snowflakes in your hair.. Oh, when the snow comes down, oh in Tinseltown.. On Christmas Eve you will believe when the snow comes down in Tinseltown!. In the morning, when you awake, your face all shining bright!. And when you look outside you see the palm trees trusting wide!!. Dear Santa, thank you, thank you for that perfect Christmas day. Gliding down. the streets of Hollywood, in a one horse open sleigh!. (Instrumental Break). Oh, when the snow comes down, oh in Tinseltown.. On Christmas Eve you will believe when the snow comes down in Tinseltown!. Oh, when the snow comes down, oh in Tinseltown.. On Christmas Eve you will believe when the snow comes down in Tinseltown!. Oh, when the snow comes down, oh in Tinseltown.. On Christmas Eve you will believe when the snow comes down in Tinseltown!. Oh, when the snow comes down, oh in Tinseltown.. On Christmas Eve, you will believe when the snow comes down in Tinseltown!."
where did i go right?,"I'm always too late. I see the train leaving. I'm always laughing. When it's not cool to smile. I'm always aiming. But somehow keep missing. So how did you get here. Something is wrong. [CHORUS:]. Where did I go right. How did I get you. How come all this blue sky is around me. And you found me. Where did I go right. How did I get you. I don't know how I did. But somehow now I do. I'm always driving. Forget where I'm going. Should have turned left. But I was singing some song. And I, I am arriving. As everyone's leaving. But there you are waiting. Something is wrong. [CHORUS]. Makes no sense to me. No it isn't clear. But somehow you're standing here. Something gets to me. It's that nothing is wrong. [CHORUS 2X]"
who's that girl,"There were places we would go at midnight. There are secrets left nobody else would know. There's a reason but. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't know why. I thought they all belong to me. [CHORUS]. Who's that girl?. Where's she from?. No, she can't be the one. That you want. That has stolen my world. It's not real. It's not right. It's my day. It's my night. By the way, who's that girl?. Living my life. Oh, no. Livin' my life. Seems like everything's the same around me. Then I look again and everything has changed. I'm not dreaming so. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't know why. She's everywhere I want to be. [REPEAT CHORUS]. I'm the one. Who made you laugh. Who made you feel. and made you sad. I'm not sorry. For what we did. For who we were. I'm not sorry. I'm not hurt. [REPEAT CHORUS]. Oh, no. Livin' my life"
why not,"Ah ah ah ya ah ya aha yah laah. Ah ah ah ya ah ya aha yah lah. You think you're going nowhere. When you're walking down the street. Acting like you just don't care. when life could be so sweet. why you wanna be like that. as if there's nothing new. you're not fooling no one. you're not even fooling you. So walk a little slower. and open up your eyes. Sometimes it's so hard to see. The good things passing by. There may never be a sign. No flashing neon light. Telling you to make you move. Or when the time is right. [Chorus]. (So) Why not (why not). Take a crazy chance. Why not (why not). Do a crazy dance. If you lose a moment. You might lose a lot. So why not. Why not. Why not. Take a crazy chance. Why not. Take a crazy chance. You always dress in yellow. When you wanna dress in gold. Instead of listen to your heart. You do just what you're told. You keep waiting where you are. For what you'll never know. Let's just get into your car. And go baby go. [Chorus]. (So) Why not (why not). Take a crazy chance. Why not (why not). Do a crazy dance. If you lose a moment. You might lose a lot. So why not. Why not. Oh. I could be the one for you. Oh, yeah. Maybe yes, maybe no. Oh. It could be the thing to do. What I'm saying is. You gotta let me know. You'll never get to heaven. Or even to L.A. If you don't believe there's a way. Why not (why not). Take a star from the sky. Why not (why not). Spread your wings and fly. Oh, It might take a little. And it might take a lot. But why not. Why not. [Chorus]. (So) Why not (why not). Take a crazy chance. Why not (why not). Do a crazy dance. If you lose a moment. You might lose a lot. So why not. Why not"
