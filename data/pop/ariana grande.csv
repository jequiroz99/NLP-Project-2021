best mistake (feat. big sean),"[Ariana Grande]. As soon do we forget how we felt. Dealing with emotions that never left. Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game. Maybe I'm the sinner, and you are the saint. Gotta stop pretending what we ain't. Why we pointing fingers anyway?. We're all the same. Break up, make up. Total waste of time. Can we please make up our minds?. And stop acting like we're blind. Cause if the water dries up. And the moon stops shining. Stars fall, and the world goes blind.

[Big Sean]. I guess times wasting. Tick tocking lip locking. How can we keep the feelings fresh. How do we zip lock them. Wear your heart up on your sleeves. So watch out for pickpockets. I guess to go the distance. We might need to pit stop it. Hold love, I know love can be. A beach with no shore. I done count to ten lost my temper and went back to four. I know sometimes it's hard to realize. I'm the man that you need. I had a dream we branched out started a family tree. And I feel like everything we do is overdue. You asked why I love your mom so much. Cause she's an older you. I wish that you were happy. I guess that's the one thing I should be providing. Ain't no number twos we both ones and ones we the oddest. Couple only human except you, you a goddess. Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest. When you start as friends. It's hard to say you're never going back. If I'm not the one. Then I'm the best mistake you ever had. Break up, make up. Total waste of time. Can we please make up our minds?. And stop acting like we're blind. 'Cause if the water dries up. And the moon stops shining. Stars fall, and the world goes blind. Boy you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

We'll change the pace and just go slow. Won't ever have to worry,. You won't ever have to hide. If you seen all my mistakes. So look me in my eyes. Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do. I'll take care of you. I've loved and I've lost. It's my birthday, I get high if I want to. Can't deny that I want to, but I lie if have to. Cause you don't say you love me. To your friend when they ask you. Even though we both know that you do (you do). One time, been in love one time. You and all your girls in the club one time. All so convinced that you're following your heart. Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes. We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed. I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know. We know, You hate being alone. When you ain't the only one. You hate the fact that you bought the dream. And they sold you one. You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you. Instead they said.... No, tell me. I do not care. If you're hurt. I did not tell you. You do not care. It feels good. Know you've been hurt by someone else. I can tell by the way you carry yourself. If you let me, here's what I'll do. I'll take care of you. I've loved and I've lost"

the beauty within you,"When your reflection. And what you want it to be. Oh no. You change your clothes. Change your hair. Change your makeup. But you still don’t like the vision you see. I wish it were that easy. When your rejection. Is only coming from you. Oh no. The way you walk. Way you talk, every second. You can’t believe what life’s been putting you through. It’s time. To take a look inside. The beauty within you. Whoa oh oh oh. It’s the hardest thing to find. Oh oh oh oh. As the mirror makes you blind. To who you really are. Cause you’re beautiful like a shining star. You can love the world with all your heart. But to love yourself is the. Hardest part. When your emotions. Have got the better of you. Oh no, no. You start to scream. Hit the walls. Start to freak out. You can’t believe what life’s been putting you through. It’s time to take a look inside. The beauty within you. Oh oh oh oh.

the heart of the matter,"I got the call today, I didn't wanna hear. But I knew that it would come. An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone. She said you found someone. And I thought of all the bad luck. And all the struggles we went through. How I lost me and you lost you. What are these voices outside love's open door. Make us throw off our contentment. And beg for something more?. I've been learning to live without you now. But I miss you sometimes. The more I know, the less I understand. All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning them again. I've been tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter. But my will gets weak. And my thoughts seem to scatter. But I think it's about forgiveness. Forgiveness. Even if, even if you don't love me anymore. These times are so uncertain. There's a yearning undefined. And people filled with rage. We all need a little tenderness. How can love survive in such a graceless age. And the trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness. They're the very things we kill, I guess. Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms. And the work they put between us. You know it doesn't keep us warm. I've been learning to live without you now. But I miss you sometimes. The more I know, the less I understand. All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning them again. I've been tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter. But my will gets weak. And my thoughts seem to scatter. But I think it's about forgiveness. Forgiveness. Even if, even if you don't love me anymore. Even if you don't love me anymore"

Do you think the Wizard is dumb?. Or, like Munchkins, so small-minded?. No! He'll say to me. I see who you truly are. A girl on whom I can rely!. And that's how we'll begin. The Wizard and I. Once I'm with the Wizard. My whole life will change. 'Cuz once you're with the Wizard. No one thinks you're strange!. No father is not proud of you. No sister acts ashamed. And all of Oz has to love you. When by the Wizard you're acclaimed. And this gift, or this curse. I have inside. Maybe at last, I'll know why. When we are hand and hand. The Wizard and.

The Wizard and I. Yes, what a pair we'll be. The Wizard and. Unlimited. My future is unlimited. And I've just had a vision. Almost like a prophecy. I know it sounds truly crazy. And true, the vision's hazy. But I swear, someday there'll be. A celebration throughout Oz. That's all to do with me!. And I'll stand there with the Wizard. Feeling things I've never felt. And though I'd never show it. I'll be so happy, I could melt!. And so it will be. For the rest of my life. And I'll want nothing else. Till I die. Held in such high esteem. When people see me, they will scream. For half of Oz's fav'rite team. The Wizard. And I"
