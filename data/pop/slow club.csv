tears of joy,"Back in the summer. You said it was cracked. But you didn't want it. But you wanted it back. And the air is no good here. But you think you'll come back. And you needed a door way. And you needed to see. What happens when you give yourself back to me. And you'll rest on a moon beam. And hope no-one sees. Oh your. Tears, tears, tears of joy. Tears, tears, tears of joy. Well I'm holding you heart. And I'm ready to stay. If you gave me your heart. I'm ready oh oh I'm ready for it. And the concert halls screaming. You took a bow. From the floor to the ceiling. The curtain came down. And I wrote all my dreams in. The dust on the ground. Forget that old future. The future is dead. It'll twist and turn all. The thoughts in your head. Until you feel seasick. While you're laid on your bed. Drying all of those. Tears, tears, tears of joy. Tears, tears, tears of joy. Well I'm holding you heart. And I'm ready to stay. If you gave me your heart. I'm ready oh oh I'm ready for it. It's never gonna be the same. If it was easy would you feel this way. Now there's nothing left for us to do. Except for you to be good to me. And me be good to you. Tears, tears, tears of joy. Tears, tears, tears of joy. Well I'm holding you heart. And I'm ready to stay. If you gave me your heart. I'm ready oh oh I'm ready for it. Well I'm holding you heart.

because we're dead,"Well, I don't know what i'm doing here. I could say that I do but I don't. You could wrap a million candles. Into a torch and hope that it steers you home. You could cut all the telephone wires. And hope that nobody does get through. I might not have the power of telepathy. But, I'm gonna be contacting you. Because i borrowed a book that I saw. Was planted deep inside your bag. It gave me an excuse to see you again. But I'm not a theif I'll give it back. Don't you ever wonder. Who's living in that house. It's too small for people we all said. But there's people in the floorboards said the mouse. And I showed you the things that I'd made. You didn't think that they were too great. But I'm glad that you thought of it. Think what you're taught. Because everybody else's mind is grey. We kept up the act for. Two-wo-wo-wo-wo dates before it needed blue.

To go sailing on down your way. But you poured petrol all over. The ship you used to sail the sea. You didn't think that you'd be coming home again. So, you said Bye to me. Don't you ever ponder. On things we never said. Yes I did. But when we were kids. Now it's too late. Because we're dead. Because we're dead. Because we're dead. Because we're dead"
apples and pairs,"Open up both your eyes. Stay mine shut, I don't mind. Pylons bust, right outside. But all I hear is you. Remember when it rained all day. No playtime locked away. Dancing to the beat of rain. Will it ever stop?. Cos we are a pair of apples. That we'd share after the stretch. But for fifteen minutes or so. We were there. Nervous walks in a park. I never knew could get so dark. I'm running out of things to say, will you please start talking. About yourself or your family. Any friends, I've got one two three. But they are all imaginary. Come and stroke the air. We are a pair of apples. That we'd share after the stretch. But for fifteen minutes or so. We were there. Brand new sheets, let's break them in. Underneath our feathered skin. I feel your warmth, you let me in. Shall we stop, let's stop. I look at you, you look away. It's the beginning of the end today. Three more weeks, and we could say. We mirrored the world. Cos we are a pair of apples. That we'd share after the stretch. But for fifteen minutes or so. We were there"

I met a boy who grew up in the mountains. He really loved God and got me thinking about things. Like appreciating everyone that I can call a friend. Seeing life as a group of tests to see through to the end. But I'm a quitter, I don't think he knew. That I'm still thinking about you. I'm a quitter and I'm ashamed. He said he'd come back for my brain. And you say baby a lot in your songs. It takes all my courage not to sing along. And now my beating heart belongs to my drum.

dance 'till the morning light,"There are things in my wallet I will never use. I'm the fifty-first member of a god-awful group. Connected by rain they said we're all the same. But I don't know, I don't know, if they're telling the truth. Like a field of rice, I've grown out of view. An Olympian came to fill the shoes you knew. Oh he could reach the sockets that I could never twist. So now you can cross me off that goddamn list. Cause there's always that someone. Who'll be easier on your eyes. So forget the politics of living alone. And just dance 'till the morning light. I saw you in the background the other day. On a television to some story-grey. You sat on the steps of the New Court House. Spinning that wheel you said you'd show me how. You chased me through the carriage on a train. But I reached the next one before you came. And I pulled out the pin between yours and mine. I kept going; you got left behind. Cause there's always that someone. Who'll be easier on your eyes. So forget the politics of living alone. And just dance 'till the morning light. I heard you were looking for a man to lead. Well, I can tell you that I'm not the one you need. I'm always three steps behind the dance and the time. So if I can't change for you, I won't change for me. Oh as stubborn as it is, as stubborn as I am. I can tell you that there is no pearl in this clam. Oh a diamond maybe, I stole it see. But it was only to try and get you home with me. When there's always that someone. Who'll be easier on your eyes. So forget the politics of living alone. And just dance 'till the morning light"
dependable people and things that i am sure,"I know that he loves me. As I watch him leave. I do anything at all. To hear his voice call me. But now there's a shadow. Where once there had been. He's searching for color. In a sepia scene. And the cold wind blows. Like my grip on a string. And I held so close. Now he's not listening. He's not listening. But I can go out there. I can be someone else. You all have the power to. Do this shit to ourselves. But in the quiet times. When nobody can see. I'm letting my thoughts get bigger than me. And the cold wind blows. And the spring never came. And I feel so sick if I hear his name. (OOh, ooh). Oh how he left me. Cause we went too far. I looked at my body. I learned how to drive a car. I have my family. And I have my friends. But oh how I wanted. To be with him again. And I know he's somewhere that he wants to be. And I only wish he wanted that with me. But I can run further than I could before. And I can laugh louder. I can dance till I'm sore. Then in the morning eye. I can do it again. I just have to keep moving. Don't ever stop moving. And all of this envy. And all of this fear. Will just be a memory. Of a shitty year. And I'm so much older than I want to be. But there's so much more if I take it easy. (OOh, ooh)"
giving up on love,"We’ve been over and over. This thing we call love. And I’ve been thinking about. What my friends would say. If I were to give it up. Cause I’ve been tired and hopeful (I’ve been hurting inside). For far too long now (too long now). So I’m giving it up, giving up, giving up on love. Giving up on love. Hold back, you’ve got me all wrong. And now it’s like it’s over before it’s even begun. You need to sit back and take it as a test. If you’d given me straight answers I would never have had to guess. Cause I’ve been tired and hopeful (I’ve been hurting inside). For far too long now (too long now). So I’m giving it up, giving up, giving up on love. Giving up on love. And it was obvious from the start. We were the only ones with hearts. And you pull mine apart. With the things that you do. The house was falling from the cliffs. It is only glass and brick. If you throw enough it sticks. I learnt that before. It’s a battle not a war. Cause we’ve been over and over. This thing we call love. And I’ve been thinking about. What my friends would say. If I were to give it up. Cause I’ve been tired and hopeful (I’ve been hurting inside). For far too long now (too long now). So I’ve given it up, given up, given up on love. Given up on love (given up, given up). Given up on love (given up, given up). Given up on love (given up, given up). Given up on love (given up, given up). Given up on love. Given up on love (given up, given up). Given up on love (given up, given up). Given up on love (given up, given up). Given up on love (given up, given up). Given up on love (given up, given up).

"i was unconscious, it was a dream","I'll let you say I love you. When I know I'll never say it back. And you open up the floodgates. And wipe the village clean off the map. Yeah, oh wipe the village clean off the map. We sat with the bay-leaves and royalty. Into the part where everything was free. And you inch yourself closer on that leather bench. I stare at the frames while you see the, the banquet scene. I, stare at the frames while you see the banquet scene. And all of this because I've been screaming. Girl's names in the night. I was unconscious, it was a dream. Just let it die, die, die. And you ask me to get blind blind drunk. So I'll sleep the whole night long. And I'll ask you to stop picking faults. Cause you'll miss me when I'm gone. The rope it broke and I fell into the canyon. I run my hand down the arc of your spine. And your heart it aches for the lives that you will never lead. We come and go but someday I will find the time.... To, lie beside you for one whole night"
i'm alive,"I took my eyes out. And put them in my mouth. I saw things only surgeons see. A unique view of my body. I put my fingers. Inside a hole. Electricity poured in me. If I was a chain then I'd be free. And that's why I find it hard. To believe. I cut my hair off. It didn't even hurt. Is it even a part of me?. It seems to grow so independently. I took my ears off. And threw them in the sea. If I was a whale I'd be happy. There's little fish eating big fish. And the things that are backstabbed they cannot breathe. And that's why I find it hard. To believe. Yeah to believe. I blew my face off. But not quite well enough. I can't do anything right. I don't do death. I don't do life. And that's why I find it hard. I'll be okay, I'll be alright. I'll survive. Cos I'm alive"
if we're still alive,"It's okay, you're leaving. And we never talked about it. Even thought about it ever before. Oh Oh. So now I'm sleeping until the evening. Then I'm leaving into the night looking for the next dance floor. I thought you would let me. I thought maybe you would let me down. You let me down. Now I'm looking for another. While we're still around. I know I will be saved. 'Cause I always have believed. That there's something more for me when I go. Oh Oh. And there's a city. That will heal me. And help me clear the lumps out of my throat. I think that next summer. If we're all still alive, you should try. We should try. To jump into some water. And focus on getting high. Fill your head with regretful space. And leave it in that older place. Photographic memory is patchy grays. Early rays and I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm not waiting for another. Will we're still alive?. If we're still alive. Will we're still alive (If we're still alive). Will we're still alive (If we're still alive). Will we're still alive (If we're still alive). Will we're still alive (If we're still alive). Will we're still alive (If we're still alive). Will we're still alive (If we're still alive). Will we're still alive"
it doesn't always have to be beautiful,"She said the sleepers on tracks have woken up. It's the end of the line I guess our luck is up. It was fun while it lasted cause nothing ever does. Love has lost it's meaning and it was wasted on us. In the electrical storm you were running wild. You had a death wish you were a child. I came to bearing a lightning bolt. If you came back as the deep sea, I would come back as the salt. It's like your head is stuck in a tightening vise. Your ears are deaf to your friends' advice. Because you know that your heart will never be full. It doesn't always have to be beautiful. Unless it's beautiful. Okay leave now leave now if you just can't stay. Because there's nothing worse than somebody pretending away. The years of their youth they will never get back. So I'll go home and practice the traits you said I lacked. Like listening to the thunder of your heart. And how with every other beat we grew further apart. Love is always going to be hard to you both. Never thinking that you'll ever love anyone else as much. But it's ugly, it's ugly now yeah I know. But you never give things enough time to grow. It's like driving through a carnival. It doesn't always have to be beautiful. Unless it's beautiful. Baby I know it's over. Tell me (please) wait 'til you're sober. Now we know it's true. The waiting never quite felt like waiting. When the waiting was with you. Baby I know it's over. Tell me (please) wait 'til you're sober. Now we know it's true. The waiting never quite felt like waiting. When the waiting was with you. So let me tell you tell you a thing or two. About how to survive when there is a me and a you. It's awful, it's gruesome, it's something, it's cruel. Forever you will ask God if this happened to you. 'Cause I'm always thinking, thinking about where you are. Who you're with and if your mind is far. From what we do when we're alone. Love is to much for me and now the wall needs to grow.

it's christmas and you're boring me,"The only thing I got from this year. Was this eternal ringing in my ear. From all the feedback and backchat and grief. And my pockets got deeper than before. I understand you've seen all of me. I'm going to treat that accordingly. Boy, I don't need that. I don't need a thing. Least of all this ring. It's Christmas and you're boring me. Now what can I possibly do?. You've made me happy but you don't excite me. I'll wait till New Years to tell you we're through. This Christmas the bells ring out of tune. Your mother's heart is bursting for me. As we sit by her impressive tree. Her heart is open, but mine it is torn for her first-born. It's Christmas and you're boring me. Now what can I possibly do?. You've made me happy but you don't excite me. I'll wait till New Years to tell you we're through. This Christmas the bells ring out of tune. It's Christmas and you're boring me. And I've loved you as much as I can. I need to feel this now, I know it exists. I'm only a human; you've been the perfect man. To hold me, a man to be kind. Now I can feel my heart beating out of time. Baby, you'll be fine"
me and you,"Me and You!. We're moving gravel off someone else's drive,. Into a barrel, it helps us stay alive.. Off to market. You will buy a cone.. They'll never notice,. They're never home.. Policy and bureaus help to move the tide,. Pounds filling euros, get yourself a life.. He loves you for who you are,. and nothing could see otherone it's tight.. Marry into money, marry twice.. Live underneath the staircase, of speak your mind.. Well I've got a feeling someome else is reading. The letters I wrote to you.. Well, my pets illiterate. And I live alone.. So, it's someone in betwixed of me and you. Me and you,. Me and you.. Last time we spoke I thought we were through.. I found a map,. I found a map,. I found a map,. I found a map.. And now i know the way you can just go. Back, back, back, back.. There's a bat hibernating on my bathroom wall,. No-one went in for weeks, he thought it was a home.. Safe to sleep the nights away,. Shh, shh, shh.. I offered him some food but he said, I cannot stay,. I'm disgraced by my actions and i'm at law from the cay,. Crying in the taxi won't do you no good.. I tried to make a vessel but there was no wood.. Strong enough to bend and never swell. We can jump right in. And buy a pair of gills.. But holding on for that long might a job aswell.. Me and you,. Me and you.. Last time we spoke i thought we were through.. I found a map,. I found a map,. I found a map,. I found a map.. And now i know the way you can just go. Back, back, back, back.. Me and you,. Me and you.. Last time we spoke i thought we were through.. I found a map,. I found a map,. I found a map,. I found a map.. And now i know the way you can just go. Back, back, back, back.. Back, back, back, back.. Help yourself out, shoot history in the mouth,. It's all that's left to do.. Look me up in some phonebook. Under, Me and You."
not mine to love,You say you would leave her. If I'd like. You say you are confused. But you look fine. I see the booths filled. Of your eyes. And now with this water. Out of mine.. And it makes you blurry.. It makes you blurry. I've got a lover. Who does me good. Even lifts me over. Like you never would. But when the night falls. It is you I long for.. But you will never be easily with me. And I'm making it hard for you. To live the life you choose. And I will always try. To have you by my side. But your hand I don't touch. It's not mine to love. I make it nervous. But you don't shake. And I am making plans that aren't. mine to make. And when you are laughing. I do feel free. And I don't panic with you beside me. But you make me hungry. When I don't need to be. But you will never be easily with me. And I'm making it hard for you. To live the life you choose. And I will always try. To have you by my side. I don't touch. It's not mine to love. But you will never be easily with me. And I'm making it hard for you. To live the life you choose. And I will always try. To have you by my side. But your hand I don't touch. It's not mine to love
number one,"I looked up and all I could see was mist. Who needs coasts when you're perfectly adrift. I've got a friend who knows just how it is. We walked a while and watched the sun arrive. Drinking and plannin', hey, you know any time. You wanna sing, I'm here, just like tonight. Golden storm, put that hurricane away. I wasn't flattered when you named it after me. I want to lay down almost constantly, 'cause I know. Just how to look the other way. It was so much easier yesterday. When the door was open and. We're just running far. Come on, let's close it and. I'll call you number one, number one. Number one, number one. You're reading books about how it all should work. Written by men who've never seen the world. Or a garden coming to color in that northwest town. Where the streets are overrun. Punk rock kids do what they've always done. Time can stop; I was the lucky one. Blue blood runs out into the street. T. v. Shows rewarding treachery. I'm watching now and I will be the same time, next week. Just to learn how to look away. I want to understand yesterday. When the door was open and. We're just running far. Come on, let's close it and. I'll call you number one, number one. Number one, number one. Don't let him run the race. Come out of your hiding place. I look into your eyes but don't know how they work. Desire is power, and trust is just a word. Remember when we met, I was young and you were hurt. Maybe we should talk about what's at stake. You don't have to feel like shit and say it's o. k. Or pretend to be asleep while you're dreaming of being awake"
our most brilliant friends,"Sun is coming up slowly. I didn't read it in your star-sign or mine. God knows we're not holy. In decisions we make. And how we spend our time. But I got faster and faster. And you got harder to please. And you got harder to find. And our prayers were answered. When we wrote these songs. And we lost our minds. And all our most brilliant friends. Are doubting themselves. And we're scared about the world. The atmosphere, our bodies, and our health. So just dance with me. Move your body round this time machine. Start it again. I want you to celebrate. The fact our bodies can recreate. New versions of ourselves. We won't need help. Something's making me nervous. Running through my body. Can't remember why. We thought we had all the answers. We got the stomach to learn. But haven't got the time. Your body looks good tonight. I wonder if you'd care. If I was still in your shirt. The way we were when we first met. Before your mind filled with air and mine with dirt. And all our most brilliant friends are doubting themselves. And we're scared about the world. The atmosphere, our bodies, and our health. So just dance with me. Move your body round this time machine. Start it again. I want you to celebrate. The fact our bodies can recreate. New versions of ourselves. We won't need help. Hey hey, look at him go. Hey hey, look at him go. Hey hey, look at him go. Hey hey, look at him go!. You know that it's gonna take time don't ya?. You know that you never were right. But the fact is you're good. Yeah, we know that you're nice. But we don't get a world and we don't get a life. Where all our most brilliant friends are doubting themselves. And we're scared about the world. The atmosphere, our bodies, and our health. So just dance with me. Move your body round this time machine. Start it again, start it all again. I want you to celebrate. The fact our bodies can recreate. New versions of ourselves. We won't need help. Hey hey, look at him go. Hey hey, look at him go. Hey hey, look at him go. Hey hey, look at him go!. . - Parte 2 -. If dreams come true. Then you and I would make a two. And if I had one more. I'd dream that I stayed on your floor. And while my parents were alive. They'd say 'Rebecca now's the time. To play the next card to your chest'. You thought about me and you said go. I thought about that and I said no. You couldn't understand why a girl like me. Thinks the way I do. But I can't stand a boy. Who thinks things through like you. Let's go back to the beginning. Of the nights that I've been regretting. Let's go back to the beginning. Of the nights I've been regretting. Now with you I always thought. We'd live behind a front door. Right now you don't think that. You can live anymore. And I'll call and call and call and call. And call and call and call. Anyone on the phone. So tonight I'm not alone. Let's go back to the beginning. Of the nights that I've been regretting. Let's go back to the beginning. Of the nights that I've been regretting. And you say baby you lied in your song. It takes all my courage not to sing along. And now my beating heart belongs to my drum. I met a boy who grew up in the mountains. He really loved God and got me thinking about things. Like appreciating everyone that I can call a friend. Seeing life as a group of tests to see through to the end. But I'm a quitter, I don't think he knew. That I'm still thinking about you. I'm a quitter and I'm ashamed. He said he'd come back for my brain. And you say baby you lied in your songs. It takes all my courage not to sing along. And now my beating heart belongs to my drum. I just wanted to see that new Tim Burton movie. Or hang around with Laura, Jane, and Suzie. And I definitely want to be a rapper. But I'm just a northern girl from where nothing really happens. And the bones inside my shins are crumbling. The bones inside my shins are crumbling. The bones inside my shins are crumbling. The bones inside my shins are crumbling. The bones inside my shins are crumbling. It's from all the crunking I've been doing"
paraguay and panama,"Ever had your numbers called. Ever ran away, ever loved and lost it all. Don't you wanna say. And if you had, and if you had. The chance to run it all like you know it's meant. Would you roll a dice or sprint until the end. Pickled and soured, bruised and dry. That's the local way. Strange old flag, flying high. Don't know what to say. Just tip your head, just tip your head. And let us know your heart, beats like the rest. And we will roll around, and do our best. Painted girl, upon the wall. Covered carefully in paraguay and panama. You were the hourglass beauty queen. Just flick your hair, just flick your hair. And move your lips around, in the shape of words. That you knew before all of this"
slow club summer shake down,"I'm looking for someone with hands. I'm looking for someone with hands. To hold and to squeeze. But not my little finger please. Cos I lost it to lowly thug. Now I'm looking for someone with bi- noculars. So I, Don't have to get so close. Because thats where the most. Casualties arise. Angels will decide. Angels, oh they will shine. And the eyes of your opponents. May they fall to the floor. You win the battle. You get you're rattle. The trophy of gold. Now I'm waiting for someone to scream. (Ahhh!). I'm waiting for someone to scream. And break all the windows. The buildings fall down. I'm on the road but I'm comfy at least. And now I need someone with space. To dig me out the mess that I've made. And bring me back to life. With a flash of blue light. My life was flat but now it's been raised. Angels will decide. Angels, oh they will shine. And the eyes of your opponents. May they fall to the floor. You win the battle. You get you're rattle. Strap up the saddle. And push the cattle. Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh.... Don't say yes unless you mean it. Ride the crest for all to see it. Hold your hands up and believe it. And shake it til you can't take it no more. Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh. Shake it!. Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh. Shake it!. Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh. Shake it!"
sorry about the doom,"I agree, you were right to say we're doomed. Cause there isn't a chance that I'll get to be in your arms soon. Cause I'm back on the road now. And there is nothing that we can do. I have to find a way to make the days pass soon. We spend our time looking for which one fits best. And in the morning I am waking. And I'm wondering how it's me who ended up like this. Cause I'm the one who said it would be easy. Now I'm the one whose feeling worst. Cause I agreed that I would never be put first. And I know. Your heart is beating slow. And out of time with mine. So now I'll say goodbye"
"suffering you, suffering me","So I saw you turn from me the other night. Right there, I knew that I was losing you. And so I clenched my fist so tight, I couldn't sleep. Right there, I knew that I was losing you. And oh, I wonder. Will time wash away or will I suffer?. Suffering you, suffering me. You came to me in truth. But as I lie, I leave. Say a week at least for you to clear your mind. How I felt so sick the whole time. And I was so sure that I was special and you'd be kind. And now I see what each other's go by. Now well, I wonder. Will time wash away or will I suffer?. Suffering you, suffering me. You came to me in truth. But as I lie, I leave. And all the things you say. That you'd never leave. How could you be so cruel. So beautiful to me. And in a year from now. I wonder if I find. That thoughts of you have passed me by. Oh how we've stayed forever. Neither of us feeling better. Do I find something new?. Or keep suffering you?. Suffering you, suffering me. You came to me in truth. But as I lie, I leave. And all the things you say. That you've never leave. How could you be so cruel. So beautiful to me"
sunday,"Today was my unlucky day I missed the bus and then the train. and my boots filled up with dew. Today was my unlucky day I lost my conkers in a game. then I lost my marbles too. Today was my unlucky day. I broke the swing down by the lake. and I fell in two. A hole that someone had dug deep deep deep through the muck and I was fallin'. But I'll be comin' home for you.

How does this thing gravity work?. Because I think I must be halfway there. Will you stop me before Australia ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah oh. But I'll be comin' home for you. My heart is fonder now you've not been around. I'll be coming home for you. Now that I have learned how a heart can hurt. Well I'll be comin' home for you.

tears of joy,"Back in the summer. You said it was cracked. But you didn't want it. But you wanted it back. And the air is no good here. But you think you'll come back. And you needed a door way. And you needed to see. What happens when you give yourself back to me. And you'll rest on a moon beam. And hope no-one sees. Oh your. Tears, tears, tears of joy. Tears, tears, tears of joy. Well I'm holding you heart. And I'm ready to stay. If you gave me your heart. I'm ready oh oh I'm ready for it. And the concert halls screaming. You took a bow. From the floor to the ceiling. The curtain came down. And I wrote all my dreams in. The dust on the ground. Forget that old future. The future is dead. It'll twist and turn all. The thoughts in your head. Until you feel seasick. While you're laid on your bed. Drying all of those. Tears, tears, tears of joy. Tears, tears, tears of joy. Well I'm holding you heart. And I'm ready to stay. If you gave me your heart. I'm ready oh oh I'm ready for it. It's never gonna be the same. If it was easy would you feel this way. Now there's nothing left for us to do. Except for you to be good to me. And me be good to you.

Run my fingers through the h lines in the word. I can rely on it many times. The truth when you're not yourself. Cause lately you've been stolen. Where's my friend, I miss her. No one told me you'd be disappearing. Now we're all here, yeah we're are all here. Looking for the pieces. The pieces, the pieces. So many years. Too many ties to cut with just one ol' blood knife.

What if to say, what if to say you don't leave. Me all alone. While it burns and it rages. Through the usual stages. My special walked on. And I'll never move on.

there is no good way to say i'm leaving you,"On a glass bottom boat. You escaped to ballot your vote. On a piece of home-made paper you were a yes. And you were a no. In wet cement, you drew a line. Dancing across the coals. You ask me to pick a side. I've gotta ruin tonight. Cos there's no good way to say. I'm leaving you. There is no good way to say. I'm leaving you. You used to write,. You used to paint. You don't say why you stopped. Or if you'll start again. Your evenings lack their old uniforms. It's not hard to think of questions. When answers are all that you want. I've gotta ruin tonight. Cos there's no good way to say. I'm leaving you. There is no good way to say. I'm leaving you"
"thinking, drinking, sinking feeling","Light will pour, out of your eyes. Down into, a field of spies. The grass is green, the sky is blue. All the sun, bullies the moon. [Chorus]. But I will make you see, that you belong to me. Stick me to you, nature needs no glue. Always be true. I would never, call you a pig. You are clever, and he is not. The lean-in time, came way too fast. I want you, to collapse. (Chorus) 1x. Thinking, drinking, sinking feeling.. You said watch, that romantic film. But who plays me? And who plays you?. Are you the one, who gets the girl?. Or are you the one, who ends up dead?. [Chorus 2]. But I will make you see, that you belong to me. Stick me to you, nature needs no glue. I could hold you tighter, and I could make you lighter. Than the air that you've been breathin. I know he'll say don't leave him. While the cannons are firing. And the wall outside's expiring. I've started making plans. So come on give me a chance. Always be true.... Thinking, drinking, sinking feeling..."

It's just begun. What I thought was the start became the end. it turns out you just want to be my friend. You turn to me and say. ""This was a nice holiday"" (Nooooo!). And you can see my new reflection. as it crumbles to the floor. Another drink, oh, another chat. I've got friends in every port. Cause Lord you know I've tried. have I not?. And all these new friends stare and remind me. oh, but they do inspire me. oh, will anybody take me home tonight?"

wanderer wandering,Midnight. When you get there. Just hold her to your chest. Then walk you to the beach. To watch the birds fall from their nest. I'll ask where you're going. And what you're doing. You have no answer. Because you're a wanderer wondering. You're a wanderer wandering. You're a wanderer wandering. And every second is a pounding drum. You're leaning over me to put another record on. And every other guess is just cold hard luck. Now the life is kid creole and the coconuts. Midnight when you get there. Just hold her to your chest. And tell her loves the best. For her. For you. For me. Does the world make you crazy. It made me crazy too. But I'm all out of hunger. Because I'm a wanderer wandering. I'm a wanderer wandering. I'm a wanderer. Wandering. And with a whisper you. Can have me walking on air. Feel my heart go bo-boom. For the first time in years. Now its all making sense and I don't feel so bad. Now all there left to do is for us to sing it out loud. And we will still be singing it. All the way home. Cause you will always hear the thunder. Your'e a wanderer wandering. Your'e a wanderer wandering. Your'e a wanderer. Wandering

If we're both not married by twenty-four. Will you pass me those knee pads and I'll get on the floor?. If we're both not married by twenty-five. I hope that there's some childish spark still alive.

Will you hold my hand when I go?. Will you hold my hand when I go?. If I get to thirty and I don't have a wife. I'll ask you nicely but I won't ask twice. If I get to forty and I don't have a spouse. I'll fashion you a letter and I'll send it to your house. If I get to sixty will you let me slip away. Into an armchair for the rest of my days?. Cos you've got your family and I've got mine. The love that we share is for another time. Cos there are so many lessons. That I just never get to learn. And there are so many questions that still burn, like:. Will you hold my hand when I go?. Will you hold my hand when I go?. Will you hold my hand when I go?. Will you hold my hand when I go?"
