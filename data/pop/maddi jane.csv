That should be me. You said you needed a little time for my mistakes. It's funny how you use that time to have me replaced. Did you think that. I wouldn't see you out at the movies?. What you're doin' to me. You're takin' her where we used to go. Now if you're trying to break my heart. It's working, 'cause you know. That should be me, holdin' your hand. That should be me, makin' you laugh. That should be me, this is so sad. That should be me, that should be me. That should be me, feelin' your kiss. That should be me, buyin' you gifts. This is so wrong, i can't go on. Till you believe, that that should be me. I need to know: should i fight for love or disarm?. It's getting harder to shield this pain in my heart.... That should be me, holdin' your hand. That should be me, makin' you laugh. That should be me, this is so sad. That should be me, that should be me. That should be me, feelin' your kiss. That should be me, buyin' you gifts. This is so wrong, i can't go on. Till you believe, that that should be me. Holding your hand,. Ooh, and makin' you laugh, ooh baby. That should be me, ooh. Giving you flowers. And talkin' by hours, yeah. That should be me!. I never should've let you go. I never should've let you go. I never should've let you go. That should be me..."
too close,You know I'm not one to break promises. I don't wanna hurt you but I need to breathe. At the end of it all you're still my best friend. But there's something inside that I need to release. Which way is right. Which way is wrong. How do I say that I need to move on. You know we're heading separate ways. Chorus:. And it feels like I am just too close to love you. There's nothing I can really say. I can't lie no more. I can't hide no more. Got to be true to myself. And it feels like I am just too close to love you. So I'll be on my way. You're giving me more that I can return. Yet there's so much that you deserve. Nothing to say. Nothing to do. Nothing to give must leave without you. You know we're heading separate ways. Chorus. And it feels like I am just too close to love you. There's nothing I can really say. I can't lie no more. I can't hide no more. Got to be true to myself. And it feels like I am just too close to love you. So I'll be on my way. I'll be on my way (2x). Uhmm Ohh. I'll be on my way (2x). Uhmm. You know I'm not one to break promises. I don't wanna hurt you. Chorus. And it feels like I am just too close to love you. There's nothing I can really say. I can't lie no more. I can't hide no more. Got to be true to myself. And it feels like I am just too close to love you. So I'll be on my way
