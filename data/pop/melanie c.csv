never be the same again (feat. lisa 'left eye' lopes),"Never Be The Same Again. Ooh, yeah. Never be the same again. I call you up whenever things go wrong. You're always there. You are my shoulder to cry on. I can't believe it took me quite so long. To take the forbidden step. Is this something that I might regret?. (Come on, come on). Nothing ventured nothing gained. (You are the one). A lonely heart that can't be tamed. (Come on, come on). I'm hoping that you feel the same. This is something that I can't forget. I thought that we would just be friends. Things will never be the same again. It's just the beginning it's not the end. Things will never be the same again. It's not a secret anymore. Now we've opened up the door. Starting tonight and from now on. We'll never, never be the same again. Never be the same again. Now I know that we were close before. I'm glad I realised I need you so much more. And I don't care what everyone will say. It's about you and me. And we'll never be the same again. I thought that we would just be friends (oh yeah). Things will never be the same again (Never be the same again). It's just the beginning it's not the end (We've only just begun). Things will never be the same again. It's not a secret anymore. Now we've opened up the door (Opened up the door). Starting tonight and from now on. We'll never, never be the same again. Never be the same again. Night and day. Black beach sand to red clay. The Us to Uk. Nyc to La. From sidewalks to highways. See it'll never be the same. What I'm sayin'. My mind frame never changed ëtil you came rearranged. But sometimes it seems completely forbidden. To discover those feelings that we kept so well hidden. Where there's no competition. And you render my condition. Though improbable itís not impossible. For a love that could be unstoppable. But wait. A fine lineís between fate and destiny. Do you believe in the things that were just meant to be?. When you tell me the stories of your quest for me. Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly. And as our energies mix and begin to multiply. Everyday situations, they start to simplify. So things will never be the same between you and I. We intertwined our life forces and now weíre unified. I thought that we would just be friends. Things will never be the same again. It's just the beginning it's not the end. Things will never be the same again. It's not a secret anymore. Now we've opened up the door. Starting tonight and from now on. We'll never, never be the same again (Come on, come on). Things will never be the same again (You are the one). Never be the same again. It's not a secret any more. We'll never be the same again. It's not a secret any more. We'll never be the same again. Never be the same again. Never be the same again. Never be the same again. Never be the same again"
version of me,"This is not your playground. I'm not here for you to shoot me down. Preying on my weakness. Even when you're not around. Nothing lasts forever. But you're wrapped around my dna. And I'm hiding in the corner. As the wounded kid I was. Like it was yesterday. Like nothing's changed. All that you've done you see. Ever so quietly. Comes creeping back up on me. Haunting me, goading me. Why can't you let go of me?. I don't have the patience anymore. That's not me. I won't be the version of me. The one you think you're comfortable with. The one you think you had your fun with. If I can't trust myself. Why should I trust anyone else?. All that you've done you see. Ever so quietly. Keeps creeping back up on me. Haunting me, goading me. Why can't you let go of me?. I don't have the patience anymore. Tthat's not me. I won't be the version of me. The one you think you're comfortable with.

better alone,I understand your point of view letting me go. But I thought you had more faith. Everything I´ve done for you. You made the mistakes and now you throw this in my face. And I have worked so hard for you all of this time and you cast me aside. I understand your point of view. . Chorus:. But I can´t seem to get my head around. All the things that I feel good about always seem to disappear. And every time I think I´ve got this all worked out. Something chews me up and spits me out. But there´s nothing left to fear. I´m better alone my dear. . You couldn't pick a better time to give me the news. Why don´t you kick me when I´m down?. I´d always believed in you. Defended your name but you have not been true. I gave you so much of my life I´ve compromised and you tell me goodbye. You couldn´t pick a better time. . Chorus:. And I can´t seem to get my head around. All the things that I feel good about always seem to disappear. And every time I think I´ve got this all worked out. Something chews me up and spits me out. But there´s nothing left to fear. I´m better alone my dear. . I know I really should thank you for setting me free. It´s really amazing the changes I´m starting to feel. It's not gonna be long till I´m fit and strong. Deliverance helped me heal still I wonder if you ever wish you still had me. . Will I ever get my head around. All the things that I feel good about that always seem to disappear. When every time I think I´ve got this all worked out. Something chews me up and spits me out. But there´s nothing left to fear. No No No. . I can´t seem to get my head around. All the things that I feel good about that always seem to disappear. No No. . And every time I think I´ve got this figured out. Something screws me up and drags me down. But there´s nothing left to fear. I´m better alone my dear

northern star,They tried to catch a falling star. Thinking that she had gone too far. She did but kept it hidden well. Until she cracked and then she fell. If all the history is true. She's gonna end up just like you. You made it to the other side. But tell me who will be my guide. They build you up so they can tear you down. Trust the ocean you'll never drown. Who is next?. Who's gonna steal your crown?. You'll see. I have learnt my lesson well. The truth is out there I can tell. Don't look back and don't give in to their lies and goodbyes. Northern star. Fulfil the longing in your heart. Then we will never be apart. And if they dare to question you. Just tell them that our love is true. They buy your dreams so they can sell your soul. Is it any wonder we've lost control?. Feelings come. Feelings go.. I have learnt my lesson well.. The truth is out there I can tell. Don't look back and don't succumb to their lies and goodbyes.

first day of my life,So I found a reason to stay alive. Try a little harder see the other side. Talking to myself. Too many sleepless nights. Trying to find a meaning to this stupid life.

both sides now,"Rows and flows of angel hair. And ice cream castles in the air. And feather canyons everywhere. I've looked at clouds that way. But now they only block the sun.

It's cloud illusions I recall. I really don't know clouds at all. Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels. The dizzy dancing way that you feel. As every fairy tale comes real. I've looked at love that way. But now it's just another show. You leave 'm laughing when you go. And if you care, don't let them know. Don't give yourself away. I've looked at love from both sides now. From give and take and still somehow. It's love's illusions that I recall. I really don't know love at all. Tears and fears and feeling proud. To say ""I love you"" right out loud.

aren't you kinda glad we did,"Oh it really wasn't my intention. To disregard convention. It was just an impulse that had to be obeyed. Though it seems convention we've been scorning.

Naturally, I thought I couldn't. And probably I shouldn't. But aren't you kinda glad we did?. Actually, it all was blameless. Never the less, they'll call it shameless.

It all started in another dimension. You may have took my breath. You didn't take my dedication. They say that love is blind. They say that love is blind. They say that love is blind. I've never been the leaving kind. I've gotta go!. Find another direction. I've gotta go-whoa. I wanna get your attention, for once. I've gotta go (can't love you). Find another direction.

goin' down,"How come I didn't see. You were makin' fun of me. How dare you change the rules. You made me look a fool. Well now you're gonna see. The last laugh's not on on me. What am I gonna do. To get my revenge on you. You're goin' down, goin' down. Was it just another line. Or did I misread the sign?. What else could I do. I was so into you. With all this bad luck I've had. My karma must be bad. You've played your little games. Oh what a shame. You're goin' down, goin' down.. Goin' down. I'm singing it loud and I don't care. I'm singing it proud everywhere. Now I feel no remorse. My life is back on course. From this little hitch. I have become a super-bitch. But don't be afraid. By that confession I've made. I am not a whore. I have gone hardcore. You're goin' down, goin' down. Goin' down, goin' down. I'm singing it loud and I don't care. I'm singing it proud everywhere. I'm singing it loud and I don't care. I'm singing it proud everywhere.

I feel so bad. Never felt like this 'bout anything, I never have, no. Please, don't tell me that. What's lost is lost, it's never gonna come back home. I lie in silence and I just can't sleep.

Never felt like this 'bout anything, I never have, no. Please, don't tell me that. What's meant to be is meant to be, it's no consolation. I'll carry on. Proving everyone wrong. I will succeed.

here and now,"I walked the line, so carefully. I took my time I wondered. The here and now, what matters now. No looking back, that's over. I don't know what tomorrow brings. The sun may shine, the world come tumbling down. I don't care what went on before. But I'm sure of the here and now. I stood alone, the only one. I didn't know, I was waiting. For liberty, to feel like me. And now I'm here, I'm not willing to change. I don't know what tomorrow brings. The sun may shine, the world come tumbling down. I don't care what what went on before. But I'm sure of the here and now. The here and now. The here and now. If you choose, we won't move. I'm here with you. The air is cold. No more to do. I don't know what tomorrow brings.

hold on (feat. alexis francis),Don't give up. Don't lose faith. Can't take for granted. It will be ok. Years have faded. And time moves on. I don't want to stand aside. And watch us come undone. Can we hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on to this love. Can we hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on to this love. Questions answered. Darkness is clear. Eyes wide open. Flashing all our fears. From the silence. Hope is born. Can we stay together. And welcome a new dawn. I don't wanna walk. I don't wanna walk away. I don't wanna walk. I want you to stay. Can we hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on to this love. Can we hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on to this love. Ooh ooh oh. Ooh ooh oh. I never wanted to let you down. So the conversation. In circles round. We could leave it all. And walk away. Wounds may heal. But scars may show. So I'm asking you to. Hold to this love. Can we hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on to this love. Can we hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on to this love. Ooh ooh oh. Ooh ooh oh. Can we hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on to this love
home,"Once upon a time. Before all this mess began. I never felt alone. All now stolen. Simple and surreal. Was it a world of make-believe. You could take by the hand. And I'd follow. Hear my voice. Did you see me coming. I made the choice. Now I'm running. Turn me round. Let me go. Take me home. Never thought I'd see the day. When my life was not my own. I will throw it all away. Without sorrow. But it wouldn't change a thing. Wouldn't change the way I feel. For today is the price I pay. For tomorrow. Hear my voice. Did you see me coming. I made a choice. Now I'm running. Turn me round. Let me go. Take me home. Somehow suddenly. It slipped away from me. I reach out, hopelessly. You're gone. Hear my voice. Did you see me coming. I made a choice. Now I'm running. Turn me round. Let me go. Take me home. Hear my voice. Did you see me coming. I made a choice, but. Now I'm running. So turn me round. Let me go. Take me home."
i don't know how to love him,"Close your eyes, close your eyes. And forget all about us tonight. I don't know how to love him. What to do, how to move him. I've been changed, yes really changed. In these past few days, when I've seen myself. I seem like someone else. I don't know how to take this. I don't see why he moves me. He's a man, he's just a man. And I've had so many men before. In very many ways. He's just one more. Should I bring him down?. Should I scream and shout?. Should I speak of love or let my feelings out?. I never thought I'd come to this. What's it all about?. Don't you think it's rather funny. I should be in this position. I'm the one who's always been. So calm, so cool, no lover's fool. Running every show. He scares me so. I never thought I'd come to this. What's it all about?. Yet, if he said he loved me. I'd be lost. I'd be frightened. I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope. I'd turn my head, I'd back away. I wouldn't want to know. He scares me so. I want him so. I love him so"
i just don't know what to do with myself,"I just don't know what to do with myself. Don't know just what to do with myself. I'm so used to doing everything with you. Planning everything for two. And now that we're through. I just don't know what to do with my time. I'm so lonesome for you it's a crime. Going to a movie only makes me sad. Parties make me feel as bad. When I'm not with you. I don't know what else to do. Like a summer rose. It needs the sun and rain. I need your sweet love to beat all the pain. I just don't know what to do with myself. Don't know just what to do with myself. Baby, if your new love ever turns you down. Come back, I will be around. Just waiting for you. I don't know what else to do. Like a summer rose. It needs the sun and rain. I need your sweet love to beat all the pain. I don't know just what to do with myself. I don't know just what to do with myself. So baby, if your new love ever turns you down. Come on back, I will be around. Just waiting for you. I don't know what else to do, no, no, no. I don't know what else to do.

i know him so well (feat. emma bunton),"Nothing is so good it lasts eternally. Perfect situations must go wrong. But this has never yet prevented me. From wanting far too much, for far too long. Looking back, I could've played it differently. Won a few more moments. Who can tell?. But it took time to understand the man. Now at least I know, I know him well. Wasn't it good (oh so good). Wasn't he fine (oh so fine). Isn't it madness, he can't be mine. But in the end. He needs a little bit more than me. My security. (He needs his fantasy and freedom). I know him so well. No one in your life is with you constantly. No one is completely on your side. And though I moved my world to be with him. Still the gap between us is too wide. Looking back, I could've played it differently. (could've played it some other way). Learned about the man before I fell. (I was just a little crazy). But I was ever so much younger then. (I was so much younger then). Now at least I know, I know him well. Wasn't it good (oh so good). Wasn't he fine (oh so fine). Isn't it madness, he won't be mine. Didn't I know, how it would go. If I knew from the start. Why am I falling apart. Wasn't it good. Wasn't he fine. Isn't it madness, he won't be mine. But in the end. He needs a little bit more than me. My security. (He needs his fantasy and freedom). I know him so well. It took some time to understand him. I know him so well"
i turn to you,"When the world is darker than I can understand. When nothing turns out the way I planned. When the sky turns gray and there's no end in sight. When I can't sleep through the lonely night. I turn to you. Like a flower leaning toward the sun. I turn to you. Cos you're the only one. Who can turn me around. When I'm upside down. I turn to you. When my insides are wracked with anxiety. You have the touch that will quiet me. You lift my spirit, you melt the ice. When I need inspiration, when I need advice. I turn to you. Like a flower leaning toward the sun. I turn to you. Cos you're the only one. Who can turn me around. When I'm upside down. I turn to you. Where would I be?. What would I do?. If you'd never helped me through. I hope some day. If you've lost your way. You could turn to me. Like I turn to you. I turn to you. Like a flower leaning toward the sun. I turn to you. Cos you're the only one. Who can turn me around. When I'm upside down. I turn to you. I turn to you. When fear tells me to turn around. I turn to you. Cos you're the only one. Who can turn me around. When I'm upside down. I turn to you. I turn to you. I turn to you"

You may be with her, but with me you belong. I am the only one. I am the only one. I want you back. Whatever you do. I want you back. I've got nothin' to prove. I don't care what you said. Want you back in my bed. I want you back. I want you back. Can't let go, guess you know. Now I've blown my cover. What I want, what I need. Is no other lover. Try to deny it but you know it's true.

i wish,"Lookin back on when I. Was a little nappy-headed boy. Then my only worry. Was for Christmas what would be my toy. Even though we sometimes would not get a thing. We were happy with the joy the day would bring. Sneaking out the back door. To hangout with those hoodlum friends of mine, ooh yeah. Greeted at the back door. Boy, thought I told you not to go outside.. Trying the best to bring the water to your eyes. Thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind.. I wish these days could come back once more. Why did those days ever have to go. I wish those days could come back once more. Why did those days ever have to go. Cause I loved them so. Brother says he's tellin. About you playin doctor with that girl. Just don't tell, I'll give you. Anything you want in this whole wide world. Mama gives you money for Sunday school. You trade yours for candy after church is through. Smoking cigarettes and. Writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy). Teacher sends you to the. Principal's office down the hall. You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right. But while you were doin it, it sure felt outta sight. I wish these days could come back once more. Why did those days ever have to go. I wish those days could come back once more. Why did those days ever have to go"

How is that gonna help when you've got no where to live?. Some turn away so they don't see. I bet you'd look if that were me. How. Did you fall?. Did you fall at all?. Is it lonely where you are?.

I couldn't live without my phone. But you don't even have a home. How. Did we fall?. Can we get up at all?. Are we happy where we are?. On our lonely little star.

immune,If you see me and I look away. Please don’t ask me. There’s nothing to say about the way that I feel. It’s hard to conceal when it’s in my eyes. If I tell you that I’m doin’ fine. Please believe me. It may be a lie but I’ve got to move on. I’ve got to be strong. Now what else can I do?. Cause I’ve been. Wanting waiting hoping praying. Oh I feel like I’m suffocating. There’s nothing left to lose. If all that I have is the sweetest denial. If all I can give is the rest of my life. Then I’m over pretending. That I can survive without you. Thought I was stronger than love. But I guess that nobody’s immune. There’s a poison. That runs through my veins when I’m sleeping. And just like a secret. That I try to keep. I buried too deep. Like the memories of you. But I’m still here. Wanting waiting hoping praying. Oh I feel like I’m suffocating. There’s nothing left to lose. If all that I have is the sweetest denial...

one by one,Woke up with the morning sun. Another day has just begun. But all I think about is you. Woke up in this paradise. Golden sands and bluer skies. But all I think about is you. Remember we were back in our old pad. All the simple pleasures that we had. When all we needed was each other. I can see a light in your eye. Telling me that love hasn't died. We can ride the changes that come. You're still the one. Wo-oah. Wo-o-o-oah. We can ride the changes that come. We can pick the pieces up one by one. You tell me I don't give you time. You're questioning what's on my mind. But all I think about is you. Thinking back to summer days. You could steal my heart away. With just a glance in my direction. And I can see a light in your eye. Telling me that love hasn't died. We can ride the changes that come. You're still the one. Wo-oah. Wo-o-o-oah. We can ride the changes that come. We can pick the pieces up one by one. And I am coming home tonight. To bring our love back to life. Stop this ride. I'm getting off. To start again with you my love. Oh I am coming home tonight. To bring our love back to life. Stop this ride. I'm getting off. To start again with you my love. Wo-oah. Wo-o-o-oah. We can ride the changes that come. We can pick the pieces up one by one

out of this world,I never dreamed I’d want you. You weren’t even even a friend. But I guess I’ve fallen. So this story can’t just end. Your love lifted me. Out of this world. With the love out of this world. I love you when I’m with you. Still I hate you when you’re gone. But I love you like no other. I love you with this song. Your love lifted me. Out of this world. So transported as the leaves to our lives unfurl. With the love out of this world
out of time,What if this is nearly over?. Everything coming to an end. As I see fading colours. Finding it harder to pretend. No one can take away the days that we conquered. They hang like shadows in my mind. Everything I thought. Everything I felt. Thank God that's over. Reading the signs. We're out of time. There is always a new story. Another player in the game. Can I rise to a new glory?. Or will these demons keep me chained?. Sometimes fear consumes my every emotion. So I'm drifting with the tide. Everything I am. Everything I did. With total devotion. Reading the signs. We're out of time. The sun will still rise. Maybe shine a little bit brighter. No matter what they say. We can reach a little bit higher. Shake away the chains. We can do this together. I know with you by my side. We'll be alright. The sun is gonna rise.... Alright alright. We'll be alright. Alright alright. We'll be alright. Alright.. . by /Snipes_
paris burning,"I walked the boulevard, alone inside my heart.. Across the avenue, no winter grey and blue.. Hear the river sigh, but I just walk on by, so lost in you.. And I remember now your eyes were like the clouds.. You’re smiling in my dreams, lies in every scene.. My life in flames, every word in vain, you slipped away, you stole the way.. I saw Paris burning, saw the world stop turning.. When you put your coat on to go, did you know you were killing my soul?. Every heart was hurting, when I saw Paris burning.. When you put your coat on to leave, you took away the biggest part of me.. I remember now, every fear and doubt,. You’d look me in the eye and swore you would never say goodbye. Dès que je te vois, je sens mon désespoir.. You lied to me to. Tu m’as menti.. I saw Paris burning, I saw the world stop turning.. When you put your coat on to go, did you know you were killing my soul?. Every heart was hurting, when I saw Paris burning.. When you put your coat on to leave, you took away the biggest part of me."
playing for time,"These are the days of the open hand. They might just be the last. Look around now. These are the days of the beggars and the choosers. This is the year of the hungry man. Whose place is in the past. Hand in hand with ignorance. And legitimate excuses. The rich declare themselves poor. And most of us are not sure. If we have too much. But we?l take our chances. ?ause God? stopped keeping score. I guess somewhere along the way. He must have let us all out to play. Turned his back and all God? children. Crept out the back door. And it? hard to love, there? so much to hate. Hanging on to hope. When there is no hope to speak of. And the wounded skies above say it? much too much too late. Well maybe we should all be praying for time. These are the days of the empty hand. Oh, you hold on to what you can. And charity is a coat you wear twice a year. This is the year of the guilty man. Your television takes a stand. And you find that what was over there is over here. So you scream from behind your door. Say what? mine is mine and not yours. I may have too much but I?l take my chances. ?ause God? stopped keeping score. And you cling to the things they sold you. Did you cover your eyes when they told you. That he can? come back. ?ause he has no children to come back for. It? hard to love there? so much to hate. Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of. And the wounded skies above say it? much too late. So maybe we should all be praying for time"

why,"Why does the rain. Fall from the sky?. How can a sugar pill. Take this pain away?. I should have known. That you would break my heart. You've ended something. That didn't have chance to start.

Why? Cos there's nothing else that I can do. Why do I always look a fool?. Why?. Wish I'd read the signs. And left you well alone. God, I wanna call you. But I can't pick up the phone.

wonderland,". I can't remember yesterday. It isn't fair. There is no other way. Still I walk on. And I walk on. With a blade against my back for me. To fall on. Time is not a friend to me. Draging waves me down. Pulling me in danger. Used to be the wonderland. Stable as a castle made of sand. And I reclaim. Mistakes that I made. And it scratches on my back. That without your name. Time is not a friend to me. Draging waves me down. Pulling me in danger. Time will never heal the pain. Blameless you are not the same. Shameless you are not a friend of mine. Time is not a friend to me. Draging waves me down. Pulling me in danger. Time is not a friend to me. Draging waves me down. Pulling me in danger. (Ba-dap, ba-dap, ba-dap, ba-dap, ba-dap, ba-dap). Time is not a friend to me. Seems so hard to understand. I can't escape. escape the memories. Hope me spin back through the years. To find a place. That I want you as wonderland. Wonderland. Wonderland. Wonderland."

you will see,"You Will See. I'm caught up in a mystery way. I'm in a constant distant state. I pray for this to always be. The path that has been chosen for me. Cos it's got me spinning round and round, round and round. So high I can't touch the ground anymore. And it's all that I'm praying. So let it rain, let it pour, call me names it won't phase me. I don't care what they say. No denouncement could change me. Cos it's only a matter of time 'til it finds you. Try to run for your life, you'll still feel it behind you. You will see. You will, you will see. You will, you will see. Everybody starts with a clean slate. Only altered by unnecessary hate. I pray that I will never be. Affected by how you portray me. Cos it's got me spinning round and round, round and round. But I'm not scared of being down any more. Now there's no one controlling me. So let it rain, let it pour, call me names it won't phase me. I don't care what they say. No denouncement could change me. Cos it's only a matter of time 'til it finds you. Try to run for your life, you'll still feel it behind you. You will see. You will, you will see. You will see. You will, you will see. (let ir rain) I'm not a slave to your attention. (let it pour) Fuck your lies I'll never be a victim. (let it rain) I Fell from the sky, a perfect landing. (let it pour) Sheltered from the storm and all the rain. You will see. So let it rain, let it pour, call me names it won't phase me.

you'll get yours,"Should have trusted in my own feelings. But I silenced intuition when you sacrificed your honesty. I believed that you would be there to protect me. And help me with all I'm going through. There's a joy to being free. That you could have taken from me. But I found the strength to walk away. If you turn the pages and you look inside. There is nothing of me I feel that I have to hide. If you turn the tables and look at yourself. Is there something you feel that you would have to confess. Many things will come to pass, I can live with that. I can't help but wondering, you'll get yours. I'm so happy I have moved on. I heard you are regretful, but you sacrificed your dignity. With the power you have abused you disgust me. And trust me, I'm not the only one. Haven't I already proved. That I'm better off without you. I'm so glad I walked away. If you turn the pages and you look inside. There is nothing of me I feel that I have to hide. If you turn the tables and look at yourself. Is there something you feel that you would have to confess. Many things will come to pass, I can live with that. I can't help but wondering, you'll get yours. For all the lies and your manipulations. For all the times I never felt good enough. You pushed me round, and put me down. To satisfy your childish ego. For all the times you made me feel worthless. The power struggles, now I couldn't care less. It sounds to you, there's nothing you can do. What goes around, comes around. If you turn the pages and you look inside. There is nothing of me I feel that I have to hide. If you turn the tables and look at yourself. Is there something you feel that you would have to confess. Many things will come to pass, I can live with that. I can't help but wondering, you'll get yours"
your mistake,I should concentrate on slowing down. Cause all I wanna do is drive fast. I don’t think I know my way around. I’m seeing what I’ve already passed. I’ve been racing through my life without. Really knowing where I fit in. It’s only dreams and my reflection now. Where I still see him. I might break. I’m all that’s left from your mistake. I’m still trying to prove myself to you. I can’t escape from this as fast as you. All these years don’t fade away my feelings. I only see us leaving. I convince myself I understand. So there isn’t anybody to blame. If you’d tried and played a different hand. I wonder if I’d still be the same. All this time I’ve watched you moving on. Running from the way that we were. Even though I know the girl is gone. You still see her. I might break.... I’m not frozen I just feel the cold. When all these memories open up again. I might break. I’m all that’s left from your mistake. I’m still trying to prove myself to you. I can’t escape from this as fast as you. You see him gone. I only see us leaving. See us leaving. I only see us leaving. See us leaving. See us leaving oh oh...
