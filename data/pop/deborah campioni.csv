what do i know? (ed sheeran cover),"Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon. But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song. My daddy told me, ""Son, don't you get involved in. Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels"". I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene. I know when I have children they will know what it means. And I pass on these things my family's given to me. Just love, and understanding positivity. We could change this whole world with a piano. Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go. I'm just a boy with a one-man show. No university, no degree, but lord knows. Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth. And the stock market crashing and their portfolios. While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote. Sing, love could change the world in a moment. But what do I know?. Love can change the world in a moment. But what do I know?. Love can change the world in a moment. The revolution's coming, it's a minute away. I saw people marching in the streets today. You know we are made up of love and hate. But both of them are balanced on a razor blade. I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene. I know, I'm all for people following their dreams. Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans. It's love and understanding positivity. We could change this whole world with a piano. Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go. I'm just a boy with a one-man show. No university, no degree, but lord knows. Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth. And the stock market crashing and their portfolios. While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote. Sing, love could change the world in a moment. But what do I know?. Love can change the world in a moment. But what do I know?. Love can change the world in a moment. I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene. You know, the future's in the hands of you and me. So let's all get together, we can all be free. Spread love and understanding, positivity. We could change this whole world with a piano. Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go. I'm just a boy with a one-man show. No university, no degree, but lord knows. Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth. And the stock market crashing and their portfolios. While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote. Sing, love could change the world in a moment. But what do I know?. Love can change the world in a moment. But what do I know?. Love can change the world in a moment. But what do I know?"
