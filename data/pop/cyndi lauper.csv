time after time,"Lying in my bed. I hear the clock tick and think of you. Caught up in circles. Confusion is nothing new. Flashback warm night, almost left behind. Suitcase of memories. Time after. Sometime you pictured me. I'm walking too far ahead. You're calling to me. I can't hear what you've said. Then you said: Go slow, I fall behind. The second hand unwinds. If you're lost you can look. And you will find me, time after time. If you fall I will catch you. I'll be waiting, time after time. If you're lost you can look. And you will find me, time after time. If you fall, I will catch you. I'll be waiting, time after time. After my picture fades. And darkness has turned to grey. Watching through windows. You're wondering if I'm ok. Secrets stolen from deep inside. The drum beats out of time. If you're lost you can look. And you will find me, time after time. If you fall I will catch you. I'll be waiting, time after time. If you're lost you can look. And you will find me, time after time. If you fall I will catch you. I'll be waiting, time after time. You said: Go slow, I fall behind. The second hand unwinds.

i drove all night,"I had to escape. The city was sticky and cruel. Maybe I should have called you first. But I was dying to get to you. I was dreaming while I drove. The long straight road ahead, uh, huh. Could taste your sweet kisses. Your arms open wide. This fever for you is just burning me up inside. I drove all night to get to you. Is that alright. I drove all night. Crept in your room. Woke you from your sleep. To make love to you. Is that alright. I drove all night. What in this world. Keep us from tearing apart. No matter where I go I hear. The beating of your heart. I think about you. When the night is cold and dark. No one can move me. The way that you do. Nothing erases this feeling between me and you. I drove all night to get to you. Is that alright. I drove all night. Crept in your room. Woke you from your sleep. To make love to you. Is that alright. I drove all night. Could taste your sweet kisses. Your arms open wide. This fever for you is just burning me up inside. I drove all night to get to you. Is that alright. I drove all night. Crept in your room.

change of heart,Here I am. Just like I said I would be. I'm your friend. Just like you think it should be. Did you think I would stand here and lie. As our moment was passing us by. Oh I am here. Waiting for your change of heart. It just takes a beat. To turn it around. Yes I'm waiting for your change of heart. At the edge of my seat. Please turn it around. Days go by. Leaving me with a hunger. I could fly. Back to when we were younger. When adventures like cars we would ride. And the years lied ahead still untried. While I stand here. Waiting for your change of heart.... Blind leading blind. Never hear the laughter. Search through time. Nothing reveals the answer. If it's truth that you're looking to find. It is nowhere outside of your mind. I bide my time. Waiting for your change of heart...
funnel of love,"Here I go. Going down, down, down. My mind is a blank. My head is spinning around and around. As I go deep into the funnel of love. It's such a crazy, crazy feeling.

Ya just can't run from the funnel of love. It's gonna get ya someday. It's such a crazy, crazy feeling. I get weak in the knees. My poor old head is a reelin'. As I go deep into the funnel of love.

a night to remember,I look out my window. Into the pouring rain. I wish I could tell you. That I stopped hearing your name. And then I realize every thought of you. Runs a circle around my heart. I hear your voice haunting me. I feel your touch in the dark. It was a night to remember. All your kisses I still taste. It was a night to remember. Can't forget the look on your face. It was a night. Starlight send a message. Like a beacon into the night. To tell you I'm lonely. When I shut out the light. Because a part of me left with you. So I feel lost inside. Sometimes I look into my mirror. I see you shining through my eyes. It was a night to remember. All your kisses I still taste. It was a night to remember. Can't forget the look on your face. It was a night to remember. All these feelings I can't erase. From my heart. Endless dreams. Around my shoulders. I cannot free this restless heart. It was a night to remember. ...Not enough time for you to stay.... ...Can't forget the look on your face.

Don't cry no more, baby. I'm begging you. Every tear you shed. Tells me that your love is true. You cried me a river. You cried me a sea. Now I believe without a doubt. That you really, really. Really love me. You cried me a river. You cried me a sea. Now I believe without a doubt. That you really, really. Really love me. Don't cry no more. Wipe away your tears. Don't cry no more, baby.

mary's boy child,"Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible say,. Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.. Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,. And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.. While shepherds watch their flocks by night,. they see a bright new shining star,. they hear a choir sing a song,. The music seemed to come from afar.. Now Joseph and his wife, Mary,. Came to Bethlehem that night,. They found no place to bear her child,. Not a single room was in sight.. Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,. And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.. Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.. And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn,. and in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.. Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,. And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.. Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day"

I know the only one for me can only be you. My arms won't free you, my heart won't try"

Out on the street. 'cause what they have. I couldn't keep. And I wonder who let in the rain. You know without you. I'm not the same. When love gets strong. People get weak. Sometimes they lose control. And wind up into deep. They fall like rain. Who let in the rain ..........

a night to remember,I look out my window. Into the pouring rain. I wish I could tell you. That I stopped hearing your name. And then I realize every thought of you. Runs a circle around my heart. I hear your voice haunting me. I feel your touch in the dark. It was a night to remember. All your kisses I still taste. It was a night to remember. Can't forget the look on your face. It was a night. Starlight send a message. Like a beacon into the night. To tell you I'm lonely. When I shut out the light. Because a part of me left with you. So I feel lost inside. Sometimes I look into my mirror. I see you shining through my eyes. It was a night to remember. All your kisses I still taste. It was a night to remember. Can't forget the look on your face. It was a night to remember. All these feelings I can't erase. From my heart. Endless dreams. Around my shoulders. I cannot free this restless heart. It was a night to remember. ...Not enough time for you to stay.... ...Can't forget the look on your face.
a part hate,"Somber sister. This is a strange and bitter fruit. Because you taught me to sing. And the rhythm in my heart. And the rhythm in my feet is -. Why are the rainbows. Stolen from the sky. And locked up in boxes. Yellow, black, red and white. Like birds in their cages. Beating their wings on the bars. And there's a song that they're singing. It's a word in the world. It's a word in their hearts. A part hate. I heard a man say. Tear apart hate. And I saw hope in his face. A part hate. Where the color of love. Slips away. Why are the children. Carrying guns, not books. Drug dealing, not learning. The golden rule. And the idea of freedom. Not just the same. Castle in the sky. Haunted by white-sheeted ghouls. Filled with hate me. And hate you. And proud of it too. A part hate. Heard a woman saying. Tear apart hate. And I saw hope in her face. A part hate. Where the color of love. Slips away. Why are the people. Running down the block. Rock throwing, not knowing. What else to do. But I'm just a spectator. And I can never know the pain. But when I hear. That whip cracking. I cry out tears of anger. I cry out tears of shame. A part hate. I heard myself say. Tear apart hate. And I saw hope in my face. A part hate. Where the color of love. Slips away.... Tear apart hate tear apart hate. Tear apart hate tear apart hate. Tear apart hate tear apart hate...."
above the clouds,"(feat. Jeff Beck). There's a place where the sun breaks through. And the wind bites cold and hard. Stings my ears and. Tears my eyes. When the day starts to shout out loud. Stand tall. And glide. When you're all alone in the crowd. Don't fall. Don't hide. When you walk above the clouds. When you walk above the clouds. When the light is against your face. And your smile is soft and sound. That's when you tell me all your fears. and all your dreams. So proud. Stand tall. And glide. When you're all alone in the crowd. Don't fall. Don't hide. When you walk above the clouds. When you walk above the clouds. I try and tell you. to keep your head upright. Don't swing your sword and shield against the night. Don't block your blessings, boy. You don't have to fight. You don't have to fight. Stand tall. And glide. When you're all alone in the crowd. Don't fall. Don't hide. When you walk above the clouds. When you walk above the clouds"

What binding they lack. Oh. Under those white street lamps. There is a little chance they may see. We have no past, we won't reach back. Keep with me forward all through the night. And once we start the meter clicks. And it goes running all through the night. Until it ends, there is no end. Oh. The sleep in your eyes is enough. Let me be there, let me stay there a while.

Sipping his coffee another day has begun .... Little Joe got work for minimum wage.. Tries to get through another dead beat day.. At five o'clock he comes home to change,. Takes him many hours just to rearrange.... And he works his body just to be somebody.. There's a woman in the mirror looking like a dream.. And he works his body.... And he feels somebody.... And the working boy becomes a dancing queen.. Every night the DJ kicks off the beat.. Little Cleo's jumping just to get up on her feet.. Waits in her platforms for the right song to come.. Sipping her cocktail another night has begun.. And he works his body just to be somebody.. There's a woman in the mirror looking like a dream.. And he works his body.... And he feels somebody.... And the working boy becomes a dancing queen.. Every morning the clock kicks off the beat.. Little Joe struggles just to get up on his feet.. Waits in his platforms for the right train to come..."

box of rain,"Look out of any window. Any morning, any evening, any day. Maybe the sun is shining. Birds are winging or. Rain is falling from a heavy sky -. What do you want me to do,. To do for you to see you through?. This is all a dream we dreamed. One afternoon long ago. Walk out of any doorway. Feel your way, feel your way. Like the day before. Maybe you'll find direction. Around some corner. Where it's been waiting to meet you -. What do you want me to do,. To watch for you while you're sleeping?. Well please don't be surprised. When you find me dreaming too. Look into any eyes. You find by you, you can see. Clear through to another day. I know it's been seen before. Through other eyes on other days. While going home --. What do you want me to do,. To do for you to see you through?. It's all a dream we dreamed. One afternoon long ago. Walk into splintered sunlight. Inch your way through dead dreams. To another land. Maybe you're tired and broken. Your tongue is twisted. With words half spoken. And thoughts unclear. What do you want me to do. To do for you to see you through. A a box of rain will ease the pain. And love will see you through. Just a box of rain -. Wind and water -. Believe it if you need it,. If you don't just pass it on. Sun and shower -. Wind and rain -. In and out the window. Like a moth before a flame. It's just a box of rain. I don't know who put it there. Believe it if you need it. Or leave it if you dare. But it's just a box of rain. Or a ribbon for your hair. Such a long long time to be gone. And a short time to be there."
boy blue,"You never knew yourself well enough. But she never knew you at all. And when she put you out on your own. It may have stolen your innocence. But not your soul. Tell me where is little boy blue. You'll find him standing always. One step ahead. Fast a little, shy a little, boy blue. Wise blood runs warms and deep. On the street. ... Kids walking, just a kid walking. You send a letter with photographs. And I'll tuck them under my dreams. And if we wake up old beyond our years. Not quite as brave as we seem. It's just the pain that never disappears. Tell me where is boy blue. You'll find him standing always one step ahead.... Dance a little, cry a little.... Where are you boy blue. Where are you...."

brimstone and fire,"I met a woman at the laundry mat. She left her sock in my dryer. I met a woman in a yellow cap. It said brimstone and fire. I said is this luck ? With just a glance. She smiled, and I thought, is this a sign ?. From above or below ? ... Oh no ... Brimstone .... Brimstone and fire .... The next week at the cinema. She pur her hand on my shoulder. She almost kissed me walking home. And I didn't even scold her. Then I said where is this leading with just a heavy sigh. I quickened my pace and she was following. as if her heart would never tire. Brimstone and fire, brimstone and fire .... Now we have dinner every Saturday. I make spaghetti, she brings cake. I make spaghetti with tomato sauce,. Because that's all I can make. And when she lights the candles. I think, here we go .... But it's so pleasant after all. And I say very low. Don't forget to light the fire. Brimstone and fire .... Brimstone and fire .... Brimstone and fire ...."

When she started coming 'round. But she couldn't make him stop. And she wouldn't let it go. So everytime she got back up. Like broken glass went tumblin' down. Tumblin' down. First time that I saw your face. You looked so lost and kind. Should have recognized that. Troubled look. From the road I left behind. But I thought that I could comfort you. Or was it you could comfort me,. Never saw your anger 'till you blew. Never saw your anger 'till you blew. And I feel. Oh I'd feel like broken glass. When I fell to the ground. I heard the sound of thunder. Trailing off. When I started coming 'round. But I couldn't make you stop. And you wouldn't let it go. So everytime I got back up. Like broken glass went tumbling down.... The slightest thing could spark you. There was always hell to pay. I could feel your darkness in me. And I knew just what to say. And the rest I can't remember. But it sounded like a gun. But it could have been a firecracker. It could have been a firecracker. Made me run. And you looked. Oh you looked like broken glass. When you fell to the ground. I heard the sound of thunder. Trailing off. When you started coming 'round. But I couldn't make you stop. And you wouldn't let it go. So this time when you got back up. Like broken glass you went. Just like broken glass. Just like broken glass.... ...Tumbling down, tumbling down...."

can't breath,"Can't breath, can't sleep. And words are too big for my head. Some words shouldn't even be said. His eyes his speech. Still rolling around in my bed. Like a ghost waking up from the dead. And it's hare to let go. And it's hard not to show. The fumbling beat of a heart. Repeating itself in the dark. Still laugh sill dream. And bursting apart at the seam. Of whatever i hoped it would be. Little bird on the wire. Little bird from the fire. I'm circling back where you are. Repeating no matter how far. Then time speaks. Through the shuffling feet. And the cold heat. And the soul. Can't breath can't sleep. And words are too big for my head. Some words they should never be said. And it's hard to let go. And it's hard not to show. The fumbling beat of a heart. Repeating itself in the dark. Oo and heart is what you can't give. But you just did, don't you know.... Can't breath can't sleep. And words are too big for my head. Some words they should never be said. And it's hard to let go...."
carey,"The wind is in from Africa. Last night I couldn't sleep. Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here Carey. But it's really not my home. My fingernails are filthy, I got beach tar on my feet. And I miss my clean white linen and my fancy French cologne. Oh Carey get out your cane. And I'll put on some silver. Oh you're a mean old Daddy, but I like you fine. Come on down to the Mermaid Cafe and I will buy you a bottle of wine. And we'll laugh and toast to nothing and smash our empty glasses down. Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers. A round for these friends of mine. Let's have another round for the bright red devil. Who keeps me in this tourist town. Come on, Carey, get out your cane. I'll put on some silver. Oh you're a mean old Daddy, but I like you. Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam. Or maybe I'll go to Rome. And rent me a grand piano and put some flowers 'round my room. But let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now. The night is a starry dome.. And they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll. Beneath the Matalla Moon. Come on, Carey, get out your cane. And I'll put on some silver. You're a mean old Daddy, but I like you. The wind is in from Africa. Last night I couldn't sleep. Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here. But, it's really not my home. Maybe it's been too long a time. Since I was scramblin' down in the street. Now they got me used to that clean white linen. And that fancy French cologne. Oh Carey, get out your cane. I'll put on my finest silver. We'll go to the Mermaid Cafe. Have fun tonight. I said, Oh, you're a mean old Daddy, but you're out of sight."
change of heart,Here I am. Just like I said I would be. I'm your friend. Just like you think it should be. Did you think I would stand here and lie. As our moment was passing us by. Oh I am here. Waiting for your change of heart. It just takes a beat. To turn it around. Yes I'm waiting for your change of heart. At the edge of my seat. Please turn it around. Days go by. Leaving me with a hunger. I could fly. Back to when we were younger. When adventures like cars we would ride. And the years lied ahead still untried. While I stand here. Waiting for your change of heart.... Blind leading blind. Never hear the laughter. Search through time. Nothing reveals the answer. If it's truth that you're looking to find. It is nowhere outside of your mind. I bide my time. Waiting for your change of heart...

cold,"I met a man who drew the line. He couldn't cross his fear of intimacy. He just sighed. Because he left behind all his fantasy. ooh-hoo, ooh, woo, woo, yeah. If you build a wall up, high. You start to crumble. And you never know why. Your tears never dry. --Chorus--. If you're running from the vision. That's in your eyes. There's a collision with what's inside. This ain't livin'.

To hold me in my distress"
cyrus in the moonlight,Oh the hills are full of spirits. And they walk when night comes round. And they speak to who they choose to. When the moon is shining down. And Ramona loves the orchard. And Liza loves the pine. And Cyrus in the moonlight. Loves the flowing of the wine. Oh Cyrus trusts the spirits. And they fill his life with grace. Yeah the father of his fathers. Passed him down the gift of faith. And one night you might hear it. Like a wailing from above. It's just Cyrus in the moonlight. Singing to the one he loves.... And the two girls start to dancing. When they hear that drunken voice. That's when Cyrus asks the moonlight. Do I have to make a choice. 'Tween Liza with her red hair. And Ramona with her blues. And with all these gifts they bring me. Tell me how can I refuse. Well the hills are full of spirits. And they walk when night comes round. And they speak to who they choose to. When the moon is shining down. And Ramona loves the orchard. And Liza loves the pine. And Cyrus in the moonlight. Loves the flowing of the wine. And one night you might hear it. Like a wailing from above. It's just Cyrus in the moonlight. Singing to the one he loves....
dancing with a stranger,"Holding on to the rhythm. I'm standing in my leather and lace. People move to the left, and. Move to the right, and. The whole place starts to shake. Without a net on a real high wire. I'm stepping out with my heels on fire. I started dancing with a stranger. Moving to the break of day. Dancing with a stranger. And I just got swept away. Letting go my inhibitions. Is harder to do than say. But I surrender to the beat. I start shuffling my feet. When I hear that music play. I trip the light fantastic. I touch the sky and it feels like magic. I started dancing with a stranger. Moving to the break of day. Dancing with a stranger. And I just got swept away. Give me a dance, dance. Dancing with a stranger. And it takes my breath away. I ain't looking for mister right. It doesn't matter to me. There's something in the air. Electric I like. Igniting endlessly. I started to dance.... Without a net on a real high wire. I'm stepping out with my heels on fire. I started dancing with a stranger. Moving to the break of day. Dancing with a stranger. And I just got swept away...."
dear john,"Dear John,. What's wrong ? Why can't you just be anything you want ? Why not ? Why not ? I tried to tell you then. You didn't understand. They try and pigeonhole you. Buddy, they don't even know you. But hang on my dear, dear, John. Maybe you're not just like everyone, so what, so what.. And there's more to live for, than some abbreviated encore, much more, much more. You can't define yourself in terms of someone else. You can't say what you're thinking ? But I don't know what you've been drinking. But don't cry. 'Cause life goes on. Dear John, you could be anything you want. Why not ? Why not ?. Why you could even be an astronaut, dear John, dear John.."

hat full of stars,"I was folding up your letters. Unpacking winter clothes. Searching for my hat. I thought I left it by the door. So I tore around the room. Like a bird without a head. I saw your picture waving back at me. From underneath the bed. From a long, long time ago. When all I had. Was a hat full of stars. The one I'll always treasure. The one that you wore. You loved the look. But you never looked inside. You would have seen us there. You could've seen far. You should've seen the magic. In my hat full of stars. I'm trying to live in the present. But I keep tripping on the past. Finding out reality, well clarity. Comes in dribs and drabs. No we never had the time. For everything we had. So it felt like we had nothing. That's what makes this hat so sad. It was a long, long time ago. When all we had. Was a hat full of stars.... ...You would have seen us there. You could've seen far. You should've seen the magic. In my hat full of stars. Now whenever I'm alone. And I think I might forget. I wear my lucky hat. Just like a crown up on my head -. 'Cause all I have. Is a hat full of stars.... If you could see me now. You would've seen far. You should've seen the magic. In my hat full of stars...."

She's a rebel and she'll never be any good.. She's a rebel cuz she never, never does what she should.. And just because she doesn't do, what everybody else does.. That's the reason why I can give her all my love.."

heading for the moon,"Don't close your eyes. Or I might drift away. Under the night. My image bends its shape. I'll be written on the wind. Like in every sailoer's dreams. Heading for the moon. I reach out (echoes). My pulse begins to race (echoes). The crashing sounds. Of fears I've never faced. Let them echo off these waves. With thoughts as brave as they once were. Heading for the moon. And, look. How we write. Over the white. Shadows may chase from behind. But just put them out of your mind, oh. Heading for the moon. Don't close your eyes. Or I might drift away. Under the night. Of never ending shapes. I'll be wishing off the blue. I'll still wanna send my stars. Heading for the moon. And, look. How we write. Over the white. Shadows may chase from behind. But just put them out of your mind, oh. Heading for the moon. Ha ha. Heading for the Moon. So don't close your eyes. Heading for the Moon. Over the white. Your shadows may chase from behind. You might just put them out of your mind. Heading for the Moon."
heading west,"I drop my hat. To a restless wind. This time I'm not gonna chase it again. In a jigsaw dream with soft spoken words. I woke up crying and no one heard. You're looking through me like I never was real. You say you love me but you won't let me feel. So I'm gonna take a chance this time. I'm gonna find myself some place where I can heal. And I'm heading west. Without a sad goodbye. And I'm heading west. I'm like a letter with no address. Just like a book I read. I'm heading west. I said my name. Under my breath. He turned down a twisted road. I won't forget. I'm gonna fly my kite and let out all the string. Hold on to hope, let go everything. I can't stop laughing and it's nothing you said. The altitude of freedom seems to go to my head. And if I fall down on my knees I'm gonna get back up. I'm gonna get back up again. And I'm heading west. Without a sad goodbye. And I'm heading west. I'm like a letter with no address. Just like a book I read. I'm heading west. And I'm heading west.... Just like a book I read...."

You pull me close and we start to move. And we're spinning with the stars above. And you lift me up in a wave of love. (Chorus). When I fell alone. I reach for you. And you bring me home.. When I'm lost at sea. I hear your voice. And it carries me. In this world we're just beginning. To understand the miracle of living. Baby, I was afraid before. Bout I'm not afraid any more.

if you go away,"(Jacques Brel, R. McKuen). If you go away. On this summer day. Then you might as well. Take the sun away. All the birds that flew. In the summer sky. And our love was new. And our hearts were high. When the day was young. And the night was long. And the moon stood still. For the night bird song. If you go away, if you go away, if you go away. But if you stay. I'll make you a day. Like no day has ever been. Or will be again. We'll sail on the sun. We'll ride on the rain. We'll talk to the trees. And worship the wind. And if you go. I'll understand. Leave me just enough love. To hold in my hand. If you go away, if you go away, if you go away. If you go away. As I know you will. You must tell the world to stop turning. Till you return to me. If you ever do,. Oh what good is love without loving you?. I can tell you now, as you turn to go. I'll be dying slowly. Till your next hello. If you go away, if you go away, if you go away,. But if you stay. I'll make you a night. Like no night has ever been. Or will be again. I'll sail on you smile. I'll ride on your touch. I'll talk to your eyes. That I love so much. But if you go. I'll understand. Leave me just enough love. To hold in my hand. If you go away, if you go away, if you go away, if you go away. If you go away, as I know you must. There is nothing left in this world to trust. Just an empty room, full of empty space. Like the empty look I see on your face. I'd have been the shadow of your shadow. If you might have kept me by your side. If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.."

lorraine,"Long ago a lonely man stood. Off of a quiet avenue. A pretty girl in passing chanced to look. That's when he fell, fell for you. I listen to the rain. Pounding on the railing. The beat's a sweet, soft refrain. Of how he found you LORRAINE. He's rocking on a porch you used to know. Here where he swore his love was true. He sips his drink and dreams the days of old. Of when he fell, fell for you. I listen to the rain..."

love to hate,"Fashion fascists out in droves,. Some with powder up their nose .... And the money men who had to steal away.. Telling stories who they've had.. Who's a no count, who looks bad.. Then they turn around and say how much they like you .... Like you ... Like you ? No.. I love to hate you... I love to hate you ... I really do.. Playing games with people lives. Change the rules when stakes are high.. All the vampires come out at night to play .... Things are different today, that is always what you say.. Well maybe so, except for people like you .... Like you ... Like you ? No.. I love to hate you .... Look around you can't look down.. You might miss out on what you think is cool ... You fool.. You've decided who I am, in this brief experience. And if it's worth spending your precious time on me.. My friend Mel he could relate,. Told me once I love to hate. I get so hot the words get stuck. Stuck like you .... Like you ... Like you ? No.. I love to hate you .... It's not just the clothes that you wear. Or the way you do your hair. It's just you.."

White washing down trodden people. They're displayed like a grand masquerade. Making us feel better that we are brave. Like letters that fade into dust. Like harmony, kindness and trust. Wisdom eluding me, wise guys using me. Peace, pece in, peace out. That's right. what 's it all about?. Huh ?. Lyfe , it can shake ya, it can make ya. It can bring ya to the brink of lyfe.. It can bring ya to the bring.. of lyfe. Along the way. Everyday, lyfe"

makin' whoopee (featuring tony bennett),"Another bride, another June. Another sunny honeymoon. Another season, another reason. For makin' whoopee. A lot of shoes, a lot of rice. The groom is nervous, he answers twice. Its really killin' that he's so willin' to make whoopee. Picture a little love nest. Down where the roses cling. Picture the same sweet love nest. And think what a year can bring. He's washin dishes and baby clothes. He's so ambitious he even sews. But don't forget folks,. Thats what you get folks, for makin' whoopee."

minnie and santa,"Worked with a woman named Minnie. One Christmas eve long ago. When I asked ""What you doing this evening ?"". Minnie took on a seasonal glow. She said she'd be waiting for Santa. She'd be wearing a bright red bow. Chorus:. Minnie And Santa. Minnie And Santa. What they're up to only. Heaven knows she wrote on a card. ""Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole"". Now Minnie could not be persuaded. That Santa just did not exist. She swore if she put up some mistletoe. Santa'd come give her a kiss. And there where she'd hung up her stockings. All in their silky, soft, sheen. She'd be laying in wait on a bear skin rug. Where the cookies and milk could be seen. Chorus:. Minnie And Santa. Minnie And Santa. What they're up to only. Heaven knows she wrote on a card. ""Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole"". (musical interlude). Now Minnie was older and wiser. Like a dear old Auntie to me. But the night that she ran off with Santa. Was a real epiphany. Chorus:. Minnie And Santa. Minnie And Santa. What they're up to only. Heaven knows she wrote on a card. ""Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole"". Next Xmas I passed by the bakery. Staring out from on top of a cake. Was jolly old Santa with a big silly grin. And a gal in silk stockings and lace. Oh, Minnie and Santa...."

moonlight shadows,"The last that ever she saw him. Carried away. By a moonlight shadow. He passed on worried and warning. Carried away. By a moonlight shadow.. Lost in a riddle that saturday night. Far away on the other side.. He was caught in the middle. Of a desperate fight. And she couldn't find how to push through. The trees that whisper. In the evening. Carried away. By a moonlight shadow. Sing a song of sorrow and grieving. Carried away. By a moonlight shadow. All she saw was a silhouette of a gun. Far away on the other side.. He was shot six times by a man on the run. And she couldn't find how to push through. I stay,. I pray. I see you in heaven far away. I stay,. I pray. I see you in heaven one day. Four am in the morning. Carried away. By a moonlight shadow. I watched your vision forming. Carried away. By a moonlight shadow. A star was flying in the silvery night. Far away. On the other side. Will you come to talk to me this night. But she couldn't find how to push through. I stay,. I pray. I see you in heaven far away. I stay,. I pray. I see you in heaven one day. Far away on the other side.. Caught in the middle of a hundred and five. The night was heavy and the air was alive. But she couldn't find how to push through. Carried away. By a moonlight shadow. Carried away. By a moonlight shadow. Far away on the other side."
mother,"Over land and over sea. She reaches out to me. Weaving and threading the loom. From womb to womb. Slaves and merchants. Pilgrims and thieves. Felt her hand and charted skys. By following her moon. Mother ... Mother ... Mother .... Some came and built with stone and bone. Some planted fields on promised land. And harvested their dreams,. Then disappeared. As generations lose their memory. I'll try and remind my heart .... And hope that it will set me free. Mother ... Mother ... Mother .... Condeming my true nature. I stood outside of myself ... outside of myself. Conditioning is what made me. Lose sight of myself ... lose sight of myself .... Lose sight. Ravens cry out,. Tides pull in,. Somehow she replenishes .... Giving birth again. Mother ... Mother ... Mother ...."

And I'll take this old man by the hand. To begin again... To begin again...

sally's pigeons,"When I was eight I had a friend. With a pirate smile. Make believe and play pretend. We were innocent and wild. Hopped a fence and slammed the gate. Running down my alleyway. In time to watch Sally's pigeons fly. We loved to watch them dive and soar. Circle in the sky. Free as a bird from three to four. And never knowing why. Neighbors pulled their wash back in. Put away my Barbie and Ken. Look out overhead. While Sally's pigeons fly. I had a fool's confidence. That the world had no boundaries. But instincts and common sense. Come in different quantities. My heart began to. Skip to the beat. Of the boy next door. She had her eye across the street. On someone shy and tall. We lived our dreams. And challenged fate. In tears she told me she was late. And Sally let his pigeons out to fly.... On the dresser sits a frame. With a photograph. Two little girls in ponytails. Some twenty one years back. She left one night with just a nod. Was lost from some back alley job. I close my eyes and Sally's pigeons fly. She never saw those birds again. And me, I can't remember when. A pirate smile hasn't made me cry. I close my eyes. And Sally's pigeons fly...."

If I never had a cent. I'd be rich as Rockefeller. Gold dust at my feet. On the sunny side of the street. I used to walk in the shade with them blues on parade. Now I'm not afraid... this rover has crossed over. Now if I never made one cent. I?ll still be rich as Rockefeller. There will be goldust at my feet. On the sunny, sunny side of the street."
take a chance,"I wanna run my fingers through your hair. Squeeze your hand and tell you that I care. Park in the dark and kiss goodnight. Thrill me h-h-hold me tight. C'mon pretty baby you could maybe take a chance with me. I'll fall still when you walk in the room. I'll look up and you'll be lookin' c-c-cool. Curled up smile upon your lips. One button low my heart just flips. C'mon pretty baby you could maybe take a chance with me. The stars complete the melody. Could you say you belong to me. And as they ride the milkyway. Baby, baby can I have this dance. Baby, baby can you take a chance someday-. Did I tell you now. I wanna...."

that's what i think,Sometimes I think. Things are overwhelming. Sometimes I think. I don't know what I'll do. But I forget the world. And everything around me. That's what I think. When I think about you. The streets are filled. With too many babies. Black air in a sky of blue. People pass by. No life in their eyes. The concrete jungle's. Really going crazy. Sometimes I think. Things are overwhelming.... The rent is due. And the pockets are empty. People ask machines. For the truth. No crystal ball. Can help see it all. But where we gonna find. The dreams to feed the babies. Baby life goes on. That's what people say. But I'm nowhere. If you go away. I'd just be looking. For a brighter day. Sometimes I think. Things are overwhelming.... What can I do. Forget about the world. And everything around me. That's what I think. When I think about you.
the end of the world,"Why does the sun go on shining?. Why does the sea rush to shore?. Don't they know it's the end of the world. If you don't love me anymore?. Why do the birds go on singing?. Why do the stars glow above?. Don't they know it's the end of the world?. It ended when I lost your love. I wake up in the morning and I wonder. Why ev'rything is the same as it was. I can't understand, no, I can't understand. How life goes on the way it does. Why does my heart go on beating?. Why do these eyes of mine crying?. Don't they know it's the end of the world?. It ended when you said goodbye. Why does my heart go on beating?. Why do these eyes of mine crying?. Don't they know it's the end of the world?. It ended when you said goodbye"

the goonies 'r' good enough,Here we are. Hanging on to strains of greed and blues. Break the chain and we break down. Oh it's not real if you don't feel it. Unspoken expectations. Ideals you used to play with. They've finally taken shape. [Chorus:]. What's good enough for you. Is good enough for me. It's good enough. It's good enough for me. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

the more i see you,"Each time I look at you is like the first time. Each time you're near me the thrill is new. And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for. The rare delight of the sight of you for. The more I see you, the more I want you. Somehow this feeling just grows and grows. With every sigh I become more mad about you. More lost without you and so it goes. Can you imagine how much I love you?. The more I see you as years go by. I know the only one for me can only be you. My arms won't free you, my heart won't try. I know the only one for me can only be you. My arms won't free you, my heart won't try"
the other side of here,"I’m just looking for the signs. To help me read between the lines. The times I planned a thousand times. To make it all seem clear…. Try and picture in my mind. A place where I step all the time. Wonder what it’s like to find…. The other side of here. Stop what you are doing ‘cause you’re wearing me down. Don’t throw emotions that go dancing around. Call, call and you say that you’ve no time to explain. Time, time is a concept I can’t get through my brain. I’m just looking for the signs. To help me read between the lines. The times I failed a thousand times. Make it all seem clear…. Try and picture in my mind. A place where I step all the time. Wonder what it’s like to find…. The other side of here. . Don’t try and hurt me with the things that you say. I’m not listening when you’re talking this way. Words, shot like arrows, they go straight to the heart. Blink, blink and I guess you'll miss the dangerous part. I’m just looking for the signs. To help me read between the lines. The times I learned a thousand times. Make it all seem clear…. Try and picture in my mind. A place where I still fall behind. Wonder what it’s like to find…. The other side of here. Stop, I’d just like to stand with both feet on the ground. Stand in a crumbling world and watch it turn around. I’m just looking for the signs. To help me read between the lines. The times I learned a thousand times. Make it all seem clear…. Try and picture in my mind. A place where I still fall behind. Wonder what it’s like to find…. The other side of here. I wonder what it’s like find…. The other side of here"
the tide is turning,"I used to think the world was flat. Rarely threw my hat into the crowd. I felt I had used up my quota of yearning. Used to look in on the children at night. In the glow of their Donald Duck light. And I frighten myself with the thought of my little ones burning. Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning. Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning. Satellites buzzing through the endless night. Exclusive to moonshots and world title fights. Jesus Christ, imagine what it must be earning. Who is the strongest. Who is the best. Who holds the aces. The East. Or the West. This is the crap our children are learning. And oh, oh, the tide is turning. Oh, oh, the tide is turning. Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning. Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning. Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning. Now the satellite's confused. 'Cos on Saturday night. The airwaves were full of compassion and light. And his silicon heart warmed. To the sight of a billion candles burning. But, I'm not saying that the battle is won. But on Saturday night all those kids in the sun. Wrested technology's sword from the hand of the war lords. Oh, the tide is turning. Oh, the tide is turning. Oh, the tide is turning. Oh, the tide is turning. (Repeated)."
the world is stone,"Stone, the world is stone. It's no trick of the light. It's hard on the soul. Stone, the world is stone. Cold to the touch. And hard on the soul. In the grey of the streets. In the neon unknown. I look for a sign. That I'm not on my own. That I'm not here alone. As the still of the night. And the choke of the air. And the winners' delight. And the losers' despair. Closes in left and right. I would love not to care. Stone, the world is stone. From a faraway look. Without stars in my eyes. Through the halls of the rich. And the flats of the poor. Wherever I go. There's no warmth anymore. There's no love anymore. So I turn on my heels. I'm declining the fall. I've had all I can take. With my back to the wall. Tell the world I'm not in. I'm not taking the call. Stone, the world is stone. But I saw it once. With the stars in my eyes. When each colour rang out. In a thunderous chrome. It's no trick of the light. I can't find my way home. In a world of stone."
this kind of love,"his kind of love ain't right. Won't take us through the night. This kind of love's not true. Not good for me or you. Woke up to find myself. Standing in another day. Filled with anxiety. I'm praying for a different way. I give it all I have. Till I have no more to give. I used to think I'd die for love. Now I'd rather live. If everywhere you look, you find some misery. The view from there can make you feel. Just a little crazy. This kind of love ain't right. Won't take us through the night. Some think love equals pain, but.... This kind of love's not true. Not good for me or you. I think we got to get out of this rain. Stay walking through life. Waiting for the other shoe to fall. Dreams cut like a knife. When you think you shouldn't dream at all. I saw a dark cloud. Looks like it follows us around. It doesn't take that much, you know. To make it tumble down. How did we ever go from being so happy. To suffer alone and be strong. Just so we can keep on giving up. This kind of love ain't right. Won't take us through the night. Some think love equals pain, but.... This kind of love's not true. Not good for me or you. I think we got to get out of this rain. If everywhere you look, you find some misery. The view from there can make you feel. Just a little crazy. This kind of love ain't right. Won't take us through the night. Some think love equals pain, but.... This kind of love's not true. Not good for me or you. I think we got to get out of this rain. (Repeat Chorus)"

time after time,"Lying in my bed. I hear the clock tick and think of you. Caught up in circles. Confusion is nothing new. Flashback warm night, almost left behind. Suitcase of memories. Time after. Sometime you pictured me. I'm walking too far ahead. You're calling to me. I can't hear what you've said. Then you said: Go slow, I fall behind. The second hand unwinds. If you're lost you can look.

white man's melody,In the bosom of Europa. Little Liza was caressed. By the music of the angels. Playing underneath her dress. She saw the Great Caruso. And that's when she fell in love. She'd think of him as Elvis. If she knew who Elvis was. Spinning round and round. You can hear her moan. She's all by herself. But she's not alone. Wonderful things happen to me. Whenever I sing that White Man's Melody. Wonderful wave - wash over me. Whenever I sing that White Man's Melody. By the shores of the Gitchee Goomee. She was floating on her bed. She was deaming of Al Jolson. And what she thought he said. He was looking in the mirror. He was putting on the paint. Said the hardest thing about this job. Is being what you ain't. Just an old white man. In a strange new world. Can you come out tonight. Little buffalo girl. Wonderful things happen to me. Whenever I sing that White Man's Melody. Wonderful wave - wash over me. Whenever I sing that White Man's Melody. From the loins of the Liberace. Sprang a million little tunes. And they whirled around Eliza. Like so many little moons. Every jewel held a secret. Every flourish held a clue. As he held her in a rapture. Singing I'll be seeing you. Wonderful things happen to me. Whenever I sing that White Man's Melody. Wonderful wave - wash over me. Whenever I sing that White Man's Melody.
who let in the rain,things like this. can always take a little time. I always thought. We'd be together down the line. We start to fight. And can't get over what was said. 'cause you see Black and White. And I see Red. And I wonder who let in the rain. You know without you. I'm not the same. When love gets strong. People get weak. Sometimes they lose control. And wind up in too deep. They fall like rain. Who let in the rain. I make the bed and cover. Where you used to sleep. I'm smoothing over promises. Made in these sheets. I envy lovers passing by. Out on the street. 'cause what they have. I couldn't keep. And I wonder who let in the rain. You know without you. I'm not the same. When love gets strong. People get weak. Sometimes they lose control. And wind up into deep. They fall like rain. Who let in the rain ..........
wide open,I used to stand in my doorstep. I used to dance in the rain. I used to cast out wishes. That never came back again. I used to sit in my garden. With pretty maids in a row. Silver bells and cockle shells. Waiting to see where we're goin'. Wide Open for anything. Anything love would bring. Wide Open for anything. Anything and everything. Same old scenery. Made me real confused. Tired of the same old feeling. Of being lost and used. I follow lonely footprints. To see where they would lead. Dreaming that they would take me. Where I want to be. Wide Open for anything. Anything love would bring. Wide Open for anything. Anything and everything. An air of confidence. Is now in my stride. I swing my shoulders gently. My hips from side to side. Now I live in the moment. Where there are no regrets. Now I keep my head up. With nothing to forget. Wide Open for anything. Anything love would bring. Wide Open for anything. Anything and everything

winter lovers,"Another yaer's gone by. Since we said goodbye. And I can hardly wait to have you come again. I've been living by the phone. I keep your letters in my pillow case. So I can hold you close pretend I am with you. Everyday is pale and empty. When you're not here with me. I got your memory burnt into my brain. I count the lonely nights until you touch me again. My heart is pounding like an oncoming train. I want to have you so bad. You know it's driving me mad. And I can't hide the way I feel for you. To feel your hand on my cheek. To here the words that you speak. My winter lover turn me red hot and blue. my winter lover turn me red hot and blue. I need to steal your time. Play it over in my mind. Hide your clothes behind the firelight. Wrap me up inside your arms. And every kiss will melt my lips apart. Till the minutes stop and swallow up my heart. When you go back to your world. Does your head skip to me. My head is swirling snow on my window pane. I count the lonely nights until you mm... me again. I love you just the way a moth loves her flame. I want to have you so bad. you know it's driving me mad.... And I can't hide the way I feel for you. To feel your hand on my cheek. To hear the words that you speak. My winter lover turn me red hot and blue. My winter lover turn me red hot and blue. ..Another day, another night. I wish I may I wish I might. The first star that I see tonight. ..Another day, another night. The broken watch that's on my counter. Makes me think I'm lost without ya. ..Another day, another night.... I want to have you so bad. you know it's driving me mad.... And I can't hide the way I feel for you. To feel your hand on my cheek. To hear the words that you speak.

winter wonderland,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?. In the lane, snow is glistening. A beautiful sight. We're happy tonight. Walking in a winter wonderland. Gone away is the bluebird. Here to stay is a new bird. He sings a love song. As we sing along. Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman. Then pretend that he is Parson Brown. He'll say: Are you married?. We'll say: No man. But you can do the job. When you're in town. Later on, we'll conspire. As we dream by the fire. We'll face unafraid. The plans that we've made. Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman. And pretend that he's a circus clown. We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman. Until the alligators knock him down. When it snows, ain't it thrilling. Though your nose gets a chilling. We'll frolic and play. The Eskimo way. Walking in a winter wonderland. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Walking in a winter wonderland. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Walking in a winter wonderland"

working class hero,As soon as you're born they make you feel small. By giving you no time instead of it all. Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. They hurt you at home and they hit you at school. They hate you if your clever and they despise a fool. Till you're so fucking crazy you can't fallow their rules. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. When they've tortured and scared you for 20 odd years. Then they expect you to pick a career. When you can't really function you're so full of fear. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. Keep you doped wit religion and sex and TV. And you think you're so clever and classless and free. But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. There's room at the top they are telling you still. But first you must learn how to smile as you kill. If you want to be like the folks on the hill. A working class hero is something to be. If you want to be a hero just follow me. If you want to be a hero well just follow me.

you don't know,"You don't know where you belong. You should be more careful. As you follow blindly along .... You just need to belong somehow.. Relying on rhetoric .... Not well versed on topics .... Any idea what you're talking about ?. Revisions of history. Fair well in some company. But don't shove that bullshit down my throat. You don't know where you belong .... You should be more careful. As you follow blindly along .... To find something to swear to .... Till you don't know what's right from wrong. You just need to belong somehow.. Left suppresses right. Right suppresses left. So what's the left, and what's right ?. You're told what to wear,. You're told what to like. I'd be nice if you'd think for yourself sometime,. But you don't.. Now you don't know where you belong .... You should be more careful. As you follow blindly along .... Mix sheer hypocrisy with mediocrity. You'll play it safe every time -. So life turns up empty. And you're so dissatisfied. Who are you blaming this time ?. Don't you know ?."
you have to learn to live alone,"We sleep together, close and warm. We calm each other through the storm. We set up home, but in a while. We're tempted by another's smile. When it's all played out. If the truth were known. You have to learn to live alone. We dance around the fading light. You hold me closer every night. You fell in love but I did not. But in the end you're all I've got. When it's all played out. When the truth is known. You have to learn to live alone. We fly around the world too fast. We cannot make one moment last. We love the crowd, we sing and play. We do it all, we get our way. When it's all played out. When the bird has flown. You have to learn to live alone. When we're all played out. If the truth were known. You have to learn to live alone."
you make loving fun,"Sweet wonderful you. You make me happy with the things you do. Oh, can it be so. This feeling follows me wherever I go. I never did believe in miracles. But I've a feeling it's time to try. I never did believe in the ways of magic. But I'm beginning to wonder why. Don't, don't break the spell,. It would be different and you know it will. You, you make loving fun. I don't have to tell you you're the only one. You make loving fun. It's all I wanna do"
you really got a hold on me,"I don't like you. But I love you. Seems like I'm always thinking of you. Oh, oh, oh,. You treat me badly. I love you madly. You've really got a hold on me.

You've really got a hold on me. I love you and all that I want you to do. Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me. Don't wanna leave you. don't wanna stay here. Don't wanna spend another day here. Oh, I just don't fit now. I just can quit now. You've really got a hold on me. You've really got a hold on me, baby. I love you and all that I want you to do. Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me"
