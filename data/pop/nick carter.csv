jewel in our hearts,"Sometimes you try so hard to be things that you're not. You're hiding behind a wall and you can't see. Just one push and the wall will come tumbling down. And then you're left naked standing all alone. Always coming to an end before we can start. Sometimes you feel that you have no control. We'll run for cover, under this roof we will be warm. Right by your side together we'll wait out of the storm. Don't you know a change will come. Just stand firm for all you believe. Don't you know that we will be where we want to be. Just come with me you're not alone. A start shining brightly, a diamond a ruby. A treasure to find, brings a smile to my face. Shake off all your troubles, they roll right off your back. Just like an old stray dog when he's caught in the rain. And I know that some day we'll find what we're looking for. A new you, a new me, a new start. I won't stop moving forward, fell the strength that truth brings. The love we spread shines like a jewel within our hearts. Sometimes you try so hard to be things that you're not. You're hiding behind a wall and you can't see. Just one push and the wall will come tumbling down. And then you're left naked standing all alone. Everyone shares the same humanity. Whether a president or a king. Don't you know that the one thing that matters. Is living a life true to yourself, it's your choice. Then suddenly a friend comes out of nowhere,. Brings us an umbrella and lends a hand. Let's hope that we soon have the same opportunity. When we help our fellow man. A start shining brightly, a diamond a ruby. A treasure to find, brings a smile to my face. Shake off all your troubles, they roil right off your back. Just like an old stray dog when he's caught in the rain. Even when you are lost deep in the storm. I will search, I will find where you are. 'cause I know the love we share like a light in the dark. Shines so bright, like a jewel within our hearts. Now that I can see it's so clear to me. Appreciate the beauty that you bring. With you here by my side, feel the warmth of your smile. Glows like a rainbow in the sun. A start shining brightly, a diamond a ruby. A treasure to find, brings a smile to my face. Shake off all your troubles, they roil right off your back. Just like an old stray dog when he's caught in the rain. And I know that some day we'll find what we're looking for. A new you, a new me, a new start. I won't stop moving forward, feel the strength that truth brings. The love we spread shines like a jewel within our hearts"

light in your eyes,"I can't remember the last time that we kissed goodbye. All our ""I love you""s were just not enough to survive. Something your eyes never told me. But it's only now too plain to see,. Brilliant disguise when you hold me. And I'm free. I've been thinking and here's what I've come to conclude. Sometimes the distance is more than two people can use. But how could I have known girl. It was time and not space you would need. Darling tonight I could hold you and you would know. But would you believe. There's a light in your eyes that I used to see. There's a place in your heart where I used to be. Was I wrong to assume that you were waiting for me. There's a light in your eyes. Did you leave that light burning for me. Cards and phone calls and photograph pictures of you. Constant reminder of all the things you get used to. Is there a chance in Hell or Heaven. That there's still something here to build on. Or do you just pick up the pieces after they fall. But after all. There's a light in your eyes that I used to see. And a song in the words that you spoke to me. Was I wrong to believe in your melody. There's a light in your eyes. Did you leave that light burning for me. Should I keep on waiting or does love keep on fading away. Fading away. It's been a while since I've seen you so how have you been. Did you get my letter I wrote you that I did not send. I tried to call your old number. But the voice of the girl on the phone. I recognized but she told me the number was wrong. There's a light in my eyes it's too bright to see. And a pain in my heart where you used to be. Guess I was wrong to assume that you were waiting here for me. There's a light in your eyes. Did you leave that light burning for me"

the great divide,"I'm waking up you're going to sleep. And I wonder are you thinking of me. I'm getting ready for another day without you. And you're just starting to dream. It's hard to let it go. To make it through the day. It's hard to hold on. When we're both so far away. Maybe we should just move on. And get on with our lives. But how can we survive. When our hearts are so connected. They will die when you take them apart. And when one half of me is missing. If I can't hold you here my arms. Can we overcome the distance. Make it through time. Can our love raise the water. Overcome the great, the great divide, divide, divide. I'm soaking up the sun you're underneath the moon. And I wish I could share it with you. You live your life and I'm living mine. Somehow we've got to find a way through. It's hard to let it go. To make it through the day. It's hard to hold on. When we're both so far away. Maybe we should just move on. And get on with our lives. But how can we survive. (How can we survive). When our hearts are so connected. They will die when you take them apart. And when one half of me is missing. If I can't hold you here my arms. Can we overcome the distance. Make it through time. Can our love raise the water. Overcome the great, the great divide, divide, divide. I keep waiting for the day. Where we find a place to stay. And when we'll always wake up together. (Always will be). And I keep waiting for the time. Every single night belongs to me and you. We will never have to move again. We can spread our roots and grow (Woah). Cos our hearts are so connected. They will die when you take them apart. And when one half of me is missing. If I can't hold you here my arms. Can we overcome the distance. Make it through time. Can our love raise the water. Overcome the great, the great divide, divide, divide"
there for me,"There for me. Nick Carter feat. Melissa Schuman. Lately I’ve been thinking about the things that we’ve been through. And I don’t know if I’d be here. If not for you. I had to take a little time and try to work things out. And you should know that I’ve never mean to let you down. [Chorus]. Cuz I, I wanna tell you that I am sorry and I, I. Even when I'm not giving enough and I’m taking to much. You still there for me. Even when I’ve got nothing at all and I'm ready to fall. You’re still there for me (3 x). Even when I can’t be there for you. You always there for me…. Sometimes I know I can be so hard to understand (it’s ok). Even when I'm lost you show me who I really am. Life with me it hasn’t always an easy ride. But because of you, I’ve learned to lose my selfish high. [Chorus]. Cuz I, I wanna tell you that I am sorry and I, I. Even when I'm not giving enough and I’m taking to much. You still there for me. Even when I’ve got nothing at all and I'm ready to fall. You’re still there for me (3 x). Even when I can’t be there for you. Oh, you are always there for me… Yeah…. Oh, we know it’s love…. Oh wow, must be love…. Woohooo… It’s gotta be real love…. It’s gotta be real love (real love). Even when I'm not giving enough and I’m taking to much. You still there for me. Even when I’ve got nothing at all and I'm ready to fall. You’re still there for me (3 x). Even when I can’t be there for you. Oh, I can’t be there…. Even when I can’t be there for you. You’re always there for me…"
tijuana,"We were south of the border in Mexico. On a way to Rosarito by the side of the road. There was a turn cantina where the drinks were free. Every shot went down like gasoline. We're from a 5 minutes stop to a drunk all nighter. She was a dancing habanero every caballero. wanted to ride her. And now I can't find her. Oh, I left my girl in Tijuana. And now I'm never gonna find her. Last thing I remember we were throwing back tequila. Oh, I left my girl in Tijuana. And now I'm never gonna find her. Last thing I remember we were throwing back tequila. All I ever wanted was a quiet weekend. Now all the federalis are all around me. And they're asking me questions. And as they lock me away all I can say is my only regret. Is that I wish I had a camera. when she made out with those senioritas. Que loca mi vida. Oh, I left my girl in Tijuana. And now I'm never gonna find her. Last thing I remember we were throwing back tequila. Oh, I left my girl in Tijuana. And now I'm never gonna find her. Last thing I remember we were throwing back tequila. La la, la la, la la, la la, where did my baby go?. La la, la la, la la, la la, where did my baby go?. La la, la la, la la, la la, where did my baby go?. La la, la la, la la, la la, where did my baby go?. Last thing I remember we were throwing back tequila. Oh, I left my girl in Tijuana. And now I'm never gonna find her. Last thing I remember we were throwing back tequila. Oh, I left my girl in Tijuana. And now I'm never gonna find her. Last thing I remember we were throwing back tequila"
wanna shout,"Wanna Shout. Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces,. And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons,. And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is,. How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things,. Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it,. Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it. Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it,. Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me.. So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be,. Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty,. There has to be some type of change for this day and age,. We gotta rearrange and flip the page,. Living encaged like animals and cannibals,. Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five,. Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive. Peace of mind's so hard to find.. Chorus:. I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout. What's this madness all about. All this makes me wanna shout. You know it makes me wanna shout,. Throw my hands up and shout. What's this madness all about. All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now. Problems, complications and accusations. Dividing the nations and races of empty faces. A war is taking place.. No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace. Is increasing the height of your spirituality.. Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions. Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living.. The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning,. But will we live to see the dawn.. How can we preach, when all we make this world to be. Is a living hell torturing our minds.. We all must unite, to turn darkness to light,. And the love in our hearts will shine.. We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other. Whatever happened to protecting each other. Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure,. But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever.. Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted,. Family values are contradicted.. Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the pressure is building and I've had enough.. Chorus"
who needs the world,Yeaa ohh. I stare at your face. Into your eyes. Outside there's so much passing us by. All of the sounds. All of the sights. Over the earth and under the sky. Too much cold and too much rain. Too much heartache to explain. Who needs the world when I got you. Switch off the sun the stars and the moon. I have all I need inside of this room. Who needs the world when I got you. Oh no no. I walk on the street. Talk in the dark. I see peoples dreams just falling apart. I open my arms. Tried to be true. Seems like my only truth is you. Am I wrong. Or am I right. All I want is you tonight. Who needs the world when I got you. Switch off the sun the stars and the moon. I have all I need inside of this room. Who needs the world when I got you. Who needs the stars so bright. And the grass so green and the morning light. Who needs the wind to blow and the tide to rise. Who needs it... I don't know. I don't know. Yea. Who needs the world when I got you. Switch off the sun the stars and the moon. I have all I need inside of this room. Who needs the world when I got you. Who needs the world when I got you. Switch off the sun the stars and the moon. I have all I need inside of this room. Who needs the world when I got you. Who needs the world when I got you
