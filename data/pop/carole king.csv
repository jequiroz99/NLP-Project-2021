a night this side of dying,"I remember one young sister with rainbows in her eyes. Standing on a corner with the afternoon's supply. She spoke of other places, perhaps a better road. Then she asked if I could tell her where they kept the mother lode. Like a night this side of dying. Her day's inside the dropper on the shelf. When she hears her lifeline crying. Not a thing you say can stop her. When she just can't stop herself. I remember that July, the panic and the heat. The savage shine of summer, the strychnine in the street. The way they sold each other for a favor in glassine. The best of friends sold brothers for a dime of quinine dreams. Like a night this side of dying. Her day's inside the dropper on the shelf. Like the shelter she's been buying. Not a thing I've got can save her. When she just can't save herself. She just can't save herself"

Nightingale, SHE SERENADES HIS LONELY, LONELY LIFE ALONG. When his tired voice is broken. His golden hope is gone. She makes a lost soul's simple longing. somehow not so wrong. Nightingale, nightingale. He was strong, but he was taken. By the thought of his success. Those spotlights shadows. How they lured him and took him like all the rest. But that old dream don't look good now. No it don't seem quite the same. He needs to hear a tender word. Won't you sing him home again. Nightingale, she sails away up on a sea of song. Nightingale, she serenades his lonely, lonely life along. When his strength is slowly going,. His pride is all but gone. She makes a foolish dreamer listen to one last song. Nightingale ooh sing sweet nightingale. Oh, na, na, na, na. Nightingale ooh sing sweet nightingale. In my little town. I grew up believing. God keeps his eye on us all. And he used to lean upon me. As I pledged allegiance to the wall. Lord I recall my little town. Coming home after school. Riding my bike past the gates of the factories. My mom doing the laundry. Hanging out shirts in the dirty breeze. And after it rains there's a rainbow. And all of the colors are black. It's not that the colors aren't there. It's just imagination they lack. Everything's the same back in my little town. In my little town I never meant nothing. I was just my father's son. Saving my money. Dreamin of glory. Twitching like a finger on a trigger of a gun. Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town. Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town."

At this time in my life let me stop. let me take control of myself and be me. I can see me in a few years. trying to see where reality has gone. I won't let it take me under. At this time in my life.

Then she asked if I could tell her where they kept the mother lode. Like a night this side of dying. Her day's inside the dropper on the shelf. When she hears her lifeline crying. Not a thing you say can stop her. When she just can't stop herself. I remember that July, the panic and the heat. The savage shine of summer, the strychnine in the street. The way they sold each other for a favor in glassine. The best of friends sold brothers for a dime of quinine dreams. Like a night this side of dying. Her day's inside the dropper on the shelf. Like the shelter she's been buying. Not a thing I've got can save her. When she just can't save herself. She just can't save herself"

Your eyes they are open. And oh so are mine. We both need our freedom. Don't you think it's about time. I'm trying to get off this road to nowhere. I'm trying to get off this road to nowhere. Thank you for the good times we've had in the past. But we both know enough to know good times don't last. Baby you're just no good for me. And I'm no good for you. Let's not waste our time talkin'. We both know what to do. We've got to get off this road to nowhere. It's time to get off this road to nowhere. You've got to get off this road to nowhere. We've got to get off this road to nowhere
after all this time,"Ooh, I get a feeling every night when you come home. That life is sweet, yeah, baby. Sweeter than a honeycomb. And oh, darlin, I'm so glad that you are mine. And that you still love me after all this time. You bring music to my soul. Yes, and I can hear it play. Sweeter and longer and stronger. With each and every passing day. And, oh lord, our love is just like vintage wine. Because it's still so good after all this time. I believe, I believe with your sweet love. That you could make a tiger tame. Fill a desert full of rain. Bring me joy when I'm in pain. And even on the coldest winter day. I can hear my heart sing, yeah, baby. For the warmth and the light and the love you give me. To me it's like an early spring. No matter what the season, there can be no doubt in my mind. That I still love you after all this time"
an uncommon love,"Why do we isolate each other. All the walls we build between us. Make it so hard to be together. How can we tear at one another. When the thing we have in common. Is an uncommon love. Walls can fall, tears can mend. So why can't we reach across the line. And touch each other. Here on two sides of the truth. We've a middle ground in common. We have an uncommon love. Time can heal, hearts can mend. So why can't we reach across the line. And touch each other. When will we ever learn. That the thing we have in common. Is an uncommon love.

i´d like to know you better,"I'd like to know you better. There's so much about you I can see. There's a love as good as gold in you. I can feel it when I'm holding you. I want to be your friend, your lover. I'd like to know you better. Being with you feels so good to me. In a world of distraught humanity. You have brought me to my sanity. How lucky we are. We seem to get along so well. Whether or not we'll stay that way. It's much too early to tell. But I'd like to know you better. Though I already feel as if I do. Meeting you has been so good for me. And if only temporarily. I want to be your friend, your lover. Yes, I'd like to know you better. . © 1975 Elorac Music (ASCAP)"
jazzman,"Lift me, won't you lift me above the old routine;. Make it nice, play it clean jazzman.. When the jazzman's testifyin' a faithless man believes. he can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.. It's a gospel kind of feelin', a touch of Georgia slide,. a song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.. Jazzman take my blues away; make my pain. the same as yours with every change you play.. Jazzman, oh jazzman.. When the jazzman's signifyin', and the band is windin' low.. It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.. He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.. He can cry like a fallen angel when risin' time is near.. Jazzman take my blues away; make my pain. the same as yours with every change you play.. Oh lift me, won't you lift me with ev'ry turn around.. Play it sweetly, take me down, oh jazzman.."

labyrinth,"What do you think, are we gonna stay lost in the maze. Of mind games and power plays. Or are we gonna take the chance of a lifetime. To see the light of day. What'll we see when we've used up the last supplies. Of rainbows and butterflies. I keep believing if we all work together. We will surely find a way. We are lost in a labyrinth. There's only one thing to do. Just break down the walls. And reach out your hand to your brother. We can lead each other. To where destiny calls. Faith and lovin' energy will see us through. After a while we will see. The labyrinth isn't anyplace we need to be. Then we can come out from the heart of the darkness. Into a brighter day. One of these days we will know. The heart will take us anywhere we want to go. I only hope it's not too late for the purpose. Tho' just what that is I can't say. We are lost in a labyrinth. There's only one thing to do. Just know in your mind. You want to stand behind your brother. Reach out and lead each other. To a new age in time. Faith and lovin' energy will free your mind"
life without love,It ain't no contest. And it sure ain't no conquest. It's giving and sharing. And a whole lot of caring. It's a look in his eye. That needs no explanation. And I feel sorrow for the ones who. Haven't had this sensation. Life without love. Ain't no life at all. Just take that road. Adn you're bound to fall. Life without love. Is one dead end street. Just thank you lucky stars. We happened to meet. Now to sum up all the pages. They've written about it. You're better off with it. Than you are without it. This moment is our chance. And I hope we don't lose it. We might live to regret it. If we should refuse it. Life without love. Ain't no life at all. Just take that road. Adn you're bound to fall. Life without love. Is one dead end street. Just thank you lucky stars. We happened to meet. Sure you can make it alone. And live in a world of your own. But it hurts to keep feelings inside. I know because we both tried. And life without love. Ain't no life at all. Just take that road. And you're bound to fall. Life without love. Is so bittersweet. Just thank you lucky stars. We happened to meet
like little children,"I don't remember just exactly how it started. All I know is we're both alone and broken-hearted. It doesn't make a bit of sense to me. Why should two people in love have to be. Like little children. Who don't know wrong from right. Like little children. Who just can't help but fight. Why should two grown people have to act. Like little children. There's no storm that you and I can't weather. If we just take the time to talk it out together. But when talkin' stops, tempers rise. And we both do things that aren't wise. Like little children. Who don't know wrong from right. Like little children. Who just can't help but fight. Why should two grown people have to act. Like little children. Now I'm not sayin' you've got to do. Everything that I say. But you've got to realize. That life is a two-way highway. Let's forget about the past and look to the new horizon. Being happy together is the goal we'll keep our eyes on. Love for each other we never lacked. And, oh, I know that we don't have to act. Like little children. Who don't know wrong from right. Like little children. Who just can't help but fight. Like little children. Like little children"

love for the last time,"Seems funny now to think of how I call you up. to talk about all the little things. that were in my mind. You were a friend,. you listened to all I dreamed of. I wanted a real love,. the good old fashioned kind.. It was you all along. You who kept me strong.. I wonder how I could've been so blind. You kissed me like a lover,. loved me like a friend. And I'm in love for the last time.. I got burned,seems like everybody does,by romance. Still I yearn and though I didn't know just what it was,. I got a second chance.. Just think of it,. If we had missed the moment,. we might have spent the years ahead. believing love had passed. I found a love to last a lifetime. I'm in love for the last time,. and time will make it last.. It was you all along,. You who kept me strong. I don't know how I could've been so blind.. You kissed me like a lover,. loved me like a friend. And I'm in love for the last time. It was you all along. you who kept me strong..."
love light,"I've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary. Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard. So I can't understand how it's happened, how. everything's changing.

I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your love light. How I remember the first time we went to the movies. We had decided to meet on the corner downtown. And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me. And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter. When you came into my life it all got so much. brighter. You must have a love light.

love makes the world,There was trouble in my mind tonight. Something inside didn't feel quite right. Then I saw your face in the moonlight and I was right beside you. Don't need words that we used to use. It goes deeper then the words we choose. You cant loose I wanna spread the news u got a love inside you. Some days it's hard to know what your feeling. I've been down that road before. I can't stop believing. Love makes the world go round. As long as your a part of me. Nothing's gonna take me down. Ohhh. Last winter when the snow fall hit. Cold city it was hard to commit. You were out there looking for the perfect fit and I was right beside you. Nothing real comes over night. You weren't sure if it felt right. But sometimes a love can move your life if you let it guide you. Baby you've got to take love where you can find it. Just walk right through that door. I can't stop believing. Love makes the world go round. As long as I'm a part of you nothing's gonna take you down. Love makes the world. Can't stop believing. Gonna make it happen together. We are strong now. Watch us fly. I can't stop believing. Love makes the world go round. As long as your a part of me nothing's gonna take me down. Love makes the world. Can't stop believing.
loving you forever,"I was just leaving--the night was winding down. You touched my shoulder and I turned around. Here we are--the hardest part is done. And all that's left is loving you forever. My heart stopped beating--I couldn't let it show. You were as unexpected as roses in the snow. Just like that I knew you were the one. Now all that's left is loving you forever. In this world we're lucky if we find. A spark that sparks one time. Like when we are together. And in that moment, it happened so fast. My prayers were answered--I found love at last. Take my hand--our life has begun. And all that's left is loving you forever. Here we are--the hardest part is done. And all that's left is loving you forever"

Watch out machine gun, don't let her run you round. Don't let the woman put you six feet in the ground, machine gun. I'll tell you about katherine kelly. Tired of being such small time, now. Figured they'd kidnap a rich man's son. Make it in the world of crime. Watch out machine gun, don't let her run you round. Don't let the woman put you six feet in the ground, machine gun. You'd better watch out machine gun kelly. Careful of what you do, now. If you keep listening to your old lady. Ain't no telling what'll happen to you, now. Machine gun. The government boys they came for machine gun. Took the poor boy away. Stuck him in a hole in leavenworth prison. Where he lived until his dying day. Watch out machine gun, don't let her put you down. Don't let a woman make you out to be a clown. Machine gun. Watch out machine gun"

my favorite things,Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens. Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens. Brown paper packages tied up with strings. These are a few of my favorite things. Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels. Door bells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles. Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings. These are a few of my favorite things. Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes. Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes. Silver white winters that melt into springs. These are a few of my favorite things. When the dog bites. When the bee stings. When I'm feeling sad. I simply remember my favorite things. And then I don't feel so bad. Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens. Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens. Brown paper packages tied up with strings. These are a few of my favorite things. Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels. Door bells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles. Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings. These are a few of my favorite things. Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes.

my lovin' eyes,"It's hard enough to hear you. Express your sympathy. But it's harder still to feel the things. My eyes refuse to see. Oh, my lovin' eyes. When you look upon them, darlin', like you do. You bring these tears into. My lovin' eyes. I watch you take my self-respect. Accepting each excuse. When I've never seen the reason. For your moods or your abuse. Oh, my lovin' eyes. They hold you like the heavens hold the sun. But look what you've done to. My lovin' eyes. Like a man whose way is righteous. His faith in life resigned. I'm a child whose eyes are sightless. And my faith in you is truly blind. It's sad to think of living. As pain that we must feel. But it's sadder still to think of love. As something you conceal. Oh, my lovin' eyes. When you look upon them, darlin', like you do. You bring these tears into. My lovin' eyes"

nightingale,"Like some night bird homeward wingin. He seeks the sheltered nest. Like the sailor's lost horizon,. He needs some place to rest. The songs that he's been singin'. No longer make much sense. And those stranger's cold perceptions. They've killed his confidence. Nightingale, she sails away upon a sea of song. Nightingale, SHE SERENADES HIS LONELY, LONELY LIFE ALONG. When his tired voice is broken. His golden hope is gone. She makes a lost soul's simple longing. somehow not so wrong. Nightingale, nightingale. He was strong, but he was taken. By the thought of his success. Those spotlights shadows. How they lured him and took him like all the rest. But that old dream don't look good now. No it don't seem quite the same. He needs to hear a tender word. Won't you sing him home again. Nightingale, she sails away up on a sea of song. Nightingale, she serenades his lonely, lonely life along. When his strength is slowly going,. His pride is all but gone. She makes a foolish dreamer listen to one last song. Nightingale ooh sing sweet nightingale. Oh, na, na, na, na. Nightingale ooh sing sweet nightingale. In my little town. I grew up believing. God keeps his eye on us all. And he used to lean upon me. As I pledged allegiance to the wall. Lord I recall my little town. Coming home after school. Riding my bike past the gates of the factories. My mom doing the laundry. Hanging out shirts in the dirty breeze. And after it rains there's a rainbow. And all of the colors are black. It's not that the colors aren't there. It's just imagination they lack. Everything's the same back in my little town. In my little town I never meant nothing. I was just my father's son. Saving my money. Dreamin of glory. Twitching like a finger on a trigger of a gun. Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town. Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town."
no easy way down,"Your toy balloon has sailed in the sky. But now it must fall to the ground. Now your sad eyes reveal. Just how badly you feel. 'Cause there is no easy way down. The view from the cliffs must have been exciting. And up to the peaks you were bound. Now you're stranded alone. And the path is unknown. And there is no easy way down. No, it isn't very easy. When you're left on your own. No, it isn't very easy. When each road you take. Is one more mistake. And there's no one to break your fall. And lead you back home.

That will last beyond a dream, beyond a lifetime. We are the lucky ones. Some people never get to do. All we got to do. Now and forever.... I will always think of you. Didn't we come together?. Didn't we live together?. Didn't we cry together?. Didn't we play together?. Didn't we love together?. And together we lit up the world. I miss the tears. I miss the laughters.

only love is real,As I bask in the glow of a just-lit fire. Feeling the warmth as the flames grow higher. I think it's true that nothing. is really new under the sun. Watching a new love grow. from old love's embers. Yesterday's gone but today remembers. Doesn't it seem to come down the same for everyone. (Chorus). Only love is real. Everything else illusion. Adding to the confusion of the way we connive. At being alive. Tracing a line till we can define. The thing that allows us to feel. Only love is real. Childhood dreams like muddy waters. Flowing through me to my son and daughters. Everything I ever thought is confirmed as truth to me. Even as I see the way that I want to go now. Still I had wished I had known what I know now. Maybe I could have spared you. Giving your youth to me. (Chorus). Only love is real. Everything else illusion. Adding to the confusion of the way we connive. At being alive. Tracing a line till we can define. The thing that allows us to feel.
out in the cold,"I only wanted to play. I thought what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him anyway. But he found out and someone else gave him her hand to hold. And suddenly I find myself out in the cold. He trusted me all the time. I thought I could see another man and he would still be mine. Well yesterday I had a good thing worth more than gold. Today he's got a truer love and I'm out in the cold. I had a love warmer than fire. But I listened to my desire. Now yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's heart aches. I'm payin' (payin') for my mistakes. Now girl, take a tip from one who knows. If you open up a new door, you may find the old one's closed. So be true to your good man. Take a lesson from the story I have told. Or you just might get-a left now out in the cold. You just might get-a left now out in the cold. Don't let yourself get left now out in the cold. Don't let yourself get-a left now out in the cold"
pleasant valley sunday,The local rock group down the street. Is trying hard to learn their song. Serenade the weekend squire. Who just came out to mow his lawn. Another Pleasant Valley Sunday. Charcoal burning everywhere. Rows of houses that are all the same. And no one seems to care. See Mrs. Gray. She's proud today. Because her roses are in bloom. Mr. Green. He's so serene. He's got a TV in every room. Another Pleasant Valley Sunday. Here in status symbol land. Mothers complain about how hard life is. And the kids just don't understand. Creature comfort goals. They only numb my soul and make it hard for me to see. My thoughts all seem to stray to places far away. I need a change of scenery. Another Pleasant Valley Sunday. Charcoal burning everywhere.

read between the lines,"I wrote you a letter the other day. And I told you I was happy for you. And your new love. Now there was much more. I wanted to say. But it's hard for me to get over. My last bit of pride. But if you read between the lines. You will know that I still love you. Oh, and I'll love you forever. And always. When we were together. I never thought. You would ever be anything else. But a friend and a true love. But time has thrown its net. And now I'm caught. And I'm helpless to tell you. How much I miss you by my side. But if you read between the lines. You will know that I still love you. Oh, and I'll love you forever. And always. Do you remember smiling at me. When I looked at you. And I first saw you. And I wanted you. And you wanted me. But it's over now and I just can't see. How I'm gonna live without you. But if you read between the lines. You will know that I still love you.

And let the music come and carry you along. Come on, come on, come on, ride the music"
safe again,"Words and Music by. Carole King. Seems so hard. All I want to do is let down my guard. Laugh like a child and play out in the yard. I want to feel safe again. I don't know. What happened to you, where did you go. Wish I could not feel the cold wind blow. I want to feel safe again. If only I could believe everything will soon be. like all the fairy tales I've read. But I feel so lost and naked. And I wake up with the shape of a dream. In my head. Seems so hard. All I want to do is let down my guard. Get through just one more day unscarred. I want to feel safe again. I want to feel safe again. Safe again with you. Â© 1999 Lushmole Music (BMI)."

snow queen,"High on a snow-covered mountain. From her throne she looks down at the clowns. Who think youth can be found in a fountain. High on the wings of her rhythms. She will smile at the guys who come on with their eyes. But she'll never dance with them. And in smoke-filled rooms of electric sound. A legend is built around. The Snow Queen. You may believe you're a winner. But with her you will soon bite the dust. And discover you're just a beginner. You may not think you're a loser. But in mid-air you'll be hung while you trip on your tongue. And it'll only amuse her. In the morning air you are frozen there. Caught in the icy stare of. The Snow Queen. No, my friend, she doesn't want what you're selling. My friend, there must be a place you can hide. And into the night you'll fade, knowing you lost the game. And just how she got her name of.

something in the way she moves (with james taylor),"Something in the way she moves. Or looks my way, or calls my name. That seems to leave this troubled world behind. And if I'm feeling down and blue. Or troubled by some foolish game. She always seems to make me change my mind. And I feel fine anytime she's around me now. She's around me now almost about all the time. And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now. She's been with me now quite a long, long time and I feel fine. Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning. And I find myself careening in places. where I should not let me go. She has the power to go. Where no one else can find me and to silently remind me. Of the happiness and the good times. That I know, and then I just got to go then. It isn't what she's got to say but how she thinks. And where she's been. To me, the words are nice, the way they sound. I like to hear them best that way. It doesn't much matter what they mean. She says them mostly just to calm me down. And I feel fine anytime she's around me now. She's around me now almost about all the time. And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now. She's been with me now quite a long, long time. And I feel fine"
song of long ago,"Whispering wind came, uninvited. Looking for somewhere else to go. Here is a lamp I've left unlighted. Aren't you someone I should know. Memory's flame is soon ignited. Lighting my lamp with amber glow. Quietly, friends are reunited. Singing a song of long ago, la, la, la. Cry, cry for someone. Who just can't be happy. And be glad you can feel enough to cry. Younger than always, time descended. Bringing me brand new seeds to sow. Now that they've been a long time planted. What must I do to help them grow. If it had been as I intended. I wouldn't have the peace I know. Loving the people I've befriended. And singing a song of long ago, la, la, la. As it began, so I will end it. Singing a song of long ago. Loving the people I've befriended. And singing a song of long, long, long ago"

Watch 'em do a few laps around the sun. But if you don't go in for far-off places. I'll take you home with me. Didn't I see you walkin' on Main Street. Lookin' in the windows. Waitin' by turnstiles. Thinking of things you thought you'd like to buy. Living off dreams stored up in film cans. Looking at screens just waiting your turn while. You looked up and saw a rocket in the sky.

Tear down all our hopes and our dreams. Tell me, does the rain fall (surely, surely). And does the summer always follow spring. How does a turtle go (slowly, surely). That's how my love grows, surely, surely, surely. Darling, if your head misleads you. Just listen to your heart--it knows I need you. Just as surely as the sun is gonna rise. Just as surely as the birds are gonna sing. Just as surely as everything is part of everything. I'm a part of you. Surely you know that I'm a part of you. And surely you know that I love you.

Welcome home, sweet Adonis. Your heart needs time to mend. Welcome home, sweet Adonis, my old friend. Hoping for the promise, staying for the show. In a world of brief advantage, the victims come and go. Their faces seem so honest, their manners have such style. Oh, but when hunger means existence. There's a feast in every smile, every smile. So welcome home, sweet Adonis. Welcome back, my old friend. I'm glad to see you made it up that hard road once again. Welcome home, sweet Adonis. Your highway's found an end.

sweet baby james (with james taylor),"There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range. His horse and his cattle are his only companions. He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons. Waiting for summer, his pastures to change. And as the moon rises he sits by his fire. Thinking about women and glasses of beer. And closing his eyes as the doggies retire. He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear. As if maybe someone could hear. Goodnight you moon light ladies. Rock-a-bye sweet baby james. Deep greens and blues are the colors. I choose, won't you let me go down in my dreams?. And rock-a-bye sweet baby james. Now the first of december was covered with snow. And so was the turnpike from stockbridge to boston. Though the berkshires seemed dreamlike. On account of that frosting. With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go. There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway. A song that they sing when they take to the sea. A song that they sing of their home in the sky. Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep. But singing works just fine for me. So, goodnight you moon light ladies. Rock-a-bye sweet baby james. Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose. Won't you let me go down in my dreams?. And rock-a-bye sweet baby james"

tapestry,"My life has been a tapestry. Of rich and royal hue;. An everlasting vision. Of the ever-changing view;. A wond'rous woven magic. In bits of blue and gold;. A tapestry to feel and see;. Impossible to hold.. Once amid the soft silver. Sadness in the sky,. There came a man of fortune;. A drifter passing by.. He wore a torn and tattered cloth. Around his leathered hide. And a coat of many colors;. Yellow, green, on either side.. He moved with some uncertainty. As if he didn't know. Just what he was there for. Or where he ought to go.. Once he reached for something. Golden hanging from a tree. And his hand came down emp-ty.. Soon within my tapestry,. Along the rutted road,. He sat down on a river rock. And turned into a toad.. It seemed that he had fallen. Into someone's wicked spell. And I wept to see him suffer,. Though I didn't know him well.. As I watched in sorrow,. There suddenly appeared. A figure gray and ghostly. Beneath a flowing beard.. In times of deepest darkness. I've seen him dressed in black.. Now my tapestry's unraveling;. He's come to take me back.. He's come to take me back.."

I get away from the hustling crowds. And all that rat race noise down in the street. Up on the roof. On the roof's the only place I know. Where you just have to wish to make it so. Oh, let's go up on the roof. At night the stars put on a show for free. And darling, you can share it all with me. I keep a-telling you. Right smack dab in the middle of town. I found a paradise that's trouble-proof. Up on the roof. So if this world starts getting you down. There's room enough for two, up on the roof. Up on the roof, everything is allright. Up on the roof, oh, come on, baby. Up on the roof. Up on the roof"
venusian diamond,"On the thirty-first day of the summer moon. In the marketplace. Somebody touched my hand and said. I was a woman of taste. Then with a flutter of wings. Amid the clutter of things. I saw the Venusian Diamond through a sea of grace. It said, 'Lay all of your money down. And I will be your own. Do it if you can. If you don't, you better leave it alone'. Then there appeared a serpent hanging. Like a thunder rope. He said, 'Pull me'--I did. And fell into the wrong end of a telescope. So I began to run. I knew not to where I'd come. I could hear the Venusian Diamond and it. Gave me hope. It said, 'Shatter all your images. And I will be your own. Do it if you can. If you don't, you better leave it alone'. Selves. Selfish. Selfless. Self"
wasn´t born to follow,"Oh, I'd rather go and journey where the. Diamond crescent's flowing. And run across the valley. Beneath the sacred mountain. And wander through the forest. Where the trees have leaves of prisms. That break the light up into colors. That no one knows the names of. And when it's time I'll go and wait. Beside the legendary fountain. Till I see your form reflected. In its clear and jeweled waters. And if you think I'm ready. You may lead me to the chasm. Where the rivers of our visions. Flow into one another. And I'll stay awhile and wonder. At the mist that they've created. And lose myself within it. Cleanse my mind and body. And I know at that moment. As I stand in that cathedral. I will want to dive. Beneath the white cascading water. She may beg and she may plead. And she may argue with your logic. Mention all the things I'll lose. That really have no value. Though I doubt that she will ever. Come to understand my meaning. In the end she'll surely know. I wasn't born to follow. . © 1968 Screen Gems-EMI Music, Inc. (BMI), Screen Gems-EMI Music, Inc. (BMI)"
way over yonder,"Way over yonder is a place that I know. Where I can find shelter from hunger and cold. And the sweet tasting good life is easily found. Way over yonder - that's where I'm bound. I know when I get there, the first thing I'll see. Is the sun shining golden - shining rigth down on me. Then trouble's gonna lose me - worry leave me behind. And I'll stand up proudly in true peace of mind. Way over yonder is a place I have seen. In a garden of wisdom from some long ago dream. May be tomorrow I'll find my way. To the land where the honey runs in rivers each day. And the sweet tastinggood life is so easily found. Way over yonder - that's where I'm bound"
we are all in this together,"The just are seeking justice. The meek are reaching out. For something only children. Can really know about. And some men cry for mercy. While they deny their brothers' pain. And some men laugh for reasons. They can never quite explain. We are all in this together. And maybe we'll see that one day. When we conquer our fear together. When we finally find a way. And we all need forgiving. For all the damage done. For the things we do, not thinking. For the hurt that we've caused someone. But me, I keep on living. Caught somewhere there between. The reason and the meaning. The vision and the dream. We are all in this together. I know that seems easy to say. But I don't use the word forever. It's enough just to say someday"
welcome to my living room,"Welcome to my living room. It’s not a womb, it’s not a tomb. Not a June bride or a December groom. Tonight, here in Hyannis, we’ll be playing at a reasonable volume. Here in my living room. I’m gonna play some songs for you. There are so many I’d like to do. If I don’t get to them all, I hope you’ll forgive me. 'Cause I’m 62, and there’s so many I'd like to do, old and new. But I’ll try to do all I can in the time they give me. Let’s set aside all the fussing and fighting. And make this night about songwriting. Sing and play some favorite tunes. Welcome to my living room"

So if you're looking for something new. All you have to do is choose. What have you got to lose. Yes, it shows you need a change. And you've been feeling very strange. That the things that made you feel so good before. Have not been feeling good 'cuz I'm so much in love with you. All you have to do is try somethin' new. What have you got to lose. And when you're ready let me know. Come to me, I'll let your river flow. When you're ready, aw, give me a sign. It's time you stepped back out in the sunshine. Wouldn't you like to wake up and find.

where you lead,"Wanting you the way I do. I only want to be with you. And I would go to the ends of the earth. 'Cause, darling, to me that's what you're worth. Where you lead, I will follow. Anywhere that you tell me to. If you need, you need me to be with you. I will follow where you lead. If you're out on the road. Feeling lonely and so cold. All you have to do is call my name. And I'll be there on the next train. Where you lead, I will follow. Anywhere that you tell me to. If you need, you need me to be with you. I will follow where you lead. I always wanted a real home with flowers on the window sill. But if you want to live in New York City, honey, you know I will. I never thought I could get satisfaction from just one man. But, if anyone could keep me happy, you're the one who can. And where you lead, I will follow. Anywhere that you tell me to. If you need, you need me to be with you. I will follow where you lead"
why are you leaving,"You told me that you had to go. You said you could not stay here. That being here just made you sad. For sunshine, ships and easy land. And you miss the pretty things you had. So what am I to tell you. Why are you leaving. Why are you leaving. And what's that secret sorrow that you're carrying. You said you were not born to win. But I don't think you mean it. That you think you'd better live alone. And gather people one by one. Oh, but when each new day is done. Will you turn and face my window. Why are you leaving. Why are you leaving. And what's that secret sorrow that you're carrying. As the day begins to fade. Electric lamps, they trick you. Into seeing faces on the wall. Old memories that you recall. And you're afraid you'll lose them all. And the promises they made you. Why are you leaving. Why are you leaving. And what's that secret sorrow that you're carrying. Why are you leaving. Why are you leaving. Why are you leaving. Why are you leaving. Why are you leaving. Why are you leaving"

Or just a moment's pleasure. Can I believe the magic of your sights. will you love me tomorrow. Tonight with words unspoken. You say that I'm the only one. But will my heart be broken.

wings of love,You fill me with love I can give. You fill me with life I can live. You fill me with song I can sing. And truth that makes the kingdoms ring. On love's music we fly. We soar ever-so-high. Through clouds of harmony. And down through the sky. We flow to a place. Where people kiss each other's eyes. And the sweet-sounding smell. That looks like a Rocky Mountain spring. Blossoming sighs. And the rainbow people build bridges of life. That blend our hearts. For the eternal now

you gentle me,"When tempers flare to flame. When no one cares to listen while I'm trying to explain. You see the anger rise in me. And you calm me down again. Like the first spring lilac rain, you gentle me. Like innocence regained, you gentle me. And the feeling that remains grows stronger by degree. When you're gentle to me. When rumor comes to call. Suspicion's taking over and I'm back against the wall. You just smile assuringly. And my defenses fall. Like the first spring lilac rain, you gentle me. Like innocence regained, you gentle me. And the feeling that remains grows stronger by degree. When you're gentle to me. When life seems so relentless, you gentle me. When my striving seems so senseless, you gentle me. You lift my spirits, I get higher by degree. When you're gentle to me. When tension's taking shape. When I feel the pressure building and it's just too much to take. You touch the anxious need in me. With love for lovin's sake. Like the first spring lilac rain, you gentle me. Like innocence regained, you gentle me. And the feeling that remains grows stronger by degree. When you're gentle to me"
"you go your way, i'll go mine","You've put these distances between us. You've built these walls, they're your design. With sharp and angry lies, you've cut the binding ties. While making love seem so unkind. Well, allright, you go your way, I'll go mine. I'll get over you in time. There's nothing here to hold you now. Oh, it's your life, so make it shine. You go your way, I'll go mine. I've tried to justify your thinking. I've given in and been denied. Like a hundred times before, you take and ask for more. The only thing you leave is compromise. Well, allright, you go your way, I'll go mine. I'll get over you in time. There's nothing here to hold you now. We left those dreams so far behind. You go your way, I'll go mine. Oh, there's no need for false amending. Things get so confusing when you do. When love's become a loss, we spend our nights defending. I feel so damn defeated when we're through. But allright, you go your way, I'll go mine. I'll get over you in time. There's nothing here to hold you now. I just can't fight your willful mind. You go your way, I'll go mine"
you will find me there,"You don't have to wear the weight of the. world on your shoulders. Don't you know I'll be there for you, always, always. You can tell me anything, and you know I'll understand. When you're down and out, and your soul is bare. You just turn around - you will find me there. You keep on giving everyone. so much more than your share. So many things you do in so many ways, always. But you need someone you can hold on to. When you're down and out, I will always care. You just turn around - you will find me there. When it's all gone wrong, it's falling down on you. Lean on me, I'll be strong. I will keep you safe, keep you warm. When you're down and out, I will always care. You just turn around - you will find me there. I will take your hand, I will dry your tears. I will comfort you when your hope has disappeared.

When you're down and out, I will be right there. You just turn around, you will find me. You will find me there. Â© 1997 Lushmole Music (BMI) ~ AlÃ¢s Street Music, Inc. / Warner/Chappell Music, Inc.

you're something new,"When I left the world behind me. Retreating through the past. You reached out to find me. And brought me back at last. You've shown me something. Beyond my looking glass. Now love's in my reflection. In the shadow that you cast on me, and you. You're something new. You're something new. Under the sun. Under the moon, you're the light of creation. And I knew. That I'd come to love you. Life seemed oh-so-temporary. A case of here-and-gone. And I survived, just barely. Until you came along. But now each day I'm given. Is one more day I know. A love that's so unselfish. It's a pleasure just to show my love to you. You're something new. You're something new, under the sun. Under the moon, you're the light of creation"
you're the one who knows,"Waking up alone, I find my mind is reaching out to distant corners. Crystal mourners are drawing me to Babylon. Can you really stay yourself and flow with dedication. You're the one who knows and now you're gone. We got a feeling and I'm gonna try to keep it for a long time. It was a wrong time, though we had so much to travel on. Can you hold the love I gave in joyful consummation. You're the one who knows and now you're gone. Can you see my reflection in the facets of the prisms that you gave me. One day I am yellow. One day I am blue--can you save me. I'll be yours forever in the secret magic forest. That we dreamed about together. Can you see the color that I am today. I know I wanna stay in a good way. Waking up alone I find my mind is calling out. And I know you feel me. You know the real me is whatever color love takes on. Can you live with someone who's a mistress of illusion. You're the one who knows and now you're gone"
