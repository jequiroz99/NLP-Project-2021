never say goodbye,"Lights down smokey area in the alley. Random night when I met you. Shadows of the stars shift casually. My night was changed -- I saw your eyes blue. Before a word was said, we connected. A formal shaking hands to be cool. No phone number no Instagram exchanging. You said 'ciao' to follow the rules. [chorus]. If I had the power to fly. I would leave this town with you. But you said good bye, good bye, good bye. Leaving nothing behind behind behind. I walked away dragging all my sorrows. Talking to my cast of demons. I curse my fucking mind, feeling affected. For you broken smile and reasons. Left me burning inside. (play around with Dmin in addition to Amin). All of the red lights. In this city were renewed. When I felt from afar your perfume. [When I felt your x perfume]. As you crossed the street. From the bar to my direction. I was lost, I was consumed. â€‹"
