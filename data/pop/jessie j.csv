i believe in love,"I find myself daydreaming of a better world. Memories can bleed in my open heart. London clouds are crying. But I'm dancing in the pouring rain. Grown up life is to learn not to fall apart. And I'm closer to high vibrations. Earning all the sweeter and deeper waves. And what I can do, to make it. To be at peace. And be true to me, in every way. I know I'll be alright. I know that I'll survive. I know I'll rise above it. 'Cause I believe in love. And even when it's hard. Livin' with my scars. It never miles to nothing. 'Cause I believe in love. Nobody tells me how to grow, no. I just gotta know. Emotional, but I won't define myself on the past. Balance is key.

Everybody's bruising. Just be true to who you are. Who you are, who you are, who you are. Who you are, who you are, who you are. No no no no no no no. Who you are, who you are, who you are. Who you are, who you are, who you are. Brushing my hair, do I look perfect?. I forgot what to do to fit the mold. The more I try, the less it's working. Cause everything inside me screams:.

But tears don't mean you're losing. Everybody's bruising. There's nothing wrong with who you are. Yes, nos, egos. Fake shows like woo. Just go, and leave me alone. Real talk, real life, good luck, good night. With a smile.... That's my home, yeah. That's my home.... No. No, no, no, no, no.... Don't lose who you are, in the blur of the stars.

We've got so much more to do. Life won't be the same without you oh ohhh. We've got so much more to laugh. We've got so much more to lose. No my life won't be the same without you ooh. I wish we'd spent more time together. I should have come to see you more. Wish i'd have learned what you loved. What you hated, what you liked. And the things you adore. And now I'm here trying to fill the space. That once was framed by your face. And ... when you gone. All I have is this so-oooh-ong. We've got so much more to live. We've got so much more to lose. Life won't be the same without you yeaah. We've got so much more to laugh. We've got so much left to do. No my life won't be the same without you"
you don't really know me,"The girl who always say yes. Wants to scream no. Takes over everyone's stress. Ignores her own. The life and soul of the party. But love to stay home. She says she's not broken-hearted. But she cries on her own. Playing pretend. I shouldn't hide it. It isn't right. Being a liar. I'm crossing the line. Dancing with fire. When I'm not fine. Should I deny it?. Cause I'm going crazy when I'm not okay. I keep praying that the cracks. Don't show my pain. 'Cuz even when I'm falling. I say my life is like a dream. But I'm fighting through a nightmare. 'Cuz I'm not really being me. See you don't really know me. The girl starts all the jokes, just make her laugh. Preaches the do's and the dont's but loves to be bad. Smiles when they guess who she's loving. What they say makes her mad. She says ""I'm fine, I need nothing"". But she hopes for your hand. Playing pretend. I shouldn't hide it. It isn't right. Being a liar. I'm crossing the line. Dancing with fire. When I'm not fine. Should I deny it?. Cause I'm going crazy when I'm not okay. I keep praying that the cracks. Don't show my pain. 'Cuz even when I'm falling. I say my life is like a dream. But I'm fighting through a nightmare. 'Cuz I'm not really being me. See you don't really know me. You don't really know me. You don't really know me. How can you know me?. You don't really know me. You don't really know me. Cause I'm going crazy when I'm not okay. I keep praying that the cracks. Don't show my pain. 'Cuz even when I'm falling. I say my life is like a dream. But I'm fighting through a nightmare. 'Cuz I'm not really being me. And you don't really know me. I'm not really being me. I'm not, not, not really being me"

young blood,"We're only young and naive still. We require certain skills. The mood it changes like the wind. Hard to control when it begins. The bittersweet between my teeth. Trying to find the in-betweens. Fall back in love eventually. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Can't help myself but count the flaws. Claw my way out through these walls. One temporary escape. Feel it start to permeate. We lie beneath the stars at night. Our hands gripping each other tight. You keep my secrets hope to die. Promises, swear them to the sky. The bittersweet between my teeth. Trying to find the in-betweens. Fall back in love eventually. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. As it withers. Brittle it shakes. Can you whisper. As it crumbles and breaks. As you shiver. Count up all your mistakes. Pair of forgivers. Let go before it's too late. Can you whisper. Can you whisper. Can you whisper. Can you whisper. The bittersweet between my teeth. Trying to find the in-betweens. Fall back in love eventually. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. The bittersweet between my teeth. Trying to find the in-betweens. Fall back in love eventually. Yeah yeah yeah yeah"

One day when you discover,. How bright I try to love you now. I won't be around. It's too late. Your loss I'm found. I gave my all. Guess you knew all along. I would fall. For your teasing, why?. And no matter what,. I won't go back to who I was. And watch you will be there, oh, no. I'll tell you. Why I can't be your lover. I'm too bright to shine under clouds. You won't turn me down.
