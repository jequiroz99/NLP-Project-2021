eu não mudaria nada em você (feat. joe jonas),"Eu sei,. Que ele nunca vai me ouvir. Minhas palavras tendem a sumir. Ele é tão Inalcançável. Eu sei,. Que pra ele é diversão. Sempre estar perdendo a razão. Like he doesn't even care. Você, me. We're face to face. But we don't see eye to eye. Somos terra e ar!. Fire and rain. Nada vai nos mudar. Drive me insane. But I can't stay mad at you for anything. Diferentes demais. Venus and Mars. deixo tudo pra trás. Different stars. You're the harmony to every song I sing. And I wouldn't change a thing. She's always trying to seize her day. Just wanna let the music play. She's all or nothing. But my feelings never change. Não, não é assim que deve ser!. De cada pensamento quer saber. That's what all of my friends say. Você, me. We're face to face. But we don't see eye to eye. Somos terra e ar!. Fire and rain. O Deserto e o Mar. Drive me insane. E eu não mudaria nada em você. Diferentes demais. Venus and Mars. deixo tudo pra trás. Like Different stars. You're the harmony to every song I sing. And I wouldn't change a thing. When I miss she's no. Quando eu chamo ele não vem. We're perfectly imperfect. But I wouldn't change a thing. Somos terra e ar!. Fire and rain. Nada vai nos mudar. Drive me insane. But I can't stay mad at you for anything. Diferentes demais. Venus and Mars. deixo tudo pra trás. Different stars. You're the harmony to every song I sing. And I wouldn't change a thing. But I can't stay mad at you for anything. Diferentes demais. Venus and Mars. deixo tudo pra trás. Different stars. You're the harmony to every song I sing. And I wouldn't change, wouldn't change a thing"
