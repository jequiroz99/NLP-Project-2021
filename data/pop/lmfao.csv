T-pain is winking at her. Ludacris is with her chick but his homeboys giggle at her. What's the matter? Oh nothing. [?] bottles start to shot again. She grabbed my hand, throw me to the dancefloor. We dance closely, and then she pulls my hands low. Oh, I know where this is gonna go. I've seen it in a dream before. I love it when you hold me tight. And then we kiss til the morning light.

Yo, every single thing I spit on you know what it's cost. With some of my diamond shit on, you know who the boss. Either way I style on them all day make way. Put a smile for the women unless they know I don't play. People movin when I wake up and possessin' the best shit. Always the first to do with introducing the next shit. I ain't talkin', I ain't even put they neck down yet. To tell the truth a lot of nigga's need a background check, yo. Could give a fuck about your cute buzz. I return in case you may know who the truth was. ... I'm in a club bottle-sippin' and the bitches is jumpin'. When we step up in the buildin' and you see how we get it. And watch all of my nigga's... 'till you know how we did it. Throw it all up in the street just see the kid on a roll. And let me bang with this shawty when I take it to the hole. Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole. Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole. Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole. I beat it up. Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole. Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole. Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole. I beat it up"

And I remember when you gave me a secret, popped in the DVD and peeped it. And if you dreamin you achivin, after that it was a wrap. And now I walk in the club like a million times,. Spit on the mic like a million rhymes,. We party rock to a billion drops and this shot makes one zillion shots. Yes I'm feelin' good, and we the best I'm feelin' good.

Everyday I see my, everyday I see my dream. everyday I see my dream. Every time I dive in my pool. It's hard to be humble. When I do the breaststroke through an underground tunnel. And come up on the other side in a Jacuzzi. Being greeted by two naked models. with suds on their booties. They give me hugs and lots of kisses. And they ask me what my wish is. I say go and call your bitches. cause there's gonna be a party. Then they wash my body as a team. And they say ""Foo, your royal penis is clean! "". And I'm like. [chorus]. Yes, it's on and poppin'.

Own property from the California to Hamptons and I. Sip from my water fountain that spits soda. Look out the window. and wave at my next door neighbor Oprah. I check to see how my album's doing today. The group LMFAO goes double platinum HEY!. I got a party, man. That's how I live. So I take an elevator to the club in my crib. [chorus x4]. Every day I see my dream. Every day I see my-every day I see my dream. Every day I see my dream. Ev-ev-every day I see my dream. Every day I see my every day I see my dream. [repeat]"
