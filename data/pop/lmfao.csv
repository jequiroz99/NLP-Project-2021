It's so sick and I'm startin' to mix thanks to an; rest in piece banana split. Was the place we all went Sundays, to make people feel this way we would one day. And I remember when you gave me a secret, popped in the DVD and peeped it. And if you dreamin you achivin, after that it was a wrap. And now I walk in the club like a million times,. Spit on the mic like a million rhymes,. We party rock to a billion drops and this shot makes one zillion shots. Yes I'm feelin' good, and we the best I'm feelin' good. And in your breast I'm feelin' good, haha lmfao. Ima bro with this party thang. I love ?? and bacardi mang. Hey, I've been the same ??. You and I and the crew that I roll with,.

Everyday I see my, everyday I see my dream. everyday I see my dream. Every time I dive in my pool. It's hard to be humble. When I do the breaststroke through an underground tunnel. And come up on the other side in a Jacuzzi. Being greeted by two naked models. with suds on their booties. They give me hugs and lots of kisses. And they ask me what my wish is. I say go and call your bitches. cause there's gonna be a party. Then they wash my body as a team. And they say ""Foo, your royal penis is clean! "". And I'm like. [chorus]. Yes, it's on and poppin'.

Grandma's cooking breakfast. she makes pancakes It's best. I check my MySpace and I've got a lot of friend requests. Yes. I get to dancing as I. Walk through my mansion 'cause I. Own property from the California to Hamptons and I. Sip from my water fountain that spits soda. Look out the window. and wave at my next door neighbor Oprah. I check to see how my album's doing today. The group LMFAO goes double platinum HEY!. I got a party, man. That's how I live. So I take an elevator to the club in my crib. [chorus x4]. Every day I see my dream. Every day I see my-every day I see my dream. Every day I see my dream. Ev-ev-every day I see my dream. Every day I see my every day I see my dream. [repeat]"
