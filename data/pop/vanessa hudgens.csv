when there was me and you,"It's funny when you find yourself. Looking from the outside. I'm standing here but all I want. Is to be over there. Why did I let myself believe. Miracles could happen. Cause now I have to pretend. That I don't really care. I thought you were my fairytale. A dream when I'm not sleeping. A wish upon a star. Thats coming true. But everybody else could tell. That I confused my feelings. With the truth. When there was me and you. I swore I knew the melody. That I heard you singing. And when you smiled. You made me feel. Like I could sing along. But then you went and changed the words. Now my heart is empty. I'm only left with ""used-to-be's"". Once upon a song. Now I know you're not a fairytale. And dreams were meant for sleeping. And wishes on a star. Just don't come true. Cause now even I can tell. That I confused my feelings. With the truth. Because I liked the view. When there was me and you. I can't believe that. I could be so blind. It's like you were floating. While I was falling. And I didn't mind. Because I liked the view. I thought you felt it too. When there was me and you"

the christmas songs,"Chestnust roasting on an open fire. Jack frost nipping at your nose. Yultide carols being sung by a choir. And folks dressed up like eskimos. Everyboby knows. The turkey and some mistle toe. Help to make the season bright. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow. Will find it hard to sleep tonight. They know that santa is on his way. Hes loaded lots of toys and goodies on his slaigh. And every mothers child is going to spy. Tosee if rainders really know how to fly. And so, im offering this simple phrase. To kids from one to ninety-two. Although its been said, many times many ways. Merry christmas to you"

I thought I had control. But we kissed, and I slipped and I don't know where to go. All I really know is getting too emotional. When you came to me. Yeah, I thought you'd be like every other guy that I'd ever met. We'd hang for a while then I'd soon forget you. But this is something new.

They say I talk too much. I talk too much about you. The definition of being out of control and I don't wanna feel this anymore. I thought I had control (I think). But I slipped, and I don't, and I don't know where to go. I thought I knew it all (knew it all). But all I do is think about the next time I'll see you. I thought I had control.

whatever will be,"Sometimes I feel like I'm a bird with broken wings. At times I dread my now and envy where I've been. But that's when quiet wisdom takes control. At least I've got a story no one's told. [Chorus]. I finally learned to say. Whatever will be will be. I've learned to take. The good, the bad and breathe. 'Cause although we like. To know what life's got planned. No one knows if shooting stars will land. These days it feels naive to put your faith in hope. To imitate a child, fall backwards on the snow. 'Cause that's when fears will usually lead you blind. But now I try to under-analyse. [Chorus]. Is the rope I walk wearing thin?. Is the life I love caving in?. Is the weight on your mind. A heavy black bird caged inside?. Say. Whatever will be will be. Take. The good, the bad. Just breathe. 'Cause although we like. To know what life's got planned. No one knows if shooting stars will land. Whatever will be will be. and I have learned to take. The good, the bad and breathe. 'Cause although we like. To know what life's got planned. Things like that are never in your hands. No one knows if shooting stars will land"
when there was me and you,"It's funny when you find yourself. Looking from the outside. I'm standing here but all I want. Is to be over there. Why did I let myself believe. Miracles could happen. Cause now I have to pretend. That I don't really care. I thought you were my fairytale. A dream when I'm not sleeping. A wish upon a star. Thats coming true. But everybody else could tell. That I confused my feelings. With the truth. When there was me and you. I swore I knew the melody. That I heard you singing. And when you smiled. You made me feel. Like I could sing along. But then you went and changed the words. Now my heart is empty. I'm only left with ""used-to-be's"". Once upon a song. Now I know you're not a fairytale. And dreams were meant for sleeping. And wishes on a star. Just don't come true. Cause now even I can tell. That I confused my feelings. With the truth. Because I liked the view. When there was me and you. I can't believe that. I could be so blind. It's like you were floating. While I was falling. And I didn't mind. Because I liked the view. I thought you felt it too. When there was me and you"

He'll say are you married?. We'll say No man. But you can do the job. When you're in town. Later on, we'll conspire. As we dream, by the fire. To face unafraid. The plans that we've made. Walking. In a winter wonderland. In the meadow. We can build a snowman. And pretend. That he's a circus clown. We'll have lots of fun. With Mr. Snowman. Until the other kids. Come knock him down. When it's cold. Ain't it thrilling. When your nose. Gets to chilling. We'll frolic and play. The eskimo way. Walking. In a winter wonderland. Walking. In a winter wonderland"
