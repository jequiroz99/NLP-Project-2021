I'm going through with being too cold to move. Sunshine is overdue. I'm breaking out in my summer dress, yea!. I'm singing, I'm dancing, I'm obsessed, yea!. This is my paradise. I'm at home above all I got it by. Let the sun on my shoulder shine!. We can run beneath this clear piece of sky. This is my paradise!. Breaking the waves out on the sand. And I still hear that band.

I'm at home above all I got it by. Let the sun on my shoulder shine. We can run this clear piece of sky. This is my Paradise!"

As I sing my song.... We've got mistletoe... and firelight. On this cold december night. The snow outside will set the moon. As I sing my song.... Sing my song for you.

And you start to burn again in my brain. I'm falling for you. I'm falling. I can't forget you. Now it's cold. And all of the leaves on all of the trees are falling. With me down to the ground. And I'm falling for you. You're like a good book snuggled up on the sofa. When its raining outside but im warm. Cause I feel you around. But you're so out of town. I kinda wanna call, but I bet you're busy with that fancy new job. And the fall wont affect you like how it makes me feel now. October is so overwhelming,. And all of my friends tell me novemember should get better,. But I still see you all over the place. I'm falling for you. I'm falling. I can't forget you. Now it's cold. And all of the leaves on all of the trees are falling. With me down to the ground. And I'm falling for you. Oh you are, like sunshine. With a chance of rain,. I love the cool crisp air and. I dont care if youre near. Cause I feel you like youre here. You're everywhere. I'm falling for you. I'm falling. I can't forget you. Now it's cold. And all of the leaves on all of the trees are falling. With me down to the ground. And I'm falling for you"
this is my paradise,"There's a street, there's my right, my left feet. There's a road of nowhere that ends meet. I've got the sun, I've got the sand. I've got that rock 'n' roll band. Here I stand!. I've told that when the morning comes. I'll be there my left hand in your right one. Ooooo!. This is my paradise. I'm at home above all I got it by. Let the sun on my shoulder shine!. We can run beneath this clear piece of sky. This is my paradise!. Lemonade, summer games we remember. Colder days with a haze in December. Let's get some groove. I'm going through with being too cold to move. Sunshine is overdue. I'm breaking out in my summer dress, yea!. I'm singing, I'm dancing, I'm obsessed, yea!. This is my paradise. I'm at home above all I got it by. Let the sun on my shoulder shine!. We can run beneath this clear piece of sky. This is my paradise!. Breaking the waves out on the sand. And I still hear that band.

She would talk about her York and how she's the best. And how all of her exes could flex and have pecks. So I started to drink so I wouldn't get pissed. Because if I got drunk I'd be shallowing into it. No doubt I got no game. My friends, they are the same. Undateable. You can't lose if you never try. That's why me and you. We're undateable for life.

we're dancing,"When you take my hand. Your face is all I see. And all the walls they go black. Like a movie scene. My feet start to move. What you do to the stinolium. It's like the perfect dance floor. Put your hands by my waist. I hear the violins. And one step is all it takes. And then my head spins. I don't see the walls at all. Since the minutes we stepped away from this place. We're dancing and then the world dissappears. We're dancing to music no one else hears. It's magic, it's like we're stopping time. When your heart beats mine. When we're dancing, dancing, dancing. When we're dancing, dancing, dancing. When we're dancing. World is soft like a blur. All I see is color. Hardest fall, so it hurts, when we're with each other. You're a sweet song bird when you're singing in my ear. Goosebumps run down my skin. We're dancing and then the world dissappears. We're dancing to music no one else hears. It's magic, it's like we're stopping time. When your heart beats mine. When we're dancing, dancing, dancing. When we're dancing, dancing, dancing. When we're dancing. I think that we could live for moments like this. The sweetest romances, feels like there's all this magic. And we just got to grab it, when we're dancing. We're dancing and then the world dissappears. We're dancing to music no one else hears. It's magic, it's like we're stopping time. When your heart beats mine. When we're dancing. We're dancing and then the world dissappears. We're dancing to music no one else hears. It's magic, it's like we're stopping time. When your heart beats mine. When we're dancing.

when she loved me,"When somebody loved me,. Everything was beautiful. Every hour we spent together lives within my heart. And when she was sad,. I was there to dry her tears. And when she was happy,. So was I. When she loved me. Through the summer and the fall. We had each other, that was all. Just she and I together,. Like it was meant to be. And when she was lonely,. I was there to comfort her. And I knew that she loved me. So the years went by. I stayed the same. But she began to drift away. I was left alone. Still I waited for the day. When she'd say I will always love you. Lonely and forgotten,. I'd never thought she'd look my way. And she smiled at me and held me just like she used to do. When somebody loved me. Everything was beautiful. Every hour we spent together lives within my heart. When she loved me. Like she loved me. When she loved me. When she loved me..."
