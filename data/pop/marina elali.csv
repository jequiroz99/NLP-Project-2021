one last cry,My shattered dreams and broken heart. Are mending on the shelf. I saw you holding hands. Standing close to someone else. Now I sit all alone. Wishing all my feeling was gone. I gave my best to you. Nothing for me to do. But have one last cry. One last cry. Before I leave it all behind. I've gotta put you out of my mind this time. Stop living a lie. I guess I'm down to my last cry. I was here you were there. Guess we never could agree. While the sun shines on you. I need some love to rain on me. Still I sit all alone. Wishing all my feeling was gone. Gotta get over you. Nothing for me to do. But have one last cry. One last cry. Before I leave it all behind. I've gotta put you out of my mind this time. Stop living a lie. I know I've gotta be strong. 'Cause all my life goes on and on and on... and on. But I've one last cry. One last cry. Before I leave it all behind. I've gotta put you out of my mind for the very last time. Been living a lie. I guess I'm down. I guess I'm down. I guess I'm down. To my last cry

lost inside your heart (feat. jon secada),"I'm lost inside your heart. But you couldn't even find me. Where you hardly ever go. That's what I've come to know. I'm lost inside your heart. I'm lost inside your heart. I'm sheltered by a feeling. And what no one else can see. That's what you gave to me. I'm lost inside your heart. And here I'll stay until forever said and done. My dream came true the day I met you. (You're everything to me). Our love is all that I believe in. No matter where you are. Oh no. Close your eyes. And I'll be there somewhere. Lost inside your heart. Nothing else matters my love. I don't care, don't you worry about tomorrow. When it gets dark. I'll follow your star. Na na na na na na na. Na na na na na. Our love is all that I believe in. And here I'll stay until forever said and done. I'll stay, baby. My dream came true the day I met you. (You're everything to me). Our love is all that I believe in. No matter where you are. Close your eyes. and I'll be there somewhere. Lost inside your heart. Lost inside your heart"
all she wants (o xote das meninas),"Cause all she wants. Is go out with the boys. That's all she wants.... Early in the morning. She is all made up. Her days are full of daydreams. And nights are full of sighs. Her daddy says, my daughter. I want to understand you. I guess we need a doctor to. Find the reason why. I'm sorry, sir. But I can't help you. Cause you're to blind to see. Your daughter's come of age. There ain't no remedy. Don't try to understand. Right now what you should do. Is set her free to live"
happy,"Someone once told me. That you have to choose. What you win or lose. You can't have everything. Don't you take chances. You might feel the pain. Don't you love in vain. Cause love wont set you free. I could stand by the side. And watch this life pass me by. So unhappy but safe as could be. So what if it hurts me. So what if I break down. So what if this world just throws me off the edge. My feet run out of ground. I gotta find my place. I wanna hear my sound. Don't care about other pain in front of me. Cause I'm just try be happy, yeah. Just wanna be happy, yeah. Holding on tightly. Just can't let it go. Just tryna play my role. Slowly disappear, oooh. Well all these tears. They feel like they're the same. Just different faces, different names. Get me outta here. Well I can stand by the side. And watch this life pass me by. Pass me by. So what if it hurts me. So what if i break down. So what if this world just throws me off the edge. My feet run out of ground. I gotta find my place. I wanna hear my sound. Don't care about other pain in front of me. Cause I'm just try be happy. Just wanna be happy. Oooh. So any turns that i cant see. I'll count a stranger on this road. But don't say victim. Don't say anything. So what if it hurts me. So what if i break down. So what if this world just throws me off the edge. My feet run out of ground. I gotta find my place. I wanna hear my sound. Don't care about all the pain in front of me.

halo,"Remember those walls I built. Well baby they're tumbling down. And they didn't even put up a fight. They didn't even make a sound. I found a way to let you in. But I never really had a doubt. Standing in the light of your halo. I got my angel now. It's like I've been awakened. Every rule I had you breaking. It's the risk that I'm taking. I ain't never gonna shut you out. Everywhere I'm looking now. I'm surrounded by your embrace. Baby I can see your halo. You know you're my saving grace. You're everything I need and more. It's written all over your face. Baby I can feel your halo. Pray it won't fade away. I can feel your halo, halo, halo. Can see your halo, halo, halo. Can feel your halo, halo, halo. Can see your halo, halo, halo. Hit me like a ray of sun. Burning through my darkest night. You're the only one that I want. Think I'm addicted to your light. I swore I'd never fall again. But this don't even feel like falling. Gravity can't forget. To pull me back to the ground again. Feels like I've been awakened. Every rule I had you breaking. It's the risk that I'm taking. I'm never gonna shut you out. Everywhere I'm looking now. I'm surrounded by your embrace. Baby I can see your halo. You know you're my saving grace. You're everything I need and more. It's written all over your face.

without you,"No I can't forget this evening. And your face as you were leaving. But I guess that's just the way the story goes. You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows. Yes it shows. No I can't forget tomorrow. When I think of all my sorrow. When I had you there but then I let you go. And now it's only fair that I should let you know. What you should know. I can't live if living is without you. I can't live, I can't give anymore. I can't live if living is without you. I can't give, I can't give anymore. Well I can't forget this evening.
