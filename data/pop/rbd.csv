gone,"What you see's not what you get. With you there's just no measurement. No way to tell what's real from what isn't there. Your eyes they sparkled. That's all changed into lies that drop like acid rain. You washed away the best of me. You don't care. You know you did it. I'm gone. To find someone to live for in this world. There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight. Just a bridge that I gotta burn. You are wrong. If you think you can walk right through my door. That is just so you. Coming back when I've finally moved on. I'm already gone. Sometimes shattered. Never open. Nothing matters. When you're broken. That was me whenever I was with you. Always ending, always over. Back and forth, up and down, like a roller coaster. I am breaking that habit today. You know you did it. There is nothing you can say. Sorry doesn't cut it babe. Take the hit and walk away. Cause I'm gone. Doesn't matter what you do. It's what you did that's hurting you. All I needed was the truth. Now I'm gone. What you see's not what you get. . By: Gabriel matos (:"
