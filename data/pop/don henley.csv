the boys of summer,"Nobody on the road. Nobody on the beach. I feel it in the air, the summer's out of reach. Empty lake, empty streets. The sun goes down alone. I'm drivin' by your house. Though I know you're not home. But I can see you. Your brown skin shinin' in the sun. You got your hair combed back. And your sunglasses on, baby. And I can tell you my love for you. Will still be strong after the boys of summer have gone. I never will forget those nights. I wonder if it was a dream. Remember how you made me crazy?. Remember how I made you scream?. Now I don't understand what's happened to our love. But baby when I get you back. I'm gonna show you what I'm made of. I can see you. Your brown skin shinin' in the sun. I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone. I can tell you my love for you will still be strong. After the boys of summer have gone. Out on the road. Today I saw a deadhead sticker. On a Cadillac. A little voice inside my head said:. ""Don't look back. You can never look back."". I thought I knew what love was,. What did I know?. Those days are gone forever. I should just let them go but. I can see you. Your brown skin shinin' in the sun. You got that top pulled down and that radio on baby. And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong. After the boys of summer have gone. I can see you. Your brown skin shining in the sun. You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby. I can tell you my love for you will still be strong. After the boys of summer have gone"
talking to the moon,"When the hot September sun down in Texas. Sucked the streams bone dry. Turned to roads to dust. In the sleepy little towns down in Texas,. the shades are all pulled down;. the streets are all rolled up.. And the only thing that breaks the silence. Are the trucks a-passin' by. Late at night on the front porch swing. You can hear their mournful sigh. And the lonesome weeping willow cries to the stars above. He was callin' out for his lady love. She's been gone so long. I was just talkin' to the moon. Hopin' someday soon that I'd be over. The memory of you-too hard to hold. And the wind across the plains. Is all that now remains. And the night shakes loose the names. But they never quite go back the way they came. So, good-bye rodeo. It's a long, funny way for men to go. Never change. Never change at all. I was just talkin' to the moon. Hopin' someday soon that I'd be over. The memory of you- too hard to hold on. I was just talkin' to the moon. Hopin' someday soon that I'd be over the. Memory of you."
if dirt were dollars,"Walkin' like a millionaire. Smilin' like a king. He leaned his shopping cart against the wall. He said, ""I been a lot of places. And I seen a lot of things. But, sonny, I seen one thing that beats 'em all. I was flyin' back from Lubbock. I saw Jesus on the plane. ...or maybe it was Elvis. You know, they kinda look the same. Hey, look out, Junior, you're steppin' on my bed"". I said, ""I don't see nothin"". He just glared at me and said,. If dirt were dollars. If dirt were dollars. If dirt were dollars. I wouldn't worry anymore. Lookin' like a beauty queen. Loyal as a wife. She raised her little voice and testified,. ""I am a good girl. I've been one all my life"". But her virtue was as swollen as her pride. She should've had the Oscar. She must have been miscast. Her fifteen minutes went by so fast. I said, ""Now, baby, have you got no shame?"". She just looked at me, uncomprehendingly. Like cows at a passing train. If dirt were dollars. If dirt were dollars. If dirt were dollars. I wouldn't worry anymore. We got the bully pulpit. And the poisoned pen. We got a press no better. Than the public men. This brave new world. Gone bad again. God's finest little creatures. Looking brave and strong. Whistling past the graveyard. Nothing can go wrong. Quoting from the scriptures. With patriotic tears. We got the same old men. With the same old fears. Standing at attention. Wrapped in stars and stripes. They hear the phantom drummers. And the nonexistent pipes. These days the buck stops nowhere. No one takes the blame. But evil is still evil. In anybody's name. If dirt were dollars. If dirt were dollars. If dirt were dollars. We'd all be in the black."
annabel,"(Don Henley/John Corey). I watch you sleeping. My weary heart rises up on wings. I hear your laughter. Something deep down inside me sings. Way down here in the land of cotton. You were born on a rainy day. Since then, sweet things long forgotten. They just keep flooding back my way. Oh child, I cannot tell you how the time just flies. But I have had my days of glory under sunny skies. These days, your bright dreams are all I want to see. Sleep tight, Annabel. You can always count on me. In this cold world, folks will judge you. Though they don't know you at all. And I may not be there to catch you. Anytime that you might fall. But, you got my hard head. And your mother's grace. All the likeness of the loved ones right there in your face. And I know in the end you'll be who you will be. So sleep tight, Annabel. You can always count on me."
building the perfect beast,"The power of reason, the top of the heap. We're the ones who can kill the things we. don't eat. Sharper than a serpent's tongue. Tighter than a bongo drum. Quicker than a one-night stand. Slicker than a mambo band. And now the day is come. Soon he will be released. Glory hallelujah!. We're building the Perfect Beast. (building, building, etc..). It's Olympus this time- Olympus or bust. For we have met the enemy -and he is us. And now the day is come. Soon he will be released. Glory hallelujah!. We're building the Perfect Beast. (Building, Building). Ever since we crawled out of the ocean. and stood upright on the land. There are some things that we just don't. understand:. Relieve all pain and suffering. and lift us out of the dark. Turn us all into Methuselah-. But where are we gonna park?. (Building, Building). The secrets of eternity-. We've found the lock and turned the key. We're shakin' up those building blocks. Going deeper into that box- (Pandora. wouldn't like it). And now the day is come. Soon he will be released. Glory hallelujah!. We're building the Perfect Beast. (building, building). All the way to Malibu from the Land of the. Talking Drum-. Just look how far-look how far we've come."
a month of sundays,"I used to work for Harvester. I used to use my hands. I used to make the tractors and the. combines that plowed and harvested this. great land.

Banks back then was lendin' money. The banker was the farmer's friend. And I've seen dog days and dusty days;. Late spring snow and early fall sleet;.

That was all I ever knew. Now, it all comes down to numbers. Now I'm glad that I have quit. Folks these days just don't do nothin'. simply for the love of it. I went into town of the Fourth of July. Watched 'em parade past the Union Jack. Watched 'em break out the brass and beat. on the drum. One step forward and two steps back. And I saw a sign on Easy Street,. said ""Be Prepared to Stop."". Pray for the Independent , little man. I don't see next year's crop. And I sit here on the back porch in the. twilight. And I hear the crickets hum. I sit and watch the lightning in the distance. but the showers never come. I sit here and listen to the wind blow. I sit here and rub my hands. I it here and listen to the clock strike,. and I wonder when I'll see my. companion again."
the end of the innocence,"Remember when the days were long. And rolled beneath a deep blue sky. Didn't have a care in the world. With mommy and daddy standin' by. But ""happily ever after"" fails. And we've been posisoned by these fairy tales. The lawyers dwell on small details. Since daddy had to fly. But I know a place where we can go. That's still untouched by men. We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by. And the tall grass waves in the wind. You can lay your head back on the ground. And let your hair fall all around me. Offer up your best defense. But this is the end. This is the end of the innocence. O' beautiful, for spacious skies. But now those skies are threatening. They're beating plowshares into swords. For this tired old man that we elected king. Armchair warriors often fail. And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales. The lawyers clean up all details. Since daddy had to lie. But I know a place where we can go. And wash away this sin. We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by. And the tall grass waves in the wind. Just lay your head back on the ground. And let your hair spill all around me. Offer up your best defense. But this is the end. This is the end of the innocence. Who knows how long this will last. Now we've come so far, so fast. But, somewhere back there in the dust. That same small town in each of us. I need to remember this. So baby give me just one kiss. And let me take a long last look. Before we say goodbye. Just lay your head back on the ground. And let your hair fall all around me. Offer up your best defense. But this is the end. This is the end of the innocence"
where i am now,"I've done some foolish things. I've been downright stupid. I've been a sucker for a pretty face. Lord, I was poltuted. When people say, ""Would you go back? "". I say, ""No way, nohow''. Because I like where I am now. I took it hard when I found out. That life just isn't fair. I used to bellyache and moan. But now I just don't care. I'm making one last victory lap and then I'll take a bow. Because I like where I am now. Where I am now. Father Time is a friend. I feel at home. In my own skin. There ain't no limit to the havoc he can wreak. When a young man slips into his self·destructive streak. I been east, west, north and south. But I made it through somehow. And I like where I am now. You know, I like where I am now. I said, I like where I am now"

We'll be happy together, unhappy together. Now won't that be just fine. The days may be cloudy or sunny. We're in or out of the money. But I'm with you always. I'm with you rain or shine."

"damn it, rose","(Don Henley/Stan Lynch). Maybe just a good night's sleep. Would have changed your troubled mind. From that rather permanent decision. So tragic, so unkind. Now, pain is what you've given. And sleep is what you'll get. So far away from that sweet baby child. Who hardly knew you yet. Now he'll grow up to be a fighter. Full of anger, full of shame. Like all the other haunted children. Who wonder why they came. And he'll be in and out of trouble. Until he stands up or he falls. But there will always be a shadow there. No matter how it goes. Damn it, Rose. Is this another cryptic message. Or some kind of cosmic quiz. If there's a lesson to be learned from this. Well, I don't know what it is. You could have given us the finger. Much more constructively than that. Now I sit here with the MTV. And your bloated, Burmese cat. We're being treated to the wisdom. Of some puffed up little fart. Doing exactly what I used to doâ€”. Pretentions to anarchy and art. He speaks the language of a warrior. He mounts his misinformed attack. He wears the clothes of a dissenter. But there's a logo on his back. And it's a hollow rebellion. As rebellions mostly are. It's just another raging tempest in a jar. And the seasons keep on changing. And the wind blows hot and cold. Wish that you were here with us to watch this tide. As it ebbs and flows. Damn it, Rose."
for my wedding,"(Larry John McNally). For my wedding, I will dress in black. And never again will I look back. Ah, my dark angels we must part. For I've made a sanctuary of my heart. To want what I have. To take what I'm given with grace. For this I pray. On my wedding day. For my wedding, I don't want violins. Or sentimental songs about thick and thin. I want a moment of silence and a moment of prayer. For the love we'll need to make it in the world out there. To want what I have. To take what I'm given with grace. For this I pray. On my wedding day. On my wedding day. I dream, and my dreams are all glory and light. That's what I've wanted for my life. And if it hasn't always been that way. Well, I can dream and I can pray. On my wedding day. So what makes us any different from all the others. Who have tried and failed before us. Maybe nothing, maybe nothing at all. But I pray we're the lucky ones; I pray we never fall. To want what we have. To take what we're given with grace. For these things I pray. On my wedding day. On my wedding day."

the garden of allah,"It was pretty big year for fashion. a lousy year for rock and roll. The people gave their blessing to crimes of passion. It was a dark, dark night of the collective soul. and I was somewhere out on Riverside by the El Royale Hotel. When a stranger appeared in a cloud of smoke. I thought I knew him all too well. He said now that I have your attention. I got something I wanna say. You may not wanna hear it, I'm gonna tell it to you anyway. You know I've always like you boy. Cause you were not afraid of me. Things are gonna get mighty rough here in Gomorrah-by-the-Sea. Ya said it's just like home. It's so damn hot I can't stand it. My fine seersucker suit is all soaking wet. And the hills are burning. and the wind is raging. and the clock strikes midnight in the Garden of Allah. In the Garden of Allah. Nice car. Ah, I love those Bavarians. so meticulous. Y'know I remember when things were a lot more fun around here. When good was good and evil was evil. Before things got so fuzzy. I was once a golden boy like you. And I was summoned to the halls of power in the heavenly courts. And I dined with the deities who looked upon me with favor,. for my talents, my creativity. and we sat beneath the palms. in the warm afternoons and drank the wine. With Fitzgerald and Huxley. and they pawned the biting phrase from the tongues hot with blood. and drained their pins of bitter ink. Vainly reaching for the bottle full of empty Edens. Branded especially for the ones who had come with great expectations. to the perfumed halls of Allah, for their time in the sun. And we were stokin' the fires and oilin' up the machinery. Until the Gods found out we had ideas of our own. And war was coming and the Earth was shaking. and there was no more ruin in the Garden of Allah. Today I made an appearance downtown. I am an expert witness because I say I am. And I said gentlemen, and I use that world loosely. I will testify for you, I'm a gun for hire,I'm a saint, I'm a liar. Because there are no facts, there is no truth. Just data to be manipulated. I can get you any result you like. What's it worth to you?. Because there is no wrong, there is no right. And I sleep very well at night. No shame, no solution, no remorse, no retribution. Just people selling t-shirts. Just opportunity to participate in the pathetic little circus. and winning, winning, winning. It was pretty big year for predators. The marketplace was on a roll. and the land of opportunity. spawned a whole new breed of men without souls. This year notoriety got all confused with fame. and the devil is downhearted babe, cause. there's nothing left for him to claim. He said it's just like home. It's so low-down I can't stand it. I guess my work around here has all been done. And the fruit is rotten, the serpent's eyes shine. as he wraps around the vine,. in the Garden of Allah. in the Garden of Allah. in the Garden of Allah."

As we taxied down the runway. I could hear the people shout. They said, ""Don't come back here Yankee!"". But if I ever do-. I'll bring more money. 'Cause all she wants to do is dance. and make romance. Never mind the hear comin' off the street. She wants to party (oooo). She wants to get down (oooo). All she wants to do is-. All she wants to do is dance. All she wants to do is dance. and make romance. All she wants to do is dance."
annabel,"(Don Henley/John Corey). I watch you sleeping. My weary heart rises up on wings. I hear your laughter. Something deep down inside me sings. Way down here in the land of cotton. You were born on a rainy day. Since then, sweet things long forgotten. They just keep flooding back my way. Oh child, I cannot tell you how the time just flies. But I have had my days of glory under sunny skies. These days, your bright dreams are all I want to see. Sleep tight, Annabel. You can always count on me. In this cold world, folks will judge you. Though they don't know you at all. And I may not be there to catch you. Anytime that you might fall. But, you got my hard head. And your mother's grace. All the likeness of the loved ones right there in your face. And I know in the end you'll be who you will be. So sleep tight, Annabel. You can always count on me."
building the perfect beast,"The power of reason, the top of the heap. We're the ones who can kill the things we. don't eat. Sharper than a serpent's tongue. Tighter than a bongo drum. Quicker than a one-night stand. Slicker than a mambo band. And now the day is come. Soon he will be released. Glory hallelujah!. We're building the Perfect Beast. (building, building, etc..). It's Olympus this time- Olympus or bust. For we have met the enemy -and he is us. And now the day is come. Soon he will be released. Glory hallelujah!. We're building the Perfect Beast. (Building, Building). Ever since we crawled out of the ocean. and stood upright on the land. There are some things that we just don't. understand:. Relieve all pain and suffering. and lift us out of the dark. Turn us all into Methuselah-. But where are we gonna park?. (Building, Building). The secrets of eternity-. We've found the lock and turned the key. We're shakin' up those building blocks. Going deeper into that box- (Pandora. wouldn't like it). And now the day is come. Soon he will be released. Glory hallelujah!. We're building the Perfect Beast. (building, building). All the way to Malibu from the Land of the. Talking Drum-. Just look how far-look how far we've come."
come rain or come shine,"I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you. Come rain or come shine. High as a mountain, deep as a river. Come rain or come shine. I guess when you met me. It was just one of those things. But don't you ever bet me. 'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me. You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me. Come rain or come shine. We'll be happy together, unhappy together. Now won't that be just fine. The days may be cloudy or sunny. We're in or out of the money. But I'm with you always. I'm with you rain or shine."
"damn it, rose","(Don Henley/Stan Lynch). Maybe just a good night's sleep. Would have changed your troubled mind. From that rather permanent decision. So tragic, so unkind. Now, pain is what you've given. And sleep is what you'll get. So far away from that sweet baby child. Who hardly knew you yet. Now he'll grow up to be a fighter. Full of anger, full of shame. Like all the other haunted children. Who wonder why they came. And he'll be in and out of trouble. Until he stands up or he falls. But there will always be a shadow there. No matter how it goes. Damn it, Rose. Is this another cryptic message. Or some kind of cosmic quiz. If there's a lesson to be learned from this. Well, I don't know what it is. You could have given us the finger. Much more constructively than that. Now I sit here with the MTV. And your bloated, Burmese cat. We're being treated to the wisdom. Of some puffed up little fart. Doing exactly what I used to doâ€”. Pretentions to anarchy and art. He speaks the language of a warrior. He mounts his misinformed attack. He wears the clothes of a dissenter. But there's a logo on his back. And it's a hollow rebellion. As rebellions mostly are. It's just another raging tempest in a jar. And the seasons keep on changing. And the wind blows hot and cold. Wish that you were here with us to watch this tide. As it ebbs and flows. Damn it, Rose."

drivin' with your eyes closed,"I met a Frenchman in a field last night. He was out there with an easel,. painting carnival light. He said, ""I used to paint the princess;. I used to paint the frogs. Now I paint mustaches on dangerous dogs"". He said, ""Sometimes it's a country;. sometimes it's a girl. You, everybody got to have a purpose. in this world. You Yankees are so silly about matters of. the heart. Don't you know that women are the only. works of art. You're drivin' with your eyes closed. You're drivin' with your eyes closed. You're drivin' with your eyes closed. You're gonna hit somethin'. But that's the way it goes"". Some guys were born to Rimbaud. Some guys breathe Baudelaire. Some guys just got to go and put. their rockets everywhere. You can breed 'em by the thousands;. you can trick and you can train. Just look at all those poor dogs that are. dragged down bu the Seine. How many arrows must I shoot into the. blue?. Ah, you little maniac, I'm crazy over you. Before The Dearth of Lovers and. The Punishment of Pride. Let's go scrape out on the terrazzo. It's just to hot outside. ""You're drivin' with your eyes closed. You're drivin' with your eyes closed. You're drivin' with your eyes closed. You're gonna hit somethin'. But that's the way it goes"". Talk talk, talk and talk. Talk talk, sweet talk. Talk talk, tough talk. Talk talk, dirty talk. Talk talk, walk and talk. Talk talk, big talk. Kiss kiss, kiss. Talk talk, talk and talk.

everybody knows,"Everybody knows that the dice are loaded. everybody rolls with their fingers crossed. everybody knows the war is over. and everybody knows the good guys lost. everybody knows the fight was fixed. the poor stay poor and the rich get rich. that's how it goes. and everybody knows. Everybody knows that the boat is leaking. everybody knows the captain lied. everybody got this broken feeling. that their father or their dog just died. everybody talkin' to their pockets. everybody wants a box of chocolates. and a long stem rose. and everybody knows.

everything is different now,"(Don Henley/Scott F. Crago/Timothy Drury). I hate to tell you this, but I'm very, very happy. And I know that's not what you'd expect from me at all. I'm not the kind to smile and bow out gracefully. I always wanted to take it to the wall. But I found somebody with a heart as big as Texas. I found an angel with the golden wings. She saw me down here in the dark somehow. And everything is different now. Yeah, I miss the old crowd sometimes. And the wild, wild nights of running. You know, a starving soul can't live like that for long. You go around in circles that just keep getting smaller. You wake up one morning and half your life is gone. I got so tired of that; I got so lonely. I dropped down and I called out to heaven. â€œSend me someone to love.â€. And heaven shot back, â€œYou get the love that you allow.â€. And everything is different now. Oh, and it's sweet to know. The wisdom that living brings. Since I got a telegram from the god of simple things. She said, â€œI don't care what you do for a living.â€. She said, â€œI don't care what kind of car you drive.â€. â€œAll I want to know right now is what do you believe in. And what it means to you to be alive. Will you stand here in this fire with me?. Are you ready for another life?â€. So I bit that bullet and I took that vow. And everything is different now. Everything is different now."
for my wedding,"(Larry John McNally). For my wedding, I will dress in black. And never again will I look back. Ah, my dark angels we must part. For I've made a sanctuary of my heart. To want what I have. To take what I'm given with grace. For this I pray. On my wedding day. For my wedding, I don't want violins. Or sentimental songs about thick and thin. I want a moment of silence and a moment of prayer. For the love we'll need to make it in the world out there. To want what I have. To take what I'm given with grace. For this I pray. On my wedding day. On my wedding day. I dream, and my dreams are all glory and light. That's what I've wanted for my life. And if it hasn't always been that way. Well, I can dream and I can pray. On my wedding day. So what makes us any different from all the others. Who have tried and failed before us. Maybe nothing, maybe nothing at all. But I pray we're the lucky ones; I pray we never fall. To want what we have. To take what we're given with grace. For these things I pray. On my wedding day. On my wedding day."
gimme what you got,"Baby picks off your plate-yours looks better. And she throws hers on the floor. Here, in the home of the brave. And the land of the free. The first word that baby learns is ""more"". So you're out there floating like a big, puffy cloud. With the pool and the charcoal. and the kids and the wife. 'Til the reruns of your dreams are interrupted. And you step out into life. And it's still gimme, gimme what you got. Gimme, gimme what you got. (I want it, I want it). Gimme, gimme what you got. I said gimme, gimme what you got. (I want it, I want it). Gimme, gimme what you got. Now it's take and take and takeover, takeover. It's all take and never give. All these trumped up towers. They're just golden showers. Where are people supposed to live?. You can arm yourself, alarm yourself. But there's nowhere you can run. 'Cause a man with a briefcase. can steal more money. Than any man with a gun. I said gimme, gimme what you got. Said gimme, gimme what you got. Gimme, gimme what you got. Gimme, gimme what you got. You got the price of admission-. You don't have to ask permission. To take somethin' from another man. You cross a lawyer with the godfather, baby. Make you an offer that you can't understand. From Main Street to Wall Street to Washington. From men to women to men. It's a nation of noses pressed up against the glass. They've seen it on the TV. And they want it pretty fast. You spend your whole life. Just pilin' it up there. You got stack and stacks and stacks. Then, Gabriel comes and taps you on the shoulder. But you don't see no hearses with luggage racks. Gimme, gimme what you got. I said gimme, gimme what you got. I said gimme, gimme what you got. (I want it, I want it). Gimme, gimme what you got."
goodbye to a river,"(Don Henley/Stan Lynch/Jai Winding/Frank Simes). The rains have come early, they say. We're all gonna wash away. Well, that's all right with me. If heaven's torrent can wash clean. The arrogance that lies unseen. In the damage done since we have gone. Where we ought not to be. Goodbye to a river. Goodbye to a river. So long. Lakes and levees, dams and locks. They put that river in a box. It was running wild. And men must have control. We live our lives in starts and fits. We lose our wonder bit by bit. We condescend and in the end. We lose our very souls. Goodbye to a river. Goodbye to a river. So long. The dirty water washes down. Poisoning the common ground. Taking sins of farm and town. And bearing them away. The captains of industry. And their tools on the hill. They're killing everything divine. What will I tell this child of mine. (Solo). I make a church out of words. As the years dull my senses. And I try to hold on to the world that I knew. I struggle to cross generational fences. And the beauty that still remainsâ€”. I can touch it through you. Goodbye to a river. Goodbye to a river. So long. Goodbye to a river. Goodbye to a river. So long. Goodbye to a river. Goodbye to a river. So long. Goodbye to a river. Goodbye to a river. Roll on."
how bad do you want it?,"You're leavin' tongue marks on the carpet. And I know what you're lookin' at. You would walk on your lips through busted glass. If you could get next to that. You think this is love. Your education starts today. So you think this is love?. So tell me. How bad do you want it?. How bad do you want it?. How bad do you want it?. Not bad enough. So you put a hold on happiness. ....a day, a week, a year. You got to bring somethin' to this party, boy. If you party here. And if you're lookin' for love. You better look some other way. If you're lookin' for love. I have to ask you. How bad do you want it?. How bad do you want it?. How bad do you want it?. Not bad enough. She gave you love and affection. Enough to weather any season. You found an excuse to walk away. But you didn't find no reason. And you talk about love. But you don't know what it means. Yeah, you talk about love. So tell me. How bad do you want it?. How bad do you want it?. How bad do you want it?. Not bad enough."
i can't stand still,"I know you love me. You know I love you too. You know I always will. No matter what you do. You say you haven't got another lover. You say you only want to make the scene. Then you try to keep it under cover. What does that mean?. And baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you). I can't stand (while he's kissing you). So we got a little problem, baby:. How to put together love and work. If I could figure out that one, darlin'. I could save us from a world of hurt. I remember when we walked together. Makin' love on a summer night. Guess we thought that it would last forever. We were all right. But baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you). I can't stand still (while he's touching you). I can take it if you need some freedom. Understand it if you miss your friends. Don't you ever try to think of me some. You never tell me where you've been. You say you haven't got another lover. You say you only want to make the scene. Then you try to keep it under cover. What does that mean?. And baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you). I can't stand still (while he's kissing you). And baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you). I can't stand still (while he's touching you). I can't stand still."
i will not go quietly,"Woke up with a heavy head. And I thought about leavin' town. I could have died if I wanted to-. Slipped over the edge and drowned. But, oh no baby, I won't give up so easy. Too many tire tracks in the sands of time. Too many love affairs that stop on a dime. I think it's time to make some changes 'round here. Yeah, I'm gonna tear it up. gonna trash it up. I'm gonna round it up. gonna shake it up. Oh, no, baby, I will not lie down. I'm brave enough to be crazy. I'm strong enough to be weak. I see all these heroes with feet of clay. Whose mighty ships have sprung a leak. And I want you to tell me darlin'. Just what do you believe in now?. Well, c'mon over here baby. You 'bout to gimme a heart attack. I wanna wrap my lovin' arms. Around the small of your back. Yeah, and I'm gonna pull you, pull you, pull you. Pull you right up close to me.

Of all the wicked tongues in this town?. Of, baby, I just wanna take you away from here. I ain't no tiger. I ain't no little lamb. Suppose you tell me mama. Who do you think I think I am?. And ooh baby, don't you give a damn?. Yeah, I'm gonna tear it up. gonna trash it up. gonna round it up. gonna rip it up. I will not lie down.

if dirt were dollars,"Walkin' like a millionaire. Smilin' like a king. He leaned his shopping cart against the wall. He said, ""I been a lot of places. And I seen a lot of things. But, sonny, I seen one thing that beats 'em all. I was flyin' back from Lubbock. I saw Jesus on the plane. ...or maybe it was Elvis. You know, they kinda look the same. Hey, look out, Junior, you're steppin' on my bed"". I said, ""I don't see nothin"". He just glared at me and said,. If dirt were dollars. If dirt were dollars. If dirt were dollars. I wouldn't worry anymore. Lookin' like a beauty queen. Loyal as a wife. She raised her little voice and testified,. ""I am a good girl. I've been one all my life"". But her virtue was as swollen as her pride. She should've had the Oscar. She must have been miscast. Her fifteen minutes went by so fast. I said, ""Now, baby, have you got no shame?"". She just looked at me, uncomprehendingly. Like cows at a passing train. If dirt were dollars. If dirt were dollars. If dirt were dollars. I wouldn't worry anymore. We got the bully pulpit. And the poisoned pen. We got a press no better. Than the public men. This brave new world. Gone bad again. God's finest little creatures. Looking brave and strong. Whistling past the graveyard. Nothing can go wrong. Quoting from the scriptures. With patriotic tears. We got the same old men. With the same old fears. Standing at attention. Wrapped in stars and stripes. They hear the phantom drummers. And the nonexistent pipes. These days the buck stops nowhere. No one takes the blame. But evil is still evil. In anybody's name. If dirt were dollars. If dirt were dollars. If dirt were dollars. We'd all be in the black."
inside job,"(Don Henley/Mike Campbell). While you were sleeping. They came and took it all away. The lanes and the meadows. The places where you used to play. It was an inside job. By the well-connected. Your little protest. Summarily rejected. It was an inside job. Like it always is. Chalk it up to business as usual. While we are dreaming. This little island disappears. While you are looking the other way. They'll take your right to own your own ideas. And it's an inside job. Favors collected. Your trusted servants. Have left you unprotected. It was an inside job. Like it always is. Just chalk it up. To business as usual. You think that you're so smart. But you don't have a fucking clue. What those men up in the towers. Are doing to me and you. And they'll keep doin' it and doin' it. And doin' it and doin' it. And doin' it and doin' it. And doin' it and doin' it. Until we all wake up. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. I know what I've done wrong. I am acquainted with the night. I know how hard it is. To always walk out in the light. And it's an inside job. To learn about forgiving. It's an inside job. To hang on to the joy of living. They know the road by which you came. They know your mother's maiden name. And what you had for breakfast. And what you've hidden in the mattress. Insect politics. Indifferent universe. Bang your head against the wall. But apathy is worse. It's an inside job. It's an inside job. It's an inside job. Yeh, yeah. It's an inside job. It's an inside job. It's an inside job. It's an inside job. It's an inside job. It's an inside job."

little tin god,"""A new age is dawning. On fewer than expected. Business is usual"". That's how the headline read. Some shaky modern saviors. Have now been resurrected. In all this excitement. You may have been misled. People want a miracle. They say ""Oh Lord, can't you see us?. We're tryin' to make a livin' down here. And keep the children fed"". But, from little dark motel rooms. to ""Six Flags Over Jesus"". ""How are the mighty fallen"". So the Bible said. You don't have to pray to a little tin god. Step out of the way for a little tin god. You might fear the reaper, you might fear the rod. But you never have to get down on your knees. You don't have to holler, ""please, please"". No, you never have to get down on your knees. For a little tin god. The cowboy's name was ""Jingo"". And he knew that there was trouble. So in a blaze of glory. He rode out of the west. No one was ever certain. What it was that he was sayin'. But they loved it when he told them. They were better than the rest. But you don't have to pray for a little tin god. Step out of the way for a little tin god. You might hate to system, hate the job. But you never have to get down on your knees. You don't have to holler, ""please, please"". No, you never have to get down on your knees. For a little tin god. Throw down a rope from heaven. And lead the flock to water. The man in the middle would have you think. That you have no other choice. But to wander in the wilderness. Of all the upturned faces. If you stop and listen long enough. You will hear your own small voice. But you don't have to pray to a little tin god. Step out of the way for a little tin god. You might fear the reaper, fear the rod. But you never have to get down on your knees. You don't have to holler, ""please, please"". No, you never have to get down on your knees. You don't have to holler, ""please, please"". You never have to get down on your knees. For a little tin god."
long way home,"Oh It's cold and lonely here in this telephone booth. There's three sides to every story, baby. There's yours and there's mine and the cold, hard truth. I think there's somethin' missin' 'round here I don't know where it's gone. And it's a long way back home. The heat don't work, the toaster don't work, the car don't work. I guess I know why. This house don't work and this dream don't work no more. Lover neither do you and I. I fall asleep with colors flyin'. Over sand and foam. But it's a long way back home. BRIDGE:.

She's in the back seat but you're much too shy. You'd give the world to be an older guy. Love rules, ooo love rules. Love rules, yeah love still rules. Love rules, ooo love rules.

miss ghost,"(Don Henley/Stan Lynch/Jai Winding). On a misbegotten, moonless night. I stumbled in my door. Disgusted with my circumstance. Soaked to every pore. When floating from my bedroom. Came a moaning and a sigh. â€œOh, I've had one too many. It's just the wind,â€ says I. I lit up a cigarette. And I poured a good, stiff drink. You see, I needed to compose myself. I needed time to think. No sooner had I settled down. The moaning came again. Drifting through the silence. Like some otherworldly violin. I bounded up the staircase. I went slippin' and slidin' down the hall. You know, I've been around the whole, wide world. But I was not prepared at all. Uninvited visitor, unsuspecting host. â€œWell, I see you've made yourself at home.. Good evening, Miss Ghost.â€. You're more beautiful than ever. I feel just like a kid. And I commence to trembling. When I think of all the things we did. Skin as pale as marble; lips as red as blood. Imagine my surprise, my dear. I thought that you were gone for good. You look so lovely lying there. All stretched out on your back. But I'm the one who's strung up here. On old temptation's rusty rack. And in the wee small hours. Is when I miss you the most. And I confess it, I have missed you. Miss Ghost. I threw open the window. And I howled at the rain. And I cursed the weakness of the flesh. This breath and boneâ€”and this brute, reptilian brain. What dirty tricks the mind can play. In the lonely dead of night. When you bump into the shadow. Of a faded love that wasn't right. Way down beneath the surface. Far beyond the light of day. So many things lie buried deep. And baby, they should stay that way. Oh, my wicked, little habit. We've really made a mess. Everything's been trivialized. In our vain pursuit of happiness. And even though you've come for me. I won't go back with you. To some temporary heaven. Down some empty, dead-end avenue. But it's been so good to have you here. And I propose a toast. â€œHere's to seeing through youâ€”. Miss Ghost.â€."
my thanksgiving,"(Don Henley/Stan Lynch/Jai Winding). A lot of things have happened. Since the last time we spoke. Some of them are funny. Some of 'em ain't no joke. And I trust you will forgive me. If I lay it on the line. I always thought you were a friend of mine. Sometimes I think about you. I wonder how you're doing now. And what you're going through. The last time I saw you. We were playing with fire. We were loaded with passion. And a burning desire. For every breath, for every day of living. And this is my Thanksgiving. Now the trouble with you and me, my friend. Is the trouble with this nation. Too many blessings, too little appreciation. And I know that kind of notionâ€”well, it just ain't cool. So send me back to Sunday school. Because I'm tired of waiting for reason to arrive. It's too long we've been living. These unexamined lives. I've got great expectations. I've got family and friends. I've got satisfying work. I've got a back that bends. For every breath, for every day of living. This is my Thanksgiving. Have you noticed that an angry man. Can only get so far. Until he reconciles the way he thinks things ought to be. With the way things are. Here in this fragmented world, I still believe. In learning how to give love, and how to receive it. And I would not be among those who abuse this privilege. Sometimes you get the best light from a burning bridge. And I don't mind saying that I still love it all. I wallowed in the springtime. Now I'm welcoming the fall. For every moment of joy. Every hour of fear. For every winding road that brought me here. For every breath, for every day of living. This is my Thanksgiving. For everyone who helped me start. And for everything that broke my heart. For every breath, for every day of living. This is my Thanksgiving."
new york minute,"Harry got up. Dressed all in black. Went down to the station. And he never came back. They found his clothing. Scattered somewhere down the track. And he won't be down on Wall Street. in the morning. He had a home. The love of a girl. But men get lost sometimes. As years unfurl. One day he crossed some line. And he was too much in this world. But I guess it doesn't matter anymore. In a New York Minute. Everything can change. In a New York Minute. Things can get pretty strange. In a New York Minute. Everything can change. In a New York Minute. Lying here in the darkness. I hear the sirens wail. Somebody going to emergency. Somebody's going to jail. If you find somebody to love in this world. You better hang on tooth and nail. The wolf is always at the door. In a New York Minute. Everything can change. In a New York Minute. Things can get a little strange. In a New York Minute. Everything can change. In a New York Minute. And in these days. When darkness falls early. And people rush home. To the ones they love. You better take a fool's advice. And take care of your own. One day they're here;. Next day they're gone. I pulled my coat around my shoulders. And took a walk down through the park. The leaves were falling around me. The groaning city in the gathering dark. On some solitary rock. A desperate lover left his mark,. ""Baby, I've changed. Please come back."". What the head makes cloudy. The heart makes very clear. The days were so much brighter. In the time when she was here. But I know there's somebody somewhere. Make these dark clouds disappear. Until that day, I have to believe. I believe, I believe. In a New York Minute. Everything can change. In a New York Minute. You can get out of the rain. In a New York Minute. Everything can change. In a New York Minute."
"no, thank you","These are hard times we're living in. Nobody cuts you any slack. We got Space Age machinery, Stone Age emotions. Today a man had better watch his back.

No, thank you. I don't think so. l think I'm smellin' a rat. Don't tell me what you 're gonna do for me. 'Cause I've been there done that. Lady Luck's been good to me. I'm as grateful as can be.

Every day I'm getting deeper in a rut. Workin' overtime, now a dollar's worth a dime. And everybody wants a bigger cut. No, thank you. I don't think so. You must think I'm blind as a bat. I sure appreciate what you're tryin' to do for me. But I've been there, done that. B. S. blaring from the radio. the Tv. Hot wind blowin' off The Hill. It's a mystery to me we can't agree to disagree. It's lookin' like we never, ever will. Like a drunkard in the night, swingin' left and swingin' right. Republican or Democrat. Well, I ain't got no love for none of the above. cause I've been there, done that. No, thank you. I don't think so. It's a little too pat. Don't tell me to take it easy.

nobody's business,"I went out in the darkness. Just searching for someplace to be. Wasn't looking for trouble. I guess it was looking for me. And I knew I was wasting my time.

But I knew I was doin' just fine. And it was nobody's business. Nobody's business but mine. Well I guess for some. Revenge is sweet. Though it be once removed. I hope you feel better. I don't know what you proved. Well, yonder comes the Emperor, boys. He sure looks fine in blue. I hope you feel better, babe. I know you're scared too. Well it sure makes you wonder. The things that some people will say. They can see black and white but they. don't seem to notice the gray. What a price for a victimless crime. When it was nobody's business.

sacrifice (with vince gill),"It's a human sign. When things go wrong. When the scent of her lingers. And temptation's strong. Into the boundary. Of each married man. Sweet deceit comes calling. And negativity lands. Cold cold heart. Hard done by you. Some things look better baby. Just passing through. And it's no sacrifice. Just a simple word. It's two hearts living. In two separate worlds.

No tears to damn you. When jealousy burns. Cold, cold heart. Hard done by you. Some things lookin' better, baby. Just passin' through. And it's no sacrifice. Just a simple word. It's two hearts livin'. In two separate world. But, it's no sacrifice. No sacrifice. It's no sacrifice, at all. Cold, cold heart. Hard done by you. Some things lookin' better, baby.

talking to the moon,"When the hot September sun down in Texas. Sucked the streams bone dry. Turned to roads to dust. In the sleepy little towns down in Texas,. the shades are all pulled down;. the streets are all rolled up.. And the only thing that breaks the silence. Are the trucks a-passin' by. Late at night on the front porch swing. You can hear their mournful sigh. And the lonesome weeping willow cries to the stars above. He was callin' out for his lady love. She's been gone so long. I was just talkin' to the moon. Hopin' someday soon that I'd be over. The memory of you-too hard to hold. And the wind across the plains. Is all that now remains. And the night shakes loose the names. But they never quite go back the way they came. So, good-bye rodeo. It's a long, funny way for men to go. Never change. Never change at all. I was just talkin' to the moon. Hopin' someday soon that I'd be over. The memory of you- too hard to hold on. I was just talkin' to the moon. Hopin' someday soon that I'd be over the. Memory of you."

For this tired old man that we elected king. Armchair warriors often fail. And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales. The lawyers clean up all details. Since daddy had to lie. But I know a place where we can go. And wash away this sin. We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by. And the tall grass waves in the wind. Just lay your head back on the ground. And let your hair spill all around me. Offer up your best defense. But this is the end. This is the end of the innocence. Who knows how long this will last. Now we've come so far, so fast. But, somewhere back there in the dust. That same small town in each of us. I need to remember this. So baby give me just one kiss. And let me take a long last look. Before we say goodbye. Just lay your head back on the ground. And let your hair fall all around me. Offer up your best defense. But this is the end. This is the end of the innocence"
the garden of allah,"It was pretty big year for fashion. a lousy year for rock and roll. The people gave their blessing to crimes of passion.

He said now that I have your attention. I got something I wanna say. You may not wanna hear it, I'm gonna tell it to you anyway. You know I've always like you boy. Cause you were not afraid of me. Things are gonna get mighty rough here in Gomorrah-by-the-Sea. Ya said it's just like home. It's so damn hot I can't stand it. My fine seersucker suit is all soaking wet. And the hills are burning. and the wind is raging. and the clock strikes midnight in the Garden of Allah. In the Garden of Allah. Nice car. Ah, I love those Bavarians. so meticulous. Y'know I remember when things were a lot more fun around here. When good was good and evil was evil. Before things got so fuzzy. I was once a golden boy like you. And I was summoned to the halls of power in the heavenly courts. And I dined with the deities who looked upon me with favor,. for my talents, my creativity. and we sat beneath the palms. in the warm afternoons and drank the wine. With Fitzgerald and Huxley. and they pawned the biting phrase from the tongues hot with blood. and drained their pins of bitter ink. Vainly reaching for the bottle full of empty Edens. Branded especially for the ones who had come with great expectations. to the perfumed halls of Allah, for their time in the sun. And we were stokin' the fires and oilin' up the machinery. Until the Gods found out we had ideas of our own. And war was coming and the Earth was shaking. and there was no more ruin in the Garden of Allah. Today I made an appearance downtown. I am an expert witness because I say I am. And I said gentlemen, and I use that world loosely. I will testify for you, I'm a gun for hire,I'm a saint, I'm a liar. Because there are no facts, there is no truth. Just data to be manipulated. I can get you any result you like. What's it worth to you?. Because there is no wrong, there is no right. And I sleep very well at night. No shame, no solution, no remorse, no retribution. Just people selling t-shirts. Just opportunity to participate in the pathetic little circus. and winning, winning, winning. It was pretty big year for predators. The marketplace was on a roll. and the land of opportunity. spawned a whole new breed of men without souls. This year notoriety got all confused with fame. and the devil is downhearted babe, cause. there's nothing left for him to claim. He said it's just like home. It's so low-down I can't stand it. I guess my work around here has all been done. And the fruit is rotten, the serpent's eyes shine. as he wraps around the vine,. in the Garden of Allah. in the Garden of Allah. in the Garden of Allah."
the genie,"(Don Henley/Stan Lynch/Stuart Brawley). Is this what you wanted?. Did you even think twice?. Didn't they tell you that anything that feels this good. Comes with a price. It gave you such a rush. Now you think you've had enough. It's not that easy to walk away. This is the hard stuff. You can't get the genie back in the bottle. You can't get the genie back in the bottle. You can't get the genie back in the bottle. You can't get the genie back in the bottle. And everything matters, everything matters. Every little thing you do. That smoldering tingle under your skin. That sweet, delicious, but not-so-original sin. And when the world becomes too little or too much. The shadow mind contrives. The triumph and the tragedy that we invite into our lives. And Adam glanced back at the tree. As he was leaving. Said, â€œBaby, that's the price we pay. Knowing is grievingâ€. You can't get the genie back in the bottle. You can't get the genie back in the bottle. You can't get the genie back in the bottle. You can't get the genie back in the bottle. And everything matters, everything matters. Everything you say, everything you do. And the past comes back to smack you around. For all the things you thought you got for free. For the arrogance to think that you could somehow. Defy the laws of gravity. These are lessons in humility. Penitence for past offenses. Consequences, consequences. You can't get the genie back in the bottle. You can't get the genie back in the bottle. You can't get the genie back in the bottle. You can't get the genie back in the bottle."
the heart of the matter,"I got the call today. That I didn't wanna hear. But I knew that it would come. An old, true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone. She said you'd found someone. And I thought of all the bad luck,. and the struggles we went through. And how I lost me and you lost you. What are these voices outside love's open door. Make us throw off our contentment. and beg for something more?. I'm learning to live without you now. But I miss you sometimes. The more I know, the less I understand. All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again. I've been tryin' to get down. to the heart of the matter. But my will gets weak. and my thoughts seem to scatter. But I think it's about...forgiveness. Forgiveness. Even if, even if you don't love me anymore. Ah...these times are so uncertain. There's a yearning undefined. and people filled with rage. We all need a little tenderness. How can love survive in such a graceless age?. Ah...the trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness. They're the very things - we kill I guess.... Ohh pride and competition. cannot fill these empty arms. And the work I put between us. you know it doesn't keep me warm. I'm learning to live without you now. But I miss you, baby. And the more I know, the less I understand. All the things I thought I'd figured out. I have to learn again. I've been trying to get down. to the heart of the matter. But everything changes. and my friends seem to scatter. But I think it's about...forgiveness. Forgiveness. Even if, even if, you don't love me anymore. There are people in your life who've come and gone. They let you down, you know they hurt your pride. You better put it all behind you baby; cause' life goes on. If you keep carryin' that anger, it'll eat you up inside, baby. I've been trying to get down. to the heart of the matter. But my will gets weak. and my thoughts seem to scatter. But I think it's about forgiveness. Forgiveness. Even if, even if you don't love me. I've been tryin' to get down. to the heart of the matter. Because the flesh will get weak. and the ashes will scatter. So I'm thinkin' about forgiveness. Forgiveness. Even if, even if, you don't love me.... Forgiveness (yeah). Forgiveness (baby). Forgiveness (ohh). Forgiveness (ahh yeaaahhh). Forgiveness (ohh). Forgiveness. Even if, you don't love me anymore...."
the last worthless evening,"I know you broke up with him. And your heart's still on the shelf. It's been over two years for me. And I'm still not quite myself. You can't be with someone new. And you can't go back to him. You're beginning to realize. That it's sink or swim. I see you around sometimes. And my heart just melts. You're lookin' like if you had your wish. You'd be somewhere else. And it just breaks my heart. To see you here this way. Someday I'll get the nerve. To walk up to you and say. This is the last worthless evening. That you'll have to spend. Just gimme a chance. To show you how to love again. This is the last worthless evening. That you'll have to spend. 'Cause I'll be there. When your broken heart is on the mend. Every night it's the same old crowd. in smoky rooms. You catch a faint glimpse of love sometimes. But it never blooms. I've been around this block a time or two. And I've made some big mistakes. But girl I promise you, I promise you. That this is the worthless evening. That you'll have to spend. Just gimme a chance. To show you how to love again. This is the last worthless evening. That you'll have to spend. 'Cause it won't be long. 'Till your little heart is on the mend. People inside their houses. with the shades pulled down. God knows, we could use some romance. In this sleepy bedroom town. I know you're still afraid to rush into anything. But there're just so many summers. And just so many springs. And this is the last worthless evening. That you'll have to spend. Just gimme a chance to show you how. to love again. This is the last worthless evening. That you'll have to spend, baby. 'Cause I'll be there when your broken heart. is on the mend. This is the last worthless evening. That you'll have to spend. Just gimme a chance, gimme a chance. To show you how to love again. This is the last worthless evening. That you'll have to spend 'cause it won't be long. 'Til your little heart is on the mend."
the unclouded day,Oh they tell me of a land far beyond the skies. Oh they tell me of a home far away. Oh they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise. Oh they tell me of an unclouded day. Refrain:. Oh the land of cloudless day. Oh the land of an unclouded day. Oh they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise. Oh they tell me of an unclouded day. Oh they tell me of a home where my friends have gone. Oh they tell me of that land far away. Where the tree of life in eternal bloom. Sheds its fragrance through the unclouded day. Refrain. Oh they tell me of the King in his beauty there. And they tell me that mine eyes shall behold. Where he sits on the throne that is whiter than snow. In that city that is made of gold. Refrain. Oh they tell me that He smiles on his children there. And His smile drives their sorrows away. And they tell me that no tears ever come again. In that lovely land of unclouded day. Refrain.
them and us,"One finger on the button. one finger up his nose. Johnny's in some cornfield. The Early Warning Blows. Bigger is better. More is more. Look up, America!. Gonna even up the score. Get ready boys. Third times a charm. Don't need no sweater. It's gonna keep you warm. If we can't have the ball, there won't be any winner. this time. Them and us. Them and us. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. If forty-five minutes. It'll all be done. We'll all be good and crispy. But we'll still be number one. And if things go from bad to worse. We can still kill them if they kill us first. If we can't have the ball, there won't be any winner. this time. Hell-bent. Heaven sent. It all got started by an accident. If we can't have the ball, there won't be any winner. this time. Them and us. Them and us. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. Them and us. Them and us. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust."
"they're not here, they're not coming","(Don Henley/Stan Lynch). From the Arizona desert. To the Salisbury Plain. Lights on the horizon. Patterns on the grain. Anxious eyes turned upward. Clutching souvenirs. Carrying our highest hopes and our darkest fears. They swear there was an accident back in '47. Little man with a great big head. Splattered down from heaven. Government conspiracy; cover-ups and lies. Hidden in the desert under endless skies. Well, it's a cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold. Post, postmodern world. No time for heroes, no place for good guys. No room for Rocky The Flying Squirrel. They're not here, they're not coming. Not in a million years. Turn your weary eyes back homeward. Stop your trembling, dry your tears. You may see the heavens flashing. You may hear the cosmos humming. But I promise you, my brother. They're not here, they're not coming. Would they pile into the saucer. Find Orlando's rat and hug it?. Go screaming through the universe. Just to get McNuggets?. Well, I don't think so, I don't think so. It's much too dangerous, it's much too strange. Here in a world that won't give Oprah no home on the range. Well, it's a cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold. Post, postmodern world. No authenticity, no sign of soul. The radio won't play George and Merle. They're not here, they're not coming. Not in a million years. 'Til we put away our hatred. 'Til we lay aside our fears. You may see the heavens flashing. You may hear the cosmos humming. But I promise you, my sister. They're not here, they're not coming. To this garden we were given. And always took for granted. It's like my daddy told me, â€œYou just bloom where you're planted.â€. Now you long to be delivered. From this world of pain and strife. That's a sorry substitution for a spiritual life. (Solo). Well, it's a cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold. Post, postmodern world. No place for sentiment, no room for romance. Bring back the Duke of Earl. They're not here, they're not coming. Not in a million years. Turn your hopes back homeward. Hold your children, dry their tears. You may see the heavens flashing. You may hear the cosmos humming. But I promise you, my brother. They're not here, they're not coming. They're not here, they're not coming. Not in a million years. 'Til we put away our hatred. And lay aside our fears. You may see the heavens flashing. You may hear the cosmos humming. But I promise you, my brother. They're not here, they're not coming."
this love,"I had a good life before you came. I had my friends and my feeling. I had my name. Still there was sorrow and emptiness. Till you made me glad. Oh, and this love, I found strength, never knew I had. And this love, is like nothing I have ever known. Take my hand love, I'm taking you home, taking you home. There were days, lonely days, when the world wouldn't throw me a crumb. No no. But I kept on believing, that this day would would come, oh. And this love, is like nothing I have ever known. Take my hand love, I'm taking you home, I'm taking you home. Where we can be with the ones who really care. Home, where we can grow together, keep you in my heart forever. Oh, and this love, is like nothing I have ever known. Take my hand love, I'm taking you home. Ohhh, this love, is like nothing I have ever known, no no, baby. Take my hand, taking you home, taking you home. Yes I am, ooh, taking you home. Taking you home baby. I'm taking you home."
through your hands,"You were dreamin'. On a park bench. 'bout a broad highway somewhere. When the music from the carillon. Seemed to hurl your heart out there. Past the scientific darkness. Past the fireflies that float. To an angel bending down. To wrap you in his warmest coat. And you ask. What am I not doing. He says. Your voice cannot command. In time you will move mountains. And it will come through your hands. Still you argue for an option. Still you angle for your case. Like you wouldn't know a burning bush. If it blew up in your face. Yeah, we scheme about the future. And we dream about the past. When just a simple reaching out. Might build a bridge that lasts. And you ask. What am I not doing. He says. Your voice cannot command. In time you will move mountains. And it will come through your hands. Through your hands. So whatever your hands find to do. You must do with all your heart. There are thoughts enough. To blow men's minds. And tear great worlds apart. There's a healing touch to find you. On that broad highway somewhere. To lift you high. As music flyin'. Through the angel's hair. Don't ask what you are not doing. Because your voice cannot command. In time we will move mountains. And it will come through your hands. ."
train in the distance,"When I was a young boy. Roamin' on the railroad tracks. Put copper pennies on the rails. Locomotive come and squash 'em flat. We'd run to fetch 'em back. We'd run to fetch 'em back. Summer nights at Gran-ma's house. Cozy in my bed. Dreams of far-off places and other lives to be led. Swirling in my head. Swirling in my head. And there's a train in the distance. There's a whistle calling. There's a train in the distance. Silver moonlight falling. Now. I am a grown man. Turning in my sleep. Debts and obligations. Family ties run deep. Promises to keep. Promises to keep. But there's a train in the distance. There's a whistle calling. There's a train in the distance. There's a light rain falling. You can ride that train to the far end of creation. Away from everything and everyone you know. You better make friends with your angels and your demons. They will be riding with you wherever you, may go. But, you have to go. There's a train in the distance. There's a whistle calling. There's a train in the distance. Autumn leaves are falling"
waiting tables,"She grew up tall... in a timber town. But trees were not the only things... that were falling down. Breezes thru the pines was blowing bittersweet. They blew the papers down the dead end street. She married a boy... soon as she got out of school. But he turned out to be a reckless fool. And gone are the days... when she was worry free. Now she's a single mom... she's only twenty-three. And she's waiting tables... she's just waiting tables. She's learned a lot about people. More than she... ever wanted to know. She's just waiting tables... waiting tables. Biding her time until there's... some-where else to go. Well her working day is done... she tallies up her tips. She sighs, dear Lord above there must be more than this. Some-day she'll see this misery in her rear view mirror. But for today she'll find a way... to get along right here. And she's waiting tables... she's just waiting tables. She's learned a lot about people. More than she... ever wanted to know. She's just waiting tables... waiting tables. Biding her time until there's... some-where else to go. One rainy night a hand-some man came in. Said he was bound for parts unknown. They talked and talked... until the moon went down. But in the morning he was gone. Waiting tables, she's just waiting tables. Another year or two... she'll be moving on. She's just waiting tables, waiting tables. Holding her own until something better comes along. Waiting tables, she's just waiting tables. Biding her time until something better comes along"

watching tv,We were watchin' tv...watchin'tv. We were watchin' tv...watchin'tv. In Tiananmen Square. lost my baby there. My yellow rose. And her bloodstained clothes. She was a short order pastry chef. In a Dim Sum dive on the Yangtze tideway. She had shiny hair. She was the daughter of an engineer. Won't you shed a tear. For my yellow rose. My yellow rose. And her bloodstained clothes. She had perfect breasts. She had high hopes. She had almond eyes. She had yellow thighs. She was a student of philosophy. Won't you grieve with me. For my yellow rose. Shed a tear. For her bloodstained clothes. She had shiny hair. She had perfect breasts. She had high hopes. She had almond eyes. She had yellow thighs. She was the daughter of an engineer. So get out your pistols. Get out your stones. Get out your knives. Cut them to the bone. They are the lackeys of the grocer's machine. They built the dark satanic mills. That manufacture hell on earth. They bought the front row seats on Calvary. They are irrelevant to me. And I grieve for my sister. People of China. Do not forget do not forget. The children who died for you. Long live the Republic. Did we do anything after this. I've a feeling we did. We were watchin' TV...Watchin' TV. We were watchin' TV...Watchin' TV. She wore a white bandanna that said. Freedom now. She thought the Great Wall of China. Would come tumbling down. She was a student. Her father was an engineer. Won't you shed a tear. For my yellow rose. My yellow rose. And her bloodstained clothes. Her grandpa fought old Chiang Kai-shek. That no-good low-down dirty rat. Who used to order his troops. To fire on the women and children. Imagine that imagine that. And in the spring of '48. Mao Tse-tung got quite irate. And he kicked that old dictator Chiang. Out of the state of China. Chiang Kai-shek came down in Formosa. And they armed the island of Quemoy. And the shells were flying across the China Sea. And they turned Formosa into a shoe factory. Called Taiwan. And she is different from Cro-Magnon man. She's different from Anne Boleyn. She is different from the Rosenbergs. And from the unknown Jew. She is different from the unknown Nicaraguan. Half superstar half victim. She's a victor star conceptually new. And she is different from the Dodo. And from the Kankanbono. She is different from the Aztec. And from the Cherokee. She's everybody's sister. She's symbolic of our failure. She's the one in fifty million. Who can help us to be free. Because she died on TV.
when i stop dreaming,"When I stop dreaming. That's when I'll stop loving you. The worst I've ever been hurt in my life. The first time I ever wanted to die. Was the night when you told me. You loved someone else. And you asked me if I could forget. When I stop dreaming. That's when I'll stop wanting you. I'd be like a flower unwanted in spring. Alone, neglected, transplanted in vain. In your garden of sadness where. Its petals will fall. In the shadows of undying pain. When I stop dreaming. That's when I'll stop thinking of you. You may teach the flowers to bloom in snow. You may take a pebble and teach it to grow. You might teach all the raindrops. To return to the clouds. But you can't teach my heart to forget. When I stop dreaming. That's when I'll stop crying for you"
where i am now,"I've done some foolish things. I've been downright stupid. I've been a sucker for a pretty face. Lord, I was poltuted. When people say, ""Would you go back? "".

I'm making one last victory lap and then I'll take a bow. Because I like where I am now. Where I am now. Father Time is a friend. I feel at home. In my own skin. There ain't no limit to the havoc he can wreak. When a young man slips into his self·destructive streak. I been east, west, north and south. But I made it through somehow. And I like where I am now. You know, I like where I am now. I said, I like where I am now"
words can break your heart,"A little time, a little distance. A little space to think. Might be all we need, right now. I don't know if we've had too much. Or not enough to drink. But, we've got to get over this, somehow. It only takes a breath or two. To tear your world apart. Sticks and stones may break your bones. But words can break your heart. Cutting words from careless lips, softly spoken. Oh, you can do damage and never scream and shout. Emotions get the best of us; we say things we don't mean. And it's too late to take 'em back once they're out. It only takes a breath or two. To tear your world apart. Sticks and stones may break your bones. But words can break your heart. Oh, can we just start over?. Nobody won; what's done is done. We've got to let it go. It only takes a breath or two. To tear your world apart. Sticks and stones may break your bones.

workin' it,"(Don Henley/Frank Simes/Stan Lynch). Ah, it's open season here my friend. It always is; it always has been. Welcome, welcome to the U.S.A..

We're workin' it. Workin' it. Soon you will be dancing face-to-face. With the limits of ambition and the scars of the marketplace. Welcome to the land of flame and fizz. Where you will learn that packaging is all that heaven is. We got the little black car, the little black dress. Got the guru, the trainer, the full court press. We got the software, hard drive, CD-ROM. We got the exploitation.com. We got the pager, cell phone, bootleg methaqualone. The media, the message: you are what you own. We got the agent, lawyer, lapdog, voyeur. Talk show, book deal, round mouth, square meal. We're so busy covering our asses, we just can't commit. â€œOh, back off, don't bother me, baby. Can't you see I'm workin' itâ€. Workin' it. It's plain to see Miss Liberty has not yet come of age. But, she loves to feed the animals as long as they're locked up in the cage. And everybody knows the girl's got balls of brass. Aw, kiss my ass. (Solo). We've got a whole new class of opiates. To blunt the stench of discontent. In these corporation nation-states. Where the loudest live to trample on the least. They say it's just the predatory nature of the beast. But, the barons in the balcony are laughing. And pointing to the pit. They say, â€œAw look, they've grown accustomed to the smell. Now, people love that shit. And we're workin' it.â€. Workin' it. We got the short-term gain, the long-term mess. We got the suffocating, quarterly consciousness. Yes man, run like a thief. New York to Hollywood, hype and glory. Special effects, no story. Yes man, run like a thief. Workin' it. Workin' it. Well, you don't know who the enemy is. You don't know. You don't know who the enemy is. Company man. â€œEight for me, one for youâ€. (Workin' it). â€œVery fairâ€.

Well, the perfume she wore you can buy. down at the Five & Dime. But on some other woman. It don't smell the same in your mind. You keep telling yourself you can take it-. Telling yourself that you're tough. But you still wanna hold here. You must n ot be drinkin' enough. You're not drinking enough. to wash away old memories. And there ain't enough whiskey in Texas to. keep you from beggin' ,""Please, please, please."". She passed on your passion. and stepped on your pride. Turns out you ain't quite so tough. 'Cause you still wanna hold her. You must not be drinkin' enough. Ay-yi-yi-yi. Ask yourself why. You still wanna hold her. You must no be drinkin' enough. Ay-yi-yi-yi, etc........"
