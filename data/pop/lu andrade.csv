mind and heart,"I never meant to be without you,. Oh, life is very unpredictable,. Now living without you is impossible.. You're always in my head,. You're always in my head.. I cannot believe in. The way that you look at me.. Always in my head,. You're always in my head,. There's no way to live this,. But someday you will need me.. I never wanted to be a fool,. When I showed my broken heart to you.. I know you want me,. And I want you.. You're always in my head,. You're always in my head.. I cannot believe in. The way that you look at me now.. Always in my head,. You're always in my head,. There's no way to live this,. But someday you will need me.. I meant everything that I said to you,. I know that I'm still so in love with you.. You're on my mind and heart.. I meant everything that I said to you,. I know that I'm still so in love with you.. You're on my mind and heart.. Yes, you are…. You're always in my head,. You're always in my head.. I cannot believe in. The way that you look at me.. Always in my head,. Now I wish you could hold my hand,. There's no way to live this,. But someday you will need me.. Well I meant everything that I said to you,. I know that I'm still so in love with you,. You're on my mind and heart.. I meant everything that I said to you,. I know that I'm still so in love with you,. You're on my mind, in my heart."
crazy baby,"Crazy Baby. And your hands are really shaking something awful. As you light your twenty-seventh cigarette. Oh, how long have you been sitting in the darkness. You forget.... Oh, you know you’re getting really hard to be with. And you’re crying every time you turn around. And you wonder why you cannot pick your head up. Off the ground.... Oh, my crazy baby. Try to hold on tight. Oh, my crazy baby. Don’t put out the light.... The light, the light, the light. And they look at you like they don’t speak your language. And you’re living at the bottom of a well. And you’ve swallowed all the awful bloody secrets. But you can’t tell.... Oh, you know you ought to get yourself together. But you cannot bear to walk outside your door. No, you cannot bear to look into the mirror. Anymore.... Refrão. And your hands are really shaking something awful. As your worries climb around inside your clothes. Oh, how long will you be sitting in the darkness. Heaven knows.... Refrão"
