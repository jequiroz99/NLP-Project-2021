beautiful life,"Fuerza, destino. Existencialismo. De un mundo irreal. Let go like a reckless renegade. Cut to the chase that's in the making. No smoke brave and bold and up in your face.

Wake up to a beautiful life. Beautiful life. Beautiful life. New reincarnation. Die into a beautiful life. Step out of the soles you're tripping in. Exile the old you that's been weathered. Get loud now's the day a new you begins. Be your own defector. The only hostage that you're holding now. The fear you won't let go of, oh no. Living in a world you think somehow. You can keep control of. Wake up to a beautiful life. Beautiful life. Beautiful life. New reincarnation. Die into a beautiful life. Beautiful life. Beautiful life. New reincarnation.
