just a guy,"It's the first time they talk. It's bizarre how the clock never goes on. Whenever you're waiting for your boy to show up. In the middle of the crowd. And you just don't know how he does it. 'Though he's not your type of man. Can be lovely the way he stares. He is not the one you dreamed of. But you like it anyways. Oh I can't forget he's just a guy. But he knows exactly what I like. And it's important to remind. That so far he's never made me cry. And don't tell me I'll live a lie. You don't know how hard it's been to find. Someone who simply makes me smile. So I might as well give it a try. All the features he's got. Things he does that I'm not really used to. But I still kind of love his tattoos. And don't worry I'm the same. I'm just looking for a way to find. The balance I need in my life. Discovering my wrongs and rights. And believe me when I say. It's not a good time to ask for me to stay. Don't forget he's just a guy. But he knows exactly what I like. And it's important to remind. That so far he's never made me cry. And don't tell me I'll live a lie. You don't know how hard it's been to find. Someone who simply makes me smile. So I might as well give it a try. He ain't worth it changing all your life. But who told you I plan on giving up my pride. Maybe it will last a while. But for me it's now enough. That he can make me smile. Oh, and don't forget he's just a guy. But he knows exactly what I like. And it's important to remind. That so far he's never made me cry. And don't tell me I'll live a lie. You don't know how hard it's been to find. Someone who simply makes me smile. So I might as well give it a try"
the first one to say goodbye,"If I could take a pill. To forget ya, I would. If I could lose your smile from my mind. No doubt, I would. You keep showing up, messing up. all of my plans to erase you from my life. And it'd be the only way I could possibly survive. You gave up. But you weren't man enough to tell me. So you dragged my feelings up and down. You hid and turned me upside down. Pretended you could hear. But you were never, ever here. You told me you loved me in every way. But still wouldn't move a finger to make me stay. And I never cried so much. I've never been that hurt in my life. And you lied when you told me we'd be alright. How can it be?. When you were the first one to say goodbye. Boy, I've got nothing left to lose. I've got empty hands, shattered plans. and I'm all confused. But I got my soul, I got my pride and. I'd never leave them behind. I loved you full time, I loved you full time. So you told me you loved me in every way. But still wouldn't move a finger to make me stay. And I never cried so much.
