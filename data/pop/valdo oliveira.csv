let's work it out,"I wanna try. Let's not fight again. Let's work it out. Our love can survive this lion's den *. I wanna stop this. Arguments will destroy our love and bliss. Come on, come on, give me a kiss. You are the one I really miss. Let's work it out. Let's leave for the mountains. We can live on top of the hill. We've come this far and we always will **. Binding in the breeze is easy. A sand storm can tear us apart. Let's forget the drama. And create a new start. I know what you can say. But, you're so wrong, baby. Stay, stay. I never put anyone in our way. My love for you is day and night, night and day. * Repeat. ** Repeat"
move on,As I walk along this road. I see years pass me by. No matter what I try. As I walk through the tunnel of time. I stare at days as they go by. Looks like I am at the corner of life. I need to move on and on I go. I am at the corner of days. But on this lonely road I can't stay. Choosing right is the right way. As I walk through the valley of life. I see the trees I left behind. I see the dreams I buried into my mind. I will set them free. A bright future will shine upon me. Hope is all I need to move on and on I go. Love is all I need to move on and on I go. Hope is all I need to move on and on I go. Love is all I need to move on and on I go **. Love is all I need to move along this trail. No matter how the trains of life derail. Hope and love will always prevail. ** (Repeat). As I walk along this road. I see years pass me by
