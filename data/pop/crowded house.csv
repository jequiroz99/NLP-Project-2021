don't dream it's over,"There is freedom within, there is freedom without. Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup. There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost. But you'll never see the end of the road. While you're traveling with me. Chorus. Hey now, hey now. Don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now. When the world comes in. They come, they come. To build a wall between us. We know they won't win. Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof. My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof. In the paper today tales of war and of waste. But you turn right over to the T.V. page. Chorus. Hey now, hey now. Don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now. When the world comes in. They come, they come. To build a wall between us. We know they won't win. . Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum. And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart. Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof. Get to know the feeling of liberation and reliefs.. Chorus. Hey now, hey now. Don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now. When the world comes in. They come, they come. To build a wall between us. We know they won't win"
better be home soon,Somewhere deep inside. Something's got a hold on you. And it's pushing me aside. See it stretch on forever. I know I'm right. For the first time in my life. That's why I tell you. You'd better be home soon. Stripping back the coats. Of lies and deception. Back to nothingness. Like a weekend in the desert. I know I'm right. For the first time in my life. That's why I tell you. You'd better be home soon. So don't say no. Don't say nothing's wrong. Cos when you get back home. Maybe I'll be gone. It would cause me pain. If we were to end it. But I could start again. You can depend on it. I know I'm right. For the first time in my life. That's why I tell you. You'd better be home soon. That's why I tell you. You'd better be home soon
you are the one to make me cry,"Who’ll face the tide. And take their chances. Will fasten the lights. To broken branches. Adrift on the ocean. In wild winter storms. I have to imagine things. To keep myself warm. The night closing in. But not to worry. Told everyone I know. That I was sorry. But I heard them all singing. For comfort and peace. And in my confusion here. I still believe. You were the one to make me cry. You were the one to take me home. Of all the people in my life. My thoughts keep returning to you. But consciousness is fading fast. Surrounded by sights. That go on living. Make circles in time. The spider web spinning. Well, I have no illusions. Of where I am now. I’ll let this wave take me. And pour me down. You were the one to make me cry. You were the one to take me home. Of all the stories in my life. Only good things return to you. If I could only say the words. If you could hear me cry for help. But I’d lift my head up to the sky. And the planes that were circling. Now have gone"

can't carry on,Why do I kid myself. Why do I scream for pleasure. It's four in the morning should know better. But she can weave a spell. Want it to last forever. Making me feel like somebody special. Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep). Before it gets too late (just go to sleep). Doing damage to my brain. Well here we go again. Though I look everywhere. I never seem to find it. Always a shadow around a corner. Drown it in alcohol. Stuck in the elevator. Hard to remember in the morning. Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep). Before it gets too late (just go to sleep). Doing damage to my brain. Well here we go again. Tell you about myself. If you're in the mood to listen. Baby you don't know who you're kissing. This is a lonely world. You are a strange companion. When you get what you wanted. You want to leave. Honestly I want to free myself. From the burden of inaction. Honestly I want to raise myself. To any plane I can imagine. Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep). Before it gets too late (just go to sleep). Doing damage to my brain. Well here we go again.
weather with you,Written By N. Finn & T. Finn. Walking 'round the room singing. Stormy Weather. at 57 Mt. Pleasant St.. Well it's the same room but everything's different. You can fight the sleep but not the dream. Things ain't cooking in my kitchen. Strange affliction wash over me. Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire. Couldn't conquer the blue sky. Well there's a small boat made of china. Is going nowhere on the mantlepiece. Well do I lie like a loungeroom lizard. Or do I sing like a bird released. CHORUS. Everywhere you go you always take the weather with you. (Repeat).
four seasons in one day,"Four seasons in one day. Llying in the depths of your imagination. Worlds above and worlds below. Sun shine's on the black clouds hanging over the domain. Even when your feeling warm. The temperature could drop away. Like four seasons in one day. Smiling as the shit comes down. You can tell a man from what he has to say. Everything gets turned around. And I will risk my neck again, again. You can take me where you will. Up the creek and through the mill. Like all the things you can't explain. Four seasons in one day. Blood dries up. Like rain, like rain. Fills my cup. Like four seasons in one day. Doesn't pay to make predictions. Sleeping on an un-made bed. Finding out wherever there is comfort there is pain. Only one step away. Like four seasons in one day. Blood dries up. Like rain, like rain. Fills my cup. Like four seasons in one day."
saturday sun,"It’s a saturday sun. And the game is still on. And the waiting is done. It’s all about you. As he calls out your name. On a hill far away. Ravens circle above. It’s all about to change. He’s insane. Calling on the day. ��til the clouds get blown away. While inside his mind. Lie all of space and time. And the farthest ones unite. It’s a saturday sun. And the madness is won. And the night has been sung. Out of existence. And my head is alright. Was the darkest of nights. Now the cadmium sun. Is calling on the day. Til the clouds get blown away. There’s an eye inside his mind. For all of space and time. He’s been waiting for a sign. Looking for the revelation maybe. Or visions of the underworld. But when you saw the first light,. Then you know it’s alright. It’s a saturday sun. And the madness is won. And the nightmare is done. In time he wakes. Colours up the sky. Make the darkness come to life. Memories inside his heart. Of everything he wants to know. And every place he has to go"
mansion in the slums,"I'd much rather have a caravan in the hills. Than a mansion in the slums. The taste of success only lasts you. Half an hour or less. But it loves you when it comes. And you laugh at yourself. While you're bleeding to death. I'd much rather have a trampoline in my front room. Than an isolation tank. I wish I was a million miles away. From the manager's door. There is trouble at the bank. You laugh at yourself. As you go deep into debt. Laugh at yourself. While he's breathing down your neck. Who can stop me. With money in my pocket. Sometimes I get it free. The best of both worlds. I'd much rather have a caravan in the hills. I'd much rather have a mansion ... in the hills. Than a mansion in the slums. Yeah I'd much rather .... What I mean is, would you mind if I had it all. I'll take it when it comes. And you laugh at yourself. While you're bleeding to death. And somebody else is always. Breathing down your neck. Laugh at yourself. While he's hanging over your head. The best of both worlds. It'll soon be over."
i walk away,You came. Out of this world to me. My life. Parted like the Red Sea. We flowed. Easy between the rocks and stones. Never seemed to stop us. The years. Ended in confusion. Don't ask me I don't know what happened. But I am. A man with a mission. Must be the devil I don't know. It's hard to let go. Of all that we know. As I walk away from you. Hurled from my home. Into the unknown. As I walk away from you. Reveal whatever you desire. To you it may be death defying. Black day. In the coldness of winter. Black words. Slipping off my tongue. I say forget it - it's over. As a dark cloud covered up the sun. It's hard to let go. Of all that we know. As I walk away from you. The sun always sets. With room for regrets. As I walk away from you. Give it to me. Give it to me. Your inspiration. Give to receive. Find all we need. As I walk away. Just a slave to ambition. Tension your permanent condition. So much you've always wanted. Too much given' you a sore head.
something so strong,Love can make you weep. Can make you run for cover. Roots that spread so deep. Bring life to frozen ground. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. Turning in my sleep. Love can leave you cold. A taste of jealousy. Is like a lust for gold. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. I've been. Feeling so much older. Frame me. And hang me on the wall. I've seen. You fall into the same trap. This thing. Is happening to us all. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. Somthing so strong.....
hole in the river,"There's a hole in the river where my auntie lies. From the land of the living to the air and sky. Left her car by the river left her shoes beside. Through the thorns and the bushes I hope she was.... Dreaming of glory. Miles above the mountains and plains. Free at last. We were touched by a cold wind, my father and I. The sound of desperate breathing her fear inside us all. She was coming to see him but something changed her mind. Drove her down to the river. There is no return. There's a hole in the river where a memory lies. From the land of the living to the air and sky. She was coming to see him. But something changed her mind,. Drove her down to the river. There is no return."
mean to me,"She came all the way from America. Had a blind date with destiny. And the sound of Te Awamutu. Had a truly sacred ring. Now her parents are divorced. And her friend's committing suicide. I could not escape. A plea from the heart. You know what it means to me. She said don't walk away. I'm down on my knees. So please don't be mean to me. So I talked to you for an hour. In the bar of a small town hotel. You asked me what I was thinking. I was thinking of a padded cell. With a black and white T.V.. To stop us from getting lonely. I could not escape. A plea from the heart. You know what it means to me. She said don't walk away. I'm down on my knees. So please don't be mean to me. No, I could not escape. A plea from the heart. Mysterious sympathy. I couldn't wait for a chance. To walk out the door. You know what it means to me. I saw you lying in the arms of a poet. I heard him tell you t...tantalising lies.

never be the same,Don't stand around like friends at a funeral. Eyes to the ground. It could've been you. Why do you weep for the passing of ages. You slip with the back of your hand. You're taking it out on the one you love. I couldn't believe it. Chorus. But we might still survive. And rise up through the maze. If you could change your life. And never be the same.

From the burden of inaction. Honestly I want to raise myself. To any plane I can imagine. Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep). Before it gets too late (just go to sleep). Doing damage to my brain. Well here we go again.
catherine wheels,No night to stay in. Bad moon is rising again. Dice rolls. And you burn. Come down I fear. As that cold wheel turns. I know what I know. Sad Claude's been sleeping around. To stroke the right nerve. Whose needs do I serve. As Catherine's wheel turns. She was always the first to say gone. she's got her catherine wheels on. Always the first to say gone. Go kindly with him. To his blind apparition. His face creases up. With age gone grey. He'll back here one day. She was always the first to say gone. she's got her catherine wheels on. Always the first to say gone. She's got her catherine wheels on. Wheels on. Catherine wheels. She's gone. Vanished in the night. Broke off the logic of light. He woke. Tore the covers back. Found he was empty inside. So they were told. When the moon would rise. The best time to leave with your soul. She's gone. But towards the light. Watching her whole life unfold. Bruises come out dark. So strong was his hold on her. Regarded by some as his slave. He spoke as in a stranger's tongue. Despair us and drive you away. Bruises come out dark.
chocolate cake,"Not everyone in New York would pay to see Andrew Lloyd Webber. May his trousers fall down as he bows to the queen and the crown. I don't know what tune the orchestra played. But it went by me sickly sentimental. Can I have another piece of chocolate cake. Tammy Baker's got a lot on her plate. Can I buy another cheap Picasso fake. Andy Warhol must be laughing in his grave. The band of the night take you to ethereal heights over dinner. And you wander the streets never reaching the heights that you seek. And the sugar that dripped from the violin's bow made the children go crazy. Put a hole in the tooth of a hag. Can I have another piece of chocolate cake. Tammy Baker must be losing her faith, yeah. Can I buy another cheap Picasso fake. Andy Warhol must be laughing in his grave. And dogs are on the road, we're all tempting fate. Cars are shooting by with no number plates. And here comes Missis Hairy legs. I saw Elvis Presley walk out of a Seven Eleven. And a woman gave birth to a baby and then bowled 257. Now the excess of fat on your American bones. Will cushion the impact as you sink like a stone. Can I have another piece of chocolate cake. Tammy Baker, Tammy Baker. Can I buy another cheap Picasso fake. Cheap Picasso, cheap Picasso fake. Can I have another piece of chocolate cake. Kathy Straker boy could she lose some weight. Can I buy another slice of real estate. Liberace must be laughing in his grave."
distant sun,"Tell me all the things you would change. I don't pretend to know what you want. When you come around and spin my top. Time and again, time and again. No fire where I lit my spark. I am not afraid of the dark. Where your words devour my heart. And put me to shame, put me to shame. And your seven worlds collide. Whenever I am by your side. And dust from a distant sun. Will shower over everyone. You're still so young to travel so far. Old enough to know who you are. Wise enough to carry the scars. Without any blame, there's no one to blame. It's easy to forget what you learned. Waiting for the thrill to return. Feeling your desire burn. You're drawn to the flame. When your seven worlds collide. Whenever I am by your side. And dust from a distant sun. Will shower over everyone. Dust from a distant sun. Will shower over everyone. And I'm lying on the table. Washed out in the flood. Like a Christian fearing vengeance from above. I don't pretend to know what you want. But I offer love. Seven worlds collide. Whenever I am by your side. And dust from a distant sun. Will shower over everyone. As time slips by, and on and on."
don't dream it's over,"There is freedom within, there is freedom without. Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup. There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost. But you'll never see the end of the road. While you're traveling with me. Chorus. Hey now, hey now. Don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now. When the world comes in. They come, they come. To build a wall between us. We know they won't win. Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof. My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof. In the paper today tales of war and of waste. But you turn right over to the T.V. page. Chorus. Hey now, hey now. Don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now. When the world comes in. They come, they come. To build a wall between us. We know they won't win. . Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum. And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart. Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof. Get to know the feeling of liberation and reliefs.. Chorus. Hey now, hey now. Don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now. When the world comes in. They come, they come. To build a wall between us. We know they won't win"
don't stop now,"Another pleasant day in the countryside. Tears on a stormy night. You can’t follow my directions home. Don’t stop now. God knows where the satellite’s taking us. Who knows what is right in front of us. But I hang on every word. Don’t stop now. Well, don’t stop now. Give me something I can cry about. Get fooled by the lightning every time. See the afterimage of my outline. Then I turn the wrong way ‘round. Well, don’t stop now. No, don’t stop now. Give me something I can cry about. Give me something I can write about. The church just ten miles out of town. The devil gonna track me down. Travel through a tunnel. Remember that’s how you get to me. No number on the house. No birds are flying south. Sometimes you have to turn. The wrong way ‘round. And times you will return. To what you found. Give me something I can write about. All I want is something I can cry about"
dr. livingstone,"Steam ship, sail down the river. Fight the mosquitoes that fly in a swarm. White smoke covers the jungle. See Dr. Livingston land with a thunk. Down where the sad willows gather. Young women weep for their dying babies. I am a white man in Africa. If I were to stay here. There'd be no one to save me. I hear the drums. I know it's urgent. I hear survival in his hands.

Whenever I fall at your feet. And you let your tears rain down on me. Whenever I touch your slow turning pain. You're hiding from me now. There's something in the way that you're talking. The words don't sound right. But I hear them all moving inside you. Go, I'll be waiting when you call. Whenever I fall at your feet. And you let your tears rain down on me. Whenever I touch your slow turning pain. The finger of blame has turned upon itself. And I'm more than willing to offer myself. Do you want my presence or need my help. Who knows where that might lead. I fall at your feet. And you let your tears rain down on me. Whenever I fall."
falling dove,"All his life, blown by wildfire. Like a spark, cause and effect. One loose word, a revolution. One kind act, whole armies give thanks. Falling dove, born of ocean. Found by man, lived on his own. Lift a sail, tighten the knots. Lift him up, barely breathing. Falling dove. Do you believe in us. Like i believe in us. Is the outcome ever strange enough. You keep defending me. When I’m behaving badly. Because you love me. Because you love me too much. May the best of fortune bless you. Could any creature be unmoved. The humble nature of redemption. The simple act of finding a use. Hoping and almost praying. Believing for a moment its true. I made a rendezvous in moscow station. A midnight passenger, the café is closed. In st petersburg the door slides open. I’m a dead man till i see her walk through. Falling dove"

And all of your spells will break. So look out for number one. Fame is in your blood.

four seasons in one day,"Four seasons in one day. Llying in the depths of your imagination. Worlds above and worlds below. Sun shine's on the black clouds hanging over the domain. Even when your feeling warm. The temperature could drop away. Like four seasons in one day. Smiling as the shit comes down. You can tell a man from what he has to say. Everything gets turned around. And I will risk my neck again, again. You can take me where you will. Up the creek and through the mill. Like all the things you can't explain. Four seasons in one day. Blood dries up. Like rain, like rain. Fills my cup. Like four seasons in one day. Doesn't pay to make predictions. Sleeping on an un-made bed. Finding out wherever there is comfort there is pain. Only one step away. Like four seasons in one day. Blood dries up. Like rain, like rain. Fills my cup. Like four seasons in one day."

Through the thorns and the bushes I hope she was.... Dreaming of glory. Miles above the mountains and plains. Free at last. We were touched by a cold wind, my father and I.

i feel possessed,"She said I could never do that. But I know you can, you are in my dream. We are one person not two of a kind. And what was mine is now in your posession. I could feel you underneath my skin. As the wind rushed in. Sent the kitchen table crashing. She said nobody move. Or I'll bring the house down. I hardly know which way is up. Or which way down.

Don't ask me I don't know what happened. But I am. A man with a mission. Must be the devil I don't know. It's hard to let go. Of all that we know. As I walk away from you. Hurled from my home. Into the unknown. As I walk away from you. Reveal whatever you desire. To you it may be death defying. Black day. In the coldness of winter. Black words. Slipping off my tongue. I say forget it - it's over. As a dark cloud covered up the sun. It's hard to let go. Of all that we know. As I walk away from you. The sun always sets. With room for regrets. As I walk away from you. Give it to me. Give it to me. Your inspiration. Give to receive. Find all we need. As I walk away. Just a slave to ambition. Tension your permanent condition. So much you've always wanted. Too much given' you a sore head.

in my command,You're standing in a deep dark hole. Beneath a sky as black as coal. It's just the fear of losing control. You know so well. Don't miss it when the moment comes. Be submissive just this once. Imagine there is something to be done. Some truth to tell. I would love. To trouble you in your time of need. Lose your way. It's a pleasure when you're in my command. Juggle like a diplomat. Struggle to hold onto your hat. Swinging like an acrobat. But time will tell. The clock is dripping on the wall. Listen to the rise and fall. Close your eyes and hear the call you know so well. Put on your wings. You're responsible for everything. Desolate in anger and safe in isolation. You're about to be the victim of a holy visitation. By the rites that I've been given. Put on your wings. You're not responsible for everything. I would love. To trouble you in your time of need. Lose your way. It's a pleasure when you're in my command. When you're in my command. In my command.
in the lowlands,"Oh hell trouble is coming. Out here in panic and alarm. Black shapes gather in the distance. Looks like it won't take long. The first drops land on the window. The first sign that there's something wrong. Light rain and a head full of thunder. Which way, which way. Two days till I get to you. I'll be late if I ever get through. Where I go there'll be no kind welcome. Coming down upon me. Time will keep me warm. Feel my face. Now the insects swarm. In the lowlands. Fear will take the place of desire. And we will fan the flames on high. Try for heavens sake. The sky fell underneath a blanket. The sun sank as the miles went by. Sit back with your head on the pillow.

Spinning off the chandelier. and you’re the one who’s staring at me now. You move me into silence, a heartbeat away from hell. And i try so hard to control myself. But you know i’m smiling on the inside out. You move me into silence"
instinct,I lit the match. I lit the match. I saw another monster turn to ash. Felt the burden lifted from my back. Do you recognize the nervous twitch. That exposes the weakness of the myth. When your turn comes 'round. And the light goes on. And you feel your attraction again. Your instinct can't be wrong. Separate the fiction from the fact. Been a little slow to react. But it's nearly time to flip the switch. And i'm hanging by a single stitch. Laughing at the stony face of gloom. When your turn comes 'round. And the light goes on.

One step is more than enough. To get a look in. You could be already gone. I wish you would take me along. To end this isolation. To end this isolation. I try so hard to get it right.

I've got my senses on. and this is the only place that I always run from."

Throw the memory in an open fire. You'll be free. Roll back the tombstone. Let the saints appear. Roll back the tombstone. Make a new man out of me. Beware the passenger.

The time. She threw the dinner at you. And in the coconut grove. You can’t imagine the scene. Another. We’re still waiting to leave. Talk to her. That’s nice. Or you could make a murder begin.

I spent a lot of time. In the transit lounge. And I wasn’t sure. Where I was going now. Plenty hours spent. Was yesterday’s news. Not 100% sure. What I did with my shoes. Lying on the floor.

walked her way down,She walked her way down. It brought my mind back. From where I was trapped. How long will it take. For tension to break. Feel it sliding off. Shimmy-like cloth. I left on the ground. And I know what the answer is. And I’m happy to be here tonight. But when you’re in the moment. Everything you want is right. But before she takes a step. She’s waiting for the beat to arrive. And the drummer’s counting out the start. She walked her way down. In silver and black. Tension is snapped. I picked up the trace. A scent I can’t place. Remembering desire. Higher and high. Lift off the ground. And I know what the answer is. But I’m happy to be here tonight. And when you’re in the moment. Everything you want is right. From before she takes a step. She’s waiting for the beat to arrive. The drummer makes the same mistake. And my eyes are on the shape. That is captured in the light. All went quiet on the floor. When she walked her way down. As we happen to be here tonight. But don’t we make a beautiful sight. And when you’re in the moment. Everything you want is right. But before she takes a step. She’s waiting for the beat to arrive. If you’re tamed by all the pressure. Everything you want to become. The drummer always comes in late. And my eyes are on the shake. That is captured in the light. And I want to feel the weightless grasp. Upon my heavy life
walking on the spot,"The odd times we slip. and slither down the dark hall. fingers point from old windows. an eerie shadow falls. I'm walking on the spot. to show that I'm alive. moving every bone in my body. from side to side. Will we be in our minds when the dawn breaks. can we look the milkman in the eye. the world is somehow different, you have all been changed. before my very eyes.

See the living room die. the dishes are unwashed and broken. all you do is cry."
weather with you,Written By N. Finn & T. Finn. Walking 'round the room singing. Stormy Weather. at 57 Mt. Pleasant St.. Well it's the same room but everything's different. You can fight the sleep but not the dream. Things ain't cooking in my kitchen. Strange affliction wash over me. Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire. Couldn't conquer the blue sky. Well there's a small boat made of china. Is going nowhere on the mantlepiece. Well do I lie like a loungeroom lizard. Or do I sing like a bird released. CHORUS. Everywhere you go you always take the weather with you. (Repeat).
when you come,When you come across the sea. Me like a beacon guiding you to safety. The sooner the better now. And when you come the hils. Will breathe like a baby. Pulled up heaving from the bottom of the ocean. The sooner the better now. When you come to cover me with your kisses. Fresh like a daisy chained up in a lion's den. I'll know you by the thunderclap. Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions. And that is why. I stumble to my knees. And why underneath the heavens. With the stars burning and exploding. I know I could never let you down. When you come like an iceberg float in darkness. Smashing my hull send me to the bottom of the sea. I should know you better now. When you come your majesty to entrap me. Prince of light receding. The sooner the better now. And when you come to cover me. With your kisses hard like armour. The sooner the better now. I'll know you by the thunderclap. Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions. And that is why. I stumble to my knees. And why underneath the heavens. With the stars burning and exploding. I know I could never let you down. She came out of the water. Into my horizon. Like a cumulo nimbus. Coming in from a distance. Burning and exploding. Burning and exploding. Like a slow volcano. When you come. Cover the ground with ashes. When you come.

whispers and moans,"Dull, dull grey. The colour of our times. Cool, cool space. That I still hope to find. Far beyond the veil. The sound of whispers and moans. Slow, time bomb. The clamour of the street. I hear this town. It never goes to sleep. And I will catch the taxi driver. Weeping like a wounded beast. Then I wake up in your room. To share one piece of your life. When tomorrow comes we may not be here at all. Without your whispers and moans. 'Cos here you come to carry me home. Here you come to carry me home. Love that sound. Time erase. Tension wheels. Cool heels. Won't ya come on open the bid 'fore too long. Then I wake up in your room. To share one piece of your life. I'd give anything to be a fly upon the wall. And hear your whispers and moans. I'd like to hear your whispers and moans. Here you come to carry me. We are the mirrors. Are the mirrors of each other in a lifetime of suspicion. Cleansed in a moment of recognition. You gave your life for it. Worth it's weight in gold. And growing empires and art collectors. And Alans sound investments. Will one day be forgotten. One day be forgotten, yeah."
world where you live,Here's someone now whose got the muscle. His steady hand could move a mountain. Expert in bed but come on now. There must be something missing. That golden one leads a double life. You'll find out. Tell me I don't know where you go. Do you climb into space. To the world where you live. The world where you live. And here we lie against each other. These four walls could never hold us. We're looking for wide open spaces. High above the kitchen. And we're strangers here. On our way to some other place. Tell me I don't know where you go. Do you climb into space. To the world where you live. The world where you live. The world where you live. When friends come round. You might remember and be sad. Behind their eyes is unfamiliar. Do you climb into space. To the world where you live. The world where you live....
you are the one to make me cry,"Who’ll face the tide. And take their chances. Will fasten the lights. To broken branches. Adrift on the ocean. In wild winter storms. I have to imagine things. To keep myself warm. The night closing in. But not to worry. Told everyone I know. That I was sorry. But I heard them all singing. For comfort and peace. And in my confusion here. I still believe. You were the one to make me cry. You were the one to take me home. Of all the people in my life. My thoughts keep returning to you. But consciousness is fading fast. Surrounded by sights. That go on living. Make circles in time. The spider web spinning. Well, I have no illusions. Of where I am now. I’ll let this wave take me. And pour me down. You were the one to make me cry. You were the one to take me home. Of all the stories in my life. Only good things return to you. If I could only say the words. If you could hear me cry for help. But I’d lift my head up to the sky. And the planes that were circling. Now have gone"
you can touch,It could spell my mere defeat. You could find it's what you need. And tears will fall and oceans will rise. I feel the fear and I know I'm alive. And you can touch me. I won't hide.

don't dream it's over,"There is freedom within, there is freedom without. Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup. There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost. But you'll never see the end of the road. While you're traveling with me. Chorus. Hey now, hey now. Don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now. When the world comes in. They come, they come. To build a wall between us. We know they won't win. Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof. My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof. In the paper today tales of war and of waste. But you turn right over to the T.V. page. Chorus. Hey now, hey now. Don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now. When the world comes in. They come, they come. To build a wall between us. We know they won't win. . Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum. And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart. Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof. Get to know the feeling of liberation and reliefs.. Chorus. Hey now, hey now. Don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now. When the world comes in. They come, they come. To build a wall between us. We know they won't win"
better be home soon,Somewhere deep inside. Something's got a hold on you. And it's pushing me aside. See it stretch on forever. I know I'm right. For the first time in my life. That's why I tell you. You'd better be home soon. Stripping back the coats. Of lies and deception. Back to nothingness. Like a weekend in the desert. I know I'm right. For the first time in my life. That's why I tell you. You'd better be home soon. So don't say no. Don't say nothing's wrong. Cos when you get back home. Maybe I'll be gone. It would cause me pain. If we were to end it. But I could start again. You can depend on it. I know I'm right. For the first time in my life. That's why I tell you. You'd better be home soon. That's why I tell you. You'd better be home soon

Making me feel like somebody special. Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep). Before it gets too late (just go to sleep). Doing damage to my brain. Well here we go again. Though I look everywhere. I never seem to find it. Always a shadow around a corner. Drown it in alcohol. Stuck in the elevator. Hard to remember in the morning. Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep). Before it gets too late (just go to sleep). Doing damage to my brain. Well here we go again. Tell you about myself. If you're in the mood to listen. Baby you don't know who you're kissing. This is a lonely world. You are a strange companion. When you get what you wanted. You want to leave. Honestly I want to free myself. From the burden of inaction. Honestly I want to raise myself. To any plane I can imagine. Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep). Before it gets too late (just go to sleep). Doing damage to my brain. Well here we go again.

four seasons in one day,"Four seasons in one day. Llying in the depths of your imagination. Worlds above and worlds below. Sun shine's on the black clouds hanging over the domain. Even when your feeling warm. The temperature could drop away. Like four seasons in one day. Smiling as the shit comes down. You can tell a man from what he has to say. Everything gets turned around. And I will risk my neck again, again. You can take me where you will. Up the creek and through the mill. Like all the things you can't explain. Four seasons in one day. Blood dries up. Like rain, like rain. Fills my cup. Like four seasons in one day. Doesn't pay to make predictions. Sleeping on an un-made bed. Finding out wherever there is comfort there is pain. Only one step away. Like four seasons in one day. Blood dries up. Like rain, like rain. Fills my cup. Like four seasons in one day."
saturday sun,"It’s a saturday sun. And the game is still on. And the waiting is done. It’s all about you. As he calls out your name. On a hill far away. Ravens circle above. It’s all about to change. He’s insane. Calling on the day. ��til the clouds get blown away. While inside his mind. Lie all of space and time. And the farthest ones unite. It’s a saturday sun. And the madness is won. And the night has been sung. Out of existence. And my head is alright. Was the darkest of nights. Now the cadmium sun. Is calling on the day. Til the clouds get blown away. There’s an eye inside his mind. For all of space and time. He’s been waiting for a sign. Looking for the revelation maybe. Or visions of the underworld. But when you saw the first light,. Then you know it’s alright. It’s a saturday sun. And the madness is won. And the nightmare is done. In time he wakes. Colours up the sky. Make the darkness come to life. Memories inside his heart. Of everything he wants to know. And every place he has to go"
mansion in the slums,"I'd much rather have a caravan in the hills. Than a mansion in the slums. The taste of success only lasts you. Half an hour or less. But it loves you when it comes. And you laugh at yourself. While you're bleeding to death. I'd much rather have a trampoline in my front room. Than an isolation tank. I wish I was a million miles away. From the manager's door. There is trouble at the bank. You laugh at yourself. As you go deep into debt. Laugh at yourself. While he's breathing down your neck. Who can stop me. With money in my pocket. Sometimes I get it free. The best of both worlds. I'd much rather have a caravan in the hills. I'd much rather have a mansion ... in the hills. Than a mansion in the slums. Yeah I'd much rather .... What I mean is, would you mind if I had it all. I'll take it when it comes. And you laugh at yourself. While you're bleeding to death. And somebody else is always. Breathing down your neck. Laugh at yourself. While he's hanging over your head. The best of both worlds. It'll soon be over."
i walk away,You came. Out of this world to me. My life. Parted like the Red Sea. We flowed. Easy between the rocks and stones. Never seemed to stop us. The years. Ended in confusion. Don't ask me I don't know what happened. But I am. A man with a mission. Must be the devil I don't know. It's hard to let go. Of all that we know. As I walk away from you. Hurled from my home. Into the unknown. As I walk away from you. Reveal whatever you desire. To you it may be death defying. Black day. In the coldness of winter. Black words. Slipping off my tongue. I say forget it - it's over. As a dark cloud covered up the sun. It's hard to let go. Of all that we know. As I walk away from you. The sun always sets. With room for regrets. As I walk away from you. Give it to me. Give it to me. Your inspiration. Give to receive. Find all we need. As I walk away. Just a slave to ambition. Tension your permanent condition. So much you've always wanted. Too much given' you a sore head.
something so strong,Love can make you weep. Can make you run for cover. Roots that spread so deep. Bring life to frozen ground. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. Turning in my sleep. Love can leave you cold. A taste of jealousy. Is like a lust for gold. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. I've been. Feeling so much older. Frame me. And hang me on the wall. I've seen. You fall into the same trap. This thing. Is happening to us all. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. Somthing so strong.....
hole in the river,"There's a hole in the river where my auntie lies. From the land of the living to the air and sky. Left her car by the river left her shoes beside. Through the thorns and the bushes I hope she was.... Dreaming of glory. Miles above the mountains and plains. Free at last. We were touched by a cold wind, my father and I. The sound of desperate breathing her fear inside us all. She was coming to see him but something changed her mind. Drove her down to the river. There is no return. There's a hole in the river where a memory lies. From the land of the living to the air and sky. She was coming to see him. But something changed her mind,. Drove her down to the river. There is no return."

In the bar of a small town hotel. You asked me what I was thinking. I was thinking of a padded cell. With a black and white T.V.. To stop us from getting lonely. I could not escape. A plea from the heart. You know what it means to me. She said don't walk away. I'm down on my knees. So please don't be mean to me. No, I could not escape. A plea from the heart. Mysterious sympathy.

everything is good for you,(Neil Finn). I see a man with a flag. and he leads the procession. and a woman shedding tears. for a man locked in prison. then the two locked eyes. and for a moment I was taken. and all paths lead. to a single conclusion. Everything is good for you. if it doesn't kill you. everything is good for you. one man's ending. is another man's beginning. everything is good for you. It's a nightmare talking. to a restless ocean. with a reckless calm. to state their position. but if you come undone. it might just set you free. Everything is good for you. if it doesn't kill you. everything is good for you. one man's ending. is another man's beginning. bring back your head. here comes trouble. to turn me and be well. cover your heart. everything is good for you. if it doesn't kill you.
never be the same,Don't stand around like friends at a funeral. Eyes to the ground. It could've been you. Why do you weep for the passing of ages. You slip with the back of your hand. You're taking it out on the one you love. I couldn't believe it. Chorus. But we might still survive. And rise up through the maze. If you could change your life. And never be the same.

Can I buy another cheap Picasso fake. Andy Warhol must be laughing in his grave. And dogs are on the road, we're all tempting fate. Cars are shooting by with no number plates.

Can I have another piece of chocolate cake. Kathy Straker boy could she lose some weight. Can I buy another slice of real estate. Liberace must be laughing in his grave."
distant sun,"Tell me all the things you would change. I don't pretend to know what you want. When you come around and spin my top. Time and again, time and again. No fire where I lit my spark. I am not afraid of the dark. Where your words devour my heart. And put me to shame, put me to shame. And your seven worlds collide. Whenever I am by your side. And dust from a distant sun. Will shower over everyone. You're still so young to travel so far. Old enough to know who you are. Wise enough to carry the scars. Without any blame, there's no one to blame. It's easy to forget what you learned. Waiting for the thrill to return. Feeling your desire burn. You're drawn to the flame. When your seven worlds collide. Whenever I am by your side. And dust from a distant sun. Will shower over everyone. Dust from a distant sun. Will shower over everyone. And I'm lying on the table. Washed out in the flood. Like a Christian fearing vengeance from above. I don't pretend to know what you want. But I offer love. Seven worlds collide. Whenever I am by your side. And dust from a distant sun. Will shower over everyone. As time slips by, and on and on."

don't stop now,"Another pleasant day in the countryside. Tears on a stormy night. You can’t follow my directions home. Don’t stop now. God knows where the satellite’s taking us. Who knows what is right in front of us. But I hang on every word. Don’t stop now. Well, don’t stop now. Give me something I can cry about. Get fooled by the lightning every time. See the afterimage of my outline. Then I turn the wrong way ‘round. Well, don’t stop now. No, don’t stop now. Give me something I can cry about. Give me something I can write about. The church just ten miles out of town. The devil gonna track me down. Travel through a tunnel. Remember that’s how you get to me. No number on the house. No birds are flying south. Sometimes you have to turn. The wrong way ‘round. And times you will return. To what you found. Give me something I can write about. All I want is something I can cry about"

fall at your feet,"I'm really close tonight. And I feel like I'm moving inside her. Lying in the dark. I think that I'm beginning to know her. Let it go. I'll be there when you call. Whenever I fall at your feet. And you let your tears rain down on me. Whenever I touch your slow turning pain. You're hiding from me now. There's something in the way that you're talking. The words don't sound right. But I hear them all moving inside you. Go, I'll be waiting when you call. Whenever I fall at your feet. And you let your tears rain down on me. Whenever I touch your slow turning pain. The finger of blame has turned upon itself. And I'm more than willing to offer myself. Do you want my presence or need my help. Who knows where that might lead. I fall at your feet. And you let your tears rain down on me. Whenever I fall."
falling dove,"All his life, blown by wildfire. Like a spark, cause and effect. One loose word, a revolution. One kind act, whole armies give thanks. Falling dove, born of ocean. Found by man, lived on his own. Lift a sail, tighten the knots. Lift him up, barely breathing. Falling dove. Do you believe in us. Like i believe in us. Is the outcome ever strange enough. You keep defending me. When I’m behaving badly. Because you love me. Because you love me too much. May the best of fortune bless you. Could any creature be unmoved. The humble nature of redemption. The simple act of finding a use. Hoping and almost praying. Believing for a moment its true. I made a rendezvous in moscow station. A midnight passenger, the café is closed. In st petersburg the door slides open. I’m a dead man till i see her walk through. Falling dove"

And all of your spells will break. So look out for number one. Fame is in your blood.
fingers of love,Can you imagine that. an itch too sensitive to scratch. the light that falls through the cracks. an insect too delicate to catch. I hear the endless murmur. every blade of grass that shivers in the breeze. and the sound that comes to carry me. across the land and over the sea.

four seasons in one day,"Four seasons in one day. Llying in the depths of your imagination. Worlds above and worlds below. Sun shine's on the black clouds hanging over the domain. Even when your feeling warm. The temperature could drop away. Like four seasons in one day. Smiling as the shit comes down. You can tell a man from what he has to say. Everything gets turned around. And I will risk my neck again, again. You can take me where you will. Up the creek and through the mill. Like all the things you can't explain. Four seasons in one day. Blood dries up. Like rain, like rain. Fills my cup. Like four seasons in one day. Doesn't pay to make predictions. Sleeping on an un-made bed. Finding out wherever there is comfort there is pain. Only one step away. Like four seasons in one day. Blood dries up. Like rain, like rain. Fills my cup. Like four seasons in one day."

hole in the river,"There's a hole in the river where my auntie lies. From the land of the living to the air and sky. Left her car by the river left her shoes beside. Through the thorns and the bushes I hope she was.... Dreaming of glory. Miles above the mountains and plains. Free at last. We were touched by a cold wind, my father and I.

I could feel you underneath my skin. As the wind rushed in. Sent the kitchen table crashing. She said nobody move. Or I'll bring the house down. I hardly know which way is up. Or which way down.

i walk away,You came. Out of this world to me. My life. Parted like the Red Sea. We flowed. Easy between the rocks and stones. Never seemed to stop us. The years. Ended in confusion. Don't ask me I don't know what happened. But I am. A man with a mission. Must be the devil I don't know. It's hard to let go. Of all that we know. As I walk away from you. Hurled from my home. Into the unknown. As I walk away from you. Reveal whatever you desire. To you it may be death defying. Black day. In the coldness of winter. Black words. Slipping off my tongue. I say forget it - it's over. As a dark cloud covered up the sun. It's hard to let go. Of all that we know. As I walk away from you. The sun always sets. With room for regrets. As I walk away from you. Give it to me. Give it to me. Your inspiration. Give to receive. Find all we need. As I walk away. Just a slave to ambition. Tension your permanent condition. So much you've always wanted. Too much given' you a sore head.

Be submissive just this once. Imagine there is something to be done. Some truth to tell. I would love. To trouble you in your time of need. Lose your way. It's a pleasure when you're in my command. Juggle like a diplomat. Struggle to hold onto your hat. Swinging like an acrobat. But time will tell. The clock is dripping on the wall. Listen to the rise and fall. Close your eyes and hear the call you know so well. Put on your wings. You're responsible for everything. Desolate in anger and safe in isolation. You're about to be the victim of a holy visitation. By the rites that I've been given. Put on your wings. You're not responsible for everything. I would love. To trouble you in your time of need. Lose your way. It's a pleasure when you're in my command. When you're in my command. In my command.
in the lowlands,"Oh hell trouble is coming. Out here in panic and alarm. Black shapes gather in the distance. Looks like it won't take long. The first drops land on the window. The first sign that there's something wrong. Light rain and a head full of thunder. Which way, which way. Two days till I get to you. I'll be late if I ever get through. Where I go there'll be no kind welcome. Coming down upon me. Time will keep me warm. Feel my face. Now the insects swarm. In the lowlands. Fear will take the place of desire. And we will fan the flames on high. Try for heavens sake. The sky fell underneath a blanket. The sun sank as the miles went by. Sit back with your head on the pillow.

Were expensive things he couldn't take with him. And my legs are gone. Coz I left them on the bar-room floor (bathroom ?). And the wise woman said. They'll be peace and contentment for sure. And my legs are gone. But there's one thing that I must do. Tell you I love you. Look at the ocean. And tell me it's not blue. Looks like summer, looks like summer. Looks like everything I knew. Caught on a bad day, caught on a bad day. Well I still want to be with you"

nails in my feet,"My life is a house. You crawl through the window. Slip across the floor and into the reception room. You enter the place of endless persuasion. Like a knock on the door. When there's ten or more things to do. Who is that calling?. You my companion. Run to the water on a burning beach. And it brings me relief. Pass through the walls. To find my intentions. Circle 'round in a strange, hypnotic state. I look into space. There is no connection. A million points of light. And a conversation i can't face. Cast me off one day. To lose my inhibition. Sit like a lap dog on a matron's knee. Wear the nails on your feet. I woke up the house. Stumbled in sideways. The lights went on and everybody screamed ""surprise!"". The savage review. It left me gasping. But it warms my heart to see that you can do it too. Total surrender. Your touch is so tender. Your skin is like water on a burning beach. And it brings me relief. Like a night in your mind. It brings me relief. In the back door. Under the stars. And the scenery is my floor. In the back room. Under the stars. And the scenery is my floor"
never be the same,Don't stand around like friends at a funeral. Eyes to the ground. It could've been you. Why do you weep for the passing of ages. You slip with the back of your hand. You're taking it out on the one you love. I couldn't believe it. Chorus. But we might still survive. And rise up through the maze. If you could change your life. And never be the same. How long must I wait. For you to release me. I pay for each mistake. While you suffer in silence. I could still have an easy life. But the lie ain't worth the living. Once more will I hear you say. chorus 2. That we might still survive. And rise up through the maze. If you could change your life. And never be the same. Don't stand around. Like friends at a funeral. Eyes to the ground. Don't suffer in silence. 'Cause we might still survive. And rise up through the maze. If you could change your life. And never be the same. And every time I hear you. Never be the same. And every time I mess up. Never be the same.
nobody wants to,Down on the ocean floor. That's where I'm heading for. Hold on to a sinking stone. Until the worst is known. Nobody wants to think about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody protects you. They make it go away. Pretending that it's all ok. Broken pieces on the ground. And everyone's tiptoeing round. Nobody wants to think about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody protects you... yeah. And we're losing some faith. We used to cry. We used to say why. For all I know. I might not get home. I found out. If you opened it up. We could work this out. Nobody wants to think about it. Nobody wants to talk about it now. What you suspected all along. Everything he told you was wrong. And you can see it if you want. Nobody wants to.

There’s an eye inside his mind. For all of space and time. He’s been waiting for a sign. Looking for the revelation maybe. Or visions of the underworld. But when you saw the first light,. Then you know it’s alright. It’s a saturday sun. And the madness is won. And the nightmare is done. In time he wakes. Colours up the sky. Make the darkness come to life. Memories inside his heart. Of everything he wants to know. And every place he has to go"

walked her way down,She walked her way down. It brought my mind back. From where I was trapped. How long will it take. For tension to break. Feel it sliding off. Shimmy-like cloth. I left on the ground. And I know what the answer is. And I’m happy to be here tonight. But when you’re in the moment. Everything you want is right. But before she takes a step.

She’s waiting for the beat to arrive. If you’re tamed by all the pressure. Everything you want to become. The drummer always comes in late. And my eyes are on the shake. That is captured in the light. And I want to feel the weightless grasp. Upon my heavy life

weather with you,Written By N. Finn & T. Finn. Walking 'round the room singing. Stormy Weather. at 57 Mt. Pleasant St.. Well it's the same room but everything's different. You can fight the sleep but not the dream. Things ain't cooking in my kitchen. Strange affliction wash over me. Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire. Couldn't conquer the blue sky. Well there's a small boat made of china. Is going nowhere on the mantlepiece. Well do I lie like a loungeroom lizard. Or do I sing like a bird released. CHORUS. Everywhere you go you always take the weather with you. (Repeat).
when you come,When you come across the sea. Me like a beacon guiding you to safety. The sooner the better now. And when you come the hils. Will breathe like a baby. Pulled up heaving from the bottom of the ocean. The sooner the better now. When you come to cover me with your kisses. Fresh like a daisy chained up in a lion's den. I'll know you by the thunderclap. Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions. And that is why. I stumble to my knees. And why underneath the heavens. With the stars burning and exploding. I know I could never let you down. When you come like an iceberg float in darkness. Smashing my hull send me to the bottom of the sea. I should know you better now. When you come your majesty to entrap me. Prince of light receding. The sooner the better now. And when you come to cover me. With your kisses hard like armour. The sooner the better now. I'll know you by the thunderclap. Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions. And that is why. I stumble to my knees. And why underneath the heavens. With the stars burning and exploding. I know I could never let you down. She came out of the water. Into my horizon. Like a cumulo nimbus. Coming in from a distance. Burning and exploding. Burning and exploding. Like a slow volcano. When you come. Cover the ground with ashes. When you come.
whether with you,Walking 'round the room singing. Stormy Weather. at 57 Mt. Pleasant St.. Well it's the same room but everything's different. You can fight the sleep but not the dream. Things ain't cooking in my kitchen. Strange affliction wash over me. Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire. Couldn't conquer the blue sky. Well there's a small boat made of china. It's going nowhere on the mantlepiece. Well do I lie like a loungeroom lizard. Or do I sing like a bird released. CHORUS. Everywhere you go you always take the weather with you. (Repeat).
whispers and moans,"Dull, dull grey. The colour of our times. Cool, cool space. That I still hope to find. Far beyond the veil. The sound of whispers and moans. Slow, time bomb. The clamour of the street. I hear this town. It never goes to sleep. And I will catch the taxi driver. Weeping like a wounded beast. Then I wake up in your room. To share one piece of your life. When tomorrow comes we may not be here at all. Without your whispers and moans. 'Cos here you come to carry me home. Here you come to carry me home. Love that sound. Time erase. Tension wheels. Cool heels. Won't ya come on open the bid 'fore too long. Then I wake up in your room. To share one piece of your life. I'd give anything to be a fly upon the wall. And hear your whispers and moans. I'd like to hear your whispers and moans. Here you come to carry me. We are the mirrors. Are the mirrors of each other in a lifetime of suspicion. Cleansed in a moment of recognition. You gave your life for it. Worth it's weight in gold. And growing empires and art collectors. And Alans sound investments. Will one day be forgotten. One day be forgotten, yeah."
world where you live,Here's someone now whose got the muscle. His steady hand could move a mountain. Expert in bed but come on now. There must be something missing. That golden one leads a double life. You'll find out. Tell me I don't know where you go. Do you climb into space. To the world where you live. The world where you live. And here we lie against each other. These four walls could never hold us. We're looking for wide open spaces. High above the kitchen. And we're strangers here. On our way to some other place. Tell me I don't know where you go. Do you climb into space. To the world where you live. The world where you live. The world where you live. When friends come round. You might remember and be sad. Behind their eyes is unfamiliar. Do you climb into space. To the world where you live. The world where you live....
you are the one to make me cry,"Who’ll face the tide. And take their chances. Will fasten the lights. To broken branches. Adrift on the ocean. In wild winter storms. I have to imagine things. To keep myself warm. The night closing in. But not to worry. Told everyone I know. That I was sorry. But I heard them all singing. For comfort and peace. And in my confusion here. I still believe. You were the one to make me cry. You were the one to take me home. Of all the people in my life. My thoughts keep returning to you. But consciousness is fading fast. Surrounded by sights. That go on living. Make circles in time. The spider web spinning. Well, I have no illusions. Of where I am now. I’ll let this wave take me. And pour me down. You were the one to make me cry. You were the one to take me home. Of all the stories in my life. Only good things return to you. If I could only say the words. If you could hear me cry for help. But I’d lift my head up to the sky. And the planes that were circling. Now have gone"
you can touch,It could spell my mere defeat. You could find it's what you need. And tears will fall and oceans will rise. I feel the fear and I know I'm alive. And you can touch me. I won't hide. You can touch me. I won't die. My condition is hard to define. I'm thin and pale and I need to unwind. See no future from where I stand. For the present I am in your hands. And you can touch me. I won't hide. You can touch me. I won't die. And tears will fall and oceans will rise. I feel the fear and I know I'm alive. It's only passing through. And you can touch me. I won't hide. You can touch me. I won't die. You can touch. I won't die
