the logical song,"When I was young. It seemed that life was so wonderful. A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical. And all the birds in the trees. Well they'd be singing so happily.

We'd like to feel you're. Acceptable, respectable, oh presentable, a vegetable. At night when all the world's sleep. The questions run so deep. For such a simple man. Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned. I know it sounds absurd. But please tell me who I am, who I am, who I am, who I am"

an awful thing to waste,"You say that you could do with a break. Had about all you can take. You need to find somewhere you can run to. Somewhere a long way from here. Somewhere where the skies are all clear. Somewhere you can think all your thoughts through. It took a long time to make me understand. You gotta meet life and shake it by the hand. You gotta use your emotion. You talk a nice line to put your mind at ease. You want to sit back and count your memories. But that's no solution. I don't want to harp about it. But what you gonna do about it?. Look at how you're set in your ways. You used to be so willing to face. Any kind of problem before you. Life is not as long as you think. Open up your mind and you'll see. Don't destroy yourself I implore you. You've got a fine wife, a perfect family. You had it all planned to live so carefully. But where does it get you. They say the mind is an awful thing to waste. And that's a fact that you must come to face. What more can I tell you?. I don't want to harp about it. But what you gonna do about it?. You have everything you that need. You only have to try to succeed. And realize it's all waiting for you. Living life this way is a bust. If you have to suffer you must. Don't you know we want to applaud you"

I can see it's not too good to me. To be afloat in the sea of glory. Babaji, oh how you comfort me. By showing me it's a different story. Your light in the dark is real. And I know that you know it is how I feel. When I see the reflections that's in your eyes. Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine to know?. Babaji, have you a song for me. To tell the world of its guardian angel. Bring it out so we can sing it out. Oh must you always remain a stranger?. At night when the stars are near. And I long for delusion to disappear.

I REALLY BELIEVE THAT I'M GLAD. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------. If you find some error in the lyrics,. would you please submit your corrections to me? Thank you.."
child of vision,"Well, who do you think you`re foolin`?. You say you`re havin fun,. But you`re busy going nowhere,. Just lyin in the sun.. You tried to be a hero,. commit the perfect crime. but the dollar got you dancing. and you`re running out of time.. You`re messin`up the water. You`re rollin`in the wine. You`re poisoning your body. You`re poisoning your mind. You gave me Coca-Cola. You said it tasted good. You watch the television. It tells you that you should. How can you live in this way ?. -(Why do you think it`s so strange ?). You must have something to say. -(Tell me why I should change ?). There must be more than this life.. It`s time we did something right.. Child of Vision, won`t you listen. Find yourself a new ambition.. I`ve heard it all before. You`re saying nothing new. I thought I saw a rainbow. but I guess it wasn`t true. You cannot make me listen. I cannot make you hear. You find your way to heaven. I`ll meet you when you`re there.. How can you live in this way?. -(Why do you think it`s so strange ?). You must have something to say. -(Tell me why I should change). We have no reason to fight. cos we both know that we`re right. Child of Vision, won`t you listen. Find yourself a new ambition.."

coming home to see you,"Now you're very much like your mother. And that's a natural fact. But you couldn't look much like your brother's wife. Or anyone like that. And you don't look much like your sister. 'Cause she's all big and fat. But don't breath a word to your mean old dad. 'Cause I'll be coming back. I'm coming home to see you early in the morning. I'll be around and on the first train today. I'm coming home to see you while day's dawning. All aboard, all aboard. Put on some fancy clothes and meet me at the station. Make sure I don't mistake you for your sister Jane. Don't want to see you with your goddamn relations. That's all for now, I'll se you, ciao."
crazy,"Here´s a little song to make you feel good. Put a little light in your day. These are crazy times. And it´s all been getting pretty serious. Here´s a little song to make you feel right. Send the blues away. Well it´s a crazy game. Tell me who´s to blame, i´m kind a curious. Right if you win,wrong if you lose. Nobody listens when you´re singing the blues. Well something´s the matter. But nothing gets done. Oh everyone´s waiting for a place in the sun. Well something is wrong now. Can something be wrong with me. Oh brother,why´s it got to be so crazy. Gimme little left, gimme little right. Gimme little black, gimme little white. Gimme little peace, gimme little hope. Gimme little light. ´cause you know it seems. That the situation´s getting serious. Right if youe win, wrong if you lose. Nobody listens when you´re singing the blues.... Oh, something is wrong with me. Oh, brother, why´s it got to be this crazy..."
crime of the century,"Now they're planning the crime of the century. Well what will it be?. Read all about their schemes and adventuring. Yes, It's well worth the fee. So roll up and see. How they rape the universe. How they've gone from bad to worse. Who are these men of lust, greed, and glory?. Rip off the masks and let's see.. But that's no right - oh no, what's the story?. But there's you and there's me. That can't be right"
dead man's blues,". Goin' through my life, day by day. Wonderin' why and what road it'll take. Sometimes low and sometimes high. Tryin' find a reason to live by. Well I've been seaching far and wide. Over the water beyond the sky. And I've been watching the moon above. Smiling down at me, what's he thinkin' of. What's he thinkin' way up in the sky. Bet he could tell me where my future lies. There ain't no promise, or guarantee. Ain't no wisdom being laid on me. And it's a low down dirty shame. But I gotta find the answer just the same. I ain't foolin' around. Nobody cares. I got a feelin'. Oh I'm going to find it .... Uhuh. Woo hoo hoo. Well I've been playin' the Dead Man's Blues. And now I need a drink, it's going to be on you. The day of judgement ain't far away. But who'll be the judge, it's hard to say.... Mnnn.. yeah that's hard to say...."
don't leave me now,Don't leave me now. Leave me out in the pouring rain. With my back against the wall. Don't leave me now. Don't leave me now. Leave me out with nowhere to go. And the shadows start to fall. Don't leave me now. Don't leave me now. Leave me out on this lonely road. As the wind begins to howl. Don't leave me now. Don't leave me now. All alone on this darkest night. Feeling old and cold and grey. Don't leave me now. Don't leave me now. Leave me holding an empty heart. As the curtain starts to fall. Don't leave me now. Don't leave me now. All alone in this crazy world. When I'm old and cold and grey and time is gone....

downstream,"Took a boat Sunday, down by the sea. It just felt so nice, you and me. We didn't have a problem or a care. And all around was silence, everywhere. You are the reason I was born. Be with you through all seasons. I'll always hear you when you call. To keep the love light shining. Through each night and day. A lonely life behind you. Oh what a change you've made. And down here on the ocean we will stay. Went through a lot of changes. Turned a lot of pages. When I took a boat Sunday. To know you as I know you now. That is all I need. And we will get along somehow. If we both believe. So down here on the ocean we will stay. Went through a lot of changes. Turned a lot of pages. When I took a boat Sunday"

easy does it,"And if my thoughts had wings,. I'd be the bird that sings,. I'd fly where love isn't shy. And everyone is willing to try.. And if we had the time,. And time's so hard to find,. I can't believe what you say,. Start sending those shadows away,. And if you know who you are,. You are your own superstar,. And only you can shape the movie that you make,. So when the lights disappear;. And only the silence disappears,. And only the silence is near,. Watch yourself; easy does it, easy while you wait.. And if you know who you are,. You are your own superstar. And only you can shape the music that you make.. So when the crowds disappear,. And only the silence is here. Watch yourself, easy does it, easy does it, easy while you wait."
even in the quietest moments,"Even in the quietest moments. I wish I knew what I had to do. And even though the sun is shining. Well I feel the rain --- here it comes again, dear. And even when you showed me. My heart was out of tune. For there's a shadow of doubt that's not letting me find you too soon. The music that you gave me. The language of my soul. Oh Lord, I want to be with you.. Won't you let me come in from the cold?. Don't you let the sun fade away. Don't you let the sun fade away. Don't you let the sun be leaving. Won't you come to me soon. And even though the stars are listening. And the ocean's deep, I just go to sleep. And then I create a silent movie. You become the star, is that what you are, dear?. Your whisper tells a secret. Your laughter brings me joy. And a wonder of feeling I'm Nature's own little boy. But still the tears keep falling. They're raining from the sky. Well there's a lot of me got to go under before I get high. Don't you let the sun disappear. Don't you let the sun disappear. Don't you let the sun be leaving. No, you can't be leaving my life. Say that you won't be leaving my life. Say that you won't be leaving my life. Say won't you please, stay won't you please. Say won't you please, stay won't you please. Lord, won't you come and get into my life. Lord, won't you come and get into my life. Say won't you please, stay won't you please. Say won't you please, stay won't you please. Lord, don't go. And even when the song is over. Where have I been --- was it just a dream?. And though your door is always open. Where do I begin --- may I please come in, dear?."
ever open door,"Sharing's good, sharing's fine. But no one wants to share this world of mine. Is dull, dark and grey. And no one wants to find the way. To my front door is always open to you. Hey now life, give me a break. For much more of this I cannot. Take me to a far off place. Where there's no rich or poor. And every house has got an ever open door. I want to find my direction. I want my love and affection. Yes I'm needing it more and more. I want to find my own answers. it's time I knew what my plans were. I'm going to find out what I'm looking for. I'm gonna take all my chances. Gonna make my advances. Gonna see what my life has in store. I've got a feeling inside me. I'll put the past way behind me. Pick myself up from the floor. I want my sun in the morning. Want my friends to come calling. I'll keep a welcome outside my door."
fool's overture,"History recalls how great the fall can be. While everybody's sleeping, the boats put out to sea. Born on the wings of time. It seemed the answers were so easy to find. ""Too late"", the prophets cry. The island's sinking, let's take to the sky. Called the man a fool, striped him of his pride. Everyone was laughing up until the day he died. And though the wound went deep. Still he's calling us out of our sleep. My friends, we're not alone. He waits in silence to lead us all home. So tell me that you find it hard to grow. Well I know, I know, I know. And you tell me that you've many seeds to sow. Well I know, I know, I know. Can you hear what I'm saying. Can you see the parts that I'm playing. ""Holy Man, Rocker Man, Come on Queenie,. Joker Man, Spider Man, Blue Eyed Meanie"". So you found your solution. What will be your last contribution?. ""Live it up, rip it up, why so lazy?. Give it out, dish it out, let's go crazy,. Yeah!"""

free as a bird,When a spirit is broken. Why go on. When there's nothing to say. And a love just a token. It was strong. Now it's fading away. Ah but I'm free as a bird. As I walk right out that door. You have my word. I won't bother you no more. Yes I'm doing alright. As I face the lonely night. And our love it was over. Long ago. But we just didn't say. And the years they have fallen. One by one. How they drifted away. But now I'm free as a bird. As I walk out that door. You have my word. I won't bother you no more. Yes I'm feeling OK. As I face the brand new day. As I face the brand new day. You know I'm free as a bird. As I walk right out that door. You have my word. I won't bother you no more. Yes I'm doing alright. As I face the lonely night. As I face the lonely night. No more sorrows will I find. I've got tomorrow on my side. No more teardrops will I cry. Left my teardrops way behind. No more sorrows will I find. I've got tomorrow on my side. No more teardrops will I cry. Left my teardrops way behind. No more heartaches bother me. Don't wear my heartaches on my sleeve. It's gonna be a brand new story. What's the use of former glory. It's better not to do if you can't do right. It's time to get to celebrating. After all the years of waiting. I'm gonna have a ball if it takes all night
friend in need,"Hey buddy want to talk to you. 'Bout a friend in need, a friend indeed. I hear you got a few friends too. Live up the stairs, selling their wears. And they don't care, 'cause they don't know that. Oooh he's very lonely. Oooh he's lost his one and only. Woman that he's ever had. He sure feels bad, can you make him glad?. Hey mister can you help him out?. Can you put him straight, before it gets too late. And show what it's all about. Hey mister well he's got the dough. How much will it be, to pay the fee?. I guess that you can see through me. So I'll be straight with you, I'll tell the truth. Friend in need is just really me."
from now on,"Monday has come around again. I'm in the same old place. With the same old faces always watching me. Who knows how long I'll have to stay. Could be a hundred years. Of sweat and tears. At the rate that I get paid. Sometimes I slowly drift away. From all the dull routine. That's with me every day. A fantasy will come to me. Diamonds are what I really need. Think I'll rob a store, escape the law. And live in Italy. Lately my luck has been so bad. You know the roulette wheel's. A crooked deal. I'm loosing all I had. Soon be like a man that's on the run. And live from day to day. Never needing anyone. Play hide and seek. Throughout the week. My life is full of romance. Guess I'll always have to be. Living in a fantasy. That's the way it's got to be. From now on. You think I'm crazy I can see. It's you for you, and me for me. Living in a fantasy. From now on."
get your act together,"You say you're so tired, you're never satisfied. But I can't seem to make you understand. I see your point of view, but life's been to good to you. Just stand up and face things like a man. You better get your act together. If you ever wanna take it on the road. You can't sit around. Or the bad times are gonna get to you. And you're never gonna see it through. I know, that things don't seem so good right now. But you gotta move along some how. Try to do the best you can. Sure nuff, thins will slowly turnaround. You won't always be so down. I know that it's true. It won't always be such stormy weather. It may be a cliche but the sun is gonna shine. So you can't sit around. Or the bad times are gonna get to you. And you're never gonna see it through. It don't matter where you've been. It's where you're going to. Yeah, and it won't do you no good. Just livin' in the past. You know you can't sit around. 'Cos the bad times are gonna get to you. And you're never gonna see it through. And they're never ever gonna go. Yeah, they'll be here to stay.

give me a chance,In time this fire will turn to ashes. The sun will fall out the sky. Still you see no urgency. To spend some time with me. Time with me. I can't believe you haven't noticed. Just how long I've been waitin' for you. I've been such a patient man. But I still don't understand. You won't. Give me a chance to show how much I love you. Give me a chance to show how much I care. How I care. It's hard to know just what you're thinkin'. You cloak yourself in mistery. Conversations always brief. Like a sigh with no relief. You won't. Give me a chance to show how much I love you. Give me a chance to show how much I care. Give me a chance to show how much I love you. if you dare. You gotta give me a chance to show how much I love you. Give me a chance to show how much I care. Give me a chance to show how much I love you. Give me a chance.
goldrush,. Bless my heart and soul. I've discovered gold. Spread the news around. Get the ship afloat. A rock and roll the boat. Let's get into town. I am living down by the creek. Getting mired in the mud. No liquor for a week. I feel the cold in my blood. Here's a very busy lady. On her knees in the sludge. Well I do believe she's crazy. You know she's working like a drudge. Bless my heart and soul. She's discovered gold. Spread the news around. Get the ship afloat. A rock and roll the boat. And let's get into town. Even though she smelt like a drain. She's an angel to me. Her intentions are plain. And the whiskey is free. Breaking out another bottle. Keep it cool in the dirt. Well it's a water baby heaven. I got the papers in my shirt. Bless my heart and soul. We've discovered gold. Spread the news around. Get the ship afloat. A rock and roll the boat. And let's get into town. Bless my heart and soul. We've discovered gold. Spread the news around. Get the ship afloat. A rock and roll the boat. And let's get into town. You work hard all your life little honey. But you can't afford to save any money. You lay it down you leave the town. To see what you could find. For more than 20 years you're a diggin'. Then you can't believe what you are a pickin'. It's a piece of change just like a mountain range. Whoopee we're gonna lay it down.

In the light of cloudy days. Or in circles where you hide from view. All the dust that ever bothered you. And where people loose your name"

I was pretty sure that you would come along. Thought that I would be your man. But now I never know just where I stand. With you. Where I stand with you. Just where I stand, where I stand. Where I stand with you. I never know, you had to go. Where I stand with you. You broke my heart. It came apart. Where do I stand with you?. Where I stand. Where I stand. Where I stand with you"
where there's a will,"Where there's a will, there's a way. Or so they say. A friend in need is a friend indeed. He'll be there every day. And if it's trouble that's in store. You know they'll tell you even more. Where there's a will, there's a way. That's what thet'll say. When the writing is on the wall. And if you could fall. When your best ain't good enough. And life's tough. When the lad of hope and dreams. Isn't always what it seems. Where there's a will, there's a way. They always say. You may be sorry, you may be sad, you may be blue. You think you'll never see the sun come breaking thru. You struggle morning noon and night. And you still I can't get it right. But where there's a will, there's a way. Just say it every day. Well so much for trouble, so much for heartache. so much for pain. You just gotta get up, you just gotta reach out. You gotta try and try again. You think you'll never see it thru. But what the hell you gonna do. Where there's a will, there's a way. You've heard'em say. Well I don't no nothing 'bout this world. and all it's wrong. I can tell you now,. why we all can't get along. But after all is said and done. We gootta keep on, keepin' on. 'Cos where there's a will, there's a way. I don't know what to say. Thru all your sorrows. all your dreams, and all your joys. In times of sadness,. in time of grief. and even times that you enjoy. As your life you live it through. You know it all depends on you. And if where there's a will, there's a way. You better get down and pray. From the cradle to the grave. You better say it every day. When the crime's above the law. When the plane's about to fall. When the mighty oceans roar. When tomorrow's at your door. Where there's a will, there's a way. That's what they'll say."
words unspoken,"Why sing a lonely song. The whole world knows that love goes wrong. Why bruise a heart that isn't broken. It isn't broken. It can be broken. Life's just a show for free. Come along and watch with me. The only sins are words unspoken. Words unspoken, never spoken. Sweet things come and go. Give me shame, I'll give you woe. To live for love isn't so easy. It isn't easy, it won't be easy. How all good men try. Look around and wonder why. Can they shape this world to please me. Can they please me, should they please me. And follow, and maybe you'll correct me. I wish you'd never met me. For I am no gentle man. Follow and while you watch and wonder. I pull the world asunder. And show you who I am. Send me a gentle dream. Of love so strange it's never seen. And prove how such a love can happen. It can happen, make it happen. Fine things don't abound. Fade away without a sound. But hope must never end or slacken. Never slacken, never slacken. And follow and maybe you'll correct me. I wish you'd never met me. I am no gentle man. Follow and while you watch and wonder. I'll pull the world asunder. And show you who I am"
you never can tell with friends,"Yes I've been waiting, but you just don't come around. You've been dropping in on, everyone all over town. Say what you like, but you just don't know your place. And everywhere we go, people seem to know your face. You've been checkin' out the scene, every single night. Never knowing where you've been, you say it's alright. I placed all my faith in you, and you let me down. Everything I say is true, but you don't hear a sound. Yeh you ought to be ashamed, but you don't accept the blame. They said it was too late, for your love. They said it was too late, you're gonna go. They said I was too late, for your love. They said I was too late, you're gonna go. You never can tell with friends. You never can tell with. You never can tell with. You never can tell with friends. You never can tell with. You never can tell with. Yes every now and then, my mind turns things around. And I believe it's true, that our love can still be found. Just one thing I care about, from sea to shinging sea. And you know that's the love you give, the love you give to me. You've been checkin' out the scene, every single night. Never knowing where you've been, you say it's alright. I placed all my faith in you, then you let me down. Everything I say is true, but you don't hear a sound. Yeh you ought to be ashamed, but you don't accept the blame. They said it was too late, for your love. They said it was too late, you're gonna go. They said I was too late, for your love. They said It was too late, you're gonna go.

you started laughing,"When you're in heaven. What you gonna do?. You're gonna sit around a cloud and say. ""Hey what a lovely view"". Is there a reason. Why you're like you are?. Is there a reason you'll be leaving?. Is my love out of season?. I wouldn't mind but to me that is treason. You started laughing. When I held you in my arms. You started leaving. When I told you of my charms. I was in love with you. And then you said we're through. And then I said boo hoo. Was my tie not on straight?. Was it something I ate?"
"you win, i lose","You win, I lose. I beg, you choose. You're so cool and I'm confused. I'm me and you're you. You're so loose and I'm uptight. You're day, I'm night. Like two ships in the night in foggy weather,. Just a waitin' for fresh winds to blow.. Maybe we're losin' one another. I could be wrong I don't know. You get the best, I get the rest. You pass the test, I'm just a mess. You got it made, I'm in the shade. Like two ships in the night .... Like two dopes in the boat, without a paddle. Just a wonderin' why it don't go. We could be losin' one another. I could be wrong I don't know. I know you're tryin' to phase me. It's gonna drive me crazy. I can't wait for the day when. I win, You lose. You beg and I choose. You're in the shade, I'm on parade. Like two ships in the night ...."
your poppa don't mind,"Give it a whirl, give it a try. Why don't you sleep out, start living high?. You're on your own, you make your bed. No time for wasting, just look ahead. Your poppa don't mind what you do or say. You can't surprise him anymore. He's got a reputation that he don't look back. Your poppa don't mind at all. He's getting old, it's getting late. It's soon tomorrow, so celebrate. Bring it out and go to town. Before you're thinkin' of settling down. Your poppa don't mind what you do or say. You can't surprise him anymore. He don't believe in heaven like a good man should. Your poppa don't mind at all. Finding out is half the fun. And when you find out don't try to run. And if you know then you've begun. But if you don't know it's still to come. Your poppa don't mind what you do or say. You can't surprise him anymore. He talks about his women and his old school's tie. Your poppa don't mind at all. Your poppa don't mind what you do or say. You can't surprise him anymore. He don't believe in heaven like a good man should. Your poppa don't mind at all. Your poppa don't mind at all. Your poppa don't mind at all."
