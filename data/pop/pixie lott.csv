And the way it hides all the things I like. Little black butterflies. Deep inside me. What would my mama do. If she knew ‘bout me and you?. What would my daddy say. If he saw me hurt this way?. Why should I feel ashamed?. Feeling guilty at the mention of your name. Here we are again. It's nearly perfect. What would my mama do. If she knew ‘bout me and you?. What would my daddy say. If he saw me hurt this way?. What would my mama do. What would my daddy say. All the things a girl should know. Are the things she can't control. All the things a girl should know. She can't control. What would my mama do. If she knew ‘bout me and you?. What would my daddy say. If he saw me hurt this way?

everybody hurts sometimes,"I don't know how to turn it all around. When I feel hopeless. Can't see my way out. Now I'm so low how will I ever get back up. When I am broken. And I've just had enough. Pick up the pieces and I'll put myself back together. Crying it out there’s no doubt that this got to get better. [chorus]. And it’s alright. To go in and let you’re tears fall down. When everything crashes to the ground. And it’s alright. No one ever makes it out alive. Everybody hurts sometimes. T-I-I-I-I-I-I-mes. It’s so hard not to let emotion burge. Turn my head upside down on a thread, huhu. Cut me loose so I can stanch fade up again. I feel love is bitter empty space. Pick up the pieces and I’ll put myself back together. Crying it out there’s no doubt that this got to get better. [chorus]. And it’s alright. To go in and let you’re tears fall down. When everything crashes to the ground. And it’s alright. No one ever makes it out alive. Everybody hurts sometimes. T-I-I-I-I-I-I-mes. Sometimes. T-I-I-I-I-I-I-mes. So when you’re stuck and can’t move on. You’re allowed to cry, we all get hurt sometimes. And it’s alright. To go in and let you’re tears fall down. When everything crashes to the ground (no, no, no). And it’s alright. No one ever makes it out alive. Everybody hurts sometimes. T-I-I-I-I-I-I-mes. Sometimes. T-I-I-I-I-I-I-mes. Ooh wooow sometimes ooh"

leaving you,"Life is cruel, these circumstances. Why were there chances. I'd fought so hard for you. The times not right. And we both know it. But you're not to show it. Peeling apart slowly from you. Kissing me so sweetly, a taste of margarita. I won't forget that day. You're the one I dreamed of. Always be my first love. But you know that I can't stay. And I'll never get over. Leaving you, you. It's the hardest thing I'll ever do. Lazy days, spent in the sunshine. Drinking rosé wine. Feeling so easy with you. Late night walks, talking together. Hoping forever, wouldn't be coming so soon. Letting go of someone. I don't wanna part from. I won't forget today. Everything I dreamed of. So glad your my first love. But you know that I can't stay. And I'll never get over. Leaving you, you. But I know it's what I gotta do. And I'll never get over. Leaving you, you. It's the hardest thing I'll ever do. Maybe some day. Our roads will cross again. Don't say it's the end. Maybe some day, but until then. And I'll never get over. Leaving you, you. It's the hardest thing I'll ever do. But I know it's what I gotta do. And I'll never get over. Leaving you, you. It's the hardest thing I'll ever do. I gotta leave you baby. Though it hurts me. And I'll never get over this. And when it hurts, it hurts. It's killng me, it's kiling me"

love you more,You said when you were laying in my bet. That you wanted something different right now. Last night I roll over to your side. Only to find you are not around. After cry disappear and ..over. After searching the streets checking where you are. I realized you made the biggest mistake of your life. Cause no one is gonna love you more than me. No now is gonna see in you what I see. Every bit of my heart believes no one is gonna love you more. How come it feels like I lost my right arm. I cannot even function right now. Will you like .. time for you. Will you change my last name if you ask me too. You realized you made the biggest mistake of your life. Cause no one is gonna love you more than me. No now is gonna see in you what I see. Every bit of my heart believes no one is gonna love you more. I will never be yours and no one is gonna love you more. You can kiss every girl from new york to japan. You can search the whole end but you will not fine the one. To love you like I do. To love you like I do. Cause no one is gonna love you more. Cause no one is gonna love you more than me. No now is gonna see in you what I see. Every bit of my heart believes no one is gonna love you more
love you to death,"I bring out the best in you. But you bring out the worst in me. There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you. But you don't give me anything. Wish that I was strong enough to weather the storm. My friends are saying they don't recognize me from before. When I say I'll leave, you don't believe me anymore. Chorus. Cause you know that I'll always be there. Maybe that's why you don't care. So just take it all and watch how I fall. Always thinking you'll catch me. You are killing me slowly. I keep holding my breath cause I love you to death. I love you to death, I love you to death. You're the reason I still hope. You're the reason I still joke. You used to be in love, would take my hurt away. But now you love to watch me break. How am I supposed to leave if you refuse to let me go?. Don't know how I ever let you have so much control. Everytime you're feeling high you make me feel so low. Chorus. Everytime you come back, I believe it. But I know that you don't really mean it. You're so good being bad that I buy it. Everytime you come around. You're the reason I still hope. You're the reason I still joke. Chorus"

ocean,"There's an ocean pouring from my eyes. Built a boat and catched the rising tide. I'm so over yesterday, now just watch me sail away. On this ocean, oh the tears I cried.

Now I've gotta kiss it all goodbye. There's an ocean falling from my eyes. One emotion rising like the tide. And there's nothing I can say. As I watch you drift away. On this ocean, every tear I cried. Look what love did to me. I'm lucky to get out alive. The wound goes so deep. I took a bullet when you left my life. The echo's on my mind forever. I thought we would stay together. Now I've gotta kiss it all goodbye. There's an ocean falling from my eyes. One emotion rising like the tide. And there's nothing I can say. As I watch you drift away. On this ocean, every tear I cried. Can't stop this ocean of my tearsdrops. Rise up. There's an ocean falling from my eyes. One emotion since we said goodbye. I'm so over yesterday, now just watch me sail away. On this ocean, every tear I cried. Forever, together. Forever, we were, we were together. (I thought we would stay together)"
one more chance,"The engine goes the plane whistles down the pilot gives up hope.. He knows his chances are slim when he hits the ground.. As the women screams in the burning house the smoke engulfs around.. She slowly knows there's no exits to be found.. As they realise there's no compromise, no more love left gotta go.. Before they close their eyes, they shout up to the skies.. Give me one more chance before you bring me down.. Give me one more chance to show you.. Give me one more try to turn my life around.. Give me one more chance and I'll show you.. The car has turned and slowly burns there's leaking fuel around.. The drivers trapped and awakes to the siren sound.. He panics first and expects the worst tries to reach out for his phone.. To tell his wife and kids he wont be home.. Give me one more chance before you bring me down.. Give me one more chance to show you.. Give me one more try to turn my life around.. Give me one more chance I'll show you.. The pilot smiles and wonders why the engines just came on?. The flight subsides with relief she cries and the fireman stands alone.. A hand comes through and pulls him out before he has a chance to make the call.. Give him one more chance to prove that he was wrong.. Give me one more chance before you bring me down.. Give me one more chance to show you. (before you bring me down). Give me one more try to turn my life around. (to turn my life around). Give me one more chance I'll show you. x2"

paper planes,"I'm pouring my heart out. Leaving almost nothing for myself. You're looking in my eyes. Why do I feel your mind is somewhere else?. Our love is delicate as butterfly wings. But still we fight about the silliest things. I hate it when we do, so I keep forgiving you. Over and over again. CHORUS. And we're flying on paper planes. Hoping It don't rain on my parade. When I'm with you it's strange. I make it as a fane hoping that the wind don't change. Oh oh oh oh. Woah oh oh. Woah oh oh. It's danger when you fall out. I never learn to walk before I run. It's too easy to fall out. I'll push away the clouds to see the sun. As beautiful as the song the nightingale sings. It's nothing compared to the joy you bring. This river that love is, I try to swim in. Am I in over my head?. CHORUS. Oh oh oh oh. Woah oh oh. Woah oh oh. I'm scared to fall, cause we're so high. And it's a long way down from here. But if we're strong, if we try. We can touch the sky. CHORUS. Oh oh oh oh. Woah oh oh. Woah oh oh"

To even think that you're in with a chance.. Oh, you must be tripping boy,. Oh, you're my whipping boy.. Not with that chat,. That's not where it's at.. I'm just a little bit more particular.. You turn up all uninvited, no surprises;. 'Cos my memory.. It serves me well, just laugh again. You did the same thing that you always did.. Hammering me with phone calls, texts and downloads..

You make over perfect. In you eyes are the colours. That you hide I discover. Little things that blow me away. I love your voice. Makes me shiver. And the chills you deliver. I wanna see. Your face everyday. As long as I breathe. I'm breathing for you. As long as I see. I'm looking for you. You don't even know. How much you deserve it. You make worth it. You make over perfect.

Throw your hands in the air, cause we're young, we don't care. Oh don't forget this, we can be reckless. Throw your heartache away, we can live for today. Baby, I'll show you how to roll. Throw your hands in the air, cause we're young, we don't care. Oh don't forget this, we can be reckless. Feel that sun on my face, let's go back to that place. Where everyone would let it go and Stevie is on the radio. Highway patrol through them skybergs. We'll take a detour around the bonfire. Turn a simple ride into a good rush. There's no way barricades are gonna ruin the fun. We could be in for a long night. …... and I'm alright. I feel like the new Bonnie & Clyde. Get your feet upon the dash and just enjoy the ride. And I'll be playing your favorite song, yeah. Screwing up the words to you, sing along. Front mirror is pedaled down to the floor. I'm gon' ride with you until the wheels fall. CHORUS"
the one,When I look into your eyes. I don't see the light at all. You used to be so beautiful. But I know that things have changed. We're only going round and round. Stuckin' in an empty place.

It's be cruel to be kind. Cause I've already been with you for way too long. If I am not the one. Promises are hard to keep. The emptiness is hard to bear. When you know that if you reach a little deeper nothing's there. Nothing's gonna make it right. We're only gonna make it hurt. We're only gonna make it worse. If I am not the one. Why we holding on. What's the point in all this time. Just to find. There's nothing here between us. If it's not for life. It's be cruel to be kind. Cause I've already been with you for way too long.
