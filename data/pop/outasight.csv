Yeah summit' really changed from the way I walked in. to a Brand new Day. Aberration and hating have a very thin line of separation. Either way you wanted a conversation. So my dialect the original, a language untainted. When my names come up, no-one sends me on my way. And I follow my own directions my own road I never sway. It was too simple to stop fussing over what's expected. It was to easy to stand alone and feel so neglected. And I don't feel the same.

Dreams of living. plus me lavish generated from magazines, TV screens. Seemed to be the only thing that matters at me fearing average. And when the sun starts to close a number in falls. I hear the echoes of my love, melting down the halls. It's too better to out-beat this under of depressin'. I'm looking in these notebooks and I'm regressing. whilst I was dressin'. And I don't feel the same. I know summit' really changed from the way I walked in. to a Brand new Day. And I don't feel the same.

hell yea,"I'm just a simple man. Doing the best I can. Up there are campers in their bed. I hit this open road. It's like a rollercoaster. I don't know how to steer. Got money, but I ain't got time. Tryin' to quit both, but I dropped the line. Don't worry girl, you're on my mind today. Had soul from the very start. Can you lead a revolution with a broken heart. And everyone asked if Ima be your king. Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh. Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh. I got fresh bread chops, a couple of bucks. And I just don't give a f*ck. Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh. Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh. Well it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at. And I'm never looking back. Our only witness is the empty sky. Late nights and early flights. He's gonna catch up to me. My only sleep is on the plane. Just out somewhere unknown. Speeding through dusty roads. We make our way through pouring rain. Got love but I ain't got time. Shine... it'll please my mind. Don't worry about me, I'm fine my friend. I'll say uh huh. Had soul from the very start. Can you lead a revolution with a broken heart. Only one way to find out, so sing. Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh.

Well it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at. And I'm never looking back now. Our only witness is the empty sky. Only bags I got are under my eyes. Guess I gotta look on the bright side. On the pool side sipping Mai Thais. Pelegrino out in Reno, sunset, skylines. Spend a week in the Palm Spring Army. Got a car with no roof to see the palm trees. Couple pretty girls, all they wanna do is party. Another morning, I'm walking 'round like a f*cking zombie. So what, hurting only gets better. Only need a couple friends, and good weather. Roof top, red cups, better last forever. Let the good times roll like I landed on something. Headcrack, that's me at the table. At the Tropicano, with the limo, out waiting. Living every day like I'm on vacation. And if you wanna ride, start singing. Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh. Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh. I got fresh bread chops, a couple of bucks. And I just don't give a f*ck. Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh. Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh. Well it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at. And I'm never looking back now. Our only witness is the empty sky. Let me sing it again now. Our only witness is the empty sky"
i'll drink to that,"Walking through the rain trying to clear my head. The city never sleeps, but I'll find me a bed. And close my eyes and try to escape. All the lonely nights and the minimum wage.

Weight is off our shoulders. I'll drink to that. I'll drink to that. I'll drink to that. Now I'm walking through the town that made me a man. Everyone here tries the best that they can.

You better pick me up, pick me up, pick me up. If I fall down. Welcome to my story. Before the songs before the glory. There was a boy, didn't count as boring. Who let go with the fear he's holding. Walk down of all his classes. Followed his so-called passion. Everyone said he was crazy. And they were right but that was back then. I'm sure you know the feeling. when your hands reach the ceiling. I'm losing all my worries. This sky is in the hurries. Ya back on the chase. Once in a bill, gotta slow your pace. Take a look around. and appreciate all the good things that come to those. Who wait. Running and running. But I'm already here. Waiting for something but for what it's not clear. Running and running but I'm never scared. You better pick me up, pick me up, pick me up. If I fall down.

life or something like it,"I think my timing right. They saying it's important that I live up to the hype. I don't give in to the fame or fall into a vice. So lemme shine a light on who is Outasight. Used to hop up on the train with nothing really doing. This path that I'm pursuing, well I didn't really chose it. It actually chose me but easily confusing. And I made some mistakes but to error is human. Wake up in the morning and all alone. Every single night somewhere unknown. Been around the world but can't find home. You don't know what you got oh till it's gone. When you watch the clock, those days get long. Wish I could help but you're on your own, you don't know. What you wanting, what you getting. are two different things most of the time. What you ask for, what you needing. hope you getting yours 'cause I'm getting mine.

And no one is behind you 'cause they never really loved you. Not gonna raise my voice or even start a scuffle. Under pressure I don't buckle, just belt songs so what up?. With your mumbling and grumbling, I'd hate to be a fuck up. And I played my cards right and it don't seem like my luck up. Yet wake up in the morning on the wrong side of bed. Bunch of missed calls, inbox at the brim. One day the future bright, the next it feels dim. You don't know what you got oh till it's gone. Three hours sleep but I party till dawn. Hit the snooze a couple times, kill the alarm, you don't know. What you wanting, what you getting. are two different things most of the time. What you ask for, what you needing. hope you getting yours 'cause I'm getting mine. It's life or something like it, it's life or something like it. What you wanting, what you getting. are two different things most of the time. What you ask for, what you needing. hope you getting yours 'cause I'm getting mine.

Does the fear in you bring you the same type of adrenaline. A few thousand hearing you sing. or does it bring you to your knees. While you're clearing your brain? I know I'm after the same. Treading water after every offer that has came. Trying to be myself in the valley of the fake. Trying to fix myself up, every hour could break. And when the times get easier, now they all needing you. Following the leader to the promised land. A modest man I was before, I won the war. And when things were difficult, no one ever gave a fuck. Maybe skill, maybe luck, either way. I made it up and so what? So what?. I said so what? You got a little something on the high end. But does it ever really make you feel good?. Got something to say?. Yeah, I said so what?. They trying to put you down on the low end. But do they ever really-really feel good?. Got something to say? Yeah. Where do you go when everyone is gone?. The same people who first appeared when you got on. It ain't equal to the years that made it seem so long. For you to achieve the damn things you knew all along. And I battled the same, so original. they couldn't give my style a name. Now there's a million me's but only one runs the lane. And scores points with honesty, I ain't after the fame. And when it came to the breaking point. people raised they hands. So I had to make a point, roll it up and fold it up. I walked into the joint and made it mine. and when it boiled to particulars. Getting down or living it up or giving it up. Or giving a who knows, where, how and what or maybe why. I said so what? You got a little something on the high end. But does it ever really make you feel good?. Got something to say? Yeah"
stranger than fiction,"Sometimes life is stranger than fiction. But the weird thing seems to be. That the storyline don't stick to the script and. The characters involved don't match the description. We all tied up yet we still trippen. Over the small things which seems to all bring. Me Back to when I first started. A hopeless romantic left broken hearted. A bright eye teen who seemed to disregard. Any advice given bout my future plans. I had to go and make things hard. Was told to go to school was told to be a man, damn. But I didn't grow up or be the lucky winner. on ""who wanna blow up"". And that's fine, shit happens. all the trouble makes a better storyline... action. And I tried. I tried to make something out of nothing before. I tried to leave the past on the cutting room floor. But the story runs until the credits roll. But I do know. (That I tried). I tried to put all the blame on everyone else. Lookin for excuses rather than some help. I Know that feeling, when you don't fit in. It's stranger than fiction. Play your part in the scene never knowing lines. A beautiful backdrop, a role undefined. September nights where breezes brushed across my back. Staring at the sky, Fading in the black. Scratch your fingernails cross the storyboard I'm bored. I may need to be woken up from the scene before. And when the plot begins to twist and turn. I'll try my best to keep myself on the road and learn. Quiet on the set, lights camera action. take one, one take, no mistakes. Cut check the gate now roll the tape. Separate the real, from the fake. Put the score on board and it sound great. No dialogue forced on course the breaks. Take 5. Try and enjoy the day"
