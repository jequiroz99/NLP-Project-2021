write on me,"Pick up the pen, put it on the paper. Write on my skin, bring me to life. Can't start again, there ain't no eraser. All of my flaws, you got them so right. Everything is blank until you draw me. Touching on my body like you know me. Write on me. Color outside the lines. Love the way you tat me up. Baby take your time. Write on me. Give me some wings, I'll fly. Love the way you tat me up. I'll never change my mind. Write on me, write on me. Write on me, write on me. (Write on me). Write on me (write on me). Write on me. Love the way you tat me up. Write on me. You are my friend, straight and no chaser. Burns going down but it keeps me alive. Tell me the truth, I like the danger. Cause in the end you will be mine. Everything is gray until you draw me. Touching on my body like you know me. Write on me. Color outside the lines. Love the way you tat me up. Baby take your time. Write on me. Give me some wings, I'll fly. Love the way you tat me up. I'll never change my mind. Write on me, write on me. Write on me, write on me. I could see a city sleep. I could see an ocean wave. Everything is changing and it's written on my face. I could see a city sleep. I could see an ocean wave. Everything is changing and it's written on my face. Write on me. Color outside the lines.

you are not alone,"Another day has gone. I'm still all alone. How could this be?. You're not here with me. You never said good-bye. Someone tell me why. Did you have to go?. And leave my world so cold?. Every day I sit and ask myself. How did love slip away?. Something whispers. In my ear and says:. That you are not alone. I am here with you. Though you're far away. I am here to stay. You are not alone. I am here with you. Though we're far apart. You're always in my heart. You are not alone. Just the other night. I thought I heard you cry. Asking me to come. And hold you in my arms. I can hear your prayers. Your burdens I will bear. But first I need your hand. Then forever can begin. Every day I sit and ask myself. How did love slip away?. Something whispers. In my ear and says:. But you are not alone. I am here with you. Though you're far away. I am here to stay. You are not alone. I am here with you. Though we're far apart. You're always in my heart. You are not alone. Oh, whisper three words. And I'll come running. And boy you know. That I'll be there, I'll be there. But you are not alone. We are here for you. Though you're far away. We are here to stay. You are not alone. We are here for you. Though we're far apart. You're always in my heart. You are not alone. (You are not). You are not alone"
young and beautiful,"We are, we are, the young and the beautiful. We're alive tonight, tonight. Flying high like an airplane. Burning stars in the Milky Way. I'm tired cause we never say. Never, never, no no. Lovers come and haters go. Won't be left out in the cold. In the dark where you always glow. Always, always oh, always, always oh. We are, we are, the young and the beautiful. We are, we are, the fearless, the world is yours. We are, we are, the young and the beautiful. We're alive tonight, tonight. Hang with me and we're figure by. That's forever and a whole new life. And we're alive cause we never cry. Never, never oh. We're running up so we don't back down. When our hearts are beating loud. Sing along to the booming sound. Always, always. We are, we are, the young and the beautiful. We are, we are, the fearless, the world is yours. We are, we are, the young and the beautiful. We're alive tonight, tonight. This one goes out to the dreamers. All the hopers and the lovers. Cause as long as we're believers. We're alive, tonight. We are, we are, the young and the beautiful. We are, we are, the fearless, the world is yours. We are, we are, the young and the beautiful. We're alive tonight, tonight. We are, we are, the young and the beautiful. We are, we are, the fearless, the world is yours. We are, we are, the young and the beautiful. We're alive tonight, tonight"
