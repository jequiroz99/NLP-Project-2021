Don`t you ask me why, I got to face reality. No way, no more lies, so I`m out and on my way. When I breakdown on my knees, with suicidal tendencies. You are always on my mind, nothing lives eternally. Scenes run through my head, never forget the shattered dreams. I got to do what I got to do, please forgive me. Chorus.

she's like the wind (cover),"She’s like the wind, through my dream. She rides the night, next to me. She leads me through moonlight. Only to burn me with the sun. She’s taking my heart. But she doesn’t know what she’s done. I feel her breath on my face. Her body close to me. I can’t look in her eyes. She’s out of my league. Just a fool to believe. I have anything she needs. She’s like the wind. I look in the mirror and all I see. Is the young old man with only a dream. And I’m just fooling myself that she stops the pain. Living without her I go insane. I feel her breath in my face. Her body close to me. I can’t look in her eyes. She’s out of my league. Just a fool to believe. I have anything she needs. She’s like the wind. I feel your breath on my face. Your body close to me. I can’t look in your eyes. You’re out of my league. Just a fool to believe. She’s like the wind. Just a fool to believe. She’s like the wind.

Someday you'll find out that blind love is through. When I pray that we'll find a way to look back on today together. Someday we will know. Someday we will know, we will know, we will know. Someday we will know, we will know, we will know. How will I know that you'll be ok tomorrow. When you're so far away from me. Night after night I enjoy this endless sorrow. Cause maybe it's not the end of our story. I can't make you stay in a frameless portrait. It's someday you'll remember what you never knew. Someday you'll find out that blind love is through. When I pray that we'll find a way to look back on today together. Someday we will know. Someday we will know, we will know, we will know. Someday we will know, we will know, we will know. Our love went straight but I want to start to pray. We'll find a way someday. And I know it didn't happen all in vain. Someday your heart will tell you what you have to do. Your heart will find out what you never knew. Cause your heart can never forget. So let's try to, let's try to, find out a way. To look back on today together. Someday we will know.

Thinking castles in the air, mental pictures everywhere. But they will liquefy…. Chorus. Who`s savin´ me, before it`s gone. I loose a bootleg version of my thoughts till dawn.

Imaginations and impressions floating slowly out of my head. 3 o`clock p.m. and I`m still tired. Someone`s ringin` forcibly my bell. Feeling so narcotic , feelin´ so forlorn. Evacuated like an empty shell. My thoughts are gliding far away into the distance. Diving deep into my soul where my emotions run and flow. Recallin´ fluent dreams to hold on to a vision. Thinking castles in the air, mental pictures everywhere. Chorus(2x). Who`s savin´ me, before it`s gone. I loose a bootleg version of my thoughts till dawn. Who`s savin` me, my soul unsaid.
