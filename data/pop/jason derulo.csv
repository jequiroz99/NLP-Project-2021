can you feel the love tonight-nants' ingonyama (from 'the lion king'),"There's a calm surrender to the rush of day. When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away. An enchanted moment, and it sees me through. It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you. And can you feel the love tonight?. It is where we are. It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer. That we got this far. And can you feel the love tonight?. How it's laid to rest. It's enough to make kings and vagabonds. Believe the very best. There's a time for everyone if they only learn. That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn. There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors. When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours. And can you feel the love tonight?. It is where we are. It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer. That we got this far. And can you feel the love tonight?. How it's laid to rest. It's enough to make kings and vagabonds. Believe the very best. It's enough to make kings and vagabonds. Believe the very best"

can you feel the love tonight-nants' ingonyama (from 'the lion king'),"There's a calm surrender to the rush of day. When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away. An enchanted moment, and it sees me through. It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you. And can you feel the love tonight?. It is where we are. It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer. That we got this far. And can you feel the love tonight?. How it's laid to rest. It's enough to make kings and vagabonds. Believe the very best. There's a time for everyone if they only learn. That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn. There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors. When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours. And can you feel the love tonight?. It is where we are. It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer. That we got this far. And can you feel the love tonight?. How it's laid to rest. It's enough to make kings and vagabonds. Believe the very best. It's enough to make kings and vagabonds. Believe the very best"

Cause in the dark it's our safest haven.. How come the star are shining?. How is it good rewinding?. Keep em outta sight.. I can be a vampire, be mine,. Run the daylight,. Together we stay right,. Stay away, away from night.. Never say good night,. No good in goodbye,. No way, so you'll stay,. You'll lay awake,. And you can be my insomnia.. You give me a love,. I'll stay up forever.. I can be your insomnia,. I can give you a rush,. Stay sleepless together.. You can be my insomnia.. You give me a love,. I'll stay up forever.. I can be your insomnia.. My touch is like a drug that keeps you away, way.. No way never turn back,. Hurt me like a heart attack,. Acting like a manic,. Be my love insomniac.. I'll bet they'll never know,. One touch I over dose,. So much I want some more,. So close.. I can be a vampire, be mine,. Run from the daylight.. Together we stay right,. Stay away, away from night.. Never say good night,. No good in goodbye.. No way, so you'll stay,. You'll lay awake,. And you can be my insomnia.. You give me a love,. I'll stay up forever.. I can be your insomnia,. I can give you a rush,. Stay sleepless together.. You can be my insomnia."
