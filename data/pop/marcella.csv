blow out,"Season is over, let's go home. Wind hugs our skins. And grab my hand and count in your hand. I'm feeling good, let's hurray. Happiness' a glass of full water. Just serve and drink. Blow out. To rest and grab my jacket. Blow out. Love is one and we are there. Your clothes' ok, we are not late. Slowly deeper than a lake and we are naked. Give me a kiss. Life is long, fits in a point. Pointing out my love is something. Not resist. Blow out. To rest and grab my jacket. Blow out. Love is one and we are there"
good to me,"If I tell u, you're the piece of me that has been missing boo. would you stick around and click or would you up and run?. if I handed u a key, I don't know what for. it might be to my heart or it might be for the door. I never really had to give somebody all of me. I never really had to get somebody out of me. I don't know how. how to take the questions that you're asking properly. cause u know that I take offense way too easily. wish I knew how. to make you good. to be you be good to me. boy you're not good. you know you're no good for me. am I the one?. you hit first for company. baby. I never really had to give somebody all of me. I never really had to get somebody out of me. I don't know how. how to take the questions that you're asking properly. cause u know that I take offense way too easily. wish I knew how. if I tell you I got issues I don't trust no one. would you say goodbye or would you try and prove me wrong. I don't like being on the line, I feel vulnerable. I like when my heart's safe behind closed doors. I never really had to give somebody all of me. I never really had to get somebody out of me. I don't know how. how to take the questions that you're asking properly. cause u know that I take offense way too easily. wish I knew how. to make you good. to make you be good to me. boy you're not good. you know you're no good for me. am I the one?. you hit first for company. baby"
