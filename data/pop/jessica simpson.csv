take my breath away,Watching every motion. In my foolish lover's game. On this endless ocean. Finally lovers know no shame. Turning and returning. To some secret place inside. Watching in slow motion. As you turn around and say. My love. Take my breath away. Take my breath away. Watching I keep waiting. Still anticipating love. Never hesitating. To become the fated ones. Turning and returning. To some secret place to inside. Watching in slow motion. As you turn to me and say. My love. Take my breath away. Through the hourglass I saw you. In time you slipped away. When the mirror crashed I called you. And turned to hear you say. If only for today. I am unafraid. Take my breath away. Take my breath away. Watching every motion. In this foolish lover's game. Haunted by the notion. Somewhere there's a love in flames. Turning and returning. To some secret place inside. Watching in slow motion. As you turn my way and say. Take my breath away. My Love. Take my breath away. My Love. Take my breath away. Take my breath away

I felt passion so bright that I was blind. Then something made me weak. Talking in my sleep. Baby I'm in so deep and you know I believe. (Chorus). Your lips, your face, something that time just can't erase. My heart could break all over again. (Chorus)"
angels,I sit and wait. Does an angel contemplate my fate. And do they know. The places where we go. When we're grey and old. 'cause I've been told. That salvation lets their wings unfold.

A lot of love and affection. Whether I'm right or wrong. And down the waterfall. Wherever it may take me. I know that life won't break me. When I come to call he won't forsake me. I'm loving angels instead. When I'm feeling weak. And my pain walks down a one way street. I look above. And I know I'll always be blessed with love. And as the feeling grows. He breathes flesh to my bones. And when love is dead. I'm loving angels instead. Chorus:. And through it all he offers me protection. A lot of love and affection. Whether I'm right or wrong.

do you know (feat. dolly parton),"Lying here beside you in the dark. I feel the steady rhythm of your heart. I feel your face against my shoulder breath upon my skin. Embers barely smoldered, I make love to you again. Nothing in this world compares to this. The way our bodies feel the way we kiss. Passion love beneathness just adds to my desire (?). Seems that I am more less consumed here in your fire. Do you know how much I love you. Do you know how much you mean to me. The interest that you show. Do you know how beautiful you are here in the afterglow. Do you know I'd walk through hell for you barefoot on burning coal. A thousand ways I love you and I need to know you know. Do you know. Do you know. Ohh do you know. Do you know how much I love you. Do you know how much it means to me the way you make me feel. Like I could soar the heavens gathering shooting stars. Place them in a gold cave in the rainbow-studded jar (?). Everything that's heavenly to me is what you are. Do you know. Do you know. Do you know how much I love you. Something deep inside me tells me that you almost know. Do you know, do you know. Do you know. Ohhh do you know. Ohhh do you know"

Be forever near me, breath of Heaven. Breath of Heaven, lighten my darkness. Pour over me your holiness, for you are holy,. Breath of Heaven. Do you wonder when you watch my face,. If a wiser one should have had my place?. But I offer all I am for the mercy of your plan. Help me be strong, help me be strong,. Help me be strong, help me. Breath of Heaven, hold me together. Be forever near me, breath of Heaven. Breath of Heaven, lighten my darkness. Pour over me your holiness, for you are holy. Breath of Heaven, hold me together. Be forever near me, breath of Heaven.

i have loved you,"Remember that blue crystal sky. The sun reflected in your eyes. Kissed me unexpectedly. A moment I just can't forget. We filled the air with promises. Took them up so tenderly. But life never asks you what you want. It's just gonna have its way. Sometimes it doesn't give like it takes. If I never see your face. If wings take you away from me. And tomorrow never happens, baby. If the world comes tumbling down. And crumbles all around us. Fate turns cruel. You're on your knees. So desperate for one truth. Know that I have loved you. Don't think I'll write another letter. Watching there the pink sunset. Without thinking about you. I take a walk along the blue seaside. How will I sleep at night. How will I wipe the tears from your eyes. If I never see your face. If wings take you away from me. And tomorrow never happens, baby. If the world comes tumbling down. And crumbles all around us. Fate turns cruel. You're on your knees. So desperate for one truth. Know that I have loved you. Without a single hesitation. Without thought or reservation. Baby, I'll be waiting. Even if I never see your face. And wings take you away from me. And tomorrow never happens, baby. If the world comes tumbling down. And crumbles all around us. Fate turns cruel. You're on your knees. So desperate for one truth. Know that I have loved you. I have loved you. If I never see your face. If wings take you away from me. With all my heart and all my soul. The world comes tumbling. And crumbling all around. I have loved you. If I never see your face. If wings take you away from me. I have loved you"

Take you wonder by wonder. Over, sideways and under. On a magic carpet ride. A whole new world. A new fantastic point of view. No one to tell us no. Or where to go. Or say we're only dreaming. A whole new world. A dazzling place I never knew. But when I'm way up here. It's crystal clear. That now I'm in a whole new world with you. Now I'm in a whole new world with you. Unbelievable sights.

Every moment red-letter. I'll chase them anywhere. There's time to spare. Let me share this whole new world with you. A whole new world. That's where we'll be. A thrilling chase. A wondrous place.

angels,I sit and wait. Does an angel contemplate my fate. And do they know. The places where we go. When we're grey and old. 'cause I've been told. That salvation lets their wings unfold.

A lot of love and affection. Whether I'm right or wrong. And down the waterfall. Wherever it may take me. I know that life won't break me. When I come to call he won't forsake me. I'm loving angels instead. When I'm feeling weak. And my pain walks down a one way street. I look above. And I know I'll always be blessed with love. And as the feeling grows. He breathes flesh to my bones. And when love is dead. I'm loving angels instead. Chorus:. And through it all he offers me protection. A lot of love and affection. Whether I'm right or wrong. And down the waterfall. Wherever it may take me. I know that life won't break me. When I come to call he won't forsake me. I'm loving angels instead. Chorus:.

back to you,When i first saw you i already knew. I was breakin my own heart when i fell for you. I meant to be moment of lovers taboo. When i let my mind wander it brings me right back there to you. What a beautiful house with the city lights few. No white picket fence. No porch swing for two. But the lights they just sparkle like your eyes used to do. When i let my mind wander it brings me right back there to you. I'll get away here's my chance to be free. Cause i can't feel tied down to something i don't see. But why do i stay married?. ??. When i let my mind wander it brings me right back there to you. When i let my mind wander it brings me right back. How will find me through the thunder and the rain. Cast away these clouds filled with so much pain. Every time that i ..... Every time that i cry. Every time that i say goodbye. It's cause i'm missin you. I'm missin you. When my mind wanders baby. It brings me right back. I should find peace in the still of the night. I lie awake cause you're not by my side. These arms of mine left empty cause you're not in my life. When i let my mind wander it brings me right back there to you

breath of heaven (mary's song),"I have traveled many moonless nights. Cold and weary, with a babe inside. And I wonder what I've done. Holy Father you have come. And chosen me now, to carry your son.

Be forever near me, breath of Heaven. Breath of Heaven, lighten my darkness. Pour over me your holiness, for you are holy,. Breath of Heaven. Do you wonder when you watch my face,. If a wiser one should have had my place?. But I offer all I am for the mercy of your plan. Help me be strong, help me be strong,. Help me be strong, help me. Breath of Heaven, hold me together.

did you ever love somebody?,"Did you ever love somebody?. So much that the earth moved. Did you ever love somebody?. Even though it hurt too much?. Did you ever love somebody?. Nothing else you heart could do. Did you ever love somebody?. Who never knew. Did you ever lay your head down. On the shoulder of a good friend. And then had to look away somehow. Had to hide the way you felt for them. Have you ever prayed the day would come. You'd hear them say they feel it too. Did you ever love someone?. Who never knew. I do.. And if you did. Well you know I'd understand. I could, I would. More than anybody can. Did you ever love somebody?. So much that the earth moved. Did you ever love somebody?. Even though it hurt to. Did you ever love somebody?. Nothin else your heart could do. Did you ever love somebody?. Like I love you. Like I love you. LIke I love you...."
do you know (feat. dolly parton),"Lying here beside you in the dark. I feel the steady rhythm of your heart. I feel your face against my shoulder breath upon my skin. Embers barely smoldered, I make love to you again. Nothing in this world compares to this. The way our bodies feel the way we kiss. Passion love beneathness just adds to my desire (?). Seems that I am more less consumed here in your fire. Do you know how much I love you. Do you know how much you mean to me. The interest that you show. Do you know how beautiful you are here in the afterglow. Do you know I'd walk through hell for you barefoot on burning coal. A thousand ways I love you and I need to know you know. Do you know. Do you know. Ohh do you know. Do you know how much I love you. Do you know how much it means to me the way you make me feel. Like I could soar the heavens gathering shooting stars. Place them in a gold cave in the rainbow-studded jar (?). Everything that's heavenly to me is what you are. Do you know. Do you know. Do you know how much I love you. Something deep inside me tells me that you almost know. Do you know, do you know. Do you know. Ohhh do you know. Ohhh do you know"

remember that,Remember how he told you you were stupid. How he couldn't even look at you anymore. Remember how he told you you were crazy. How he got out of the car and slammed the door. He said you can't do anything right. Why you gotta make me so mad. Just get out of my sight. Remember that.... When it's 3AM and he's at your door. And he wants you back and he's begging for forgiveness. Remember that. When your phone keeps ringing all night long. And that same old weakness gets so strong. That you're helpless. Remember that. Remember how he pushed you in a hallway. Just enough to hurt a little bit. Remember the whiskey in his whispers. And the lies that fell so easy from his lips. He said he'll never do it again. But you can't take it back. The proof is on your skin. Remember that.... When it's 3AM and he's at your door. And he wants you back and he's begging for forgiveness. Remember that. When your phone keeps ringing all night long. And that same old weakness gets so strong. That you're helpless. Remember that. It doesn't matter how he hurts you. With his hands or with his words you. Don't deserve it. It ain't worth it. Take your heart and run. Just run. When it's 3AM and he's at your door. And he wants you back and he's begging for forgiveness. Remember that. When your phone keeps ringing all night long. And that same old weakness gets so strong. That you're helpless. Remember that. Remember you're gonna be alright. Take it from me I've stood there in your shoes

still beautiful,I have always believed. God won't give me. More than I can handle. But sometimes when it's so hard. And I'm falling apart. I wonder if I can take this hurt. I'm going through. But I know no matter what I do. There will not be sunny days. Life's gonna bring down some rain. But after it's over. I'll be that much stronger for the pain. So even when I'm sad. I know every day I have is still beautiful. Still beautiful. There've been times in my life. When all of the skies were blue and were so wide open. But lately all of my dreams seem so out of reach. And everything feels so broken. But it can't last too long. So I just keep on holding on. There will not be sunny days. Life's gonna bring down some rain. But after it's over. I'll be that much stronger for the pain. So even when I'm sad. I know every day I have is still beautiful. But I wanna cry sometimes. I'm gonna hurt sometimes. But it takes the good and the bad. The happy and sad to make you feel alive. There will not be sunny days. Life's gonna bring down some rain. But after it's over. I'll be that much stronger for the pain. There will not be sunny days. Life's gonna bring down some rain. But after it's over. I'll be that much stronger for the pain. I know I'll be alright. As long as you're here by my side. So even when I'm sad. I know every day I have is still beautiful. Still beautiful. Still beautiful

take my breath away,Watching every motion. In my foolish lover's game. On this endless ocean. Finally lovers know no shame. Turning and returning. To some secret place inside. Watching in slow motion. As you turn around and say. My love. Take my breath away. Take my breath away. Watching I keep waiting. Still anticipating love. Never hesitating. To become the fated ones. Turning and returning. To some secret place to inside. Watching in slow motion. As you turn to me and say. My love. Take my breath away. Through the hourglass I saw you. In time you slipped away. When the mirror crashed I called you. And turned to hear you say. If only for today. I am unafraid. Take my breath away. Take my breath away. Watching every motion. In this foolish lover's game. Haunted by the notion. Somewhere there's a love in flames. Turning and returning. To some secret place inside. Watching in slow motion. As you turn my way and say. Take my breath away. My Love. Take my breath away. My Love. Take my breath away. Take my breath away
the christmas song,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire. Jack Front nipping at your nose. Yuletide carols being sung by a choir. And folks dressed up like eskimos. Everybody knows some turkey and some mistletoe. Help to make the season bright. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow. Will find it hard to sleep tonight. They know that Santa's on his way. He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh. And every mother's child is going spy. To see if reindeer really know how to fly. And so I'm offering this simple phrase. To kids from one to ninety-two. Although it's been said many times, many ways. Merry Christmas to you"

'Cause I'm tired of emotions. I'm blue no more. Walkin' round in a circle. Deja vu no more. Walkin' round in a circle. Being redundant is never the one trick I ever want to master. One quirk can get me focused. 'Cause the start of a circle is also the ending. One door has to close before the next can open. Gotta give my own life. My whole life is a given one sweet goal. I never loved the sun until the rain. I'll never get anywhere if I stay on a same place. Always afraid I'm.... And I just get stuck in a dream. Where the answer's clear but no one knows it.

How can I be my best, there's never fail. How can I ever find peace if I never yell. I gotta be stronger. I can't let cold wind blow me on a cold night. I follow the skyline and I am no longer. Stuck in a dream. Where the answer's clear but no one knows it. It's like a toss up, I gotta get off here. 'Cause I'm tired of emotions. I'm blue no more. Walkin' round in a circle. Deja vu no more. Walkin' round in a circle"

The only thing keeping you company. is the melody in your song. Keep singin' it. Pour your scotch on the rocks. And drink your misery down. Go home and make love to her. And picture me, picture me yeah. Picture me. When I loved you like that. When I loved you like that. When I loved you like that. When I loved you like that. Yeah. When I loved, when I loved, when I loved. When I loved you like that"
when you told me you loved me,"Once doesn?t mean anything to me. Come; show me the meaning of complete. Where did our love go wrong?. Once we were so strong. How can I go on?. (Chorus:). When you told me you loved me. Did you know it would take me the rest of my life?. To get over the feeling of knowing? in a dream. Didn?t turn out right. When you let me believe. That you were incomplete without me by your side. How could I know?. That you would go, that you would run. Baby I thought you were the one. Why can't I just leave it all behind?. I felt passion so bright that I was blind. Then something made me weak. Talking in my sleep. Baby I'm in so deep and you know I believe. (Chorus). Your lips, your face, something that time just can't erase. My heart could break all over again. (Chorus)"
where you are (feat. nick lachey),"There are times. I swear I know you're here. When I forget about my fears. Feelin you my dear. Watching over me. My hope sees. What the future will bring. When you wrap me in your wings. And take me where you are. Where you and I will be together. Once again, we'll be dancin in the moonlight. Just like we used to do. And you'll be smilin back at me. Only then will I be free. When I can be, where you are. And I can see your face. Your kiss I still can taste. Not a memory erased. Oh, how I see your star. Shinin down on me. And I'd do anything. If I could just, be right there where you are. Where you and I will breathe together. Once again we'll be dancin' in the moonlight. Just like we used to do. And you'll be smilin' back at me (you'll be smilin back at me). Only then will I be free. Then I will be free, so take me where you are. Now baby there are times when selfishly. I'm wishin' that you were here with me. So I can wipe the tears from your eyes and make you see. That every night when you are dreamin'. I'm here to guard you from afar. And anytime I feel alone. I close my eyes and dream of where you are. Where you are. Where you and I will breathe together. Once again we'll be dancin in the moonlight. Just like we used to do. And you'll be smilin back at me (you'll be smilin back at me). Only then will I be free. Then I will be free,. Baby I still believe. Oh I gotta believe. I still believe. I will touch you that sweet day. That you take me there. Where you are (where you are). I still believe. Whoooooa, I gotta believe. I still believe. I will touch you that sweet day. That you take me there. Where you are, oh where you are!. I still believe. I gotta believe. I still believe. I'll always be waiting here. That sweet day (that sweet day, yeah!). I still believe......I still believe...."
who we are,"Who we are. Who we are. Who we are. Who we are. Who we are. Who we are. I have to take control. So much is left untold. Trying to find myself. At times it's hard to know. Who we are, we are, we are. Words can cut so deep. Weighing down on me. Time and time I see how vicious the world can be. Who we are, we are, we are. [Chorus 2x]. We're beautiful. Our flaws and all. They're beautiful to me. It's who we are, who we are. It's who we're meant to be. Now never change a thing. We all have broken days. To paint it on our face. It gets too much to fake. And we wanna hide away. Who we are, we are, we are. Inside, inside. [Chorus]. We're beautiful. Our flaws and all. They're beautiful to me. It's who we are..... It's who we're meant to be. Now never change a thing. You've got to be you for yourself. Cuz you're like nobody else. Who you are, you are, you are, you are. [Chorus]. Our flaws and all. They're beautiful to me. It's who we are... it's who we're meant to be. We're beautiful. Our flaws and all. They're beautiful to me. It's who are... it's who were meant to be. Now never change a thing. Who we are, who we are, who we are. Who we are, who we are, who we are. Who we are, who we are, who we are. Who we are"
with you,"With You. The real me is a southern girl. With her Levi's on and an open heart. Wish I could save the world. Like I was super girl. The real me used to laugh all night. Lying in the grass just talking about love. But lately I've been jaded. Life got so complicated. I start thinkin' about it. Almost forgot what it was like. To know what it feels like. But with you. I can let my hair down. I can say anything crazy. I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground. With nothing but a T-shirt on. I never felt so beautiful. Baby as I do now. Now that I'm with you. (With you, With you, With you. Now that I'm with you). You speak and it's like a song. And just like that all my walls come down. It's like a private joke, just meant for us to know. I relate to you naturally. Everybody else just fades away. Sometimes it's hard to breathe. Just knowing you found me. Cuz I start thinking about it. Almost forgot what it was like. To Know what love feels right. But with you. I can let my hair down. I can say anything crazy. I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground. With nothing but a T-shirt on. I never felt so beautiful. Baby as I do now. Now that I'm with you. (With you, with you, with you).

you don't have to let go,"I don't need your strength anymore. cause you've made me strong. You may not see the one light in me. And you dreamed of. Holding me in your arms. All the days that you gave. All the moments you've saved me. Praying for my life. Sacrificed, just to make me who I am on my own. You don't have to let go. You don't say it. But it's in your eyes. All the fears of good-bye. But I can promise. You'll always have a place, and a way to my heart. All the days that you gave. All the moments you've saved me. Praying for my life. Sacrificed, just to make me who I am on my own. You don't have to let go. I can live. Cause you lived for me. And I can love. Because you loved me. All the days that you gave. All the moments you've saved me. Praying for my life. Sacrificed, just to make me who I am on my own. You don't have to let go. (Ooh ooh ooh)"
you don't know what love is,"Last night I saw you as I stood in the rain. Brought me right back to that feeling again.. I tried to hide the tears in my eyes. But you didn’t see as you walked on by.. Tried to forget ya, I tried to move on.. But the deeper I’m feeling, the harder I fall.. Nothing else matters at all. Let me tell you.. You don’t know what love is till you lose it.. You don’t know what you’ve got till it slips away.. Leaves you alone in the dark and takes you and tears you apart.. You don’t know what love is till it breaks your heart.. Till it breaks your heart.. Sometimes I think back when our love was new.. The crazy things that we used to do.. How could love that’s so right turn to something so wrong. Still can’t believe that you’re really gone.. Wish I could stop all these thoughts in my head. Wish I could take back the words that I said. It’s a lesson I’ll never forget. Let me tell you.. You don’t know what love is till you lose it.. You don’t know what you’ve got till it slips away.. Leaves you alone in the dark. Takes you and tears you apart.. You don’t know what love is till it breaks your heart.. Ooh ooh. Yeh.. Love has no season, no beginning nor end.. No rhyme or reason, to the way the story ends.. No way of knowing how a broken heart mends.. Still we keep fallin’, time and time again.. You don’t know what love is till you lose it.. You don’t know what you’ve got till it slips away.. Leaves you alone in the dark. Takes you and tears you apart.. You don’t know what love is till it breaks your heart.. Till it breaks your heart. Ah ooh. Till it breaks your heart.."
you put your faith in me,"Oh. When I see you there. I’m so aware. Of how lucky I am baby. Cuz I don’t deserve. I don’t come close. To understanding baby. The logic of your kind of trust. It amazes me. That someone like you. Would care enough. To just believe. Chorus:. Your faith in me. It pulls me through. When there’s nothin around. To hold onto. When I fall. When I’m weak. All the strength that I need. Is your faith baby. Your faith in me, oh. Even when we fight. I get along. Cuz our love is real baby. It’s like salvation to my soul. Cuz that’s how it feels baby. It’s a sacred thing. That I keep close. To carry on. And I know that I will be alright. And you’ll heal it all. Chorus. You make me feel I can walk on water. (I can reach the farthest star). And nothin comes against me. Safe within your arms. Chorus. Bridge: X 4. When I fall baby (oh). When I’m weak baby. All I need baby (all I need is your faith in me). Is your faith in me. Ooh. Your faith in me."
you spin me round (like a record),"You don't know what you do to me. Everytime you come around. I can't seem to find my way. I'm shifted baby losing ground. It's like i'm spinning all around in circles. Cure me, you're my remedy. I get dizzy from the sound of your name. I'm just so intoxicated when you spin me baby. You spin me right round, baby. Right round like a record, baby. Right round round round. You spin me right round, baby. Right round like a record, baby. Right round round round. Round and round. I can't help this craving honey.

I'm just so intoxicated when you spin me baby. You spin me right round, baby. Right round like a record, baby. Right round round round. You spin me right round, baby. Right round like a record, baby.

you're my sunday,"Don't you love waking up. Don't have to rush cause you ain't got much to do. Lay in bed with the TV on. All day long if you wanted to. We spend so much time, worried about what's coming up next. Can't even find a little room, a little space, even catch a breath. When life is like a hurricane. Flying off the rails like a fast train. Everything around me so insane. You come and take it all away. You're my Sunday. You show up right on time. Just when I need to take it slow. It's a mystery how easily you found the key that. always brings me home. You have a way of taking the noise and drowning it out. I don't know what I would do if I woke up and you were not around. When life is like a hurricane. Flying off the rails like a fast train. Everything around me so insane. You come and take it all away. You're my Sunday. When life is like a hurricane. Flying off the rails like a fast train. Everything around me so insane. You come and take it all away (all away). When life is like a hurricane. Flying off the rails like a fast train. Everything around me so insane. You come take it all away. You're my Sunday. You're my Sunday. You're my Sunday. Don't you love waking up. Don't have to rush cause you ain't got much to do (hey). Lay in bed with the TV on all day long if you wanted to"
