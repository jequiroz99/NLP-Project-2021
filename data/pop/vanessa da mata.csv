I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile. If I had a wish that I could wish for you. I'd make a wish for sunshine all the while. Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy. Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry. Sunshine on the water looks so lovely. Sunshine, almost always, makes me high. Sunshine, almost all the time, makes me high. Sunshine, almost always"
