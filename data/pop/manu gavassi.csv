memories,No one said that it was easy. to forget about all the stuff you said. No one said you would believe me. I won't care about all the dreams I had. Now I just want you to be with me. All my plans are made for us. All the love that you gave up. I don't know what else to do. No no no no no. All my songs I've wrote for you. All the things we've used to do. Now are just my memories. Just my memories. I keep trying to get over you. And I admit that we weren't mean to be. I keep trying to don't look at you. Let's pretend that our story ends. Now I just want you to stay with me. All my plans are made for us. All the love that you gave up. I don't know what else to do. No no no no no. All my songs I've wrote for you. All the things we've used to do. Now are just my memories. Please don't let me here just wondering how you feel. Come and tell me if it is real. Is it real?. Guess it's just my memories. Just my memories
we found love (cover rihanna),Yellow diamonds in the light. And we're standing side by side. As your shadow crosses mine. What it takes to come alive. It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny. But I've gotta let it go. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. Shine a light through an open door. Love and life I will divide. Turn away cause I need you more. Feel the heartbeat in my mind. It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny. But I've gotta let it go. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. Yellow diamonds in the light. And we're standing side by side. As your shadow crosses mine. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place
