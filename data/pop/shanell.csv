2 seconds too late,"As my last bags packed,. I look around tryna find a reason to stay.. How was I supposed to know. That there was so much that he wanted to say?. If the train that he took would've been on time,. Then maybe we'da caught back up.. If my heart would've told me to change my mind,. I would've been there when he showed back up.. But He's 2 seconds too late. I've already walked out & left him behind.. He's 2 seconds too late. He's chasing my shadow,. Running out of time.. I don't wanna look back.. Too scared to cry. I'll never know if he cared enough to try. 2 seconds made it too late.. Nothing left but the idea of him and I, him and I. I didn't think that he cared. And I was tired of tryna figure everything out.. I guess we both wanted to make a change,. But somehow we went down two different routes.. If he didn't make that turn, take the long way home,. Then maybe we'da caught back up.. Had the flowers, the candy, with open arms. To find himself standing there alone.. Cause he's 2 seconds too late. I've already walked out & left him behind.. He's 2 seconds too late. He's chasing my shadow,. Running out of time.. I don't wanna look back.. Too scared to cry. I'll never know if he cared enough to try. 2 seconds made it too late.. Nothing left but the idea of him and I, him and I. Why'd it take him so long to figure it out. Clock is tickin – i've been sittin' here pouring it out – my heart. My heart is empty.. Theres nothing left to hold on to now.. He's 2 seconds too late. I've already walked out & left him behind.. He's 2 seconds too late. He's chasing my shadow,. Running out of time.. I don't wanna look back.. Too scared to cry. I'll never know if he cared enough to try. 2 seconds made it too late.. Nothing left but the idea of him and I, him and I"

She say, ""I get it and if anything was to happen to you I be livid"". You ain't gotta be worried 'bout that. I kill a pussy nigga, put his head on exhibit. Come up missing think they caught a big fish. Till his body come up drippin'. I treat her legs like like a grand opening. Smilin' while I cut the ribbon. I took a pill, she took a pill. We was chillin' 20 minutes now we feel it. She said ""I know you probably hear this shit a lot but you the shit in my opinion"". I said it never gets old, thought I'd never say never but I did it.

She took her clothes off and I stopped. Looked at my watch like ""fuck it why not? "". Guess I could fuck her once then I'm out. Fucked so many times a nigga lost count, Lord. She said ""I know you thought that you was about to get a quick fix, hit and quit it. But you know you ain't been with a good thick bitch in a minute"". I said you ain? t never lying thought I? d never say never but I did it. She said speakin' of a line, are you finished?. All we need is a witness. Girl you trippin', young nigga still livin'. She said ""Who you kiddin' boy, you like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"". I admit it, I like a thick bitch - big booty, big titties, I admit it. [Hook Interlude]"

That's high school making me chase you around for months. Have an affair, act like an adult for once. Plus my hand is up your skirt, goddamn you flirt. What's a little me on top gonna hurt?. Maybe a little but. Pain is pleasure and pressure bust pipes. And you look like the I like it rough type. We can crush tonight, tell me what you like. I got a yellow bottle on a bucket of ice. Get right, Young Hova"

He don't love me no more. [Verse 2:]. He gave me everything a girl could ask. But he couldn't stick around while. I gave someone else a second chance. He said I only called when I need him, to act like I was in love. But when he looked inside my heart was empty. and he said he had enough. [Chorus]"

tell no lies (feat. legacy (new boyz)),"[Hook: Shanell]. Said yes but I know. Youre really not that sure. Cause your eyes dont tell no lies. Walkin' that road, left everything you know. The mask you wear dont cover the windows to your soul. Cause your eyes dont tell no lies, your eyes dont tell no lies. [Verse 1: Legacy]. Ever since a child he wanted to be a rapper. Someone said he'd do anything to make it happen. Daddy died gang bangin, momma on drugs. Got a best friend but that nigga locked up. Had a girlfriend that'd be there if he lonely. Till she got drunk and she smashed all the homies. Couldn't stop the pain even after jiggas song. Like alotta bad sex so many did him wrong. He started to rappin but not to give a message. He just knew his fans would love. When nobody else except it. And if he was good he'd get the models on the banners. And maybe make enough to buy the condo in atlanta. That he, always wanted, really wanted. Was the key to the window that will lead him to his fortune. Then at least people would greet him if he lonely. He'd be free if he got it so he started. [Hook: Shanell]. Walkin' that road, left everything you know. The mask you wear dont cover the windows to your soul. Cause your eyes dont tell no lies, your eyes dont tell no lies. [Verse 2: Legacy]. A year passed, he finally got the deal. He wouldn't stop dreaming till he finally turnt it real. He froze at the question when they asked him how it feel. Saying he didn't do it for the love, he just did it for his self. All the kids saw was a man with a chain. So they idolised him like the man was a game. He thought about buying a phantom, a range. So that he could drive away from the past that he hate. He seemed like he beat every kid in the fame. He became even more distant from sane in the game. He ain't care about the stuff on his brain. If he said what he felt they would spit on his name. Kick him down, help him up just to kick him down again. And then they burried him. so long they won't remember his face. But he kept his smile on when anybody greet him. He knows what shoes a kid suppose to be in. [Hook: Shanell]. (We) walkin' that road, left everything you know. The mask you wear dont cover the windows to your soul. Cause your eyes dont tell no lies, your eyes dont tell no lies"

what is love,"Hurry hurry up I got a question, that needs to be answered. I really wanna know. I need to know about it. I never knew some many emotions. Could all add up to meaning the same thing.

I just really wanna know what is love. (What is, what is). What is love?. (What is, what is, what is love?). If it's so easy to let it go. Please define the word unconditional. What is love?.

Keep telling myself that it's getting closer. It shouldn't hurt. But the growing pain is something that I can't explain (?). I'm falling even deeper in this ocean. But not drowning on a need. Breathing in the sea. Such a four letter word is so hard to believe, I. I can love again. Teach me how to breathe again. Show me how to trust again. It's killing me slow. Damn, I really need to know.

2 seconds too late,"As my last bags packed,. I look around tryna find a reason to stay.. How was I supposed to know. That there was so much that he wanted to say?. If the train that he took would've been on time,. Then maybe we'da caught back up.. If my heart would've told me to change my mind,. I would've been there when he showed back up.. But He's 2 seconds too late. I've already walked out & left him behind.. He's 2 seconds too late. He's chasing my shadow,. Running out of time.. I don't wanna look back.. Too scared to cry. I'll never know if he cared enough to try. 2 seconds made it too late.. Nothing left but the idea of him and I, him and I. I didn't think that he cared. And I was tired of tryna figure everything out.. I guess we both wanted to make a change,. But somehow we went down two different routes.. If he didn't make that turn, take the long way home,. Then maybe we'da caught back up.. Had the flowers, the candy, with open arms. To find himself standing there alone.. Cause he's 2 seconds too late. I've already walked out & left him behind.. He's 2 seconds too late. He's chasing my shadow,. Running out of time.. I don't wanna look back.. Too scared to cry. I'll never know if he cared enough to try. 2 seconds made it too late.. Nothing left but the idea of him and I, him and I. Why'd it take him so long to figure it out. Clock is tickin – i've been sittin' here pouring it out – my heart. My heart is empty.. Theres nothing left to hold on to now.. He's 2 seconds too late. I've already walked out & left him behind.. He's 2 seconds too late. He's chasing my shadow,. Running out of time.. I don't wanna look back.. Too scared to cry. I'll never know if he cared enough to try. 2 seconds made it too late.. Nothing left but the idea of him and I, him and I"

Your hot boy style drives me wild. But in the back of mind I know. Even though I wanna see. How you put that thing on me. I can't let you get the best of me. Even though I wanna see. How you put that thing on me. I can't let you get the best of me. Best of me, best of me. Conversation like what. The slick thighs got you stuck. The feeling's starting to show. Should I stay, should I go?. I don't know. You're driving me crazy. I wanna be your lady. But I got a man at home. Even though I wanna see. How you put that thing on me. I can't let you get the best of me. Even though I wanna see. How you put that thing on me. I can't let you get the best of me. The best of me, the best of me. I see now. Carolina blue kicks, hottest nigga on the block. Used to wheelie bicycles since I was six. High school crossover, waived away picks. Music is the same shit, gave away hits. So ma, get it together or forget it forever. When I go at you hard I can get it through leather. You acting like Jigga can't get at whoever. Talking you got a man, okay ma, and?. That's high school making me chase you around for months. Have an affair, act like an adult for once. Plus my hand is up your skirt, goddamn you flirt. What's a little me on top gonna hurt?. Maybe a little but. Pain is pleasure and pressure bust pipes. And you look like the I like it rough type. We can crush tonight, tell me what you like. I got a yellow bottle on a bucket of ice. Get right, Young Hova"

Been patient for a minute, now I want mine. I hear a lot of niggas talking down. I'ma put my mothafuckin foot where the sun don't shine. Can't rhyme in a cypher like this. I've been rockin with the best. They don't put me on the list. I'm an underground king. Underrated in the streets favorite. Every street corner gonna speak bout this. Rest in peace Pimp C. Still got the muddy cup full of Morgan Freeman. yep, lean on me. Like Wu Tang cash rules everything around me. You know I got the cream on me. Gun barrel smoking like hydro. Middle fingers up fuck five-o. Still repine B's like an H-town nigga. When I'm finished in this bitch call Geico. You looking at a god man, I put that on the Bible. Killin' everything fuck rivals. Hundred round drum on the stick. When I let the bitch off man it sound like pyro. [Hook: Shanell]. Oh it's way past midnight. Shadows in them streetlights. Gotta trap for them niggas tryna act like. A bitch ain't got a whole team right. Yeah ahh. He think that he gone take it from me. He said I should give it up cause he got money. Told him I don't think that I can please ya. But I got a bunch of killas wanna meet ya"

tell no lies (feat. legacy (new boyz)),"[Hook: Shanell]. Said yes but I know. Youre really not that sure. Cause your eyes dont tell no lies. Walkin' that road, left everything you know. The mask you wear dont cover the windows to your soul. Cause your eyes dont tell no lies, your eyes dont tell no lies. [Verse 1: Legacy]. Ever since a child he wanted to be a rapper. Someone said he'd do anything to make it happen. Daddy died gang bangin, momma on drugs. Got a best friend but that nigga locked up. Had a girlfriend that'd be there if he lonely. Till she got drunk and she smashed all the homies. Couldn't stop the pain even after jiggas song. Like alotta bad sex so many did him wrong. He started to rappin but not to give a message. He just knew his fans would love. When nobody else except it. And if he was good he'd get the models on the banners. And maybe make enough to buy the condo in atlanta. That he, always wanted, really wanted. Was the key to the window that will lead him to his fortune. Then at least people would greet him if he lonely. He'd be free if he got it so he started. [Hook: Shanell]. Walkin' that road, left everything you know. The mask you wear dont cover the windows to your soul. Cause your eyes dont tell no lies, your eyes dont tell no lies. [Verse 2: Legacy]. A year passed, he finally got the deal. He wouldn't stop dreaming till he finally turnt it real. He froze at the question when they asked him how it feel. Saying he didn't do it for the love, he just did it for his self. All the kids saw was a man with a chain. So they idolised him like the man was a game. He thought about buying a phantom, a range. So that he could drive away from the past that he hate. He seemed like he beat every kid in the fame. He became even more distant from sane in the game. He ain't care about the stuff on his brain. If he said what he felt they would spit on his name. Kick him down, help him up just to kick him down again. And then they burried him. so long they won't remember his face. But he kept his smile on when anybody greet him. He knows what shoes a kid suppose to be in. [Hook: Shanell]. (We) walkin' that road, left everything you know. The mask you wear dont cover the windows to your soul. Cause your eyes dont tell no lies, your eyes dont tell no lies"

what is love,"Hurry hurry up I got a question, that needs to be answered. I really wanna know. I need to know about it. I never knew some many emotions. Could all add up to meaning the same thing. It's taking over about to give it in. Shackled up in these chains, I wanna live. Feeling like my freedom's gone. But I don't wanna be alone and write another sad song. I just really wanna know what is love. (What is, what is). What is love?. (What is, what is, what is love?). If it's so easy to let it go. Please define the word unconditional. What is love?. (What is, what is). What is love?. What does it have to be. What is love?. If it's so easy to let it go. I wanna know, I need to know. It's never ending couldn't see it over. Keep telling myself that it's getting closer. It shouldn't hurt. But the growing pain is something that I can't explain (?). I'm falling even deeper in this ocean. But not drowning on a need. Breathing in the sea. Such a four letter word is so hard to believe, I. I can love again. Teach me how to breathe again. Show me how to trust again. It's killing me slow. Damn, I really need to know. (What is, what is, what is love). If it's so easy to let it go. Please define the word unconditional. What is love. (What is, what is, what is love). What is love. What does it have to be. What is love. If it's so easy to let it go. I wanna know. I wanna know. I wanna know"

I've put into this love affair of ours, baby. I couldn't let you walk around thinking it's alright. To let me down, I remember. I remember the ways you used to love me. Baby I remember the ways. I remember the days you used to love me. I gave you all my precious love. And anything you wanted from me. You didn't hear me calling now. Calling for your warm affection. After all this time. You can't deny. What I'm feeling is real. And I stood by your side. I'll wait through the hurt and the pain. Then you turn and waltz away. I remember the ways you used to love me. I remember the days you used to love me"
