And frolicked in the autumn mist. In a land called Honah Lee. Oh!. Puff, the magic dragon. Lived by the sea. And frolicked in the autumn mist. In a land called Honah Lee.. A dragon lives forever,. But not little girls and boys.. Painted wings and giant rings. Make way for other toys.. One grey night it happened,. Jackie Paper came no more. And Puff that mighty dragon,. He ceased his fearless roar.. His head now bent in sorrow,. Green scales fell like rain,. And Puff no longer went to play. Along that cheery lane.. Without his life-long friend,. He could not be brave,. So Puff that mighty dragon. Sadly slipped into his cave.. Puff, the magic dragon. Lived by the sea. And frolicked in the autumn mist. In a land called Honah Lee. Oh!.

ryeowook honesty,"If you search for tenderness. it isn't hard to find.. You can have the love you need to live.. But if you look for truthfulness. You might just as well be blind.. It always seems to be so hard to get.. Honesty is such a lonely word.. Everyone is so untrue.. Honesty is hardly ever heard.. And mostly what I need from you.. I can always find someone. to say they sympathize.. If I wear my heart out on my sleeve.. But I don't want some pretty face. to tell me pretty lies.. All I want is someone to believe.. Honesty is such a lonely word.. Everyone is so untrue.. Honesty is hardly ever heard.. And mostly what I need from you.. I can find a lover.. I can find a friend.. I can have security until the bitter end.. Anyone can comfort me. with promises again.. I know, I know.. When I'm deep inside of me. don't be too concerned.. I won't as for nothin' while I'm gone.. But when I want sincerity. tell me where else can I turn.. Because you're the one I depend upon.. Honesty is such a lonely word.. Everyone is so untrue.. Honesty is hardly ever heard.. And mostly what I need from you."
