fake man,I was seated in that cold old bar. Looking hopefully you enter through this door. It's 2am and I can't find your eyes around. Maybe you're an invention of my mind. Hey man. Can you take my hand?. Are you made of paper or sand?. Hey man. Are you enjoying this life?. Will you love me til I die?. Fake man (living in a). Fake land (making). Fake plans (being a). Fake man. Cliche couples walking down that place. And we would be the ones who would collor this space. We would teach how love is a winning game. And how we can play it right and insane. Hey man. Can you take my hand?. Are you made of paper or sand?. Hey man. Are you enjoying this life?. Will you love me til I die?. Fake man (living in a). Fake land (making). Fake plans (being a). Fake man. If this love at least could exist. For You I would kill and die. If you at least could exist. I could be happy once in life. Hey man. Can you take my hand?. Are you made of paper or sand?. Hey man. Are you enjoying this life?. Will you love me til I die?. Fake man (living in a). Fake land (making). Fake plans (being a). Fake man
small town,Another day and I woke up thinking. Why I was there and what I was dreaming about. Living in a place where hopes are blind. Where time's stopped at least on my mind. People in their same quiet lives. Empty and boring streets at night. Everybody knowing every step that you take. Isn't it annoying or is it just a mistake?. This is a small town. And I walk around the avenue. This is a small town. And everybody knows what you do. This is a small town. And is the same quiet life. This is a small town. And people know all that you like. This is a small town. And I walk around the avenue. This is a small town. And everybody knows what you do. This is a small town. And is the same quiet life. This is a small town. And people know all that you like. Where the days seem so long. Where the nights seem so alone. Where routine become a rule. Where traditions become a true. Where every weekend. we go to the same places. Where everybody knows your face. Where boys and girls together are so lovely. But boys and boys and girls and girls. are so creepy. This is a small town. And I walk around the avenue. This is a small town. And everybody knows what you do. This is a small town. And is the same quiet life. This is a small town. And people know all that you like. This is a small town. And I walk around the avenue. This is a small town. And everybody knows what you do. This is a small town. And is the same quiet life. This is a small town. And people know all that you like. This is a small town. And I walk around the avenue. This is a small town. And everybody knows what you do. This is a small town. And is the same quiet life. This is a small town. And people know all that you like. This is a small town. And I walk around the avenue. This is a small town. And everybody knows what you do. This is a small town. And is the same quiet life. This is a small town. And people know all that you like
worked out,"10 months since you went away. 10 months alone, 10 months afraid. Trying to take you out of my mind somehow. Trying to hate ya since I wake up til the sun goes down. Bridge. And at night. I drink, I smoke, I tear it up to forget you. And at night. I kiss a lot of guys but they are not better than you. And at night. I dance in clubs all my favorite songs. And at night. I'm having fun in downtown doing everything wrong. Chorus. But it never worked out, worked out, worked out. It never worked out, worked out, worked out. It never worked out, worked out, worked out. Never worked out, never worked out. 10 months later, same old memories. Your smile, your face, your sweet way to be. And I still can hear your voice. Even trying the world, I have no choice. I'm so proud and smiling to the world. But inside I'm weak, unsure and cold. All day til the sun goes down. Bridge. And at night. I drink, I smoke, I tear it up to forget you. And at night. I kiss a lot of guys but they are not better than you. And at night. I dance in clubs all my favorite songs. And at night. I'm having fun in downtown doing everything wrong. Chorus. But it never worked out, worked out, worked out. It never worked out, worked out, worked out. It never worked out, worked out, worked out. Never worked out, never worked out. I still can see your smile on my mind. I still can see that day you kissed other guy. I still can see your mistakes and I still ask me why. I still can see we dancing together til the sun goes down. Bridge. And at night. I drink, I smoke, I tear it up to forget you. And at night. I kiss a lot of guys but they are not better than you. And at night. I dance in clubs all my favorite songs. And at night. I'm having fun in downtown doing everything wrong. Chorus. But it never worked out, worked out, worked out. It never worked out, worked out, worked out. It never worked out, worked out, worked out. Never worked out, never worked out. . And I cried, I lied, I tried. But it never worked out"
