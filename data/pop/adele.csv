To earn my stripes I'd have to pay. And bear my soul. I know I'm not the only one. Who regrets the things they've done. Sometimes I just feel it's only me. Who can't stand the reflection that they see. I wish I could live a little more. Look up to the sky, not just the floor. I feel like my life is flashing by. And all I can do is watch and cry. I miss the air, I miss my friends. I miss my mother, I miss it when. Life was a party to be thrown. But that was a million years ago. When I walk around all of the streets. Where I had grew up and found my feet. They can't look me in the eye. It's like they're scared of me. I try to think of things to say. Like a joke or a memory. But they don't recognize me now. In the light of day. I know I'm not the only one. Who regrets the things they've done. Sometimes I just feel it's only me. Who never became who they thought they'd be. I wish I could live a little more. Look up to the sky, not just the floor. I feel like my life is flashing by. And all I can do is watch and cry. I miss the air, I miss my friends. I miss my mother, I miss it when. Life was a party to be thrown. But that was a million years ago. A million years ago"
hometown glory,"I've been walking in the same way as I did. Missing out the cracks in the pavement. And tutting my heel and strutting my feet. ""Is there anything I can do for you dear? Is there. anyone I could call?"". ""No and thank you, please Madam. I ain't lost, just. wandering"". Round my hometown. Memories are fresh. Round my hometown. Ooh the people I've met. Are the wonders of my world. Are the wonders of my world. Are the wonders of this world. Are the wonders of this world. I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque. I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades. I like it in the city when two worlds collide. You get the people and the government. Everybody taking different sides. Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit. Shows that we are united. Shows that we ain't gonna take it. Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit. Shows that we are united. Round my hometown. Memories are fresh. Round my hometown. Ooh the people I've met. Are the wonders of my world. Are the wonders of my world. Are the wonders of this world. Are the wonders of this world"

black and gold,The fish swam out of the ocean. And grew legs and they started walking. And the apes climbed down from the trees. And grew tall and they started talking. And the stars fell out of the sky. And my tears rolled into the ocean. Now I'm looking for a reason why. You even set my world into motion. 'Cause if you're not really here. Then the stars don't even matter. Now I'm filled to the top with fear. But it's all just a bunch of matter. 'Cause if you're not really here. Then I don't want to be either. I wanna be next to you. Black and gold. Black and gold. Black and gold. I looked up into the grey sky. And see a thousand eyes staring back. And all around these golden beacons. I see nothing but black. I feel a way of something beyond them. I don't see what I can feel. If vision is the only validation. Then most of my life isn't real. 'Cause if you're not really here. Then the stars don't even matter. Now I'm filled to the top with fear. But it's all just a bunch of matter. 'Cause if you're not really here. Then I don't want to be either. I wanna be next to you.

The more I do, the less I know. But I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness. And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head. But don't you remember, don't you remember?.

He said to hold my breath and sit and wait,. I'll be home so soon, I won't be late,. He won't go,. He can't do it on his own,. If this ain't love, then what is?. He's willing to take the risk,.

hiding my heart,"This is how the story went. I met someone by accident,. That blew me away. That blew me away. It was in the darkest of my days. When you took my sorrow and you took my pain. And buried them away, you buried them away. I wish I could lay down beside you. When the day is done. And wake up to your face against the morning sun. But like everything I've ever known. You'll disappear one day. So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away. Dropped you off at the train station. Put a kiss on top of your head. Watched you wave. watched you wave. Then I went home to my skyscrapers,. Neon lights and waiting papers. That I call home. I call it home. I wish I could lay down beside you. When the day is done. And wake up to your face against the morning sun. But like everything I've ever known. You'll disappear one day. So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away. I woke up feeling heavy hearted. I'm going back to where I started. The morning rain. The morning rain. And though I wish that you were near. That same old road that brought me here. Is calling me home. Is calling me home. I wish I could lay down beside you. When the day is done. And wake up to your face against the morning sun. But like everything I've ever known. You'll disappear one day. So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away. And I can('t) spend my whole life hiding my heart away"
hometown glory,"I've been walking in the same way as I did. Missing out the cracks in the pavement. And tutting my heel and strutting my feet. ""Is there anything I can do for you dear? Is there. anyone I could call?"". ""No and thank you, please Madam. I ain't lost, just. wandering"". Round my hometown. Memories are fresh. Round my hometown. Ooh the people I've met. Are the wonders of my world. Are the wonders of my world. Are the wonders of this world. Are the wonders of this world. I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque. I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades. I like it in the city when two worlds collide. You get the people and the government. Everybody taking different sides. Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit. Shows that we are united. Shows that we ain't gonna take it. Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit. Shows that we are united. Round my hometown. Memories are fresh. Round my hometown. Ooh the people I've met. Are the wonders of my world. Are the wonders of my world. Are the wonders of this world. Are the wonders of this world"

i found a boy,"I thought I told you, he'd be home soon. Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true!. I fall short each time,. Every time he ain't here. You and your charm creep closer,. closer in here,. Like a fool for fire I fall,. With my pride and all!. Like a bomb before explosion,. Ticking by your call?. You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,. And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees.. (Chorus:). But I found a boy who I love more,. Than I ever did you before,. So stand beside the river I cried,. And let yourself down!. Look how you want me now that I don't need you!. So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees. At the first sight of you calling back to me. To whisper will you leave your man??. Cause you sweared that this time you can stand by me.. I won't stand by you!. (Chorus:). Cause I found a boy who I love more,. Than I ever did you before,. So stand beside the river I cried. And let yourself down!. Look how you want me now that I don't need you!. I ain't yours for no taking,. You must be mistaken. I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong. And ignore the right. (Chorus:). Well I found a boy who loves me more,. Than you ever did me before.. So stand beside the river you cried. And let yourself down!. Look how you want me. Now that I don't need you!"

Then our eyes cry and souls sigh. So that we know that it hurts. Every now and then my memories ache. With the empty ideas of the ones we'd made. But as time goes on and my age gets older. I love the ones I know. They're enough to picture the rain. Cause hearts break and hearts wait. To make us grow from dust. Then our eyes cry and souls sigh. So that we know that it hurts. Our hearts break and hearts wait. To make us grow from dust. Then our eyes cry and souls sigh. So that we know that it hurts. You know when to make me. I might. Just your heal (4x)

painting pictures,Painting pictures with my mind. Making memories using my eyes. Filling up my heart with golden stories. [To add] some spice to the rhythm of life. Ooh. Welcome sunrise with the morning glory. I've changed my mind. [There is no simple for me]. I want to see. I want to feel my heartbeat so. [With the world at your feet]. Leave. I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart. And it's teasing me. [To scratch my itch and beat my drum]. So I can start to begin what's begun. Painting pictures. Filling up my heart with golden stories [x2]. Running riot inside my soul. Fire burning and it's lighting me up. [To Scratch my itch and beat my drum]. So I can finish what has begun.

remedy,"I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be. So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe. Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life. This ain't easy it's not meant to be. Every story has its scars. When the pain cuts you deep. When the night keeps you from sleeping. Just look and you will see. That I will be your remedy. When the world seems so cruel. And your heart makes you feel like a fool. I promise you will see. That I will be, I will be your remedy. Ohh. No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you. Come whenever, I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through. Your love, it is my truth. And I will always love you. Love you, love you. When the pain cuts you deep. When the night keeps you from sleeping. Just look and you will see. That I will be your remedy. When the world seems so cruel. And your heart makes you feel like a fool. I promise you will see.

reminded,"She said if you love me let me know. If you don't then let me go. [Tyga - verse 1]. The memories soon fade, why couldn't they be erased. You hoping it's just a phase, your heart'll heal within days. Some people think it's wrong, being single isn't right. But you hurt the right person you'll be wrong all your life. Inevitable to let you go, separate the sexual. Feelings when I'm close to you, f-cking til' the sky is blue. Morning time, home fries, cooking with your t-shirt on. Panties, bra, damn I eat you good when you take it off. Ha, damn I'm nasty, I mean you make me nasty. Going the extra mile flying just to make me happy. Did it all, too much wasn't enough. Now it's gone but sometimes I sit and hope. [Adele]. I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded. I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited. But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded. I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited. But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. [Tyga - verse 2]. Whatever ever happened to love and being happy. Infatuated with lust, I loved you and now I'm backwards. Time is of the essence, I broke it, took it for granted. Love is like art, heartbroken on the canvas. Painted the perfect picture, you seemed to never get it. Colors prevail and you turn into a f-cking monster. Schizophrenic, nicknames Bonnie and Clyde. Now doctors calling us Mr. and Mrs. Hyde. How do you manage but still do you. Can't compromise, we all equal opportunists. It's when I'm level headed they aiming to take my head off. Birds flock together, tell bitches I'm throwing bread off. Cold, women, fall in love getting splintered?. Strictly plutonic, only thing she want is dinner. I can't fuck with her, get her some tonic, gin, liquor. She might let me lick her, now she miss me sayin. [Adele]. I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded. I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited. But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded. I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited. But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. [Tyga]. Angels in the a.m., sin on my flesh. Girls in the p.m., excuses PMS. They all wanna love em, call em Ms. Next. Spirit of a hustler, I only chase checks. Go home. I ain't tryna do you wrong. I'd rather be alone. Just sittin on the throne"

I gotta go. Oh, that you know. Ye that's it honey. I quit I'm movin' on. Oooohhhh. You made me want you. You made me leave you. You made me tumble. And fall. But if I can't have you the way I want you. I don't want you at all. Baby I can take a lot cause I love. Everything you got. Though your kisses fill me. So if you got someone else. I gotta go. Oh, that you know. So that?s it baby. I quit I'm movin' on. Ye that's it baby. I quit now. I'm movin' on"
tired,"Hold my hand. While you cut me down. It had only just begun. But now it's over now. And you're in the heat of moments. With your heart playing up cold. I'm between the middle. Watching hastiness unfold. In my eyes. Your were smiling. In the spotlight dancing. With the night. The night fell off your mind. I'm tired of trying. Your teasing it ain't enough. Fed up of biding your time. When I don't get nothing back. And for what. And for what. And for what. When I don't get nothing back. Boy, I'm tired. Where'd you go. When you stay behind. I looked up and inside down. And outside only to find. A double taking punching hard. And laughing at my smile. I get closer you obviously prefer her. Chorus:. I'm tired of trying. Your teasing ain't enough. Fed up of biding your time. When I don't get nothing back. And for what. And for what. And for what. When I dont get nothing back. Boy, I'm tired of trying. Your teasing ain't enough. Fed up of biding your time. When I don't get nothing back. And for what. And for what. And for what. When I don't get nothing back. Boy, I'm tired. (I should have known). Never mind said your open arms. I couldn't help. Believe the trick me. Back into them. Even though. (chorus). I'm tired of trying. Your teasing ain't enough. Fed up of biding your time. When I don't get nothing back. And for what. And for what. And for what. When I don't get nothing back. Boy, I'm tired of trying. Your teasing ain't enough. Fed up of biding your time. When I don't get nothing back. And for what. And for what. And for what. When I don't get nothing back. Boy, I'm tired"
turning tables,"Close enough to start a war,. All that I have is on the floor,. God only knows what we're fighting for,. All that I say, you always say more,. I can't keep up with your turning tables,. Under your thumb, I can't breathe,. So I won't let you close enough to hurt me,. No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me,. I cant give you what you think you gave me,. It's time to say goodbye to turning tables,. To turning tables,. Under hardest disguise I see, ooh,. Where love is lost, your ghost is found,. I braved a hundred storms to leave you,. As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down,. I can't keep up with your turning tables,. Under your thumb, I can't breathe,. So I won't let you close enough to hurt me,. No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me,. I cant give you what you think you gave me,. It's time to say goodbye to turning tables,. Turning tables,. Next time I'll be braver,. I'll be my own savior,. When the thunder calls for me,. Next time I'll be braver,. I'll be my own savior,. Standing on my own two feet,. I won't let you close enough to hurt me,. No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me,. I can't give you what you think you gave me,. It's time to say goodbye to turning tables,. To turning tables,. Turning tables, yeah,. Turning, oh."
water and a flame,"[Daniel:]. Seven days has gone so fast. I really thought the pain would pass. It's been nearly an hour. Since I thought of you. But you're not answering the phone. I'd settle for a busy tone. At least that I'd know that you're okay. A girl like you ain't meant to go away. Oh.... Now you're gone. There's nothing else I want. Now that it's over. There's nothing else I want. What have I done. Looks like I was wrong. Is everything really meant to change. I guess we're like water and a flame. Water and a flame.... [Adele:]. I'm tired of this empty house. I need a drink to get me out. A cup more till I forget your name. I saw a boy that looked like you. I didn't know quite what to do. It took a power of will to break my stare. I realized what I wanted wasn't there. Now you're gone. There's nothing else I want. Now that it's over. There's nothing else I want. What have I done. Looks like I was wrong. Is everything really meant to change. I guess we're like water and a flame. Water and a flame.... [Daniel:]. If you see me coming.... [Adele:]. I look away, I look away.... [Daniel:]. And if your mind is made up.... [Adele:]. I look away, I will look away.... [Daniel:]. If your worry bound. [Adele:]. I'm okay, I'm okay, yes I am. [Daniel:]. All this sorrow and this pain. is going to go away. [Daniel & Adele:]. Now you're gone. There's nothing else I want. Now that it's over. There's nothing else I want. What have I done. Looks like I was wrong. Is everything really meant to change. I guess we're like water and a flame. Water and a flame..."
water under the bridge,"If you're not the one for me. Then how come I can bring you to your knees. If you're not the one for me. Why do I hate the idea of being free?. And if I'm not the one for you. You've gotta stop holding me the way you do. Oh and if I'm not the one for you. Why have we been through what we have been through?. It's so cold out here in your wilderness. I want you to be my keeper. But not if you are so reckless. If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently. Don't pretend that you don't want me. Our love ain't water under the bridge. If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently. Don't pretend that you don't want me. Our love ain't water under the bridge. Woaah, woaaah. Say that our love ain't water under the bridge. What are you waiting for?. You never seem to make it through the door. And who are you hiding from?. It ain't no life to live like you're on the run. Have I ever asked for much?. The only thing that I want is your love. If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently. Don't pretend that you don't want me. Our love ain't water under the bridge. If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently. Don't pretend that you don't want me. Our love ain't water under the bridge. Woaah, woaaah. Say that our love ain't water under the bridge.

Our love ain't water under the bridge. If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently. Don't pretend that you don't want me. Our love ain't water under the bridge. Say it ain't so, say it ain't so. Say it ain't so, say it ain't so. Say it ain't so, say it ain't so. Say it ain't so, say it ain't so. Say that our love ain't water under the bridge. Say it ain't so, say it ain't so. Say it ain't so, say it ain't so. Say it ain't so, say it ain't so. Say it ain't so, say it ain't so. Say that our love ain't water under the bridge. Say that our love ain't water under the bridge"
when we were young,"Everybody loves the things you do. From the way you talk. To the way you move. Everybody here is watching you. Cause you feel like home. You're like a dream come true. But if by chance you're here alone. Can I have a moment. Before I go?. Cause I've been by myself all night long. Hoping you're someone I used to know. You look like a movie. You sound like a song. My God, this reminds me. Of when we were young. Let me photograph you in this light. In case it is the last time. That we might be exactly like we were. Before we realized. We were sad of getting old. It made us restless. It was just like a movie. It was just like a song. I was so scared to face my fears. Cause nobody told me that you'd be here. And I swore you moved overseas. That's what you said, when you left me. You still look like a movie. You still sound like a song. My God, this reminds me. Of when we were young. Let me photograph you in this light. In case it is the last time. That we might be exactly like we were. Before we realized. We were sad of getting old. It made us restless. It was just like a movie. It was just like a song. When we were young. When we were young. When we were young. When we were young. It's hard to win me back. Everything just takes me back. To when you were there. To when you were there. And a part of me keeps holding on. Just in case it hasn't gone. I guess I still care. Do you still care?. It was just like a movie. It was just like a song. My God, this reminds me. Of when we were young. When we were young. When we were young. When we were young. When we were young. Let me photograph you in this light. In case it is the last time. That we might be exactly like we were. Before we realized. We were sad of getting old. It made us restless. I'm so mad I'm getting old. It makes me reckless. It was just like a movie. It was just like a song. When we were young"

why do you love me,"Why do you love me, do you love me?. Why do you love me, do you love me?. Why do you love me, do you love me?. Why do you love me?. Why do you love me, do you love me?. Why do you love me, do you love me?. Why do you love me, do you love me?. Why do you love me?. Why do you love me?. There must be something in the water. Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew. How do you keep me coming back for more. After all we've been through. I can't decide if I should run and hide. It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands. Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why. I want you to love me. I want you to love me. I want you to love me. I want you to love me. Who knows why I love you. It could be something in the air I breath. Whatever it is, I bleed. Where does the time go?. I spend every single moment daydreaming of you. I can't describe how I feel, it feels right. It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands. Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why. I want you to love me. I want you to love me. I want you to love me. I want you to love me. You were a shock in the dark that blew me away. And you left your mark and it never will fade. You ignited a spark, let the fires away. Are you ready, ready?. You have a place in my heart that will always be yours. You are the peak and dark of my universe. Every piece and part, you were the first. I am ready, ready. It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands. Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why. I want you to love me. I want you to love me. I want you to love me. I want you. It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands. Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why. I want you to love me. I want you to love me. I want you to love me. I want you to love me. Why do you love me, do you love me?. Why do you love me, do you love me?. Why do you love me, do you love me?. Why do you love me, do you love me?"
you'll never see me again,"In the darkness of my heart. Is a shadow of your face. From the deepest part of my regret. I hear the words I wish I'd said. At the dawning of the day. I can't barely see the light, I. Make up memories in my head. They help to fill the emptiness you've left. I can't drown in your tears. I won't face your fears. I need to fight my own. You'll never see me again, I'll be better. In time. Let the waves take me under. I know I'll survive. You'll never see me again. At the dawning of the day. I can't barely see the light, I. Make up memories in my head. They help to fill the emptiness you've left. I can't drown in your tears. I won't face your fears. I need to fight my own. You'll never see me again, I'll be better. In time. Let the eaves take me under. I know I'll survive. Let the floor beneath of me fall. Let the sky come crashing down. Turn all my right to wrong. But after you life goes on. You'll never see me again. I've been learning to live without you, now. It's taken all of my stake. But I'm stronger now. You'll never see me again, I'll be better. In time. Let the waves take me under. I know I'll survive. Let the floor beneath of me fall. Let the sky come crashing down. Turn all my right to wrong. But after you life goes on. You'll never see me again. You'll never see me again. You'll never see me again"
