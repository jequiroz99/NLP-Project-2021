halfway there,If we never flew. We would never fall. If the world was ours. We would have it all. But the life we live. Isn't so simplistic. You just don't get what you want. So we take what comes.

We're halfway there. Looking back now. I never thought that I'd ever say. We're halfway there. We're halfway there. When the chips are down. Back against the wall. Got no more to give. Cause we gave it all. Seems like going the distance unrealistic. But we're too far from the start. So we take what comes and we keep on going. Leaning on each other's shoulder. Then we turn around. And see we come so far somehow. We're halfway there. We're looking good now. Nothing's gonna get in the way. We're halfway there. Looking back now. I never thought that I'd ever say. We're halfway there. We're halfway there. How you ever gonna reach the stars?. If you never get off the ground?. And you'll always be where you are. If you let life knock you down. We're halfway there. We're looking good now. Nothing's gonna get in the way. We're halfway there. Looking back now. I never thought that I'd ever say. We're halfway there. We're halfway there.

stronger (james maslow with ryan newman),"You know the bed feels warmer. Sleeping here alone. You know I dream in color. And do the things I want. You think you got the best of me.

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Stand a little taller. Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone. What doesn't kill you makes you a fighter. Footsteps even lighter. Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger. Just me, myself and I. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Stand a little taller. Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone. You heard that I was starting over with someone new. They told you I was moving on, and over you. You didn't think that I'd come back. I'd come back swinging. You try to break me but you'll see. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Stand a little taller. Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone. What doesn't kill you makes you a fighter. Footsteps even lighter. Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger. Just me, myself and I. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning. In the end. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Stand a little taller. Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone. What doesn't kill you makes you a fighter. Footsteps even lighter. Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger. Just me, myself and I.

I never thought, I would see your face, face again (face again). And then just like that, I saw you walking in. The doors of my show, sat down in the front row. I know what people say, don't get carried away. Say boy, you've got your whole life ahead of you. But what am I supposed to do?. Young love is taking me over your love. I'm losing control my heart stops, stops. When I get close to you. Like lightening, striking out of the blue. Young love, you're stealing my sleep, but so what. If you're feeling me, put your hands up, hands up. All around the world, everybody in young love. (Young love). I know what people say, don't get carried away.

(Young love). Oh yeah yeah. I was with my friends. Third street, walking the promenade. Then you pass by like a shooting star. I started falling for you without a warning"
