how deep is your love,"I know your eyes in the morning sun. I feel you touch me in the pouring rain. And the moment which you wander far from me. I wanna feel you in my arms again.

wish you were here,"You're living your life. In somebody else's heart. My love is as strong. As oceans are far apart. A summer song keeps playing in my brain. And I feel you and I see your face again. There's no escape, I lost everything in losing you. Ahh, I wish you were here. Dryin' these tears I cry. They were good times. And I wish you were here. Calling my name. But you're dealing with a man insane the cost. How hopelessly I'm lost. I tried to throw your love away. But I can't let go. And so I awake. In somebody else's dreams. (It's not what it seems) it's only a lie. I've yet to decide who's real. The blood red rose that will never die. It'll burn like a flame in the dark of the night. I'm not afraid. I'd give everything if you hear me there. Ahh, I wish you were here. Dryin' these tears I cry. They were good times. It's that time of year for being alone. But you're dealing with a heart of stone. Try to kiss and say goodbye. Try to throw our love away. And that storm will blow. Wish you were here (2x). But you're dealing with a heart of stone. Try to kiss and say goodbye. Try to throw our love away. And I can't let go. They were good times. And I wish you were here. Yes, I wish you here. By Eric Lopes"

how can you mend a broken heart?,I can think of younger days when living for my life. Was everything a man could want to do. I could never see tomorrow. But I was never told about the sorrows. And how can you mend a broken heart?. How can you stop the rain from falling down?. How can you stop the sun from shining?. What makes the world go round?. How can you mend this broken man?. How can a loser ever win?. Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again. I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees. And misty memories of days gone by. I could never see tomorrow. No one said a word about the sorrow. And how can you mend a broken heart?. How can you stop the rain from falling down?. How can you stop the sun from shining?. What makes the world go round?. How can you mend this broken man?. How can a loser ever win?. Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again
(i love) being in love with you,I thought I'd already touched the sky. I got to know you and I don't know why. But all of my life couldn't mean as much. As just being touched by you. I never thought of me growing up. Got my directions but the road was rough. It's only the dream of a teenage queen. But somehow I made it through. And I'd love to see. Those faces of those friends I left behind. And even those who spoke for me. Just trying to be kind. And no one said I love you just the way. I know you do. * And I love being in love with you. Living inside your heart. The giving and the taking. You are not forsaken. I love being in love with you. Thank you just for choosing me. That we should be. Being in love forever. I stare and wonder at what I found. I just discovered why the world is round. Round in a circle my arms will be. And doing the same as you. It ain't right it's only for you and me. Only the lonely so it seperately. Keep it alive on the food of love. But only the chosen few. In my life you see some changes in me. We listen and we grow. Any child that clings to childish things. is trying to let go. And up to now. I'd thought I'd seen as far as I could see. (repeat * twice and fade out).
more than a woman,"Oh, girl I've known you very well. I've seen you growing everyday. I never really looked before. but now you take my breath away. Suddenly you're in my life. part of everything I do. you got me working day and night. just trying to keep a hold on you. Here in your arms I found my paradise. my only chance for happiness. and if I lose you now I think I would die. Oh say you'll always be my baby. we can make it shine, we can take forever. just a minute at a time. Oh, oh, oh. More than a woman, more than a woman to me. more than a woman, more than a woman to me. Oh, oh, oh. There are stories old and true. of people so in love like you and me. and I can see myself. let history repeat itself. Reflecting how I feel for you. thinking of those people then. I know that in a thousand years. I'd fall in love with you again. This is the only way that we should fly. this is the only way to go. and if I lose you love I know I would die. Oh say you'll always be my baby. we can make it shine, we can take forever. just a minute at a time. Oh, oh, oh, oh. More than a woman, more than a woman to me. more than a woman, more than a woman to me"
don't forget to remember,Oh my heart won't believe that you have left me. I keep telling my self that it's true. I can get over anything you want my love. But I can't get myself over you. Don't forget to remember me. And the love that used to be. I still remember you. I love you. In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above. Don't forget to remember me my love. On my wall lies a photograph of you girl. Though I try to forget you somehow. You're the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole. Let me try to go on living right now. Don't forget to remember me. And the love that used to be. I still remember you. I love you. In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above. Don't forget to remember me my love
for whom the bell tolls,I stumble in the night. Never really knew what it would've been like. You're no longer there to break my fall. The heartache over you. I gave it every thing but I couldnt get through. I never saw the signs. You're the last to know when love is blind. Through the tears and the turbulant years. When I would not wait for no one. Didn't stop take a look at myself. See me losing you. When a lonely heart breaks. It's the one that forsakes. It's the dream that we stole. And I'm missing you more. And the fire that will roar. There's a hole in my soul. For you it's goodbye. For me it's to cry. For whom the bell tolls. Hold me. I've seen you in a magazine. A picture at a party where you shouldn't have been. Hanging on the arm of someone else. I'm still in love with you. Won't you come back to you're little boy blue. I've come to feel inside. This precious love was never mine. Now I know but a little too late. That I could not live without you. In the dark or the broad daylight. I promise i'll be there. When a lonely heart breaks. It's the one that forsakes. It's the dream that we stole. And I'm missing you more. And the fire that will roar. There's a hole in my soul. For you it's goodbye. For me it's to cry. For whom the bell tolls. Never knew there'd be times like this. When I couldnt reach out to know one. Am I never gonna find someone. that knows me like you do. Are you leaving me a helpless child. When it took so long to save me. Fight the devil and the deep blue sea. I'll follow you anywhere. I promise i'll be there. When a lonely heart breaks. It's the one that forsakes. It's the dream that we stole. And I'm missing you more. And the fire that will roar. There's a hole in my soul. For you it's goodbye. For me it's to cry. For whom the bell tolls. When a lonely heart breaks. It's the one that forsakes. It's the dream that we stole. And I'm missing you more. And the fire that will roar. There's a hole in my soul. For you it's goodbye. For me it's to cry. For whom the bell tolls. When a lonely heart breaks. It's the one that forsakes. It's the dream that we stole. And I'm missing you more. And the fire that will roar. There's a hole in my soul......

alone,"I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke. I could make a woman hang on every single stroke. I was an iron man. I had a master plan. But I was alone. I could hear you breathing. With a sigh of the wind. I remember how your body started trembling. Oh, what a night it's been. And for the state I'm in. I'm still alone. And all the wonders made for the Earth. And all the hearts in all creation. Somehow, I always end up alone. Always end up alone. So I play, I'll wait. 'Cause you know that love takes time. We came so far. Just the beat of a lonely heart. And it's mine. I don't want to be alone. Well, since I got no message on your answer phone. And since your busy every minute. I just stay at home. I make believe you care. I feel you everywhere. But I'm still alone. I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate. 'Cause I know it isn't heaven, is it love or hate. Am I the subject of the pain. Am I the stranger in the rain. I am alone. And is there glory there to behold. Maybe it's my imagination. Another story there to be told. So I play, I'll wait. And I pray it's not too late. You know we came so far. Just the beat of a lonely heart. And it's mine. I don't want to be alone. And all the wonders made for the Earth. And all the hearts in all creation. Another story there to be told. So I play, I'll wait. And I pray it's not too late. You know we came so far. Just the beat of a lonely heart. And it's mine. I don't want to be alone. Gone, but not out of sight. I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home. Face the heat of the night. The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone. Shine and search for the light. And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean. And clean out of sight. I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home"
emotions,"It's over and done. but the heartache lives on inside. And who's the one you're clinging to. instead of me tonight?. And where are you now, now that I need you?.

love so right,"She came on like the night and she held on tight. And the world was right when she made love to me. We were free. She moved in like a friend, started loving me. And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms. But the morning when I woke up. I was here and she was gone. Now I'm hanging on. Maybe you can tell me. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong. Where did she go when I need her close to me. And the perfect story ended at the start. I thought you came forever. And you came to break my heart. Now I'm hanging on,. On the chance that you'll come back to me. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling. I could take it in my stride. Start living for the moment. Maybe half the things we sought were never there. Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size. It isn't really fair. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling (repeat/fade)"

(i love) being in love with you,I thought I'd already touched the sky. I got to know you and I don't know why. But all of my life couldn't mean as much. As just being touched by you. I never thought of me growing up. Got my directions but the road was rough. It's only the dream of a teenage queen. But somehow I made it through. And I'd love to see. Those faces of those friends I left behind. And even those who spoke for me. Just trying to be kind. And no one said I love you just the way. I know you do. * And I love being in love with you. Living inside your heart. The giving and the taking. You are not forsaken. I love being in love with you. Thank you just for choosing me. That we should be. Being in love forever. I stare and wonder at what I found. I just discovered why the world is round. Round in a circle my arms will be. And doing the same as you. It ain't right it's only for you and me. Only the lonely so it seperately. Keep it alive on the food of love. But only the chosen few. In my life you see some changes in me. We listen and we grow. Any child that clings to childish things. is trying to let go. And up to now. I'd thought I'd seen as far as I could see. (repeat * twice and fade out).
(love is) thicker than water,"Love is higher than a mountain. Love is thicker than water. You are this dreamers only dream. Heaven's angel , devil's daughter.

That's what I'm living for. Love is , higher than a mountain. Love is , thicker than water. You are this dreamers only dream. Heaven's angel , devil's daughter. (break). Say my thought, should I find out she don't care at all. She'll leave me crying in the end. Wandering through the afterglow. But I can't leave her. While I need her more then she needs you. That's what I'm praying for. Love is , higher than a mountain. Love is , thicker than water. You are this dreamers only dream. Heaven's angel , devil's daughter. Love is , higher than a mountain.

(our love) don't throw it all away,"Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why. But lately you don't talk to me. Darling I can't see me in your eyes. I hold you near but you're so far away. but let your love float back to me. how can you leave and let this feeling die. You alone are the living thing. that keeps me alive.

a day in the life,"I read the news today, oh boy,. about a lucky man who made the grade.. And though the news was rather sad,. well, I just had to laugh,. I saw the photograph.. He blew his mind out in a car.. He hadn't noticed that the lights had changed.. A crowd of people stood and stared,. they'd seen his face before.. Nobody was really sure. if he was from the House of Lords.. I saw a film today, oh boy.. The English army had just won the war.. A crowd of people turned away. but I just had to look,. having read the book.. I'd love to turn you on.. Woke up, fell out of bed,. dragged a comb across my head,. found my way downstairs and drank a cup,. and looking up I noticed I was late.. Found my coat and grabbed my hat,. made the bus in seconds flat,. found my way upstairs and had a smoke,. somebody spoke and I went into a dream.. Ah ah ah.... I read the news today, oh boy,. four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire.. And though the holes were rather small. they had to count them all,. now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.. I'd love to turn you on."

alone,"I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke. I could make a woman hang on every single stroke. I was an iron man. I had a master plan. But I was alone. I could hear you breathing. With a sigh of the wind. I remember how your body started trembling. Oh, what a night it's been. And for the state I'm in. I'm still alone. And all the wonders made for the Earth. And all the hearts in all creation. Somehow, I always end up alone. Always end up alone. So I play, I'll wait. 'Cause you know that love takes time. We came so far. Just the beat of a lonely heart. And it's mine. I don't want to be alone. Well, since I got no message on your answer phone. And since your busy every minute. I just stay at home. I make believe you care. I feel you everywhere. But I'm still alone. I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate. 'Cause I know it isn't heaven, is it love or hate. Am I the subject of the pain. Am I the stranger in the rain. I am alone. And is there glory there to behold. Maybe it's my imagination. Another story there to be told. So I play, I'll wait. And I pray it's not too late. You know we came so far. Just the beat of a lonely heart. And it's mine. I don't want to be alone. And all the wonders made for the Earth. And all the hearts in all creation. Another story there to be told. So I play, I'll wait. And I pray it's not too late. You know we came so far. Just the beat of a lonely heart. And it's mine. I don't want to be alone. Gone, but not out of sight. I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home. Face the heat of the night. The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone. Shine and search for the light. And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean. And clean out of sight. I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home"

People , the sun is going down on your heads so read your paper. There's no one there for you to confide in. It's instinct to always to have a shoulder to cry on. And to rely on. Someone there to share and to shine on. I am alone again. You can't believe the tears that I've shed. I'm on a bound down train. Don't desert me now or I am dead. I am alone again.

So tall, so wide, so high above the rumble of thunder down below. It's your love I need, it's the only show. And it's you want an everlasting dream. can take us anywhere are the tears of yesterday. We killed the pain , we blew away the memories of the tears we cried. And an everlasting love will never die. Take me out of the cold. Give me what I've hungered for. If it's the pleasure of taking my heart that you need. Then it only makes me love you more. I was yours before the stars were born and you were mine. I could have saved you all the pain you knew. And I won't make you cry. And maybe an everlasting love can try. Ah, we got an everlasting love. So tall , so wide, so high above the rumble of thunder down below.

We share together what we found. The force of love is all around. And it echoes down the mountainside. Little bit of soul we hide. Find us lost without a trace. Oh Lord. This is a lonely place. Gone gone childhood days. Gone in so many ways. In all my children you can see. What old aquaintance means to me. Drean is mine and here it stays. All wrapped up in my childhood days.

Then I'll be the only one. Don't wanna be , don't wanna be the only one. I saw him yesterday. The questions he asked. I think he knows about us. Did we move too fast. How can we hide it. When we know it's a lie. Keep our love under the covers. The pressure is too high. Why do I get myself tied up. Why tangle with love you borrow. I should have been known as a one man woman. Should have been one love but oh no. Never be a cure for the human law. (repeat * )."

don't want to live inside myself,I am the searcher of my fortunes. I've got my right hand on the wheel. We've got to dig for buried treasures. I know exactly how I feel. I went walkin'thru a grave-yard. Where the darkness is my friend. I heard all about the beginning. I wanna see just where it ends. I have fed the jaded tiger. And every tiger knows my name. But just as long as long as I can see my face. I can tell myself my name. Don't want to live inside myself. I'm much better of alone. But then you must believe in the fallin'rain. In the morning. Bury me down by the river. Saved by the bell.

evolution,There's a law in what we do. We got a quest for something new. Everything you witness seems to. Let you down. If someone gets you from behind. I got an open mind. And you've been thirsty for the friend you found. Close your eyes and make a wish. I don't wanna mess with mother nature. Knowing that you're mine. You said I could see. You with another and we all get satisfied. (CHORUS). It's a form of evolution. It's a kind of movin' on. An eternal source of pleasure. In being the one. When your love is for the giving. It's a case of destiny. You know we look for the same insane games. Got to be commital to be a little deviation. So I get all wound up inside. I can see your scene unwind. You dance together or you dance alone. And leave the real world in the air. Love it in leather I don't care. Everything is legal in the danger zone. Close your eyes and make a wish. Later we could cater to the animal. Knowing that you're mine. It's straight in my face. You and your lover and the brain is paralyzed. (CHORUS). It's a form of evolution. It's a kind of movin' on. It's a cycle of emotion. In being the one. In the storm of revolution. What is done can be undone. You know we look for the same insane games. Got to be commital. To the subtle variations. (CHORUS). It's a form of evolution. It's a kind of movin' on. It's a cycle of emotion. In being the one. If your love is for the givin'. It's a case of destiny. And you can find your source of pleasure. In being with me.

You got brain drain , long as there's a game to play. Sad, but there's only one fool to blame. It's a fine line between taking and giving. It's a fine line. It's a fine line between dancing and making love. It's a fine line. You don't think my love should tie you down. I say love can turn your groove around. Watch me please you. Watch me play your game. Someday love will make your water flow."

for whom the bell tolls,I stumble in the night. Never really knew what it would've been like. You're no longer there to break my fall. The heartache over you. I gave it every thing but I couldnt get through. I never saw the signs. You're the last to know when love is blind. Through the tears and the turbulant years. When I would not wait for no one. Didn't stop take a look at myself. See me losing you. When a lonely heart breaks. It's the one that forsakes. It's the dream that we stole. And I'm missing you more. And the fire that will roar. There's a hole in my soul. For you it's goodbye. For me it's to cry. For whom the bell tolls. Hold me. I've seen you in a magazine. A picture at a party where you shouldn't have been. Hanging on the arm of someone else. I'm still in love with you. Won't you come back to you're little boy blue. I've come to feel inside. This precious love was never mine. Now I know but a little too late. That I could not live without you. In the dark or the broad daylight. I promise i'll be there. When a lonely heart breaks. It's the one that forsakes. It's the dream that we stole. And I'm missing you more. And the fire that will roar. There's a hole in my soul. For you it's goodbye. For me it's to cry. For whom the bell tolls. Never knew there'd be times like this. When I couldnt reach out to know one. Am I never gonna find someone. that knows me like you do. Are you leaving me a helpless child. When it took so long to save me. Fight the devil and the deep blue sea. I'll follow you anywhere. I promise i'll be there. When a lonely heart breaks. It's the one that forsakes. It's the dream that we stole. And I'm missing you more. And the fire that will roar. There's a hole in my soul. For you it's goodbye. For me it's to cry. For whom the bell tolls. When a lonely heart breaks. It's the one that forsakes. It's the dream that we stole. And I'm missing you more. And the fire that will roar. There's a hole in my soul. For you it's goodbye.

gilbert green,"On a hill , inside a house in Covewell Reach ,. stands a man who's feeling very tired. Looking at a song he wrote some time ago. Could have made it big inside a Broadway show. Every day I go away and find ideas. Think, I'll climb on top of somewhere high. Couldn't I write a song about a man who's dead. Didn't really know if he was off his head. Ev'rybody knows , that's the way it goes. Too bad for Gilbert Green. We can tell the world that he was right. Sitting in his attic on a sunny day. Mending 50 goblets that are worn. Humming to himself a song of yesteryear. His hearing wasn't good but his eyes were clear. Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes. Too bad for Gilbert Green. We can tell the world that he was right. Now the house is burnt along with Gilbert Green. Sad to see his sisters stand and cry. And in the basement lies a song that wasn't seen. Tells the tale of laughing men and yellow beans. Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes. Too bad for Gilbert Green."

Maybe I can't survive in the danger zone. Sounds of the night. Streets without light. And baby's not alone. Try to hold her to myself. Someone else is breaking all my dreams, she. Needs so many games to play. One more time I climb the stairs. Open up the door and she was gone. And baby here I go. Like a lamb to slaughter. Don't stop haunting me in this old house.

But you keep haunting me in this old town. (SPOKEN). And the smile is no longer there. The face and the eyes and the hair. Nothing stands the test of time. You live forever, never mine. I cling to dreams that turn to sand. Our life is now a distant land. We commit emotional suicide. Every single room is electrified. Your memory shadowing me. The house where sorrow hides. Pull it down, blow it up. Help me send these walls of love away. And baby here I go. Like a lamb to slaughter. Don't stop haunting me in this old house. I still love you when you're not around. I'm still waiting for your midnight ride. I'll still love you when it's cold outside. Me so sorry that I let you down."

"how to fall in love, pt. 1","I got a bad sensation. The enemy is all around. The traces of my naked heart. Are laid upon the ground. I suffered side effects. That might have been forever. Even in my dreams. And I was left alone to pray. When there was no one in the way. And nothin' what it seemed. And from a hard time, play time. Took a trip around the world. Made myself invisible. The taste was in the wine. And just when the thought of someone. Needing me forever. I don't believe the words are true. That only she could be my savior. Experience is not enough. I'll show you how to fall in love. She said experience is not enough. I'll show you how to fall in love. And she's all alone with me. Every night. And lighting all my days of sorrow. On my own. If there was any more to give. You know I'd sacrifice it for her. And in the prime of my life. I was blessed and I was sent. Someone sweet and innocent. And nervous when she kissed. And in the face of my. Forbidden fruit forever. Miracles are mine. And knowing I'm the first. In her secret universe. There's no sense of space and time. You take a small town, young girl. Someone warm and wonderful. That any man would understand. That love is like the wind. Something deep inside to give you. And when the words get in the way. The only thing you need is silence. Experience is not enough. I'll show you how to fall in love. She said experience is not enough."

You make me nervous but it's now or never. Oh Oh. You can be my message from above. And it's time to say you're sorry. We can sanctify our love. Oh no. And you and I we're written in the wind. You can't just go movin' out. You can't leave me when I'm movin' in. I want to be your human sacrifice. I want to be your lover. I want to be your human sacrifice. I want to be your lover. It's you or me. Gotta be a kill or cure. Maybe undergo a lover's operation. Nothing cuts like a knife can. You don't wanna hurt me more. Look at all that damage. We could do together. Oh no. You can wear me closer to the bone. It don't work to make me worry. But the demon seed is sown. Oh no. And you and I we're written in the sky. You can't make me hold on. Better you shoot my love between the eyes. Your eyes on me on this table where I lie. And what I see as fact is fiction. You won't let me die. And I'm bound to be abused. I won't let you cut me loose. This love is out to get you.

i will always love you,I saw you tonight. In the room where love had started once before. And we opened up the skies. With your loving eyes. You take me back where you belong in my heart. One love frozen in time. Never be a bad love. Yours and mine. But I still remain. I will never change. I will always love you. I will always take your part. And all the years of losing you. And then being close to you again. The very chance that I could take your heart. Your hand in mine. You are inside of me. One more time. Don’t you remember me. And the days that lie ahead. May all go wrong. But tonight my love. There’s no question in my mind where we should be. It’s clear that you’re alone and I’m alone. And all the fools have gone. You open up so tears can fall from your eyes. True love can never die. We can make it one day - if we try. Be there - sunshine or rain. I will never change. I will always love you. I will always take your part. And all the years of losing you and then. Making love to you again. The very chance that I could take your heart. Your hand in mine. I got a memory. For all time. Don’t you remember me. Now my dream will come true. If you love me. I will always love you. I will always take your part. And all the years of losing you and then. Making love to you again. The very chance that I could take your heart. Your hand in mine
i will be there,"(B, R & M Gibb). This is the life you saved laid out before you. Everything that I think I have been and what I am now. Nothing can change the way I feel about you. Better we go on our separate ways. Nothing is left but the endless days. Nothing to cry but your name. Don't you look back, don't say a word. I will be lonely for you, I will be standing for you. Don't you despair. I will be there for you. Farewell to you, goodbye for me. I will be waiting for you, I will be lonely for you. Don't you despair. I will be there for you. Ohh, ohh. I will be there. Ohh, ohh. I will be there. Maybe this time next year we'll be together. You can wipe away all of the tears, bring truth to the lies. There was a silent dream, we made a promise. We'd be there for each other forever. Borne like a ship on the ocean's roar. Beating a path to your open door. Nothing will keep me away. Don't you look back, don't say a word. I will be lonely for you, I will be standing for you. Don't you despair. I will be there for you. Each night I pray, to God above. You will be waiting for me, you will be lonely for me. Don't you despair. I will be there for you. Ohh, ohh. I will be there. Ohh, ohh. I will be there. Ohh, ohh. I will be there. Ohh, ohh. I will be there. Ohh, ohh."
i'd like to leave if i may,"How can I meet other girls when you won't let me go. My heart's still in a whirl and gee I feel so low. I don't know why I feel this way. I'd like to leave if I may. I can't go to play ,you have got a hold on me. You make me work all day. Why don't you set me free. You're on my mind almost all hours of the day. I'd like to leave if I may. It's plain to see that I don't need ya anymore. Why don't you stay beside , and let me through the door. I know that in my life I've made one big mistake. You'll only hurt me more if we don't make the break. I'm telling you , so hear what I say. I'd like to leave if I may. It's plain to see that I don't need ya anymore. Why don't you stay beside , and let me through the door. I know that in my life I've made one big mistake. You'll only hurt me more if we don't make the break. I'm telling you , so hear what I say. I'd like to leave if I may. I'd like to leave if I. Won't you let me leave if I."
i'd love you to want me,"When I saw you standing there. I about fell off my chair. When you moved your mouth to speak. I felt the blood go to my feet. Now it took time for me to know. What you tried so not to show. Something in my soul just cried. I see the want in your blue eyes. Baby, I'd love you to want me. The way that I want you. The way that it should be. Baby, you'd love me to want you. The way that I want to. If you'd only let it be. You told yourself years ago. You'd never let your feelings show. The obligation that you made. For the title that they gave. Baby, I'd love you to want me. The way that I want you. The way that it should be. Baby, you'd love me to want you. The way that I want to. If you'd only let it be. Now it took time for me to know. What you tried so not to show. Something in my soul just cried. I see the want in your blue eyes. Baby, I'd love you to want me. The way that I want you. The way that it should be. Baby, you'd love me to want you. The way that I want to. If you'd only let it be"
i'll kiss your memory,Maybe it's been so long. Our house looks kind of different. But the empty rooms still mean the same to me. And as I wander through the darkness. I'll keep crying one last tear. Now your lips are gone. I'll kiss your memory. Chorus:. I'll kiss your memory. As though you were here. I'll hold your memories till you reappear. And as I wander through the darkness. I'll keep crying one last tear. Now your lips are gone. I'll kiss your memory. I'll kiss the thoughts of leaves that fell when summer was over. And I'll cherish all the thoughts you gave to me. And I will wander through the darkness. I'll keep crying one last tear. Now your lips are gone. I'll kiss your memory.
i'll know what to do,"I........ If I fall in love , it's only with you. And if I call for love, it's got to be true. But if you fail . to keep it a tie. Then I'll know, it's only a lie. And I'll know what to do. Oh, I'll know what to do. If you wear my ring , you wear it for me. You've got to wear that thing indefinitely. And if you're bad , even just for a while. I'll be sad , then I'll push you behind. 'cause I know what to do. Oh I know what to do. I........ I am a man of words, the few words I say. If you play my game , you play it my way. If you don't , one look in your eye. And I'll know, you're telling me lies. And I'll know what to do. I know what to do. I...... Oh I'll know what to do."
i'm not wearing any make-up,"In search of a new tomorrow. The love that I hope to find. The dream that I seem to follow. Round in circles every time. You were always there. When I was on my own. There were lonely voices calling. There's a night that's falling. And I'll make you feel the voodoo. What I do to you. And if I set you free. I lose your love forever. But that's the darkest side of me. The games we love to play. I don't mind your lies. Are we friends or are we enemies. Tell me what the message is. Love is blind. I'm not wearing any make-up now. Everything you see is real. God only knows , we fall in love. God only knows, we fall apart. Do we turn around and walk away. Never wise enough to know that it was beautiful. Telling me it's beautiful. Telling me it's beautiful. To think that I was sent to hurt you. You say that I went too far. You say that to stay forever. Then you tell me nevermore. I was always there. Before you turn to stone. There were lonely voices calling. There's a night that's falling. And I'll make you feel the voodoo. What I do to you. And what you did to me. And bringing us together. But that's the darkest side of me. The games we love to play. I don't mind your lies. Are we friends or are we enemies. Tell me what the message is. Love is blind. I'm not wearing any make-up. Everything you see is real. God only knows we fall in love. Do we turn around and walk away. Never wise enough to know that it was beautiful. Telling me it's beautiful. I'm not wearing any make-up. Everything you see is real. God only knows we fall in love."
i'm satisfied,"With you , baby I'm satisfied , making my love to you. 'cause you got me hypnotized. And you came to me alone girl. I was a heart that's made of stone girl. And you broke it down in pieces. And you took me for your own girl. I lie beneath your ecstasy. You can pour it all over me. I won't break the chains of loving you. We got ev'rything , anybody needs. And it's here with me ,with you. Baby I'm satisfied , makin' my love to you. (makin' my love , makin' my love). 'cause you got me hypnotized. Before you took me by the hand girl. I was a statue in the sand girl. I was broken down for reasons. You could never understand girl. I was living on desire. But that was just the way we were. Till you make a world of love in you. We got ev'rything , anybody needs. And it's here with me , with you. Baby I'm satisfied , making my love to you. 'cause you got me hypnotized. Anytime you wander, get yourself back to me girl. Any cloud you're under , you got to get yourself free girl. Ahh, ahh, baby with you. Baby I'm satisfied , making' my love to you. 'cause you got me hypnotized , oh baby , with you."
i'm weeping,"When I was 10 years old, my parents were poor. Our house was so cold. And I was still in school and learning. And then I never really got too far. And ev'ryone we knew had money. And driving a car, and driving a car. Now I'm twenty-one. The street where I lived is blown up and gone. And I've had a good day crying. And the world around has changed alot. I never really gave much more."

i've gotta get a message to you,"The preacher talked to me and he smiled,. Said, ""Come and walk with me, come and walk one more mile.. Now for once in your life you're alone,. But you ain't got a dime,. There's no time for the phone."". I've just got to get a message to you,. Hold on, hold on.. One more hour and my life will be through,. Hold on, hold on.. I told him I'm in no hurry,. But if I broke her heart,. Won't you tell her I'm sorry.. And for once in my life I'm alone,. And I've got to let her know just in time before I go. I've just got to get a message to you,. Hold on, hold on.. One more hour and my life will be through,. Hold on, hold on.. Well I laughed but that didn't hurt,. And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt. Now I'm crying but deep down inside,. Well I did it to him, now it's my turn to die"
i.o.i.o.,"I.O.I.O.. You know I love getting up in the morning. When the sun first strikes the trees. All the morning birds that sing above. Still bring back memories. Of a girl who stood beside me. When the rights I did were wrong. But she went back down the river. Just when I thought I could be strong. When I thought I could be strong, so I sing. I.O.I.O.. She never told me why she left me. But the letter said goodbye. Now my mornings are for wond'ring. And my nights to reason why. Why a stranger comes to steal the love. Of a girl I had to hold. But she went back down the river. Just when I thought I could be strong. When I thought I could be strong, so I sing. I.O.I.O.."
idea,I been thinking sitting on a pole.. I'm getting sick of doing what I'm told.. Just me and the mirror and my brain.. But that was when I got an idea.. Came like a gun and shot in my ear.. Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?. Fifteen years I lay down on the ground.. I couldn't feel any noise or hear any sound.. Fifteen million years I spent down the line.. But that was when I got an idea.. Came like a gun and shot in my ear.. Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?. Get up and stand alone. music. That was when I got an idea.. Came like a gun and shot in my ear.. Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?. Get up and stand alone..

If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby,. If I can't have you... ahhh!. Can't let go and it doesn't matter how I try.. I gave it all so easily. To you my love.

Why, tell me why I made her cry. If only had my mind on something else.. verse 2:. Captain of the submarine,beneath the icebergs never seen.. A hero with a medal for ev'ryday..

i’ll kiss your memory,Maybe it’s been so long. Our house looks kind of different. But the empty rooms still mean the same to me. And as I wander through the darkness. I’ll keep crying one last tear.

I’ll keep crying one last tear. Now your lips are gone. I’ll kiss your memory. I’ll kiss the thoughts of leaves that fell when summer was over. And I’ll cherish all the thoughts you gave to me. And I will wander through the darkness. I’ll keep crying one last tear. Now your lips are gone. I’ll kiss your memory. Chorus.

My love was blind. You call me when your storm is over. Crying over love that I can give you. When the night is the colder. Holding on to me. Cos it’s so hard letting go. And it’s so hard not to cry. With your face that lies,. you memorize. The reason why. And when love is gone. Then one of us will know. It’s so hard letting go. Foolish that I still believe. That love should never die. It makes me cry to witness. where the story ends. All the lovers in the world wil. Echo all the words that I will leave you. When the night is lonely. Only goes to show. That it’s so hard letting go. And it’s so hard not to cry. And I kneel for yesterday. When you were mine. And when the love is gone. Then one of us will know. It’s so hard letting go..."

life goes on,"Pardon me , if I use you in my dreams. You throw those angel eyes at me. Or could the beautiful woman be more than she seems. But she is not in love with me. All of my life I been looking for someone to carry my love away. A chip on my shoulder , a misery , suddenly there you are. Nobody knows , but she knows that I love her. It's got to be growing.

And there's a part of me with you. But all of me loves you. Nobody gave me the feeling you gave me. I'm so proud of. All of my days I will be here for you. And the love keeps running. And if I can't hold you. Life goes on for the lonely man. And there's a million words for the one goodbye. Life goes on for the lonely man. We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons. You and I , I."

Give me them as they come.
love so right,"She came on like the night and she held on tight. And the world was right when she made love to me. We were free. She moved in like a friend, started loving me. And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms. But the morning when I woke up. I was here and she was gone. Now I'm hanging on. Maybe you can tell me. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong. Where did she go when I need her close to me. And the perfect story ended at the start. I thought you came forever. And you came to break my heart. Now I'm hanging on,. On the chance that you'll come back to me. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling. I could take it in my stride. Start living for the moment. Maybe half the things we sought were never there. Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size. It isn't really fair. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling (repeat/fade)"

no other heart,"(by Thorne, Lewis & Gibb) 1969. Clouds grew grey when you refused to stay,. The falling rain joined in with tears upon my chin.. I met you, it was a rendezvous,. No other heart, I knew could give me love so new.. Years soon came between you and I,. Time passed by, someone else caught your eye.. Heavens of clouds up above whizzing by,. I look around, you're not to be found.. I could cry with thoughts of your goodbye,. Our hearts would always fly as high as ev'ry sky.. Now I stand inside an empty land."
not in love at all,"Passed the stage of sympathy. No longer living on the pain,. Oh baby. Though I learned my lesson well. You got me with your magic spell. I'm back in love again. I let you go for what you are. Should never be restrained. I simply set you free. You found me lost without you girl. And the love you say was missing. A love that brightens up the night. You'll never be short of the reasons. You can rely on all you need. Never be lost inside each other. And you know by the second time you fall. You were not in love at all. Not in love at all. Like the precious love that grows. You made my life on earth like I was. Never born before you. I got the wings of love. To rise above the storm. But we were not in love. Sad to say we're not in love. Not in love at all. How did you get to be a mine of information. I'll be the one that puts you wise. You know it's not just that I want to dry. Any little tear you cry. I'm in love with you baby. We'll never see all of the seasons. You can be my eternity. Never be lost. To cry myself to sleep in sorrow. We're not in love at all. Like the precious love that grows. And you and I will be. A story with no happy ending. Oh baby this I vow. The greatest love you will recall. That we were not in love. Sad to say we're not in love. Not in love at all. Then why do I cry. Not in love at all. We are not in love at all. I just don't sleep at night. Not in love at all. Oh baby."

obsessions,"Obsessions. It happened in the middle of the night. When I thought I had control. Didn't want to be the one to fight. Didn't want to lose my soul. I was up for something more.

I never be the one to hurt you. Like every other girl and boy. Just another little indicretion. Another game that you want to try. You can never be unfaithful. If you gotta love somebody. Want to make your mountains high. Want to take your valley low. There's a moral to my story. Let me in a close the door. Until the morning light. What I'd give to live inside you. Make me wait, we separate. But only to return. Whisper and I'll be there. I don't want you begging me to stop. I just want to drown in your desire. Love is for those who dare. All the cream is rising to the top. And it's the love you save from dying. Chorus. Just another one of my obsessions. Something I could never find. It's the kind of love that makes your heart. Feel obsessed with mine. Any battle for the one possession. Another game that you want to try. You can never be unfaithful. If you gotta love somebody. Just another one of my obsessions. You don't want to be a special toy. I never be the one to hurt you. Like every other girl and boy. Just another little indicretion. Another game that you want to try. You can never be unfaithful.

I've got a wider range. We keep the system but the rules may change. My lips are wetter , I do it better. And if you let me I can help you grow. Baby , don't say no.

omega man,We set the same scene. Circumstances different than they. Might have been. People in two places can be. Pulled into a scheme. Never what you're fighting for. Life alone. Lose a lover's arms. Never makes it easy when you try too hard. I wish you would define what you feel. Hard on or letting go. (CHORUS1). I'm the Omega Man. Stand tall and understand. Everybody needs a plan. Mine is a better way. There'll be trouble in the world. Sex and the single girl. I'm an over-eager man. Find me a better way. Find me a better way. We share the same pain. Underneath the covers I will set you free. I will prove to you my love is. Older than the sky. Stronger than the night is long. Lord of hearts. Leader of us all. Let it be together if we rise or fall. Or is it just my imagination. Or the light of a precious stone. (You'll never be alone). (CHORUS2). I'm the Omega Man. I travel over land. Everybody needs a plan. Find me a better way. There'll be trouble in the world. Sex and the single girl. I'm an over-eager man. Find me a better way. Find me a better way. Here at the scene of the crime. Laid in your arms I will die. I know it's more than infatuation. That's keeping this man alive.

It's undercover , you'll discover. We have lived a lie. I never meant a thing to you. All I did was waste your time. If it hurts , don't let it. Someone loves you. You will find the way. She says she loves me and you say you don't. And life has no meaning if you won't. The one road to heaven is hell when she's gone. And love makes us so much stronger. We hide the sun. (break). It's wrong to go on blaming someone you don't even know. One song was all she sang to me. All her words were soft and low. If it hurts , don't let it. Someone loves you. You will find the way. She says she loves me and you say you don't. And life has no meaning if you won't. She's one in a million. A million to one. And love makes us so much stronger."

A beautiful angel with her face in the sun. She was searching for the moon in every sparkle in the spoon. You haven't changed. I'll still be the face in everybody you see. A light in the night if you need me to be. In every corner of the world. If any smile becomes a tear I will shelter you from the rain. No tomorrow. You be gone tomorrow. We can dance the night away.

Someone else that we both call love in your eyes. I believe together you'll shine."

smoke and mirrors,"When I was a boy, all the books I read. I followed like a blind man. To heed the words my father said. Those golden summers faded into night, words become a dream. The echoes of my childhood and where the path is winding. May God bless you, keep you safe from harm. I stand by you always. Time and motion. Hands touch, lips find a way to heaven on high. Watch the children play, the child becomes a man. And all the tangled webs we weave. You swear it as you live and breathe. We stay together, death until you part. Winner takes the prize. The future's at your fingertips, right before your eyes. (CHORUS). No more sorrows. (smoke and mirrors). No more nights with no end. (I really learned a lot, smoke and mirrors). I see my tomorrows. And nothing from nothing. And ashes to ashes they say. All the more that you reach out. The more that it runs away. (Smoke and Mirrors). (CHORUS). No more goodbyes. (That's all I ever got, smoke and mirrors). No lies, you find your way there. (Show me what she's got, smoke and mirrors). Heaven on high. May God bless you, keep you safe from all harm. I stand my you always. Time and motion. (Smoke and mirrors). Hands touch, lips find a way to. (That's all I ever got, smoke and mirrors). Heaven on high. No more sorrows.

Couldn't be life at all. I could be lyin' on. You are the only one. We didn't make it by chance. And there is someone. belonging to someone. And I got no one belonging to me. I'm caught in a world on. the edge of tomorrow. It's all that a fool can find. I don't belong in the arms. of a love that is lost. Nowhere to cry. There must be something we. can say my love. Something except goodbye. And there is someone belonging to someone. And I got no one belonging to me

sound of love,See the children play the ball. See them play along the hall.. It makes me cry to see them smile.. I see the moon; I see the sky.. I see reflections in my eyes.

south dakota morning,"The sun shines down on a South Dakota morning. And I can see their faces in my eyes. I wish they were behind me. My enemy can find me. If only to remind me that I'm really not alone. All the South Dakota mornings I have known. The eagle flies on a South Dakota morning. And I don't see my eagle anymore. Now stranger, I must kill you. You must survive, but will you. I may just beat you down, but will it even up the score. I think I saw the eagle just once more. The rain comes down on a South Dakota morning. And I can't see the sadness in my town. So let it be my pillow for underneath your willow. Wanna go back to you though your nothing but a town."

stay alone,"Now she didn't get off to a very good start. And she tangled with love. And he broke her heart. In a crumbling home had shown the childhood dreams were never real. I can along , she was seventeen. With the sun in her eyes and you know what I mean. She grew up too soon in the shade of my love. She taught me how to feel. Loving each other was never enough. She was watching me grow and she wrote it up. In a book of life she gave to me the day the white ship sailed. Farewell my darling , au revoir. I will pray every day for you. And she would stay alone while I'm away. She wouldn't walk all alone in the city without me. She would stay alone. She wouldn't play in the dark. With this love inside my heart. I came home on a summer night. And the wind in her hair and she looked just right. There was never another kind of women could see right through my soul. Suddenly after the southern rain. She rode out of my life on the midnight train. And I fell to the ground. And the world became the last place I should be. Wandering I will wait for you. For the sound of your voice. The dreams that you make. The book of life you gave to me still keeps my flame alive. Nobody knows which way I'm going. But I only search for you. So won't you stay alone. While I'm away. If we both walk in the same direction maybe my eyes will see you one day. Stay alone. And may your dreams come to be. All your love inside of me. Stay alone."

They will never grow old. Nor will they ever be cold. So many nights with the love in my arms. When lay down beside you. Who can tell when the moment is gone. Never be over and done. Fools never trying. Never knew which child was crying. You're the reason for the rain. It's the road that you followed. Make it so there's no tomorrow. Only people are that insane. And all my love is nothing more. Than feelings that I had before. There are strangers on the earth tonight. And I'm alone. When the hunter comes. When the hunter comes. When the hunter comes.

the singer sang his song,He'd sing his song most ev'ry night. Wishing she was there behind the light. The people danced and sang along. On the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong. And the piper played the tune. And the drummer wore his spurs. But the song that the singer sang was for her. Now the singer's song is never heard. And the visions he once saw are disappeared. Now they never dance or sing along. But on the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong. And the piper played the tune. And the drummer wore his spurs. But the song that the singer sang was for her.

the way it was,"I don't know how, but nights get lonely now. They keep appearing in my eyes. Such a warm and tender glow. For just one moment I remember all. The love we had was never all that bad. There were smiles and there were tears. On that special starry night, with your arms around me. Held on tight. Wasn't that the way it was?. Two strangers reaching for a worthless cause. Wasn't that the love we shared?. Or just the restless years when no-one cared. I don't know why, it's hard to say goodbye. Or even justify the end. You meant so very much to me. Then to let you go, start my life again. The love we had was never all that bad. There were smiles and there were tears. Till that special summer day. When I reached out for you, you just walked away. Wasn't that the way it was?. Two strangers reaching for a worthless cause. Wasn't that the love we shared?. Or just the restless years when no-one cared. When you move it like you really know how to move me. I follow you wherever you go. I just wan."

when a lonely,Bee Gees - When A Lonely Heart Breaks. . I stumble in the night. Never really knew what it would've been like. You're no longer there to break my fall. The heartache over you. I'd give it everything but I couldn't live through. I never saw the signs. You're the last to know when love is blind.. All the tears and the turbulent years. When I would not wait for no-one.

A picture at a party where you shouldn't have been. Hanging on the arm of someone else. I'm still in love with you. Won't you come back to your little boy blue. I've come to feel inside. This precious love was never mine.. Now I know but a little too late. That I could not live without you. In the dark or the broad daylight. I promise I'll be there.. (Chorus).

wish you were here,"You're living your life. In somebody else's heart. My love is as strong. As oceans are far apart. A summer song keeps playing in my brain. And I feel you and I see your face again. There's no escape, I lost everything in losing you. Ahh, I wish you were here. Dryin' these tears I cry. They were good times. And I wish you were here. Calling my name. But you're dealing with a man insane the cost. How hopelessly I'm lost. I tried to throw your love away. But I can't let go. And so I awake. In somebody else's dreams. (It's not what it seems) it's only a lie. I've yet to decide who's real. The blood red rose that will never die. It'll burn like a flame in the dark of the night. I'm not afraid. I'd give everything if you hear me there. Ahh, I wish you were here. Dryin' these tears I cry. They were good times. It's that time of year for being alone. But you're dealing with a heart of stone. Try to kiss and say goodbye. Try to throw our love away. And that storm will blow. Wish you were here (2x). But you're dealing with a heart of stone. Try to kiss and say goodbye. Try to throw our love away. And I can't let go. They were good times. And I wish you were here. Yes, I wish you here. By Eric Lopes"

Nothin' but the black of night. No-one ever takes your place. Gotta let the pantomime. Play. Not to worry, my telepathy. I bring you into me there'll be no separation. And I tell you. I will climb in side your world. And all my history. Must revolve around this girl. And I can see you with my eyes closed. I can feel you when you're near me. Just the knowing that you. Hear me, could be. You could measure my love. I can touch you with my hands tied. It don't take no extra feeling. Let your imagination, just run. You can measure my love. And they tell you. They can stop those tears you cry. And we can ride that storm together. And all the love that lasts forever. And forever, and forever. Cling to the vine and the vine never breaks. It's a message from a ship to shore. For the soul and the sacrifice. Pain. There's no fury. Like a woman scorned. We could be victims of a lethal combination. It's the hour. It's the sword that hides the stone. And one of us holds the power. There to forge our hearts together. Here forever, and forever."

you win again,"I couldn't figure why. You couldn't give me what everybody needs. I shouldn't let you kick me when I'm down. My baby. I find out everybody know that. You've been using me. I'm surprised you. Let me stay around you. One day I'm gonna lift the cover. And look inside your heart. We gotta level before we go. And tear this love apart. (CHORUS). There's no fight you can't fight. This battle of love with me. You win again. So little time. We do nothing but compete. There's no life on earth. No other could see me through. You win again. Some never try. But if anybody can, we can. And I'll be, I'll be. Following you. Oh baby I shake you from now on. I'm gonna break down your defenses. One by one. I'm gonna hit you from all sides. Lay your fortress open wide. Nobody stops this body from. Taking you. You better beware, I swear. I'm gonna be there one day when you fall. I could never let you cast aside. The greatest love of all."

you'll never see my face again,Ev'ry single word has been spoken.. It's much to late to change your ways.. Far too many vows have been broken.. You can't expect a soul to stay.. You think that you can stand and lie.. It makes me laugh . You got no friends.. It took a thousand years to find out why.. You'll never see my face again .. You know that you've been left before this night.. It's come my turn to make it over.. I wish that ev'ry thing was coloured white.. I wish that I could be a rover.. You think that you can stand and lie.. It makes me laugh.You got no friends.. It took a thousand years to find out why.. You'll never see my face again ..
young man's fancy,"(written by M.Gibb/Kipner). In the Spring , a young man's fancy likely turns. to what he's been thinkin' of. He's thinkin' of love. In the Spring , a young man's heart's begins to sing. Thinkin' of wedding rings. He's thinkin' of love. The chilly wintery winds, they blow,. In his heart ,he's warm. And true romance begins to grow. A love is born. In the Spring , a young man's fancy. likely turns to what he's been thinkin' of. He's thinkin' of love. The chilly wintery winds they blow. In his heart , he's warm.

yours,"They told me love don't last forever. Now I understand. To think that only yesterday. You held me in your hands. And I became a woman. And you became the world , to me. I was lost , no dream to high. No star to far apart. Your carpet ride holding me. You led me to believe that I was yours, yours. I swallowed every lie. And you will cry when I'm away ,on your own , like me. when I was yours. (break). I could live my life without you, that is not enough. I can't lie awake believin' you don't want my love. Alone in my desire. And still the fire burns , my friend. I was there . I loved you well. Though we are far apart , I love you still. I relive the very moment when you called me yours , yours. Don't let me die inside. Save me from the memories, the hours that I cried. Say to me that I am yours, yours , mine eternity. And you will cry when I'm away. On your own , like me ,when I was yours. Yours, yours , don't let me die inside. Save me from the memories, the hours that I cried. Say to me that I am yours , yours for eternity. And you will cry when I'm away. The hours that I cry. Say to me that I am yours, yours."
