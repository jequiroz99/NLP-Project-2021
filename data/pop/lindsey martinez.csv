need your love,When the night fall. I just need to call. You to give me love. Make me feel your girl. Only in the world. Just can't get enough. Every night I dream of you. I wish this to be true. But your love is everything I need. Maybe it's a crush inside. In my heart just burning bright. But your love gonna make me feel complete. Just take my hand. Into this way. Come through the night. The wind blows. Right to the beach. Under moonlight. I just need your love. Need your love. I just need your love. Need your love. I just need your love. Need your love. I just need your love. Need your love. Boy you are my king. And I am your queen. Castles in the sky. I can read your lips. Now I'm in your arms. Want you by my side. Every night I dream of you. I wish this to be true. But your love is everything I need. Maybe it's a crush inside. In my heart just burning bright. But your love gonna make me feel complete. Don't runaway. You have the chance. Sheets on the floor. We make this bed. Our paradise. Just give me more. I just need your love. Need your love. I just need your love. Need your love. I just need your love. Need your love. I just need your love. Need your love. I want your love
set me free,Trying not to make mistakes. I look in the mirror my face. Praying to the stars for one light. Somebody can bring me to life. A rain of roses comes. I feel it in my bones. Cause when somebody gets my way. I'm ready to open my gate. This somebody has to be you. I know this feeling may be truth. Just look right into my eyes. Together we can move skies. Finally I have you here. Only your love can set me free. I've never felt like this way before. All I ever wanted was more. I could write an adventure book. Drawing the stars to always have luck. My feet can't touch the ground. I want to fly high till sundown. 'Cause when somebody gets my way. I'm ready to open my gate. This somebody has to be you. I know this feeling may be truth. Just look right into my eyes. Together we can move skies. Finally I have you here. Only your love can set me free. Only your love can set me free. My feet can't touch the ground. I want to fly high till sundown. 'Cause when somebody gets my way. I'm ready to open my gate. This somebody has to be you. I know this feeling may be truth. Just look right into my eyes. Together we can move skies. Finally I have you here. Only your love can set me free. Only your love can set me free
