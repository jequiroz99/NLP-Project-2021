If you ain't here, I just can't breathe. There's no air, no air. No air air, No air air. No air air, No air air. [Chris]. I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew,. Right off the ground to flow to you.

a broken wing,"She loved him like he was. The last man on Earth. Gave him everything she ever had. He'd break her spirit down. Then come lovin' up to her. Give a little, then take it back. She'd tell him about her dreams. He'd just shoot 'em down. Lord he loved to make her cry. ""You're crazy for believin'. You'll ever leave the ground"". He said, ""Only angels know how to fly"". And with a broken wing. She still sings. She keeps an eye on the sky. With a broken wing. She carries her dreams. Man you ought to see her fly. One Sunday morning. She didn't go to church. He wondered why she didn't leave. He went up to the bedroom. Found a note by the window. With the curtains blowin' in the breeze. And with a broken wing. She still sings. She keeps an eye on the sky.

christmas time to me,"I hear the church bells ringing. A children's choir singing. Christmas songs are playing on repeat!. I could go wherever, but if we're not together. It just won't feel like christmas time to me!. I could walk on broadway. Buy a ticket to a ballet. Seen lighting up the rockefeller tree, oh, oh!. But every new york minute. Is lost without you, in it. It just won't feel like christmas time to me, oh yeah!. I could fly to london. And santa clause is coming. I wish to see the lights on oxford street, oh, oh!. And lose some time to big ben. But if your heart's not here then. It just won't feel like christmas time to me!. Been a good girl, yes I swear. Maybe by this time next year. Oh, oh you will be here!. Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da x4. Oh yeah!. Heavens, love the midnight. The whispers and the star light. And taste the snow fall on the chandeliers. You climb the eiffel tower. But if I'm there without ya. It just won't feel like christmas time to me!. I hear the church bells ringing. Children's choir singing. Christmas songs are playing on repeat!. I could go wherever. But if we're not together. It just won't feel like christmas time to me!"
colours,"The sky was perfect blue. Me and you with a new beginning. One and one made two. All we knew was that we had each other. Like gentle lavender on my face. What a gorgeous feeling. You'd take me up so high. Felt so free with no walls or ceilings. For every way my emotions have gone. There's a shade that goes along. Your painting of me like a canvas is. Your portrait my song. With so many changes. Don't know how I became this. There's a different shade for all that we've been through. These are my colors for you. I'm tryin to think back to what I was before you. But for every turn a different hue. These are my colours for you. So the seasons go. Rightly so we prepare for changes. A certain change in tint. There were hints while the bright was faded. Appear a perfect sky shadowed by the remainings of pain. Once so beautiful and perfect blue. Now it's all in gray. For every way my emotions have gone. There's a shade that goes along. Your painting of me like a canvas is. Your portrait my song. With so many changes. Don't know how I became this. There's a different shade for all that we've been through. These are my colors for you. I'm tryin to think back to what I was before you. But for every turn a different hue. These are my colours for you. A mixture of these colours. Product of your encounter. Everything you poured in me is now manifesting. The lavenders, the blues. The grays and yellows too. Have all gone into what you see standing here before you. With so many changes. Don't know how I became this. There's a different shade for all that we've been through. These are my colors for you. I'm tryin to think back to what I was before you. But for every turn a different hue. These are my colours for you. With so many changes. Don't know how I became this. There's a different shade for all that we've been through. These are my colors for you. I'm tryin to think back to what I was before you. But for every turn a different hue. These are my colours for you. These are my colours for you .. . _ Raphael S.

definition,"I've seen it in movies and TV shows. Wrapped up with roses and pretty bows. But that's just not the way my story goes. I get the love 'em and leave 'em kinds. The ones that can never make up their minds. But I know that next time. I'm gonna get my ever after. There's gonna be ups and downs. Twists and turns. Maybe a crash and burn. When I find the one I'm gonna let him know what I've learned. This is my definition of love. It's not perfect, but it's never giving up. And sometimes we're gonna fight 'cause we both like to be right. But love is unconditional and that's my definition of love. Tired of making the same mistakes. Find the ones that don't wanna stay. We hit a bump in the road they just split like an earthquake. There's gonna be highs and lows. Good and bad, and there's nothing wrong with that. But you gotta stick it out and dig your heels in to make it last. This is my definition of love. It's not perfect, but it's never giving up. And sometimes we are gonna fight 'cause we both like to be right. But I am finally learning to say that I'm sorry and swallow my pride. This is my definition of love. Oh, we gotta stick together no matter what. And we're gonna make mistakes and hearts are gonna break. But love is unconditional and that's my definition of love. Never gonna leave you, love. It's never gonna. When you're falling down when you make a big mistake. When you wake up in the morning. With nothing, there's love. The kinds that is gonna kiss you, love. The kinds gonna miss you. That's my definition of this thing called love. Yeah. It's not perfect, but it's never giving up. And sometimes we are gonna fight 'cause we both like to be right. But I am finally learning to say that I'm sorry and swallow my pride. This is my definition of love. Oh, we gotta stick together no matter what and we're gonna make mistakes.

Finally I'm getting stronger. And if I have to walk away,. I will, and I won't turn around. If you saw my tears,. would you look away?. Hold me close?. Would you beg to stay?. If I fall apart,. and let you see inside?. Would you tell me it`s alright?. I don't wanna talk about it. I don't say another word. I've already said too much. Cause you just never seem to get it. Do you even care how much it hurts?. To hate the one you love. And I'm just waiting for the day. when I, I don't have to. dig up through the landmines. How can I be so conflicted?.

I couldn't help but to notice your attitude. You don't have to be like that. It seems today you're in a mood. Don't let it get in your way. Look at you your hair's all out of place. You don't have to look like that. I'm gonna put some make-up on my face. It's time to start a new day. I ask myself in a joking way. If the man I love ever comes my way. What faces I'll make what will I say. Before I start my day. Image of what I feel inside. My imperfections I try to hide. No one but me myself and I. It's where I confide me and the mirror. No one's opinion matters now. It's my time no one's allowed. No one but me myself and I. When no one is around me and the mirror. I got a closet full of clothes. But I got nothing to wear. I wanna shop can't wait 'til I get paid. My cell phone bill will have to wait. My toes are good should I get my nails done today. Cause they look better that way. And oh yeah I forgot to pray. These are the things I'd say. Have I done good in the life you gave. I know I've made a few mistakes. Will you let me in when I get to the gates. When we're face to face. Image of what I feel inside. My imperfections I try to hide. No one but me myself and I. It's where I confide me and the mirror. No one's opinion matters now. It's my time no one's allowed. No one but me myself and I. When no one is around me and the mirror. It took a simple thing to realize. I need to be alone sometimes. Staring back into my own eyes. Helped me know me for myself. All the special things I can't find. From what other people see. Were right there in the mirror. Staring back at me. I got a closet full of clothes. But I got nothing to wear. I got a closet full of clothes. I got a closet full of clothes. But I got nothing to wear. I got a closet full of clothes. Image of what I feel inside. My imperfections I try to hide. No one but me myself and I. It's where I confide me and the mirror. No one's opinion matters now. It's my time no one's allowed. No one but me myself and I. When no one is around me and the mirror

Changes come but where they go. You'll never know. Just another day like any other,. Nothing in the sky said ""run for cover"". Just another reason,. Never thought it would end this way.. There was no parade. No lights flashing. No song to sing along the way. There was no parade. No waves crashing. There was no one else around the days. There was no parade. And after all the noise. I never heard a last goodbye. It was silent as a butterfly. There was no parade. No lights flashing. No song to sing alone the way. There was no parade. No waves crashing. There was no one else around the days. There was no parade.... No parade.... No parade.... No parade..."

vertigo,"House of mirrors, I see your face. Come nearer, it's so hot in this place. I can't hear you, I can't breathe when you touch me. I drown and I drown and I drown.

I'm so high from this love, I don't wanna look down. The room starts to sway every time you're around. Like the teacups at Disney, you're making me dizzy. You give me vertigo. When I jump on the table, I spin like a dreidel. Hold on to me baby, I feel so unstable. If I'd try to drive, I'd get a DUI. You give me vertigo. It's the next verse in our unwritten story. In the first verse, I knew you did something for me. I'm tangled, got your arms wrapped around me. I fall and I fall and I fall. (Refrão). I'm so high from this love, I don't wanna look down. The room starts to sway every time you're around. Like the teacups at Disney, you're making me dizzy. You give me vertigo. When I jump on the table, I spin like a dreidle.

It's like I'm under the influence. Under the influence. Under the influence of your love. (Refrão). I'm so high from this love, I don't wanna look down. The room starts to sway every time you're around. Like the teacups at Disney, you're making me dizzy. You give me vertigo. When I jump on the table, I spin like a dreidle.

virginia is for lovers,"You became someone so close. That person I could trust. Why did it end up this way?. What happened to the both of us?. I, I'm tearing up inside. I'm on a rollercoaster ride. Thinking of those memories. How your touch was so soft. Your eyes, they were so green. I would have never known how much. You'd come to mean everything to me. (Chorus). Virginia is for lovers. And I wonder where do all the others go. And your heart belongs to another. And I'm leaving. Virginia is for lovers anyway. No matter how long we`re apart. I find it hard to let go. I'm sitting here so restless. Time is moving so slow. I hate that I'm looking back. Reminiscing on photographs. You were like my other half. We were perfect on our own. Then everyone came back. Got harder to get you alone. See the hurting on my face. You were looking the other way because.... (Chorus). Virginia is for lovers. And I wonder where do all the others go. And your heart is with another. And I'm leaving. Virginia is for lovers anyway. I never got to tell you. You walked away. You left me there. And you won't change no matter what I do. But I still care. And I'm still here, yeah yeah. (Chorus). Virginia is for lovers. And I wonder where do all the others go. And your heart is with another. And I'm leaving.

walk the walk,"I called an empty heart. It's not a way to start. I'm not detating who you are to be. But I try, to be open. This flaw's affecting my brain. All of my feelings to blame. The things I'm asking they don't seem to work. All them miles, of the ocean. But not have you, is suffering. But then loving you is hard. I'd say the words. But I don't understand the meaning. I know I'll never start believing in the truth. I try to quit, but I can't make you go away. Cause it's still what I got to do. And so I walk the walk. That leads me to you. And now I walk the walk. For you. Won't you save this dance. Is this our one last chance. Those things I wanted so much in the past. Have left, me uncertain. Not wanting you is leveling. But not needing you is sad. I'd say the words. But I don't understand the meaning. I know I'll never start believing in the truth. I try to quit, but I can't make you go away. Cause it's still what I got to do. And so I walk the walk. That leads me to you. And now I walk the walk. For you. And I know that. I won't be wasting my way. I know that I have made my mistakes. And I'm hoping. You'll be on the other side. You'll wait for me this time. I'd say the words. But I don't understand the meaning. I know I'll never start believing in the truth. I try to quit, but I can't make you go away. Cause it's still what I got to do. And so I walk the walk. That leads me to you. And now I walk the walk. For you. And now I walk the walk. For you.
