idaho (part. nerina pallot),"In the back of a car on a road in the dark. In the stillicide, silently falling snow,. I've packed everything that I own in a bag,. And I'm driving, I'm driving to Idaho. A poem for leaving, a reason to go,. So I'm driving, I'm driving to Idaho. 'Cause I can't be anyone but me, anyone but me. And I can't keep dreaming that I'm free, dreaming that I'm free,. I don't want to fall asleep and watch my life from fifty feet,. My hands are on the wheel so I'm driving to Idaho,. 'Cause I hear it's mighty pretty.... And oh, I've been dumb, I've been perfectly beautiful,. Lain on my back buying lovers with stealth,. But I'm sick of you all, and I'm sick of opinions. And I'm sick of this war I wage on myself. And I don't know why I'm so gripped to go there. A universe riddle that only I know?. Mr. Robert he says, ""It's all in the head!"". Tell me, Phaedrus, what's good, is it Idaho?. 'Cause I can't be anyone but me, anyone but me,. And I can't keep dreaming that I'm free, dreaming that I'm free,. I don't want to fall asleep and watch my life from fifty feet,.

love never fails,(Chorus). There will be those times we fight back tears. And there will be those times when we get scared. As long as we're together we'll get there. Cause love never fails... Love never fails. I have all that I need. So much so I feel weak. Cause the love that we have is never ending. All the moments we make. Are too precious to waste. In a world that is forever changing. I wouldn't change you for anything. I will be forever loving you. (Chorus). Asleep or awake. No there's never a day. That goes by when I don't think about you. Only you touched my life. For the very first time. I'd be lost surely without you. (Chorus). There's no greater gift. Than love that you breathe. Forever hold me. Many rivers to cross. But our love will guide us. It's all we need. (Chorus). There will be those times that test our faith. On some of the roads that we have to take. But I know that we'll always find our way. Cause love never fails Love never fails
