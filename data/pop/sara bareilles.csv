love song,"Head under water. And they tell me to breathe easy for a while. The breathing gets harder, even I know that. You made room for me, but it's too soon to see. If I'm happy in your hands. I'm unusually hard to hold on to. Blank stares at blank pages. No easy way to say this. You mean well, but you make this hard on me. I'm not gonna write you a love song. 'Cause you asked for it. 'Cause you need one, you see. I'm not gonna write you a love song. 'Cause you tell me it's. Make or breaking in this. If you're on your way. I'm not gonna write you to stay. If all you have is leaving I'm gonna need a better. Reason to write you a love song today. I learned the hard way. That they all say things you want to hear. And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you. And your twisted words, your help just hurts. You are not what I thought you were. Hello to high and dry. Convinced me to please you. Made me think that I need this too. I'm trying to let you hear me as I am. I'm not gonna write you a love song. 'Cause you asked for it. 'Cause you need one, you see. I'm not gonna write you a love song. 'Cause you tell me it's. Make or breaking in this. If you're on your way. I'm not gonna write you to stay. If all you have is leaving I'm gonna need a better. Reason to write you a love song today. Promise me that you'll leave the light on. To help me see with daylight, my guide, gone. 'Cause I believe there's a way you can love me because. I say. I won't write you a love song. 'Cause you asked for it. 'Cause you need one, you see. I'm not gonna write you a love song. 'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking in this. Is that why you wanted a love song?. 'Cause you asked for it. 'Cause you need one, you see. I'm not gonna write you a love song. 'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking in this. If you're on your way. I'm not gonna write you to stay. If your heart is nowhere in it. I don't want it for a minute. Babe, I'll walk the seven seas when I believe that. There's a reason to. Write you a love song today"
gravity,"Something always brings me back to you.. It never takes too long.. No matter what I say or do. I'll still feel you here. 'til the moment I'm gone.. You hold me without touch.. You keep me without chains.. I never wanted anything. so much than to drown in your love. and not feel your rain.. Chorus. Set me free, leave me be.. I don't want to fall another moment. into your gravity.. Here I am and I stand so tall,. just the way I'm supposed to be.. But you're on to me and all over me.. You loved me 'cause I'm fragile.. When I thought that I was strong.. But you touch me for a little while. and all my fragile strength is gone.. Chorus. I live here on my knees. as I try to make you see that. you're everything I think. I need here on the ground.. But you're neither friend nor foe. though I can't seem to let you go.. The one thing that I still know. is that you're keeping me down.. Keeping me down.. You're on to me,. you're on to me,. all over.. Something always brings me back to you.. It never takes too long."
she used to be mine,"It's not simple to say. Most days I don't recognize me. These shoes and this apron. That place and it's patrons. Have taken more than I gave them. It's not easy to know. I'm not anything that I used to be, although it's true. I was never attention sweet center. I still remember that girl. She's imperfect but she tries. She is good but she lies. She is hard on herself. She is broken and won't ask for help. She is messy but she's kind. She is lonely. Most of the time. She is all of this mixed up. And baked in a beautiful pie. She is gone but she used to be mine. And it's not what I asked for. Sometimes life just slips in through back door. And carves out the person. And makes you believe it's so true. And now I've got you. And you're not what I asked for. If I'm honest I know I would give it all back. For a chance to start over. And rewrite an ending or two. For the girl that I knew. Who be reckless just enough. Who get hurt. But who learns how to toughen up. When she's bruised. And gets used by a man who can't love. And then she'll get stuck. And be scared. Of the life that's inside her. Growing stronger each day. Til it finally reminds her. To fight just a little. To bring back the fire in her eyes. That's been gone but it used to be mine. Used to be mine. She is messy but she's kind. She is lonely most of the time. She is all of this mixed up. And baked in a beautiful pie. She is gone. But she used to be mine"
brave,"You can be amazing. You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug. You can be the outcast or be the backlash. Of somebody's lack of love. Or you can start speaking up. Nothing's gonna hurt you. The way that words do. When they settle 'neath your skin. Kept on the inside. No sunlight, sometimes a shadow wins. But I wonder what would happen if you. Say, what you want to say. And let the words fall out. Honestly. I want to see you be brave. With what you want to say. And let the words fall out. Honestly. I want to see you be brave.

Maybe there's a way out. Of the cage where you live. Maybe one of these days. You can let the light in. Show me. How big your brave is. Say, what you want to say. And let the words fall out. Honestly. I want to see you be brave. With what you want to say. And let the words fall out. Honestly. I want to see you be brave. And since your history of silence. Won't do you any good. Did you think it would?. Let your words be anything but empty. Why don't you tell them the truth?. Say, what you want to say. And let the words fall out. Honestly. I want to see you be brave.

armor,"Let it begin, let Adam in. Step one: original sin. Underneath the leaves, Adam found Eve. Both of them found something sweet under the apple tree. Then it was over, roads divide. Step two: learning how to lie. Let me ask a question to present day. How the hell did Eve end up with all the damn blame?. All the damn blame. To all the dirty looks, the kitty cat calls.

i choose you,"Let the bough break, let it come down crashing. Let the sun fade out to a dark sky. I can't say I'd even notice it was absent. Cause I could live by the light in your eyes. I'll unfold before you. Would have strung together. The very first words. Of a lifelong love letter. Tell the world that we finally got it all right. I choose you. I will become yours and you will become mine. I choose you. I choose you. (Yeah). There was a time when I would have believed them. If they told me that you could not come true. Just love's illusion. But then you found me and everything changed. And I believe in something again. My whole heart. Will be yours forever. This is a beautiful start. To a lifelong love letter. Tell the world that we finally got it all right. I choose you. I will become yours and you will become mine. I choose you. I choose you. We are not perfect. We'll learn from our mistakes. And as long as it takes. I will prove my love to you. I am not scared of the elements. I am underprepared, but I am willing. And even better. I get to be the other half of you. Tell the world that we finally got it all right. I choose you. I will become yours and you will become mine. I choose you. I choose you"

And I won't do what you keep doing. Sit in judgment of a house I ruined. I don't claim to be proud. But my head wont be hung in shame. I didn't plan it. But the light turned red, and I ran it. And I'm still standing. It's not what I wanted, but now that it's right here. I understand it. A story written by my own hand. It's life biting right at your heels. I didn't plan it. But it's finally something to feel. Oh. Look around you. Ain't no saints here baby. We're all just looking for a little less crazy. And sometimes it's a hard left turn. Down a road you'd never thought you'd see. Don't you think dealing blame is a hazard. I'm not the only one whose dark side has her. I didn't plan it. Taking back what's been taken for granted. 'Cause I can't stand it. I'm sick of the way I've been waiting to break free. I needed saving. And a good mistake needed making. Maybe you need the same thing. I didn't plan it. Taking back what's been taken for granted. I'm sick of the way I've been waiting to break free. I didn't plan it. But it's finally something to feel. Something to feel"

gonna get over you,"Goodbye. Should be sayin' that to you by now, shouldn't I?. Layin' down the law that I live by. Well maybe next time. I've got a thick tongue. Brimming with the words that go unsung. Simmer then the burn for a someone. A wrong one. And I tell myself to let the story end. My heart will rest in someone else's hand. My 'why not me?' philosophy began. And I say. Ooh, how'm I gonna get over you?. I'll be alright, just not tonight. Someday, oh I wish you'd want me to stay. I'll be alright. Just not tonight. Someday. Maybe is a vicious little word that can slay me. Keep me when I'm hurting and make me. Hang from your hands. Well, no more,. I won't beg to buy a shot at your back door. If I make it at the thought of you, what for?. It's not me anymore. And I'm not the girl that I intend to be. I dare you darling, just you wait and see. But this time not for you but just for me. And I say. Ooh, how'm I gonna get over you?. I'll be alright, just not tonight. Someday, oh I wish you'd want me to stay. I'll be alright, just not tonight. But someday. Say it's coming soon. Someday without you. All I can do is get me past the ghost of you. Wave goodbye of me. I won't say I'm sorry. I'll be alright once I find the other side. Of someday. Ooh, how'm I gonna get over you?. I'll be alright. Just not tonight. Someday, oh I wish you'd want me to stay. I'll be alright. Just not tonight. Someday"
winter song (feat. ingrid michaelson),Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum. Bum bum bum bum bum bum. Bum bum bum bum bum bum. This is my winter song to you. The storm is coming soon. It rolls in from the sea. My voice; a beacon in the night. My words will be your light. To carry you to me. Is love alive?. Is love alive?. Is love. They say that things just cannot grow. Beneath the winter snow. Or so I have been told. They say were buried far. Just like a distant star. I simply cannot hold. Is love alive?. Is love alive?. Is love. [Chorus 3]. This is my winter song. December never felt so wrong. Because you're not where you belong. Inside my arms. Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum. Bum bum bum bum bum bum. Bum bum bum bum bum bum. I still believe in summer days. The seasons always change. And life will find a way. I'll be your harvester of light. And send it out tonight. So we can start again. Is love alive?. Is love alive?. Is love. This is my winter song. December never felt so wrong. Because you're not where you belong. Inside my arms. This is my winter song to you. The storm is coming soon. It rolls in from the sea. My love a beacon in the night. My words will be your light. To carry you to me. Is love alive?. Is love alive?. Is love. Is love alive?. Is love alive?. Is love. Is love alive?. Is love alive?. Is love
many the miles,There's too many things that i haven't done yet. Too many sunsets. I haven't seen. You can't waste the day wishing it'd slow down. You would've thought by now. I'd have learned something. I made up my mind when i was a young girl. I've been given this one world. I won't worry it away. But now and again i lose sight of the good life. I get stuck in a low light. But then Love comes in. How far do i have to go to get to you. Many the miles. Many the miles. How far do i have to go to get to you. Many the miles.

hold my heart,"I never meant to be the one to let you down. If anything, I thought I saw myself going first. I didn't know how to stick around. How to see anybody but me be getting hurt. I keep remembering the summer night. And the conversation breaking up the mood. I didn't want to tell you you were right. Like the season changing, oh, I felt it too. Does anybody know how to hold my heart. How to hold my heart?. 'Cause I don't want to let go, let go, let go too soon. I want to tell you so before the sun goes dark. How to hold my heart. 'Cause I don't want to let go, let go, let go of you. I'm not the kind to try to tell you lies. But the truth is you've been hiding from it too. I see the end sneaking in behind your eyes. Saying things no words could ever do. Does anybody know how to hold my heart. How to hold my heart?. 'Cause I don't want to let go, let go, let go too soon. I want to tell you so before the sun goes dark. How to hold my heart. 'Cause I don't want to let go, let go, let go of you. Is anybody listening?. 'Cause I'm crying. Is anybody listening?. Does anybody know how to hold my heart. How to hold my heart?. 'Cause I don't want to let go, let go, let go too soon. I want to tell you so before the sun goes dark. How to hold my heart.

breathe again,"Car is parked, bags are packed. But what kind of heart doesn't look back. At the comfortable glow from the porch. The one I will still call yours?. All those words came undone and now I'm not the only one. Facing the ghosts that decide if the fire inside still burns. All I have, all I need. He's the air I would kill to breathe. Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something. Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again. I'll breathe again. Open up next to you and my secrets become your truth. And the distance between that was sheltering me comes in full view. Hang my head, break my heart built from all I have torn apart. And my burden to bear is a love I can't carry anymore. All I have, all I need. He's the air I would kill to breathe. Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something. Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again. It hurts to be here. I only wanted love from you. It hurts to be here. What am I gonna do?. All I have, all I need. He's the air I would kill to breathe. Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching. All I have, all I need. He's the air I would kill to breathe. Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something. Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again. I'll breathe again"
king of anything,"Keep drinking coffee, stare me down across the table. While I look outside. So many things I'd say if only I were able. But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by. You've got opinions, man. We're all entitled to 'em. But I never asked. So let me thank you for your time. And try not to waste any more of mine. Get out of here fast. I hate to break it to you babe. But I'm not drowning. There's no one here to save. Who cares if you disagree? You are not me. Who made you king of anything?. So, you dare tell me who to be. Who died and made you king of anything?. You sound so innocent. All full of good intent. Swear you know best. But you expect me to. Jump up onboard with you. Ride off into your delusional sunset. I'm not the one who's lost. With no direction, oh. But you'll never see. You're so busy making masks. With my name on it in all caps. You've got the talking down. Just not the listening. Who cares if you disagree? You are not me. Who made you king of anything?. So you dare tell me who to be. Who died and made you king of anything?. All my life I've tried. To make everybody happy while I just hurt and hide. Waiting for someone to tell me it's my turn. To decide. Who cares if you disagree? You are not me. Who made you king of anything?. So you dare tell me who to be. Who died and made you king of anything?. Who cares if you disagree? You are not me. Who made you king of anything?. So you dare tell me who to be. Who died and made you king of anything?.

beautiful girl,"You wanna walk into the room like that other girl does. The one that's always making everybody fall in love. You see, girl you're a lot like me. She rearranges all the light in the room. So you're always in the shadows. Well that's what it feels like to you. Baby, I've been there too. And I know how much it can sometimes hurt. You feel like the whole world has made you the ugly girl. Take it from me that you have to see it first. So before you trade in your summer skin for those high heeled shoes. To make him wanna be with you. Let me remind you one more time. That just maybe you're beautiful but you just can't see. So why don't you trust me. They'll see it too you beautiful girl, you. You wanna lay the blame on somebody else. All these tiny little minds that leave you up on a shelf. But okay, I've seen it done that way. Just in case nobody ever comes through. Riding in to come to your rescue. You still have a chance. You don't have to be asked to dance. I know how much you've been dying to say. ""look how much everybody loves me"". Guess who gets left when everyone else fades away. So before you trade in your summer skin for those high heeled shoes. To make him wanna be with you. Let me remind you one more time. That just maybe you're beautiful but you just can't see. So why don't you trust me. They'll see it too you beautiful girl, you"
when he sees me,"I stick with real things. Usually facts and figures. When information's in its place. I minimize the guessing game. Guess what?. I don't like guessing games. Or when I feel things. Before I know the feelings. How am I supposed to operate. If I'm just tossed around by fate?. Like on an unexpected date?. The stranger who might talk too fast. Or ask me questions about myself. Before I've decided that. He can ask me questions about myself. He might sit too close. Or call the waiter by his first name. Or eat Oreos. But eat the cookie before the cream?. But what scares me the most. what scares me the most. Is what if when he sees me, what if he doesn't like it?. What if he runs the other way and I can't hide from it?. What happens then?. If when he knows me, he's only disappointed?. What if I give myself away, to only get it given back?. I couldn't live with that. So, I'm just fine, inside my shell-shaped mind. This way I get the best view. So, when he sees me, I want him to. I'm not defensive. I'm simply being cautious. I can't risk reckless dating. Due to my miscalculating. While a certain suitor stands in line. I've seen in movies. Most made for television. You cannot be too careful. When it comes to sharing your life. I could end up a miserable wife. He could be criminal, some sort of psychopath. who escaped from an institution. somewhere where they don't have girls. He could have masterminded some way to find me. He could be colorblind. How untrustworthy is that. He could be less than kind. Or even worse he could be very nice, have lovely eyes. And make me laugh, come out of hiding. What do I do with that?. Oh, God. What if when he sees me. I like him and he knows it?. What if he opens up a door. And I can't close it?. What happens then?. If when he holds me. My heart is set in motion. I'm not prepared for that. I'm scared of breaking open. But still I can't help from hoping. To find someone to talk to. Who likes the way I am. Someone who when he sees me. Wants to again"
everything changes,"Today's a day like any other. But I am changed. I am a mother. Oh in an instant. And who I was has disappeared. It doesn't matter, now you're here. So innocent. I was lost for you to find. And now I'm yours and you are mine. Two tiny hands, a pair of eyes. An unsung melody is mine for safekeeping. And I will guard it with my life. I'd hang the moon for it to shine on her sleeping. Starting here and starting now. I can feel the heart of how. Everything changes. My heart's at the wheel now. And all my mistakes. They make sense when I turn them around. Everything changes. What I thought was so permanent fades. And I swear I'll remember to say we were both born today. Oh, and it's true. What did I do to deserve you. I didn't know, but now I see. Sometimes what is, is meant to be. You saved me. My blurry lines, my messy life. Come into focus in a tied, maybe. I can heal and I can breathe. 'Cause I can feel myself believe. That everything changes. My heart's at the wheel now. And all my mistakes. They make sense when I turn them around. Everything changes. What I thought was so permanent fades. And I swear I'll remember to say we were both born today. Oh, and it's true. What did I do to deserve you. Thank God for you"
chasing the sun,"Its a really old city. Stuck between the dead and the living. So I thought to myself. Sitting on a graveyard shelf. As the echo of heartbeats. From the ground below my feet. Filled a cemetery in the center of Queens. I started running the maze of. The names and the dates, some older than others. The skyscrapers, little tombstone brothers. With Manhattan behind her. Three million stunning reminders. Built a cemetery in the center of Queens. You said, remember that life is. Not meant to be wasted. We can always be chasing the sun!. So fill up your lungs and just run. But always be chasing the sun!. So how do you do it. With just words and just music, capture the feeling. That my earth is somebodys ceiling. Can I deliver in sound. The weight of the ground. Of a cemetery in the center of Queens. Theres a history through her. Sent to us as a gift from the future. To show us the proof. More than that, its to dare us to move. To open our eyes and to learn from the sky. From a cemetery in the center of Queens. You said, remember that life is. Not meant to be wasted. We can always be chasing the sun!. So fill up your lungs and just run. But always be chasing the sun!. All we can do is try. And live like were still alive. Its a really old city. Stuck between the dead and the living. So I thought to myself. Sitting on a graveyard shelf. And the gift of my heartbeat sounds like a symphony. Played by a cemetery in the center of Queens. You said, remember that life is. Not meant to be wasted. We can always be chasing the sun!. So fill up your lungs and just run. But always be chasing the sun!. All we can do is try. And live like were still alive. All we can do is try. And live like were still alive"
yellow,"Look at the stars. Look how they shine for you. And everything you do. They were all yellow. I came along. I wrote a song for you. And everything you do. It was all yellow.

You know I love you so. I swam across. I jumped across for you. Oh what a thing to do. 'Cause you were all yellow. I drew a line. I drew a line for you. Oh what a thing to do. And it was all yellow. Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones. Turn into something beautiful. D'you know? For you I bleed myself dry. For you I bleed myself dry. I bleed myself dry. It's true. Look how they shine for you. Look how they shine for you. Look how they shine. Look how they shine for you. Look how they shine for you. Look how they shine. Look at the stars"
one sweet love,"Just about the time the shadows call. I undress my mind and dare you to follow. Paint a portrait of mystery. Only close my eyes and you are here with me. A nameless face to think I see. To sit and watch the waves with me till they're gone. A heart I'd swear I'd recognize is. Made out of my own devices....could I be wrong?. Chorus. Time that I've taken. Pray is not wasted. Have I already tasted my piece of. One sweet love?. Ready and waiting. For a heart worth the breaking. But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of. One sweet love.. Sleepless nights you creep inside of me. Paint your shadows on the breath that we share. You took more than just my sanity. You've taken my reason not to care. No ordinary wings I'll need. The sky itself will carry me back to you. The things I dream that I can do. I'll open up the moon for you. Just come down soon. Chorus. Time that I've taken. Pray is not wasted. Have I already tasted my piece of. One sweet love?. Ready and waiting. For a heart worth the breaking. But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of. One sweet love.. Savor the sorrow to soften the pain. Sip on the southern rain, as I do. I don't look don't touch don't do anything. But hope that there is a you.. The earth that is the space between. I'd banish it from under me... to get to you.. An unexpected love provides. My solitary's suicide... oh I wish I knew. Chorus. Time that I've taken. Pray is not wasted. Have I already tasted my piece of. One sweet love?. Ready and waiting. For a heart worth the breaking. But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of. One sweet love."
what's inside,"Sugar. Sugar (butter). Sugar (butter, flour). Sugar (butter, flour). Sugar (butter, flour). Sugar. My hands pluck the things I know that I'll need.

you matter to me (feat. jason mraz),"I could find the whole meaning of life in those sad eyes. They've seen things that you never quite say, but I hear. Come out of hiding, I'm right here beside you. And I'll stay there as long as you let me. Because you matter to me. Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody. You matter to me. I promise you do, you, you matter too. I promise you do, you see?. You matter to me. It's addictive the minute you let yourself think. The things that I say just might matter to someone. All of this time I've been keeping my mind on the running away. And for the first time I think I'd consider the stay. Because you matter to me. Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody. You matter to me. I promise you do, you, you matter too. I promise you do, you see?. You matter to me. And you matter to me. Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody. You matter to me.

soft place to land,"Sugar. Sugar, butter, flour. Sometimes I still see her. My mother the dreamer. She'd say, ""Nothing's impossible child"". A dream needs believing. To taste like the real thing. Like some stranger you recognize. So pure, so pure, so electric. So sure, so sure, so connected. To those little believers inside. May we all be so lucky. But dreams are elusive. The kind we've gotten used to. Is nothing I can feel. Nothing I can hold. Nothing I can have. Nothing that I know. Dreams come and they go. But hold them and keep them. And know that you need them. When your breaking point's all that you have. A dream is a soft place to land. May we all be so lucky. Sugar, butter, flour"
never ever getting rid of me,"I will never let you let me leave. I promise I'm not lying. Go ahead ask anybody who has seen me trying. I'm not going, if it seems like I did. I'm probably waiting outside. Such a stubborn man you'll likely never meet another. When we have our family dinner you can ask my mother. She's the best, learn all about her on our family history test. I'm gonna do this right. Show you I'm not moving. Wherever you go, I won't be far to follow. Oh, I'm gonna love you so. You'll learn what I already know. I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me. You can try, oh, but I. I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me. I grew up an only child in a suburb of the city. Spent my days alone my only friend was a stray kitty called Sardine. I though it was hilarious to call a cat a kind of fish. She played hard to get hissing while she scratched me. What she was trying to say was ""Ogie come and catch me"". I learned quickly, perserverance stood between a cat and her new best friend, me. Oh, I'm gonna do this right. Show you I'm not moving. Wherever you go, I won't be far to follow. Oh, I'm gonna love you so. You'll learn what I already know. I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me. You can try, oh, but I. I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me. You can try, oh, but I.

With my feet on the sand. And a body that won't move. The tide's coming in. And I'm bound for a swim. In a pair of cement shoes. He takes what he can, what he wants. Doesn't matter if it's ever been given. I took the bait and a chance on a man. Sold by the boy that he lived in. And I was wrong to believe that strength makes you strong. And I had hope in a change I would see in us both. And now I'm heavy. And he lifts me, but never once carried. Door number two I've already walked through. Ask me the question. Who coulda guessed I'd be here at this crossroad?. Plain to be seen that it's all up to me. I'm no longer alone, though. Nothing's changed. And I see it more every day. Nothing moves. It's a game to be played and to lose. And now I'm heavy, unsteady. But maybe I'm getting ready. And this might catch fire and char this ground. I might lift this up. To only be the one who's gonna get let down. Will I be enough to get this on its way. to find some higher ground?. Before the waters rush. I've got to make a change or else I know I'll drown.

But I don't mind, no I don't mind it. I would come back 1000 times. Make me wait forever. Push me away and tell me never. I don't mind, no I don't mind it. I would come back 1000 times.

Eyes wide shut unopened. You and me. Always between the lines. Between the lines. I thought I was ready to bleed. That we’d move from the shadows on the wall. And stand in the center of it all.. Too late two choices to stay or to leave. Mine was so easy to uncover. He’d already left with the other.. So I’ve learned to listen through silence.. Leave unsaid unspoken. Eyes wide shut unopened. You and me. Always between the lines. Between the lines. I tell myself all the words he surely meant to say. I’ll talk until the conversation doesn’t stay on. Wait for me I’m almost ready.

But I still swear that you were God sent. And you stood before me knowing that the wings I have you gave. And that’s just the way it goes now. And I barely have the breath to breathe much less to fly away. And that’s just the way it goes now. And a silence entered the room for a one last. ""I’m gonna love you."". So God bless and thank you.

Carolina, don't you know I'm right behind ya?. No love of mine is gonna wind up leaving me for Carolina. Don't feel the summer like I used to. Boy, you brought the thunder, tucked me under, it's all your fault. Want me to let you leave, do you?. Well I never minded aftermath and this is what happens to a liar. Miles of the highway nothing will stop me 'til I'm done coming for ya. Carolina, won't go home until I find ya. You fill my bones, my mind up, so I'm coming to. Carolina, don't you know I'm right behind ya?. No love of mine is gonna wind up leaving me for Carolina. I don't mind the rain, it suits me. Makes a pained pursuit seem less unruly. It's been a good night. And one hell of a drive. Coming for you Carolina, won't go home until I find ya. You fill my bones, my mind up, so I'm coming to. Carolina, don't you know I'm right behind ya?. No love of mine is gonna wind up leaving me for Carolina. Leaving me for Carolina, leaving me for Carolina. . © sony/atv tunes llc;tiny bear music"
cassiopea,"Come in close now, it's time to tell a story. Long ago and so many years before we. Ever were, ever dreamed. We even could be. There was her and her very first heartbeat. All alone in the corner of the night sky. Spiral bones of a supernova starlight. Fell in love with another burning bright. She dreamed of a way to ignite. She said. ""Tonight. Come on, come on. Collide. Break me to pieces, I. I think you're just like heaven. Why. Come on, come on. Collide. Let's see what a fire feels like. I bet it's just like heaven"". (Just like heaven). Such a shame. Nowhere near, even the near mist. Lightyears away. From the hope of being sun-kissed. Anchored home in her interstellar sea. But, poor lonely Cassiopeia. So she sighs and she burns with aspiration. Learns to cry over love of constellations. Then the spark from a star shooting too close. They both smiled. What a day to explode. She said. ""Tonight. Come on, come on. Collide. Break me to pieces, I. I think you're just like heaven. ""Why. Come on, come on. Collide. Let's see what a fire feels like. I bet it's just like heaven"". (Just like heaven). Long ago in a sky built before us. A supernova grew up to be stardust"
chasing the sun,"Its a really old city. Stuck between the dead and the living. So I thought to myself. Sitting on a graveyard shelf. As the echo of heartbeats. From the ground below my feet. Filled a cemetery in the center of Queens. I started running the maze of. The names and the dates, some older than others. The skyscrapers, little tombstone brothers. With Manhattan behind her. Three million stunning reminders. Built a cemetery in the center of Queens. You said, remember that life is. Not meant to be wasted. We can always be chasing the sun!. So fill up your lungs and just run. But always be chasing the sun!. So how do you do it. With just words and just music, capture the feeling. That my earth is somebodys ceiling. Can I deliver in sound. The weight of the ground. Of a cemetery in the center of Queens. Theres a history through her. Sent to us as a gift from the future. To show us the proof. More than that, its to dare us to move. To open our eyes and to learn from the sky. From a cemetery in the center of Queens. You said, remember that life is. Not meant to be wasted. We can always be chasing the sun!. So fill up your lungs and just run. But always be chasing the sun!. All we can do is try. And live like were still alive. Its a really old city. Stuck between the dead and the living. So I thought to myself. Sitting on a graveyard shelf. And the gift of my heartbeat sounds like a symphony. Played by a cemetery in the center of Queens. You said, remember that life is. Not meant to be wasted. We can always be chasing the sun!. So fill up your lungs and just run. But always be chasing the sun!. All we can do is try. And live like were still alive. All we can do is try. And live like were still alive"
city,There's a harvest each Saturday night. At the bars filled with perfume and hitching a ride. A place you can stand for one night and get gone. It's clear this conversation ain't doing a thing. Cause these boys only listen to me when I sing. And I don't feel like singing tonight. All the same songs. CHORUS. Here in these deep city lights. Girl could get lost tonight. I'm finding every reason to be gone. There's nothing here to hold on to. Could I hold you?. The situation's always the same. You got your wolves in their clothes whispering Hollywood's name. Stealing gold from the silver they see. But it's not me. CHORUS. Calling out somebody save me I feel like I'm fading away. Calling out somebody save me I feel like I'm fading.... I'm fading. CHORUS
come home,"Hello world. Hope you're listening. Forgive me if I'm young. For speaking out of turn. There's someone I've been missing. I think that they could be. The better half of me. They're in the wrong place trying to make it right. But I'm tired of justifying. So I say you'll. Come home, come home. Cause I've been waiting for you. For so long, for so long. And right now there's a war between the vanities. But all I see is you and me. The fight for you is all I've ever known. So come home. Oooooh oooh. I get lost in the beauty. Of everything I see. The world ain't as half as bad. As they paint it to be. If all the sons. If all the daughters. Stopped to take it in. Well hopefully the hate subsides and the love can begin. It might start now yeah. Well maybe I'm just dreaming out loud. Until then. Come home, come home. Cause I've been waiting for you. For so long, for so long. And right now there's a war between the vanities. But all I see is you and me. The fight for you is all I've ever known. Ever known. So come home. Ooooooh oooooooooooooh. Everything I can't be. Is everything you should be. And that's why I need you here. Everything I can't be. Is everything you should be. And that's why I need you here. So hear this now. Come home, come home. Cause I've been waiting for you. For so long, for so long. And right now there's a war between the vanities. But all i see is you and me. The fight for you is all I've ever known. Ever known. So come home. Come home. Sara Bareilles.

come round soon,"I could use another cigarette.. But don't worry daddy, I'm not addicted yet.. One too many drinks tonight and I miss you,. Like you were mine. Your stormy words have barely broken. And you sound like thunder though you've barely spoken. Oh, it looks like rain tonight and thank God,. Cause a clear sky just wouldn't feel right.. CHORUS. He's taken and leaving but I keep believing. He's gonna come round soon. Till I see him again I'm staying believing. That it won't be deceiving when he's gonna come round soon.. You may be my final match.. 'Cause I chase everything when you play throw and I play catch. It never took much to keep me satisfied. But all this bullshit you feed me you miss me you need me. This hungry heart will not subside. CHORUS. Well I may seem naive if I cry as you leave like I'm just one more tortured heart. But baby don't be fooled.. Cause these cracks that I show as I'm watching you go aren't tearing me apart. And I know I'll see you soon. The angels said I'd smile today. Aw well who needs angels anyway?. CHORUS"
december,"Afternoon has settled long. And heady on my shoulders. The winter's light feels different on my skin. It doesn't seem to strike as far below the surface so. I have to conclude that shadow won't let it in. That shadow won't let it in. That shadow won't let it in. December. You've always been a problem child. December. You run me down right restless and wild. And I remember. When you used to be mine. December, oh. December, oh. The leaves are all still changing. The weather here is wild and vacant. Winter is blooming on Los Angeles. The artificial cold is more than I was hoping for. Not enough to consume. The darkened state I'm in. The darkened state I'm in. The darkened state I'm in. December. You've always been a problem child. December. You run me down right restless and wild. And I remember. When you used to be mine. December, oh. December, oh. There's still a whole year down into a day. Act like we all start over with a pristine slate. To get yourself a new life. You've got to give the other one away. And I'm starting to believe in the power of a name. 'Cause it can't be a mistake. If I just call it 'change'. December, oh (can't turn away now). December, oh (can't turn away now). December, oh (can't turn away now). The change can bring in circles again. The change"
door number three,"Door number two. It's for you, little lady. Is it all that you dreamed of?. How, if I knew, would've been there waiting. I'd have screamed out and jumped up. Now here I am. With my feet on the sand. And a body that won't move. The tide's coming in. And I'm bound for a swim. In a pair of cement shoes. He takes what he can, what he wants. Doesn't matter if it's ever been given. I took the bait and a chance on a man. Sold by the boy that he lived in. And I was wrong to believe that strength makes you strong. And I had hope in a change I would see in us both. And now I'm heavy. And he lifts me, but never once carried. Door number two I've already walked through. Ask me the question. Who coulda guessed I'd be here at this crossroad?. Plain to be seen that it's all up to me. I'm no longer alone, though. Nothing's changed. And I see it more every day. Nothing moves. It's a game to be played and to lose. And now I'm heavy, unsteady. But maybe I'm getting ready. And this might catch fire and char this ground. I might lift this up. To only be the one who's gonna get let down. Will I be enough to get this on its way. to find some higher ground?. Before the waters rush. I've got to make a change or else I know I'll drown. Baby, look around. Door number two I've already walked through. I wanna see what's behind door number three"
eden,"Let me paint a picture for you. Then I'll have to teach you to see it. Illustrate the remnants of the life. I used to live here in Eden. Rolled a lucky pair of dice, ended up paradise. Landed on a snakes eyes. took a bite and ended up bleeding. You know if I could change anything. I think I would start with the name. The truth is all those angels started acting the same. And I know theres no going back now cause. Life in Eden. Life in Eden changed. No way to make the pain play fair. It doesnt disappear just because you say it isnt there. So when they ask whyd she go. You can say cause. Life in Eden. Life in Eden changed. Life in Eden changed. Walking in the garden. Was a serpent-shaped heart and he told me. That what is broken cannot show. and less than beautiful is worse than unholy. Idolized my innocence, stole it from me in the end. Now Im wide awakened. and still paying for the poison they sold me. You know if I could change anything. I think I would start with the name. The truth is all those angels started acting the same. And I know theres no going back now cause. Life in Eden. Life in Eden changed. No way to make the pain play fair. It doesn't disappear just because you say it isnt there. So when they ask whyd she go. You can say cause. Life in Eden. Life in Eden changed.

And I know theres no going back now cause. Life in Eden. Life in Eden changed. No way to make the pain play fair. It doesnt disappear just because you say it isnt there. So when they ask whyd she go.

every day stranger,"Every word, every touch every look is a little too much. I’m helpless now to the arms of this stranger.. Haunting smiles, one by one creep inside and it’s over and done. Lost control, but without feeling danger. CHORUS. Does he know how it feels, to be dying inside when he goes. How it feels to be wondering if anything shows how it feels. Oh my everyday stranger.. Playing games in my mind say that I don’t want one of his kind.. I’ll wrap him up in a blanket of goodbyes. Then a turn for the worst, he looks up and I’m already cursed.. Tangled up and it’s harder to disguise.. CHORUS. There’s nothing I wouldn’t do to keep from dreaming of you. Unless you wanted me to.. But that’s something I may never know. There’s nothing I wouldn’t say to make it easier to walk away. Unless you ask me to stay. But the only way I’ll survive is if I go.. CHORUS"
everything changes,"Today's a day like any other. But I am changed. I am a mother. Oh in an instant. And who I was has disappeared. It doesn't matter, now you're here. So innocent. I was lost for you to find. And now I'm yours and you are mine. Two tiny hands, a pair of eyes. An unsung melody is mine for safekeeping. And I will guard it with my life. I'd hang the moon for it to shine on her sleeping. Starting here and starting now. I can feel the heart of how. Everything changes. My heart's at the wheel now. And all my mistakes. They make sense when I turn them around. Everything changes. What I thought was so permanent fades. And I swear I'll remember to say we were both born today. Oh, and it's true. What did I do to deserve you. I didn't know, but now I see. Sometimes what is, is meant to be. You saved me. My blurry lines, my messy life. Come into focus in a tied, maybe. I can heal and I can breathe. 'Cause I can feel myself believe. That everything changes. My heart's at the wheel now. And all my mistakes. They make sense when I turn them around. Everything changes. What I thought was so permanent fades. And I swear I'll remember to say we were both born today. Oh, and it's true. What did I do to deserve you. Thank God for you"

I didn't sign up with you. I'm not a present for your friends to open. This boy's too young to be singing the blues. So goodbye yellow brick road where the dogs of society howl. You can't plant me in your penthouse. I'm going back to my plough. Back to the howling old owl in the woods. Hunting the horny back toad. Oh, I've finally decided my future lies. Beyond the yellow brick road. What do you think you'll do then?. I bet that'll shoot down your plane. It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics to set you on your feet again. Maybe you'll get a replacement. There's plenty like me to be found. Mongrels who ain't got a penny. Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground. So goodbye yellow brick road where the dogs of society howl. You can't plant me in your penthouse. I'm going back to my plough. Back to the howling old owl in the woods. Hunting the horny back toad. Oh, I've finally decided my future lies. Beyond the yellow brick road"

hercules,"I miss the days my mind would just rest quiet. My imagination hadnt turned on me yet. I used to let my words wax poetic. But it melted a puddle at my feet now. It is a calcifying crime, its tragic. I've turned to petrified past life baggage. I want to disappear and just start over. So here we are. And I'll breathe again. Cause I have sent for a warrior. From on my knees, make me a Hercules. I was meant to be a warrior please. Make me a Hercules. I've lost a grip on where I started from. I wish I'd thought ahead and left a few crumbs. I'm on the hunt for who I've not yet become. But I'd settle for little equilibrium. There is a war inside my heart gone silent. Both sides dissatisfied and somewhat violent. The issue I have now begun to see. I am the only lonely casualty. This is not the end though. Cause I have sent for a warrior. From on my knees, make me a Hercules. I was meant to be a warrior please. Make me a Hercules. Cause I have sent for a warrior. From on my knees, make me a Hercules. I was meant to be a warrior please. Make me a Hercules. This is my darkest hour. A long road has lead me out here. But I only need turn around to face the light. And decide flight or fight"
hold my heart,"I never meant to be the one to let you down. If anything, I thought I saw myself going first. I didn't know how to stick around. How to see anybody but me be getting hurt.

Does anybody know how to hold my heart. How to hold my heart?. 'Cause I don't want to let go, let go, let go too soon. I want to tell you so before the sun goes dark. How to hold my heart. 'Cause I don't want to let go, let go, let go of you. I'm not the kind to try to tell you lies. But the truth is you've been hiding from it too. I see the end sneaking in behind your eyes. Saying things no words could ever do. Does anybody know how to hold my heart. How to hold my heart?. 'Cause I don't want to let go, let go, let go too soon. I want to tell you so before the sun goes dark. How to hold my heart. 'Cause I don't want to let go, let go, let go of you. Is anybody listening?. 'Cause I'm crying. Is anybody listening?.

i choose you,"Let the bough break, let it come down crashing. Let the sun fade out to a dark sky. I can't say I'd even notice it was absent. Cause I could live by the light in your eyes.

I will become yours and you will become mine. I choose you. I choose you. (Yeah). There was a time when I would have believed them. If they told me that you could not come true. Just love's illusion. But then you found me and everything changed. And I believe in something again. My whole heart. Will be yours forever. This is a beautiful start. To a lifelong love letter. Tell the world that we finally got it all right. I choose you. I will become yours and you will become mine. I choose you. I choose you. We are not perfect. We'll learn from our mistakes. And as long as it takes. I will prove my love to you. I am not scared of the elements. I am underprepared, but I am willing. And even better. I get to be the other half of you. Tell the world that we finally got it all right. I choose you. I will become yours and you will become mine. I choose you. I choose you"
i didn't plan it,"Go ahead. Throw your rocks at me. From your little glass house. And then take off running. You're no better than me. We've both made mistakes intentionally. And I won't do what you keep doing. Sit in judgment of a house I ruined. I don't claim to be proud. But my head wont be hung in shame. I didn't plan it. But the light turned red, and I ran it. And I'm still standing. It's not what I wanted, but now that it's right here. I understand it. A story written by my own hand. It's life biting right at your heels. I didn't plan it. But it's finally something to feel. Oh. Look around you. Ain't no saints here baby. We're all just looking for a little less crazy. And sometimes it's a hard left turn. Down a road you'd never thought you'd see. Don't you think dealing blame is a hazard. I'm not the only one whose dark side has her. I didn't plan it. Taking back what's been taken for granted. 'Cause I can't stand it. I'm sick of the way I've been waiting to break free. I needed saving. And a good mistake needed making. Maybe you need the same thing. I didn't plan it. Taking back what's been taken for granted. I'm sick of the way I've been waiting to break free. I didn't plan it. But it's finally something to feel. Something to feel"
i just want you,"Give me a heart to hold the godlike truth. Give me one good soul that I can tell it through. Give me good reason to believe in you. And give me strength if you have time. Give me two hands that'll hold us up. And though you give me no more than just enough. You gave a pair of brown eyes that could call a good love. To somebody who thinks they shine. You, I just want you. I just want you. Spend most of my life on a microphone. Giving all that I got til I back home. And when the lights go out, and I'm all alone. I've got no reason to be crying. And on a bad day I feel like a masochist. Take it away from me if it's for the best. Somehow I've ended up the head of this. Freight train that isn't mine. You, I just want you. I just want you. So take it all away. If it isn't meant for me. I don't want the easy way. I just want you. They can give me everything. But at the end of the day. The only words I'll say. Is ""I just want you"". OOh, mm, mm. It's all so simple when you break it all down. Two roads converged down the hollow ground. It's taken all my life to hear the sacred sound. Of sweet simplicity. Saying ""Give it all back, it don't mean a thing"". You got a short-lived life and a song to sing. And the only way up is believing. And never looking down. So take it all away. If it isn't meant for me. I don't want the easy way. I just want you. They can give me everything. But at the end of the day. The only words I'll say. Is ""I just want you"". You, you, you.

in your eyes,"Love. I get so lost, sometimes. Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart. When I want to run away I drive off in my car. But, whichever way I go I come back to the place you are. But, all my instincts - they return. The grand facade so soon will burn. Without a noise - without my pride. I reach out from the inside. Love love love love love. I get so lost, sometimes. Days pass they pass and this emptiness fills my heart. When I want to run away I drive off in my car. But, whichever way I go I come back to the place you are. But, all my instincts - they return. The grand facade so soon will burn. Without a noise - without my pride. I reach out from the inside. In your eyes - the light, the heat. I am complete in your eyes. See the doorways of a thousand churches in your eyes. The resolution of all the fruitless searching. In Your Eyes. Love love love love love. I don't like to see so much pain. So much wasted, and this moment keeps slipping away. I get so tired working so hard for our survival. I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive. But, all my instincts - they return. The grand facade so soon will burn. Without a noise - without my pride. I reach out from the inside. In your eyes - the light, the heat. I am complete in your eyes. See the doorways of a thousand churches. I will not be that complete. In your eyes. In your eyes. In your eyes. In your eyes. Love. I get so lost, sometimes"
inside out,"I’ve been winding down the same road for days,. I’ve seen the coastline going both ways.. Some days are perfect, and some simply could not get worse.. Some days it’s all worth it, and some days this life is nothing but a curse.. And I wonder who will break first…. CHORUS. I am small. I feel like no more than nothing at all.. But when I lose sight of daylight, and my darkness falls. I’ll be strong. And if not now it won’t be long. From when I lose sight of daylight. And my hands are weak and my soul is tired. Oh, I’ll give my love from the inside out. From the inside out. Little spirit, now don’t you desert me now. I know I don’t always hear it, but you don’t always speak so loud.. And I’m not willing to simply lay down my soul for this.. It may be all that I’m giving, oh but take my love for what it is.. CHORUS. Take your best shot. Here I stand heart in hand.. And fearless I’m not, but I am what I am.. I know what I’m not, and I know enough to know it’s never. Gonna be much more than weather, you can’t drive me away. When it’s only rain.. It’s only rain.. It’s only rain.. It’s only rain."
islands,Waiting for the bus stop. Waiting for the concrete black top to settle down. Long enough for me to get off and get a little ground. I'm ready for the sea change. Helpless felt this coming from a mile away. And now You're looking at me babe. and how well separate if we can. Cause I still count on one hand. the number of good men I know.

When will you realize. You must become an island. You must become an island. You must become an island. And see for yourself that thats what I am. You always dirty up the windows. If you keep em at bay that way. No ones gonna surprise you by getting too close. Anybody but me though. You've made exceptions to your rules.

kaleidoscope heart,All the colors. Of the rainbow. Hidden 'neath my skin. Hearts have colors. Don't we all know?. Red runs through our veins. Feel the fire burning up. Inspire me with blood. Of blue and green. I have hope. Inside is not a heart. But a kaleidoscope
king of anything,"Keep drinking coffee, stare me down across the table. While I look outside. So many things I'd say if only I were able. But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by. You've got opinions, man. We're all entitled to 'em. But I never asked. So let me thank you for your time. And try not to waste any more of mine. Get out of here fast. I hate to break it to you babe. But I'm not drowning. There's no one here to save. Who cares if you disagree? You are not me. Who made you king of anything?. So, you dare tell me who to be. Who died and made you king of anything?. You sound so innocent. All full of good intent. Swear you know best. But you expect me to. Jump up onboard with you. Ride off into your delusional sunset. I'm not the one who's lost. With no direction, oh. But you'll never see. You're so busy making masks. With my name on it in all caps. You've got the talking down. Just not the listening. Who cares if you disagree? You are not me. Who made you king of anything?. So you dare tell me who to be. Who died and made you king of anything?. All my life I've tried. To make everybody happy while I just hurt and hide. Waiting for someone to tell me it's my turn. To decide. Who cares if you disagree? You are not me. Who made you king of anything?. So you dare tell me who to be. Who died and made you king of anything?. Who cares if you disagree? You are not me. Who made you king of anything?. So you dare tell me who to be. Who died and made you king of anything?.

let the rain,"I wish I were pretty. I wish I were brave. If I owned this city. Then I'd make it behave. And if I were fearless. Then I'd speak my truth. And the world would hear this. That's what I wish I'd do, yeah. If my hands could hold them you'd see. I'd take all these secrets in me. And I'd move and mold them to be. Something I'd set free. I want to darken in the skies. Open the floodgates up. I want to change my mind. I want to be enough. I want the water in my eyes. I want to cry until the end of time. I want to let the rain come down. Make a brand new ground.

lie to me,"Tell the truth,no lies. I can't take it. Burned your breath,just this once. Run your mouth. I bet I can catch it. You sound just like a Judas. And if there's anything I learned. That would keep me standing. If I take you and your word. Than I'm empty handed. And tell my gut I should be burning brandy. So I can see you lie to me. I wish the air would come in red. When you breathing. And so I could have seen it coming. Look in my eyes when you say you love me. So I can see you lie to me. Lost be found. I'm a bloodhound born for seeking. Pour a pray must we die. Soon it will grow. But your act drives a beating. And now it's all off far. If there's anything I learned. That would keep me standing. If I take you and your word.

Look in my eyes when you say you love me. So I can see you lie to me"
little black dress,"Ok, I can see it now, it's all the same thing. Just different wrapping around it. No need, to soften your words. They're still gonna hurt, so don't pull punches. I tried, to be everything you ever wanted. Sometimes, I even stood on my heart and stomped. Now I'm, finally alone and dressed for the show. But going nowhere. They don't need to see me crying. I got my little black dress on. And if I put on my favorite song. I'm gonna dance until you're all gone. I'll get my little black dress on. You came, lifted me up. But then you dropped a hurricane. Now I'm fighting to find the ground again. Steady my feet, get up off my knees and just remember. That I am, more than just somebody's puppet. I can, find the court and then I'll cut it. I stand, a pretty good chance to dust myself off and dance. I got my little black dress on. And if I put on my favorite song. I'm gonna dance until you're all gone. I'll get my little black dress on. I got my little black dress on. And if I tell myself there's nothing wrong. This doesn't have to be a sad song. Now with my little black dress on. It's time to connect the dots. Draw a different picture of. And paint you with the colors of. Everything I ever was. And turn to the scene of the crime. The day I let the music die. And rewrite the final lines. This time I.

love is christmas,"I don't care if the house is packed,. Or if the strings of light are broken.. I don't care if the presents are wrapped,. Or if there's nothing here to open.. Love is not a toy, and no paper will conceal it.. Love is simply joy that I'm home.. I don't care if the carpet is stained; we have food upon the table.. I don't care if it's gonna rain, our room is warm and stable.. Love is who we are, and no season can contain it.. Love would never fall for that.. Let love lead us, love is Christmas.. Why so scared that you'll mess it up? Imperfection keeps you haunted.. All you need is your best my love, that's all anyone ever wanted.. Love is how we do, let no judgment over- rule it.. Love I look to you, and I sing.. Let love lead us, love is Christmas.. Let love lead us, love is Christmas."
love on the rocks,"We met on a rainy evening in the summertime. Don't think I need to tell you more. I needed a raise I worked so hard for this love of mine. Still I got nothing to show for it.. Here's a simplification of everything we're going though. You plus me is bad news. But you're a lovely creation and I like to think that I am too. But my friend said I look better without you.. Tongue tied and twisted, go on baby and go to my head.. CHORUS. Babe, baby believe me. If I stay it ain't gonna be easy. Okay we'll do it your way. But this is the last time. You'll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down. Love on the rocks.. You love the chase but hate me for the runaround. We both just tired of the whole thing.. You tell me what you want you need you know you have to have. And I just pretend I'm listening. Too tired this time to deal with old suits you wear with your ties that won't bind.. CHORUS. Babe, baby believe me. If I stay it ain't gonna be easy. Okay we'll do it your way. But this is the last time. You'll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down. Love on the rocks.. Hot as hell cold as ice sip it slow cause it's so nice. Dulls my senses drives my pain and still I do it again. Burns a bit to the touch dangerous if it's too much. If this bottle could talk..... Love on the Rocks. CHORUS"

manhattan,You can have Manhattan. I know it's for the best. I'll gather up the avenues. And leave them on your doorstep. And I'll tip toe away. So you won't have to say. You heard me leave. You can have Manhattan. I know it's what you want. The bustle and the buildings. The weather in the fall. And I'll bow out of place. To save you some space. For somebody new. You can have Manhattan. Cause I can't have you. You can have Manhattan. The one we used to share. The one where we were laughing. And drunk on just being there. Hang on to the reverie. Could you do that for me?. Cause I'm just too sad to. You can have Manhattan. Cause I can't have you. And so it goes. One foot after the other. Til black and white begin to color in. And I know. That holding us in place. Is simply fear of what's already changed. You can have Manhattan. I'll settle for the beach. And sunsets facing westward. The sand beneath my feet. I'll wish this away. Just missing the days. When I was one half of two. You can have Manhattan. Cause I can't have you

morningside,"I'm not scared of you now. Or so I say. There's no reason to run. Although I may. I'm not as sure as I seem. This much I know. What does it mean when you leave and I follow?. I could try to forget what you do when I let you get. Through to me but then you do it over again. I could rage like a fire and you'd bring rain I desire. 'Til you get to me on my morningside.

Afternoons run for cover and full moons just wonder. What it looks like here on my morningside. Look back. Don't you dare let me start to do that. I don't care if the things that I have. Only make me afraid to lose I. Need to let go. Need to want to keep letting you know. That we both have a reason to follow. Long as we let this lead I'm barely breathing.

my love,"He bends his breath around my name. And I am humbled I feel small and plain.. But his arms are angels by his side.. You need not ask if they’re open, just how wide.. His lips are day, and his skin is night.. Oooh, and with our love we conjure up the twilight.. His fingers are music to my soul.. And I feel his song play everywhere I go.. CHORUS. My love, my love is on his way. Can’t wait to see the day I thankfully lay me down. My love my love is on his way. I’m waiting patiently, but if you see me now. My love, please hurry. He loves with rhythm, and paints with flame. He comes in pieces with no name. I won’t need answers I’ll just know. Cause I’ve read the sonnets about his soul. He can be ordinary in the best ways. And still dance like a poet through every word he says.. CHORUS. All that I never knew can you see me now. All that I never said, can you see me now. He makes me crazy, he makes me cruel.. Oh, but I pray he makes me anything but a fool. Oooh, my love…"
never ever getting rid of me,"I will never let you let me leave. I promise I'm not lying. Go ahead ask anybody who has seen me trying. I'm not going, if it seems like I did. I'm probably waiting outside. Such a stubborn man you'll likely never meet another. When we have our family dinner you can ask my mother. She's the best, learn all about her on our family history test. I'm gonna do this right. Show you I'm not moving. Wherever you go, I won't be far to follow. Oh, I'm gonna love you so. You'll learn what I already know. I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me. You can try, oh, but I. I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me. I grew up an only child in a suburb of the city. Spent my days alone my only friend was a stray kitty called Sardine. I though it was hilarious to call a cat a kind of fish. She played hard to get hissing while she scratched me. What she was trying to say was ""Ogie come and catch me"". I learned quickly, perserverance stood between a cat and her new best friend, me. Oh, I'm gonna do this right. Show you I'm not moving. Wherever you go, I won't be far to follow. Oh, I'm gonna love you so. You'll learn what I already know. I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me. You can try, oh, but I. I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me. You can try, oh, but I. I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me"
not alone,"It comes calling in the evening. When the temperature is dropping out. They said it don't get cold here. But I beg to differ now. There is something in the shadows. More than sister silhouette. Something sinister and strange. That I haven't seen yet. And I don't want to be alone. Sky, don't let the sun go. I'm not ready for the darkness. Swear upon a heartless soul. And I don't want to cry when you go. Stay a little longer, you know. You're making me feel. I'm not alone. You don't have to fight the bad guys. Throwing punches out into the black. If you have to tell me lies, I don't care. Just give me some good back. I don't want to be alone. Sky, don't let the sun go. I'm not ready for the darkness. Swear upon a heartless soul. And I don't want to cry when you go. Stay a little longer, you know. You're making me feel. I'm not alone. And if I only worry 'bout it. Worry 'bout it, worry 'bout it. I just keep breaking down. Breaking down, breaking down. Boy, I could do without. Do without, do without. A night of the bad dreams, sad things. Tell me what that means. I don't want to be alone. Sky, don't let the sun go. I'm not ready for the darkness. Swear upon a heartless soul. And I don't want to cry when you go. Stay a little longer, you know. You're making me feel. The monsters aren't real. You're making me feel. I'm not alone"
once upon another time,"Once upon another time. Somebody's hands who felt like mine. Turned a key into good drive. Was free. I recall the sun sank low. Buckley on the radio. Cigarette was burning slow. So breathe. Just yellow lines,and tire marks. And some kiss skin in handle bars. And where I stood, was where I was. To be. No enemies to call my own. No porchline on to pull me home. And where I was is beautiful. Because I was free. Once upon another time. Before I knew which life was mine. Before I left the child behind ,be. I saw myself in summer nights. And stars that up like candle lights. I make my wish but mostly, I believed. And yellow lines and tire marks. Some kiss skin in handle bars. And where I stood, was where I was. To be. Once upon another time. Decided nothing good in dying. So I would just keep on driving. Because I was free"
one sweet love,"Just about the time the shadows call. I undress my mind and dare you to follow. Paint a portrait of mystery. Only close my eyes and you are here with me. A nameless face to think I see. To sit and watch the waves with me till they're gone. A heart I'd swear I'd recognize is. Made out of my own devices....could I be wrong?. Chorus. Time that I've taken. Pray is not wasted. Have I already tasted my piece of. One sweet love?. Ready and waiting. For a heart worth the breaking. But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of. One sweet love.. Sleepless nights you creep inside of me. Paint your shadows on the breath that we share. You took more than just my sanity. You've taken my reason not to care. No ordinary wings I'll need. The sky itself will carry me back to you. The things I dream that I can do. I'll open up the moon for you. Just come down soon. Chorus. Time that I've taken. Pray is not wasted. Have I already tasted my piece of. One sweet love?. Ready and waiting. For a heart worth the breaking. But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of. One sweet love.. Savor the sorrow to soften the pain. Sip on the southern rain, as I do. I don't look don't touch don't do anything. But hope that there is a you.. The earth that is the space between. I'd banish it from under me... to get to you.. An unexpected love provides. My solitary's suicide... oh I wish I knew. Chorus. Time that I've taken. Pray is not wasted. Have I already tasted my piece of. One sweet love?. Ready and waiting. For a heart worth the breaking. But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of. One sweet love."
opening up,"The day starts like the rest I've seen. And all the carbon copy of where I've already been. Days keep coming one on one, and they keep coming. Don't know what I wish I had. But there's no time now. For thinking things like that. I've got too much to do (too much to do). We've got too much to do, too much to do. Opening up, letting the day in. Pour you a cup and say, ""Hello, how ya been? "". Looking around, seeing the same things. It's comforting how some things never change. Never change, never change. Do they?. I wouldn't call this place a happy end. But I've been 'round the block and just came back again. Could be worse, so make it work, no place is perfect. Hey, no good in the outside world. Because I feel too much and find it usually hurts. I like the way most of the days look exactly the same. Opening up, everyday starts. Over a cup, served with, ""Hello, how ya been? "". Welcoming in, whatever the day brings. More of the same things. Check the clock, tick, tick, tock. Don't stop, serve with a smile, hurry up. Fill the coffee cup, and then in a while. Take a breath, when you need to be reminded. That days like these, we can only do the best we can. And do it all again. It's the heartbeat, the center, the lifeline, you enter. It's the heartbeat, the center, the lifeline, you enter. It's the heartbeat, the center, the lifeline, you enter. Opening up, letting the day in. Pour you a cup and say, ""Hello, how ya been? "". Looking around, seeing the same things. It's comforting how some things never change. Never change, never change and never change"
red,"I've been down, I've been out. I did it all on my own. Seems growing up didn't take long. Feel Strange I feel good. I feel better with you. You've changed, you should. Cause I think I did too. Made my mistakes, and did a few things right. But it will take what it will take, baby that's life. You cannot change what you do not own, everybody knows. But if you live deep and love strong you get pretty damn close. It moves fast and it scares me. I close my eyes, oh but I still see.... I'm fading in and out what are you supposed to do save me know. From all of this danger you don't know how and I'll find my way out. When I'm in the red listening to strangers inside my head. The darkening angels beneath the bed. I still see everything you said. Crimson in Red. I shake and I smile, cause you said. Baby girl it may take a while, but take the good from the bad. And never minds are never sure so never leave them wanting more. What are you waiting for?. How you love is who you are. I dive in and I sink in. And I find new colors to think in.... I'm fading in and out what are you supposed to do save me know. From all of this danger you don't know how and I'll find my way out. When I'm in the red listening to strangers inside my head. The darkening angels beneath the bed. I still see everything you said. Crimson in Red. In the distance is a line defining where I've been the state I'm in. And ever since it began to slip from my two hands I've been. Taunting fires, touching wires, been believing liars. Everything they said. Painted in Red. I'm fading in and out what are you supposed to do save me know. From all of this danger you don't know how and I'll find my way out. When I'm in the red listening to strangers inside my head. The darkening angels beneath the bed. I still see everything you said. Painted in Red. What are you gonna do?. No way for you to save me. What are you gonna do?. Everything that you gave me is painted in Red"
responsible,"Bound for the Blessing. You wouldn’t see it coming. I keep you guessing. Watch while you come undone.. You were an island that no one would dare to tread upon.. I came in like the wise men, and ask you to take my gift of love.. CHORUS. Hold me responsible. It’s all my fault.. I want you to hold me any way you can.. Hold me accountable. It’s all my fault.. I want you to hold me any way you can.. Careful confessions. Can’t scare you with my crime. I learned my lesson. Love you a little at a time.. But I’m losing my patience, getting acquainted with the edge.. I’m ready and waiting. Happy to stand convicted.. CHORUS. I can’t change you when you won’t change yourself.. But I see you slowly becoming someone else.. I can’t blame you for the strength you lack.. Scared to give what you may not get back.. CHORUS"
root down,"If I build it out of blood and bone. If I love it and I even give it a good name. And I let it stand up on it's own. And if I even ever learn to trust and to walk away. Will it crumble on it's own two feet?. Or will it multiply and grow big white wings?. If I love it and I give it life. Can I let it go and know that it was never mine?. Give more, give it all away. I'm sure it'll come back someday. You gotta let go to let it circle back around. To rise up you gotta learn to root down. If I cut it with a heart-shaped knife. And I send it to my very closest of friends. And they somehow bring it back to life. What if I only ever do it all over again?. I'm a writer here upon this ship. On a sea of unnamed and untamed passages. And every vessel's meant for pouring out. And every bloom has to make room to root down. Give more, give it all away. I'm sure it'll come back someday. You gotta let go to let it circle back around. To rise up you gotta learn to root down. Learn to root down. Give more, give it all away. I'm sure it'll come back someday. You gotta let go to let it circle back around. To rise up you gotta learn to root down"

You may find yourself in the dead of night. Lost somewhere out there. in the great big beautiful sky. And we're all just perfect little satellites. Spinning round and round this broken earthly life. This is so you know. The sound of someone who loves you. From the ground. Tonight you're not alone at all. This is me sending out my satellite call. This is so you'll know the sound. Of someone who loves you from the ground. Tonight you're not alone at all. This is me sending out my satellite call"
say you're sorry,"Circus of silence down at our feet. Paper cut tigers starting to bleed. Hang from your tightrope above the mess. Just say you're sorry, no more no less. Words you won't use, you don't feel them like I do. Show will be over soon. It's not the curtain closing causing us to call it a day. I want to walk away too. But I want you to say you are sorry. I'm not the one who went and made a mistake. I want to walk away too. But I want you to say you are sorry. I used to believe that the storybook's true. Now I don't need it, at least not with you. So if you see him, the man 'neath the mask. Tell him I'm leaving and not looking back. Words are no use, you don't need them like I do. Show will be over soon. It's not the curtain closing causing us to call it a day. I want to walk away too. But I want you to say you are sorry. I'm not the one who went and made a mistake. I want to walk away too. But I want you to say you're sorry. I want the one word that you refuse to say to me. You're so good at giving me responsibility. I wash my hands clean and let you watch me as I go. I'm sorry for you, just so you know. It's not the curtain closing causing us to call it a day. I want to walk away too. But I want you to say you are sorry. I'm not the one who went and made a mistake. I want to walk away too. But I want you to say you're sorry"
send me the moon,"Holding my breath. Last one I’ve got left. 'til I see you. Deliver my heart with the. Pieces and parts of me left. Every last day seemed to carry the weight. A life time. Watch from the ground. As the gold fluttered down from the sky. Sweet sun. Send me the moon. Empty the skies out. Bringing me one step closer to you. Send it soon. And I will breathe in, breathe out. Until you come in and out. Of view. Of view. Inches away from you. Scared what I’ll take from you, darling. I can live with your ghost. If you say that’s the most I’ll get. Darkness to light. Moved from day into nigh to be near you. Still here I stand. I am sinking like sand in your sea. Sweet sun. Send me the moon. Empty the skies out. Bringing me one step closer to you. Send it soon. And I will breathe in, breathe out. Until you come in and out. Of view. Of view. You already do. Never you mind where the evening should find us. Together. Distance can’t take what is hidden here. Safe in my chest. I’ll wait for the day when. We finally say now or never. Till then I’ll be here wanting more. As I settle for at most fear. Sweet sun. Send me the moon. Empty the skies out. Bringing me one step closer to you. Send it soon. And I will breathe in, breathe out. Until you come in and out. And I will breathe in, breathe out. Until you come in.... And I will breathe in, breathe out. Until you come in and out. Of view. Of view. By: @kathgoncalves"
she used to be mine,"It's not simple to say. Most days I don't recognize me. These shoes and this apron. That place and it's patrons. Have taken more than I gave them. It's not easy to know. I'm not anything that I used to be, although it's true. I was never attention sweet center. I still remember that girl. She's imperfect but she tries. She is good but she lies. She is hard on herself. She is broken and won't ask for help. She is messy but she's kind. She is lonely. Most of the time. She is all of this mixed up. And baked in a beautiful pie. She is gone but she used to be mine. And it's not what I asked for. Sometimes life just slips in through back door. And carves out the person. And makes you believe it's so true. And now I've got you. And you're not what I asked for. If I'm honest I know I would give it all back. For a chance to start over. And rewrite an ending or two. For the girl that I knew. Who be reckless just enough. Who get hurt. But who learns how to toughen up. When she's bruised. And gets used by a man who can't love. And then she'll get stuck. And be scared. Of the life that's inside her. Growing stronger each day. Til it finally reminds her. To fight just a little. To bring back the fire in her eyes. That's been gone but it used to be mine. Used to be mine. She is messy but she's kind. She is lonely most of the time. She is all of this mixed up. And baked in a beautiful pie. She is gone. But she used to be mine"

soft place to land,"Sugar. Sugar, butter, flour. Sometimes I still see her. My mother the dreamer. She'd say, ""Nothing's impossible child"". A dream needs believing. To taste like the real thing. Like some stranger you recognize. So pure, so pure, so electric. So sure, so sure, so connected. To those little believers inside. May we all be so lucky. But dreams are elusive. The kind we've gotten used to. Is nothing I can feel. Nothing I can hold. Nothing I can have. Nothing that I know. Dreams come and they go. But hold them and keep them. And know that you need them. When your breaking point's all that you have. A dream is a soft place to land. May we all be so lucky. Sugar, butter, flour"

summer is over,"Autumn never seemed this cold before. Here I am sleeping on the floor. We changed just like the leaves. Outside my house. And my phone lay silent by the couch. I remember June. Back when I met you. And your eyes were green. And we were, too. But summer is over. We were tangled in the morning sun. I Felt you getting colder. And we knew that we would come undone. And it's back to my town, back to your life. Gray skies are blowing a kiss goodbye to the lovers. 'Cause summer is over. I can still see your silhouette. In the white hot sand. I still feel your ring on my hand. And the clock was always ticking down. Behind that glass. Singing ""love, be good while you last"". But we both knew. What we were getting into. And the things we said. Sounded true. But summer is over. We were tangled in the morning sun. I felt you getting colder. And we knew that we would come undone. And it's back to my town, back to your life. Gray skies are blowing a kiss goodbye to the lovers. 'Cause summer is over. We were tangled in the morning sun. I felt you getting colder. And we knew that we would come undone. And it's back to my town, back to your life. Gray skies are blowing a kiss. Goodbye, goodbye. Summer is over. We were tangled in the morning sun.

But that only happens. When I get provoked. By some piece of shit. Asshole we all sadly know. And I sit and I write. While reminding you all. That mean songs. Are still better than going postal. That guy's an asshole. And that girl's a bitch. Baby it's natural. No getting away from it. So sing it out with me. And then let it go. Fuck that guy he's just an asshole. And so I surprised you. With some of my words. And I know that surprises, while fine, still can hurt. Whatever.. I hate to think. I have ruined the day. You're the dick and the queen of the high horse parade.

And I’m getting weary waiting for the harbor lights to change. I’ve forgotten what I do it for but I tread water just the same. I tread water. I tread water. Thought this life would lead.

turn to me,"From time to time I talk to you. As if you could hear me speak.. The breath of me but words of you. You take the one away, and the other still makes me weak..

I know I'm not the first. CHORUS. From time to time I turn to you. But I won't let it show like you want me to.. My head held so high; I can hardly see. Wouldn't notice if you were turned to me.. If you were turned to me.. I hope you can understand. Because we've all been there some. When you're hanging from someone else's hand. The moment of letting go will leave your fingertips numb.. It's a simple world. I know the tables turn.. And I'll close the book of you word after word.. CHORUS. If you were turned to me I wouldn't think twice to turn the tacit hands of time back to when you were mine.. But it's a paradox of chains and locks I keep on looking forward when I walk so I see almost nothing at all.... Except when from....... CHORUS"
uncharted,"No words. But tears won't make any room for more. And it don't hurt like anything I've ever felt before. This is no broken heart. No familiar scars. This territory goes uncharted.

And I want uncharted. I'm stuck under the ceiling I made. I can't help but feeling. I'm going down. Follow if you wanna or just hang around. Like you'll show me where to go. I'm already out of foolproof ideas. So don't ask me how to get started. It's all uncharted. Each day. I'm counting up the minutes till I get alone. Cause I can't stay in the middle of it all. It's nobody's fault but I'm so low. Never knew how much I didn't know. Oh, everything is uncharted. I know I'm getting nowhere when I only sit and stare like. I'm going down. Follow if you wanna or just hang around. Like you'll show me where to go. I'm already out of foolproof ideas. So don't ask me how to get started. It's all uncharted. Jumpstart my kaleidoscope heart. Love to watch the colors fade. They may not make sense but they sure as hell made me. I won't go as a passenger, no. Waiting for the road to be laid. Though I may be going down. I'll take in flame over burning out. Compare where you are to where you wanna be. And you'll get nowhere. I'm going down. Follow if you wanna or just hang around. Like you'll show me where to go. I'm already out of foolproof ideas. So don't ask me how to get started, oh. I'm going down. Follow if you wanna or just hang around. Like you'll show me where to go. I'm already out of foolproof ideas. So don't ask me how to get started. It's all uncharted"
undertow,"Silly me, look what I did again.. I found what I want is what I cannot have. I didn’t mean to be so predictable,. But I blame it all on who made you irresistible. And it isn’t something I need 'til you tell me I can’t. Why wear my heart on my sleeve when it looks so good in your hand.. CHORUS. My heart breaks in a heart beat. And you storm me when you come and go. The taste of something so sweet should have. Warned me 'bout the undertow.. Oh, I couldn’t find a better man to let me go.. Little girl, I don’t know why you stay.. If I had a feather for every time daddy said that I could fly away.. Old habits are so hard to break. It’d be a shame to stop now that I’ve started to make really good mistakes.. And I don’t know why I must ask for the forbidden fruit.. I saw the snake in the grass, but I had bitten too soon.. CHORUS. I should have seen you coming in. Should recognize the signs a wave’s gonna break. Now, I’ve given in, why fight it when. I’m resigned to simply live in your wake.. Your wake….. CHORUS"
vegas,"Gonna sell my car and go to Vegas. Cause somebody told me that's where dreams would be.. Gonna sell my car and go to Vegas. Finally see my name upon the Palace marquis. Gonna quit my job and move to New York. Cause somebody told me that's where dreamers should go.. Gonna quit my job and move to New York.. And tattoo my body with every Broadway show.. CHORUS. Listen up now honey, you're gonna be sorry. Can't get out from under a sky that is falling. You say... No fame no money I'm nobody. The way I'm running has sure got me down on my knees. But next stop, Vegas please. Gonna sell my house and cross the border. Cause somebody said that dreams live in Mexico. Gonna sell my house and gonna lose ten pounds and cross the border. And make love upon the white sandy shore. CHORUS. Listen up now honey, you're gonna be sorry. Can't get out from under a sky that is falling. You say... No fame no money I'm nobody. The way I'm running has sure got me down on my knees. But next stop, Vegas please. It's always just around the corner or you're on your way to somewhere. That is bigger, better if you could only get there. It's never your fault you can't start your winning streak. But I'd hate to lose you to the fortune you seek.. Gonna lose my mind and sail the ocean. Gonna find my peace beneath cherry blue skies. Gonna fix my mind upon a final destination. Upon a sweet dream I'll never realize. CHORUS. Listen up now honey, you're gonna be sorry. Can't get out from under a sky that is falling. You say... No fame no money I'm nobody. The way I'm running has sure got me down on my knees. But next stop, Vegas please... I got to get to Vegas. I got to get to Vegas."
waiting to see,"The darkness of these starlit skies sets down upon my tired eyes. And I’m waiting for the last uncertainty. I’ve walked across these streets before and it always seemed outside your door. The heaviness subsides so I can breath. And I’m waiting to see you. Waiting to be you. Waiting to see. If I can breathe you in, if you’ll let me out. Of this caged up soul that I’ve created that surrounds me now. If there is truth inside you or a demon in me. If you ask me what I’m waiting for. I’m waiting to see. The hazy dawn and morning’s light awake and now you’re in my sight. But I’m not sure if my feelings yet have grown. The fear that plagues the heart of me dances in the part of me. That faces everything I’ve ever known. And I’m waiting to feel you. Scared of the real you. Waiting to see. If I can breathe you in, if you’ll let me out. Of this caged up soul that I’ve created that surrounds me now. If there is truth inside you or a demon in me. If you ask me what I’m waiting for. I’m waiting to see. Waiting to see what I might be if released from chains that bind me from within. But I’m holding out from feelings of doubt that capture my release. I’m waiting for peace. So come in, oooh let me out. Ask me what I’m waiting for. I’m waiting to see."
what's inside,"Sugar. Sugar (butter). Sugar (butter, flour). Sugar (butter, flour). Sugar (butter, flour). Sugar. My hands pluck the things I know that I'll need. I'll take the sugar and butter from the pantry. I add the flour to begin what I'm hoping to start. And then it's down with the recipe. And bake from the heart. What's inside. Everyone wants to know what's inside. And I've always told them but I. Feel something needs to change. You wanna know what's inside. I could tell you if I wasn't hiding. My whole life is in here. In this kitchen baking. What a mess I'm making. Sugar, butter, flour. Sugar, butter, flour"
when he sees me,"I stick with real things. Usually facts and figures. When information's in its place. I minimize the guessing game. Guess what?. I don't like guessing games. Or when I feel things. Before I know the feelings. How am I supposed to operate. If I'm just tossed around by fate?. Like on an unexpected date?. The stranger who might talk too fast. Or ask me questions about myself. Before I've decided that. He can ask me questions about myself. He might sit too close. Or call the waiter by his first name. Or eat Oreos. But eat the cookie before the cream?. But what scares me the most. what scares me the most. Is what if when he sees me, what if he doesn't like it?. What if he runs the other way and I can't hide from it?. What happens then?. If when he knows me, he's only disappointed?. What if I give myself away, to only get it given back?. I couldn't live with that. So, I'm just fine, inside my shell-shaped mind. This way I get the best view. So, when he sees me, I want him to. I'm not defensive. I'm simply being cautious. I can't risk reckless dating. Due to my miscalculating. While a certain suitor stands in line. I've seen in movies. Most made for television. You cannot be too careful. When it comes to sharing your life. I could end up a miserable wife. He could be criminal, some sort of psychopath. who escaped from an institution. somewhere where they don't have girls. He could have masterminded some way to find me. He could be colorblind. How untrustworthy is that. He could be less than kind. Or even worse he could be very nice, have lovely eyes. And make me laugh, come out of hiding. What do I do with that?. Oh, God. What if when he sees me. I like him and he knows it?. What if he opens up a door. And I can't close it?. What happens then?. If when he holds me. My heart is set in motion. I'm not prepared for that. I'm scared of breaking open. But still I can't help from hoping. To find someone to talk to. Who likes the way I am. Someone who when he sees me. Wants to again"
winter song (feat. ingrid michaelson),Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum. Bum bum bum bum bum bum. Bum bum bum bum bum bum. This is my winter song to you. The storm is coming soon. It rolls in from the sea. My voice; a beacon in the night. My words will be your light. To carry you to me. Is love alive?. Is love alive?. Is love. They say that things just cannot grow. Beneath the winter snow. Or so I have been told. They say were buried far. Just like a distant star. I simply cannot hold. Is love alive?. Is love alive?. Is love. [Chorus 3]. This is my winter song. December never felt so wrong. Because you're not where you belong. Inside my arms. Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum. Bum bum bum bum bum bum. Bum bum bum bum bum bum. I still believe in summer days. The seasons always change. And life will find a way. I'll be your harvester of light. And send it out tonight. So we can start again. Is love alive?. Is love alive?. Is love. This is my winter song. December never felt so wrong. Because you're not where you belong. Inside my arms. This is my winter song to you. The storm is coming soon. It rolls in from the sea. My love a beacon in the night. My words will be your light. To carry you to me. Is love alive?. Is love alive?. Is love. Is love alive?. Is love alive?. Is love. Is love alive?. Is love alive?. Is love
yellow,"Look at the stars. Look how they shine for you. And everything you do. They were all yellow. I came along. I wrote a song for you. And everything you do. It was all yellow. So then I took my time. Oh what a thing to've done. And it was all yellow. Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones. Turn into something beautiful. D'you know? You know I love you so. You know I love you so. I swam across. I jumped across for you. Oh what a thing to do. 'Cause you were all yellow. I drew a line. I drew a line for you. Oh what a thing to do. And it was all yellow. Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones. Turn into something beautiful. D'you know? For you I bleed myself dry. For you I bleed myself dry. I bleed myself dry. It's true. Look how they shine for you. Look how they shine for you. Look how they shine. Look how they shine for you. Look how they shine for you. Look how they shine. Look at the stars"
you matter to me (feat. jason mraz),"I could find the whole meaning of life in those sad eyes. They've seen things that you never quite say, but I hear. Come out of hiding, I'm right here beside you. And I'll stay there as long as you let me. Because you matter to me. Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody. You matter to me. I promise you do, you, you matter too. I promise you do, you see?. You matter to me. It's addictive the minute you let yourself think. The things that I say just might matter to someone. All of this time I've been keeping my mind on the running away. And for the first time I think I'd consider the stay. Because you matter to me. Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody. You matter to me. I promise you do, you, you matter too. I promise you do, you see?. You matter to me. And you matter to me. Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody. You matter to me. I promise you do, you. (Out of hiding I'm right here beside you). You matter too. (As long as you have me). I promise you do, you, you matter too. (Out of hiding I'm right here beside you). I promise you do, you, you matter too. (I do, I promise you do, you matter to me). I promise you do, you see. You matter to me"
