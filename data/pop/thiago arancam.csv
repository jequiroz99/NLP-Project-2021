hallelujah,"I heard there was a secret chord. That David played and it pleased the Lord. But you don't really care for music, do you?. Well it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth. The minor fall and the major lift. The baffled king composing Hallelujah. Hallelujah [x4]. Your faith was strong but you needed proof. You saw her bathing on the roof. Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you. She tied you to her kitchen chair. She broke your throne and she cut your hair. And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah. Hallelujah [x4]. Maybe there's a God above. All I've ever learned from love. Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you. And it's not a cry that you hear at night. It's not somebody who's seen the light. It's a cold and it's a broken. Hallelujah. Hallelujah [x4]. Hallelujah [x4]"

the music of the night,"Night-time sharpens. Heightens each sensation. Darkness stirs. And awakes the imagination. Silently the senses. Abandon their defenses. Slowly, gently. Night unfurls its splendour. Grasp it, sense it. Tremulous and tender. Turn your face away. From the garish light of day. Turn your thoughts away. From cold, unfeeling light. And listen to. The music of the night. Close your eyes. And surrender to your. Darkest dreams!. Purge your thoughts. Of the life. You knew before!. Close your eyes. Let your spirit. Start to soar!. And you'll live. As you've never. Lived before. Softly, deftly. Music shall caress you. Hear it, feel it. Secretly possess you. Open up your mind. Let your fantasies unwind. In this darkness that. You know you cannot fight. The darkness of. The music of the night. Let your mind. Start a journey through a. Strange, new world!. Leave all thoughts. Of the life. You knew before!. Let your soul. Take you where you. Long to be!. Only then. Can you belong. To me. Floating, falling. Sweet intoxication!. Touch me, trust me. Savour each sensation!. Let the dream begin. Let your darker side give in. To the power of. The music that I write. The power of. The music of the night. You alone. Can make my song take flight. Help me make. The music of the night"
