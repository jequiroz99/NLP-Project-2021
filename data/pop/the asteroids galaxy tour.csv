navigator,"I'm standing in the moonlight, like a shadow, on a graveyard. Lonely after midnight, with an arrow, through my heart. I wanna feel the starshine, let em' sparkle, on my pale skin. I wanna climb up so high, let my hair blow, in the wind. I want to navigate through your soul. Through apocalyptic black holes. Want to navigate through your soul, your soul. Oh, seize the day, get swept away. Oh, face your fear, and come my way. Oh, seize the day, get swept away. Oh, face your fear, and come my way, it's never too late. Never too late. Underneath the dark light, there's a tribal celebration. Trying hard to reach out, for the magic sensation. Like hummingbirds of the night they're singing at the sorrow. They take me to the far side, to the land of the apollo. I want to navigate through your soul. Through apocalyptic black holes. Want to navigate through your soul, your soul. Oh, seize the day, get swept away. Oh, face your fear, and come my way. Oh, seize the day, get swept away. Oh, face your fear, and come my way. It's never too late. Never too late"

push the envelope,"Anyway you're Ok, I'm away to the day. When you won't pray for a better day. Never say 'stay wide awake', be always late. For devil's sake smile when you're afraid.

the golden age,"I wished I lived in the golden age. Giving it up on the broadway stage. Hang with the rats and smoke cigars. Have a break with Frank and count the stars.
