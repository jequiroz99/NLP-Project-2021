Think that shit's got pneumonia"". I told her, ""Bitch now, just hold up"". That's why rap needs a doctor. A genre slip, known to swole up. It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis.

And you might wanna decide to cheat. 'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peep. Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?. Even if you're fire-breathing, shit you can say to inspire heat. If you wrapped your entire meat pad up in a dryer sheet. And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it. Better not use me as your topic. anybody who brings me up, duck it. Let me keep it one hundred. two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion. The queen and her husband. last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah. [Chorus: Labrinth]. Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (oh, oh). Whatever you want, you can have from me (oh, oh). I want your love, just lead me on. Won't give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey. 'Cause I'm a sucker for ya.

fly (feat. rihanna),"[Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. I wish today it will rain all day.

Maybe that is why I chase strangers away. They got their guns out aiming at me. But I become near when they aiming at me. Me, me, me against them. Me against enemies, me against friends. Somehow they both seem to become one. A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood. They start coming and I start rising. Must be surprising, I'm just summising. Win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher. More fire. [Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. Everybody wanna try to box me in. Suffocating everytime it locks me in. Paint they own pictures than they crop me in. But I will remain where the top begins. Cause I am not a word, I am not a line. I am not a girl that can every be defined. I am not fly, I am levitation. I represent an entire generation. I hear the criticism loud and clear. That is how I know that the time is near. So we become alive in a time of fear. And I aint got no muthaf-cking time to spare. Cry my eyes out for days upon days. Such a heavy burden placed upon me.

Niggas ain't ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti. Mario Andretti, money comin' fast. My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass. I could never be a racist,. wake up every morning just to count white faces. Neo in the Matrix, glorious as Morpheus. Employed all warriors, I'm mean as a scorpion, Dr. Kevorkian. [Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]. Everytime I come you gotta know a nigga comin'. Get a lot of money when I'm in the buildin'. And I come and say there ain't nobody better, better, better. Uh-huh, Okay. Niggas know I got you when I hit you with the pitter-patter. Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter-chatter. Niggas know there ain't nobody, better, better, better. I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut. So sick when I come and hit em in the gut. You will crown me king (no matter what!). Ok let's shine my friend. Get up on my grind again.

all things go,"Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent. I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since. I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent. Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant. Cherish these nights, cherish these people. Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel. And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful. As long as 7 years from now. I'm taking my daughter to preschool. Cherish these days, man do they go quick. Just yesterday, I swear it was '06. Ten years ago, that's when you proposed. I look down, yes I suppose. All things go, all things go. All things go, all things go. I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone. While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls. So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong. Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young. We keep goin', we go, we go, we go. We wake back up and do it all again. We know, we know, say fuck the world. We ridin' til the end. When all is said and done, look at what we've become. I just want you to know, that I did it for you. I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence. His sister said he wanted to stay with me. But I didn't invite him. Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?. Cause since I got fame. They don't act the same. Even though they know that I love him. Family ties broken before me. Niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me. And that's the reflection of me. Yes I get it, I get it, it was all me. I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes. The last day he saw me. All things go, all things go. All things go, all things go. I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone. While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls. So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong. Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young. We keep goin', we go, we go, we go. We wake back up and do it all again. We know, we know, say fuck the world. We ridin' til the end. When all is said and done, look at what we've become. I just want you to know, that I did it for you. Let me make this clear I'm not difficult. I'm just about my business. I'm not into fake industry parties. And fake agendas. Rock with people for how they make me feel. Not what they give me. Even the ones that hurt me the most. I still show forgiveness. I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact. I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that. She never understands, why I'm so overprotective. The more I work, the more I feel like. Somehow they're neglected. I want 'Caiah to go to college. Just to say ""We did it! "". My child with Aaron. Would've have been sixteen, any minute. So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them. It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him. And I know Jelani will always love me. And I'll always love him. And I'm just his little sister. Not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him. Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint. Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint. All things go, all things go. All things go, all things go"

But I'm a die tryin and when I'm done cryin. Grab the iron. And black out like I'm retiring. Nightmares of you killing my mother. The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers. N shoulda thrown a book at, ch'you cause I hate you so. much that it burn when I look at ch'you. Chorus x2. May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic my. voice projected my life reflected.

Please baby forgive me, mommy was young, mommy was to. busy tryna have fun now I pat myself on the back for. sending you back cause god knows I was better than. that to conceive then leave you the concept alone. seems evil I'm trapped in my concience. I adhear to the nonsense listened to people who told. me I wasn't ready for you. But how the fuck would they know wat I was ready to. do. And of course it wasn't your fault"

bed of lies (feat. skylar grey),"[Skylar Grey]. Do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. And I knew better than to look in your eyes. They only pretend you would be mine. And you know how you made me believe. You had me caught in every web that you weaved. But do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. [Nicki Minaj]. You could never make eye contact. Everything you got was based off of my contacts. You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat. Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap. You was caught up in the rush. And you was caught up in the thrill of it. You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it. Put you in the crib. And you ain't never pay a bill in it. I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it. I told baby hit you. I said this nigga buggin'. Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public. Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating. Overdosin', no more coastin'. No more toastin' over oceans. They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone. They say that your darkest hour. Come before your dawn. But there was something. That I should've asked all along. I'mma ask on the song. [Skylar Grey]. Do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. And I knew better than to look in your eyes. They only pretend you would be mine. And you know how you made me believe. You had me caught in every web that you weaved. But do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. [Nicki Minaj]. I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes. You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies. I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace. But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate. I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend. What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend. When the tears roll down. It's like you ain't even notice 'em. If you had a heart. I was hoping that you would show it some. What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?. I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me. I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony. This ain't 'How to be a player'. You ain't Bill Bellamy. They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone. They say that your darkest hour. Come before your dawn. But there was something that. I should've asked, all along. I'mma ask on the song. [Skylar Grey]. So does she know I've been in that bed before?. A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth. If I was just another girl. Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you. There's one thing I need to know. So call me when you're not so busy. Just thinking of yourself. Do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. And I knew better than to look in your eyes. They only pretend you would be mine. And you know how you made me believe. You had me caught in every web that you weaved. But do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies"

Young girls always lookin' for a soulmate. But I shoulda listened to what momma told me. Furry moon boots, shades Dita. Too high to give a shit about PETA. Sativa so strong I'm not blinkin'. What in the world was I thinkin'?. New day, new money to be made. New things for them to imitate. I'm a fuckin' black barbie. Pretty face, perfect body. Pink seats in the 'Rari. Always fuck him like I'm sorry. Who the fuck is gon' protect her?. If I really gotta check her. Peter Piper picked a pepper. And my cake is triple decker. No Flex Zone, No Flex Zone. (Yeah, oh no, no, no, no) No Flex Zone. I see these silly nigga's flexin', it's a no zone. You gon' be floatin' in dem rivers. Like you know Joan. Island girl, Donald Trump want me go home. Still pull up with my wrist lookin' like a snowcone. She said she got a hit record, I said ""OOh shit! "". Picked up my phone cause I had to call ""Bullshit! "". These bitches havin' nightmares of my new shit. These bitches pussy and they don't ever do shit. Hahaha, get it? Douche it-... hahahahahahaha. Half a mili on the Maybach Pullman, bought it.

Bitches can't rap for shit, I'mma send 'em some tips. All these bitches is my sons, should be suckin' my tits. (Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no). Now usually I don't do this, I'm Popeye, she's Brutus. Usually I'm a Christian but this peace is Buddhist. All of my niggas draw but none of them Cartoonists. Usually I'm the baddest, usually I'm the cutest. Usually I'm the flyest. Usually you're the stewardess. And we ain't playin' ball but usually its some shooters. Are these bitches drunk? These bitches ain't lucid. Go against the queen your career will be elusive. Where your plaques? Where them stocks?. Word to NASDAQ. Bitches ass-back. They was never in my tax-brack. (Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no). [Swae Lee]. That girl is a real crowd pleaser. Small world, all her friends know of me. Young bull living like an old geezer. Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly. Frat girls still tryna get even. Haters mad for whatever reason. Smoke in the air, binge drinking. They lose it when the DJ drops the needle"

born to be wild,"I was just a player in the game of love. Till she came and turned my tables around. Stacking up mi chips lining up all mi cards. Still they all came tumbling down. Man I think I might, think I might make her the one. Take them stealin' me up on the run. She hits me like a shot gun, I'm done. If love is the beat she's the stead of my drum. Fly me away, the kingdom come. She got me going, daram-dam-daram-dam. Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild. Oh no, oh no, till love shot me down. I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love. I'm sayin, Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild. Oh no, oh no till you came around.

"champion (feat. nas, drake, young jeezy)","Mmm.. This is celebration, this is levetation. Look at how you winnin now, this took dedication. This is meditation, higher education. This the official competitor elimination. I was takin trips with Web to move weight,. Came back to queens then hit up a new state. Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math. Bitches ain't have cut up crack up in the stash. 50 cent italian, icy flow. It's that run and get a dollar for a ice cream cone. Cuz they killed my little cousin Nicholas. But my memory's only happy images. This is for the hood, this is for the kids. This is for the single mothers, niggas doin biz. This one is for TT, Tweety, Viola, Shariki. Candice, Timby, Lauren, Iesha.. It's a celebration. Put it up for the ghetto. It's times like these. They know who we are by now. They know who we are.. Champion, a champion.. (Drake).

Cuz I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game,. they know. Makin' hits in 3 acre cribs. Cookin' up tryna eat nigga steak and ribs. I made a couple stars outta basic chicks.

What chu call a crib in the sky? play high. Half a mil in 3 weeks, yall did it like a champ. Mama taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps. Wait a minute, every body pause for the photo. Somebody tell these loco ain't niggas, I'm global. Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne goin. What I gotta do to get this coconut flowin. Don't let me in son, hundred bottles of the ace.

I'm back to thuggin bitches that can make it. and kiss other bitches,. My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother's sister. I just aspire, desire to be different.

Waitin list just to hear me or witness the greatness. Loud laughter while writin my next chapter. Fast cash life, happily ever after. Champions"
changed it (feat. lil wayne),"[verse 1: lil wayne]. I did it for everybody out here on their own. I did it for the ones who walk a mile in them cages. And never tell me no. Come get me when I fall. And tell me when I'm wrong. But you should know I bought 'em. I changed it, I changed it. They say that shit the same. It ain't the same, though. I changed it, I changed it. [chorus: lil wayne]. Oh my god, I changed it. Oh my god, they on the same shit. Oh my god, I changed it. Oh my god, they still on the same shit. You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'.

The big 3 on the court, bitch hit them bleachers. I don't wanna have to break bad like it screeches. A bitch out in atlanta eating them peaches. A bitch got more bars than where big meech is. No, you can't bone it, nigga, ain't no lisa here. She gon' dread this and nicki like lisa hair. I buy, lil nigga, ain't no leaser here. The bitch gambled her career. Now it's gon' be severe. I ain't just be watchin' bitches pitfalls. Stop doin' pills, but bitch don't withdrawals. I am in my mission rockin' pink drawers. I leveled up, bitch, I switch flows. Mj to the teens. I am billie jean and them bitches my sons. I'm doin' it for fun, I am the first number. Tell them bitches I won. This hoe gettin' slick. So I put on gym shoes and extended my run. Mj, game 6, jackson, tyson. [pre-chorus: nicki minaj]. Quiet dog, my phone changed up. I'm icin' all my barbie chains up. And when I come, get your change cup. These bum bitches never change up.

No more seein' visions, I changed it. Young money shit, mula gang shit. Different hoes doing the same shit. Poppin' pills, we don't know where the pain went. Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean. Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen. Yeah, carter time, I put bling on for the time. She changed her ringtone to one of mine. I changed 23s to 45s. Lil tune like autotune. I get in her throat and she harmonize. She get the d and ooh la la la. And when she leave, I kumbaya. I whip it up with the left hand. I don't fuck with the yes man. I get younger by the second. I don't rust like def jam. It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team. Have sex on my jet ski. Text my chef, told 'em ""let's beef"". Changing girls, change is fine. She don't like girls, change her mind. Change the world, change my line. Never ever change my slimes. Changing looks, changing lies. Changing skies, changing lanes. Me, minaj, and champagne changed the game. And y'all chump change. I'm just sayin'. [pre-chorus: nicki minaj]. Quiet dog, my phone changed up. I'm icin' all my barbie chains up. And when I come, get your change cut. These bum bitches never change up. [chorus: lil wayne]. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they still on the same. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they still on the same. You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'. You end up everywhere you say you wasn't. Is that your boyfriend?. Why you say that's your cousin?. I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they on the same. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they still on the same. You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'. You end up everywhere you say you wasn't. Is that your boyfriend?. Why you say that's your cousin?. I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me. [outro: lil wayne]. Mula, mula gang. Mula, mula gang.

Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show. So I just deaded you, left you in all black. But dear old Nicki, please call back. Chorus. You told me you'd come when I needed you. And you said it so sweetly I believed you. But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you. But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that. Verse 2.

They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess. I had to make them changes, I hoped you understood. You see for every bad, I did a ton of good. But you was underground and I was main stream. I live the life now that we would daydream. My only wish is you come enjoy it with me. Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me. The money came yeah, tripled and quadrupled it. But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit. And it's still fuck the media. They ridiculed you, never believed in ya. They just debted you, left you in all black.

easy,"(""HOLIDAY SEASON!!""). [Gucci Mane]. Hot damn it it's a miracle, please adjust the temperature. I switched up the interior in my European 50. Damn Gucci lyrical, naw I ain't lyrical.

Yellow chain look like the moon and my old school is maroon. VROOM! Hear it ert-ert when it skrrt. 26's on the skirts, in a bird, with a flirt. You can jerk, I got twerk, I keep work, in my birds.

I'm such a girl, I'm such a girly girl. I'm sippin on my milkshake with the swirly swirl. Excuse me mister put some cherries in my cups. I take my shirt off and watch the boys go nuts. The boys go nut, the boy-boys go nuts. All the dope boys all the boys wanna fuck. My niqqa S Beezy, keep my wrist breezy. Why would I go hard when this shit is so easy?. [Chorus]. [Rocko]. Hold up bitch!. Man I done stepped my swag up, don't fly commercial I'm private. Step my rank up, so SALUTE you fuckin private. 'Member the days I used to keep my comb, in my pocket?.

encore 07,"Thank you. Thank you for coming out tonight. Ladies and gentle men. I am the president of Dirty Money Records. (what the hell are you waiting for). New York City (chyea). . Who you know fresher than Nick. Riddle me that. Mammi you itty bitty. Can't mirror me back. Everybody gon see where I'm lyrically at. Used to hate Nicki now they giving me dap. I live and I learn but I wait my turn. I'm always on the run got weight to burn. Ease off the gas then I make a turn. Three off the pass they don't play like her. Why I can't just be ill. Why when they see me bitches gotta go ""ew"". Why my lil nigga still gotta sell krills. Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal (chea). The rain and the pain. I done paid my dues. I'm ready for da game. I done laced my shoes. Everything I say believe I'm gon do. Came out the coop petite with tall boots. Can I get a encore I know you want more. I know you sick of all them girls. They're such a bore. But it's my time I need ya'll to roar. Its my time I need ya'll to roar. (what the hell are you waiting for). After me there shall be no more. It's my time I need ya'll to roar. (what the hell are you waiting for). Look what you made me do. Look what I made for you. Knew when I paid my dues. That I would aim for you. Straight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems. The only thing they know is that I push a beam. All they sees a pretty face. How I ride the base. So I put my hoodie down just to hide my face. They don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide. Told me keep my cares inside, it's merely pride. Like my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop. Said the next time I seen her she would be in a box (damn). She was right, she was dead right. How was I to know that would be her last night (last night). If I could turn back the time. Dear god, somehow could you press rewind. Wont come when I call, but he just in time. So I come when he call, like I'm next in line. When you got something good why the devil gotta ruin it. Guess she never know I be the best bitch doin it. (Tired of being what you want me to be. Feeling so faithless lost under the surface. Don't know what you're expecting of me. Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes. Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow. Every step that I take is another mistake to you. Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow. And every second I waste is more than I can take. I've become so numb I can't feel you there. I've become so tired so much more aware. I'm becoming this all I want to do. As be more like me and be less like you. I've become so numb). Can I get a encore I know you want more. (I've become so numb). But it's my time I need ya'll to roar. It's my time I need ya'll to roar"

fly (feat. rihanna),"[Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. I wish today it will rain all day. Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away. Trying to forgive you for abandoning me. Praying but I think I'm still an angel away. Angel away, yeah strange in a way. Maybe that is why I chase strangers away. They got their guns out aiming at me. But I become near when they aiming at me. Me, me, me against them. Me against enemies, me against friends. Somehow they both seem to become one. A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood. They start coming and I start rising. Must be surprising, I'm just summising. Win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher. More fire. [Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. Everybody wanna try to box me in. Suffocating everytime it locks me in. Paint they own pictures than they crop me in. But I will remain where the top begins. Cause I am not a word, I am not a line. I am not a girl that can every be defined. I am not fly, I am levitation. I represent an entire generation. I hear the criticism loud and clear. That is how I know that the time is near. So we become alive in a time of fear. And I aint got no muthaf-cking time to spare. Cry my eyes out for days upon days. Such a heavy burden placed upon me. But when you go hard your nay's become yay's. Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's. [Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj - Bridge]. Get ready for it. Get ready for it. Get ready for it. I came to win. Get ready for it. Get ready for it. I came to win. [Rihanna - Chorus]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly"

here i am,"VERSE 1. Why is that that you could only see the worst in me?. I swear sometimes I feel like it nurtures me. But to keep it all real is kinda hurtin‚Äô me. I could say I‚Äôm done with it, but it lurks in me. So I‚Äôm a just tell myself that it works for me. Take a real long drive in the Mer-ce-des. And I might pop a couple of them per-ca-ces. Yeah that‚Äôll make me transform to Hercules. CHORUS. (I love who I am). Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am. Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am. Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am. VERSE 2. I swear to God, man, everything in life is old. And the only thing that change is the price of gold. Even in the afterlife I‚Äôm a fight your soul. Cause the second time around I‚Äôll be twice as grown. So do you take me to be who I am?. To have and to hold till death do us part. Cause if not it‚Äôs just best we both part. Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?. You got me thinkin‚Äô twice to just breathe. Then you say I won‚Äôt survive if I leave. But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve. I no longer need your attention, at ease. It‚Äôs a joke, it‚Äôs a game,. Why am I still keeping score?. I‚Äôm in pain, I‚Äôm ashamed.

If I'da known you was fake I'da laced your steak. Strick nine one time in your welchs grape. Quit lying. Why you lying. I watched the tape. Now get up out my dressing room. Give me some f'ing room. Go get your mind right and take it as a lesson learned. Just like usher nigga you gon have to let it burn. To the left and I ain't talkin about jigga girl. [CHORUS:]. Oh now you wanna be with me. But you can't be with me. Boy leave me alone. You know you did me wrong. So I gotta letcha go. If you wanted me in your life. You shoulda treated me right. Boy leave me alone.

After sexing on the floor. Baby I know you need me, like I need you. But I'm not the one you wanna love. [Hook: August Alsina]. So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me. Loving ain't the same with a nigga like. You use to them but ain't no loving me. I hear what you would say and girl it's clear to see. You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me. You probably go insane with a nigga like me. Let's just party till we can't, ain't no loving me. And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me. So don't come looking for love. Oh, no love [x9]. (Don't come looking for love). Oh, no love [x9]. [Verse 2: August Alsina]. Shawty if you looking for somebody tryna settle down. Probably won't be around nah baby.

Put this in your speakers, you a certified creeper. When you see a country bitch laying out at the beach. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaaa). And when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaaa). I was six years old when I started creeping. My parents took it to their room and I started peeping. Can you imagine their surprise when they lifted their heads. And saw my little ass creeping at the foot of the bed. And they knew I was a creep since the day I was born. Get popping out of momma like some chemical(?). And the doctor saw my head and he starting freaking. Cause I came clean and I came out creeping. [Nicki Minaj]. When I was a girl, I creeped in the boys locker room. Hide deep inside, it was my little creep stalker room. As they dis-robed I was oogling and oggling. Little did they know that for me they was modelling. And I would laugh ha ha ha ha ha haha. And they would dance la la la la lalala-laaa. So pop pop pop your peepers and turn out your sneakers. Don't sleep, come and get ya creep on with me. Go get ya sweating off ya bride at her wedding. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaaa). [Nicki Minaj]. But when you sneek into a wake and. You see a beefcake. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaa). When the judge is a hottie and you can't control ya body. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaa). [Nicki Minaj]. So get ya knees flexin' and your arms T-rexin'. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaa). [John Waters]. And don't forget to smile."

fly (feat. rihanna),"[Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. I wish today it will rain all day.

Maybe that is why I chase strangers away. They got their guns out aiming at me. But I become near when they aiming at me. Me, me, me against them. Me against enemies, me against friends.

Win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher. More fire. [Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. Everybody wanna try to box me in. Suffocating everytime it locks me in. Paint they own pictures than they crop me in. But I will remain where the top begins. Cause I am not a word, I am not a line. I am not a girl that can every be defined. I am not fly, I am levitation. I represent an entire generation. I hear the criticism loud and clear. That is how I know that the time is near. So we become alive in a time of fear. And I aint got no muthaf-cking time to spare. Cry my eyes out for days upon days. Such a heavy burden placed upon me.

Niggas ain't ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti. Mario Andretti, money comin' fast. My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass. I could never be a racist,. wake up every morning just to count white faces. Neo in the Matrix, glorious as Morpheus. Employed all warriors, I'm mean as a scorpion, Dr. Kevorkian. [Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]. Everytime I come you gotta know a nigga comin'. Get a lot of money when I'm in the buildin'. And I come and say there ain't nobody better, better, better. Uh-huh, Okay. Niggas know I got you when I hit you with the pitter-patter. Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter-chatter. Niggas know there ain't nobody, better, better, better. I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut. So sick when I come and hit em in the gut. You will crown me king (no matter what!). Ok let's shine my friend. Get up on my grind again.

all things go,"Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent. I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since. I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent. Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant. Cherish these nights, cherish these people. Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel. And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful. As long as 7 years from now. I'm taking my daughter to preschool. Cherish these days, man do they go quick. Just yesterday, I swear it was '06. Ten years ago, that's when you proposed. I look down, yes I suppose. All things go, all things go. All things go, all things go. I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone. While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls. So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong. Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young. We keep goin', we go, we go, we go. We wake back up and do it all again. We know, we know, say fuck the world. We ridin' til the end. When all is said and done, look at what we've become. I just want you to know, that I did it for you. I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence. His sister said he wanted to stay with me. But I didn't invite him. Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?. Cause since I got fame. They don't act the same. Even though they know that I love him. Family ties broken before me. Niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me. And that's the reflection of me. Yes I get it, I get it, it was all me. I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes. The last day he saw me. All things go, all things go. All things go, all things go. I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone. While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls. So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong. Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young. We keep goin', we go, we go, we go. We wake back up and do it all again. We know, we know, say fuck the world. We ridin' til the end. When all is said and done, look at what we've become. I just want you to know, that I did it for you. Let me make this clear I'm not difficult. I'm just about my business. I'm not into fake industry parties. And fake agendas. Rock with people for how they make me feel. Not what they give me. Even the ones that hurt me the most. I still show forgiveness. I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact. I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that. She never understands, why I'm so overprotective. The more I work, the more I feel like. Somehow they're neglected. I want 'Caiah to go to college. Just to say ""We did it! "". My child with Aaron. Would've have been sixteen, any minute. So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them. It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him. And I know Jelani will always love me. And I'll always love him. And I'm just his little sister. Not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him. Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint. Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint. All things go, all things go. All things go, all things go"

She told me that I had talent. Got on her knees and prayed for me when I started. being violent. She saw something in me that, until this day I don't. know if I could be dat. But I'm a die tryin and when I'm done cryin. Grab the iron. And black out like I'm retiring. Nightmares of you killing my mother. The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers. N shoulda thrown a book at, ch'you cause I hate you so. much that it burn when I look at ch'you. Chorus x2. May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic my. voice projected my life reflected.

May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic my. voice projected my life reflected. Please baby forgive me, mommy was young, mommy was to. busy tryna have fun now I pat myself on the back for. sending you back cause god knows I was better than. that to conceive then leave you the concept alone. seems evil I'm trapped in my concience. I adhear to the nonsense listened to people who told. me I wasn't ready for you. But how the fuck would they know wat I was ready to. do. And of course it wasn't your fault"

bed of lies (feat. skylar grey),"[Skylar Grey]. Do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. And I knew better than to look in your eyes. They only pretend you would be mine. And you know how you made me believe. You had me caught in every web that you weaved. But do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. [Nicki Minaj]. You could never make eye contact. Everything you got was based off of my contacts. You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat. Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap. You was caught up in the rush. And you was caught up in the thrill of it. You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it. Put you in the crib. And you ain't never pay a bill in it. I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it. I told baby hit you. I said this nigga buggin'. Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public. Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating. Overdosin', no more coastin'. No more toastin' over oceans. They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone. They say that your darkest hour. Come before your dawn. But there was something. That I should've asked all along. I'mma ask on the song. [Skylar Grey]. Do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. And I knew better than to look in your eyes. They only pretend you would be mine. And you know how you made me believe. You had me caught in every web that you weaved. But do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. [Nicki Minaj]. I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes. You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies. I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace. But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate. I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend. What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend. When the tears roll down. It's like you ain't even notice 'em. If you had a heart. I was hoping that you would show it some. What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?. I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me. I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony. This ain't 'How to be a player'. You ain't Bill Bellamy. They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone. They say that your darkest hour. Come before your dawn. But there was something that. I should've asked, all along. I'mma ask on the song. [Skylar Grey]. So does she know I've been in that bed before?. A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth. If I was just another girl. Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you. There's one thing I need to know. So call me when you're not so busy. Just thinking of yourself. Do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. And I knew better than to look in your eyes. They only pretend you would be mine. And you know how you made me believe. You had me caught in every web that you weaved. But do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies"

Always fuck him like I'm sorry. Who the fuck is gon' protect her?. If I really gotta check her. Peter Piper picked a pepper. And my cake is triple decker. No Flex Zone, No Flex Zone. (Yeah, oh no, no, no, no) No Flex Zone. I see these silly nigga's flexin', it's a no zone. You gon' be floatin' in dem rivers. Like you know Joan. Island girl, Donald Trump want me go home. Still pull up with my wrist lookin' like a snowcone. She said she got a hit record, I said ""OOh shit! "". Picked up my phone cause I had to call ""Bullshit! "". These bitches havin' nightmares of my new shit. These bitches pussy and they don't ever do shit. Hahaha, get it? Douche it-... hahahahahahaha. Half a mili on the Maybach Pullman, bought it. Now I'm prayin' all my foreigns don't get deported. Niggas love me so much they be sendin' me gifts. And these clown niggas actin'. I'mma send 'em some skits. Bitches can't rap for shit, I'mma send 'em some tips. All these bitches is my sons, should be suckin' my tits. (Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no). Now usually I don't do this, I'm Popeye, she's Brutus. Usually I'm a Christian but this peace is Buddhist. All of my niggas draw but none of them Cartoonists. Usually I'm the baddest, usually I'm the cutest. Usually I'm the flyest. Usually you're the stewardess. And we ain't playin' ball but usually its some shooters. Are these bitches drunk? These bitches ain't lucid. Go against the queen your career will be elusive. Where your plaques? Where them stocks?. Word to NASDAQ. Bitches ass-back. They was never in my tax-brack. (Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no). [Swae Lee]. That girl is a real crowd pleaser. Small world, all her friends know of me. Young bull living like an old geezer. Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly. Frat girls still tryna get even. Haters mad for whatever reason. Smoke in the air, binge drinking. They lose it when the DJ drops the needle"

born to be wild,"I was just a player in the game of love. Till she came and turned my tables around. Stacking up mi chips lining up all mi cards. Still they all came tumbling down. Man I think I might, think I might make her the one. Take them stealin' me up on the run. She hits me like a shot gun, I'm done. If love is the beat she's the stead of my drum. Fly me away, the kingdom come. She got me going, daram-dam-daram-dam. Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild. Oh no, oh no, till love shot me down. I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love. I'm sayin, Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild. Oh no, oh no till you came around. I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love. Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild. Oooohh I'm blown away, uh whoa, I'm blown away. Love was just a word till I bought me a ballah. Oh you everything for holding me down. I'm tellin' all my homies that I'mma find me a queen. In the jungle so you facing the crowd. Man I think I might, think I might make her the one. Take them stealin me up on the run. She hits me like a shot gun, I'm done. If love is the beat she's the stead of my drum. Fly me away, the kingdom come. She got me going, daram-dam-daram-dam.

I be known to eat these raps coco like chef Ramsey. Mission accomplished, you're my accomplice. Cover oh Vogue I'mma go topless. I'mma go bunkass I'mma go crazy. I'mma get reckless and have a baby.

"champion (feat. nas, drake, young jeezy)","Mmm.. This is celebration, this is levetation. Look at how you winnin now, this took dedication. This is meditation, higher education. This the official competitor elimination. I was takin trips with Web to move weight,. Came back to queens then hit up a new state. Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math. Bitches ain't have cut up crack up in the stash. 50 cent italian, icy flow. It's that run and get a dollar for a ice cream cone. Cuz they killed my little cousin Nicholas. But my memory's only happy images. This is for the hood, this is for the kids. This is for the single mothers, niggas doin biz. This one is for TT, Tweety, Viola, Shariki. Candice, Timby, Lauren, Iesha.. It's a celebration. Put it up for the ghetto. It's times like these. They know who we are by now. They know who we are.. Champion, a champion.. (Drake). Yeah, okay, we made it to america. I remember when I used to stay with erica. Label transferred 20 million to comerica. Fuckin terrabus got me actin out of character.

Cuz I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game,. they know. Makin' hits in 3 acre cribs. Cookin' up tryna eat nigga steak and ribs. I made a couple stars outta basic chicks.

What chu call a crib in the sky? play high. Half a mil in 3 weeks, yall did it like a champ. Mama taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps. Wait a minute, every body pause for the photo. Somebody tell these loco ain't niggas, I'm global. Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne goin. What I gotta do to get this coconut flowin. Don't let me in son, hundred bottles of the ace. Lemme in son, go money cases in my place let's celebrate. It's a celebration. Put it up for the ghetto. It's times like these. They know who we are by now. They know who we are..

This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ.. Cuz that's where a nigga fuck, murder on replay. My 24th bday, I'm sailin to Bimini. You can see me on a yacht blastin Pac, little nah, I ain't greedy. I'm back to thuggin bitches that can make it. and kiss other bitches,. My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother's sister. I just aspire, desire to be different. My 10 year old plan just one year til finish. My list went like this: first thing to sever,. The difference in pussy white black latin or other. Here's a man who clearly isn't basic,. Waitin list just to hear me or witness the greatness. Loud laughter while writin my next chapter. Fast cash life, happily ever after. Champions"
changed it (feat. lil wayne),"[verse 1: lil wayne]. I did it for everybody out here on their own. I did it for the ones who walk a mile in them cages. And never tell me no. Come get me when I fall. And tell me when I'm wrong. But you should know I bought 'em. I changed it, I changed it. They say that shit the same. It ain't the same, though. I changed it, I changed it. [chorus: lil wayne]. Oh my god, I changed it. Oh my god, they on the same shit. Oh my god, I changed it. Oh my god, they still on the same shit. You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'. You end up everywhere you say you wasn't. Is that your boyfriend?. Why you say that's your cousin?. I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me. [verse 2: nicki minaj]. The big 3 on the court, bitch hit them bleachers. I don't wanna have to break bad like it screeches. A bitch out in atlanta eating them peaches. A bitch got more bars than where big meech is. No, you can't bone it, nigga, ain't no lisa here. She gon' dread this and nicki like lisa hair. I buy, lil nigga, ain't no leaser here. The bitch gambled her career. Now it's gon' be severe. I ain't just be watchin' bitches pitfalls. Stop doin' pills, but bitch don't withdrawals. I am in my mission rockin' pink drawers. I leveled up, bitch, I switch flows. Mj to the teens. I am billie jean and them bitches my sons. I'm doin' it for fun, I am the first number. Tell them bitches I won. This hoe gettin' slick. So I put on gym shoes and extended my run. Mj, game 6, jackson, tyson. [pre-chorus: nicki minaj]. Quiet dog, my phone changed up. I'm icin' all my barbie chains up. And when I come, get your change cup. These bum bitches never change up.

You end up everywhere you say you wasn't. Is that your boyfriend?. Why you say that's your cousin?. I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me. [verse 3: lil wayne]. No more seein' visions, I changed it. Young money shit, mula gang shit. Different hoes doing the same shit. Poppin' pills, we don't know where the pain went. Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean. Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen. Yeah, carter time, I put bling on for the time. She changed her ringtone to one of mine. I changed 23s to 45s. Lil tune like autotune. I get in her throat and she harmonize. She get the d and ooh la la la. And when she leave, I kumbaya. I whip it up with the left hand. I don't fuck with the yes man. I get younger by the second. I don't rust like def jam. It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team. Have sex on my jet ski. Text my chef, told 'em ""let's beef"". Changing girls, change is fine. She don't like girls, change her mind. Change the world, change my line. Never ever change my slimes. Changing looks, changing lies. Changing skies, changing lanes. Me, minaj, and champagne changed the game. And y'all chump change. I'm just sayin'. [pre-chorus: nicki minaj]. Quiet dog, my phone changed up. I'm icin' all my barbie chains up. And when I come, get your change cut. These bum bitches never change up. [chorus: lil wayne]. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they still on the same. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they still on the same. You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'. You end up everywhere you say you wasn't. Is that your boyfriend?. Why you say that's your cousin?. I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they on the same. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they still on the same. You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'. You end up everywhere you say you wasn't. Is that your boyfriend?. Why you say that's your cousin?. I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me. [outro: lil wayne]. Mula, mula gang. Mula, mula gang.

Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show. So I just deaded you, left you in all black. But dear old Nicki, please call back. Chorus. You told me you'd come when I needed you. And you said it so sweetly I believed you. But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you. But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that. Verse 2.

They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess. I had to make them changes, I hoped you understood. You see for every bad, I did a ton of good. But you was underground and I was main stream. I live the life now that we would daydream. My only wish is you come enjoy it with me. Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me. The money came yeah, tripled and quadrupled it. But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit. And it's still fuck the media. They ridiculed you, never believed in ya. They just debted you, left you in all black.

I'm such a girl, I'm such a girly girl. I'm sippin on my milkshake with the swirly swirl. Excuse me mister put some cherries in my cups. I take my shirt off and watch the boys go nuts. The boys go nut, the boy-boys go nuts. All the dope boys all the boys wanna fuck. My niqqa S Beezy, keep my wrist breezy. Why would I go hard when this shit is so easy?. [Chorus]. [Rocko]. Hold up bitch!. Man I done stepped my swag up, don't fly commercial I'm private. Step my rank up, so SALUTE you fuckin private. 'Member the days I used to keep my comb, in my pocket?.

encore 07,"Thank you. Thank you for coming out tonight. Ladies and gentle men. I am the president of Dirty Money Records. (what the hell are you waiting for). New York City (chyea). . Who you know fresher than Nick. Riddle me that. Mammi you itty bitty. Can't mirror me back. Everybody gon see where I'm lyrically at. Used to hate Nicki now they giving me dap. I live and I learn but I wait my turn. I'm always on the run got weight to burn. Ease off the gas then I make a turn. Three off the pass they don't play like her. Why I can't just be ill. Why when they see me bitches gotta go ""ew"". Why my lil nigga still gotta sell krills. Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal (chea). The rain and the pain. I done paid my dues. I'm ready for da game. I done laced my shoes. Everything I say believe I'm gon do. Came out the coop petite with tall boots. Can I get a encore I know you want more. I know you sick of all them girls. They're such a bore. But it's my time I need ya'll to roar. Its my time I need ya'll to roar. (what the hell are you waiting for). After me there shall be no more. It's my time I need ya'll to roar. (what the hell are you waiting for). Look what you made me do. Look what I made for you. Knew when I paid my dues. That I would aim for you. Straight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems. The only thing they know is that I push a beam. All they sees a pretty face. How I ride the base. So I put my hoodie down just to hide my face. They don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide. Told me keep my cares inside, it's merely pride. Like my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop. Said the next time I seen her she would be in a box (damn). She was right, she was dead right. How was I to know that would be her last night (last night). If I could turn back the time. Dear god, somehow could you press rewind. Wont come when I call, but he just in time. So I come when he call, like I'm next in line. When you got something good why the devil gotta ruin it. Guess she never know I be the best bitch doin it. (Tired of being what you want me to be. Feeling so faithless lost under the surface. Don't know what you're expecting of me. Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes. Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow. Every step that I take is another mistake to you. Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow. And every second I waste is more than I can take. I've become so numb I can't feel you there. I've become so tired so much more aware. I'm becoming this all I want to do. As be more like me and be less like you. I've become so numb). Can I get a encore I know you want more. (I've become so numb). But it's my time I need ya'll to roar. It's my time I need ya'll to roar"

fly (feat. rihanna),"[Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. I wish today it will rain all day. Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away. Trying to forgive you for abandoning me. Praying but I think I'm still an angel away. Angel away, yeah strange in a way. Maybe that is why I chase strangers away. They got their guns out aiming at me. But I become near when they aiming at me. Me, me, me against them. Me against enemies, me against friends. Somehow they both seem to become one. A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood. They start coming and I start rising. Must be surprising, I'm just summising. Win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher. More fire. [Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. Everybody wanna try to box me in. Suffocating everytime it locks me in. Paint they own pictures than they crop me in. But I will remain where the top begins. Cause I am not a word, I am not a line. I am not a girl that can every be defined. I am not fly, I am levitation. I represent an entire generation. I hear the criticism loud and clear. That is how I know that the time is near. So we become alive in a time of fear. And I aint got no muthaf-cking time to spare. Cry my eyes out for days upon days. Such a heavy burden placed upon me. But when you go hard your nay's become yay's. Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's. [Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj - Bridge]. Get ready for it. Get ready for it. Get ready for it. I came to win. Get ready for it. Get ready for it. I came to win. [Rihanna - Chorus]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly"

here i am,"VERSE 1. Why is that that you could only see the worst in me?. I swear sometimes I feel like it nurtures me. But to keep it all real is kinda hurtin‚Äô me. I could say I‚Äôm done with it, but it lurks in me. So I‚Äôm a just tell myself that it works for me. Take a real long drive in the Mer-ce-des. And I might pop a couple of them per-ca-ces. Yeah that‚Äôll make me transform to Hercules. CHORUS. (I love who I am). Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am. Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am. Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am. VERSE 2. I swear to God, man, everything in life is old. And the only thing that change is the price of gold. Even in the afterlife I‚Äôm a fight your soul. Cause the second time around I‚Äôll be twice as grown. So do you take me to be who I am?. To have and to hold till death do us part. Cause if not it‚Äôs just best we both part. Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?. You got me thinkin‚Äô twice to just breathe. Then you say I won‚Äôt survive if I leave. But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve. I no longer need your attention, at ease. It‚Äôs a joke, it‚Äôs a game,. Why am I still keeping score?. I‚Äôm in pain, I‚Äôm ashamed. I‚Äôm a woman, hear me roar (2x). Now it‚Äôs a joke, it‚Äôs a game,. Why am i still keeping score?. I‚Äôm in pain, I‚Äôm ashamed. I‚Äôm a woman, hear me roar (2x). CHORUS. (I love who I am).

If I'da known you was fake I'da laced your steak. Strick nine one time in your welchs grape. Quit lying. Why you lying. I watched the tape. Now get up out my dressing room. Give me some f'ing room. Go get your mind right and take it as a lesson learned. Just like usher nigga you gon have to let it burn. To the left and I ain't talkin about jigga girl. [CHORUS:]. Oh now you wanna be with me.

If it's were born any of that sex icons. And we bust down, I don't wanna waste my time. Who the fuck you thought you were. you tryna stung my neck?. Should have put you on blast like a gun whitehead.

Chow out, fow wall, I'm grillin' on 'em. Straight me and the team, eye to the ceilin'. Ridin' in the porsche, fly away from the civic. Know it's a party every evening. Always gettin' complaints from the ceilings. So I got me a crib in the valley. But I'm always still in the city. Out of town, still smoking calli. Throwin' swishas fast as a feeling. Lil' niggas betta get ya updates. Been a whole new game since it came out. Black track need pack, need co-game. But in my own lane, get ya own ride. Nah, no flex, we soarin'.

After sexing on the floor. Baby I know you need me, like I need you. But I'm not the one you wanna love. [Hook: August Alsina]. So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me. Loving ain't the same with a nigga like. You use to them but ain't no loving me. I hear what you would say and girl it's clear to see. You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me. You probably go insane with a nigga like me. Let's just party till we can't, ain't no loving me. And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me. So don't come looking for love. Oh, no love [x9]. (Don't come looking for love). Oh, no love [x9]. [Verse 2: August Alsina]. Shawty if you looking for somebody tryna settle down. Probably won't be around nah baby. You should hit when you tired of playing up in the house. And ain't nobody around. You need that. When you need that late night. We can both make love to the daylight. You got it girl, you got it girl. But you know I can't stay right? Uh nah babe. All I want is you so what you tryna do?. [Hook]. [Refrain: August Alsina]. No love, no love, no love [x6].

I still love, I still love. I still love. Yo, people will love you and support you. When it's beneficial. I'mma forgive, I won't forget but I'mma dead the issue. Soon as you out the niggas' lives. Is when they start to miss you. They see you doing good. Now it's kinda hard to diss you. Niggas be sick. When they remember all the bad they wished you. Niggas be mad. When they can't come and live lavish with you. But I sped off in a Benzi. I see the envy when I'm causing a frenzy. So I pop pills for 'em. Cop cribs in the Hills on 'em. Pills and potions, we're overdosing. I'm angry but I still love you. Pills and potions, we're overdosing. Can't stand it but I still love you. I still love, I still love. I still love, I still love.

Put this in your speakers, you a certified creeper. When you see a country bitch laying out at the beach. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaaa). And when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaaa). I was six years old when I started creeping. My parents took it to their room and I started peeping. Can you imagine their surprise when they lifted their heads. And saw my little ass creeping at the foot of the bed. And they knew I was a creep since the day I was born. Get popping out of momma like some chemical(?). And the doctor saw my head and he starting freaking. Cause I came clean and I came out creeping. [Nicki Minaj]. When I was a girl, I creeped in the boys locker room. Hide deep inside, it was my little creep stalker room. As they dis-robed I was oogling and oggling. Little did they know that for me they was modelling. And I would laugh ha ha ha ha ha haha. And they would dance la la la la lalala-laaa. So pop pop pop your peepers and turn out your sneakers. Don't sleep, come and get ya creep on with me. Go get ya sweating off ya bride at her wedding. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaaa). [Nicki Minaj]. But when you sneek into a wake and. You see a beefcake. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaa). When the judge is a hottie and you can't control ya body. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaa). [Nicki Minaj].

Why'd you have to go so soon. We miss you. Why couldn't you come right home. When you seen the text message in your phone. I should've put my pradas on to come and find you. I could've told you that them niggs was behind you. I couldve told you all about my intuition. I couldve even brought the extra ammunition. But now you've m-m-m-moved so fuck you. Should've known from day one I couldnt trust you. Why'd you have to go so soon. We miss you. Why would they take you from me. Why the doctors could not stop the bleeding. If you in a better place then you free. Well then why cant they make me believe it. You said that you would leave these streets. And I know you didn't mean in a body bag. But now you see you not bullet proof. And Im mad cause you the best that I ever had. Why'd you have to go so soon. We miss you. I'll never love again.
