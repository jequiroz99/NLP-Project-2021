Think that shit's got pneumonia"". I told her, ""Bitch now, just hold up"". That's why rap needs a doctor. A genre slip, known to swole up. It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis.

And you might wanna decide to cheat. 'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peep. Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?. Even if you're fire-breathing, shit you can say to inspire heat. If you wrapped your entire meat pad up in a dryer sheet. And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it. Better not use me as your topic. anybody who brings me up, duck it. Let me keep it one hundred. two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion. The queen and her husband. last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah. [Chorus: Labrinth]. Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (oh, oh). Whatever you want, you can have from me (oh, oh). I want your love, just lead me on. Won't give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey. 'Cause I'm a sucker for ya.

fly (feat. rihanna),"[Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. I wish today it will rain all day.

Maybe that is why I chase strangers away. They got their guns out aiming at me. But I become near when they aiming at me. Me, me, me against them. Me against enemies, me against friends. Somehow they both seem to become one. A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood. They start coming and I start rising. Must be surprising, I'm just summising. Win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher. More fire. [Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. Everybody wanna try to box me in. Suffocating everytime it locks me in. Paint they own pictures than they crop me in. But I will remain where the top begins. Cause I am not a word, I am not a line. I am not a girl that can every be defined. I am not fly, I am levitation. I represent an entire generation. I hear the criticism loud and clear. That is how I know that the time is near. So we become alive in a time of fear. And I aint got no muthaf-cking time to spare. Cry my eyes out for days upon days. Such a heavy burden placed upon me.

Niggas ain't ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti. Mario Andretti, money comin' fast. My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass. I could never be a racist,. wake up every morning just to count white faces. Neo in the Matrix, glorious as Morpheus. Employed all warriors, I'm mean as a scorpion, Dr. Kevorkian. [Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]. Everytime I come you gotta know a nigga comin'. Get a lot of money when I'm in the buildin'. And I come and say there ain't nobody better, better, better. Uh-huh, Okay. Niggas know I got you when I hit you with the pitter-patter. Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter-chatter. Niggas know there ain't nobody, better, better, better. I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut. So sick when I come and hit em in the gut. You will crown me king (no matter what!). Ok let's shine my friend. Get up on my grind again.

all things go,"Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent. I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since. I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent. Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant. Cherish these nights, cherish these people. Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel. And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful. As long as 7 years from now. I'm taking my daughter to preschool. Cherish these days, man do they go quick. Just yesterday, I swear it was '06. Ten years ago, that's when you proposed. I look down, yes I suppose. All things go, all things go. All things go, all things go. I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone. While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls. So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong. Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young. We keep goin', we go, we go, we go. We wake back up and do it all again. We know, we know, say fuck the world. We ridin' til the end. When all is said and done, look at what we've become. I just want you to know, that I did it for you. I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence. His sister said he wanted to stay with me. But I didn't invite him. Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?. Cause since I got fame. They don't act the same. Even though they know that I love him. Family ties broken before me. Niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me. And that's the reflection of me. Yes I get it, I get it, it was all me. I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes. The last day he saw me. All things go, all things go. All things go, all things go. I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone. While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls. So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong. Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young. We keep goin', we go, we go, we go. We wake back up and do it all again. We know, we know, say fuck the world. We ridin' til the end. When all is said and done, look at what we've become. I just want you to know, that I did it for you. Let me make this clear I'm not difficult. I'm just about my business. I'm not into fake industry parties. And fake agendas. Rock with people for how they make me feel. Not what they give me. Even the ones that hurt me the most. I still show forgiveness. I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact. I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that. She never understands, why I'm so overprotective. The more I work, the more I feel like. Somehow they're neglected. I want 'Caiah to go to college. Just to say ""We did it! "". My child with Aaron. Would've have been sixteen, any minute. So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them. It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him. And I know Jelani will always love me. And I'll always love him. And I'm just his little sister. Not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him. Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint. Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint. All things go, all things go. All things go, all things go"

She told me that I had talent. Got on her knees and prayed for me when I started. being violent. She saw something in me that, until this day I don't. know if I could be dat. But I'm a die tryin and when I'm done cryin. Grab the iron. And black out like I'm retiring. Nightmares of you killing my mother. The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers. N shoulda thrown a book at, ch'you cause I hate you so. much that it burn when I look at ch'you. Chorus x2. May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic my. voice projected my life reflected.

May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic my. voice projected my life reflected. Please baby forgive me, mommy was young, mommy was to. busy tryna have fun now I pat myself on the back for. sending you back cause god knows I was better than. that to conceive then leave you the concept alone. seems evil I'm trapped in my concience. I adhear to the nonsense listened to people who told. me I wasn't ready for you. But how the fuck would they know wat I was ready to. do. And of course it wasn't your fault"

bed of lies (feat. skylar grey),"[Skylar Grey]. Do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. And I knew better than to look in your eyes. They only pretend you would be mine. And you know how you made me believe. You had me caught in every web that you weaved. But do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. [Nicki Minaj]. You could never make eye contact. Everything you got was based off of my contacts. You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat. Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap. You was caught up in the rush. And you was caught up in the thrill of it. You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it. Put you in the crib. And you ain't never pay a bill in it. I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it. I told baby hit you. I said this nigga buggin'. Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public. Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating. Overdosin', no more coastin'. No more toastin' over oceans. They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone. They say that your darkest hour. Come before your dawn. But there was something. That I should've asked all along. I'mma ask on the song. [Skylar Grey]. Do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. And I knew better than to look in your eyes. They only pretend you would be mine. And you know how you made me believe. You had me caught in every web that you weaved. But do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. [Nicki Minaj]. I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes. You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies. I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace. But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate. I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend. What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend. When the tears roll down. It's like you ain't even notice 'em. If you had a heart. I was hoping that you would show it some. What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?. I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me. I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony. This ain't 'How to be a player'. You ain't Bill Bellamy. They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone. They say that your darkest hour. Come before your dawn. But there was something that. I should've asked, all along. I'mma ask on the song. [Skylar Grey]. So does she know I've been in that bed before?. A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth. If I was just another girl. Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you. There's one thing I need to know. So call me when you're not so busy. Just thinking of yourself. Do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. And I knew better than to look in your eyes. They only pretend you would be mine. And you know how you made me believe. You had me caught in every web that you weaved. But do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies"

Young girls always lookin' for a soulmate. But I shoulda listened to what momma told me. Furry moon boots, shades Dita. Too high to give a shit about PETA. Sativa so strong I'm not blinkin'. What in the world was I thinkin'?. New day, new money to be made. New things for them to imitate. I'm a fuckin' black barbie. Pretty face, perfect body. Pink seats in the 'Rari. Always fuck him like I'm sorry. Who the fuck is gon' protect her?. If I really gotta check her. Peter Piper picked a pepper. And my cake is triple decker. No Flex Zone, No Flex Zone. (Yeah, oh no, no, no, no) No Flex Zone. I see these silly nigga's flexin', it's a no zone. You gon' be floatin' in dem rivers. Like you know Joan. Island girl, Donald Trump want me go home.

born to be wild,"I was just a player in the game of love. Till she came and turned my tables around. Stacking up mi chips lining up all mi cards. Still they all came tumbling down. Man I think I might, think I might make her the one. Take them stealin' me up on the run. She hits me like a shot gun, I'm done. If love is the beat she's the stead of my drum. Fly me away, the kingdom come. She got me going, daram-dam-daram-dam. Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild. Oh no, oh no, till love shot me down. I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love. I'm sayin, Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild. Oh no, oh no till you came around. I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love. Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild. Oooohh I'm blown away, uh whoa, I'm blown away. Love was just a word till I bought me a ballah. Oh you everything for holding me down. I'm tellin' all my homies that I'mma find me a queen. In the jungle so you facing the crowd. Man I think I might, think I might make her the one. Take them stealin me up on the run. She hits me like a shot gun, I'm done. If love is the beat she's the stead of my drum. Fly me away, the kingdom come. She got me going, daram-dam-daram-dam.

I be known to eat these raps coco like chef Ramsey. Mission accomplished, you're my accomplice. Cover oh Vogue I'mma go topless. I'mma go bunkass I'mma go crazy. I'mma get reckless and have a baby. Then hang a baby off up the balcony. Teachin' him ""moon walk"", tellin' him he's Japanese. Yay!!!. I'm sayin', Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild. Oh no, oh no till you came around.

"champion (feat. nas, drake, young jeezy)","Mmm.. This is celebration, this is levetation. Look at how you winnin now, this took dedication. This is meditation, higher education. This the official competitor elimination. I was takin trips with Web to move weight,. Came back to queens then hit up a new state. Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math. Bitches ain't have cut up crack up in the stash. 50 cent italian, icy flow. It's that run and get a dollar for a ice cream cone. Cuz they killed my little cousin Nicholas. But my memory's only happy images. This is for the hood, this is for the kids. This is for the single mothers, niggas doin biz. This one is for TT, Tweety, Viola, Shariki. Candice, Timby, Lauren, Iesha.. It's a celebration. Put it up for the ghetto. It's times like these. They know who we are by now. They know who we are.. Champion, a champion.. (Drake).

Cuz I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game,. they know. Makin' hits in 3 acre cribs. Cookin' up tryna eat nigga steak and ribs. I made a couple stars outta basic chicks.

What chu call a crib in the sky? play high. Half a mil in 3 weeks, yall did it like a champ. Mama taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps. Wait a minute, every body pause for the photo. Somebody tell these loco ain't niggas, I'm global. Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne goin. What I gotta do to get this coconut flowin. Don't let me in son, hundred bottles of the ace. Lemme in son, go money cases in my place let's celebrate. It's a celebration. Put it up for the ghetto. It's times like these. They know who we are by now. They know who we are..

I'm back to thuggin bitches that can make it. and kiss other bitches,. My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother's sister. I just aspire, desire to be different. My 10 year old plan just one year til finish. My list went like this: first thing to sever,. The difference in pussy white black latin or other. Here's a man who clearly isn't basic,. Waitin list just to hear me or witness the greatness. Loud laughter while writin my next chapter. Fast cash life, happily ever after. Champions"
changed it (feat. lil wayne),"[verse 1: lil wayne]. I did it for everybody out here on their own. I did it for the ones who walk a mile in them cages. And never tell me no. Come get me when I fall. And tell me when I'm wrong. But you should know I bought 'em. I changed it, I changed it. They say that shit the same. It ain't the same, though. I changed it, I changed it. [chorus: lil wayne]. Oh my god, I changed it. Oh my god, they on the same shit. Oh my god, I changed it. Oh my god, they still on the same shit. You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'. You end up everywhere you say you wasn't. Is that your boyfriend?. Why you say that's your cousin?. I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me. [verse 2: nicki minaj]. The big 3 on the court, bitch hit them bleachers. I don't wanna have to break bad like it screeches. A bitch out in atlanta eating them peaches. A bitch got more bars than where big meech is. No, you can't bone it, nigga, ain't no lisa here. She gon' dread this and nicki like lisa hair. I buy, lil nigga, ain't no leaser here. The bitch gambled her career. Now it's gon' be severe. I ain't just be watchin' bitches pitfalls. Stop doin' pills, but bitch don't withdrawals. I am in my mission rockin' pink drawers. I leveled up, bitch, I switch flows. Mj to the teens. I am billie jean and them bitches my sons. I'm doin' it for fun, I am the first number. Tell them bitches I won. This hoe gettin' slick. So I put on gym shoes and extended my run. Mj, game 6, jackson, tyson. [pre-chorus: nicki minaj]. Quiet dog, my phone changed up. I'm icin' all my barbie chains up. And when I come, get your change cup. These bum bitches never change up.

No more seein' visions, I changed it. Young money shit, mula gang shit. Different hoes doing the same shit. Poppin' pills, we don't know where the pain went. Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean. Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen. Yeah, carter time, I put bling on for the time. She changed her ringtone to one of mine. I changed 23s to 45s. Lil tune like autotune. I get in her throat and she harmonize. She get the d and ooh la la la. And when she leave, I kumbaya. I whip it up with the left hand. I don't fuck with the yes man. I get younger by the second. I don't rust like def jam. It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team. Have sex on my jet ski. Text my chef, told 'em ""let's beef"". Changing girls, change is fine. She don't like girls, change her mind. Change the world, change my line. Never ever change my slimes. Changing looks, changing lies. Changing skies, changing lanes. Me, minaj, and champagne changed the game. And y'all chump change. I'm just sayin'. [pre-chorus: nicki minaj]. Quiet dog, my phone changed up. I'm icin' all my barbie chains up. And when I come, get your change cut. These bum bitches never change up. [chorus: lil wayne]. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they still on the same. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they still on the same. You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'. You end up everywhere you say you wasn't. Is that your boyfriend?. Why you say that's your cousin?. I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they on the same. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they still on the same. You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'. You end up everywhere you say you wasn't. Is that your boyfriend?. Why you say that's your cousin?. I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me. [outro: lil wayne]. Mula, mula gang. Mula, mula gang.

Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show. So I just deaded you, left you in all black. But dear old Nicki, please call back. Chorus. You told me you'd come when I needed you. And you said it so sweetly I believed you. But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you. But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that. Verse 2.

They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess. I had to make them changes, I hoped you understood. You see for every bad, I did a ton of good. But you was underground and I was main stream. I live the life now that we would daydream. My only wish is you come enjoy it with me. Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me. The money came yeah, tripled and quadrupled it. But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit. And it's still fuck the media. They ridiculed you, never believed in ya. They just debted you, left you in all black.

Yellow chain look like the moon and my old school is maroon. VROOM! Hear it ert-ert when it skrrt. 26's on the skirts, in a bird, with a flirt. You can jerk, I got twerk, I keep work, in my birds.

I'm such a girl, I'm such a girly girl. I'm sippin on my milkshake with the swirly swirl. Excuse me mister put some cherries in my cups. I take my shirt off and watch the boys go nuts. The boys go nut, the boy-boys go nuts. All the dope boys all the boys wanna fuck. My niqqa S Beezy, keep my wrist breezy. Why would I go hard when this shit is so easy?. [Chorus]. [Rocko]. Hold up bitch!. Man I done stepped my swag up, don't fly commercial I'm private. Step my rank up, so SALUTE you fuckin private. 'Member the days I used to keep my comb, in my pocket?.

encore 07,"Thank you. Thank you for coming out tonight. Ladies and gentle men. I am the president of Dirty Money Records. (what the hell are you waiting for). New York City (chyea). . Who you know fresher than Nick. Riddle me that. Mammi you itty bitty. Can't mirror me back. Everybody gon see where I'm lyrically at. Used to hate Nicki now they giving me dap. I live and I learn but I wait my turn. I'm always on the run got weight to burn. Ease off the gas then I make a turn. Three off the pass they don't play like her. Why I can't just be ill. Why when they see me bitches gotta go ""ew"". Why my lil nigga still gotta sell krills. Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal (chea). The rain and the pain. I done paid my dues. I'm ready for da game. I done laced my shoes. Everything I say believe I'm gon do. Came out the coop petite with tall boots. Can I get a encore I know you want more. I know you sick of all them girls. They're such a bore. But it's my time I need ya'll to roar. Its my time I need ya'll to roar. (what the hell are you waiting for). After me there shall be no more. It's my time I need ya'll to roar. (what the hell are you waiting for). Look what you made me do. Look what I made for you. Knew when I paid my dues. That I would aim for you. Straight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems. The only thing they know is that I push a beam. All they sees a pretty face. How I ride the base. So I put my hoodie down just to hide my face. They don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide. Told me keep my cares inside, it's merely pride. Like my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop. Said the next time I seen her she would be in a box (damn). She was right, she was dead right. How was I to know that would be her last night (last night). If I could turn back the time. Dear god, somehow could you press rewind. Wont come when I call, but he just in time. So I come when he call, like I'm next in line. When you got something good why the devil gotta ruin it. Guess she never know I be the best bitch doin it. (Tired of being what you want me to be. Feeling so faithless lost under the surface. Don't know what you're expecting of me. Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes. Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow. Every step that I take is another mistake to you. Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow. And every second I waste is more than I can take. I've become so numb I can't feel you there. I've become so tired so much more aware. I'm becoming this all I want to do. As be more like me and be less like you. I've become so numb). Can I get a encore I know you want more. (I've become so numb). But it's my time I need ya'll to roar. It's my time I need ya'll to roar"

fly (feat. rihanna),"[Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. I wish today it will rain all day. Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away. Trying to forgive you for abandoning me. Praying but I think I'm still an angel away. Angel away, yeah strange in a way. Maybe that is why I chase strangers away. They got their guns out aiming at me. But I become near when they aiming at me. Me, me, me against them. Me against enemies, me against friends. Somehow they both seem to become one. A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood. They start coming and I start rising. Must be surprising, I'm just summising. Win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher. More fire. [Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. Everybody wanna try to box me in. Suffocating everytime it locks me in. Paint they own pictures than they crop me in. But I will remain where the top begins. Cause I am not a word, I am not a line. I am not a girl that can every be defined. I am not fly, I am levitation. I represent an entire generation. I hear the criticism loud and clear. That is how I know that the time is near. So we become alive in a time of fear. And I aint got no muthaf-cking time to spare. Cry my eyes out for days upon days. Such a heavy burden placed upon me. But when you go hard your nay's become yay's. Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's. [Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj - Bridge]. Get ready for it. Get ready for it. Get ready for it. I came to win. Get ready for it. Get ready for it. I came to win. [Rihanna - Chorus]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly"

here i am,"VERSE 1. Why is that that you could only see the worst in me?. I swear sometimes I feel like it nurtures me. But to keep it all real is kinda hurtin’ me. I could say I’m done with it, but it lurks in me. So I’m a just tell myself that it works for me. Take a real long drive in the Mer-ce-des. And I might pop a couple of them per-ca-ces. Yeah that’ll make me transform to Hercules. CHORUS. (I love who I am). Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am. Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am. Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am. VERSE 2. I swear to God, man, everything in life is old. And the only thing that change is the price of gold. Even in the afterlife I’m a fight your soul. Cause the second time around I’ll be twice as grown. So do you take me to be who I am?. To have and to hold till death do us part. Cause if not it’s just best we both part. Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?. You got me thinkin’ twice to just breathe. Then you say I won’t survive if I leave. But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve. I no longer need your attention, at ease. It’s a joke, it’s a game,. Why am I still keeping score?. I’m in pain, I’m ashamed. I’m a woman, hear me roar (2x). Now it’s a joke, it’s a game,. Why am i still keeping score?. I’m in pain, I’m ashamed. I’m a woman, hear me roar (2x). CHORUS. (I love who I am).

[Nicki Minaj - Verse 2]. I get it in though. No sexual innuendo. Nobody that I can just depend on. Until I touchdown in the end zone. And then they come out like roaches. P-P-Peck it away like vultures. But little did they know. Distribute the payroll. Pick up the album, pick up the single. Sadly, I’m so business savvy. Similar protocol but the templates vary. Never been like me and never been like this. My flows are crisis they scream in high pitch. Uh gun cock, pause. And I’m well aware of the gun laws. Telling ‘em that I’m running for the top force. Headed-to-the-top dot org. [Chorus]. Yea this is my last chance ohhh, last chance ohhh. Yea this is my last chance, then shoot. I’m ready to shoot. I’m ready to shoot (ready to shoot).

Never worry where your income would come from. Cause no matter where you was I held you down. Up north to uptown. So how you sound. Now you all up in my face bout you make mistakes. If I'da known you was fake I'da laced your steak. Strick nine one time in your welchs grape. Quit lying. Why you lying. I watched the tape. Now get up out my dressing room. Give me some f'ing room. Go get your mind right and take it as a lesson learned. Just like usher nigga you gon have to let it burn. To the left and I ain't talkin about jigga girl. [CHORUS:]. Oh now you wanna be with me. But you can't be with me. Boy leave me alone. You know you did me wrong. So I gotta letcha go. If you wanted me in your life. You shoulda treated me right. Boy leave me alone.

Your like balloon boy mama you was never there!. [Repeat Chorus:]. I am the kung fu panda. Fuck all o' ya blogs, fuck all o' ya propaganda. Good for the goose then it's good for the gander. Nicki ain't a rapper, nicki is a brander. Please you can never compare to me. All these bitches is scared of me. I am who they couldn't even dare to be. So that's all folks, badibadee. I go hard pause. Hospital flow get more gauze. I'm a bad bitch on all fours. The president be like it's all yours. Weezy and Nicki bring the A-game, high stats. Go together like Ricky and his eye patch. Go together like a team in the gym. Kareem in the ring, the queen and the king. [Repeat Chorus:]"

Chow out, fow wall, I'm grillin' on 'em. Straight me and the team, eye to the ceilin'. Ridin' in the porsche, fly away from the civic. Know it's a party every evening. Always gettin' complaints from the ceilings. So I got me a crib in the valley. But I'm always still in the city. Out of town, still smoking calli. Throwin' swishas fast as a feeling. Lil' niggas betta get ya updates. Been a whole new game since it came out. Black track need pack, need co-game. But in my own lane, get ya own ride. Nah, no flex, we soarin'. Off this bitch if anybody want it. Pall is swift if a nigga been pourin'. And got me feel that it ain't no opponent. No flex, zone. No flex zone. They know better. They know better. My kicks is betta, my bitch is betta. They know about me, they know I got it. Last night I killed her, all white in levis. They know to fuss, they know it's cocky. Fillin' pieces, fresh a bottle lemus. Golden cola, Jesus, killin' all these features. If you're outta job, come get employed. Rockin' shit that they can't afford. Least a thousand on the pet of joys. I don't think that they ready for it. Buy brand new mansion, 20 bitches dancin'. Come thru them jassies, 20 grand on the jacket. 30k on the back end, this shit feel like trappin'. Up in the city gettin' play, these muthafuckas betta have my k. Cause we eatin', betta than the city in the week-end. Weller than the bruthas we gheekin'. Have another bottle with my niggas then we leavin'. Somebody comin' on boat this evenin'. Er'body got another seal about the team. Porter house niggas started with a dream.

no love,"[Intro: Nicki Minaj]. (Drumma Boy). August. Young Money. I swear this is my favorite song [laughs]. I'm serious. [Verse 1: August Alsina]. Red light. You know I can't make this thing that official. Believe we had a great night. But I ain't the type to tell you that I miss you shit. You don't like that I make this easy, leaving. After sexing on the floor. Baby I know you need me, like I need you. But I'm not the one you wanna love. [Hook: August Alsina]. So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me. Loving ain't the same with a nigga like. You use to them but ain't no loving me. I hear what you would say and girl it's clear to see. You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me. You probably go insane with a nigga like me. Let's just party till we can't, ain't no loving me. And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me. So don't come looking for love. Oh, no love [x9]. (Don't come looking for love). Oh, no love [x9]. [Verse 2: August Alsina]. Shawty if you looking for somebody tryna settle down. Probably won't be around nah baby. You should hit when you tired of playing up in the house. And ain't nobody around. You need that. When you need that late night. We can both make love to the daylight. You got it girl, you got it girl. But you know I can't stay right? Uh nah babe. All I want is you so what you tryna do?. [Hook]. [Refrain: August Alsina]. No love, no love, no love [x6]. [Bridge: Nicki Minaj]. August you know, I'm here to save you. Me and them girls, we ain't the same boo. You know I hate it, when you leave me. Cause you love it then you leave it. But you know how bad I need it. You're so fuckin' conceited. Why you coming over weeded. [Verse 3: Nicki Minaj (August Alsina) ]. You can't treat me like you treat them. Yes, I am the crème de la crème. Yes I am from one to ten, ten. You fronting in them streets, saying we just friends. You can't front like this ain't way realer. I know you hard, I know that you a killer. I know you started off a dope dealer. But let your guard down. Your niggas know you feel her, feel her. So what you want, baby?. (All I want is you).

And when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaaa). I was six years old when I started creeping. My parents took it to their room and I started peeping. Can you imagine their surprise when they lifted their heads. And saw my little ass creeping at the foot of the bed. And they knew I was a creep since the day I was born. Get popping out of momma like some chemical(?). And the doctor saw my head and he starting freaking. Cause I came clean and I came out creeping. [Nicki Minaj]. When I was a girl, I creeped in the boys locker room. Hide deep inside, it was my little creep stalker room. As they dis-robed I was oogling and oggling. Little did they know that for me they was modelling. And I would laugh ha ha ha ha ha haha. And they would dance la la la la lalala-laaa. So pop pop pop your peepers and turn out your sneakers. Don't sleep, come and get ya creep on with me. Go get ya sweating off ya bride at her wedding. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaaa). [Nicki Minaj]. But when you sneek into a wake and. You see a beefcake. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaa). When the judge is a hottie and you can't control ya body. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaa). [Nicki Minaj].

Now I got fire, 23's almost higher. Shout outs to my brothers Jelani and Makiah. Thanks to the Messiah, my money getting higher. One time for my niggas that be huggin' the block. 2 Times for my niggas that be ducking the cops. 3 Times for my girls that pushing they own rides. Stooshing they own rides from bitches they dont like. Sometimes you get mad, wanna blaze the gun. I see you without a man, might erase ya son. Well look, when you blow up, everybody go shudder. This goes out to everybody on the come up. I remember standing in the mirror. Searching for a winner but I didn't see it in her. Now I've gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh. woah, woah.

truffle butter (feat. drake & lil wayne),"[Verse 1: Drake]. Uh, thinkin' out loud. I must have a quarter million on me right now. Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money. Two things I'm 'bout is talkin' blunt and staying blunted. Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?. We should all disappear right now. Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car. And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?. You see the fleet of all the new things.

Why'd you have to go so soon. We miss you. Why couldn't you come right home. When you seen the text message in your phone. I should've put my pradas on to come and find you. I could've told you that them niggs was behind you. I couldve told you all about my intuition. I couldve even brought the extra ammunition. But now you've m-m-m-moved so fuck you.

If you in a better place then you free. Well then why cant they make me believe it. You said that you would leave these streets. And I know you didn't mean in a body bag. But now you see you not bullet proof. And Im mad cause you the best that I ever had. Why'd you have to go so soon. We miss you. I'll never love again.

fly (feat. rihanna),"[Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. I wish today it will rain all day.

Maybe that is why I chase strangers away. They got their guns out aiming at me. But I become near when they aiming at me. Me, me, me against them. Me against enemies, me against friends. Somehow they both seem to become one. A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood. They start coming and I start rising. Must be surprising, I'm just summising. Win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher. More fire. [Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. Everybody wanna try to box me in. Suffocating everytime it locks me in. Paint they own pictures than they crop me in. But I will remain where the top begins. Cause I am not a word, I am not a line. I am not a girl that can every be defined. I am not fly, I am levitation. I represent an entire generation. I hear the criticism loud and clear. That is how I know that the time is near. So we become alive in a time of fear. And I aint got no muthaf-cking time to spare. Cry my eyes out for days upon days. Such a heavy burden placed upon me.

all i do is win (remix),"[Hook: T-Pain]. All I do is win, win, win, no matter what. Got money on my mind I can never get enough. Whenever me and Khaled. do the remix everybody's hands go up. And they stay there. And they stay yea. And they stay there. Up, down, up, down, up, down. Cause all I do is win, win, win. And if you going in put your hands in the air. make em stay there. [Verse 1: DJ Khaled]. Sittin' on the top floor, what you think I'm hot for. Every summer drop more, hits to make my stock go, up. Them hands go, up; them fans go, up. I'm number one in this bitch and I'ma, stay there. We the best of the best, grind while you haters just sleep. I'm yellin' ""free Weezy"", I rep the heart of the streets. Who hotter than me, I'm wearin' the crown. We can't stop, won't stop; go hate on me now. [Verse 2: Rick Ross]. I could never get enough when it come to gettin' feta. Niggas ain't ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti. Mario Andretti, money comin' fast. My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass. I could never be a racist,. wake up every morning just to count white faces. Neo in the Matrix, glorious as Morpheus. Employed all warriors, I'm mean as a scorpion, Dr. Kevorkian. [Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]. Everytime I come you gotta know a nigga comin'. Get a lot of money when I'm in the buildin'. And I come and say there ain't nobody better, better, better. Uh-huh, Okay. Niggas know I got you when I hit you with the pitter-patter. Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter-chatter. Niggas know there ain't nobody, better, better, better. I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut. So sick when I come and hit em in the gut. You will crown me king (no matter what!). Ok let's shine my friend. Get up on my grind again. Some niggas will be happy that I chose to rhyme with them cause. [Hook]. [Verse 4: Diddy]. Her heart racing like she snort cocaine. I got a billion reasons you should know my whole name. Got the most paper Mr. New York Times. I'm a natural born winner nigga New York mines. Everybody getting money but I cop the first six. Now I run the game so I toss the first pitch. Yea, I'll let you wife her but she still my first bitch. If it's less then nine digits nigga, that ain't fuckin' rich mother fucker. [Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]. Ayo, all I do is win, ain't that the reason that you really mad. Undisputed hailing all the way from Trinidad. I ain't mad ma, see you on your bummy swag. I'm in that money green Jag, lot of money bags. I told Khaled you the best but I'm the bestest. Better run for cover if your name is on my checklist. You could talk slick, all the way down to the welfare. Ask the IRS bitch, I'm paying for your health care. [Verse 6: Fabolous]. I'ma make this here official, Let me clear some issues. First off I am not for Britney Spears initials. Thats no B-S, at your re-quest. Lean back you and your crew, Fat Joe, T-S. Yea it's Young Funeral, all black on me. So act like summers over and fall back homey. Winnin' is all I do, I'll answer all of you. But y'all ain't sayin' shit, like prank callers do. [Hook]. [Verse 7: Jadakiss].

We already got a jet, we tryna get two of em. [Verse 8: Fat Joe]. Just blew trial, crack lobsters Little Italy. Your wife she a screamer yellin' slow down Joe, you killin' me. Beat her like a prize fight mommy I'm a rude boy. You just hit the Power Ball, everyday a new toy. Nigga it's a stick up, a motherfuckin' robbery. I done did some things that have Haitian Jack proud of me. Ridin' through Harlem me and Jeezy pardon me. Puffy surfin' on the hood for niggas that keep doubtin' me. [Hook]"
all things go,"Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent. I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since. I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent. Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant. Cherish these nights, cherish these people. Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel. And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful. As long as 7 years from now. I'm taking my daughter to preschool. Cherish these days, man do they go quick. Just yesterday, I swear it was '06. Ten years ago, that's when you proposed. I look down, yes I suppose. All things go, all things go. All things go, all things go. I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone. While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls. So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong. Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young. We keep goin', we go, we go, we go. We wake back up and do it all again. We know, we know, say fuck the world. We ridin' til the end. When all is said and done, look at what we've become. I just want you to know, that I did it for you. I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence. His sister said he wanted to stay with me. But I didn't invite him. Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?. Cause since I got fame. They don't act the same. Even though they know that I love him. Family ties broken before me. Niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me. And that's the reflection of me. Yes I get it, I get it, it was all me. I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes. The last day he saw me. All things go, all things go. All things go, all things go. I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone. While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls. So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong. Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young. We keep goin', we go, we go, we go. We wake back up and do it all again. We know, we know, say fuck the world. We ridin' til the end. When all is said and done, look at what we've become. I just want you to know, that I did it for you. Let me make this clear I'm not difficult. I'm just about my business. I'm not into fake industry parties. And fake agendas. Rock with people for how they make me feel. Not what they give me. Even the ones that hurt me the most. I still show forgiveness. I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact. I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that. She never understands, why I'm so overprotective. The more I work, the more I feel like. Somehow they're neglected. I want 'Caiah to go to college. Just to say ""We did it! "". My child with Aaron. Would've have been sixteen, any minute. So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them. It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him. And I know Jelani will always love me. And I'll always love him. And I'm just his little sister. Not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him. Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint. Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint. All things go, all things go. All things go, all things go"
always love you,"[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]. Once upon a time there lived the Harajuku Barbie. Use to watch the game in madison square garden. Coliseum block on the weekend Italian. Icces from the Puerto Ricans. She reps Queens like a crown or a real poofy gown. Or the little white lady out in London. Weeds bridge far rock, southside Jamacia block. Flat-Bush Brooklyn, all of them Jamacian spots. This is my city and I be reppin my city. It's where the giants will tackle you, call a capital avalon. If you come to my city u might see what I mean. It's the city that never sleeps but it's the city of dreams. [Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]. What up uptown, downtown, 6th ward. 7th ward, hardheads, west bank, 5th ward. 3rd ward, 10th ward, reppin every damn street. Shout out the mighty nine and east 2 Mazant St. Rest in peace son he had Tyra Lan. On lockdown, it's a shame they took him out the game. I see ya CeCe, Nacho, FiFi. Snag Gang, Chuck D, Tallee, T-Streets. That's them Garetti boys, all about the fetti boy. Only think broke 'round here is the levee boy. You know my city nigga, yeah it's real hood. Talk to Turk other day, he doin real good. Hold ya head C, hold ya head mack. Rest in peace Soulja, damn we need You back. Shout out B. G. , the whole Chopper City. Cash Money, Young Money, yeah we got the city. [Verse 3: Short Dawg]. Yeah, now let's welcome the Katrina victims. I wasn't there when it happen, but I seen the pictures. So anything my niggas need they can call Short. My arms always opened like Walmart. I moved to the A and promised I'mma be back. I'm still #1 in Houston like T-Mac. Check my sleeve tats, I know you see that. H with a star, syrup pourin over green back. Yeah, and I ain't talking Ms. Buttersworth. So pass me a styrofoam double cup at first. And I'mma pour a four up in that. And sip it till you see me movin slow like I'm fat. This the home of the the candy painted doors on the 'lac. And voices sounding deep as baratone on the track.

autobiography,"May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic. My voice projected my life reflected. Daddy was a crack feind 2 in the morning had us. running down the street like a track team. When he burnt the house down n my mother was in it. How could I forget it the, pain infinite. Shes my queen and I ain't even british. Shes the only reason that I went to school and I. finished. She told me that I had talent. Got on her knees and prayed for me when I started. being violent. She saw something in me that, until this day I don't. know if I could be dat. But I'm a die tryin and when I'm done cryin. Grab the iron. And black out like I'm retiring. Nightmares of you killing my mother. The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers. N shoulda thrown a book at, ch'you cause I hate you so. much that it burn when I look at ch'you. Chorus x2. May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic my. voice projected my life reflected.

So why hurt you that's the question. It took this long for me to learn my lesson. Cause now all I want is peace and get drama. I finally understand the true meaning of karma. Chorus x2. May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic my. voice projected my life reflected. Please baby forgive me, mommy was young, mommy was to. busy tryna have fun now I pat myself on the back for. sending you back cause god knows I was better than. that to conceive then leave you the concept alone. seems evil I'm trapped in my concience. I adhear to the nonsense listened to people who told. me I wasn't ready for you. But how the fuck would they know wat I was ready to. do. And of course it wasn't your fault"

bed of lies (feat. skylar grey),"[Skylar Grey]. Do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. And I knew better than to look in your eyes. They only pretend you would be mine. And you know how you made me believe. You had me caught in every web that you weaved. But do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. [Nicki Minaj]. You could never make eye contact. Everything you got was based off of my contacts. You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat. Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap. You was caught up in the rush. And you was caught up in the thrill of it. You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it. Put you in the crib. And you ain't never pay a bill in it. I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it. I told baby hit you. I said this nigga buggin'. Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public. Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating. Overdosin', no more coastin'. No more toastin' over oceans. They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone. They say that your darkest hour. Come before your dawn. But there was something. That I should've asked all along. I'mma ask on the song. [Skylar Grey]. Do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. And I knew better than to look in your eyes. They only pretend you would be mine. And you know how you made me believe. You had me caught in every web that you weaved. But do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. [Nicki Minaj]. I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes. You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies. I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace. But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate. I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend. What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend. When the tears roll down. It's like you ain't even notice 'em. If you had a heart. I was hoping that you would show it some. What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?. I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me. I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony. This ain't 'How to be a player'. You ain't Bill Bellamy. They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone. They say that your darkest hour. Come before your dawn. But there was something that. I should've asked, all along. I'mma ask on the song. [Skylar Grey]. So does she know I've been in that bed before?. A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth. If I was just another girl. Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you. There's one thing I need to know. So call me when you're not so busy. Just thinking of yourself. Do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies. And I knew better than to look in your eyes. They only pretend you would be mine. And you know how you made me believe. You had me caught in every web that you weaved. But do you ever think of me when you lie?. Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies"

Fly me away, the kingdom come. She got me going, daram-dam-daram-dam. Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild. Oh no, oh no, till love shot me down.

"champion (feat. nas, drake, young jeezy)","Mmm.. This is celebration, this is levetation. Look at how you winnin now, this took dedication. This is meditation, higher education. This the official competitor elimination. I was takin trips with Web to move weight,. Came back to queens then hit up a new state. Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math. Bitches ain't have cut up crack up in the stash. 50 cent italian, icy flow. It's that run and get a dollar for a ice cream cone. Cuz they killed my little cousin Nicholas. But my memory's only happy images. This is for the hood, this is for the kids. This is for the single mothers, niggas doin biz. This one is for TT, Tweety, Viola, Shariki. Candice, Timby, Lauren, Iesha.. It's a celebration. Put it up for the ghetto. It's times like these. They know who we are by now. They know who we are.. Champion, a champion.. (Drake). Yeah, okay, we made it to america. I remember when I used to stay with erica. Label transferred 20 million to comerica. Fuckin terrabus got me actin out of character. Young TO nigga, either ridin' range. The ferarri top down, screamin money ain't a thang. Tell me when I changed, girl, but only when I change. Cuz I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game,. they know. Makin' hits in 3 acre cribs. Cookin' up tryna eat nigga steak and ribs. I made a couple stars outta basic chicks. Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish. Havin good times, makin good money. Lot of bad bitches but they good to me. I make her do the splits for a rack. Wish you niggas good luck tryna get where I'm at. Straight like that. It's a celebration. Put it up for the ghetto. It's times like these. They know who we are by now. They know who we are.. Champion, a champion.. (Young Jeezy). Straight ballin in this bitch, jeremy lin, mello.. Tell me one thing you won't do? settle.. Gimme one word for ya chain? yellow. Pocket full of money, black card, ghetto. Critics say I ain't in the game, A I?. So how you deal with the fame? STAY HIGH. Stay puttin down for the town, may I. What chu call a crib in the sky? play high. Half a mil in 3 weeks, yall did it like a champ. Mama taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps. Wait a minute, every body pause for the photo. Somebody tell these loco ain't niggas, I'm global. Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne goin. What I gotta do to get this coconut flowin. Don't let me in son, hundred bottles of the ace. Lemme in son, go money cases in my place let's celebrate. It's a celebration. Put it up for the ghetto. It's times like these. They know who we are by now. They know who we are.. Champion, a champion.. (Nas). What up nicki? it's nasty. yeah. yeah yeah.. I sold my first 2 million dollars, I was 23.. I'm barely a man yet I had some killers under me. This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ.. Cuz that's where a nigga fuck, murder on replay. My 24th bday, I'm sailin to Bimini. You can see me on a yacht blastin Pac, little nah, I ain't greedy. I'm back to thuggin bitches that can make it. and kiss other bitches,. My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother's sister. I just aspire, desire to be different. My 10 year old plan just one year til finish. My list went like this: first thing to sever,. The difference in pussy white black latin or other. Here's a man who clearly isn't basic,. Waitin list just to hear me or witness the greatness. Loud laughter while writin my next chapter. Fast cash life, happily ever after. Champions"
changed it (feat. lil wayne),"[verse 1: lil wayne]. I did it for everybody out here on their own. I did it for the ones who walk a mile in them cages. And never tell me no. Come get me when I fall. And tell me when I'm wrong. But you should know I bought 'em. I changed it, I changed it. They say that shit the same. It ain't the same, though. I changed it, I changed it. [chorus: lil wayne]. Oh my god, I changed it. Oh my god, they on the same shit. Oh my god, I changed it. Oh my god, they still on the same shit. You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'. You end up everywhere you say you wasn't. Is that your boyfriend?. Why you say that's your cousin?. I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me. [verse 2: nicki minaj]. The big 3 on the court, bitch hit them bleachers. I don't wanna have to break bad like it screeches. A bitch out in atlanta eating them peaches. A bitch got more bars than where big meech is. No, you can't bone it, nigga, ain't no lisa here. She gon' dread this and nicki like lisa hair. I buy, lil nigga, ain't no leaser here. The bitch gambled her career. Now it's gon' be severe. I ain't just be watchin' bitches pitfalls. Stop doin' pills, but bitch don't withdrawals. I am in my mission rockin' pink drawers. I leveled up, bitch, I switch flows. Mj to the teens. I am billie jean and them bitches my sons. I'm doin' it for fun, I am the first number. Tell them bitches I won. This hoe gettin' slick. So I put on gym shoes and extended my run. Mj, game 6, jackson, tyson. [pre-chorus: nicki minaj]. Quiet dog, my phone changed up. I'm icin' all my barbie chains up. And when I come, get your change cup. These bum bitches never change up. [chorus: lil wayne]. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they on the same. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they still on the same. You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'. You end up everywhere you say you wasn't. Is that your boyfriend?. Why you say that's your cousin?. I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me. [verse 3: lil wayne]. No more seein' visions, I changed it. Young money shit, mula gang shit. Different hoes doing the same shit. Poppin' pills, we don't know where the pain went. Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean. Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen. Yeah, carter time, I put bling on for the time. She changed her ringtone to one of mine. I changed 23s to 45s. Lil tune like autotune. I get in her throat and she harmonize. She get the d and ooh la la la. And when she leave, I kumbaya. I whip it up with the left hand. I don't fuck with the yes man. I get younger by the second. I don't rust like def jam. It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team. Have sex on my jet ski. Text my chef, told 'em ""let's beef"". Changing girls, change is fine. She don't like girls, change her mind. Change the world, change my line. Never ever change my slimes. Changing looks, changing lies. Changing skies, changing lanes. Me, minaj, and champagne changed the game. And y'all chump change. I'm just sayin'. [pre-chorus: nicki minaj]. Quiet dog, my phone changed up. I'm icin' all my barbie chains up. And when I come, get your change cut. These bum bitches never change up. [chorus: lil wayne]. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they still on the same. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they still on the same. You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'. You end up everywhere you say you wasn't. Is that your boyfriend?. Why you say that's your cousin?. I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they on the same. Oh my god, I changed. Oh my god, they still on the same. You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'. You end up everywhere you say you wasn't. Is that your boyfriend?. Why you say that's your cousin?. I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me. [outro: lil wayne]. Mula, mula gang. Mula, mula gang.

And hindsight I loved your rawness, and I loved your edge. Caus' it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge. Your earrings bamboo, your long nails too, your Bmw. Everytime you came through. You was the brave heart, you stole Wayne heart. You never switched up, you played the same part. But I needed to grow, and I needed to know. Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show. So I just deaded you, left you in all black. But dear old Nicki, please call back. Chorus. You told me you'd come when I needed you. And you said it so sweetly I believed you. But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you. But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that. Verse 2.

They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess. I had to make them changes, I hoped you understood. You see for every bad, I did a ton of good. But you was underground and I was main stream. I live the life now that we would daydream. My only wish is you come enjoy it with me. Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me. The money came yeah, tripled and quadrupled it. But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit. And it's still fuck the media. They ridiculed you, never believed in ya. They just debted you, left you in all black.

Hold up bitch!. Man I done stepped my swag up, don't fly commercial I'm private. Step my rank up, so SALUTE you fuckin private. 'Member the days I used to keep my comb, in my pocket?. Now I'm with pilot smokin kush on auto-pilot. I jet on a boat and I 'on't even know how to drive it. But it's all gravy I just coast on auto-pilot. I'm on another coast, ye ain't even in my time zone (naw). By the time you go to bed I'm gettin my shine on. Yeah it's all good baby go on and climb on. And ride like a rodeo, get your grind on. Tell how I spend money, I be gettin my grind on. Tell how I'm livin when I walk I got my nine on. Your girl lovin you but she with me know what her mind on. Don't make me do it hard and get it goin on some down homes. Watch pitch stats and he don't even have a dime on. Rocko the don, outta here, my time gone. [Chorus]"
encore 07,"Thank you. Thank you for coming out tonight. Ladies and gentle men. I am the president of Dirty Money Records. (what the hell are you waiting for). New York City (chyea). . Who you know fresher than Nick. Riddle me that. Mammi you itty bitty. Can't mirror me back. Everybody gon see where I'm lyrically at. Used to hate Nicki now they giving me dap. I live and I learn but I wait my turn. I'm always on the run got weight to burn. Ease off the gas then I make a turn. Three off the pass they don't play like her. Why I can't just be ill. Why when they see me bitches gotta go ""ew"". Why my lil nigga still gotta sell krills. Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal (chea). The rain and the pain. I done paid my dues. I'm ready for da game. I done laced my shoes. Everything I say believe I'm gon do. Came out the coop petite with tall boots. Can I get a encore I know you want more. I know you sick of all them girls. They're such a bore. But it's my time I need ya'll to roar. Its my time I need ya'll to roar. (what the hell are you waiting for). After me there shall be no more. It's my time I need ya'll to roar. (what the hell are you waiting for). Look what you made me do. Look what I made for you. Knew when I paid my dues. That I would aim for you. Straight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems. The only thing they know is that I push a beam. All they sees a pretty face. How I ride the base. So I put my hoodie down just to hide my face. They don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide. Told me keep my cares inside, it's merely pride. Like my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop. Said the next time I seen her she would be in a box (damn). She was right, she was dead right. How was I to know that would be her last night (last night). If I could turn back the time. Dear god, somehow could you press rewind. Wont come when I call, but he just in time. So I come when he call, like I'm next in line. When you got something good why the devil gotta ruin it. Guess she never know I be the best bitch doin it. (Tired of being what you want me to be. Feeling so faithless lost under the surface. Don't know what you're expecting of me. Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes. Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow. Every step that I take is another mistake to you. Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow. And every second I waste is more than I can take. I've become so numb I can't feel you there. I've become so tired so much more aware. I'm becoming this all I want to do. As be more like me and be less like you. I've become so numb). Can I get a encore I know you want more. (I've become so numb). But it's my time I need ya'll to roar. It's my time I need ya'll to roar"

fly (feat. rihanna),"[Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. I wish today it will rain all day. Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away. Trying to forgive you for abandoning me. Praying but I think I'm still an angel away. Angel away, yeah strange in a way. Maybe that is why I chase strangers away. They got their guns out aiming at me. But I become near when they aiming at me. Me, me, me against them. Me against enemies, me against friends. Somehow they both seem to become one. A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood. They start coming and I start rising. Must be surprising, I'm just summising. Win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher. More fire. [Rihanna]. I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive. I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise. To fly. To fly. [Nicki Minaj]. Everybody wanna try to box me in. Suffocating everytime it locks me in. Paint they own pictures than they crop me in. But I will remain where the top begins. Cause I am not a word, I am not a line. I am not a girl that can every be defined. I am not fly, I am levitation. I represent an entire generation. I hear the criticism loud and clear. That is how I know that the time is near.

here i am,"VERSE 1. Why is that that you could only see the worst in me?. I swear sometimes I feel like it nurtures me. But to keep it all real is kinda hurtin’ me. I could say I’m done with it, but it lurks in me. So I’m a just tell myself that it works for me. Take a real long drive in the Mer-ce-des. And I might pop a couple of them per-ca-ces. Yeah that’ll make me transform to Hercules. CHORUS. (I love who I am). Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am. Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am. Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am. VERSE 2. I swear to God, man, everything in life is old. And the only thing that change is the price of gold. Even in the afterlife I’m a fight your soul. Cause the second time around I’ll be twice as grown. So do you take me to be who I am?. To have and to hold till death do us part. Cause if not it’s just best we both part. Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?. You got me thinkin’ twice to just breathe. Then you say I won’t survive if I leave. But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve. I no longer need your attention, at ease. It’s a joke, it’s a game,. Why am I still keeping score?. I’m in pain, I’m ashamed. I’m a woman, hear me roar (2x). Now it’s a joke, it’s a game,. Why am i still keeping score?. I’m in pain, I’m ashamed. I’m a woman, hear me roar (2x). CHORUS. (I love who I am).

last chance (feat. natasha bedingfield),"[Nicki Minaj - Verse 1]. Yo I could’ve been had fame. Jumps shot with a stupid ass aim. Cause you couldn’t around the last name. So my crossover wins the last game. And it’s ill, right. Switched up the flow, but it’s still right. Throw back to that, yea I still might. I’mma just do me, when it feel right uh. You can bring it any day. Natural Bad Ass, NBA. That’s my initials. That’s why official. Don’t blow the whistle. Bang Bang the pistol. And I’m and I’m bossy. Can’t keep these hoes up off me. Damn the floor nasty, coffee. Don’t treat me like the poke and cost me. [Natasha Bedingfield - Chorus]. Yea this is my last chance ohhh, last chance ohhh. Yea this is my last chance, then shoot.

[Nicki Minaj - Verse 2]. I get it in though. No sexual innuendo. Nobody that I can just depend on. Until I touchdown in the end zone. And then they come out like roaches. P-P-Peck it away like vultures. But little did they know. Distribute the payroll. Pick up the album, pick up the single. Sadly, I’m so business savvy. Similar protocol but the templates vary. Never been like me and never been like this. My flows are crisis they scream in high pitch. Uh gun cock, pause. And I’m well aware of the gun laws. Telling ‘em that I’m running for the top force. Headed-to-the-top dot org. [Chorus]. Yea this is my last chance ohhh, last chance ohhh. Yea this is my last chance, then shoot. I’m ready to shoot. I’m ready to shoot (ready to shoot). I’m ready to shoot (ready to shoot). I’m ready, I’m ready to shoot (ready to shoot). I’m ready, I’m ready to shooooot. I’m ready to shoot. . [Nicki Minaj Bridge]. All the days of my life I have been waiting for this time. Could you believe now it’s right before my eyes. Anybody trying to stop me better not f-ck with me this time. Shoot, I’m ready to shoot into the sky. [Chorus]. Yea this is my last chance ohhh, last chance ohhh. Yea this is my last chance, then shoot. I’m ready to shoot. I’m ready to shoot (ready to shoot). I’m ready to shoot (ready to shoot). I’m ready to shoot (ready to shoot). I’m ready to shooooot. I’m ready to shoot. Only one chance one bullet in the gun. This is my life and I only got one yea.

How could you love me and humiliate me. You ain't my man don't affiliate me. With all your plans cause you really made me. A lil bitch when that really ain't me. Mondays was the fun days. From the slum to the runway. Runs in the hyundai. Niggas didn't have your money it was gun play. Used to tell me to listen to what a thug say. At night I would sleep on you. And I guess I did sleep on you. Cause when they said it I said creep on who. No not my boo. Ain't what he gon do. [CHORUS:]. Oh now you wanna be with me. But you can't be with me. Boy leave me alone.

Why you saying you ain't feel her. You was in the villa. She was in the white chinchilla. You was sippin on a miller. My bitch pam had the hidden cam like killa. Funny how ya win some. Ya lose some. Never worry where your income would come from. Cause no matter where you was I held you down. Up north to uptown. So how you sound. Now you all up in my face bout you make mistakes. If I'da known you was fake I'da laced your steak. Strick nine one time in your welchs grape. Quit lying. Why you lying. I watched the tape. Now get up out my dressing room. Give me some f'ing room. Go get your mind right and take it as a lesson learned. Just like usher nigga you gon have to let it burn. To the left and I ain't talkin about jigga girl. [CHORUS:]. Oh now you wanna be with me. But you can't be with me. Boy leave me alone. You know you did me wrong. So I gotta letcha go. If you wanted me in your life. You shoulda treated me right. Boy leave me alone. You know you did me wrong. So I gotta letcha go

no love,"[Intro: Nicki Minaj]. (Drumma Boy). August. Young Money. I swear this is my favorite song [laughs]. I'm serious. [Verse 1: August Alsina]. Red light. You know I can't make this thing that official. Believe we had a great night. But I ain't the type to tell you that I miss you shit. You don't like that I make this easy, leaving. After sexing on the floor. Baby I know you need me, like I need you. But I'm not the one you wanna love. [Hook: August Alsina]. So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me. Loving ain't the same with a nigga like. You use to them but ain't no loving me. I hear what you would say and girl it's clear to see. You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me. You probably go insane with a nigga like me. Let's just party till we can't, ain't no loving me. And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me. So don't come looking for love. Oh, no love [x9]. (Don't come looking for love). Oh, no love [x9]. [Verse 2: August Alsina]. Shawty if you looking for somebody tryna settle down. Probably won't be around nah baby. You should hit when you tired of playing up in the house. And ain't nobody around. You need that. When you need that late night. We can both make love to the daylight. You got it girl, you got it girl. But you know I can't stay right? Uh nah babe. All I want is you so what you tryna do?. [Hook]. [Refrain: August Alsina]. No love, no love, no love [x6]. [Bridge: Nicki Minaj]. August you know, I'm here to save you. Me and them girls, we ain't the same boo. You know I hate it, when you leave me. Cause you love it then you leave it. But you know how bad I need it. You're so fuckin' conceited. Why you coming over weeded. [Verse 3: Nicki Minaj (August Alsina) ]. You can't treat me like you treat them. Yes, I am the crème de la crème. Yes I am from one to ten, ten. You fronting in them streets, saying we just friends. You can't front like this ain't way realer. I know you hard, I know that you a killer. I know you started off a dope dealer. But let your guard down. Your niggas know you feel her, feel her. So what you want, baby?. (All I want is you). (So what you trying to do?)"

Worried 'bout y'all niggas us straight. These girls are my sons, John and Kate plus eight. When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late. Dinner with my man on a G5. Is my idea of an update. Hut 1, hut two, big titties, big butt too. Fuck with them real niggas. Who don't tell niggas what they up to. Had to show bitches where the top is. Ring finger where the rock is. These hoes couldn't test me. Even if the name was pop quiz. Bad bitches who I fuck with. Mad bitches we don't fuck with. I don't fuck with them chickens. Unless they last name was cutlet. Let it soak in like seasonin'. And tell 'em bitch blow me, Lance Stephenson. [Chris Brown]. Raise your bottle and cup in the sky.

But when that's over I'm the first in line. And the other day in her Maybach I thought God damn. This is the perfect time. We had just come from that video. You know La traffic, how the city slow. She was sitting down on that big butt. But I was still staring at the titties though. Yeah, lowkey it may be high key. I been peeped that you like me you know.

That's another story, I'm no story teller. I piss greatness like gold and jello. All my goons so overzealous. I'm from Holly Groove, the holy Mecca. Calender say I got money for days. I squirm and I shake. But I'm stuck in my ways. My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave. Baby and I fucked with her surfboard, surfboard. My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade. Don't have my money? I take mothers instead. You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth. Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin. I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with army guns. So think about your son and daughter rooms. Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns. Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms. This is just crazy my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga. That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga. Blood gang take the B, I'll behead ya, my nigga. Fucking for reals if you mouth off. I blow your face off. I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off. Nigga now you see me, nigga now you don't.

And when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaaa). I was six years old when I started creeping. My parents took it to their room and I started peeping. Can you imagine their surprise when they lifted their heads. And saw my little ass creeping at the foot of the bed. And they knew I was a creep since the day I was born. Get popping out of momma like some chemical(?). And the doctor saw my head and he starting freaking. Cause I came clean and I came out creeping. [Nicki Minaj]. When I was a girl, I creeped in the boys locker room. Hide deep inside, it was my little creep stalker room. As they dis-robed I was oogling and oggling. Little did they know that for me they was modelling. And I would laugh ha ha ha ha ha haha. And they would dance la la la la lalala-laaa. So pop pop pop your peepers and turn out your sneakers. Don't sleep, come and get ya creep on with me. Go get ya sweating off ya bride at her wedding. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaaa). [Nicki Minaj]. But when you sneek into a wake and. You see a beefcake. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaa). When the judge is a hottie and you can't control ya body. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaa). [Nicki Minaj].

Thats when everything they write be a contradiction. I tell em I do it for the love. I do it for the hugs. I do it for the buzz. I do it for the thugs. I do it for the rich. I do it for the poor.

Now I got fire, 23's almost higher. Shout outs to my brothers Jelani and Makiah. Thanks to the Messiah, my money getting higher. One time for my niggas that be huggin' the block. 2 Times for my niggas that be ducking the cops. 3 Times for my girls that pushing they own rides. Stooshing they own rides from bitches they dont like. Sometimes you get mad, wanna blaze the gun. I see you without a man, might erase ya son. Well look, when you blow up, everybody go shudder. This goes out to everybody on the come up. I remember standing in the mirror. Searching for a winner but I didn't see it in her. Now I've gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh. woah, woah.

truffle butter (feat. drake & lil wayne),"[Verse 1: Drake]. Uh, thinkin' out loud. I must have a quarter million on me right now. Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money.

Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car. And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?. You see the fleet of all the new things.

But now you see you not bullet proof. And Im mad cause you the best that I ever had. Why'd you have to go so soon. We miss you. I'll never love again.

Baby boy, you'll be young forever. I'll be over here, you'll be over there. I'mma shed a tear, but I really don't care. Frozen in time, always be mine. Baby boy, you'll be young forever. I used to think that we'd reunite. I'd be your wife in the real life. I thought that you'd come back for me. And you would take me away. I never knew only as a teen. You'd reappear only in my dream. Your silhouette in the doorway. But before you walk away. Just say goodbye, look in my eyes. So that I always will remember. Frozen in time, always be mine. Baby boy, you'll be young forever. I'll be over here, you'll be over there. I'mma shed a tear, but I really don't care. Frozen in time, always be mine. Baby boy, you'll be young forever. This is my last cry. Is this the only way?.
