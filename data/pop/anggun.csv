In that dry white ocean alone Lost out in the desert. you are lost out in the desert. But to stand with you in a ring of fire. I'll forget the days gone by.

And if we burn away, I'll pray the skies above for snow to fall on the Sahara. Just a wish and I will cover your shoulders. With veils of silk and gold. When the shadows come and darken your heart. Leaving you with regrets so cold. Lost out in the desert. If your hopes scatter like the dust across your track. I'll be the moon that shines on your path. The sun may blind our eyes, I'll pray the skies above. for snow to fall on the Sahara. If that's the only place where you can leave your doubts. I'll hold you up and be your way out.

a rose in the wind,"I was born at daybreak. To the road I did take. Trembling as the groung shakes. Under my feet. Cracked in the stone heat. Never ending motion. Way across the ocean. Into your devotion. Long have I gone. So far from my home. What to do with this love that I'm in?. I have given you all of my soul. Flying all my life like a rose in the wind. Tell me why I am always alone. On my way home. Dreaming always begin. Find a door that's opening. Something there is shining. The light in your eyes. When you were all mine. All alone as I wake. Moving in a new place. Shivering as I trace. A road of my own. Cut by the deep cold. What to do with this love that I'm in?. I have given you all of my soul. Flying all my life like a rose in the wind. Tell me why I am always alone. Hang on to me tight, and a rose in the wind. Will be with you wherever you go. All the way back home. Can I take you back there?. Drifting on the warm air. Say you'll follow anywhere. All of our nights. Into the jade skies. I'll be true to you. Flying over the moon. Lying in the bamboo. I'll always know. The light in the window. What to do with this love that I'm in?. I have given you all of my soul. Flying all my life like a rose in the wind. Tell me why I am always alone"
breathe in water,Somehow the days and the nights are all the same. I can't tell the time I forget their names. When I am without you. And I'm spinning around like a satellite. With daze in my head I can't abide. When I'm away from you. To show how much you mean to me. I'd give up my gravity. I'd walk the surface of the sea. To find where you would be. I'd breathe in water. And drown myself in you. I'd breathe in water. Dive myself in you. I'd breathe in water. If you asked me to. Breathe in water. Somehow I feel so lost with homeless heart. I've nowhere to run I've nowhere to hide. When I'm missing you. But I chase the dark clouds from my eyes. Send them away like butterflies. When I think about you. To show how much you mean to me. I've erased my memory. To walk the surface of the sea. To be where you would be. I'd breathe in water. And drown myself in you. I'd breathe in water. Dive myself in you. I'd breathe in water. If you asked me to. Breathe in water. This is what I can do. What woman can do. This is all that I feel. And what I feel is real. This is what I have prayed. For this love in my way. I breathe in water. Can breathe in water
breathing,I can't count. Stars in the sky. Or climb the mountains. I can't even swim all the seas. But I know. Absence is unfair. Nothing can replace what I miss. 'Cause I'm breathing.

Like the north needs the south. The wind needs the clouds. To all of these reasons of life. I need you. To change the wrong. To become true. And to take me to where I belong. 'Cause I'm breathing. Far away from you. And every second feels like thousands more without you. I'm breathing. For this love to live. Believe that one day life will take me there beside you. I'm breathing. Breathing there beside you. There beside you. Breathing. Far away from you. And every second feels like thousands more without you. I'm breathing. For this love to live. And I will keep believing one day life will take me. Beside you.

over their walls,"No way they can try to keep me here. Locked inside a world of hate and nasty lies. No this darkness has no hold on me. See the sky light up when my love starts to fly. See my love fly right over their walls. See my love fly right over their walls. No one here can try and cut my wings. I've got my love out there waiting just for me. No chains or crosses, they can't keep me in. Tears turn into salt as they fall down to the sea. See my love fly right over their walls. See my love fly right over their walls. Some and steel wont' stop me, I will set you free. Across this world I'll follow you. Just raise your head and see. Love is so much stronger, and I believe in what I know. I will follow your desire, wherever you may go. See my love fly right over their walls. See my love fly right over their walls."
painted,I can't seize the river from running to the sea. I can't seize the thunder from shouting so angrily. I don't have the power to gather seven seas. When I can't seize the fire inside me. Painted like a tattoo. Forbidden like a taboo. This feeling I can't undo. I don't know if you feel it too. Painted like a tattoo. Forbidden like a taboo. A feeling I have for you. Stop it if I wanted to. I can't fight the fever from burning secretly. I can't fight the hour from going without asking me. I know not to shudder this desire easily. Cause I can't fight the fire inside of me. Painted like a tattoo. Forbidden like a taboo. This feeling I can't undo. I don't know if you feel it too. Painted like a tattoo. Forbidden like a taboo. The love is waiting for you. What am I supposed to do?. Painted like a tattoo. Forbidden like a taboo. This feeling I have for you. Stop it if I wanted to. Just like the war against nature. To never dream of you wherever. Cause I have no power to try. The power to try. I can't stop the fire inside of me
rain,"Waves of reality. Lifting me unexpectedly. Looking inside to see. Visions of you and me. Confide my heart to you. Blindly erase my every doubt. Surrender myself to you. For passion I've lived without. Rain. In the mystery. Waking all of my dreams suddenly. Oh, rain. Tears of ecstasy. Falling into the arms that they say I'd strayed. Helplessly falling again. Carelessly give my heart away. Unlucky?. Yes I have been. 'Cause love just never stays. Is a heart made to break?. Is there in love an addiction?. I don't know how long it takes. Before another burn. Rain. In the mystery. Waking all of my dreams suddenly. Oh, rain. Tears of ecstasy. Falling into the arms that they say I'd strayed. Rain down on me. Gently take me to where I should be. Oh, rain. Tears of ecstasy. Falling into the arms that they say I'd strayed."
saviour,"Somewhere between my sleep. Somewhere beneath my skin. In places I can't see. Something is known to be a sin. Hiding inside my eyes. Burning from deep within. Something that needs a lie. Trying to turn into a sin. refrain:. Rescue me before I lose control. Rescue me from this fire in my soul. There's only you who can stop me from falling. I need a saviour, need my saviour. Rescue me before I lose my head. Rescue me from the sight of regret. Cause only your love can stop me from wanting. I need a saviour, you're my saviour. Knocking behind my door. Asking to be let in. Something I have ignored. Wanting to be a sin. It's been around for so long. And waiting to begin. I know that it's so wrong. Can't let it be a sin. refrain"
secret of the sea,Callin 'cross the blue. It's all I do. One day you'll come back to me. It's a secret of the sea. I'll always love you. Always. I see. Floating on the ocean. Somewhere under the sun. Your golden skin. In cypress and blue. I hear. Waves that come rolling in. Fleetness of wings. A sound is missing. A sign from you. Callin 'cross the blue. It's all I do. One day you'll come back to me. It's a secret of the sea. I'll always love you. Always. I may never know. Where you did go. Whatever took you from here. On these currents that run deep. I'll lways love you. Always. We would. Sail into that big sky. Forget about the time. On the wind we would ride. Watchin' wild birds sweep and glide. I'll linger just a little more. Drifting on a foreign shore. Spend my nights. Waiting out the tides. Callin 'cross the blue. It's all I do. One day you'll come back to me. It's a secret of the sea. I'll always love you. I may never know. Where you did go. Whatever took you from here. On these currents taht run deep. I'll always love you. Always. . .

snow on the sahara,"Only tell me that you still want me here. When you wander off out there. To those hills of dust and hard winds that blow. In that dry white ocean alone Lost out in the desert. you are lost out in the desert. But to stand with you in a ring of fire. I'll forget the days gone by. I'll protect your body and guard your soul. From mirages in your sight. Lost out in the desert. If your hopes scatter like the dust across your track. I'll be the moon that shines on your path. The sun may blind our eyes, I'll pray the skies above. for snow to fall on the Sahara. If that's the only place where you can leave your doubts. I'll hold you up and be your way out. And if we burn away, I'll pray the skies above for snow to fall on the Sahara. Just a wish and I will cover your shoulders. With veils of silk and gold. When the shadows come and darken your heart. Leaving you with regrets so cold. Lost out in the desert. If your hopes scatter like the dust across your track. I'll be the moon that shines on your path. The sun may blind our eyes, I'll pray the skies above. for snow to fall on the Sahara. If that's the only place where you can leave your doubts. I'll hold you up and be your way out. And if we burn away, I'll pray the skies above for snow to fall on the Sahara."
something sublime,"Life heals and bruises. Defends and abuses. Stares like a witness. A teacher, a temptress. From the east to the west. I try my very best. My mother's secret. I learn not to forget. To walk the road in my rhythm. Put my faith in the hands of time. Everything comes for a reason. And life is something sublime. To live with courage and wisdom. Always keep my head up high. Everything comes with a reason. And await is something sublime. The further that I go. The lesser that I know. Time can be a foe. Or a friend that's makes you grow. I heard a secret. Learn not to forget. To walk the road in my rhythm. Put my faith in the hands of time. Everything comes for a reason. And life is something sublime. To live with courage and wisdom. Always keep my head up high. Everything comes with a reason. And await is something sublime..."
still reminds me,I cut off my hair. put some red in every nail on my feet. I think its pretty... Repainted all the rooms. got a cat that i named June obviously. I think she's happy... friends threw some parties. and to them all there's not one that i miss. and I..... try to spend some times with some body new. but everyone still reminds me of you. I try to play some songs that change my point of view. but every song still reminds me of you. I dance on walking. listen to the people talk on the street. I dont feel lonely. I saw some movies. but your face kept coming back on the screen. I think im crazy. can't make decisions. I could use some more distractions today. and I..... try to spend my time with somebody new. but everyone still reminds me of you. I try to play some songs that change my point of view. but every song still reminds me of you. I wonder where did I go wrong. that made you go. oh how I hate to feel alone. somebody new. still reminds me of you. somebody new. still reminds me of you.
tears of sorrow,"Ego lies in human nature. Scars the face in every one of us. What's mine is mine. What's yours is yours. It seems like we forget about the heaven's floor. Set a wider gap between us. We build up walls without no shame. We turn away. If you're not one of us. But I thought, there's one color in our blood. c/o. We run around in circles. Why not reach for a truth eternal. Living life that's so superficial. We'll drown in the tears of sorrow. Greed demands our full attention. We only live for our own gain it seems. What's mine is mine. What's yours is yours. I fear we'll lose the faith we ignore. Now look around to find an answer. The truth it comes as no surprise. You're not alone, you're any one of us. I'm not blind to the mirror of our lives. We run around in circles. Why not reach for a truth eternal. Living life that's so superficial. We'll drown in the tears of sorrow. We run around in circles. Why not reach for a truth eternal. Living live that's so superficial. We'll drown in the tears of sorrow. (bridge). Around in circles. A truth eternal. So superficial. We'll drown in the tears of sorrow. We run around in circles. Why not reach for a truth eternal. Living life that's so superficial. We'll drown in the tears of sorrow. We run around in circles. Oohhhh. Living life that's so superficial. We'll drown in the tears of sorrow. ."
undress me,"When I can't see right in your eyes. When I'm surrounded in the craziness of time. When you're understanding, is trying hard to stand still. When I wear layers of my pride, you should. Undress me, undress me. Unlock this chain and set me free. Remind me to be myself. Undress me, undress me. Unleash my heart and make me see. When I become someone else. Whenever I'm trapped in this tide. When I forgotten that there is you and I. When your persuasion is fighting in a blindfold. when I wear my bad moods to my mouth, you should. Undress me, undress me. Unlock this chain and set me free. Remind me to be myself, myself. Undress me, undress me. Unleash my heart and make me see. When I become someone else. Like a rose without its thorn. Like a bird without a song. Like the fire without the flame. If there's a painless love, we wouldn't be the same. Undress me, undress me. Unlock this chain and set me free. Remind me to be myself, my self. Undress me, undress me. Unleash my heart and make me see. When I become someone else. Undress me, undress me. Unlock this chain and set me free. Remind me to be myself. Undress me, undress me. Unleash my heart and make me see"
want you to want me,"I'm here give me a glance, been following you like a shadow. This is how I spent my time dreaming about our days tomorrow. Another day has gone bye another moon another sun. I can wait for you my love. Don't want to do any harm. just find a gate to your attention. Sometimes I walk away coz I know that we can't ever be together. Sometimes I close my mind I can't keep this love for myself any longer. Somehow I have to find the right time to say that. I want you to want me, Even in my dreams. I hope yo know who I am through all the letters I have sent you. I know I'm not the only one wanting and dreaming about you. Two different world between us, you're on the spotlights far from my touch. I can't wait here forever. For a sign from your eyes. the magic I wish I could have. Should've walked away coz I knew that we can't ever be together. Should've closed my mind should've known that this love can't go any further. Should've stopped myself from this dream. coz life will never want you to want me. even in my dreams. In my dreams."
