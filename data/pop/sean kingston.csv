Cau gunshot a be like drum pan weh mi come from. And it's the same ol' story. We don't give a damn about your guts and glory. [Chorus: Sean Kingston].

You were known for having Laffy Taffy. We called you candy(candy). You had braids like Brandy. Which my momma would braid. Then we'd go in the house and drink your grandmama's Kool-Aid. Remember school days when we caught the bus there. And I thought I was ballin' because i payed your bus fare. On the way home. I'd protect you from danger. Make sure you wasn't kidnapped or harrassed by some strangers. Then I promised you if I made it out the hood. You would be good. Living life like you should. (Chorus). She's my ghetto girl (ghetto girl). She's been living in a ghetto world (ghetto world). I bet she never met a guy like me (guy like me). I want to take her on a shopping spree (shopping spree).

That promise I haven't forgot. As soon as I get time imma go back to my block (do what). And see my candy girl (yes yes). My candy girl. Candy girl you are the sweetest thing in a man's world. My ghetto queen. Imma drape you in jewels and bling (bling). Spend all my green. on everything to fufill your dreams (Fo' Sho'). She sad no Mann baby all I want is you.

hope is a river,"[Sean Kingston:]. Hope is a river, a stream of. Casting your fears away, the sky. [B.o.B:]. Shouts out to the underdogs who. Put their favorite artists on the walls and. Can never get enough of one song. So it plays and it plays all day long. Cause all the pain outside they don't wanna see. So they write songs constantly. Cause a doctor or a lawyer they don't wanna be. And I ask do you really have grow up just to be what you wanna be?. So shouts out to the mc's and the divas. And the singers and the prom queens. And the folks who don't ever get invited to the party. But somehow be the first on the scene. To the folks who just wanna be free. Fuck all of that YouTube, young, you can't see. Ask them when's the last time they had a dream. Cause every river leads to the sea, to the sea. [Sean Kingston:]. Hope is a river that runs random, a stream of floating desires. Casting your fears away, as it float above the skies, the skies. Where your worries will drown out. You imagine how it would be right now. Casting your fears away as it float above the skies, the skies. Hope is a river (hope is a river, hope is a river). Hope is a river (hope is a river, hope is a river). Hope is a river, of dreams run free, so be real, real, real, to be real. And I pray for the good days, for the world to be a better place. Cause I know one day, be a better way, everyone could have a getaway. Where we go into a place where there's love in hearts now, hearts now, hearts now. And I know that one day will be away from the gun play. Cause somehow all the pain got a soon change. Take away all the pain and the hate til it's love now. The world needs a big change and we need it right now. [Sean Kingston:]. Hope is a river that runs random, a stream of floating desires. Casting your fears away, as it float above the skies, the skies. Where your worries will drown out. You imagine how it would be right now. Casting your fears away as it float above the skies, the skies. Hope is a river (hope is a river, hope is a river). Hope is a river (hope is a river, hope is a river).

Stars like the diamond: shining, shining.. Getting higher like a bonfire baby, yeah we got it (we got it). Gonna light it in the street, we gon light it, yea we just that hot.. Getting higher like a bonfire baby, yeah we got it (we got it).. Gonna want it till the sunrise; tell `em, that we just don`t stop.. Off the meter, off the meter,. We gonna shut it down We gonna burn it up. Off the meter, this night`s a heater,. Catch the fever, so off the meter.. Off the meter, off the meter,. We gonna shut it down We gonna burn it up. Off the meter, this night`s a heater,. Catch the fever, so off the meter. It`s a dream, like I found an oasis,. The way the sky`s so still like a painting,. The way the night`s so real,. I can taste it, baby give me more: I`m craving, craving.. I don`t want this time to end,. So hey DJ press play again and. Take us back to the beginning,. And the world keeps spinning, spinning.. Getting higher like a bonfire baby, yeah we got it (we got it). Gonna light it in the street, we gon light it, yea we just that hot.. Getting higher like a bonfire baby, yeah we got it (we got it).. Gonna want it till the sun rise, tell `em, that we just don`t stop.. Off the meter, off the meter,. We gonna shut it down We gonna burn it up. Off the meter, this night`s a heater,.

Stars like the diamond: shining, shining.. Getting higher like a bonfire baby, yeah we got it (we got it). Gonna light it in the street, we gon light it, yea we just that hot.. Getting higher like a bonfire baby, yeah we got it (we got it).. Gonna want it till the sunrise; tell `em, that we just don`t stop.. Off the meter, off the meter,. We gonna shut it down We gonna burn it up. Off the meter, this night`s a heater,. Catch the fever, so off the meter.. Off the meter, off the meter,. We gonna shut it down We gonna burn it up. Off the meter, this night`s a heater,. Catch the fever, so off the meter. It`s a dream, like I found an oasis,. The way the sky`s so still like a painting,. The way the night`s so real,. I can taste it, baby give me more: I`m craving, craving.. I don`t want this time to end,. So hey DJ press play again and. Take us back to the beginning,. And the world keeps spinning, spinning.. Getting higher like a bonfire baby, yeah we got it (we got it). Gonna light it in the street, we gon light it, yea we just that hot.. Getting higher like a bonfire baby, yeah we got it (we got it).. Gonna want it till the sun rise, tell `em, that we just don`t stop.. Off the meter, off the meter,. We gonna shut it down We gonna burn it up. Off the meter, this night`s a heater,.

ordinary girl,"It felt great when I met you, something to remember. Body looking right, cool like in December. We should take a flight, one way wherever. ‘Cause your eyes take me away. You're like an angel in the sky, you got wings. When you arrive it's like a midnight dream. And I can't lie, you got that tease. And shorty please don't walk away. Girl, you're different from the girls I see. Diamond in the rough, your smile takes me away. So many girls, it's hard for me to choose. No matter where you go I'm stuck on you. Oh, it's so hard to look away. ‘Cause you're no ordinary girl. She got that thing, you can't deny. Something about your aura says. That you're no ordinary girl. Exceptional, one of a kind. And when we wake up in the morning and we look outside. It was the same every day after you walked by. She ain't an ordinary girl, not an ordinary girl. Girl you are the one, I can tell by over. Girl, you shine bright, brighter than my nightlight"

your sister,I was just walking out school. I saw this girl gettin off the train. We exchanged numbas and went on a couple dates. At first everything was cool. Until i meet her sista laren. Got introduced to each other and then everything. changed. I wanted a piece of that forbidden fruit. But my homies said to stay away. But I'm 17 what you expect me to do. I guess we'll charge it as a part of the date. If I'm wrong oh I don't want to be right. I kissed your sister last night. It ain't my fault. I guess your sister's my type. If I'm wrong oh I don't want to be right. I kissed your sister last night. It ain't my fault. I guess your sister's my type. Now I'm on the telephone talking. With laren but her sisters on the other line. But i can't help my self Cuz laren too fine. And I know this may be wrong but it feels so right. Her sister is nice but laren is more like sugar and. spice. [Bridge]. I wanted a piece of that forbidden fruit. But my homies said to stay away. But I'm 17 what you expect me to do. I guess we'll charge it as a part of the date. [Chorus]. If I'm wrong oh I don't want to be right. I kissed your sister last night. It ain't my fault. I guess your sister's my type. If I'm wrong oh I don't want to be right. I kissed your sister last night. It ain't my fault. I guess your sister's my type
