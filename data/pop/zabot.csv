part of me (feat. jonny rose),Come on let me take you away from all the drama tonight. I know a place we can go. Where everything will turn out alright. Where you can open up. And tell me all your stories. I'm losing touch. And I need your glory. Hey! Don't I know you. From somewhere in a dream. Hey! Don't I know you. You're the other part of me. You're always a part of me (Always a part of me). You're always a part of me. You're always a part of me (Always a part of me). You're always a part of me. A part of me. Every time the tears fall I will be the one who is there. You got me waiting till the last call. Just so I can capture your stare. Want you to open up. And tell me all your stories. I'm losing touch. And I need your glory. Hey! Don't I know you. From somewhere in a dream. Hey! Don't I know you. You're the other part of me. You're always a part of me (Always a part of me). You're always a part of me. You're always a part of me (Always a part of me). You're always a part of me. A part of me
