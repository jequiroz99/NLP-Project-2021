when i was a little girl,Steadfast forecast this. Was always meant to be. Sent down by the angels. Heartbreak can't fade. All the plans that were made. By a baby in a manger. Bright light so bright. It was shining like a north star. Answer to a prayer. How could I have known. That you would come along. When I was a little girl. I wondered who I'd give all my love to. I asked santa who he'd recommend. It's hard to believe I was so innocent. As a little girl looking at the world. Didn't know that love could break me. I was lying in my tears on the ground. Couldn't see where god would take me. Here I am now looking at you. Got me thinking that love could save me. How could I have known. That you would come along. When I was a little girl. I wondered who I'd give all my love to. I asked santa who he'd recommend. It's hard to believe I was so innocent. When I was a little girl. I had love at the top of my wish list. All my dreams were so unlimited. It's hard to believe I was so innocent. Why do you feel so much like home to me. (home to me). Why do you feel so much like home to me. When I was a little girl.

All my dreams were so unlimited. It's hard to believe I was so innocent. Why do you feel so much like home to me

You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh. You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh. You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh. [Bridge]. You try to sneak it, hide it and seek it. Put it in the past, try to antique it. Dirty secrets, you tried to clean it. Put one over fast but you can't bleach it. [Chorus]. You see this finger wagging, wagging at you. The naughty, naughty things you do. You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, hid it. You see this finger wagging, wagging at you. The naughty, naughty things you do. You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, admit it.

These are a few of my favorite things. Still rollin' cause the ""Sound Of Music"". Im nothing better than a great big huge hit. You know I'd pay you just to let me run, dance, and sing. I know im living the ""E"" ticket dream. For a girl from O.C., it's almost unheard of. So I wanna thank you all so much for the love (especially my girlfriends). Pharrell on repeat, make a hurricane in Miami. Working with him, im gonna get myself another Grammy. I got the L.A.M.B., and he's rocking the Ice Creams. Blend it together, something fresh and kinda inbetween. Remember music is something that I love. And I don't really give a fuck. The music don't come in no color.

But you end up in good hands. In the fancy British nation. You were the chosen. You're not imposing. The Browns want you there. Don't you want to be that bear. With the red hat he wears that makes him shine. One thing about me. I'll be there for the team. I'll do anything to protect my people's dreams. And if the earth just finds me wandering 'round. You know my soul will rise up and keep on shining. [Pharrell Williams]. (Shine!). When you were trying to get home. (Shine!). When you don't want to be alone. (Shine!). Look at yourself in the mirror. That's your way home. (Shine! Shine! Shine! Shine! Shine!). (Shine!). When you were trying to get home. (Shine!). And all your friends at home. (Shine!). Look at yourself in the mirror. That's your way home. Now go!. Everybody is the same inside. But you don't wanna go home. Just like a little bear was alone. Hey if he feel right it ain't wrong. You just want to shine. You just want to shine. You just want to shine. You just want to shine"

winter wonderland,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening. In the lane, snow is glistening. A beautiful sight. We're happy tonight. Walking in a winter wonderland. Gone away is the bluebird. Here to stay is a new bird. He sings a love song. As we go along. Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman. Then pretend that he is Parson Brown. He'll say, Are you married?. We'll say, No man. But you can do the job. When you're in town. Later on, we'll conspire. As we dream by the fire. To face unafraid. The plans that we've made. Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman. And pretend that he's a circus clown. We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman. Until the other kids knock him down. When it snows, ain't it thrilling. Though your nose gets a chilling. We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way. Walking in a winter wonderland. We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way. Walking in a winter wonderland. We'll be walking. We'll be talking. In a winter wonderland"
wonderful life,haven’t thought of you for years you know. Your memory seems to come and go. Our time meant so much to me. Now you can’t be found. You were the first to want me. The first to love me. The first to need me. Who was the last to know you?. The last to love you?. The last to hold you?. It’s a wonderful wonderful life. It’s a wonderful wonderful life. It’s a wonderful wonderful life. Such a wonderful wonderful life. I thought of you again today. Reminded me how with time I’ve changed. If you only knew what you gave to me. Now you can’t be found. You were the first I trusted. I learned what love is. When we were just kids. When did you get so lost?. And how could you think you’d be better off?. It’s a wonderful wonderful life. Why’d you have to say goodbye?. It’s a wonderful wonderful life. Such a wonderful wonderful life. Thank you for those special moments. You will always be here in my mind. Did you know you changed my life?. I’m thankful for that time. I’m thankful for that time. I’m thankful for that time. It’s a wonderful wonderful life. Why’d you have to say goodbye?. It’s a wonderful wonderful life. I’m asking why but I’ll never know. It’s a wonderful wonderful life. Why’d you have to say goodbye?. It’s a wonderful wonderful life. Such a wonderful wonderful life. It’s a wonderful wonderful life. Such a wonderful wonderful life
you make it feel like christmas,"I want to thank the storm that brought the snow. Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow. But I wanna thank you, baby. You make it feel like Christmas. It barely took a breath to realize. We're gonna be a classic for all time. I wanna thank you, baby. You make it feel like Christmas. Sweet gingerbread made with molasses.
