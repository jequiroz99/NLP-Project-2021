inner ninja,"Ninja? You're a ninja? Get out of here, you're a ninja!. Yes, I am a ninja. I read the rules before I broke 'em. I broke the chains before they choked me out. Now I pay close attention. Really learn the code. I learned to read the map before I hit the road. Hey yo, I know you never heard this before. But I'd rather lose a fight than miss the war. And I ain't wishing competition or fishin' for it. I'm just living in the system, conditions are poor. I've been lost in the rhythm and misinformed. Too many late nights hittin' the liquor store. Too many bad decisions, half assed attempts. No sweat, no fear, no blood, no tears. I go hard and I ain't makin' up no excuse. I'm overdue, I don't do what I'm supposed to do. Cause you can think about it man, we're supposed to lose. It ain't all picture perfect, ocean views. No, I was a first class rookie. Takin' out bullies in my all black hoodie. Man of mystery, you know the history. Get it or forget it, cause poof, I'm outta here. I read the rules before I broke 'em. I broke the chains before they choked me out. And I pay close attention. Really learn the code. I learned to read the map before I hit the road. (But we say). Nobody's gonna see me comin'. Nobody's gonna hear a sound. No matter how hard they tryin'. No stoppin' me since I've found. My inner ninja. Hey yo, I've been high and I've been real low. I've been beaten and broken but I healed though. So many ups and downs, roughed up and clowned. We all got problems, but we deal though. I'm tryin' to do better now, find my inner peace. Learn my art form, and find my inner Chi. When my backs on the wall, I don't freeze up. Nah, I find my inner strength and I re-up. Here we go, I know I've never been the smartest or wisest. But I realize what it takes. Never dwell in the dark cause the sun always rises. But gotta make it to the next day. It's a feeling that you get in your lungs when you run. Like you're runnin' outta air and your breath won't come. And you (uh) wheezin', gotta keep it movin'. Find that extra (uhn) and push your way through it. I've had bad habits but I dropped em, I dropped em. I've had opponents but I knocked them out. I climbed the highest mountains. I swum the coldest seas. There ain't a thing I've faced that's been too much for me. (but we say). Nobody's gonna see me comin'. Nobody's gonna hear a sound. No matter how hard they tryin'. Nobody's gonna bring me down. Nobody's gonna see me comin'. Nobody's gonna hear a sound. No matter how hard they tryin'. No stoppin' me since I've found. My inner ninja. I've had bad habits but I dropped em, I dropped em. I've had opponents but I knocked them out. I climbed the highest mountains. I swum the coldest seas. There ain't a thing I've faced that's been too much for me. Man, that was dope!. You think?. What're you, like, a third degree black belt?. Actually, I'm not even in karate but I've found... my inner ninja!"

thinking of me,Winter time in London are you making plans. Are you still rocking converse with your old Raybans. If you're sitting in the places that we used to be. Or if you're somewhere listening to Bob Marley. Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me. Do you still pick up the seashells on that pebble beach. Remember when that crab came up and pinched your feet. When that old guy gave us all those drinks for free. Do you still get knocked down by that Bacardi breeze. Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me. (Oh yes you are). Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me. (oh uh yeh yeah). No point regretting that it didn't last. No point regretting that it went so fast. Time that we had was like sand in our hand. But when I look behind. I'm so glad that you were mine. I remember taking you home on that 86. Standing in your doorway where we used to kiss. Then your Dad came out and chased me down the street. If you remember just how scared I used to be. Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me. I know wherever you go. that you'll be thinking about me now. I know wherever you go. that you'll be thinking about me. Bumped into Irene down in waterloo. She told me that you got yourself somebody new. She said you musta like him cos he's oh so nice. But I remember that you like a pinch of spice. Well I. I know wherever you go. that you'll be thinking about me now. I know wherever you go. that you'll be thinking about me now. I know wherever you go. that you'll be thinking about me now
this one's for the girls,"This one's for the girl that I see at the coffee shop. Who knows my name and looks so hot. I always get an extra shot and smile for free. And this is for the girl, so sugar sweet. At the bus stop waiting for the 23. She's so shy, I wish she'd notice me. This one's for the girls x2. This one's for the girl in the pub sitting next to me. She spends too much on the fruit machine. She drinks me under the table every time. And what about the one from around the way?. She's not all that, but that's okay. She talks to tree's but still, she blows my mind. Woah woah woah ohh. There's nothing better. Woah woah woah ohh. This one's for the girls. I can't stop thinking about you. This one's for the girls. Life would really suck without you. This one's for the girls, girls, girls. All around the world. I love to love to love, love to love those girls. And this one's for the girl at the club in the trilby hat. Standing up on the bar shaking this and that. Even though she's got that big exam at 8. And here's to all those office girls. From the secretaries to the CEO. Baby when you coming home?. Coz I can't wait. Woah woah woah ohh. There's nothing better. Woah woah woah ohh. This one's for the girls.
