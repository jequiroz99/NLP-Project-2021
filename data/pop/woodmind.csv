fairytales,"Lipstick stains all over the place. This is how we start the day. You're scratching my back. as I'm kissing your neck. This is how we feel today. Oh it's a tragedy to keep the fantasy. Maybe she's the reason why there's fairytles. Maybe she's the reason why I'm on my knees. Maybe she's a lot of trouble and I've failed. Baby slow down, oh baby slow down. Good things we cannot erase. So take that look from off your face. You think about clothes as I tickle your toes. This is how we should behave. Lying on the bathroom floor. Laughing like I've never seen before. When hearts collide in the summertime. There's just one more thing to say. Oh, Maybe she's the reason why there's fairytles. Maybe she's the reason why I'm on my knees. Maybe she's a lot of trouble and I've failed. Baby slow down, oh baby slow down. And we won't find each other in someone else's face. And we won't find each other in someone else's taste. Don't need to try so hard slow down. Maybe she's the reason why there's fairytles. maybe she's the reason why I'm on my knees. Maybe she's a lot of trouble and I've failed. Baby slow down, oh baby slow down"
"please, please","She is one of a kind. But she was wasting time. With someone who didn't care. About her feelings, that's not fair. But baby I'll take you home tonight. Just calm down it's gonna be alright. If you are feeling down I'll cheer you up. Just take a deep breath before you fall in love. I'm sorry for the words I said. I'll take it all back. Baby I'll give you all I have. Cause I don't wanna see you sad. Please, please don't cry I'll be by your side. In all those lonely nights. She looks so pretty today. That I won't ever go away. The taste of your breath. The way she laughs it keeps me awake we're going so fast. Sometimes living life gets hard to do. And nobody knows what you've gone through. If you are feeling down, I'll cheer you up. Just take a deep breath before you fall in love. I'm sorry for the words I said. I'll take it all back. Baby I'll give you all I have. Cause I don't wanna see you sad. Please, please don't cry I'll be by your side. In all those lonely nights. Lets take a walk outside. The sun has come in time. To heal the wounds. Of your broken heart. It's all that's left to do my love. I'm sorry for the words I said. I'll take it all back. Baby I'll give you all I have. Cause I don't wanna see you sad. Please, please don't cry I'll be by your side. In all those lonely nights. I'm sorry for the words I said. I'll take it all back. Baby I'll give you all I have. Cause I don't wanna see you sad. Please, please don't cry I'll be by your side. In all those lonely nights"
