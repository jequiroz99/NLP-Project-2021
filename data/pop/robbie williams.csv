angels,I sit and wait. Does an angel contemplate my fate. And do they know. The places where we go. When we're grey and old. 'cause I've been told. That salvation lets their wings unfold. So when I'm lying in my bed. Thoughts running through my head. And I feel that love is dead. I'm loving angels instead. And through it all she offers me protection. A lot of love and affection. Whether I'm right or wrong. And down the waterfall. Wherever it may take me. I know that life won't break me. When I come to call. she won't forsake me. I'm loving angels instead. When I'm feeling weak. And my pain walks down a one way street. I look above. And I know I'll always be blessed with love. And as the feeling grows. She breathes flesh to my bones. And when love is dead. I'm loving angels instead. And through it all she offers me protection. A lot of love and affection. Whether I'm right or wrong. And down the waterfall.

my way,"And now the end is near. So I face the final curtain. My friend, I'll say it clear. I'll state my case of which I'm certain. I've lived a life that's full. I've travelled each and every highway. And more, much more than this. I did it my way. Regrets, I've had a few. But then again, too few to mention. I did what I had to do. And saw it through without exception. I planned each charted course. Each careful step along the byway. Oh, and more, much more than this. I did it my way. Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew. When I bit off more than I could chew. But through it all when there was doubt. I ate it up and spit it out. I faced it all and I stood tall. And did it my way. I've loved, I've laughed and cried. I've had my fails, my share of losing. And now as tears subside. I find it all so amusing. To think I did all that. And may I say, not in a shy way. Oh, no, no not me. I did it my way. For what is a man, what has he got. If not himself, then he has not. To say the things he truly feels. And not the words he would reveal. The record shows I took the blows. And did it my way."
back for good,"I guess now it's time for me to give up. I feel it's time. Got a picture of you beside me. I've got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup. (oh,yeah!).

I just want you back for good. Wherever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing. it. You'll be right and understood. (I want you back,I want you back for good). Unaware but underlined, I figured out this story. (no,no) It wasn't good ,no,no!. But in the corner of my mind. I celebrated glory. But that was not to be. In the twist of separation, you excelled at being free. Can't you find a little room inside for me?. Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it. I just want you back for good. Wherever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing. it. You'll be right and understood. And we'll be together, this time is forever. I'll be fighting and forever we'll be. So complete and our love. will never be uncovered again. Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it. I just want you back for good. Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing. it.

best intentions,"Every now and then I wanna feel the escape. When the depression sets in and my spirit breaks. And I go out hunting demons and they make me beg. Got me pissing in the wind, down my own damn leg. If God wrote a book 'bout everything that he's done. I'd go searching for my name, now wouldn't every one?. And you can tell me point-blank that I'm a narcissist. I'm just needing confirmation that I exist. [Chorus 1]. Please don't read my mind. I'm so scared of what you'll find. I haven't left it all behind. So much hate 'cause of all the hurt. No idea what I'm really worth. I'm holding out for peace and air time. You have to understand that my intentions are good. And everything I do I do for love. I got two little souls and I love them, man. That I'm trying to lead to the promised land. We take ego trips out to the country side. Got a big old house where we reside. And there's a big old boy with a big old gun. Stays up all night in case the weirdos come. [Chorus 2]. I had a job but I resigned. Then I had a change of mind. I will again if I'm inclined. Another moan from a millionaire. I don't know why I'm telling you 'cause you don't care. I'm holding out for peace and air time. [Outro]. I'm a little bit older but not wiser still. I was smoking marijuana, taking sleeping pills. But I get up in the morning, take the kids to school. And my other indiscretions are so miniscule. And I really pray to God it stays that way. 'Cause deep inside I think I'm still hurting. When you take your chances and you ride your luck. All you're really saying is 'I could fuck this up'. You have to understand that my intentions are good. And everything I do I do for love. I made a ton of mistakes, it's either fight or flight. But every now and then. I kinda get it right. (He kinda gets it right). I kinda get it right. (He kinda gets it right)"

My guitar is out of tune even that's highly strung. And the words we didn't say last night. Shook the world to the core. We had nothing to say last night. We'd said it all before. And I say.

Would you have preferred it. If I'd have worn the dress. Cos I say. Lonely times and lonely tears. Will fade away when you disappear. The time is right for me to stray. I'm gonna find a better day. Lonely times and lonely tears. Will fade away when you disappear. The time is right for me to stray. I'm gonna find a better day. No where to run to baby. No where to hide. I got no where to run to baby. And nowhere to hide.

ego a go go,Where were you when you stole my pride. Did you ever get the feeling that someone died. Hide away in your ivory tower. And cover me in your golden shower. Did I make you laugh when I played the clown. And was I the dog that bit you when you put it down. Break it nicely break it slow. Break it so I got no place to go. Ego a go go now you've gone solo. Living on a memory. Where you been lately. And do you still hate me. Could you offer an apology. Aaah turn away. Aaah fade to grey. Where were you when the party ended. Were you stiching up the wounds that you thought I need mending. Wonderland has crashed to the ground. The circus has gone all that's left is the clowns. Did I break your heart when I stole your thunder. Was there woodworm in the table your feet are under. Break it nicely break it slow. Break so I got no place to go. Ego a go go now you've gone solo. Living on a memory. Now you've gone stately. And yes you do hate me. Could you offer an apology. Aaah turn away. Aaah fade to grey. Aaah I hope you've strayed. Aaah and got laid. Ego a go go.

heart and i,"I hope there's a golden age. I pray for my sanity. Where we don't have to answer to anyone 'bout anything. This is not like a brochure. Flying cars and sex machines. We are all so compliant. 'cause eveything is what it seems. And it can't be the satellite. To tell you how loved you are. Or some kind of live device that holds you when you've gone too far. And I don't feel myself again. I thought I'd be fixed by now. Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow. Give me something to die for. Or design a quiet mind. Something to like mankind for. Cause we don't lie, my heart and I.. You've been bending so long now. You think it's standing up. And they line up behind you to build you up, buttercup. We can lose all meaning. Quicker than a credit card. And not everyone's healing, so try your best and don't love too hard. Cause they can't build a satellite. To tell you what's in your heart. Or some kind of live device that holds you when you've gone too far. And I don't feel myself again. I thought I'd be fixed by now. Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow. Give me something to die for. Or design a quiet mind. Something to like mankind for. Cause we don't lie, my heart and I.. Will I ever feel the waking. Naked as a lullaby. Don't ask me to explain again. I can't lie to my heart and I. And I don't feel myself again. I thought I'd be fixed by now. Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow. Give me something to die for. Or design a quiet mind. Something to like mankind for. Cause we don't lie, my heart and I.. My heart and I. My heart and I. I've been feeling so lonely. Feeling so low.

Dodgy Farah trousers that you think are smart. Married to the woman that teaches art. Married to the life, married to the school. I want to sing and dance sir, now who's the fool?. Sing and dance? You thought I was barmy. 'Settle down thingy, join the army!'. And who are you to tell me this?. The dream I want I'll have to miss. Sir is God, he's been given the right. To structure lives overnight. Now I know life's true path. Tanks and guns, that'll be a laugh. No, not me. I'm a mega civilian.. I won't lead my life riding pillion. But thanks for the advice and I'm sure it'll do. For the negative dickheads just like you. As for now, I've a different weapon. Stage and screen is about to beckon. And here I sit in first class.

hotel crazy (with rufus wainwright),"[Intro]. ""Everyone suggesting, inferring, in bold type. The idiots and actually the minority. That I'm wasted, that I'm strung out. Well, they all should be wondering why the hell I'm not! "". [Verse 1: Robbie Williams]. I'm gonna speak my truth, I think I'm losing it. Feel kinda liberated just a little bit. And I'm a Big Mac short of a Happy Meal. Not sure what to say or how to feel. [Chorus: Rufus Wainwright]. Checking into Hotel Crazy. Leaving all my bags in the lobby. The velvet stairs don't make a sound. As we're hitting up to a higher ground. Holding on to something that's gone in the wind. Holding on to something that's gone in the wind. [Verse 2: Robbie Williams]. I've got the right to vote and I can reproduce. And I can tell a lie just like I tell the truth. I have crazy thoughts, I do crazy deeds. I have special times for my special needs. I present myself as a normal dude. Look you in the eye when I talk to you. Just a touch of the old socio. Is it empathy? I guess I'll never know. [Interlude]. ""It's sensational, I really only care about me. Is this the end of the road? I want a new road. And the only thing that they should be checking out is my ass"". [Chorus: Rufus Wainwright]. Checking into Hotel Crazy. Leaving all my bags in the lobby. The velvet stairs don't make a sound. As we're hitting up to a higher ground. [Bridge: Rufus Wainwright]. Checking into Hotel Crazy. Do disturb me. Gonna make you mad. Gonna make you sad. Gonna make you all of it here. [Chorus: Rufus Wainwright]. Holding on to something that's gone in the wind.

Wave goodbye. Wish me well... You've got to let me go. Are we human?. Or are we dancers?. My sign is vital. My hands are cold. And I'm on my knees. Looking for the answers. Are we human?. Or are we dancers?. Will your system be alright. When you dream of home tonight?. There is no message we're receiving. Let me know is your heart still beating. Are we human?. Or are we dancers?. My sign is vital. My hands are cold. And I'm on my knees. Looking for the answers. You got to let me know. Are we human?. Or are we dancers?. My sign is vital. My hands are cold. And I'm on my knees.

it was a very good year,When I was seventeen. It was a vary good year. It was a very good year for small town girls and soft summer nights. We'd hide from the lights. On the village green. When I was seventeen. When I was twentyone. It was a very good year. It was a very good year for city girls. Who lived up the stair. With all the perfume hair. And it came undone. When I was twentyone. When I was thirtyfive. It was a vary good year. It was a very good year for blue blooded girls of indipendant means. We'd hide in limousenes. There chouffers would drive. When I was thirtyfive. But now the days are short. I'm in the autumn of the year. And now I think of my life as village wine from fine old keggs. From the brim to the dreggs. It poured sweet and clear. It was a very good year.
it's de-lovely,"I feel a sudden urge to sing. The kind of ditty that invokes the Spring. So, control your desire to curse while I crucify the verse. This verse you've started seems to me the ""Tin Pan-tithesis"" of melody. So to spare you all the pain, I'll skip the darn thing and sing the refrain. Mi-mi-mi-mi, re-re-re-re, do-so-mi-do-la-si. The night is young, the skies are clear. So if you wanna go walkin', dear. It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. I understand the reason why. You're sentimental, 'cause so am I. It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. You can tell at a glance what a swell night this is for romance. You can hear, dear Mother Nature murmuring low ""Let yourself go"". So please be sweet, my chickadee. And when I kiss ya, just say to me. ""It's delightful, it's delicious, it's delectable, it's delirious,. It's dilemma, it's de limit, it's deluxe, it's de-lovely"". Time marches on and soon it's plain. You've won my heart and I lost my brain. It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. Life seems so sweet that we decide. It's in the bag to get unified. It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. See the crowd in that church. See the proud parson plopped on his perch. Get the sweet beat of that organ sealing our doom. Here goes the groom – boom!. How they cheer and how they smile. As we go galopping down the aisle. It's divine, dear, it's de-vene, dear, it's de-wunderbar, it's de-victory. It's de-velop, it's de-vinner, it's de-voix, it's de-lovely. The night is tired and so we take. The few hours off to eat wedding cake. It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. It feels so fine to be a bride. And how's the groom while he's slightly fried. It's divineful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. To the pop of champagne off we hop in our plush little plane. Till a bright light through the darkness cosily calls Niagara Falls. Well, my love, our day's complete. What a beautiful bridal suite. It's de-reamy, it's de-rousy, it's de-reverie, it's de-rhapsodie. It's de-regal, it's de-royal, it's de-ritz, it's de-lovely. We settle down as man and wife. To solve the riddle called married life.

jelousy,"At dead of night, when strangers roam. The streets in search of anyone who'll take them home. I lie alone, the clock strikes three. And anyone who wanted to could contact me.

killing me,"I don't mind the abuse. It fills in time when I'm not much use. But it's killing me, killing me slowly. They all say I'm too restless. But words cut deep when you're defenceless. And they're killing me, but kiling me slowly. There was a time when we were fine and I could. tolerate you. I do believe that you should leave 'cos I've grown to. hate you. Should I be weak and turn my cheek 'cos I'm scared to. fall. But I just don't know you and you don't know me at. all. I've been told that love's a celebration. But I've lost faith through frustration. And it's killing me, but killing me slowly. You paint my picture black, the joke's on me. And I don't wanna laugh. Remember the good times. Won't you bring them back someday, somehow. I don't mid feeling blue. If I could smile just like you do. And it's killing me, killing me slowly. I can't go on alone pretending nothing's wrong. Maybe I just want to belong somewhere, somehow,. somehow. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ......"
king of bloke and bird,Speak so loud. I cant hear what you say. Except for the occassional word. So fates a sentimental side. It bothers me. No longer king of bloke and bird. All of my life. Searching hard. Down in the wilds. Of love. Summon me now. Summon my life away. Summon me onto another day. A hand through the clouds. Keeps knocking me down. It's no less than I deserve. They built museums. I dont visit them. I've made enough trouble of my own. Into the night. Searching hard. Look for the light. Of love. Summon me now. Summon my life away. Summon me on to another day. Summon the evening winter waves of falling down again. I sing from the chaos in my heart. My heart. Then comes the evening. That makes life worth living. Shoving the shoes out in the light. She walks in. I can hear her
kiss me,"Im my young life I have recieved. Carolers as if it were Christmas Eve. Im disappointed and I dont know why. She gave me laughter, hope, and a sock in the eye. In my young life I know something. Now, I've never tried to create a wow. Wows are few, frustration more common. I can feel in my soul thats I game the come-on. (chorus). Kiss me with your mouth. Your love is better than wine. Kiss me with your mouth. Your love is better than wine. But wine is all I have. Will your love ever be mine?. Faces fall before my feet. Like blood onto a clean white sheet. When I grow old I wont forget. To innocence my only dept. Wow I feel so fresh today. Barefoot in the snow, to make love in the hay. The stars are bright in the abise. Now I feel his arms explode inside your kiss. (chorus). (kiss me). boom boom boom. boom boom boom. boom boom boom. boom boom boom. (cos - cos - cos- cosmic forces). boom boom boom. boom boom boom. boom boom boom. boom boom boom. boom boom boom. boom boom boom. boom boom boom. boom boom boom"

little green apples (feat. kelly clarkson),"Well, I wake up in the morning. With my hair down in my eyes. And she says 'hi'. And I hurry to the breakfast table.

And I see my morning sun. And if that's not loving me. Then all I've got to say. God didn't make little green apples. And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime. There's no such thing as Dr. Suess. Disneyland and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme. God didn't make little green apples. And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime. And when my self is feeling low. I think about your face aglow and ease my mind. Sometimes I call him up knowing he's busy. And ask if he could get away and meet me. And maybe grab a bite to eat. And he drops what he's doing. And hurry's down to meet me. And I'm always late. He sits waiting patiently and smiles when he first sees me. Because he's made that way. And if that's not loving me. Then all I've got to say. God didn't make little green apples. And it don't snow in Indianapolis when the winter comes. There's no such thing as make believe. Puppy dogs and autumn leaves, no B. B. guns. God didn't make little green apples. And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime. And when my self is feeling low. I think about your face aglow and ease my mind"
lola,I met her in a club down in old Soho. Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry-cola [LP version: Coca-Cola]. C-o-l-a cola. She walked up to me and she asked me to dance.

Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola. Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand. Why she walked like a woman and talked like a man. Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola. Well we drank champagne and danced all night. Under electric candlelight. She picked me up and sat me on her knee. And said dear boy won't you come home with me. Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy. But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola. La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola. Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola. I pushed her away. I walked to the door. I fell to the floor. I got down on my knees. Then I looked at her and she at me. Well that's the way that I want it to stay. And I always want it to be that way for my Lola. La-la-la-la Lola. Girls will be boys and boys will be girls. It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola. La-la-la-la Lola.

louise,"When he saw her getting of the bus. It seemed to wipe away the years. Her face was older, just a little rough. But her eyes were still so clear. He drank his coffee and he hurried out. Across before she walked away. Then he approached her like a little child. Too scared for what he had to say. ""Hello, Louise,. Remember me?. Now should we part. Or stay awhile?. As if we were still lovers"". She took a moment just to recognise the man she'd known so well before. And as he started to apologise. Lose any bitterness she bore. She gently put her finger on his lips. To let him know she understood. And with her suitcase standing on the floor. Embraced him like a lover would. He told louise. ""You look so good. It's just you see. You make me feel. As if we were still lovers"". It's not always true that time heals all wounds. There are wounds that you don't wanna heal. The memories of something really good. Something truly real, that you never found again. And though they talked for just a little time. Before she said she had to go. He saw the meeting as a tiny sign. That told him all he had to know. And so Louise. Waved from the bus. And as she left. She gave that smile. As if they were still lovers"

me and my monkey,"There was me and my monkey. And with his dungarees and roller blades smoking. filter tips. Reclining in the passenger seat of my super-charged. jet black Chevrolet. He had the soft-top down (he liked the wind in his. face). He said 'Son, you ever been to Vegas?' I said 'no'. He said 'that's where we're gonna go - you need a. change of pace'. And we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and. the neon signs. He said 'I left my wallet in El Segondo' and proceeded. to take two grand of mine. We made tracks to The Mandalay Bay Hotel. Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as. well?. He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a. smile he said. 'If your monkey's got that kind of money sir, then. we've got a monkey bed!'. . Me and my monkey. With a dream and a gun. I'm hoping my monkey don't point that gun at anyone. Me and my monkey. Like Butch and the Sundance Kid. Trying to understand why he did what he did. Why he did what he did. . We got the elevator, I hit the 33rd floor. We had a room up top with the panoramic views like. nothing you'd ever seen. before. He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke. He ran his little monkey fingers through yellow pages. Called up some escort services and ordered some okey. doke. Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door. In walked this big bad ass baboon into my bedroom with. three monkey whores. 'Hi! My name is Sunshine - these are my girls. Lace my palm with silver baby and oh yeah, they'll. rock your world'. So I watched pay-per-view and polished my shoes and my. gun. Was diggin' old Kurt Cobain singing 'bout lithium. There came a knock at the door and in walked Sunshine. 'What's up? You'd better get your ass in here boy,. your monkey's having too. much of a good time!'. . Me and my monkey. Drove in search of the sun. Me and my monkey. Don't point that gun at anyone. Me and my monkey. Like Billy The Kid. Trying to understand why he did what he did. Why he did what he did. . Got tickets to see Sheena Easton, the monkey was high. Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he. died. We left before encores, he couldn't sit still. Sheena was a blast baby but my monkey was ill. We went to play black-jack, kept hitting twenty three. Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at. me. Or was it my monkey? I couldn't be sure. It's not like you'd never seen a monkey in. rollerblades and dungarees before. Now don't test my patience 'cause we're not about to. run. That's a bad ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun. 'My name is Rodriguez', he says with death in his eye. 'I've been chasing you for a long time amigos, and now. your monkey's gonna die!'. Me and my monkey. Drove in search of the sun. Me and my monkey. We don' wanna kill no Mexican. But we got ten itchy fingers. One thing to declare. When the monkey is high. You do not stare. You do not stare. You do not stare. Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican stand off here. boy. And I ain't about to run. Put your gun down boy. How did I get mixed up with this fucking monkey anyhow"

And now to repeat what I said at the start. They'll need a large crowbar to break us apart. We're alone but far from blue. Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar.

meet the stars,The year before I thought of leaving. I cant remember what I did. Us in bed in Maida Vale basements. When you left. Westend winters. High heel clatters. Morning dawning. Nothing matters. When we took a cab. Back when cabs had somewhere to go. And we'd meet the stars. When stars were people you'd want to know. We were new to fame. woaooh oh oh oh. I'm so glad you came. Some of us fell by the wayside. Others had it and threw it away. Some carried on pretending. That it was not ending today. Once admired. Oh so tired. Lose it all. In the night time. And we took a cab. Back when cabs had somewhere to go. And we'd meet the stars. When stars were people you'd want to know. We were new to fame. I'm so glad I came. It took me years to find my own song. And for years I thought I'd just sing along. But the words were wrong. A tune that is true lives on and on. It will still be here when I'm gone. And we took a cab. Back when cabs had somewhere to go. And we'd meet the stars. When stars were people you'd want to know. We were new to fame. wo oho hoh. I'm so glad we came. And we'd take a cab.

And you will not be found. When it's over. It?s all over. Even if I make a sound. I'll be misunderstood. By the beautiful and good. In this city. None of it was planned. Take me by the hand.

I won't apologise. Or justified your lies. Come and find me. Tell them to me. Look me in the eyes. I'll be misunderstood. By the beautiful and good. In this city. None of this was planned.

mixed signals,"I tried your number at 9 but to no avail. Tried again at 11, got sent straight to voicemail. You said you needed a calm, quiet night alone. But that don't explain why you're not picking up the phone. Now I'm driving through the city like a bullet in my seat. And I hold my breath when I hit your street. You were restless when you told me everything was alright. One quiet night alone. If nothing is wrong. How come you're not home. [Chorus]. And it's almost 3AM. When you decide to show?. You're gonna tell me where you've been. Don't spare me details, I wanna know. What does he look like?. What does he talk like?. Thought you wanted to make this work. But you're sending me mixed signals. [Verse 2]. With lowered emotion. You greet me and I'm overcome. 'Cause your body language is speaking in another tongue. First you tell me that you needed some excitement in your life. Then you grab the handle and turn the knife. Accusations of obsessive misbehaviour. Like we ain't been down to hell and back. And made untrue. I thought that was you. [Chorus]. And it's almost 3AM. When you decide to show. You're gonna tell me where you've been. Don't spare me details, I wanna know. What does he look like?.

morning sun,How do you rate the morning sun. After a long and sleepless night. How many stars would you give to the moon. Do you see those stars from where you are. Shine on the lost and loneliest. The ones who can?t get over it. And you always wanted more than life. But now you don?t have the appetite. In a message to the troubadour. The world don?t love you anymore. Tell me how do you rate the morning sun. Stuck inside the rainbow years. And you could happen to me. ?Cause I?ve been close to where you are. I drove to places you have seen. It all seems so familiar. Like they?d been sent to kill ya. It doesn?t take an astronaut. To float into space is just a thought. The morning brings a mystery. The evening makes it history. Tell me how do you rate the morning sun. And the village drunk. Sadly passed away. It was a shame. I never knew his name. I wonder if he sat there every morning. And watched the sun rise. How do you rate the morning sun. It was just too heavy for me. And all I wanted was the world. If you are the starlet in the sun. Don?t go wasting your time. ?Cause there is no finish line. And you don?t see anything. Not even love not anything. The night could take the man from you. A sense of wonder overdue. The morning brings a mystery. The evening makes it history. Who am I to rate the morning sun

my culture,"Spoken:. I'm the sum total of my ancestors. I carry their DNA. We are representatives of a long line of people. And we carried them around either with. This long line of people.

I used to see you in my dreams. But I could not compete. Then you taught me the value. Of never losing sleep. How you sink like a home. Putting children on the street. Is it anger or sympathy. How I sail you down river?. But you must feel some disdain. Then I'll forgive you. All day long you are night. But I am vaguely right. My hearts just bleeding for you. This is a fuck you.

And saw it through without exception. I planned each charted course. Each careful step along the byway. Oh, and more, much more than this. I did it my way. Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew. When I bit off more than I could chew. But through it all when there was doubt. I ate it up and spit it out. I faced it all and I stood tall. And did it my way. I've loved, I've laughed and cried. I've had my fails, my share of losing. And now as tears subside. I find it all so amusing. To think I did all that. And may I say, not in a shy way. Oh, no, no not me. I did it my way. For what is a man, what has he got. If not himself, then he has not. To say the things he truly feels. And not the words he would reveal. The record shows I took the blows. And did it my way."
nan's song,"(R. Williams). . You said when you'd die that you'd walk. with me everyday. And I'd start to cry and say please don't talk that way. With the blink of an eye the lord came. and asked you to meet. You went to a better place but He stole you. away from me. And now she lives in heaven. But i know they let her out. To take care of me. There's a strange kind of light. Caressing me tonight. Pray silence my fears she is near. Bringing heaven down here. I miss your love I miss your touch. But I'm feeling you everyday. And I can almost here you say. ""You've come along way baby"". And now you live in heaven. But I know they let you out. To take care of me. There's a strange kind of light. In my bedroom tonight. Pray silence my fears she is near. Bring your heaven down here. You taught me kings and queens. While stroking my hair. In my darkest hour I know you are there. Kneeling down beside me. Whispering my prayer. Yes there's a strange kind of light. Caressing me tonight. Pray silence my fear. She is near. Bringing heaven down here. The next time that we meet. I will bow at her feet. And say wasn't life sweet. Then we'll prepare. To take heaven down there"

never touch that switch,"Size of which is paradoxic the only way you're gonna stop this. In the vessel there's a switch in the middle. You really shouldn't fiddle cause its toxic. Listen up 'cos it's a red light. And the pressure's blowing up tight. There's a skism in the time mechanism. There's a skism in the time mekanism. Never touch that switch. Even if you want to. You don't know what it can do.. Never touch that switch, even if you want to.. You don't know what it can do.. See the futures in the distance. I know I'm facing some resistance. Getting back within the blink of a bubble. Time machine never gives us any trouble.. There's a riot down in Shelton. Only minutes after Brixton but this city never made it on the telly. Or the rumble of the nations underbelly. Never touch that switch, even if you want to.. You don't know what it can do.. Never touch that switch, even if you want to.. You don't know what it can do.. You know you're heading for a meltdown, and you're living in a tin town. Thinking that you're gonna be somebody, living in the land of milk and honey. Listen up 'cos it's a red light, and the futures blowing up tight. There's a skism in the time mechanism, there's a skism in the time mekanism. Never touch that switch, even if you want to.

no one likes a fat pop star,"I come from a land of kebabs and curries. Second helpings - no worries. Piled up carbs upon the plate. Then one day it's too late. No breakfast, no luncheon. Just carpets I'll munch on. A thimble of self esteem. Glazed nothings for afters and absence of laughter. The saddest that I've ever been. You just can't be portly, not this side of fourty. Showbiz's a single-chinned game. Scum paparazzi and weight police. Nasties have narrowed the hall of fame. No one likes a fat pop star. Pop is a place for the thin. No one likes a fat pop star. We want to hear thin people sing!. When I get faint I chew through my restraints. It's the best meal that I've had all week. If I could eat my own words, I'd tear through the verbs. But nobody pays me to speak. No one likes a fat pop star. Pop is a place for the thin. No one wants a fat pop star. I'm sorry, we can't fit you in!. Now you've upset me - I feel like a snack!. A packet of minstrels, a pie and a nap. So whats wrong with that?. No breakfast, no luncheon. Just carpets I'll munch on. And a thimble of self esteem. Glazed nothing for afters and absence of laughter. The thinnest that I've ever been. Thank you!"
no regrets,Tell me a story. Where we all change. And we'd live our lives together. And not estranged. I didn't lose my mind it was. Mine to give away. Couldn't stay to watch me cry. You didn't have the time. So I softly slip away.... *CHORUS*. No regrets/ they don't work. No regrets now/ they only hurt. Sing me a love song. Drop me a line suppose it's just a point of view. But they tell me I'm doing fine. I know from the outside. We looked good for each other. Felt things were going wrong. When you didn't like my mother. I don't want to hate but that's. All you left me with. A bitter aftertaste and a fantasy of. How we all could live. *CHORUS*. No regrets/ they don't work. No regrets now/ they only hurt. (we've been told you stay up late). I know they're still talking. (you're far too short to carry weight). The demons in your head. (Return the videos they're late). If I could just stop hating you. (goodbye). I'd feel sorry for us instead. Remember the photographs (insane). The ones where we all laugh (so lame). We were having the time of our lives. Well thank you it was a real blast. No regrets/ they don't work. No regrets/ they only hurt. Write me a love song. Drop me a line. Suppose it's just a point of view. But they tell me I'm doing fine. Everything I wanted to be every. Time I walked away. Everytime you told me to leave. I just wanted to stay. Everytime you looked at me and. Everytime you smiled. I felt so vacant you treat me like a child. I loved the way we used to laugh. I loved the way we used to smile. Often i sit down and think of you. For a while. Then it passes and i think of. Someone else instead. I guess the love we once had is. Officially dead.

poem,"Hello sir, remember me?. I'm the man you thought I'd never be.. The boy who you reduced to tears,. The lad called ""thingy"" for six whole years.. Yeah that's right, my names bob,. The one who landed the popstars job.. The one who you told: ""Look don't touch"". The Kid who wouldn'y amount to much.. Well I'm here, and you're still there. With your fake sports car and receding hair. Dodgy, farout trousers that you think are smart. Married to the woman that teaches art. Married to the life. Married to the school. ""I want to sing and dance sir"". Now who's the fool?. Sing and dance, you thought I was barmy. ""Settle down thingy, join the army"". And who were you to tell me this. The dream I want I'll have to miss. Sir is god, he's been given the right. To structure lives overnight.. Now I know life's true path,. Tanks and guns, that'll be a laugh.. Nah, not me, I'm a mega civillian. I won't leave my life riding pillion. But thanks for the advice and I'm sure it'll do. For the negitive dickheads just like you.. As for now the different weapon. Stage and screen is about to beckon. And here I sit in first class. Bollocks sir, kiss my ass.."

road to mandalay,Save me from drowning in the sea. Beat me up on the beach. What a lovely holiday. There`s nothing funny left to say. This sombre song would drain the sun. But it won`t shine until it`s sung. No water running in the stream. The saddest place we`ve ever been. Everything I touched was golden. Everything I loved got broken. On the Road to Mandalay. Every mistake I`ve ever made. Has been rehashed and then replayed. As I got lost along the way. There`s nothing left for you to give. The truth is all that you`re left with. Twenty places then at dawn. We will die and be reborn. I like to sleep beneath the trees. Have the universe at one with me. Look down the barrel of a gun. And feel the Moon replace the Sun. Everything we`ve ever stolen. Has been lost returned or broken. No more dragons left to slay. Every mistake I`ve ever made. Has been rehashed and then replayed. As I got lost along the way. Save me from drowning in the sea. Beat me up on the beach. What a lovely holiday. There`s nothing funny left to say

You think that I'm strong you're wrong. You're wrong. I'll sing my song, my song, my song. If I did it all again I'd be a nun. The rain was never cold when I was young.

Loved up in the clubs. Of football thugs. No malice. A dicky dread locks. Boozin' off your socks. Big fish little fish. Card board box. Gimme french kiss. I'll love you from the rain. I dream of Santa Ana on the road to Mandalay. In the summertime. Where the weather is hot. In the summertime. Where the weather is hot. On my mind. On my mind. In the summertime. Where the weather is hot. In the summertime. I got shivers. Down my spine"

the 80's,"I smoked Consulate and Park Drive. Drank Newcy Brown, learned how to skive. Polo mints to hide my breath from my Mum. Did a little weed 'cause it felt like fun. Did a little speed if my friends had some. Nicked Volkswagon badges, I'm a Beastie Boys son. Me so horny, me so young, and I still get my washing done. Auntie Jo died of cancer, God didn't have an answer. Rhythm was a dancer, any room for a chancer. That's me in the corner, thanks Sir. Wore a Troop track suit, British Knights shoes. Kangol hat like L.L. Cools. Before I was having it, having it large. They nicked the B.M.X. from out my garage. And I knew it was Tire from off the estate. 'Cause every time I saw him he smiled like we were mates. From then on in, I'd have to walk to me Nan's and I'll dream my dreams for a sea of prams. Like a hooligan on the football stands and I threw the V's to Leeds and West Ham. And then I ran, I ran so far away. Down Scotia Road to a taxi bay. Then I ran again 'cause I couldn't pay. Young Muslim didn't get his fare that day. I apologise today. Things look better when they start. That's how the 80's broke my heart. And who are you calling poof. You like Wham, man. I hate that stuff. And then my Granddad died and left a hole in the family. And lots of women there to nanny me. School was a laugh, they didn't have A.D.D. Thick was the term they used for me. Over and over, repeatedly, over and over. Take my breathe away, pass the bidley bidley bidley bidley bong. Pass it on the left hand side. Right turn, Clyde. That girl in the fourth year got pregnant. She was raised Catholic, brilliant. I cried, she cried, we cried. Her youth died. Drank cider in the cemetery. The year above us had discovered 'E'. And I said it weren't for me. Twelve pounds fifty. I could rob my mum's purse and buy one off Chalky. Met a girl on Monday, drank fizzy pop on Tuesday. Fingered her on Wednesday, and on Thursday and Friday, and on Saturday. Dumped by Sunday. Things look better when they start. That's how the 80's broke my heart. The wonder years I've played my part. That's how the 80's broke my heart. I lost my virginity to a girl called Anne-Marie. Well, she said she fancied me. And then she said ""Fuck me"" and I thought fuck me. And I'm all talk and it'll be over too quickly. And it was but I couldn't care less. I'd seen a girl's part, made a mess on her dress. Oh yes, you're now rocking with the best. Second person in my year that had seen a breast. I'm in my 30s now and I'm still impressed. Why the Falklands Mum, and what have they done. Where do girls come, where do girls come from, where do girls come from. It's the 80's what you looking at, you mong.

Me and Tate sat on the bowling green. Life was a sh.itter. We had five quid between us. And bought us six cans of bitter. I took me ten Benson home. And I smoked through the sorrow. If I could just avoid me Mum. Maybe I'd tell her tomorrow. I stumbled through the door. I said Mum it's like this. She said ""That man's been on the phone. And you've made the list. You're in that boy band son. Come and giz' us a kiss"". Phoned up Martin and Rich. And carried on getting pissed. Boys I don't believe it. I'm gonna be famous. Pick you up in a Porsche. and buy you lots of trainers. I met the other guys. one seemed like a cock. I think it's going to be like New Kids On The Block. I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy.

Baby. I adopted four brothers,. Some I liked more than others. One was like a brother from another mother. But the lead singer made it hard to like him. And I still loved him. despite him. The first three months. you know I nearly quit. I played snooker with my Dad. he said ""Don't be a dick. Unload the bullets. you're mind is a gun. You're gonna shoot yourself when they're number one"". I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy. (I only wanted to get down). I hate those that hate me. I can't forgive and it's crazy. Baby. Now I'm a video star. (I'm making trouble in this town). Do you know who you are. (For the five of us). Baby. Now it's dinner with Versace. And lunch with Princess Diana. And I'm gonna get belted if I go out of my manor. Cause as much as we were loved. We were also hated. The boys got jealous. Cause the girls got plated. And now we're famous and that. and we're dancing and that. And I'm thinking I can sing. why am I stood at the back. So fu.ck the band. give me Sambuka and gak. Now we're all a bag of nerves. Were not a band of brothers. . I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy. (I only wanted to get down). I hate those that hate me. I can't forgive and it's crazy. Baby. Now I'm a video star. (I'm making trouble in this town). Do you know who you are?. (For the five of us). Baby. And now it's breaking my heart. because the dream's turned to sh.it. It ain't broke but I'll break it in a little bit. And I'm always in trouble. but I've stopped saying sorry. Everybody's worried. What the fu.ck's wrong with Robbie. He's not answering his phone. He's not talking to me. I saw him on the telly at Glastonbury. And now I'm running away. from everything that I've been. And I'm pissed and I'm fu.cked. and I'm only nineteen. I can't conform no more. I can't perform no more. . But the boys know I'm fu.cked. and so they show me the door. And if the truth be told. I wasn't fit enough to stay. So I put my head down. and walked away. That was the 90's. 90 to 95. I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy. (I only wanted to get down). I hate those that hate me. I can't forgive and it's crazy. Baby.

And the nights are sill as long as they ever were. All the things that could go wrong, well they still occur. But when the violent sun breaks the morning air. it will find me there. Next to you. I had to lose myself for years to find this. Mistook the cruelty and abuse for kindness. Didn't know yet what to keep zipped shut. my own blindness stole the view. But now I wake up next to you. And the nights are still as long as they ever were. And all things that could go wrong, well they still occur. But when the violent sun breaks the morning air. it will find me there. Next to you. Where did it all go right?. When did it all go right?. When did it all go right?. Where did it all go right?. I used to wander to the edge and look down. I used to pile up promises then leave town. You should have heard my best excuses. so profound and so untrue. But now I wake up next to you. When did it all go right?. I'll always walk back from the edge. And find a way to you. Where did it all go right?. I'll always walk back from the edge. Find a way to get to you. When did it all go right?. I'll always walk back from the edge. And find a way to you. Where did it all go right?. I'll always walk back from the edge. Find a way to get to you"

the lady is a tramp,"She gets too hungry, for dinner at eight. She loves the theater, but doesn't come late. She'd never bother, with people she'd hate. That's why the lady is a tramp. Doesn't like crap games, with barons and earls. Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls. Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of those girls. That's why the lady is a tramp. She loves the free, fresh wind in her hair. Life without care. She's broke, but it's o'k. She hates California, it's cold and it's damp. That's why the lady is a tramp. Doesn't like dice games, with sharpies and frauds. Won't go to Harlem, in Lincolns or Fords. Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of those broads. That's why the lady is a tramp"

the road to mandalay,"Save me from drowning in the sea. Beat me up on the beach. What a lovely holiday, there's nothing funny left to say. This sombre song won't drain the sun. But it won't shine until it's sung. No water running in the stream, the saddest place we've ever seen. Everything i touched was golden,. Everything i loved got broken. On the raod to mandalay. Every mistake i've ever made. Has been rehashed and then replayed. As i got lost along the way. bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom. bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom. bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom. bom badom. There's nothing left for you to give,. The truth is all that you're left with. Twenty paces then at dawn, we will die and be reborn. I like to sleep beneath the trees,.

What a strange thing to do. What a brave place to be. So we dive. On sunset strip. Our hearts so deep. I drown in it. And as it breaks. I swim through cracks. And leave with words. I can't take back. You see the trouble with me. Monkey see monkey do. There's no u in tomorrow. A better offer came through. You see the trouble with you. There's no trouble with you. So when you say that you love me. That stops me loving you. So she stays. On sunset strip. Our hearts so full. I drown in it. She's waiting for. My words to break. The one true love. I couldn't make. So she walks. That golden mile. Men will try. And catch her eye. We both know. What could have been. On sunset strip. Our broken dream"
there are bad times just around the corner,"They're out of sorts in Sunderland. And terribly cross in Kent. They're down in Hull. And the isle of Mall. Is seething with discontent. They're nervous in northumberland. And Devon is down the drain. They're filled with wrath on Firth of Forth. And sullen on Salisbury plain. In Dublin they're depressed lads. Maybe because they're Celts. For drake is hurrying West, lads. And so is everyone else. Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!. Misery is here to stay. There are bad times just around the corner. There are dark clouds hurtling through the sky. And it's no good whining. About a silver lining. For we know from experience they won't roll by. With a scowl and a frown we'll keep our peckers down. And prepare for depression and doom and dread. We're going to unpack our troubles from our old kit bag. And wait until we drop down dead. They're nervous in Nigeria. They're all going crazy in Crete. In Bucharest they're so depressed. They're frightend to cross the streets. In maine the melancholia. Is deeper than tongue can tell. In Monako all the croupiers know. They haven't a hope in hell. In far away Australia. Each wallaby is well aware. The world's a total failure. Without any time to spare. Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!. Suffering and dismay. There are bad times just around the corner. The horizon is gloomy as can be. There are black birds over. The greyish cliffs of Dover. And the rats are preparing to leave the BBC. We're unhappy breed and very bored indeed. When reminded of something that Nelson said. While the press and the politicians nag, nag, nag. We'll wait until we drop down dead. There are bad times just around the corner. And the outlook's absolutely vile. There are home fires smoking from Windermere to Woking. And we're not going to tighten our belt and Smile Smile Smile. At the sound of shots. We'd just as soon as not. Get a hot water bottle and go to bed. We're going to unpack our troubles from our old kit bag. And wait until we drop down dead. I like your story Land of Hope and Glory. Wait until we drop down dead"
there she goes,"There she goes. There she goes again. Racing thru' my brain. And I just can't contain. This feeling that remains. There she blows. There she blows again. Pulsing thru' my vein. And I just can't contain. This feeling that remains. There she goes, there she goes again. She calls my name, pulls my train. No-one else can heal my pain. And I just can't contain. This feeling that remains. There she goes. There she goes again. Chasing down my lane. And I just can't contain. This feeling that remains."

time on earth,"[Intro]. What's behind your eyes makes you a star. I want to take my time on earth. And give it meaning. They say you get what you deserve. I know the feeling. Those dumb looks only get you so far. What's behind your eyes makes you a star. [Chorus]. I'm gonna walk onto that stage like it's my destiny. Stand and tell the truth, make no apologies. If tomorrow I should die, these are my memories. I'm gonna take this simple life and make history. I dream a fantasy and then achieve it. Repeat the greatest lie till they believe it. You and me, not gods, define us now. You come in screaming, leave in silence. [Chorus]. Oh, I'm gonna walk onto that stage like it's my destiny. Stand and tell the truth, make no apologies. If tomorrow I should die, these are my memories. I'm gonna take this simple life and make history. [Bridge]. Let's fly higher than the mocking birds. They won't touch us way up here. In the sole asylum of the universe. A man can disappear. Raise a glass to the disfunctional. It's never ever too late. I fell like miracles are happening. If I could just get out the way. I want to take my time on earth. And give it meaning. They say you get what you deserve. I know the feeling, feeling, feeling. [Chorus 2]. You've gotta walk onto that stage like it's your destiny. Stand and tell the truth, make no apologies. If tomorrow you should die, these are your memories. You've gotta take this simple life and make history"
tripping,First they ignore you. Then laugh at you and hate you. Then they fight you - then you win. When the truth dies. Very bad things happen. They’re being heartless again. I know it’s coming. There’s going to be violence. I’ve taken as much. As I’m willing to take. Why do you think. We should suffer in silence. When a heart is broken. There’s nothing to break. (Chorus Backing Vocal:. Want you to love me. Want you to be. The heavens above me. Eternally). You’ve been mixing. With some very heavy faces. The boys have done a bit of bird. They don’t kill their own. And they all love their mothers. But you’re out of your depth son. Have a word. I know it’s coming. There’s going to be violence. I’ve taken as much. As I’m willing to take. Why do you think. We should suffer in silence. The heart is broken. There’s nothing to break. All is wonderful in past lives. Dreaming of the sun she warms. You should see me in the afterlife. Picking up the sons of dust. When you think we're lost. We're exploring. What you think is worthless. I'm adoring. You don’t want the truth. Truth is boring. I got this fever need to. Leave the house leave the car. Leave the bad men where they are. Leave a few shells in my gun. Stop me staring at the sun. I know it’s coming. There’s going to be violence. I’ve taken as much. As I’m willing to take. Why do you say. We should suffer in silence. My heart is broken. There’s nothing to break
ugly love,You were always trippin. I was always stoned. You knew I was a piss-head. That’s why I never phoned. So why’d you act surprised. I was drunk on the day we met. When I see you with your new man. Something stirs inside of me. It’s not that I want you back. It’s how ugly love can be. Be still my foolish pride. I couldn’t love you anyway. Like a baseball cap worn backwards. Like calling cocaine gear. Like a pair of Evisu jeans. We were so last year. And we got high all the time. Night after night. Line after line. How did I make ‘I love you’ sound sincere. When you were just a one-night-stand. That lasted a year. We were always fighting. You thought the drama did us good. Well I found it really boring. Get off the cross we need the wood. Say hi to your mum and dad. It’s all their fault anyway. Like Patrick Cox and girl power. Jean Claude van Damme and Cheers. Vanilla Ice and Take That. We were so last year. Getting high all the time. Night after night. Line after line. How did I make ‘I love you’ sound sincere. When you were just a one-night-stand. That lasted a year. Like a baseball cap worn backwards. Like calling cocaine gear. Like a pair of Evisu jeans. We were so last year. Getting high all the time. Night after night. Line after line. How did I make ‘I love you’ sound sincere. When you were just a one-night-stand. That lasted a year. All in the name of entertainment. We could come to some arrangement. Just a one-night-stand. That lasted a year
united,You sit and scream at all the scandal. That put the monkey on your back. Don't put your idols on a mantel. You'll only want your money back Don't slap my face and call me brother. Lend me a hand and knock me out. So one disciple to another. What's this s*** really about? Are we united?. 'Cos I'm really not that sure. When you've decided. Spread some love and ask for more I sit and think about my maker. And what he's got in store for me. I wanna be a right-on daddy. Protect my wife and family Repeat Chorus x2Runnin' out of love. Got a pain in my head. It's bringing me down. Got send me something Got a gun on my hip. Real tight grip. Don't give me no lip. Boy send me something. When a woman needs a man. Man do what you can. Lend them a hand. And send them something Send them something Repeat Chorus Have you decided to spread some love. And ask for more?. Have you decided to spread some love. And ask for more?

Maybe it's easy, it's easy. How could I ever know. Things ain't been that easy, not easy for me. But when you know, you know. This one I'll never let, never let go. Hard to know which lies to keep. Talking in someone else's sleep. You wear a mask for long enough. You just forget to take it off. Not you. You could see right through. [Chorus 2]. Around you I'm just myself. And maybe it's easy, it's easy. When I found you, I found myself. You made it so easy, so easy for me. But when you know, you know. This one I'll never let, never let go. [Bridge]. I built a kingdom up on the hill. If you hadn't found me, I'd be there still. Up on that hill. Your tank rolled right through. Love's a revolution, revolution for two. [Chorus 3]. She said I love you so. Maybe it's easy, it's easy. How could I ever know. She hates the same people as, people as me. But when you know, you know. This one I'll never let, never let go"
where there's muck,"Oh I could tell you. please try and understand. but the ship left unmanned out at sea. The laughter there is canned. cause the jokes are secondhand. God forbid I didn't blend this mutiny. Before the boats were wreck. send a dove to land on deck. cause the noose around my neck is killing me. The anger makes me boil. the mistakes I make are royal. there's a sadness in the silent part of me. Where there's muck. there's brass. kiss my ass. where there's muck. there's brass. kiss my ass. I'm not asking you. I'm telling you. kiss my ass. Don't tell me the truth. I know I've been uncouth. Well my breath's a hundred proof, I cannot breath. Callin' ship to shore. Dunno what all the fuss is for. save the women and the children after me. Before the boats were wreck. send a dove to land on deck. cause the noose around my neck is killing me. The anger makes me boil. the mistakes I make are royal. there's a sadness in the silent part of me. Where there's muck. there's brass. kiss my ass. where there's muck. there's brass. kiss my ass. I'm not asking you. I'm telling you. kiss my ass. my ass. Would've been loved. should've been loved. Could've been loved. should've been loved. Would've been loved. should've been loved. Could've been loved. should've been loved. Could've been loved"
wimmin,"Your daddy didn't love u let me give u validation. Nice tits nice ass, no class, no conversation. In the school u got picked on for being a geek. What a wonderful woman you turned out to be. I got women I got women everybody. I like to get my feet with their teeth. I think its time I found myself a supermodel. I haven't had one of those yet. You said you dealt well when your parents separated. Lots of drugs, lots of blows, lots of bags, hurry up already. Oh daddy do look what you did to your daughter. Shes got an eating disorder.

I haven't had one of those yet"

Will we still need young love on our shouldersDoes it just fade away, will we ever know?. She touched my face and called me her loverI never thought that I'd need another.

you know me,"If a man could beat his own fancy. Then to only breed in captivity. Is pointless. I've been doing what I like when I like how I like it's joyless. Only you know me. I'm doin' fine. And the sun often shines. What are you thinking?. At the worst of my mind. With this thunderbird wine. Baby, I'm drinking. What a waste of all this peace ,. Baby steps and two more sleeps. Till I get to say sorry. I get hysterical, historical;. of love is just chemical. Give us something to stop me. Only you know me. Since you went away, my heart breaks everyday. You don't know cos you're not there. You simply found the words to make a lot of feelings fade away -or(our model feelings). Only you know me. I'm doin' fine. And the sun often shines. What are you thinking?. At the worst of my mind. With this thunderbird wine. Baby, I'm drinking-. Only you know me. Since you went away, my heart breaks everyday. You don't know cos you're not there.

you're history,"Robbie Williams - You're History. When you were collecting. For you sex appeal. He was in killing fields. Over you. You went. And took away his self respect. Put him out like a cigarette. You blow. Chorus:. Don’t bother coming home. You said all you’ve got to say. He can get with the girls again. Cos he’s a charming man. It’s true. He can drink with the boys tonight. And have a fight, alright. And spew. You’re history. You’re history. Got your tits done. And moved out the very next day. All you left was the bill to pay. What a front. Could she not see what you’re a righteous man?. A gun in hand. Cupid stunned. He used to want your love. Now he wants you to go away. He can drink till he’s comatosed. Yeah he rocks the most. Can't you see. He’s got diamonds in his eyes tonight. Could give you quite a fright. No sympathy. You’re history. You’re history. Don’t bother coming home. You said all you’ve got to say. He can get with the girls again. Cos he’s a charming man. It’s true. He can drink with the boys all night. And have a fight, alright. And spew. He will drink till he’s comatosed. Yeah, He rocks the most. Can’t you see?. He’s got diamonds in his eyes tonight. Could give you quite a fright. Yes siree. You’re history. ["
you're the why,I shuffled through the modes of bad behaviour. And hankered for the desolated dawn. I couldn't cope with yet another saviour. To steer me from the way that I was born. Then like a ton of bricks the dawn descended. Recalcitrance was hurtled to the floor. The citadel lay breached and undefended. You brought a love I'd never known before. Chorus:. I'll want you till the seasons lose their mystery. I'll need you till the birds forget to fly. I'll love you more than anyone in history. Wherever there's a wherefore you're the why
