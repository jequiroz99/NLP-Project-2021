flashback,"Over, we were over. Was something I never had to question. Closure, we had closure. But you left me unsure of a sure thing. Seeing you getting that close to her. Sends me back where you and I once were. And I won't settle for second best. Cause it's not enough!. Can't stop this heart from giving in. One spark and it's starting off the feeling. Shot down thrown now back where I begin. Count one to ten before I fall completely. And I realise that you love her like. Like you did when we were close together. Flashback to a moment and it's gone in a minute. Never, I said never. There's nothing more I need to explain. Ever, and forever. I don't think it can come back again. What we had is dead and gone, it's too late. Living in the past is just a mistake. And I'm much stronger than yesterday. Cause it's not enough!. Can't stop this heart from giving in. One spark and it's starting off the feeling. Shot down thrown now back where I begin. Count one to ten before I fall completely. And I realise that you love her like. Like you did when we were close together. Flashback to a moment and it's gone in a minute. Flashback. Well, do we start at the ending?. Flashback. Cause there's no use in pretending. Flashback. I'll think about it 'till the end of time. Flashback. Cause you're always in this heart of mine. And if I stop to think about it. There's no way to live without it. I keep going back to days gone by. Can't stop this heart from giving in. One spark and it's starting off the feeling. Shot down thrown now back where I begin. Count one to ten before I fall completely. And I realise that you love her like. Like you did when we were close together. Flashback to a moment and it's gone in a minute. Flashback!"

christmas wrapping,"""Bah, humbug! "" No, that's too strong. 'Cause it is my favorite holiday. But all this year's been a busy blur. Don't think I have the energy. To add to my already mad rush. Just 'cause it's 'tis the season. The perfect gift for me would be. Completions and connections left from. Last year, ski shop. Encounter, most interesting. Had his number but never the time. Most of '81 passed along those lines. So deck those halls, trim those trees. Raise up cups of Christmas cheer. I just need to catch my breath. Christmas by myself this year. Calendar picture, frozen landscape. Chilled this room for twenty-four days. Evergreens, sparkling snow. Get this winter over with!. Flashback to springtime, saw him again. Would've been good to go for lunch. Couldn't agree when we were both free. We tried, we said we'd keep in touch. Didn't, of course, 'til summertime. Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?. No, this time it was me. Sunburn in the third degree. Now the calendar's just one page. And, of course, I am excited. Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind. Not to do too much about it. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year. Hardly dashing through the snow. Cause I bundled up too tight. Last minute have-to-do's. A few cards a few calls. 'Cause it's r-s-v-p. No thanks, no party lights. It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax. Turned down all of my invites. Last fall I had a night to myself. Same guy called, halloween party. Waited all night for him to show. This time his car wouldn't go. Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late. Trudge on home to celebrate. In a quiet way, unwind. Doing Christmas right this time. A&P has provided me. With the world's smallest turkey. Already in the oven, nice and hot. Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?. So on with the boots, back out in the snow. To the only all-night grocery. When what to my wondering eyes should appear. In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!. ""I'm spending this one alone, "" he said. ""Need a break; this year's been crazy. "". I said, ""Me too, but why are you?. You mean you forgot cranberries too? "". Then suddenly we laughed and laughed. Caught on to what was happening. That Christmas magic's brought this tale. To a very happy ending! "". Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. Couldn't miss this one this year!. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. Couldn't miss this one this year!"

flashback,"Over, we were over. Was something I never had to question. Closure, we had closure. But you left me unsure of a sure thing. Seeing you getting that close to her. Sends me back where you and I once were. And I won't settle for second best. Cause it's not enough!. Can't stop this heart from giving in. One spark and it's starting off the feeling. Shot down thrown now back where I begin. Count one to ten before I fall completely. And I realise that you love her like. Like you did when we were close together. Flashback to a moment and it's gone in a minute. Never, I said never. There's nothing more I need to explain. Ever, and forever. I don't think it can come back again. What we had is dead and gone, it's too late. Living in the past is just a mistake. And I'm much stronger than yesterday. Cause it's not enough!. Can't stop this heart from giving in. One spark and it's starting off the feeling. Shot down thrown now back where I begin. Count one to ten before I fall completely. And I realise that you love her like. Like you did when we were close together. Flashback to a moment and it's gone in a minute. Flashback. Well, do we start at the ending?. Flashback. Cause there's no use in pretending. Flashback. I'll think about it 'till the end of time. Flashback. Cause you're always in this heart of mine. And if I stop to think about it. There's no way to live without it. I keep going back to days gone by. Can't stop this heart from giving in. One spark and it's starting off the feeling. Shot down thrown now back where I begin. Count one to ten before I fall completely. And I realise that you love her like. Like you did when we were close together. Flashback to a moment and it's gone in a minute. Flashback!"

Because I want you for myself. You creep under my skin. And then you ruin my make up,. You know exactly how to tick me off. And yet I can't resist you. When your kissin' my face off,.

Coming off as if you're good for more. Than what you have. Than what you are. I'm sick of that. And I know I come across as the girl who cares. Cares about my bags and the shoes I wear. But I'm for real. I never pose. I say what I feel. Obviously. You don't know me. You won't like this. But I'm gonna say it anyway. (Chorus). Your ride, I don' care about that. Your pride, I don't care about that. Where are you?. Where did you go?. Please tell me who lies next to me at night. And I really thought we could go so high. And it's killing me to see you try the way you do. I wanted you but you are nowhere around. (Chorus x2)"

vulnerable,"Felt the heat of the fire, gotten cold from the rain. Love just left me standing with nothing but a name. Pick my heart off the ground, as I said to the sky. Never will I let somebody ever make me cry. But just a smile from you told through my defenses. It made no sense. Now I gotta confide it, and tell the truth 'cause. Boy I'm left wide open, hoping you won't leave me broken. [chorus 2X]. You think: ""I know, I've seen it all"". That my heart should be undestructable. But your touch made it impossible. Cause underneath it all, I'm vulnerable. Thought that I was a fighter, one of love soul survivors. Strong enough to keep my love from breaking me again. But you got my attention, put your name on my walls. So I'll be late and praying that you won't hurt me at all. I've been trying to play it cool,. but I'm falling in the morning. Now I got to confide, and tell the truth 'cause. You once were my protection, now please take care of what you found. [chorus 2X]. You think: ""I know, I've seen it all"". That my heart should be undestructable. But your touch made it impossible. Cause underneath it all, I'm vulnerable. I know you're not him, for all that it's worth. And I'm trying to love like I've never been hurt. But sometimes I know that I put you away. Cause underneath, I'm still afraid. [chorus 2X]. You think: ""I know, I've seen it all"". That my heart should be undestructable. But your touch made it impossible. Cause underneath it all, I'm vulnerable. Cause underneath it all, I'm vulnerable"

I could call the one. Nobody's ever moved me quite the way you've done. Why would I ever think of you not by my side. Impossible to picture you not in my life. So why am I sat here wipind away these tears?. And why am I lying trying to unfeel this fear?. Seeing the laughter in your eyes. Seeing the smile I thought was mine. Watching you kiss her lips goodbye. Things I wish I didn't know. If I could wipe this memory. And go back to when that girl was me. The day that I should've stayed at home. And I wish I didn't know. Wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know. I wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know. I wish I didn't know, didn't know. Didn't know, know, know. I'm lying here beside you trying to. Block it out my mind. Just knowing that she touched you. Kills a little more inside, oh. And I don't wanna confront you. 'Cause you're only gonna lie. But what's a girl to do. Just sit around and watch love die. So why am I sat here wipind away these tears?. And why am I lying trying to unfeel this fear?. Seeing the laughter in your eyes. Seeing the smile I thought was mine. Watching you kiss her lips goodbye. Things I wish I didn't know. If I could wipe this memory. And go back to when that girl was me. The day that I should've stayed at home. And I wish I didn't know. Wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know. I wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know. I wish I didn't know, didn't know. Didn't know, know, know. 'Cause I been busying denying. But my heart still needs to know. Seeing the laughter in your eyes. Seeing the smile I thought was mine. Watching you kiss her lips goodbye. Things I wish I didn't know. If I could wipe this memory. And go back to when that girl was me. The day that I should've stayed at home. And I wish I didn't know. Wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know. I wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know. I wish I didn't know, didn't know. Didn't know, know, know"
wordshaker,"Oh boy. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Baby, I got you on my answering machine on replay. This is getting difficult in my say. Stutters on my mind when you approach me. With soft untrusting words. Velvet lining's on your language. Boy you got me hanging but it's so hard to hold on. You're such a wordshaker. Talk and you take it back. Twisting turning. You're such a wordshaker. I gotta shut you up. Your lips are burning. First you say yes then no. When you are ready then. Baby let me know. You're such a wordshaker. Talk and you take it back, back. Shaking me off my track.

Velvet lining's on your language. Boy you got me hanging but it's so hard to hold on. You're such a wordshaker. Talk and you take it back. Twisting turning. You're such a wordshaker.

you don't have the right,"You tell me you're missing me. And that you can't wait to see me again. You tell me you don't know why you. And I can't go on being friends. You say you still think of the two of us. And you still want to stay in touch. But I still remember. All the hell you put me through. All the tears cried over you. You can't, keep coming back. It's, not, fair. You don't have the right to call me. Acting just like everything's the same. And that nothing's really changed. And that you can come around. And just come walking back in my life again. And you can break my heart. And then expect that we'll still be friends. Oh baby you don't understand. You don't have the right, to do that. I don't wanna hear from you. Hear what's going on in your life. I don't want you coming round, coming here. Messing with my mind. I finally got my heart. To start to heal. Why can't you just stay away from me?. 'Cause I still remember. All the hell you put me through. No what am I supposed to do?. Just say, that's it ok. It's, not, fair. You don't have the right to call me. Acting just like everything's the same. And that nothing's really changed. And that you can come around. And just come walking back in my life again. And you can break my heart. And then expect that we'll still be friends. Oh baby you don't understand. You don't have the right, to do that"
