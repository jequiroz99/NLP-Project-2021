nothin' on you,"[Chorus- Bruno Mars] (B.o.B). Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing. But my time would be wasted,. they got nothing on you, baby. Nothing on you, baby. They might say hi, and I might say hey. But you shouldn't worry, about what they say. Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah). Nothing on you, baby. (N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you). [Verse 1- B.o.B]. I know you feel where I'm coming from. Regardless of the things in my past that I've done. Most of it really was for the hell of the fun. On a carousel, so around I spun. With no direction, just tryna get some. Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun. And so I lost more than I had ever won. And honestly, I ended up with none. [Bridge- Bruno Mars]. It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience. I'm thinking ""maybe I should get it out"". And I don't wanna sound redundant. But I was wondering,. if there was something that you wanna know. But never mind that, we should let it go. Cause we don't wanna be a t.v. episode. And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go. [Chorus]. Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing. But my time would be wasted,. they got nothing on you, baby. Nothing on you, baby. They might say hi, and I might say hey. But you shouldn't worry, about what they say. Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah). Nothing on you, baby. (N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you). [Verse 2- B.o.B]. Hands down, there will never be another one (nope). I've been around, and I've never seen another one (never). Because your style, I 'aint really got nothin' on. (nothing). And you wild when you 'aint got nothin' on? (haha). Baby you the whole package. Plus you pay your taxes. And you keep it real, while them others stay plastic. You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic. Stop- now think about it. [Bridge 2- Bruno Mars]. I've been to London, I've been to Paris. Even way out there in Tokyo. Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans. But you always steal the show. And just like that girl, you got me froze. Like a Nintendo 64. If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know. [Chorus]. Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing. But my time would be wasted,. they got nothing on you, baby. Nothing on you, baby. They might say hi, and I might say hey. But you shouldn't worry, about what they say. Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah). Nothing on you, baby. (N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you). [Bridge 3- B.o.B]. Everywhere I go, I'm always hearing your name. And no matter where I'm at, girl you make me wanna sing. Whether a bus or a plane, or a car, or a train. No other girl's on my brain, and you the one to blame. [Chorus]. Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing. But my time would be wasted,. they got nothing on you, baby. Nothing on you, baby. They might say hi, and I might say hey. But you shouldn't worry, about what they say. Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah). Nothing on you, baby. (N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you). [B.o.B]. Yeah (laughing).

But this little light of mine told me open my eyes. There's more than darkness out there. I'm not gonna run from ya,. Imma walk from ya,. I'm not afraid of ya, I've escaped from ya. And my faith is in place. In the night I no longer see your face!. Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?. Been standing in the way for far too long. Dream maker now it's taking your place.

evil,"Chorus. Evil, why you keep knocking on my door?. (My door, door, door, door). Lord knows I don't want you no more. (No more) no more (no more) no more!. I keep on trying do right. But you know just what I like!. This shit is wicked in these mean streets. I used to be a Grammy nigga, it was me and Millie. We used to hustle 24 7, money for my brother. More paper in a daily now I see in a week. And when Millie got knocked for his third crime. They sent him upstate, nigga still serving time. That's when I promised to myself I'll leave that life alone. Around the same time. I discovered microphones and beat machines. This way I ain't tryin' keep the clean. but I remember what it feels like. To my stomach so bad, you're even still right. Tried to get a deal. but they had the door to the game sealed tight. Temptation is a beast. I tried to be patient but that patience is deceased. Can you blame me?. Now I'm in the game G, and I ought to be lapsed. But now the homies calling me back and I be tryin' tell 'em. Chorus. Evil, why you keep knocking on my door?. (My door, door, door, door). Lord knows I don't want you no more. (No more) no more (no more) no more!. I keep on trying do right. But you know just what I like!. Oh tell me evil, if you keep on knocking I'll lose my mind. Guess I let you win but it's the last time. (Last time) last time (last time) last time!. I keep on trying do right, but you know just what I like!. The music in the street Is cutthroat except. For the real hits I give him the utmost respect. For giving these quay in a shot. I try to live right but you know. a leopard never changes its spots. The reality is I'mma forever have the enemies. necessary mentality kid. It's the way that I miss, it's embedded in my mind. Sometimes I think about the life I left behind. or did I? (Evil). Shit I never tell, but if I don't cut these corners. Man, you know I'll never sell. And I ain't even tryin' sell shit, I'm just tryin' prevail. But as hell tryin' sustain relevance. I just can't tell if it's gonna be worth it to me in the end. Then I think of my friend, Millie, he in the pin. They let the wrong nigga in the industry, for real. Scheming my way to the top but I be tryin' tell evil to chill. Chorus. Evil, why you keep knocking on my door?. (My door, door, door, door). Lord knows I don't want you no more. (No more) no more (no more) no more!. I keep on trying do right. But you know just what I like!. Oh tell me evil, if you keep on knocking I'll lose my mind. Guess I let you win but it's the last time. (Last time) last time (last time) last time!. I keep on trying do right, but you know just what I like!. [Outro:]. 2012, D swaying in the. Bruno Mars in the. Yeah, that's right!"

A sky full of lighters. [Eminem:]. By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up. I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up. If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening. Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em' skyward uh. Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king?. This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking. Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me. I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music. There is or there ever will be, disagree. Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up. The only thing I ever gave's using no more excuses. Excuse me if my head is too big for this building. And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick. Poppin shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit. Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite. You stayed the same, just cock back with this still cock you pricks. I love it when I tell em shove it. Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall said bust a leg. Muster cause he couldn't cut mustard mustered up nothing. Brain fuzzy, cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz. Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it. Wasn't cause he had buzzards circle around his head. Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?. Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off. Little hussy ass, cause f-ck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it. What difference it make?. What it take to get it through your thick skulls. As if this ain't some bullshit. People don't usually come back this way. From a place that was dark as I was in. Just to get to this place. Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage. And let it be known from this day forward. I wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me strength. So let em cause I came with 5'9' but I feel like I'm 6'8'. [Bruno Mars:].

Tell him how real he is or high I am. Or how I would kill for him for him to know it. I cried many tears, my daddy got a bad back. So it's only right that I right till he can march. Right into that post office and tell em to hang it up. Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years. I'll stop when I'm at the very top. You shitted on me on your way up. It's bout to be a scary drop. Cause what goes up must come down. You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box. Every hour, happy hour now. Life is wacky now. Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy. Now I'm just the cats meooww, ow. Classic cow, always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao. Ya'll are doomed. I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me. My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes. Cause now I'm in the Aston. I went from having my city locked up. To getting treated like ? Patrick. And now I'm fantastic. Compared to a weed high. And y'all niggas just gossiping like bitches on a radio and TV. See me, we fly. Y'all buggin out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive. And how real is that. I remember signing my first deal and now. I'm the second best I can deal with that. Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag. [Bruno Mars:]. You and I know what it's like. To be kept down, forced to fight. But tonight we're alright. So hold up your light. Let it shine. Cause this one's for you and me. Living out our dreams. We are right where we should be. With my arms out wide I open my eyes. And now all I wanna see. Is a sky full of lighters. A sky full of lighters"

lost,"What are you fucking crazy?. It's getting hard to wait,. I'm trying to make her see,. That she don't really knows. That I'm trying to find a way,. And tell her every day, that she just goes along. So I.... I don't wanna be,. The only one that knows. That somebody could come along and just. Say the love for me,. I'm standing shaking ground,.

love,"Now Hollywood wants to make you think. They know what love is. But I'm a tell you what true love is. Love is not what you see in the movies. It's not the ecstasy, it's not what you see in that scene. You know what I mean?. I'm telling you right now, true love is sacrifice. Love is thinking about others. Before you think about yourself. Love is selfless not selfish. Love is god and god is love. Love is when you lay down your life for another. Whether for your brother, your mother,. Your father or your sister. It's even laying down your life for your enemies,. That's unthinkable, but think about that. Love is true. Think. (chorus). I'll put you in front of me. So everybody can see. My love, this is my love. I know that I'll be alright. As long as you are my guide. My love, this is my love. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast. It is not proud. Love is not rude, it is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. You see love does not delight in evil. But rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts,. Always hopes, it always perseveres. Love never fails. Love is everlasting. It's eternal, it goes on and on, it goes beyond time. Love is the only thing that will last when you die. But ask the question why?. Do you have love?. (chorus). I'll put you in front of me. So everybody can see. My love, this is my love. I know that I'll be alright. As long as you are my guide. My love, this is my love. There is no greater love than this. Than he who lays down his life for his friends. Now are you willing to lay down your life for your friends?. You're probably willing to lay down your life. For your mother your father, or your best friends. But are you willing to lay down your life. For even those that hate you?. I'm going to tell you who did that. The definition of love is jesus christ. He is love. The nails in his hands, the thorns in his brow. Hanging on a cross for your sin my sins. That is love he died for you and me. While we still hated him. That is love. God is true love, and if you don't know this love. Now is the time to know, perfect love. (chorus). I'll put you in front of me. So everybody can see. My love, this is my love. I know that I'll be alright. As long as you are my guide. My love, this is my love. I'll put you in front of me. So everybody can see. My love, this is my love. I know that I'll be alright. As long as you are my guide. My love, this is my love"

tonight (feat. johnny angel),[Chorus: Bruno Mars]. Maybe if I jump or spread my wings. I know I've been wrong about these things. I don't care if noone else believes. I think that if you believe it then maybe we'll make it. Tonight. Oh tonight. If you believe in me like I believe in you. Tonight. Tonight. Because impossible is possible tonight. [Verse 1: Johnny Angel]. Some 'bout the day. Some 'bout the night. Feeling so right I can smell it in the air. Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear. But I don't even care I like my chicks simple. With' a big dimple real down to earth. Not stuck up there for man. Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita. Low like Kesha when she on the mic. Move on to another cause she wasn't treated right. I could relate to that boy Drizzy. How did I wind up right here with you. Sure you can achieve if you do believe. Gotta chase your dreams true reality. No fantasy enjoy it while you have it. Relax and take it in. I tell as your friend your friend to the end. [Chorus].

But I don't even care I like my chicks simple. With' a big dimple real down to earth. Not stuck up there for they man. Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita. We could get together like it's New Years Eve. Met a lotta girls but cute what I need. I live life fast.... Tryna hang on passenger.... I need a companion on this campaign. Felt so much pain when the rain goes away believe in sunny days. One life to live gotta be epic or be... you can be my bella. [Chorus]
