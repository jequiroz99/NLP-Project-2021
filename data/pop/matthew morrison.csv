my name,"My Name. Matthew Morrison. It's always early. It's always dark when I leave. I check myself in the mirror. And he looks a lot like me. It could be London. But he's followed me back home.

on the street where you live,"I have often walked. Down the street before. But the pavement always. Stayed beneath my feet before. All at once am I. Several stories high. Knowing I'm on the street where you live. Are there lilac trees. In the heart of town?. Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?. Does enchantment pour. Out of every door?. No, it's just on the street where you live. And oh, the towering feeling. Just to know somehow you are near. The overpowering feeling. That any second you may suddenly appear. People stop and stare. They don't bother me. For there's nowhere else on earth. That I would rather be. Let the time go by. I won't care if I. Can be here on the street where you live. And oh, the towering feeling. Just to know somehow you are near. The overpowering feeling. That any second you may suddenly appear. People stop and stare. They don't bother me. For there's nowhere else on earth. That I would rather be. Let the time go by. I won't care if I. Can be here on the street where you live. I'm here on the street where you live. On the street where you live"
send in the clowns,"Isn't it rich, are we a pair?. Me here at last on the ground. You in mid-air. Send in the clowns. Isn't it bliss, don't you approve?. One who keeps tearing around. One who can't move. Where are the clowns?. Send in the clowns. Just when I stopped opening doors. Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours. Making my entrance again with my usual flair. Sure of my lines no one is there. Don't you love farce? My fault I fear. I thought that you'd want what I want. Sorry my dear but where are the clowns?. Quick send in the clowns, don't bother their here. What a surprise, who could foresee?. I've come to feel about you what you felt about me. Why only now when I see that you've drifted away. What a surprise, what a cliché?. Isn't it rich, isn't it queer?. Losing my timing this late in my career. And where are the clowns?. There ought to be clowns. Well maybe next year"

Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue. And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true. (Matthew Morrison & Gwyneth Paltrow). oooh someday I'll wish upon a star.

the lady is a tramp,"She gets too hungry, for dinner at eight. She adores the theater, but never comes late. She will never argue, with the cat she'd hate. And that is why the lady is a tramp. Won? t got to Coney, Malibu is fine. She adores the ballgame, thinks the Mets are divine. She refuses to believe that Phil Ramone? s a friend of mine. That's why the lady is a tramp. She likes that green grass growing under her shoes. She even digs the birth of the blues. Man she? s a swinger, a humdinger. She? s all alone when she lowers the lamp. That's why my lady is a tramp. She likes that free fresh wind in her hair. Life without care. She? s grown, but it? s old. She hates California, it? s cold and it? s damp. That's why my lady is a tramp. That is why the lady is a tramp"
we own the night,Where's the light. in all this darkness. all at once I've lost my way. Blinded with pain. Far from the innocence I'll never find again. Time is the fire in which we all burn. Time that is lost in ever page that I turn. When we're apart I feel the isolation. For your heartbeat is my affirmation. Need you under my skin and in air that I breathe. To wake alone without you is too hard to conceive. When we're apart there's only desolation. Nothing seems to work its only frustration. The sun will still be rising. But we're still out of sight. Tomorrow is too far away. Till then we own the night. I follow the moon. As it is falling from the sky now way too fast. I try to deny. The new day dawning just to make each moment last. Time is the chill that creeps on my skin. Freezing my heart and my soul from within. When we're apart I feel the isolation. For your heartbeat is my affirmation. Need you under my skin and in air that I breathe. To wake alone without you is too hard to conceive. When we're apart there's only desolation. Nothing seems to work its only frustration. The sun will soon be rising. But its still out of sight. Tomorrow is still far away. Till then we own the night. The night. Time is the fire in which we all are burning. The night. The night. Time which is flying can't stop the world from turn. We own the night. We own the night. Hold me close. Hold me tight. We own the night. When we're apart I feel the isolation. For your heartbeat is my affirmation. Need you under my skin and in air that I breathe. To wake alone without you is too hard to conceive. When we're apart there's only desolation. Nothing seems to work its only frustration. The sun will soon be rising. But its still out of sight. Tomorrow is too far away. Till then we own the night. Sign in to comment

Maria, maria, maria, maria. Maria!. I've just met a girl named maria. And suddenly that name. Will never be the same. To me. Maria!. I've just kissed a girl named maria. And suddenly I've found. How wonderful a sound. Can be!. Maria!. Say it loud and there's music playing. Say it soft and it's almost like praying. Maria. I'll never stop saying maria!. The most beautiful sound I ever heard. Maria"
younger than springtime,"Younger than springtime, are you. Softer than starlight, are you. Warmer than winds of June. Are the gentle lips you gave me. Gayer than laughter, are you. Sweeter than music, are you. Angel and lover, heaven and earth. Are you to me. And when your youth. And joy invade my arms. And fill my heart as now they do. Then younger than springtime, am I. Gayer than laughter, am I. Angel and lover, heaven and earth. Am I with you!. Then younger than springtime, am I. Gayer than laughter, am I. Angel and lover, heaven and earth. Am I with you"
