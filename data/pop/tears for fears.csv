Oh happy, hope you're happy too. I've loved all I've needed love. Sordid details following"". The shrieking of nothing is killing. Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and.

Oh happy, hope you're happy too. One flash of light but no smoking pistol. I've never done good things. I've never done bad things. I've never done anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh.

badman's song,"Heard every word that was said that night. When the light of the world put the world to right. Well here's to the boys back in 628. Where an ear to the wall was a twist of fate. I will shine a blinding light. Through those hearts as black as night. Sticks and stones may break my bones. But as least the seeds of love will be sown. Now once in awhile when I feel no shame. I get down on my knees and I pray for rain. And though the breeze blows gently while I state my case. There'll be certain men waiting just to scratch my. face. Hand on my heart I will make a stand. For the life and the times of the mirrorman. In my head there is a mirror. When I've been bad, I've been wrong. Food for the saints that are quick to judge me. Hope for a Badman. This is the Badman's Song. Guilt in the frame of the looking-glass. Puts a shine on the mind where reflections pass. Where the jigsaw pieces of a broken man. Try and fit themselves together again. Lies in disguise in the name of trust. Put your head in the sand it will turn to dust !. What's your problem ? What's your curse ?. Won't it make the matter worse ?. In my head.... And they say "" Faith can move move mountains. Fire can cleanse your soul "". Faith can move mountains. But mind over matter won't you stop all your chatter -. No !. I heard every word that was said that night. When the light of the world put the world to right. When I hear soft whispers at the break of day. (I'm in trouble every step of the way). Sweet talking boys who can do no wrong. When the stories are tall as the day is long. With such a thin drawn between friend and foe. Lord help me now and bless my soul !. Look at yourself - See how you lie. Your hands start shaking and you don't know why. Look at yourself - See how you lie. Your hands start shaking and you don't know why. Well there's food for the saints that are quick to. judge me. Hope for a Badman..."
bloodletting go,"Life, mama says. Is bloodletting go. If I care for nothing. Sun don't shine and the grass don't grow. Bloodletting go. Society dictates. by rules and regulations. But when things are so tired. You see things in the wrong light. Soon there will be no light. If the sun don't shine. Life, mama says. Is bloodletting go. If I care for nothing. Sun don't shine and the grass don't grow. Bloodletting go. If by chance we both forget. The passage of space and time between. Pick up the pieces cold and wet. And drive them before the light to clean. Good times, bad times. Pain will come and pain will go. If I care for nothing. Sun don't shine. And if by chance we both forget. The passage of space and time between. Pick up the pieces cold and wet. And drive them before the light to clean. Good times, bad times. Pain will come and pain will go. If I care for nothing. Sun don't shine and the grass don't grow. Bloodletting go."
break it down again,"So those are my dreams. And these are my eyes. Stand tall like a man. Head a strong like a horse. When it's all mixed up. Better break it down. In the world of secrets. In the world of sound. It's in the way you're always hiding from the light. See for yourself you have been sitting on a time bomb. No revolution maybe someone somewhere else. Could show you something new about you and your inner song. And all the love and all the love in the world. Won't stop the rain from falling. Waste seeping underground. I want to break it down. Break it down again. So those are my schemes. And these are my plans. Hot tips for the boys. Fresh news from the force. When it's all mixed up. Better break it down. In the world of silence. In the world of sound. "" No sleep for dreaming"" say the architects of life. Big bouncing babies, bread and butter can I have a slice. They make no mention of the beauty of decay. Blue, yellow, pink umbrella save it for a rainy day. And all the love and all the love in the world. Won't stop the rain from falling. Waste seeping underground. I want to break it down. Horsin' around. Pray to power. Play to the crowd with your big hit sound. And they won't simmer won't simmer, won't simmer down. Play to the crowd. Play to the crowd. Play yeah yeah. It's in the way you're always hiding from the light. Fast off to heaven just like Moses on a motorbike. No revolution maybe someone somewhere else. Could show you something new to help you. With the ups and downs. I want to break it down. Break it down again. Break it down again. No more sleepy dreaming. No more building up. It is time to dissolve. Break it down it again. No more sleepy dreaming"

call me mellow,"Fill the sky with love. Fill the sky with love. I wouldn't mind but she just turned up on the doorstep. Wishful in ashes slightly bedraggled. Last time I saw her she was howling at the moon. Roaming the forest, leap pine and rabbits. Oh is she wild?. Does she see my inner child?. But then she knows it's like a curse. To find the chosen roles reversed. To unify my universe. To call me mellow. If only I was half-mage and she was older. We'd live on ice-cream on Coney Island. I know it's gravity that drags down my balloon. She stays in orbit way after midnight. Oh slip and slide. Does she go on the Elide?. But then she knows it's like a curse. To find the chosen roles reversed. To unify my universe. To call me mellow. She'll dress down for us. She'll break new grounds for us. Watching me cracking up. She'll hang around fellows. With all the groundswellers. Driving me like a truck. But then she knows it's like a curse. To find the chosen roles reversed. To unify my universe. To call me mellow"

Seems she thought of me as some mystic, fatalistic, mystical guru. Me, I haven't got a clue. But floating on a magic carpet high above the earth. You can see the world like a Buddha, bread and Buddha. Bigger than you hurt. Don't you know that love is work. Cold, no heat on the horizon guess I'm cold. And Capricorn is rising yes I'm cold. Listened to my old Nockles. Hoped that it would warm the cockles. You can't fight the fear you can't, this is the road you're on. You don't belong to me you don't belong to any one. Your reputation lies not in your eyes, but those who dare. Will bite the hand that feeds when it don't meet your needs. When you got blood to bleed, you got a life to lead. In the flood with my blood I can hold you. Cold, been excommunicated cos I'm cold. My temperature's been rated and I'm cold. Bring to me my big old sweater. Nothing more will make me better. Cold, no heat on the horizon guess I'm cold. There'll be no comprimising, cold, cool, cold. Stone cold. Stone cold. Cold. Cold. Cold."

There is a power in the vacuum we are making. You and I have a secret world. And we can keep it unfurled. And pay no attention to the cradle or the grave. And when we're crossed,. We can say that we're lost. In the middle of nowhere they can like it or not. And if we're wrong and we end up alone. We'll light a candle for their innocent bones. You and I have a secret world. And we can keep it unfurled. And pay no attention to the cradle or the grave. ""Someone's knockin' at the door. Somebody's ringin' the bell. Someone's knockin' at the door. Somebody's ringin' the bell"". You and I have a secret world. And we can keep it unfurled. And pay no attention to the cradle or the grave. And when we're crossed,. We can say that we're lost. In the middle of nowhere they can like it or not. And if we're wrong and we end up alone. We'll light a candle for their innocent bones. You and I have a secret world. And we can keep it unfurled. And pay no attention to the cradle or the grave. And when we're crossed,. We can say that we're lost. In the middle of nowhere they can like it or not. And if we're wrong and we end up alone. We'll light a candle for their innocent bones"
secrets,It seems we caused a forest fire. With just a flicker of a flame. And now I set alight to everything. Now all I do is cause you pain. I won't keep secrets alive. I'll send them all out to space. Without the will to survive. They won't be going no place. Oh my angel. Woman child. I used to think the time would come. When man would rise above the beast. I gave up thinking that way long ago. In conversation with a priest. I won't keep secrets alive. I'll send them all out to space. Without the will to survive. They won't be going no place. Oh my angel. Woman child. We could have heal this blindness. With some human kindness. I know secrets kill you. But my love can fill you. Time and time again. Time and time again. It would be so fine. If you could be mine. I won't keep secrets alive. I'll send them all out to space. Without the will to survive. They won't be going no place. Oh my angel. Woman child.

These are the things I can do without. Come on, I'm talking to you, come on. Shout, shout, let it all out. These are the things I can do without. Come on, I'm talking to you, come on"
size of sorrow,"Bathe in another man's grave. In time we'll follow. Save all your thoughts for these days. Don't steal just borrow. Well a high wire. Is a dangerous game. But a hard act to follow. If I fly high like a moth to a flame. Would you eyes be the size of sorrow?. Pain, I can understand pain. Sometimes you just swallow. Say we can make it OK. Don't steal just borrow.

standing on the corner of the third world,"Man, I never slept so hard. I never dreamt so well. Dreaming, I was safe in life. Like mussels in a shells. Rolling and controlling all the basements and the backroads of our lives. Fill thier dreams with big fast cars. Fill thier heads with sand. Holy white we'll paint the town. The colour of our flag. Hey there little lady has your baby got the look of some old man ?. Standing on the corner of the third world. Hungry men will close their minds. Ideas are not their food. Notions fall on stony ground. Where passions are subdued. Colour all the madness for the madness is the thorn that's in our side. Standing on the corner of the third world. When we gonna learn ?. Who we gonna turn to ?. The promises they make. The call for attention. Compassion is the fashion. Free to earn, our pockets burn. We buy for love. Die for love. Hold me I'm crying. Hold me I'm dying."
start of the breakdown,Scratch the ice. Let the telephone ring. Sense of time is a powerful thing. And we love to laugh. Love to cry. Half alive. We love to. Go slow when we're dancing for rain. Dry skin flakes where there's ice in the vien. And we love to cry. Half alive. Is this the start of the breakdown ?. Scratch the earth. Dig the burial ground. Sense of time won't be easily found. And ten out of ten. For the ones who defend. Pretend too. Breakdown is a final demand. ( We stand firm with our heads in our hands ). As we love to to cry. Half alive. Is this the start of the breakdown ?. I can't understand you. Is this the start of the breakdown ?.
suffer the children,It's a sad affair. When there's no one there. He calls out in the night. And it's so unfair. At least it seems that way. When you gave him his life. And all this time he's been getting you down. You ought to pick him up when there's no one around. And convince him. Just talk to him. Cos he knows in his heart you won't be home soon. He's an only child in an only room. And he's dependant on you. And it seems so strange. That at the end of the day. Making love can be so good. But the Pain of birth. What is it worth. When it don't turn out the way it should.
swords and knives,"A waking world of innocence. So grave those first born cries. When life begins with needles and pins. It ends with Swords and Knives. Oh dangerman, oh dangerman. Your blade fits like a glove. When forged in steel. Time cannot heal. That blood red bond of love. In times of trouble you're an open book. With the change in the way you look. And its sad love's not enough to make things better. Turn the tables, we'll burn the fables. Lies beneath the visions and daydreams. Fooled by now, we mystify the past. Like a dream, like it never happened. When life begins with needles and pins. It ends with Swords and Knives. God save those born to die"
tears roll down,"Chewed the bone down too low. Got fed on tea and sympathy. Blew the sail like the wind. I wish you were my enemy, I was humble for you. What a fool I've been to have laid so low for so long, so low. Into that void of silence where we cry without sound. Where tears roll down, where tears roll down. And where your mother's violence. Sent your soul underground. Where tears roll down, where tears roll down. Drew the blade way too slow was shackled by your honesty. Made a mess. I guess I should have known that life was lust and liberty. Not a chance mutation or the last temptation. Laid so low for so long, so low. Into that void of silence where we cry without sound. Where tears roll down, where tears roll down. And where your mother's violence. Sent your soul underground. Where tears roll down, where tears roll down. Into that void of silence where we cry without sound. Where tears roll down, where tears roll down. And where your mother's violence. Sent your soul underground. Where tears roll down, where tears roll down"

the devil,"The devil, take me now. Before I'm ushered out. 'Cause you are like me. But I can bleed. And I can die. But I can't hide. From you. Prisoners of course. Taken by force. To smother my streams. Tonight in my dreams. 'Cause I can die. But I can't hide. The way is clear. Away from here. And you"
the hurting,Is it an horrific dream. Am I sinking fast. Could a person be so mean. As to laugh and laugh. On my own. Could you ease my load. Could you see my Pain. Could you please explain. The Hurting. Could you understand a child. When he cries in Pain. Could you give him all he needs. Or do you feel the same. All along. You've been told you're wrong. When you felt it right. And you're left to fight. The Hurting. Get in line with the things you know. Feel the Pain. Feel the sorrow. Touch the hurt and don't let go. Get in line with the things you know. Learn to cry. Like a baby. Then the hurting won't come back.

watch me bleed,"Heaven comes to he who waits. But I know I'm getting nowhere. And all the deeds of yesterday. Have really helped to pave my way. Though there's no one near me now. How come everyone can touch me. You see the torture on my brow. Relates to neither here nor now. Watch me bleed. Bleed forever. Although my face is straight, it lies. My body feels the Pain and cries. Here the table is not bare. I am full but feeling empty. For all the warmth it feels so cold. For one so young I feel so old. Watch me bleed. Bleed forever.

who killed tangerine?,"Whatcha gonna choose the poison or the lines. Lived with crazy pain in all your life. Something in your mind just tells you no. Hope in conversation starts to flow.

Watcha gonna do when the old man reads you dry. Step down from the plane and pluck the eye. Slide in deeper closer to the bone. Don't you just wish your heart was made of stone?. Waxing like an old crack 45. Counting out the ways you could stay alive. Placing all the banks and feel the stones. My love won't leave her ways of foam. And when you think it's all over.
