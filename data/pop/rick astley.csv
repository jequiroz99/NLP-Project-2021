hopelessly,"I walk the wire every night. I can't decide between wrong and right. I've lost control over the things i do. 'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you.

behind the smile,Rick Astley. (Chorus). Behind the smile that I portray. I am saddened every day. My eyes are sore with endless nights of crying. I hope that you don't feel this way. My heart fills with tears when you pass me by. You won't look me in the eye. Don't you think that it's a crying shame. We must play these silly games. The pain in my heart that shows we're apart. Is growing stronger day by day. (Repeat chorus). If you think that I have done you wrong. I won't try to change your mind. But try to think of the love that we once had. And maybe things won't seem so bad. The memories of those times are vivid in my mind. And yet they slip away as time goes on. Take me back tonight. Hold me close and tight. Forever I will be true. Behind the smiles that we portray. There is nothing hidden away. Our eyes are sore because we are crying. I hope we'll always feel this way.

the good old days,"I believe what I was told. Listen to the stereo under the covers of my bed. The stories of the old days. The 6 wives of Henry. Origin into the center. Of the earth, the place of my birth. Was the music that my brothers and my sister played to me. And how I believed the stories that they told me. 'Cause I'm a believer. I believe in the stories from the songs. From the old days. Believer. I believe in the world that they told me existed. On the vinyl and the tapes and from the Cd players. That came later, so much later than the good old days. Down a yellow brick road. I drive a yellow taxi to a yellow submarine. Just for fun, a super triple sign for me. A full [?] banquet or a night at the opera. For all it's worth, the place of my birth. Was the music that my brothers and my sister played to me. And how I believed the stories that they told me. 'Cause I'm a believer. I believe in the stories from the songs. From the old days. Believer. I believe in the world that they told me existed. On the vinyl and the tapes and from the Cd players. That came later, so much later than the good old days. Someone save my life every single night. When the words and music play. When the records took me away. Yeah someone save my life every single night. I just listen to the music. To the words in the music. To the words in the music. Listen to the words in the music. Friends and the music. Listen to the words and the music, music. Music, music, music, music. The pace of my breath. Why's the music that my brothers and my brother play to me. And how I believe. The stories that they told me. 'Cause I'm a believer. I believe in the stories from the songs. From the old days. Believer. I believe in the world that they told me existed.

the love has gone,"(Rick Astley/D. Spatsley). The love has gone. The love has gone, will we ever be the same. The feelings wrong, the joy has turned to pain. Wake up beside you, and hear you breathing. And I can feel you in my arms. No one can know just how I'm feeling. Knowing that our love can come to no harm. But as I open my eyes. Then I start to realise. That you're gone and I can't go on. The love has gone, will we ever be the same. The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain. The love is gone, will we ever be the same. The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain. What have I done girl, to make you leave me. Didn't I love you for all those years. If you open your eyes. Baby, then you'll realise. That you're wrong, and I can't go on. You know I can't go on. The love has gone, will we ever be the same. The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain. The love is gone, will we ever be the same. The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain. Nothing will ever come between us. If you will just take me back once more. I'll show you just how much I love you. If you'll just come walking through that door. The love has gone, will we ever be the same. The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain. The love is gone, will we ever be the same. The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain. . (chorus to fade)."
the ones you love,"Astley/West. Children cry on the street. They don't have enough to eat. Mothers wait for days to end. A hopeless situation they can't mend. Is it good for you?. Is it good for me?.

If no-one else should get enough. They'd better be the ones you love. Daddy waits there in line. A little work he hopes to find. Something wrong with times like these. It's enough to bring a man down to his knees. Is it good for you?. Is it good for me?. I don't know how the world can sleep. It's just not right to close the door turn out the light. (Repeat chorus).

these foolish things (cover),"A cigarette that bears a lipsticks traces. An airline ticket to romantic places. And still my heart has wings. These foolish things remind me of you. A tinkling piano in the next apartment. Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant. A fairgrounds painted swings. These foolish things remind me of you. You came, you saw, you conquered me. When you did that to me. I knew somehow this had to be. The winds of march that make my heart a dancer. A telephone that rings but whos to answer?. Oh, how the ghost of you clings. These foolish things remind me of you. The smile of turner and the scent of roses. The waiters whistling as the last bar closes. The song that crosby sings. These foolish things remind me of you"
this must be heaven,"Jon Lind, Jeffrey Cohen & Nicky Brown. When I was much younger. It used to happen every night. I had a dream about a city dressed in lights. And there were friends of mine. I saw them time after time. But I never knew their names. And darling I swear. I saw you there. I know it sounds insane. Sweet dreams of a child forgotten so easy. I needed your smile to bring it all back to me. I see all of my life as the road that brought me here. Must be something went right. I just know when you're near. (Chorus). This must be heaven. Have I found it what I've been looking for. This must be heaven. Have I finally stumbled through the door. How could I have doubted. I guess I must have lost my place. You turned on the light. And I saw my life. Reflected in your face. Sweet dreams of a child forgotten so easy oh yeah. I needed your smile to bring it all back to me. I see all of my life as the road that brought me here. Must be something went right. I just know when you're near. (Repeat chorus). And I always knew that there was something more. Come closer to me now. You fill me up I'm overflowing. Come closer to me now. Come hold me tight and don't let go. (Repeat chorus). You fill me up girl. You fill me up and I'm overflowing. This must be heaven. Have I found what I've been living for.

Catch the breeze and the winter chills. in colors on the snowy linen land. Now I understand. What you tried to say to me. And how you suffered for your sanity. And how you tried to set them free. They would not listen. They did not know how. Perhaps they'll listen now. Starry Starry Night,. Flaming flowers that brightly blaze. Swirling clouds in violet haze. reflect in Vincents eyes of china blue.. Colors changing hue.. Morning fields of amber grain,. Weathered faces lined in pain. are soothed beneath the artists loving hand. Now i understand. What you tried to say to me. and how you suffered for your sanity. and how you tried to set them free. They would not listen. They did not know how. Perhaps they'll listen now.. For they could not love you,. but still your love was true. and when no hope was left in sight. on that Starry,Starry night. you took your life as lovers often do.. But I could've told you Vincent,. this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you"
waiting for the bell to ring,"Astley/West. Do you believe it what the papers say?. They're driving me insane they push me over my limit. Do you believe it they catch me every time?. It ought to be a crime. Wo, the things they say. There ought to be a reason for turning black to white. Sometimes get the feeling that it's done to spite. They don't need a reason to turn your world around. (Chorus). I'm waiting for the bell to ring. I want the children to sing. And I'm waiting for the bad man to fall. I'm just about done with it all. Do you believe it, when politicians talk. And make, make the people walk into the fire. Do, you concede, is there no reprieve. From their power game, I know there's someone to blame. We ought to be forgiven for taking in their words. They don't even write them now is that absurd. They don't need a reason to tear your world apart. (Repeat chorus). And I'm just about done with it all. With it all. And I'm waiting, you know I'm waiting. For the angels to sing for the freedom it brings. For the bad man to fall. When the children call, I want the angels to sing. And I'm just about done with it all. And I'm waiting for the bell to ring. I want the children to sing. And I'm waiting for the bad man to fall. I'm done with it all. (Repeat chorus)."

She fills my heart . .. She fills my heart with very special things,. With angels' songs , with wild imaginings,. She fills my soul with so much love,. That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely,. With her along, who could be lonely ?. I reach for her hand, it's always there . .. How long does it last ?. Can love be measured by the hours in a day ?. I have no answers now, but this much I can say,. I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away. And she'll be there . .. She’ll be there . ."

See the jungle when it's wet with rain. Just remember 'til you're home again. You belong to me. I'll be so alone without you. Maybe you'll be lonesome too. Fly the ocean in a silver plane. See the jungle when it's wet with rain. Just remember 'til you're home again. You belong to me. (Repeat last verse)
you move me,"(Rick Astley). I go to work in my clean shirt. I push a pen until half past ten. I watch the clock there on the wall. Tic toc, why don't you call. The boss come in and walks down the aisles. He turns around but he never smiles. He watches me just like a hawk. And then he says we must talk. * You move me, from side to side. You move me and if feels so right. You move me up and down. You move me around and around. Son, he says (what) I've got bad news. Life is hard and you got the blues. I know you're good and I know you work hard. I'm sorry, son, but here are your cards. I went home and kicked off my shoes. And I asked myself why do I always lose. But then you called and everything was fine. I'm so glad that you are mine. (* repeat). You're the one thing in my life. That makes me feel so good inside. will you hold me tight tonight. Oh, girl I wish you would decide. (* repeat to fade)."
