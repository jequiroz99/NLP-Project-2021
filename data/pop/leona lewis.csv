bleeding love,"Closed off from love. I didn't need the pain. Once or twice was enough. And it was all in vain. Time starts to pass. Before you know it you're frozen. But something happened. For the very first time with you. My heart melts into the ground. Found something true. And everyone's looking round. Thinking I'm going crazy. But I don't care what they say. I'm in love with you. They try to pull me away. But they don't know the truth. My heart's crippled by the vein. That I keep on closing. You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. I keep bleeding. I keep, keep bleeding love. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. You cut me open. Trying hard not to hear. But they talk so loud. Their piercing sounds fill my ears. Try to fill me with doubt. Yet I know that the goal. Is to keep me from falling. But nothing's greater. Than the rush that comes with your embrace. And in this world of loneliness. I see your face. Yet everyone around me. Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe. But I don't care what they say. I'm in love with you. They try to pull me away. But they don't know the truth. My heart's crippled by the vein. That I keep on closing. You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. I keep bleeding. I keep, keep bleeding love. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. You cut me open. And it's draining all of me. Oh they find it hard to believe. I'll be wearing these scars. For everyone to see. I don't care what they say. I'm in love with you. They try to pull me away. But they don't know the truth. My heart's crippled by the vein. That I keep on closing. You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. I keep bleeding. I keep, keep bleeding love. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. I keep bleeding. I keep, keep bleeding love. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love"
better in time,It's been the longest winter without you. I didn't know where to turn to. See somehow I can't forget you. After all that we've been through. Going coming thought I heard a knock. Who's there no one. Thinking that I deserve it. Now I realize that I really didn't know. If you didn't notice you mean everything. Quickly I'm learning to love again. All I know is I'm gon' be ok. [Chorus:]. Thought I couldn't live without you. It's gonna hurt when it heals too. It'll all get better in time. And even though I really love you. I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to. It'll all get better in time. I couldn't turn on the TV. Without something there to remind me. Was it all that easy. To just put aside your feelings. If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh. Hurt my feelings but that's the path. I believe in. And I know that time will heal it. If you didn't notice boy you meant everything. Quickly I'm learning to love again. All I know is I'm gon' be ok. [Chorus:]. Thought I couldn't live without you. It's gonna hurt when it heals too. It'll all get better in time. And even though I really love you. I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to. It'll all get better in time. Since there's no more you and me. It's time I let you go. So I can be free. And live my life how it should be. No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you. Yes I will. [Chorus: X2]. Thought I couldn't live without you. It's gonna hurt when it heals too. It'll all get better in time. And even though I really love you. I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to. It'll all get better in time

lost then found,"Staring at tears on the pages. Of letters that I never could've write. Now I know love isn't painless,. but it's worth the risk,. It's worth the fight. Playing it over and over. I wish that I could turn back time, baby. We were wrong, but we could be right. Why do we say things we can't take back. Why do we miss what we never had. Both of us fell to the ground. The love was so lost, it couldn't be found. Why do you tend to forget who's to blame. I'm tired of crying out at the sound of your name. Why don't we turn this around, love ain't the enemy. Don't you want to be lost then found. Lost then found, lost then found. Love ain't the enemy. We could be lost then found. Empty glasses on tables, echoes fill these rooms. The memories go where we go,. There like the suitcase that you never lose. If the good lords eyes upon me. I swear to make things right. Whatever we lost, i know we can find. Why do we say things we can't take back. Why do we miss what we never had. Both of us fell to the ground. The love was so lost, it couldn't be found. Why do you tend to forget who`s to blame. I'm tired of crying out at the sound of your name. Why don't we turn this around, love ain't the enemy. Don't you want to be lost then found. No words can come without. Can't stop the rain, I wish you could take it back. But it's too late, it's too late. Why do we say things we can't take back. Why do we miss what we never had. Both of us fell to the ground. The love was so lost, it couldn't be found. Why do you tend to forget who`s to blame. I'm tired of crying out at the sound of your name. Why don't we turn this around, love ain't the enemy.

angel,"I feel it, you feel it that this was meant to be. I know it, you know it that you were made for me. We can't deny this any longer, day by day it's getting stronger. I want it, you want it,. It's what the people want to see. We're like Romeo and Juliet. Fact leaves fate to find us. Like the tallest mountain on the widest sea. Nothing's big enough to hide us.

So we take it and each moment that I pause. I see it, you see it, what we have is made of gold. We're so filled with meaning, nothing can make us shallow. So I hold it, and you hold it,. The promise of tomorrow. When we make love it's overwhelming. I just touch the heavens. You're an angel, you're an angel. And I said this world, this world could leave us any day. But my love for you, it will never go away. And I don't wanna go to sleep 'cause you were like a dream. For every night I say a prayer, well, I swear you are the answer. You're an angel, you're an angel, you're an angel. I don't need three wishes, well, I just need one. For us to never be finished, for us to never be numb. When they say it's over, we'll just say I love you. And when they say it's finished, we'll just keep on building. This world, this world could leave us any day. But my love for you, it will never go away. And I don't wanna go to sleep 'cause you were like a dream. For every night I say a prayer, well, I swear you are the answer. And I said this world, this world could leave us any day. But my love for you, it will never go away. And I don't wanna go to sleep 'cause you were like a dream.

hurt,"I hurt myself today. To see if I still feel. I focus on the pain. The only thing that's real. The needle tears a hole. The old familiar sting. Try to kill it all away. But I remember everything. What have I become. My sweetest friend. Everyone I know. Goes away in the end. And you could have it all. My empire of dirt. I will let you down. I will make you hurt. Beneath the stains of time,. The feelings disappear,. You are someone else,. I am still right here,. And you could have it all,. My empire of dirt. I will let you down. I will make you hurt. If I could start again. A million miles away. I will keep myself. I would find a way"

They can take the places that we said we will go. All the broken dreams take everything. Just take it away but they can never have yesterday. You always choose to stay. I should be thankful for everyday. Heaven knows what the future holds. Or least where the story goes. But I never believed until now. I know I'll see you again, I'm sure. No, it's not selfish to ask for more. One more night, one more day. One more smile on your face. But they cant take yesterday. They can take tomorrow and the plans we made. They can take the music that we'll never play. All the broken dreams, take everything. Just take it away but they can never have yesterday. They can take the future that we'll never know. They can take the places that we said we will go. All the broken dreams take everything. Just take it away but they can never have yesterday. I thought our days would last forever. But it wasn't our destiny. 'Cause in my mind we had so much time. But I was so wrong. No, I can, believe me. I can still find the strength in the moments we made. I'm lookin' back on yesterday.

Tears I've cried. I'll survive. I'm alive. I'm gonna get there someway. Through all the tears and the rain. And any road I can take. Just to get me some place. Where all the scars on my heart. And all the lies in the dark. Disappear in the headlights. So bright, tonight, gonna drive them away. Where do I go when I'm so alone. Where do I turn when we weren't so close. We try not to crash but we still collide. Tears I've cried. I'll survive. I'm alive. I'm alive [x3]. Ooh. I'm alive"
angel,"I feel it, you feel it that this was meant to be. I know it, you know it that you were made for me. We can't deny this any longer, day by day it's getting stronger. I want it, you want it,. It's what the people want to see. We're like Romeo and Juliet. Fact leaves fate to find us. Like the tallest mountain on the widest sea. Nothing's big enough to hide us. When we make love it's overwhelming. I just touch the heavens. You're an angel, you're an angel. I said this world, this world could leave us any day. But my love for you, it will never go away. And I don't wanna go to sleep 'cause you were like a dream. For every night I say a prayer, well, I swear you are the answer. You're an angel, you're an angel, you're an angel. So we take it and each moment that I pause. I see it, you see it, what we have is made of gold. We're so filled with meaning, nothing can make us shallow. So I hold it, and you hold it,. The promise of tomorrow. When we make love it's overwhelming. I just touch the heavens. You're an angel, you're an angel. And I said this world, this world could leave us any day. But my love for you, it will never go away. And I don't wanna go to sleep 'cause you were like a dream. For every night I say a prayer, well, I swear you are the answer. You're an angel, you're an angel, you're an angel. I don't need three wishes, well, I just need one. For us to never be finished, for us to never be numb. When they say it's over, we'll just say I love you. And when they say it's finished, we'll just keep on building. This world, this world could leave us any day. But my love for you, it will never go away. And I don't wanna go to sleep 'cause you were like a dream. For every night I say a prayer, well, I swear you are the answer. And I said this world, this world could leave us any day. But my love for you, it will never go away. And I don't wanna go to sleep 'cause you were like a dream. For every night I say a prayer, well, I swear you are the answer. You're an angel, you're an angel, you're an angel. You're an angel, you're an angel, you're an angel. You're an angel, you're an angel, you're an angel"
another love song,"How'd you break through my resistance?. Or the barriers I built. My head refused to listen. But my heart knows how I feel. Tried to tell myself it's useless. Let the butterflies just flutter by. But your hold on me, it's worthless. Never thought that I'd. Never thought I'd write another love song. Never thought I'd say these words to you. Never thought I'd write another love song. But I can't keep on fighting with you. I love you (I, I love you). I love you (I, I love you). I love you (I, I love you). I do, I love you. Didn't take ""no"" for answer. Why'd you let me torture you?. When I made you keep your hands off. Stick around and follow the rules. Gladiator with a sweetness. Holding heaven in your arms. Tried to scare you, but you're fearless. Won the battle for my heart. Never thought I'd write another love song. Never thought I'd say these words to you. Never thought I'd write another love song. But I can't keep on fighting with you. I love you (I, I love you). I love you (I, I love you). I love you (I, I love you). I do, I love you. I love you I love you, you. I, I love you I, I love you. Never thought about (I, I love you). Never thought I'd write another love song. Never thought I'd say these words to you. Never thought I'd write another love song. But I can't keep on fighting with you. I love you (I, I love you). I love you (I, I love you). I love you (I, I love you). I do, I love you"
better in time,It's been the longest winter without you. I didn't know where to turn to. See somehow I can't forget you. After all that we've been through. Going coming thought I heard a knock. Who's there no one. Thinking that I deserve it. Now I realize that I really didn't know. If you didn't notice you mean everything. Quickly I'm learning to love again. All I know is I'm gon' be ok. [Chorus:]. Thought I couldn't live without you. It's gonna hurt when it heals too. It'll all get better in time. And even though I really love you. I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to. It'll all get better in time. I couldn't turn on the TV. Without something there to remind me. Was it all that easy. To just put aside your feelings. If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh. Hurt my feelings but that's the path. I believe in. And I know that time will heal it. If you didn't notice boy you meant everything. Quickly I'm learning to love again. All I know is I'm gon' be ok. [Chorus:]. Thought I couldn't live without you. It's gonna hurt when it heals too. It'll all get better in time. And even though I really love you. I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to. It'll all get better in time. Since there's no more you and me. It's time I let you go. So I can be free. And live my life how it should be. No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you. Yes I will. [Chorus: X2]. Thought I couldn't live without you. It's gonna hurt when it heals too. It'll all get better in time. And even though I really love you. I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to. It'll all get better in time

Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe. But I don't care what they say. I'm in love with you. They try to pull me away. But they don't know the truth. My heart's crippled by the vein.

Putting all my love 'round one. Now it's on, bring it on, bring it on. Oh, I'm breaking free. I'm taking the leap. These borders are deep. But I'm feeling, I'm feeling the essence of me. These mountains are steep. But there's no stopping me. I'm feeling, I'm feeling the essence of me. The essence of me, the essence of me. The essence of me, the essence.

When you feel unloved. When it all falls through. I got you. I will hold your high. I'll be by your side. When it all falls through. I got you. When you lose your faith. When you're out of place. When the water's deep. And it's hard to breathe. When the bottles close. When you've lost control. Hope against all hope. So far from home. [Chorus]. I got you ooh. I got you ooh. I got you ooh. Through the darkness. And the heartless. When the rain won't stop. When you feel unloved. When it all falls through. I got you. I will hold your high. I'll be by your side. When it all falls through. I got you. When the rain won't stop. When it all falls through. I got you
i miss you missing me,"Someone told me. That you found somebody. Found somebody new. I'm happy for you. Maybe that's why. I don't hear from you. Like I used to like a faded photograph.

I miss you missing me. Guess you won't be. Asking 'bout me. When you see my friends. Guess that had to end. I won't be hearing. What you've been up to. Like I used to had our time. Our time has passed. No there's no going back. But sometimes. Sometimes. I miss you missing me. Calling me on the phone. Asking me how I'm doing. Asking if I'm alone. I miss you missing me. I miss you missing me. I miss you missing me. When someone calls me up at night. I hold my breath, I close my eyes. I wait and hope and pray it will be you. Calling me on the phone. Asking me how I'm doing. Asking me if I'm alone. I miss you missing me. I miss you missing me. I miss you missing me. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you missing me.

i wish it could be christmas everyday,"Oh, when the snowman brings the snow. Oh well, he just might like to know. He's put a great big smile. On somebody's face. If you jump into your bed.

When the kids start singing and the band begins to play. Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday. Let the bells ring out for Christmas. When we're skating in the park. If the storm cloud paints it dark. Then your rosy cheeks are gonna light. My merry way. Now the frosticals appeared. And they've frozen up my beard. And so we'll lie by the fire. Till the sleep simply melts them all away. Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday. When the kids start singing and the band begins to play. Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday. Let the bells ring out for Christmas. Oh, when the snowman brings the snow. Oh well, he just might like to know. He's put a great big smile. On somebody's face. So if Santa brings that sleigh. All around the Milky Way. I'll sign my name on the rooftop in the snow. Then he may decide to stay. Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday. When the kids start singing and the band begins to play. Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday. Let the bells ring out for Christmas. Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday.

stone hearts & hand grenades,"You were like the crash of thunder. Echo through my darkest nights. You awake all my senses. Made me feel alive. Even if we try to fight it.

the best and the worst,"It's been one too many days wondering what I did wrong. One too many days hoping to hear the phone. One too many days feeling all alone. Maybe it's time for me to move on. So I'm taking the hurt, the bruises and ruins. The stones from the wreckage to build something knew. Sometimes a lot makes you search for the truth. Sometimes the worst brings the best out of you. Sometimes the worst brings the best out of you. All this emptiness is space for me to breathe again. Lonliness is finding my own freedom. Through the shame I told myself to walk with grace. One day you'll regret those heartless things you said. So I'm taking the hurt, the bruises and ruins. Tearing it down, down, to build something knew. Sometimes a lot makes you search for the truth. Sometimes the worst brings the best out of you. Sometimes the worst brings the best out of you. I won't look back, I wish you well. I lost my way but found myself. Taking the hurt, the bruises and ruins. Tearing it down, down, to build something knew. Sometimes a lot makes you search for the truth. Sometimes the worst brings the best out of you. Sometimes the worst brings the best out of you. Sometimes the worst brings the best out of you. Sometimes the worst brings the best out of you"

What we needed was a less us. I fell in love with the wrong dream. Crying in my arms what's it all mean?. I used to know those things and flow both wings. Starts where neverending and no new board games. And we fought for it back depending on my new jack swing. Cool, calm and collected keep the cool scene. Here is hoping. You satisfy man as an addict.

Whenever it is in my life. I'll be on time. 'Cause you know why there's no standing in my way. And if you're lost, I'm gonna find you. 'Cause without you I'll break down and cry.

white christmas,I'm dreaming of a white Christmas. Just like the ones I used to know. Where the treetops glisten. and children listen. To hear sleigh bells in the snow. I'm dreaming of a white Christmas. With every Christmas card I write. May your days be merry and bright. And may all your Christmases be white. I'm dreaming of a white Christmas. With every Christmas card I write. May your days be merry and bright. And may all your Christmases be white
winter wonderland,Sleigh bells ring. Are you listening. In the lane. Snow is glistening. A beautiful sight. We're happy tonight. Walking in a winter wonderland. Gone away is the bluebird. Here to stay is a new bird. He sings a love song. As we go along. Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman. And pretend that he is Parson Brown. He'll say Are you married. We'll say No Man. But you can do the job. When you're in town. Later on. We'll conspire. As we dream by the fire. To face unafraid. The plans that we've made. Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman. And pretend that he's a circus clown. We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman. Until the other kiddies knock him down. When it snows. Ain't it thrilling. Though your nose gets a chilling. We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way. Walking in a winter wonderland. Walking in a winter wonderland. Walking in a winter wonderland
yesterday,"I just can't believe you're gone. Still waitin' for mornin' to come. When I see if the sun will rise. In the way that you're by my side. When we had so much in store. Tell me what is it I'm reaching for. When we're through building memories. I'll hold yesterday in my heart, in my heart. They can take tomorrow and the plans we made. They can take the music that we'll never play. All the broken dreams, take everything. Just take it away but they can never have yesterday. They can take the future that we'll never know. They can take the places that we said we will go. All the broken dreams take everything. Just take it away but they can never have yesterday. You always choose to stay. I should be thankful for everyday. Heaven knows what the future holds. Or least where the story goes. But I never believed until now. I know I'll see you again, I'm sure. No, it's not selfish to ask for more. One more night, one more day. One more smile on your face. But they cant take yesterday. They can take tomorrow and the plans we made. They can take the music that we'll never play. All the broken dreams, take everything. Just take it away but they can never have yesterday. They can take the future that we'll never know. They can take the places that we said we will go. All the broken dreams take everything. Just take it away but they can never have yesterday. I thought our days would last forever. But it wasn't our destiny. 'Cause in my mind we had so much time. But I was so wrong. No, I can, believe me. I can still find the strength in the moments we made. I'm lookin' back on yesterday. They can take tomorrow and the plans we made. They can take the music that we'll never play. All the broken dreams, take everything. Just take it away but they can never have yesterday. They can take the future that we'll never know. They can take the places that we said we will go. All the broken dreams take everything. Just take it away but they can never have yesterday. All the broken dreams take everything. They can never have yesterday. Â© JAM MUSIC; EMI APRIL MUSIC INC.;. BREAKTHROUGH CREATIONS;"
you bring me down,"[Chorus]. You let me down, can't fix you now. Thought I could count on you to be around. You bring me down, down, down way down. What is the problem?. Are you taking me seriously?. Is it a joke to you?. Or maybe I'm a fool. Why am I trying?. So hard to be the girl that you need. How is this fair to me?. When you break through. This is too much. Don't call it love. You are the reason it's so hard to trust. Boy this ain't what I wanted. And now it's got to stop. [Chorus]. No more tears. Why did I let you have so much control?. I gave my arm to you. And you pushed me away. Why are you here oh?. Don't you see I'm letting you go?. The damage is done baby. I have nothing to say. It's gone to far. Don't know who you are. I think its better that we are apart. Boy I know where I am. And I know where youâre near. [Chorus 2x]. Would you like it if. I did the same thing to. You and I lasted. Walking years on ma shoes. Boy there's no excuse. Cause of what you did there's no me and you. Would you like it if. I did the same thing. You wouldn't have liked. Walking in time. Boy there's no excuse. That's who you are and I'm so over you. [Chorus 2x]. Down, down. Stop bringing me, stop bringing me. Down, down. Oooh"
you don't care,All those tears from yesterday. They didn't wash away the pain. So long overdue. Those tears were for you. Don't say you love me again. Just because you see the end. Don't act like you care. It's too late to pretend. I never wanted to burn outrageous. But I'm so tired. So hard to walk away. But I can`t wish for yesterday. Ohh ohhhh. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose you. But it's so hard when you don't care anymore. Our love was amazing. Now it's not worth saving. Something tells me you don't care. You don't care anymore. Someday soon you'll understand. When no one`s there to hold your hand. When loneliness is your only friend. I'm not saying there won't be. Another time for you and me. I won't let love die. Or let you hurt me again. I never wanted to burn outrageous. But I'm so tired. I don't want to walk away. But I can't wish for yesterday. Ohh ohhh. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose you. But it's so hard when you don't care anymore. Our love was amazing. Now it's not worth saving. Something tells me you don't care. You don't care anymore. Someday when you're all alone. When you've got no hand to hold. You will think of me. Ohh ohhh. I don't want to lose you. Don't want to lose you. Something tells me you don't care. You don't care. Ohh ohhh. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose you. But it's so hard when you don't care anymore. Our love was amazing. Now it's not worth saving. Something tells me you don't care. You don't care anymore. Ohhh anymore. You don't care anymore. Woahhh woahhh you don't care anymore. Woahhh you don't care. You don't care anymore
you knew me when,"Take a look, look into my eyes. You'll see someone you don't recognize. You'll see someone who looks like me. But I'm not the me I used to be. Found I could fall, but I could get up. And after all, I could hold my head up. I made it out, I made it through. I'm someone now, I'm someone new. But you could say you knew me then. You could say you knew me when. You knew me when I was on the edge. And my confidence was shattered. You knew me when I didn't know my worth. Didn't know how much I mattered. You knew me when you thought you could get me down, no. You knew me when, you knew me then. But you don't know me now. You look surprised to see I've changed. But I've turned the key and I've turned the page. Stepped out the dark into the sun. To a whole new me that I've become. I was scared, had so much fear then. Now I'm free, now I'm fearless. Took too much for too long. I'm someone now, I'm someone strong. And you could say you knew me then. You could say you knew me when. You knew me when I was on the edge. And my confidence was shattered. You knew me when I didn't know my worth. Didn't know how much I mattered. You knew me when you thought you could get me down, no. You knew me when, you knew me then. But you don't know me now. I'm a little wiser, reaching higher. It's a battle but I'm a fighter. This time there'll be no surrender, no. And you could say you knew me when. You could say you knew me when. You knew me when I was on the edge. And my confidence was shattered. You knew me when I didn't know my worth. Didn't know how much I mattered. You knew me when you thought you could get me down, no. You knew me when. You knew me when, you knew me then. But you don't know me now. You knew me then, you knew me when. But you don't know me now"
your hallelujah,"Winter's cold, in the light. Somebody's waiting. Feel the warmth, safe and sound now. All the joy, all the fears. You can let go now. Watch the snow gently fall down. Someone needs you. Someone loves you. Hallelujah. Now you're coming home. Hallelujah. Angels calling out to you. You can hear them sing your hallelujah. Silver sky, take my hand. Just let me hold you. When you're here you'll be alright. Someone needs you. Someone loves you. Hallelujah. Now you're coming home. Hallelujah. Angels calling out to you. You can hear them sing your hallelujah. All of our memories get frozen in time. But I'll keep them here on the inside. Every December your star lights the sky. Someone needs you. Someone loves you. Someone needs you. Someone loves you. Hallelujah. Now you're coming home. Hallelujah. Angels calling out to you. You can hear them sing. You can hear them sing. You can hear them singing your hallelujah"
