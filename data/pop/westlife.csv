if i let you go,"Day after day. Time passed away. And I just can't get you off my mind. Nobody knows, I hide it inside. I keep on searching but I can't find. The courage to show, to letting you know. I've never felt so much love before. And once again I'm thinking about. Taking the easy way out. But if I let you go I will never know. What my life would be holding you close to me. Will I ever see you smiling back at me?. How will I know. If I let you go?. Night after night I hear myself say. Why can't this feeling just fade away?. There's no one like you. You speak to my heart. It's such a shame we're worlds apart. I'm too shy to ask. I'm too proud to lose. But sooner or later I gotta choose. And once again I'm thinking about. Taking the easy way out. But if I let you go I will never know. What my life would be holding you close to me. Will I ever see you smiling back at me?. How will I know. If I let you go?. If I let you go. Baby.

mandy,"I remember all my life. Raining down as cold as ice,. Shadows of a man. A face through a window. Crying in the night. The night goes into. Morning, just another day. Happy people pass my way. Looking in their eyes. I see a memory. I never realized. How happy you made me oh Mandy. Well you came and you gave without taking. But I sent you away, oh Mandy. Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking. And I need you today, oh Mandy. I'm standing on the edge of time. I´ve walked away when love was mine. Caught up in a world of uphill climbing. The tears are in my mind. And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy. Well you came and you gave without taking. But I sent you away, oh Mandy. Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking. And I need you today, oh Mandy. Yesterday's a dream I face the morning. Crying on the breeze. The pain is calling, oh Mandy. Well you came and you gave without taking. But I sent you away, oh Mandy. Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking. And I need you today, oh Mandy. Well you came and you gave without taking. But I sent you away, oh Mandy. Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking. And I need you.... Oh Mandy won't you listen to what I'm gonna say. Oh, baby don't you let me throw it all away.

fragile heart,"A fragile heart was broken before. I don't think it could endure another pain. But there's a voice from deep inside of you. That's calling out to make you realise.

So forget your past and we can dream tomorrow. Save our hearts for care and lovin' too. It's hard, I know, but oh one thing's for sure. Don't go and break this fragile heart.. A hurting mind in need of emotion. I don't think I could endure another pain. But baby in you, I've found affection. Affection I have never felt before. So don't let your past. Destroy what comes tomorrow. Don't go and break this fragile heart. With all this fire that burns between us. There's so much to lose, yet so much more to gain. And if I could choose the world around me. The world I choose would all revolve around you. So help me complete the game inside me. And help to mend, to mend this fragile heart.."

I give it all up to you. And everything that’s been keeping me together. Brings me to my knees. I get weak. One look. One touch. Oh I’m helplessly pretending. You don’t mean that much. It gets so hard. The waiting here forever with this shattered heart. Lying to myself tryin’a act like I don’t care. The way it's killing me everytime that you're not there. Cause I get weak.

i'm already there,He called her on the road. From a lonely cold hotel room. Just to hear her say: 'I love you'. One more time. And when he heard the sound. Of the kids laughing in the background. He had to wipe away a tear from his eye. A little voice came on the phone. Said 'daddy when you coming home?'. He said the first thing that came to his mind. . I'm already there. Take a look around. I'm the sunshine in your hair. I'm the shadow on the ground. I'm the whisper in the wind. I'm your imaginary friend. And I know. That I'm in your prayers. Ooh I'm already there. She got back on the phone. Said I really miss you darling. Don't worry about the kids. They'll be alright. Wish I was in your arms. Lying right there beside you. But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight. And I'll gently kiss your lips. Touch you with my fingertips. So turn out the lights. And close your eyes. I'm already there. Don't make a sound. I'm the beat in your heart. I'm the moonlight shinning down. I'm the whisper in the wind. And I'll be there till the end. Can you feel the love that we share. Ooh I'm already there. We may be a thousand miles apart. But I'll be with you. Wherever you are. I'm already there. Take a look around. I'm the sunshine in your hair. I'm the shadow on the ground. I'm the whisper in the wind. And I'll be there till the end. When you feel the love that we share. Ooh I'm already there. I'm already there
i'm missing loving you,"(Bryan). I can figure it out in my head. Nearly time that we put this to bed. It feels like it's over. I'm tired and a mess. You forgive me for my big mistake. Then keep throwing it back in my face. We'll both end up lonely. If we can't put this straight. Well, I guess it might seem. I don't want you. But I still need you now. (Chorus). I love it when you fall asleep at night. Coz I can hear the bell that stops the fight. I know that when the darkness turns to light. The fight will take over. I'm missing loving you. Can't stand living with you. But don't wanna live without you. I'm missing loving you. (Mark). Well, it first started out like a phase. Now it's come to its changing ways. Acting so crazy. But sorries come too late. Seems you started to feel like a fool. Telling all of our friends that we're cool. Truth is I'm lonely. Even though you're by my side. And I guess we might as well just end this. Coz I don't feel you now. (Chorus). (Shane). I think about the future now. I'll stand by you forever. (Mark). But baby you just gotta let me know. Hey yeah. (Bryan). I love it when you fall asleep at night. Coz I can hear the bell that stops the fight. I know that when the darkness turns to light. The fight will take over. (All). Can't stand living with you. But don't wanna live without you. (Chorus - twice)"
if,"If a picture paints a thousand words,. Then why can't I paint you?. The words will never show the you I've come to know.. If a face could launch a thousand ships,. Then where am I to go?. There's no one home but you,. You're all that's left me too.. And when my love for life is running dry,. You come and pour yourself on me.. If a man could be two places at one time,. I'd be with you.. Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.. If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die,. I'd spend the end with you.. And when the world was through,. Then one by one the stars would all go out,. Then you and I would simply fly away"

if i let you go,"Day after day. Time passed away. And I just can't get you off my mind. Nobody knows, I hide it inside. I keep on searching but I can't find. The courage to show, to letting you know. I've never felt so much love before. And once again I'm thinking about. Taking the easy way out. But if I let you go I will never know. What my life would be holding you close to me. Will I ever see you smiling back at me?. How will I know. If I let you go?. Night after night I hear myself say. Why can't this feeling just fade away?. There's no one like you. You speak to my heart. It's such a shame we're worlds apart. I'm too shy to ask. I'm too proud to lose. But sooner or later I gotta choose. And once again I'm thinking about. Taking the easy way out. But if I let you go I will never know. What my life would be holding you close to me. Will I ever see you smiling back at me?. How will I know. If I let you go?. If I let you go. Baby. And once again I'm thinking about. Taking the easy way out. But if I let you go I will never know. What my life would be holding you close to me. Will I ever see you smiling back at me?. How will I know. If I let you go?. But if I let you go I will never know. Will I ever see you smiling back at me?. How will I know. If I let you go?"
if tomorrow never comes,Sometimes late at night. I lie awake and watch her sleeping. She's lost in peaceful dreams. So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark. And the thought crosses my mind. If I never wake up in the morning. Would she ever doubt the way I feel. About her in my heart. Chorus. If tomorrow never comes. Will she know how much I loved her. That I try in every way. To show her every day. That she's my only one. If my time on earth were through. And she must face the world without me. Is the love I gave her in the past. Gonna be enough to last. If tomorrow never comes. 'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life. Who never knew how much I loved them. Now I live with the regret. That my true feelings for them never were revealed. So I made a promise to myself. To say each day how much she means to me. And avoid that circumstance. Where there's no second chance. To tell her how I feel. Chorus. So tell that someone that you love. Just what you're thinking of. If tomorrow never comes. .

like a rose,And as I look into your eyes. I see an angel in disguise. Sent from God above. For me to love. To hold and idolise. And as I hold your body near. I'll see this month through to a year. And then forever on. 'Til life is gone. I'll keep your loving near. And now I've finally found my way. To lead me down this lonely road. All I have to do. Is follow you. To lighten off my load. You treat me like a rose. You give me room to grow. You shone the light of love on me. And gave me air so I can breathe. You open doors that close. In a world where anything goes. You give me strength so I stand tall. Within this bed of earth. Just like a rose. And when I feel like hope is gone. You give me strength to carry on. Each time I look at you. There's something new. To keep our loving strong. I hear you whisper in my ear. All of the words I long to hear. Of how you'll always be. Here next to me. To wipe away my tears. And now I've finally found my way. To lead me down this lonely road. All I have to do is follow you. To lighten off my load. You treat me like a rose. You give me room to grow. You shone the light of love on me. And gave me air so I can breathe. You open doors that close. In a world where anything goes. You give me strength so I stand tall. Within this bed of earth. Just like a rose.

You shone the light of love on me. And gave me air so I can breathe. You open doors that close. In a world where anything goes. You give me strength so I stand tall. Within this bed of earth. Just like a rose. You give me strength so I stand tall. Within this bed of earth. Just like a rose

miss you nights,Miss You Nights. [Shane:]. I've had many times I can tell you. Times when innocence I'd trade for company. And children saw me crying. I thought I'd had my share of that.

she's back,Took some time to heal. To get my heartbeat back. Just when I'm ahead. Returning from the dead. She's back again.... She knows just what to say. She always gets her way. Just when I was free. She's back inside of me. She's back again. . So tell me why the hell I hear music. Every time she calls I hear music. Is it just the way she loves to confuse me. Oh baby. Just when I moved on. Believed that she was gone. She's back again.... She's back again. Like a predator and prey. She'll tear my heart away. She'll chew me to the bone. Leave me rotting here alone. 'Til she's back again. post By Lino Gonçalves PT

As I lay here beside you. And I look in your eyes. I know without you in my life. It just wouldn't survive. (Mark:). And who knows what the future holds?. And we'll never know.

smile,"Smile, though your heart is aching.. Smile, even though it's breaking.. When there are clouds in the sky,. You'll get by.... If you smile through your fears and sorrows.. Smile and maybe tomorrow. You'll see the sun come shining through.. If you just light up your face with gladness,. Hide every trace of sadness.. Although a tear may be ever, ever so near.. That's the time you must keep on trying.. Smile, what's the use of crying?. You'll find life is still worthwhile. If you'll just smile.. That's the time you must keep on trying.. Smile, what's the use of crying?. You'll find life is still worthwhile. If you'll just smile."
soledad,If only you could see the tears in. The world you left behind. If only you could heal my heart. Just one more time. Even when I close my eyes. There's an image of your face. And once again I come to realise. You're a loss I can't replace. (Chourus). Soledad. It's a keeping for the lonely. Since the day that you were gone. Why did you leave me. Soledad. In my heart you were the only. And your memory lives on. Why did you leave me. Soledad. Walking down the streets of Nothingville. Where our love was young and free. I cant believe just what an empty place. It has come to be. I would give my life away. If it could only be the same. Cuz I can't still the voice inside of me. That is calling out your name. (Chourus). Time will never change the things. You told me. And after all were meant to be. Love will bring us back to you and me. If only you could see. (Repeat chourus till end).
solitaire,"There was a man, a lonely man,. Who lost his love through his indifference. A heart that cared, that went unshared,. Until it died within his silence. (Chorus:). And solitaire's the only game in town. And every road that takes him takes him down. While love goes on around him everywhere. He's playing solitaire. A little hope goes up in smoke,. Just how it goes,. Goes without saying. There was a man, a lonely man,. Who would command the hand he's paling. (repeat chorus). And keeping to himself begins to deal. And still the king of hearts is well concealed. While love goes and on around him everywhere. He's playing solitaire"

When there's no one else around. I still pray. That our love can be found.
something right,"Never thought that I'd be so inspired. Never thought that I would find a higher truth. I believed that love was overrated. Till the moment I found you.

summer wind,"The summer wind came blowing in from across the sea. It lingered there, to touch your hair and walk with me. All summer long we sang a song and then we strolled that golden sand. Two sweethearts and the summer wind.. Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flying by. The world was new beneath the blue umbrella sky. Then softer than a piper man, one day it called to you. I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind.. The autumn wind and the winter winds they have come and gone. Still the days, those lonely days, they go on and on. And guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end.... My fickle friend. The summer wind, the summer wind. One summer wind, the summer wind."

the difference,"I wake my faith shaken inside. Images of you race to mind. Did I forget I meant to tell you something?. Only half 'til you have to fall. Only whole when you?re seeing it all.

Oh I fell I?m not down. You showed me the difference. Everything was slipping right through my hands. Hard to find any place to land. Clouds don?t cover me where I stand anymore. Only half 'til you think you lost. Only whole when you?re reaching across. You saved something for me. (Chorus). You resurrected me. Eyes wide open to dream. In scattered pieces when you found me. (Chorus). You showed me the difference. You showed me the difference"

I say love. It is a flower. And you. Its only seed.. It's the heart. Afraid of breaking. That never. Learns to dance. It's the dream. Afraid of waking. That never. Takes the chance. It's the one. Who won't be taken. Who cannot seem to give. And the soul. Afraid of dying. That never. Learns to live.. When the night. Has been too lonely. And the road. Has been too long.. And you think. That love is only. For the lucky. And the strong.. Just remember. In the winter. Far beneath. The bitter snow. Lies the seed. That with the Sun's love,. In the spring,. Becomes the rose"

verdict,"I will confess to you. Because you made me think about the times. You turn the picture on to me and I'll turn over. The vision was a masterpiece of comic timing. But you wouldn't laugh at all. And I wonder what the boy was thinking. The picture was an old collage of something classical. The model with a tragic air. Because without a doubt he'd given up the fight. The ghost of somebody at his side. I will confess to you. Because I didn't think about the message. As I walked down the alleyway it was a Sunday. And all my friends deserted me because you painted me. As the fraud I really was. And if you think you see with just your eyes you're mad. 'Cause Lisa learned a lot from putting on a blindfold. When she knew she had been bad. She met another blind kid at a fancy dress. It was the best sex she ever had. I'll send a dress to you. Because it's needing badly taken in. But I was so embarressed when I missed your party. It was me that paid for it eventually. Because you know how much I wanted. To meet your friend the star of stage and local press. The dream of all the bowlie boys that hang around here. And I'm no different from the rest. I'm not too proud to say that I'm okay with. The girl next door who's famous for showing her breasts. You're not impressed by me. But it's a funny way for you to tell me. A whisper in a choir stall. The man was talking about you simultaneously. Frankly, I let my heavy eyelids flutter. Because I have been sleeping badly lately. I know you were historical from all the books I've read. But I thought you could be bluffing. And with this chance I've missed I feel remiss. It's days and months before I see you again."

what becomes of the broken hearted,"As I walk this land of broken dreams. I have visions of many things. But a happiness is just an illusion. Filled with sadness and confusion. What becomes of the broken hearted. Who had love that's now departed. I know I've got to find. Some kind of peace of mind, maybe. The roots of love grow all around. But for me they come a tumblin' down. Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger. I can't stand this pain much longer. I walk in shadows searching for light. Cold and alone, no comfort in sight. Hoping and praying for someone who cares. Always moving and going nowhere. What becomes of the broken hearted. Who had love that's now departed. I know I've got to find. Some kind of peace of mind, help me please. I'm sent to know I don't succeed. Someones love ,there's a growing need. All is lost there's no place for beginning. All that's left is unhappy ending. Now what becomes of the broken hearted. Who had love thats now departed. I know I've got to find. Some kind of peace of mind. I'll be searching everywhere. Just to find someone to care. I'll be looking everyday. I know I'm gonna find a way. Nothings gonna stop me now. I'll find a way somehow. What becomes of the broken hearted. Who had love that's now departed. I know I've got to find. Some kind of peace of mind, maybe."

Oh no, I can't think of nothing else but you (else but you) suddenly. Why do I love you. Don't even want to. Why do I love you like I do. Like I always do. You should have told me. Why did you had to be untrue. (Love you like I do). Why do I love you like I do. Why do I love you. Don't even want to. Why do I love you like I do. Like I always do. You should have told me. Why did you had to be untrue. (Love you like I do). Why do I love you like I do."
wide open,"Why do I try to hide. These feelings deep inside?. But tonight seems too long. To live this life, all alone. I guess I'll have to wait. It's almost more than I can take. Is it written in the stars?. This kingdom in your eyes. This world could be ours. So letting go tonight. And handing you the knife. If you cut me wide open. There's a love here unspoken. A heart overflowing. Dreaming of your kiss. I'm standing here hoping. For the moment you say when. Touching your skin, giving. You kill me everytime. I would die for you. I could go on and pretend. And play the fool again. How can I just walk away. From everything I feel. When all I wanna say. These scars'll never heal. And they'll never go away. So cut me wide open. There's a love here unspoken. A heart overflowing. Dreaming of your kiss. I'm standing here hoping. For the moment you say when. Touching your skin, giving. You kill me everytime. I would die for you.... There's no way to explain to you. Just cutting through my veins. I can't take it any longer. This feeling's getting stronger every day, yeah-ah. If you cut me wide open. There's a love here unspoken. A heart overflowing. Dreaming of your kiss. I'm standing here hoping. For the moment you say when. Touching your skin, giving. You kill me everytime. I would die for you.... (ooh-ooh). I would die for you.... I would die for you.... I would die for you"
wonderful tonight,"Tonight, tonight, tonight (3x). It's late in the evening. She's wondering what clothes to wear. She puts on her make-up and brushes her long brown hair. And then she asks me do I look alright. And I say yes, you look wonderful tonight. We go to a party (we go out). And everyone turns to see. This beautiful lady (beautiful lady) who's walking around with me. And then she asks me do I feel alright. And I say yes, I feel wonderful tonight. Tonight, tonight, tonight. I feel wonderful because I see the love that's right in your eyes. And the wonder of it all is that you just don't realise how much I love you. It's time to go home now yes it is. And I've got an aching head. So I gave her the car keys. And she helped me in to bed. And then I tell her as I turn down the lights. I say darling, you were wonderful tonight. You look wonderful, you're everything I need and more. You look wonderful, so beautiful tonight. You look wonderful, you never leave me wanting more. You look wonderful, so beautiful tonight.
