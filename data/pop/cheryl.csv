under the sun,"We all got light days. Gets stuck in the face. I can see the sun is shining bright right on through the haze. I complain to say. Is this really my life. Now that I'm over you, and I'm sober too. I can finally feel alive. But I won't give you my heart,. Cause it don't break twice. Just to let you know, let you know. And if you play the part, and play it real nice. Baby I'll let go, I'll let go. I'm sure you'll tell me anything under the sun. Like how you think I'm special and the only one. Cause normally I'll probably just get up and run. But you're looking so damn good to me under the sun. Under the sun. Are we on the same page, don't need to play. All these games just to get a little. Feel the sunshine on my face. And I feel pain, today,. Is this really my life. Now that I'm over you, and I'm sober too. I can finally feel alive. But I won't give you my heart,. Cause it don't break twice. Just to let you know, let you know. And if you play the part, and play it real nice. Baby I'll let go, I'll let go. I'm sure you'll tell me anything under the sun. Like how you think I'm special and the only one. Cause normally I'll probably just get up and run. But you're looking so damn good to me under the sun. Well do you get, do you get what I need, na na na. Could you show me something that I want to see, na na na na na. And maybe you can get underneath, na na na na na. If you watch the sun go down on me, na na na na na. Go down on me!. I'm sure you'll tell me anything under the sun. Like how you think I'm special and the only one. Cause normally I'll probably just get up and run. But you looking so damn good to me under the sun"
it's about time,"I'm asking myself if living without a feeling is really living. Is having everything any good. If everything's all you have. I locked myself away. I became untouchable. Got colder by the day. Dreaming of blue skies. Nothing in my way, just the person in the mirror. Take me to the flame. It's now or never. It's about time that I start loving again. It's about time the sunshine touches my skin. I won't give in til my heart beats again. Will somebody show me what I've been missing. Yeah, it's about time that I start loving again. For all that time I was so scared of flying so I stuck to the running. But I'm not running anymore. I'm dancing my nights away. Now I'm wide awake. I've got my eye on the horizon. Watch me fly away. Into the blue sky. Nothing in my way, just the person in the mirror. Take me to the flame. It's now or never. It's about time that I start loving again. It's about time the sunshine touches my skin. I won't give in til my heart beats again. Will somebody show me what I've been missing. Yeah, it's about time that I start loving again. Each bottled up emotion. Each tear I never cried. I need a big explosion. It's time for me to fly. Each bottled up emotion. Each tear I never cried. I need a big explosion. It's time for me to fly. It's about time that I start loving again. It's about time the sunshine touches my skin. I won't give in til my heart beats again. Will somebody show me what I've been missing. Yeah, it's about time that I start loving again. Each bottled up emotion. Each tear I never cried. I need a big explosion. It's time for me to fly. Each bottled up emotion. Each tear I never cried. I need a big explosion. It's time for me to fly"
stand up,"(Chorus:). Cuz I came here to dance. I'm gonna put up my hands,. And stand up, stand up. Cuz I came here to dance. I'm gonna put up my hands. And stand up, stand up. Get up, get up. When the music gets a hold of you. Get up, get up. When the music gets control of you. Get up, get up. When the music gets a hold of you. Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up. I can see the light calling me out. I can see the searchlight spinning around. I can see the moment where I belong. I can see the music turning me on. Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (on). Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (turning me on). (Chorus). I've got this emotion covering me. While moving in the fast lane taking the lead. There's nowhere to hide a feeling this strong. I can feel the music turning me on. Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (on). Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (turning me on). (Chorus). Ok Cheryl, let's dance, cos I just copped my advance. ""So I can slide on my Louboutins"". And I'm a put on my brand new Vans. And take it to the club. I don't give a what, and you don't give a what. We goin' while out like we just got paid. Looking so fresh in our Rockstar shades. (Chorus)"

intro,"What makes you itch?. What sort of a situation would you like?. Let's suppose. I do this often in vocational guidance of students. They come to me and say, well. ""we're getting out of college and we have the faintest idea. What we want to do"". So I always ask the question. ""what would you like to do if money were no object?. How would you really enjoy spending your life? "". Well, it's so amazing. As a result of our kind of educational system. Crowds of students say well, we'd like to be painters. We'd like to be poets, we'd like to be writers. But as everybody knows you can't earn any money that way. Or another person says well. I'd like to live an out-of-doors life and ride horses. I said you want to teach in a riding school?. Let's go through with it. What do you want to do?. When we finally got down to something. Which the individual says he really wants to do. I will say to him, you do that and forget the money. Because, if you say. That getting the money is the most important thing. You will spend your life completely wasting your time. You'll be doing things you don't like doing. In order to go on living. That is to go on doing things you don't like doing. Which is stupid. And so, therefore. It's so important to consider this question. What do I desire?"
it's about time,"I'm asking myself if living without a feeling is really living. Is having everything any good. If everything's all you have. I locked myself away. I became untouchable. Got colder by the day. Dreaming of blue skies. Nothing in my way, just the person in the mirror. Take me to the flame. It's now or never. It's about time that I start loving again. It's about time the sunshine touches my skin. I won't give in til my heart beats again. Will somebody show me what I've been missing. Yeah, it's about time that I start loving again. For all that time I was so scared of flying so I stuck to the running. But I'm not running anymore. I'm dancing my nights away. Now I'm wide awake. I've got my eye on the horizon. Watch me fly away. Into the blue sky. Nothing in my way, just the person in the mirror. Take me to the flame. It's now or never. It's about time that I start loving again. It's about time the sunshine touches my skin. I won't give in til my heart beats again. Will somebody show me what I've been missing. Yeah, it's about time that I start loving again. Each bottled up emotion. Each tear I never cried.
