We'll have to wait to the morning. The sun will never go down. And we'll be this way forever. I guarantee you that. Just stay awake, stay awake. You can feel it just the way it goes. Just stay awake, stay awake. Believe it. Take my faith in your hands. We have a lot that hasn't near begun. Something is calling us, we're breaking free. I'm curious, I need to see. Our dreams was lower than this. I flash before our dreams. Like a flash before our eyes. Running through the night. And if it feels like you're dreaming. Believe it, believe it. We'll have to wait to the morning. The sun will never go down. And we'll be this way forever. I guarantee you that. Just stay awake, stay awake. You can feel it just the way it goes. Just stay awake, stay awake"

swimming pool,"Breathe in, you're not used to. Tread floors, you don't fall through. Make waves, you crush the simple art. Follow no one, always play the wrong card. Waste days, in foreign places. Shed light, on your better side. Reassure me, that you'll wait for me. Wait for me, as long as it takes. And I'll hold my breath, I'll hold my breath. Between me leaving and the news. We'll dance alone between the trees. We go, the buildings turn to dust. Full of diamonds just for us. You are the shifter of my shape. We're making sense of our escape. We'll dance, we'll blow them all away. We'll blow them all away. Fight fires in your best clothes. Touch skin with your eyes closed. Chase thunder with the volume down. Pack a suitcase one into the next town. Force quit on your losing streak. Solve a riddle in the magazine, be tongue in cheek. Tell me that we're still too young. That we're still too young and. I'll hold my tongue. Between me leaving and the news. We'll dance alone between the trees. We go, the buildings turn to dust. Full of diamonds just for us. You are the shifter of my shape.

take me to church,"My lover's got humour. She's the giggle at a funeral. Knows everybody's disapproval. I should've worshipped her sooner. If the Heavens ever did speak. She is the last true mouthpiece. Every Sunday's getting more bleak. A fresh poison each week. We were born sick. you heard them say it. My church offers no absolutes. She tells me ""worship in the bedroom"". The only heaven I'll be sent to. Is when I'm alone with you. I was born sick, but I love it. Command me to be well. Amen. Amen. Amen. Take me to church. I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies. I'll tell you my sins. So you can sharpen your knife. Offer me that deathless death. Good God, let me give you my life. Take me to church. I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies. I'll tell you my sins. So you can sharpen your knife. Offer me that deathless death. Good God, let me give you my life. If I'm a pagan of the good times. My lover's the sunlight. To keep the Goddess on my side. She demands a sacrifice. To drain the whole sea get something shiny. Something meaty for the main course. That's a fine looking high horse. What you got in the stable?. We've a lot of starving faithful. That looks tasty. That looks plenty. This is hungry work. Take me to church. I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies. I'll tell you my sins. so you can sharpen your knife. Offer me my deathless death. Good God, let me give you my life. Take me to church. I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies. I'll tell you my sins. So you can sharpen your knife. Offer me my deathless death. Good God, let me give you my life. No masters or kings when the ritual begins. There is no sweeter innocence. Than our gentle sin. In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene. Only then I am human, only then I am clean. Amen. Amen. Amen. Take me to church. I'll worship like a dog. At the shrine of your lies. I'll tell you my sins. So you can sharpen your knife. Offer me that deathless death. Good God, let me give you my life. Take me to church. I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies. I'll tell you my sins. So you can sharpen your knife. Offer me that deathless death.

tessellate,"Bite chunks out of me. You're a shark and I'm swimming. My heart still thumps as I bleed. And all your friends come sniffing. Triangles are my favorite shape. Three points where two lines meet. Toe to toe, back to back, let's go, my love; it's very late. 'Til morning comes, let's tessellate. Go alone my flower. And keep my whole lovely you. Wild green stones alone my lover. And keep us on my heart. Three guns and one goes off. One's empty, one's not quick enough. One burn, one red, one grin. Search the graves while the camera spins. Chunks of you will sink down to seals. Blubber rich in mourning, they'll nosh you up. Yes, they'll nosh the love away but it's fair to say. You will still haunt me. Triangles are my favorite shape. Three points where two lines meet. Toe to toe, back to back, let's go my love; it's very late. 'Til morning comes. Wild green stones alone my lover. And keep us on my heart"
the end,We've only ever kissed lying down. We've only ever touched. When there's no one else around. I can be elusive if you want me to. I'm not being intrusive. I just wish I knew the truth. As to why. I wait for you. Longer than the average person would. And why. I think about you. More than I think one should. Our body's fit together like a makeshift puzzle. And it's clear to see why you puzzle me. When you turn your frame. And you whisper my name. As though I am a burden. And I know. And I know. This will happen again and again. So don't let us pretend that this is the end. This is the end. This is the end. I am at your house. So I belong to you for now. Trying to impress you. But lord I don't know how. I can be a statue if you want me to. I'm not being difficult I just need to know the truth. As to why. I'm wanting you. And I would take you away if I could. And why I'm still here. It's something I still haven't understood. Our hands press together like pieces of paper. But they're always blank when I hold your hand. And it gave you a fright. When I stayed the night. Cus you gave yourself to me. And I'm making up for last time. And I'm making up for you. And I'm waking up from last night. And I'm waking up with you. So what's new. So what's new. So what's new.

We're interrupted. By the heat of the sun. Trying to prevent. What's already begun. You're just a body. I can smell your skin. And when I feel it. You're wearing thin. But I've got a plan. Why don't you be the artist. And make me out of clay?. Why don't you be the writer. And decide the words I say?. Cause I'd rather pretend. I'll still be there at the end. Only it's too hard to ask. Won't you try to help me?. Sat on your sofa. It's all broken springs. This isn't the place for. Those violin strings. I try out a smile. And I aim it at you. You must have missed it. You always do.

this love (will be your downfall),"Who are we to be emotional?. Who are we to play with hearts and throw away it all?. Oh, who are we to turn each other's heads?. Who are we to find ourselves in other people's beds?. Oh, I don't like the way I never listen to myself. I feel like I'm on fire, I'm too shy to cry for help.

Who am I to choose the boy that everyone adores?. Oh, I don't see a reason why we can't just be apart. Now we're falling on each other like we're always in the dark. Oh, I don't think you know me much at all. This love is be and end all. This love will be your downfall. This love is be and end all. This love will be your downfall. This love is be and end all.

too much love,"Where's that diamond ring you promised?. My fingers looking bare. Where's that valentine, be honest,. The postman didn't bring it here. The thing I wasn't looking for. I found in your bedroom drawer. The letter that you loved her better,. Made me want you even, more. And too much love's not good for you. Your heart can get too full. And too much love's an IOU. And if I give you that, you'll. Send me the blues.. Ooohhhh, yeah. Where is all that time you promised?. The first hand's on the three. Where's the second hand, I'm bothered. To see it stroking on her knee. The thing I wasn't looking for. I found in your bedroom drawer. The letter that you loved her better,. Made me want you even, more. Chorus"
two years ago,"[Verse 1]. Reaching higher than towers. Wasn't anywhere we couldn't went. We had unbreakable powers. When our bodies meet, it's everything. This is was a beautiful vision. Even love was not a way you could describe it. And then there comes a collision. Nothing ever goes in the night. [Pre-Chorus 1]. And they're not lost forever. Lost what once was here. It's now just spots. Now the fireworks are fading. Is it over?. Lost you in the summer two years ago. [Chorus]. You, you, you. I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you. Two years ago. You, you, you. I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you. Two years ago. [Verse 2]. If there's no storm, why're we a shipwreck?. Thought our love is insurmountable. He knows my heart is still aching. Never thought it would be caused by you. [Pre-Chorus 2]. We're not lost forever. Lost what once was here. It's now just spots. Now the fireworks are fading. Is it over?. Lost you in the summer two years ago. [Chorus]. You, you, you. I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you. Two years ago. You, you, you. I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you. Two years ago. [Post-Chorus]. I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on. Two years ago. There's a part of me that still believes that we belong. Two years ago. I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on. Moving on, moving on, moving on. [Bridge]. And the reason I can't forget is I think you do too. I know you think of me, too. I'll use this moment to really forget. I will soon, but for now. I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you. I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you. I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you. I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you. [Chorus 2]. Two years ago. About you, about you. I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you. Two years ago. About you, about you. I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you. Two years ago. [Post-Chorus]. I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on. Two years ago. There's a part of me that still believes that we belong. Two years ago. I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on. Moving on, moving on, moving on. Two years ago. [Outro]. I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on. There's a part of me that still believes that we belong.

under control,I'll never forget that feeling. When I watched you disappear. And you made me stop believing. I could fight away the fear. Now the smoke has cleared. And the end is near. It was my illusion. Like a broken dream I was incomplete. But your love was never the missing piece. I feel like I am dreaming again. I feel like I am seeing again. I feel like I am breathing again. I got it under control. I got it under control. I got it under control. All that's real is faded. Like a car into the night. Like painkiller I take it. And I watch the world ignite. Now the smoke has cleared. And the end is near. It was my illusion. Like a broken dream I was incomplete. But your love was never the missing piece. I feel like I am dreaming again.

vincent,"Starry, starry night. Paint your palette blue and grey. Look out on a summer's day. With eyes that know the darkness in my soul. Shadows on the hills. Sketch the trees and the daffodils. Catch the breeze and the winter chills. In colors on the snowy linen land. Now I understand. What you tried to say to me. And how you suffered for your sanity. And how you tried to set them free. They would not listen, they did not know how. Perhaps they'll listen now. Starry, starry night. Flaming flowers that brightly blaze. Swirling clouds in a violet haze. Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue. Colors changing hue. Morning fields of amber grain. Weathered faces lined in pain. Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand. Now I understand. What you tried to say to me. And how you suffered for your sanity. And how you tried to set them free. They would not listen, they did not know how. Perhaps they'll listen now. For they could not love you. But still your love was true. And when no hope was left in sight. On that starry, starry night. You took your life, as lovers often do. But I could've told you, Vincent. This world was never meant. for one as beautiful as you. Starry, starry night. Portraits hung in empty halls. Frameless heads on nameless walls. With eyes that watch the world. and can't forget. Like the strangers that you've met. The ragged men in ragged clothes. The silver thorn on the bloody rose. Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow. Now I think I know. What you tried to say to me. And how you suffered for your sanity. And how you tried to set them free. They would not listen, they're not listening still. Perhaps they never will"
we can't move to this,"Used to roll in perfect motion, easy. Lips like Tanqueray. Tropical sunrises, never sleeping. I don't know what changed. All I want to do is feel the rhythm of the night. You've been running from the dark. You can't look me in the eyes. Being called into the heat. Even if it's burning me. I just need to dance without you. We can't move to this. We can't even talk, boy. We don't even kiss. It never works. We can't move to this. We can't even talk, boy. We don't even kiss. You're not in love. We can't move to this. We can't even talk, boy. We don't even kiss. It never works. We can't move to this. We can't even talk, boy. We don't even kiss. Through the streets and all the places I've been. I can see we never had harmony. I won't go even though I'm alone and I know I want out. I go up without you bringing me down. Such a rush. So now I'm staying to dance on my own. On my own. And all I know is. We can't move to this. We can't even talk, boy. We don't even kiss. It never works. We can't move to this. We can't even talk, boy. We don't even kiss. You're not in love. We can't move to this. We can't even talk, boy.

when your feet don't touch the ground,"When did life become so complicated?. Years of too much thought and time I wasted. And in each line upon my face. Is proof I fought and lived another day. When did life become this place of madness?. Drifting on an empty sea of waves and sadness?. I make believe I'm in control. And dream it wasn't all my fault. When your feet don't touch the ground. When your voice won't make a sound. Here, it's safe, in this place. Up off the clouds. When your feet don't touch the earth. You can't feel the fates that hurt. And you're free, there's no need to come down. When your feet don't touch the ground. Everyday just feels a little longer. Why am I the only one not getting stronger?. Running around pretending life's a play. It doesn't make the darkness go away. I may be young but I can still remember. Feeling full of joy, crying tears of laughter. Now all my tears are all cried out. Make-believe, but count me out. Cause my feet are on the ground. And the inner voice I found. Tells the truth. ""There's no use if your head's in the clouds"". With my feet on solid earth. I can face the fates that hurt. And in time, I'll be fine. I'll come 'round. I was once like you. Life was a maze. I couldn't find my way out. But what I say is true. You will be amazed. Make-believe and you will find out that it's time. When your feet don't touch the ground. When your voice won't make a sound. Here, it's safe. In this place. Up off the clouds. When your feet don't touch the earth. You can't feel the fates that hurt. And you're free, there's no need, to come down. When your feet don't touch the ground"
winner,"Let's call it a day, babe. I think I know what you're trying to say. Honey, it's fair play. Why try to win when I know I've lost. We don't have to spell it.

Do what you have to. What a shame. What a loss. The winner takes. She takes it all. What a shame. What a loss. But I can see why, because she's beautiful. What a defeat. To say the least.

wish i stayed,"Why can't we speak another language, one we all agree on. When when men look outside, do they see houses. Instead of the fields they grew from. We are Constantly uprooted from them, making us tiresome and fearful. Can you get up right now, endeavor to freefall (Off). You can fall if you want to It's just a matter of how far. You've treasured our home town. But you've forgotten where you are. And it will stay with you until you're mind's been found. and it has been found wondering around. With that skipping rope, the trampoline. The crafty smoke that made us choke. But we didn't give up hope. It's just the simple ways, of getting paid. The carelessnes of running away. I wish I stayed. I wish I stayed. I wish I stayed. Patterns all aranged in my background. It's pillars and posts keeping this country on form. Letters were all sent with no addresses. So that people can't discover. Always undercover. Why do i always draw triangles. Instead of words this paper so deserves. You see. I don't own my clothes but i own my mind. And it's not what you've lost. But it's what you find.. I don't own my clothes but i own my mind. And it's not what you've lost. But it's what you find.. With that skipping rope, the trampoline. The crafty smoke that made us choke. But we didn't give up hope. It's just the simple ways, of getting paid. The carelessnes of running away. I wish I stayed. I wish I stayed. I wish I stayed. cos you can fall if you want to.

without your love,"Sooner or later I'll be heading home. Sooner or later I'll be on my own. June into summer, I'll wear out my shoes. June into summer, got nothing to lose. Without your love I'm getting somewhere. Without your love I'm getting somewhere. Without your love I'm getting somewhere. Without your love I'm getting somewhere. Without your love I'm getting somewhere. Without your love I'm getting somewhere. Without your love I'm getting somewhere. Without your love I'm getting somewhere. Without your love I'm getting somewhere. Move in the sun till I burn all my ties. Maybe they're scratching the watery eyes. I think I've been waiting for this all my life. Coldest dark kisses left frozen in time. Without your love I'm getting somewhere. Without your love I'm getting somewhere. Without your love I'm getting somewhere.

you & me,"We traced the outline over a summer cloud. Blow our wishes to it and waved goodbye for now. And then we wandered through the streets of London Town. You. You and me. You. You and me. Sometimes the distance has been hard to bear. I lay awake in hotels wishing you were there. I slowly drift off, trying to find your beating heart. You. You and me. You. You and me. We are the crosswords, since you're away. There will be sparks and splinters. Still are the crosswords, every day. But it doesn't really matter just as long as there is you and me. Ooh, ooh. Ooh ooh ooh. Ooh, ooh. Ooh ooh ooh. Ooh ooh ooh. You and me. You. You and me. It's take a risk some, everything we go. Buy ourselves a caravan, make it down to space. And every evening, we'll sit and count the stars"
you my everything,Could've given me something. You my everything. You left me kneeling. I'm just one of those people. You my everything. For what it's worth. For what it's worth. For what it's worth. You were my backbone when. My body ached with weariness. You were my hold down when. My heart was filled with loneliness. And just as the dark was rising. I heard you close the door again. And just as the light turned south. I knew who I'd dream of. Could've given me something. You my everything. You left me kneeling. I'm just one of those people. You my everything. You my everything. You my everything. You are my only hope. The truth the dare the consequence. I know you don't feel the same. You're sensible and it doesn't make sense. I know I'm gonna wait my heart out. You know I'm gonna try much harder. But it isn't the shit in my head. That's holding me under this time. Could've given me something. You my everything. You left me kneeling. I'm just one of those people. You my everything. You my everything. You my everything
your biggest mistake,"Take cover. Signs don't show. You drove me off the road. But you let go. Cos your hope is gone. And every question fades away. It's a shame you don't know what you're running from. Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off?. Would it take the end of time to hear you heart's. False start?. You know this is your biggest mistake. What a waste, what a waste, what a waste. And of all the things you never explained. You know this is your biggest mistake. You tread water. Fighting for the air in your lungs. Move, move closer. Maybe you can right all your wrongs. But you let go. Cos your hope is gone. And every answer fades away. It's a shame you don't know what you're running from. Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off?. Would it take the end of time to hear your heart's. False start?. You know this is your biggest mistake. What a waste, what a waste, what a waste. And of all the things you never explained. You know this is your biggest mistake. Wipe the mud stains from the face, stop the engine. Stop pretending. Wipe the mud spray from your face, stop the engine. Stop pretending that you're still breathing. It's a shame you don't know what you're running from. Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off?. Would it take the end of time to hear your heart's. False start?. You know this is your biggest mistake. What a waste, what a waste, what a waste. And of all the things you never explained. You know this is your biggest mistake. You know this is your biggest mistake. What a waste, what a waste, what a waste. And of all the things you never explained. You know this is your biggest mistake"
your song,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside. I'm not one of those who can easily hide. I don't have much money, but boy if I did. I'd buy a big house where we both could live. So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do. See I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue. Anyway the thing is what I really mean. Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen. And you can tell everybody this is your song. It may be quite simple, but now that it's done. I hope you don't mind. I hope you don't mind that I put down in words. How wonderful life is now you're in the world. If I was a sculptor, but then again no. Or a girl who makes potions in a traveling show. I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do. My gift is my song, and this one's for you. And you can tell everybody this is your song. It may be quite simple, but now that it's done. I hope you don't mind. I hope you don't mind that I put down in words. How wonderful life is now you're in the world"
