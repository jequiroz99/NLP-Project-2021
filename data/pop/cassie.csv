Beside me a seat a rose and my feet. (my adonis) he then proclaims his love to me. (with a promise) he says that he will never leave. Taste of a winters love from above. Nothings forbidden I love it here. Tasting a fruit so fulfilling. Shakespeare in love. Just moonlight and us. (moonlight and us). Shakespeare and love. (just shakespeare and love). Bliss at 1st glance. Feel the romance. Just shakespeare and love. Then we lay neath the stars in the forest. As a dew drop mist fell apon us. Making sweet love, making sweet love. Making sweet sweet love. Innocence with a hint of seduction. With out lips we connected a lust. As we both touched, as we both touched. Shakespeare and love. . Just moonlight and us.

what she don't know won't hurt her,"Hey, let's keep this between us,. Because what she don't know won't hurt her.. [Verse 1]. They know him, I know her, this makes it... better.. Forbidden pleasures, that's what keeps us together.. The creepin', the sneekin', the trips on the weekend,. Our favorite best position, cause somethings he'd be missing.. [Chorus]. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, can you keep it?. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, this little secret.. So when they see us together he says I'm just a friend.. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, can you keep it?. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, this little secret.. Only me and him know whats up, so we know we must pretend,. So if she comes up to you. Saying that she knows about what we do,. I would tell her;. What she don't know won't hurt her,. What she, what she don't know won't hurt her.. And if she goes through your phone. Give me a secret name so she never knows,. I'm like;. What she don't know won't hurt her,. What she, what she don't know won't hurt her.. [Verse 2]. There's no us, there's still her, i'm just a nasty rumour. Cause either truth hurts,. So we stay undercover. When i call i block my number, when he calls we play secret lovers,. If she thinks he's being faithfull. Who am i to burst her bubble ?. [Chorus]. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, can you keep it?. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, this little secret.. So when they see us together he says i'm just a friend.. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, can you keep it?. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, this little secret.. Only me and him know whats up, so we know we must pretend,. So if she comes up to you. Saying that she knows about what we do,. I would tell her;. What she don't know won't hurt her,. What she, what she don't know won't hurt her.. And if she goes through your phone. Give me a secret name so she never knows,. I'm like;. What she don't know won't hurt her,. What she, what she don't know won't hurt her.. [Bridge]. I won't tell nobody, he won't tell nobody, we won't tell nobody cause its a secret.. I won't tell nobody, he won't tell nobody, we won't tell nobody, ssshhh.. She don't wanna know what me and him do behind closed doors, ohhho.. And I sure don't want to be in her shoes, me hell no, ohho. [x2]. So if she comes up to you. Saying that she knows about what we do,. I would tell her;. What she don't know won't hurt her,. What she, what she don't know won't hurt her.. And if she goes through your phone,. Give me a secret name so she never knows,. I'm like;. What she don't know won't hurt her,. What she, what she don't know won't hurt her. [x2]. What she don't know won't hurt her,. What she, what she don't know won't hurt her.. What she, what she, what she don't know won't hurt her,. What she, what she don't know won't hurt her,. What she don't know won't hurt her,. What she, what she don't know won't hurt her,. What she, what she, what she don't know won't hurt her.. What she, what she don't know won't hurt her."
whatcha gonna do,I’m in love and I really don’t know where it came from. But it took over me. All I know is I really want to spend all my time with you. I never felt this way before in this life. So crazy. You finish my sentences. Oh baby. Can’t explain just what this is. When you do what you do. When you did what you did to me. All I wanna know is. [Chorus:]. Whatcha gonna do now. When you got me in bed. Baby don’t stop choking. Just tell me. Whatcha gonna do now. When you got me waiting. Anticipating. Just tell me whatcha gonna do. When you touch. That makes me say I can’t get enough. Of you all over me. And I don’t want you to be scared. To take me all the way there. I never felt this way before. So crazy. You finish my sentences. Oh baby. Can’t explain just what this is. When you do what you do. When you did what you did to me. Oh you got me. All I wanna know is. [Chorus x4]
