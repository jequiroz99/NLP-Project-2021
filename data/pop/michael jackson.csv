Take me to a place without no name. Take me to a place without no name. Take me to a place without no name. Take me to a place without no name. As she took me right through the fog.

Someone is taking a life (Hold on). Respect to believe in your dreams. So tell me where were you. When your children cried last night. Faces filled with madness. Miracles unheard of (Hold on). Faith is found in the winds. All we have to do is to reach for the truth, the truth. You can change the world (I can't do it by myself). You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help). You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign). If we all cry at the same time tonight. And when that flag glows there'll be no more wars. And when all cause I will answer all your prayers (Prayers). Show the world. You can change the world (I can't do it by myself). You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help).

invincible,"If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart. I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start. But girl you just won't approve of the things that I do. When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool. If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me. And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me. And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me. And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me. Chorus:. So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible. But I can do anything, she's invincible. Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible. Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible. Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do. But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to. So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me. When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream.

And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me. Chorus. Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do. Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy. Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in in time. Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed to do for you my baby. RAP. (Fats, M.J., Darkchild, listen). Yo, mummy stop the refrain, I'm real with mine. All the things that I promise, I'll fulfill in time. The chains and the bracelet got the realest shine (bling).

is it scary,"There's a ghost down in the hall. There's a ghoul beneath the bed. Now it's coming through the walls. Now it's climbing up the stairs. There's a spirit in the dark.

it's the falling in love (feat. patti austin),"(1st Verse). You're not like anybody I ever knew. But that don't mean that I don't know where we are. And though I find myself attracted to you. This time I'm trying not to go too far, cause. Bridge. No matter how it starts it ends the same. Someone's always doing someone more. Trading in the passion for that taste of pain. It's only gonna happen again. (Chorus). It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high. It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry. It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high. It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry. All night... all night. (2nd Verse) (Patti Austin). And though I'm trying not to look in your eyes. Each time I do they kind of burn right through me. Don't want to lay down in a bed full of lies. And yet my heart is saying come and do me. (Bridge). Now we're just a web of mystery. A possibility of more to come. I'd rather leave the fantasy of what might be. But here I go falling again. (Chorus). It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high. It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry. It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high. It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry. It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high.

little susie,"Somebody killed Little Susie. The girl with the tune. Who sings in the daytime at noon. She was there screaming. Beating her voice in her doom. But nobody came to her soon. A fall down the stairs. Her dress torn. Oh, the blood in her hair. A mystery so sullen in air. She lie there so tenderly. Fashioned so slenderly. Lift her with care. Oh, the blood in her hair. Everyone came to see. The girl that now is dead. So blind stare the eyes in her head. And suddenly a voice from the crowd said. This girl lived in vain. Her face bear such agony, such strain. But only the man from next door. Knew Little Susie, now he cried. As he reached down. To close Susie's eyes. She lie there so tenderly. Fashioned so slenderly. Lift her with care. Oh, the blood in her hair. It was all for God’s sake. For her singing the tune. For someone to feel her dispair. To be damned to know hoping is dead. And you’re doomed. Then to scream out. And nobody’s there. She knew no one cared. Father left home. Poor mother died. Leaving Susie alone. Grandfather’s soul too had flown. No one to care. Just to love her. How much can one bear. Neglecting the needs in her prayers. Neglection can kill. Like a knife in your soul. Oh, it will. Little Susie fought so hard to live. She lie there so tenderly. Fashioned so slenderly. Lift her with care. So young and so fair"

love's gone bad,"Ah I feel a fountain in my brain. Ice-cold water runnin' through my pain. Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears. Heart so sad 'cause love's gone bad.

Without your love I can't go on. Look in the mirror, what do I see?. A cryin' face, kinda looks like me. Now where's the love you promised me?. Where's he tenderness to comfort me?. Everytime some love I choose. I seem to always be the one to lose. Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears. Heart fells sad 'cause love's gone bad. Love's gone bad, heart fells bad. Black crows flying up above. It's a sign that I live life without love. Slime's on the man, slime's ont the sea. Slime's everywhere I said I'm destined to be. And this world where nothing's right. Since you've been gone I can't sleep at night. You said you'd be true to me. Instead you made a fool out of me. Heart feels sad, love's gone bad."

much too soon,First rule on this world baby.... don't pay attention to anything you see on the news.. She was there just sitting on the table. Thinking now that things won't be the same. And would you like to go with me?. And she answered no to me. But I guess I'll learn my lesson much too soon. I never thought she'd leave me forever. But who knows just what the future brings?. And would she like to go with me. And she aswered no to me. But I guess I'll learn my lesson much too soon. Take away this never ending sorrow. Take this lonely feeling from my soul. If only I knew what things bring tomorrow. She'd be sitting here beside me. And my heart wouldn't go. Just.... I hope to make a change now for the better. Never letting fate control my soul. And hoping that my prayers will see. The day that you'll come back to me. But I guess I'll learn my lesson much too soon. Yes I guess I'll learn my lesson much too soon

planet earth (poem),"Planet Earth, my home, my place. A capricious anomaly in the sea of space. Planet Earth are you just. Floating by, a cloud of dust. A minor globe, about to bust. A piece of metal bound to rust. A speck of matter in a mindless void. A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid. Cold as a rock without a hue. Held together with a bit of glue. Something tells me this isn't true. You are my sweetheart soft and blue. Do you care, have you a part. In the deepest emotions of my own heart. Tender with breezes caressing and whole. Alive with music, haunting my soul.. In my veins I've felt the mystery. Of corridors of time, books of history. Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood. Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood. Your misty clouds, your electric storm. Were turbulent tempests in my own form. I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet. Of every encounter, of passion, of heat. Your riotous color, your fragrance, your taste. Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste. In your beauty, I've known the how. Of timeless bliss, this moment of now. Planet Earth are you just. Floating by, a cloud of dust. A minor globe, about to bust. A piece of metal bound to rust. A speck of matter in a mindless void. A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid. Cold as a rock without a hue. Held together with a bit of glue. Something tells me this isn't true. You are my sweetheart gentle and blue. Do you care, have you a part. In the deepest emotions of my own heart. Tender with breezes caressing and whole. Alive with music, haunting my soul.. Planet Earth, gentle and blue. With all my heart, I love you"

scared of the moon,Alone she lies waiting. Surrounded by gloom. Invaded by shadows. Painting the room. The light from the window. Cuts through the air. And pins the child lying there. Scared of the moon. She pulls up the covers. And shivers in fright. She hides from the colour. That writes on the light. The light through the window. That lights up the sky. And causes her moanful cry. Scared of the moon. There's nothing wrong. Don't be bothered they said. It's just childish fantasies. Turning your head. No need to worry. It's really too soon. But there she lies shivering. Scared of the moon. Scared of the moon. Scared of the moon. Scared of the moon. Scared of the moon. The years go by swiftly. And soon childhood ends. But life is there fearful. When evening descends. The fear of the child. Still intrude the night. Returning on beams of light. Scared of the moon. The feeling of terror. She felt as a youth. Has turned from a fantasy. Into a truth. The moon is the enemy. Twisting her soul. And taking its fearful tone. Scared of the moon. But now there are others. That sit here alone. And wait for the sunlight. To brighten their gloom. Together they gather. The loners see shade. But knowing just why they're scared. Scared of the moon

So I've learned that loves not possession. And I've learned that love won't wait. Now I've learned that love needs expression. But I've learned too late. She's out of my life. She's out of my life. Damned indecision and cursed pride. Kept my love for her locked deep inside. And it cuts like a knife. She's out of my life

Is increasing the height of your spirituality. Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions. Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how. we're living. The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no. warning. But we live to see the dawn. How can we preach, when all we make this world. to be. Is a living hell torturing our minds. We all must unite, to turn darkness to light. And the love in our hearts will shine. We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting. each other. Whatever happened to protecting each other. Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure. But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever. Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted. Family values are contradicted. Ashes to ashes and dust to dust. The pressure is building and I've had enough. I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout. What's this madness all about.

threatened,"Rod Serling Intro. Tonight's story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction. A monster had arrived in the village. The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown. And this person or thing is soon to be met. He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion. Oh yes, I did forget something didn't I?. I forgot to introduce you to the monster.. You're fearing me, 'cause you know I'm a beast. Watching you when you sleep, when you're in bed I'm underneath. You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls. I'm the floor when you fall, and when you scream it's 'cause of me. I'm the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head. I know just what you said. That's why you've got to be threatened by me. Chorus:. You should be watching me, you should feel threatened. Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened. Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened. Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me. You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt. I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you. Your worst nightmare, it's me I'm everywhere. In one blink I'll disappear, and then I'll come back to haunt you. I'm telling you, when you lie under tomb I'm the one watching you. That's why you got to be threatened by me. Chorus. Rod Serling Verse. The unknown monster is about to embark. From a far corner, out of the dark. A nightmare, that's the case. Never Neverland, that's the place. This particular monster can read minds. Be in two places at the same time. This is judgment night, execution, slaughter. The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture. You can be sure of one thing, that's fate. A human presence that you feel is strange. A monster that you can see disappear. A monster, the worst thing to fear.. Chorus x 3. Rod Serling Outro. What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly. terrifying nightmare. It isn't. It's the beginning."

But terror takes the sound before you make it. You start to freeze. As horror looks you right between the eyes. You're paralyzed. 'Cause this is thriller. Thriller night. And no one's gonna save you. From the beast about to strike. You know it's thriller. Thriller night. You're fighting for your life. Inside a killer. Thriller. I'm gonna thrill you tonight. [Rap]. Darkness falls across the land. The midnight hour is close at hand. Creatures crawl in search of blood. To terrorize y'all's neighborhood. And whosoever shall be found. Without the soul for getting down. Must stand and face the hounds of hell. And rot inside a corpse's shell. I'm gonna thrill you tonight. (Thriller, thriller). I'm gonna thrill you tonight. (Thriller night, thriller). [Rap].

Your body starts to shiver. for no mere mortal can resist. the evil of the thriller. 'Cause this is thriller. Thriller night. There ain't no second chance.

to make my father proud,"To make my father proud. To make my mother smile. I need no conquered worlds or fame. Nor set the pace for style. If I can follow through. On what they gave me as my tools. I'll find the way to sail my course. Avoiding ships of fools. If I don't come up, number one. I'll stand not well apart. As one for numbered numbers. When knowing in my heart. I've done all to be done. To always do my best. By listening to me, myself. So he can do or else. (For without compromise,. Shall flower the fruit of constant care). In my eleventh hour. I'll be a man when. To face whatever falls my way. Prepare that utter shame. To just be called a part of God. For which I have been named. A man and a woman's youngest son. While growing still a child. And that will make my father proud. And make my mother smile.... (Proud)"
too young,They try to tell us we're too young. Too young to really be in love. They say that love's a word. A word we've only heard. But can't begin to know the meaning of. And yet we're not too young to know. This love will last though years may go. And then someday they may recall. We were not to young at fall
torture,"It was on a street so evil. So bad that even hell disowned it. Every single step was trouble. For the fool who stumbled on it. Eyes within the dark were watchin'. I felt the sudden chill of danger. Something told me keep on walkin'. Told me I should not have gone there. Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife (ooh). Without your love in my life. Alone I walk in the night. 'Cause I just can't stop this feeling. It's torture. It's torture. It's torture (ooh). She was up a stair to nowhere. A room forever I'll remember. She stared as though I should have known her. Tell me what's your pain or pleasure. Every little thing you find here. Is simply for the thrill you're after. Loneliness or hearts on fire. I am here to serve all masters. She said, 'Reality is a knife. When there's no love in your life. Unmerciful is the night. When you just can't stop this feeling'. It's torture. It's torture. It's torture. And I still can't find the meaning, no. No, no, of the face I keep on seeing. Was she real or am I dreaming. Did the sound of your name. Turn a wheel. Start a flame in me (ooh). Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife. Without your love in my life. Alone I walk in the night. And I just can't stop this feeling. It's torture. It's torture. It's torture"
unbreakable (feat. the notorious b.i.g),"Now I'm just wondering why you think. That you can get to me with anything. Seems like you'd know by now, when and how I get down.

And there's no way you'll ever get to me. Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me. 'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby. Chorus (2x).

But after it all. He brushed himself off. Knowing how much you loved me. I made one more try. I reached for the sky. And I made it this time. (Chorus). I'm up again I never let you down. Nothing's ever gonna stop me now. Up again I never let you down. I love you

we've had enough,"Love was taken from a young life. And no one told her why. Her direction has a dimlight. From one more violent crime. She innocently questioned why. Why her father had to die. She asked the men in blue. How is it that you get to choose. Who will live and who will die. Did god say that you could decide ?. You saw he didn't run. And that my daddy had no gun. In the middle of a village. Way in a distant land. Lies a poor boy with his broken toy. Too young to understand. He's awaken, ground is shakin. His father grabs his hand. Screaming, crying, his wife's dying. Now he's left to explain. He innocently questioned why. Why his mother had to die. What did these soldiers come here for ?. If they're for peace, why is there war ?. Did God say that they could decide. Who will live and who will die ?. All my mama ever did. Was try to take care of her kids. We're innocently standing by. Watching people lose their lives. It seems as if we have no voice. It's time for us to make a choice. Only god could decide. Who will live and who will die. There's nothing that can't be done.

You say you love me and let's start anew. You break my heart,. Then you say we're through. No more believin'. In every word you say. Persuasions deceiving. But I'm wise in every way. And I know 'bout your playin'. With every guy in town. So this time I'm sayin'. You won't fool me around. Then you get me walkin' my way back to you. You say you love me then leave me blue. You break my heart,. Then you say that we're through.. But it's O.K.. You're no good. I don't understand your ways. One more fool just to love and groove ya. That's all that he want to do to ya"
