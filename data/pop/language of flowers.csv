if it's not you,I see you standing over there. Why won't you come on over. The way things work seems so unfair. I'm drunk but you're still sober. I wasted time on silly things. I've never felt my own way. I used to dream of wedding rings. I never felt my own so. But if I can't have you. I know what to do. I know where to go. To get over you. If it's not you (x4). I've seen you holding hands with her. You told me it was over. I thought that you were just good friends. I've seen the way you hold her. Don't waste your time. She's not your type. I need to get my say in. She's been with all the boys I know. I know the games she's playing. But if I can't have you. I know what to do. I know where to go. To get over you. If it's not you (x4). I've heard it all a million times please take me back I miss you. Still you don't seem to understand I've lost the will to kiss you. But still you'll take me in your arms. Send shivers down my spine. She's not afraid that nothings changed. She's not your ideal love now. But if I can't have you. I know what to do. I know where to go. To get over you. If it's not you (x4)
"me, sola & c","Well, I had wondered for a while. If love was genuine. I heard a conversation. in the ladies room. We both conspired a simple plan. to test your innocence. Collate the evidence. I'll tie this crime on you. She said ""Follow. him wherever he goes"". But you never. left my side at all, so . .. Not satisfied with what I'd found. I hatched another egg. She would rub your leg. If ever I left the room. But no you didn't even flinch. Not a dicky bird. She whispered dirty words. ""I can love you better than her"". She said ""Maybe,. he is not a real man!"". I'm not so sure. You don't even like Wham!. I got near the scene but fell in between. It must have been good when I was sixteen.. Just looked out of place, You'd taken my keys. Now it's just us three; me, Sola & C.. She said ""You're not. welcome anymore, C.. Don't come round here. You might wake the baby."""

will we ever end up together?,I dreamt of you last night. But you're never there. When I turn on the light. I hope you're alright. It's been nearly two months. Since you left my life. And I wonder will we ever. End up together?. I wonder about you. I'm starting to miss you. It's been a long time. I'm longing to kiss you. Have I left it too late?. Boy that I dream of. You're so worth the wait. And I wonder will we ever. End up together?. I wonder about you. I dreamt of you last night. But you're never there. When I turn on the light. I hope you're alright. It's been nearly three months. Since you wrecked my life
