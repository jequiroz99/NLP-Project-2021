remember (part. dani furst),"Hey stranger. I wonder where you are today. I was always handing out smiles. Today I just wonder where you are. I want to ask him why he disappeared from my life. And if you still remember that time. When everything was simpler and happy. Before I pulled you and stayed here alone. Will you remember, even after all this time. Will you remember my name and will you Care?. You will remember. He said he would call him. But I never had the courage. I know things could never be. As in those days gone by. But I still think about you all the time. These rainy days cut my urge to smile. You simply disappeared. and I do not know how to ask you to come back. all I want to know is. Will you remember, even after all this time. Will you remember my name and will you. Care about me like you did?. You'll remember. And I would never take away from you. all I want to know is. Will you remember. Because I remember. and I can no longer refer to you as a stranger. My Lord!"
without you (part. guilherme de sá),"All my life, all my history. Just made sense when I met you. Your eyes, your face. Just take me beyond what I thought. If I sometimes hide on you I find myself. I can't even pretend. I need to say: I miss you. There's no way to explain. It was without you that I understood. That is not easy to live without you. My broken heart says that I can not. I can not live never more without you. Without you. All my life, all my history. Just made some sense when I met you. Your eyes, oh, your holy face. Just take me beyond what I thought. If I sometimes hide on you I find myself. I can't even pretend. I need to say: I miss you. There's no way to explain. It was without you that I understood. That is not easy to live without you. My broken heart says that I can not. I can not live never more without you. Without you. Never without you. Without you. Without you. I am nothing without you. Without you. *Versão em inglês do clássico da. Banda Rosa de Saron - Sem você"
your name is jesus (part. mabel lacerda),"I discovered. the secret of love. The reason, reason for living. I found the way. I found the code. Your name is Jesus. Name above all names. His names is life. Forever and ever. He was crucified for me. So I'm grateful for your love. I celebrate you. Thank you Lord!"
