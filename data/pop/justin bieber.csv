hard 2 face reality (feat. poo bear),"Sometimes it's hard to face reality. Oh oh. Even though you might get mad at me. Oh oh. Sometimes it's hard to face reality. Should've been adjusted to my life. Had the oppurtunity to stay away from the last time. Now you're standing right in front of me. It hurts me to know that I lied. Trying to protect your feelings. You've been in between the lines. Hope your heart is still in healing. Sometimes it's hard to face reality. Oh oh. Even though you might get mad at me. Oh oh. Sometimes it's hard to face reality. Don't be afraid to stand alone. Don't be afraid to stand outside the comfort zone. I know it's hard away from home. And it ain't easy all alone. Relationships over the phone. Talkin' to your significant other all night long. Sometimes it's hard to face reality. Oh oh. Even though you might get mad at me. Oh oh. Sometimes it's hard to face reality. Love and death are quite similar. How they come ando go like cat burglars. Reality is kind hard to face. Like actual facts is for flat-earthers. Rain's a requirement for flowers to grow. And pain's a requirement for power to grow. It's a miracle how one can change. From one what was just hours ago. Such is life though, it's just a cycle. The bigger picture and the smaller picture. It's exactly the same, it's macro, micro. Crack your atom and let your light glow. One Day you can be the king of pop and the next one just be wack old Michael. It's human nature, just like he told us. Let's face reality, crack the cycle. Know it hurts to see the truth in your face. Circumstances bring u down to your knees. Go on and cry an ocean, but don't drown in it. Enough to put your heart at ease. Oh don't lose your self esteem. I apologise, for being a man. It's way harder than what it seems. Sometimes it's hard to face reality. Oh oh. Even though you might get mad at me. Oh oh. Sometimes it's hard to face reality. Sometimes it's hard to face reality. Oh Oh"

the christmas song (chestnuts roasting on an open fire) (feat. usher),"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire. Jack Frost nipping at your nose. Yuletide carols being sung by a choir. And folks dressed up like eskimos. Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe. Help to make the season bright. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow. Will find it hard to sleep tonight. They know that santa's on his way. He's loaded lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh. And every mother's child is gonna spy. To see if reindeer really know how to fly. And so, I'm offering this simple phrase. To kids from one to ninety-two. Although it's been said many times, many ways. Merry Christmas to you. And so, I'm offering this simple phrase.
