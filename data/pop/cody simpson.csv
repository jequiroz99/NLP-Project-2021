Nah brutha it's nothing. I'm not buggin. I wake up in the morning and enjoy an English muffin. Little fried egg with a side of turkey bake. And I'm dancing round the kitchen listenin to T-Pain. I understand things won't always go my way. Instead of tryin' to force it I just try to ride the wave. Go in, around, and up, and down, and never look away. Stay focused on that level ground. And things will turn out straight. Yeah my intuition's fabulous. Instincts are simply great. And my homies keep me grounded. Never worried bout the hate. If you hear them talkin bad, then this is what you do. Look em in the face and tell em I'll be cool. Tell em Cody, brah. Na na na Imma be. Na na na Imma be. Na na na Imma be cool. Oh Imma be alright. Na na na Imma be. Na na na na Imma be. Na na na Imma be cool. Don't worry bout me. Ooh ooh oh. x3"

waiting for the tide (with the tide),"Everybody's waiting. For the moment to arrive. I will clear my vision. See the water on the rise. Though with this beginning. Will we make it out alive?. Feet are stuck in quicksand. And we're running out of time. I'm just out here waiting for the tide. Come on. Come on. I say, point your guns at people. Pointing there's down at the ground. There's no revelation. Without the silence of the sound. All your meditations. Like a diver heading down. Down into the kingdom. Where nobody wears the crown. Can't you see the water's on the rise. I'm just out here waiting for the tide. Come on. Come on. I'm just out here. now they're waiting for the tide. I'm just out here. now they're waiting for the tide.

wanted dead or alive,"It's all the same. Only the names will change. Everyday it seems we're wasting away. Another place where the faces are so cold. I'd drive all night just to get back home. 'Cause I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I'm wanted dead or alive. Wanted dead or alive. Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days. And people I meet always go their separate ways. Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink. And sometimes when you're all alone all you do is think. 'Cause I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive. Wanted (wanted) dead or alive. I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive. And I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back.

I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive. 'Cause I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side. I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive. And I ride, dead or alive. I still drive, dead or alive. Dead or alive.

waves,"My face above the water. My feet can't touch the ground. Touch the ground, and it feels like. I can see the sands on the horizon. Everytime you are not around.

Pulling against the stream. I wish I could make it easy. Easy to love me, love me. But still I reach, to find a way. I'm stuck here in between. I'm looking for the right words to say.

wilderness,"Have you been dreaming of the wilderness. Have you been wondering how far it is we will go. Just to show that we're the mightiest. On the globe, as it rolls into oblivion. Have you been thinking bout the ocean too. There's heartless hands letting the oil through. Till the blue isn't blue will you take a stand. To the man with a plan to wash away the truth. Are you unconscious in your troubled mind. Don't forget mountains were made to climb. To the sky, that's where you'll find crystal clementine. Looking down with a sigh, as she begins to cry. And then it rains upon the trees with their roots still in the ground. Let the water trickle down into the thirsty river mouth. The sun will shine on through every shadow of a doubt. Save us from this endless drought"
