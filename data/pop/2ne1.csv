It’s okay baby please don’t cry,. This long journey is about to end.. But someday, we will meet again,. In the next life, we will see each other again. Verse Two:.

Can you please take away all the promises you made?. Even the petty habits, even the small memories. I'll burning them all away. I'm putting you, who lives in me, to sleep. The image of me you knew up till now won't exist anymore. In the club, tonight, for him. In the club, I'll give him my everything. In the club, just like the way you were with that girl. I'll love easily. In the club tonight, for him. In the club, I'll give him my everything. In the club, please embrace my painful scars too. So that only for tonight, I'd be able to forget you. When this night completely ends. Seems like I'll be left alone in my room. Seems like I'll be crying like a fool. I still see you in my dreams. Now I'll let you go. You shouldn't look for me again either. In the club, tonight, for him. In the club, I'll give him my everything. In the club, just like the way you were with that girl. I'll love easily. In the club tonight, for him. In the club, I'll give him my everything. In the club, please embrace my painful scars too. So that only for tonight, I'd be able to forget you"

We truly loved each other, can't turn back?. [Dara]. I'm the only one hurting tonight. [Bom]. Have you changed?. Am I no longer in your heart now?. When I, I think about you. It hurts, hurts, hurts so much. [Minzy]. You look at my tears as if it were nothing. You continue to talk calmly again. [CL]. You told me cruely that you couldn't deny. That you had absolutely no attachments or regrets. [Bom]. Are we already too late? Is our love over?. Even if it's a lie, please tell me it isn't so. I can do better now, though we can't meet again. [Dara]. I'm the only one in pain tonight. [CL]. Have you changed?. Am I no longer in your heart now?. When I, I think about you. It hurts, hurts, hurts so much. [Minzy]. You're no longer your old self. [CL]. Because the you I loved. And the you now are so different. [Dara]. Are you that shocked?. I just stood and cried. Watching you become further away. [Bom]. No way, I can't recognize. You're not mine anymore. [Dara]. Did you have to change?. Can't you come back?. Did you really have to change?. Can't you come back?. Did you have to change?. Can't you come back?. Why did you have to change?. Can't you keep loving me?. [Bom]. Oh, is this the end?. Am I no longer in your heart now?. When I, I think about you. [Minzy]. It hurts, hurts, hurts so much. [Minzy]. It hurts, it hurts. [CL]. It hurts, it hurts"
