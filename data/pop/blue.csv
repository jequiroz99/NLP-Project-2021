I can't go back, Don't you know you hooked me up like that,. It'll hit me a heart attack, if you ever should leave.. Spending most my nights, lost inside your eyes,.

king of the world,"Take me back to the time. We would talk all night. Those healing words I've never heard. Put my world to right. She told me you don't see what I can see. This life is full of possibility. She gave me more than gold, gave me all I need. Without her I'm a poor man. I'd be the king of the world. If you were by my side. 'Cause when you gave me your love. I was the richest man alive. Now I'm broken, hopin' you'll come back in my life. I'd be the king of the world. If you were here tonight!. Remember when way back then we'd lie there in the dark. My best friend, we said we'd never end. As we looked up to the stars. She showed me how to be all that I could be. Broke into my heart and set me free. She gave me a reason to believe. Without her I'm a poor man!. I'd be the king of the world. If you were by my side. 'Cause when you gave me your love. I was the richest man alive. Now I'm broken, hopin' you'll come back in my life. I'd be the king of the world. If you were here tonight!. Ooh oh. Ooh oh. Come back in my life. Ooh oh. Ooh oh. I need you here tonight. Without her I'm a poor man!. I'd be the king of the world. If you were by my side. 'Cause when you gave me your love. I was the richest man alive. Now I'm broken, hopin' you'll come back in my life. I'd be the king of the world. If you were here tonight!.

And I know every secret,. about you.. I believe my heart,. It believes in you,. It's telling me that what I see,. is completely true.. I believe my heart,. How can it be wrong. It says that what I feel for you. I will feel my whole life long.. I believe my heart.. It believes in you.. It's telling me that what I see is completely true.. And with all my soul. I believe my heart.. The portrait that it paints of you. is a perfect work,. of art."

black box,Sending out a mayday. We're going down. The thing we could have done. Would have turned it round. Everything we had scattered everywhere. Searching through the wreckage of a love affair. Got something to say?. Say it to me. Not everyone else. You say that I'm to blame. My words are in vain. Don't go fooling yourself. There's a little black box here. Somewhere in the ocean. Holding all the truth about us. There's a little black box. A record of emotion. Everything that ever was. You may deny it. But when I find it. I'm gonna play it aloud to the world. There's a little black box. There's a little black box. Living under pressure when you get deep. You left me on my own at six hundred feet. I was looking round for a little help. But everyone was looking out for themselves. Got something to say?. Say it to me. Not everyone else. You say that I'm to blame. My words are in vain. Don't go fooling yourself. There's a little black box here. Somewhere in the ocean. Holding all the truth about us. There's a little black box. A record of emotion. Everything that ever was. You may deny it. But when I find it. I'm gonna play it aloud to the world. There's a little black box. There's a little black box. You can't stop a true survivor. You'll discover that on your own. Cause I'm a true survivor. And I'll be there after you're gone. Long after you're gone

curtain falls,Duncan. We come from humble beginnings and. Who could have guessed it when. You sit and doubt it and. Things aint all that bright. But we made it though the night. It´s like a game of truth or dare. If you can make it here. You´re make it anywhere. That´s what we´ve been told. But the stories getting old. Lee. Together we faced the cold outside. No one can say we didn´t try. And I will never give you up or let you go. Together we faced our final fears. Remember the moments that we shared. That´s why I'll never give you up or let you go. All. We´ll be ready when the curtain might fall. Feel my heart beating when the crowd calls. I gotta read between the lines. Cuz I'm living out the script of my life. Cuz we all got a part we must play. And I've done it but I've done it my way. I gotta read between the lines. Oohh (oohh). In the script of my life. Simon. We started out many years ago. No one will ever know. How far we´ve really come. Since we walked away. And no more words to say. Antony. And we made a lot of sacrifice. Undid a lot of ties. Fought a lot of fights. To get where we are now. Just don´t ask me how. Lee. Together we faced the cold outside. No one can say we didn´t try. And I will never give you up or let you go. Together we faced our final fears. Remember the moments that we shared. That´s why I're never give you up or let you go. All. We´re be ready when the curtain might fall. Feel my heart beating when the crowd calls.

guardian angel,"In your eyes I see you've been broken. And you shadow it hides from the sun. As a picture with words left unspoken. Are you wondering who you are. Do you ever think there's someone out there looking over you. Watching everything you do. Looking after you. Would you believe that I could be your guardian angel. Do you believe that this is true. If you say yes I'll fall and I will be able. to look at anyone so true I love you. your thoughts get lost in the ocean. And your prides as strong as the sea. Your heart is blocked by a raincloud. Only Thunder and Rain can be seen. Do you ever think there's someone out there looking over you. Watching everything you do. Looking after you. Would you believe that I could be your guardian angel. Do you believe that this is true. If you say yes I'll fall and I will be able. to look at anyone so true I love you. Say the words and I will be there. Hold my hand cause I am scared. You believe the world can be strange. Please take away my pain. Would you believe that I could be your guardian angel. Do you believe that this is true. If you say yes I'll fall and i will be able. to look at anyone so true I love you, you, you, you. Do you believe that this is true. If you say yes I'll fall and i will be able. to look at anyone so true I love you."

One love - gotta stay alive. I will survive. One love - for the city streets. One love - for the hip-hop beats. One love, Oh I do believe. One love is all we need. Late at night I'm still wide awake. Feel this is far more than I can take. I thought my heart could never break. Now I know that's one big mistake. [bridge]. [chorus]. Baby, just love me love me love me.

stand up as people,All I hear is voices in the crowd. Though they only whisper though they frown. People saying oh it's such a shame. Still they only look to pass the blame. . If we can find a way to work things out. The only way to start is to start now. . Chorus. When are we gonna stand up as people. Realise that as people we're all equal. We don't want no world war sequel. For the love of god think of the people. Children always learn by what they see. So we gotta practice what we preach. Don't you know if thats the game of life. We refuse when we chose to fight. . If we can find a way to work things out. The only way to start is to start now. . Chorus. When are we gonna stand up as people. Realise that as people we're all equal. We don't want no world war sequel. For the love of god think of the people. I pray before I sleep at night. That I wake to find a clear blue sky. . Chorus. When are we gonna stand up as people. Realise that as people we're all equal. We don't want no world war sequel. For the love of god think of the people. When are we gonna stand up as people. Realise that as people we're all equal. We don't want no world war sequel. For the love of god think of the people

the gift,"It's funny how it starts, just how it all begins.. You get your sights on dreams,and man a thousand different things.. You are on for yourself,you're chasing cool desire.. You get addicted fast, but man you're playin' with fire.. Then there's a day that comes to you.. When you get all you want, but there's a space inside that's still as empty as it was.. 'Till an angel comes your way and man she's fallin fast.. You know she's so in need but she is to afraid to ask.. So you hold on out your hands and catch her best you can.. And in givin' love you feel a better man.. *And the gift is what you get by givin' more than you receive.. And you're learnin' fast that maybe this is how you'll be happy.. 'Cause in takin' everything you lost, the air you need to breath.. But in givin' it away, you found the precious thing you seek.. Man, it's funny how she smiles, how grateful she is now.. And how that touches me deep in my heart somehow.. Yet the mirror laughs at me when I forget myself.. When I complain about, this hand that I got dealt.. And if I had know before, how much she would change my life.. I'd sure go back in time and tell that guy ...hey, man.. You can do better than this, you can answer your prayers.. You can grant your own wish.. Just hold on out your hands and give the most you can.. And I swear to you you'll feel a better man.. *Repeat. And it's better by far to do what you do now.. And leave the rest to love.. Just be strong in who you are.. Once you start on that road.. You're safe in the knowledge.. That anyway you go.. Will lead you home.. *Repeat. So precious precious precious.... *Repeat."

without you (2002),"I couldn't live without my cellphone,. I couldn't live without my 4 x 4,. I couldn't live without my credit card,. I couldn't live without you.. Funny how the little things, we can't do without,. Make you wonder somehow, how we did it before.. When I found love, never knew that I needed love,. Now I can't get enough of wanting it more and more.. And I spend most my days, finding different ways,. Thinking how to say, Just how much I love you.. I couldn't live without my cellphone,. I couldn't live without my 4 x 4,. I couldn't live without my credit card,. And I wonder what I did before.. Like your love, babe,. If you ever take it all away,. I wouldn't make it through another day,. I couldn't live without you.. No I can't conceive, going back to how it used to be,. You've affected my reality, and I need you like the air I breathe.. I can't go back, Don't you know you hooked me up like that,. It'll hit me a heart attack, if you ever should leave.. Spending most my nights, lost inside your eyes,. Wondering how can I ever live without you. Live without you beside my side.. I couldn't live without my cellphone,. I couldn't live without my 4 x 4,. I couldn't live without my credit card,. And I wonder what I did before.. Like your love, babe,. If you ever take it all away,. I wouldn't make it through another day,. I couldn't live without you.. I couldn't live without my cellphone,. I couldn't live without my 4 x 4,. I couldn't live without my credit card,. And I wonder what I did before.. Like your love, babe,. If you ever take it all away,. I wouldn't make it through another day,. I couldn't live without you.. The things we take in life for granted,. We foresake.. But I know, I can't do without the love we made,. I will never break the promises I make,. So hear me baby, when I say.. I couldn't live without my cellphone,. I couldn't live without my 4 x 4,. I couldn't live without my credit card,. But most of all I couldn't live without you.. I couldn't live without my cellphone,. I couldn't live without my 4 x 4,. I couldn't live without my credit card,. And I wonder what I did before.. Like your love, babe,. If you ever take it all away,. I wouldn't make it through another day.. I couldn't live without you.."
