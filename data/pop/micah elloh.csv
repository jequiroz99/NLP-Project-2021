give me more,I love to be with you. From the rising sun. Until the day is gone. Head over heels for you. I lost my rocker vibe. With you I can be shy. All my friends they tell me that. I got a glow they never had seen before. I'm blinding them. And when I think I need a break. I take a look at your face. I need some more. So give me more. Help me. I'm craving. Your touch on me baby. Torn up. I'm aching. I feel like I'm breaking apart. I'm craving. Your touch on me baby. Torn up. I'm aching. I feel like I'm breaking apart. I'll spread the news for you. I'll call your exes and. Make all the wedding plans. I'll fetch the haters too. You only need your man. We'll do this hand in hand. All my friends they tell me that. I got a glow they never had seen before. I'm blinding them. And when I think it goes away. I feel it rushing in my brain. I need some more. So give me more. Help me. I'm craving. Your touch on me baby. Torn up. I'm aching. I feel like I'm breaking apart. I'm craving. Your touch on me baby. Torn up. I'm aching. I feel like I'm breaking apart. Enough is enough. I ain't waiting any longer. Oh babe I'm not bluffing. I need a better lover than this. Enough is enough. I ain't fighting any longer. Oh babe I'm not bluffing. I need a better lover than this. Enough is enough. I ain't waiting any longer. Oh babe I'm not bluffing. I need a better lover than this. Enough is enough. I ain't fighting any longer. Oh babe I'm not bluffing.
