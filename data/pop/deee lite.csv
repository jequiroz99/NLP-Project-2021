groove is in the heart,"We're going to dance (x3). And have some fun. The chills that you spill up my back. Keep me filled with satisfaction. When we're done. Satisfaction of what's to come. I couldn't ask for another. No I couldn't ask for another. Your groove I do deeply dig. No walls only the bridge. My supperdish. My succotash wish. I couldn't ask for another. No I couldn't ask for another. CHORUS:. Groove is in the heart (ah-ah-ah-ah) (x2). Groove is in the heart. Groove is in the heart (ah-ah-ah-ah). The depth the hula groove. Move us to the nth hoop. We goin' thru to. Horten hears a who-ooh. I couldn't ask for another (x2). DJ soul was on a roll. I been told he can't be sold. He's not vicious or malicious. Just de-lovley and delicious. I couldn't ask for another. CHORUS.. (Rap). Someone's in this torso, hot. Gotta deal, you wanna know. Delightful, true. it's delightful. Making it, doing it. Especially at a show. Feeling kinda high. Like a Hendrix haze. Music makes motion. Moves like a maze. All inside of me, heart especially. Help of the rhythm. Where I wanna be. FLowing, glow with electric eye. As you dip to the dive. Baby, you realize. Baby, you'll see the funky side of me. Baby, you'll see that rhythm is the jey. Get, get ready with it, with it. Can't, can't quit it, quit it. Stomp on the stoop. When I hear a funk loop. Played pied piper, follow what's true. Baby, just sing about the groove. Sing it. CHORUS.. 1 2 3 be-ooh-ooh. Na-na-na-na-na. REPEAT TWICE. Groove is in the heart (ah-ah-ah-ah ne-na-na-na-na)"

bittersweet loving,I've never felt so free. I've never felt so free before. You can't stop me. From walking out the door. I've never felt so free before. We'll put the bad times behind us. Put some sugar and stir it up. I know we're gonna make it better. No more bittersweet loving. No no no more. I've never felt so free. I've got a place to go. That I call my own. I'll say it out loud. Standing proud. Free to browse. On my own. I've got a place to go. that I call my own. On my own. No bittersweet lovin'.
two clouds above nine,Just good things today. Our love's so high. The needles off the dial. Like a happy tear in your eye. You can't hide the smile. Just good things today. I know I got mine. It's like two clouds above nine. The nth degree of love is in our mind. And we just chose the time. After the rain. I'm on my way to better days. And I must say. No puddle's splash keeps me away. After the rain. Rainbows find my pot of soul. I can't complain. I'm just in from the cold. (RAP). After the rain. I'm on my way to better days. And I must say. No puddle's splash keeps me away. Reflections I've seen. Like puddles mixed with gasoline. But I can't complain. I'm on my way to better days. Two clouds above nine.

apple juice kissing,Kissin in the back row. Thatâ€™s how we missed the movie. Said you had cottonmouth. That apple juice was groovy. Splish smack on my lips. Apple juice kissin makes me roll my hips.

Easy to love â€“ our love will find a way. Easy to love â€“ our love is here to stay. Ubby Dubby Lovey Dovey. Kissin by the streetlight. Donâ€™t want to say goodnight. Swooning practically spooning.

We must try to hear each other say. No matter how different, it's still the same. We all feel love and pain. Slip off your views. Unbutton your mind. Stay awhile 1000 miles. Light a candle to your soul. Deja vu 1000 miles old. Close the door and lock the time. Jump over the wall. On the other side. Come on in, the dreams are fine. Now I know why I like this place. I pull the covers. Over my head. Black velvet darkness. Above my bed. It's beyond what I've seen or read. Now I know why I thank the days."

fuddy duddy judge,Who is the winner of the war?. Is Mother Nature gonna keep the score. Are we one for all or are we all for one. Or on the outside of a deal well done. Slicker than an oil spill cover up. Left alone like a homeless person's cup. As civilations rise and fall. Libraries burn down to the ground. But love remains standing tall. Although history is a matter of opinion. (RAP). Campaign contributions run the puppet show. Wall street types let the cocaine flow and flow. Media cowards are afraid to speak. The defense fund's the movie of the week. Men in sheeps clothing rob the poor. A bad interpreter could start a war. (MORE RAP). The jury better hurry on down. Just get on down to planet Earth. Planet Earth...transmitting. Fuddy duddy judge. Fuddy duddy duddy judge. Though we may rise and fall. We must be one for all. Don't let your mind be weak. Don't be afraid to speak. Just look at history. Amd then you've got to see. That hate will never pay. Love is the only way.
good beat,"Depending on you see a thing. The ship is free, or is it sinking?. Depending on how you see it. You cage your mind, or you free it.. Depending on how you see the times. The world divides or it closely binds. But I just wanna hear a good beat. I jus wanna I jus wanna. But I just wanna hear a good beat. I jus wanna hear a good beat.. Oooahh. Depending on you see a thing. The ship is free, or is it sinking?. Depending on how you see it. The song is over or you keep it. Depending on how you see the times. Weâ€™re wasting time or in a moving line. But I just wanna hear a good beat. Oh oh oh a. I jus wanna hear a good beat. Just piano and bass. Everything will be alright. When you feel it tonight. Zu zu zu wah zu wah. I just wanna hear a good beat."

heart be still,There's a cause for me to pause. cause in our love there is a clause. cause we belong to other hearts. Hold me back. Hold me back. Hold my will. Heart be still. You seem better than candy. My sugar dandy. I've got to stand back from the heat. Hold me back. Hold me back. Hold my will. Heart be still. Heart be still. Where we'll go no one knows. I feel weak when you do speak. It's like a rollercoaster at it's peak. Hold me back. Hold me back. Hold my will. Heart be still. Heart be still. I've got to get back. I've got to get back. I've got to get back on my feet. Just let me say my say. You're a friend I wanna keep. Where we go no one knows. Our unsaid love could be a scream. The finest dream I've ever seen. Your charm grabbed me by the arm. I've got to get back. I've got to get back. I've got to get back on my feet. I've got to get back. I've got to get back. Just let me say my say. You're a friend I wanna keep.
how do you say...love,"What is love?. I think I know what love is.. I think I know what love is.. I think I know…I think. What is love? What is love?. Mmm how do you say…. Delicious, delovely. Delectable, devine. How do you say…. Degorgeous? Dewith it?. Degroovy? Define?. Ooh lala lalalalala. Faux francaise. How do you say delicious?. How do you say delovely?. How do you say delectable?. How do you say devine?. How do you say degroovy?. Dewith it?. How do you say Deee-Lite?. We’ve been trying to find out. Is there really such a thing?"
i had a dream i was falling through a hole,"Dreams. Oh precious land. You're in the wrong hands. Stretched every way like a rubber band. I'm calling out to all Earth fans. Come on, give a damn,. and take a stand. I had a dream, I had a dream. I was falling through a hole in the ozone layer. When you slurp your slurpie in a dixie cup. Always pick every piece of litter up. Recycle cans, paper and plastic. Call your politicians, ask for it. 'cause years after years after years after you're gone. This old world has to keep on. I had a, I had a, I had a dream. I'm falling through a hole in the ozone layer. Keep the hope spinning. Keep the hope spinning the globe. We breathe the future and yet we're choking. We breathe the future and we start to chike. I see a factory blowing purple smoke. Keep the hope spinning. Keep the hope spinning the globe. Mother Earth's hope is spinning. She keeps the hope spinning the globe. The animals are endangered. Mother nature is a stranger. How do we measure nuclear waste?. Electric cars and solar TV. Organic food - the things that we need. And if you still don't understand. The information is at your hands. So make demands. Demands in this world you would like to see. Convenience is the enemy. Ooohh ooohh ooohh. Oh precious land. You're in the wrong hands. Stretched every way like a rubber band. I'm calling out to all Earth fans. Come on, give damn. and take a stand. Keep the hope spinning. Keep the hope spinning the globe. Mother Earth's hope is spinning. She keeps the hope spinning the globe."
i won't give up,I won't give up. I'll never stop our love. I'll never stop. I won't give up on love. If we could do it again. We'd do just the same baby. Because when you give your all. No matter how small. One smile is all I need to satisy me. Let's do it again. Let's do it again baby. And here you come walking down the street. One smile is all I need. I hear the harp and angel sing. Your love is like heaven. You gratify me. You satisfy me. Starting right now. Let's do it again. Let's do it again baby. Let's do it again. We'll tell all your friends baby. Do it do it. Just put your mind to it. There's nothing to it.
love is everything,Love is everything. Love love love.... I woke in the middle of the night. Just to see how you look when you're sleeping. I don't need a conversation. I just want to feel your vibration. I know your dreaming. And I hope it's about me. Real.... Sometimes you talk too much. No words only melodies. And there's nothing else to say. Nothing else to say. The words just get in the way. I've got to find our melody. Bring it back to me. Bring it back to me. Cause I know that you can feel it when it's real. There's a smile on your face. And it reminds me. How much I like my place. Right next to you. Real.... Follow your dreams. No matter how far they seem. Searching for the reason. The mystery. We can only dream. We can only dream.
mind melt,You can move. You can groove. You can mind melt. Perpetual bloom. You can sing on the curves. Of all minds perfect rings. Come around come around. I hear what you say come around. The temple of my mind. So clear so clear. Resounding no fear.
music selector is the soul reflector,"Give us the beat, the beat is pumping. Stomping and thumping. Slamming and jumping. Spirit of love, come to us. The DJs peakin peaking and tweakin. Movin and mixin pitching and twitchin. Music selector is the soul reflector."
picnic in the summertime,"Walk with me until we find the right spot. Our little excursion picnic in the park. Feet in the grass until it gets dark. Thatâ€™s when I saw the fire flies spark. The pop sickle stick is finally smooth. Hop on a lily pad for the summer groove. Walking arm and arm, so glad you came along. Check out the curly vine. The blanket was too small. But you call me baby doll. I could kiss you all the time. Watchin people have a good time. Watchin people have a good time in the summertime. Flying picnic blanket in the summer groove. No interruptions weâ€™re all alone. Cause I donâ€™t have my cellular phone. Sweatin your pose, wiggling your toes. Come at me like a panther. Cause you know yes is my answer. My mind is in the dirty making mud pies. The heavy heat stretch opened my eyes. You donâ€™t need a subway token. Natureâ€™s fee remains unspoken. The sun is shining through the leaves. On the wild flowers in the weeds."
power of love,I believe in the power of love. I believe. (repeat 3x). And the people. Call me naïve. I believe. (repeat 4x). What is it. That can make a lost soul found? Love.. And what is it. That can make the coldest day seem warm? Love.. And what is it. That can bring a smile through to a stranger?. I believe in the power of love. I believe. (repeat 2x). Let them call me naïve.. I still believe.. Power of love. (repeat 4x). What is it. That can make a lost soul found? Love.. And what is it. That can make the coldest day seem warm?. Love.. And what is it. That can bring a smile through to a stranger?. Give it everything. Cause what you give. You get so. give it everything. Open your heart.. I believe. (repeat out).

Please let our spirit last. we're raising up our last mast. And now we're drifting. down the river of freedom. On our way. On our way. On our way.
rubber lover,Rubber lover. Say rubber. Rubber lover. Don't go to bed mad at your lover. You'll wind up pulling the covers from each other. Don't make love without wearing a rubber. They might have slept with another. Rubber lover. Rubber lover. Just have a good time. Just have a good time. Don't be rushin' when you're pushin' for your lovin'. Take your time when you do the natural thing. So divine to feel the passion in this fashion. Put your brain before your ding-a-ling. Just have a good time. Just have a good time.
runaway,Why don't we...Why don't we. Why don't we...Why don't we. Take me away. Release me from the cage. Free me from the pain. And let me feel no shame. The stars spin circles around the bad times. You splashed your water on my fire sign. The fortune teller told us to unwind. Come on run away. Runaway...Runaway...Runaway. Why don't we. Why don't we. I've felt invisible for a long time. This town will smother what's left of mine. Untaken chances come back to life. Come on run away. Runaway...Runaway...Runaway. I've been I've been all. I've been I've been all. I've been I've been all around the world dream. Let's go free...Let's go free. Why don't we...Why don't we. You've been saying that you want to go. I'm finally ready to let go.

say ahh...,"All day in my mind. I replay the 2nd time we chimed. So sweet what a treat sensuelle. Skin on skin is swingingly swell. Fat treasures. Don't compare to our pleasures. Kissing and suckling. The boots come unbuckling. Enter sexual altered states. No sleep um we're staying awake. The music connects us. The rubber protects us. And what the neighbors think. Just doesn't effect us. Check my spot and dig my swirl. I'm a liberated girl. I need your loving. I want your love. I'll be your friend. I'll be your lover. Against me your body's pressed. I want to hug and kiss you. And all the rest. Forget your troubles, ills and aches. And like an earthquake. Our body shakes. Turn up the frogger bass. And enter sexual altered state. Take off your shirt. I'll take off my bra. A rub a dub lovin'. Until you say ahhh.... Keep holding on until you say ahhh.... You're smiles as big. As the Brooklyn Bridge. You rock me like no one ever did. Live and let living. Tripping not slipping. Chewing on a chicklet. Make me want to knee dip. Let me roll my full hips. Rolling Philly's acting silly. The hippy spliffy. Made you lick your lippy. Our love a dub rubbin'. Is king size trippy. Keep holding on until you say ahhh.... . ."
smile on,"You donâ€™t have to say no words. And it comes in every language. You can see it in every nation. It helps communication. Itâ€™s like a shining sun. Up high in the sky. And when you blink your eyes. Itâ€™s like a nice surprise. Take your time. As long as you make the time. To be happy. Smile on, pass it on. Smile on, pass it on. Do do dodoo. Do do do do dodoo. You got to keep moving. Keep movin keep movin. Itâ€™s a universal sign. Everyone can do it. You can change peopleâ€™s minds. If you choose to use it. Smile on, pass it on. Smile on, pass it on."
somebody,"Somebody. I need someone. To treat me right. I need someone. To hold me tight. Somebody. Gotta love. Gotta love. Gotta love. Gotta love. I want some, need some. Got to have some. Take some, make some. Got to get it. Gotta get it. Good loving. Oh oh somebody. Looking for somebody. 'Cause what seems real to me. Was just a fantasy. My infatuation. Is the current situation."
"stay in bed, forget the rest","Always ready when you hold me steady. Keeping me on the verge. Just in time to stop while we still got the urge. Give me your spice, snuggle up to me it feels nice. Laying on the carpet when weâ"
thank you everyday,I was walking around. Looking at the ground. You're the flower. Between the cracks. That I found. Like a buttercup. Under your chin. You shine so bright. And cheer me up. I want to thank you everyday. For sharing with me. I want to thank you everyway. For sharing with me me me. You put me on top of the world. Right next to you. My lover you are my pearl. I love you you you. All night. All night. All right. All night. Standing in the shade. As flowers fade away. I am a fire sign. Won't you feel my solar power. My love takes you higher high higher. Watch the dandelion. Whose petals are flying. Sip the spring whispering. Thru my grapevine. I want to thank you everyday. For sharing with me. I want to thank you everyway. For sharing with me. We're all part of the world. Joined in a song. I'm so thankful we get along. I love you you you. All night. All right. Riding with the rhythm. Every nation with them. Love intoxication. Loving celebration.
try me on...i'm very you,"What’s the real question in your mind mind mind. I’m inclined to ask you all the time time time. Do unto me as I want to do to you. Try me on, I’m very you. I can’t read your mind. So you got to let me know all the time. How it feels for it to be real. Ooh you got me you got me you got me. Ooh you got me you got me you got me. I don’t know what you do. (I don’t know I don’t know). But I like it I like it. I like what you’re doing to me. The sands of time fade into dark. Feel your pulse it’s groove o’clock. A message to madness. Feel music that’s realness"
two clouds above nine,Just good things today. Our love's so high. The needles off the dial. Like a happy tear in your eye. You can't hide the smile. Just good things today. I know I got mine. It's like two clouds above nine. The nth degree of love is in our mind. And we just chose the time. After the rain. I'm on my way to better days. And I must say. No puddle's splash keeps me away. After the rain. Rainbows find my pot of soul. I can't complain. I'm just in from the cold. (RAP). After the rain. I'm on my way to better days. And I must say. No puddle's splash keeps me away. Reflections I've seen. Like puddles mixed with gasoline. But I can't complain. I'm on my way to better days. Two clouds above nine.

what is love?,"What is love?. I think I know what love is.. I think I know what love is.. I think I know…I think. What is love? What is love?. Mmm how do you say…. Delicious, delovely. Delectable, devine. How do you say…. Degorgeous? Dewith it?. Degroovy? Define?. Ooh lala lalalalala. Faux francaise. How do you say delicious?. How do you say delovely?. How do you say delectable?.

what is this music,Trippy trippy trance dance. Hip hoppity funk on a dup tip. With a rubadub soul sip. Progressive jazz jouse. Work it to the bone house. Flipped out freakbeat. Global minded street beat. NY jungle breakbeat. As long as it makes you move your feet..
when you told me you loved me,When you told me you loved me. Did you mean it?. When you told me you loved me. Didn't you mean it?. First you kissed me on the elevator. Then you said you'd see me later. Now I haven't heard from you. And it's obvious we're through. Why'd you have to say. You loved me in that way. And I got that empty feeling. It stays with me each day. It seems to follow me around. While your on the other side of town. *chorus*. All the lies about the situation. Left me wondering in desperation. Now I know that I've been true. But it's not the same for you. Why'd you have to say. You loved me in that way. Now I haven't heard from you. And my hopes are turning blue. And I got that empty feeling. That stays with me each day. It seems to follow me around. While your on the other side of town. *chorus*.
who was that?,"Who was that, who was that?. Someone walked their feet through my house.. Who was that, who was that?. Someone sneaking quiet as a mouse.. Who was that, who was that?. Someone left their shoes on the stairs.. Who was that, who was that?. Laughing just like no one cares.. Someone in my house, I declare. Playing cards, solitaire. Who was playing in my house?. Someone in my kitchen, munching out. Peanut butter, there’s no doubt. Who was eating in my house?. Someone took a bath, Mr. Bubble. Middle name, must be trouble. Who was playing in my house?. On the porch, right outside,. Here I come, you better hide. Who was hiding inside?. Who was that, who was that?. Someone walked their feet through my house.. Who was that, who was that?. Someone sneaking quiet as a mouse.. Who was that, who was that? Boy. Someone left the radio on. Who was that, who was that? Boy. One minute here, now he’s gone."

world clique,"We don’t need a clique. To make our clock tick. Our clique is the world. The world is our clique. We don’t have to fit. In your fixed trip. Our clique is the world. The world is our trip. We don’t need a clique. To make our clock tick. Our clique is the world. The world is our clique. World clique, world clique. World clique, world clique. Small clique is like a jip in line. It happens all the time but it’s limited. World clique is like a skip through time. It’s fine and I’m digging it. I don’t have to squeeze. Just to appease your dream. My peace is the world. The world is a clique. The world is our clique. The world is a clique. World clique, world clique"
