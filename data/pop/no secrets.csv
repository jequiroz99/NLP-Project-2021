friends forever,Sometimes people come into your life. Like they're meant to be. And suddenly you've found someone. Who sees the world like you see. And you laugh like crazy. At all the crazy things. That no one thinks are funny but you. That's when I knew. That I had a friend so true. If my world were crumbling down. You are the one I'd want around. Cause through everything you've shown me that. You were the one who had my back. (Chorus). Remember the laughs. Then add up the dreams. And take it to the nth degree. We'll be friends forever. Cause youç­¶l be forever in my heart. That's where best friends are. There will always be hard times. I'm glad I've got you to see me through. And I will never forget your smile. I just have to say thank you. For being there always. Even the darkest days. Especially when you didn't have to. That's when I knew. I had a friend in you. So if your world should fall apart. Call me I'll run to where you are. I only hope that I can be. Half of the friend you've been to me. (Chorus). (Bridge). Where would I be. Without you by my side loving me. Anyone can see that weç®e the real thing. No matter what and always. Come whatever. We're best friends forever. (Chorus). .
baby it works for me,"Something went wrong now she's gone. Baby don't stress it baby don't second guess it. Don't look down turn yourself around. Baby I'm waiting with something I've been saving. To let you go she must have been a fool. Cause noone's ever made me feel the way you do. (Chorus). Whenever we touch. I can barely breathe. I'm telling you honestly. Baby it works for me. Heaven knows why. She set you free. Look in my eyes you'll see. Baby it works for me, your love it works for me. I know what you need to believe in me. I'm taking it slowly giving you time to know me. Cause noone's kiss could ever get me like this. Making me crazy that's what you do my baby. To let you go she must have been insane. Cause noone's ever, ever made me feel this way. (Chorus). Take it take your sweet time. Stay in these arms of mine. You can trust in the two of us. So hard to control myself. When I want you and noone else. You're everything, everything to me."
comes back,"Always me and you. Tight like sisters, crazy cool. So when you got kinda buddy with my guy. Nothing funny even entered my mind. Imagine my surprise. To catch you in your lies. So rude. You lose. You'll get what's coming to you. Who's the fool (not me). You forgot the golden rule(but you). (Chorus). What you put out comes back. What ya been doin is talking trash. There you go burning up that bridge. Makes me wanna say kiss this. I don't even have to stoop so low. Cause if theres one thing that I know. Everything you do comes back. Comes back to bite you in the. Ask me all innocent like. Why I'm upset, why I'm actin quiet. I'd explain but it would be useless. You've proven yourself to be clueless. How could you front like that. Cool to my face then stab my back. Oh Dude. You lose. You'll get what's coming to you. Who's the fool (not me). You broke the golden rule( but you). (Chorus). (Bridge). Two weeks later and you lost your man. He came running back to me but I told him no chance. Now you've got no best friend to turn to-in a lonely circumstance. Life can be a bummer when it all comes back. (Chorus)."

Everyone keeps secrets sometimes. (Chorus). Cross my heart and hope to die. I swear these lips will never tell another lie. If you could love me like you did before. I promise no secrets forever ever more.. (Bridge). Angels in Heaven above. I know I sinned against love. Grant me this one miracle. And I'll be a saint from now on.

Let's pretend that it's me. And I'm everything. You'll ever need. Oh. Chorus:. What are you waiting for?. Are you crazy?. Open your eyes and see. What's goin' on baby.. There's someone at your door. Her heart is racing. Go on and make your move. What are you waiting for baby?. . Now here's a clue. Her favorite colors blue.. That's how she'll feel. If she can't be with you. 'Cause you're the one. That takes her breath away (breath away). When you look that way.. So just for fun. let's pretend that it's me. And I'm everything. You'll ever need. Oh. (Chorus). I hear there's something good. That waits for you.. Check it out. It just might be true.. There's so much more to her. Than meets the eye. You'll never no it. If you don't try.. (Chorus 2x).
when we kiss,"It was late one night and we had a fight. And it seemed like nothing was going right. Then you turned around and you walked right out the door. Now it's not the first time, it's not the last. I know all about your checkered past. And we've played this game one thousand times before. (Chorus). Do you remember the night I can see it so clear. All the sweet little things that you sang in my ear. There were promises made but I think you forgot what you said. There's a real fine line between love and hate. And I'm not the type to just sit and wait. I've made up my mind I can't wait for you anymore. But when we kiss, it feels like this. And when we touch, it means so much. So many days go by and I still want you so. If it was up to me I'd never let you go. You're the only true love in my life and I want you to know. All this passion and pain I think I'm goin' insane. We've got nothing to lose and so much to gain. If you love me today, who's to say. You might leave me again. (Chorus). ."

I CANNOT ESCAPE AND I CANNOT FORGET. BABY YOU'RE THE ONE. YOU STILL TURN ME ON. YOU CAN MAKE ME WHOLE AGAIN. TIME IS LAYIN' HEAVY ON MY HEART. SEEMS I'VE GOT TOO MUCH OF IT. SINCE WE'VE BEEN APART. MY FRIENDS MAKE ME SMILE. IF ONLY FOR A WHILE. YOU CAN MAKE ME WHOLE AGAIN. REPEAT CHORUS. . REPEAT CHORUS X 2. BABY YOU'RE THE ONE. YOU STILL TURN ME ON. YOU CAN MAKE ME WHOLE AGAIN.
