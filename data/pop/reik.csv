finally,"I might have spent my whole life waiting in the dark. For I left this place with a hole inside my heart. You came when I decided this might be my face. Not one second early, not one second late. Tell me how you give me hope with just one kiss. And fill my touch really love I can't forget. Oh, finally, I breathe again. There are no words to describe it. There's no way that I can hide it. Oh no, finally, the fear is gone. and I don't have to face this world alone. even though I lost my way. with you I'm finally home. there were times the pain was more than I could take. but somehow each and every scar. has been erased. and if the sun and moon and stars. come crushing down. I'll be in your arms, no safer place I found. This is more. than a simple memory. I can't ignore. my dreams turned into really. oh finally. I breathe again. There are no words to describe it. There's no way that I can hide it. Oh no, finally, the fear is gone. and I don't have to face this world alone. even though I lost my way. with you I'm finally home"
now without you (ahora sin ti),I'm decided Today. I'll Never think about you. This feeling does me damage. It's Too Much for me.. And I am here Remembering those moments. Trying to understand why you are not here. And I'm being here waiting that some day. waiting that you decide to return.. It is the flavor. Is is the flavor of your lips. A drug that poisons. and does me drive crazy. Is the smell. Is the smell of your hair. A fragrance like spring. That remains in my skin. I cannot forget. That time in which you loved me. But now you aren't here. I miss you. I love you. never you will return. and I am here projecting these verses. Relieving the feeling of my love. AND I'm gone from here. Beginning another life. A very empty life now without you. It is the flavor. Is is the flavor of your lips. A drug that poisons. and does me drive crazy. Is the smell. Is the smell of your hair. A fragrance like spring. That remains in my skin. Now without you. I don't have another remedy that leave you to go
