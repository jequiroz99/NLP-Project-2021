I don't wanna be suprised. I wanna take a journey to the end of my life. Cos I just wanna see what it's like. Am I loved. Am I hated. In your face. Or understated. How old will I be when I die. Do I turn out alright. Is my fate up to me. Or is it run by a computer. Will my kids go to school or stay at home. In the future. Is there peace. Is there war. What's the score. I don't wanna be suprised. I wanna take a journey to the end of my life. Cos I just wanna see what it's like. Am I loved. Am I hated. In your face. Or understated. How old will I be when I die. Do I turn out alright. I just wanna see what goes on. The chance to put it right before it goes wrong. Certain things I say that I regret. And erase them all. Erase them all. Save my friends so they don't get hurt. Get the mustard stain off my favourite shirt. Have more vision than a crystal ball. A crystal ball. A crystal ball. I don't wanna be suprised.

the american dream,"I was born in Coastal Maine. Then moved away south of La. San Diego know my name. But now I live in cars and planes. These long flights long drives. I wouldn't trade for anything. Everybody wanna a piece of Americana(USA). But she don't come so easily. All the kids are gonna do what they wanna. And when we get older we can sing. We're all around the world living The American Dream. Almost died in Carolina. Crashed the van and caught on fire. When you're down and out throw up your lighters. We're little older, little brighter. Times go by, times flies so. Don't you wait for anything. Most of my friends got college loans. Sending them my love from the road. Got souvenirs, 50 states. Little magnets that say my name. Am I famous? Eh not quite. But shameless? You got that right. A toast to your wife, toast the life. Toast to the night, start it off right"
the countdown,"This beat's got me down, I'm on my knees. It's got a little touch of therapy. There's something in the water making me crazy. If this is do or die, it still doesn't phase me. Count me out. Count me in. I'm ready to begin. (x4). I've got a fever in my head, it's chillin' my toes. With every single sound my mind explodes. When no-one's watching i'm a-bump-bump-bumpin'. With each new noise I'm a-thump-thump-thumpin'. Count me out. Count me in. I'm ready to begin. (x4). If I asked you to stay. Would you come back. And dance with me. (x4). This dance, this beat is bittersweet. Come take the floor and dance with me. (x2). Count me out. Count me in. I'm ready to begin. (x4)"
the last time,"You say it's the wrong way. to leave my heart on this loose frame. There's fears that you can't escape,. All my regrets have been replaced. Once you feel it. You'll belive it. You say it's the wrong way. to leave my heart on this loose frame. Just for tonight can I love you like it's the last time?. Days go by, don't wanna lose you like I did my mind. Were feeling older it seems, I'm runnig out of my. dreams, can I love you like it's the last time?. Oh oh oh. You say that it's foolish, to fall in love with you to quick. But sometimes you can't pick,. just gotta go where the hearts drifts. Once you feel it. You'll belive it. You say that it's foolish, to fall in love with you to quick.
