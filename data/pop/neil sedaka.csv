laughter in the rain,"Strolling along country roads with my baby. It starts to rain, it begins to pour. Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin. I feel a shiver run up my spine. I feel the warmth of her hand in mine. Oo, I hear laughter in the rain. Walking hand in hand with the one I love. Oo, how I love the rainy days. And the happy way I feel inside. After a while we run under a tree. I turn to her and she kisses me. There with the beat of the rain on the leaves. Softly she breathes and I close my eyes. Sharing our love under stormy skies. Oo, I hear laughter in the rain. Walking hand in hand with the one I love. Oo, how I love the rainy days. And the happy way I feel inside. [break]. I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.

love in the shadows,"In the shadows, you've got to know your lover mostly by feel. You've got to put your faith in things you can touch. If you dare to. Cos the shadows, can make you crazy with the things they reveal. They show it all without revealing too much. Scare the hell out of you. Chorus. Cos me and my love, live among the shadows. Where the old playground is an alley way. Now me and my love, make love among the shadows. When the sun goes down, in a dark hallway. Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes. Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow. Me and my baby know, love in the shadows. In the shadows, you've got to work at love to get it to shine. You can't believe in everything that you see. Not this time around. Cos the shadows, can play a half a million tricks on your mind. You try your best but you can never be free. It just kinda drags you down. Cos me and my love, live among the shadows. Where the old playground is an alley way. Now me and my love, make love among the shadows. When the sun goes down, in a dark hallway. Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes. Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow. Me and my baby know, love in the shadows."
solitaire,"There was a man, a lonely man. Who lost his love, thru his indifference. A heart that cared that went unshared. Until it died within his silence. And solitaire is the only game in town. And every road that takes him, takes him down. While life goes on around him everywhere. He's playing solitaire. And keeping to himself, begins to deal. And still the king of hearts is well concealed. Another losing games comes to an end. And deals them out again. A little hope goes up in smoke. Just how it goes, goes without saying. There was a man, a lonely man. Who would command the hand he's playing. And solitaire is the only game in town. And every road that takes him, takes him down. While life goes on around him everywhere. He's playing solitaire. And keeping to himself, begins to deal. And still the king of hearts is well concealed. Another losing games comes to an end. And deals them out again. And solitaire is the only game in town. And every road that takes him, takes him down. While life goes on around him everywhere. He's playing solitaire"

the hungry years,"Girl we made it to the top. We went so high we couldn't stop. We climbed the ladder leading us nowhere. Two of us together. Building castles in the air. We spun so fast we couldn't tell. The gold ring from the carousel. How could we know the ride would turn out bad. Everything we wanted. Was everything we had. I miss the hungry years. The once upon a time. The lovely long ago. We didn't have a dime. Those days of me and you. We lost along the way. How could I be so blind. Not to see the door. Closing on the world. I now hunger for. Looking through my tears. I miss the hungry years. We shared our daydreams one by one. Making plans was so much fun. We set our goals and reached the highest star. The things that we were after. Were much better from afar. Here we stand just me and you. With everything and nothing, too. It wasn't worth the price we had to pay. Honey take me home. Let's go back to yesterday. I miss the hungry years. The once upon a time. The lovely long ago. We didn't have a dime. Those days of me and you. We lost along the way. How could I be so blind. Not to see the door. Closing on the world. I know hunger for. Looking through my tears. I miss the hungry years. I miss the hungry years"
our last song together,"Days of devils, kings and clowns. Angel songs and birthday tunes. Valentines and wishing wells. Magic stairways, moods, and Junes. Silly rhymes and monkeyshines. Pictures on a stage. Round and round the records go. Time to turn the page. This will be our last song together. Words will only make us cry. This will be our last song together. There´s no other way to say good-bye. Misty faces, far off places. Came and danced across the stage. Sha na na´s and Doo be down´s. The sounds that chased away the blues. Yesterday is yesterday. The past is dead and gone. Nostalgia just gets in the way. Let´s stop hanging on. This will be our last song together. Words will only make us cry. This will be our last song together. There´s no other way to say good-bye. Now we go our separate ways. And the world we used to know. Scratchy worn out 45´s. An echo on the radio. Tra la days are over now. Those days of you and me. Now we know that breaking up is. Really hard to do. This will be our last song together. Words will only make us cry. This will be our last song together. There´s no other way to say good-bye. There´s no other way to say good-bye...."

Lost in a city of little tin gods. Cold plastic people with phoney facades. How can you win when you look at the odds. You're running down a one way street. Nobody cares if you survive. Sometimes you beg or you don't eat. You gotta fight to stay alive. Hey, you're never gonna get away. Where 's the world you used to know. Where did all the good times go. Look around your hopes and dreams are gone. But like a fool you still keep hanging on. Music. Come and be a movie star. Come and drive a fancy car. Come and see, what you really are. Look in the mirror, mirrors don't lie. You're getting older, your time's past you by. You lost your shot to some younger guy. You're running down a one way street. Nobody cares if you survive. Sometimes you beg or you don't eat. You gotta fight to stay alive. Hey, you're never gonna get away. Nothing is real in cardboard California. Just waking up brings you down.

here we are falling in love again,"In love so many fall but rarely do we rise in love. We sing the saddest song,. Lamenting to ourselves how bad we feel when love goes wrong. I know I've been in love so many many times before. And swore to all my friends. That I would never never fall in love again. Chorus. And here we are falling in love again. Who'd ever believe we could. After all the many heavy falls. Why should it feel so good. Here we are falling in love again. I still can't believe it's true. Here we are falling in love. And there's nothing we can do. In dreams I often see a never ending kind of love. That glides on golden wings. Above the everyday affairs and ordinary things. In love so many fall from dizzy heights of fantasy. To find their love in flames. So very sure that it was nothing more than just a game. And here we are falling in love again. Who'd ever believe we could. After all the many heavy falls. Why should it feel so good. Here we are falling in love again. I still can't believe it's true. Here we are falling in love. And there's nothing we can do. Music. And here we are falling in love again. Who'd ever believe we could. After all the many heavy falls. Why should it feel so good. Here we are falling in love again. I still can't believe it's true. Here we are falling in love. And there's nothing we can do. And here we are falling in love again. Who'd ever believe we could. After all the many heavy falls. Why should it feel so good. Here we are falling in love again. I still can't believe it's true. Here we are falling in love. And there's nothing we can do."

And it's all that I can do to keep from running after you. And though I wanted you. I let you walk away. It's just a simple case of heartache. My hands begin to tremble and my knees shake.

Stop, I can hear my tummy. Look in the fridge and let lunch keep us together. Whatever. I will I will I will I will"
my baby,"My baby, my baby, my baby, my baby. Wait till you see my baby. You won't believe your eyes. And if you think there's no such thing as an angel. You're in for a surprise. Wait till you see my baby, gee whizz she's out of this world. And out of all the boys that she could have chosen. She want to be my girl. (What about her hair) Her hair is gold like the sunlight. (What about her eyes) Her eyes are diamonds that shine. (What about her lips) Her lips are redder than rubies. This treasure is mine. She took my heart to heaven. Now I'm in paradise. And if you doubt me wait till you see my baby. You won't believe your eyes. (What about her hair) Her hair is gold like the sunlight. (What about her eyes) Her eyes are diamonds that shine.

Since I saw her this morning, I'm on cloud number nine. Found a garden. of eden at the house next door to mine. I took a look and oh what a shock. To find a little bit of heaven right on my block. I'm livin right next door to an angel. And I'm gonna make that angel mine. I can't believe that this is the girl next door. That funny little face isn't funny no more. Sicteen and oh what a dream.

number one with a heartache,"Twinkle twinkle super star, fame and fortune took you far. Everybody envies you, you're number one. Night and day your records play, but ever since she went away. Life ain't no fun. The songs you write about her, keep coming back without her. The king of the charts is the king of broken hearts. Chorus. Number one with a heart ache. Hear the man singing on the radio. With every play his heart is breaking. Number one with a heart ache. Sing your song while the whole world sings along. Your love is gone, but the music goes on. Gee it was a long hard climb, and it took a lot of time. Time away from her when you should've been there. Birthdays on the telephone, Christmases she spent alone. I wasn't fair. It took so long to make it, the girl just couldn't take it. Now that it's made was it worth the price you paid. Number one with a heart ache. Hear the man singing on the radio. With every play his heart is breaking. Number one with a heart ache. Sing your song while the whole world sings along. Your love is gone, but the music goes on. Number one with a heart ache. Hear the man singing on the radio. With every play his heart is breaking. Number one with a heart ache. Sing your song while the whole world sings along. Your love is gone, but the music goes on."

our last song together,"Days of devils, kings and clowns. Angel songs and birthday tunes. Valentines and wishing wells. Magic stairways, moods, and Junes. Silly rhymes and monkeyshines. Pictures on a stage. Round and round the records go. Time to turn the page. This will be our last song together. Words will only make us cry. This will be our last song together. There´s no other way to say good-bye. Misty faces, far off places. Came and danced across the stage. Sha na na´s and Doo be down´s. The sounds that chased away the blues. Yesterday is yesterday. The past is dead and gone. Nostalgia just gets in the way. Let´s stop hanging on. This will be our last song together. Words will only make us cry. This will be our last song together. There´s no other way to say good-bye. Now we go our separate ways. And the world we used to know. Scratchy worn out 45´s. An echo on the radio. Tra la days are over now. Those days of you and me. Now we know that breaking up is. Really hard to do. This will be our last song together. Words will only make us cry. This will be our last song together. There´s no other way to say good-bye. There´s no other way to say good-bye...."
perfect strangers,An afternoon of sad affairs. Shared in the hope of mending broken dreams. The constant struggle after simple pleasures. Finds us perfect strangers you and I. You know I hate to see you cry. And through the tears that fall like winter rain. You say you're tired of merely just surviving. We've so much in common that we're. Chorus. Perfect strangers singing perfectly in tune. From seperate corners of the room. Held together by our hunger to get by. Perfect strangers you and I. Let's make a toast to no regrets. Wet down the painful sting of sweet love lost. Let evening find us whispering in our whiskey. Come and sit beside me for a while. You know I love to see you smile. And if perhaps you're only passing through. At least we tried to reach an understanding. And for just one moment we were. Perfect strangers singing perfectly in tune. From seperate corners of the room. Held together by our hunger to get by. Perfect strangers you and I. Music. Perfect strangers singing perfectly in tune. From seperate corners of the room. Held together by our hunger to get by. Perfect strangers you and I.
run samson run,"NEIL SEDAKA lyrics - Run Samson Run. In the bible, 1000 years BC. There's a story of ancient history. 'Bout a fella who was strong as he could be. 'Til he met a cheatin' gal who brought him tragedy. Oh, run Samson run, Delilah's on her way. Run Samson run, you ain't got time to stay. Run Samson run, on your mark you better start. I'd sooner trust a hungry lion. Than a gal with a cheatin' heart. She was a demon (was a demon). A devil in disguise. He was taken (he was taken). By the angel in her eyes.

sad sad story,"Look at the lady she's the one with the broken heart. Even so she musn't know that I've loved her from the start. She needs a friend now more than a new romance. I'd love to take her in my arms but I can't take the chance. Chorus. Ooh it's such a sad sad story but there'll be a happy ending. Just you wait and see what I can do, ooooh. When you see a lady cryin' can you blame a guy for tryin'. To move on in and make his dreams come true. I gotta secret but I'm keeping it to myself. I'm bored to tears when my heart hears that she loves someone else. I tell her I'm sorry but it's really just a lie. Cos every time he hurts her I'm so happy I could die. Ooh it's such a sad sad story but there'll be a happy ending. Just you wait and see what I can do, ooooh. When you see a lady cryin' can you blame a guy for tryin'. To move on in and make his dreams come true. I love the lady and I want to make her smile. I know she's lonely but it only hurts for a little while. Soon as it's over you know the sun is gonna shine. And when she's ready for someone new, guess who's first in line. Ooh it's such a sad sad story but there'll be a happy ending. Just you wait and see what I can do, ooooh. When you see a lady cryin' can you blame a guy for tryin'. To move on in and make his dreams come true. Ooh it's such a sad sad story but there'll be a happy ending.

should have never let you go,"When you walk into a room,. Your beauty steals my breath away.. When you look into my eyes,. I find it hard to find the words to say.. Want to run away and hide,. I've just got to let you know.. Feel so tangled up inside,. I should have never let you go.. Anyone can make mistakes,. And we both have made our share,. But a life without your love,. Is a life too hard to bear.. I don't care who's right or wrong,. Only know I love you so.. Why did I have to write this song?. I should have never let you go.. Why?. In all the wide, wide world,. Have I run into you here,. Wish I could disappear.. I'll never understand,. Why I even give a damn.. When you walk into a room,. You know I stand on shaky ground.. I've built so many walls around me,. Now the walls are tumbling down.. You're the kind I can't forget,. Let the tears begin to flow.. I have only one regret,. I should have never let you go.. Should have never let you go,. Should have never let you go,. Should have never let you go.. Should have never let ......you go.."
smile,"Smile,. Though your heart is aching. Smile, even though it's breaking. When there are clouds. In the sky, you'll get by. If you smile. Through your fears and sorrow. Smile, and maybe tomorrow. You'll see the sun come shinning through... for you. Light up your face with gladness. Hide, every trace of sadness. Although a tear. Maybe ever so near. That's the time you must keep on trying. Smile. What's the use of crying?. You'll find that life it's still worthwhile. If you just smile"
solitaire,"There was a man, a lonely man. Who lost his love, thru his indifference. A heart that cared that went unshared. Until it died within his silence. And solitaire is the only game in town. And every road that takes him, takes him down. While life goes on around him everywhere. He's playing solitaire. And keeping to himself, begins to deal. And still the king of hearts is well concealed. Another losing games comes to an end. And deals them out again. A little hope goes up in smoke. Just how it goes, goes without saying. There was a man, a lonely man. Who would command the hand he's playing. And solitaire is the only game in town. And every road that takes him, takes him down. While life goes on around him everywhere. He's playing solitaire. And keeping to himself, begins to deal. And still the king of hearts is well concealed. Another losing games comes to an end. And deals them out again. And solitaire is the only game in town. And every road that takes him, takes him down. While life goes on around him everywhere. He's playing solitaire"

steppin out,"You go where you want do what you please. Never let on, not even once, that you've ever been lonely. It's nice to see you alone. Are you looking for something maybe you ain't gettin' at home. Your hair is in place dressing to kill. Your old man has said that when he dies he will leave you his money. And the pool where you swim. Are you looking for something maybe you ain't gettin' from him. Chorus. Steppin' out, steppin' out, to get a little action on the side. Steppin' out, steppin' out, the day time queen takes a midnight ride. And it's plain as plain could be, you're a woman who wants to be free. So if you're steppin' out tonight honey, come on and step out with me. The party's a bore, it's bound to get worse. Let's slip out somewhere and engage in our own celebration. Let me pour you some wine. Are you thinking maybe baby your needs are the same as mine. Let's go for a walk, go for a ride,. Or maybe just stand here and think what we can do to eachother. No we don't have to dance. If you're thinking of stepping out, honey this is your chance. Chorus X 2."

Well, I'm acting like a lovesick fool,. you've even got me carrying her books to school.. Hey hey, set me free.. Stupid Cupid stop picking on me.. You messed me up for good right from the very start,. hey now, go play Robin Hood with somebody else's heart.. You got me jumping like a crazy clown,. and I don't feature what you're putting down,. well since I kissed her loving lips of wine,. the thing that bothers me is that I like it fine.. Hey hey, set me free.. Stupid Cupid stop picking on me."

Fly, fly, fly super bird, super bird.. While you’re young super bird, super bird.. There’s time enough to wreck your dreams.. Have your fun, super bird.. They said I couldn’t, so what did I do then?. I cried myself to sleep and never tried again.. Poor little super bird they woke you up too soon.. No Santa Claus or green cheese on the moon.. It skipped my mind for years, at least until tonight,. When I tucked the kids in bed and I turned out the light.. There at the doorway, you’ll never guess what I heard. “Zoom, zoom, zoom, super bird.”. Fly, fly, fly super bird, super bird.. While you’re young super bird, super bird.. There’s time enough to wreck your dreams,. Have your fun, super bird."

Don't leave me like this, dangling from a star.. You set me all aflame and it's so pleasin',. It would be a shame if you were only teasin'.. So, my love, before I go, turn the light way down low,. And talk to me, talk to me, talk to me."

the hungry years,"Girl we made it to the top. We went so high we couldn't stop. We climbed the ladder leading us nowhere. Two of us together. Building castles in the air. We spun so fast we couldn't tell. The gold ring from the carousel. How could we know the ride would turn out bad. Everything we wanted. Was everything we had. I miss the hungry years. The once upon a time. The lovely long ago. We didn't have a dime. Those days of me and you. We lost along the way. How could I be so blind. Not to see the door. Closing on the world. I now hunger for. Looking through my tears. I miss the hungry years. We shared our daydreams one by one. Making plans was so much fun. We set our goals and reached the highest star. The things that we were after. Were much better from afar. Here we stand just me and you. With everything and nothing, too. It wasn't worth the price we had to pay. Honey take me home. Let's go back to yesterday. I miss the hungry years. The once upon a time. The lovely long ago. We didn't have a dime. Those days of me and you. We lost along the way. How could I be so blind. Not to see the door. Closing on the world. I know hunger for. Looking through my tears. I miss the hungry years. I miss the hungry years"
the immigrant,Harbours open there doors to the young searching foreigner. Come to live in the light of the big L of liberty. Plains and open skies bill boards would advertise. Was it anything like that when you arrived. Dream boats carried the future to the heart of America. People were waiting in line for a place by the river. Chorus. It was time when strangers were welcome here. Music would play they tell me the days were sweet and clear. It was a sweeter tune and there was so much room. That people could come from everywhere. Now he arrvies with hopes and his heart set on miracles. Come to marry his fortune with a hand full of promises. To find they've closed the door they don't want him anymore. There isn't anymore to go around. Turning away he remembers he once heard a legend. That spoke of a mystical magical land called America. It was time when strangers were welcome here. Music would play they tell me the days were sweet and clear. It was a sweeter tune and there was so much room. That people could come from everywhere. It was time when strangers were welcome here. Music would play they tell me the days were sweet and clear. It was a sweeter tune and there was so much room. That people could come from everywhere.

My lonely days were through. You're just a rose. That shimmers in the sun. And now I know. My life has just begun. You are the sweetest thing. That could ever, ever be. And you're a miracle to me. You fill my life. With tenderness and harmony. I never thought. That I'd be laughing once again. You fill the room. With something warm and wonderful. I can't imagine life. Without your precious love. You're just a rose. That shimmers in the sun. And now I know. My life has just begun. You are the sweetest thing. That could ever, ever be. And you're a miracle to me. Rivers bend rivers flow. Till the end of time. They keep flowing. Through eternity. Take me there. Sail away. Take me to the sea. You're a river that flows inside of me. You're just a rose. That shimmers in the sun. And now I know. My life has just begun. You are the sweetest thing. That I could ever, ever see. And you're a miracle to me"
the other side of me,"You think you know me pretty well,. But how can you tell,. You never get inside my head.. The times we talk, we never speak,. We play hide and seek. So many things are left unsaid.. Why can't you see. What's on the other side of me,. The side of me that reaches out to you.. Sweet thoughts and dreams,. Like drops of rain on rippling streams. That wind and bend,. Rivers with no end,. Flowing on the other side of me.. It seems I always get unstrung. I trip on my tongue. With words that come out somethin' else.. I'm so afraid the things I say. Might chase you away,. I have to hide behind myself.. Why can't you see. What's on the other side of me,. The side of me that reaches out to you.. Why must I hide. These feelings that have been denied.. Only you can set me free. See what's on the other side of me.. La la la la la la la la. La la la la la. La la la la la la la la. La la la la la la la la. La la la la la. I have to hide behind myself.. Why can't you see. What's on the other side of me,. The side of me that reaches out to you.. Why must I hide. These feelings that have been denied.. Only you can set me free. See what's on the other side of me,. On the other side of me,. On the other side of me."
the queen of 1964,"Anyone who's played on a record date. Will remember Stage-Door-Jenny. Well, I saw her last night and man,. She looks like she wasn't gettin' any. (Ah-h-h-h-h-h-h). Rock and roll kinda took it's toll. When she shed her inhibitians. Too many scenes in limousienes. And dressing room intermissions. She was the queen of 1964. But the truth of the matter is. Nobody wants her anymore. There was a time she could've shown you how. But nobody wants an overage groupie now. When it came to a superstar. Jenny was a braggart. Spread it all around to everyone in town. That she once had Mick Jagger. (Oh-h-h-h-h-h-h). There's no doubt when the truth comes out. True love will over conquer. She didn't get Mick but she got a kick. And a black eye from Bianca. She was the queen of 1964. What a pity she became a shadow of. The girl she was before. She passed her prime it seems a shame, somehow. But nobody wants an overage groupie now. De-da-da-da-da-de-da-da. De-da-da-da-da. De-da-da-da-da-de-da-da. De-da-da-da-da. De-da-da-da-da-de-da-da. De-da-da-da-da. De-da-da-da-da-de-da-da. De-da-da-da-da. I'm afraid that the Morning Trade. Had a sad obiturary. There'll be no more Jenny at the door. They took her to the cemetary. (Ah-h-h-h-h-h-h). Just an autograph book and a stereo. There was no one she was close ta. She was found with her arms around. An Elvis Presley poster. She was the queen of 1964. Tonight there'll be a moment of silence. At the Trubadour. There was a time she could've shown you how. But nobody wants an overage groupie now. But nobody wants an overage groupie now. De-da-da-da-da-de-da-da. De-da-da-da-da. De-da-da-da-da-de-da-da. De-da-da-da-da. Ba-ba-oom-a-moow-moow. Ba-ba-oom-moow-moow. Ba-ba-oom-a-moow-moow-moow-moow. Ba-ba-oom-a-moow-moow. Ba-ba-oom-moow-moow. De-da-da-da-da-de-da-da. De-da-da-da-da. De-da-da-da-da-de-da-da. De-da-da-da-da. Ba-ba-oom-a-moow-moow. Ba-ba-oom-moow-moow. Ba-ba-oom-a-moow-moow-moow-moow."
waking up is hard to do,"You slept your night now. it's morning time. That's the time. to rise and shine. Don't you cry. and don't be blue. Wakin' up is hard to do. Just brush your teeth. and then get dressed. When you comb your hair. you'll look the best. Now you know it's really true. Wakin' up is hard to do. They say that wakin' up is hard to do. Wear a smile don't you be blue. Just wipe the sleep from your eyes. Instead of going back to bed. You got to stretch and face the day. Just listen to the birdies sing. And the flowers. that await the spring. Rise and shine,. you're dreaming's through. Wakin' up is hard to do. They say that wakin' up is hard to do. Wear a smile don't you be blue. Just wipe the sleep from your eyes. Instead of going back to bed. You got to stretch and face the day. Just listen to the birdies sing. And the flowers that await the spring. Rise and shine, you're dreaming's through. Wakin' up is hard to do"
we kiss in a shadow,"We kiss in a shadow, we hide from the moon,. our meetings are few and over too soon!. We speak in a whisper afraid to be heard. when people are near, we speak not a word!. Alone in our secret together we sigh. for one smiling day to be free!. To kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky. behold and believe what you see,. behold how my lover loves me!. Alone in our secret together we sigh. for one smiling day to be free!. To kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky. behold and believe what you see.. behold how my lover loves me!"
what a surprise,"Do do do do do do do do, what a surprise. Do do do do do do do do, what a surprise. Ooh Ooh Ooh, what a surprise. She stood there looking like she didn't care. Looking right through me like I wasn't there. Could've bowled me over when I realized. She was cooking me breakfast what a surprise. What a surprise baby, oh what a night. Looking real good, she was moving just right. I can't begin to describe all the charms. I held in my arms what a surprise. OOHH, OOHH, she didn't say nothing, not a word. OOHH, OOHH, I knew she was telling me something. Had to go back for a second helping. Out of the blue and right into my heart. I'm telling you, you can't keep us apart. Lights up the sky like the stars in the night. Who would have thunk it what a surprise. Bridge. What a surprise baby, oh what a night. Looking real good she was moving just right. Lights up the sky like the stars in the sky. Who would have thunk it what a surprise. Ad lib first line and fade."
you can hear the love,"Like the summer wind that whispers in the dark. Let the song ignite the spark and you can hear the love. Hush of evening and the rustling of the leaves. The murmur as a baby breathes and you can hear the love. Chorus. Her body moves just like a symphony she needs you. To be the one who's harmony will guide her. And let her know she's getting through. And you can hear the love. Sometimes it sounds just like a never ending choir. She puts your words to music's sweet desire. And whenever she is near, you can hear the love. (Don't you know that you can feel it, touch it, always hear the love). Tender touches to the rythm of the night. Written down in candle light beneath the stars above. Sweetly woven in a perfect applique. Listen to the music play and you can hear the love. Ch x 2. Ad lib and fade."
you gotta learn your rythm and blues,"The board of education from Maine to Tenessee. Just don't dig that crazy ABC. You know they teach us something different and they call it R & B. Chorus. You gotta learn your rythm and blues. Everybody's shoutin' the news. Go out and buy a pair of rock and roll shoes. Or brother you're gonna lose. The time is incidental, the fun is fundemental. When you learn your rythm and blues. No more readin' and writin' and 'rythmetic. You got to know the three R's when the teacher swings the hickory stick. Start a-reelin' and a-rockin' and a-rollin' with your chick. Chorus. When the teacher gives us homework everyone shouts hooray, hooray. I got to go right home and study without delay. I got to tune into Bandstand and get the lesson for today. Chorus X 2."
you mean everything to me,"You are the answer to my lonely prayer. You are an angel from above. I was so lonely till you came to me. With the wonder of your love.. I don't know how I ever lived before. You are my life, my destiny. Oh my darling, I love you so. You mean everything to me. If you should ever, ever go away. There would be lonely tears to cry. The sun above would be never shine again. There would be teardrops in the sky. So hold me close and never let me go. And say our love will always be. Oh, my darling, I love you so. You mean everything to me. So hold me close and never let me go. And say our love will always be. Oh, my darling, I love you so. You mean everything to me."
you're so good for me,"Today I opened up my eyes. And reached to touch your face. But found that you were gone.. Now the tears begin to show,. And now I think I know. What love can do.. Now I realise that baby you're so good for me,. Don't care what other people say,. They say that I could lose my heart,. I don't care, I don't care, feels so good. To have you lay down by my side. And baby it's so clear to see. That you're so good for me.. Oh yes, it was a San Francisco night,. The moments that we shared. Will haunt me constantly.. Oh, was this for real or just a dream,. I guess that love is never what it seems to be.. Now I realise that baby you're so good for me,. Don't care what other people say,. They say that I could lose my heart,. I don't care, I don't care, feels so good. To have you lay down by my side. And baby it's so clear to see. That you're so good for me.. Now I realise that baby you're so good for me,. Don't care what other people say,. They say that I could lose my heart,. I don't care, I don't care, feels so good. To have you lay down by my side. And baby it's so clear to see. That you're so good for me,. You're so good for me,. You're so good for me,. You're so good for me baby."
