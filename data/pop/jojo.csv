music.,"I used to hear the voices through the thin walls. Tension building up and I'd feel so small. Some nights I'd hide under the pillows. 'Cause I didn't know what else to do. Started singing just to get some attention. A melody to cut through the addiction. And every song I made turned into wishes. Some of them came true. Everyone rises, everyone falls. Everyone spends some nights alone. Rich or for poor. I'm always yours. You never left me on my own. Tell me who, who would I be without you. No matter how much we lose. Every time I bet my life on you. We were never rich not even thousands. Mom was on her knees cleaning houses. I used to go to work with her some days. And dream and dance in the big hallways. Everyone's scared, everyone's scarred. Everyone spends some nights alone. But every high, every low. You never left me on my own. Tell me who, who would I be without you?. No matter how much we lose. Every time I bet my life on you. Tell me who, would I be without you?. Nothing I'd rather do. Every night I bet my life on you. Who would I be without you?. Went on the road to make my daddy proud. But I lost him and then I sang to the crowd. My only hope that he's looking down thinking. ""Oh my God, my daughter's doing it now"". Tell me who, who would I be without you?. No matter how much we lose. Every time I bet my life on you. Tell me who, would I be without you?. Nothing I'd rather do. Every night I bet my life on you. Who would I be without you?"

Because it feels like I'm not anything at all. But I am, I am, I am, I am beautiful. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, that's what you do. It's time to change up the game. Can't be that little girl no more. The one you cut up on the floor. I'm done with all the shame. And no, no, don't you dare. Who do you think you are standing there?. I tell you. I am, I am, I am, I am worthy of love. Am I, am I, am I, am I strong enough?. Because it feels like I'm not anything at all. But I am, I am, I am, I am beautiful. There was a time when I let you in.

It was just a dream, it was all a dream. I walk around, cold to the warmth of life. I see ya tryin' to talk, but I'm deaf to lies. Right, I believe in promises of tomorrow. If I don't make it there, know that I'm that sorry, though. Take it away, take it from me. Cuz I really wanna believe. After the rain, someone'll say. There's really more for me. I keep tellin' ma, tellin' ma, tellin' myself. That my bad luck's gonna go away. And I keep tryin' and tryin' and try, try to win. But I'm losing every day. I wanna get up and fight, but I don't have the time. I'm too busy feelin' sorry for me. When it looks like the clouds are gone. I wake up, it was just a.... See, I've been through Hell and I am still yet to come back. There is no conductor to get this on track. I have dreams of freedom from the circumstance I'm in. If it's in His plans for me, then I will win. I'll just dream til' then. I keep tellin' ma, tellin' ma, tellin' myself. That my bad luck's gonna go away. And I keep tryin' and tryin' and try, try to win. But I'm losing every day. I wanna get up and fight, but I don't have the time. I'm too busy feelin' sorry for me. When it looks like the clouds are gone. I wake up, it was just a dream, it was just a dream. It was just a dream, it was all a dream. It was just a dream"

billions,"3:30 in the morning time. Watching my lover sleep. With my heart wide open. All this racing in my mind. Thoughts of lovers lingering. And my eyes wide open.

far from heaven,"I heard nickel in your heart, in your heart. It was worth save it, so I thought, so I thought. But time passed us by, wasn't on our side. Think it skipped us.

miss you most (at christmas time),The fire is burning. The room's all aglow. Outside the December wind blows. Away in the distance. The carolers sing in the snow. Everybody's laughing. The world is celebrating. And everyone's so happy. Except for me tonight. Because. I miss you. Most at Christmas time. And I can't get you. Get you off my mind. Every other season comes along. And I'm all right. But then I miss you. Most at Christmas time. I gaze out the window. This cold winter's night. At all of the twinkling lights. Alone in the darkness. Remembering when you were mine. Everybody's smiling. The whole world is rejoicing. And everyone's embracing. Except for you and I. Baby. I miss you. Most at Christmas time. And I can't get you. Get you off my mind. Every other season comes along. And I'm all right. But then I miss you. Most at Christmas time. In the springtime. Those memories start to fade. With the April rain. Through the summer days. Till Autumn's leaves are gone. I get by without you. Till the snow begins to fall. And then. I miss you. Most at Christmas time. And I can't get you. Get you off my mind. Every other season comes along. And I'm all right. But then I miss you. Most at Christmas time
music.,"I used to hear the voices through the thin walls. Tension building up and I'd feel so small. Some nights I'd hide under the pillows. 'Cause I didn't know what else to do. Started singing just to get some attention. A melody to cut through the addiction. And every song I made turned into wishes. Some of them came true. Everyone rises, everyone falls. Everyone spends some nights alone. Rich or for poor. I'm always yours. You never left me on my own. Tell me who, who would I be without you. No matter how much we lose. Every time I bet my life on you. We were never rich not even thousands. Mom was on her knees cleaning houses. I used to go to work with her some days. And dream and dance in the big hallways. Everyone's scared, everyone's scarred. Everyone spends some nights alone. But every high, every low. You never left me on my own. Tell me who, who would I be without you?. No matter how much we lose. Every time I bet my life on you. Tell me who, would I be without you?. Nothing I'd rather do. Every night I bet my life on you. Who would I be without you?. Went on the road to make my daddy proud. But I lost him and then I sang to the crowd. My only hope that he's looking down thinking. ""Oh my God, my daughter's doing it now"". Tell me who, who would I be without you?. No matter how much we lose. Every time I bet my life on you. Tell me who, would I be without you?. Nothing I'd rather do. Every night I bet my life on you. Who would I be without you?"

no more tears,"Got my damn mascara running down my face. Crying buckets in the bathroom of this place. In the mirror, asking how could this be. Suddenly the mirror started talking back at me.

No more tears for you. There'll be no more tears for you. And I'm alright, fix my hair make sure my makeup's reapplied. Regain my composure get back in my stride. Said to the mirror, your new start is right outside. Walk up out the bathroom. He won't see me coming, he's sitting in the corner with a girl and not a woman. When I walk up, such a scared look on his face. And I just smile and this is what I say. You ain't worth my tears. You ain't worth my time. There ain't no love here. And I'm gon' be just fine. You ain't worth my tears. On to something new. No more tears for you. No more tears for you. There'll be no more tears for you. I have the right to knock her out that chair.

running on empty,"(Not Too Loud). I'ma PYT with an attitude. Sometimes I rebound from what I'm supposed to do. But when your love conquered my heart. I knew I had to have you, all of the time.

I'm stalling on this road alone. When I'm gone too long. I'm running on empty without you. I'm going without because I'm running on E. And yes I know this effect. Baby I'm running on empty without you. Choose the game I'm telling you. Boy in your eyes I saw the truth (saw the truth, yeah). 1Cause It was just so right. And now that I got you. I know what was missing in my life. See I've been gone for a while now. There's nothing I can take. The miles keep us away and I feel.... [Chorus]. Without you I'm running out of energy. I want you here with me. And baby without you. I'm stalling on this road alone. When I'm gone too long. I'm running on empty without you. I'm going without because I'm running on E. And yes I know this effect. Baby I'm running on empty without you. It's uncontrollable, I get emotional. What more can I say. Like a coffee with cream you compliment me. And I never want to be too far away. [Chorus]. Without you I'm running out of energy. I want you here with me. And baby without you. I'm stalling on this road alone. When I'm gone too long.

safe with me,"My phone keeps ringin, my boyfriend's beepin me. Can't get ahold of me. Not because I don't hear, but I know I can't answer in this kinda company.

It would probably seal the deal. And I'd be left alone. Cause. He doesn't know that I'm kissin another man while he's missin me. He wouldn't see any difference cause my secret is safe with me. I know I shouldn't keep anything from him. But I hide it away because I love him. I'll lock the door and throw away the key. And it's safe with me. When I'm with my man, I don't gotta pretend cause my heart feels like it's home. But the second I leave, I lose track of my feet and I run to another's arms. I'm not a bad girl, it's just a big world, don't wanna feel like I'm missin out. So many fish in the lake, didn't know I was bait, but I... am. What would he do. If he knew what was really goin on.

He doesn't know that I'm kissin another man while he's missin me. He wouldn't see any difference cause my secret is safe with me. I know I shouldn't keep anything from him.

thinkin out loud,"We had a meeting at the farmer's market. And talked over a bottle of wine. A parliament; my cigarette, he sparked it. And I knew I was playing with fire. Man I shouldn't have come here alone. I've been looking for love in all the wrong places. Been telling myself I'm grown. But when I look in his eyes I'm his girl and he knows it. You kiss like you love me now. You know I can't tune that out. Your frequency hits me less frequently. I have to haunt your dreams. You can't stay mad at me. Just cause we're ""supposed to be"" don't mean we're gonna be. You can still break my heart. Even if we're only messing around. Something's different now. I'm just thinking out loud. And I try to be cool. But my feelings keep pulling me down. I'm different now. I'm just thinking out loud. I got my armour you can call me heartless. But I'm the one you're leaving behind. To get the stigma outta my mind. And I shouldn't have come here alone. When we do the wrong thing it hurts sometimes. But it feels like you're coming home. When I look in his eyes I'm his girl and he knows it. Making love to me now. You know I can't tune that out. Your frequency hits me less frequently. I have to haunt your dreams.

white girl in paris,"The way I see it,? he said. ?You just can't win it?. Everybody's in it for their own gain. You can't please ?em all. There's always somebody calling you down. I do my best. And I do good business. There's a lot of people asking for my time. They're trying to get ahead. They're trying to be a good friend of mine. (chorus). I was a free man in Paris. I felt unfettered and alive. There was nobody calling me up for favors. And no one's future to decide. You know I'd go back there tomorrow. But for the work I've taken on. Stoking the star maker machinery. Behind the popular song. I deal in dreamers. And telephone screamers. Lately I wonder what I do it for. If l had my way. I'd just walk through those doors. And wander. Down the Champs Elysees. Going cafe to cabaret. Thinking how I'll feel when I find. That very good friend of mine. (chorus). I was a free man in Paris. I felt unfettered and alive. Nobody was calling me up for favors. No one's future to decide. You know I'd go back there tomorrow. But for the work I've taken on. Stoking the star maker machinery. Behind the popular song"
who's gonna fight for me?,"(verse). Everybody dealt what they paid for tonight. Ain't just one we can lie. Never feel the heat, the light. I hate to see em walk away. And home is where the bed lies, it ain't right. I'm wrestling myself. Reaching up for help for a long long time. (pre-chorus 1). I'm getting over, try getting sober. Look around for something to hold onto. It's not love but we look lover. Who's gonna fight for me?. (chorus). Will anybody fight for the fighter?. Does anybody know where to find er?. 'cause maybe I'm the still remainder. And no one's gonna rescue me. No, I'm not just sitting alone. I gotta learn to stand on my own. 'cause I'm the only one in the play. Who's gonna fight for me?. Oh oh, oh oh oh. Who's gonna fight for me?. Oh oh, oh oh oh. Who's gonna fight for me?. Oh oh, oh oh oh. Yea, yea. (verse). It's just me and my big dream. But what does it really mean. There's nobody around to see. I'm never letting somebody cry. (pre-chorus 2). What is the reason I keep on leaving?. If I will find something to hold onto. If it's not a lover then who'll be my cover?. Who's gonna fight for me?. (chorus). Will anybody fight for the fighter?. Does anybody know where to find er?. 'cause maybe I'm the still remainder. And no one's gonna rescue me. No, I'm not just sitting alone. I gotta learn to stand on my own. 'cause I'm the only one in the play. Who's gonna fight for me?. (bridge). Who's getting tired within. Pushing me over my limb. Sometimes I want it, but even meant to be in it. But baby, I'm not a quitter. So I'mma stand with my chin up. At the end of the day. You know that I'm gonna win it yay. Will anybody fight for the fighter?. Does anybody know where to find er?. 'cause maybe I'm the still remainder. Who's gonna fight for me?. (chorus). Will anybody fight for the fighter?.

who's loving you,"When I had you. I treated you bad and wrong, my dear. And girl since, since you went away. Don't you know I sit around. With my head hanging down. And I wonder who's loving you. Life without love. It's, oh, so lonely. I don't think, I don't think. I'm gonna make it. All my life, all my life, baby. I've been lost to you only. Come on and take it girl.

why didn't you call,"I can't believe I'm all alone. Especially cause it's friday night. I had things to do. But I rushed them up to be with you. All dressed up with no where to go. I've been watching time go by, the minutes lie. But I still haven't heard from you. How busy can you be. Clearly too busy for me. You know I like you so much. But you're pissing me off. Really pissing me off. I need consistancy. You know you don't deserve me. Say you like me so much. But your pissing me off. Really pissing me off. Look at what you did. 'Cause you just lost one. Now you made that deep damage, is done. You were lucky to just have my number at all. So tell me baby, tell me why didn't you call?. It's gonna take more than a Coke and a smile. To make me forget that you didn't dial. You were lucky to just have my number at all. Break it down for me, why didn't you call?. I'm feeling so delusional. Cause I thought that you and I were vibing. Maybe that was in my mind. This shit is bad for my ego. Guessing where that you would rather spend your time. Laid up in my arms tonight. How busy can you be. What are you doing if it's not me. I know I like you so much. And it's pissing me off. Really pissing me off. But baby honestly. It's clear you don't deserve me. Say you like me so much. But your pissing me off. Really pissing me off. Look at what you did. 'Cause you just lost one. Now you made that deep damage, is done.

You were lucky to just have my number at all. Break it down for me, why didn't you call?. Thought that we had chemistry. Now I'm second guessing things. It's crazy how one thing can change the game. (How to change, how to change, how to change the game). I'm not trying to waste my time. Waiting up for you, well no. Gonna throw you out my pocket. Like some loose change. Look at what you did. 'Cause you just lost one. Now you made that deep damage, is done. You were lucky to just have my number at all. So tell me baby, tell me why didn't you call?. It's gonna take more than a Coke and a smile. To make me forget that you didn't dial. You were lucky to just have my number at all. Break it down for me, why didn't you call?"
wonder woman,"Reminiscing. Touching all the places that your lips were kissing. From the bedroom to the hallway, in the kitchen. Where our fantasies came true. Well, it's been a minute.

I guess that's still true. Because I wonder. I wonder, I wonder, I do. I catch myself thinking 'bout you. And I wonder if you think about me too. Because I wonder. (I wonder, I wonder). Was it magic?. Was the energy between us always making static?. And everytime I threw it back boy. You'd be there to catch it. Saying nothing else can beat this view. Don't you miss the way it feels to lose yourself in me?. Drowning in each other's oceans. Nothing tastes as sweet, it's true. I only wanna come for you. Remember when. You used to call me Wonder Woman?. When I gave you good love. I guess that's still true, you know that's still true. Because I wonder. I wonder, I wonder, I do. I catch myself thinking 'bout you. And I wonder if you think about me too. Because I wonder. (I wonder, I wonder). I don't wanna think about what you doing. With the next chick (No, no). All I wanna think about is you staying as my. Got me restless, hella hectic. When I reminisce I'm still loving it. It was like that chronic, bionic. Just awesome, love that shit. And you know I really miss your body. And you know I really miss your body. Ain't nobody got it like you got it. You got it, you got it good, boy. Drinks on me stop pulling me under. Baby, do you think about me still? 'Cause I wonder. Because I wonder. I wonder, I wonder, I do. I catch myself thinking 'bout you. And I wonder if you think about me too. Because I wonder. Do you feel, baby, what I do?"
