see you,"A thin white bed. A stack of magazines unread. Three days since you've slept. In this place time crawls by. Seconds service to a lifetime. We should cherish that. Do you know. Do you know.

As your shadow I will dance with you again. Cause we don't just flicker and fade. With love, nobody's gone forever. I'll see you when you get there. Simple words. In attempt to dull the hurt. I know you're trying hard. The lull of these machines. Keeping time with every heartbeat. A soliloquy. Do you know. Do you know. That I am on the brink of something beautiful. (So believe). I'll be here. Don't you shed a single tear. Let the memories remind you how to smile. You fill me in. The sun, it warms your skin. As your shadow I will dance with you again.

the blizzard of 89',"We welcome winter's wind. The colors of our bones will collect me and compound. And clear your mind before the ground gets cold. Embers in air, the wind in your hair. If you were a snowflake, and possibly I'd be the same shape as you. Spilled coffee in the mornings. You still adore me, and that's what I love about the cold nights. Cause your jacket fit is just my size. Whoa oh oh oh. Baby love is like the holidays,. cause everyone's here, and this is sincere. Check that!. This you made for Christmas Day. Cause hopping on the rooftop all night giving out. Gifts to the world so every boy and girl can. feel the way that I do, everytime I see you. And it's these suttle things that make our spirits warm. And it's the comfort of carols sung, and ribbons hung. and Christmas lights on distant back road drives. Embers in air, you know it's hard being so far. It's a test of strenght, but all it takes is the moments by your side. Come morning when I wake up,. You fix your make up. Lighting the fire up all night. We'll drink hot chocolate and sing and sigh. Whoa oh oh oh. Baby love is like the holidays,. cause everyone's here, and this is sincere. Check that!. This you made for Christmas Day. Cause hopping on the rooftop all night giving out. Gifts to the world so every boy and girl can. feel the way that I do, everytime I see you. I'm coming home to the Midwest. Chasing down winter wonderland. You take your Pointsetta. You tell me why's it's better being home right by your side. I'm driving home but the ice storm is making this a test of strenght, a test. Miracles real tonight, the feelings right, the decorations falling in place. Baby love is like the holidays,. cause everyone's here, and this is sincere. Check that!. This you made for Christmas Day. Cause hopping on the rooftop all night giving out. Gifts to the world so every boy and girl can. feel the way that I do, everytime I see you.

We'll run to the west coast to live in seattle.. I'm singing circles with cellular motivation. I was searching locations for space stations. But I caught my own star.. I thought I made it so obvious,. Obviously I did not. Oh no. You say I'm dear to you, is that true?. I've got a hundred other hearts. That add up to my love for you..

airplanes,"Can we pretend that airplanes. In the night sky are like shooting stars?. I could really use a wish right now. Wish right now, wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes. In the night sky are like shooting stars?. I could really use a wish right now. Wish right now, wish right now. I could use a dream or a genie or a wish. To go back to a place much simpler than this. 'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'. And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion. And all the pandemonium and all the madness. There comes a time where you fade to the blackness. And when you're staring at that phone in your lap. And you hoping but them people never call you back. But that's just how the story unfolds. You get another hand soon after you fold. And when your plans unravel and they sayin'. What would you wish for if you had one chance. So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late. I'm on my way so don't close that gate. If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight. And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night. Can we pretend that airplanes.

I could really use a wish right now. Wish right now, wish right now. Somebody take me back to the days. Before this was a job, before I got paid. Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank. Back when I was tryin' to get into the subway. Oh, when I was rappin' for the hell of it. Now a days we rappin' to stay relevant. I'm guessing that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes. Then maybe yo, maybe I'll go back to the days. Before the politics that we call the rap game. And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape. And back before I tried to cover up my slate. But this is for the Cada, what's up Bobby Ray?. So can I get a wish to end the politics. And get back to the music that started this shit. So here I stand and then again I say. I'm hopin' we can make some wishes outta airplanes. Can we pretend that airplanes. In the night sky are like shooting stars?. I could really use a wish right now. Wish right now, wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes. In the night sky are like shooting stars?. I could really use a wish right now. Wish right now, wish right now. I could really use a wish.

Despite if we argue, I need, hold, and love you. This is nothing new, you know we've done this before. This is nothing new, I think that we can take more. (Don't say that you miss me too much). (I feel it too). With much hesitation, begin contemplation. Jump from your window into my arms right now. We'll take I-69, pay no mind to exit signs. Because we're living free for the first time right now. Sing along, my little songbird. When you hear your favorite melody arise. Oh, if I called her Carolina. Would it bring back summer memories that passed?. You wished it all, you wished it all. You wished it all away. I'll wish it all, I'll wish this all away. I'll change my life today. Blue eyes, watch like fire. The sea of faces 'til we drown. Keep calm, act like nothing happened. We won't be found out. And I would never let you down. I would never let you down. But this is something I must do. This is something I must do for myself, oh. You wished it all, you wished it all. You wished it all away. Oh, I wish it all, I'll wish this all away. I'll change my life today. When summer gets here I'll start new. I'll shade my eyes and think of you. Monday will be Friday. The only things I'll keep the same. Are my missed notes and my slight frame. I'll even change my name. I'll even change my name..."
