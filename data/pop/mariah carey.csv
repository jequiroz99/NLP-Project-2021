i want to know what love is,"I gotta take a little time. A little time to think things over. I better read between the lines. In case I need it when I'm older.

I wanna feel what love is. I know you can show me. Gonna take a little time. A little time to look around me. I've got nowhere left to hide. It looks like love has finally found me.

hero,"There's a hero, if you look inside your heart.. You don't have to be afraid of what you are.. There's an answer, if you reach into your soul,. And the sorrow that you know will melt away.. And then a hero comes along, with the strength to carry on,. And you cast your fears aside, and you know you can survive.. So when you feel like hope is gone,. Look inside you and be strong,. And you'll finally see the truth, that a hero lies in you.. It's a long road, when you face the world alone.. No one reaches out a hand for you to hold.. You can find love, if you search within yourself,. And the emptiness you felt will disappear.. And then a hero comes along, with the strength to carry on,. And you cast your fears aside, and you know you can survive.. So when you feel like hope is gone,. Look inside you and be strong,. And you'll finally see the truth, that a hero lies in you.. Lord knows, dreams are hard to follow.. But don't let anyone, take them away- ay ay.. Hold on, there will be tomorrow.. In time, you'll find the way.. And then a hero comes along, with the strength to carry on,. And you cast your fears aside, because you know you can survive.. So when you feel like hope is gone,. Look inside you and be strong,. And you'll finally see the truth, that a hero lies in you .. That a hero lies in... you. That a hero lies in... you"
without you,"No I can't forget this evening. And your face as you were leaving,. But I guess that's just the way the story goes. You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows. Yes it shows.. No I can't forget tomorrow. When I think of all my sorrow,. When I had you there but then I let you go.. And now it's only fair that I should let you know. What you should know.. I can't live if living is without you.. I can't live, I can't give anymore.. I can't live if living is without you.. I can't give, I can't give anymore.. Well I can't forget this evening. Or your face as you were leaving,. But I guess that's just the way the story goes.. You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows.. Yes it shows.. I can't live if living is without you..

we belong together,"I didn't mean it when I said. I didn't love you so. I should have held on tight. I never should have let you go. I didn't know nothing,. I was stupid, I was foolish. I was lying to myself. I couldn't have fathomed. I would ever be without your love. Never imagined I'd be sitting. Here beside myself. Guess I didn't know you. You'd guess I didn't know me. But I thought I knew everything. I never felt. The feeling that I'm feeling. Now that I don't hear your voice. Or have your touch and kiss your lips. Cause I don't have a choice. Oh what I wouldn't give. To have you lying by my side. Right here cause baby. When you left I lost a part of me. It's still so hard to believe. Come back baby please cause. We belong together. Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough. Who's gonna talk to me on the phone. Till the sun comes up. Who's gonna take your place. There ain't nobody better. Oh baby baby. We belong together. I can't sleep at night. When you are on my mind. Bobby Womack's on the radio. Singing to me ""If You Think You're Lonely Now"". Wait a minute this is too deep. I gotta change the station. So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break. And then I hear Babyface. ""I Only Think Of You"" and it's breakin' my heart. I'm tryin' to keep it together but I'm falling apart. I'm feeling all out of my element. Throwing things, crying tryin'. To figure out where the hell I went wrong. The pain reflected in this song. Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside. I need you, need you back in my life baby. When you left I lost a part of me. It's still so hard to believe. Come back baby please cause. We belong together. Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough. Who's gonna talk to me on the phone. Till the sun comes up. Who's gonna take your place. There ain't nobody better. Oh baby baby.

almost home,"Hey, hey. You're almost home. You're almost home. You're almost home. I've seen the light in the sky. And the skies are like fireflies. Burning bright. Just to vanish in the dark. I've held hope in my two hands. But there will be another chance. To find the kingdom. I believe it in my heart. 'Cause underneath the good. There's something greater than you know. When you're almost there. And you're almost home. Just open up your eyes and go, go. When you're almost there. Almost home. Know you're not alone. You're almost home. (You're almost home). When you run, run so far. You've forgotten who you are. Where you're from is like some other universe. They count your steps. Like they're regrets. You catch one breath then lose the rest. Wrong is right, right is left. And there is no where left to turn. So don't believe in everything. You think, you think you know. When you're almost there. And you're almost home. Just open up your eyes and go, go. When you're almost there. Almost home. Know you're not alone. You're almost home. When you let your heart be the compass. (it'll always lead you home). You won't get alone, not if you trust it. (it'll always lead you home). When you hear the sound of the trumpet. Louder than ever before. Oh, when you're almost there. Almost home. Just open up your eyes and go, go. 'Cause you're almost there. Almost home. Know you're not alone. You're almost home. When you're almost there. Almost home. Just open up your eyes and go, go. Almost there. You're almost home. Know you're not alone. You're almost home"
alone in love,"Swept me away. But now I'm lost in the dark. Set me on fire. But now I'm left with a spark. Alone, you got beyond the haze and. I'm lost inside the maze. I guess I'm all alone in love.

All alone in love. Swept me away. But now I'm lost in the dark. Set me on fire. But now I'm left with a spark. Alone, you got beyond the haze and. I'm lost inside the maze. I guess I'm all alone in love. You haunt me in your dreams. I'm calling out your name. I watch you fade away. Your love is not the same. I've figured out your style. To quickly drift apart. You held me for a while. Planned it from the start. All alone in love. Sitting in the dark without you. How am I supposed to make it. Through the night. Slowly fall apart without you. Cry away the hours. Til the morning light. Swept me away. But now I'm lost in the dark. Set me on fire. But now I'm left with a spark. Alone, you got beyond the haze and. I'm lost inside the maze. I guess I'm all alone in love"

And makes me smile. When I'm unhappy. All you gotta do is call. And suddenly things don't really. Seem so bad at all. (Boy) I need you. (Boy) Adore you (Boy). Gotta have you (Oh boy). I wanna feel your touch. This ain't no little crush. So come and get my love. Baby anything you want. Feeling you (Boy). Fiending for you (Boy). Just waiting on you (Boy). When I see you (Oh boy). I'm gonna wrap you up. Inside my love. And never let you go boy. Never let you go boy. Rap Break (Cam'ron). (Boy) I need you. (Boy) Adore you (Boy). Gotta have you (Oh boy). I wanna feel your touch. This ain't no little crush. So come and get my love. Baby anything you want. Feeling you (Boy). Fiending for you (Boy). Just waiting on you (Boy). When I see you (Oh boy). I'm gonna wrap you up.

butterfly,Verse 1. When you love someone so deeply. They become your life. It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside. Blindly I imagined I could. Keep you under glass. Now I understand to hold you. I must open up my hands. And watch you rise. Chorus 1. Spread your wings and prepare to fly. For you to become a butterfly. Fly abandonedly into the sun. If you should return to me. We truly were meant to be. So spread your wings and fly. Butterfly. Verse 2. I have learned that beauty. Has to flourish in the light. Wild horses run unbridled. Or their spirit dies. You've given me the courage. To be all that I can. And I truly feel your heart will. Lead you back to me. When you're ready to land. Chorus 2. Spread your wings and prepare to fly. For you and me become a butterfly. Fly abandonedly into the sun. If you should return to me. We truly were meant to be. So spread your wings and fly. Butterfly. Bridge. I can't pretend these tears. Aren't over flowing steadily. I can't prevent this hurt from. Almost overtaking me. But I will stand and say goodbye. For you'll never be mine. Until you know the way it feels to fly. Chorus 3. Spread your wings and prepare to fly. For you have become a butterfly. Fly abandonedly into the sun. If you should return to me. We truly were meant to be. So spread your wings and fly. Butterfly. Chorus 4. Spread your wings and prepare to fly. For you have become a butterfly. Fly abandonedly into the sun. If you should return to me. We truly were meant to be. So spread your wings and fly. Butterfly. So flutter through the sky. Butterfly. Spread your wings and fly. Butterfly

Olden times and ancient rhymes. Of love and dreams to share. Sleigh bells in the air. Beauty everywhere. Yuletide by the fireside. And joyful memories there. Christmas time is here. We'll be drawing near. Oh, that we could always see. Such spirit through the year. Oh, that we could always see. Such spirit through the year"
christmas (baby please come home),"(Christmas). The snow's coming down. (Christmas). I'm watching it fall. (Christmas). Lots of people around. (Christmas). Baby please come home. (Christmas). The church bells in town. (Christmas). All ringing in song. (Christmas). Full of happy sounds. (Christmas). Baby please come home. They're singing ""Deck The Halls"". But it's not like Christmas at all. Cuz I remember when you were here. And all the fun we had last year. (Christmas). Pretty lights on the tree. (Christmas). I'm watching them shine. (Christmas). You should be here with me. (Christmas). Baby please come home. They're singing ""Deck The Halls"". But it's not like Christmas at all. Cuz I remember when you were here. And all the fun we had last year. (Christmas). If there was a way. (Christmas). I'd hold back this tear. (Christmas). But it's Christmas day. (Please). Please. (Please). Please. (Please). Please.

christmas time is in the air again,"Christmas time is in the air again. Christmas chimes reminding me of. When we fell like the snow. So deep in love. High above us the evergreens. Sparkle with lights and feel the breeze. As we made future Christmas memories.. Christmas shoppers glance at us and smile. 'Cause the mistletoe is occupied. And the dream is to share. This Christmas cheer with you all year. And not wait till the morning. When Christmas time is in the air again.. Mr. Grinch simply can't resist. Warming up when he looks our way. Even Old Scrooge makes a Christmas wish. For a honey to hold Christmas day. And to feel love like ours always. La da da, da da dum. And the dream is to share. This Christmas cheer. With you all throughout the year. And not wait till the morning. When Christmas time is in the air. Christmas time is everywhere. Christmas time is in the air again.. Again. And again."
circles,"Verse 1. Ever since you left me. I've been trying to hide the pain. Painting on a smile with lipstick. Putting on a big charade. So difficult to keep pretending. It's getting harder everyday. It's plain to see I'm cold and heartsick. Since you turned and walked away. I just keep going round and round. And round in circles. Keep on tumbling down. Chorus 1. Oh boy my world has changed. And I don't think I can make it without you. Nothing's the same. You got me running around in circles over you. (running around in circles over you). Verse 2. Saturday I saw you. Holding hands with someone new. Somehow I kept my composure. Just like everything was cool. But inside I kept repeating. Don't you let them see you cry. So I casually turned my head. As the tears rolled down my eyes. I just keep going round and round. And round in circles. Keep on tumbling down. Chorus 2. Oh boy my world has changed. And I don't think I can make it without you. Nothing's the same. You got me running around in circles over you. Bridge. Everything is you. How can I pull through. My heart is consumed I'm so confused. Still caught up in you...love can be so cruel. Baby don't know how to turn you loose. Chorus 3. Oh boy my world has changed. And I don't think I can make it without you. No, nothing's the same. You got me running around. And running around. And running around. Nothing's the same. Baby baby cause you. Got me running around. In circles over you. (running around in circles over you)"
close my eyes,I was a wayward child. with the weight of the world. that I held deep inside.. Life was a winding road. and I learned many things. little ones shouldn't know. Chorus:. But I closed my eyes. steadied my feet on the ground. raised my head to the sky. and though times rolled by. still I feel like a child as I look at the moon. maybe I grew up a little too soon. La-da-da-da-da..... Funny how one can learn. to grow numb to the madness. and block it away. I left the words unsaid. let it all dissipate. and I try to forget. Chorus. Bridge:. Nearing the edge. Obvious I almost. Fell right over. A part of me. Will never be quite able. To feel stable. That woman-child falling inside. Was on the verge of fading. Thankfully I. Woke up in time. Guardian angel I. sail away on an ocean. with you by my side.. Orange clouds roll by. they burn into your image. and your still alive. Chorus
clown,"I should've left it at, how ya doin'. I should've left it at. I like your music too, and. I should've never called you back. When you pursued me. I should've never given you. My fuckin' two way. I should've never listened. To your woeful stories. The ones I'm sure you. Told a thousand times before me. You should've never intimated. We were lovers. When you know very well. We never even touched each other. Who's gonna love you when. It all falls down, and. Who's gonna love you when. Your bankroll runs out. Who's gonna care when the novelty's over. When the star of the. Show isn't you anymore. Nobody cares when the tears of a clown. Fall down.... Nobody cares when the tears of a clown. Fall down. I gotta break it to aya delicately, honey. Takin' my g5 twenty minutes wasn't nothin'. But I guess you wouldn't know. That's the way I roll. Consequently now your ego's fully. Overblown. You don't want the world to know. That you're just a puppet show. And the little boy inside. Often sits at home alone. And cries, cries, cries, cries. (Boo hoo. Who?). Who's gonna love you. When it all falls down, and. Who's gonna love you. When your bankroll runs out. (When your bankroll runs out). Who's gonna care when the novelty's over. When the star of the. Show isn't you anymore. Nobody (Nobody). Your pain is so deep rooted. What will your life become. Sure you hide it. But you're lost and lonesome. Still just a frail shook one. Who's gonna love you. When it all falls down, and. (Tell me who's gonna love you? Who? I'd like to know). Who's gonna love you when. Your bankroll runs out. (If you didn't have nothing). Who's gonna care when the novelty's over. (Who, who'd still be there). When the star of the show isn't you anymore. (Nobody, nobody, nobody, oh). Nobody cares when the tears of a clown. (There ain't nobody baby). Fall down.... (Bullies in the schoolyard). (When they fall they fall hard). Nobody cares when the tears of a clown. (Yeah... so you). Fall down. (Better think twice, better play niace). ('Cause who's gonna be there). Who's gonna love you when it all falls down, and. (When the jokes on you). Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out. (A marionette show). Who's gonna care when the novelty's over. (Who's makin' you move though). When the star of the show isn't you anymore. (I know what kills you slow). Nobody cares when the tears of a clown. (I'm gonna keep your little). Fall down. (Secret though, mmmm, hmmmm). (And you know that I know). Nobody cares when the tears of a clown. (You're no superhero). Fall down.... (I guess your mamma never told you. that what goes around comes around. Pow)"

My friends must have thought. I was high to have given so much. To someone not worth my time. Chorus: Funny how sometimes. You can really lose your mind. And things you would never do. You rhapsodize. And get caught up in the hype. 'Till your senses return to you. Love plays you for a fool. You were so insecure. And your crew was so Immature. Conversations, painfully weak. You were much better off. When you didn't speak. But boy to tell you the truth. It was my illusion of you. Being somehow destined for me. That had me in a daze. But we're not the same in truth.

fourth of july,Trembling. Starry eyed. As you put your hand in mine.... It was twilight. One the Fourth of July. Sparkling colors were. Strewn across the sky. And we sat close enough. That we just barely touched. While roman candles. Went soaring above us and baby. Chorus. Then you put your hand in mine. And we wandered away. I was trembling inside. But I wanted to stay. Pressed against you there. And leave the world behind. On that Fourth of July. So starry eyed. On the flower hillside. Breathless and fervid. Amid the dandelions. As it swept over me. Like the wind through the trees. I felt you sigh with a. Sweet intensity and baby. Then you put your hand in mine. And we floated away. Delicately lay entwined. In an intimate daze. A crescent moon began to shine. And I wanted to stay. Tangled up with you among the fireflies. Thunder clouds. Hung around. So threateningly. Ominously hovering. And the sky. Opened wide. Showering. Then you put your hand in mine. And we ran from the rain. Tentatively kissed goodnight. And went our seperate ways. And I've never truly felt the way that I. Felt the Fourth of July. Truly I have never felt the same inside. Like that Fourth of July. Truly I could never feel the same as I. Felt that Fourth of July

You can find love, if you search within yourself,. And the emptiness you felt will disappear.. And then a hero comes along, with the strength to carry on,. And you cast your fears aside, and you know you can survive.. So when you feel like hope is gone,. Look inside you and be strong,. And you'll finally see the truth, that a hero lies in you.. Lord knows, dreams are hard to follow.. But don't let anyone, take them away- ay ay.. Hold on, there will be tomorrow.. In time, you'll find the way..

i am free,Once I was a prisoner. Lost inside myself. With the world surrounding me. Wandering through the mysery. But but now I am free. You gave me a breath of life. Unclouded my eyes. With a sweet serenity. Lighting a ray of hope for me. And now I am free. . Free to live. Free to laugh. Free to soar. Free to shine. Free to give. Free to love. Free enough to fly. Once I was all so alone. Unsteady and cold. but your love rained down upon me. Washing away uncertainty. But now. I am free.

i don't wanna cry,"Once again we sit in silence. After all is said and done. Only emptiness inside us. Baby, look what we've become. We can make a million promises. But we still won't change. It isn't right to stay together. When we only bring each other pain. Chorus:. I don't wanna cry. Don't wanna cry. Nothing in the world. Could take us back. To where we used to be. Though I've given you my heart and soul. I must find a way of letting go. 'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry. Too far apart to bridge the distance. But something keeps us hanging on and on. Pretending not to know the difference. Denying what we had is gone. Every moment we're together. It's just breaking me down. I know we swore it was forever. But it hurts too much to stay around. Chorus. All the magic's gone. There's just a shadow of a memory. Something just went wrong. We can't go on make-believing. Chorus"

Constantly on a roll. Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old. Went from Lucy's and buses to fifty cent sodas. And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers. Mad years passed. Still got each other back. Word is bond never screw none of these industry cats. We like Scull and Mulder. Walkin' shoulder to shoulder. Milkin' this game watchin' our seeds gettin' older.

Yes you know I'll die for you. And ya know I'll ride with you. I will always try with you. And give ya my love and cry with you. I will climb a mountain high. Until I was up to touch the sky. So baby come and get more close to me. This is where your love is supposed to be. I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini. It's been a few months in PA you haven't seen me. Ya lookin' good in that Gucci bikini. 38 carats ya ring lookin' freezy. No matter what I do in the world you never leave me. Fall back ma I'll make ya lifestyle easy.

Like what we had. Ain't nothin' at all. What I wanna do is. Ride shot-gun next to you. With the top down like we used to. Hit the block, proud in the SVU. We both know our heart is breaking. Can we learn from our mistakes. I can't last one moment alone. We said let go. But I kept on hanging on. Inside I know it's over. You're really gone. It's killing me.

Will find ourselves in love again. Each day of my life. I'm filled with all the joy I could find. You know that I. I'm not the desperate type. If there's one spark of hope. Left in my grasp. I'll be holding it with both hands. It's worth the risk of burning. To have a second chance. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO I need you baby. I still believe that we can be together. If we believe that true love never has to end. Then we must know that we will love again. CHORUS:. I still believe. Someday you and me. Will find ourselves in love again. I had a dream.

i wish you well,"This goes up to you, and you, and you.. When glory days. turn to stormy nights. You must have been so petrified. Didn't You? Didn't you feel so cold?. You against the world in a losing fight (a losing fight). Captive of your demons inside. So you sought an anemy. I'm not your enemy, he lives in you, you know it's true. Like times before. to mock ignorantly. But the lord said love, love your enemy so just... Take heed to the word it's time. Check proverbs 19:29, don't cry. I wish you well. I wish you well. I wish you well. I Truly wanted solidarity. Still wearing my blinders back than. (so much i didn't see). I weep for what i dreamed we all could be. I'll keep you in prayer till the end. Still bruised still walk on eggshells. Same frightened child hide to protect myself. (can't believe I still need to protect myself from you). But you can't manipulate me like before. Examine First John Chapter 4:4,4. And I wish you well. I wish you well. I wish you well. (be strong in The Lord and the power of his might). If my shows of gratitude. are miniscule Inside your mind, sorry. There's only so much i can do. I love you and i did all that i could. Maybe when you're cursing me. You don't feel incomplete. But we've all made mistakes. Felt the guilt and self-hate. I know you've been there for plenty. Maybe still got love for me. But let him without sin. cast the first stone brethren. But who remains standing then. Not you not I, see Phillipians 4:9. (put it into practice and The God of Peace will be with you). So I wish you well. I wish you well. I wish you well. (he who The Son sets free is free indeed). No weapon formed against me shall prosper. Surely god is my salvation. I will turst and not be afraid. The lord, The Lord, is my salvation. I will trust in him. Yes, I know that i know that i know that i know. But I have had god's help to this very day. And so I stand here and testify. to small and great alike. So the more you curse me,. the more you're blessing me. The word said it. Love your enemies. Do good to those who curse you. Pray for those who mistreat you. Salms 129:2. They have Greatly oppressed me from my youth. But they have not gained victory over me. (In Jesus's name). I wish you well. (He that keeps his mind state on the lord). He will keep them in perfect peace)"

And you've always been a friend to me. But now I'm wanting more. I must have been so blind. I never realized. You're the one that's right for me. All the while I couldn't see. And now I feel so strange. I'll never be the same. Going 'round and 'round in circles. And I don't know what to do. 'Cause baby. I've been thinking about you. In the most peculiar way. I've been thinking about you. It's unbelievable to me. But suddenly I think. I'm falling in love with you. There's no explaining how I feel inside. I'm going through a transformation. That's so hard for me to hide. I had a revelation that. Finally opened my eyes. The one I spent a lifetime searching for. Was right here all the time. I was oblivious so very out of touch. All the while I couldn't see. You're the one that's right for me. And now my world has changed. I'll never be the same. Going 'round and 'round in circles. And it's all because of you. Sweet baby. I've been thinking about you. In the most peculiar way. I've been thinking about you. It's unbelievable to me. But suddenly I think. I'm falling in love with you. Don't you know.

just to hold you once again,Do you know. How it feels. Lying here without you baby. You could never understand what's happening to me. So alone. Nothing's real. I just dream about you baby.

To believe. I don't have you right beside me. As I long to touch you. But you're out of my reach. And my heart doesn't feel. It's so very cold inside me. Just a shadow of someone that I used to be. Even though you're not my lover. Even though you're not my friend. I would give my all. To have you here. Just to hold you once again. You were the only one (only one). That I allowed inside my heart. Now I'm just holding on. To something so far gone. Where did I go wrong. Even though you're not my lover. Even though you're not my friend. I would give my all. To have you here. Just to hold you once again. Just to hold you once again
languishing (interlude),"If you could only see. That I was not put here for you. To judge me and dispute my in most truth. And after all these years of enmity, envy and tears. It's a shame you don't know me at all. I was wondering would you cry for me. If I told you that I couldn't breathe. If I was drowning, suffocating. If I told you that I couldn't breathe. Those ageless buried recollections. We transform them and select them. You have yours, I have mine that's fine. Why are we too torn to heal. Our stitches never disappear. I have mine, you have yours, I'm sure. I was wondering. Would you reach for me. If you saw that I was languishing. I was wondering would you cry for me. If I told you that I couldn't breathe. If I was drowning, suffocating. If I told you that I couldn't breathe. Por FelipeCarvalho"

long ago,"Once upon a time you whispered softly in my ear. Loving words, and fairy tales that I longed to hear. I gave you my body and soul and you took control. As you slowly swept me up and carried me away. You told me pretty lies. As I held onto you tight. You knew how to get your way. Ignorance was bliss in your warm embrace. Long ago. You used to want me. Now it's all so far away. But you still haunt me. And take me back to yesterday. Every now and then I drown in thoughts of yesterday. And the fools paradise that you blew away. I feel you beside me again and remember when. You came to my window on a dark and stormy day. Baby I need you now. Tonight I'm crumbling down. Sinking in the memories. Shadows of you keep washing over me. Long ago. You used to want me. Now it's all so far away. But you still haunt me. Long ago. You used to want me. Now it's all so far away. But you still haunt me. And take me back to yesterday. Baby I need you now. Tonight I'm crumbling down. Sinking in the memories. Shadows of you keep washing over me. Long ago. You used to want me. Now it's all so far away. But you still haunt me. (Repeat)."

lullaby of birdland,"Oh, lullaby of birdland that's what I. Always hear, when you sigh. Never in my word-land could there be ways to reveal. In a phrase how I feel. Have you ever heard two turtle doves. Bill and coo when they love?. That's the kind of magic music we make with our lips. When we kiss. And there's a weepy old willow. He really knows how to cry. That's how I'd cry in my pillow. If you should tell me farewell and goodbye. Lullaby of birdland whisper low. Kiss me sweet, and we'll go. Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above. All because we're in love. Lullaby, lullaby. Have you ever heard two turtle doves. Bill and coo when they love?. That's the kind of magic music we make with our lips. When we kiss. And there's a weepy old willow. He really knows how to cry. That's how I'd cry in my pillow. If you should tell me farewell and goodbye. Lullaby of birdland whisper low. Kiss me sweet, and we'll go. Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above. And it's all because we're in love"
make it happen,Not more than three short years ago. I was abandoned and alone. Without a penny to my name. So very young and so afraid. No proper shoes upon my feet. Sometimes I couldn't even eat. I often cried myself to sleep. But still I had to keep on going. Never knowing if I could take it. If I would make it through the night. I held on to my faith. I struggled and I prayed. And now I've found my way. Chorus:. If you believe in yourself enough. And know what you want. You're gonna make it happen. (Make it happen). And if you get down on your knees at night. And pray to the lord. He's gonna make it happen. (Make it happen). I know life can be so tough. And you feel like giving up. But you must be strong. Baby just hold on. You'll never find the answers. if you throw your life away. I used to feel the way you do. Still I have to keep going. Never knowing if I could take it. If I would make it through the night. I held on to my faith. I struggled and I prayed. And now I've finally found my way. Chorus. If you believe in yourself enough. And know what you want. You're gonna make it happen. (Make it happen). And if you get down on your knees at night. And pray to the lord. He's gonna make it happen. (Make it happen). I once was lost. But now I'm found. I got my feet on solid ground. Thank you Lord. If you believe within your soul. Just hold on tight. And don't let go. You can make it happen. (Make it happen)

me. i am mariah...the elusive chanteuse,"On the back cover of this album is a personal treasure. This is my first and only self-portrait. I drew it when I was three and a half and entitled it, ""Me. I Am Mariah. "". Please don't judge me for such a simplistic title. Come on, I was only three and a half. It was a creative visualisation of how I saw myself. With the purity of a child's heart before it was ever broken. I've kept this drawing private for so long. But because this album is a reflection of some of the peaks and valleys that have made me who I am today. I've decided to share it with those of you who actually care. And have been here for me through it all. I've been through a lot, but I've always known me. I am Mariah. Along the way there have been a couple of nicknames. And I've inadvertently embodied many personas. Lately, they've been calling me, ""The Elusive Chanteuse"""
melt away,"You come to me with a casual flow. And suddenly my defenses start to go. When you talk to me in that sensual tone. It envelopes me and I lose my self control. And baby I just melt away. Fall like rain. Everytime I see your face, I go off. I just wanna break it down. Anytime you come around. Maybe I could melt away in your arms. Imagining that you're taking it slow. And so tenderly. 'Til the feeling overflows. When you look at me I go soft and cave in. And I can't conceal that I'm slowly weakening. And baby I just melt away. Fall like rain. Everytime I see your face, I go off. I just wanna break it down. Anytime you come around. Maybe I could melt away in your arms. You and me in a cloud of reverie. Spin around inside my head unendingly. Throughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize. Paint pretty pictures of what I'd do if you were mine. And baby I just melt away. Fall like rain. Everytime I see your face, I go off. I just wanna break it down. Anytime you come around. Maybe I could melt away in your arms."

mine again,"Verse 1. I remember when you used to be mine. Way back when. I was too naïve to love you right. But now if I only had the opportunity. I would do anything. Because my heart still believes. Chorus 1. Maybe you could be mine again. Maybe we could make that dream for real. Like way back then. When love was yours and mine. Maybe we could bring it back to life. Verse 2. It's irrelevant to dwell on the past. I'm accountable for what went bad. And I mean that. But I keep on praying for another chance. Just to have you back. Cause I've grown. And I know how to be your everything. Chorus 2. Maybe you could be mine again. Maybe we could make that dream for real. Like way back then. When love was yours and mine. Maybe we could bring it back to life. Bridge. No, no it ain't over yet. I just can't accept the possibility. We were made for each other's arms. I know you're my destiny. We can't erase what was meant to be. Part of you and part of me. If we try one more time. Maybe somehow we'll survive. Outro. Maybe you could be mine again. Maybe we could make that dream for real. Like way back then. When love was yours and mine. Boy maybe we could bring it back. Maybe we could bring it back. Maybe we could bring it back to.... Life.

miss you most (at christmas time),"The fire is burning. The room's all aglow. Outside the December wind blows. Away in the distance the carolers sing in the snow. Everybody's laughing. The world is celebrating. And everyone's so happy. Except for me tonight. Because I miss you. Most at Christmas time. And I can't get you. Get you off my mind. Every other season comes along. And I'm all right. But then I miss you, most at Christmas time. I gaze out the window. This cold winter's night. At all of the twinkling lights. Alone in the darkness. Remembering when you were mine. Everybody's smiling. The whole world is rejoicing. And everyone's embracing. Except for you and I. Baby I miss you. Most at Christmas time. And I can't get you. Get you off my mind. Every other season comes along. And I'm all right. But then I miss you, most at Christmas time. In the springtime those memories start to fade. With the April rain. Through the summer days. Till autumn's leaves are gone. I get by without you. Till the snow begins to fall. And then I miss you. Most at Christmas time. And I can't get you. Get you off my mind. Every other season comes along. And I'm all right...."
misty moon,"I see fields of golden flowers,. Shine in the evening Sun,. Above are misty mountains,. It's so beautiful. As the wind caresses my eyes,. Gazing gently at the sky,. The Moon inside a halo,. It's so beautiful. When I think of all the beauty,. That nature gives to me,. From the flowers to the mountains,. It's so beautiful. There's glory and a wonder,. Far wider than the sea,. I say yes to all this loveliness. It's so beautiful. (Humming)"

Yet in thy dark streets shineth. The ever lasting light. The hopes and fears of all the years. Are met in thee tonight.. For Christ is born of Mary. And gathered all above. While mortals sleep, the angels keep. Their watch of wandering love.. O morning stars, together. Proclaim the holy birth. And praises sing, to God, the King. And peace to men on earth.. O, Holy Child of Bethlehem. Descend to us, we pray. Cast out our sin and enter in. Be born in us today.. We hear the Christmas angels. The great glad tidings tell. O come to us, abide with us.

one and only (feat. twista),"[intro]. I'm lookin' for my one and only. Every time I turn around. I find my heart in pieces on the ground. So, so lonely. I'm lookin' for my one and only. I'm riding home in pain again, baby. But that don't mean sh*t to you. You're currently engaged. In an intimate conversation. With a young groupie or two. They say ""Players only love you. When they're playing games"". Still, I gave my heart to you. I should have stayed away. Like my friends all told me to. [chorus]. Every time I turn around. I find my heart in pieces on the ground. So, so lonely. I'm lookin' for my one and only. Every time I turn around. I find my heart in pieces on the ground. Why can't I find my one and only. See, I'm looking for a man that'll rub me slow. Make me sing real high. When he goes down low. But see, it ain't just a physical thing. He's gotta treat me affectionately. And I gotta know he won't betray my trust. Just like every other motherf*cker does. Is this just an impossible dream, baby. Too elusive to pursue. It's been such a sad and windy road for me. Just searchin' for the truth. [chorus]. Every time I turn around. I find my heart in pieces on the ground. So, so lonely. I'm lookin' for my one and only. Every time I turn around. I find my heart in pieces on the ground. Why can't I find my one and only. [Twista]. Now you know I roll a Beamer and a Benz. And I'm dishin' out N's. While you trippin' on a playa. Baller, havin' bitter conversations. While we're rollin' on 24's. And I know you got doubts. Why you listen to what people talk about. You ain't figured out why they call ya. The heavy steady hatin' cause. You rollin' on 24's. See how your money flows. You dress in designer clothes. From head to the toe. You ain't satisfied, well tell me. What you lookin for. [Mariah]. I'm lookin' for my one and only. [Twista]. Well, I'll be your one and only. If you give me a chance. I'll make the change for you, girl. I know I ain't been the most faithful. Nigga in the world. But let's stay together so we can shine like pearls. Spendin' it to awhile I feel us wish. You on fire. To kiss your lips, I desire. Twist and Mariah, together like a. Grip on the tire. [Mariah]. I'm lookin' for my one and only. [Twista]. Well, come on Shorty, let me make it better. We can do whatever. While we're sittin on suede and leather. Thinkin' through the city. While we rollin' lonely. Let's kick it in the Chi. I know I messed up with ya, I ain't gon' lie. I know you were feelin'. You really know your guy. But baby girl, I ain't mean to blow your high. Let me pick the pieces up. And put them back together cause I wanna be with you. Don't wanna leave you lonely. Ride with you like a homey, never, no phony. Shorty, can I be your one and only. [chorus]. Every time, oh mmm. Every time I turn around. I find my heart in pieces on the ground. So, so loney. Why. I'm looking for my one and only. Every time I turn around. Ah, ha ha ha ha. I find my heart in pieces on the ground. Why can't I find my one and only. Still lookin' for my one and only. Every time I turn around. Ah, ha ha ha ha. I find my heart in pieces on the ground. So, so lonely. Yeah, I'm lookin' for my one and only. I'm lookin' for my one and only. Every time I turn around. Ah, ha ha ha ha. I find my heart in pieces on the ground. I'm lookin' for my one and only. Why can't I find my one and only. Ah"
one child,"An angel appeared. Of the Highest One. And Mary believed. The word she received. Of God’s only Son. The Virgin rejoiced. Gave thanks to the Lord. And as Joseph dreamt. The angel was sent.

But God kept them safe. From hurt, harm and danger. In His warm embrace. Away in a manger. Waiting for Jesus’ birth. To glorify the earth. Then He came…. One Child. Can change the world. Christmas morn. The King of all Kings was born. He reigns forever more. Let us worship and adore. Christ the Lord. Oh a wondrous star. Led shepherds and wisemen. Through valleys and mountains. Angels surrounded them. As they traveled far. As heaven and hope. Rang out for the savior. The sweet Prince of peace. Lay majestically. Asleep glorious and pure. And His mercy endures. For always…. One Child. Can change the world. Christmas morn. The King of all Kings was born. He reigns forever more. Let us worship and adore. Christ the Lord. One Child. Can change the world. Christmas morn.

open arms,Lying beside you. Here in the dark. Feeling your heartbeat with mine. Softly you whisper. You're so sincere. How could our love be so blind?. We sailed on together. We drifted apart. And here you are by my side. (Chorus). So now I come to you. With open arms. Nothing to hide. Believe what I say. So here I am. With open arms. Hoping you'll see what your love means to me. Open arms .... Living without you. Living alone. This empty house seems so cold. Wanting to hold you. Wanting you near. How much I wanted you home. But now that you've come back. Turned night into day. I need you to stay. So now I come to you. With open arms. Nothing to hide. Believe what I say. So here I am. With open arms. Hoping you'll see what your love means to me. Open arms.
outside,"It's hard to explain. Inherently it's just always been strange. Neither here nor there --. always somewhat out of place everywhere. Ambiguous --. without a sense of belonging to touch. Somewhere halfway --. feeling there's no one completely the same. Chorus:. Standing alone --. eager to just. believe it's good enough to be what. you really are. But in your heart. uncertainty forever lies. and you'll always be. somewhere on the. outside. Early on, you face. the realization you don't. have a space. where you fit in. And recognize. you were born to exist. Chorus (1x). And it's hard. And it's hard. And it's hard. Irreversibility. Falling in between. And it's hard. And it's hard. to be understood. as you are. As you are. Oh, and God knows. that you're standing on your own --. blind and unguided. Into a world divided. you're thrown. Where you're never quite the same. although you try -- try and try. to tell yourself. you really are. But in your heart -- uncertainty forever lies. and you'll always be. somewhere on the outside. You'll always be. somewhere on the outside."
petals,"I've often wondered if there's. Ever been a perfect family. I've always longed for undividedness. And sought stability. A flower taught me how to pray. But as I grew that flower changed. She started flailing in the wind. Like golden petals scattering. . And I miss you dandelion. And even love you. And I wish there was a way. For me to trust you. But it hurts me everytime. I try to touch you. But I miss you dandelion. And even love you. I gravitated towards a patriarch. So young predictably. I was resigned to spend my life. Within a maze of misery. A boy and a girl befriended me. We're bonded through despondency. I stayed so long but finally. I fled to save my sanity. . And I miss you little sis and. Little brother. And I hope you realize. I'll always love you. And although you're struggling. You will recover. And I miss you little sis and. Little brother. So many I considered. Closest to me. Turned on a dime and sold me. Out dutifully. Although that knife was chipping away at me. They turned their eyes away and. Went home to sleep. . And I missed a lot of life. But I'll recover. Though I know you really like. To see me suffer. Still I wish that you and I'd. Forgive each other. 'Cause I miss you, Valentine. And really loved you. I really loved you-. I tried so hard. But you drove me away. To preserve my sanity-. And I found the strength. To break away. Fly..."
portrait,"Where do I go from here?. How do I disappear?. Here beyond the looking glass. Somewhere off the beaten path. Heart ache never seems to pass, just lasts. And I'd go. Yet I know that tomorrow comes. So I'll be here when you rise. Stay real close and the moment will subside. Look the other way. as I bottle myself up inside. I won't let the teardrops spill tonight. Just conceal myself and hide. A portrait of my life. La da da da da. La da da da da. Somewhat desensitized. Still the same hopeful child. Haunted by those severed ties. Pushing past the parasites. Down but not demoralized. Unconfined, but don't let go. Yes I know that tomorrow comes. so I'll be here when you rise. Stay here close and the moment will subside. Look the other way. as I bottle myself up inside. I won't let the teardrops spill tonight. Just conceal myself and hide. A portrait of my life. And for the finale. she can float around effortlessly. And dream away the hours in her mind. And I'd let go. Yet I know that tomorrow comes. So I'll be here when you rise. Stay here close and the moment will subside. Look the other way. as I bottle myself up inside. I won't let the teardrops spill tonight. Just conceal myself and hide. This portrait of my life"
prisoner,Here comes the night. No more living in the shadow of your love. This is my life. You always tried so hard to keep me down. But now I'll rise above. Those empty lies. Stop pretending that my accusations. Take you by surprise. I've realized. Now I'm ending all the secrecy. I see through your disguise. Chorus. All the dreams we planned. I believed so I held on. I understand. So when the morning comes. You know that I'll be gone. You don't think that I'll be strong enough. I won't be a prisoner of your love. No longer blind. I can focus on deception. Used to keep me by your side. I read your mind. Don't believe it's all a mystery. There's nothing you can hide. It's all defined. There's nothing you can tell me now. To change the way I feel inside. Chorus. All the dreams we planned. I believed so I held on. I understand. So when the morning comes. You know that I'll be gone. You don't think that I'll be strong enough. I won't be prisoner of your love. I'm just not the girl you thought I was. I won't be a prisoner of your love
rainbow (interlude),I know there is a rainbow. For me to follow. To get beyond my sorrow. Thunder precedes the sunlight. So I'll be alright. If I can find that. Rainbows end. I will be alright. If I can find that. Rainbows end.
reflections,Reflections of your love have come to wither. I thought I'd done my best to memorize. A picture face of you and I together. I haven't come to terms with how we said goodbye. Did you really care. Care at all for me. Did you really care. Did you care at all for me. A displaced little girl wept years in silence. And whispered wishes you'd materialize. She pressed on night and day to keep on living. And tried so many ways to keep her soul alive. Did you really care. Care enough for me. Did you really care. Did you care at all for me. If I'm not quite good enough. Or somehow undeserving of. A mother's love. You could've had the decency to give me up. Before you gave me life. Don't you even care. Just the slightest little bit for me. Cause I really need to feel you care. Even once upon a time for me. I need to believe. In my heart of heart of hearts. You cared for me. I need to understand. Why you left me there so helplessly. Don't you even care. Care at all for me. Oh.... Reflections of your love have come to wither. I thought I'd done my best to memorize

right to dream,I lay awake sometimes. Scared to close my eyes. And I wonder where I left myself. I lost the will to fly. And the night melts into morning. Still it's cold beneath the sun. 'Cause the fire in me's languishing. And I'm too frozen to run. Every once in a while. There's a distant glimmer of hope. I find somewhere deep inside. Someone strong still resides. And I know she's gonna be fine in time. 'Cause you see. I've got a lot to dream. There's more than this for me. An angel lands with broken wings. Warms me with his eyes. And the ice that sheaths around my heart. Unravel as he smiles. See I grew up locked in sorrow. So I learned to block the pain. But I won't give up tomorrow. 'Cause I've come to life again. Every once in a while. There's a distant glimmer of hope I find. Somewhere deep inside. Someone strong still resides. And I know I'm gonna be fine that's right. 'Cause for real. I've got a right to dream. There's more than this for me. But I keep on going 'cause. Every once in a while. There's a distant glimmer of hope I find. Somewhere deep inside. Someone strong still resides. And I know she's gonna be fine in time. 'Cause you see. I've got a right to dream. There's more than this for me

sent from up above,I can't imagine. Looking in someone else's eyes. What we have surpasses. Even paradise. It's hard to fathom. Reaching for someone else's hand. What we share is magic. Heaven had a plan. Sent from up above. So much love. In my life. I can't get enough. Of your touch - feels so right. Unending passion. Somehow the fire never dies. What we share. Is everlasting. Love without demise. He made it happen. Placed so much joy into our hands. What we dreamed. We finally captured. Heaven took command. Sent from up above. So much love. In my life. I can't get enough. Of your touch - feels so right

See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes. Just ask your momma she knows. You're gonna miss me baby. Hate to say ""I told you so"". Well at first I didn't know. But now it's clear to me. You would cheat with all your freaks. And lie compulsively. So I packed up my Louis Vuiton. Jumped in your ride and took off. You'll never ever find a girl. Who loves you more than me. Chorus 2.

side effects (feat. young jeezy),I was a girl. You was a man. I was too young. To understand. I was naive. I just believed. Everything that you told me. Said you were strong. Protecting me. Then I found out. That you were weak. Keeping me there. Under your thumb. Cause you were scared. That I'd become. Much more than you could handle. Shining like a chandelier. That decorated every room. Inside the private Hell we built. And I dealt with it. Like a kid I wished. I could fly away. But instead. I kept my tears inside. Cause I knew if I started. I'd keep crying for the rest. Of my life with you. I finally built up the strength. To walk away. Don't regret it. But I still live with the. Side effects. Waking up scared some nights. Still dreaming about them violent times. Still a little protective. About the people that I let inside. Still a little defensive. Thinking folk be trying to run my life. Still a little bit depressed inside. I fake a smile. And deal with the side effects. Side effects. Side effects. Side effects. Side effects. Thinking inside. No-one was there. Couldn't be real. Had to keep quiet. Once in a while. Put up a fight. It's just too much. Night after night. After awhile I would just lie. You was dead wrong. Said you was right. Did what I could. Just to survive. Couldn't believe. This was my life. Flickering like a candle. Doing my best to handle. Sleeping with the enemy. Aware that he was smothering. Every last part of me. So I broke away. And finally found the strength. To be me. I kept my tears inside. Cause I knew if I started. I'd keep crying for the rest. Of my life with you. I finally built up the strength. To walk away. Don't regret it. But I still live with the. Side effects. Waking up scared some nights. Still dreaming about them violent times. Still a little protective. About the people that I let inside. Still a little defensive. Thinking folk be trying to run my life. Still a little bit depressed inside. I fake a smile. Side effects. Side effects. Side effects. Side effects. Forgive but I can't forget. Every day I'm filled with this. I live with the side effects. But I ain't gonna let. Them get the best of me

The lake of the clouds. I'm picturing you and me there right now. As the crystal cascades showered down. Strange to feel that proud, strong man. Grip tightly to my hand. Hard to see the life inside. Wane as the days went by. Trying to preserve each word. He murmered in my ear. Watch part of my life disappear. Father, thanks for reaching out and lovingly. Saying that you've always been proud of me. I needed to feel that so desperately. You're always alive inside of me. Now you're shining like. A sunflower up in the sky. Way up high"

Completed my whole life. Make it last forever baby. Thank God I found you. Make it last"
thanx 4 nothin',"I can't even know what to say. I've been hurt. I've been played. And I'm so ashamed. I can't even cry it's that deep. You just lie and you cheat. Like it's nothing. See you said that. You loved me too. And so I trusted you. But I guess that subconsciously I knew. But I never would've faced the truth. That I was only being used. And you was just frontin'. Ay, boy. Thanks for nothig. I never knew enough about you baby. And I guess I only have myself to blame. Now I'm broken hearted and shattering. You were just playing a game. Nothing anyone could do to convince me baby. I was living in a lie. Just a masquerade. Now I only know that I'll never be the same. But you were just playing a game. Every day and every night. I stay by the phone. Never go no place. So just in case you call I'll be home. Seems like all I do is think about. Our pseudo-romance. While you're somewhere. Burnin' diesel in the streets. Havin' laughs. Somebody say. You know what I'm going through. You were left with nothing too. What you can't count on one hand. Singing three, four, five, six. Seven days a week. You're drowning in tears. He was so insincere. Now you're laying up in bed every night. Singing ay boy. Thanx for nothin'. I never knew enough about you babe. And I guess I only have myself to blame. Now I'm broken hearted and shattering. You were just playing a game. Nothing anyone could do to convince me babe. I was living in a lie. Just a masquerade. Now I only know that I'll never be the same. But you were just playing a game"
the art of letting go,"I'm making a statement of my own opinion. Just a brief little reminder to help myself remember. I no longer live in your dominion. No no no no no. You're just trifling, nothing more than a liability. Gotta lay all your possessions. Outside the kitchen window right now. Letting go. Letting go ain't easy. It's just exceedingly hurtful. Somebody you used to know. Is flinging your world around. And they watch as you're falling down, down. Down, falling down, baby. Evidently your words were merely lies. Reverberating in my ears. And the echo won't subside. There's deep deep loss of hope. And the anger burns in me. I hope you don't get no ideas 'bout re-uniting baby. 'Cause that's the last thing I truly need. Your audacity is too much to be believed, so. Go to MiMi on your contacts, press delete. Letting go ain't easy. Oh, it's just exceedingly hurtful. 'Cause somebody you used to know. It's flinging your world around. And they watch, as you're falling down, down. Falling down, baby. Baybe letting go, baby letting go. Ain't easy, easy. Baby letting go, baby letting go (woah). Ain't easy, Ain't easy. Baby letting go, it ain't easy. 'Cause somebody you used to know. It's flinging your world around. And you know what?. They watch as you're falling. As you're falling down, fall. It ain't easy baby"

the roof,It wasn't raining yet. But it was definitely a little misty on. That warm november night. And my heart was pounding. My inner voice resounding. Begging me to turn away. But I just had to see your face. To feel alive. And then you casually walked in the room. And I was twisted in the web. Of my desire for you. (And I was twisted). My apprehension blew away. I only wanted you. To taste my sadness. As you kissed me in the dark. Refrão:. Every time I feel the need. I envision you caressing me. And go back in time. To relieve the splendor of you and I. On the rooftop that rainy night. Verse. And so we finished the Moet and. started feeling liberated. And I surrendered as you took me. In your arms. I was so caught up in the moment. I couldn't bear to let you go yet. So I threw caution to the wind. And started listening to my longing heart. And then you softly pressed your lips to mine. And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed. For such a long time. (And I was lifted). And for a while I forgot. The sorrow and the pain. And melted with you as we stood. There in the rain. Refrão. Last night I dreamed that I. Whispered the words I love you. And touched you so very. Subtly as we were kissing goodbye. (Pretty baby - How I'm missing you). Refrão. Every time I feel the need. (Last nigth I had the strangest dream...). I envision you caressing me. (I was actually quite symbolic). And go back in time. (As I whispered...That I loved you). To relieve the splendor of you and I. (...very subtly).
the star,"One dark night. Something said, ""Follow the light"". So you look up and see the word. That's written upon the sky. Strong and wise. Keeping the Lord as your guide. And through the doubt, you realize. He's with you all the while. Follow that star above you. Should the world try to break you down. There is one who waits for you. Though you can't see him now. Thunder and rain surrounds you. But His love's just a breath away. If you follow your heart, follow the light. Follow that... star (Follow your heart, it's Christmas). (Follow your heart, it's Christmas). Shining bright. The spirit of love at first sight. And when the door won't welcome you. Heaven will help you inside. Gathered 'round. Bearing the gifts to the crown. A miracle comes, the babe is born. And angels are heard on high. Follow that star above you. Should the world try to break you down. There is one who waits for you. Though you can't see him now. Thunder and rain surrounds you. But His love's just a breath away. If you follow your heart, follow the light. Follow that... star (Follow your heart, it's Christmas). (Follow your heart, it's Christmas). Follow that voice you heard that no one else believed. Follow the dream that brought the King on Christmas Eve. Follow that star above you. Should the world try to break you down. There is one who waits for you. Though you can't see him now. Thunder and rain surrounds you. But His love's just a breath away. If you follow the voice, follow the song. Follow the word that makes you strong. Follow your heart, follow the light. Follow that... star (Follow your heart, it's Christmas).

the wind,The wind has taken you. You're free finally at peace. So still you lie. Leaving your cares behind. The pain is gone. Gone with the spirit in your eyes. Now you're wandering around. Above us. Looking downward. As we cry. You've flown into the wind. Escaping all the hurt within. Took to the sky. Leaving the world behind. So young to die. How could you let it all pass you by. And to the wind go so many dreams. That you had inside. Now you're just a memory. Burning in my mind. So young to die. How could you let life pass you by. And now you'll never know I loved you. And now you'll never know I cared. I really loved you. And now you'll never know. You'll only fade. Into the wind.
there for me,I'd never have known. The way it feels to love. Without the love. You showered. Down upon me. Warm. Warm as the sun. Melting away the rain. Giving me strenght. To face another morning.

Someone more there for me. There for me. And I'm never alone. Cause in my heart I know. You're always there for me. There for me. I. I won't let go. Of precious memories. They are the light of hope.

That I'm strong enough to mend. And every time I feel afraid. I hold tight to my faith. And I live one more day. And I make it through the rain. And if you keep falling down. Don't you dare give in. You will arise safe and sound. So keep pressing on steadfastly. And you'll find what you need to prevail. Once you say. I can make it through the rain. I can stand up once again. On my own and I know. That I'm strong enough to mend. And every time I feel afraid. I hold tight to my faith. And I live one more day. And I make it through the rain. And when the wind blows. And shadows grow close. Don't be afraid. There's nothing you can't face. And should they tell you. You'll never pull through. Don't hesitate. Stand tall and say. I can make it through the rain.

underneath the stars,"One summer night, we ran away for a while. Laughing we hurried beneath the sky. To an obscure place to hide. That no one could find. And we drifted to another state of mind.

Weak in the knees, wrapped in the warm, gentle breeze. I, so shy, a bundle of butterflies. Flushed with the heat of desire. On a natural high. As we drifted to another place of time. And the feeling was so heady and sublime. As I lost my heart to you there in the dark. Underneath the stars, (ooh, woah). Young love. Beautiful and bittersweetly. You were fading into me and. I was gently fading into you. But the time went sailing by. Reluctantly we said goodbye. And we left our secret place so far behind. And I lay in bed all night and I was. Drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting. And I was yours. And you were my own. My own baby. As we lay. As we.... Lay underneath the stars"

when do the bells ring for me,"I wonder when do the bells ring for me. When someone tugs a heartstring for me?. When does it come my time?. When does the poem rhyme?. When do the songs they sing, sing for me?. To those who say ""Hey, wake up and feel life"". I say ""I'm ready, just show me the way"". Show me those arms that say ""Welcome to real life"". And we'll stay, we'll stay. How many parties more can I run to?. How many little loves can there be. Before it's all a bore?. Forget it, I want more. I want someone who wants want more of me. Like making promises good in the daylight. The thing is here am I, where is she?. When is it my chance?. When is it my dance. When do the bells ring for me?"
when i saw you,"Soft heavenly eyes gazed into me. Transcending space and time. And I was rendered still. There were no words for me to find at all. As I stood there beside myself. I could see you and no one else. When I saw you. When I saw you. I could not breathe, I fell so deep. When I saw you. When I saw you. I'd never be, I'd never be the same again. Only once in a lifetime love rushes in. Changing you with the tide. And dawn's ribbon of light. Bursts through the dark. Wakening you inside. And I thought it was all untrue. Untill there all at once I knew. When I saw you. When I saw you. I could not breathe, I fell so deep. When I saw you. When I saw you. I'd never be, I'd never be the same. With no beginning and. Without an end. You are the one for me. It's evident. And your eyes told me so. Your eyes let me know.... When I saw you. When I saw you. I could not breathe, I fell so deep. When I saw you. When I saw you. I'd never be, I'd never be the same...."
when you believe (feat. whitney houston),"Whitney. Many nights we prayed. with no proof anyone could hear. In our hearts a hopeful song,. we barely understood.

Though hope is frail, It's hard to kill. Who knows what miracles, you can achieve. When you believe, somehow you will. You will when you believe. Mariah. In this time of fear. when prayer so often proves in vain. Hope seems like the summer birds. too swiftly flown away. Yet now I'm standing here. my heart so full I can't explain. Seeking faith and speaking words. I'd never thought I'd say. There can be miracles, When you believe. (When you believe). Though hope is frail, It's hard to kill. Who knows what miracles, You can achieve. (You can achieve). When you believe, somehow you will. You will when you believe. They don't always happen when you ask. And it's easy to give into your fear. But when you're blinded by your pain. Can't see you way clear through the rain. A small but still resilient voice. Says help is very near. There can be miracles (miracles). When you believe (When you believe). Though hope is frail it's hard to kill. Who knows what miracles. You can achieve (You can achieve). When you believe.
