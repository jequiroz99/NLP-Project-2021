a beautiful night in oslo,"Okidoki Peeps, I’m gonna tell you something that happened a while ago while we were in Oslo. We were touring the Scandinavian with the Pipettes from the United Kingdom. And actually we fell in love with that band and I know that they fell in love with us too. So if you wanna hear a true on the road story about Billie the Vision and the Pipettes… just turn it up now, just turn it up now.. I thought I was supposed to run away with you, but I’m running away with Joe. We’re in Oslo and we did a terrible show, but the Norwegian pop freaks went “Hey hey ho”. And Joe said “let’s get the priorities straight” and I said “No, let’s get the priorities queer”. And we laughed together and said “It’s good to be here, but now we need to get the booze and the beers”.. So we went running through the streets of Oslo. We had the beers and the booze in the Billie bus, but we’d forgotten where we parked it. And Joe said “Jesus Christ Billie guys – you must learn to organise!” And I said “I’m sorry Joe, I’m really sorry. But we didn’t do this on purpose”. We started laughing together there were Gustav and Joe and me and we started laughing together.. We went laughing through the streets of Oslo. I was so full of sweat, I was stinking, I was thinking I don’t even feel like drinking. As we search through the biggest parking in Norway Gustav lit up and pointed his finger and said “You are George, I am Kramer and you are Elaine. We’re in an episode of Seinfeld! We’re in an episode of Seinfeld”. We had ten minutes to get to the venue again and I can’t believe that we made it.. Joe said “listen now guys when they ask you what you got in your bag just say sleeping bags and pillows ok? You must do this on your own. You can make it, so see you guys inside”. And of course we made it – we’re professional liars – everything according to plan. We felt like heroes when we stepped in to the dressing room. I said “I’m gonna show you one heavy sleeping bag”. Then I blinked to Gustav and Gustav blinked back to me and then I showed them all the bears.. We felt like heroes at a venue in Oslo. Becky, Mia, Rose, Sebastian, John, Gwenno, Lisa, Mono, Fia, Bobby and Andy said “That’s nice guys but we need to go to sleep, so see you guys tomorrow”. We were a bit surprised, and disappointed. But there were four of us left, Gustav, Joe, John and me and we had a beautiful night in Oslo.. We had a beautiful night in Oslo. We stayed up late at a venue in Oslo. We got drunk at a venue in Oslo."

I would do it all again, I would do it all again. I seek a stronger word than love. I seek a stronger word than love. I seek a stronger word than love. To express how I feel for you. (Feel for you, how I feel for you). (Feel for you, how I feel for you). I never knew where love would take me. Which of my friends, who would forsake me?. My skin is hard enough to frequent attacks. My skin is hard enough to several a set back. I seek a stronger word than love. I seek a stronger word than love. I seek a stronger word than love. To express how I feel for you. (Feel for you, how I feel for you). (Feel for you, how I feel for you). I've found the will now, (I've found the will). I've found the will now, (I've found the will). I've found the will now, (I've found the will). And I've found the will now, I've found the will. Oh and I seek a stronger word than love. I seek a stronger word than love. I seek a stronger word than love. To express how I feel for you. (Feel for you, how I feel for you). (Feel for you, how I feel for you). (Feel for you, how I feel for you).

vamos a besarnos,"I said ”can somebody set me soul on fire?” But somebody set my home on fire. The flames and the smoke laughed right in my face, the insurance company laughed at me too. Alanis yes I know what’s ironic, Alanis yes I do. Somebody stole my naive kind of lifestyle, somebody stole what was left to steal. I need plenty of kisses and a hole bunch of love.. So come kiss me and hug me come kiss me again. Come close and embrace me. Come lift me and throw me right up in the air, come rock me to harmony. Vamos a besarnos amigos.. Now P.D got hurt. P.D couldn’t pay so they beat him up and they took his receipts from the Jack Vegas machine. He said “pain is no longer my enemy and I’m not afraid of pain no more. But hey relaxation are you running from me, hey hey relaxation are you hiding from me? Can somebody tell me where to find relaxation. I've looked from my basement and down to the station. Feels like 2000 Swedish miles away. Would you consider to come to me if I told you I needed you to come to me tonight?”. So come kiss me and hug me come kiss me again. Come close and embrace me. Come lift me and throw me right up in the air, come rock me to harmony. Vamos a besarnos amigos. I need plenty of kisses and a hole bunch of love. So come kiss me..."
