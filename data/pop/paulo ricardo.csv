beautiful girl,Nicky's in the corner. With a black coat on. Running from a bad home. With some cat inside. Now where did you find her. Among the neon lights. That haunt the streets outside. She says. Stay with me. Beautiful girl. Stay with me. Beautiful girl. Stay with me. She wants to go home. From doorway to doorway. Street corner to corner. With the neon ghosts in the city. And she says. Stay with me (4x). She's so scared. So very frightened. Anything could happen. Right here tonight. by bia_sr ^^
"london, london","I'm wandering round and round, nowhere to go. I'm lonely in London, London, is lovely so. I cross the streets without fear, everybody keeps the way clear. I know there's no one here to say hello. I know they keep the way clear. I am lonely in London without fear. I'm wandering round and round, nowhere to go. While my eyes, go looking for flying saucers in the sky. Yes my eyes, go looking for flying saucers in the sky. Oh, sunday, monday, autumn pass by me. And people hurry on so peacefully. A group approach the policeman,. He seems so pleased to please them. It's good to live at least and I agree. He seemed so pleased at least. And it's so good to live in peace. And Sunday, Monday years and I agree. (Chorus). I choose no face to look at, choose no way. I just happen to be here and it's ok. Green grass, blue eyes, gray sky. God bless, silent pain and happiness. I came around to say yes, and I say. Green grass, blue eyes, gray sky. God bless, silent pain and happiness. I came around to say yes, and I say. (Chorus x3)"

careless whispers,"I feel so unsure. as I take your hand and lead to the dance floor. as the music dies, something in your eyes. calls to mind the silver screen. and all its sad good-byes. I'm never gonna dance again. guilty feet have got no rhythm. though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. and waste the chance that I've been given. so I'm never gonna dance again. the way I danced with you. Time can never mend. the careless whispers of a good friend. to the heart and mind. ignorance is kind. there's no comfort in the truth. pain is all you'll find. I'm never gonna dance again. guilty feet have got no rhythm. though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. and waste this chance that I've been given. so I'm never gonna dance again. the way I danced with you. Never without your love. Tonight the music seems so loud. I wish that we could lose this crowd. Maybe it's better this way. We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say. We could have been so good together. We could have lived this dance forever. But now whose gonna dance with me. Please stay. And I'm never gonna dance again. guilty feet have got no rhythm. though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. Should've known better than to cheat a friend. and waste the chance that I've been given. so I'm never gonna dance again. the way I danced with you. (Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone. (Now that you're gone) What I did's so wrong, so wrong. that you had to leave me alone"
crazy little thing called love,"This thing called love I just cant handle it. This thing called love I must get round to it. I aint ready. Crazy little thing called love. This (this thing) called love. (called love). It cries (like a baby). In a cradle all night. It swings (woo woo). It jives (woo woo). It shakes all over like a jelly fish. I kinda like it. Crazy little thing called love. There goes my baby. She knows how to rock n roll. She drives me crazy. She gives me hot and cold fever. Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat. I gotta be cool... relax. Get hip, Get on my tracks. Take a back seat, hitch-hike. And take a long ride on my motor bike. Until Im ready. Crazy little thing called love. I gotta be cool relax, get hip. Get on my tracks. Take a back seat, hitch-hike. And take a long ride on my motor bike. Until Im ready (ready freddie). Crazy little thing called love. This thing called love. I just cant handle it. This thing called love I must get round to it. I aint ready. Crazy little thing called love"
fire and rain,"Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone. Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you. I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song. I just can't remember who to send it to. I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end. I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend. But I always thought that I'd see you again. Won't you look down upon me, Jesus. You've got to help me make a stand. You've just got to see me through another day. My body's aching and my time is at hand. And I won't make it any other way. oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end. I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend. But I always thought that I'd see you again. I’ve been walking my mind to an easy time. My back turned towards the sun. Lord knows when the cold wind blows it’ll turn your head around. Well, there’s hours of time on the telephone line. To talk about things to come. Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground.. oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end. I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend. But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now. Thought I'd see you one more time again. There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now. Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now"
imagine (cover),Imagine there's no heaven. It's easy if you try. No hell bellow us. Above us only sky. Imagine all the people. Living for today. Imagine there's no countries. It isn't hard to do. Nothing to kill or die for. And no religion too. Imagine all the people. Living life in peace. You may say I'm a dreamer. But I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us. And the world will be as one. Imagine no possessions. I wonder if you can. No need for greed or hunger. A brotherhood of man. Imagine all the people. Sharing all the world. You may say I'm a dreamer. But I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us. And the world live as one. And the world live as one. And the world live as one
is this love,"I wanna love you and treat you right. I wanna love you every day and every night. We'll be together with a roof right over our heads. We'll share the shelter of my single bed. We'll share the same room, yeah, oh jah provide the. bread. Is this love, is this love, is this love. Is this love that I'm feeling?. Is this love, is this love, is this love. Is this love that I'm feeling?. I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know now. I got to know, got to know, got to know now. I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm willing and able. so I throw my cards on your table"
isn't she lovely,"Isn't she lovely. Isn't she wonderfull. Isn't she precious. Less than one minute old. I never thought through love we'd be. Making one as lovely as she. But isn't she lovely made from love. Isn't she pretty. Truly the angel's best. Boy, I'm so happy. We have been heaven blessed. I can't believe what God has done. through us he's given life to one. But isn't she lovely made from love. Isn't she lovely. Life and love are the same. Life is Aisha. The meaning of her name. Londie, it could have not been done. Without you who conceived the one. That's so very lovely made from love."
jealous guy,I was dreaming of the past. and my heart was beating fast. I began to lose control. I began to lose control. I didnt mean to hurt you. I'm sorry that I made you cry. I didnt want to hurt you. I'm just a jealous guy. I was feeling insecure. You might not love me anymore. I was shivering inside. I was shivering inside. I didnt mean to hurt you. I'm sorry that I made you cry. I didnt want to hurt you. I'm just a jealous guy. (whistle). I didnt mean to hurt you. I'm sorry that I made you cry. I didnt want to hurt you. I'm just a jealous guy. I was trying to catch your eye. Thought the you was trying to hide. I was swallowing my pain. I was swallowing my pain. I didnt mean to hurt you. I'm sorry that I made you cry. I didnt want to hurt you. I'm just a jealous guy. watchout im just a jealous guy. lookout babe im just a jealous guy
like a rolling stone,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine. You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?. People'd call, say, ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall"". You thought they were all kiddin' you. You used to laugh about. Everybody that was hangin' out. Now you don't talk so loud. Now you don't seem so proud. About having to be scrounging for your next meal.. How does it feel. How does it feel. To be without a home. Like a complete unknown. Like a rolling stone?. You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely. But you know you only used to get juiced in it. And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street. And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it. You said you'd never compromise. With the mystery tramp, but now you realize. He's not selling any alibis. As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes. And ask him do you want to make a deal?. How does it feel. How does it feel. To be on your own. With no direction home. Like a complete unknown. Like a rolling stone?. You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns. When they all come down and did tricks for you. You never understood that it ain't no good. You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you. You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat. Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat. Ain't it hard when you discover that. He really wasn't where it's at. After he took from you everything he could steal.. How does it feel. How does it feel. To be on your own. With no direction home. Like a complete unknown. Like a rolling stone?. Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people. They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made. Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things. But you'd better lift your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe. You used to be so amused. At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used. Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse. When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose. You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.. How does it feel. How does it feel. To be on your own. With no direction home. Like a complete unknown. Like a rolling stone?"

my love,"And when I go away. I know my heart can stay with my love , its understood. Its in the hands of my love , and my love does it good. Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo , my love does it good. And when the cupboards bare. Ill still find something there with my love. Its understood , its everywhere with my love. And my love does it good. Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo , my love does it good.

"sitting, waiting, wishing","Well I was sitting, waiting, wishing. You believed in superstitions. Then maybe you'd see the signs. The Lord knows that this world is cruel. I ain't the Lord, no I'm just a fool. Learning lovin' somebody don't make them love you. Must I always be waiting, waiting on you. Must I always be playing, playing your fool. I sang your songs, I danced your dance. I gave your friends all a chance. But putting up with them. Wasn't worth never having you. Maybe you've been through this before. But it's my first time so please ignore. The next few lines cause they're directed at you. I can't always be waiting, waiting on you. I can't always be playing, playing your fool. I keep playing your part. But it's not my scene. Want this plot to twist. I've had enough mystery. Keep building it up. Then shooting me down. But I'm already down. Just wait a minute. Just sitting, waiting. Just wait a minute. Just sitting, waiting. Well, if I was in your position. I'd put down all my ammunition. I'd wonder why'd it taken me so long. But Lord knows that I'm not you. And if I was, I wouldn't be so cruel. Cause waitin' on love aint so easy to do. Must I always be waiting, waiting on you. Must I always be playing, playing your fool. No, I can't I always be waiting, waiting on you. I can't always be playing, playing your fool"
something,"Something in the way she moves. Attracts me like no other lover. Something in the way she woos me. I don't want to leave her now. You know I believe and how. Somewhere in the way she smiles. That I don't need no other lover. Something in her style that shows me. I don't want to leave her now. You know I believe and how. You're asking me will my love grow. I don't know, I don't know. You stick around and it may show. I don't know, I don't know. Something in the way she knows. All I have to do is think of her. Something in the things she shows me. I don't want to leave her now. You know I believe and how. (Thank you very much)"
tonight's the night,"Stay away from my window. Stay away from my backdoor too. Disconnect the telephone line. Relax baby and draw that blind. . Kick off your shoes, and sit right down. Loosen up that pretty French gown. Let me pour ya a good long drink. Ooh, baby don't you hesitate, 'cause. {Refrain}. Tonight's the night. It's gonna be alright. 'Cause I love you girl. Ain't nobody gonna stop us now. . C'mon, angel, my hearts on fire. Don't deny your man's desire. You'd be a fool to stop this tide. Spread your wings and let me come inside, 'cause. {Refrain}. Don't say a word, my virgin child. Just let your inhibitions run wild. The secret is about to unfold. Upstairs before the night's too old. {Refrain}"
wicked game,"The world was on fire and no one could save me but you.. It's strange what desire will make foolish people do.. I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you.. And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you.. No, I don't want to fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart). No, I don't want to fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart). With you (This world is only gonna break your heart). What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way.. What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you.. What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way.. What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you and,. I want to fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart). No, I want to fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart). With you.. The world was on fire and no one could save me but you.. It's strange what desire will make foolish people do.. I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you.. And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you,. No, I want to fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart). No, I want to fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart). With you (This world is only gonna break your heart). No, I... (This world is only gonna break your heart). (This world is only gonna break your heart). Nobody loves no one."
your song,"It's a little bit funny this feeling inside. I'm not one of those who can easily hide. I don't have much money but boy if I did. I'd buy a big house where we both could live. If I was a sculptor, but then again, no. Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show. I know it's not much but it's the best I can do. My gift is my song and this one's for you. And you can tell everybody this is your song. It may be quite simple but now that it's done. I hope you don't mind. I hope you don't mind that I put down in words. How wonderful life is while you're in the world. I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss. Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross. But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song. It's for people like you that keep it turned on. So excuse me forgetting but these things I do. You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue. Anyway the thing is what I really mean. Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen"
