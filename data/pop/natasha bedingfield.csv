the little things (feat. ne-yo),[Chorus - Natasha Bedingfield:]. Even though the little things matter the most. It's always the little things that go unnoticed. Even though the little things matter the most. It's always the little things that go unnoticed. Even though the little things matter the most. It's always the little things that go unnoticed. Even though the little things matter the most. It's always the little things that go unnoticed. [Verse 1 - Natasha Bedingfield:]. Saw it on a post it. Message that he wrote it. Said I hope you liked the. Dinner that I cooked. Marvin in the background. Candles that are burned down. His romantic gesture completely overlooked. All along the stairs. Petals of a rose. Leading to a bath. That had now gone cold. It wasn't until she laid down. And took a look around. Nowhere to be found. He wasn't there. Unappreciation. An all too familiar place. He'd been there for too long. And decided to escape. [Bridge:]. It's funny how you find. You're blind. Til what's right before your eyes. The little things hide behind. The trivial things larger inside. [Chorus]. [Verse 2 - Ne-Yo:]. ... a new day. Just another Tuesday. Up and to the usual. Brushing of his teeth. Walking down the stairs. Eyes fixed upon his neck tie. Honey where's my breakfast. As he takes his seat. He never looks up. Never showing love. Reading a newspaper. Like he normally does. Suddenly he wonders why. He's gotten no reply. Looks up and sees her letter lying there. Unappreciation. An all too familiar place. We've been here for too long. Me and the kids have gone away. [Bridge]. [Chorus]. [Natasha Bedingfield & Ne-Yo:]. You never miss it til it's gone. Til it's gone. Til it's gone. You never miss it til it's gone. Til it's gone. Til it's gone. You never miss it til it's gone. Til it's gone. Til it's gone. You never miss it til it's gone. Til it's gone. Til it's gone. [Chorus]
peace of me,"Standing still but still moving. Lying down but not resting. Breathing air, suffocating. All the while, I'm debating. Life was never what I thought. Never what I wanted it to be. Had a plan, couldn't follow. Had a dream, it was hollow. Everywhere felt like nowhere. Everything was so boring. Life was never what I wanted. Never what I thought. Until you came and turned it all around. Oh, you found the peace of me. It was missing; it was broken. You put soul into it. Oh, you found the whole of me. I was empty, now I'm better. All my peace is back together. Restless ways for a living. Fitting in 'cause I was driven. Saying yes when I meant no. Holding on, should've let go. I was scattered all around. Left shattered on the ground. You picked me up. All I wanted was a little bit of hope. Couldn't find it. You showed me something. That I never knew I owned. You put a light to it. Oh, you found the peace of me. It was missing; it was broken. You put soul into it. Oh, you found the whole of me. I was empty, now I'm better. 'Cause you pieced me back together. What a life, always tried. What a life, lived without you. Don't leave me, and I won't. Fall apart, I won't leave you. And it's cold and I'm blind. And I would and it feels good. What a waste on my mind. Everytime, all the time. Oh, you found the whole of me. It was missing; it was broken. You put soul into it. Oh, you found the whole of me. I was empty, now I'm better. 'Cause you pieced me back together"
(no more) what ifs (feat. eve),"All the could-be's buzzin' 'round. My mind a thousand-timely cloud. And now I can not see the sun. All the worries on my list. Rush like lamings off a cliff. I'm powerless to save even one. All my friends tell me I'm thinking too much. It's not over 'til it's over. Because today is trouble enough. Live tomorrow, 'til tomorrow. I'm not jinxing what could be. Second guessing what I see. There is you and there is me. No what if's. My crossing fingers knocking wood. 'cause worrying about we could. Spoil the moment when it's good. No more what ifs. Could-be's. One day's. If only's. That intro's looping on and on. Don't really get to feel the song. When it's only playing in my head. If I don't listen with my heart. Trust my instincts from the start. Then I'm as done, as done can get. So I'm not. I'm not jinxing what could be. Second guessing what I see. There is you and there is me. No what if's. My crossing fingers knocking wood. 'cause worrying about we could. Spoil the moment when it's good. No more what ifs. Could-be's. One day's. If only's. If the sky falls down. What if it don't work out. What if a black cat crosses my path. Does that mean you and me, we're not gonna last?. What if Mr Right turns out to be wrong?. What if there's no happy ending for this song. What if the one for me is the one that's she's with. When my heart feels love, or will my head believes it?. I'm thinking too much.. It's not over 'til it's over. 'cause today is trouble enough. Live tomorrow, 'til tomorrow. I'm not jinxing what could be. Second guessing what I see. There is you and there is me. No what if's.

again,"Hands over my head. Thinking what else could go wrong. Would have stayed in bed. How can the day be so long?. Never believed that things happen for a reason. But how this turned out removed all my doubts, so believe. That for you I'd do it all over again. Do it all over again. All I went through lead me to you. So I'd do it all over again for you. I missed the first train. Stood out in the rain all day, little did I know. When I caught the next train there you were to sweep me away. Guess that's what I waited for. Never believed that things happen for a reason. But how this turned out removed all my doubt, so believe. That for you I'd do it all over again. Do it all over again.

Only you got the magic. Only you got the key. To my heart, to my heart. Only you got the magic. Only you got the way to my heart. Even if we're the only one stand there.

freckles,"I used to care so much about what others think about. I almost didn't have a thought of my own. The slightest remark would make me embark on a journey of self doubt. But that was a while ago. This girl has got stronger. And if I knew then what I know now. I would have told myself. Don't worry any longer. It's ok. 'Cause a face without freckles is like a sky without the stars. Why waste a second not loving who you are. Those little imperfections make you. Beautiful, lovable, valuable. They show your personality inside your heart. Reflecting who you are. I wonder if I could trade my body with somebody else at magazines. Would the whole world fall at my feet. I felt unworthy. And would blame my failures on the ugliness I could see. When the mirror looked at me. Sometimes I still feel like a little girl. Who doesn't belong in her own world. But I'm getting better. I'm reminding myself. That a face without freckles is like a sky without the stars. Why waste a second not loving who you are. Those little imperfections make you. Beautiful, lovable, valuable. They show your personality inside your heart. Reflecting who you are. Who you are. Reflecting who you are. Reflecting who you are. 'Cause a face without freckles is like the sky without the stars.

lay down,"Speechless, but the answers in my mouth. Breathless, the emotions seeping out. Beyond my control. You spoke to my silence, and asked. Why so cold?. . You ask for peace, I give you war. While you let go, I hold too tightly. I take my aim, you hit the floor,. I'm not ready to,. Lay down my arms. Cracking, my defences breaking down. The unravelling, of a rope I put around me. You wont take no for an answer. Chorus. I didn't know I was missing out, 'til you lost and I, I won. You made me realise my incompleteness alone. Can no longer live by candlelight. When you show me the sun. Chorus"

And soar through the skies. Let go and enjoy the ride. Hey!. Let go and enjoy the ride. Waves are crashing. Sandy feet. Let our troubles wash out to sea. Climb a mountain, name a star. We are free to be who we are. You know it doesn't get better than this. No matter where we go, when we close our eyes. Know it'll be alright. We'll dive through the ocean. And soar through the skies.

little too much,"Sometimes it hits like a car crash. And it's too late to reverse. Sometimes you make me a better person. Sometimes you bring out the worst. Sometimes we get on like fire. Sometimes we stomping like rain. Just when I think that it's over, over. You wave a white flag again. We fall out then we fall back in. We're always back where we begin. Everybody hurts just a little too much. Everybody hurts but it's never enough. It's wonderful to fall. Its love and risk it all. I'd rather love just a little too much.

I know somehow you'll find me. And if I drown in the oceans. You'd be the first to rescue me. Everybody hurts just a little too much. Everybody hurts but it's never enough. It's wonderful to fall.

Left shattered on the ground. You picked me up. All I wanted was a little bit of hope. Couldn't find it. You showed me something. That I never knew I owned. You put a light to it. Oh, you found the peace of me. It was missing; it was broken. You put soul into it. Oh, you found the whole of me. I was empty, now I'm better. 'Cause you pieced me back together.

recover,Been torn apart. Got so many scratches and scars. Maybe they won't all go away. But they'll fade. Maybe time can mend us together again. It's not what we've done. But how far we've come.

smell the roses,"I've been livin in a room without windows. Away from the sun, no oxygen. I couldn't tell if it was day or night. Away from the sun, growing nowhere fast. Rushing along on the pavement. Don't even look at the people's faces, going places. When an old man said stop. You nearly stepped on a flower. Growing through the cracks. And you didn't even notice. Wake up smell the roses. Life is happening and you don't know it. Wake up, take a moment. Grab it in your hands... and own it. I realise our love is like that flower. Been neglecting the thing most precious to me. You've been talking but I haven't been listening. The static in the noise been drowning you out. I so wanna be in the future. That I keep tripping. Over my own shoe laces. In these human races. And i'm brought back to now. And the volume goes down. There's peace in his words as loud as a shout sayin'. Wake up smell the roses. Life is happening and you don't know it. Wake up, take a moment. Grab it in your hands... and own it. He says. Wake up smell the roses. Life is happening and you don't know it. Wake up, take a moment. Grab it in your hands... and own it. Like your birthday I forgot. I was with you. But I was not... really there. Snap your fingers, that's your life. Not gonna let it pass my by no. When an old man said stop. You nearly stepped on a flower. Growing. Through the cracks. And you didn't even notice. Wake up smell the roses. Life is happening and you don't know it. Wake up, take a moment. Grab it in your hands... and own it"

stepping stone,Day dreamin' at a bus stop. Zonin' out when it hit me hit me. We're all marchin' to the same beat. But no one knows where we're going. It's hard for me to keep up. Wearin' shoes that don't fit me fit me. So I'm gonna kick them off. And put on a pair of my own. The path of least resistance. Is easy too easy. Like roasted versus instant. Under pressure we become refined. I'm takin' the hard road. As long as it's my own. I'm takin' the hard road. Each rock is a stepping stone. I'm takin' the hard road. With all of its highs and lows. And whatever rocks life throws. Each rock is a stepping stone. One foot in front the other. The scenery not so pretty pretty. Don't wanna shut it out. I'm living and I'm growin'. Ain't lookin' for a shortcut. 'Coz every time they short change me change me. I won't sidestep the problems. 'Coz I'm learning how to use them so. I'm takin' the hard road. As long as it's my own.

What can I say anyway. [Chorus]. Bridge. By the way you turn me on to your favorite band. By the way you lift me up when I'm fading. Breathe me in when I'm suffocating.

the little things (feat. ne-yo),[Chorus - Natasha Bedingfield:]. Even though the little things matter the most. It's always the little things that go unnoticed. Even though the little things matter the most. It's always the little things that go unnoticed. Even though the little things matter the most. It's always the little things that go unnoticed. Even though the little things matter the most. It's always the little things that go unnoticed. [Verse 1 - Natasha Bedingfield:]. Saw it on a post it. Message that he wrote it. Said I hope you liked the. Dinner that I cooked. Marvin in the background. Candles that are burned down. His romantic gesture completely overlooked. All along the stairs. Petals of a rose. Leading to a bath. That had now gone cold. It wasn't until she laid down. And took a look around. Nowhere to be found. He wasn't there. Unappreciation. An all too familiar place. He'd been there for too long. And decided to escape. [Bridge:]. It's funny how you find. You're blind. Til what's right before your eyes. The little things hide behind. The trivial things larger inside. [Chorus]. [Verse 2 - Ne-Yo:]. ... a new day. Just another Tuesday. Up and to the usual. Brushing of his teeth. Walking down the stairs. Eyes fixed upon his neck tie. Honey where's my breakfast. As he takes his seat. He never looks up. Never showing love. Reading a newspaper. Like he normally does. Suddenly he wonders why. He's gotten no reply. Looks up and sees her letter lying there. Unappreciation. An all too familiar place. We've been here for too long. Me and the kids have gone away. [Bridge]. [Chorus]. [Natasha Bedingfield & Ne-Yo:]. You never miss it til it's gone. Til it's gone. Til it's gone. You never miss it til it's gone. Til it's gone. Til it's gone. You never miss it til it's gone. Til it's gone. Til it's gone. You never miss it til it's gone. Til it's gone. Til it's gone. [Chorus]

Running in circles, chasing tails. Oh coming back as we are. Nobody said it was easy. It's such a shame for us to part. Nobody said it was easy. No one said it would be so hard. I'm going back to start"

There's no other way. To better say. I love you, I love you.... Read some byron, shelly and keats. Resited in over a Hip-Hop beat. I'm having trouble saying what I mean. With dead poets and drum machines. I know I had some studio time booked. But I couldn't find a killer hook. Now you're gonna raise the bar right up. Nothing I write is ever good enough.

touch,I was tryin' to cross the street. When I tripped and spilled my coffee. On a man who yelled at me. And then walked off in a hurry. Now he's gonna be late for work. So he called his secretary. Said to cancel his appointment with the guy in the lobby. Who's been waiting for a while. And talking on the phone. Got invited to a party and thought he couldn't go. But he's here right now. Standing in my house. And someone turns the music loud. So we dance. And we laugh. And we touch (touch touch). Yeah we dance. And we laugh. And we touch (touch touch). Gonna party all night till the sun comes up. Cuz it feels like the world dissapears around us. When we dance. When we laugh. When we touch. I was planning out my party. Running errands 'round the city. Grocery bags full of alcohol. And chocolate chip cookies. Saw a dress that was amazing. In the window of a boutique. So I went across the street. Then my heel broke and it threw me. I tried to catch my balance. But I was supposed to fall. It seems that spilling coffee. Was no accident at all. Cuz you're here right now. Sitting on my couch. Funny how it all works out. So we dance. And we laugh. And we touch (touch touch). Yeah we dance. And we laugh. And we touch (touch touch). Gonna party all night till the sun comes up. Cuz it feels like the world dissapears around us. When we dance. When we laugh. When we touch. Every choice we make. And every road we take. Every interaction. Starts a chain reaction. We're both affected. When we least expect it. And then when we touched. And it all connected. Every choice we make. And every road we take. Every interaction. Starts a chain reaction. We're both affected when we least expect it. And then when we.... When we dance. And we laugh. And we touch (touch touch). Yeah we dance. And we laugh. And we touch (touch touch).

tricky angel,"I like to think I know how to look out for myself. I've got ways and means to filter wrong guys out. When the B.S. meter is slamming into the red. I just walk away 'cause I'm not interested. I've never met a boy who didn't hit on me. I did not suspect reverse psychology. You know, if you'd knocked I wouldn't have let you in. How'd you get the code to my security system. I think some tricky angel. Just knocked me on the head. Made me look at you different. Made me see some sense. Tricky angel got me falling. Without my consent. And I'm so glad he did. 'cause I didn't know you were heaven sent. I was writing you off, making a huge mistake. His intervention rescued us from fate. I don't know how, but somehow you got me down. You just broke into me and ignored that it wasn't allowed. Someone's being sneaky, sneaky. 'cause I'm so hard to please. I was so picky, picky. So cupid take the boxes for me. I think some tricky angel. Just knocked me on the head. Made me look at you different. Made me see some sense. Tricky angel got me falling. Without my consent. And I'm so glad he did. 'cause I didn't know you were heaven sent. Under the radar. You slipped into my heart. You gave me a taste for. What I didn't know that I wanted. When I wasn't looking. You did what I least expected. Tiptoed in while I was sleeping. And I'm wide awake now. I think some tricky angel. Just knocked me on the head. Made me look at you different. Made me see some sense.

we're all mad,"Oh, I think the lady did protest too much. She wouldn't take the flower from my hand. She only saw the shadow of my circumstance. Perception can describe what makes a man. I didn't mean to interrupt your stride. But a rose was all I had to give. Sometimes beauty isn't recognised. When it contrasts with what you feel inside. Who's to say the darkened clouds must lead to rain. Who's to say the problems should just go away. Who's to point a finger at what's not understood. Because, we're all mad in our own way. Colours fade the grey away. Different people all the same. Each reveals the meaning. We're all mad in our own way. Fill the sky with different shades. Read the story on each page. Each reveals the meaning. Each reveals the meaning. Sometimes I think I over analyse. As if I cant control the time and place. Life isn't something you try on for size. You can't love without the give and take. Who's to say the darkened clouds must lead to rain. Who's to say the problems should just go away. Who's to point a finger at what's not understood.

weightless,"I have to keep reminding myself. I'm not like anyone else. That's my face on my ID. That makes me VIP. No one exactly like this. No one with my fingerprints. No one can touch you like me. I can't fake what you see. They told me: ""Girl, to get you're way,. You've got to be a bitch!"". They say: ""A guy won't get no way,. If he's not filthy rich!"". You start with little changes,. 'Til you don't know who you are. Surround yourself with friends. Who only call you a superstar. Oh yeah (3x). The sky is the limit. And I just wanna flow. Free as a spirit on a journey of hope. Cut the strings and let me go. I'm weightless, I'm weightless. Millions of balloons tethered to the ground. Weight of the world tries to hold us down. Cut the strings and let me go. I'm weightless, I'm weightless. All the things I hold in my fist. If I don't let go, I don't exist. They've become the things that define me. How I look and the things to buy me. That's not important anymore. I feel me rising off the floor. Light as a feather, I'm carefree. I'm weightless. The sky is the limit. And I just wanna flow. Free as a spirit on a journey of hope.
