It's gonna feel like daylight. It's gonna feel like daylight. Is it so, is it so. It's stronger if you cry into the phone. Am I vain, am I vain. To think that you could never let me go. I grew up with curtain falls. And applauding when the lovers rose from deaths to bow. Oh. And we would leave with tears and smiles. Thinking this is how we want to feel all the time. A wide open door. And no one seems to know. Should I go in?. No poetry helps the cause. And all the advice people tend to throw. It doesn't help no 'cause I'm on my own. Tonight I think I saw the daylight. Daylight, daylight, daylight"

Why are we here in the first place. Settle down and live in a fable. Peter pan lost at the pool table. Tiny little cars down there. Am I looking for trouble?. Seeing stars in the hubble?. It's a long fall. We are all wondering, wondering, wondering. I'm forever so blind in this puzzle. What will be there to protect us. It's the little things, little things, little things"
machine,"You know I feel like I'm just a circuit. But there's no use without the part. And all the ticking sounds around you. That's the beating of my heart. All the wires feed me dreams I thought I never had. It's my world today. I don't have to stay. Break from the machine. Not that far away. I don't have to stay. Break from the machine. Learn the rhythm from the silence. A little fire sparks would fall. And your electric rivers' flowing. There's no way around the storm. All the wires feed me dreams I thought I never had. More than numbers. Out of order. Reaching over and over above them. Indestructible tiny blossoms. Keep them coming. They're coming, they're coming"

'Cause love still lives here. Could we go just a little bit longer. I don't know if it's right or wrong but. Just for now, nothing is over. Can we try just a little bit harder?. We'll burn just a little bit brighter. Tell me now, nothing is over. Nothing is over. Turn the clock, let's go back. Clear what was and we'll start from scratch. And you walk up to me, I'll be wearing that dress. And you ask me to stay, swear I won't run away. 'Cause love begins here. Now can't you see, it's hiding there. Right underneath the mess we made. All we gotta do, is clear it all away"

still here!,"Oh, what a joyful feeling. Celebrate it now. Make those happy moments last a day. Or life!. Toothless - picking one by one. Comparing - all the hair is gone. My shoulders drapped in the windless heat. Yet I'm still here. Still here. Still here. All the Sunday girls are dancing with the perfumed boys. Why can't I enjoy?. My head is full of noise. Gravity terminates. We wil disperse into infinity. All the fingers - trying to grasp some air. All the minglers - searching for a laugh to share. My eyes are bleached. Where's my lump of amber?. Are you still here?. Still here?. Still here?. All the Sunday girls are dancing with the perfumed boys. Why can't I enjoy?. My head is full of noise. Gravity terminates. We will disperse into infinity"
