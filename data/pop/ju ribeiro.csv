avoiding places,"It's been a while since I heard from you. And I know I was the one who chose that. It's just that you got me so confused. 'Cause I thought you were the best I ever had. Even your mom texted me the other day. Saying I should come over for a coffee. And I bet if your dog could talk. Would ask about me too. And when you ask how I've been. I know I tend to hide it. 'Cuz I know you know how I've been. I wonder don't you mind it?. 'Cause I've been avoiding places I know you may go. I know that every heart heals. And I should take it slow. But my anxiety keeps saying no. You are the best thing I wish I still had. And I just get so mad. 'Cuz it just hurts so bad. You are the best thing I wish I still had. And I just get so mad. 'Cuz it just hurts so bad. Don't get me wrong, I still wish you the best. I just don't know how I'd be if I saw you next. To that girl, oh no. I miss calling you love, feeling your love. so hard to see my babe saying that wasn't enough. It was so hard when I saw you had gone. To the place I wanted to take you to, with her. And when you ask how I've been. I wish I could say. That I'd be better. if you had chosen to stay. 'Cause I've been avoiding places I know you may go. I know that every heart heals. And I should take it slow. But my anxiety keeps saying no. You are the best thing I wish I still had. And I just get so mad. 'Cuz it just hurts so bad. You are the best thing I wish I still had. And I just get so mad. 'Cuz it just hurts so bad. 'Cause I've been avoiding places I know you may go. I know that every heart heals. And I should take it slow. But my anxiety keeps saying no. You are the best thing (The best thing). I wish I still had (I wish I still had you). And I just get so mad. 'Cuz it just hurts so bad (So bad, so bad). You are the best thing (The best thing). I wish I still had (I wish I still had you). And I just get so mad. 'Cuz it just hurts so bad. I've been avoiding those places. But in the middle of those faces. I keep looking for yours. I keep looking for yours. And I still go. I hope they don't know (hope they don't know). But I was kinda hoping you would show up"
control freak,"Take me back to when I was ok. 'Cuz I've been kinda fucked up in every single way. Used to get me, now you don't. Don't regret it, like you say you do. Have you ever read all the things you say?. 'Cuz you texted all of them instead of saying them face to face. Could you let me just move on?. There's no reason for me to be here if your love is gone. And I keep on. Telling myself that I have to stop. Letting you control me. Like a control freak babe. And have you heard yourself?. I can't believe I'm about to say. I'm sorry. To this control freak, save me. Can't seem to let you go, I hope you know. That I'm on the road searching for a place. Inside my own head where I know you won't get. Just to mess it up like you did to my love. You're a control freak. You're a control freak. You're a control. You're a control freak. You're a control freak. You're a control. I know what your intentions are when you text me (test me). It would be easier if I told you to forget me (next please). I've been wondering if I should ever call. But I'll end up saying it's my fault. Even though it's not at all. You keep on playing me like a doll. And I just can't stand the way you always come. Playing your games, not the same. Do you think that's fun?. And all my friends say that I better run. And I try (But you're always in my mind). Yeah, I try (But no one seems to get me right). And I keep on. Telling myself that I have to stop. Letting you control me. Like a control freak babe. And have you heard yourself?. I can't believe I'm about to say. I'm sorry. To this control freak, save me. Can't seem to let you go I hope you know. That I'm on the road searching for a place. Inside my own head where I know you won't get. Just to mess it up like you did to my love. You're a control freak. You're a control. You're a control. You're a control freak. You're a control. You're a control. Stop saying you miss me, if you don't mean it. I've got plenty of time, but none for your games. I've been kinda busy lately, but I was hoping you could save me. But I guess I'll have to learn how to save myself. Making time for you just can't be right, instead. Taking time from you just seems alright. And now I know that. You're a control freak. You're a control. You're a control. You're a control freak. You're a control. You're a control. You're a control freak baby. You're a control freak baby"

And I know that I've grown, but my life is a show. And I'm out of control, may not make sense. But all I've been told didn't mention this mess. I guess I ain't being my best. Get it out of my chest.
