bells,"I know it's late. I know the curtain's drawn over your window. Maybe fate, or maybe just the tug of lonely made me call. But anyway, love, I'm hearing bells. I just thought you should hear the bells. Oh oh oh (x2). Oh oh I, I can hardly wait. I woke up in a world that's suddenly heart-shaped. Throwing you a line, send me back a sign, love. One by land or two by sea. Oh Bells. Nothing here but bells. Ringing in my heart. La la la la la la.... Meet me at the tower. We'll hang on to the ropes and swing out. Meet me at the tower. We'll hang on to the ropes and swing out. Bells, in my heart. Oh bells, in my heart. bum bum la la la la la la la. bum bum la la la la la la. bum bum la la la la la la la. bum bum bum bum bum. I can feel the sky cracking in my heart. It's falling to the pavement. Don't know where to start. So, let's go to the tower. one more time. and Climb high, love, climb high. Oh bells.

come to me,"Give me some time to lift myself up. I have been down for the count. And all my self pride is gone like the winter. Fresh like a flower I come alive. Love, come to me slow. Love, come to me slow. A compass gone blind. My heart unsteady, hoping to dance on the wire. I move a little bit and take it back. Run away but with a map. Always returning and turning and turning. Love, come to me slow. Love, come to me slow. La la la lalala lalala lalala. La la la lalala lalala lalala. I keep running, and running, and running. I keep running, and running, and running. I keep running, and running, and running. I keep running, and running, and running. Over, up over that hill. I'll find my peace, I will, I will. Love, come to me slow. Love, come to me slow, yeah. Love, come to me slow. Love, come to me slow"
elijah,"Oh my love, it's a long way down. to the bottom. when you're high and mighty and sacred, sacred.

A Mother Mary Pollyanna child. so cover up and sit tight. button up and don't fight. on your knees, begging please. for someone to save me.

perfect,"When all the lights go down around you. and the truth is coming up hard. Feel the way you do, now, with no excuses. Cause you're perfect just the way you are. Get the feeling that something surrounds you. Give it all up and watch it fly. Speak soft, dear and let it wash over you. Cause when you give an inch you walk that mile. and you walk that mile so well. You're everything you were ever supposed to be. Don't you see?. Those dark dreams of yours. Your drowning eyes. And that sad mouth of yours, filling up with lies. Don't believe them, love. When they're telling you, that you're not enough. You're everything you were ever supposed to be. Don't you see?. Demons, bells and acrobats. Welcome to the circus inside, your mind. Oh the world is heavy, I know. A minor catastrophe with every shrug of your shoulder. But you don't have to carry it no more. It's time you let it go. Let it go, love. Let it go now. You're perfect just the way you are. Cause you and I know. You're everything you were ever supposed to be. Don't you see?. It's supposed to be easy"

I am the prettiest girl you ever did see, yeah. Oh, pretty, pretty me. I am the prettiest girl you ever did see. Seventh grade, my boyfriend made. a joke about the way I looked in the pool.

same heart (feat. tom chaplin),"Laura. I spent a long time hiding. Believing that i was alone. Under the surface i was stone. When the walls that i built. In the end, just knocked me down. I let the earth pull at my bones. Laura and tom. Closing the distance. I'm reaching out. It starts with a whisper. Can you hear me now?. All the lies we spoke. And dreams we broke. Underneath it all. Beats the same heart. Tom. We spent such a long time trying. Rolling the rock up the hill. With just a trail of dust behind. Oh that city we built is a song. That calls us out. And we will sing it as we climb. Tom and laura. Closing the distance. I'm reaching out. It starts with a whisper. But becomes a shout. All the lies we spoke. And dreams we broke. Underneath it all. Beats the same heart. Oh!. Underneath it all. Beats the same heart"
signal,"Radio�s blastin�, I hear they�re broadcastin� a signal that we all should hear. They�re sendin� a message, it�s fighting the static. I�m listening, I�m quiet, I�m here. Soon�. everything will be magic, my dear. Soon�. everything will be magic, Oh my dear. The birds are directing, the traffic below. in patterns ignoring the light. In this motion I�m static, both hopeful and tragic. Eyes up, eyes open and blind. Soon�. everything will be magic, my dear. Soon�. everything will be magic, my dear. I�m waitin� on a sign. I can�t believe the time, we�re livin� in. God let this finally be the one.

I see smoke in the distance. the news is just a premonition. Something�s changin�, something�s goin� down. I�ll take anything you give me. Anything to know I�m not alone. Hopefully I�m not alone, hopefully we�re not alone. Alone�. Soon�. everything will be magic, my dear. Soon�. everything will be magic, my dear. Soon�. Soon�.

single girls,"I think you'd like my new hair. I cut it when you weren't there. that pieces of us everywhere. were falling down. My bed is now a girl's bed. Pink flowers under my head. and pillows on your side instead. of you. 'Cause that's what single girls do. don't think about you. I'm reading books on meditation. Praying for my heart's salvation. I've got the motivation. to be a free girl now. I've gone drinking with the guy down the hall. put up a new color on my bare walls. I'm so damn busy. after all. 'Cause that's what single girls do. don't think about you. I keep trying. I keep trying. to make my way back to the light where I belong. But God keeps lying. God keeps lying. saying this is for the best and nothing here is wrong. But I""m still thinking about you. I think you'd like my new hair. I cut it like I didn't care. that pieces of me everywhere. were falling down. One more glass of wine. before I turn off the lights. this time I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine"
soljah,"I want to be a soljah for your love,. I want to be a soljah for your love. My eyes have finally adjusted. to the light down here below. My eyes can finally see. everything real that's real to me. I was a hungry soldier. I move like a broken train. Looking for the way to go. Hungry for a little grain. But this is the truth and the truth is the love. and the love is all we need,. I want to be a soljah for your love,. I want to be a soljah for your love. My song was long forgotten.

the end,"We had a go. And worked it out. Until the bitter end. And I suppose. I should have known. What was waiting 'round the bend. I didn't know that kindness was fleeting. I didn't know that soft could go hard. I bet you wonder at the words in your mouth. I bet you wonder at the sound. We break the promise. And we take it back. We move in silence. This is the end. This is the end. We try, we fail, we crawl. We let the pieces fall where they may. And the picture fades. So go on and break my heart. It's always been caught off guard. In the end, there is nothing left to save. And the secrets you keep under your tongue. Are turning two into no one. I bet you wonder at the words in your mouth. I bet you wonder at the sound. We break the promise. And we take it back. We move in silence. This is the end. This is the end. The blame falls,. and it goes on and on in circles, spinning round. Let it go,let it go. I can't take it with me, can't take it with you. We break the promise. And we take it back. We move in silence. This is the end. This is the end. by Jamesftm"
trauma,"Trauma at the side of the highway. I rode right by it, I rode right by it. There's glass in the candy, baby. but I still like it, yeah I still like it. And I don't wanna be afraid. and I don't wanna shy away. Shy away from a little scratch or shy away from the pain. Sirens keeps sounding out my name. But I don't mind it, I don't mind it. And the fire keeps blowing smoke my way. But I rode by it, I rode right by it. And I don't wanna be afraid. and I don't wanna shy away. Shy away from a little scratch or shy away from the pain. Ohhh. The pain. It's aching again, my love. It's bruising again, my love. But that's why we're all out (?). Cruising for, looking for the pain. It's aching again, my love. It's bruising again, my love. But that's what we're all about. Cruising for.... [Instrumental]. Poision keeps flowing through my veins. But I don't fight it, no I don't fight it. And the stain on my heart keeps bleeding.
