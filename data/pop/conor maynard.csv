don't you worry child,"There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes. In a happy home, I was a king I had a golden throne. Those days are gone, the memories are on the wall. I'm still hearing the songs from the places that I was born. Up on the hill across the blue lake. That's where I had my first heartbreak. I still remember how it all changed. My father said. Don't you worry, don't you worry child. See heaven's got a plan for you. Don't you worry, don't you worry now. Whoa.... Whoa.... There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind. We ruled the world, I thought I'd never lose her out of sight. We were so young, I think of her now and then. I still hear the songs, reminding me of when. Up on the hill across the blue lake. That's where I had my first heartbreak. I remember how it all changed. My father said. Don't you worry, don't you worry child. See heaven's got a plan for you. Don't you worry, don't you worry now.

hello (feat. anth),"Hello, it's me. I was wondering if after all these years. You'd like to meet. To go over everything. They say 'time's supposed to heal ya'. But I ain't done much healing. Hello, can you hear me?. I'm just at a house dreaming about who we used to be. When we were younger and free. I've forgotten how it felt. before the world fell at our feet. There's such a difference between us and a million miles. Hello from the other side. I must've called a thousand times. To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done. But when I call you never seem to be home. Hello from the outside. At least I can say that I've tried. To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart. But it don't matter, it clearly. Doesn't tear you apart anymore. Hello, how are you?. It's so typical of me to talk about myself. I'm sorry, I hope that you're well. Did you ever make it out of that town. Where nothing ever happened?. It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time. Hello from the other side. I must've called a thousand times. To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done. But when I call you never seem to be home. Hello from the outside. At least I can say that I've tried. To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart. But it don't matter, it clearly. Doesn't tear you apart anymore. What would you do. if you was me I was you?. Would you move on. go and find someone new?. I know it hurts. believe that I'm hurting to. I guess I can't hide it as well as you. Look. I woke up next to the baddest bitch I've ever seen. But even then all I could think of was you and me. My friends tell me. ""Hey Anth homie, just let it be"". Unless they'v been through it. they don't know what the fuck I mean. So please girl tell me what do I do. Cause I know that nobody's perfect. But I'm perfect for you. And girl you're perfect for me. that's something you couldn't see, I tried to show you. but what was the point if you won't believe?. Now tell me why did you leave?. Do you not love me no more?. See I can hide all the pain. But what remains is the scars. I was the best I could be. I know that I have my flaws. But I gave all that I had. Spent more than I could afford. I spent five thousand dollars on a ring. to call you my Misses. And you still had the nerves. to say I gave no commitment. There was no way that I could save ya. Three years is what I gave ya. And then you leave me. and go find a new man three weeks later. My sister thinks you cheated. and honestly I don't blame her. Cos moving on that quick. is way too strange of a behaviour. And I bet daddy's happy. cos he sees you posting pictures. But dawg I bet my life. she thinks about me when you're with her. He don't want you like I want you. He don't need you like I need you. He don't see you how I see you. He don't breathe you how I breathe you. and you know it. So tell me what the fuck you see in him?. We both know that you still love me. so you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me. Right here in my home. Right here all alone. Making love until the morn'. You love how I turn you on. And one thing that I love and hate the moste. Is people always change but the memories don't. And lately I can't even eat. Lately I been feeling ill. When you cannot sleep at night. that's when you know shit is real. You don't even need a gun. You don't even need a pill. If you ever wanna die. Fall in love and you'll get killed. Hello from the other side. I must've called a thousand times. To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done. But when I call you never seem to be home. Hello from the outside. At least I can say that I've tried. To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart. But it don't matter, it clearly. Doesn't tear you apart anymore"

hello (feat. anth),"Hello, it's me. I was wondering if after all these years. You'd like to meet. To go over everything. They say 'time's supposed to heal ya'. But I ain't done much healing. Hello, can you hear me?. I'm just at a house dreaming about who we used to be. When we were younger and free. I've forgotten how it felt. before the world fell at our feet.

But when I call you never seem to be home. Hello from the outside. At least I can say that I've tried. To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart. But it don't matter, it clearly. Doesn't tear you apart anymore. Hello, how are you?. It's so typical of me to talk about myself. I'm sorry, I hope that you're well. Did you ever make it out of that town. Where nothing ever happened?. It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time. Hello from the other side. I must've called a thousand times.

Would you move on. go and find someone new?. I know it hurts. believe that I'm hurting to. I guess I can't hide it as well as you. Look. I woke up next to the baddest bitch I've ever seen. But even then all I could think of was you and me. My friends tell me. ""Hey Anth homie, just let it be"". Unless they'v been through it. they don't know what the fuck I mean. So please girl tell me what do I do. Cause I know that nobody's perfect. But I'm perfect for you. And girl you're perfect for me. that's something you couldn't see, I tried to show you. but what was the point if you won't believe?. Now tell me why did you leave?. Do you not love me no more?. See I can hide all the pain. But what remains is the scars. I was the best I could be. I know that I have my flaws. But I gave all that I had. Spent more than I could afford. I spent five thousand dollars on a ring. to call you my Misses. And you still had the nerves. to say I gave no commitment. There was no way that I could save ya. Three years is what I gave ya. And then you leave me. and go find a new man three weeks later. My sister thinks you cheated. and honestly I don't blame her. Cos moving on that quick. is way too strange of a behaviour. And I bet daddy's happy. cos he sees you posting pictures. But dawg I bet my life. she thinks about me when you're with her. He don't want you like I want you. He don't need you like I need you. He don't see you how I see you. He don't breathe you how I breathe you. and you know it. So tell me what the fuck you see in him?. We both know that you still love me. so you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me. Right here in my home. Right here all alone. Making love until the morn'. You love how I turn you on. And one thing that I love and hate the moste. Is people always change but the memories don't. And lately I can't even eat. Lately I been feeling ill. When you cannot sleep at night. that's when you know shit is real. You don't even need a gun. You don't even need a pill. If you ever wanna die. Fall in love and you'll get killed. Hello from the other side. I must've called a thousand times.

So many things ive done that I wish I never did. Im tryna be the best, but that just causes stress. I should just drop the pen, and not finish the test. I know it isn't right, I know it so wrong. But what can I do when its been like this for so long. Don't try to understand, because you never will. Erase all of the fake and this is how I really feel. You think this is a lie, well look me in the eyes. And you can see just how incomplete I feel inside. Take a look at me, and see through all the pride,. You'll find all the pain and all the fear inside,. Even with all my fans, I've never felt more alone,. But don't you save me cause I just wanna be on my own,. Echoes in my head,. Looking back into the times when I could wake. From this nightmare,. And now my eyes are locked shut and I can't find my way home,. I know I've made my mistakes I'm only human we're all the same,. Thing's I'll pay for, for the rest of my life but who are you to blame?. I can't (can't) take (take) the weight of the world (world). On (on) on my shoulders,. There's something missing from me,. I must be incomplete."
just in case,"So crazy to see you smiling,. Heard he makes you feel incredible,. But I don't wanna hear about it,. Coz I'm the fool that let you go,. I wish that I could turn away,. I can't watch him my place,. Maybe I'm just jealous. So baby just in case he makes the mistakes that I did,. And he don't see what I miss. Just promise me you won't forget,. You don't have to settle for less,. Promise that you never never never ever ever,. Promise that you never never never ever ever,. Ever forget me. He tells you that he loves you,. You never heard that before,. Can't figure how you ended up with him,. But I guess that was my fault I wish that I could turn away,. I can't watch him my place,. Maybe I'm just jealous. So baby just in case he makes the mistakes that I did,. And he don't see what I miss. Just promise me you won't forget,. You don't have to settle for less,. Promise that you never never never ever ever,. Promise that you never never never ever ever,. Ever forget me. I'm not try'na get involved,. Girl I just wanna let you, know,. That if you you ever let him go,. I'll be here waiting for you,. Even though I wanna turn away,. I know my heart is gonna stay,. Coz they got nothing on you. So baby just in case he makes the mistakes that I did,. And he don't see what I missed. Just promise me you won't forget,. You don't have to settle for less,. Promise that you never never never ever ever,. Promise that you never never never ever ever,. Ever forget me"

When I reach out my hand, you're just not there. Cause you walked away and I wish you'd stay. The stars are dying out and we're in the dark. If our love started burning brighter than a lighthouse. Would you shine for me again?. Cause I would set my heart on fire. If it helps you find your way to me again. If our love started burning brighter than a lighthouse. Would you shine for me again?.

Got a taste of the fame and look at who I became. A grown-ass man playing Immature games. I feel stupid, how the hell could I do this?. I knew that you were clueless and all I did was abuse it. I know that it was foolish, I know that it was ruthless. But if I really knew it, why the hell did I go through it?. I remember when you called I told you that I was sleeping. But other girls I was meeting I was too busy cheating. And it just kept repeating and repeating. like every single evening. To the point I didn't even give a damn if you were leaving. But I do now, and now I know. You don't realize what you have 'till the day you see it go. And maybe we'll try again, forget what I did before. Forgive me for my mistakes, I guess that we'll never know. It's a story untold. I've been a liar, been a thief. Been a lover, been a cheat. All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me. Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something. If all it's gonna cause is pain. The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain. So let the river run. And the story goes on, it's the same old song. Flashback to Kat when I was staying at her home. I used to sleep at hers 'cause she'd hate sleeping alone. I go and grab the cover. then a text comes through her phone. And it was from a guy who was older then me. He said ""Call me when you get this. and I'll come when he leaves"". And I just couldn't believe that she was cheating on me. And still had the f**king nerve. tha she could blame it on me. Like ""Anth what did you expect? You aint never around. It was my birthday last week you weren't even in town. And yeah, you bought me a gift but baby that wasn't s**t. I don't care about the money that you spend on my wrist. I cried so many tears because you never were here. And we talked, and we fought. but you just never appeared. I told you so many times it must have. went through your ears. Cause you don't care about us babe, only your career"". And that's real. I've been a liar, been a thief. Been a lover, been a cheat. All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me. Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something. If all it's gonna cause is pain. The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain. So let the river run"
