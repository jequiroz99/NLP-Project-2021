You gotta make one, make one. (Chorus). Where did you go?. What did you see?. Cinderella's eyes. What did you do?. Where did you sleep?. Underneath the sky. Did you belong?. Are you complete?. Kick my heels three times. My oh my, what'll I do out there?. Cinderella are you happy?. With your fella and your home. Had to wake up from my nightmare. Ginger bread. Man he tried to seduce me. Off his head. I'm allergic to dairy. Better yet. He didn't know I needed more. A smart cookie who really knows the score. Little girl. You got to do it for yourself. In a world. Where cards are so randomly dealt. No you can't. Change the done it's in the past. So you, buckle your boots and don't look back. No more pretending. There's happy endings.

"disco, blisters & a comedown","Bruises, in my mind. I can’t get my head off the pillow. Check the bed am i still single?. I look like pantomime,. Checking photos on my phone. And how the hell did i get home?. 4 a.m. i’m hailing down a cab,. He said i live too far,. Stung me for double charge. 2 a.m. i think i am gaga. Maybe i’ve gone too far. I’m dancing on the bar. (chorus). Disco, blisters and a comedown. All i’ve got to show now. From my friday night out. Why, why , why do the lights in the kebap shop. Make this guy look less hot?. He’s looking like john prescott. Lipstick and my keys,. Bottle and a straw. And i’m walking out my door. I got my music, in my room. Rollers in my hair. In my favourite underwear. 5 pm my topshop order’s here. I sent my best friend home. Looks like she’s been tangoed. Thursday night, there’s only one more sleep. They better get some rest. My little dancing feet. (chorus). Disco, blisters and a comedown. All i’ve got to show now. From my friday night out. Why, why, why do the lights in the kebap shop. Make this guy look less hot?. He’s looking like john prescott. (break down). Every sunday morning,. I died a little. I can’t help but want it,. It keeps me ticking. And i can hear it calling. The heavy bass line. Every god damn morning, morning.... (chorus)(2x). Disco, blisters and a comedown. All i’ve got to show now. From my friday night out. Why, why, why do the lights in the kebap shop. Make this guy look less hot?. He’s looking like john prescott"

You took a part of me with you. And since I'm not doing you. They're finding things for me to do. But you're my childhood sweetheart. You took a part of me with you. So what happens now?. You're turning down the volume. Am I supposed to start anew?. So what happens now?. You're turning down the volume. I'm tired of jumping through your hoops. I'm a day without the night (a day without the night). A fish out of water. Now you've left me and it's like. A la-la-la lullaby. You're my childhood sweetheart. The one I chased for so many years. Feels like you've got your hands locked. Over my lips and ears. All those lovely words sang turned into frustrated tears. But you're my childhood sweetheart. I will chase you. Yeah I'll chase you, I will chase you. So what happens now?. You're turning down the volume. Am I supposed to start anew?. So what happens now?. You're turning down the volume. I'm tired of jumping through your hoops. The clock struck 12 and you, you just slipped away. And all I ever knew, told me I couldn't play. So what am I to do find another game?. You made me all that I became, I really want you back again. I'm a day without the night (a day without the night). A fish out of water. Music you are my life. I can't handle a goodbye. I'm a day without the night (a day without the night). A fish out of water. Now you've left me and it's like. A la-la-la lullaby. Even, if I have to go alone. I'd rather that then let you go.

I was lost and broken, they all lead straight to you. Our pretty Frankenstein that you taught how to smile. I'm coming undone, you've got-got to make me new. I got my skin, got my bones, but I am. Bare enough a soul. My arms stretched out before you. Chorus. I am every broken girl living in tainted world. You can put me back together, won't you take me home?. You can fix me up. I am every broken girl caught up in a deadly world. You can put me back together, give me a home. You can fix me up. Fix me, kiss me, break me, tear me apart. Hold me, love me, mend me, give me your heart. I tried to talk to God, but I'm talking to myself. Through the silent echoes you can hear my voice. The plasters and the pills, the stitches and the drills. Trade my clock for your heart, I'm not like other toys. I got my skin, got my bones, but I am. Bare enough a soul. My arms stretched out before you. Chorus. Fix me up. Oh break me now. Oh you know how. Fix me up. I won't go back. I won't go back, no. Fix me, kiss me, break me, tear me apart. Hold me, love me, mend me, give me your heart (x2). I'm coming home, I'm coming home. I'm coming home so you can fix me up"

Their rules are easy if you like to break them and offend. A role reversal that's the password so come make a friend. It's topsy-turvy to give mercy to the guilty man. We love you faking cause you make the effort to pretend. Like a gladiator craves the blood of his spectators. I'm in the middle of a man I'll have to call you later. And just before I pull out I swear to use indicators. So you can see my show, you can you can see my show. Show show show show show show show. Here I go, go, go. Here I go, go, go. Gonna tap tap tap tap tap tap tap. On the mic now. Say my name now. I roll the dice you play like mice send you round the bend. Sugar and spice screaming is nice the fun it never ends. I'm miss mischievous innocent to the bitter end. Make up is make believe so slap it on be my best fried. I had to call a fire man my hair was burning bridges. I'm shooting bullets from my chest I'm super woman b*tches. And if my balls of steel have stuck half way down your pipe. I got some KY, time to open open open wide. Show show show show show show show. Here I go, go, go. Here I go, go, go. Gonna tap tap tap tap tap tap tap. On the mic now. Say my name now. Those days, I'd stumble in the dark,.

i,"I'm scared of dying and not trying, scared of getting old. I'm scared of telling lies cause karma comes and eats me whole. I'm scared to think about the devil cause he takes my soul. I'm scared of baddies, scared of nightmares, scared I'll lose control. I don't like druggies, don't like bad men, don't like bitch girls. Don't think it's healthy holding grudges, that won't save the world. I don't like nasty words, they hurt me like you'd never know. But don't think I won't put on a smiley face and do the show. I hate that bad boyfriends wear some beautiful disguises. I hate it when your order comes and they messed up all your sizes. Hate that I'm always late, hate that I'm messy too. I hate that I have got it in me to start feeling blue. I'm scared to wake up one day and find that my bubble's burst. I'm scared that someone else has got the new collection first. I'm scared of seeing ghosts, I'm scared of the unknown. I'm scared to be some two-faced person's little stepping stone. I don't like the people that leave comments on the internet. They preach they're perfect while they're killing you with intellect. I don't like that you won't let me speak controversially. Because you think that it won't sit well universally. I hope that one day we stop striving for perfection. I hope that everybody loves my new direction. I hope we no more need the adverts that're supposed to help kids getting hurt. I hope that one day we get the answers. I hope that one day we get the answers"

Over and over I'd read it, believe it. Said no to the shrink, I can fix me I think. I've got friends in my head, they've got me on the mend. I'm pretty in my mirror, easy to pretend.... 17 and thought that I'd won the jackpot. Seems I didn't read between the lines of this one. I can't think why I could made you so, so angry. Your bullets i don't feel them come on and fire at me. [Chorus]. Bet that you think that you're on my own,. And you've no one's hand to hold,. Sticks and stones, hurt just a little.... Wouldn't it be worng if we're all the same?. Don't surrender, don't you change?. Sticks and stones, hurts just a little, hurt just a little..."
