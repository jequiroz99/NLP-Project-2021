we radiate,I saw your face in the crowd. Everyone dancing. I asked if they knew your name. They couldn't see you. Thought I'd walk over. Stood there right next to you. Got a sensation. You were right for my body. Ha-ha-ha-ha. You're heaven. Ha-ha-ha-ha. We radiate. Ha-ha-ha-ha. You're heaven. Ha-ha-ha-ha. We radiate. I felt a chill in the air. It's not me dancing. Everyone looks kinda strange. Colors colliding. I'm in possession. This is no ordinary. Friday night disco. You stepped into my body. Ha-ha-ha-ha. You're heaven. Ha-ha-ha-ha. We radiate. Ha-ha-ha-ha. You're heaven. Ha-ha-ha-ha. We radiate

zodiac black,Home is in the water. Home is in the water. Home is in the water. Where I'm in the water. Buried in the water. If there's magic in the water?. If there's magic in the water?. Just a little light flickering. Out on the horizon. Just a little light there. What do I. Should I know. I should've known that. They'll be coming right back. Through the ripples of black. Just a little light flickering. Out on the horizon. Just a little light there. What am I. Your face. Your phasing. Swollen zodiac. In the ripples of black. If there's magic in the water. If there's magic in the water. I have found you
