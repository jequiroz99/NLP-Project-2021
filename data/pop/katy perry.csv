lost,I'm out on my own again. Face down in the porcelain. Feeling so high but looking so low. Party favors on the floor. Group of girls banging on the door. So many new fair-weather friends ooo.... Have you ever been so lost. Known the way and still so lost. Caught in the eye of a hurricane. Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade. So sick of this town pulling me down. My mother says I should come back home but. Can't find the way cause the way is gone. So if I pray am I just sending words into outer space. Have you ever been so lost. Known the way and still so lost. Another night waiting for someone to take me home. Have you ever been so lost. Is there a light. Is there a light. At the end of the road. I'm pushing everyone away. Cuz I can't feel this anymore. I can't feel this anymore. Have you ever been so lost. Know the way and still so lost. Another night waiting for someone to take me home. Have you ever been so lost. Have you ever been so lost

spiritual,"Lay me down at your altar, baby. I'm a slave to this love. Your electric lips have got me speaking in tongues. I have prayed for a power like you. To see deep down in my soul. Oh, you make me bloom. Like a flower, a desert rose. Magical one, a mystery. All of your charms have worked on me. I will surrender myself. Holy hell, and heaven high. You have opened up my eyes. And I'm finally healed. This is spiritual, under your spell. Phenomenal, the way you make me feel. Like an angel, all aglow. Like a feather, you make me float. Flying high as a kite on your love. Lost in sweet ectasy. Found a nirvana finally. Magical one, a mystery. All of your charms have worked on me. I will surrender myself. Holy hell, and heaven high. You have opened up my eyes. And I'm finally healed. This is spiritual, under your spell. Phenomenal, the way you make me feel. Like an angel, all aglow. Like a feather, you make me float. (You make me float, you make me float).

spit,"If you came by me would I crown you my king. Or brush you off as though I really didn't see. If you walked by my side would our souls then be unified. I swore your name would never be denied. But I took up this hammer. And laughed at all your slander. And pierced your hands. With the nails of blasphemy. How could I do this? I don't know. Said something forced me to it, so. Spit in your face and passed you by. (I'd forgotten those words ""your name won't be denied""). But time and time again I'd live that life of sin. I knew it hurt you bad. but I wasn't ready to give in. ""maybe someday,"" but not this day I said. I wanted to live my life I was willing to pay the price. Chorus. But looking into my eyes. I knew you felt this heart's cry. I needed you bad my life was oh so sad. But looking back at all this pain, this guilt, this strife. Would you take it all away if I were to give you back my life?. But you said ""I've forgiven thee"". And you said ""I've forgiven thee"" (repeat). He was hanging on a cross. With a crown of thorns in his head (repeat). But you said ""I've forgiven thee"". And you said ""I've forgiven thee"" (repeat)"

I'll always have the roots from where I came. 'Cuz when it all fades away. My home will still be the same, yeah eh yeah. I don't drink champagne. When I'm back home with my friends. We sip on tea on the porch. 'Cuz I'm still the girl next door. No fancy things when I come off tour. I slip back into my jeans. 'Cuz I'm still the girl next door"

tommie sunshine's megasix smash-up,"Greetings, loved ones. Let's take a journey. The one. Baby, you're a california gurls. Let's go all the way tonight, no regrets, just love. We can dance until we die,. You and I will be young forever. You make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream. The way you turn me on, I can't sleep. Let's run away and don't ever look back. Don't ever look back. My heart stops when you look at me. Just one touch now baby I believe this is real. So take a chance and don't ever look back. Don't ever look back. I'mma get your heart racing in my skin tight jeans. Be your teenage dream tonight. Let you put your hands on me in my skin tight jeans. Be your teenage dream tonight. I know a place. Where the grass is really greener. Warm, wet and wild. There must be something in the water. You can travel the world. But nothing comes close to the golden coast. Once you party with us. You'll be falling in love. California gurls, we're unforgettable. Daisy dukes, bikinis on top. Sun kissed skin, so hot, will melt your popsicle. California gurls, we're undeniable. Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock. West coast represent, now put your hands up. In another life, I would be your girl. We'd keep all our promises. Be us against the world. In another life. I would make you stay. So I don't have to say. You were the one that got away. The one that got away. The one, the one. The one, the one. The one, the one. In another life. I would make you stay. So I don't have to say. You were the one that got away. There's a stranger in my bed,. There's a pounding in my head. Glitter all over the room,. Pink flamingos in the pool. I smell like a minibar,. DJ's passed out in the yard. Barbie's on the barbecue,. There's a hickie or a bruise. Pictures of last night ended up online. I'm screwed, oh well. It's a black top blur,. But I'm pretty sure it ruled. Damn!. Last friday night,. Yeah, we danced on tabletops. And we took too many shots,. Think we kissed but I forgot. Last friday night,. Yeah, we maxed our credit cards. And got kicked out of the bar,. So we hit the boulevard. Last friday night,. We went streaking in the park. Skinny dipping in the dark,. Then had a menage a trois. Last friday night,. Yeah, I think we broke the law. Always say we're gonna stop, oh. This friday night,. Do it all again. T.G.I.F.. T.G.I.F.. T.G.I.F.. T.G.I.F.. You're so hypnotising. Could you be the devil, could you be an angel. Your touch, magnetizing. Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing. They say, be afraid. You're not like the others, futuristic lover. Different DNA, they don't understand you. You're from a whole 'nother world. A different dimension. You open my eyes. And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light. Kiss me, kiss me. Infect me with your loving and fill me with your poison. Take me, take me. Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction. Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign. It's supernatural, extra-terrestrial. Do you ever feel. Like a plastic bag. Drifting through the wind. Wanting to start again. Do you ever feel. Feel so paper-thin. Like a house of cards. One blow from caving in. Do you ever feel. Already buried deep. Six feet under screams. And no one seems to hear a thing. Do you know that there's. Still a chance for you. 'Cause there's a spark in you. You just gotta. Ignite the light. And let it shine. Just own the night. Like the Fourth of July. 'Cause baby, you're a firework. Come on show 'em what you're worth. Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah"". As you shoot across the sky. Boom, boom, boom. Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon. Boom, boom, boom. Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon"

Right back to where we begin. 'Cause the love has gone. And your on your own. 'Cause you missed me la la la la. You just press rewind we go back in time. 'Cause your love is gone and. You're all alone and you miss me. But you didn't miss me when. I was all alone your back caz you know. I can't help but love you. I can't help but kiss you. I can't help but let you in. I'm off to the slaughter and off to the lifehole. Right back to where we begin. Can't help but love you. I can't help but kiss you. I can't help but let you in. You miss me you miss me. Your love has gone and your all alone. You miss me you miss me"
