hands,"If I could tell the world just one thing. It would be that we're all ok. And not to worry 'cause worry is wasteful. And useless in times like these. I won't be made useless. I won't be idle with despair. I will gather myself around my faith. For light does the darkness most fear. Chorus. My hands are small, I know. But they're not yours, they are my own. But they're not yours, they are my own. And I am never broken. Poverty stole your golden shoes. It didn't steal your laughter. And heartache came to visit me. But I knew it wasn't ever after. We'll fight, not out of spite. For someone must stand up for what's right. Cause where there's a man who has no voice. There ours shall go singing. Chorus. In the end only kindness matters. In the end only kindness matters. I will get down on my knees, and I will pray. I will get down on my knees, and I will pray. I will get down on my knees, and I will pray. Chorus. We are God's eyes. God's hands. God's mind. We are God's eyes. God's hands. God's heart. We are God's eyes. God's hands. God's eyes. We are God's hands. We are God's hands"
i love you forever,"You and I walking slowly. Hand in hand. Footprints in the sand. Watch the wind as it plays. Throwing shadows across your face. The sky was so blue. Your eyes so green. The air glittering. So sudden, so swift. Love came to us. Just like a gift. I lived here, you lived far away. Our lives called us back, no we could not stay. With a sad sort of smile you took my hand. Said while we're apart you hope I understand that.... Chorus:. You'll be holding me. And I'll be holding you. Through those long nights. My love will be pulling you through. When you see the stars. Pretend they're my arms. When you feel the air. That is me kissing you there. Say you love me. And I will say I love you. No distance could ever make that untrue. When I'm far away. I'll reach through time and space. When you hear the wind. You'll hear me saying. I love you forever. Fast forward our love story. I still remember that day. Her small precious face. You stared into her eyes. Hypnotized by her smile. But your job meant you had to travel. But we weren't ready for you to go. You held our daughter with a sad sort of smile. Said while we're apart I want you to know that.... Repeat Chorus. God forbid there'll come a day. When the light in my eyes fades away. But from your hearts I will not go. No bounds shall my spirit know, cause. Repeat Chorus 2x"
who will save your soul,"People living their lives for you on TV. They say they're better than you and you agree. He says hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls. Says come here boy, there ain't nothing for free. Another doctor's bill, a lawyer's bill, another cute cheap thrill. You know you love him if you put him in your will, but.... Who will save your souls when it comes to the flowers now?. Who will save your souls after those lies that you told, boy?. And who will save your souls if you won't save your own?. La da de da de da la da da. We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss them. The cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue. Another day, another dollar, another war, another tower went up. Where the homeless had their homes. So we pray to as many different gods as there are flowers. That we call religional friend. We're so worried about saving our souls. Afraid that God will take His toll that we forget to begin but.... Who will save your souls when it comes to the flowers now?. Oh, who will save your souls, after those lies that you told boy?. And who will save your souls if you won't save your own?. La da de da de da da la ha da. Some are walkin, some are talkin, some are stalkin. Their kill got social security, but it doesn't pay your bills. There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay. So you bargain with the Devil, that you're o.k. for today say. That you love them, take their money and run. Say, it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just small one of those things. Those flings, those strings you've got to cut. So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts. Who will save... save your soul when it comes to the flowers now?. oh, who will save your souls, after those lies that you told, boy?. And who will save... save your souls if you won't save your own?."
you were meant for me,"I hear the clock, it's six a.m.. I feel so far from where I've been. Got my eggs and my pancakes too. Got my maple syrup, everything but you.

Saw a movie it just wasn't the same. 'Cause it was happy and I was sad. It made me miss you oh so bad. 'cause. . Dreams last for so long. Even after you're gone. I know you love me. And soon you will see. You were meant for me. And I was meant for you. . Go about my business, I'm doing fine. Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line. Same old story, not much to say. Hearts are broken every day. . Brush my teeth and put the cap back on. I know you hate it when I leave the light on. I pick a book up. And than turn the sheets down. Take a deep breath and a good look around. . Put on my pj's and hop into bed. I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead. I try and tell myself it'll be all right. I just shouldn't think anymore tonight. . Dreams last for so long. Even after you're gone. I know you love me. And soon I know you will see. You were meant for me. And I was meant for you"

foolish games,"You took your coat off and stood in the rain. You were always crazy like that. I watched from my window. Always felt I was outside looking in on you. You were always the mysterious one. With dark eyes and careless hair. You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care. Then you stood in my doorway, with nothing to say. Besides some comment on the weather. Well in case you failed to notice. In case you failed to see. This is my heart bleeding before you. This is me down on my knees. Chorus. These foolish games are tearing me apart. Your thoughtless words are breaking my heart. You're breaking my heart. You were always brilliant in the morning. Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee. Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you. You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones. As I clumsily strummed my guitar. You'd teach me of honest things. Things that were daring, things that were clean. Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean. So I hid my soiled hands behind my back. Somewhere along the line I must've gone off track with you. Excuse me, guess I've mistaken you for somebody else. Somebody who gave a damn. Somebody more like myself. Chorus. You took your coat off and stood in the rain. You were always crazy like that"

what you are,"I'm driving around town. Kinda bored with the windows rolled down. See a girl on the bus stop bench. Dressed to draw attention. Hoping everyone will stare. If she don't stand out she thinks she'll disappear. Wish I could hold her, tell her, show her. What she wants is already there. A star is a star. It doesn't have to try to shine. Water will fall. A bird just knows how to fly. You don't have to tell a flower how to bloom. Or light how to fill up a room. You already are what you are. And what you are is beautiful. Heard a story the other day. Took place at the local VA. A father talking to his dying son. This was his conversation. ""It's not supposed to be like this. You can't go first I can't handle it"". The boy said ""Dad now don't you cry,. Remember when I was a child what you used to tell me when I'd ask why?"". (You'd say) Gravity is gravity. It doesn't try to pull you down. Stone is stone. It can't help but hold its ground. The wind just blows, though you can't see. It's everywhere like I'll always be. You already are what you are. And what you are is strong enough. Look in the mirror. Now that's another story to tell. I give love to others. But I give myself hell. I'd have to tell myself. ""In every scene there's a perfect plan"". Everything I hoped to be. I already am. A flower is a flower. It doesn't have to try to bloom. And light is light. Just knows how to fill a room. And dark is dark. So the stars have a place to shine. The tide goes out. So it can come back another time. Goodbye makes a love so sweet. And love is love so it can teach us. We already are what we are. And what we are is beautiful. And strong enough. And good enough. And bright enough"
bizarre love triangle,"Every time I think of you. I get a shot right through into a bolt of blue. Its no problem of mine but its a problem I find. Living a life that I cant leave behind. Theres no sense in telling me. The wisdom of a fool wont set you free. But thats the way that it goes. And its what nobody knows. And every day my confusion grows. Every time I see you falling. I get down on my knees and pray. I'm waiting for that final moment. Youll say the words that I cant say. I feel fine and I feel good. I feel like I never should. Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say. Why cant we be ourselves like we were yesterday. I'm not sure what this could mean. I don't think youre what you seem. I do admit to myself. That if I hurt someone else. Then wed never see just what were meant to be. Every time I see you falling. I get down on my knees and pray. I'm waiting for that final moment. Youll say the words that I cant say. BY CASTELAR & NATALIA LOPES"
fade away (i'm fading),"It's K-Mart, the bathroom. I'm staring in the mirror. The green lights are bright. It makes the lines clearer. Heard the Angel go. Cigarette smoke's all that's left. I've traded in my wings for a string of pearls. And now the string is all I've left. The light bulbs burn. Some ones in the stall. Big white. Brick wall. Makes me feel small. And I take my shirt off. Looking for a glimpse of flesh. I peel back the concrete. Hope there's still some soil left. Cuz I am fading. I am fading. I am fading away. I am fading. Just like fairy tales. Hero loses faith. I am fading. The air smells like urin. Getting all. I could walk out that door. But no one really ever leaves. I take all my clothing off. Trying not to forget. Stupid things like. The color of urin. And the smell of stone when it's wet. And I am naked in the mirror. With a feather in my hand. The lady comes out of the bathroom. Screaming, ""Oh, Jesus!"". Like I was a man. And I ask her. ""Hey, what happens to us. When we get old and in the way?"". I guess she answered ???. Took me away. And I am fading. I am fading. I am fading away. I am fading. Just like fairy tales. Hero's loses faith. And I do not know. Why or when. I guess that Spring is just a leave me ??. And I am fading. I'm fading. Transcribed by Leave the Shadows Dancing."

brahms' lullaby,"Lullaby and good night. In the sky stars are bright. May the moon’s silvery beams*. Bring you sweet dreams*. Close your eyes now and rest. May these hours be blessed. ‘Til the sky's bright with dawn*. When you wake with a yawn*. Lullaby and good night. You are mother’s delight. I’ll protect you from harm. And you’ll wake in my arms. Sleepyhead, close your eyes. For I’m right beside you. Guardian angels are near. So sleep without fear. Lullaby and good night. With roses bedight. Lilies o'er head. Lay thee down in thy bed. Lullaby and good night. You are mother’s delight. I’ll protect you from harm. And you’ll wake in my arms. Lullaby and sleep tight. My darlings sleeping. On sheets white as cream. With a head full of dreams. Sleepyhead, close your eyes. I’m right beside you. Lay thee down now and rest. May your slumber be blessed. Go to sleep, little one. Think of puppies and kittens. Go to sleep, little one. Think of butterflies in spring. Go to sleep, little one. Think of sunny bright mornings. Hush darling one. Sleep through the night. Sleep through the night.

love used to be,"Love used to be the ruler. From which you measured all. Love used to be the dizzying height. From which you wished to fall. Love used to be the white and gauzy apparition. Towering in your dreams. Love used to be. Love used to be. Love used to be the horseshoe made of iron. And always smiling up. And in your arms it gathered. All manner of silky satin golden luck. Love used to be the pyramid and on top. It's eye that always sees. Love used to be. Love used to be. Dig a six-foot hole. Inside my chest. Heart like a gravestone. Lay it down to rest. Goodbye love. Amen. Love used to be a sigh like petals. Gently falling down. From the flower of my lover's. Half open rosebud mouth. Love used to be the thirst, oh, and the quenching. The question in no need of answering. Love used to be. Love used to be. Love used to be hope unflinching. The dare that believed it must. Love used to be the heady drunken feeling of. Flesh heavy with lust. Love used to be the photograph of the future. Taken by one mind four eyes could see. Love used to be. Love used to be. Dig a six-foot hole. Inside my chest. Heart like a gravestone. Lay it down to rest. Goodbye love. Amen. Love used to be a miracle. The proof that God exists. As it doubled our image, immortality delivered. By the double helix. Love used to be the bedrock you built a life upon. Into the future reaching. It used to be what woke you each day. And eased me into sleeping. Love used to be my compass. But now I'm alone and I'm adrift and I'm lost at sea. Cause love used to be. Love used to be. Love used to be. Love used to be"

what's simple is true,"What's Simple Is True - album: Spirit. Jewel. Turn to me with frozen lips. Your hands are icy cold. Your eyes burn bright against the frost-bit sky.

The more I live. The more I know. What's simple is true. I love you. there's a warmth in my heart. It haunts me when you're gone. Mend me to your side and never let go.

How soon spring forgets. I wanna hold time, say it'll never begin. Old man winter be our friend. Old man winter be our friend. 'Cause the more I live. The more I know. What's simple is true. What's simple is true. I love, I love you"

intuition,"I’m just a simple girl. In a high-tech digital world. I really try 2 understand. All the powers that rule this land. They say Ms. J's big butt is boss. Kate Moss can't find a job. In a world of postmodern fad. What was good now is bad. It's not hard to understand. Just follow this simple plan. CHORUS. Follow your heart. Your intuition. It will lead u in the right direction. Let go of your mind. Your intuition. Is easy to find. Just follow your heart, baby. you look at me but you’re not quite sure. Am I it, or could u get more?. U learn cool from magazines. U learned love from Charlie Sheen. If u want me, let me know. I promise I won’t say no. CHORUS. You’ve got somethin' that you’re wantin' to sell. Sell your sin, just cash in. You’ve got somethin’ that you’re wantin’ to tell. ""You’ll. love me, wait and see"". If u want me, don't play games. I promise it won't be in vain. CHORUS. (by m4rok4s)"
impala,I love girl girl love me. It not all it cracked up to be. Soda pop radio on. Dedicate my girl a song. Gone are days of simple things. Got to buy baby diamond rings.

In the impala of my love (doo wop doo wop). Baby of my love (doo wop doo wop). Baby of my love (doo wop doo wop). Baby of my love.
"1,000 miles away","Its morning time, wonder where you are. Wonder who youre talking to. Wonder if the sun has risen where you are. Its morning time, I miss your hands on my skin. This beds too big without you. Oh god, what do I do?. Im a thousand miles away, and Im lying next to you.. The sun shines golden, and I feel like my car. A little run down, a little beat up, maybe just a. little green. Maybe its my battery, maybe its my starter,. Maybe my hearts too weak. Theres just this feeling, thought I had to get going. Got too scary, got too big, got to get out of here. But now I dont know how to get home.. Oh god, what do I do?. Im a thousand miles away, and lying next to you.. Mama says take my vitamins,. Daddy says girl, dont stay out so late. Sister says theres other fishes in the sea. But love is not a rational thing, and my heart is. beyond advice. No, love is not a rational thing. Oh god, what do I do?. Im a thousand miles away, and lying next to you.. These fields stretch out like patchwork, on my grannys. quilt. She used to tell me that. Life is a series of strange and mysterious things. One minute you think youre up, the next you find youre. down. Your mind says girl, you gotta stick around. But your heart says Im too weak in the knees. Oh god, what do I do?. Im a thousand miles away, and lying next to you."
2 become 1,"I watch u while you're sleeping. Messy hair, chest bare, moonlight on your skin. I wanna breathe u in. In the silence, words come easy. I can tell u now just how simple it's been 2 let u in. Don't move, this mood is a painting. We'll never find the same thing. CHORUS. Love, do not make a sound. Melt into me now. 2 become 1. Love is so close 2 hurting. With a shake we could wake from our own dreaming. But we must make a vow. 'Cause I have waited a lifetime. Now is the right time. CHORUS. Love, let's make time stand still. Let this moment last until. 2 become 1. Like a bird owns its wings. Like a song belongs 2 melody. U belong 2 me. I fold your arms around me. Let your flesh, your breath, your love, surround me. Oh, u feel like home. CHORUS."

Or work this through somehow. And I want 2 see u. I want 2 feel new again. CHORUS. Hey, U. Do not walk away. Let's choose love, come on. What do u say?. Hey, U. Know that I would spend. My whole life all over again. 2 find U. We've layered hurt on hurt. I've seen pain cloud your eyes. But we are bruised, not broken. Like a phoenix, love will rise. And do U see me?. Do u feel new again?. CHORUS. Look in my eyes. Kiss my mouth hard. Let your conviction. Reassure my heart. Promise me now. I'll promise U, too. I love u."
501 beauty queen,"She's got nice lips, a seductive smile. She's still as thin as a beanpole,. with a little less class, but a little more style. And she spends all her time trying not to hear you. What she doesn't want to know. Don't wanna know. And there's Kellogg's in the cupboard. She takes a heart down from off the shelf. She passes by the mirror. She doesn't like to look at herself. Cause she'd rather lose touch with reality. than lose her fantasy. Her fantasy. And her smile is as faded as a used pair of jeans. And her heart is frayed around the edges. she's comin' undone at the seams. And it's her last chance to make a statement. It's her last (note/No I've recieved?). She's a 501 beauty queen. And there's flowers on the table. she's lovely, she's lovely not. But circles only make the hunger grow. so she goes out a lot. And she's out there just a runnin around. Trying to make up some lost time. Lost time. And she sits down for a social call. Like a princess she puffs on a cigarette. Her beauty is all threadbare now. But she's never gonna let them forget. Casue my how she looked smashing in her gold lame tank top. With the fancy beadwork on front. The beadwork's on front. But her smile is as faded as a used pair of jeans. And her heart is frayed around the edges. She's comin' undone at the seams. And it's her last chance to make a statement. It's her last (note/No I've recieved/I percieve?). She's a 501 beauty queen. And a voice chimes like a bell in the night. that just don't know when to quit. She used to have more options. Now she wishes that she'd already picked. And she wishes she couldn't remember. all those things she'll never forget. Never forget.. And the lines they all go deeper than the days of her youth. She flirts and lies and always denies what to her is no longer of any. use. But it's not because she hates what she doesn't understand. She just don't understand. And her fire? is as faded as a used pair of jeans. And her heart is frayed around the edges. She's comin' undone at the seams. And it's her last chance to make a statement. It's her last (note/No? I've receive?/at the seat?). She's a 501 beauty queen."
a housewife's revenge,"Seems like that man took my heart. [Feels]. Laid it neatly out before him on the floor. Then he put on the biggest. heaviest winter boots he had. And stomped on it for three hours,. Maybe four. And I hope his Sorrells are ruined forever. Cause you know he knows how to push my every button. Get down to my last nerve. Like the other day he forgot to put his beer can. In the recycling bin. And he meant to do it on purpose I'm sure. So I might just have to tell him. Why his dog, Ralph, that ran away three years ago. Won't be coming home again. Cause you know he walks around the house. In his underwear. Whenever my girlfriends come around. And perhaps if he were good looking. I might feel a bit jealous, overzealous. But all I feel is embarrassed. Looking at him standing there. And I hope he never finds his left slipper. And my psychiatrist says I should tell him how I feel. He says, ""Oh great, I gotta listen to her snivel again"". So I have these little unfulfilled fantasies. Of putting arsenic in his teacup. We'd see who'd be laughing then. If only he was the type to drink tea. Now I hear him come up the driveway. In his El Camino. With its black with a red-flame firebird on front. He keeps the keys to himself. He won't take me out to the movies. Cause of football. So I'll just hold out on something else. I'll never cook him another single Hungry Man TV dinner again. I say, ""Listen man, you better treat me with some. r-e-s-p-e-c-t. Cause I gotta a whole lotta what you need. Then a whole lot besides, and then still a whole lot more"". He said, ""Yeah, if you were talking about your weight. that might be true - but otherwise all you give me is. Headache and heartburn"". So I took his Hungry Man TV dinner and his Sorrels. So I took his left slipper and his Hungry Man TV dinner. And I spit on his Sorrels as I walked out the door.. And I spit on him as I walked out the door. By the way, your dog Ralph won't be coming home again."
a long slow slide,Lights are bright in the circus. The geeks and the freaks all light cigarettes and laugh at your misery. While the white of the curtain closing crushes your heart. The inertia of loneliness tears your flesh apart. It's a long slow slide. It's a long slow slide. It's a long slow slide. Down. Once the neon is gone. There's still that golden splinter at your side. His manners are charming. But who are you fooling. You're still nobody's bride. And Bukowski's widow. Haunts each empty seat on the ferris wheel. As ghoulish lovers collide in a collage of kisses that they steal. It's a long slow slide. It's a long slow slide. It's a long slow slide. Down. And outside your window you can see the circus it's lurching. with rings of smoke. You laugh halfheartedly at the punchline. Not realizing they've made you the joke. And inside you're heart a war is raging. A region still untamed. The worst fear I can imagine is for the mystery to be named. Is for the mystery to be named. It's a long slow slide. It's a long slow slide. It's a long slow slide. Down
a very big girl,They say you're feeling charitable. And that she's just a homeless little girl. You say she needs counseling. she's on a track team. But I find it hard to believe. Because baby looks like a very big girl. You say she's harmless. I don't about that. She's just a kittycat to me. Looks like a very capable cat. What'cha say about that?. You say she's unattractive. she doesn't turn you on. But that expression on your face ain't exactly a yawn. You say she needs uninticing. But I find it hard to believe. Beacuse baby looks like a very big girl to me. Yeah that cupcake don't exactly look like no hostess to me. Cause baby looks like a very big girl to me.
absence of fear,"Inside my skin there is this space. It twists and turns. It bleeds and aches. Inside my heart there's an empty room. It's waiting for lightning. It's waiting for you. And I am wanting. And I am needing you here. Inside the absence of fear. Muscle and sinew. Velvet and stone. This vessel is haunted. It creaks and moans. My bones call to you. In their separate skin. I make myself translucent. T o let you in, for I am wanting. And I am needing you here. Inside the absence of fear. There is this hunger. This restlessness inside of me. And it knows that you're no stranger. You're my gravity. My hands will adore you through all darkness aim. They will lay you out in moonlight. And reinvent your name. For I am wanting you. And I am needing you here. I need you near. Inside the absence of fear."
adrian,"Adrian came home again last summer. Things just haven't been the same around here. People talk, people stare. Oh, Adrian, come out and play. An unfortunate accident in a canoe. Dr. said, 'I'm sorry not much I can do'. The air was so still , his eyes did not blink. Oh, Adrian, come out and play. Little Mary Epperson liked him. She vowed always to watch after him. Still he did not move. Dr. said it's no use. Oh, Adrian, come out and play. She sat by his side, watched the years fly by. He looked so fragile, he looked so small. She wondered why he was still alive at all. Everyone in town had that 'I'm sorry look'. They talked in a whispered hush, said. 'I'd turn the machines off'. But still she sat by his side. Said, 'Life he won't be denied. Oh, Adrian, come out and play. Yellow flowers decorate his bedroom. Sign above his door says 'Welcome Home'. But he just sits and stares. He's awake but he's still not there. Oh, Adrian, come out and play. She sat by his side, watched the years fly by. He looked so fragile, he looked so small. She wondered why he was still alive at all. Little Mary Epperson grew up lovely. She still comes to visit him on Sundays. He's like an unused toy. He's got big hands but the mind of a little boy. Oh, Adrian, come out and play. Adrian came home again last summer. Things just haven't been the same around here"
afraid it's too late,"She sits at the window. All dressed in white. Been a long time since she's cried. Tears called ....tumbling down. She remembers her childhood brown. She's afraid it's too late. She steps out on the porch. Takes a minute from her day. Just like when she was a child. To listen what the wind would say. She was carefree like the children are today. Say, ?? loves you, won't you come out and play. She's afraid it's too late. When she was a child. She had crowns hiding gold. With such awe, each flower she did hold. And she...the grass beneath her feet. How she hated things that were already late. They took away her laughter. They took away her crown. They said ""hey girl, you gotta keep your feet on the ground"". She said ""oh, but they are"". They say ""Well laughter won't pay your bills"". A flower fell from her hand, falling still. They taught her to be respectable. Responsible somehow. They taught her to be in every..... She forgot how it felt to have leaves of grass beneath her feet. Now every thought screams to return to her childhood royalty. She's afraid it's too late. She takes one last moment. Before going inside. She takes a coat. To dry her eye. She ... and it all becomes clear. It's probably laughter that gets you what you need. ....More than here. She's afraid it's too late. La la la la. la la da da laaah."

ain't no lookin back (september 1996),"All of your ghosts. Litter the horizon. Glittering carcasses. I guess that makes twice then. Just like your daisies. And all of your buffallo. You dont worry. The children will mend what you tore. You dress yourself in sharkbites. You kill yourself in spoonfuls. You damn all the beehives. You make love to potholes. Your attention is a junkie. It has a wandering vien. And all of your thoughtlessness. Is dried up rain. Aint no lookin back, now---Is there kid?. You always look to the west. You throw caution to the wind. You're on a one way track. But you cant buy caution back---Can you kid?. You killed a man. Because you made him borrow. One suicide is made up. Of ten thousand tiny sorrows. America's great. Its the land of the free. We're so independant. That we forgot how to breathe. Aint no lookin back, now---Is there kid?. You always look to the west. You throw caution to the wind. You're on a one way track. But you cant buy caution back---Can you kid?. Show me one hero. Who ain't afraid of fear. Show me one adult. That knows how to hear. ""We are the future"". At least thats what you said. I wanna know:. Who's the hope of today?. There's no lookin back now for you---Is there kid?. All of your ghosts. Litter the horizon. Glittering carcasses. I guess that makes twice then. Just like your daisies. And all of your buffallo. You dont worry. The children will mend what you tore."
all by myself,When I was young. I never needed anyone. And making love was just for fun. Those days are gone. Living alone. I think of all the friends I've known. When I dial the telephone. Nobody's home. All by myself. Don't wanna be. All by myself. Anymore. Hard to be sure. Sometimes I feel so insecure. And loves so distant and obscure. Remains the cure. All by myself. Don't wanna be. All by myself. Anymore. All by myself. Don't wanna live. All by myself. Anymore. When I was young. I never needed anyone. Making love was just for fun. Those days are gone. All by myself. Don't wanna be. All by myself. Anymore. All by myself. Don't wanna live. Don't wanna live. All by myself. I never needed anyone.
all the animals,All the animals. agree you and me. should be a team. And they walk on parade. say that we were made. to be a team. And my flesh melts beneath your tongue. I am your little comunion. And all the rainbows. Tell me that they know. We're a perfect pair. And the birds up in the sky. Say they can see it from way up high. We're a perfect pair. And my wings weaken beneath your will. And before you I am trembling and still. All the birds know it. One and one is two. All the birds see it. Tell me why don't you. And all the light of the sun. Doesn't help me out none. Cuz you still can't see me.
amen,"You're mothers' child but night lays you down. Hair aflame, wile look in your eye, naked belly to the ground. A forest fire nibbles at your veins. Crawls up your arm runs away with your mind. And burns dry thoughts like leaves. Amen. Eyes stare up but something's in the way. In the Bible only angels have wings. And the rest must wait to be saved. A dry tongue screams at the sky. But the wind just breathes words in. As a strange bird tries to fly. Amen. Pieces of us die everyday as though our flesh were hell. Such injustice, as children we are told that from God we fell.. Where are my angels? Where's my golden one?. Where's my hope now that my heroes have gone?. Some are being beaten, some are being born.. And some can't tell the difference anymore. Amen, Hallelujah, Hallelujah"

angel needs a ride,"Said, ""Angel, Do you want a ride?"". Said, ""Angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely. And I need somebody by my side"". It's a long road that stretched from Vegas to nowhere. But it'd been an even longer time. Since he found some piece of mind. And he lived off of bubblegum and cigarettes. And got his nourishment from all-night stores. Thought he'd just keep driving. Til he outdrove his sorrow. He said, ""Angel, Oh do you want a ride?"". Said ""Angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely. And I need somebody by my side"". Her feet were warm and tired. But as determined as a soul. She left with no regrets. But also no posessions did she own. Her heart was as fragile as her thin, loving arms. She's praying to god to take away her lonely. When he pulled on aside of the road. And he said, ""Angel, Oh do you want a ride?"". Said, ""Angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely. And I need somebody by my side"". The highway goes on forever. I've seen a thousand men like him before. And I've seen a thousand angels that. Got into the car. They're just a couple of lost souls. Looking to rekindle some sort of forgotten dream. I hope they find what they're looking for. In the solace of the road. They said, ""Angel, Do you want a ride?"". Said, ""Angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely. I'm tired and I'm lonely. I'm tired and I'm lonely. I'm tired and I'm lonely. And I need to have somebody. By my angel""."

anyone but you,"I haven't been out lately. There's too much going on. My friends say I'll go crazy. ""Go get out and have some fun"". So I put on my best dress. I confess felt good I gotta say. When I stepped into the dance floor. What I saw took my breath away. Anyone but you. Anyone but you. Was hoping I would run into. Anyone but you. Through the smoke and neon. I saw you look my way. Here come those same old feelings. I thought had gone away. But I know that I am strong. And as the night draws on. Should you ask to take me home. I'm sure that I'll say no. To anyone but you. Anyone but you. I was hoping I would run into. Anyone but you. I'd like to fall into your arms. With all your charms. But we both know how that would end. It would end with me crying. And you leaving again. Oh anyone but you. Anyone but you. I was hoping I would run into. was hoping I would run into. Anyone but you"

Trying to forget. Is this as bad as it gets. Turn out the light, it hurts too much. To know you're never coming home again. You said goodbye. Is this as bad as it gets. Is this as hard as it seems. Is this the way it feels with a dagger through your heart. When you're falling to your knees ripped and torn apart. How long am I gonna cry, feel like I'm gonna die. Trying to forget. Is this as bad as it gets. Tonight, Tell me I've seen the worst of this jagged knife. Deep inside my broken heart. He'll only leave a scar. Is this as bad as it gets. Is this as hard as it seems.

barcelona,"Barcelona where the winds all blew. And the churches don't have windows but the graveyards do. Me and my shadow are wrestling again. Look out stranger, there's a dark cloud moving in. But if you could hear the voice in my heart it would tell you. I'm afraid I am alone. Won't somebody please hold me, release me. Show me the meaning of mercy. Let me loose. Fly, let me fly, let me fly. Super paranoid,. I'm blending, I'm blurring, I'm bleeding into the scenery. Loving someone else is always so much easier. But I hole my self hostage in the mirror. But If you could hear the voice in my heart it would tell you. I'm tired of feeling this way. God, won't you please hold me, release me. show me the meaning of mercy. Let me loose. Let me fly, let me fly. I won't be held down, I wont be held back. I will lead with my faith. The red light had been following me. But don't worry mother. It's no longer my gravity. Hold me, release me. Show me the meaning of mercy. Let me fly, let me fly, let me fly"

Now crowded rooms. make it easier. to forget. I'm alone. It's only when the moon is high. I start to miss you standing by. But I'm afraid if I wish tonight. My lucky star will be out of sight.

because i love you,It's time now to leave. Quiet the mind of it's chatter. Still the riot in your heart. Disarm the tongue of it's dagger. Tell your arms not to worry so. And listen...... Step into it. Lift your face into the strong wind. Least we miss it's meaning. Such cold beauty exists here. Do you see it?. Like the landscape. Frozen & waiting to be born. Let me bundle you in clothing. And soft things. Because I love you. I will not send you out into the night. With teeth marks & pride I have stripped you of. We will prepare each other. We will make up our own ceremony. I will draw a compass on your belly. Tell me that its OK. Before you turn me loose. Into the endless sky. Let me kiss you & then send you on your way. For Winters can be long. And I will need a friend.
becoming,"Listen, heart. Listen close-listen. 2 the melancholy. Melody of your own voice. I am weary of my own dreaming. I am tired of waiting. So this time, I'm leaping. CHORUS. I reach-beyond myself 2 see. What I find, beyond my mind, there is no time. In this place beyond my sight. My heart knows what is not yet seen. I'm witnessing my own becoming. Lash myself 2 the. Mantle of my desire-I will. Turn from its temptations. But the wanting takes me higher. I am hurting. Oh, I am not yet born. I am the mother and the father. Of what is not yet known. Darkness surrounds me. I scratch, I struggle, I breathe. CHORUS."

Feels like somebody's face is stuck to the bottom of my shoe. Got a plastic jesus, a cordless telephone ..??.. corner of my room. Got everybody but you tellin' me what to do. ***. Well I've been down so long. It can't be that much longer still. And I've been down for so long. That the end must be drawing near. ***. I looked to everybody but me. To answer my prayers. Until I found an angel in the bathroom. Who said she didn't see anybody who was savin anywhere. And the blind man said, ""Simple... like flipping a coin -. Don't matter what side it lands on. So long as it's somebody else's dime"". Cause if you're the top of the bottom. It all feels the same. We live out of fear if we're too rich or we're too poor. Fuess all I can do is museter up some change. And little bit of faith. And take some dignity when I walk through this door. *** (Chorus). Gonna take a trip. Catch a train. Got a ticket in my hand. And then a fat man takes my money. And like cattle we all stand. I'm just a faceless body lost in this vast and worthless sea. In a thousand people I do not know. But really they are no different from me. They all have passion. They all have fear. They all have intense confusion. And no sweet moments that are clear. They all have aspirations. High hopes and dreams. And are really that alone like me. ***. We've been down so long. It can't be that nmuch longer still. We've been down so long. That the end must be.... The end must be.... The end must be drawing near."
behind the wall,"Last night I heard the screaming. loud voices behind the wall. another sleeples night for me. it won't do no good to call the police. Always come late if they come at all. Last night I heard the screaming. loud voices behind the wall. another sleeples night for me. it won't do no good to call the police. Always come late if they come at all. and when they arrive, they say they can't interfere with domestic. affairs between a man and his wife. and as they walked out the door. the tears were left in her eyes. Last night I heard the screaming. loud voices behind the wall. I pray that I was dreaming when I saw the ambulance in the road. and the police man said ""I'm here to keep the peace,. would the crowd please disperse"". I think we all could use some sleep."
billy,"I know little Billy from the small time town. Ma and Pa meant well but they just weren't around. But he would learn what little they had taught. They told him, Heaven is hard but hell is not. He remembers Papa's words before he died. He said, word hard son, you must change the tide. Before our people have liberation, you can never rest. On your shoulders, lies our future boy, so do your best. Do more than your best. Never forgot the burden of his father's words. He lost his own life and lived the world's. No one told Billy theres somethings one man just can't do. Takes time to forgive and equality to take more before it's through. Just takes time. But still Billy went down to the big time town. Hoping to find some justice there,. But God how it all seems cynical through the eyes of despair. He no longer saw in color, he only saw black and white. There were never people behind thses faces. Until he realized one man can't win. Can't win this fight. So Billy went back to small time town. He got a life and he settled down. He teaches children who never really thought. He told them, Heaven is hard and Hell is. Heaven is hard and hell is. Hell is not worth fighting for.. Transcribed by Adam Longfellow."
bizarre love triangle,"Every time I think of you. I get a shot right through into a bolt of blue. Its no problem of mine but its a problem I find. Living a life that I cant leave behind. Theres no sense in telling me. The wisdom of a fool wont set you free. But thats the way that it goes. And its what nobody knows. And every day my confusion grows. Every time I see you falling. I get down on my knees and pray. I'm waiting for that final moment. Youll say the words that I cant say. I feel fine and I feel good. I feel like I never should. Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say. Why cant we be ourselves like we were yesterday. I'm not sure what this could mean. I don't think youre what you seem. I do admit to myself. That if I hurt someone else. Then wed never see just what were meant to be. Every time I see you falling. I get down on my knees and pray. I'm waiting for that final moment. Youll say the words that I cant say. BY CASTELAR & NATALIA LOPES"
boy needs a bike (ride away),"Pop works in the shop til eight. Mom's on the phone and she's kind of irate. Sally's doing sommersaults on the lawn. Pop slams open the front screen door. Just to scare mom. She says, ""What the hell did you do that for?"". He washes his dirty hands in the sink. And things around the table are kind of rough. Mom says it's pa. Pa says, ""The times are just tough"". And me and Sally don't say much of nothing at all. The garage door light brightens up the night. Pa always works on cars when he gets in a fight. As though he could figure out that woman by working on that. old car. He said a car can cure any problem at all. Cause of looking at all them parts makes a fight look so small. But I wish he'd just put me and Sally in the backseat and. drive us away. That's when he sits me down. He says he's gonna teach me about life. He said, ""A man needs a car and a boy needs a bike"". I got my first taste of freedom beneath the light of the moon. But if it were me. I'd have the guts to put to test those bolts and nuts. And I'd Ride Away so fast, so far. Ride Away... So fast, so far. Put away our tools. We go back inside. Mom feels left out and now she's starting to cry. I wonder if all girls are crazy this way. I wish pops would just get a spine. I said I know it's kind of small but you can borrow mine. He just smiled and said, ""Your mom means well son"". Most times are good it's just some that are lean. But it's love that makes up for those times in beteween. He got a tear in his eye as he took mamma's hand. said one day I'd understand. But if it were me. I'd have the guts to put to test those bolts and nuts. And I'd Ride Away so far, so fast. Ride Away so fast so far. Ride Away."
brahms' lullaby,"Lullaby and good night. In the sky stars are bright. May the moon’s silvery beams*. Bring you sweet dreams*. Close your eyes now and rest. May these hours be blessed. ‘Til the sky's bright with dawn*. When you wake with a yawn*. Lullaby and good night. You are mother’s delight. I’ll protect you from harm. And you’ll wake in my arms. Sleepyhead, close your eyes. For I’m right beside you. Guardian angels are near. So sleep without fear. Lullaby and good night. With roses bedight. Lilies o'er head. Lay thee down in thy bed. Lullaby and good night. You are mother’s delight. I’ll protect you from harm. And you’ll wake in my arms. Lullaby and sleep tight. My darlings sleeping. On sheets white as cream. With a head full of dreams. Sleepyhead, close your eyes. I’m right beside you. Lay thee down now and rest. May your slumber be blessed. Go to sleep, little one. Think of puppies and kittens. Go to sleep, little one. Think of butterflies in spring. Go to sleep, little one. Think of sunny bright mornings. Hush darling one. Sleep through the night. Sleep through the night. Sleep through the night"
break me,"I will meet you in some place. Where the light lends itself to soft repose. I will let you undress me. But I warn you. I have thorns like any rose. And you could hurt me. With your bare hands. You could hurt me. With the sharp end of what you say. But I'm lost to you now. And there's no amount of reason. That could save me. Chorus:. So break me. Take me. Just let me feel your arms again. Break me. I'll let you make me. Just let me feel your love again. Feels like being underwater. Now that I've let go. And lost control. Water kisses fill my mouth. Water fills my soul. So break me. Take me. Just let me feel your arms again. Break me. Make me. Just let me feel your love again. Kiss me once. Or maybe twice. Oh, it never felt so nice. So break me. Take me. Let me feel your arms again. Break me. Make me. Just let me feel your arms again. Just let me feel your love again"
breaking up,Do not think it hurts me bad. It doesn't hurt me none. It does not mean anything. I'm fondling this gun. And I don't hurt that bad. And I don't miss you. I don't eat alone. Wishing I was eating with two. It's like a sad movie. They always get high ratings. In fact I feel like celebrating. I feel like celebrating. And do not think I ever thought that. This would really work. It was just sort of a casual thing. Like trying on a shirt. I don't sit home slone and stare. At your picture wishing that. You were still there. I never get lonely. In fact I'm probably masturbating. In fact I feel like celebrating. I feel like celebrating. Oh goody! Oh joy!. I'm finally free. I no longer have to sit through. Your mother's casserole recipes. Oh joy! Glee!. I'm finally free.
buttercup,"Gee your mom looked like shit last night. Hope that tinker toy boyfriend tonks her right. Then again, I could never tell a fist fight from fun. Maybe I've never really known anyone. Just sat still and spit in the fire. I thought I might strangle you but I couldn't find a wire. You've never been the type to make your heart clear. Lest someone overhear. Words drown in your martini glass. Entire sentences slowly drunk or not. But before they slipped away I swore I coulda heard. Them say you wanted me, to be your buttercup. Say you need me to be your buttercup. The party reached a feverish pitch. Good time soldiers drunk and in a ditch. Infidelity a bomb that went off. That left the world to swerve and cough. Stepped over bodies strewn like shipwrecks. Love's last call, warning puke reflex. Faith is for that frozen few. That never met someone quite like you. Words drown in your martini glass. Entire sentences slowly drunk or not. But before they slipped away I swore I coulda heard. Them say you wanted me, to be your buttercup. Say you need me to be your buttercup. Fish don't know they're short, they just feel sideways. And words to you are just the same, they shy away. When legs and limbs are all tucked in. You pull me close to you come night. And I just like a fleshy fruit and hung from the bowl of your side. Your lips may not sell or say. What your eyes give away. You're sweet as pumpkin pie. I take the keys from your hand that stutters up. Let the night air sober you up. Driving home, you make me pull over. You press my hand gently as a four leaf clover. You say sweetheart, I'm a foolish man. I'm ornry and I'm stubborn like my coffee from a can. But without you I would shrivel up and die. Won't you be my. Won't you be my. Won't you be my. Words drown in your martini glass. Entire sentences slowly drunk or not. But before they slipped away I swore I coulda heard. Them say you wanted me, to be your buttercup. Say you need me to be your buttercup. Buttercup, your buttercup, ducks, shnucks, shlucks, shucks."
can't take my soul,"The weathers getting cold. But its ninety degrees outside. It feels like I'm driving so slow. But this old ford is cruising ninety-five. I thought I could hear your cold words. After all, they were just words. I thought I could see your sad eyes. After all, eyes won't lie. I thought that I could just take this hatred in. Let it back out and see love again. But know I'm giving up. But I'm never giving in. So you can take my life. And you can keep this heart. But you never can take my soul. No never can take my soul. It feels so good like I'm laughing. But theres these tears running down my face. I dry my eyes to see the sun rise. Only to find its set, its too late. So I sit there and listen to you scream. After all, I never would. But I cry before I go to sleep. After all, I knew I wasn't what I should be. I thought that I should just take this hatred in. Let it back out and see love again. But now I'm giving up. But I'm never giving in. So you can take my life. You can keep this heart. But you never can take my soul. No never can take my soul. I tried to say goodbye yesterday. But we ended up in bed instead. *(I don't understand this entire line). But I couldn't, had to turn away, turn my head. Give me the strength to let you go. After all, I never could. *(I don't understand this entire line). After all, I knew I wasn't what I should be. I thought that I should just take this hatred in. Let it back out and see love again. But know I'm giving up. But I'm never giving in. You can take my life, you can have this heart. *(don't understand this entire line). You can have all my hands, my feet and my head. And all of those good things I did everywhere. But you never can take my soul. You'd think that you could posses. All of my looks, all of my prettiness. All of my feelings and my lovings too. But don't you know that you were the fool. But you never can take my soul. No never can take.... Can't take my soul.."
carnivore,"So much space can fit in a side. More than words can say. I'm left here with my hands all awkward. Trying to mend space. I used to know you. But not anymore. Your substance has been subtracted. Word by word. Silence in my ears. Where once you offered your conviction. Your promises are dried beats. They're cracked with nostalgia. But that's all right. That's okay. Had no business. Giving myself to you anyway. Be careful next time for sure. And I'll. I'll never trust my pink fleshy heart. I'll never trust my pink fleshy heart. To a carnivore. Carnivore. Your soul is an ink stain. Your perfection is amend. You're as fragile as your thoughtlessness. As strong as you can bend. You could only believe in embryos. Held all your high hopes through a telescope. Lavender haunted you. So I could own your life in yellow. You have a fire down in genius, subtlety. And you slip through the fingers of ambiguity. Well, that's all right. That's okay. Had no business. Giving myself to you anyway. Be careful next time for sure. And I'll. I'll never trust my pink fleshy heart. I'll never trust my pink fleshy heart. To a carnivore. Well I didn't know. But I won't do it again. This time I'll be my own best friend. And I'll take back my song and my poetry. This time i won't be so easy to read. And I'll never trust my pink fleshy heart. And I'll never trust my pink fleshy heart. And I'll never trust my pink fleshy heart. to a carnivore. to a carnivore. to a carnivore."

cleveland,"Went walkin' underneath the shadows. Where dark and sweet secrets lay. When night's light falls gently down. Hearts helplessly fall to the ground. Underneath the velvet sky. Only words can lie. CHORUS:. I wanna tell you everything. I wanna make your toes curl. You'll be my only boy. And I'll be your only girl. There's not much I can say. You're in Cleveland today. You're in Cleveland today. Stewardesses like Cosmo magazine. Vogue makes me nervous. I feel so plain. I could face the world fearlessly. If you would face it here with me. Just our four hands and four eyes. Traffic cops will compromise. CHORUS. Daffodils and roulette wheels and rusty automobiles. Somewhere our things share the same windowsill. Somewhere our hearts exist independent of time. Somewhere we are whole. One body, one body and one mind. From the air our things look so ridiculous. Our fears so small, our fights so vain. I wanna pilot a plane with you. So all our problems look small too. It's just an inch from me to you. Depending on what map you use. CHORUS."
closer to fine,"I'm trying to tell you something about my life. Maybe give me insight between black and white. The best thing you ever done for me. Is to help me take my life less seriously. It's only life afterall. Well darkness has a hunger that's insatiable. And lightness has a call that's hard to hear. I wrap my fear around me like a blanket. I sailed my ship of safety till I sank it. I'm crawling on your shore. I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children. I drank from the fountains. There's more than one answer to these questions. Pointing me in a crooked line. The less I seek my source for some definitive. The closer I am to fine. The closer I am to fine. I went to see the doctor of philosophy. With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee. He never did marry or see a B-grade movie. He graded my performance. He said he could see through me. I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind. Got my paper and I was free. I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children. I drank from the fountains. There's more than one answer to these questions. Pointing me in a crooked line. The less I seek my source for some definitive. The closer I am to fine. The closer I am to fine. I stopped by the bar at 3 a.m.. To seek solace in a bottle or possibly a friend. I woke up with a headache like my head against a board. Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before. And I went in seeking clarity.. I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children. I drank from the fountains. We go to the doctor. We go to the mountains. We look to the children. We drink from the fountains. Yeah, we go to the bible. We go through the workout. We read up on revival. And we stand up for the lookout. There's more than one answer to these questions. Pointing me in a crooked line. The less I seek my source for some definitive. The closer I am to fine. The closer I am to fine. The closer I am to fine."

comfortably numb,"Snow is on the mountain. winter settles in my heart. Icy fingers are familiar. smooth and cold and oh so hard. Comfortably numb. Frost bites deep. tiny birds fly from my heart. White winds scream. as they leave frozen lands of my heart. Comfortably numb. I watch my hands. to see what it is they do. Their dirty, they don't build churches. They don't take risks and they don't remember you. Comfortably numb. Orion was a mighty warrior. Cleopatra was a cheap French maid. He said sweetheart I give you the moon. She says I much prefer jewelry. So in the stars he stayed. Comfortably numb. Me and Jesus, we go way back. Cause we used to hang at the mall. He says you can't trust them. They'll just put holes in your hands. So I covered him while he stole a bottle of cheap cologne. Comfortably numb. Lord, forbid, care crawled up my arm. and I killed it right on the spot. For fear it might tear out of my heart. And make me love what I do not. Comfortably. Comfortably. Comfortably Numb. Transcribed by Adam Longfellow."

damn the daisies,I go to the table. Your pictures are on the front. I looked so much younger then. Somehow so much different. I look in the mirror. I want to spit on my face. I hate these things I've become. I don't deserve to take up this space. That I live in. Dark rings around my eyes. Bruises on my bones. I'm tired of these lies that drip from my mouth. Like habitual beads from a broken string of once was love. I go to the drawer. I pull out the gun. In my hands it's heavy and cold. It feels like something I was damned to hold. Damn you man and your sweet kisses. Damn your hairs in the sink. Damn the pool and all the trash it collected. The leaves only look like blonds and brunettes to me. Damn my suspicion and damn my sight. Damn you and your twisted ways. Damn my courage for being gone so much. Damn love because it stayed. I lift the gun to my face. I'm gonna shoot myself in the eyes. The daisies are on the table. That you gave me yesterday. But yesterday I was willing to compromise. I hear the key and you open the door. Billy runs to greet you. Billy won't hurt anymore. The sun shines in the window. Where the pictures and the daisies lay. This chaos can't continue. I never liked daisies anyway. I hear your footsteps. Coming down the stairs. You reach the bottom with an apology in your hand. I'm standing there. Funny you have that same look in your eyes. As all those times I had in mine. I pull the trigger. The daisies apologize for the last time. Billy runs downstairs. I am numb. I call the police. Tell them what I've done. I go to the table. where the pictures and the daisies lay. I looked so much younger then. Somehow so much different. The sun shines through the window. Where the pictures and the daisies lay. Where the daisies lay. Where the daisies lay. Oh well. Never liked daisies anyway

I fly and I fly, to my day dream land. I fly and I fly, till the sun goes down. I fly and I fly, till the moon comes up. And then I fly back home. Deep in the canyon, down in the alders. Where the hermit thrushes sing. I sit where the sun shines in a ferny circle. And fly away on day dream wings. I fly and I fly, to my day dream land. I fly and I fly, till the sun goes down. I fly and I fly, till the moon comes up. And then I fly back home. And then I fly back home"
deep water,"Deep Water - album: Spirit. Jewel. You find yourself falling down. Your hopes in the sky. But you heart like grape gum on the ground. And you try to find yourself. In the abstractions of religion. And the cruelty of everyone else. And you wake up to realize. Your standard of living somehow got stuck on survive. When you're standing in deep water. And you're bailing yourself out with a straw. And when you're drowning in deep water. And you wake up making love to a wall. Well it's these little times that help to remind. It's nothing without love. You realize your only friend. Has never been yourself or anybody who cared in the end. That's when suddenly everything fades or falls away. 'Cause the chains which once held us are only the chains which we've made. When you're standing in deep water. And you're bailing yourself out with a straw. And when you're drowning in deep water. And you wake up making love to a wall. Well it's these little times that help to remind. It's nothing without love, love, love. It's nothing without love. We've compromised our pride. And sacrificed out health. We have to demand more. Not of each other. But more from ourselves. ""Cause when you're standing in deep water. And you're bailing yourself out with a straw. When you're drowning in deep water. And you wake up making love to a wall. Well it's these little times that help to remind. It's nothing without love, love, love. It's nothing without love. It's nothing without love"
do you,"Do You - album: Spirit. Jewel. Hey, you say you like the way the cowboys tip their hats and say,. ""How's it goin' ma'am?"". But you're never quite clear if their glares are sincere. Or really only just second hand. To you it's all voices, its a lavender haze. The man is a marvel, but it's a shame about his brains. But that's OK. You say ""he's got straight teeth and it's good sex"". you look to the sky. You look to the man. you claim innocence and not to understand. Or do you, do you?. There's a big mad wearing a white suit and patent leather shoes. he want to take his monkeys to see the kids at the zoo. 'Cause the gypsy on the corner said. ""Hey, Mister you can't lose."". And it's your first day at the track. you feel that beat of your back. We all want to find a way to beat the system. Find some rhythm in the madness. Get down on your knees and pray. Say, ""I'll do whatever you want, God. Just let me have my way"". Well will you, will you?. come on all you merry men. rally your cry. dance with the devil for tomorrow we'll surely. Hey, hey blow the men down. You with all girls today with nothing to say. No more pigtails and pony rides. They're sophisticated. They sip on lattes. And have their eyes on a bigger prize. We shake our fists and say, ""Well good golly we're mad. That God kills children with our very own hands"". We claim innocence and not to understand. Or do we, do we?. come on all you merry men. Rally your cry. dance with the devil for tomorrow we'll surely. Hey, hey blow the men down. Blow the men down. Hey."

down,"Take me down to the water. Where the cold wind blows. Take me out to the wildlife, baby. The red light meets the crossbow. I will take you there, I will take you there........ Down. The exit sign always leads to the west. Bar stools begin to cry. Jupiter looks for a cosmic sign. Still you wonder why. I will take you there, Will you take me there?........ Down. Underneath the twilight. Stars begin to sigh.....still you wonder why. You can't think of any words to say (note: this line changes almost every. night). Take me out to the strawberry fields. The sun drips like honey through my hair. Let the warm lights fill me up. L.A. or anywhere. I will take you there, I will take you there........ Down."

down so long,"Down So Long. Sun sets 'cross the ocean. I'm a thousand miles from anywhere. My pocketbook and my heart both just got stolen. And the sun act like she don't even care. The wind blows cold when you reach the top. It feels like someone's face is stuck to the bottom of my shoe. I got a plastic Jesus, a cordless telephone for every corner of my room. Got everybody but you telling me what to do. CHORUS. But I 've been down so long. Ooh, it can't be longer still. I’ve been down so long. That the end must be drawing near. I look to everybody but me to answer my prayers. ’Til I saw an angel in a bathroom. Who said she saw no one worth saving anywhere. And a blind man on the corner said it's simple, like flipping a coin. Don't matter what side it lands on if it's someone else's dime. CHORUS. I take a trip, I catch a train, I catch a plane. I got a ticket in my hand. And then a man takes my money. And like cattle we all stand. CHORUS."
dreamer,"Don’t wanna hear no sad songs. I say to the darkness. But it doesn’t respond. I ask if I sing a new one. Will I always sing alone?. For so long I have known only sorrow. How could I fail to hear?. The sound of all the sleeping hearts. The timid hopefuls. Waiting for a path to be clear. I can hear a sweet melody beneath it all. It says “Brave Dreamer, dream anew. And you won’t always dream by yourself. You won’t dream by yourself. Everybody’s gonna sing along”. Loneliness has bit my heart. I know its wounded your heart, too. But our longing is our revolution. It’s gonna bring a world anew. I can hear a sweet melody beneath it all. It says “Brave Dreamer, dream anew. And you won’t always dream by yourself. You won’t dream by yourself. Everybody’s gonna sing along”. Is it possible?. Is it possible?. Is it possible?. I can hear a sweet melody beneath it all. And it says “Be brave Dreamer, dream anew. And you won’t always dream by yourself. No, you won’t dream by yourself. No, you won’t dream by yourself. Everybody’s gonna sing along”"
drive to you,"Tonight I have the strangest feeling. Look for answers on a hotel ceiling. When did my heart first feel this way?. Being alone used to be just fine.. Now life without you is just passing time.. I thought I heard you call my name.. Reached for you're hand, it was in vein.. When you're here, it feels like a hole in my chest.. Get dressed, look in the mirror, say. ""You're heart will never be the same."". So I drive to you tonight. I was blind, now I have sight.. I could not leave you even if I tried.. You're heart beats inside of me.. Like a star in the dark of night,. Like birds lost in flight.. The clouds in the sky are blue. I belong with you.. I've been together, but alone.. I've made love without love being shown.. I've seen sorrow in a pair of dice,. All things that came in two's made me cry. Until tonight.. So I drive to you tonight. I was blind, now I have sight.. I could not leave you even if I tried.. You're heart beats inside of me.. Like a star in the dark of night,. Like birds lost in flight.. The clouds in the sky are blue. I belong with you.. Can't stop, won't stop.. Love is all we've got. Know how much I love ya. When I put my arms around you. Can't stop, won't stop. You are all I want. So I drive to you tonight. I was blind, now I have sight.. I could not leave you even if I tried.. You're heart beats inside of me.. Like a star in the dark of night,. Like birds lost in flight.. The clouds in the sky are blue, yea. The clouds in the sky are blue. I belong with you."
electric fan,"An electric fan. That keeps me company tonight. It's nights like this make. It easy to forget. Why we used to fight. ...It also makes it easy. To forget the words.... ...Right.... An electric fan. That keeps me company tonight. It's nights like this make. It easy to forget. Why we used to fight. Love is an ember. Born to burn out. Well, I wish it would. No, I don't feel that good. Lately they blend. And blur with the scenery. Crowded rooms make it easy. To forget I'm lonely. The cat puked in my shoe. Guess it's fitting it would. But I, I don't feel that good. Regret's a useless word. Usually I try to avoid it. But sometimes it gets so quiet. That I can't remember the morals. But the part I can't admit. When you're thinking out loud. Is just a whisper. That feels like a shout. Oh, God, I made a mistake. I can't breathe without you. The cars driving by. They throw their lights. Against the wall. I should go to bed. Get out of this chair. And turn the TV off. Oh goody! I get to go to bed alone!. If I could get excited I would. No, I don't feel that good."
emily,"Woke up to find. I lost my mind. Lost heart, lost nerve. I lost my favourite word -. Emily. I take my cigarettes. I give 'em a smoke. Oh god. My heart feels froze. I've lost something it seems. I've misplaced my favourite thing -. Emily. CHORUS. Where does love go. If it can't find a home. One moment here then gone. With no forwarding address. Love no longer has a house. Or residence in flesh. Take the keys. I get in the car. To out run this. Man I'd have to go real far. Where mercy wears lace. And bottles are thieves. Which of these took you from me?. Emily. I face myself. But there's this draft inside. Parts of me drowned. In perpetual tide. I wanna call names. I wanna throw things around. But no bar can buy. Forgiveness another round for. Emily. CHORUS. I go to the bedroom. Turn on the light. It's like an empty altar. No angel in sight. religion with no temple. No place to take my worship to. No god for my eyes to see. No fruit to lay at the feet of. Emily. Gone. Gone."
enter from the east,"Enter From The East - album: Spirit. Jewel. I went out a-wandering. Beneath an unknown sky. the heavens al shook violently. He caught my eye. Strange fruit fell. It struck me to the core. My heart became a single flame. It wanted nothing more. Stranger, enter from the east. Stranger, step inside this place. Oh, and own me, own me,. The clock became a bullet hole. Cruel and unkind. It hurt me with its second hand. Alone another night. Stranger, enter from the east. Stranger, step inside this place. Blue, is that you?. Well, don't bother knocking on my door this time. Blue, go be true for someone else. There's no room inside this heart of mine. My heart has four empty rooms. Three wait for lightning and one waits for you. I must have you all to myself. Feel the full weight of your skin. I'll hollow out my insides. To place you in. Stranger, enter from the East. Stranger, step inside this place. Oh, and own me, own me"
everybody needs someone sometime,"Mary heard boys talking in voices low. Said she weren't no spring chicken. Like she didn't already know. So she called up Jack from a few years back. She turned him down once in his one room shack. She said ""Now baby, you don't look that bad"". CHORUS:. Cuz everybody needs someone sometime. Everybody needs someone, can't you see?. Everybody needs someone sometime. Spivy Leaks was a drip of a man. He looked like a potato shoved into jeans. He recollects it wasn't that long ago. That he could walk by. Make the young girls scream. But he thought he'd just let it all slide. Let it all pass. Cuz he thought love was best on the run. He said ""Now baby, it don't seem that fun"". CHORUS. BRIDGE:. Hey there honeybee. Will you give me...sugar?. And if you shake real cute. I might give you some sugar. I was doin' alright on my own. Now I might just take you home sugar. Sister Mary used to be a nun. She thought that she'd retire and have her some fun. Mr. Joe of the Philadelphia Joes. Well he walked in the post office one night. He said ""Hey sweetheart, you know you look alright"". CHORUS to fade."
everything breaks sometime,"Everything Breaks Sometime -- Jewel. . Under the shadows, forbidden and hot. Desire grows, more often than not. I'm sorry's a stupid thing to say. Especially considering it's not like I planned it this way. But I'm sorry is all that there is left of me. I'm so sorry this love left me hollow and made you empty. Maybe I could have loved you better. Maybe you should have loved me more. Maybe our hearts were just next in line. Maybe everything breaks sometime. Everything breaks sometime. It's hard to believe its boiled down to this. It seems so surreal this won't be healed by a kiss. It's hard to stare at you knowing you like I have. I used to feel so close, now I feel so bad. My heart's filled with thunderstorms and I'm ready to burst. And I've lost my favorite harbor and I'll weather for the worst. Maybe I could have loved you better. Maybe you should have loved me more. Maybe our hearts were just next in line. Maybe everything breaks sometime. Everything breaks sometime. I'm so sorry,. everything breaks sometime."
everything reminds me of you,"[Jewel]. I walk around the room. It's funny how these silly things remind me of you. And I have this hole in my chest.

face of love,"Until tonight. My heart was just half full. I'd never known the fruit which fed the soul. But now I see what may put to rest my longing. For I have seen, the face of love. The grace of God, the face of love. In silence I feared my heart. Would remain words unheard. Inside a seperate mess of skin. But now I know that the skin just veils the soul. For I have seen, the face of love. The grace of God, the face of love. So take my hand and knowing. With it I also give my heart. Wanting to never be seperate again. Let eternity begin. If you were flame. I'd allow myself to be consumed completely. Were you wind I'd wish you to pass through me. But now I know that the skin just veils the soul. For I have seen, the face of love. The grace of God, the face of love."
fade away (i'm fading),"It's K-Mart, the bathroom. I'm staring in the mirror. The green lights are bright. It makes the lines clearer. Heard the Angel go. Cigarette smoke's all that's left.

""Hey, what happens to us. When we get old and in the way?"". I guess she answered ???. Took me away. And I am fading. I am fading. I am fading away. I am fading. Just like fairy tales.

family tree,"Mama, I see your face now in the mirror. It's getting clearer. Daddy, all those things I said I wouldn't do. I've been drawn to 'cause I looked up to you. And I've loved you through this tangled legacy. Tracing the twisted roots of our family tree. I stayed strong like you did. I moved on like you did. And I wound up tough as stone like you did. If I don't learn to bend I know I'm going to break. Like you did. Lover, I must forgive you. I confused you with what I couldn't see inside of me. Dark things pulling, not evolving. It made a puppet out of me. And you came with your own history. Both caught in the branches of our family tree. I stayed strong like you did. I moved on like you did. And I wound up all alone like you did. If I don't learn to bend, I know I'm gonna break just like you did. I love you but I need to look at who we've been. Take the fruit but choose the seeds I scatter in the wind. That's the job of the kid: To do better than our parents did. So I'll stay strong like you did. And I'll move on like you did. But I won't hide from the truth like you did. I'm learning to bend so I won't break. And you can bet I'll teach my child. That love will always find a way just like you did"

foolish games,"You took your coat off and stood in the rain. You were always crazy like that. I watched from my window. Always felt I was outside looking in on you. You were always the mysterious one. With dark eyes and careless hair. You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care. Then you stood in my doorway, with nothing to say. Besides some comment on the weather. Well in case you failed to notice. In case you failed to see. This is my heart bleeding before you. This is me down on my knees. Chorus. These foolish games are tearing me apart. Your thoughtless words are breaking my heart. You're breaking my heart. You were always brilliant in the morning. Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee. Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you. You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones. As I clumsily strummed my guitar. You'd teach me of honest things. Things that were daring, things that were clean. Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean. So I hid my soiled hands behind my back. Somewhere along the line I must've gone off track with you. Excuse me, guess I've mistaken you for somebody else. Somebody who gave a damn. Somebody more like myself. Chorus. You took your coat off and stood in the rain. You were always crazy like that"
forever and a day,"The other day you asked me to. Tell you how much I love you. Oh, but words so often fail. To describe the depth and scale. And even though it may sound cliche’. I’ll tell you now in my simple way. My love is as true as the oceans are blue. And I’ll always feel this way. Just listen to the beating that keeps repeating. My heart wants to say. Like Gala and Dali, It’s you and me. Forever and a day. Forever and a day. Always. You watch me turn out the light. Wrap my arms around you, say goodnight. Trace our shadows on the wall. Thank God for the miracle of it all. My love is true as the oceans are blue. And I’ll always feel this way. Just listen to the beating that keeps repeating. My heart wants to say. Like Gala and Dali, It’s you and me. Forever and a day. Forever and a day. Always. The road of life winds. With the passing of time. I can hear you say. How can hearts know. Where love will go. Beyond today. Just listen to the beating that keeps repeating. My heart wants to say. Like Gala and Dali, It’s you and me. Forever and a day. Forever and a day. Always"

good day,"I say to myself. Self, why are you awake again? It's one a.m.. Standing with the fridge door wide open, staring. Such a sight, florescent light. The stars are bright. Might make a wish, if I believed in that shit. As it is, I might watch TV. Cause it's nice to see people more messed up than me. I say to myself, as I smile at the wall, let myself fall. It's gonna be all right, no matter what they say. It's gonna be a good day, just wait and see. It's gonna be okay, cause I'm okay with me. It's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gotta be. I shiver, shut the door. Can't think standing here no more. I'm alone, my mine's racing, heart breaking. Can you be everything I need you to be?. Can you protect me like a daughter?. Can you love me like a father?. Can you drink me like water?. Say I'm like the desert, just hotter.. The point of it all. Is that if I should fall. Still you're name I'll call. It's gonna be all right, no matter what they say. It's gonna be a good day, just wait and see. It's gonna be okay, cause I'm okay with me. It's gonna be, it's gonna be. As long as we laugh out loud. Laugh like we're mad. Cause this crazy, mixed up beauty is all that we have. Because what's love but an itch we can't scratch, a joke we can't catch. But still we laugh. I go back upstairs, turn off the TV. You say ""I'll be okay baby, just wait and see."". It's gonna be all right, it's gonna be okay. Gonna be a good day, just wait, just see. Gonna okay, cause I'm okay with me. It's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be..."
goodbye alice in wonderland,"It's four in the afternoon I'm on a flight leaving L.A. Trying to think about my life My youth scattered along the highway. Hotel rooms and headlines, I've made a living with a song. Gguitar as my companion, wanting desperately to belong. Fame is filled with spoiled children, they grow fat on fantasy. I guess that's why I'm leaving, I crave reality. Refrão 1:. So goodbye Alice in Wonderland. Goodbye yellow brick road. There is a difference between dreaming and pretending. I did not find paradise. It was only a reflection of my lonely mind wanting. what was missing in my life. I'm embarassed to say the rest is a rock and roll cliche. I hit the bottom when I reached the top. I never knew it was you who was breaking my heart. I thought you had to love me but you did not. Yes a heart can hallucinate. If it's completely starved for love. Can even turn monsters in angels from above. You forged my love like a weapon. And turned it against me like a knife. You broke my last heartstring but you opened up my eyes. Refrão 2 :. So goodbye Alice in Wonderland. Goodbye yellow brick road. There is a difference between dreaming and pretending. That was not love in your eyes. It was only a reflection of my lonely mind searching. what's been missing in my life. And growing up is not the absence of dreaming. It's being able to understand the difference between the ones you can hold. And the ones that you've been sold. Dreaming is a good thing cause it brings new things to life. Pretending is an ending that perpetuates a lie. Forgetting what you are. Sing for what you've been told. Well, truth is stranger than fiction. And this is my chance to get it right. Life is much better without all of your pretty lies. So Goodbye Alice in Wonderland. You can keep your yellow brick road. there is a difference between dreaming and pretending. These are not tears in my eyes. They are only a reflection of my lonely mind finding. They are only a reflection of my lonely mind finding. I found what was missing in my life. Camila Colla"

grey matter,"I hate you, I love you. Leave, please don't go away. Can't decide if I like your face. Or if I wish it would stray. You're a child but you're malicious. You're sweet but don't remember my name. And heads you win and tails I'm lost. And love equals pain. I am drifting without an anchor. Through your ambigous region. A strange continent immune to all reason. And I'm flattered by your grey matter. Inside my skin, I feel your tongue. Telling me I'm dirty and licking my bones. A surge against silence, a knife across a plate. Makes the sound of need on hate. I am drifting without an anchor. Through your ambigous region. A strange continent immune to all reason. And I'm flattered by your grey matter. And I do not understand why a woman can't just love a man. You're amusing you're a real cool show. With your meat hooks and barbed wire carnival. You got glitter in your pocket. You got mothballs in your soul. From too many false teeth and greasy flash bulbs. I am drifting without an anchor. Through your ambigous region. A strange continent immune to all reason. And I'm flattered by your grey matter. I love you. I hate you."

here when gone,I am a woman haunted by hands. Even though I'm alone. Traces of Pompey. Across my skin. And an invisible map. Of where you've been. It's dry road to Idaho. A thirsty tongue across the land. And soil so dry. You could swallow an entire man. Took the first road out of town. Hoping that you were just skin deep. Well I feel you like. Some sort of phantom limb. Beside me when I sleep. Cause you are here when gone. You are here when gone. You are here when gone. You are here when gone. I watch another grey day unfold. It's dusty wings. Sometimes I wish I were more like. Rocks and stones and things. Sometimes I wish my heart. Were not like flowers at all. That way I wouldn't get butterflies. When you called. begin extra. And the night swallows itself. You can see it in the stars. The moon blinks it's tired eyes. I may be a thousand miles to nowhere. Does that make me lost or found?. Oh - is it that relative to if you're around?. end extra. And some birds abandon their young. Cause the instinct is too strong to fly. Well I feel like abandoning. My guitar and my books and I'm afraid. I don't know why. Cause you are here when gone. You are here when gone. You are here when gone. You are here when gone.
his pleasure is my pain,"A man stands in the doorway like a small child. angry fists. she lies on her bed her head buried in her pillow. and she stares at the moon. he speaks to her all the words shes heard too many times before. and pretty soon she just let's his voice fade away. and she thinks.... This was a gradual steel frost. that started with cold feet. and ended with numb hearts. This was once satisfying sex but now no longer is. It was once filled with the possibilities of new china or old stone. but now it's exagerated and waterlogged no longer what these. hands had. intended and still I cry in my sleep. He always said I was too sensitive,. but I say. (chorus). at least I never meant to make him cry.. At least I never meant to make him hurt that way. Nooo I never meant to make him cry. Never meant to make him hurt that way. Yes it's true, I'm too senstive. but he takes pleasure in my pain.. Yes it's true, I'm too senstive. but he takes pleasure in my pain.. And the unheard hours they fly by. she goes to the window. she puts on a nightgown and brushes her hair. he's already asleep. by the time she. goes and lays herself back down.. she thinks. my god, what am i doing hear?. My bones have grown tired of his hunger, of his gray eyes,. and I feel if I were to stay one more night here I'd die or explode. or worse yet just fade away.. There have been days so dark that I felt like august. and that I soon too would turn to fall.. he always said I was too sensitive that if I cared so much. the world could kill me that way.. I wonder if he's only half alive or if he's simply always been this. inarticulate,. cause i say. And she get's out of bed and looks at her feet as though they. were the wings for her freedom. she gets up and goes to the door. it's a moment in which anything can happen. instead she gets out some clothing. puts it in a bag and leaves him sleeping. while she heads for the door.."
hotel angel (aka moon over austin),"Sweet man, sweet mystery. Unveil yourself to me. Sweet soul, lie so still. Flesh cup, gonna get my fill. Let me rise and fall. With the wings of your sheets. While the moon's full over Austin. The city sleeps below. Only the moon bears witness. To my hotel angel. Through the window. Your body be a tender vine. That twists and turns just like mine. Your heart a slender thong. Built of honey, filled with song. 'Til dawn steals you from me. And takes me to the next town. But tonight the moon's full over Austin. And beggars starve below. And only the moon bears witness. To my hotel angel. Through the window. There's one thing that keeps me going. It's the slow and easy knowing. You're the kind of man. Who's kind of girl could maybe give her hand. So sweet man in your sweet misery. Lie upon my temporary sea. Love's dressing, I will adorn. To my side your absence be thorn. And I'll rock you gently to sleep. Tonigh is one promise we both can keep. While the moon's full over Austin. And the city sleeps below. And only the moon bears witness. To my hotel angel. Through the window. Hotel Angel. Through the window."
i do,"We have been doing this war dance together. For some time, I know.. Treating our love like a battlefield,. Taking it slow.. Will you blink. What do you think. The union we propose.

We have heaven to gain and hell to lose. And the difference is up to me and you. So if you will, I will stop saying I won't. And start saying I do. Well our hearts are locked inside. An iron box. We're both too afraid to reveal. Our most tender parts, oh. 'Cause love is a game until it's played. And if you lose, you can't ever be saved. We have heaven to win but hell to lose. The difference is up to me and you. So if you will, I will stop saying I won't. Stop saying I can't. Is that what you said?. Cause if you did, I do.. I do.. If you want me to,. I do."

i love you forever,"You and I walking slowly. Hand in hand. Footprints in the sand. Watch the wind as it plays. Throwing shadows across your face. The sky was so blue. Your eyes so green. The air glittering. So sudden, so swift. Love came to us. Just like a gift. I lived here, you lived far away. Our lives called us back, no we could not stay. With a sad sort of smile you took my hand. Said while we're apart you hope I understand that.... Chorus:. You'll be holding me. And I'll be holding you. Through those long nights. My love will be pulling you through. When you see the stars. Pretend they're my arms. When you feel the air. That is me kissing you there. Say you love me. And I will say I love you. No distance could ever make that untrue. When I'm far away. I'll reach through time and space. When you hear the wind. You'll hear me saying. I love you forever. Fast forward our love story. I still remember that day. Her small precious face. You stared into her eyes. Hypnotized by her smile. But your job meant you had to travel. But we weren't ready for you to go. You held our daughter with a sad sort of smile. Said while we're apart I want you to know that.... Repeat Chorus. God forbid there'll come a day. When the light in my eyes fades away. But from your hearts I will not go. No bounds shall my spirit know, cause. Repeat Chorus 2x"
i thought i saw you last night,I'm not easily scared by things that go bump in the night. Theres not many things that give me a fright. I can walk down a lonely block. And not alot can make my old knees knock. But theres one thing that scares me the most. Its when I think I see a ghost. And I thought I saw you last night. Ive been lately thinking about oujia board. And maybe contacting souls seated by the lord. Cause all the shadows on my street. Bring the sounds of shuffeling feet. But theres one thing that scares me the most. Its when I think I see a ghost. And I thought I saw you last night. Threw salt over my shoulder. I knocked on wood. Dont step on cracks. But it does no good. I drink bourbon to calm my nerves. Read an old book and chant some verse. Hold hot coals in the middle of my fists. Take advice from my exorcist. Hallelujah hail mary. Holy moly this is scary. For instance last night I went to a scary movie. And I tried real hard not to let it get to me. But I just kept looking over my shoulder. The wind got hands and I got colder. But theres one thing that scares me the most. Its when I think I see a ghost. And I thought I saw you last night. I'm not easily scared by things that go bump in the night.
i won't walk away,"A lonely street lamp. I'm out on the street walking home. A small pale blur. Leaving trails like a snail I move so slow. Time can bruise violent indigo. Rush home to your arms. You soothe my weary soul. Chorus:. Wrong or right, be mine tonight. Harsh world be damned, we'll make a stand. Love can bind, but mine is blind. Others stray, but I won't walk away. Walk away. The clubs are full. Of couples resisting being one. They wear their youth. Like badges that tarnish all too soon. But we'll be a team. Our two will be one. Love will be our fortress. When all else comes undone. Chorus. Sometimes the world don't make sense. Small children filled with violence. Let our light. Shine through the night. Chorus. I won't walk away. (repeated till fade out)"
i wonder as i wander,i wonder as i wander / out under the sky / how jesus the savior did come to die / to save lowly people / like you and like i / i wonder as i wander / out under the sky. when jesus was born / it was in a cow's stall / with shepherds and wise men / and angels and all / the blessings of christmas / from heaven did fall / and the weary world woke / to the savior's call. . .
i'm leaving on a jet plane,by themessenger. (aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh). (aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh). All my bags are paked I'm ready to go. I'm standing here outside your door. I hate to wake you up to say good-bye. But the dawn is breaking it's early morn. The taxi's waitin he's blowin his horn. Already I'm so lonesome I could die. So kiss me and smile for me tell me that you'll wait for me. Hold me like you'll never let me go. Cause I'm leavin on a jet plane. I don't know when I'll be back again. Oh babe I hate to go. (aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh). There's so many times I let you down. So many times I played around. But tell you now. They don't mean a thing. Every place I go I think of you. Every song I sing I sing for you. When I come come back I'll wear you wedding ring. So kiss me and smile for me tell me that you'll wait for me. Hold me like you'll never let me go. Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane. I don't know when I'll be back again. Oh babe I hate to go. And now the time has come to leave you. One more time let me kiss you.

Oh kiss me and smile for me tell me that. you'll wait for me. Hold me like you'll never let me go. Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane. I don't know when I'll be back again. Oh babe I hate to go.

Leaving on a jet plane.... Leaving on a jet plane...
i'm sensitive,I was thinking that I might fly today. Just to desprove all the things that you say. It doesn't take a talent to be mean. 'Cause words can crash things that are unseen. So... please be careful with me. I'm sensitive and I'd like to stay that way. You always tell me that it's impossibel. To be respected and be a girl. Why is it gotta be so complicated?. Why do you gotta tell me if I'm hated?. Please be careful with me. I'm sensitive and I'd like to stay that way.. I was thinking that it might do some good. If we robbed the cinics and took all their food. That way what they believe will have taken place. And will give it to everybody who have some faith. Please be careful with me. I'm sensitive and I'd like to stay that way. I have this theory that if we're told we're bad. Than that's the only idea we'll ever have. But maybe if we are surronded in beauty. Someday we will become what we see. And anyone can started a conflict. It's harder yet to disreguarded it. I'd rather see the world from another angle. Please be careful with me. I'm sensitive and I'd like to stay that way
i've got the blues more than you do blues,"Grew up in the Mississippi delta. In a shotgun shack. Washboard for my pillow. 'Til the tax man took that back. Moved out on my own. I was just eight years old ... top that. You think you got the blues. Look at my life. I've got the blues more than you do ... blues. When I was an itty-bitty baby. I was my mama's only surviving son. She used my head as a washrag. I thought it was fun. Walked to school upway both ways. With no legs ... top that. You think you got the blues. Look at my life. I've got the blues more than you do ... blues. . Got so drunk the other night I couldn't find my way home. Had to have a blind man show me. When I finally did get there,. My own dog had disowned me. A womam in a bar just looks at me and coughed and said. ""I don't even know you, but I wish you'd die off"" ... top that. You think you got the blues. Look at my life. I've got the blues more than you do ... blues."
if this is what love is,Somewhere between right and wrong is a love song. Its tongue hits the target but its phone number is always wrong. It speaks through calluses of gentler things. It speaks of kindness. But I don't think you know what that word means. Your love is a bitter seed that only the blind can see. If this is what love is. Then I guess there's no love song left in me. Somewhere between right and wrong is reality. Justice and shame speak foolishly of impractical things. Your kisses are as kind as candles. your hands are as giving as stone. Your mind is kind as Hitler's until night leaves you feeling alone. Your love is something I must do but never be. If this is what love is. Then I guess there's no love song left in me. I didn't mean to fall into darkness. It's just that I trip in the lights. Cause aw man it's hard to see that clearly and not put up a fight. But I knew Ithen would break and not bend. Just look at this trouble I'm in. I need to realize. This is how the unhappy half dies. Somewhere between good and bad is every lie I have ever been told. They all come down but good deeds don't count it's what cards you hold. But I'm tired of your grey laughter. I am tired of your hungry eyes. This love is so rotten. It's startin' to attract flies. Your love is something that must do but never be. Its blade is made of jealousy and insecurity. Your love is a bitter seed that only the blind can see. If this is what love is. If this is what love is. Then I guess there's no love song left in me..

In the impala of my love (doo wop doo wop). Baby of my love (doo wop doo wop). Baby of my love (doo wop doo wop). Baby of my love.

innocence maintained,"Innocence Maintained - album: Spirit. Jewel. Ophelia drowned in the water. Crushed by her own weight Hitler loved little blue eyed boys. And it drove him to hate. Birds always grow silent before the night descends. 'Cause nature has a funny way of breaking what does not bend. A hero's torso built of steel and Novocain. His heart a bitter beat inside a bloodless frame. There was a hole inside his soul a manicure could not fill. So he fund himself a whore to love while daisies choked in the window sill. We've made houses for hatred. It's time we made a place. Where people's souls may be seen and made safe. Be careful with each other. These fragile flames. For innocence can't be lost. It just needs to be maintained. A small town in Ohio. Two boys are filled with violence. And darkness spreads its legs for hate and ignorance. We are given to a god to put our faith therein. But to be forgiven, we must first believe in sin. We've made houses for hatred. It's time we made a place. Where people's souls may be seen and made safe. Be careful with eachother. These fragile flames. For without fear. I want always to feel the wings of grace near. We all will be Christed wen we hear ourselves say. We are that which we pray. We've made houses for hatred. It's time we made a place. Where people's souls maybe seen and made safe. Be careful with each other. These fragile flames. We've built houses for hatred. It's time we made a place. Where people's souls may be seen and made safe. Be careful with each other. These fragile flames. For innocence can't be lost. It just needs to be maintained"
intro,"Intro (Spoken as an intro to ""I'm Sensitive""). Okay, I gotta think about it. I was really bummed when I wrote this.. Because it's funny, when you grow up in a place like Alaska it's so. beautiful and it's really easy to have some faith, you know what I. mean? And faith after all is what carries you through, like, the. darkest of days. You just have to believe time will pass, somehow the. tide will come back in and I won't feel so incredibly shitty tomorrow.. And it's hard 'cause like people lose faith, you know, when you're. surrounded by crime and murder and pollution everyday. But it's really. what like makes everything okay. And I think if we could just be.... (Jewel starts talking to an audience member). Shut up I'm talking. That was obnoxious girl. I was kidding. God, I'm. insulting people. (laughter). So anyway I just thought maybe if we could be surrounded in beauty. we'd become what we see. 'Cause all we're told in the news is how evil. we are and how racist we are and all these things.."
intuition,"I’m just a simple girl. In a high-tech digital world. I really try 2 understand. All the powers that rule this land. They say Ms. J's big butt is boss. Kate Moss can't find a job. In a world of postmodern fad. What was good now is bad. It's not hard to understand. Just follow this simple plan. CHORUS. Follow your heart. Your intuition. It will lead u in the right direction. Let go of your mind. Your intuition. Is easy to find. Just follow your heart, baby. you look at me but you’re not quite sure. Am I it, or could u get more?. U learn cool from magazines. U learned love from Charlie Sheen. If u want me, let me know. I promise I won’t say no. CHORUS. You’ve got somethin' that you’re wantin' to sell. Sell your sin, just cash in. You’ve got somethin’ that you’re wantin’ to tell. ""You’ll. love me, wait and see"". If u want me, don't play games. I promise it won't be in vain. CHORUS. (by m4rok4s)"
jessica,"He used to walk with Jessica. Down to the diner. They'd sit and talk for hours. About nothin' in particular. Just bullshit the time away. That's what she used to say. She'd wrinkle her nose when she said it. That's how you know she meant it. Jessica. Jessica. She'd call him at nine a.m.. To see how sleep had been treatin' him. And though they were never lovers. They were soulmates under cover. They'd drink beer and sit around. Or just sit still and not make a sound. And he would shudder to think. Of what life would be like. Without his best friend -slash- shrink. Jessica. Bridge:. She's an angel at his table. Forced to feel but not to see. Blinded by her absence. Haunted by her memory. If only you were able to see the angel at your table. He got a phone call. From her mother. He said, ""Yeah, right stop kidding around."". He felt his heart fall to the ground. Since then everyday. Seems to feel like winter. Everything is colorless. As he can't see it with her. Jessica. Jessica. He could easily have been with her. Driving home in the car. It was her birthday. It's sick how things work out that way. Now at night when he sleeps. A watch over him she keeps. She whispers in his ear. For his heart to hear. Jessica. Jessica. It's amazing how a soul can leave. Suddenly from a body. Rendering it useless. And stealing its desire to breathe. One moment here then gone. With no forwarding address. Love no longer has a house. Residence in flesh. Religion without a temple. No place to take your worship to. No God for the eyes to see. No fruit to lay at the feet. of Jessica. Jessica. If only you were able to see. The angel at your table. Then you'd understand why. You never got to say goodbye. To Jessica. There's no such word as goodbye. For Jessica. She's always standing by. Jessica. Transcribed by James Reach"

just passing time,I like the way that you come. Running up to me. It sort of reminds me of. Black and white movies. And I will put a white dress on and. By the window wait. For my Richard Gere to come. *or. For my Marlin Brando to come. Crashing through the gate. Sometimes I talk on the phone. Until my ears are numb. My friends all say it's because. I can't face anyone. I know I'm just passing time. I'm just passing time. Saw you walking downtown. To the video store. Saw you with another girl. I'm sure she was a whore. You say she means nothing to you. Thus nothing to me. Excuse me while I get drunk. On too much bad T.V.. Sitting here and I'm waiting. For your mouth to open up. And start overflowing. Like Jesus' cup. And I'm just passing time. I'm just passing time.
just so happens,"Just so happens that IæŠ¦ tired of your face. Just so happens that IæŠ¦ tired of this place. Just so happens that I can not endure. The pain and the suffering thatæŠ¯ caused when I touch you anymore. Just so happens that IæŠ¦ tired of this song. Cuz everything I ever tried to do just came out wrong. And every honest thing I ever tried to do. Was turned to pain and misery when laid before the godly feet of you. [chorus]. ThereæŠ¯ no words left to say. Cuz all the words between us have already gone away. It just so happens that my flesh is turning pale. And pieces of me are disappearing as though my hands were whales. And it just so happens beauty, you could never recognize. And I simply faded away, before your eyes. Just so happens that these last two years. Been a completely meaningless waste of my tears. And if I had a toothpick for every vow you made. IæŠŽ build a boat of your promises, and IæŠŽ sail away. *chorus. Just so happens itæŠŽ take a swift kick to the heart. To make you take back everything that you said. Just so happens that we stuck around too long. We should have abandoned ship, rather than go down with it, now itæŠ¯. gone. Just so happens that I hate your mother-in-law. And I hate your dog, Henry, IæŠŽ like to fondle him with a saw. Just so happens that IæŠ¦ walking out the door.

kiss the flame,"Kiss The Flame - album: Spirit. Jewel. Please love let's make no impartial vow. Let all fall away. That's not crucial now. I want to brave love, one that makes me weak in the knees. I want a crazy, crazy love. One that makes me come undone at the seams. 'Cause I'm tired of all these pilgrims, these puritans, these thieves. Of all these unbelievers. who whittle love down at the knees. Let these swift roads destroy themselves. Let the world fall into its sleep. For we shall be spared. We shall be left standing. To face what's left of concrete and honey. Kiss the flame. Let's run with the hunted, the untamed. Kiss the flame. Embrace the faceless, the unnamed. Kiss the flame. There are nightmares on the sidewalks. There are jokes on TV. There are people selling thoughtlessness. with such casualty. But wherefore art thou Romeo. where have all the brave men gone. Show me one man who know his own heart. To him I shall belong. Kiss the flame. Let's run with the hunted, the untamed. Kiss the flame. Embrace the faceless, the unnamed. Kiss the flame.

last dance rodeo,"Your lungs fill up with concrete. Her voice is all you can hear. Red lips and a screwdriver. Wrapped around some mink-clad smear. And you know that she's a diamond.

Light bulbs, and nylons. And plastic chandeliers. Objects are only objects,. They can't feel when you're near.. And tangerine lips. And lily-white breasts. These things are eternal. Inside them humanity rests.. The skin is like a seashell. You listen to the soul. Like an old-time radio show.. But under the gas lamp. The air is thick and velvety. Your bones filled with hunger. Your heart filled with longing. You're no longer human. You're an insatiable hole. You wanna bury your face forever. In the navel of her soul. 'Cause you know .... All you need is a heart to call home. That's all. But don't wander too far. On one constant star. Darkness exists, except where you are. Your feet are filled with wandering. They follow your own.

And fame, all you maidens,. but don't resist to long. But at least look behind you. And see your own shadow's gone. Don't you know it's the last rodeo. You gotta find yourself a cowboy. Or someone to keep you. Warm when it cold. But under the gas lamp. The air is thick and velvety. Your bones filled with hunger. Your heart filled with longing. You're no longer human. You're an insatiable hole.. You wanna bury your face forever. In the navel of her soul. 'Cause you know .... All you need is a heart to call home. All you need is a heart. All you need is a heart to call home. That's all.."

life's a great big mystery show,Went downtown just to be a martyr. but a telephone pole beat me to it. it was covered in barbed wire. Saw a little boy's white teeth. like wild horses encaged by an iron string. Oh god...does not feel good unless he bleeds. And daily crucifictions are hung up on street signs. they use all sorts of names. hope they never use mine. these consonants and vowels. that cannot scream nor howl. only just hang around. Oh god...how'd things get so turned around. and in the office building. 9 to 5 goes on trial. the man is startin to crack. but the ceiling stones smile. and the boss comes in. to see what fragile things. his dull and pointless tongue can tear. Oh god...he combed over a baldspot with a bit of hair. Cause everybody needs. somebody else to blame. they can't curse themselves. they take their doctor's name in vain. they'd rather jump through hoops. and theraputic groups. than in their own minds delve. oh god...why don't we believe in ourselves. Sometimes. I think. Life is just a movie. and these. strangers. are folks we really know. sit back. relax. enjoy some popcorn. Life's a great big mystery show. Saw tiny faces that are tattered and torn. but there's paint upon the mansion that is hardly worn. I'd like to go inside. but why I don't know. as though I could peel the paint. and feed it to the poor. oh god...can't live like this anymore. my landlord..no.... my neighbor is as tolerant as a feeding shark. but they tell me that her bite is much better than her bark. she goes ramblin on. from dusk until dawn. sayin I should try bein' like her sometime. oh god...think somethin's died inside her mind. cause. sometimes.... Life's a great big mystery show.
little bird song,"There's a little bird. Somebody sent down to Earth. To live along the wind. Blowing on the wind. And she sleeps on the wind. This little bird, somebody sent. Light and fragile. And feathered sky blue. Thin and graceful. The sun shining through. She flies so high up in the sky. Way out of reach of human eyes. Light and fragile. And feathered sky blue. Thin and graceful. The sun shining through. She flies so high up in the sky. Way out of reach of human eyes. Light and fragile. And feathered sky blue. Thin and graceful. The sun shining through. And the only time that she touches ground. Is when that little bird, little bird. Is when that little bird, little bird. Is when that little bird, little bird. Is when that little bird dies."
little sister,"Hey little sister I heard you went to Mr. So and So,. Knocking on his door again last night,. Said you needed it bad. You know that ain't right. 'Cause so many times you've come to me crying. Trying to stop. you said it hurts so bad. But please don't let you. Go back for more. My little sister is a Zombie in a body. With no soul in a role she has learned to play. In a world today where nothing else matters. But it matters, we gotta start feeding our souls. Not our addiction or afflictions of pain. To avoid the same questions we must. Ask ourselves to get any answers. We gotta start feeding our souls. Have been lost to the millions with lots. Who feed on addiction selling pills and what's hot. I wish I could save her from all their delusions. All the confusion. Of of a nation that starves for salvation. But clothing is the closest to approximation to God. And He only knows that drugs. Are all we know of love. Every day we starve while we eat white bread. And beer instead of a hadshake or hug. We spill the pills and sweep them. Under the rug. My little sister is a Zombie in a body. With no soul in a role she has learned to play. In a world today where nothing else matters. But it matters, we gotta start feeding our souls. Hey little sister I heard you went to Mr. So and So's.

long slow slide,"Lights are bright in the circus. The geeks and the freaks all light cigarettes and laugh at your misery. While the white of the curtain closing crushes your heart. The inertia of loneliness tears your flesh apart. Refrão:. It's a long slow slide (3x). Once the neon is gone. there's still that golden splinter at your side. His manners are charming. But who are you fooling?. You're still nobody's bride. and Bukowski's widow. Haunts each empty seat on the ferries wheel. As ghoulish lovers collide in a collage of kisses that they steal. Refrão. And outside your window you can see the circus it's lurching. with rings of smoke. You laugh halfheartedly at the punchline. Not realizing they've made you the joke. And inside you're heart, a war is raging. A region still untamed. The worst fear I can imagine is for the mystery to be named. Is for the mystery to be named. Refrão. . Camila Colla"
louisa and her blue guitar,"A naked thigh has much to talk about. If it's just approached right.. Just like girls who talk too much. In crowded barrooms like last night.. Just like our Lisa, ain't that right?. Conversations overheard,. Sacred silver dollars become petty change.. Suddenly red lipstick finds itself. On the wrong side of her age.. Just like our Lisa, ain't that strange?. And washed nylons bleed dirty tears. From a stranger's window pane.. The red light cannot change the mood. Of the blue guitar that's played. Blue guitar.. The sound of painted nails are playing.. Hi-ho silver, add another glass.. Good intentions can beat up sick attention. And Louisa finishes last.. ""Oh goody, ain't life a blast."". Hollow glance.. May I have this dance?. The face's been worn and thin. 'Cause she's been wishing on too many stars again.. Washed nylons bleed dirty tears. >From a stranger's window pane.. The red light cannot change the mood. Of the blue guitar that's played.. Blue guitar.. Blue guitar.. Get in the car.. James Reach, Jewel Lyric Archive."
love by you (cowboy waltz),"Oh the night draws on and on. Now that you're gone. Now that you're far away. My thoughts seem to stray. I sit alone and stare. Even though you're not there. Even though you're not mine. Forever I'll pine. You may call me foolish. Oh I try and you know it'll be true. But I don't wanna be loved. By anybody but you. No, I don't want to be loved. By anybody but you. Sit alone all day. Hours pass that way. Wishing you were here. Holding me dear. You may call me foolish. Oh try and you know it'll be true. But I don't wanna be loved. By anybody but you. No I don't want to be loved. By anybody but you. At night when I'm home. I listen for the phone. Waiting for it to ring. At night in my bed. Thoughts go wonderin'. If you feel the same. You may call me foolish. Oh try and you know it'll be true. But I don't wanna be loved. By anybody but you. No, I don't want to be loved. By anybody but you"
love is a garden,"I'm sitting here lately. Thinking about us maybe. Taking a break was a good thing. 'Cause we were just children. Following a feeling. Not knowing love could wither away. But looking back it passed so softly. But common strangers we could not see. Just tired of fighting tired of hanging on. But now that you're gone I can see. That love is a garden if you let it go. It fades away before you know. And love is a garden it needs help to grow. Ours is starving but there's still hope. Come on, baby, and I'll feed ya on kisses. Come on, baby, let's make up for what we've been missing. Come on, baby, baby, come home. Living with each other. Soon we discovered just how tryin' it could be. You'd stay out all night and you'd say I was uptight. And soon we were only fighting. But looking back from this side now. It's hard to imagine wonder how. I thought it was you who was always wrong. But I can see. That love is a garden if you let it go. It fades away before you know. And love is a garden it needs help to grow. Ours is starving but there's still hope. Come on, baby, and I'll feed ya on kisses. Come on, baby, let's make up for what we've been missing. Come on, baby, baby, come home. Well, tough job, broke car, mean boss,. And our moms all squeeze like weeds they get in the way. Now you're gone and I'm here,. I'm missing you dear,. We took a break what a mistake. What we needed to do was just make some room for me and you.. Cause I can see. That love is a garden if you let it go. It fades away before you know. And love is a garden it needs help to grow.

love used to be,"Love used to be the ruler. From which you measured all. Love used to be the dizzying height. From which you wished to fall. Love used to be the white and gauzy apparition. Towering in your dreams. Love used to be. Love used to be. Love used to be the horseshoe made of iron. And always smiling up. And in your arms it gathered. All manner of silky satin golden luck.

Amen. Love used to be a sigh like petals. Gently falling down. From the flower of my lover's. Half open rosebud mouth. Love used to be the thirst, oh, and the quenching. The question in no need of answering. Love used to be. Love used to be. Love used to be hope unflinching. The dare that believed it must. Love used to be the heady drunken feeling of. Flesh heavy with lust. Love used to be the photograph of the future. Taken by one mind four eyes could see. Love used to be. Love used to be. Dig a six-foot hole. Inside my chest. Heart like a gravestone. Lay it down to rest. Goodbye love. Amen. Love used to be a miracle. The proof that God exists. As it doubled our image, immortality delivered. By the double helix.

But now I'm alone and I'm adrift and I'm lost at sea. Cause love used to be. Love used to be. Love used to be. Love used to be"

But I want to hold you. Forever in flight. 'Til we're two old flames. There's a mighty thin line. Dancing by a dim light. If you just come down, if you come down. Won't you please come down. Down off your one-legged horse. Your immortal course. Is making me blue, yeah. You're making me blue, yeah. And my body is changing.... To fit itself around your shoe.

mamma's little hero,"Every mom wants her little boy. To grow up and be a hero. Size years of age. She planted the seed. His young hands burdened. Bewildered and confused. How how the hell can a little boy satisfy a woman's needs. Nobody told him what you are. Not what she needs you to be. She made him her lover. But only through words. Inappropriate intimacy ..... And high hopes and dreams. She made him her babbot. Wound him so tight that she robbed him of his youth. Worrying about how to live up to. Expectations so high. Nobody told him what you are. Not what she needs you to be. Forever imprisoned by she. And standards that he can not hold. Till mamma's little hero sets himself free. He'll always be a man child walking. Forever frightened. By those big scary words,. Committment and need. A deep distrust that he could never satisfy. That a woman could love him for free. Say be what you are. Not what she needs you to be. Be what You are. Not what she needs you to be. Mamma's little hero."
marital carnival,"You come home, you look kind of frantic. Too bad cause I feel romantic. I know you're stressed out again. Tonight - I guess - that we're just friends again.

And your appointments have lots of good 'ointments'. ??? what you could never could satisfy. *** CHORUS ***. Cause I don't carry you like I did a minute ago. I tried to love you but it was just too stressful. It's like leavin' your boots on when you go swimming. But I never will fight for what doesn't want to win. You wake up - I'm doing cartwheels. You're grumpy. Said, ""Try some how I feel"". ""I'm happy"" just wasn't no fun. It's hard enough just waking up next to one. You know if you were oatmeal - you'd just look for lumps. If you were sweet I'd call you sugarbumps. If you were the sunshine you'd say I was. Well I am tired of this capricious game. *** Chorus. A Marital Carnival. A Marital Carnival. A Marital Carnival. Stop!. I want to get off.... Sweetheart, I'm gonna find myself a ride. One that doesn't bring me down this time. One that isn't always on the run. One that can have good old fashioned fun. Cause you know my purpose in life is nothing more. Is then to simply be a dork. I'm just like a special chocolate treat. I ain't no piece of leftover hot dogs.... *** Chorus ***. I never will fight for. No!. I never will fight for. Ruff!. I never will fight for what doesn't want to win (winning)."

memoirs of a housewife,I have a secret obsession. It's totally tupperware. My own science project. Defying wear and tear. I'm jealous of shopping carts. And all of their brand new things. I want to fondle their labels. In hopes one'll rub off on me. 'Cause everybody wants to feel brand new. Like they do. I spend my days indoors. Doing like ding-dongs do. Perfectly preserving. Myself for you. I take things out of their boxes. Take out my note pad and pen. Study carefully. 'Cause everybody wants to feel brand new. Like they do. So tell me you want me. Tell me you need me. Tell me I'll always be desirable. Especially to you. Make me feel brand new. Attractive!. Brand spanking clean. And desirable as homecoming queen. But if I were to bet. All of the frenchfries in the world. That you would say such things. I would surely be one very hungry girl. I approach china cautiously. If there's cracks I deny it. I ingest only perfect things. Into my visual diet. And at night I undress myself. In front of your favorite things. Your brand new hand-tied blue bass fishing lure. And in the corner your money clip sings. Everybody wants to feel brand new. Everybody wants to feel brand new. Like they do. As they do. I do too.

With patience, soon it'll be all too clear. Nicotine Love. *But don't get me wrong.... So go ahead touch me like that. The end is drawing near. Go ahead hurt me that way. You don't even know enough to fear. You don't know how true it is when you say. My kisses are sweet as death. But soon you'll have no more options. It's all you have left. Love is like barbed wire. I'm electric and so alone. So come here stray cat. I'm gonna take you home. I'm gonna press you like petals. Til you're fragile and bent. And I'll.... Well I'll.... Nicotine Love."
nikos,"She lived in a trailer out eastern road. Her loneliness was a disease. But my daddy couldn't see it though. Her name was Linda her smile was forced. And folks 'round town say she dressed like a divorce. My daddy had a son by her. 'though she wasn't supposed to be able. I was eight years old when they told me 'round the table. I looked at my daddy, he looked to the ground. I guessed that we'd be stickin' round ahwile. Might as well smile cause there's no point in being mean. I guess that's just what you get when you forget to dream. Got called to the principal's office. Did I do something wrong?. Doctor on the telephone said,. ""Congratulations, you've got a baby brother born."". Got sent to a psychiatrist in case I resented their child.. I was bitter in my anguish but my manner was mild.. My daddy got excommunicated from the Mormon church.. Guess an illegitimate son in God's eye has no worth. He tried to stick around but he flew the coop in spring.. He loved that baby just not Linda it seemed. But still I know we'd be stickin' round awhile. Might as well smile cause there's no point in bein' mean.. I guess that's just what you get when you forget to dream.. So Linda got remarried now my brother called that new man ""dad"". But it didn't last long I hear his temper was bad. So she said that we could see him on every other Saturday.. We all were shocked when he called my daddy ""uncle"". She said it was better that way.. They tried to get back together but it was off and on. One day she disappeared, I hear to Oregon.. I haven't seen him since. I guess I'm supposed to forget.. That he was my brother too and not just their legal mess. I thought that we'd be stickin' 'round awhile. Might as well smile 'cause there's no point in bein' mean.. I guess that's just what you get when you forget to dream.. This song is for Nikos wherever you may be. I know things were tough but you're okay by me. And your momma ain't a bad person, my daddy's ain't no fool. Sometimes parents just need forgiving too.. PS, I love you, your sister Jewel.. PS, I love you, your sister Jewel.."

no more heartaches,"Shut up, sweetheart, I want you to hear. I can no longer love the same thing I fear. I can no longer let myself stay close. To the one thing that hurts me the most. I will not kiss the thorn. Hearts don't need to bleed to know what they're for. There'll be no more heartaches. There'll be no more heartaches for me. I take back my sweetness. It's overlooked by your lust. My song is unseen. cause your touch is too tough. I don't think your hands know how to adore. The subtlety of me anymore. I unfasten myself from your side. Slip away, quiet as a sigh. There'll be no more heartaches. There'll be no more heartaches for me. can't you see , can't you see , can't you see what you love has done to me. I need you to know , you gotta know, you gotta let me go.. Beds filled with suspicion. Hearts filled with spite. We sleep with thieves. And forego our sights. Too quick to hold. someone's word over our own. You may be cool. You may know how to flatter. In the end (all I have is matter (?)). There'll be no more heartaches. There'll be no more heartaches. No more heartache anymore. anymore, oh oh oh, for me."

one left shoe,"Under the spotlight, The neon kiss. Carnival barkers preen & twist. Three for a quarter, 2 for a dime. Broken Hearts General Store--Open all the time. Chorus:. I'm lonely without you.

Me & my minions make the rounds. I'm lonely without you. Just like one left shoe. I'm lonely without you. Bridge:. I'm a little cocoon just blooming for you. I draw a deep breath, The day is new. I'm brave, I'm a hero, The world's bright & clear. But my insides shrivel when you're not here. Newspaper pile on my front porch. The sun is winding up, its starting to scorch. The air is dust & lungs are hot. I keep making love to what is not. I'm lonely without you. Just like one left shoe. I'm lonely without you."

They remind her of her lover, how he left her, and of times long ago.. When she used to color carelessly painted his portrait. A thousand times-or maybe just his smile-. And she and her canvas would follow him wherever he would go. 'Cause they were painters and they were painting themselves. A lovely world.. Oil streaked daisies covered the living room wall. He put water-colored roses in her hair. He said, ""Love, I love you, I want to give you mountains, the sunshine,. the sunset too. I want to give you everything as beautiful as you are to me. 'Cause they were painters and they were painting themselves. A lovely world.. So they sat down and made a drawing of their love, an art to live by. They painted every, passion every home, created every beautiful child. in the winter they were weavers of warmth,. in summer they were carpenters of love. They thought blue prints were too sad so they made them yellow. 'Cause they were painters and they were painting themselves. A lovely world.. Until one day the rain fell as thick as black oil. And in her heart she knew something was wrong. She went running. through the orchard screaming,. 'No God, don't take him from me!,'. But buy the time she got there, she feared he already had gone. She got to where he lay, water-colored roses in his hands for her. She threw them down screaming, 'Damn you man, don't leave me. with nothing left behind but these cold paintings, these cold portraits. to remind me!. He said, 'Love I leave, but only a little, try to understand. I put my soul in this life we created with these four hands. Love, I leave, but only a little this world holds me still. My body may die now, but these paintings are real.'. So many seasons came and many seasons went. and many times she saw her loves face watering the flowers,. talking tot he trees and singing to his children. And when the wind blew, she knew he was listening,. and how he seamed to laugh along, and how he seemed to hold her. when she was crying. 'Cause they were painters and they were painting themselves. A lovely world.. Eighty years, an old lady now, sitting on the front porch. Watching the clouds roll by, they remind her of her lover. how he left her and of times long ago, when she used to color carelessly,.

passing time,I like the way. That you come. Running up to me. It sort of reminds me. Of black and white movies. And I will put. A white dress on. And by the window wait. For my Marlon Brando. To come. Crashing through the gate. Sometimes. I talk on the phone. Until my ears are numb. My friends. All say it's because. I can't face anyone. But I know. I'm just passing time. I know. I'm just passing time. I saw you. Walking downtown. To the video store. I saw you. With another girl. I'm sure. She was a whore. And so she means. Nothing to you. And thus nothing to me. Excuse me while. I get drunk. From watching. Too much bad TV. I'm sitting here. And I'm waiting. For your mouth. To open up. And start overflowing. Just like Jesus' cup. And I'm just passing time.

poem song,"I like to call you my wild horse. (And feed you silver sage ?). I'd like to paint my poems with. desert tongued clay across her back. And ride you savagely as the sweet and southern wind. Through green and wild Kentucky. I'd like to make you my secret song. Blaze and dark and red in the orchards. And I would steal away to watch the way. Your silver belly bends and bows beneath me. I'd make you my wings in the foothills of Montana. My lover in the oceans of the world. I'd make you... of children. And I would scatter you across my green memories of home. I'd make you my hungry valley. And sow your golden fields and wheats my own. If I were a painter. I would paint you with this note. Silver traces on your skin. And if I were a writer. I would write these words on your back. In desert tongue clay, deep in (your wind?). I'd make you my secret song. Blazing in the orchard. And I would steal away. To watch the way your silver belly. Bends and bows beneath me. I'd make you my wings in the foothills of Montana. Make you my lover in the oceans of the world. I'd make you my calico children. And I would scatter you across my green memories of home. I'd be your hungry valley. And I'd sow your golden fields of wheat my own. If I were a writer. I would make you my wild horse. I'd paint you silver sage and. Ride you savagely through green wild country. (???) Swedish verses. And you are the rose on my alter. I worship you eternally in flight. Like the wave ?. I'll dip you in these praises like cobwebs. And watch them....?. For your hair is the rain. And it soaks across the continents of my skin. These hands that worship you so completely. You see this woman standing before you. Naked and seared, true of intent,. I don't need you. I want you near. For you are my love. You are my flower of the sun. You are my lover for all time. You wake in the morning. For your sun(flowers?). You wake in the morning. With your kiss. I'll be your hungry valley. And sow your golden fields of wheat...?. And you are the rose on my alter.

And you ask her how does she make your heart fly. And she'll tell you, you know why. She's your quiet warrior.. Ravens they rest on his golden crown. And steal your soul. He smiles and it feels like you've known him. Yes it feels like coming home. He's a quiet warrior.. And roaring silently he's a lion. And he'll hunt for you. His eyes are warm because his hands they are made of light. And they seduce your soul. He's a quiet warrior.. You ask him where from the wind blows. He says that the earth breathes. And you ask him how does the sun rise. He'll say that she's got wings. And you ask him how does he make your heart fly. And he'll tell you, you know why. He's your quiet warrior..

satisfied,"If you love somebody. You better lead it out. Don't hold it back. While you're trying to figure it out. Don't be timid. Don't be afraid to hurt. Run toward the flame, run toward the fire. Hold on for all your worth. Cause the only real pain. Your heart can never know. Is the sorrow of regret. When you don't let your feelings show. So did you say it. Did you mean it. Did you lay it on the line, did you make it count. Did you look ‘em in the eye and did they feel it. Did you say in time. Did you say out loud. 'Cause if you did Hun. Then you've lived some. And that feeling inside. That's called satisfied. Busy people walkin' by. Can't help but worry some. With so many things to do. So little love gets done. Empty hearts everywhere. Drownding but dying of thirst. If you want love, it's not that tough. Start by giving it first. It's easy to give, baby can't you see. Just close your eyes, open your heart. And do what comes naturally. So did you say it. Did you mean it. Did you lay it on the line, did you make it count. Did you look ‘em in the eye and did they feel it. Did you say in time. Did you say out loud. 'Cause if you did Hun. Then you've lived some. And that feeling inside. That's called satisfied. Horses are built to run. And the sun was meant to shine above. Flowers were made to bloom. Then there’s us. We were born to love. We were born to love. So did you say it. Did you mean it. Did you lay it on the line.... So did you say it. Did you mean it.

To maybe find an answer. But she's willingly distracted. By the man who like's her glitter. She says, ""Fool, I ain't gold."". She don't even know she cries Cuz she's so tangled up in lies. In her head she plays a game. Pretending that she's not the same Lady who is cheating on her husband. With a man she hardly even knows. She says, ""Ignorance is bliss."". But when he asks her name. She must fumble for an answer. She's been called so many. But now she can't remember. So she just makes up another. And she don't even know she cries Cuz she's so tangled up in lies. Now the dirty deed is done. She heads into the bathroom. She washes her hands in the sink. And thinks it could clean her conscience. If only she could find one. And slowly she turns and heads. For the door as if this were all a dream. She has seen her sweet husband's face. But only like a fleeting glimse. Of all those bridges she's been burning. All those bridges she's been burning. And she don't even know she cries. It should come as no surprise. Cuz she's so tangled up in lies."

And you were almost an angel. That was almost heaven sent. So close to heaven. So close. Wax wings that flew too close to the sun. But wasn't it so fun to fly. It's far better to love than to lose.

somewhere over the rainbow,"When all the world is a hopeless jumble. And the raindrops tumble all around. Heaven opens a magic lane. When all the clouds darken up the skyway. There`s a rainbow highway to be found. Leading from your windowpane. To a place behind the sun. Just a step beyond the rain. Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high. There`s a land that I heard of once in a lullabye. And somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue. And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true. Some day I’ll wish upon a star. And wake up where the clouds are far behind me. And troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops. That`s where you`ll find me. Somewhere, over the rainbow bluebirds fly. If birds can fly over the rainbow. Why, oh then why can`t I?. Someday I’ll wake and rub my eyes. And in that land beyond the skies. You’ll find me. I’ll be a laughing daffodil. And leave the silly cares that fill my mind behind me. Somewhere, over the rainbow, bluebirds fly. If birds can fly over the rainbow. Why, then oh why can`t I?. If happy little bluebirds fly. Beyond the rainbow. Why, oh why can`t I?"
spivy leeks,"Spivy Leeks was a drip of a man. I met him washing dishes in a local cafe. And he told me if...were fishes. He'd steal all their scales and he ... away. Spivy Leeks was an introvert. Like a broken radio. He'd make your day real long. An end result, ... time he looked up women's skirt. Just trying to figure out what was right from what was wrong. He was looking for Jesus in all the wrong places. There in my hole, save his soul. Spivy Leeks, It's time to go home. Spivy Leeks was an odd looking man. He looks just like a pool table. Shoved into jeans. And he thought that he possessed a secret power. And no matter what he did, he would be redeemed. Spivy Leeks lived at the local 7-11. He looked at dirty magazines most everyday. He studied those pictures like he studied the Bible. He thought that they were angels and that he'd been saved. He was looking for Jesus in all the wrong places. There in my hole, save his soul. Spivy Leeks, It's time to go home. Spivy Leeks robbed a liquor store. Instead of a gun, he used a candy bar. He told the cashiers that he was their saviour. But his holyness,. His holyness and his Baby Ruth didn't get him very far. Spivy Leeks died a glorious death. Down on main street. It was quite a public site. And as Mr. Sheriff man was about to. Blow him to pieces. He said ""Halejuhah, I'm coming home tonight.""."

Or am I standing still. With the scenery flying by. Or am I standing still. Out of the corner of my eye. Was that you. Passing me by. Mother's on the stoop. Boys in souped up coupes. On this hot summer night. Between fight and flight. Is the blind man's sight. And a choice that's right. I roll the window down. Feel like I'm. I'm gonna drown. In this strange town. Feel broken down. I feel broken down. Do you need me. Like I need you. Or am I standing still. Beneath the darkened sky. Or am I standing still. With the scenery flying by. Or am I standing still. Out of the corner of my eye. Was that you. Passing my by. A sweet sorrow is. The call tomorrow. A sweet sorrow is. The call tomorrow. Do you love me. Like I love you?. Or am I standing still.

star child,"A child 5 years of age stared into the sun. She stared into the bright lights so long it. Burnt a hole in her mind and branded her eyes. It imprinted upon her soul, mysteries of both young and old. And then sheâ€™d close her eyes tight to feel the darkness. She's a dancing girl, dancing girl. She danced so fast, so fine. She danced around with her eyes shut. To see the stars in her mind. A spinning Jupiter, a spinning Mars. She herself was just a singing star. A breathing constellation. Cause she's a bright point of light. Traveling through the skies of her mind. Oh and how she knew the stars. And the map of the human heart. For long lengths of time, she'd stay in her mind. And follow roads back, ancient tracks and primitive times. When giant birds lifted themselves of. Starry wings to burn white, fiery silhouettes into the night sky. She's a dancing girl, dancing girl. She danced for them. And she followed all the lines back. To where they did begin. She saw her mother in pegas wings'. She felt her father in a scorpial sting. A genetic constellation. Cause she was a bright point of light. Traveling through the skies of her mind. Oh and how she knew the stars. And the map of the human heart. She saw bursting flowers made of lucride stone. Shooting stars who songs sang to her bones. She saw stories her grandfather used to tell. His flesh was frozen was frozen and kept so well. And a clear meeting of words, but pictures to. Tell her what she knew she needed to hear. She's a dancing girl, dancing girl. She danced so fast, so well. And she danced until her knees got weak. And all resistance fell. And all the walls, they came tumbling down. She stood eyes open, back on the ground. Wiser, full of glory. She was a bright point of light. Traveling through the skies of her mind. Oh and how she knew the stars. And the map of the human heart."

And the sand has turned to stone on the starmaking machine. I'm 31 years old. That ain't the end but it sure ain't where I began. And my daddy, he wrote songs and he broke colts. And he went back to school to get a degree. Now he teachs music to kids, he taught music to me. And this Alaskan girl was living in Stephenville, Texas.

stranger enter from the east,"I went out a-wandering. Beneath an unknown sky. The heavens all shook violently. You caught my eye. A strange fruit fell. And struck me to the core. My heart became a single flame. It wanted nothing more. Stranger, enter from the east. Stranger, step inside this place. And hold me..........hold me. The clock became a bullet hole. Cruel and unkind. It hurt me with its second hand. Alone another night. Stranger, enter from the east. Stranger, step inside this place. Blue.....Is that you?. Well, don't bother knocking on my door this time. Blue...... Go be true for someone else. There's no room inside this heart of mine. My heart has four empty rooms. Three wait for lightning and one waits for you. I must have you all to myself. Feel the full weight of your skin. I'll hollow out my insides. To place you in. Stranger, enter from the east. Stranger, step inside this place. And hold me.......hold me. Hold me."

I could lay with you like this for hours.... Hours and hours.... Building a summer home in your arms. I'm building a summer home in your arms. I'm building a summer home in your arms. I'm building a summer home in your arms. Built with all your charms."

You're gonna be mine and I know it, we'll do it in style.. Cause I've made my mind up you're going to be mine. I'll tell you right now.... Any trick in the book, oh baby, that I can find.. Everybody's hustling just to have a little scene.. When I say we'll be cool, well, I think that, you know what I. mean.. We stood on a beach at sunset, do you remember when.... I know a beach where baby, it never ends.. When you've made your mind up forever to be mine.. I'll pick up your hand and slowly, blow your little mind..

When you've made your mind up forever to be mine.. I'll tell you right now.... I'll pick up your hand and slowly, blow your little mind.. When you've made your mind up forever to be mine.. I'll pick up your hand and slowly, blow your little mind.. I'll tell you right now...."
sweet dreams,"The shadows are waltzing. The moon beams are calling. Like a dream I am falling into. Silver threads lined with dew. Twinkling stars seem to shine just for you. Behind your eyes. Are endless blue skies. You travel places i want to come, too. Each breath that you breathe. Is a brush stroke that leads me to you. So sleep. Fall into night’s indigo hue. Believe me, its true. Theres nothing that I would not do. For my dream is sweet dreams for you. It seems far away. But there once was a day. It was grey in a world without you. To this heart like a dove from above. The miracle of your love found me. So sleep. Fall into night’s indigo hue. Believe me, its true. Theres nothing that I would not do. For my dream is sweet dreams for you. So hush you bye. And don’t you cry. Sweetly dream, little baby. Yes, sleep. Lose yourself in night’s indigo hue. Believe me, its true. There is nothing that I would not do. For my dream is sweet dreams. Yes, my dream is sweet dreams for you"

Well I heard Mister Young sing about her. Well, I heard ole Neil put her down. Well, I hope Neil Young will remember. A Southern man don't need him around anyhow. Sweet home Alabama.

sweet temptation,"Running fast through a fairy tale. Dark woods; starless night. Feel cold air in my lungs. Full moon, u follow me-u say. ""Why do hearts so often stray?"". U pierce me like an arrow. Beneath the blanket of night. Longing for flight. CHORUS. When u fall into me. It feels so sweet, like dreaming. Press yourself into me. Let me feel your breathing. There's a voice in your heart. Softly calling. Come 2 me u will see, just give in. 2 this sweet temptation. I awake, do a double take 2 see. Where it is that I lay-it could be. Day or night, I'm not quite sure. Your absence is a thorn. Your flesh, your skin. Is the only flag there is 2 believe in. CHORUS. I can love u like nobody else. When u fall into me. It feels so sweet, like dreaming. Press yourself into me. Let me feel your breathing. There's a voice in your heart. Softly calling. CHORUS."
ten,"Whoever said love is easy. Must’ve never been in love. Sometimes its a landmine. One wrong step and it blows up. A word, a look, lights a hidden fuse. Its hard to see just what you have. When you’re seeing red. And easy to do something. You know we’ll both regret. Stop, think, count to ten before I leave. One - I still wanna hate you. Two, Three - I still wanna leave. Four - I’m searching for that door. Five - then I look in your eyes. Six - Take a deep breath. Seven - Take a step back. Eight, Nine - I don’t get why we even started this fight. By the time I get to ten. I’m right back in your arms again. Words thrown so callously. Like weapons when we fight. But when they cut too deep. I wanna leave it all behind. I have to count to ten. Before I cross that line. One - I still wanna hate you. Two, Three - I still wanna leave. Four - I’m searching for that door. Five - then I look in your eyes. Six - Take a deep breath. Seven - Take a step back. Eight, Nine - I don’t get why we started this fight. By the time I get to ten. I’m right back in your arms again. You can lose what you’re not grateful for. I don’t want that to happen to you and me. Better count my blessings. One - You still move me. Two, Three - You send chills right through me. Four - You keep me wanting more. Five - when I look in your eyes. Six - You’re my best friend. Seven - That’ll never end. Eight, Nine - I don’t know why, but thank God it happens every time. By the time I get to ten. By the time I get to ten - oh. I can see how blessed I’ve been. I’d choose you all over again"
the cowboy's lament,Oh my angel. Sweet sweet angel. Come to me swiftly. This night so still. For dawn does come swiftly. I been gone so long. But your face is so lovely. It keeps my faith strong. My hands are unsteady. I’m so far from home. Just tell me angel. I’m never alone. Lay with me angel. Speak not a word. Your body's so slender. Like the wings of a bird. Fly from me angel. When you see dawn has come. I’ll be with you angel. On the wings of a song. [yodeling]
the man who's already gone,"There's a man gonna have you if he can. But he don't want to (wait, he's gone home)?. Passion in his hands, the desires of a man. Strung by the laces of his shoes. And Tuesday's another town. And Wednesday's hanging round. But Thursday don't want to see him anymore. Cause he can hold you. He can love you. But he won't be thinkin of you. He's the man who's already gone. There's a man gonna love you if he can. But he don't know which way he's gonna roam/run. Daddy said go ahead, he said well you never can tell. which way the wind is gonna blow. because hearts may come and hearts may go. But you can't follow scent? if it's cold. Cause he can hold you he can haunt you. But he won't be thinking of you. Cause he's the man who's already gone. Don't roam. It's a long road. It's a long road with no place to go. There's a man gonna have you if he can. But he don't know which way he's gonna roam.."
the new wild west,"You see the ghosts of the buffalo. Moving both fierce and slow. Like glittering prophesies. On the edge of the horizon. As you drive glittering highways. And beaten-up by-ways. That straddle and girdle. A great and many-faced nation. There are lambs in the ghettos. Who worship their Gapettos. Believing in, though never seeing. The strings they think bind them. So you write to our congressmen. With bleeding pens. Of the sorrow within. And in return they just send. Tickets to the latest Tom Hanks show. CHORUS:. Welcome to the new wild west. Each man for himself. A nation of civilized steeples. And lonely people. Welcome to the new wild west. There are so many fractions. And cue-card reactions. It's hard to keep clear. The possibilities here. 'Cause there's no force to unite them. Privilege has ruled for thousands of years. Wars have been fought with bibles and tears. Yet liberation can't deny the temptation. And soon becomes the oppressor. Show me a leader who's fit to lead. Who don't sew his seed in anything. Wounded enough to breed. Because after all what fun is power. If you can't act like a rock star?. CHORUS. See me, I've been cruel. I've been petty and unkind. But I know my own mind. And since it seems clear. There's no one leading us here. The only thing left it appears. Is to task ourselves to be better each time. Then those before us. We'll be an army of theives. Of self-freed slaves. Of mild-mannered maids. We'll fight with whispers and blades. So get ready, a new day is dawning. CHORUS."
the other woman,"The other woman finds time to manicure her nails.. The other woman is perfect where her rival fails.. And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair.. The other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume.. The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room.. There are never toys that's scattered everywhere.. And when her baby caomes to call. He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen.. Cause when she's by his side. It's such a change form the old routine.. But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep.. The other woman will never have his love to keep.. And as the years go by, the other woman. Will spend her life alone.."
the shape of you,"September settles softly,. leaves are starting to fall. I recall the last time you were here, your laughter a melody that lingers still. There´s a hole in my heart and I carry it wherever I go, like a treasure that travels with me down every road, there´s this longing lonesome deep kinda bitter, kinda sweet, there´s a hole in my heart in the shape of you. Time´s stealing swiftly, as children having children of their own,. and around life´s merry go round goes there. you are watching what you cannot hold. There´s a hole in my heart and I carry it wherever I go, like a treasure that travels with me down every road, there´s this longing lonesome deep kinda bitter, kinda sweet, there´s a hole in my heart in the shape of you. Even though my heart aches, there´s a smile on my face ´coz just like a window to heaven, there´s a light shining through. There´s a hole in my heart. There´s a hole in my heart. There´s a hole in my heart. but it is in the shape of you. . Sent by Bruno Levy"
the sue lee song,"Sometimes I falter. beneath an endless sky. And I can't remember when,. only why. And I call out your name in the darkness. from far away. These days are so strange. (so strange). Like a fire that has no flame. Like a vessel that's hungry. for rain. And I call out your name in the darkness. from far away. And soldiers all march and fight. Spending up their youthfulness. and skinny pride. While maidens all sleep. with their hearts all on their sleeves. Bloodied from victory. These days are so long. And still I plow my way. Through these nights so cold. And these nights so strange. When even the stars. seem to lose their way. And I call out your name in the darkness. from far away. And soldiers all march and fight. Spending up their youthfulness. and skinny pride. While maidens sleep. with their hearts all on their sleeves. Bloodied from victory. With all my heart. I want to march to where you sleep. But you rise no more. Like the strange fruit of war. Laid down. at the victors' feet. And I call out your name. from the darkness. And I call out your name. from the darkness. so far away."
the water is wide,The water is wide I cant cross o'er. And neither I have wings to fly. Give me a boat that can carry two. And both shall row - my love and I. Now love is gentle love is kind. The sweetest flower when first its new. But love grows cold and waxes cold. And fades away like morning dew. There is a ship she sails the sea. Shes loaded deep as deep as can be. But not as deep as the love im in. I know not how I sink or swim. The water is wide I cant cross o'er. And neither I have wings to fly. Give me a boat that can carry two. And both shall row - my love and I. And both shall row - my love and I. ------------------------------------. The Water is Wide. Original Lyrics. The water is wide. I cannot get o'er. And neither have I wings to fly. Give me a boat that can carry two. and both shall row my love and I. I leaned my back up against an oak. I thought it was a trusty tree. But first it swayed and then it broke. and so my false love did unto me. Oh love is handsome and love is kind. and love's a jewel when it is new. but love grows old and waxes cold. and fades away like morning dew. morning dew. morning dew. like morning dew.

"thump, thump","This feeling in my heart. Can't start to describe what you mean to me. Sweet mystery. When I'm lying in my bed. the thoughts that fill my head. Well, they're ecstasy.

till we run out of road,"It's leavin time again. I'm headed out with all my friends. It's a roll of the dice. I've never thought twice. About the way I've been spending my time. Trying my guts out for every dime. Working in an office building tall. Don't know who's next to you at all. But being out here. The blood, the guts, the beer. Is a test. Only time will tell. It brings you close, man. Closer than hell. CHORUS:. We're leaving, leaving again. Can't recall where all we been. I guess we'll just go. Go till we're too old. Or we run out of road. The other day I talked to Lou. He quit back in '92. Says he misses it bad. Those were the best times he ever had. He said, ""Give it hell to the end. 'Cause once you quit. You can't get it back again"". CHORUS:. We're leaving, leaving again. Can't recall where all we been. I guess we'll just go. Go till we're too old. Or we run out of road. BRIDGE:. Expensive cabs and shitty food. Washed down with cancelled flights. This week endorsement holidays. You miss your boy and wife. Oh the late night drives, the calls. The dawn to strike you like a knife. Hey man, this is a beautiful life. We're leaving again, leaving again.... CHORUS (x2):. We're leaving, leaving again. Can't recall where all we been. I guess we'll just go. I guess we'll just go. I guess we'll just go. Till we're too old. Or we run out of road."
time after time,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,. And think of you. caught up in circles. confusion Is nothing new. Flashback--warm nights--. Almost left behind. Suitcase of memories,. Time after--. Sometimes you picture me--. I'm walking too far ahead. You're calling to me, I can't hear. What you've said--. Then you say--go slow--. I fall behind--. The second hand unwinds. Chorus:. If you're lost you can look--and you will find me. Time after time. If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting. Time after time. If you're lost you can look--and you will find me. Time after time. If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting. Time after time. After my picture fades and darkness has. Turned to gray. Watching through windows--you're wondering. If I'm OK. Secrets stolen from deep inside. The drum beats out of time--. Chorus:. If you're lost.... If you fall.... You said go slow--. I fall behind. The second hand unwinds--. Chorus:. If you're lost.... If you fall.... If you're lost.... If you fall.... Time after time x 7 (fading)"
tiny love spaces,"I don't care if you leave your name after the beep.. Don't care if those are promises you intend to keep.. Cause lovers are just shadows that disappear with the light. And my happiness don't depend on if you come tonight.. Ahoh-oh oh. I don't think that you're cheap. I don't expect anything. You don't gotta leave what time you called on my machine.. Cause being in love just means calling places. when you can't afford the bill. Cause we all got these tiny love spaces that we need to fill. Ohoh oo. Filling up tiny love spaces. Getting lost inside of insatiable mazes. Looking for heroes in worn-out faces. Looking for a great big love in tiny places. You wake up, it's the next morning. Put my high-powered columbian crystals in the coffee machine. Read the newspaper, drink six cups of cofee, listen to Mozart's Fifth. Do most anything not to hear the phone ring. Oh oo ooooo. And I don't mind that you're emotionally blind. Don't care if I'm someone you want to see. You don't got to leave your number for me.. Cause I do not need your gosh-darn phone calls telling me how you feel. I only just need to make love to tell me that I'm real. Cause we all got these tiny love spaces that we need to fill Ohoh oooo. Transcribed by Tom Proven."

With my baby tonight. But brother you'll find. My baby tonight. Cause it's too darn hot. I call into. The Kinsey report. Every average man, you know. He much prefers. His lovey-dovey to court. When the temperature is low. Cause when the thermometer. Goes way up. And the weather is sizzling hot. Mr. Pants for romance. A G.I. for his cutie-pie. A marine for his queen is not. Cause its too, too. Too darn hot. It's too darn hot. It's too darn hot. It's too darn hot. It's too. Darn. Hot."
train song (aka paler shade of grey),"I try to recall what it was you said to me just then. but this train keeps on rocking me back to sleep. and I fear come tomorrow I won't even remember your name. I'd make myself remember. Make myself recall. but these promises and these vows I made you now. seem to have no voice at all. The color of the canyons. When first it was said I love you. But these colors and these canyons. now all seem silly and small. I don't understand at all. how these colors in my memory just fade. into such a pale shade of grey. and cold rails remind me of your cold feet. and my eyes expect to see you behind every door. but when I shut my eyes. I can't even recall what it is that you wore. My god was that only yesterday. I can't even remember your face. I feel so far away. I make myself remember. Make myself recall. but these promises and these vows I made you now. seem to have no voice at all. The color of the canyons. When first it was said I love you. But these colors and these canyons. now all seem silly and small. I don't understand at all. how these colors in my memory just fade away. into such a pale shade of grey. *I say to myself My god I used to love him. I wanted to share with him my womb and my world. But now I stare at him as though through a glass wall. I say I used to love him but now I feel nothing for him at all. My god how could this be. Won't you please explain this to me. Now sleep sings to me in a sweet and urgent voice. And I fear that I have no choice but to forget these flowers. these daisies you gave me, the offerings you made me. the vows that we swore by, swearing we'd be together. always and forever, the children we named and now we'll never have. and I know I'm supposed to meet you. I don't even think I'll remember your name tomorrow. I make myself remember. Make myself recall. but these promises and these vows I made you now. seem to have no voice at all. The color of the canyons. When first it was said I love you. But these colors and these canyons. now all seem silly and small. I don't understand at all. how these colors in my memory just fade away. into such a pale shade of grey."
"twinkle, twinkle","Twinkle, twinkle, little star,. How I wonder what you are.. Up above the world so high,. Like a diamond in the sky.. When the blazing sun is gone,. When he nothing shines upon,. Then you show your little light,. Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.. Then the traveller in the dark,. Thanks you for your tiny spark,. He could not see which way to go,. If you did not twinkle so.. In the dark blue sky you keep,. And often through my curtains peep,. For you never shut your eye,. Till the sun is in the sky.. As your bright and tiny spark,. Lights the traveller in the dark.. Though I know not what you are,. Twinkle, twinkle, little star.. Twinkle, twinkle, little star.. How I wonder what you are.. Up above the world so high,. Like a diamond in the sky.. Twinkle, twinkle, little star.. How I wonder what you are.. How I wonder what you are."
two hearts breaking,"You're the ship, I'm the wreck. You're the bomb, I'm the tick. You're the pause before the fall. I'm the crash that follows it all. We are one, we are whole. We are one whole dying soul. We're the crash, the burn. The dream that turns. From ecstasy to aching. We are. The sound of. Two hearts breaking. You're the blink, I'm the eye. You're the shiver, I'm the knife. You're the crutch, I'm the break. You're the emptiness I make. We are one, we are whole. We are one whole dying soul. We're the crash, the burn. The dream that turns. From ecstasy to aching. We are. The sound of. Two hearts breaking. I'm dry heaving tears from crying all these years. And I know this is your nightmare come true. I never wanted this for you. But I'm the teeth, you're the heart. And together, we're the start. Of the inhale and the scream. You're the not waking. I'm the not dreaming. We are, we are one, we are whole. We are one whole dying soul. We're the crash, the burn. The dream that turns. From ecstasy to aching. We are. The sound of. We are. The sound of.

under the water,"Bees are buzzin' in their honey catacomb. All the noise seems to call my head a home. Can't escape the scratchin'. My blood makes a noise. It's hard not to play when there are so many toys. So many toys. Under the water. The total is more than the sum. Under the water. I hear who I'll become. There's a hole inside my head where all the thoughts break out. Sometimes my flesh is filled with forgetfulnes and doubt. It's easy to feel separate, no control of the reigns. Innocence ain't lost it just needs to be maintained. It needs to be maintained. Beside me are strange fish, moody and dark. A tapestry of intention that maintains the spark. And there's a tiny light. A flicker within. Forgiveness is the needle that knows how to mend. It knows how to mend. Under the water. The total is more than the sum. Under the water. I hear who I'll become. (Spoken ""Rap""). I've decided to hear who we will become. Wanna lay down in the water, go back to where I'm from. Outer space is just a puzzle of stars. Music the mechanics of the human heart. A post that stirs, a shadow that casts. An insatiable thirst drains a martini glass. There's no place sacred, no honest reflection. Our senses made senseless by a lack o' direction. Monks are great with their fists uncurled. But they live in a cave, they know nothin' of the world. I wanna live brave, I wanna love without fear. But it's hard to navigate when I can't even hear. (Do do do do do do do,. Do do do do). Bees are buzzin' in their honey catacomb. All the noise seems to call my head a home. Can't escape the scratchin'. My blood makes a noise. It's hard not to play when there are so many toys. There're so many toys. Under the water. The total is more than the sum. Under the water. I hear who I'll become. Under the water. My flesh is filled with stars. Under the water. I hear who we really are. Under the water. I lay my burdens down, down, down. Under the water. All resistance drowns. (Do do do do do do do, Do do do do). (Do do do do do do do, Do do do do). (Do do do do do do do, Do do do do). (Do do do do do do do, Do do do do). (Do do do do do do do, Do do do do). Come on, come down, down, down under go,. A-go down on and go down under. Go under the water. I hear who I'll become. Under the water. I lay my problems down. Under the water. All my resistance drowned."
unsung in your eyes,Rising to the challenge. Tough boys always appeal. With a little bit of orange. With a little bit of blue. I'm gonna fix you up. Bring out the best in you. I'm going to empty myself out. Hollowed of pride and alone. Filled in with with myself. The courage will be my own. But still I falter. Your hands know not my own. It's not that my body is overlooked. My soul is just unknown. And I cry myself to sleep. It should come as no surprise. I've tailored myself to fit your needs. Still I am unsung in your eyes. Still I am unsung in your eyes. [Performed on Lauren Hutton show.].
v-12 cadillac,"He's lonely and he cruises real low. That's my V-12 Cadillac. You know he's on the go. On down to the ocean. Surfboard by my side. He's my V-12 Cadillac. With delux power glide. I check the ocean, yeah. >From atop of the hill. We're going surfing. In my Coup de Ville. I pull out on the freeway. I put my Caddy in low. Then this real cute guy passed me. But my horn just wouldn't blow. So I pulled up beside him. Looked over real cool. Then he rolled down his window and he said,. ""Hey baby, your Caddy's a Jewel."". I check the ocean, yeah. >From atop of the hill. We're going surfing. In my Coup de Ville. He's lonely and cruises real low. That's my V-12 Cadillac. You know he's on the go. On down to the ocean. And my surfboard's by my side. It's my V-12 Cadillac. With delux power glide. I check the ocean. >From the hill. We're going surfing. In my Coup de Ville. (Come on baby). ""Hey nice board, you surf?"". ""Gimme a four foot wall and a good shoulder."". ""Are you any good?"". ""Oh honey, you don't know how good."". We're going surfing. In my Coup de Ville. (Come on)."
violet eyes,"It's been awhile since you've been around. I've been drifting like a gypsy from town to town. I've been to France and Rome I seemed to almost glitter domes. I'd lay beneath the Spanish summer skies. But I've seen nothing so lovely as your violet eyes. Do you recall the turquoise seas?. On the isles off the shore of Greece?. I've sworn I won't forget your exact smile or where we went Oh I'll see you in everything And everywhere I go I see your violet eyes.... Seasons come and seasons pass Time can seem as fragile as a looking glass Oh I know there must be something more constant than time For a night when I sleep I feel you near me I see your violet eyes.... If I could write a postcard to you I know that somehow it would get through Not sure I could express this aching in my chest I guess that I'll always miss you And everywhere I go I see your violet eyes.... Seasons come and seasons pass Life can seem as fragile as a looking glass Oh I know there must be something more constant than time for a night when I sleep I feel you near me I see your violet eyes.... It was a year ago last Christmas we spent in Hawaii We were aughing beneath the stars playing in the sand, laughing in the sea It will be a year coming this 4th of July when for the last time we held your hand and for the last time closed your violet eyes.... Seasons come and seasons pass Oh Life can seem as fragile Oh as fragile as a looking glass I know that there is something more constant than time for at night when I sleep I feel you near me I see your eyes upon me I see your violet eyes."
walk away,"DonæŠ° say I love you, I wonæŠ° say that I care. IæŠ£l pretend I never kissed you, or held you, or worshipped you. I swear. IæŠ£l live in denial for as long as I live. Cuz *what I need baby, this love just canæŠ° give. We have to walk away. We have to walk away. IæŠ£l try not to sing, youæŠ£l try not to talk with those lips. WeæŠ£l forget all the sweet memories, and now we'll just go with what. is. Cuz this love ainæŠ° loving, and I donæŠ° know why. But anything that stands so still canæŠ° be alive. We have to walk away. We have to walk away. [refrain]. But there were times our love was, so sweet. And itæŠ¯ *memory that makes me want to make it last. But you canæŠ° make love work, anymore than you can make it leave. And itæŠ¯ then you gotta leave it yourself. [refrain2]. Cuz when love ainæŠ° loving but still ainæŠ° leaving. ItæŠ¯ then you gotta leave it yourself. Now jealousy can ride your heart like a sick kind of pony. And envyæŠ¯ just the same. And your loneliness can consume you no matter how much love you had. And when it all boils down, baby, thereæŠ¯ no other way. And I *care much more than to make you stay. We have to walk away. We have to walk away. So at night, when darkness fills me,. IæŠ£l pretend you never spoke my name. When IæŠ¦ sitting home that lonely,. IæŠ£l pretend youæŠ®e home and lonely, oh just the same. And IæŠ£l pretend this sorrow, this sorrow will pass. And IæŠ£l try to pretend that this loneliness wonæŠ° last. And that IæŠ£l walk away. yeah, yeah, yeah. refrain. repeat. refrain2. repeat. So donæŠ° say. So donæŠ° say I love you. I wonæŠ° say that I care."
weeping tree,"Don't cry pretty girl. Do as you're told to. Don't (???) memories just because it hurts you. There's a stranger's sillhouette. Had it's way with you. Because it wanted to. Don't worry. Ain't damaged (???) yet. Don't let it haunt you. Just stand out in the rain. Until you're made whole again. The (???) under the moon. Weeping tree. Under the weeping tree. Underneath the starry sky.

Under the weeping tree."
what matters is the heart,Did you forget about the passion. Of living day to day. We keep our dreams locked down inside. And choking on a lifetime. And never take a chance. Wake up one day wishing you tried. And it ain't about the money. It ain't about the time. It ain't about the love you lost. Or the things you think you left behind. And it ain't about your losing streak. Makes you feel like you're falling apart. What matters is the heart. Lets forget about the notion. That we're not the same. My blood runs as red as yours. We all get angry. We've all been scared. We've all made big mistakes. That can never be repaired. And it ain't about the money. It ain't about the time. It ain't about the love you lost. Or the things you think you left behind. It ain't about your losing streak. Makes you feel like you're falling apart. What matters is the heart. Look me in the eye. Take my hand. We can make a difference. We can make a difference. I know we can. If we forgot about the passion. Living day to day. We kept our dreams locked down inside. And choking on a life time. And never take a chance. Wake up one day wishing you tried. It ain't about the money. It ain't about the time. It ain't about the love you lost. Or the things you think you left behind. It ain't about your losing streak. Makes you feel like you're falling apart. What matters is the heart. And it ain't about the money. It ain't about the time. It ain't about the love you lost. Or the things you think you left behind. It ain't about your losing streak. Makes you feel like you're falling apart. What matters is the heart.
what you are,"I'm driving around town. Kinda bored with the windows rolled down. See a girl on the bus stop bench. Dressed to draw attention. Hoping everyone will stare. If she don't stand out she thinks she'll disappear. Wish I could hold her, tell her, show her. What she wants is already there. A star is a star. It doesn't have to try to shine. Water will fall. A bird just knows how to fly. You don't have to tell a flower how to bloom. Or light how to fill up a room. You already are what you are. And what you are is beautiful. Heard a story the other day. Took place at the local VA. A father talking to his dying son. This was his conversation. ""It's not supposed to be like this. You can't go first I can't handle it"". The boy said ""Dad now don't you cry,. Remember when I was a child what you used to tell me when I'd ask why?"". (You'd say) Gravity is gravity. It doesn't try to pull you down. Stone is stone. It can't help but hold its ground. The wind just blows, though you can't see. It's everywhere like I'll always be. You already are what you are. And what you are is strong enough. Look in the mirror. Now that's another story to tell. I give love to others. But I give myself hell. I'd have to tell myself. ""In every scene there's a perfect plan"". Everything I hoped to be. I already am. A flower is a flower. It doesn't have to try to bloom. And light is light. Just knows how to fill a room. And dark is dark. So the stars have a place to shine. The tide goes out. So it can come back another time. Goodbye makes a love so sweet. And love is love so it can teach us. We already are what we are. And what we are is beautiful. And strong enough. And good enough. And bright enough"
what's simple is true,"What's Simple Is True - album: Spirit. Jewel. Turn to me with frozen lips. Your hands are icy cold. Your eyes burn bright against the frost-bit sky. You never seemed more lovely than you do right tonight. Pale on the horizon. Like leaves frozen in the snow. Our two shadows merge inseparably. Will time stand still if it's pierced with cold. The more I live. The more I know. What's simple is true. I love you. there's a warmth in my heart. It haunts me when you're gone. Mend me to your side and never let go. Say 'Time knows nothing, we'll never grow cold'. The more I live. The more I know. What's simple is true. I love you. Twilight descends on our silhouette. How soon spring comes. How soon spring forgets. I wanna hold time, say it'll never begin. Old man winter be our friend. Old man winter be our friend. 'Cause the more I live. The more I know. What's simple is true. What's simple is true. I love, I love you"
when i was with you,"This song was written by Jewel and Steve Poltz--Jewel wrote the. lyrics, but the music (melody) was written by Steve for a song with. different lyrics that appears on Morning Wood. This was Jewel's. response to that song, told from the female's point of view.. Do you remember when we were younger,. all those crazy things that we used to do?. You'd play my hips like drumsets. and sing all your favorite Stevie Wonder tunes. When I was with ya.. Do you remember we did everything together?. I'd share my otter pops with you.. And we would sing in all the slimy slimy barrooms. We'd watch for your cousin Ed on the evening news. When I was with ya. I'd warm your tootsies up, they're always so cold. And I'd fix you supper from leftovers two weeks old. And I'd read you the classified ads in bed. And you would point out all the miserable lives. that I could have had instead of being with you. Could've been Whoopi Goldberg's breasts. Do you remember when you wrote all those letters?. Though I admit they were kind of sick. But still I knew I was your honey sugar dumpling. and just like a good line you'd alweys be there to lick. When I was with ya. Do you remember when you took all those classes?. All those crazy gadgets you would fix. I hated how cluttered our apartment was. I hated our landlord Harry, he was such a dick. When I was with ya. I'd warm your tootsies up, they're always so cold. And I'd fix you supper from leftovers two weeks old. And I'd read you the classified ads in bed. And you would point out all the miserable lives. that I could have had instead of being with you. Could've been Richard Nixon's last pair of clean underwear ?????. Do you remember when we went to Mexico. and stayed in that cute little place. We were honin' our fine love-makin' skills. and you tattoed ""I love you"" on your face. When I was with ya. I still remember the last time that I saw you. You left me with a hotdog in my hand. Was it cause I didn't want a pickle or was it a pretty senorita. Oh well, there was always stuff that I didn't understand. When I was with ya. I'd warm your tootsies up, they're always so cold. And I'd fix you supper from leftovers two weeks old. And I'd read you the classified ads in bed. And you would point out all the miserable lives. that I could have had instead of being with you Being with you. Being with you. Transcribed by Tom Proven.."
where you are,"I called you late last night. You said you didn't feel like talking. I had to blow off a little bit of steam. You said you were tired of feeling so uptight. You make me so loose. And I get so lost inside of you. But I cannot always find my way. To where you are. All used to be so simple, used to be so much fun. You said, yeah well that was back when you believed in my love. But that things are not so simple now. And I've turned out the lights somehow. In the darkness you cannot always find your way. To where I am. Please don't take your eyes from me. Cause if you did I would no longer be able to see. Oh please I need you. I am a princess. And I'm locked inside a stone tower of song. Trying to write message on the wind. Trying to send the message how I just want to belong. Oh choose me, choose me, take me, pick me. Oh I want to believe that noone else exists for you. And noone else exists for me. You are my home and I have finally found my way. To where you are"
who will save your soul,"People living their lives for you on TV. They say they're better than you and you agree. He says hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls. Says come here boy, there ain't nothing for free. Another doctor's bill, a lawyer's bill, another cute cheap thrill. You know you love him if you put him in your will, but.... Who will save your souls when it comes to the flowers now?. Who will save your souls after those lies that you told, boy?. And who will save your souls if you won't save your own?. La da de da de da la da da. We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss them. The cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue. Another day, another dollar, another war, another tower went up. Where the homeless had their homes. So we pray to as many different gods as there are flowers. That we call religional friend. We're so worried about saving our souls. Afraid that God will take His toll that we forget to begin but.... Who will save your souls when it comes to the flowers now?. Oh, who will save your souls, after those lies that you told boy?. And who will save your souls if you won't save your own?. La da de da de da da la ha da. Some are walkin, some are talkin, some are stalkin. Their kill got social security, but it doesn't pay your bills. There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay. So you bargain with the Devil, that you're o.k. for today say. That you love them, take their money and run. Say, it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just small one of those things. Those flings, those strings you've got to cut. So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts. Who will save... save your soul when it comes to the flowers now?. oh, who will save your souls, after those lies that you told, boy?. And who will save... save your souls if you won't save your own?."
wild horses,"Childhood living is easy to do. The things you wanted I bought them for you. Graceless lady you know who I am. You know I can’t let you slide through my hands. Wild horses couldn’t drag me away. Wild, wild horses, couldn’t drag me away. I watched you suffer a dull aching pain. Now you decided to show me the same. No sweeping exits or offstage lines. Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind. Wild horses couldn’t drag me away. Wild, wild horses, couldn’t drag me away. I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie. I have my freedom but I don’t have much time. Faith has been broken, tears must be cried. Let’s do some living after we die. Wild horses couldn’t drag me away. Wild, wild horses, we’ll ride them some day. Wild horses couldn’t drag me away. Wild, wild horses, we’ll ride them some day"

without you by my side,"I lie so tired in my bed. and moon shows herself to the door. and I shut my eyes.. I pray to God, won't you tell me please,. what's a girl like me doing. lying here without you by my side?. Lying here without you by my side. Lying here without you by my side. The room fills with moonlight and memories of old times,. but don't worry about me, I'm just fine most of the time.. The hardest part is late night, when I'm home all alone,. and the house is so still nothing better to do than think about you.. I'm Lying here without you by my side. I'm Lying here without you by my side. How quick my heart wants to believe, I'll never be lonely again.. It's those little things I never thought about much, that I miss most in the. end.. Like those sweet red-wine kisses, and the candlelight,. and the poetry, but mainly, it's just the warmth of your skin,. and having you by my side,. I'm Lying here without you by my side. There's this weight in my heart, it's so heavy, so sad,. it felt like a wave that any moment comes crashing down,. and maybe my sorrow will drown tomorrow. when I'm lying here without you by my side.

words get in the way,Come here buttercup.. Let me fill you up.. Can't you see I'm the blue in you're skies?. You can tell by the stars in my eyes.. Dawn always comes too soon.. It hurts me like a bruise.. There's a hole in my pillow where you used to be.. It feels like a hole in the middle of me.. Oh oh oh. Just take my hand to have and to hold if not obey.. Oh oh oh. Say you're still my man. I try to find the words to say. That I want you always to stay. To wake up with every single day. But words get in the way. Words get in the way. Tell you're boss you're dead.. And lets go back to bed.. You make me wanna break out a song. But everytime I try it just comes out wrong. Oh oh oh. Just take my hand to have and to hold if not obey.. Oh oh oh. Say you're still my man. I try to find the words to say. That I want you always to stay. To wake up with every single day. But words get in the way. Words get in the way. I leave a message on you're answering machine. I try to say what I really mean
yes u can,"Make your way through mirrored halls. See the boys with all their dolls. A pretty maze, like candied streets. U feel a thrill when your eyes meet. U pick the one with the feathered hair. But I'm the one that makes the boys stare. There's a room, or so I'm told. Where the DJ rocks and we don't grow old. Would u like 2 take a ride?. All u have 2 do is come inside. CHORUS. Say hello 2 the room where the party's jumpin'. Where the boys all freak 'cause boots are bumpin'. Where the girls are naughty and always saying. ""Yes u can, yes u can, yes u can"". U got on your money rags. And Papa's got a brand new bag. And Mama's got her hot pants on. While in the back, the beat goes on. Would u like 2 come along?. Then shut up and sing this song. CHORUS. The boys are pale. The girls are soft as nails. The band strikes up and it starts 2 wail. There's a price on everything. It's not cheap 2 buy your dreams. CHORUS."
yo,"* Jewel and Atz together. A little yodeling song. for my man Yo. And I know that Yo don't know. That I wrote this song a late one night. He'd heard me yodeling down at Hobo Gin's. And we were hanging out at the Putter Inn. He was beggin me to yodel. And Oh Yo he wasn't half the type. He held out his hand. I said ""What's your name?"". And he said ""Yo"". So I asked him again. And he said ""Yo"" again. So I figured it must be his name. Well I was having some perculiar thoughts. But you can't say much with a name like Atz. So I settled back. Tried to figure out Yo-yo's game. Now Yo was sailin three sheets of the wind. With a frozen stare. And an ear-to-ear grin. He kept beggin me to yodel, sayin. ""G-gget up there and yodel with the band"". It was my good friend Rod with a hired gun. So I stepped up to have a little bit of fun. With the lead, and the bass and the drummer and the rhythm man. Now Yo he staggered right up to the stage. He had this angelic smile on his face. That sucker looked like he floated up to heaven and he died. While I never had a fan quite like Yo before. He stood there mesmerized on the floor. He started stompin and clappin when he heard my yodeling cry. (chorus). And I said. *Yo This yodeling song's for you. No matter where you go. No matter what you do. Remember that time spent yodeling's time well spent. I've never had myself a fan club before. But Yo don't you know that one thing's for sure. If I do I'll make you my fan club president. And I said. *(Yodel). . Well when I got through. I said ""There you go Yo"". And he was still smiling but his eyes were still closed. And I thought I was going to get away from him. But then he opened them wide and said. ""I-II want to hear some more"". Well I was wearing out my welcome and I was running out of time. But I decided that I'd yodel up another line. Cause I thought it was the only way I could get Yo off the floor. Then I got to thinking. I realized. Suddenly I realized. Why old Yo liked yodeling. Because everytime I yodeled I was saying Yo's name. Well then I got to thinking it probably wouldn't work too well. In fact it downright sounds like hell. If you ever try to yodel using anybody elses name. Try Inga. *Inga-lay (etc.). See what I mean It just doesn't work. So In this whole wide world. No matter where I go. One thing I've learned. I've finally know. I'll never yodel again if there's anyone in the audience named Yo. And I said. *Yo This yodeling song's for you. No matter where you go. No matter what you do. Remember that time spent yodeling's time well spent. I've never had myself a fan club before. But Yo don't you know that one thing's for sure. If I do I'll make you my fan club president. And I said. *(Yodel). (long yodel)."
you make lovin' fun,"Sweet wonderful you,. You make me happy with the things you do,. Oh, can it be so,. This feeling follows me wherever I go.. I never did believe in miracles,. But I've a feeling it's time to try.. I never did believe in the ways of magic,. But I'm beginning to wonder why.. Don't, don't break the spell,. It would be different and you know it will,. You, you make loving fun,. And I don't have to tell you you're the only one.. You make loving fun.. You make loving fun.."
you were meant for me,"I hear the clock, it's six a.m.. I feel so far from where I've been. Got my eggs and my pancakes too. Got my maple syrup, everything but you. Break the yolks, make a smiley face. I kinda like it in my brand new place. I wipe the spots off of the mirror. Don't leave the keys in the door. Never put wet towels on the floor anymore. 'cause. . . Dreams last for so long. Even after you're gone. I know you love me. And soon you will see. You were meant for me. And I was meant for you. . Called my momma, she was out for a walk. Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk. Picked up a paper, it was more bad news. More hearts being broken or people being used. . Put on my coat in the pouring rain. Saw a movie it just wasn't the same. 'Cause it was happy and I was sad. It made me miss you oh so bad. 'cause. . Dreams last for so long. Even after you're gone. I know you love me. And soon you will see. You were meant for me. And I was meant for you. . Go about my business, I'm doing fine. Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line. Same old story, not much to say. Hearts are broken every day. . Brush my teeth and put the cap back on. I know you hate it when I leave the light on. I pick a book up. And than turn the sheets down. Take a deep breath and a good look around. . Put on my pj's and hop into bed. I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead. I try and tell myself it'll be all right. I just shouldn't think anymore tonight. . Dreams last for so long. Even after you're gone. I know you love me. And soon I know you will see. You were meant for me. And I was meant for you"
you're in cleveland today,"Went walking underneath the shadows. Where dark and sweet secrets lay. Night's light falls gently down. Hearts helplessly fall to the ground. Underneath a velvet sky. Only words can lie. [chorus]. I wanna tell you everything. I wanna make your toes curl. You'll be my only boy. And I'll be your only girl. There's not much I can say. You're in Cleveland today. Stewardesses like Cosmo magazine. Vogue makes me nervous, I feel so plain. I could face the world fearlessly. If you would face it here with me. With just our four hands and four eyes. Traffic cops will compromise. [chorus]. Daffodils and roulette wheels and rusty automobiles. Somewhere our things share the same windowsill. Somewhere our hearts exist independent of time. Somewhere we are whole. One body, one body and one mind. From the air things look so ridiculous. Our fears so small our fights so vain. I want to pilot a plane with you. So all our problems look small too. It's just an inch from me to you. Depending on what map you use."
you're so small,"""I went to school here in Michigan at a place. called Interlochen, and, uh, there's a lot of dancers there.. About 60% of the dancers were either anorexic or bulemic.. And I often blamed it on their boyfriends.. So I wrote this about that.. I didn't agree with that, by the way."". Gonna walk down the street. and seduce every man I meet. because I'm having a bad day.. I am. not size six.. My legs are not. skinny as sticks. and dammit, someone's got to pay.. (That's the power of a woman, ohhhh). I feel unattractive.. I'm gonna see if it's true.. I'm going to break a heart or maybe two.. I'm gonna put on a sexy red thing. Gonna run very late. I'm gonna pull some strings. Cause my strength is in my. power over you.. (the power of a woman). But I'm afraid that I can't satisfy myself. And that my happiness depends on someone else.. I feel weak, so you're gonna take the fall.. You're so small, you're so small, you're so small.. You're so small, I feel fat, you're so small.. You're so small, I don't feel anything, cuz you're so small.."
