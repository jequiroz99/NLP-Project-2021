When it's all said and done will I see you?. I've been planting seeds in our ground. Watching us grow for a while. Pray the sun stays shining down on us. I hope it do. We committed our trust out loud. Like gravity, we swore to hold each other down. Build a circle, pray you always stay around. I do, Lord knows I do. Met you on the block. You ain't gotta hustle like that no more. I've been on a journey. I ain't trying a look back no more. We been on a wave. Trying a not make it back to shore, oh no. But when it's all said and done will I see you?. When it's all said and done will I see you?. Now that my love is on. All the way on you, I won't turn it off. Would you do the same?. When it's all said and done will I see you?. Took away my insecurities. Your arms became my security. Ooh, my melody became harmony. With you, and only you. Sometimes reality kicks in. Realizing every beginning comes to an end. Can I go to sleep at night?. Knowing I wake up to my best friend. When it's all said and done will I see you?. (will I see you?). When it's all said and done will I see you?. (I need to know). Now that my love is on. All the way on you, I won't turn it off. Would you do the same?. When it's all said and done will I see you?. (will I see you?). Met you on the block. You ain't gotta hustle like that no more. I been on a journey. I ain't tryna to look back no more. We been on a wave. Tryna not make it back to shore, oh no. So when it's all said and done will I see you?. (will I see you?). When it's all (when it's all) said and done will I see you?. (I know it you). Now that my love is on. All the way on you, I won't turn it off. Would you do the same?. When it's all said and done will I see you?"
