queen of hollywood,She drove a long way through the night. From an urban neighborhood. She left her mother in a fight. For a dream misunderstood. And her friends they talk on corners. They could never comprehend. But there was always something different. In the way she held a stare. And the pictures that she painted. Were of glamour and of flair. And her boyfriend though he loved her. Knew he couldn't quite fulfill. He could never meet her there. She's never gonna be like the one before. She read it in her stars that there's something more. No matter what it takes no matter how she breaks. She'll be the Queen of Hollywood. And the cynics they will wonder. What's the difference with this dream. And the dreams of countless others. All they believe in TV. They see their handprints in a sidewalk. Flashing cameras on the scene. And a shining limousine. She's never gonna be like the one before. She read it in her stars that there's something more. No matter what it takes no matter how she breaks. She'll be the Queen of Hollywood. She's believing in a dream.

No matter what it takes no matter how she breaks. She'll be the Queen of Hollywood. Queen of Hollywood. No she's never gonna be like the one before.

And parties weren't meant to last. War is all around us. My mind says prepare to fight. So if I gotta die. I'm gonna listen to my body tonight. Cuz they say 2000 zero zero. Party over, oops out of time. So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999. If you didn't come to party. Don't bother knockin' on my door. I got a lion in my pocket. And baby, he's ready to roar. Everybody's got a bomb. We could die any day. But before I'll let that happen. I'll dance my life away. Cuz they say 2000 zero zero. Party over, oops out of time. So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999. Don't you wanna go?. It's 1999. Mommy why does everybody have a bomb?"
a love divine,My heart's a broken place. Seeking a state of grace. Where love survives. Wild in an urban world. Come steal my night. Make heaven mine. Say when we catch the light. We're gonna flame so high. Only way to burn. We're passing wonder why. To the other side. Where ever hides. A firefly you glow. Where I can only go. For every storm that breaks. Every sky that wakes. I'll be at your side. For ever and a day. Take you in every way. Feel a love divine. We hold the hand of time. Just you and I. Feel a love divine. Coz when we burn. We flame. A carnival of light. Reaching for the sky. A firefly you glow. Where I can only go. For every storm that breaks. Every sky that wakes. I'll be at your side. For ever and a day. Take you in every way. Feel a love divine. So to the end we blaze. And every cloud we chase. You're my alibi. Above the darkest sky. We found a way to fly. A love divine. A love divine. Every storm that breaks. Every sky that wakes. I'll be at your side. For ever and a day. Take you in every way. A love divine. So to the end we blaze. And every cloud we chase. You're my alibi. Above the darkest sky. We found a way to fly. A love divine. I feel a love divine. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah yeah. OOhh. Yeah yeah. OOhh. Yeah yeah. Love divine
a song for ireland,"Walking all the day,. Near tall towers where falcons build their nests,. Silver winged they fly,. They know the call of freedom in their breasts,. Saw Black Head against the sky,. Where twisted rocks they run to the sea,. When living on your Western shore,. Saw summer sunsets, asked for more,. I stood by your Atlantic sea,. And I sang a song for Ireland.. Talking all the day,. With true friends who try to make you stay,. Telling jokes and news,. Singing songs to while the time away,. Watched the Galway salmon run,. Like silver darting, dancing in the sun,. When living on your Western shore,. Saw summer sunsets, asked for more,. I stood by your Atlantic sea,. And I sang a song for Ireland.. Drinking all the day,. In old pubs where fiddlers love to play,. Saw one touch the bow,. He played a reel that seemed so grand and gay,. I stood on Dingle beach and cast,. In the wild foam for the Atlantic bass,. When living on your Western shore,. Saw summer sunsets, asked for more,. I stood by your Atlantic sea,. And I sang a song for Ireland.. Dreaming in the night,. I saw a land where no-one had to fight,. Waking in your dawn,. I saw you crying in the morning light,. Lying where the falcons fly,. They twist and turn all in your air blue sky,. When living on your Western shore,. Saw summer sunsets, asked for more,. I stood by your Atlantic sea,. And I sang a song for Ireland."

black is the colour,Black is the colour of my true loves hair. His lips are like some roses fair. He has the sweetest smile and the gentlest hands. And I love the ground whereon he stands. I love my love and well he knows. I love the ground whereon he goes. I wish that day would soon come. When he and I can be as one. I go to the Clyde and I mourn and weep. For satisfied I never sleep. I write him letters just a few short lines. And I suffer death ten thousand times. Black is the colour of my true loves hair. His lips are like some roses fair. He has the sweetest smile and the gentlest hands. And I love the ground whereon he stands. I love the ground whereon he stands. I love I love I love the ground whereon he stands

"forgiven, not forgotten","All Alone staring on watching her life go by. When her days are grey and her nights are black. Different shades of mundane. And the one eyed furry toy that lies upon the bed. Has often heard her cry. And heard her whisper out a name long forgiven, but not forgotten. You're forgiven, not forgotten. You're forgiven, not forgotten. You're forgiven, not forgotten. You're not forgotten. A bleeding heart torn apart left on an icy grave. In their room where they once lay face to face. Nothing could get in the way. But now the memories of a man are haunting her days. And the craving never fades. She's still dreaming of a man long forgiven, not forgotten. You're forgiven, not forgotten. You're forgiven, not forgotten. You're forgiven, not forgotten. You're not forgotten. Still alone staring on, wishing her life goodbye. As she goes searching for the man long forgiven, not forgotten. You're forgiven, not forgotten. You're forgiven, not forgotten. You're forgiven, not forgotten. You're not forgotten"

just in time,"Lately I've been talking to some friends of mine. You know the kind who understand. Trying to get a handle on this heart of mine. Sometimes it's hard to be a man. How to find a way to end these wars with you?. The more we run the more we hide. Were we just fools to ever start?. Would it make sense for us to part?. Then I started looking for some sympathy. You know that boys can still be boys. Churning out this hurting deep inside of me. Just like a child who lost his toys. And I'm duckin' and I'm dyin' and I'm runnin' and I'm hidin'. From what's standing right in front of me. Sometimes the truth's so hard to find. Making me blind I could not see. That you were the perfect one for me. Just in time. I saw a picture in the mirror, baby. of a man acting like a fool. Just in time. I saw a vision of the future without you, oh yeah. Just in time. I realised a lot of things that I'd been hiding in. this heart of mine, oh. Just in time. I saw the beauty of a love that's oh so true, yeah. Baby, you and I we got this magic touch. And we can fly right to the stars. And maybe that's the reason why it hurts so much. 'Cos when we fall we fall so far. But all we gotta do is reach out to each other and. listen to our hearts inside. Just let the wheel of love go round. Love is a crazy carousel. Jump up on board and ring the bell. Just in time. I saw a picture in the mirror, baby. Of a man losing what he had. Just in time. Just in time. I realised alot of things that I'd been hiding in this heart of mine, oh. Just in time. I saw the beauty of a love that's oh so true, yeah. And I need your love. And I want your love. Gotta have your love. Gimme all the love you got. Just in time. Gimme all the love you got... love you got. Just in time. Need the love you got. Just in time. Gimme all the love you got"

I find it hard to explain. It's crazy, but it's happening. And I'm falling again. Much further than I've ever been. I'm falling deeper than the ocean. I am lost in this emotion. Loves breaks and love divides. Love laughs and love can make you cry. I can't believe the way. That love can give and love can take away...."

moorlough shore,"Your hills and dales and flowery vales. That lie near the Moorlough Shore.. Your vines that blow by Borden's grove.. Will I ever see you more. Where the primrose glows. And the violet grows. Where the trout and salmon play.. With my line and hook delight I took. To spend my youthful days.. Last night I went to see my love,. And to hear what she might say.. To see if she'd take pity on me,. Lest I might go away.. She said, ""I loved an Irish lad,. And he was my only joy,. And ever since I saw his face. I have loved that soldier boy."". Perhaps your soldier lad is lost. Sailing over the sea of Maine.. Or perhaps he's gone with some other one. You may never see him again.. Well if my Irish lad is lost,. He's the one I do adore,. And seven years I'll wait for him. By the banks of the Moorlough Shore."
my lagan love,"Where Lagan stream sing lullaby. There blows a lily fair. When twilight gleam is in her eyes. The night is on her hair. And like a love - sick lenanshee. She hath my heart in thrall. No life have I, no liberty. With love is lord of all. And sometimes when the beetles horn. Hath lulled the eve to sleep. I steal unto her shieling low. And through her dooreen peep. There on the cricket's singing stone. She stirs the bog wood fire. And hums in soft sweet undertones. The song of heart's desire. Her welcome like her love for me. Is from her heart within. Her warm kiss is felicity. That knows no taint of sin"
nightwish,"Oh, setting Sun,. Thy red rays maketh me cry.. They remind me of the one. Whose love awaits me in the sky.. A bridal bed awaits us both. After the landscape of death I cross.. Before my sorrows I must die,. Nightwish I send through the starlit sky.. The voice of nightly winds has awakened me,. Amidst all the grief they embrace me with relief.. Beneath my dreams and wishes. I long for thy caresses.. A bridal bed awaits us both,. After the landscape of death I cross.. Before my sorrows I must die,. Nightwish I send through the starlit sky.. ""Passed away in silence. The flute from the realm unseen. Empties its heart. Making love to me. With its enchanting melody.. Light of Orion,. Shadow of Andromeda,. Call of the dancing Universe.. Their love I must enter. Before thou can blame my soul. That is peace"""
no frontiers,"If life is a river and your heart is a boat. And just like a water baby, baby, born to float,. And if life is a wild wind that blows way on high,. And your heart is Amelia dying to fly,. Heaven knows no frontiers and I've seen heaven in your eyes. And if life is a bar room in which we must wait,. 'round the man with his fingers on the ivory gates,. Where we sing until dawn of our fears and our fates,. And we stack all the dead men in self addressed crates,. In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark,. That somehow this black night,. Feels warmer for the spark,. Warmer for the spark,. To hold us 'til the day,. When fear will lose its grip,. And heaven has its way,. Heaven knows no frontiers,. And I've seen heaven in your eyes. If your life is a rough bed of brambles and nails,. And your spirit's a slave to man's whips and man's jails,. Where you thirst and you hunger for justice and right,. And your heart is a pure flame of man's constant night,. In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark,. That somehow this black night,. Feels warmer for the spark,. Warmer for the spark,. To hold us 'til the day when fear will lose its grip,. And heaven has its way,. And heaven has its way,. When all will harmonise,. And know what's in our hearts,. The dream will realise. Heaven knows no frontiers,. And I've seen heaven in your eyes,. Heaven knows no frontiers,. And I've seen heaven in your eyes."

sos,"There's pain on the border as far as the eyes can't see. And hell's getting busy while we're in the cheap seats. My girl in a tutu, more shoes to pick for her feet. How many lies long until we admit what we see. Blame it on love. Blame it on sorrow. Blame it on a star that fell to soon. Or Jupiter Calling, can you hear them cry. Sos, someone help. Sos, someone help. They say the victims are dangerous, what a bitter excuse. Coz now we're complacent but living a lie is the truth. A doll in the water, her hair out like tendrils. But it's only a bad day that I've ever rescued. Blame it on love. Blame it on sorrow. Blame it on a star that fell to soon. Or Jupiter Calling, can you hear them cry. Sos, someone help. Sos, someone help. Sos, someone help. Sos, someone help. Sos, someone help. Sos, someone help. Can't turn away from the pain. But I don't want to see it again. Can't turn away from the pain. I still hear them cry"

The young ,the old, the brave, the bold came their duty to fill. At the parish church at Cluney just a mile from Spancill Hill. I went to see my neighbors to hear what they might say. The old ones were all dead and gone the young one's turning grey. I met the tailor Quigley, he's bold as ever still. Sure he used to mend my britches when I lived at Spancill Hill. I paid a flying visit to my first and only love. She's fair as any lily and gentle as a dove. She threw her arms around me saying ""Johnny I love you still”. She was Meg the farmers daughter and the pride of Spancill Hill. She was Meg the farmers daughter and the pride of Spancill Hill"

Lovers in love and the other's run away. Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay. Some of us hover while we wait for the other. Who was dying since the day they were born. Well, this is not that I think that's it not that I'm throwing. But I'm thrown. And I thought I'd live forever. But now I'm not so sure. You try to tell me that I'm clever.
