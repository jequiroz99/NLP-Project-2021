Drinking tea in bed. Watching DVD's. When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines. You take me out shopping and all we buy is trainers.

drivin' me wild,"Lily Allen: Chorus. It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down x3. Love's not a mystery, it's everything. Common: Verse One. She was the type to watch Oprah and The Today Show. Be on the treadmill, uh, like OK Go. Had the body, un body, that you can't pay for. That means she had some D's on her, but they wadn't. fake though. Had a drive, a Drive for Rodeo. She spent pesos on those Lebos. Spent class at the gym, Striptease on the pole. She was so obsessed with her body and clothes. To every party she goes, trying hard to be chose. They say it's hard for a pimp, but extra hard for. these hoes. Reading US or People mag, tryna get these scoops. Chasing an actor for a Bentley Coupe. She recruit a ball player from the Clippers. Then came the pumps off. Thinking she Number One, when she just a Jump Off. Doing all she can for a man and a baby. Driving herself crazy like the astronaut lady. Lily Allen: Chorus. It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down x3. Love's not a mystery, it's everything. Common: Verse Two. He had paper since we was in, we was in High School. Pop was a doc, mom taught at my school. Lock with the rocks, in his ear he kept jewels. One of the Diddy types, the d-d-d-Dame Dash dudes. Pushed the Maserati Sport, reading the Robb Report. Wanted to be Mike, but he was never live in sports. Since golf was in, he was in the driving course. To live the rap life is what he was striving for. Spending cash at the bar to get credit. Drinking Chandon just because BIG said. They say Ye is, but dude big-headed. Rocked the fur in the summer, so, somebody'll pet it. He had a fetish for shoes that's athletic. Pathetic on his myspace page, half naked. It's a shame what they do for fame, and to be. respected. Joe you coulda got it, if you never woulda stressed it. Lily Allen: Chorus. It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down x3. Love's not a mystery, it's everything. Common: Verse Three. They was one of them couples, people said they was the. it. Unbreakable like Bobby & Whit. Or Ryan and Reese, or Kimora and Russ. Relationships can be dead but look live to us. I guess we all been through it, where we try too much. Losing yourself and your line and stuff. Wishing for the diamond cuffs, searching for the ring. . Lily Allen: Chorus. It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down x3. Now it's not a mystery, it's everything. Gets me down x5. Gets me.... Love's not a mystery, it's everything"

Long before hijacking planes. He's lost the will he can't decide. He doesn't know who's right or wrong. But there's one thing that he's sure of this has been going on too long. Do you think he'd drive in his car without insurance. Now is he interesting or do you think he'd bore us. Do you think his favourite type of human is caucasian. Do you reckon he's ever been done for tax evasion. Do you think he's any good at remembering people's names. Do you think he's ever taken smack or cocaine. I don't imagine he's ever been suicidal.

knock 'em out,"Alright so this is a song about anyone, it could be anyone. You're just doing your own thing and someone comes outta the blue. They're like ""Alright what ya saying? Yeah, can I take your digits?"". And you're like ""No. Not in a million years.. You're nasty please leave me alone"".. Cut to the pub on our last night out. Man at the bar says it was his shout. Clocks his bird and she looked okay. She caught him looking and walked his way. ""Alright darling are you gonna buy us a drink then?"". ""Er... no, but I was thinking of buying one for your friend"".. She's got no taste, hand on his waist. Tries to pull away put her lips on his face. ""If you insist I'll have a white wine spritza"". ""Sorry love but you ain't a pretty picture"". You can't knock 'em out, you can't walk away. Try desperately to think of the politest way to say. ""Just get out my face, just leave me alone.

As he walks over her face starts sinking. She's like ""Oh here we go"". It's a routine check that she already knows. She's thinking ""they're all the same"". ""Yeah you alright baby? You look alright still, yeah, what's you're name?"". She looks in her bag, takes out a fag. Tries to get away from a guy on a blag. Can't find a light, ""here, use mine"". ""See the thing is I just don't have the time"". You can't knock 'em out, you can't walk away. Try desperately to think of the politest way to say. ""Just get out my face, just leave me alone. And no you can't have my number, 'cause I lost my phone"". Go away now, let me go. Are you stupid or just a little slow?. Go away now, I've made myself clear. No, it's not gonna happen, not in a million years. You can't knock 'em out, you can't walk away. Try desperately to think of the politest way to say. ""Just get out my face, just leave me alone.

It don't matter to me. ‘Cos all I wanted to be. Was a million miles from here. Somewhere more familiar. Too much time spent dragging the past up. I didn't see you not looking when I messed up.

up the junction,I never thought it would happen. With me and the girl from Clapham. Out on a windy common. That night I ain't forgotten. When she dealt out the rations. With some or other passions. I said you are a lady. Perhaps she said I may be. We moved into a basement. With thoughts of our engagement. We stayed in by the telly. Although the room was smelly. We spent our time just kissing. The Railway Arms we're missing. But love had got us hooked up. And all our time it took up. I got a job with Stanley. He said I'd come in handy. And started me on Monday. So I had a bath on Sunday. I worked eleven hours. And bought the girl some flowers. She said she'd seen a doctor. And nothing now could stop her. I worked all through the winter. The weather brass and bitter. I put away a tenner. Each week to make her better. And when the time was ready. We had to sell the telly. Late evenings by the fire. With little kicks inside her. This morning at 4:50. I took her rather nifty. Down to an incubator. Where thirty minutes later. She gave birth to a daughter. Within a year a walker. She looked just like her mother. If there could be another. And now she's two years older. Her mother's with a soldier. She left me when my drinking. Became a proper stinging. The devil came and took me. From bar to street to bookie. No more nights by the telly. No more nights nappies smelling. Alone here in the kitchen. I feel there's something missing. I'd beg for some forgiveness. But begging's not my business. And she won't write a letter. Although I always tell her. And so it's my assumption. I'm really up the junction

wanna be,"[Hook: Lily Allen]. So you wanna be a gangster?. Tell me just one thing. What you know about being a hard-man?. Your mum buys your bling. Your pockets getting bigger. but you couldn't pull the trigger. if you need to. Cause you haven't got it. So you might as well quit. [Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]. I'm moving, couldn't be losing. Nothing but a success thing, I'm proving. Nothing to you half-heart wasters. Standing there yap-yap-yapping on cruising. Nobody dictates, I'm choosing. Where I go, what I do with my life, stupid. And I hold my own, I'm Raskit. You better watch your tone, you spastic. 'low it, you're not heartless. Nothing but a lot of hot air, you're harmless. I keep getting my paper regardless. Your words don't faze me, I'm marvelous. Age 22, zero tolerance. And I ain't got no time for the nonsense. You wanna see me, come to my concerts. And we can do it on stage with a audience. [Hook]. [Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]. Beef, stripes, guts, glory. All these hype bredders in the club bore me. I wish when I'd come through they'd ignore me. I really can't deal with another war story. Bredders in my face with a fist full of paper. Trying to make out they're a big money maker. Talking all loud (Better know man a hustler). I ain't got time, rudeboy, see you later. And I can't forget these groupies following. Fronting, raving, ranting, hollering. Yeah, I know I shouldn't be complaining. But these Jezebels do my brain in. (I ain't no groupie, who ya calling Jezebel?. Don't chat to me like I'm just any girl). Ah security, somebody move her. (I don't wanna talk to you anyway, loser). [Hook]. [Bridge: Lily Allen - 2X]. That whip don't make you a big man (Nah mate). That chain don't make you a big man (Nah mate). I know you think you're a big man (What mate?). But really you're just a waste, man ('low it). [Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal]. Yo, let me wrap it up while I've still got time. Ain't nobody telling about no Grime. Cause I know where I stand with it, I'm fine. Handle your biz, I'm handling mine. Everybody chatting 'bout black-on-black crime. All I see is the blind leading the blind. I wanna leave all the pettiness behind. You don't really want to see me cross that line. Leave me alone or you'll be sorry. Beef ain't nothing new to me, you wally. Why don't you just kick back, be jolly. Stay at home with a cup of tea, watch Corrie. I'm not listening anyway, man. Who rattled your cage anyway, man. Ain't no slacking with this young man. Do what I gotta do everyday, fam. [Hook]"

Me nah gon' say nothing, me nah gon' stress. Me just a reason of your conscience. I got to know, oh my girl, I know. Stop crying every time I get a text. Every time my phone rings. Don't be upset, baby. I've always said that no man can own me. If you really wanna go, that's fine, bih. That's your choice, not mine. Nunna, nunna, nunna. Nunna, nunna, nunna. Nunna, nunna, nunna.
