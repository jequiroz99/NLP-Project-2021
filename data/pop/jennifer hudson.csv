i can't let go,"They say nothing lasts forever. Well, I wish that that were true. Cause this aching in my heart won't go away. They say everything must change. They say that time will see it through. Well, I've listened and I've waited for that day. But I wake with this anger. And the pain won't let me be. And the smile I share. Is only there for show. If I hang on to this heartache. Then my soul will not be free. So I keep trying. But I just cannot let go. I can't let go. I need it to remind me. I can't let go. Oh, I just repeat the past. And though your arms are saying yes. I feel my heart keeps saying no. I want to love you. But I can't let go. I had to live through bad beginnings. And I've seen unhappy ends. So I close the book. Before the story starts. I'm just a witness to my lifetime. And I'm a stranger to my friends. I'm a traffic cop. A broken, damaged heart. Now you axe me to start over. But it's easier said than done. And the memories are strong when they arise. And when heartache comes a'calling. I won't even try to run. Cause it's songs that makes me know that I'm alive. I can't let go. I need it to remind me. I can't let go. Oh, I just repeat the past. And though your arms are saying yes. I feel my heart keeps saying no. I want to love you. I want to love you. I want to love you. But I can't let go. No, I can't let go. Won't you help me to let go"

I'm just a witness to my lifetime. And I'm a stranger to my friends. I'm a traffic cop. A broken, damaged heart. Now you axe me to start over. But it's easier said than done. And the memories are strong when they arise. And when heartache comes a'calling. I won't even try to run. Cause it's songs that makes me know that I'm alive. I can't let go. I need it to remind me. I can't let go. Oh, I just repeat the past. And though your arms are saying yes. I feel my heart keeps saying no. I want to love you. I want to love you. I want to love you. But I can't let go.

Only one thing you need to know. Just never think, just never think you've won. And you will, and you will, and you will, you will. No need to give in. There's noting you can't take. Cause what you're made of wasn't make to break. You're even stronger, stronger than you know. You could stand together or stand on your own. All your can dream. All you can plan. It's already in your hand. Own every breath. Own every minute. Who lives a life that's got no limits. Only one thing you need to know. Just never think, just never think you won't. And you will, and you will, and you will, you will. You got no fear to scout. So leave the life you're born to live. Living my positive. Own every breath. Own every minute. Who lives a life that's got no limits. Own every breath. Own every minute. Who lives a life that's got no limits. Only one thing you need to know. Just never think, just never think you've won. And you will, and you will, and you will, you will"
