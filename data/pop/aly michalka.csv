amphetamine,"On the seventh hour of the seventh day. The seventh son was looking for a seventh stage get away. The word came down from a blinding light. You got one chance, baby, baby, you better do it right. I was driving down on the 101. It was late at night and I was thinking 'bout the things I'd done. All of my regrets and, baby, all of my fears. I was slipping the car from gear to gear to gear. Hey hey hey. God bless the child, God bless his soul. God perish the idea that he'll die before he's old. You gotta be cool, you got to behave. And there'll be time for that when I'm lying in my grave. You gotta watch your step, or you'll lose your way. Take heed of your elders and do everything they say. Watch out for the man, the man who tolls the bells. But if I fear for the devil and I fear for myself. Then I'm gonna have to fear for everybody else. Oh yeah, I'm gonna fly (sha la la la la mamma yeah). I'm gonna live until the day I die. Ain't got time to wonder why. I'm gonna live until the day I die. Sha la la la mama yeah (repeat)"

brand new day,"How many of you people out there. Been hurt in some kind of love affair?. And how many times did you swear. That you'd never love again?. How many lonely, sleepless nights?. How many lies, how many fights?. And why would you want to. Put yourself through all of that again?. Love is pain I hear you say. Love is a cruel and bitter way of. Paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain. How could it be that what you need the most. Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?. You never want to feel so sad and lost again. One day you could be looking. Through an old book in rainy weather. You see a picture of her smiling at you. When you were still together. You could be walking down the street. And who should you chance to meet?. But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day?. Why don't we turn the clock to zero honey?. I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money. We're starting up a brand new day. Turn the clock all the way back. I wonder if she'll take me back. I'm thinking in a brand new way. Turn the clock to zero sister. You'll never know how much I missed her. Starting up a brand new day. Turn the clock to zero boss. The rivers wide we'll swim across. We're starting up a brand new day. It could happen to you. Just like it happened to me. There is simply no immunity. There's no guarantee. I say love is such a force if you find yourself in it. You need some time for reflection. You say, baby wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Turn the clock to zero honey. I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money. We're starting up a brand new day. Turn the clock to zero Mac. I'm begging her to take me back. I'm thinking in a brand new way. Turn the clock to zero boss. The rivers wide we'll swim across. Starting up a brand new day. Turn the clock to zero buddy. Don't wanna be no fuddy duddy. We're Starting up a brand new day. I'm the rhythm in your tune. I'm the sun and you're the moon. I'm the bat and you're the cave. You're the beach and I'm the wave. I'm the plough and you're the land. You're the glove and I'm the hand. I'm the train and you're the station. I'm the flagpole to your nation. I'm the present to your future. You're the wound and I'm the suture. You're the magnet to my pole. I'm the devil in your soul. You're the pupil I'm the teacher. You're the church and I'm the preacher. You're the flower I'm the rain. You're the tunnel I'm the train. Stand up, all you lovers in the world. Stand up and be counted, every boy and every girl. Stand up, all you lovers in the world. We're starting up a brand new day. You're the crop to my rotation. You're the sum of my equation. I'm the answer to your question. If you follow my suggestion. We could turn this ship around. And go up instead of down. You're the pan and I'm the handle. You're the flame and I'm the candle. Stand up, all you lovers in the world. Stand up and be counted, every boy and every girl. Stand up, all you lovers in the world. Starting up a brand new day"
