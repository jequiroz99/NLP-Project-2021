fireflies,You would not believe your eyes. If ten-million fireflies. Lit up the world. As I fell asleep. Cause they fill the open air. And leave teardrops everywhere. You'd think me rude. But I would just stand and stare. I'd like to make myself believe. That planet earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake. when I'm asleep. Cause everything is never as it seems. Cause I'd get a thousand hugs. From ten-thousand lightning bugs. As they try to teach me how to dance. A foxtrot above my head. A sock hop beneath my bed. A disco ball is just hanging by a thread. I'd like to make myself believe. That planet earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake. when I'm asleep. Cause everything is never as it seems. (When I fall asleep). Leave my door open just a crack. (Please take me away from here). Cause I feel like such an insomniac. (Please take me away from here). Why do I tire of counting sheep. (Please take me away from here). When I'm far too tired to fall asleep. To ten-million fireflies. I'm weird cause I hate goodbyes. I got misty eyes. As they said farewell. (Farewell). But I'll know where several are. If my dreams get real bizarre. Cause I'd save a few. And I'd keep them in a jar. I'd like to make myself believe. That planet earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm. asleep. Cause everything is never as it seems. (When I fall asleep). I'd like to make myself believe. That planet earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake. when I'm asleep. Cause everything is never as it seems. (When I fall asleep). I'd like to make myself believe. That planet earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake. when I'm asleep. Because my dreams are bursting at the seems

lucid dream,"I am a light sleeper. But I am a heavy dreamer. My imagination gives me wings. And I can go anywhere. And when I wander away. To some other place. I'm suddenly there. Way up in the air. Where passenger trains. Catch fire and fill the sky with flames. And that black rabbit of death. Wakes up in a breath. Of beautiful dreams. My heartache it seems. So terrible vain. Where fire and diamonds fall like rain. Do you believe in endless miracles?. Do you believe in the impossible?. Do you believe sleep is a time machine?. Do you believe in curiosity?. Do you believe in what you cannot see?. Do you believe life is a lucid dream?. Well, that's how you study the stars. That's how you study the stars. And that's how you know 'em by heart. Life is a lucid dream. Such is the path of a dreamer. I find my way by moonlight. My imagination gives me wings. And I can go anywhere. And when I wander away. To some other place.

vanilla twilight,"The stars lean down to kiss you,. And I lie awake I miss you,. Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere.. Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly,. But I'll miss your arms around me. I'd send a postcard to you dear,. Cause I wish you were here.. I'll watch the night turn light blue,. But it's not the same without you,. Because it takes two to whisper quietly,. The silence isn't so bad,. Till I look at my hands and feel sad,. Cause the spaces between my fingers. Are right where yours fit perfectly.. I'll find repose in new ways,. Though I haven't slept in two days,. Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone.. But drenched in Vanilla twilight,. I'll sit on the front porch all night,. Waist deep in thought because when I think of you.. I don't feel so alone.. I don't feel so alone.. I don't feel so alone.. As many times as I blink I'll think of you.... tonight.. I'll think of you tonight.. When violet eyes get brighter,. And heavy wings grow lighter,. I'll taste the sky and feel alive again.. And I'll forget the world that I knew,. But I swear I won't forget you,. Oh if my voice could reach back through the past,. I'd whisper in your ear,. Oh darling I wish you were here."

Wide eyes will always brighten the blue,. Chase your dreams, and remember me, speak bravery,. Because after all those wings will take you,. Up so high,. So bid the forest a fond goodbye,. As you brace the wind and,. Take to the sky,. You take to the sky. On the hills of lore and wonder,. There's a stormy world up there,. You can't whisper above the thunder,. But you can fly anywhere,. Purple burst of paper birds this,. Picture paints a thousand words,. So take a breath of mith and mystery,. And don't look back!. Birdseye view, awake the stars. 'Cause they're all around you,. Wide eyes will always brighten the blue,. Chase your dreams, and remember me, speak bravery,. Because after all those wings will take you,. Up so high,. So bid the forest a fond goodbye,.

if my heart was a house,"You're the sky that I fell through. And I remember the view whenever I'm holding you. The sun hung from a string. Looking down on the world as it warmed over everything. Chills run down my spine as our fingers entwine. And your sighs harmonize with mine. Unmistakeably, I can still feel your heart. Beat fast when you dance with me. We got older and I should've known. (Do you feel alive?). That I'd feel colder when I walk alone. (Oh, but you'll survive). So I may as well ditch my dismay. (Bombs away, bombs away). Circle me and the needle moves gracefully. Back and forth. If my heart was a compass you'd be north. Risk it all 'cause I'll catch you if you fall. Wherever you go. If my heart was a house you'd be home. It makes me smile because you said it best. I would clearly feel blessed. If the sun rose up from the west. Flower balm perfume. All my clothes smell like you. 'Cause your favorite shade is navy blue. I walk slowly when I'm on my own. (Do you feel alive?). Yeah, but frankly I still feel alone. (Oh, but you'll survive). So I may as well ditch my dismay. (Bombs away, bombs away). Circle me and the needle moves gracefully. Back and forth. If my heart was a compass you'd be north. Risk it all 'cause I'll catch you if you fall. Wherever you go. If my heart was a house you'd be home"
be brave,"In a basement of an empty house. I slept on the floor like a vagrant. I braved a Minnesota winter night. And drove to a movie feelin' lonely. And as I thawed my heart out by the light. Of the silver screen. I was unaware that you were there. In the dark, a silhouette. Was climbing up the stairs. And what I thought in the parking lot. Was like I just wanna know your name. I drove away with not much to say. But in my hand I held the paper bird. And written on it were the words. ""Be brave! "". Wild flower knew I wasn't well. But on the kitchen floor I got better again. I grabbed my keys and drove toward a star. And there I was understood for the first time in my life. 'Cause that's when I was introduced to true serendipity. I knew it when you showed up again. In the snow, I was always told. Your heart is where you're home. And what I thought in the coffee shop. Was like ""The last eight hours was a dream"". I drove away with not much to say. But in my hand I held a paper bird. And written on it were the words. Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh okay. ""I'll be brave"". Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh okay. ""I'll be brave"". And in my mind. After all this time I think. ""Ain't life beautiful and strange? "". I'm blown away. With no words to say. 'Cause I'll forever be amazed. How I learned the meaning of the phrase. Be brave. Be brave. Be brave. Be brave"

wonderfilled anthem (oreo tv commercial),Wonder if I gave an oreo to the big bad wolf. How would the story go?. Would he still go huff and puff. Or would he bring those pigs cool stuff. To decorate the deck he helped them build?. Would they not get killed?. Wonder if I gave an oreo to a vampire in a creepy show. Would he not act so undead?. Would he thirst for milk instead?. I've just got this feeling that it might work out all right. 'cause cream does wondrous things. Inside a chocolate sandwich dream. If I gave 'em to great white sharks. Would they share 'em with baby seals?. Would they call up a giant squid. for a friendly meal?. Wonder if I gave an oreo. Wonder if I gave an oreo. What if I gave an oreo to you?

enchanted,"There I was again tonight. Forcing laughter, faking smiles. Same old tired, lonely place. Walls of insincerity. Shifting eyes and vacancy. Vanished when I saw your face. All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you. Your eyes whispered ""Have we met?"". Across the room, your silhouette. Starts to make its way to me. The playful conversation starts. Counter all your quick remarks. Like passing notes in secrecy. All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you. Oh Taylor I was so enchanted to meet you too. This night is sparkling, don't you let it go. I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home. I'll spend forever wondering if you knew. I was enchanted to meet you too. The lingering question kept me up. 2 am, who do you love?. I wonder 'til I'm wide awake. Now I'm pacing back and forth. Wishing you were at my door. I'd open up and you would say. Hey, It was enchanting to meet you. Oh Taylor I was so enchanted to meet you too. This night is sparkling, don't you let it go. I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home. I'll spend forever wondering if you knew. I was enchanted to meet you too. And this is me praying that. This was the very first page. Not where the story line ends. My thoughts will echo your name. Until I see you again. These are the words I held back. As I was leaving too soon. I was enchanted to meet you too. Please don't be in love with someone else. Please don't have somebody waiting on you. Please don't be in love with someone else. Please don't have somebody waiting on you. This night is sparkling, don't you let it go. I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home. I'll spend forever wondering if you knew. This night is flawless, don't you let it go. I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone. Taylor, I'll spend my whole life wondering if you knew. I was enchanted to meet you, too. I was never in love with someone else. I never had somebody waiting on me. 'Cause you were all of my dreams come true. And I just wish you knew. Taylor I was so in love with you."

hello seattle,"Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer. In the hills and highlands. I fall asleep in hospital parking lots. And awake in your house. Hello Seattle, I am a manteray. Deep beneath the blue waves. I'll crawl the sandy bottom of Puget Sound. And construct a summer home. Hello Seattle, I am the crescent moon. Shining down on your face. I will disguise myself as a sleeping pill. And descend inside of you. Hello Seattle, I am a cold seahorse. Feeling warm in your sand. I sing about the tide and the ocean surf. Rolling in the evening breeze. Hello Seattle, I am an albatross. on the docks and your boats. I sail above your inlets and interstates. Through the rain and open wind. Hello Seattle, I am an old lighthouse. Throwing beams of bright lights. Red in the morning, blue in the evening sun. Taken heed from everyone. Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer. In the hills and highlands. I fall asleep in hospital parking lots. Take me above your light. Carry me through the night. Hold me secure in flight. Sing me to sleep tonight. Take me above your light (Hello Seattle I am). Carry me through the night (a mountaineer, In the. hills). Hold me secure in flight (and highlands I fall. asleep in hospital)"

waving through a window (from dear evan hansen),"I've learned to slam on the brake. Before I even turn the key. Before I make the mistake. Before I lead with the worst of me. Give them no reason to stare. No slipping up if you slip away. So I got nothing to share. No, I got nothing to say. Step out, step out of the sun. If you keep getting burned. Step out, step out of the sun. Because you've learned, because you've learned. On the outside, always looking in. Will I ever be more than I've always been?. 'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass. I'm waving through a window. I try to speak, but nobody can hear. So I wait around for an answer to appear. While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass. I'm waving through a window, oh. Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?. We start with stars in our eyes. We start believing that we belong. But every sun doesn't rise. And no one tells you where you went wrong. Step out, step out of the sun. If you keep getting burned. Step out, step out of the sun. Because you've learned, because you've learned. On the outside, always looking in. Will I ever be more than I've always been?. 'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass. Waving through a window. I try to speak, but nobody can hear. So I wait around for an answer to appear. While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass. Waving through a window, oh. Can anybody see, is anybody waving?. When you're falling in a forest. and there's nobody around. Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?. When you're falling in a forest. and there's nobody around. Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?. When you're falling in a forest. and there's nobody around. Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?.

light of christmas (feat. tobymac),"Build a showman with the wind at his back. Got the day planned and presents to wrap. Fight the windchill with all of my friends. 'Cause it's Christmastime again. Going downtown and spreading good cheer. Handing gloves out when we volunteer. For the children, grinning from ear to ear. Singing Christmastime is here. ha-ha-ha ho-ho-ho. Four-wheel driving through the snow. Fighting the cold with some hot cocoa. Grabbing grandma, to the mall we go. And there's a man outside with a bucket and a bell. Wants to go home with a story to tell. And he's reminding us that his Christmas. Got nothing to do with living for himself. It's the light of Christmas shining through.

2015,This is a song for my friends. And fans from miles around. I know it's been a long time. Since I put an album out. But I swear it won't be long now. Till the ghost kid reappears. In the summer of 2015. When the music fills your ears. Yes. Alright now. 'Cause dreams of mine came true. I hope the sad songs I write. Means some more to you. Yes. Alright now. The time is here at last. I know it's long since overdue. But Owl City is back
air traffic,"The bird is here,. And we are off,. To wherever those wings take us.. The atmosphere,. Is crawling with airlines,. That wind through the clouds,. And look down on the crowds.. Relax your back,. And let the noise,. Sing you to sleep in my, arms.. If you awake,. Before we arrive,. I will carry you down,. And I won't make a sound.. The scent is strong,. As we move on,. And breathe in the pristine,. Crime, scene.. The false veneer,. Is old like a. Substitute, volunteer,. From, oh, some other year.. I'm just a show,. As far as I can tell,.

be brave,"In a basement of an empty house. I slept on the floor like a vagrant. I braved a Minnesota winter night. And drove to a movie feelin' lonely. And as I thawed my heart out by the light. Of the silver screen. I was unaware that you were there. In the dark, a silhouette. Was climbing up the stairs. And what I thought in the parking lot. Was like I just wanna know your name. I drove away with not much to say. But in my hand I held the paper bird. And written on it were the words. ""Be brave! "". Wild flower knew I wasn't well. But on the kitchen floor I got better again. I grabbed my keys and drove toward a star. And there I was understood for the first time in my life. 'Cause that's when I was introduced to true serendipity. I knew it when you showed up again. In the snow, I was always told. Your heart is where you're home. And what I thought in the coffee shop. Was like ""The last eight hours was a dream"". I drove away with not much to say. But in my hand I held a paper bird. And written on it were the words. Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh okay. ""I'll be brave"". Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh okay. ""I'll be brave"". And in my mind. After all this time I think. ""Ain't life beautiful and strange? "". I'm blown away. With no words to say. 'Cause I'll forever be amazed. How I learned the meaning of the phrase. Be brave. Be brave. Be brave. Be brave"

beautiful times (feat. lindsey stirling),"A spark soaring down through the pouring rain. And restoring life to the lighthouse. A slow motion wave on the ocean stirs. My emotion up like a rain cloud. When did the sky turn black?. And when will the light come back?. A cab driver turned to skydiver, then to survivor. Dying to breakdown. A blood brother, surrogate mother. Hugging each other, crying their eyes out. When did the sky turn black?. And when will the light come back?. I'm ecstatic like a drug addict. Locked in the attic, strung out and spell bound. I fought all through the night. Oh oh, but I made it alive. The sun's starting to rise. Oh oh, these are beautiful times. This fight of my life is so hard. So hard, so hard. But I'm gonna survive. Oh oh, these are beautiful times. A bad feeling burned through the ceiling. Leaving my healing heart with a new scar. A dead fire rose and rose higher. Like a vampire up from the graveyard. When did the sky turn black?. And when will the light come back?. We all suffer but we recover. Just to discover life where we all are. I fought all through the night. Oh oh, but I made it alive. The sun is starting to rise. Oh oh, these are beautiful times. This fight of my life is so hard. So hard, so hard. But I'm gonna survive. Oh oh, these are beautiful times. This fight of my life is so hard. So hard, so hard. But I'm gonna survive. Oh oh, these are beautiful times. My heart's burning bad and it's turning black. But I'm learning how to be stronger. And sincerely, I love you dearly, oh. But I'm clearly destined to wander"
bird with a broken wing,"So I walk alone down the darkest roads. Cause I've always known how the story goes. When the curtain falls I'll be wearing thin. Clawing at the walls as they're closing in. In this twisted plot I was destined for. I'm an astronaut on the ocean floor. So misunderstood 'till the bloody end. How I wish I could do it all again. It feels like I'm a lone survivor. Forgotten in a dark and deadly world. And on my own I walk alone. To see the sun again I'd give anything. But life demands a final chapter. A story that we all must leave behind. It's do or die, and this is mine. The anthem of a bird with a broken wing. It's another night of the living dead. Like a viper bite in a spiderweb. It's so deathly dark in the alleyway. And a bleeding heart makes you easy prey. I would run and hide for the afternoon. With the butterfly in the panic room. Though I won't be missed, I would say it's time. For a different twist in the story line. It feels like I'm a lone survivor. Forgotten in a dark and deadly world. And on my own I walk alone. To see the sun again I'd give anything.

How can you close and fail?. Suddenly burn so pale?. Bright eyes.. Is it a kind of shadow,. Reaching into the night,. Wandering over the hills unseen,. Or is it a dream?.

butterfly wings,"If I was a raindrop. Would you be my thunderstorm. It's cold, so surround me. With rain clouds to keep me warm. I feel like I'm falling. So darling don't let me go. The thought is appalling but should I slip away. Into the stormy sea will you remember me. Asleep in a warm cocoon. We dream of lovely things. We're both gonna wake up soon. So we hope that tomorrow brings us our butterfly wings. If I was a grain of sand. Would you be Miami Beach. So dusty with starlight. Close your eyes and cuddle close to me. I'll try not to wake you. Or make a sound while you're dosing off. But in the night shift the high tides sweep me away from you. Tell me again my dear will you be waiting here. Whenever we leave the ground. And take to the sky. I'll smile as I'm gazing down. Cause I've always wonder why we won't need feathers to fly"

captains and cruiseships,"I am stuck in L.A through the week, and can?t get away. And you?re alone on the pier in West Palm Beach on your holiday. Stormy nights re-awake the stomachache that I?ve acquired. From feeling down, things look grim and I?m so sick, of being tired. Apartment lights go dark, and it?s depressing but what can I do?. Midnight streets feel dead, when I am so used to driving with you. Brighter lights fill the nights and bluer skies reflect in your eyes. As I inspect and analyze all these dreams I don?t recognize. If you?re still up when the ships in the port, prepare to set sail. Comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail. Inside my head your voice is still resounding but what can I do?. The empty rooms feel cold when I am so used to being with you. Count the stars, watch the waves, absorb the summer sun and think of me. When you explore hidden coves and tiny island chains throughout the sea. Can you still hear my voice when I?m outside from over the phone?. For what its worth darling dear, I wish you were here ?cause I feel alone. When you were home, we'd sing but since you?ve left I don?t hear anything. And though I feel so sad I can?t believe things are really that bad. Old captains and brand new cruise ships. Sailing over the briny sea. When I crash my beloved desk job. And swim through the debris. I?ll cut loose and leave this madhouse. Bound for the Atlantic blue. I?ll stroll down your tree-lined driveway. And sail the ocean with you.

cave in,"Please take a long hard look through your text book. 'Cause I'm history. When I strap my helmet on I'll be long gone. 'Cause I've been dying to leave.

Of quote, ""diamonds in the rough"". Because my backbone is paper thin. Get me out of this cavern. Or I'll cave in. If the bombs go off. The sun will still be shining. Because we've heard it said that every mushroom cloud. Has a silver lining. (Though I'm always undermining too deep to know). Swallow a drop of gravel and blacktop. 'Cause the road tastes like wintergreen. The wind and the rain smell of oil and octane. Mixed with stale gasoline. I'll soak up the sound trying to sleep on the wet ground. I'll get ten minutes give-or-take. 'Cause I just don't foresee myself getting drowsy. When cold integrity keeps me wide awake. Get me out of this cavern. Or I'll cave in. I'll keep my helmet on just in case my head caves in. 'Cause if my thoughts collapse or my framework snaps. It'll make a mess like you wouldn't believe. Tie my handlebars to the stars so I stay on track. And if my intentions stray I'll wrench them away. Then I'll take my leave and I won't even look back. I won't even look back"

dental care,"I brush my teeth. and look in the mirror. And laugh out loud. as I'm beaming from ear to ear. I'd rather pick flowers. instead of fight. And rather than flaunt my style. I'd flash you a smile. Of clean pearly whites. I've been to the dentist. A thousand times, so I know the drill. I smooth my hair, sit back in the chair. but somehow I still get the chills. Have a seat. He says pleasantly. As he shakes my hand. And practically laughs at me. Open up nice and wide. He says, peering in. And with a smirk he says,. ""Don't have a fit, this'll just pinch a bit"". As he tries not to grin. When hygienists leave on long vacations. That's when dentists scream and lose their patience. Talking only brings the toothaches on. Because I say the stupidest things. So if my resolve goes south. I'll swallow my pride with an aspirin. And shut my mouth. Golf and alcohol don't mix. And that's why I don't drink and drive. Because, good grief, I'd knock out my teeth. And hafta kiss my smile goodbye. I've been to the dentist. A thousand times, so I know the drill.

designer skyline,"Affection, the gifted architect. Is making a draft and beautiful design. The options and possibilities. Are endless when we connect and re-align. Collections of books and documents. Arise and parade around my cluttered desk. Reworking the math and measurements. Until I'm convinced these plans are picturesque. Like mountains in the Midwest. Reaction creates the columns dark. And wide like the roads around Fort Lauderdale. The structures begin to take their shape. Before I've designed the public monorail. The turnpike and high-speed motorway. Connect and enclose the quaint suburban streets. The airport, the broad suspension bridge. The lake and the beach where several rivers meet. Compounded from the spreadsheet. A city sparkles in the night. How can it glow so bright?. The neighborhoods surround the soft florescent light. Designer skyline in my head. Abstract and still well-read. You went from numbered lines to buildings overhead"

early birdie,"Good evening, shuttle bus. Tell me where you're gonna take us. Some place that I have never been. It's chic transportation to new destination. Where I leave my reflection on the glass. I'd ask but we don't know. How far these interstates go. Or how deep the city roots go down. In chilly sub-depth railways. The weathered concrete stairways. Provide me with a means of getting home. If I ever leave.... On crystal sand, we sleep hand-in-hand. While soothing words hover like hummingbirds. So many sights to see. So wake up like an early birdie. And we'll get a head start on the day. Oh stained-glass skyways and crowded 6 lane highways. If I look back would I begin to leave?. Will they remember me?. Circuit flights bend the lights when I am spent. And tour guides make happy brides feel heaven-sent. Good evening, shuttle bus. Tell me where you're gonna take us. On crystal sand, we sleep hand-in-hand. While soothing words.... On crystal sand, we sleep hand-in-hand. While soothing words hover like hummingbirds. Good evening, shuttle bus. Tell me where you're gonna take us"
embers,"There were days when each hour was a war I fought to survive. There were nights full of nightmares and I dreaded closing my eyes. There were skies that burst open. With a downpour to drown me alive. But the world took a spark. Like a match in the dark and the fire brought me to life. So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high. 'cause there's no other way we can stay alive. 'Cause we're burning bright as we all unite. And when it's all said and done. we'll shine like the sun so don't let the fire die. And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light. And though the embers are new,. whatever you do just don't let the fire die. And you'll find, there'll be mornings. when the ashes and embers are cold. But you'll fight with a passion and you'll never stop. 'cause you know. Yeah you know it gets better and your story is yet to be told. Every push, every shove, every war, every love. Yeah the coals are beginning to glow. So I'm fanning the flames to climb. so high 'cause there's no other way we. can stay alive. 'Cause we're burning bright as we all unite. And when it's all said and done. we'll shine like the sun so don't let the. fire die. And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light. And though the embers are new,. whatever you do just don't let the fire die. Don't let the fire die. It gets better. Just don't let the fire die, no.... 'Cause we're burning bright as we all unite. And when it's all said and done. we'll shine like the sun so don't let the. fire die. And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light. And though the embers are new,. whatever you do just don't let the fire die. And though the embers are new,. whatever you do just don't let the fire die. Don't let the fire die..."
enchanted,"There I was again tonight. Forcing laughter, faking smiles. Same old tired, lonely place. Walls of insincerity. Shifting eyes and vacancy. Vanished when I saw your face. All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you. Your eyes whispered ""Have we met?"". Across the room, your silhouette. Starts to make its way to me. The playful conversation starts. Counter all your quick remarks. Like passing notes in secrecy. All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you. Oh Taylor I was so enchanted to meet you too. This night is sparkling, don't you let it go. I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home. I'll spend forever wondering if you knew. I was enchanted to meet you too. The lingering question kept me up. 2 am, who do you love?. I wonder 'til I'm wide awake. Now I'm pacing back and forth. Wishing you were at my door. I'd open up and you would say. Hey, It was enchanting to meet you. Oh Taylor I was so enchanted to meet you too. This night is sparkling, don't you let it go. I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home. I'll spend forever wondering if you knew. I was enchanted to meet you too. And this is me praying that. This was the very first page. Not where the story line ends. My thoughts will echo your name. Until I see you again. These are the words I held back. As I was leaving too soon. I was enchanted to meet you too. Please don't be in love with someone else. Please don't have somebody waiting on you. Please don't be in love with someone else. Please don't have somebody waiting on you. This night is sparkling, don't you let it go. I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home. I'll spend forever wondering if you knew. This night is flawless, don't you let it go. I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone. Taylor, I'll spend my whole life wondering if you knew. I was enchanted to meet you, too. I was never in love with someone else. I never had somebody waiting on me. 'Cause you were all of my dreams come true. And I just wish you knew. Taylor I was so in love with you."
fiji water,"Got an email at 22. Told me I could be a star. On a plane for the first time. I couldn't wait to start. Landed at Jfk. Father Christmas picked me up. Checked in to a dream hotel and I thought. ""There's no such thing as luck"". I walked in to my interview. And I thought ""There's no such thing as luck"". And oh, if I only knew then what I know now. I'd stand like a one-man band and I'd say. All this is new to me but. Here's how it's gonna be. And I'd say. ""Hey, there is more to me than meets the eye. Let me be who I wanna be"". And I'd say. ""Hey, I'm an oddity and that's all right. Let me fly and follow my dreams"". Then I'd say. ""Hey thanks for the weekend. A good time was had by all"". And I'd say. ""Hey thanks for the weekend. I ain't a smooth-talker but thanks for the Fiji water"". Dinner under a palm tree. I had so much on my mind. Amazed by the bright lights. I stayed up half the night. And boy I took a leap of faith. With nowhere else to go but up. I walked in to my interview. And I thought. ""There's no such thing as luck"". And oh, if I only knew then what I know now. I'd stand like a one man band and I'd say. All this is new to me, but here's how it's gonna be. And I'd say. ""Hey, there is more to me than meets the eye. Let me be who I wanna be"". And I'd say. ""Hey, I'm an oddity and that's alright. Let me fly and follow my dreams"". And I'd say. ""Hey, thanks for the weekend. A good time was had by all"". And I'd say. ""Hey, thanks for the weekend. I ain't a spin doctor but thanks for the offer. And by the way. Hey thanks for the weekend. You know I had a ball"". And I'd say. ""Hey, thanks for the weekend. I ain't a smooth-talker but thanks for the Fiji Water"". Thanks for the Fiji Water. I laughed when I got back home and I thought. ""There's no such thing as luck"""
firebird,"We used to talk all night and not say a word. When I would hop into your red Firebird. And, man alive, we would drive just to drive around town. 'Cause in your car we understood and figured out. That everything changes. Everything changes. Tell me why I look back and I wanna cry. Sometimes I feel like we grew up too fast. You and I had the time of our younger lives. Sometimes I sigh and think about the past. But it's alright, cause everything changes. A basement full of boys building homemade bombs. Aj cut his finger and said ""go get your mom"". I saw it all through the windshield of my white truck, Troy. Lotsa ups, lotsa downs, lots of growing up. 'Cause everything changes. Everything changes. Tell me why I look back and I wanna cry. Sometimes I feel like we grew up too fast. You and I had the time of our younger lives. Sometimes I sigh and think about the past. But it's alright, cause everything changes. Hey Billy, remember when. It was just us (it was just us). Pretending we were Nash and Coral. On the school bus. I wouldn't change a thing, 'cause everything changes. (Changes) x3. Life is different now and that's okay with me. I moved away and you started a family. But deep inside you and I are still the same kids. 'Cause you're my brother and that won't ever change. Even though everything changes. Tell me why I look back and I wanna cry. Sometimes I feel like we grew up too fast. You and I had the time of our younger lives. Sometimes I sigh and think about the past. But it's alright, yeah it's alright. There's a new guest room in my parents' home. The carpet got replaced a couple years ago. Because it isn't my bedroom anymore. There's new photographs on the freezer door. But it's alright, 'cause everything changes. (Everything changes). We should talk all night and not say a word. ('Cause everything changes). Let me hop into your red Firebird again"
fireflies,You would not believe your eyes. If ten-million fireflies. Lit up the world. As I fell asleep. Cause they fill the open air. And leave teardrops everywhere. You'd think me rude. But I would just stand and stare. I'd like to make myself believe. That planet earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake. when I'm asleep. Cause everything is never as it seems. Cause I'd get a thousand hugs. From ten-thousand lightning bugs. As they try to teach me how to dance. A foxtrot above my head. A sock hop beneath my bed. A disco ball is just hanging by a thread. I'd like to make myself believe. That planet earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake. when I'm asleep. Cause everything is never as it seems. (When I fall asleep). Leave my door open just a crack. (Please take me away from here). Cause I feel like such an insomniac. (Please take me away from here). Why do I tire of counting sheep. (Please take me away from here). When I'm far too tired to fall asleep. To ten-million fireflies. I'm weird cause I hate goodbyes. I got misty eyes. As they said farewell. (Farewell). But I'll know where several are. If my dreams get real bizarre. Cause I'd save a few. And I'd keep them in a jar. I'd like to make myself believe. That planet earth turns slowly.

fuzzy blue lights,If I could look across the country. From California to New Jersey. Then I would count the parks and lake resorts. And number all the jets and airports. All those rather dreary rain clouds still bother me. Cuz I look through the camera eyepiece and cannot see. If I could open up my window. And see from Tampa Bay to Juneau. Then I would survey all those open miles. And line them up in single file. Everywhere I look I see green scenic sublime. And all those oceanic vistas are so divine. If I was standing on the balcony. And you were walking down below. I'd feel rather depressed and out of place. And lonely just to watch you go. If you were swinging from the highway overpass. Within the western hemisphere. I'd feel rather afraid and insincere. If you began to disappear. If I was walking through a sad art gallery. And you were driving through the night. I'd feel rather alone and ill at ease. Beneath the brilliant showroom light. If I was flying on a plane above your town. And you were gazing at the sky. Somehow I'd feel intact and reassured. If you began to wave goodbye
galaxies,"Call back the cap-com,. Tick off the time-bomb,. Let felicity fly!. Armour the airlock,. Blanket the bedrock,. And kiss the planet goodbye!. Dear God, I was terribly lost,. When the galaxies crossed,. And the Sun went dark.. Dear God, You're the only North Star,. I would follow this far.. Fight back the flight deck,. Bring on the breakneck,. Cue the solar eclipse!. Summit the sunset,. Dovetail the dragnet,. And blow your backbone to bits!. Dear God, I was terribly lost,. When the galaxies crossed,. And the Sun went dark.. Dear God, You're the only North Star,. I would follow this far.. Oh telescope, keep an eye on my only hope,. Lest I blink and be swept off the narrow road.. Hercules, you've got nothing to say to me,. 'Cause you're not the blinding light that I need.. For He is the saving grace of the Galaxies!. He is the saving grace of the Galaxies.. Dear God, I was terribly lost,. When the galaxies crossed,. And the Sun went dark.. Dear God, You're the only North Star,. I would follow this far."
garden party,"I went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends. A chance to share old memories and play our songs again. When I got to the garden party, they all knew my name. But no one recognized me, I didn't look the same. But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well. You see, you can't please everyone so you gotta please yourself. People came from miles around and everyone was there. Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air. And over in the corner, much to my surprise. Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes, wearing his disguise. But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well. You see, you can't please everyone so you gotta please yourself. I played them all the old songs, I thought that's why they came. But no one heard the music, we didn't look the same. I said hello to Mary Lou, she belongs to me. And when I sang a song about a Honky Tonk, it was time to leave. But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well. You see, you can't please everyone so you gotta please yourself. Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Goode. Playing guitar like ringing a bell and looking like he should. If you gotta play at garden parties, I wish you a lot of luck. But if memories were all I sang, I'd rather drive a truck. But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well. You see, you can't please everyone so you gotta please yourself. You see, you can't please everyone so you gotta please yourself. You can't please everyone so you gotta please yourself"

I swear, there's a lot of vegetables out there,. That crop up for air,. Yeah, I never thought, we were two peas in a pod,. Until you suddenly bloomed, then I knew,. That I'd always love you.. Oh, I'll always love you too.. If the green left the grass on the other side,. I would make like a tree and leave,. If I reached for your hand would your eyes get wide?. Who knew the other side could be so green?. If the green left the grass on the other side,. I would make like a tree and leave,. If I reached for your hand would your eyes get wide?.

hospital flowers,"I survived a dreadful accident. In the car crash of the century. My shattered hopes collapsed on cold cement. But in the back of the ambulance. I'd never felt so content.. A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me. And now my vision can render the scene,. A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris,. Happiness returned to me through a grave emergency.. Da da da, da da da,. Da da da, da da da.. I tossed and turned, in sterile apathy. Until the violets arrived for me. The bouquet burst and blossoms filled the room. And the police got smaller as they grew taller. And taught me to bloom.. A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me. And now my vision can render the scene. A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris. Happiness returned to me through a grave emergency.. The curtains decayed, the daylight poured in. I was never afraid, of the darkness again. My burns were third degree. But I'd been set free. 'Cause grace had finally found its way to me.. A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me. And now my vision can render the scene. A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris. Happiness returned to me. Da da da, da da da,. Happiness returned to me,. Da da da, da da da,. Happiness returned to me,. through a grave emergency.. Da da da, da da da,. Da da da, da da da,. Through a grave emergency.. Da da da, da da da,. Da da da, da da da,. Happiness returned to me,. Through a grave emergency.. By: CarlosEdn"
hot air balloon,"[Verse 1]. We wrote a prelude, to our own fairy tale. and bought a parachute, at a church rummage sale. and with a 'mean' sewing machine, and miles of thread. we sowed the day above LA in navy and red. we wound a race track, through your moms kitchen. chairs. and fought the shadows back, down your dark basement stairs. I lit a match then let it catch, to light up the room. and then you yelled as we beyelled an old maroon hot air balloon. [Chorus]. I'll be out of my mind, and you'll be out of ideas. pretty soon. so let`s spend, the afternoon in a cold hot air. balloon. leave your jacket behind, lean out and touch the. treetops over town. I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down. [Verse 2]. We drank the great lakes, like cold lemonade. And both got stomach aches, sprawled out in the shade. so bored to death you held your breath, and I tried not to yawn. you made my frown turn upside down, and now my worries are gone. [Chorus]. I'll be out of my mind, and you'll be out of ideas. pretty soon. so lets spend, the afternoon in a cold hot air. balloon. leave your jacket behind, lean out and touch the. treetops over town. I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back. down. [Chorus].

house wren,"I'm a house wren. Haunted for a house. I haven't found one. I'm under look at. For a home, to call my own. A private residence. Through the grapevine. I heard an empty guard. Is hangin up somewhere. On some old lady's porch. I'll pack my bags. And off I'll go. To my new humble abode. I'm gonna sing. At the top of my lungs. Cause it's a beautiful day. I'm gonna. Spread my wings. 'cause as far as I know. I am half way home. I'm a house wren. Who needs a summer home. A country farm house or a quiet bungalow. Not too big, and not too small.

At the top of my lungs. Cause it's a beautiful day. I'm gonna. Spread my wings. 'cause as far as I know. I am half way home. I'm a house wren. Still haunted for a house. But I got a song and.

how i became the sea,"June was the lobster shell I dug by hand. A haven that hid me well beneath the sand. The wide windy waves washed in, but I stayed dry. The great breakers broke again, as I nodded off inside. And then, when the empress ran aground,. And my eyes turned blue and green,. I heard a gorgeous sound,. And that's when it became a dream. When the sky fell in,. When the hurricanes came for me,. I could finally crash again,. And that's how I became the sea. I wrenched the engines off and drank them down. The depths turned the iron soft as they swiftly drowned. And I brought the ocean side to its rusty knees. As I felt the even tide deepen my shallow dreams. And then, when the empress ran aground,. And my eyes turned blue and green,. I heard a gorgeous sound,. And that's when it became a dream. When the sky fell in,. When the hurricanes came for me,. I could finally crash again,. And that's how I became the sea. When the sky fell in (when the sky fell in). When the hurricanes came for me. I could finally crash again,. And that's how I became the sea (how I became the sea). That's how I became the sea (how I became the sea). That's how I became the sea. When the sky fell in,. When the hurricanes came for me. I could finally crash again,.

i found love,"I was so young and reckless. It was all a blur but there you were. And your love left me breathless. When the fairy dust fell over us. Yeah I, I felt like I could fly. Cause I, I found love. So take my hand, and shed a tear. Before I'm gone, it's now or never. I'll hold you close, the end is near. But love goes on, and on forever. It's so dark in my mind. I cross my heart and hope to die. I'm so bad, at goodbyes. I hold my breath, and close my eyes. I don't have a lot left. Oh, how did it end so fast?. I say, with my last breath. It's a perfect day, to float away. When the sparks, flew between us. I saw you glow, and had to know. Where our journey would lead us. Til' the story end, and back again. Yeah I, I felt like I could fly. Cause I, I found love. So lead me home, and lift me up. Above the stars, and even higher. I'm not afraid, because your love. It falls like rain, and burns like fire. It's so dark in my mind. I cross my heart and hope to die. I'm so bad, at goodbyes. I hold my breath, and close my eyes. I don't have a lot left. Oh, how did it end so fast?.

That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna leave. And Juliet's romantic balcony. Wears out the wall, and I learned after all. That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall. As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn. As your sweet dreams dissolve, I'll crash and burn. While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe. As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me. When you're alone. I hope my ghost, never leaves. 'Cause when I'm home. Your painful memory, is always haunting me. As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn. As your sweet dreams dissolve, I'll crash and burn. While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe. As you stir in your sleep, the thought is killing to me. When I see you around, my eyes get wide. When you race through my mind, I die inside. While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe. As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me. I hope you think of me, I hope you think of me"

Chills run down my spine as our fingers entwine. And your sighs harmonize with mine. Unmistakeably, I can still feel your heart. Beat fast when you dance with me. We got older and I should've known. (Do you feel alive?). That I'd feel colder when I walk alone. (Oh, but you'll survive). So I may as well ditch my dismay. (Bombs away, bombs away). Circle me and the needle moves gracefully. Back and forth. If my heart was a compass you'd be north. Risk it all 'cause I'll catch you if you fall. Wherever you go. If my heart was a house you'd be home. It makes me smile because you said it best. I would clearly feel blessed. If the sun rose up from the west. Flower balm perfume. All my clothes smell like you. 'Cause your favorite shade is navy blue. I walk slowly when I'm on my own. (Do you feel alive?). Yeah, but frankly I still feel alone. (Oh, but you'll survive). So I may as well ditch my dismay.

lonely lullaby,"Symphony of silver tears. Sing to me and sooth the ring in my ears. Overcast these gloomy nights wear on. But I'm holding fast because it's darkest just before the dawn.

montana,"A fifteen year old kid from St. Paul. Hopped on a train and headed west. Got a job at a St. Mary Restaurant. Washing dishes and making friends. The years went by like the seasons. And they brought him a lifetime of joy. He bought ten or twelve acres of heaven. With a paradise vantage point. And he built a cabin at the foot of the mountains. That stole his heart when he was a boy. On North Fork Road you're almost home. Get lost in Montana. Where your heart can finally roam. Get lost in Montana. Where the mountains call you home. Get lost forever in Montana. His son worked hard in West Glacier. His daughter sold souvenirs. And he always went back to Polebridge. With his family every year. To his green tin roof in the Rockies. And a sky so full of stars. His spirit lives in these mountians. Where Montana first stole his heart. On North Fork Road, you're almost home. Get lost in Montana. Where your heart can finally roam. Get lost in Montana. Where the mountains call you home. Get lost forever in Montana. Two words on a bumper sticker. Were all I needed to read. I found myself for the first time. When Montana enchanted me. So get lost in the Big Sky country. Where adventure calls your name. Every moment is worth more than diamonds. When you spend time in the treasure state. So get lost in the Big Sky country. And let your heart lead the way"

'Cause they haven't met my Dad. He loves his workshop. And rock and roll. He's got a hot rod. And a heart of gold. And you could say he's a man. Of few words. But he talks a lot within. And even though I'm a little taller. I still look up to him. He built me a house. In the arms of a tree. He taught me to drive. And to fight, and to dream. When he looks in my eyes. I hope he can see. That my Dad's a Hero to me. Rust-ridden fenders. and doors full of dings. Somehow he can fix about anything. I didn't think he knew how to cry. Till our dog died that year. He doesn't always say ""I love you"". But I can hear him loud and clear. He built me a house. In the arms of a tree. He taught me to drive. And to fight, and to dream. When he looks in my eyes. I hope he can see. That my Dad's a Hero to me. He built me a house. In the arms of a tree. He taught me to drive. And to fight, and to dream. When he looks in my eyes. I hope he can see.

on the wing,"Breathe and I’ll carry you away into the velvet sky. And we’ll stir the stars around. And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay. And plummet out of sight and sound. The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills. Where I live in the alpine heights. Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights. Alone, awake and thinking of...the weekend we were in love. Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull. A thousand miles from the tide. But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls. Distract me so I stay inside. I wish the rockets stayed over the promenade. Cuz I would make a hook and eye. And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I. We’re hanging on so take us high. To sing the world goodbye:. I am floating away. Lost in a silent ballet. I’m dreaming you’re out in the blue and I am right beside you. Awake to take in the view. Late nights and early parades. Still photos and noisy arcades. My darling, we’re both on the wing, look down and keep on singing!. And we can go anywhere. Are you there?. Are you there, or are you just a decoy dream in my head?. Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone?"
panda bear,I'm moving to Tokyo. Cuz I'm tired of San Francisco. My contracts are finally void. And I am getting out. On houses and building tops. I swallow the beams and sundrops. If my echos could reach your ears. Then I could save my calls. What happens when I'm above. The east river when you are in love. We're staring at all these lights. And I am going blind. Fill all of the navy yards. With hard working security guards. Cuz the numbers are wearing off. My plastic access cards. How can I begin to say. I feel better off when we stay. In Paris on winter nights. Beneath the snowy veil. Content like a panda bear. Still breathing the fresh mountain air. I'll put on a diving tank. And sing when I inhale
paper tigers,"Well I've been huddled up alone. By the fire even though. I'm not exactly feeling cold. And I've been bundled up for days. Too confused to be amazed. At all the icy water in my veins. Why do I feel so alone?. Yeah I've been moving in and out. Of this old split-level house. And I'd just as soon burn the whole place down. ‘Cause I quit working lumberyards. To build a mansion out of cards. But I feel thin behind these paper walls. Why do I feel so alone?. ‘Cause the angriest bark is always worse than the bite. Like the ache in my chest that my heart didn't invite. But if the prettiest romance isn't perfectly right. That makes every love lost just a holiday every night. Well I've been painting through the night. In the basement out of sight. Brushing paper tigers black and white. ‘Cause come tomorrow afternoon. I'll fill a helium balloon. And set them free into the baby blue sky. So they won't have to be alone. ‘Cause the angriest bark is always worse than the bite. Like the ache in my chest that my heart didn't invite. But if the prettiest romance isn't perfectly right. That makes every love lost just a holiday every night. But when I close these heavy lids after dark. Each sweet dream is a target. And all my shots are so consistently wide of the mark. ‘Cause the angriest bark is always worse than the bite. Like the ache in my chest that my heart didn't invite. But if the prettiest romance isn't perfectly right. That makes every love lost just a holiday every night. Just a holiday every night. Just a holiday every night. Just a holiday every night. Well I've been huddled up alone. By the fire even though. I'm not exactly feeling cold. But how my heartache hit the trail. When a paper tiger tail. Fluttered down, I guess I'll never know"
peppermint winter,There’s the snow. Look out below. And bundle up. Cause here it comes. Run outside. So starry eyed. A snowball fight breaks out. And winter has finally begun. I twirl through the driveway with angelic grace. Till I slip on the sidewalk and fall on my face. This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet. I don’t need to taste to believe. What’s December without Christmas Eve. Hop in the sleigh. And we’ll glide away. Into the night. And we’ll sip on moonlight. Runny nose. My frosty toes. Are getting cold but I feel alive. So I smile wide. The snowflakes start falling and I start to float. Till my mean older brother stuffs snow down my coat. This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet. I don’t need to taste to believe. What’s December without Christmas Eve. All this holiday cheer. Heaven knows where it goes. But it returns every year. And though this winter does nothing but storm. The joy in my heart is ablaze and it’s keeping me warm. It’s keeping me warm. It’s keeping me warm. I rip off the wrapping and tear through the box. Till I end up with 45 new pairs of socks. This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet. I don’t need to taste to believe. What’s December without Christmas Eve

rainbow veins,"High rise, veins of the avenue. Bright eyes and subtle variations of blue. Everywhere is balanced there like a rainbow above you. Street lights glisten on the boulevard. And cold nights make staying alert so hard. For heaven's sake, keep me awake so I won't be caught off guard. Clearly I am a passerby but I'll find a place to stay. Dear pacific day, won't you take me away?. Small town, hearts of the New Year. Brought down by gravity, crystal clear. City fog and brave dialogue converge on the frontier. Make haste, I feel your heartbeat. With new taste for speed, out on the street. Find a road to a humble abode where both of our routes meet. The silver sound is all around and the colors fall like snow. The feeling of letting go, I guess we'll never know. Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains. And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins. Cause your heart has a lack of color and we should've known. That we'd grow up sooner or later cause we wasted all our free time alone. Your nerves gather with the altitude. Exhale the stress so you don't come unglued. Somewhere there is a happy affair, a ghost of a good mood. Wide eyed, panic on the getaway. The high tide could take me so far away. Vcr's and motorcars unite on the Seventh Day. A popular gauge will measure the rage of the new Post-Modern Age. Cause somewhere along the line all the decades align. We were the crashing whitecaps. On the ocean. And what lovely seaside holiday, away. A palm tree in Christmas lights. My emotion. Struck a sparkling tone like a xylophone. As we spent the day alone. Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains. And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins. Cause your heart has a lack of color and we should've known. That we'd grow up sooner or later cause we wasted all our free time along"
rugs from me to you,"Toupee or not toupee. That is the question. It refused to stay as it all turned grey. William Shakespeare's receding hair. Please excuse the pun,. 'It's hair today, gone tomorrow'. So be thankful. For what precious locks you have. Toupee or not toupee. That is the question. And by the way. I just gotta say. Thank the Lord I'm not going bald. And if I may quip. My curls and I. Are just like heaven. 'Cause rest assured. There'll be no parting there. But should my head get bare like Friar Tuck. Our chase to swallow. It makes me smile. 'Cause I know just what I'd do. Yeah if I had more wigs than I knew what to do with. I'd open a secondhand store. And if you ever went bald. You'd recall it. 'Cause I'd cleverly call it. 'Rugs From Me To You'"

Deep in a sleeping bag in your backyard.. When we woke up buried alive beneath the fruity. landslide. we both laughed hysterically.. It could've been just another dream, but I swear I. heard you scream.. A strawberry avalanche crashed over me.. Always a citrus constellation in the galaxy, scratched on the back. Of both my eye lids that I've been dying to see.. If you were a beautiful sound and the echo's. all around. Then I'd be your harmony and we'd sing along. with the crowds.. Beneath the candy coated clouds of strawberry. avalanche, she's crashed over me.. See the world of dreams and reverie where I felt the stars explode around me."
sunburn,"So there we were, back home from somewhere inside my head. Oh, bravely I fought off the monsters beneath her bed. Pillars of postwar books supported by frame of mind. While she memorized the pages that I tried to not hide behind. She took my hand in hers and whispered her love for me. The lantern died that night but we didn't need to see. Implying that she's the bee's knees and I am the cat's meow. It's funny how she recalls what I can't remember now. But when her smile came back and I didn't feel half as horrible. She gave me a heart attack just because she looked so adorable. We both put our sunblock on. Played on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn. Yeah, but she got a tan, and I got a sunburn. I got a sunburn. So there we were out there, unaware of where we'd been. We kicked off our flipflops and swung from the rooftops again. It's awkward but I'll confess she's all I can think about. And it's funny how I recall what she can't remember now. But when her smile came back and I didn't feel half as horrible. She gave me a heart attack just because she looked so adorable. We both put our sunblock on. Played on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn. Yeah, but she got a tan, and I got a sunburn. Oh, afterglow, look out below. We left a trail of dust behind. As we parted ways, she held my gaze. And left an imprint on my mind. I tried not to cry as we said goodbye. And hung the clouds above my town. But I shed a tear when she disappeared. Cause now I'm a stranger on the ground. (When her smile came back and I didn't feel half as horrible). (She gave me a heart attack). We both put our sunblock on. Played on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn. But she got a tan, and I got a sunburn. She got a tan, and I got a sunburn. Yeah, but she got a tan, and I got a sunburn.

super honeymoon,"Glamour and fashion. Models and magazines... a striking runway entrance. Beauty and passion. Stardust and high class scenes of popular teens. When I lived in Denver, I met a millionaire. With ribbons in her blonde hair. I still remember. She was like a princess straight from a dreamy castle in the air. So lovely.... She was everything to me. Both alone in the dark. We long to see the sun. Rise over the Bering Strait. I was sick of the west. When I turned 21. So I moved to the Sunshine State. We played golf on the moon. And tennis on the sun. Like athletes of the afternoon. The solar flares burned my arms. And made her makeup run. On our super lunar honeymoon. I was the youngest son of a congressman. And everything was my fault.... She was a gymnast, happily swinging. On the uneven bars, tucked in a somersault"
swimming in miami,"I'm alone above the atmosphere. And no one looking up can find me here. Cause I can close my eyes, and disappear. When I climb the stairs to watch the sun.

Conceals the night with disregard. For all the workers in a west coast ship yard. When I rearrange the silverware. And re-install the lights and captian's chair. I'll lift the ceiling off to breathe the ocean air. I am the engineer of forty freight trains that travels throuh your veins. When you are lying half asleep in your room. Unaware if it is midnight or afternoon. Because the water doesn't flood the stairwell. It could be raining but then you can never tell.. If you're awake in this awful downpour. Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door. When you are swimming in Miami at night. And all around you are the traffic and city lights"

You were the one, and it wasn't enough. To be the one you were dreaming of. You were the one and we called it love. And now you take it all away, take it all away!. I felt pain in my chest with your kiss on my cheek. And as I try to digest the words I couldn't believe. I'm left with nothing to say with my heart on my sleeve. Making it easy to hurt, and even harder to breathe. So if you gonna go,. And leave me in a lonely grave. I won't let it show,. Until you finally float away. You gotta know that you tear me up when you say. You wanna take it all away, take it all away. You tear me up when you say. You wanna take it all away, take it all away!. You were the one, and it wasn't enough. To be the one you were dreaming of. You were the one and we called it love. And now you take it all away, take it all away!. You take it all away, you take it all away. You take it all away. You gotta know that you tear me up when you say. You wanna take it all away, take it all away. You tear me up when you say. You wanna take it all away, take it all away!. You were the one, and it wasn't enough. To be the one you were dreaming of. You were the one and we called it love. And now you take it all away, take it all away!"
technicolor phase,"I am the red in the rose, the flowers. on the blankets on your bedroom floor.. And I am the gray in the ghost that hides. with your clothes behind your closet door.. I am the green in the grass that bends back. from underneath your feet.. And I am the blue in your back alley view. where the horizon and the rooftops meet.. If you cut me I suppose I would bleed the colors of the evening stars.. You can go anywhere you wish cause I'll be there,. wherever you are.. (wherever you are) 2x.

the 5th of july,"My mom woke my dad up. And said ""It's time to leave! "". So they jumped into the old Caprice. And tore off into the night. On the 4th of July. They flew through the darkness. Driving like Jehu. And they rolled into Ottumwa. Before the sun began to rise. On the 4th of July. In walks Bob and Janice. Rachel's on her way. To peek in through the window. Hoping to hear her grandson cry. On the 4th of July. My mother watched the fireworks. From her hospital bed. And after it was all over. She held me for the first time. On the 5th of July. I've got my mother's brown eyes. And my dad's quiet way. And Grandma Rachel's love for music. The morning I arrived. On the 5th of July. Deep in Iowa country. In a Heavenly Hideaway. On the shores of Lake Rathbun. My folks brought me home. On the 5th of July. And that was when. Life began for me. And that was when. Life began for me. A teacher and a mechanic. Brought me into this world. They loved me with all their hearts. Since the day I opened my eyes. On the 5th of July. And that was when. Life began for me. And that was when. Life began for me"
the airway,"When I am fast asleep. I dream and see you floating high above me. And I awake at dawn. Before the rays of morning paint the front lawn. From on the bedroom floor. I watch you sailing far above the seashore. In deep Atlantic skies. You float as I look aft to watch the moon rise. Above the avenue. I search among the clouds, trying to see you. But you are just a blur. In the sky when you parachute over the harbor. I can see. You above with the ocean around me. If I could only stay. Overhead in the airway. You sail through. Endless sky with the evening around you. When I'm out on the bay. You're aloft in the airway. When I'm alone at night. I dream you paint the stars against the twilight. Suspended in the air. I wish your silhouette would always stay there. When I am on the beach. I watch you held aloft way out of my reach. But I cannot take flight. Or float upon the air the way that you might. When I am in the sea. You gaze down from the sky, trying to see me. But I am just a blur. Through the waves as I scuba dive below the harbor. The airway. You and I in the airway. Aloft in the airway. In love on the airway. I can see. You above with the ocean around me. If I could only stay. Overhead in the airway. You sail through. Endless sky with the evening around you. When I'm out on the bay. You're aloft in the airway"
the bird and the worm,"If you're the bird whenever we pretend it's summer. Then I'm the worm, I know the part, it's such a bummer. But fair is fair, if my segments get separated. I'll scream and you'll be there. Close your eyes, close my eyes. Slide the cotton off of your shoulder. And feel the shine, feel the shine. I'm hooked so toss me over and cast a line,. oh I'll try. Oh, throw a party and greet my undersea friends. It depends, as they arrive, if they arrive. You and I left our troubles far behind,. troubles far behind. But I still have just one more question on my mind. For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas. With friends like these well, who needs enemies. If I'm your boy, let's take a short cut we remember. And we'll enjoy, picking apples in late September. Like we've done for years. Then we'll take a long walk through the corn field. And I'll kiss you between the ears. If you're my girl, swirl me around your room with feeling. And as we twirl, the glow in the dark stars on your ceiling. Will shine for us, as love sweeps over the room. 'Cause we tend to make each other blush, you make me blush. You and I left our troubles far behind, troubles far behind. But I still have just one more question on my mind. For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas. With fronds like these well, who needs anemones?. You're the bird and I'm the worm and it's plain to see. That we were meant to be. We were meant to be. We were meant to be. If you're the bird. If you're the bird. Then I'm the worm. We were meant to be"
the christmas song,It's christmas and we walk alone. Two strangers with no one to miss us. On our own. Out in the cold. Trudging onward. Braving a harsh winter storm. You and I met passing by. And now our spirits feel warm. I don't have anyone at home to talk to. And you don't have anything to do. So I'll spend my christmas with you. I'll spend my christmas with you. It's christmas and we are in love. With the way that the soft snowflakes kiss us. From far above. The blustery breeze. Trudging onward. Braving a harsh winter storm. You and I met passing by. And now our spirits feel warm. I believe that Jesus is truly the only way. And I celebrate christmas because it's his birthday. I don't have anyone at home to talk to. And you don't have anything to do. So I'll spend my christmas with you. I'll spend my christmas with you. I'll spend my christmas with you. I'll spend my christmas with you
the joy in your heart,Skies of grey. This holiday. But spirits shine so bright. They don't need the sun. 'Cause love is the fire in your fireplace. And carefree are the snowflakes that fall on your face. And although this winter may bring us a storm. The joy in your heart keeps you warm. Yeah the joy in your heart keeps you warm!
the real world,"I saw the autumn leaves peel up off the street. Take wing on the balmy breeze and sweep you off your feet. You blushed as they scooped you up on sugar maple wings. To gaze down on the city below, ablaze with wondrous things. Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere. Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn't want to live there. I wouldn't want to live there. Weighed down by heavy lids and lunar lullabies. I knew you were wide awake because you smile with your eyes. Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere. Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn't want to live there. From the green belt balcony. The wildfires look so pretty. Ponderosa canopy, I'd never leave if it were up to me. To the ruby redwood tree, and to the velvet climbing ivy: painted all mahogany. I'd never leave if it were up to me. I'd never leave if it were up to me. With a starry brush. Paint the dusk venetian blue. Because in the evening hush. You'll never believe the view. And when the leaves return. And their whisperings fill the night. They'll freeze and burn. Where fire and ice collide. Where fire and ice collide. Can you feel a silk embrace. In the satin air?. If we dissolve without a trace. Will the real world even care?. Downy feathers kiss your face. And flutter everywhere.. Reality is a lovely place. But I wouldn't want to live there. I wouldn't want to live there. I saw the autumn leaves peel up off the street. Take wing on the balmy breeze and sweep you off your feet"
the saltwater room,"I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light. Walking down by the bay on the shore. Staring up at the plans that aren't there anymore. I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold. So like an introvert, I drew my over shirt. Around my arms and began to shiver violently. Before you happened to look and see the tunnels all around me. Running into the dark underground. All the subways around create a great sound. To my motion fatigue, farewell with your ear to a seashell. You can hear the waves in underwater caves. As if you actually were inside a saltwater room. Time together is just never quite enough. When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home. What will it take to make or break this hint of love?. We need time, only time. When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?. If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?. So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?. All the time, all the time. Can you believe that the crew has gone and wouldn't let me sign on?. All my islands have sunk in the deep, so I can hardly relax or even oversleep. I feel as if I were home some nights when we count all the ship lights. I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow. We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow. So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love, all the time?. Time together is just never quite enough. When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home. What will it take to make or break this hint of love?. We need time, only time. When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?. If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?. So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?. All the time, all the time. Time together is just never quite enough. When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?.

the tip of the iceberg,Welcome back. Winter once again. And put on your warm fuzzy sweater. Cuz you'll feel much better when. The snowflakes fall. Gently to the ground. The temperature drops. And your shivers freeze all the rivers around. But I keep you warm. If speed's a pro. Inertia must be a con. Cuz the cold wind blows at precise rates. When I've got my ice skates on. If all the roads were paved. With ice that wouldn't thaw or crack. I could skate from Maine to Nebraska. Then on to Alaska and back. Cuz you keep me warm. Peer over the edge. Can you see me?. Rivulets flow from your eyes. Paint runs from your mouth. Like a waterfall. And your lungs crystalize. I'll travel the sub-zero tundra. I'll brave glaciers and frozen lakes. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I'll do whatever it takes. To change. Farewell powdery paradise. We'd rather skate on the finished ice. Fingers failed us before they froze. Frostbite bit down on all our toes. Snow drifts build up and enfold us. As we wait out this winter storm. So we snuggle close in the darkness. And keep each other so warm
the yacht club,"Adam:. My raw candy passion is bitter-sweet,. Onto the teeth,. 'Cause she would rather fall in chocolate,. Than fall in love, especially with me.. I stood under the waterfall,.

Lights: And dance in the moonlight!. Adam: When we join The Yacht Club.. I would rather go swimming with great white sharks,. Than wade in romance,.

this isn't the end,"An 8-year old girl had a panic attack. Cause the father she loved left and never looked back. No longer the hero she counted on. He told her he loved her and then he was gone. She tried to look happy in front of her friends. But knew that she'd never feel normal again. She fought back the tears as they filled her eyes. And wanted him back just to tell him goodbye. When the rain falls down. When it all turns around. When the light goes out. This isn't the end. Her dad was a good guy that everyone liked. But nobody knew he was dying inside. He promised his family he'd be alright. And then with a gunshot he left them behind. When the rain falls down. When it all turns around. When the light goes out. This isn't the end. When the rain falls down. When it all turns around. When the light goes out. This isn't the end, no. The role of a father he never deserved. He abandoned his daughter and never returned. And over the years, though, the pain was real. She finally forgave him and started to heal. How close is the ending, well nobody knows. The future's a mystery and anything goes. Love is confusing and life is hard. You fight to survive, 'cause you made it this far. It's all too astounding to comprehend. It's just the beginning, this isn't the end. It's just the beginning, this isn't the end"
thunderstruck,"I feel you glowing in the dark. When I collapse into your arms. I'm just a stranger in the stars. Cause somehow it seems when I am with you. That all of my dreams begin to come true. And carefully you carry me away. I've never felt so wide awake. Cause I'm wonder struck. I love how you take my breath away. I'm thunderstruck. To tell you the truth, I'm so afraid. That I'm out of luck. I love how you take my breath away. I'm thunderstruck. I chase the phantoms down the hall. I felt the floorboards rise and fall. I lost and never loved at all. I find in the days when you're in my dreams. The orchestra plays the prettiest themes. And carefully you carry me away. I've never felt so wide awake. Cause I'm wonder struck. I love how you take my breath away. I'm thunderstruck. To tell you the truth, I'm so afraid. That I'm out of luck. I love how you take my breath away. I'm thunderstruck.

tidal wave,"I wish I could cross my arms and cross your mind. Cause I believe you'd unfold your paper heart. And wear it on your sleeve. All my life I wish I broke mirrors instead of promises. Cause all I see is a shattered conscience staring right back at me. I wish I had covered all my tracks completely. Cause I'm so afraid. Is that the light at the far end of the tunnel or just the train. Lift your arms, only heaven knows where the danger grows. And it's safe to say. There's a bright light up ahead and help is on the way. I forget the last time I felt brave. I just recall insecurity. Cause it came down like a tidal wave. And sorrow swept over me. Depression please cut to the chase. And cut a long story short. Oh please be done. How much longer can this drama afford to run. Fate looks sharp, severs all my ties. And breaks whatever doesn't bend. But sadly then. All my heavy hopes just pull me back down again. I forget the last time I felt brave. I just recall insecurity. Cause it came down like a tidal wave. And sorrow swept over me. Then I was given grace and love. I was blind but now I can see. Cause I've found a new hope from above. And courage swept over me. It hurts just to wake up whenever you're wearing thin. Alone on the outside. So tired of looking in. The end is uncertain. And I've never been so afraid. But I don't need a telescope to see that there's hope. And that makes me feel brave"

The silence isn't so bad,. Till I look at my hands and feel sad,. Cause the spaces between my fingers. Are right where yours fit perfectly.. I'll find repose in new ways,. Though I haven't slept in two days,. Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone.. But drenched in Vanilla twilight,. I'll sit on the front porch all night,. Waist deep in thought because when I think of you.. I don't feel so alone.. I don't feel so alone.. I don't feel so alone.. As many times as I blink I'll think of you.... tonight.. I'll think of you tonight.. When violet eyes get brighter,. And heavy wings grow lighter,. I'll taste the sky and feel alive again.. And I'll forget the world that I knew,. But I swear I won't forget you,. Oh if my voice could reach back through the past,. I'd whisper in your ear,. Oh darling I wish you were here."
verge (feat. aloe blacc),I ain't too sure what I believe in. But I believe in what I see. And when I close my eyes. I see my whole life ahead of me. These are our hours. This is our time. This is our time. These are our hours. Out on the verge. Out on the verge of the rest of our lives. The rest of our lives. Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight. Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight. Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight. Out on the verge of the rest of our lives. These are our hours. This is our time. These are our hours. Out on the verge (out on the verge). Out on the verge of the rest of our lives. Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight. Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight. Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight. Out on the verge of the rest of our lives. Ooh yeah. For the rest of our lives. From now on. There's no looking back. Full steam ahead. On this one way track. From this day forward. I will make a promise. To be true to myself. And always be honest. For the rest of my life. I will do what's right. I will do what's right. When I step out on the. Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight. Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight. Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight. Out on the verge of the rest of our lives. The rest of our lives. The rest of our lives. Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight. Out on the verge of the rest of our lives
waving through a window (from dear evan hansen),"I've learned to slam on the brake. Before I even turn the key. Before I make the mistake. Before I lead with the worst of me. Give them no reason to stare. No slipping up if you slip away. So I got nothing to share. No, I got nothing to say. Step out, step out of the sun. If you keep getting burned. Step out, step out of the sun. Because you've learned, because you've learned. On the outside, always looking in. Will I ever be more than I've always been?. 'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass. I'm waving through a window. I try to speak, but nobody can hear. So I wait around for an answer to appear. While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass. I'm waving through a window, oh. Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?. We start with stars in our eyes. We start believing that we belong. But every sun doesn't rise. And no one tells you where you went wrong. Step out, step out of the sun. If you keep getting burned. Step out, step out of the sun. Because you've learned, because you've learned. On the outside, always looking in. Will I ever be more than I've always been?. 'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass. Waving through a window. I try to speak, but nobody can hear. So I wait around for an answer to appear. While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass. Waving through a window, oh. Can anybody see, is anybody waving?. When you're falling in a forest. and there's nobody around. Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?. When you're falling in a forest. and there's nobody around. Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?. When you're falling in a forest. and there's nobody around. Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?. When you're falling in a forest. and there's nobody around. Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?. Did I even make a sound?. Did I even make a sound?. It's like I never made a sound. Will I ever make a sound?. On the outside, always looking in. Will I ever be more than I've always been?. 'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass. Waving through a window. I try to speak, but nobody can hear. So I wait around for an answer to appear. While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass. Waving through a window, oh. Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?. Is anybody waving?. Waving, waving, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh"
west coast friendship,"Are you out there. Where the rainy days begin. To feel rather sad. And the walls are closing in. Like the darkness around me. It's so hard to look away. When the daylight doesn't ever stay. Above this dull apartment view. Oh, I will surround you. It's quite clear that I'm stuck here. So I'll devise a plan. And cut out a door in my new living room floor. The porch light is so bright. That I will quickly sneak down the dark metal shape. Of the rusty fire escape. I bought a one way ticket. Cause I knew I'd never see the ground. Unless I was aboard a jet plane. And we were going down. When I wiped the tears from my eyes. The warm water took me by surprise. And I woke up beside the ocean. I realized I must be in California. Aloha, my happy west coast friends. Do you feel alive. When the breaking waves arrive. And wash all around you. The beach homes and ocean side. Are quite well known by the evening tide. And we can sleep where we reside. With redwoods around us. The blue air is up there. And could I bring it down. I bottle it up and save it for a sweet summer night. I bought a one way ticket. Cause I knew I'd never see the ground. Unless I was aboard a jet plane. And we were going down. When I wiped the tears from my eyes. The warm water took me by surprise. And I woke up beside the ocean. I realized I must be in California. I must be in California. Am I awake or is this just a dream?. The new year is out here. And I will make a lovely list. Of your charms. So I'll never feel alone in your arms. I must be in California. I must be in California. I must be in California"

winners never quit,I've had some bummer days. But I ain't lookin' back. I've made a few mistakes. But I'm on the right track. I got somewhere to be. Gotta hurry so I'll make. My date with destiny. 'Cause I don't wanna be late. Here we go. I might take my time. 'Cause I find the fable had it right. Slow and steady wins the race. And I might lag behind. But I swear I'll cross the finish line. Movin' at a steady pace. I'll give it all I've got. I don't have a lot. But I know a little goes a long way. The truth is hard to face. But I can take a hit. I've lost in many ways. But a winner don't quit. My head is in the game. And the move is mine to make. But I am not afraid. 'Cause I'll fight the good fight. I got somewhere to be. Gotta hurry so I'll make. My date with destiny. 'Cause I don't wanna be late. Here we go. I might take my time. 'Cause I find the fable had it right. Slow and steady wins the race. And I might lag behind.

wolf bite,"It's another bad dream. Poison in my blood stream. I'm dying but i can't scream. Will you show me the way?. It's another wolf bite. Howlin' in the moonlight. I wanna get my life right!. Will you show me the way?. Tonight. If the darkness falls, and my angel calls. In my despair. Will you be there?. In the darkest night. When I need your light. Will you show me the way?. If my time runs out. And the sky falls down. Despite my fear. Will you appear?. If the world goes blind. And i lose my mind. Will you show me the way?. Tonight. Will you show me the way, tonight. Will you show me the way, tonight. It's another nightmare. I swear there's something out there. So save me cause i'm so scared. Will you show me the way?. It's another werewolf. All dressed up in sheep's wool. And changing when the moon's full. Will you show me the way?. If the darkness falls, and my angel calls. In my despair. Will you be there?. In the darkest night. When I need your light. Will you show me the way?. If my time runs out. And the sky falls down. Despite my fear. Will you appear?. If the world goes blind. And i lose my mind.

wonderfilled anthem (oreo tv commercial),Wonder if I gave an oreo to the big bad wolf. How would the story go?. Would he still go huff and puff. Or would he bring those pigs cool stuff. To decorate the deck he helped them build?. Would they not get killed?. Wonder if I gave an oreo to a vampire in a creepy show. Would he not act so undead?. Would he thirst for milk instead?. I've just got this feeling that it might work out all right. 'cause cream does wondrous things. Inside a chocolate sandwich dream. If I gave 'em to great white sharks. Would they share 'em with baby seals?. Would they call up a giant squid. for a friendly meal?. Wonder if I gave an oreo. Wonder if I gave an oreo. What if I gave an oreo to you?
you're not alone (feat. britt nicole),"Some days I barely hold on. When life drags me down. I wanna let go. But when my spirit is weak. You come to my aid. And strengthen my soul. I'm lost without you. I'll never doubt you. Your grace is beyond compare. And though when it rains, it pours. You know all I have is yours. You smile when you hear my prayer. You rescued me, and I believe. That God is love, and he is all I need. From this day forth, for all eternity. I'll never wander on my own. For I am yours until you call me home. I close my eyes, and I can hear you say. You're not alone oh oh-oh. You're not alone oh oh-oh. Some days I just can't go on. I stumble and fall. And I hang my head. But you reach out for my hand. And you lift me up. Again and Again. Oh, yes you do. I'm lost without you. I'll never doubt you. Your grace is beyond compare. And though when it rains, it pours. You know all I have is yours. You smile when You hear my prayer. You rescued me, and I believe. That God is love, and he is all I need. From this day forth, for all eternity. I'll never wander on my own. For I am yours until you call me home. I close my eyes, and I can hear you say. You're not alone oh oh-oh. You're not alone oh oh-oh. In the face of my depravity. For God so loved the world, he died for me, yeah. My fire burns, till he returns. And takes me home beyond the galaxy. You rescued me, and I believe. That God is love, and he is all I need. From this day forth, for all eternity. I'll never wander on my own. For I am yours until you call me home. I close my eyes, and I can hear you say. You're not alone oh oh-oh. You're not alone oh oh-oh. You're not, you're not alone. Never alone"
