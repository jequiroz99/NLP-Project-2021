spending my time,"What's the time? Seems it's already morning. I see the sky, it's so beautiful and blue. The Tv's on. But the only thing showing is a picture of you. Oh, I get up and make myself some coffee. I try to read a bit but the story's too thin. I thank the Lord above. That you're not here to see me. In this shape I'm in. Spending my time. Watching the days go by. Feeling so small, I stare at the wall. Hoping that you think of me too. I'm spending my time. I try to call but I don't know what to tell you. I leave a kiss on your answering machine. Oh, help me please. Is there someone who can make me. Wake up from this dream?. Spending my time. Watching the days go by. Feeling so small, I stare at the wall. Hoping that you are missing me too. I'm spending my time. Watching the sun go down. I fall asleep to the sound of ""tears of a clown"". A prayer gone blind. I'm spending my time. My friends keep telling me: ""Hey, life will go on"". Time will make sure I get over you, oh. This silly game of love. You play, you win only to lose, oh. I'm spending my time. Watching the days go by. Feeling so small, I stare at the wall. Hoping that you think of me too. I'm spending my time. Watching the sun go down. I fall asleep to the sound, ""tears of a clown"". A prayer gone blind. I'm spending my time..."
it must have been love,"It must have been love but it's over now.... Lay a whisper on my pillow. Leave the winter on the ground. I wake up lonely, there's air of silence. In the bedroom and all around. Touch me now, I close my eyes. And dream away. It must have been love but it's over now. It must have been good but I lost it somehow. It must have been love but it's over now. From the moment we touched 'till the time had run out. Make-believing we're together. That I'm sheltered by your heart. But in and outside I've turned to water. Like a teardrop in your palm. And it's a hard winter's day. I dream away. It must have been love but it's over now. It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without. It must have been love but it's over now. It's where the water flows. It's where the wind blows. It must have been love but it's over now. It must have been good but I lost it somehow. It must have been love but it's over now. From the moment we touched ‘til the time had run out. It must have been love but it's over now. It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without. It must have been love but it's over now. It's where the water flows. It's where the wind blows"
listen to your heart,"I know there's something in the wake of your smile. I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah. You've built a love but that love falls apart. Your little piece of heaven turns too dark. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why. But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile. The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah. They're swept away and nothing is what it seems. The feeling of belonging to your dreams. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why. But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. And there are voices that want to be heard. So much to mention but you can't find the words. The scent of magic, the beauty that's been. When love was wilder than the wind. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why. But listen to your heart before.... Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why. But listen to your heart before.... You tell him goodbye. (Listen to your heart). (Listen to your heart). (Listen to your heart). (Listen to your heart)"

fading like a flower (every time you leave),"In a time. When the sun descends alone. I ran a long, long way from home. To find a heart that's made of stone. I will try. I just need a little time. To get your face right out of my mind. To see the world through different eyes. Every time I see you, oh I try to hide away. But when we meet it seems I can't let go. Every time you leave the room I feel. I'm fading like a flower. Tell me why. When I scream there's no reply. When I reach out there's nothing to find. When I sleep, I break down and cry. Every time I see you, oh I try to hide away. But when we meet it seems I can't let go. Every time you leave the room I feel. I'm fading like a flower. Fading like a rose, fading like a rose. Beaten by the storm, talking to myself. Getting washed by the rain, it's such a cold, cold town. Oh, it's such a cold town. Every time I see you, oh I try to hide away. But when we meet it seems I can't let go. Every time you leave the room I feel. I'm fading like a flower"

the look,1-2-3-4 walking like a man. Hitting like a hammer. She's a juvenile scam.. Never was a quitter. Tasty like a raindrop. She's got the look.. Heavenly bound cause heaven's got a number. When she's spinning me around. Kissing is a colour.. Her loving is a wild dog. She's got the look.. Chorus:. She's got the look.. She's got the look.. What in the world can make. a brown-eyed girl turn blue.. When everything i'll ever do i'll do for you and I go:. Na na na na na she's got the look.. Fire in the ice naked to the t-bone is a lover's disguise.. Banging on the head drum. Shaking like a mad bull. She's got the look.. Swaying to the band. Moving like a hammer she's a miracle man..

vulnerable,"Everywhere I look I see her smile. Her absent-minded eyes. And she has kept me wondering for so long. How this thing could go wrong. It seems to me that we are both the same. Playing the same game. But as darkness falls this true love falls apart. Into a riddle of her heart. She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands. She's so vulnerable, and I don't understand. I could never hurt the one I love. She's all I've got. But she's so vulnerable. Oh so vulnerable. Days like these no one should be alone. No heart should hide away. Her touch is gently conquering my mind. There's nothing words can say. She's colored with all the secrets of my soul. I've whispered all my dreams. But just as nighttime falls this vision falls apart. Into a riddle of her heart, yea. She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands. She's so vulnerable and I don't understand. I could never hurt someone I love. She's all I've got. But she's so vulnerable. Oh so vulnerable.. Don't hide your eyes...."
crash! boom! bang!,"My Papa told me to stay out of trouble. ""When you've found your man, make sure he's for real!"". I've learned that nothing really lasts forever.

All I imagine. Is heaven on earth. I know it's you. Anyone who ever kissed in the rain. Knows the whole meaning. Anyone who ever stood in the light. Needs no explaining. But everything more or less. Appears so meaningless,. Blue and cold. Walking alone. Through the afternoon traffic,. I miss you so. Anyone who felt like I do. Anyone who wasn't ready to fall. Anyone who loved like I do. Knows it never really happens at all. It's over when it's over. What can I do about it. Now that it's over. Everything more or less. Is looking so meaningless. And fades to grey. Lying awake in an ocean of teardrops,. I float away. Anyone who ever felt like I do. Anyone who wasn't ready to fall. Anyone who loved like I do. Knows it never really happens at all. It's over when it's over. What can I do about it. Now it's all over"

after all,"Now it’s about time I wrote you a letter. Hey baby, it’s me for worse or for better. Got nothing to waste in pace for another lane. No loss, only gain. I know all we had has dried like the desert. Stains from the sand are still on my T-shirt. And I crave a drink of heavenly cool cool rain. And after all you were the greatest. After all I did my best. There is nothing to regret, big or small. After all, there wasn’t a loophole. We were bound to take the fall. Life goes on and on and on after all. Now it’s about time I settled the story. You slept in too late and missed all the glory. Got stuck in a dream. That finally blurred your brain. I tried to stay sane. Hey love is so blind it pops out the window. But no one will find teardrops on my pillow. As I raise a glass of heavenly cool champagne. Cos after all you were the greatest. After all I did my best. There is nothing to regret,. Large or small, oh no. After all, peep thru any keyhole. And you’ll see we were bound to fall. But life goes on and on and on after all. Yea, life goes on and on and on after all"

I need the sun a soft caress. I wish you the best. It's been a good time. The best there ever was for me. I miss your body. I miss your company. There was a man who looked like you.

May your wishes come true. April clouds shaped like shells. April rain should fall somewhere else. I suggest it takes a rest. Oh I wish you the best. I wish you the best

But when we meet it seems I can't let go. Every time you leave the room I feel. I'm fading like a flower"

Thinking as one.. A hint in the night, a touch of a dream has come to an end,. We run from one heart to another again.. The rose of our love is withered and torn. And gone from one heart to another.. Sailing away to sea, the ships made of you and me,. They pass in the darkest nights and turn out the lights.. And I thought I'd never know the season to see you go,. Two people twirled into one, being as one.. A hint in the night, a touch of a dream has come to an end,. We run from one heart to another.. The rose of our love is withered and torn. And gone from one heart to another.. Running running from one heart to another."

go to sleep,There's a shadow on the terrace. A snowdance for the living. There's heavy weather on the way. I heard it on the news. And life's a tough principal who won't reward the losers. Your name is on the tea-cup. There's nothing I can do. But to wish you'd think about me before you go to sleep. And I wish you the best there is before you go to sleep. There are tears without the colour. A million seas of water. An ocean full of people where shattered hearts can go. And love's a golden ripple where answers are so simple. But the explanations are very hard to do. And I wish you'd think about me before you go to sleep. And I wish you the best there is before you go to sleep. Go to sleep

Goodbye to this ball of bliss,. I'm dancing from your arms.. And I fill the bedroom. With silent visions of rain.. And I paint the morning. With echoes from pleasure in pain..

And I hang the heartache. Like pictures on the wall.. Can you hear the sound of angels. They're playing hurting games?. Well, I'm a stranger when I'm leaving,. I was a stranger when I came.. Goodbye to you...."

I always wanted you to stay / Wash my pain away, cause I'm half a woman, half a shadow / Love always change with the trees, the spring and the leaves, the waves on the sea. Wilder than light the wind in your eyes led me astray. I never wanted it this way. I always wanted you to stay. Oh I need you, yes I need you. Give me a reason to believe.."

i do believe,"Something woke me up. In the middle of the night. I never ever felt so lonely. I thought about givin’ you a call. But it was half past five. Got out of bed, walked thru the room. To the window. I saw twentyseven blocks still sleepin’. I thought about givin’ you a call. To get it off my mind. I do believe. When I close my eyes no one can see me. I do believe. When I close my eyes no one can see me. Some days. Are definitely better than others. Some got a flair so tragic. I wish you were here to be near. To help me thru the night. But then again. I got to carry on among the living. And leave these whirlwind battles behind me. Watchin’ you sleep. Only keeps on blurrin’ my sight. I do believe. When I close my eyes no one can see me. I do believe. When I close my eyes no one can see me. Who in this world would believe. Change will come eventually. To me. I long to get out in the sun. Out in the sun. Out in the rain. And wash these stains away"

I don't wanna go blind and find it's falling apart. All the time.. In the middle of a dream. You are there for me, your face, your lips.. But there's no way you can tell,. 'cause I hide it really well, so well.. In my life there has been loving and lying. And I don't need another reason to cry.. I dont' wanna get hurt, I've got my time,. All I want from you is to tell the truth.. I don't wanna get hurt, no more this time.. I don't wanna go blind and find I'm falling apart. One more time.. I dont' wanna get hurt, I've got my time,.

Don't need no book of wisdom,. I get no money talk at all. She has a train going downtown,. She's got a club on the moon. And she's telling all her secrets. In a wonderful balloon.. She's the heart of the funfair,. She's got me whistling her private tune. And it all begins where it ends,. And she's all mine,. My magic friend. She says: hello, you fool, I love you,. C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride. She's a flower, I can paint her,. She's a child of the sun,. We're a part of this together,. Could never turn around and run. Don't need no fortune teller. To know where my lucky love belongs oh no. Cos it all begins again when it ends, yea,. And we're all. Magic friends.. She says: hello, you fool, I love you,. C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride. She says: hello, you fool, I love you,. C'mon join the joyride, be a joyrider. I take you on a skyride,. I felling like you're spellbound. The sunshine is a lady. Who rox you like a baby.

We can pretend that you're a star. Cos life's so very simple just like la-la-la. It's a bright June afternoon, it never gets dark.. Wah-wah!. Here come the sun. Get your green green tambourine, let?s play in the park.. Wah-wah!. Here comes the sun. There's a painter painting his masterpiece. There are some squirrels jumping in the trees.. There's a wide-eyed boy with a red balloon.. All my life I've longed for this afternoon.. It's a bright June afternoon. It never gets dark.. Wah-wah!. Here come the sun. Get your green green tambourine. Let's play in the park. Wah-wah!. Here comes the sun. It's a bright June afternoon. Let's play in the park. Wah-wah!. Here come the sun.

I hit the streets, hey watch me in the monitor.. I saw a clone who looked just like a senator.. I checked the clock, i felt that it was time to go go go.. Then came you.... Why did you keep me waiting so long?. Why did you keep me waiting so long?. Why did you keep me waiting so long?. I was a spy, I was captured by the enemies.. I made a million selling secred fantasies.. I saw my love wasted in a pale grey zone.. I was the quake, shaking every monument.. I had to fi-find out what all the money ment.. I checked the sun, I knew that it was time to go go go.. Then came you.... Why did you keep me waiting so long?. Why did you keep me waiting so long?. Why did you keep me waiting so long?."

listen to your heart,"I know there's something in the wake of your smile. I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah. You've built a love but that love falls apart. Your little piece of heaven turns too dark. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why. But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile. The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah. They're swept away and nothing is what it seems. The feeling of belonging to your dreams. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why. But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. And there are voices that want to be heard. So much to mention but you can't find the words. The scent of magic, the beauty that's been. When love was wilder than the wind. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why. But listen to your heart before.... Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why. But listen to your heart before....

I can see your smile when I close my eyes. chorus:. Oh, little girl. Where did you go, little girl. I miss you so. I remember when she was mine. Once upon a time there was a little voice. Singing loud and clear. In my heart the only one. Once upon a times there was so many dreams. Once they were mine. Oh little girl, they are with you now. chorus:. Oh little girl.

little miss sorrow,"She had those magic eyes you could see from miles. around. She wore her summer dresses bright. Quite like the sky. She always came in colours. All smiles in daffodils. She let her hair down in the breeze. But every little thing has changed today - little Miss Sorrow. Every little thing turned pale and faded - little Miss Sorrow. The sunlight doesn't show. Although the colours go. Out through the window. She used to go out dancing. Cool silver fingernails. I used to watch her from the bar. Following her car. She always came in colours. She always kept control. She painted yesterday in gold. But every little thing turned grey today - little Miss Sorrow. Every little thing turned pale and faded - little Miss Sorrow. The sunlight doesn't show. All the colours go. Even the rainbow. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm just a local boy. She was my little Miss Joy. I want to call her name. My life won't be the same. Dear God. Every little thing has changed today - little Miss Sorrow. Every little thing turned pale and faded - little Miss Sorrow. Yes, every little thing turned grey today - little Miss Sorrow. The weakling plays the strong. The bird forgot the song. What's going on?. What's going on?. Tell me what's going on?. What's going on?. What's going on?. Tell me what's going on?"

Let it go! / Her love spins like a merry-go-round, going up and down, she's far away bound. Her love - expression of vision and sound, it's setting me up, and then it's kicking me down / Don't fade to gray, I wonder if she's over coming back to stay.

Only when I dream. I touch you and I breathe you. I feel you deep inside me. Things were never easy for me. In the temple we built to stay sacred and free. I came lookin' for more self esteem. All I found was your voice. On the answering machine. Simple and clean. Some might say it's too far gone. I don't believe them. If I could only talk to you. I'd prove I'm right. Only when I dream.... I tried to catch a butterfly. I tried to make God's summer sky. Heal me. Rain exploding in my face. Seems to fade without a trace. Heal me"

pay the price,I try to keep your name. And still get rid of your face. I hate to be by myself. All locked away in this place. You turn me inside out. You turn me outside in. Around and upside down. A rollercoaster within. Pay the price of love. When he calls for you. You've got to. Pay the price of love. When he calls for you. I grab my big black book. And call the numbers I know. Something is melting this town. Like it was all made of snow. You turn me inside out. You turn me outside and in. Around and up and down. The elevator within. Pay the price of love (ooh la la la). When he calls for you. You've got to. Pay the price of love (ooh la la la). When he calls for you. Spending the evening alone. With the 10 0'clock news. Looking at you. Through the holes in the soles. Of my old brown shoes
pearls of passion,"There was a banquet of believers. When we walked into the room. December days of X-mas. Felt like days in June. And there were morning light. And sunrise chimes echoed all around. Now's the time for weary minds. The moon is northern bound. And you know I'm going back. Going back today. Back to where I came from. And you know I'm going back. Going back to stay. To the alleys where. Pearls of passion came my way. There's a promise in the twilight. It's so innocent and wild. Two hearts that break the silence. You can hear a distant cry. And there's emptiness and loneliness. It's more or less the same. Let's run between the raindrops. Babe, and catch the mignight train"
perfect day,"Breathe some faith into my chest. Lay me down, I need the rest.. Ever since the sky turned grey. I've waited for the perfect day. Hey now - it seems you've always touched me like the sun.. There's no escape for the broken-hearted. There's no return once you've lost your way. I say a prayer now our love's departed. That you'll come back to stay and bring the perfect day. Blinded by a crazy light. I fell into the darkest night. Those magic ties, the two of u. I couldn't see it turn to dust. Hey now - it seems you've always reached me like the sun. There's no escape for the broken-hearted. There's no return once you've lost your way. I say a prayer now your love's departed. That you'll come back to stay. Bring back the perfect day"
perfect excuse,I wouldn't come alone. I took my memories along. If there's something that I've learned. You can't deny the way. The past dictates each dawn. It's not that I'm afraid. God knows I've made my set of rounds. It's just the way it feels tonight. That makes me lose the plot. What's really goin' down. Too hot to handle. Too hard to lose. Fallin' in love with you. Is a perfect excuse. You make me feel at ease. But I know the final show. If there's something that I've learned. It's better to have left. Before you have to go. It's not that o'm afraid. God knows I've made my set of rounds. You got that twinkle in your eye. That makes me lose my grip. What's really goin' down. Too hot to handle. Too hard to lose. Fallin' in love with you.

All I knew was the scent of sea and dew. But I've been in love before, how about you?. There's a time for the good in life. A time to kill the pain in life. Dream about the sun you queen of rain.

Now I'm putting out the fire, with a pocket full of rain. Yea yea / I don't know why you kept me hanging on all this time. I hear the drums on Radio Goodbye, I watch the shadow dancing in the night, tonight. I see the car, your hunter rides a silver Jaguar. And how I'd like a star before the sun.

It never comes. Speak to me with tenderness. Speak to me with gracefulness. Speak to me with happiness and love. Speak to me in loneliness (speak to me). Speak to me in bitterness. Speak to me (come on, speak to me) in faithlessness with love. Only with love. With love. Speak to me, speak to me. With love. Come on now. With love"
spending my time,"What's the time? Seems it's already morning. I see the sky, it's so beautiful and blue. The Tv's on. But the only thing showing is a picture of you. Oh, I get up and make myself some coffee. I try to read a bit but the story's too thin. I thank the Lord above. That you're not here to see me. In this shape I'm in. Spending my time. Watching the days go by. Feeling so small, I stare at the wall. Hoping that you think of me too. I'm spending my time. I try to call but I don't know what to tell you. I leave a kiss on your answering machine. Oh, help me please. Is there someone who can make me. Wake up from this dream?. Spending my time. Watching the days go by. Feeling so small, I stare at the wall. Hoping that you are missing me too. I'm spending my time. Watching the sun go down. I fall asleep to the sound of ""tears of a clown"". A prayer gone blind. I'm spending my time. My friends keep telling me: ""Hey, life will go on"". Time will make sure I get over you, oh. This silly game of love. You play, you win only to lose, oh. I'm spending my time. Watching the days go by. Feeling so small, I stare at the wall. Hoping that you think of me too. I'm spending my time. Watching the sun go down. I fall asleep to the sound, ""tears of a clown"". A prayer gone blind. I'm spending my time..."

you can't do this to me anymore,"(You can't do this to me anymore!). You stepped out of a silver van. Driven by rainbow man. You said your name was mary-ann. The coolest plan you had at hand.

Looking for that saving grace. I find you tricky to erase. Don't know what I see in space. It might well be a hide in place. Can't stay in, I won't get out. Every emotion seems to shout.

You turn me on - The thrill of it all / I read in the paper how everything's changed, but it's all the same - it's out of the game. I reach out and touch an endless temptation, live in a dream - the strangest sensation / Move me - You turn me on ... / The lines I have written are the lines on your face, they merge out of nowhere - and leave with no trace.

Watching the days go by. Feeling so small, I stare at the wall. Hoping that you think of me too. I'm spending my time. I try to call but I don't know what to tell you. I leave a kiss on your answering machine. Oh, help me please. Is there someone who can make me. Wake up from this dream?. Spending my time. Watching the days go by. Feeling so small, I stare at the wall. Hoping that you are missing me too. I'm spending my time. Watching the sun go down. I fall asleep to the sound of ""tears of a clown"". A prayer gone blind. I'm spending my time. My friends keep telling me: ""Hey, life will go on"". Time will make sure I get over you, oh. This silly game of love. You play, you win only to lose, oh. I'm spending my time.

it must have been love,"It must have been love but it's over now.... Lay a whisper on my pillow. Leave the winter on the ground. I wake up lonely, there's air of silence. In the bedroom and all around. Touch me now, I close my eyes. And dream away. It must have been love but it's over now. It must have been good but I lost it somehow. It must have been love but it's over now. From the moment we touched 'till the time had run out. Make-believing we're together. That I'm sheltered by your heart. But in and outside I've turned to water. Like a teardrop in your palm. And it's a hard winter's day. I dream away. It must have been love but it's over now. It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without. It must have been love but it's over now. It's where the water flows. It's where the wind blows. It must have been love but it's over now. It must have been good but I lost it somehow. It must have been love but it's over now. From the moment we touched ‘til the time had run out. It must have been love but it's over now.

I don't know where you're going and I don't know why. But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile. The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah. They're swept away and nothing is what it seems. The feeling of belonging to your dreams. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why. But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. And there are voices that want to be heard. So much to mention but you can't find the words. The scent of magic, the beauty that's been. When love was wilder than the wind. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why. But listen to your heart before.... Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why. But listen to your heart before....

fading like a flower (every time you leave),"In a time. When the sun descends alone. I ran a long, long way from home. To find a heart that's made of stone. I will try. I just need a little time.

Get your green green tambourine, let?s play in the park.. Wah-wah!. Here comes the sun. There's a painter painting his masterpiece. There are some squirrels jumping in the trees.. There's a wide-eyed boy with a red balloon.. All my life I've longed for this afternoon.. It's a bright June afternoon. It never gets dark.. Wah-wah!. Here come the sun. Get your green green tambourine. Let's play in the park. Wah-wah!. Here comes the sun. It's a bright June afternoon. Let's play in the park. Wah-wah!. Here come the sun. Get your green green tambourine. It never gets dark. Wah-wah!. Here comes the sun. It never gets dark. Let's play in the dark. Let's play in the dark. Here comes the sun"
(i could never) give you up,"I've been hiding, lost in the love of another.. I've followed the moon and a song. And I thought it would take me forever. To find a place where I belong.. I watch a rainbow rise. I give you all I've got.. I could never give you up the way you make my love shine. I could never give you up the way you make true love shine. I believe you when you say you don't want to be lonely. I'll carry your heart like a bridge. When you need all the time you can find. To get the hurt out of your mind. I'll watch the rain go by and give you all I've got. Cause I could never give you up...."
breathe,"Breathe your life.... I've got to come down. I've been awake for far too long. My eyes look torn, they were so strong. I wore the crown, I wrote the song. Now it's fading. My heart was open. Like a window to a summer breeze. I breaaaathed your love,. I filled my lungs and veins. And I breaaathed your love. Until I felt the pain. And like rain it slipped away. I tried to find out. What love was really all about. Behind the curtain waits the sky. It's rare I feel enough to cry. I'm drying up inside. My life was open. Like a window to the summer breeze. I breathed your love,. I filled my lungs and veins. And I breathed your love. Until I met the pain and like rain. It slipped away, just like a little rain.. I breathed your love. And nothing stayed the same.. Yes, I breathed your love. And filled my heart in vain cos like rain. It slipped away, just like rain it swept away."
wish i could fly,"Halfway through the night. I wake up in a dream.. Echoes in my head make every whisper turn into a scream.. I dreamed I could fly out in the blue.. Over this town followin' you.. Over the trees, subways and cars.. I'd try to find out who you really are.. In the middle of the night (middle of the night). cool sweatin' in my bed.. Got the windows open wide, thinkin'. about all the things you said.. I wish I could fly out in the blue.. Over this town followin' you.. I'd fly over rooftops, the great boulevards to try to find out. who you really are.. Who you really are.. I wish I could fly now.. I wish I could fly now.. I wish I could fly now.. I wish I could fly around and around.. Over this town, the dirt on the ground.. I'd follow your course of doors left ajar to try to find out. who you really are.. Who you really are.. Fly, fly, fly.. I wish I could fly.. I wake up in a dream in the middle of the night.. I wish I could fly.. I wish I could fly."
so far away,"In the coldest time of year,. Darkness all around my heart. I was alone but didn't fear. To wander in the light of stars. In the bright and silent night,. Winds would knock and disappear. Still I felt the feeling near,. Like the first time you were ever here. You're so far away, so far away,. You left me, you told me you would stay. You never said goodbye. And I'll keep asking why,. I keep on asking how,. Oh come unto me now. I have breathed the morning air,. I have heard the four winds blow. I was weary but prepared. To follow down this lonely road. In the room where lovers sleep,. Winds would knock and disappear. Still I felt the music near,. Like the first time we were ever here. You're so far away, so far away,. You left me, you told me you would stay. You never said goodbye. And I keep wondering why,. I keep on wondering how,. Oh come inside me now. I keep on wondering how,. Oh come inside me now. Nananana. Oh, you're so far away.... So far away."
(do you get) excited?,"When the day gets dark. Over thousand streets. And you feel your heart. Is a living beat.. When you're all alone. And you close your eyes,. Naked to the bone. The dream comes alive.. Do you get excited. When I touch you in the night?. My oh my.... Do you get excited. When I meet you every night?. You won't let the night pass you by.. When your body's hot,. The window's open wide.. This moment's all you've got. In this race of life.. When you feel the fire. Is getting close to you,. Hey baby, you know. I'm lonely too.. Do you get excited. When I touch you in the night?. My oh my.... Do you get excited. When I meet you every night?. You won't let the night pass you by.. I wanna know.. I gotta know."

20 bpm,You want the streets at midnight. You want to shine in dim light. Those walks are made for poets. Don't look like you don't know it. You want a soul survivor. You want a beauty parlour. A space to last forever. No blues can lose the colour. (it all makes sense in the end). Oh baby don't you know. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. When things are getting slow. Oh oh oh oh oh oh.

7twenty7,"7twenty7 is ready to move. You know she packed her bags. With nothing left to prove. I thought I didn't care now I'm fallin' through. Wouldn't you?. Well, it's a long long journey. To the other side. Oh i've been wishin' all night. I was on that flight. And god, you'd better take care. Of the sweetest eyes. I hear myself swallowin' the tears I cry. I hear myself swallowin' the tears I cry. 7twenty7 is up in the air. You know I feel her hands on me everywhere. I thought I didn't care. Now I'm saying a prayer. Hey mister, do you know the way to salvation square?. It's a long long winter. 'til the birds will sing. Oh i'll be waitin' all night for the phone to ring. I'm goin' up in smoke and phoney magazines. Everything is just pieces of my stupid dreams. Everything is just species of my stupid dreams. With the clouds passin' by. With the clouds passin' by. It's all right. 7twenty7 is close to the sky. It carries the world. Between hello and goodbye. Like the monday we met. That disappeared in a breath. Like the sunday she left. Forever smellin' of death. Another jet black night,. Another drink to go. Oh i'll be diving my head. In the pure white snow. God, you'd better take care. Of this gold skinned friend. Tell me, will I ever see her again. Tell me, will I ever see her again"
a thing about you,"I pick up the phone. I'm dialing your number. while I pray you're at home,. at home and alone. 'cause I can't function on my own. And I'll never stop believing. The reaping is done. You are the one. The radio is on but the sound is off gone. And I wanna walk out in the sun. But lately that's been very hard to do. I've got a thing about you. And I don't really know what to do. 'cause I've got a thing about you. Hey you. I pick up the phone. I'm dialing that number and. my heart like a stone. waits for the tone. Oh I can't make it on my own. And I'll never stop believing. I know what is right and this is so wrong. Alone in my bed, better off on my own. The TV is on but the colours are gone.

after all,"Now it’s about time I wrote you a letter. Hey baby, it’s me for worse or for better. Got nothing to waste in pace for another lane. No loss, only gain. I know all we had has dried like the desert. Stains from the sand are still on my T-shirt. And I crave a drink of heavenly cool cool rain. And after all you were the greatest. After all I did my best. There is nothing to regret, big or small. After all, there wasn’t a loophole. We were bound to take the fall. Life goes on and on and on after all. Now it’s about time I settled the story. You slept in too late and missed all the glory. Got stuck in a dream. That finally blurred your brain. I tried to stay sane. Hey love is so blind it pops out the window. But no one will find teardrops on my pillow. As I raise a glass of heavenly cool champagne. Cos after all you were the greatest. After all I did my best. There is nothing to regret,. Large or small, oh no. After all, peep thru any keyhole. And you’ll see we were bound to fall. But life goes on and on and on after all. Yea, life goes on and on and on after all"

We can change the way. I just want your love to stay. No lying no lying no more. You're all i ever wanted. Like an angel you came. Across the sky. You're all i ever wanted. And now you're telling me. Goodbye, bye bye, bye bye,. Goodbye, bye bye, bye bye,. Goodbye..."

I whisper low. Always the last to know. Suspicious calls. I wasn't listening. I never felt that insecure. Memorise. I wasn't reading. I wansn't ready to be sure. I was just a puppet on your late show. Always the last to know. (Chorus:). Sister, sister, brother, brother. Bring out the blessing human touch. You run so fast. I was so slow.

angel passing,"She's an angel passing through the room. (would you like to know her?). She's an angel passing through my room. (would you like to know her?). The red settin' sun feathers down in field of heather. Beautiful. She's then and now, forever. When I ask I ask her for a dance. (every time I see her). We leave the beat, obey the laws of chance. (every time I see her). How sweet surprise – she wears it so it shows. She never hides her eyes. She wears it where it shows. She's an angel passing through the room. Like an angel passing through the room. I wish I could save our souls alone and together. Beautiful. We're then and now, forever. Forever"

All I imagine. Is heaven on earth. I know it's you. Anyone who ever kissed in the rain. Knows the whole meaning. Anyone who ever stood in the light. Needs no explaining. But everything more or less. Appears so meaningless,. Blue and cold. Walking alone. Through the afternoon traffic,. I miss you so. Anyone who felt like I do. Anyone who wasn't ready to fall. Anyone who loved like I do. Knows it never really happens at all. It's over when it's over. What can I do about it. Now that it's over. Everything more or less. Is looking so meaningless. And fades to grey.

It's over when it's over. What can I do about it. Now it's all over"
april clouds,Stay forever. Stay a little while. I'm pleased to have seen you. I'm pleased to have seen your smile. April clouds shaped like shells. April rain should fall somewhere else. I need the sun a soft caress. I wish you the best. It's been a good time. The best there ever was for me. I miss your body. I miss your company. There was a man who looked like you. There were some nights. He passed through the room. I closed my eyes and I felt blessed. I wish you the best. Wherever you go whatever you do. I pray for peace in your heart. May your wishes come true. April clouds shaped like shells. April rain should fall somewhere else. I suggest it takes a rest. Oh I wish you the best. I wish you the best
bad moon,"I read the news today. Felt like nothing to believe in. The time oh the time is just rude. Outside my window. I see the bad moon. I fall asleep with the tears. Taste of tears feels kind of safe. Maybe time, time will change. But right now. I just feel like?. (Chorus:). I don't wanna know a night like this. The bad moon is shining over me. Don't wanna think. Like a lonely lover. Loves to feel all over for me. I put my mind in tonight. She's still ok. After all she'd be through. But the voices kind of said. She's ever changed. (Chorus). You know I love you. Some day I will. I will know you. The whole way. I don't beg you. Only the bad moon. (Chorus)"

Is there someone I can talk to?. Someone on the line?. Does anybody want to know what's on my mind?. Beautiful things like leaves on a tree. Beautiful things, the sky and the sea. Since you've been gone no beautiful thing. seems beautiful to me. Is there someone I can talk to?. Someone out there on the line?. Does anybody want to hear what's on my mind?. Make the grass grow in the garden. when the rain is passin' by. Does anybody want to know. what's on my mind?"
better off on her own,"My girl came home to me. Just the other day, acting OK. I was reading alone. In my favourite room, the TV was on. May I be excused. For not telling the truth. 'Cos she's gone, she said. She's better off on her own. She turned her head. Much better off on her own. My girl knocked on the door. To the place I usually refer to as home. I died, shoelace untied. She looked in my eyes, small and surprised. And God closed every gaze. The moon fell into the lake. Boy, she's gone, adrift. She's better off on her own. She closed, then she left. Much better off on her own. 'Cos she's gone, she said. She's better off on her own. She turned her head. Much better off on her own. 'Cos she's gone, she said. She's better off on her own. The tears I cried. Much better off on her own"

cooper,"Cooper went out. late last night. I heard the slam from her door. Foggy ways,. November daze. All the white wolves were smiling. Cooper went out walkin' the clouds. She left everything in a mess. ""Shut your mouth when you talk to me"". Her words were always so small. And there's a sound from the telephone. When can I say she's coming home?. Leave me the number you're dialing from. and may I ask who's calling?. May I ask who's calling?. Cooper went out, 3 o'clock sharp. I heard the bells from the church. Someone said they saw a car. picking her up by the station. Cooper went out and that's all there is. I'm just no one from next door. Everything will be alright. when all the flowers have cried. Then there's a voice on the telephone. When can I say she's coming home?. Leave me the number you're dialing from. and may I ask who's calling? (who's calling?). May I ask who's calling?

Beaten by the storm, talking to myself. Getting washed by the rain, it's such a cold, cold town. Oh, it's such a cold town. Every time I see you, oh I try to hide away. But when we meet it seems I can't let go. Every time you leave the room I feel. I'm fading like a flower"

Something new has begun. And it's taking control. Of my body and mind. It began when I heard I love you. For the very first time. For the very first time. This life, this love. All the sweetness I feel. So mysterious yet. So incredibly real. It's an uncharted sea. It's an unopened door. But you gotta reach out. And you gotta explore. Even though you're not sure. Till the moment arrives. There he is and you know you're in love. For the very first time. For the very first time. And baby when I met you. Every feeling I had was new. I don't think there are words. To describe the sensation. It's an uncharted sea. It's an unopened door. But you gotta reach out. And you gotta explore. And when something happens. That words can't define. Only then do you know you're in love. For the very first time. For the very first time. For the very first time"

Thinking as one.. A hint in the night, a touch of a dream has come to an end,. We run from one heart to another again.. The rose of our love is withered and torn. And gone from one heart to another.. Sailing away to sea, the ships made of you and me,. They pass in the darkest nights and turn out the lights.. And I thought I'd never know the season to see you go,. Two people twirled into one, being as one.. A hint in the night, a touch of a dream has come to an end,. We run from one heart to another.. The rose of our love is withered and torn. And gone from one heart to another.. Running running from one heart to another."
give you up,Give You Up. I've been hiding. I've been hiding. lost in the love of another. I've followed the moon and a song. and I thought it would take me forever. to find a place where I belong. I watch a rainbow rise. I give you all I've got. I could never give you up. the way you make my love shine. I could never give you up. the way you make true love shine. I believe you when you say. you don't want to be lonely. I'll carry your heart like a bridge. when you need all the time you can find. to get the hurt out of your mind. I'll watch the rain go by. and give you all I've got. Cause I could never give you up. the way you make my love shine. I could never give you up. the way you make true love shine
go to sleep,There's a shadow on the terrace. A snowdance for the living. There's heavy weather on the way. I heard it on the news. And life's a tough principal who won't reward the losers. Your name is on the tea-cup. There's nothing I can do. But to wish you'd think about me before you go to sleep. And I wish you the best there is before you go to sleep. There are tears without the colour. A million seas of water. An ocean full of people where shattered hearts can go. And love's a golden ripple where answers are so simple.

goodbye to you,"Goodbye to you,. Goodbye to broken hearts,. Goodbye to romance,. Hiding in the dark,. Nights that leave a scar.. Goodbye to you,. Goodbye to empty cards,. Goodbye to this ball of bliss,. I'm dancing from your arms.. And I fill the bedroom. With silent visions of rain.. And I paint the morning. With echoes from pleasure in pain.. I don't want to touch emotions,. I just got to run away.. Electric blue like oceans,. Wild like lovers sway.. Goodbye to you.... And I seal the pillow. And shatter dreams down the hall.. And I hang the heartache. Like pictures on the wall.. Can you hear the sound of angels. They're playing hurting games?. Well, I'm a stranger when I'm leaving,. I was a stranger when I came.. Goodbye to you...."
"half a woman, half a shadow","Daylight is breaking again. I hide in the dark. I'm watching the rain. You're out of touch. You're out of reach. What can I say, I never wanted it this way. Love sleeps all alone. The cold telephone, I know the heart. Yes, I know the kind. The kisses of fire, turning to grey. I never wanted it this way. I always wanted you to stay / Wash my pain away, cause I'm half a woman, half a shadow / Love always change with the trees, the spring and the leaves, the waves on the sea. Wilder than light the wind in your eyes led me astray. I never wanted it this way. I always wanted you to stay. Oh I need you, yes I need you. Give me a reason to believe.."

it must have been love,"It must have been love but it's over now.... Lay a whisper on my pillow. Leave the winter on the ground. I wake up lonely, there's air of silence.

Softly angels bow and cry. in the stillness of the night. Never is a long time, goodbye. No answers for the asking. It's a long time, goodbye. No mercy for the aching. It's a long time. Oh I see no light on the forsaken. Never is a long time, goodbye. Let's spend the night. when this dream has come to an end. Sometime you laugh,. sometimes you cry. And yes, I've cried over you. You've left me blind in paradise. You've left me hungering. for the touch of you. Snow white angels run and hide. In the blackness of the night. Never is a long time, goodbye. No answers for the asking. It's a long time, goodbye. No mercy for the aching. It's a long time. Oh I see no light. on the forsaken. Never is a long time, goodbye. Let's spend the night. when this dream has come to an end"
neverending love,"Chasing your shadow, the senses together. Four-leafed and clever I come from behind. Chasing your shadow, I wonder in circles. You're one in a million, we're two of a kind. It's you that I long for, it's you that I hunger. Oh you are the maker of waves in my mind. We dance in the moonlight, a run on the wire. Drawing a fine line, a neverending love. The fever turns slowly into a fire. Drawing a fine line, a neverending love. Chasing your shadow, moon and the water. Field and the reaper, star in the sky. Chasing you shawow, hammer and heartbeat. Clay and new concrete, I follow the sings. It's you that I long for, it's you that I hunger. And you are the maker of waves in my mind"
new world,Yeaheaayeah / The sun is out / The stars are bright / So let's hang out / It's a beautiful night / Let's go to the park / That's nice and green / Before it's getting dark / You are the best I've ever seen / Chorus: / The clouds are slowly growing / Our love is slowly growing into a new world / Oh baby you're my new world / It's a new world / Ohoh a new world / Oh baby you're my new world / Now I'm sure / It's not like before / I've got everything new / All I want is you / The night is late / I just can't wait / Oh please follow me / You're the best I've ever seen / Chorus..
no one makes it on her own,"Have you ever had the feeling. You take it all for granted. You wake up every morning. And expect to rise. Have you ever had a moment. To look into the mirror. To find a person. Who won't open her eyes. Have you ever felt a presence. (or is it all in the past, dear?). So mesmerizing. It chills you to the bone. Have you ever been in love. And overcome that first fear. Well, then you know. No one makes it on her own. Did you ever catch a sunset. Right across the ocean. The universe revealed. And it didn't make sense at all. When you came into my world. Causing quite a commotion. I could have sworn I've met you. Many times before. Cos there's something in your eyes. That links us together. Something 'bout your face, your lips. Your smile looks so alone. Have you ever been in love. And thought it'd last forever. Well, then you know. No one makes it on her own. Oh, OH, OH, Own. Nobody makes it... on. Heeey there's something ..."
oh marie,"Here she comes, she's all dressed up in daisies. Half the time you'd swear that she is crazy. A fancy smile, a fancy dress - that's the way we know her best. She says she is busy - we don't mind. 'Cos every night she works overtime / Oh Marie, we sure hope you're happy. Oh Marie, what would life be without Marie / She likes to drive those cars you find in movies. And every song she hears, she thinks is groovy. One day she'll buy some coats of fur, instead of spending time with Blur. She says that Rolf is hard to please. Knowing her, he's on his knees / Oh Marie... / Here she comes, she tries to make connections. The management is asking for perfection. Her mobile phone goes overload, she's busy dialin' some country code. She speaks fluent French, forget the rest. 'Cos it's the small unsound, we love the best / Oh Marie... / Without Marie.."

one wish,"If you had one wish, what would it be?. If you had one wish, would it be about me?. Just one wish, could it be about me?. You might make a wish for money or peace. You'd make a wish for cosmic relief. Shade by the trees and green summer leaves. Well I was thinking that hey-hey-hey. Maybe one day. A wish of you and me. Yeah hey-hey-hey. Maybe one day. A wish of you and me. Please don't tell me what I don't need to know. Please stop offer what I shouldn't know. I don't wanna know what doesn't show. If you had one wish, what would it be?.

Maybe one day. A wish of you and me"
only when i dream,"To every day there's a history. To every love that's lost there is tragedy. I saved a vision of you in my head. Watched a new universe being born, raised and bred. In the calm of my bed. Some might say it's over now. I don't believe them. If I only got to you. I'd prove I'm right. Only when I dream. I hear you, I'm near you. I hold you close to me. Only when I dream. I touch you and I breathe you. I feel you deep inside me. Things were never easy for me. In the temple we built to stay sacred and free. I came lookin' for more self esteem. All I found was your voice. On the answering machine. Simple and clean. Some might say it's too far gone. I don't believe them. If I could only talk to you. I'd prove I'm right. Only when I dream.... I tried to catch a butterfly. I tried to make God's summer sky. Heal me. Rain exploding in my face. Seems to fade without a trace. Heal me"
opportunity nox,"Well, I like you, I couldn't think of anything but you. For a week I was in love with your hairdo. I couldn't chew those muffins I used to. I knew I was way over the moon. When I met you, when I met you, I didn't know what to do.. When I saw you, when I saw you you said:. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. I'm living in a box but I'm out when opportunity nox.... Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. I'm living in a box but I'm out when opportunity nox.... Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. I'm dying in a box but I'm out when opportunity rox on. I'm sleeping and I'm dreaming so solo.

When I saw you, yeah, when I saw you, I said:. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. I'm living in a box but I'm out when opportunity nox.... Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. I'm living in a box but I'm out when opportunity nox....

paint,"I've got a hot chilly feeling I don't understand. I've got to run through this minute like a hurricane. I've got to tighten my wire from the sense to the soul. I find my back to the wall when it's time to go. I've got to know. is that your heartbeat?. Paint me right. Can you feel the heat in me tonight?. Oh, I. I'm the pearl. Paint your love all over my world. I get a love shockeletric from the touch of your hand. I'm getting lost in the riddles of the modern man. I've got it up down all around tied to the bone.

pay the price,I try to keep your name. And still get rid of your face. I hate to be by myself. All locked away in this place. You turn me inside out. You turn me outside in. Around and upside down. A rollercoaster within. Pay the price of love. When he calls for you. You've got to. Pay the price of love. When he calls for you. I grab my big black book. And call the numbers I know. Something is melting this town. Like it was all made of snow. You turn me inside out. You turn me outside and in. Around and up and down. The elevator within. Pay the price of love (ooh la la la). When he calls for you. You've got to. Pay the price of love (ooh la la la). When he calls for you. Spending the evening alone. With the 10 0'clock news. Looking at you. Through the holes in the soles. Of my old brown shoes
pearls of passion,"There was a banquet of believers. When we walked into the room. December days of X-mas. Felt like days in June. And there were morning light. And sunrise chimes echoed all around. Now's the time for weary minds. The moon is northern bound. And you know I'm going back. Going back today. Back to where I came from. And you know I'm going back. Going back to stay. To the alleys where. Pearls of passion came my way. There's a promise in the twilight. It's so innocent and wild. Two hearts that break the silence. You can hear a distant cry. And there's emptiness and loneliness. It's more or less the same. Let's run between the raindrops. Babe, and catch the mignight train"
perfect day,"Breathe some faith into my chest. Lay me down, I need the rest.. Ever since the sky turned grey. I've waited for the perfect day. Hey now - it seems you've always touched me like the sun.. There's no escape for the broken-hearted. There's no return once you've lost your way. I say a prayer now our love's departed. That you'll come back to stay and bring the perfect day. Blinded by a crazy light. I fell into the darkest night. Those magic ties, the two of u. I couldn't see it turn to dust. Hey now - it seems you've always reached me like the sun. There's no escape for the broken-hearted. There's no return once you've lost your way. I say a prayer now your love's departed. That you'll come back to stay. Bring back the perfect day"
perfect excuse,I wouldn't come alone. I took my memories along. If there's something that I've learned. You can't deny the way. The past dictates each dawn. It's not that I'm afraid. God knows I've made my set of rounds. It's just the way it feels tonight. That makes me lose the plot. What's really goin' down. Too hot to handle. Too hard to lose. Fallin' in love with you. Is a perfect excuse. You make me feel at ease. But I know the final show. If there's something that I've learned. It's better to have left. Before you have to go. It's not that o'm afraid. God knows I've made my set of rounds. You got that twinkle in your eye. That makes me lose my grip. What's really goin' down. Too hot to handle. Too hard to lose. Fallin' in love with you. Is a perfect excuse. Too many heartbeats. Hidin' the truth. Fallin' in love with you. Is a perfect excuse

All the time, to watch you all the time"
queen of rain,"In that big big house there are fifty doors. And one of them leads to your heart. In the time of spring I passed your gate. And tried to make a start. All I knew was the scent of sea and dew. But I've been in love before, how about you?. There's a time for the good in life. A time to kill the pain in life. Dream about the sun you queen of rain. In that big old house there are fifty beds. And one of them leads to your soul. It's a bed of fear, a bed of threats. Regrets and sheets so cold. All I knew, your eyes so velvet blue. I've been in love before, how about you?. There's a time for the good in life. A time to kill the pain in life. Dream about the sun you queen of rain. It's time to place your bets in life. I play the loser's game of life. Dream about the sun you queen of rain. Time went by as I wrote your name in the sky. Fly fly away, bye bye"
reaching high,"I stand alone on the street where I have walked you home alone. I see your house, I hear your main gates moan. I watch two silhouettes turn into one. And then you're gone. Your name upon the door, the heartbreak's home. I make a call, you disconnect the phone. I watch two silhouettes turn into one / Reaching high, reaching high. My love was once a flame. Now I'm putting out the fire, with a pocket full of rain. Yea yea / I don't know why you kept me hanging on all this time. I hear the drums on Radio Goodbye, I watch the shadow dancing in the night, tonight. I see the car, your hunter rides a silver Jaguar. And how I'd like a star before the sun. I watch two silhouettes turn into one / Reaching high...."
real sugar,"Right at the front door I recognised the perfume. The scent was perfect in the dusk by the moon. There must be many ways to ask her to my room. Why didn't I dare?. Well, every hour I try to get somethin' done. Out on the weekend when I'm just havin' some fun. I'm windin' up with none, just zeros, no 1's, just space with no air.

run to you,Baby sometimes I feel like dying. Driving while I'm closing my eyes. Moving in and out of hiding. Trying to catch some truth in my life. Watching your stars and your moonlight.

I'm gonna count on you. I'm gonna follow. Baby what else can I do?. Take a walk inside my dream: a church a lonely road. All the people come and go. Do it now!
salvation,"I can barely remember my past. Everything seems to disappear so fast. But I recall being jealous and alone. Gazing at the dreams going by. I started my life when you knocked on the door. Found something inside I didn't dare to ignore. Now I do believe in flowers on the moon. I'll swim beside the golden tide. You crashed by the gate. Captured my fate. Salvation. My eyes couldn't see.

Come on, bring out the best in me. You crashed by the gate. Captured my fate. Salvation. My eyes couldn't see. I hardly breathed. My heart was asleep. Salvation. Some will get broken. others will get lucky like me meeting you. Don't pass me by. You crashed by the gate. Captured my fate. Salvation. My eyes couldn't see. I hardly breathed.

she's got nothing on (but the radio),"What she got she got to give it to somebody. What she got she got to give it to someone. It’s not a case of growin’ up or lots of money.

Nobody’s got a clue if there is such a reason (- “Yea?”). Why she wanna play it o-on her own. She’s got nothing on but the radio. She’s a passion play. And like the break of day.

sitting on top of the world,"Hey I've paid my dues. I've had my share of holes in the shoes. I'm glad it's all forgotten. I love it when you're free to spoil me rotten. Those little things you know. Night shopping for a soul to go. I'm sitting on top of the world and I like it. I'm sitting on top of the world. I want this to be real. Coming out of my cage made of steel. God I know it's final.

I'm sitting on top of the world and I like it. I like it. Flip right through a magazine. Bottle neck, a tambourine. Light a candle at the show. Swing it, high and low. I'm watching the dawning. I'm sitting on top of the world and I like it. I'm sitting on top of the world and I like it. I'm sitting on top of the world and I like it. Sitting on top of the world and I like it"

so far away,"In the coldest time of year,. Darkness all around my heart. I was alone but didn't fear. To wander in the light of stars. In the bright and silent night,. Winds would knock and disappear. Still I felt the feeling near,. Like the first time you were ever here. You're so far away, so far away,. You left me, you told me you would stay. You never said goodbye. And I'll keep asking why,. I keep on asking how,. Oh come unto me now. I have breathed the morning air,. I have heard the four winds blow. I was weary but prepared. To follow down this lonely road. In the room where lovers sleep,. Winds would knock and disappear. Still I felt the music near,. Like the first time we were ever here. You're so far away, so far away,. You left me, you told me you would stay. You never said goodbye. And I keep wondering why,. I keep on wondering how,. Oh come inside me now. I keep on wondering how,. Oh come inside me now. Nananana. Oh, you're so far away.... So far away."
so you wanna be a rock 'n' roll star?,"So you want to be a rock 'n' roll star?. Then listen now to what I say. Just get an electric guitar. Then take some time and learn how to play. And with your hair swung right. And your pants too tight. It's gonna be all right. Then it's time to go downtown. Where the agent man won't let you down. Sell your soul to the company. Who are waiting there to sell plastic ware. And in a week or two. If you make the charts the girls'll tear you apart. The price you paid for your riches and fame. Was it all a strange game, you're a little insane?. The money, the fame, the public acclaim. Don't forget what you are, you're a rock 'n' roll star!"

No one wants the pain to last. And all the beauty gathered round. Your tainted dream went down the ground. Some other summer. Some other summer. You will do better. Oh, the crash will make you strong. Some other sunshine. Some other shoreline. You will do better. Oh, the burn makes you strong. Some other summer. Some other summer. You will do better.

Oh, I get up and make myself some coffee. I try to read a bit but the story's too thin. I thank the Lord above. That you're not here to see me. In this shape I'm in. Spending my time. Watching the days go by. Feeling so small, I stare at the wall. Hoping that you think of me too. I'm spending my time. I try to call but I don't know what to tell you. I leave a kiss on your answering machine. Oh, help me please. Is there someone who can make me. Wake up from this dream?. Spending my time. Watching the days go by. Feeling so small, I stare at the wall. Hoping that you are missing me too. I'm spending my time. Watching the sun go down. I fall asleep to the sound of ""tears of a clown"". A prayer gone blind. I'm spending my time. My friends keep telling me: ""Hey, life will go on"". Time will make sure I get over you, oh. This silly game of love. You play, you win only to lose, oh. I'm spending my time. Watching the days go by. Feeling so small, I stare at the wall. Hoping that you think of me too. I'm spending my time. Watching the sun go down. I fall asleep to the sound, ""tears of a clown"".

Turn to me when the moon get's too cold. Turn to me, when the story's been told. When everything's dim and grey. When you've hidden the rainbow away. Why don't you turn to me.... Now that christmas is here. I'll shatter your fears and if you want. The secrets of mine, turn to me and read. These lonely, lonely eyes"
view from a hill,"Raging waves sweep this heavy heart. Cold's the color of the dark. Find a byway and climb that hill. Watch the thunder cast a spell. What did you gain from love?. Don't ask me. All for the sweetest thrill. I see a view from a hill, oh oh. I see it perfectly clear. And I cry for the dreams that you kill, oh. View from a hill and it's only a moment away. Love's a rainfall, hard on the head. No escape though you're soaking wet. Leave me blinded by your light. Leave me stranded alone tonight. What did you gain from love?. Don't ask me. All for the cheapest thrill. I see a view from a hill, oh. I see it perfectly clear. And I cry for the dreams that you kill, oh. View from a hill and it's only a motion away. (A motion away). Yeah, yeah, yeah. What did you gain from love?. Don't ask me. All for the sweetest thrill. I see a view from a hill, oh oh. I see it perfectly clear. And I cry for the dreams that you kill, oh. View from a hill and it's only a motion away. (A motion away). I see a view from a hill, oh oh. I see it perfectly clear. And I cry for the dreams that you kill, oh. View from a hill and it's only a motion away. A motion away"
voices,"I knew this would happen. And I don't wanna be around. When it gets out. I've closed the last picture. And painted the windows. Inside and out. Give me your dreams. And I'll give you my time. Together we'll cross the borderline. Voices. Crackin' the night. Voices. That cut like a knife. Voices. Hear them singin'. From sparks to the fire. From here to obsession. They cover the end. Twistin' a match. And see the reflections. Of hunters, of men. Give me your dreams. And I'll give you my time. Until we make it to the borderline. Voices. Crackin' the night. Voices. That cut like a knife. Voices. Hear them singin'. Give me your dreams. And I'll give you my time. (Give you my time). Together we'll cross the borderline. Hear them singin'. Voices. Crackin' the night. Voices. That cut like a knife. Voices. Hear them singin'. Hear them singin'. See and hear them singin'. Hear them singin'. Hear them singin'. Hear them. Hear them singin'. Hear them"
vulnerable,"Everywhere I look I see her smile. Her absent-minded eyes. And she has kept me wondering for so long. How this thing could go wrong. It seems to me that we are both the same. Playing the same game. But as darkness falls this true love falls apart. Into a riddle of her heart. She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands. She's so vulnerable, and I don't understand. I could never hurt the one I love. She's all I've got. But she's so vulnerable. Oh so vulnerable. Days like these no one should be alone. No heart should hide away. Her touch is gently conquering my mind. There's nothing words can say. She's colored with all the secrets of my soul. I've whispered all my dreams. But just as nighttime falls this vision falls apart. Into a riddle of her heart, yea. She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands. She's so vulnerable and I don't understand. I could never hurt someone I love. She's all I've got. But she's so vulnerable. Oh so vulnerable.. Don't hide your eyes...."
waiting for the rain,I'm waiting for the rain. I'm waiting for you. I'm waiting for the rain. To clean my soul. I'm waiting for the rain. Nothing's gonna be better. Without you. The day you left me. The day you came. I'll never forget you. Feel you in my pain. The time stood still. The time was flying. I wonder why. I'm not dying. I'm waiting for the sun. I'm waiting for a new day. I'm waiting for the night. To close my eyes. I'm waiting for the dark. Oh it's gonna be harder. Without you. The way we danced. I'll always miss. I'll never forget. The way we kissed. The time stood still. The time was flying. I wonder why I'm not dying. Na na na na na. Na na na na na.
watercolours in the rain,"Going through the motions. Ending up nowhere at all. Can't see the sun on my wall. Going through emotions. Ending up on a frozen morning. With a heart not even broken. Seems I've been running. All my life, all my life. Seems I've been running. All my life, all my life, all my life. Like watercolors in the rain. Find a place to settle down. Get a job in a city nearby. And watch the trains roll on by. I'll find the falling star. I'll fall In love with the eyes of a dreamer. And then a dream worth believing. Seems I've been running. All my life, all my life. Seems I've been running. All my life, all my life, all my life. Like watercolors in the rain. Like watercolors in the rain. Like watercolors in the rain"
way out,"I used to work it out with my head in a cloud. A record machine playin’ out loud. I guess my fate had to turn. Followed a star to a candle that burned. Bag full of crackers an’ chocolate bars. Breakin’ my back, sleepin’ in cars. Ha! I always woke up in doubt. Well, now I know what the fuss is about. Way out, out of the blue. I met a young girl. It could’ve been you. Hey, what was I supposed to do. I didn’t want to fall in love. Try to keep sane an’ savin’ the light. Two things to do when you can’t fight the night. I always lay down in doubt. Well, now I know what the fuss is about. Way out, out of the blue.... Sometimes you don’t decide for yourself. Sometimes you don’t decide for yourself. Sometimes you can’t decide for yourself. Way out, out of the blue..."

When she whispers in your ear that she's in love?. What's she like?. Oh I've been holding on.... So what's she like?"

why don't you bring me flowers?,"Tell me why don't you bring me flowers?. Tell me why don't you notice me?. Another stranger on a train, a tip rock in the rain. In the rain, in the cold, cold rain. I will throw the past on the fire. I will sing you to sleep when you're tired. When the summer's turning small. I'll buy you a sweater for the fall. Warm and soft like the moonlight. But the now we part into reveal. The truth when we gathered living soul. Teach me how to breathe. Tell me why don't you bring me flowers?. Tell me why don't you notice me?.

wish i could fly,"Halfway through the night. I wake up in a dream.. Echoes in my head make every whisper turn into a scream.. I dreamed I could fly out in the blue.. Over this town followin' you.. Over the trees, subways and cars.. I'd try to find out who you really are.. In the middle of the night (middle of the night). cool sweatin' in my bed.. Got the windows open wide, thinkin'. about all the things you said.. I wish I could fly out in the blue.. Over this town followin' you.. I'd fly over rooftops, the great boulevards to try to find out. who you really are.. Who you really are.. I wish I could fly now.. I wish I could fly now.. I wish I could fly now.. I wish I could fly around and around.. Over this town, the dirt on the ground.. I'd follow your course of doors left ajar to try to find out. who you really are.. Who you really are.. Fly, fly, fly.. I wish I could fly.. I wake up in a dream in the middle of the night.. I wish I could fly.. I wish I could fly."
you can't do this to me anymore,"(You can't do this to me anymore!). You stepped out of a silver van. Driven by rainbow man. You said your name was mary-ann. The coolest plan you had at hand. Arouse them on the garbage cans. Looking grand and slightly tan. Your hair was dancing to the jam. By february, march and fun. You can't do this to me anymore. You can't do this to me anymore!. Looking for that saving grace. I find you tricky to erase. Don't know what I see in space. It might well be a hide in place. Can't stay in, I won't get out. Every emotion seems to shout. I'm going blind into the chase. No chance that I will forget your face. You can't do this to me anymore. You can't do this to me anymore!. You can't do this to me anymore. You can't do this to me anymore!"

you don't understand me,"I've been up all night. You've been putting up a fight. Seems like nothing I say gets through. How did this old bed. Fit a world between me and you?. We said goodnight but the silence was so thick. You could cut it with a knife. We've hit a wall again. And there's nothing I can do. You're the one. Yeah, I've put all my trust in your hands. C'mon and look in my eyes. Here I am, here I am. You don't understand me, my baby. You don't seem to know that I need you so much. You don't understand me, my feelings. The reason I'm breathing, my love. The mornin' comes. And you're reaching out for me. Just like everything's the same. And I let myself believe. Things are gonna change. When you kiss my mouth. And you hold my body close. Do you wonder who's inside?. Maybe there's no way. We could feel each other's pain. Tell me why. It gets harder to know where I stand. I guess loneliness found a new friend. Here I am. You don't seem to get me, my baby. You don't really see that I live for your touch. You don't understand me, my dreams. Or the things I believe in, my love. You don't, don't understand me. No, no. Understand me"
you make it sound so simple,"The world looks complicated. The universe so frustrating. I wish I was blind, just for a moment. I'm having a hard time sleeping. I'm fighting a far light visions.

You turn me on - The thrill of it all / I read in the paper how everything's changed, but it's all the same - it's out of the game. I reach out and touch an endless temptation, live in a dream - the strangest sensation / Move me - You turn me on ... / The lines I have written are the lines on your face, they merge out of nowhere - and leave with no trace. And I've had the feeling we're turnin' to one, when everything's said - when everything's done / Move me - You turn me on ... / You move me - Oh, baby, turn me on.."
