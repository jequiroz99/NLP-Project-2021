Let me be lighter, I'm tired of being a fighter,. I think, a minute's enough,. Just beam me up.. Some black birds soaring in the sky,. Barely a breath I caught one last sight. Tell me that was you, saying goodbye,. There are times I feel the shiver and cold,. It only happens when I'm on my own,. That's how you tell me, I'm not alone. Could you beam me up,. Give me a minute, I don't know what I'd say in it. I'd probably just stare,. Happy just to be there, holding your face. Beam me up,. Let me be lighter, I'm tired of being a fighter,.

So when I need you can I send you a sign. I'll burn a candle and turn off the lights. I'll pick a star and watch you shine. Just beam me up,. Give me a minute, I don't know what I'd say in it.

dear mr. president (feat. indigo girls),Dear Mr. President. Come take a walk with me. Let's pretend we're just two people and. You're not better than me. I'd like to ask you some questions. If we can speak honestly. What do you feel. When you see all the homeless on the street?. Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?. What do you feel when you look in the mirror?. Are you proud?. How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?. How do you dream. When a mother has no chance to say goodbye?. How do you walk with your head held high?. Can you even look me in the eye. And tell me why. Dear Mr. President. Were you a lonely boy?. Are you a lonely boy?. How can you say. No child is left behind. We're not dumb and we're not blind. They're all sitting in your cells. While you pay the road to hell. What kind of father. Would take his own daughter's rights away?. And what kind of father. Might hate his own daughter if she were gay?. I can only imagine what the first lady has to say. You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine. How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?. How do you dream. When a mother has no chance to say goodbye?. How do you walk with your head held high?. Can you even look me in the eye. Let me tell you about hard work. Minimum wage with a baby on the way. Let me tell you about hard work. Rebuilding your house. After the bombs took them away. Let me tell you about hard work. Building a bed out of a cardboard box. Let me tell you about hard work. Hard work. Hard work. You don't know nothing about hard work. Hard work. Hard work. Oh. How do you sleep at night. How do you walk with your head held high. Dear Mr. President. You'd never take a walk with me. Would you?

free,"by P!NKaDA. Free. Everything's broken, but nothing really needs to be fixed. Everything I always say I've always contradict. Don't keep pushing me. Don't keep egging me on. I know you love me baby. But I don't want to know how. Cause I want to be free but there're some things I need. And I want to be free oh baby. Why is it so hard to understand me. I speak clearly. Just give me what I need. Just give me what I need. I'm tired of strangers always coming round. I'm tired of all these favours. Cause I don't know what there about. I got to get away from these conditions. Why just cant I just love myself enough. Instead of looking outside what I should have inside. I want to live in a world with no mirrors. No sizes, no consequences, no prizes. No past, no future. No anger, no losers. No pain, no desire, no faith. These shackles that I tie myself down with. They're weighing me down. I want to fly away. Fly away from here so far. Farther just give me wings yeah. Oh god. Why is it so hard to be free. Just wanna. Just wanna be free. And I wish. I wish I didn’t depend on your love. I wish I loved myself enough. Somebody once told me. You cant take nothing. Nothing but your deeds. I'm not proud of most of mine. But I still have along way to fight. And I'm going down that road. Fast. I wanna be free yeah. Just. Just give me a ticket baby. Oh its what I need. Take it away from me. I wanna be. I wanna be free. And what if I gave up all those things that I did. That I think. Make me who i am. I'm so much love to give. But I'm killing myself"

glitter in the air,"Have you ever fed a lover with just your hands?. Closed your eyes and trusted, just trusted?. Have you ever thrown a fist full of glitter in the air?. Have you ever looked fear in the face and said. ""I just don't care?"". It's only half past the point of no return. The tip of the iceberg, the sun before the burn. The thunder before the lightning, the breath before the phrase. Have you ever felt this way?. Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?. Your whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not alone. Have you ever been touched so gently you had to cry?. Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside?. It's only half past the point of oblivion. The hourglass on the table, the walk before the run. The breath before the kiss, and the fear before the flames. Have you ever felt this way?. lalalalala. There you are, sitting in the garden. Clutching my coffee, calling me sugar. You called me sugar. Have you ever wished for an endless night?. Lassoed the moon and the stars and pulled that rope tight?. Have you ever held your breath and asked yourself. ""Will it ever get better than tonight?"". Tonight.."
god is a dj,"I’ve been a girl with her skirt pulled high. Been the outkast, never running with mascara eyes. Now I see the world as a candy store.

I've been the girl - middle finger in the air. Unaffected by rumors, the truth - I don’t care. So open your mouth, stick out your tongue. Might as well let go, you can’t take back what you’ve done. So find a new lifestyle. A reason to smile. Look for Nirvana. Under the strobe lights. Sequins and sex dreams. You whisper to me. Theres no reason to cry. If God is a DJ, life is a dance floor. Love is a rhythm, you are the music. If God is a DJ, life is a dance floor. You get what you’re given, it’s all how you use it. You take what you get and you get what you give. I said, don’t run from yourself, man, that's no way to live. I've got a record in my bag you should give it a spin. Put your hands in the air so that life can begin. If God is a DJ.

love is such a crazy thing,"LOVE IS SUCH A CRAZY THING. I never thought I’d find someone. But you came along and made me see. That you were the only one for me. Boy, I love you constantly. BRIDGE:. You are my love. My only love. Baby, my heart belongs to you. Be with me. Don’t play with me. If you want love just let me know. CHORUS:. Love, love is such a crazy thing. Never understood the way, I was supposed to feel. Is it love for real. Love, love is such a crazy thing. Never understood the way, I was supposed to feel. Is it love for real. I dreamed of someone like you before. But I never thought I’d get the chance. To romance someone as sweet as you. I hope you feel the same as I do. (bridge-chorus)."
love song,"I've never written a love song. That didn't end in tears. Maybe you'll rewrite my love song. If you can replace my fears. I need your patience and guidance. And all your lovin' and more. When thunder rolls through my life. Will you be able to weather the storm?. There's so much I would give ya, baby. If I'd only let myself. There's this well of emotions. I feel I must protect. But what's the point of this armor. If it keeps the love away, too?. I'd rather bleed with cuts of love. Than live without any scars. Baby, can I trust this?. Or do all things end?. I need to hear that you'd die for me. Again and again and again. So tell me when you look in my eyes. Can you share all the pain and happy times. 'Cause I will love you for the rest of my life. This is my very first love song. That didn't end in tears. I think you re-wrote my love song. For the rest of my years. I wil love you for the rest of my Life"
me and bobby mcgee (cover da janis joplin),"Me And Bobby Mcgee. Busted flat in Baton Rouge. Waitin' for a train. When I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans. Bobby thumbed a diesel down. Just before it rained. He rode us all the way to New Orleans. I pulled my harpoon. Out of my dirty red bandana. I was playin' soft while Bobby sang blues. Windshield wipers slappin' time. I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine. We sang every song that driver knew. Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose. Nothin', I mean nothin' hon' if it ain't free. Yeah, feelin' good was easy Lord, when he sang the blues. Yeah, feelin' good was good enough for me. Good enough for me and my Bobby Mcgee. From the Kentucky coal mines. To the California sun. Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul. Through all kinds of weather. Through everything that we done. Hey, Bobby baby kept me from the cold. One day up near Salinas, Lord. I let him slip away. He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it. Well, I'd trade all o' my tomorrows. For one single yesterday. To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine. Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose. Nothin', an' that's all that Bobby left me, la da. Oh, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues. Yeah, feelin' good was good enough for me, oo oo. Good enough for me and my Bobby Mcgee. La da da. La da da da. La da da da da da da da. La da da da da da da da Bobby Mcgee, yeah.

mean,"You used to hold the door for me, now you can't wait to. leave,. You used to send me flowers if you fucked up in my. dreams,. I used to make you laugh with all the silly shit I did,. But now you roll your eyes and walk away and shake. your head.. When the spark has gone and the candles are out,. When the song is done and there's no more sound,. Whispers turn to yellin' and I'm thinkin,. How did we get so mean?. How do we just move on?. How do you feel in the morning when it comes and. everything's undone?. Is it cause we wanna be free? Well that's not me,. Normally I'm so strong,. I just can't wake up on the floor like a thousand times before,. Knowing that forever won't be.. Always sentimental when, I think of how it was,. When love was sweet and new and we just, couldn't get enough,. The shower it reminds me you'd undress me with your. eyes,. And now you never touch me and you tell me that you're. tired.. You know I get so sad when it all goes bad,. And all you think about is all the fun you had,. And all those sorries ain't never gonna mean a thing,. ohhh. How did we get so mean?. How do we just move on?. How do you feel in the morning when it comes and. everything's undone?. Is it cause we wanna be free? Well that's not me,. Normally I'm so strong,. I just can't wake up on the floor like a thousand times before,. Knowing that forever won't be,. Oh we said some things that we can never take back,. It's like a train wreck tryna hit the right track,. We opened up the wine and we just let it breathe,. But we shoulda drank it down while it was still sweet,. It all goes bad eventually.. Now do we stay together cause, we're scared to be. alone?. We got so used to this abuse, it kind of feels like home. But my baby I, just really wanna know, ohhh.. How did we get so mean?. How do we just move on?. How do you feel in the morning when it comes and. everything's undone?. Is it cause we wanna be free? Well that's not me,. Normally I'm so strong,. I just can't wake up on the floor like a thousand. times before,. Knowing that forever won't be."
misery (feat. steven tyler),"Shadows are fallin' all over town. Another night these blues got me down. Oh misery ... I sure could use some company. Since he's been gone I ain't been the same. I carry the weight like an ol' ball and chain. Guess it's all meant to be .... For love to cause me misery. Oh, misery ... Oh, misery .... Tell me, why does my heart make a fool out of me?. Seems it's my destiny,. For love to cause me misery. Oh, I've been down this road before. Where the passion turns into pain. And each time I saw love walk out the door. I swore I'd never get caught again. But ain't it true ... It takes what it takes. And sometimes, we get too smart too late. One more heartache for me. Another night in misery. Misery ... Misery .... Tell me, why does my heart make a fool out of me?. Misery ... Misery .... Tell me, why does my heart make a fool of me?. Seems it's my destiny,. For love to cause misery. Guess it's all meant to be,.

my vietnam,Daddy was a soldier. He taught me about freedom. Peace and all the great things. That we can take advantage of. Once I fed the homeless. I´ll never forget. The look upon their faces as I. Treated them with respect. CHORUS. This is my Vietnam. I´m at war. Life keeps on dropping bombs. And I keep score. Mama was a lunatic. She liked to push my buttons. She said I wasn´t good enough. But I guess I wasn´t trying. Never liked school that much. They tried to teach me better. But I just wasn´t hearing it. Because I thought I was already pretty clever. Repeat CHORUS (x 2). What do you expect from me. What am I not giving you. What could I do for you. To make me okay in your eyes. Repeat CHORUS.
need me (feat. eminem),"[verse 1: p! nk]. You're drunk, the coffee is burned. I hate to find you like this. I always find you like this. I come home and clean up your mess. What would you do without that?. Why do I always come back?. Oh, what I wouldn't do for you. [hook: p! nk]. And I'm starting to think maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. And I'm starting to think maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. [verse 2: p! nk & eminem]. Some nights I want to run for the hills. It's never easy with you. I cannot reason with you. But your smile is as rare as it comes. What would I do without that. Maybe that's why I come back. Oh, what I wouldn't do for you. [hook: p! nk]. And I'm starting to think maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. And I'm starting to think maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. [verse 3: eminem]. Starting to think we were made for each other. But one of us in this relationship. Is raising the other. You remind me of my mother. We drive one another as crazy as each other. And we're both adults so there's no excuse. For the games that we play with each other. Where you at? at a friends?. No you ain't, motherfucker. But I give her the benefit of the doubt. Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver. When I touch her. 'cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker. Our bottom lip can quiver. When she's in trouble, she's in hot water. Think I caught her cheating again. Give her another chance?. Another one after that?. I'm swimming in that egyptian river. Cause I'm in denial. Say I don't eat shit. But I got a shit-eating grin when I smile. Making an excuse for us to act it out. She's just acting out, with her inner child. Then I set the truth on fire. Cause I'd rather believe a lie. Then breathe a sigh of relieve. That I don't believe in. Going to bed mad. I keep on trying to make a bad girl good. But haven't I stood by you in good times?. And bad?. I'm starting to feel like you're god damn dead. 'cause I literally feel. Like you could die of a ""should I? "". Leave me for good? you never would. Never understood why they call it goodbye. But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy. And you're a good person, too. I can save you, I can make you change. But I keep putting my fuckin foot in my mouth. Every time I gotta come to bail you out. When you get in trouble. That you get yourself in. I miss trouble but I can't leave. I'll sell you out!. I could never turn my fuckin' back on you. What is that?. I'm co-dependant, I'm just now noticing it. But somehow it's like. Every time I go to end it. I don't have the cahoney's to do it. Nor the heart, uh, department store. You're using my heart for a dart board. But god must've had a non-stop score. 'cause somebody paired us up. But people say. He ain't capable of making a mistake. But this one's perfect. 'cause I'm.

try/ just give me a reason (feat. nate ruess),"Ever wonder 'bout what he's doin'. How it all turned to lies. Sometimes I think that it's better. To never ask why. Where there is desire there is gonna be a flame. Where there is a flame someone's bound to get burned. But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die. You gotta get up and try, and try, and try. You gotta get up and try, and try, and try. You gotta get up and try, and try, and try. Funny how the heart can be deceiving. More than just a couple times. Why do we fall in love so easy. Even when it's not right. Where there is desire there is gonna be a flame. Where there is a flame someone's bound to get burned. But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die. You gotta get up and try, and try, and try. You gotta get up and try, and try, and try. You gotta get up and try, and try, and try. Ever worry that it might be ruined. Does it make you wanna cry. When you're out there doin' what you're doin'. Are you just getting by. Tell me are you just getting by, by, by. Where there is desire there is gonna be a flame. Where there is a flame someone's bound to get burned. But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die. You gotta get up and try, and try, and try. You gotta get up and try, and try, and try. You gotta get up and try, and try, and try. . I'm sorry I don't understand. Where all of this is coming from. I thought that we were fine (oh we had everything). Your head is running wild again. My dear we still have everythin'. And it's all in your mind. You've been havin' real bad dreams oh oh.

vma 2017 medley,"I'm coming up so you better get this party started. Get this party started on a Saturday night. Everybody's waiting for me to arrive. Sending out the message to all of my friends.

All my underdogs. We will never be never be anything but loud. And nitty gritty dirty little freaks. Won't you come on and come on and raise your glass. Just come on and come on and raise your glass.

waiting for love,"She looks to the sun. Help her to carry on. Breaking down all the years. Wondering how she got here. She drifts through the sky. Counting the reasons why. How my life turned so fast. Remembering all of the past. All the changes and all the mistakes. Foolishly laughing at things that. Words that she says. She looks to the stars. Breaking time to follow the heart. Her world is falling apart. And the turning of every new page. A book on the shelf that is there to remain. Breaking the walls as she's tearing them down. As she is starting to drown. She's waiting for love. She's waiting, waiting for love. She's waiting, waiting for love. She's waitied, waited so long. She prays to the gods. Telling how she needs someone. Help me find where I am today. Life is looking very gray. All the changes and all the mistakes. Foolishly laughing at things that. Everything that she says. Waiting for love. She's waiting, waiting for love. She's waiting, waiting for love. She's waiting, waiting for love. I'm waiting for a new day to rise. Conversations to make sense to me and my mind. I need someone to lift me right off of my feet. And I want it and I need it. And I'll leave it all behind. And all the changes are made. And I'll remember the words that you'll never say. Waiting for love. She's waiting, waiting for love. She's waiting, waiting for love. She's waiting, waiting for love. She's waiting for love. She's waiting, waiting for love. She's waiting for love. She's waiting for love. She's waiting for love. Waiting for love. She's waiting, waiting for love. She's waiting, waiting for love. She's waiting, waiting for love. She looks to the sun"

When times got hard you always walked away. It's just too hard for you to talk to me. Sorry baby but I'm leaving. Now it's my turn, I'm gonna do the same. I'm gonna do the same. I'm gonna walk away.

when i saw you girl,When I saw you girl from across the room. You had your eyes on me. I had my eyes on you. We went to the bar. Bought a zamboca. I gave you my number. And you took my number
when we're through,"I woke up early evening and I knew I was alone. Did the sun come up or did it rain again, I’ll never know. I felt the acid in my stomach rise above my throat as I dialled. There was a message from my mother. From about 7a.m. said I’ve forgotten what you sound like. And I’m wonderin’ how you’ve been. I cried myself to asleep back on the floor. Unconscious in denial. CHORUS:. Life is just a little part of what the world will do. To get it’s point across it beats you ‘til you’re black & blue. And decides just when you’re in or when you’re out. ‘Cause when you’re through you’re through. There’s a cafי just ‘round the corner from the home I call a house. I sit and play sudoku ‘til I figure some sh1t out. I drink the day’s first coffee and I smoke the last cigarette of my life. And I’m wondering out of all the crazy places that I’ve been. Would it ever be as good as sittin’ here just with a friend?. Where it's always understood it might be time, to switch the coffee to wine. CHORUS:. Life is just a little part of what the world will do. To get it’s point across it beats you ‘til you’re black & blue. And decides just when you’re in or when you’re out. ‘Cause when you’re through you’re through. Yeah, Yeah.. Whoaaaah, Ohhhh.. Whoaaaaahhhhhh. Ohhhh, Ohhh, Ohhh.. Oh.. Janis sings to me just like she’s sitting by my side. And I wonder just how many times she sat like me and cried. I’ve made it past the age of twenty-seven so there’s no use in dyin’. And my friends have asked the question:. “Baby, will you be okay?”. I wanna tell them yes ‘cause I know that’s what I should say. But I’ve got no crystal ball and I can’t bring myself to lie and why should I?. Hey, yeahhhh - I think that…... Life is just a little part of what the world will do. It’s brings us to the brink and beats the sh1t right outta you. And decides just when you’re in or when you’re out. ‘Cause when you’re through you’re through. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. Life is just a little part of what the world will do. It’s brings us to the brink and beats the sh1t right outta you. And decides just when you’re in or when you’re out. When you’re through you’re through. Ayyye, Oh.. I guess I’m through. Mmmmm. When you’re through, you’re through."
where did the beat go?,Oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh. Ba da ba bum. Oh oh oh oh (ba da ba bum). Ba da ba bum. Oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh. I can hear planes flying over my head. Just hours before you occupied my bed. In our darkness we conjured up sunlight. In our haste our need our thirst. We lost our sight. But I was inspired tracing the lines on your face. To the poetry the first time I heard your name. When I trip from your lips. My heart was like a kick drum. And it silence the guilt. I wasn't raised to hurt anyone. Uh oh. Does he know. That I'm lyin' in the afterglow. That I'm lyin' but I can't go. Can't say no. Make him think he's crazy. While his paranoia grows. What he should be askin'. Is where did our love go. Then I wouldn't be askin'. In another man's afterglow. Where did the beat go?. Where is the beat?. Where did the beat go?. So how do I justify to the judge and the jury. The voice in my head that caused this fury. Never had to play with matches to start a fire. But it got so cold and I'd thought I'd forgotten desire. I was your concubine and then your madonna. You couldn't see anything beyond your baby's mama. How long in lonely supposed to last?. I was naked and waiting for you to come back. Uh oh. Does he know. That I'm lyin' in the afterglow. That I'm lyin' but I can't go. Can't say no. Make him think he's crazy. While his paranoia grows. What he should be askin'. Is where did our love go. Then I wouldn't be askin'. In another man's afterglow. Where did the beat go?. Where is the beat?. Where did the beat go?. Oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh. There's a cause and effect although I took the steps. I dove off of the bridge cause I had nothin' left. All I ever wanted was you(oh oh). And in the absence of you. I fell through. Uh oh. Does he know. That I'm lyin' in the afterglow. That I'm lyin' but I can't go. Can't say no. Make him think he's crazy. While his paranoia grows. What he should be askin'. Is where did our love go. Then I wouldn't be askin'. In another man's afterglow. Where did the beat go?. Where is the beat?. Where did the beat go?
where we go,"Got a hole in my head and my heart tonight. Well you shot me down, you just ain't right. Comes a time when you know you must let go. I know, I know. We fixed it, but it's broken. Got a feeling we gonna get this wrong. And even I can't be this strong. It's a breath that you take right before you die. We lie and lie. Can't say we didn't try though. So here we go. Take my body, not my soul. Took me high and left me low. I honestly never imagined we'd get this far. There's a road that takes me home. Take me fast or take me slow. Throw my head out the window. Feel the wind, make me whole. Write my name up in the sky. As we contemplate goodbye. I don't know, we don't know, where we go. There's not a holy man or prayer in sight. There's not a priest around to read our rights. There's no magic ball to save our lives. I know, I know. We've both always been broken. But you had a way of making me forget. All the sadness rollin' 'round my head. Well, that was until I wished us dead. You had my heart. I wish you would have kept it. This world we know. It takes our bodies, not our souls. It takes us high and leaves us low. But they honestly never imagined we'd get this far. There's a road that takes me home. Take me fast or take me slow. Throw my head out the window. Feel the wind, make me whole. Write my name up in the sky. As we contemplate goodbye. I don't know, we don't know, where we go. Death is in the air tonight. I can smell the fear inside. We can see when we close our eyes. That's it's alright, it's alright. Promise me you'll stay with me. If just for one more night. You can hold me honestly. 'cause it's alright, it's alright. There's a road that takes me home. Take me fast or take me slow. Throw my head out the window. Feel the wind, make me whole. Write my name up in the sky. As we contemplate goodbye. I don't know, we don't know, where we go. There's a road that takes me home. Take me fast or take me slow. I don't know, we don't know. Take me home"
white rabbit,"One pill makes you larger. And one pill makes you small. And the ones that mother gives you. Don't do anything at all. Go ask Alice. When she's ten feet tall. And if you go chasing rabbits. And you know you're going to fall. Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar. Has given you the call. Call Alice. When she was just small. When the men on the chessboard. Get up and tell you where to go. And you've just had some kind of mushroom. And your mind is moving low. Go ask Alice. I think she'll know. When logic and proportion. Have fallen sloppy dead. And the White Knight is talking backwards. And the Red Queen's ""off with her head!"". Remember what the dormouse said. ""Feed your head. Feed your head"""
who knew,You took my hand. You showed me how. You promised me you'd be around. Uh huh. That's right. I took your words. And I believed. In everything. You said to me. Yeah huh. That's right. If someone said three years from now. You'd be long gone. I'd stand up and punch them out. Cause they're all wrong. I know better. Cause you said forever. And ever. Who knew. Remember when we were such fools. And so convinced and just too cool. Oh no. No no. I wish I could touch you again. I wish I could still call you friend. I'd give anything. When someone said count your blessings now. 'Fore they're long gone. I guess I just didn't know how. I was all wrong. They knew better. Still you said forever. And ever. Who knew. Yeah yeah. I'll keep you locked in my head. Until we meet again. Until we. Until we meet again. And I won't forget you my friend. What happened?. If someone said three years from now. You'd be long gone. I'd stand up and punch them out. Cause they're all wrong and. That last kiss. I'll cherish. Until we meet again. And time makes. It harder. I wish I could remember. But I keep. Your memory. You visit me in my sleep. My darling. Who knew. My darling. My darling. Who knew. My darling. I miss you. My darling. Who knew. Who knew

wild hearts can't be broken,"I will have to die for this, I fear. There's rage and terror and there's sickness here. I fight because I have to. I fight for us to know the truth. There's not enough rope to tie me down. There's not enough tape to shut this mouth. The stones you throw can make me bleed. But I won't stop until we're free. Wild hearts can't be broken. No, wild hearts can't be broken. This is my rally cry. I know it's hard, we have to try. This is a battle I must win. To want my share is not a sin. There's not enough rope to tie me down. There's not enough tape to shut this mouth. The stones you throw can make me bleed. But I won't stop until we're free. And wild hearts can't be broken. No, wild hearts can't be broken. You beat me, betray me. You're losing, we're winning. My spirit above me. You cannot deny me. My freedom is burning. This broken world keeps turning. I'll never surrender. There's nothing, but a victory. There's not enough rope to tie me down, oh. There's not enough tape to shut this mouth. The stones you throw can make me bleed. But I won't stop until we're free. Wild hearts can't be broken. Wild hearts can't be broken. This wild heart can't be broken"

you get my love,"While you were sleeping, I decided to lay it out. Every bad reason. All of my pointless doubts. Where I went wrong. I whispered the ways that I'm ashamed of myself. While you were dreaming, I handed you all my fears. My thoughtless decisions. Turned into thoughtful tears. What have I done for the first time. I blame myself. But you get my love, baby. You get my love. If there's only one thing about me that you can trust. You get my love, baby. You get my love. Don't let my mistakes take that away from us. You get my love. I'm no longer hiding.
