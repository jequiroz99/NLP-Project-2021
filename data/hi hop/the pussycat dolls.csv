i hate this part,"We're driving slow through the snow on 5th Avenue. And right now, radio's all that we can hear. Now we ain't talk since we left, it's so overdue. It's cold outside but between us it's worse in here. The world slows down. But my heart beats fast right now. I know this is the part. Where the end starts. I can't take it any longer. Thought that we were stronger. All we do is linger. Slipping through my fingers. I don't wanna try now. All that's left is goodbye. To find a way that I can tell you. I hate this part right here. I hate this part right here. I just can't take your tears. I hate this part right here. Everyday, seven takes of the same old scene. Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine. Gotta talk to you now before we go to sleep. But will you sleep once I tell you what's hurting me?. The world slows down. But my heart beats fast right now. I know this is the part. Where the end starts. I can't take it any longer. Thought that we were stronger. All we do is linger. Slipping through my fingers. I don't wanna try now. All that's left is goodbye. To find a way that I can tell you. I hate this part right here. I hate this part right here. I just can't take your tears. I hate this part right here. I know you'll ask me to hold on. And carry on like nothing's wrong. But there is no more time for lies. 'Cause I see sunset in your eyes. I can't take it any longer. Thought that we were stronger. All we do is linger. Slipping through our fingers. I don't wanna try now. All that's left is goodbye. To find a way that I can tell you. But I gotta do is,. I gotta do it,. I gotta do it. I hate this part. I gotta do it,. I gotta do it,. I gotta do it. I hate this part right here. I hate this part right here. And I just can't take these tears. I hate this part right here"

sway,"When marimba rhythms start to play. Dance with me, make me sway. Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore. Hold me close, sway me more. Like a flower bending in the breeze. Bend with me, sway with ease. When we dance you have a way with me. Stay with me, sway with me. Other dancers may be on the floor. Dear, but my eyes will see only you. Only you have that magic technique. When we sway I go weak. I can hear the sounds of violins. Long before it begins. Make me thrill as only you know how. Sway me smooth, sway me now. Sway me, Make me. Thrill me, hold me. Bend me, ease me. You have a way with me. Sway me (sway). Other dancers may be on the floor. Dear, but my eyes will see only you.

hush hush,Uh uh uh ohh yeah. I never needed you to be strong. I never needed you to be pointing out my wrongs. I never needed pain. I never needed strain.

I don't know why you think you got a hold on me. And it's a little late for conversations. There isn't anything for you to say. And my eyes hurt hands shiver. So look at me and listen to me. Because. I don't want to stay another minute. I don't want you to say a single word. Hush hush. Hush hush. There is no other way. I get the final say. Because. I don't want to do these any longer. I don't want you. There's nothing left to say. Hush hush. Hush hush. I've already spoken. Our love is broken. Baby. Hush hush. I never need your corrections. On everything from how I act to what I say. I never need words. I never need hurt. I never need you to be there everyday. I'm sorry for the way I let go. Of everything I wanted when you came along. But I'm never beaten. Broken not defeated. I know next to you is not where I belong. And it's a little late for explanations. There isn't anything that you can do. And my eyes hurt hands shiver. So you will listen when I say. Baby. I don't want to stay another minute. I don't want you to say a single word. Hush hush. Hush hush. There is no other way. I get the final say. Because. I don't want to do these any longer. I don't want you. There's nothing left to say. Hush hush. Hush hush. I've already spoken. Our love is broken. Baby. Hush hush. No more words. No more lies.

i hate this part,"We're driving slow through the snow on 5th Avenue. And right now, radio's all that we can hear. Now we ain't talk since we left, it's so overdue. It's cold outside but between us it's worse in here. The world slows down. But my heart beats fast right now. I know this is the part. Where the end starts. I can't take it any longer. Thought that we were stronger. All we do is linger. Slipping through my fingers. I don't wanna try now. All that's left is goodbye. To find a way that I can tell you. I hate this part right here. I hate this part right here. I just can't take your tears. I hate this part right here. Everyday, seven takes of the same old scene. Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine. Gotta talk to you now before we go to sleep. But will you sleep once I tell you what's hurting me?. The world slows down. But my heart beats fast right now. I know this is the part. Where the end starts. I can't take it any longer. Thought that we were stronger. All we do is linger. Slipping through my fingers. I don't wanna try now. All that's left is goodbye. To find a way that I can tell you. I hate this part right here. I hate this part right here. I just can't take your tears. I hate this part right here. I know you'll ask me to hold on. And carry on like nothing's wrong. But there is no more time for lies. 'Cause I see sunset in your eyes. I can't take it any longer. Thought that we were stronger. All we do is linger. Slipping through our fingers. I don't wanna try now. All that's left is goodbye. To find a way that I can tell you. But I gotta do is,. I gotta do it,. I gotta do it. I hate this part. I gotta do it,. I gotta do it,. I gotta do it. I hate this part right here. I hate this part right here. And I just can't take these tears. I hate this part right here"

sway,"When marimba rhythms start to play. Dance with me, make me sway. Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore. Hold me close, sway me more. Like a flower bending in the breeze. Bend with me, sway with ease. When we dance you have a way with me. Stay with me, sway with me. Other dancers may be on the floor. Dear, but my eyes will see only you. Only you have that magic technique. When we sway I go weak. I can hear the sounds of violins. Long before it begins. Make me thrill as only you know how. Sway me smooth, sway me now. Sway me, Make me. Thrill me, hold me. Bend me, ease me. You have a way with me. Sway me (sway). Other dancers may be on the floor. Dear, but my eyes will see only you. Only you have that magic technique. When we sway I go weak. I go weak. I can hear the sounds of violins. Long before it begins. Make me thrill as only you know how. Sway me smooth, sway me now. Make me thrill as only you know how. Sway me smooth, sway me now. Make me thrill as only you know how. Sway me smooth, sway me now. Sway me. Sway me. Sway me now"
"how many times, how many lies","People tried to tell me something. Oh, but I was hearing nothing. When they said you was just playing me. I didn't listen. I didn't want to.

How many times?. How many lies?. How long you been sneaking?. How long you been creeping around?. How many lies?. How many times,. Were you here decieving. When I was here believing in you?. Gotta put the blame on myself. Should've known what everyone else knew. When they knew you was just bad news. I should've walked out (I should've walked out). I should've seen clear (I should've seen clear). Glad your sad ass is out of here. I've gone and thrown out all the records. All the ones that ever reminded me of you. I've gone and torn up all the pictures. 'Cause there was not one shred of truth. How many times?. How many lies?. How long you been sneaking?. How long you been creeping around?. How many lies?. How many times,. Were you here decieving. When I was here believing (in you)?. (There were so many times. There were so many lies. I don't know why I stayed aroud. There were so many days. There were so many games). I should've thrown your sad ass out. (But now the game is through. I'll never trust in you. I've finally got wise). I opened up my eyes. (Your game is over).
