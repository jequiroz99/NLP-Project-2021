coffee break,"This song is for everyone. who tends to indulge a little. While on their coffee break. [Intro Verse]. Ok my coffee break is me time, basically that's weed time. My co-worker man she's fine, walks by I beeline. In pursuit with no deny I'm on that ass like Levi's. I told my boss to fuck off, middle finger no peace sign (bitch). [Verse 1]. Break time, so break that down. Roll it up go head pass that around. Light it up till they passing out. Flow is rough, go head ask about. Rip up tracks, lap around. Laugh about how we I'm macking now. Herbals out by the pound. Are loud as fuck bitch how that sound?. Drugs out here like gold. I'm representing my home. Marietta I am so blown. So don't let me get in my zone. She's reluctant of my brand, you know these dudes in bands. Like my women like my coffee though, sweet and tan. Shawty, ugh, yup she's falling for it. Jumped on train yup all aboard. I Spit slick like olive oil. But she don't spit she swallow all. She got me. Heart is beating like rocky. I fell in love just stop me. Wait that's probably all of this molly. I need some water; I think I took too much. So somebody call a doctor, I think my heart just stop. But check out my roster, and no this isn't luck. I like my woman like my coffee, hot as fuck. [Verse 2]. Break time, so break it down. Make time, make you bounce. Take mine, go head make my rounds. Cake time lets make these pounds. Shake down, get you out. Fuck that skirt, loose that blouse. 8 times, I think it went down. Wait 9... I lost count. Ok, ill admit I'm in a daze. Last couple days been a haze. When I blazed everything in my way. Like a rat in a maze and I made it out now bitch I'm amazed. Often baked on my coffee break. Often late when I contemplate. Your talk is great but it's awkwardly. Marvin Gaye, no chardonnay. I'm Back at it with a flow so sick. Sick as fuck they don't hope I live. Wordsmith you better hope I miss. I'm High as fuck ayo co pilot. Woodstock like Joan Biaz. Count me out well they so biased. Sleeping on me how dope I is. Fuck all ya'll (Hold My Dick). Run and tell yo how I kill these beats. They love me up in languages that I don't speak. Ok she was so intrigued I think she's form Belize. So yes you can believe she was screaming (hi papi). And though it was intense I ain't spoken to her sense. She even told her friends around me to watch her step. I'm dressed up to the 9's and She's looking like a 10. I met her at 11, and by 12 I was in"
cut me down,"Okay, I hopped up out of bed and yep, I turned my swag on. Little kids playing outside, getting their laugh on. I woke up from the noise, and I couldn't be mad. I've been gone for a minute, it's so good to be back. But it's time to relapse. Fell back into the rhythm of the ??. of livin and these skills I've been given. Never thought I'd make a living off this timin and precision. Got some rhymes hot enough to get a baker out the kitchen. Okay life is what you make it. And I'll take it if you give it. And I got these critics living. I surpassed all their limits. I mastered the craft in the lab like a chemist. Triple bypass on a track, call a medic. It's a nice warm day, water with some lemon. Got me wonder why I am thinking bout this music stressin. Wonder why I am even second guessing. it's a blessin just to be here. Specially when there's weed here. Hah, roll up. All I have fore you cut me down. All I have fore you cut me down. D-d-d-down. Now you can cut me down. But Imma bounce back like I must rebound. Turn a beat into a luxury how. After this Imma make sure you love me now. Imma keep on flowin till you bump my shit. Tell creative lovin they can suck my dick. Little faggots aint doin nothin but bumpin lifts. Give it a year, man, you bustas gon be bustin dishes. I'm a problem. Let em hate on me like it's an option. I bet they gon regret that decision up in the long run. They dont see my vision, man they trippin like they on some. Pretty sure their girls gon be fans when the song's done. Love it how I'm so hip hop in flip flops. Flows so tip top. Haters can lip lock. Barrel of a gun, kill yourself man, kick rocks. Right off a cliff, shit go head man get a walk. I'm tryin to keep a sucka-free zone this year. Steer clear from all these fuckers and these clones out here. So cheer cheer man these poems that I loan your ears. Are nothin more than my thoughts and my soul to bear. They cut me down. All I have fore you cut me down. All I have fore you cut me down. D-d-d-down. Now you can cut me down. But Imma bounce back like I must rebound. Turn a beat into a luxury how. After this Imma make sure you love me now. I spend a lot of time drinkin. A lot of time thinkin. Bout advice dudes give me but none of it seems to sink in. People really my friends, or tryin to benefit?. Either way, nowadays it's gettin harder to distinguish. I pay attention to some people I don't know. I got a small circle that I'm tryin to keep closed. Couple enemies that I'm tryin to keep close. They still irkin, but can't you see I'm workin?. Relentless persistence infectin the system. They can't get rid of me, I'm hittin like a kick drum. Aint tryin to socialize, workin on a thick buzz. Give me a coke on the rocks and some mixed rum. G-gawkin, starrin like a comet in the clouds. Every comet that's pronounced. Got me caught up with these clowns. We aint got shit in common so dont bother callin now. Cuz I got a chick at the crib tryin to cut down. All I have fore you cut me down. All I have fore you cut me down. D-d-d-down. Now you can cut me down. But Imma bounce back like I must rebound. Turn a beat into a luxury how. After this Imma make sure you love me now"

Don't wake me up if I'm sleeping. Call me the foolish dreamer. You fool you ... I live and I breathe it. My heads in the clouds. I'm the foolish dreamer. I'm starting making in america. Without breaking my character. They're trying to want me. I don't break it down barriers. So call it out the fact in the... All attractive multiply. But now they say is that enough. And when they seem like I was out number. It worked down all the doubt wonders. Still spit fire been hot yeah summer. I'm so cold with the flow yeah thunder. Keep sleeping on me good red is going rest up. I see this dream even catch up. Used to be this little kill with big dreams. But now I spit 60s on big screens. And get date. [chorus:]"

Swiss is sweet Al Green when I wake up. breaking up the bake up shit hit the pan and. I don't think we gonna make up. Damn take it at random nigger frame you.

I'm to blame the records keeps skipping baby I'ma change. Ride a plane with the chain small jam to the brain. left a pain on my heart. and now stains on my. what remains in the darkness hide off fell apart. when it comes to the light I can't grind from the right.

I'm still sipping I'm still mixing all these uppers and downers. like my common sense is missing. conscience is screaming I ain't trying to listen. loving it a nigger anymore it got evicted. So now it's back to square one back in the day girls. Passed on the square one now they're running circles. It's kinda universal how they back track react when they hurt you. When all this whack rap in fact is just a virtue. cause they are blowing up in my dream I'm trying to pursue. And purchase some time move forwards towards if. I get up to the top. she ain't there and hurts more. What if I can't forget you open your name into my thought. I'll be the fire that will catch you. What's so good about picking up the pieces.

I'm a train wreck on a track therapy session. Every time I'm in the booth let loose. What if I can't forget you open your name into my though. I'll be the fire that will catch you. What's so good about picking up the pieces. Now the colors ever be reminded just why?. Just get back to me you know I can't find the ladders and leave. so baby what if I can't forget you. what if I can't forget you. What's so good about picking up the pieces. What's so good about.
