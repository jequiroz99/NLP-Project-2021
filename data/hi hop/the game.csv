we are the champions,"[Chorus]. I am the champion my friend. And I'll keep on fighting 'till the end. I am the champion. I am the champion. Don't end for loser cause I am the champion. Guess whos back in a son of a bitch. Underground king with a gun on his hip. Not the UGK like Bun B and Pimp C. But I got the Ghost Unit bumpin in my Bentley. Ain't shit changed with the guts in a range. And no more Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck in my lane. I'm a hood nigga for real motherfuck the fame. Nigga I'ma get mine. You can hate it or love it but it's a thin line. Between G-Unot and G-Unit. Nigga talk shit catch one in the hip. Fuck beef for the rhyme. 50 forgot about his but I took mine. I showed you all 5 but he never took 9. He rap like Trina blah blah blah. Ok, shut up. Let us see the wound. Show it to the world. He got shot in the mouth and cried like a girl. You sing like a girl. And I gangbang so hard it'll bring back curls. I'm tellin' your fan don't believe that shit. Tryin beef with The Game like he that sick. You movie was trash and I went to see that shit. With a camera and got it on DVD that quick. Chicken Little and Harry Potter. The bootleg hell yeah we got 'em. Two movies 15 dollars with no numbers on the bottom. Hahahahahahaha.... Chicken Little ghetto pimp!. [Chorus]. I am the champion my friend. And I'll keep on fighting 'till the end. I am the champion. I am the champion. Don't end for loser cause I am the champion"
100 (feat. drake),"[Intro: Game]. (Johnny Juliano). (Cardo got wings). Real nigga shit. Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, Ob. We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life. Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing. [Verse 1: Game]. Niggas called me to set you up. Want me to come and wet you up. Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie. Heard about the shit with Diddy. So I came through to vest you up. And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush. A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what. I got L. A. unified, you better off committin' suicide. Teachers ain't testin' us. See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus. Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up. Tat you up, but it's Ovo Blood Money. Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus. Dawg, fame is a motherfucker. Do a nigga four favors when you can't do the fifth. How soon they forget?. Run up on you at your granny house, give you 9 like Fif'. How a nigga s'posed to love you niggas?. Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas. Dre told me not to trust you niggas. Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas. Just walkin' 'round the crib like, ""Why a nigga can't live? "". Get this money, fuck these bitches though. Thinkin' 'bout the beef like. ""We can pass these motherfuckin' straps like a physical"". This my city, nigga, everybody know it. Ridin' 'round town, just me and my Four Pound. Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it. L. A. niggas, be the craziest. these niggas do some shady shit. Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard. Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up. [Hook: Drake and Game]. Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit. Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit. Y'all better off realizin'. there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me. All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, 100. L. A. niggas, be the craziest, yeah, 100. L. A. , all I ever asked is 100. L. A. , L. A. niggas, be the craziest, yeah, 100. All I ever asked is 100. [Verse 2: Drake]. Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'. Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors. To every single fuckin' function. Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family. And how they love me. while they was skimmin' off the budget. Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny. People been reachin' out to me. And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit. I would have so many friends. If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments. I would have so many friends. If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments. I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop. And I stayed on some conscious shit. I would have so many more friends. If I lost my success and my confidence. I'm in the club every time that they play the competition. If they even play the competition. and I seen the response they get. Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it on top of the pyramid. Might go to Jamaica, disappear again. My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself. [Hook: Drake and Game]. Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit. Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit. Y'all better off realizin'. there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me. All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, 100. L. A. niggas, be the craziest, yeah, 100. L. A. , all I ever asked is 100. L. A. , L. A. niggas, be the craziest, yeah, 100. All I ever asked is 100. [Verse 3: Game]. Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga. Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga. If he was still alive, he would kill niggas. He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill. Niggas know how it feel. when you missin' your nigga though. Can't think, so you roll up that indigo. Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'. Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn. Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like. ""Here it go"". Screamin' Frog name at the clouds. they don't hear me though. Guess they too busy with 2pac and Biggie though. You niggas don't feel me though. That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch. You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool. but don't come to my city though. Not even to H-Town. So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga. Strapped up from the waist down. That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga. Shit was so simple when Henchman was out. He had a young nigga right there with Meech. So happy when Bleu Davinci got out. We came up on these California streets. L. A. niggas, be the craziest. these niggas do some shady shit. Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard. Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit. Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?. Don't even matter, dog. cause I'm a always be a real nigga. Always be a real nigga. I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga. [Hook: Drake and Game]. Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit. Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit. Y'all better off realizin'. there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me. All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, 100. L. A. niggas, be the craziest, yeah, 100. L.

hate it or love it,"[50 Cent]. Ya, let's take em back. Uh huh. Comin up I was confused my momma kissin a girl. Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world. Daddy ain't around probably out commitin felonies. My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody. I wanna live good, so should I sell dope for a fo-finger ring. Money and them gold ropes. Santa told me if I pass could get a sheep skin coat. If I can move a few packs and get the hat, now that'd be dope. Tossed and turned in my sleep at night. Woke up the next morning niggas done stole my bike. Different day same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood. I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could. [Chorus (50 then Game):]. Hate it or love it the underdog's on top. And I'm gonna shine homely until my heart stop. Go head' envy me. I'm raps MVP. And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me. Hate it or love it the underdog's on top. And I'm gonna shine homely until my heart stop. Go head' envy me. I'm raps MVP. And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me. [Game]. On the grill of my lowrider. Guns on both sides right above the gold wires. I'll fo-five em. Kill a nigga on my song but really do it. Thats the true meaning of a ~ghostwriter~. 10 g'z will take ya daughter out of Air Forces. Believe you me homie i know all bout losses. I'm from Compton where the wrong colors be cautious. One phone call will have ya body dumped in Marcy. I stay strapped like car seats. Been bangin since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkley's. That's 10 years I told Pooh in 95' I'd kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95s. Told Banks when i met him imma ride. And if I gotta die rather homicide. I ain't have 50 Cent when my Grandmomma died. Now i'm goin back to Cali with my Jacob on. See how time fly?. [Chorus - 50 Cent]. From the beginnin to the end. Losers lose, winners win. This is real we ain't got to pretend. The cold world that we in. Is full of pressure and pain. Enough of me nigga now listen to Game. [Game]. Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench. Now i'm fuckin with ~5-0~ it's all startin to make ~sense~. My moms happy she ain't gotta pay the rent. And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz. Waitin on Sha Money to land sittin in the Range. Thinkin how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes. When there's kids starvin. Pac is gone and Brendas still throwin babies in the garbage. I wanna know what's goin on like i hear Marvin. No school books they use that wood to build coffins. Whenever I'm in the booth and i get exhausted. I think what if Marie Banker got that abortion. I love ya Ma'.

The Game is back, the Aftermath chain is gone,. The D's is chrome, the frame is black.. (So watch it lift up). Till the motherfucker bounce and break,. And knock both of the screws out the licence plate.. Let the games begin,. These other rap niggas so far behind me, go taste my rims,. Shit, let the chronic burn as the datens spin.. It ain't been this much drama since I first heard Eminem,. In the club, poppin' X pills like M & Ms,. Call it Dre day, we celebratin', bitch bring a friend.. Bottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round,. And put that cheap-ass hypnotic down.. (Put your 'cris up!). If you feel the same way,. Who got 'em hittin' switches NY to LA. [Hook]. (Got the whole world in the club). Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back,. (I turn it into a strip-club). Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass,. (Get the whole world in the club). Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch. (Pop bottles and twist up). Roll up chronic and hash,. In a blunt, call it Aftermath. [Verse 2]. Somebody tell me where the drinks at,. Where the bitches at,. You fucking on the first night, meet me in the back.. I got a pound of chronic, and a gang of freaks,. Move bitch! Who the fuck you think they came to see?. The protégé of the D R E,. You take a picture with him, and you gotta fuck me,. And you gotta fuck Busta, can't touch Eve,. Got something in my waist that you can't touch either,. That's - my gangsta bitch, and like Crips and Bloods,. I'm in the club on some gangsta shit.. (So nigga twist up). Light another dub,. Bitches get scared when niggas start fighting in the club.. Ain't nothing but a g-thing, baby it's a g-thing,. Bounce like you got hydraulics in your g-string,. I fuck a different bitch seven days a week,. Hit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat.. [Hook]. (Got the whole world in the club). Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back,. (I turn it into a strip-club). Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass,. (Get the whole world in the club). Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch. (Pop bottles and twist up). Roll up chronic and hash,. In a blunt, call it Aftermath. [Verse 3]. Who thought I weren't coming back?. Look at me now,. Hoppin' out the same Cherry six-fo' with the motherfucking top down,. I'm The Game, nigga. Call your bitch, she ain't home, she with Game, nigga. Remember that, Dre. You passed me the torch, I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray,. Ridin' three-wheel motion 'till the ass scrapes,. Turn sunset into a motherfucking drag-race.. Now watch it bounce,. Hit the switch, let it bounce till the police shut the shit down.. {When you hit the club). Tell 'em you came with me,. (We gonna twist up). In the V.I.P.. It's a new day, and if you ever knew Dre,. Motherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre.. Same Impala, different spokes. Same chronic, just a different smoke.. [Hook]. (Got the whole world in the club). Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back,. (I turn it into a strip-club). Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass,. (Get the whole world in the club).

dreams,"""Dreams"". [Verse 1]. I woke up out dat coma, 2000 and 1. Bout the same time Dre dropped 2000 and 1. Three years later the album is done. Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude Volume 1. Rap critics politicin. Wanna know the outcome!. Ready to die, Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one. I feel like Pac, after the Snoop Dogg trial was done. Dre behind the G-Series and All Eyez On Me. I watched the death of a dynasty!. So I told Vibe Magazine. Workin' with Dr.Dre was a ""DREAM!"". I had visions of makin' a classic. Then my wall turned black,like I was starin outa Stevie Wonders glasses. It's kinda hard to imagine,like Kanye West. Comin back from a fatal accident, to beat makin' and rappin'. But, we da future. Whitney Houston told me that, it's gon take mo' than a bullet in a heart to hold me back. [Hook]. Blushin' in this 40 ounce. Lettin the ink from my pen bleed. Cuz Marthin Luther King had a ""DREAM!"". Aaliyah had a ""DREAM!"". Left Eye had a ""DREAM!"". So I reached out to Kanye and ""brough you all my dreeam!"". [Sample playin ""It's cuz I love you!""]. [Verse 2]. I had dreams of fuckin' an R'n'B bitch like Mya. When I saw dat ass on a front of that King. Read the article in a magazine. She loved gangsters, loved nasty things. So I'm the glass house havin' nasty dreams!. Good girls neva' give it up. But anything gets possible ,if 50 fucked Vivica. Heard of life's obstacles,found my way through the maze. Then joy turned to pain like, Frankie Beverly and Maze. Used to dream about bein' Unsigned Hype. Till I was crushed my Dave Mase, almost let my pen fall asleep on a page. Daydreamin' yesterday. Dozin' on offback stage. I tought I saw Eazy talkin' to Jam Master Jay. So I walked over heard Jam Master say. It's a hardknock life, then you pass away. They say sleep is the cousin' of death. So my eyes wide open cuz a dream is kin to ya last breath. [Hook]. Blushin' in this 40 ounce. Lettin' the ink from my pen bleed. Cuz Marthin Luther King had a ""DREAM!"". Aalyah had a ""DREAM!"". Left Eye had a ""DREAM!"". So I reached out to Kanye and ""brought you all my dream!"". [Sample playin ""It's cuz I love you!""]. [Verse 3]. The Dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through. The Dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you!. Who walk through the Whithouse without a business suit?. Compton had Jerry Curl drippin' on Ronald Reagens shoes. Gave Mike Lim my demo came here to pay my dues. Started of with Whoo Kid then I started blazin' Clue. It was all a Dream like BIG said it be. Don't sleep on me homie I bring nightmarers to reality. Rap Phenomenon defyin' the rulez of gravity. Studied all the classic start revisin my strategy. Cuz Marshall Mathers made it. Curtis Jackson made it. Head in the clouds wonderin where the hell Marvin Gaye went?. How do I say this, I'm livin' for my son but I can't figure, why I'm at my temple with this gun. Wake up to a Jesus Piece like a Cathlic Nun. The War to be a rap legend has just begun. [Hook]. Blushin' in this 40 ounce. Lettin' the ink from my pen bleed. Cuz Marthin Luther King had a ""DREAM!"". Aalyah had a ""DREAM!"". Left Eye had a ""DREAM!"". So I reached out to Kanye and ""you are my dreeam!"". [Sample playin ""It's cuz I love you!""]"

Whole gang in the front in case a nigga wanna, stunt. [Verse Ii - 50 Cent]. I put Lamborghini doors on that Es-ca-lade. Low pro so look like I'm riding on blades. In one year mang, a nigga's so paid. I have a straight bitch in the telly goin both ways (Ah!). Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me. I give it to ya just how you like it, girl. You know I'm rockin with the best tre pound on my hip. Teflon on my chest. They say I'm no good. Cuz I'm so hood. Rich folks do not want me around. Cuz shit might pop off, and if shit pop off. Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out. They call me new money, say I have no class. I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast. The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash. Bougie ass bitches, you can kiss my ass. [Hook]. [Verse Iii - Game]. I put gold Daytonas on that Cherry Six-Four. White walls so clean it's like I'm ridin on bulbs. Hit one switch mang, that ass so low.

200 bars and running,"[The Game talking]. What the fuck is all this noise?. He from Cali he can't rap. He ain't better than this nigga. That's my favorite artist. Fuck y'all hear the breakdown. [Verse 1: The Game]. No detox I'm comfortable dog. Like the solo Reeboks right up under me dog. And it feel like I done it before. Sit in the throne pollutin the airwaves like a hummer exhaust. Don't let Makavelli fool you homey thuggin it costs. Pour out a little liquor for the loved ones that we lost. You ain't gotta wait for the album I don't fuck with The Source. But I turn up my Eazy-E and let it bump in the Porsche. I mean turn up my B.I.G. and let it bump in the Porsche. Tell 'em to roll red carpet when he come in New York. Hip-hop police on me think they runnin New York. Till I lace my and1 show 'em how to run in New York. They tryin to take me downtown put me under the court. Cuz Joe Buddens told 'em I carry a gun New York. And homey that's strictly fact he got ripped on wax. So he snitched just to get me back. No matter what you say dog your shit be whack. You better watch what you say it might get you clapped. Here's a little advice homey switch your raps. Cuz that shit on your last album ain't get you plat's. What nigga you need a gun? I'll get you that. P-89 nigga let Dre stitch you back. ??? Industry niggaz I'll admit to that. But I don't even want your chain I'll let the Crips do that. 12 bars for that bitch he won't live through that. Even a nigga with a ten-year bid knew that. Put a gun in his mouth yeah, yeah do that. He a pussy (sniff, sniff) his own kid knew that. I'm +Ready To Die+ B.I.G knew that. He ain't eatin look at his white tee you could see his ribs through that. You cocksucker let your ears do that. Or ride later do me ooh wee now back to rap. 2 Lincoln continentals sittin back to back. Leavin Jersey City naw nigga Hackensack. Where's that somewhere where the crackers at. Real far from where the roaches and rats is at. Come to Compton I'll show you where the racquet's at. Down the street from the staples centers where they hack-a-shack. Give the advance money back I am not have to rap. Break Harry-O out tell him crack is back. That's nine five a bird take half of that. Import it, export it in cracker jacks. When you get to the projects ask for Black. You know what you started with give him half of that. He gon give you 50 g's in a plastic sack. And i'mma gives you 3500 cash for that. Gotta keep your mouth closed or i'mma blast the Mack. They won't believe you the whole world know that bastard rap. Once you outta the throne you can't have it back. Retirement home and ain't nothing after that. Except you layin in a casket black. Suit on you can't go to heaven with timberland boots on. No subliminals I ain't talkin to you Shawn. I'm talkin to that heartless mouse with no jewels on. Who the fuck put you on. Faggot ass nigga let men toss his salad like croutons. I fuck with Fab get my DJ Clue on. Sit inside Hot 97 with no tools on. And it don't matter is it's Sway or KaySlay. Angie Martinez I'll take 'em back to k-day. They act like they forgot about Dre-day. I don't rap for Free that's why they fired AJ. It's me leaking through your stereo. Envy me is a emcee prepare for your burial. I kill niggaz without lettin the Desert blow. Razor tongue and I'm far from Haitian son. All black like the range rover wheels. niggaz whisper around The Game like The Game won't kill. Let me show you the stars take you back to the car. Rewind time march 3, 1994. I was only in my teen's deuce-deuce in my Levi's. When Nas hit the scene I was still rockin knee-highs. Runnin with my brother phase he was seventeen. Two guns in the upper waist so we hit the block. Saw niggaz from a rival gang bumpin Dre. Ran up on the '64 and that's all she wrote. We runnin through the alley like Bishop chasin ? Ass. First murder and I did that without a mask. Fast-forward see Game gettin out a Jag. Two peeps shoot on he still got his rag. Gangbangin forever he still got his swag. Let me catch you in Los Angeles without a pass. Everybody in New York know that you a fag. Come out the closet show the world how to use a pad. Speakin death on my red bandana. Naw he couldn't have said that so I raised my antennas. Look at my Nextel got a call from Santana. That nigga a pussy we just saw him in Atlanta. So I hopped on the first thing smokin to Atlanta. Pulled up at 112 ran up on that black phantom. Security hopped out no Joe in here. Just Outkast gettin ready for a show in here. So I uncocked the .44 hopped in the cherry 'lo-lo. Chrome grill with the G-Unit logo. We watched Hov go now the world waitin for my solo. I'm the man Stat Quo know. I ain't gotta explain even Bo know. Have of these rap niggaz is faker than rolls gold. Get hit in the face with the back of the .44. And pissed on tryin to play The Game with a broke nose. My bitch harder than you yeah Vita loco. I haven't sold one record got rap in a chokehold. I'm Dre certified like the leader of the band. Run up you sure to die I'll leave you where you stand. Smurf-ette runnin around New York like he the man. But he peed in his pants. When he saw us at Summer Jam. Lucky I wasn't there I had to bury my man. Or I would've terrorized New York like the Son Of Sam. What you mean terrorize New York?. I mean expose these pussy ass niggaz like I'm Too Short. Somebody tell Domination I'll leave 'em in parts. leg in Jersey, arm in Brooklyn, head buried in Central Park. He can't walk through New York no more like john Storch. Gotta call cuz i'mma break his ankles like Hot-Sauce. Ask niggaz from your hood I'm thorough like 5 boroughs. Sit on any stoop ? In the thermo. Wait till Alpo come home. Like AZ from Harlem Dre gon pay me regardless. Cuz he know Jay-Z departed. And these other rap labels know don't feed they artists. Talkin blueprint shit you got three garages. Gettin money off Roc like little E and carter. Showin off your little chain like these is flawless. Send him 50 cent a day I can see he starvin. I got R&B bitches givin me ménage's. Deep massages I could hear Eazy talkin. Tellin me to have a seat in Tamika's office. Buy Ruthless and get Lil' E involved in. Promote without that magazine in Boston. Take a couple mil make Beans a offer. Give him money we don't see that often. But it was all a dream like I seen Memph Bleek in Marcy. I ain't say you won't see Bleek in Marcy. I said my said he won't see Bleek in Marcy. I'm from Compton where niggaz used to bleed for barklies. Drive lo-lo's and we ain't need keys to start 'em. Just a little information for your summer vacation. Bring your chain cuz every nigga in L.A. waitin. Mad cuz Detroit beat the shit out the Lakers. And they'll kill you cuz Joe can't find Gary Payton. Meanwhile the throne vacant and Da Band ain't makin it. Shyne got a new deal, Def Jam gotta pay us. Ray Roy Jones got knocked out shortly after they weighed him in. niggaz got beef with G-Unit but ain't sayin shit. Quiet as a church on Tuesdays. Niggaz say they hate my music but my alerts only two ways. Nigga I'm a hazard like Michael Jackson in khakis. Touch kids but I do that with a semi-automatic. With or without traffic I pull my shit out and blast it. I'm blind to the masses like Stevie wonder without glasses. I'm a savage spit murder like a .38 Magnum. 16 bars of baggum let the hook toe tag 'em. Murder any MC throw 'em in that white wagon. Let him die and come back look at 'em he white flaggin. Spreadin rumors like when I see Game I might jack 'em. I'm tellin the world he reach for my chain I might clap 'em. Cuz niggaz shot me in 2001. Took one in the heart cuz I was too proud to run. The clip was empty when the police found my gun. So I don't bring that gangbangin shit around my son. Nigga 50 took 9 he know how it feel. And I found out Buck got shot up in CaShville. And Sha Money told me Lloyd Banks got hit. And Yayo just came home G-G-G-Unit. Backstage at a D-12 concert. A fan asked me how it feel to be walkin in Snoop's converse. Niggaz show me love when they see me in the streets. But they frown when I don't wanna hear none of they beats. Nigga this shit crazy. Em said some shit when was 16 now they tryin to warn Slim Shady. I forgive him I got problems of my own. How you think the streets gon' act know that Suge home. These niggaz is birds I can see the feathers on 'em. If Doc give me the word I put this Berretta on him. When the beef is on my piece is on. Them white sheets is on 'em Doc breathin on 'em. And I got an extra clip in my Reeboks. Cuz I'm in and out my socks every time I see cops. Game got the streets locked call 9-1-1. Get the whole fuckin LAPD shot. Niggaz snitchin to the street cops. Get your nephews and your niece shot. With my heat cocked in the beach stop. Nigga witta attitude like a heard Dr. Dre doin Detox. Niggaz fightin for the throne that ain't shit. Tryin to measure the fallin legends but the shoe won't fit. Niggaz might think I'm ridin dick. Cuz I let the cemetery puttin creases in my G-Unit's. Tryin to talk Jesus Christ into lettin me dig 'em up. So they could stand side by side again and live it up. This might be the last time you hear me biggin 'em up. With suicidal thoughts bangin me and my bitch in the truck. My conscience tellin me if I put the clip in the buck. It might be loud enough to wake B.I.G and them up. What if that was P. Diddy sittin in the truck. And 2Pac was in jail the day you called to hit him up. I wouldn't be outside 40/40 bumpin 'Jigga What'. Wouldn't be sign to Dr. Dre I wonder is its luck. They got me on MTV with Banks, Fifth, and Buck. I ain't tryin to be L.A.'s king he carry a pimp cup. [The Game talking]. Snoop Dogg got the crown nigga. What the fuck y'all mad at me for. I ain't sold one fuckin record. I'm just tryin to use these 200 bars to feed my family nigga. I ain't no threat. I can't rap I'm from Compton remember. You gotta be out your motherfuckin mind. Ask KaySlay, ask Clue, ask Whoo Kid, ask Funk Flex. I'll murder anyone of you motherfuckin. G-G-G-G-Unit. Ah!"
300 bars & runnin’,"[INTRO]. My mama took me to Sam Goody's. I wanted to buy a 50 Cent CD. I took that shit home. That shit was wack like a muthafucka. Don't fuck with Game. I like 50 Cent. He reminds me Spongebob. And Tony Yayo is Blues Clues. And Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer. They're my friends. Psyche. I went down one of them Bodaga shits right there in Harlem. Got me a bootleg Lloyd Banks and Young Buck CD. Took that shit home, put it in my boom box. Thought I was bout to be on some radio Raheim shit. Man that shit sound like some Vanessa Williams '88. I mean Olivia cute but they say that bitch a man. So this Black Wallstreet for life now. GGG-UNOT!. [GAME]. 300 Bars and Runnin. Just loan me your ears for 15 minutes. Walk with me. Here the breakdown, pass the doja, .45 in the holster. Hollow tips'll fold 'em, them *****z they toy soldiers. Oh, that boy colder than Hova unless he sober. Like I'm the president, but this ain't the takeover. Now, there's the speaker, bring your ears a little closer. Before you call this a diss, and you make Hova pissed. Why would I wanna do that? When I'm just the new cat. That was taught if a ***** take shots to shoot back. Defending his yard, yeah standing his ground. I'm saying if you gonna retire, then hand me the crown. Nah, let Bleek do it, then throw him a concert in Madison square. Watch everybody sleep through it. We can go bar for bar, I'll let the lines speak to 'em. What they say? Bleek is over let Chris and Neef do it. They say the wrong thing, I'ma smack 'em silly. What you thought? Them was the only *****z that rapped in Philly?. See them *****z with the soonies leave you wrapped in Philly. Then dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly. ??? said Curtis Jack in Philly. Make a U-turn, I gotta go back to Philly. I forgot my cheese stake, that's what I told the cops. So they wouldn't get the dogs start searching for the glock. And I can't forget, B.I.G. got murdered by the cops. Even I was Ready To Die, when I heard that he was shot. What's beef? Beef is when I murk you on the spot. Labels signing many things, still searching for they Pac. I put purple on the block. So I don't feel threatened when Ludacris say he coming for the #1 spot. Ask 50, it get lonely on top. You can hate me or love me, but now the cops the only homies he got. When it's beef we eat, we win, but we ain't lonely we pop. You sell records but a GGG-u not!. Acting big on the radio, to me you not. You can ask Mr. CCC who hot. Tony Yayo I bet 10 G's you flop. Run up on that new 300 C you got. Stop hoping I fall, hope the bleeding stop. And I hope you black out before you see the cops. I ain't hot top for colors, I'm from Cedar Block. So I got my hot tops that make your breathing stop. I'm a gangsta slash rapper, check your CD shop. I'm like Elvis in there, they can't believe you dropped. Now I'm moving on up to George and Weezy's spot. I picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped. I saw the west coast, put the shit on my back. Sprayed Aftermath on it, then loosened the strap. It get hot in here, let Lucifer rap. Bring hell to *****z when Dre producing a track. Take it to the streets, put the duece duece to your hat. Then call up the pigs, tell them the rooster's back. Call Jadakiss, tell him that duke is back. I'm still by your side, no matter who comes strapped. Fuck Lloyd Banks, it ain't about who can rap. It's about when the ??? clap, is rufus back. I see what you thinkin, you want me to die, is that so?. Now you left leaning back, thanks to Fat Joe. We got reservations in heaven, you ready? Let's go. Drop them off, then the sound like Esko. I'm a say ??? if me and Dre talk. All Nas said back was he had a ???. Now that's the eulogy, beef is kinda foolish see. *****z running their mouth about what the fuck they gon' do to me. But quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping. And you gon' see the captain with plans of getting me captured. Even behind bars, I'm still gon' shine. I'm 10 years younger than Yayo, I get out, I'm fine. Then I go right back, ***** I pop mines. How you gon' drop Olivia, you only drop dimes. I knew you changed, when you started sleeping in that vest dog. I don't need 50 Cent, my *****z make collect calls. 1-800-split a faggot ***** wig. He got G-Unit wings, throw them off the Queens Bridge. Now your career is over, career is over. We in QB, banging CNN in the rover. T-O-N-Y, that's the phony NORE. You ain't the talk of New York, your sixteens is boring. Take that shit off ???, go back to PC. And tell 50 Cent you want a copy of Beef 3. I'm airing their ass out on DVD. You wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks repeat after me. I'm a G-Unit toy soldier. On Sesame street doing voice overs. Bitch ass ***** need a rhyme dictionary, to rehearse his lines. Sound like Oscar the Grouch, with them nursery rhymes. We was in the studio, when I first got signed. He got stuck, he called 50 tryna borrow some lines. That's the wrong *****, when you need help with your rhymes. All he gon' tell you is say G-Unit one more time. Got mad cuz I ain't wanna make your beef mine. You got lucky with Ja, why you aint go at Shyne?. He freestyled from the pen, that's just the fact. Said he'd put you with your mom, and you ain't fucked with that. Then you lied about your pops, he ain't never bust no cap. Like Father, Like Son, go ask Busta that. I knew from the beginning I couldn't trust those cats. I'd kill 'em all, if I could bring Justo back. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. I said. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. And I'm far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it. Do whatever to it, but it in the store the shit moving. Gave 'em a hundred bars, they ain't think I could do it. Came with two hundred, ***** this is more than music. Even Dre knew it, that boy hot like summer. Both ??? in the dirt, 300 Bars and Runnin. And I beef with any *****, say my name muthafuck I'm gunnin'. You can put it on skee if you want it. I'll air you out on Drama King, Mike, or Clue. And watch them shits sell out like a Air Jordon shoe. I told Funk Flex when I catch the ***** Whoo Kid. We gon' see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs. Don't hit me on the sidekick asking what you did. Get a gun or ask 50's police to use his. Cuz Bloods gonna get ya. Bloods, Bloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain. That 380 spill brains, when I pop shots. Outside NY, in front of hip-hop cops. Or broad day in L.A., I'ma tell Em and Dre. This ***** bootlegging my music, ain't nothing for him to say. Took me off my own songs, then put it on his tapes. So I'ma take him out his house, put the beam on his face. Drop him off at Terror Squad, let him scream for the jakes. Cuz when you fucking with Jayceon, you can bleed in the lake. For caking off *****z on them CD's and tapes. Ask them to scratch a record, you will see he fake. If 50 was Puffy, you'd run and go get him a cheese cake. Take the DJ off your name, Mr. Instant replay. Not the instant replay. I mean the machine that G-Unit use every time 50 on stage singing like. Bitches only for your shit just a lil bit. *****z only for your shit just a lil bit. On my album 50 helped me just a lil bit. Only on two songs, now back to some killer shit. My clips bananas, I kill a gorilla quick. Beating on your chest, I see to your death, yep. Tell Ecko to make him a suit. Tell Reebock to make him some boots. Get him a head band, to cover the holes in his head. He a dead man for thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman. Banks blacked out and let the gun blam without a M-E-T-H-O-D Man. So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings. Take my advice, never wear air max for the ???. Unless you one of the Bloods, or a latin king. Cuz if your left with the Aryans your ass will sting. And your cell mate is a 25 to lifer. They will stab you then ??? then fuck you on Rikers. And Life Goes On. Now back to the coward of the hour who lied and said he write my songs. He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf. So he gave me all his hits, you should've kept them for yourself. ***** stop acting tough before I stand over you. Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre. Make a move I'm blasting your ass to the last one. Ten shots from the Mack empty the rest in the passenger. Fase yelling thats enough, let the coroner bag him up. Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum. Gun smoking, Fase think I'm locin' backing up. Reverse the '05 hurse on 41st and traffic, what. Hip-Hop cops on my left, but I pass 'em up. The Dodge got a hemmy in it, Game got a Remy in 'em. In and out of lanes like a New York cab. I'm Mr. Ol' King, that New York cab. Who's this fake *****, on pictures with the Jake *****?. Got his crew starving cuz he aint the whole cake, *****. He ain't Nas, ain't B.I.G., ain't Jigga. If he ain't Cube or Pac then who you got?. We getting tired of you talkin about who you shot. I'll use another six bars to tell you who you not. You ain't 50 Cent, he went out like a gangsta. You went out with Vivica, three months after wanksta. Get Rich or Die Tryin, we thought you was hot. Now the same ***** wanna take us to the Candy Shop. C'mon man, what happened to the thug?. Now you could find in the club, him and Lloyd Banks hugging. ***** got mad when The Game start buzzing. So fuck making friends now I'm into throwing slugs. Olivia talking about we a family, Game had to go. ***** I'll smack that ho like I'm Jackie-O. Cuz I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be you. I don't wanna shake hands, or wear your G-Unit shoes. Don't want you on my hooks, don't wanna be in your group. Just wanna sit here and wait. To be gone, so I can head back to the block. Fresh white Nike airs and the matching socks fitted. Pull the brim low, if they don't get it. Bentley Coup on gold daytons, I was the first one with it. Four times platinum, I done been there and did it. Came in the game and shitted, then wiped my ass with it. They say the Lord givth, if Lord take it away. So I build a house on top of Hip-Hop, I'll wait for the day. *****z hating on me, they don't want Jayceon to play. And the DA waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake. So they can put me in the SWAT car and lock me away. Give me a odd job in the pen for minimum pay. Let me out so I can drive down criminal way. Pushing the rock, nah this ain't no subliminal Jay. The summer too hot, and I want the winter to stay. Cuz I'm a cold ***** when I put the pen to the page. Similar to them shells going into my gauge. I hand 'em off to Dre, he turned them into granades. And Just Blaze, cuz the boy got game. Like I close my eyes, and woke up in a Roc chain. Now back to reality, my gun and my vest. And if diamonds are forever, then I'm Kanye West. Take a look at my chest, a hundred thou wet jacob. Whole crew got chains, a hundred thou can't break 'em. And the flow is hot like that wit Satan. And the only thing I got spinning is Daytons. The hotter I get the more willing to snake 'em. So soon as the beat drop, watch where I take 'em. Compton Swap meet, to get me some All-Stars. When Game in the house, they call ???. Cuz they heard about what went on in D.C.. Heard about Hot 97, my beef with 50. Now tell me do he got a conscience?. I think not, cuz if he did I wouldn't be involved in this nonsense. Wouldn't be in Harlem, wouldn't be at this conference. I'd rather be pushing rock, like ???. 50 whispered in my ear, like we still bonding. We ain't friends, I'm just acting like Charles Bronson. Middle finger in the air, one hand on my Johnson. Hip-Hop police on me like I'm the convict. What happened to the old school? I thought it was rhyming. Doug E. Fresh and Dana Day on the corner like Common. Now that ain't common, it's more like Top Ramen. The flow is news, I throw it up like vomit. And I still shine like diamonds. They kicked me out of G-Unit and I rebounded like Rodman. It's still Aftermath, two feet in the pentition. I be mad, I ain't, I'm supposed to stop I can't because. I'm in the hood politican, Impala ???. And I keep a black .45 on the side of my prada denim. Chip on my shoulder like I'm fresh outta prison. Dollar vision, blow a hundred thou like my wallet missing. Then re-up like kid before the d-cup. Continuously getting money with my feet up. Chasing the throne, here my black Air Force. I said fuck Benzino and got the cover of The Source. Feel me? If not then I guess you gotta kill me. But you ain't gon' do that so muthafucka move back. While I do B.I.G. and 'Pac impersonations on two tracks. When I wake the dead, everybody remove hats. We miss ya'll, can I get a hand clap?. Now back to rap, why I gotta stay strapped?. On that murder T-I-P, kill you ASAP. They won't know which hole to patch up, when the ??? clap. I tried to spare you Young Buck, now it's time for payback. It go, how you from Cashville but you ain't got no cash *****?. Say my name now that's your fucking ass *****. Kept your mouth shut and I gave you a pass *****. Now I gotta lay you down like the last *****. Buck, buck, buck from my AK-47. This ***** playing with his life, I might have to put him in heaven. Tryna play the game, talking shit up on the stereo. Prepare for burial, it's when I'm reincarnating Harry-O. And you don't want that David cuz you love your life. Get my Vibe, when it's war he pull out butter knifes. Muthafucka I'ma show you who the gangsta. All you do is Murder Inc., now who the wanksta?. When Suge had you, you were stranded on Tha Row. Juve left you for dead and went back to the NO. 50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow. Then he made you temporary replacement for Yayo. You a bitch, and that's hard to swallow. And you got robbed for your spinning G-Unit chain in Chicago. I call my ***** Jojo to get it back. He had the shit in his hands, and you ain't had the ten stacks. Picture that, I thought we was G-Unit. Then you ran and told 50 that I did that shit. Ask C-Murder, the boy ain't hard to find. I told Monica when I catch him The Boy is Mine. Take one shot of Brandy and pop. Watch his panties drop, when I run inside the Candy Shop. Fuck you, 50, Banks, Yayo, and the cops. And Olivia, I mean for a man she hot. Now I'm running out of breath, like I just beat boxed. Got 20 bars to go, lay it down like sheet rock. Don't worry about the flow, the boy know he hot. Hurricanes in store November, ***** fuck Reebocks. I'm fly like a Hummingbird on a tree top. The new Hov, the new B.I.G., the new 'Pac, I need three spots. 280 in, ain't no getting me back. I'm yelling fuck the world, on my victory lap. Remember first it was Buddens, then it was Bleek. Now it's whoever muthafucka, yeah, who want beef?. Now whenever muthafucka, who wanna see me?. In the coffin, body exhausted, resting in peace. You don't want war *****, you want peace. So give 'em the peace, capiche (sp?). Let 'em rest in peace. From west to east the flow is outdatable, irreplacable. Lyrical homicide, hell is hot, I'm boxing with Satan. And I slipped 'em the ace, you cannot replace 'em. If Eazy ever decide to return, I remain Jayceon. A king in the making, and the throne is for the taking. So I climb the mountain top and put my stake in. Got the weight of the world on my shoulder.

it's okay (one blood),"[Intro]. Dre, I see dead people. Yo Dre, thought I was dead. West Coast. [Verse 1]. I'm the doctor's advocate, nigga Dre shot cha. Brought me back from the dead, that's why they call him the Doctor. The Math gonna drop him and 50 ain't rockin. With him no more, It's okay, I get it poppin. Whole club rockin like a 6-4 Impala. Drink Cris', throw it up, call the shit hydraulics. Then piss in a cup, call the shit Hypnotiq. I bleed Compton, spit crack and shit Chronic. And you new niggaz ain't shit but new niggaz. Bathing Ape shoe niggaz, I'm talking to you niggaz. Bounce in the 6-4, throwing up Westside man. Sell another five million albums, Yes I am. Fresh like damn, this nigga did it again. A hundred thousand on his neck, La above the brim. Inside the lambo, shotgun with snoop. What would the motherfuckin' west coast be without one crip and. [Chorus]. One blood {*4x*}. Blood {*9x*}. One blood {*4x*}. [Verse 2]. I'm from the west side of the 6-4 Impala. Where niggaz say where you from, we don't ever say holla. Bandana on the right side, gun on the left side. Niggaz in New York know how to throw up the west side. Word to Eazy, I'm so ill, believe me. I made room for Jeezy, but the rest of you niggaz. Better be glad you breathin, All I need is one reason. I'm the king and Dre said it, the west coast need me. I don't know why you niggaz keep tryin me. Everybody know that I'm the aire to the Aftermath dynasty. And I ain't gotta make shit for the club. What Dj gonna turn down a 38 snub. You 38 and you still rappin? Ugh. I'm 26 nigga, so is the doves. In the '07 Hummer, hop out, nobody dodge. When the chronic smoke clear, all you gonna hear is. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. I ain't got beef with 50, no beef with Jay. What's beef when you getting head in the 6-Tre. And the double game chains, I keep 'em on display. Black t-shirt so all you see is the A. Turn on the Tv and all you see is the A. You niggaz better make up a dance and try and get radio play. Keep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away. I don't regret what I spit cause I know what I say. And niggaz talking bout me, they don't know when to stop. I got the Louis Vuiton beltbuckle holding the glock. No bean, no silencer, I know when to pop. Wait til Lil' Jon come on and let off a shot. I had the number 1 billboard spot. Niggaz stepped on my fingers and I climbed right back to the top. I'm Big, I'm Cube, I'm Nas, I'm Pac. This ain't shit but a warning until my album drops. [Chorus] - 2x"

we ain't (feat. eminem),"[The Game]. Hahahaha, ladies and gentleman. You are now about to witness the strength, Aftermath. Straight out the mothafuckin' streets of Compton. Put your hands together for Game bitch! Hahahaha. [Eminem]. Yeah mothafuckas. Compton's back on the mothafuckin' map. Aftermath in that ass bitch!. Game, let's go. [The Game]. Me and Marshall ain't start shit, they listen to our shit. and talk shit about us, but that shit is foul. when I'm tryin' to feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums. Make my mother proud that her son made it out. But it's hard when they hate us, and think Em a racist. They say shit, but fuck them, Shady one of the greatest. Like Biggie and Pac was, we started throat was empty. and decided to chase it, me him and 50 racin'. This rap shit is basic, I followed that Jay shit. Think of what I wanna say, step in the booth in one take and. How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits. Then spit that classical LA, N.W.A. shit. The media is bullshit, now we can't even say ""bitch"". They accusin' Michael of touchin' kids in the wrong places. At first they embraced him, had a couple of face lifts. Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists. They comin' I can taste this swear to God I ain't racin'. Put the clip in and wast 'em before I go out on that fake shit. I'm so sick and tired of this black shit, this white shit. So I sit here and write shit, Em they ain't gon' like this. So they callin' us. CHORUS. (We ain't, goin', nowhere, so fuck you). (We ain't, goin', nowhere, so fuck you). [Eminem] This day, The Game, will never be the same. [Dr. Dre] Things just ain't the same for gangsters. [Eminem] The Game just isn't the same, it's changin'. It's a new Game! You're now about to witness the power. [Eminem]. Only Dre can, judge me for the mistakes I'm makin'. If I'm fakin', I'm Clay Aiken. You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame, you're tame. Bitch, your mind's lost, you ain't ready to make that flame switch. You'll end up in the same situation, same shit. Different day, just with different gangstas in your face. Which way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement. Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it. For the day that they got them affidavits wavin' in my face. Lookin' for answers, rap sensation. Eminem battles to ward off, accusations. That he had somebody blasted. The mask of Jason was found at the scene of the task with masking tape. And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case. And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wastin' too much time. Me no kiss ass, and if that's the case, then we ain't goin'.... Chorus. [The Game]. Lo get Dre on the phone quick. Tell him Em just killed me on my own shit. I'm walkin' through 8 Mile, startin' to get home sick. I'ma do Shady numbers, I'm ridin' my own dick. Yeah the chrome sick, the window's tinted. If Eminem is in it, body armor under the panel. Ten these niggaz is killin' it, take a minute to listen. Turn down my Jimmy Hendrix, I'll throw your demo out the window. For tellin' me it's hot when it's not and you got what you got. From them rocks on the block, you can stop tellin' Dre you got shot. with a glock that don't phase me, I'm crazy. Why the fuck you think I'm rhymin' wit' Shady. I don't care if the radio don't play me. I say what I say when I feel like I'm feelin' today. And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets. I can't even take my son to cop them G Unit sneaks. So I'm gone bitch. Chorus. [Eminem]. Yeahhhhhhhhhh! Oh!. G shit homie. Can't do nothin' but respect. So shut yo' ass up, Aftermath motherfucker. Haha, Game, Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, G Unit!. G-G-G-G-G-Unit!"
my life,"[Intro]. *breathing*. *dog barking*. *gun shot and glass break*. [The Game]. Punk ass mothaf**ka, get your ass up. What chu was goin do? kill me in my sleep you bitch ass nigga?. Tupac, Biggie! shut the f**k up! f**king dogs barking and shit. [Punk Ass Motherf**ker]. Don’t shoot!. Don’t shoot!. *gun shot*. [The Game]. F**k You Nigga!. . [Chorus: Lil' Wayne]. And I’m grindin’ til I’m tired. They say ""You ain’t grindin’ til you tired"". So I’m grindin’ with my eyes wide. Looking to find. A way. Through the day. A life. For the night. Dear Lord, you’ve done took so many of my people but I’m just wonderin’ why. You haven’t taken (my life? x3). Like what the hell am I (doing right? x3). (My Life x3). [Verse 1: The Game]. Take me away from the hood like a state penitentiary. Take me away from the hood in the casket or a Bentley. Take me away. Like I overdosed on cocaine. Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain. Suicide (Suicide..suicide..). I'm from a Windy City, like ""Do or Die"". From a block close to where Biggie was crucified. That was Brooklyn's Jesus. Shot for no f**kin' reason. And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces? (My Life x3). 'Cause that's Jesus people. And The Game, he's the equal. Hated on so much, ""The Passion of Christ"" need a sequel. Yeah, like Roc-a-fella needed Sigel. Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle (My Life x3). I need some meditation, so I can leave my people. They askin' “Why?"" Why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?. And why every hood nigga feed off evil?. Answer my question before this bullet leave this Desert Eagle. [Chorus: Lil' Wayne]. And I’m grindin’ til I’m tired. They say ""You ain’t grindin’ til you tired"". So I’m grindin’ with my eyes wide. Looking to find. A way. Through the day. A life. For the night. Dear Lord, you’ve done took so many of my people but I’m just wonderin’ why. You haven’t taken (my life? x3). Like what the hell am I (doing right? x3). (My Life x3). [Verse 2: The Game]. We are not the same, I am a Martian. So approach my Phantom doors with caution (caution...caution). You see them 24's spinnin'? I earned them. And all the pictures of me and Em, I burned them. So there ain't no proof that I ever walked through 8 Mile. And since there ain't no Proof, I never walked through 8 Mile. Sometimes I think about my life with my face down. Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile (My Life x3). Damn, I know his momma's proud. And since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my momma now. And like MJB, ""No More Drama"" now. Livin’ the +good life+, me and Common on common ground. I spit crack and niggas could drive it outta town. Gotta Chris Paul mind state, I'm never outta bounds. My life used to be empty like a glock without a round. Now my life full, like a chopper with a thousand rounds (Gunshots). [Chorus: Lil' Wayne]. And I’m grindin’ 'til I’m tired. They say ""You ain’t grindin’ 'til you tired"". So I’m grindin’ with my eyes wide. Looking to find. A way. Through the day. A life. For the night. Dear Lord you’ve done took so many of my people but I’m just wonderin’ why. You haven’t taken (my life? x3). Like what the hell am I (doing right? x3). (My Life x3). [Verse 3: The Game]. Walk through the gates of Hell, see my Impala parked in front. The high beams on, me and the Devil share chronic blunts. Listening to the ""Chronic"" album, playing backwards. Shootin’ at pictures of Don Imus for target practice. My mind f**ked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood. I'm from the city that made you motherf**kers afraid of Suge (Compton... Compton...). Made my grandmother pray for good. And never made her happy, when I bet that new Mercedes could (My Life x3). Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood. They took so many of my niggas, that I should hate the hood. But it's real niggas like me, that make the hood. Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should (My Life x3). With the top back. In my Sox hat. I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that. Even if they brought the nigga 'Pac back. I'd still keep this motherf**ker cocked back. [Chorus: Lil' Wayne]. And I’m grindin’ til I’m tired. They say ""You ain’t grindin’ til you tired"". So I’m grindin’ with my eyes wide. Looking to find. A way. Through the day. A life. For the night. Dear Lord you’ve done took so many of my people but I’m just wonderin’ why. You haven’t taken (my life x3). Like what the hell am I (doing right? x3). (My Life x3). (My Life x3). (My Life x3).

Got signed to Dr.Dre cause his bars is sick. Getting head on the road, cause his cars is sick. And he whop so good, I had to pause this shit. I told 'em bomp, slow down baby. Got to get this shit firm like Foxy, NaS and AZ. She said 'f**k you,pay me. So I left her in AZ. That's what I get for letting her listen to my Jay-Z. F**k a bitch, give me a 40, I'll take that. Dress up for the grammy's, but I still don't drive maybach's. Nigga I'm gangster, and homey don't play dat. Stand way back, or get ya ass clapped ASAP. Nigga this the payback, you want beef.. say that. I'll have a hundred hurricane hoodies where you lay at. Get yo whole clique wet, making up crip sets. Nigga got ran outta New York by Dipset. Then he got ran out of Compton by my set. Banned from Watts, can't even walk through his projects. Nigga so lame, talking he gangbang. Won't bust a shot, and the nigga know where I hang. I'm Big Daddy Kane, and the platinum chain. The fact remains, the game don't rap for fame. Game rap for fun, Game blast his gun. the game gotta rap in tongue, so that bastards done. Be easy, I might give you a pass this once. I'm ready to die, but I don't want a bastard son. Nigga, I rap too good, and I'm back in the hood. On the same couch, I put my demo in a package for Sug. After one meeting, I was right back in the hood. Red bandana hanging, selling crack in the hood. Now it's, Aftermath for good.... Any nigga mention Dre, get a Desert Eagle shoved in his f**king face. How that taste?. Blow yo shit out fa'real, Nigga im for real. Call Nelly or Paul Wall, tell 'em make you a grill. I cook beef, like a steak on a grill. Got the clipse on hold, but I ain't Pharrell. Nigga I'm fa'real.. my flow ill, like smoke in ya lungs. I Spit sharp like a razorblade under my tongue. Nigga, I'm number one, motherfukka bar none. Who else kick knowlegde outside of Hova and the God Son. We can go bar for bar, cocksucker drop some(tm). Watch me Take Flight like Tom Cruise in The Top Gun. You might win some, but you just lost one. I beat on these lil nigga's like Dr. Dre drums. Look at these motherfukka's trying to prove theyselves. Thinking beefing wit hurricane going to boost they sales. Never that, motherfukka, I'm a clever cat. Kanye West in slacks, nigga, I'm as fresh as that. Ask Dre, ask Snoop, I'm nice. I'm Cube, I'm Jacob, I put rappers on ""Ice"". A skee , let me ask you a question. If you take the 120 bars, put it with the 240 bars. Then add the 360 bars, wit one Kevin Federline, what you get?. (A Million) Haha.. lets get the f**k outta here man... Go find something to do"

the game get live,"You can catch five, or catch me in the CL-5. Whatever way dog, the Game get live. Keepin it gangsta in a P.D. fitted velour. Late night I'm in Dublin's and I got myself a four. The hood love me, hoodrats gotta hug me. Pop ex, spark the buba, the shit get ugly. Rock the mic anywhere, and I ain't talkin 'bout a concert dog. Talkin 'bout ten niggaz in converts dog. Get it crackin like we out in the yard, and the warden's watchin. Only difference is the whores is watchin. Still love to see a nigga, roll up on 20's. Hop in that six-four, roll up on Bentley's like. I'm a gangsta bay-bee from the C-P-T. Run with the +Pound+ like I'm from DPG. If it's beef, you C-Murder like it ain't No Limit. And I represent the P like Russell Simmons. [Chorus: repeat 2X]. I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right. Got it? Good, okay. It's the Black Sox and Get Low we get dough.

Ralways, the Ojays, the gangsta lean so. Please believe that I keep two G's in my jeans. Two gats in my sleeve, two rats in my Beam'. X-5, mami let's ride. Weave in and out of traffic from Compton to Bed-Stuy. It's the kid from the far West I, oh, shit. He know how to do more than flip pies. Get money like them stick up guys. Them ""Ocean 11"" licks got the young kid rich for life. And I talkin 'bout a movie or George Clooney. I'm talkin 'bout, runnin in your spots with uzis tucked in the Coogi. Dude me? Naw truly, might lose your lives. They say I've, got 2K2 covered like A.I.. [Chorus]. [JT]. I know ya, love to watch me, 'specially when I'm lookin rocky. The trey with the broccoli with my handles on the Kawasaki. Handle my jewels with the cuff in my shoes. AD jacket on my elbow, 50 coast the jewels. In my neighborhood I'm Young Bill Gates, never shuffle the cake. So cover my face, and run up in the place. I'm a superstar, dick and my chain, glass bezel and bang. 80 karats on my pinky and rang. Crews buzz when you speakin my name, cause I'm deep in the game. With top cool thangs and million dollar planes. I'm a maniac, young boy gone, like a young Roy Jones. You ought of my zone and ain't nobody home. In my neighborhood, produce stars, stakes is high. Now we soarin through the spacious skies. Drop yo' body with them cakes and ride, the handle is up. Switchin gears with the pedal and ride. [Chorus]"

She get them birds past, I put her in first class. And tell her to carry on that Duni & Burke bag. She from Grape Street, she know how to work the mag. And only buy white tees, tell 'em to keep the purple tags. Cause the laces in my Chucks keep the beef crackin. I lay niggaz out like creased khakis. In that G-wagon, lean like the 23's draggin.

Retirement home and ain't nothing after that. Except you layin in a casket black. Suit on you can't go to heaven with timberland boots on. No subliminals I ain't talkin to you Shawn. I'm talkin to that heartless mouse with no jewels on. Who the fuck put you on. Faggot ass nigga let men toss his salad like croutons. I fuck with Fab get my DJ Clue on. Sit inside Hot 97 with no tools on. And it don't matter is it's Sway or KaySlay. Angie Martinez I'll take 'em back to k-day. They act like they forgot about Dre-day. I don't rap for Free that's why they fired AJ. It's me leaking through your stereo. Envy me is a emcee prepare for your burial. I kill niggaz without lettin the Desert blow. Razor tongue and I'm far from Haitian son. All black like the range rover wheels. niggaz whisper around The Game like The Game won't kill. Let me show you the stars take you back to the car. Rewind time march 3, 1994. I was only in my teen's deuce-deuce in my Levi's. When Nas hit the scene I was still rockin knee-highs. Runnin with my brother phase he was seventeen. Two guns in the upper waist so we hit the block. Saw niggaz from a rival gang bumpin Dre. Ran up on the '64 and that's all she wrote. We runnin through the alley like Bishop chasin ? Ass. First murder and I did that without a mask. Fast-forward see Game gettin out a Jag. Two peeps shoot on he still got his rag. Gangbangin forever he still got his swag. Let me catch you in Los Angeles without a pass. Everybody in New York know that you a fag. Come out the closet show the world how to use a pad. Speakin death on my red bandana. Naw he couldn't have said that so I raised my antennas. Look at my Nextel got a call from Santana. That nigga a pussy we just saw him in Atlanta. So I hopped on the first thing smokin to Atlanta. Pulled up at 112 ran up on that black phantom. Security hopped out no Joe in here. Just Outkast gettin ready for a show in here. So I uncocked the .44 hopped in the cherry 'lo-lo. Chrome grill with the G-Unit logo. We watched Hov go now the world waitin for my solo. I'm the man Stat Quo know. I ain't gotta explain even Bo know. Have of these rap niggaz is faker than rolls gold. Get hit in the face with the back of the .44. And pissed on tryin to play The Game with a broke nose. My bitch harder than you yeah Vita loco. I haven't sold one record got rap in a chokehold. I'm Dre certified like the leader of the band. Run up you sure to die I'll leave you where you stand. Smurf-ette runnin around New York like he the man. But he peed in his pants. When he saw us at Summer Jam. Lucky I wasn't there I had to bury my man. Or I would've terrorized New York like the Son Of Sam. What you mean terrorize New York?. I mean expose these pussy ass niggaz like I'm Too Short. Somebody tell Domination I'll leave 'em in parts. leg in Jersey, arm in Brooklyn, head buried in Central Park. He can't walk through New York no more like john Storch. Gotta call cuz i'mma break his ankles like Hot-Sauce. Ask niggaz from your hood I'm thorough like 5 boroughs. Sit on any stoop ? In the thermo. Wait till Alpo come home. Like AZ from Harlem Dre gon pay me regardless. Cuz he know Jay-Z departed. And these other rap labels know don't feed they artists. Talkin blueprint shit you got three garages. Gettin money off Roc like little E and carter. Showin off your little chain like these is flawless. Send him 50 cent a day I can see he starvin. I got R&B bitches givin me ménage's. Deep massages I could hear Eazy talkin. Tellin me to have a seat in Tamika's office. Buy Ruthless and get Lil' E involved in. Promote without that magazine in Boston. Take a couple mil make Beans a offer. Give him money we don't see that often. But it was all a dream like I seen Memph Bleek in Marcy. I ain't say you won't see Bleek in Marcy. I said my said he won't see Bleek in Marcy. I'm from Compton where niggaz used to bleed for barklies. Drive lo-lo's and we ain't need keys to start 'em. Just a little information for your summer vacation. Bring your chain cuz every nigga in L.A. waitin. Mad cuz Detroit beat the shit out the Lakers. And they'll kill you cuz Joe can't find Gary Payton. Meanwhile the throne vacant and Da Band ain't makin it. Shyne got a new deal, Def Jam gotta pay us. Ray Roy Jones got knocked out shortly after they weighed him in. niggaz got beef with G-Unit but ain't sayin shit. Quiet as a church on Tuesdays. Niggaz say they hate my music but my alerts only two ways. Nigga I'm a hazard like Michael Jackson in khakis. Touch kids but I do that with a semi-automatic. With or without traffic I pull my shit out and blast it. I'm blind to the masses like Stevie wonder without glasses. I'm a savage spit murder like a .38 Magnum. 16 bars of baggum let the hook toe tag 'em. Murder any MC throw 'em in that white wagon. Let him die and come back look at 'em he white flaggin. Spreadin rumors like when I see Game I might jack 'em. I'm tellin the world he reach for my chain I might clap 'em. Cuz niggaz shot me in 2001. Took one in the heart cuz I was too proud to run. The clip was empty when the police found my gun. So I don't bring that gangbangin shit around my son. Nigga 50 took 9 he know how it feel. And I found out Buck got shot up in CaShville. And Sha Money told me Lloyd Banks got hit. And Yayo just came home G-G-G-Unit. Backstage at a D-12 concert. A fan asked me how it feel to be walkin in Snoop's converse. Niggaz show me love when they see me in the streets. But they frown when I don't wanna hear none of they beats. Nigga this shit crazy. Em said some shit when was 16 now they tryin to warn Slim Shady. I forgive him I got problems of my own. How you think the streets gon' act know that Suge home. These niggaz is birds I can see the feathers on 'em. If Doc give me the word I put this Berretta on him. When the beef is on my piece is on. Them white sheets is on 'em Doc breathin on 'em. And I got an extra clip in my Reeboks. Cuz I'm in and out my socks every time I see cops. Game got the streets locked call 9-1-1. Get the whole fuckin LAPD shot. Niggaz snitchin to the street cops. Get your nephews and your niece shot. With my heat cocked in the beach stop. Nigga witta attitude like a heard Dr. Dre doin Detox. Niggaz fightin for the throne that ain't shit. Tryin to measure the fallin legends but the shoe won't fit. Niggaz might think I'm ridin dick. Cuz I let the cemetery puttin creases in my G-Unit's. Tryin to talk Jesus Christ into lettin me dig 'em up. So they could stand side by side again and live it up. This might be the last time you hear me biggin 'em up. With suicidal thoughts bangin me and my bitch in the truck. My conscience tellin me if I put the clip in the buck. It might be loud enough to wake B.I.G and them up. What if that was P. Diddy sittin in the truck. And 2Pac was in jail the day you called to hit him up. I wouldn't be outside 40/40 bumpin 'Jigga What'. Wouldn't be sign to Dr. Dre I wonder is its luck. They got me on MTV with Banks, Fifth, and Buck. I ain't tryin to be L.A.'s king he carry a pimp cup. [The Game talking]. Snoop Dogg got the crown nigga. What the fuck y'all mad at me for. I ain't sold one fuckin record. I'm just tryin to use these 200 bars to feed my family nigga. I ain't no threat. I can't rap I'm from Compton remember. You gotta be out your motherfuckin mind. Ask KaySlay, ask Clue, ask Whoo Kid, ask Funk Flex. I'll murder anyone of you motherfuckin. G-G-G-G-Unit. Ah!"
300 bars & runnin’,"[INTRO]. My mama took me to Sam Goody's. I wanted to buy a 50 Cent CD. I took that shit home. That shit was wack like a muthafucka. Don't fuck with Game. I like 50 Cent. He reminds me Spongebob. And Tony Yayo is Blues Clues. And Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer. They're my friends. Psyche. I went down one of them Bodaga shits right there in Harlem. Got me a bootleg Lloyd Banks and Young Buck CD. Took that shit home, put it in my boom box. Thought I was bout to be on some radio Raheim shit. Man that shit sound like some Vanessa Williams '88. I mean Olivia cute but they say that bitch a man. So this Black Wallstreet for life now. GGG-UNOT!. [GAME]. 300 Bars and Runnin. Just loan me your ears for 15 minutes. Walk with me. Here the breakdown, pass the doja, .45 in the holster. Hollow tips'll fold 'em, them *****z they toy soldiers. Oh, that boy colder than Hova unless he sober. Like I'm the president, but this ain't the takeover. Now, there's the speaker, bring your ears a little closer. Before you call this a diss, and you make Hova pissed. Why would I wanna do that? When I'm just the new cat. That was taught if a ***** take shots to shoot back. Defending his yard, yeah standing his ground. I'm saying if you gonna retire, then hand me the crown. Nah, let Bleek do it, then throw him a concert in Madison square. Watch everybody sleep through it. We can go bar for bar, I'll let the lines speak to 'em. What they say? Bleek is over let Chris and Neef do it. They say the wrong thing, I'ma smack 'em silly. What you thought? Them was the only *****z that rapped in Philly?. See them *****z with the soonies leave you wrapped in Philly. Then dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly. ??? said Curtis Jack in Philly. Make a U-turn, I gotta go back to Philly. I forgot my cheese stake, that's what I told the cops. So they wouldn't get the dogs start searching for the glock. And I can't forget, B.I.G. got murdered by the cops. Even I was Ready To Die, when I heard that he was shot. What's beef? Beef is when I murk you on the spot. Labels signing many things, still searching for they Pac. I put purple on the block. So I don't feel threatened when Ludacris say he coming for the #1 spot. Ask 50, it get lonely on top. You can hate me or love me, but now the cops the only homies he got. When it's beef we eat, we win, but we ain't lonely we pop. You sell records but a GGG-u not!. Acting big on the radio, to me you not. You can ask Mr. CCC who hot. Tony Yayo I bet 10 G's you flop. Run up on that new 300 C you got. Stop hoping I fall, hope the bleeding stop. And I hope you black out before you see the cops. I ain't hot top for colors, I'm from Cedar Block. So I got my hot tops that make your breathing stop. I'm a gangsta slash rapper, check your CD shop. I'm like Elvis in there, they can't believe you dropped. Now I'm moving on up to George and Weezy's spot. I picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped. I saw the west coast, put the shit on my back. Sprayed Aftermath on it, then loosened the strap. It get hot in here, let Lucifer rap. Bring hell to *****z when Dre producing a track. Take it to the streets, put the duece duece to your hat. Then call up the pigs, tell them the rooster's back. Call Jadakiss, tell him that duke is back. I'm still by your side, no matter who comes strapped. Fuck Lloyd Banks, it ain't about who can rap. It's about when the ??? clap, is rufus back. I see what you thinkin, you want me to die, is that so?. Now you left leaning back, thanks to Fat Joe. We got reservations in heaven, you ready? Let's go. Drop them off, then the sound like Esko. I'm a say ??? if me and Dre talk. All Nas said back was he had a ???. Now that's the eulogy, beef is kinda foolish see. *****z running their mouth about what the fuck they gon' do to me. But quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping. And you gon' see the captain with plans of getting me captured. Even behind bars, I'm still gon' shine. I'm 10 years younger than Yayo, I get out, I'm fine. Then I go right back, ***** I pop mines. How you gon' drop Olivia, you only drop dimes. I knew you changed, when you started sleeping in that vest dog. I don't need 50 Cent, my *****z make collect calls. 1-800-split a faggot ***** wig. He got G-Unit wings, throw them off the Queens Bridge. Now your career is over, career is over. We in QB, banging CNN in the rover. T-O-N-Y, that's the phony NORE. You ain't the talk of New York, your sixteens is boring. Take that shit off ???, go back to PC. And tell 50 Cent you want a copy of Beef 3. I'm airing their ass out on DVD. You wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks repeat after me. I'm a G-Unit toy soldier. On Sesame street doing voice overs. Bitch ass ***** need a rhyme dictionary, to rehearse his lines. Sound like Oscar the Grouch, with them nursery rhymes. We was in the studio, when I first got signed. He got stuck, he called 50 tryna borrow some lines. That's the wrong *****, when you need help with your rhymes. All he gon' tell you is say G-Unit one more time. Got mad cuz I ain't wanna make your beef mine. You got lucky with Ja, why you aint go at Shyne?. He freestyled from the pen, that's just the fact. Said he'd put you with your mom, and you ain't fucked with that. Then you lied about your pops, he ain't never bust no cap. Like Father, Like Son, go ask Busta that. I knew from the beginning I couldn't trust those cats. I'd kill 'em all, if I could bring Justo back. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. I said. The underground is mine, I treat it like home. It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones. And I'm far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it. Do whatever to it, but it in the store the shit moving. Gave 'em a hundred bars, they ain't think I could do it. Came with two hundred, ***** this is more than music. Even Dre knew it, that boy hot like summer. Both ??? in the dirt, 300 Bars and Runnin. And I beef with any *****, say my name muthafuck I'm gunnin'. You can put it on skee if you want it. I'll air you out on Drama King, Mike, or Clue. And watch them shits sell out like a Air Jordon shoe. I told Funk Flex when I catch the ***** Whoo Kid. We gon' see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs. Don't hit me on the sidekick asking what you did. Get a gun or ask 50's police to use his. Cuz Bloods gonna get ya. Bloods, Bloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain. That 380 spill brains, when I pop shots. Outside NY, in front of hip-hop cops. Or broad day in L.A., I'ma tell Em and Dre. This ***** bootlegging my music, ain't nothing for him to say. Took me off my own songs, then put it on his tapes. So I'ma take him out his house, put the beam on his face. Drop him off at Terror Squad, let him scream for the jakes. Cuz when you fucking with Jayceon, you can bleed in the lake. For caking off *****z on them CD's and tapes. Ask them to scratch a record, you will see he fake. If 50 was Puffy, you'd run and go get him a cheese cake. Take the DJ off your name, Mr. Instant replay. Not the instant replay. I mean the machine that G-Unit use every time 50 on stage singing like. Bitches only for your shit just a lil bit. *****z only for your shit just a lil bit. On my album 50 helped me just a lil bit. Only on two songs, now back to some killer shit. My clips bananas, I kill a gorilla quick. Beating on your chest, I see to your death, yep. Tell Ecko to make him a suit. Tell Reebock to make him some boots. Get him a head band, to cover the holes in his head. He a dead man for thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman. Banks blacked out and let the gun blam without a M-E-T-H-O-D Man. So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings. Take my advice, never wear air max for the ???. Unless you one of the Bloods, or a latin king. Cuz if your left with the Aryans your ass will sting. And your cell mate is a 25 to lifer. They will stab you then ??? then fuck you on Rikers. And Life Goes On. Now back to the coward of the hour who lied and said he write my songs. He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf. So he gave me all his hits, you should've kept them for yourself. ***** stop acting tough before I stand over you. Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre. Make a move I'm blasting your ass to the last one. Ten shots from the Mack empty the rest in the passenger. Fase yelling thats enough, let the coroner bag him up. Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum. Gun smoking, Fase think I'm locin' backing up. Reverse the '05 hurse on 41st and traffic, what. Hip-Hop cops on my left, but I pass 'em up. The Dodge got a hemmy in it, Game got a Remy in 'em. In and out of lanes like a New York cab. I'm Mr. Ol' King, that New York cab. Who's this fake *****, on pictures with the Jake *****?. Got his crew starving cuz he aint the whole cake, *****. He ain't Nas, ain't B.I.G., ain't Jigga. If he ain't Cube or Pac then who you got?. We getting tired of you talkin about who you shot. I'll use another six bars to tell you who you not. You ain't 50 Cent, he went out like a gangsta. You went out with Vivica, three months after wanksta. Get Rich or Die Tryin, we thought you was hot. Now the same ***** wanna take us to the Candy Shop. C'mon man, what happened to the thug?. Now you could find in the club, him and Lloyd Banks hugging. ***** got mad when The Game start buzzing. So fuck making friends now I'm into throwing slugs. Olivia talking about we a family, Game had to go. ***** I'll smack that ho like I'm Jackie-O. Cuz I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be you. I don't wanna shake hands, or wear your G-Unit shoes. Don't want you on my hooks, don't wanna be in your group. Just wanna sit here and wait. To be gone, so I can head back to the block. Fresh white Nike airs and the matching socks fitted. Pull the brim low, if they don't get it. Bentley Coup on gold daytons, I was the first one with it. Four times platinum, I done been there and did it. Came in the game and shitted, then wiped my ass with it. They say the Lord givth, if Lord take it away. So I build a house on top of Hip-Hop, I'll wait for the day. *****z hating on me, they don't want Jayceon to play. And the DA waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake. So they can put me in the SWAT car and lock me away. Give me a odd job in the pen for minimum pay. Let me out so I can drive down criminal way. Pushing the rock, nah this ain't no subliminal Jay. The summer too hot, and I want the winter to stay. Cuz I'm a cold ***** when I put the pen to the page. Similar to them shells going into my gauge. I hand 'em off to Dre, he turned them into granades. And Just Blaze, cuz the boy got game. Like I close my eyes, and woke up in a Roc chain. Now back to reality, my gun and my vest. And if diamonds are forever, then I'm Kanye West. Take a look at my chest, a hundred thou wet jacob. Whole crew got chains, a hundred thou can't break 'em. And the flow is hot like that wit Satan. And the only thing I got spinning is Daytons. The hotter I get the more willing to snake 'em. So soon as the beat drop, watch where I take 'em. Compton Swap meet, to get me some All-Stars. When Game in the house, they call ???. Cuz they heard about what went on in D.C.. Heard about Hot 97, my beef with 50. Now tell me do he got a conscience?. I think not, cuz if he did I wouldn't be involved in this nonsense. Wouldn't be in Harlem, wouldn't be at this conference. I'd rather be pushing rock, like ???. 50 whispered in my ear, like we still bonding. We ain't friends, I'm just acting like Charles Bronson. Middle finger in the air, one hand on my Johnson. Hip-Hop police on me like I'm the convict. What happened to the old school? I thought it was rhyming. Doug E. Fresh and Dana Day on the corner like Common. Now that ain't common, it's more like Top Ramen. The flow is news, I throw it up like vomit. And I still shine like diamonds. They kicked me out of G-Unit and I rebounded like Rodman. It's still Aftermath, two feet in the pentition. I be mad, I ain't, I'm supposed to stop I can't because. I'm in the hood politican, Impala ???. And I keep a black .45 on the side of my prada denim. Chip on my shoulder like I'm fresh outta prison. Dollar vision, blow a hundred thou like my wallet missing. Then re-up like kid before the d-cup. Continuously getting money with my feet up. Chasing the throne, here my black Air Force. I said fuck Benzino and got the cover of The Source. Feel me? If not then I guess you gotta kill me. But you ain't gon' do that so muthafucka move back. While I do B.I.G. and 'Pac impersonations on two tracks. When I wake the dead, everybody remove hats. We miss ya'll, can I get a hand clap?. Now back to rap, why I gotta stay strapped?. On that murder T-I-P, kill you ASAP. They won't know which hole to patch up, when the ??? clap. I tried to spare you Young Buck, now it's time for payback. It go, how you from Cashville but you ain't got no cash *****?. Say my name now that's your fucking ass *****. Kept your mouth shut and I gave you a pass *****. Now I gotta lay you down like the last *****. Buck, buck, buck from my AK-47. This ***** playing with his life, I might have to put him in heaven. Tryna play the game, talking shit up on the stereo. Prepare for burial, it's when I'm reincarnating Harry-O. And you don't want that David cuz you love your life. Get my Vibe, when it's war he pull out butter knifes. Muthafucka I'ma show you who the gangsta. All you do is Murder Inc., now who the wanksta?. When Suge had you, you were stranded on Tha Row. Juve left you for dead and went back to the NO. 50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow. Then he made you temporary replacement for Yayo. You a bitch, and that's hard to swallow. And you got robbed for your spinning G-Unit chain in Chicago. I call my ***** Jojo to get it back. He had the shit in his hands, and you ain't had the ten stacks. Picture that, I thought we was G-Unit. Then you ran and told 50 that I did that shit. Ask C-Murder, the boy ain't hard to find. I told Monica when I catch him The Boy is Mine. Take one shot of Brandy and pop. Watch his panties drop, when I run inside the Candy Shop. Fuck you, 50, Banks, Yayo, and the cops. And Olivia, I mean for a man she hot. Now I'm running out of breath, like I just beat boxed. Got 20 bars to go, lay it down like sheet rock. Don't worry about the flow, the boy know he hot. Hurricanes in store November, ***** fuck Reebocks. I'm fly like a Hummingbird on a tree top. The new Hov, the new B.I.G., the new 'Pac, I need three spots. 280 in, ain't no getting me back. I'm yelling fuck the world, on my victory lap. Remember first it was Buddens, then it was Bleek. Now it's whoever muthafucka, yeah, who want beef?. Now whenever muthafucka, who wanna see me?. In the coffin, body exhausted, resting in peace. You don't want war *****, you want peace. So give 'em the peace, capiche (sp?). Let 'em rest in peace. From west to east the flow is outdatable, irreplacable. Lyrical homicide, hell is hot, I'm boxing with Satan. And I slipped 'em the ace, you cannot replace 'em. If Eazy ever decide to return, I remain Jayceon. A king in the making, and the throne is for the taking. So I climb the mountain top and put my stake in. Got the weight of the world on my shoulder. Not a ***** nor a hoodrat bitch can stop me from taking it over. This is crack music, go get the baking soda. 300 Bars and Runnin, ***** the wait is over. I'm gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone. *Enviado por ""Sekef"""

All in front of my flat screen, True Religion black jeans. Dancin like Ciara, I ain't Bow Wow or 50. Tryin to get me but I back out, I could blow your back out. Lay you down, put it in the hole, like Stackhouse. We used to hit midtown, throwin all them stacks out. Run through the Louis Vuitton store and clean the racks out. Used to feel good, when I watch your Porsche back out. You bought Keyshia Cole album, now you tryin to act out. Flippin like a Sidekick, tell me what is that 'bout?. You can't take the heat, get the fuck up out of Shaq house. Black out. [Chorus]. [The Game]. Bitch, I'm rollin 21's and over. Not the club, the dubs on that platinum Range Rover. My neck's so iced out, my wrists so shined up. I make hoes line up, see a pole climb up. Brown sugar or light skin, black or white skin. If she could drop it low then she could be my night friend. Or my one night stand, if she got a nice tan. Before I leave I cut the light off of your nightstand. Back to the house, my girl wanna have real sex. Nah, I keep my kids like Britney Spears' ex. Take her back to the future, I ain't even here yet. And that line was fly, bitch I'm a Leer jet. [Chorus]. [The Game]. Stop playin girl, stop playin. Stop playin girl, stop playin!. Stop playin girl, stop playin. I said stop playin, you better stop playin. 'Fore I break you off like a Kit Kat, you know I wanna hit that. Banana split that, but a real nigga had to sit back. Cause that's what we do, when girls be with the chit-chat. Every mornin on ""The View"", them girls be with the chit-chat. Enough with all the riff-raff, let me see your cat walk. I'm old school, Garfield, I can make your cat talk. But I'm a gangsta, so I'ma back off. Keyshia and DMX, I'll leave yo' ass with that thought. For real. [Chorus]. [Outro].

Runnin' across the kitchen floor. Hidin' them baby dolls I sent you from on tour. And I missed you when I was tourin'. Smiling at them baby pictures. So happy, tears pourin'. God, how could something so beautiful come from me. After the gunshots, thought you was done with me.. But I know why I'm livin' now. Why you made me put the guns down,. Pick up the mic, start rappin' for a livin' now. My sun, my moon, my stars, my Earth, my wind, my fire, my life, my baby. Tryin' to make your moms wifey but she crazy. Fussin' me, fightin' me. I know she love me cuz you look just like me. The day you came into this world, I was so excited. Eleven twenty-one double zero. My baby girl is here. (Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.

My girl's moms and I moved out Maui. Yeah yeah Pops gone bananas. See why I win her. Bigger house, wider yard, Navi with the crash bar. Pumpin' her, shifty you stupid. You ain't no dad, nigga. Takin' your black ass to court for all you have nigga. You see me and your moms that's another topic. Ain't no whip in this world with a price that you can't cop it. Stop it. Impress with wine, you didn't hear me right. It's a lesson to this song, I'm trying to steer you right. Just remember your father taught you to go hard or go home. Never sing that sad song. Don't cry. (Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't). (Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't). They ain't gon' preach to you,. I'mma let your mom school you. Don't let the streets fool you. Streets straight through you. That's why I'm talking to you. You see these niggas out here have you stressin' by the hour. Never turn your back on your foes. Them dudes cowards. Some days sweet and some sour. But we gon' make it together. The world is ours and you're my flower. If it's ice, you can get that. Model chicks, hit that. Never stress about the downfall. Just 'bout to get back. And I'm not saying sex is wrong. Just make sure you strap a condom on. And never ever do it in your mother's home. Never call a girl a bitch,. Show respect son. Pop your collar. Ain't nothing free. Scrape the block for every dollar. I'm gonna leave you with this my little angel. Daddy loves you. How I'd die for you, cry for you, ride for you. Switchin' handles like you breakin' the zone. Candy paint and power. On the golden bridge, bouncin' on chrome. (Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't). (Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't)"

Selling that chicken no lemon pepper, no sweet and sour. First you get the power, then you get respect. I'm getting so much money I can buy ya bitch. Take it how you wanna, if you wanna take it. I like clubs where all the women working naked. Fell in love with a waitress what the fuck I'm thinking. Bought that ho a ring it was for her pinky. Uhn, that's pimpin' that's slick.

Run to niggas for help, favors I keep one on the shelf. I got rifles with lasers, swing it just like the majors. Hit you right above navel, now you swimming in pavement. Gold medals on my neck, I call it Michael Phelps. Hoes settling for less, I call 'em bottom shelf. Niggas tough on them blogs and never did nothing at all. On the road to the riches, bitches not tagging along. [Verse 4: Game]. Unless it's ass in a thong, hit that ass and I'm gone. Disrespect my nigga Boss and I'm flashing the chrome.

This the voice of ghetto intelligence, if you got work. Go to work, don't work at your residence. [Verse 6: Game]. ...For presidents. Word to Muhammad, that triple beam is heaven-sent. Riding through the jungles in that muthafuckin' elephant. That's a gray ghost, with the ears on it. Swimming through the hood like it got fins on it (Tell 'em!). You know I got that work on the foreman grill. Weigh the muthafuckas in, made another mill'. Got a nigga feeling like Cassius Clay. Thrilla in Manilla, nigga want it whip his ass today. [Hook]"

True gang shit, fuck with me and you're famous. Kanye'd my bitch, now she's away from the nameless. Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger. Jesus piece on the plate, yea my baby an angel. Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into. Who knew we'd grew into, whatever we into. That's too much for your mental so we snapback that. Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc backpack. My ladybug, yea she cool like that. In them Trues, why you move like that. [Hook: Jeremih]. You know my lady always on. She know I need it so.

""Oh, Hell no! "". When you hop on top, girl, that's what it feel like. She always had a player back like them field lights. And every time I left it ain't feel right. Cheated on her and she stayed, that's just real life. Cause it's hard when you ain't on the same coast. Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast. Hoes try and wave but we ain't on the same boat. They trying to sink everything that we made float. She told me 'bout her ex man, her old boy stories. And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories. Don't fuck her on her period, ain't into horror stories. I take her to my favorite restaurant, she order for me. Cause she know me. [Hook: Jeremih]. [Outro: Fabolous]. I'm feeling your style.

Tryna find the one. But you been looking for love in all the wrong places. Every day's a movie, girl, you make the scene. They gon keep on watching, give em something to see. We gonna be all the way gone. We gonna be all the way gone. [Wale]. She call me all the time, I ain't no regular Joe. I be staying at the Roosevelt more than Marilyn goes. I'm messing bitches with Chuck, but I was wearing some Foams. Shorty been fly forever, these bitch's parachutes broke. TC's is on her person I'm aware that you know. And you know the flow, they jack it, I'm apparently cold, you know. Life's lemons is bitter, I need another fruit. She know we can't elope, look at what honey do. Straight G thing, double M G thing. Weed they can't fuck with, I'm puffin A.C. Green. When I peep in the public, bet I'm leaving with something. And I'm so fly I make some homebodies ?? leave the luggage. Shout out Donny Sublime. Shout out Bobby on Hundreds. Not too many is touching, double M G this summer. The RED album, lil red shortie, you can't touch her. I know Mario's on the hook, but I was playing Duck Hunt. [Hook - Mario]. [Game]. Yeah, he blowing up your cell phone. Send him the voicemail cause we all the way gone. And you ain't doing nothing wrong. But killing the competition in that Cosabella thong. Turn to the side, let me see them thighs. Profile, damn I'm digging your style, we can start slow now. Then speed it up, this playing in the background. While I beat it up - I beat it up... [Mario]. Baby soon as we get home, it won't take us too long. We gon make it to the bedroom, I like the guest room. You can pick the next room. Put the camera on the tripod, got me playing on your iPod. I know you feeling me on my job: Director. [Game]. Cut!"
angel,"[Common]. I spent my day so, first I pray yo. Then I lay low, looking for the halo. Or more yayo, my little angel. Reminded me to stay playful. Faithful walks I take in the woods. Thinking whats good, things that I can't change I should. Things I can't, need to be understood. Th-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood. For a second at least, I'm resurrecting the peace. Pipes that Indians used to like, we called it Chief, right?. Stepping on the leafs right, to reach heights. Th-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen. Some use it for medicine, or to write better things. I was in Amsterdam, man, bike pedaling. To the nature spot, to taste the flavors they got. My eyes drop, I like it a lot. Yeah, an angel. [Chorus]. I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel). Going through the city of the Chi make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels). Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel). She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel). [The Game]. Th-th-the way that I rhyme, blow nigga's mind. Like the first time you heard Mary J and you were standing in line. To purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind. And I'm ridin with Common looking for Chicago Zen. And like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple. Rockin every Jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael. That made me feel like I could fly, sometimes I wanted to die. Prolly cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye. So I start hip-hop and I understand why Common used to love her. She got me open so I even had to fuck her. But I used the rubber, cause she was married to Rakim. So I bought me a gold chain, pretendin' that I was him. So I can get close to the girl I loved the most. But she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost. Big gave her one more chance, and she took Big down. I should've knew it, Shock G and Pac told me ""She get around"", an angel. [Chorus]. I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel). Going through the city of the Chi make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels). Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel). She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel). [The Game]. Fly away, fly away. My love for her is not about jewelry and cars. I love her cause she love me, just for who I are. Who I is, who I am, resembles the rims on the Lam'. I shine like Shyne when Barrington Levy was sayin, ""Didilly whoooa!"". I got love for the streets, peace to New York and every hood in the East. Before I was duckin' cops, gunshots, I used to be an L.A. Dodger, now I'm a (Angel). From the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold. Between the car, and the rims, we got a lot of chrome. Your hood not alone, they knockin, we not at home. And when they bust in, we not Caesar, but got it wrong. Cause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones. The ones they put wires on, they got us on tap. But I put wires on, my Bentley in fact. I spit it through the wires on a Kanye track. [Chorus]. I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel). Going through the city of the Chi make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels). Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel). She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel). [Common]. Yeah, it's The Game and Common. Spread your wings, follow your dreams. Things will be so serene, L.A. and the Chi is a team. Yeah, angel supreme. Yeah, keep on. Yeah, it's for the world boy, we do it forever, yeah"
around the world,"[Foxx] Ohhh-ohhhhh yeah. [Chorus: Jamie Foxx]. I know you're sick and tired of waitin on me girl. But I'm, just tryin to get my money right. So let some dumb nigga take a flight. So I can take you all around the world. Planes, trains, automobiles. Bentley or a Range, chromed-out wheels. First class ticket, G-4, you that deal. For real (I can take you all around the world). [The Game]. She like black Bentley Coupes, black Day-tons. Black interior, black ridin shotgun. Black fo'-five, black Air Ones. Bangin ""The Black Album,"" track #1. She like that Jay shit, that's her favorite. If it's gon' get me the pussy I'ma play that shit. If she bite too hard, I'ma say that shit. But don't bite me bitch, I don't play that shit. Marques Houston, I don't play that shit. By the time we got halfway through watchin ""Ray"" I hit. I laid it down beat it up, let her go clean it up. Take a five minute nap, wake up and eat it, what. The it's part two, in the sauna. Feel like I'm fuckin Mary J. cause she don't want, +No Drama+. I'd rather take yo' ass to the Bahamas. Then give you 30 thousand a month like Diddy baby mama. [Chorus]. [The Game]. Picture me thuggin, picture me lovin you. like Bobby love Whitney now picture me fuckin. Pullin your ponytail smackin you on the ass. Tellin you how (I can take you all around the world). That nigga can't do it like this. Even Beyoncé couldn't move it like this. She only fuck with +Soldiers+, that's her shit. I hate to admit it but I love my bitch. So much, I'm sittin outside in the Benz. Thinkin back to Dre's house when I fucked her best friend. The pussy wasn't nothin; now I'm dealin. with +The Diary of a Mad Black Woman+ with Louis Vuitton luggage. She told me she was tired of The Game and rap. Quit like Ma$e then she came right back. I told you the bitch sex was wack. And you're all I need, even Jamie know that. [Chorus] w/ ad libs. [The Game]. You know what they say, more money more problems more drama. means more marijuana and less baby mama. You know I love you like I love my shoes. But even white Air Force Ones come in twos. Yeah, I like her, and I like you too. What's wrong? She my bitch and you my boo. She got a Range Rover Sport, you got a Bentley Coupe. She take my clothes to the cleaners, you take Harlem to school. I gave you your Burkin bags, so I made a mistake. And Oprah don't fuck with them no more anyway. I'm sorry for the bullshit I put you through. But I ain't goin nowhere, I got a kid wit'chu. Why we always gotta argue about Superhead's book?. She sucked my dick with a condom on, after that I shook. And when she start talkin 'bout buyin a ring. I just turn the volume up and let Jamie Foxx sing. [Chorus] w/ ad libs. [Jamie Foxx]. Around the world with me yeah. Around the world with me, ayy. Around the world with me, hey. Mmm, ohh"

Game and Dogg Pound along side sittin' on dubs. Remember that. [Chorus]. [Kurupt] You got them funny ass colors on, take it off. [Game] If you in the club with ice on we takin' off. [Daz] I thought you was a gangsta nigga, you better shake it off. [Kurupt] What?. [Daz] Sh-Sh-Shake it off, or get banged on. by nbU."
basic bitch,"[Verse 1]. All you bitches is Nicki Minaj, son. So get her a trash bag so she can pick up a one. She bend down, I see her tracks. I make it rain, she throw it back. And all this money keep me in pussy, no cat. Stacks, but I got racks on racks on racks. Poof side at the W, take a puff and relax. This that millionaire lifestyle, audemar iced out. Order more spades then, hit her with that lifestyle. But these fake hoes won't leave me alone. Fake bag, fake ass, and she beggin' for patron. My credit making good, my credit need a loan. And them heels you got on, pound sign. [Hook]. Basic bitch. I gotta bitch with me, she gotta bitch with her. And I ain't talkin' bout no basic bitch. Beyoncé, laced front on. Who you trying to front on, and stunt on?. Basic bitch, she gotta fake Louie. Fake loobies, fake booty. So she a basic bitch. At the club all weekend, she trying to get rich. But all I got is this dick for a basic bitch. [Verse 2]. So knock it off with your knock-off. You give head, then a nigga ride with his top off. You the type I'd knock off, forget I ever met you. Block you on Twitter, never BBM or text you. Lookin' for the next you, I just wanted to sex you. Hit you on the D-Low, I'm Cee-Lo, F You. Cause everytime I'm up in the club looking for hoes. Everything look good off a couple bottles of rose. Downloading your swag, Starting off with your toes. And paintin' a mental picture of you without all your clothes. Have you ever fucked a millionaire in the back of a Rolls rose?. With Amber Rose? I ain't talking 'bout no. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. I can tell by your avatar, you never had caviar. Your friends can't go, you can't go, you don't have a car. But that weave hanging down to your ass. Bitch ain't from Dallas, but she routing for the Mav's. You a bandwagon ho fo sho'. You up in every video takin' off your clothes. I thought I told you that you wouldn't get far. Melyssa Ford gets, (?) child's mad at how Honda Accord is. 2012 Range, now look how times change. You bitches'll never get a ring, LeBron James. Cause I got all the game, used to move Daddy the King. Gettin' dirty money with my lil'. [Hook]"
better days,"[Andre merritt]. Been holding this pain inside for so long. Though the rain never goes away. They say I should leave these streets behind me. But it's so hard to escape,. Oh lord please send me an angel. To lead me out of this place,. Send me a away,. Far away. To better days,. [the game]. The first thing I wanna do is say wat up to TI,. King of the south, now everybody see why,. I'm just driving and thinking how I survived here,. And I ain't seen Dre and Eminem in 5 years,. That sound shady right,. I live a crazy life,. So many black thoughts I had to paint the mercedes. White,. I can tell you about the rims but I ain't here for. That,. Going out like Big and Pac I fear for that,. Take this lambo and put 6 holes in it,. Shatter the glass and leave my body exposed in it,. Lift the doors up and let all my demons out,. And I can see my brother now cos that's what I been Dreaming bout,. I ain't thinking bout b-tches or pulling beemers out,. I'm thinking bout my son safety everytime they leave The house,. I know how to make it out the hood I seen the route,. And here's the proof me venus and serena out,. [chorus]. I'm sitting on these stairs at this church,. Bout to start a verse. And somewhere in the world somebody about to start a Hearse,. Tell me who inside it, whose son is that,. And how he get there, now tell me who gun is that,. I ain't saying confess definitely ain't saying snitch,. But if you kiled the n-gga help his momma dig his. Ditch,. I'm from the hood where n-gga gotta keep their gun. Cocked,. Kids wear Dre beats to stop the sound of gun shots,. But at least they got the Dre beats cos kids in Africa. Ain't even got shoes on they feet,. And I seen it on my own eyes at the same time I. Picking flys off my own eyes,. Can you feel that, if you can hear them buzzing,. You can feel the pain of Mike Tyson and his baby. Mother,. They lost their baby daughter and she was only 3. She never got a chance to blossom on the family tree,. [chorus]. We got a new president and I love that he black,. But Imma ask him like Bush. Where the soldiers at?. Now move the camera to New Orleans where the soldiers At,. The water dried up where n-gga do the nolia clap. We all juveniles we all been through some trials,. And some tribulations, I'm in this booth pacing,. What do I say next, should I talk about some cars. Or the next chapter of my life and show you all my. Scars,. Or my bullet wounds and my stab wounds,. Can?t show you I covered them up with tattoos,. I can?t do nothing but spit the truth,. On probation smoking drink patrone before I hit the Booth,. You making songs for the clubs while n-ggas drinking,. I make em for the ride home when n-ggas thinking,. One minute you here, next minute sh-t is tragic,. And it's a Jim Johnsin track now fill this stack. [chorus]. [end]"

Me and fifty, that beef is dead, him and Mike Jackson gonna take us to the ledge.. [Chorus]. [The Game]. As I’m pouring out this liquor candles start to flicker,. when list (?) my air ones, MJ was my ni-er.. Not the one that play ball, the one with the hollywood star,. and since i’m a hollywood star im gonna tell you my story,. never had a family that close, never see Barry Gordy walking through interscope,. just like me they always had Mike in a scope,. no matter what you say,. i’m gonna love him and he’s still dope,. let me take you back to 85 when i was in a zone, dancing for my momma thriller jacket with all the zippers on,. now i’m doing 90 bout to crash in this Aston,. listening to Outcast, I’m sorry Mrs Jackson. anything i can ever do to better you your son was our king so we wont Corretta you,.

It ain't a nigga in the game that could hold me down. I've been independent forever so they know me now. And I'm the cat they gotta find when they wanna get signed. You wanna get your paper right you gotta study my grind. I'm like Rush in ""Krush Groove,"" a nigga that bust moves. right out, and tuck tools, bullets that bust dudes. Ain't no beef in the briefcase, just beef for Pete's sake. We round up cats, to beat 'em in a street race. We count paper up, to make a nigga change his plans. They under weight so they ain't gettin off they gram. You mad at my boys, cause we choppin 'em in. They make twenty then the Fig want 10. That's the rules that the Get Low, play by. The block boys stay high, California stock with K-5. It's the rules that the Get Low play by. Them block boys stay high, the California K-5. [Chorus: The Game]. Huh, it's the Blacksox doin a joint together. The whole world stoppin to listen, ol' breakers poplockin to this. And white boys headboppin in 6's, niggaz boxin in prison. Shit bang hard like a conjugal visit. And the game ain't big enough for niggaz so move over. Matter fact, move out, we takin over. Them boys is comin, and they aimin straight for the neck. The B-L-A, C-K, S-O-X. [Bluechip]. Yo, yo, well it's the B dot L dot, you know the rest. Wanted by the feds, hated by the ATF. You can catch me at the DuPont Inn, two dykes swallowin gin. Shorty sucked me out of my Timbs. My bad, that's your wife? Fuck your life. Anyway I heard you workin for vice. You ain't real man you hide behind ice. Youse a impostor, snatch him off the roster. Always live by the rule, get dough, or die tryin. Hardcoded into shinin. Pass the bucket now I'm back on bet it. If, beef was erased man my tool gon' finish. Never been the loudmouth type. Sugar Shane of this rap shit, southpaw when the mac spit. Listen rookie, don't make me mad boy. Or you gon' be like Big, a dead +Bad Boy+. [Chorus]. [The Game]. Huh, niggaz think they got the game sewed, yeah right. I'm air tight, fresh in them Air Nikes. If the Navi outside, I might be there. Black hoodie, black 9, black wifey airs. Rock guns like Caddy trunks, keep a spare. You see the lump under the Iceberg fleece and gear. And when the beef cook, I'ma put the piece to your head. And if you see a white truck that mean yo' sheets is dead. Then I'm goin goin, back back. to the block to dump the bucket and jump in the drop. Niggaz know I'm good with the glock, they call me Chick Hearns. Cause if the game on knot, I'm callin the shots. I'll wear a shiny suit for a minute like I'm The LOX. Then get gangster with a swap meet bag and a Jordan box. And when I die, bury me with the glock, and a bucket of shells. In case niggaz want drama in hell. [Chorus]"
bleek is,"[The Game talking]. The young Roy Jones of this rap shit. Somebody bout to get knocked the fucked out tonight man. You better tell your boy somethin, you better tell him somethin. [Verse 1: The Game]. Skip through the blueprint one bang this what's mentioned. Bleek you're one hit away but he didn't know The Game was pitchin. Balls faster than roger Clemens nigga you're too big for your bitches. Two gold albums and I'll make you a hitter. Might make you a little richer but don't forget the big picture. All of those make you a fag but money like Little Richard. Take your faggot ass picture put it next to Gulliany. Run you for your roc-a-wear fit and beat you with the Tommy. Drag your ass down to Alby Square. Call Beans, Jay, Freeway, Biggs, Dame I'll be there. Compton behind me ask Nas queens is with me. You ain't never sold crack in your life I'm takin your fiends with me. My guns smoke like Robert Downey. Two shots and a pound he got a room in Kings County. And you might live or sit in a box. Depending on how long it NYPD to respond to the shot. [Chorus: The Game]. Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek. Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek. [Verse 2: The Game]. See what the problem is too much east coast dick lickin. And everybody tryin to do their best 2pac rendition. Listen they wonder how I live with 5 shots. Niggaz is hard to kill on my block. When you was in the streets comin of age. I was in the streets pumpin the gauge. While you was rappin I was makin it happen. On the block with a k. While you was with the roc on the stage. I had rocks on the stage. On headliner for the front page we know that you front. You be on sunset doin what? Gettin your punk ass stunt. You gon respect us or that fo' rippin through the vests. And you know who you are deaf nigga'll get the message. Malik or M-E-M-P-H Bleek. Fuck around and be a B-I-T-C-H sleek. Cuz all that yappin dude will get guns clappin dude. And stop Memphis from rappin dude, huh. [Chorus: The Game]. Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek. Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek. [Verse 3: The Game]. It took me a little while but I am now understandin. Jay fucked up in the first round when he picked olo with candy. Did olo in the second, nigga take it from me. The Roc get knocked off the bounce till you picked up beans. Add freeway to the team but move the ugly bitch. Trade the Marcy reject for Cam'ron and Lil' Chris. Now the squad 5 is live 6 man is Neef. Fans in the stand yellin out fuck Memphis Bleek. You want beef I have your body parts all over New York. Leg in jersey arm in Brooklyn head buried in central park. You can't even borrow from New York no more like john Storch. And I ain't talkin to him I'm talkin to Malik. And I got a pine box for a nigga like you. Streets is talkin how many real niggaz like you. Hit LAX remember when you come to the coast. Niggaz don't play with they lives when it comes to the toast. [Chorus: The Game]. Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek. Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek"

born & raised in compton (raised as a g),"Aight. Now everybody wanna know the truth about a nigga named Game. I come from the hub and every ghetto ain't the same. A lot of people already know exactly where it's at. Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack [whispered] - Compton. Yeah that's the name of my hometown. I'm goin down, in the town, where my name is all around. And niggaz just be hatin and shit, that's a pity. But I ain't doin nuttin but claimin my city. See my lyrics are double or nothin provin to suckers I can throw 'em. Pass the natural 10 to 4 and six-eight before I go. Not really into freestylin, or tryin to promote violence. But they gotta know about the five-five-fo', so. And that's how I'm livin, I do as I please B. A young gangsta put in work on these Cali streets. And everybody knows that you gotta be stompin. If you're born and raised in Compton. [Chorus]. [quiet scratching:] ""Born and raised in Compton"". [The Game]. Nowww Compton is a place, where all my niggaz chill dog. 'til I found out, the streets get real dog. 'Bout a year ago, somebody musta wanted me to die. Cause they kicked in the door, and gave the young kid five. They musta thought that I was gon' play the bitch role. Cause I lived through fo' five six holes. But I ain't goin out like no faggot-ass clown. They found, they couldn't keep a gangsta nigga down. So here's the burner in your face motherfucker silly sucker. ass clucker now you're duckin cause you can't stop a Y.G.. Gangsta, cause I'm true to my game. You're lame, and thangs ain't gon' never be the same. Cause a nigga like the Game is takin over. I really don't think I should have to explain. Oh yeah I'm a dog but my name ain't Rover. And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain. Sometimes I have to wear a bulletproof vest. Because I got the C-P-T style written across my chest. A gangsta motherfucker never ceasin to impress. My name is young Game so you can fuck, the rest. I'm comin like this and I'm comin directly. Cause niggaz gettin all stirred up, I'm doin damage quite effectively. Rhymin is a battlezone and niggaz can't win. Cause I'm a gangsta from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N"
born in the trap,"[Verse 1]. I was born in the crosshairs without a pot to piss in. Where niggas get smoked over their Jordans and their Pippens. Welcome to California, nah, it ain't cold as New York. But life is a bitch out here: word to Too Short. Wack as a shooter so we called him Tony Kukoc. Gang banging had us addicted like it was Newports. Whoever thought that it would spread like petroleum. Now BP connect got us praying to them holy men. Just had a daughter homie, named her Katrina. If I raise her right, then maybe she can take over FEMA. Spike Lee in New Orleans shooting documentaries. And Game still in Cali eating off The Documentary. Take em to the symmetry I mean the cemetery. Where everybody boxed in: Refrigerator Perry. [Hook]. And everybody little fuck up, they blame it on Barack. Cause he's just like T.I.: Born in the Trap. And everybody little fuck up, they blame it on Barack. Cause he's just like Gucci: Born in the Trap. And everybody little fuck up, they blame it on Barack. Cause he's just like Jeezy: Born in the Trap. And every little fuck up, my gun she go ""crack!"". Cause I'm just like Outkast, born in the Trap. [Verse 2]. So what's going on with you faggots?. And what you gonna do when your swag no longer matters?. And your bitch ain't the baddest cause she in her mid-40s. And your Phantom played out so you hating on the shorties. Cause they running around like they was your age. Fucking bitches raw cause now the world ain't got no AIDS. Yeah, 2050 on these niggas. Golddiggers sucked you dry left hickeys on you niggas. I used to run around like you, run the town like you. Walk my red nose and clown like you. But it got old like Betty White. This rap shit real deep like Barry White. Reminiscing on the days I used to carry white. Walking though them Crip hoods in the Cherry Nikes. Now I live a married life, walking in the house, to them home-cooked meals. Joint American Express accounts and less dollar bills. [Hook]. Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack. Just like Goodie Mob, I was born in the Trap. Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack. But just like Luda, I was born in the Trap. Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack. But like Soulja Boy, I was born in the Trap. Broke ass niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack. Take 'em to Shawty Lo, nigga, learn how to Trap. [Verse 3]. Shit deeper than The Roots band. 15's drumming, ?uestlove in the coupe fam. Riding through Pittsburgh, Wiz got the Steelers. Born by the jungle so I came with gorillas. Since niggas dropping more dimes than we fuckin'. We out the hood, tryna get money like (?). Splitting backboards just to get our weed stuffed in. The crack we cookin, we don't need ovens. We need something to put in the mouth of our kids. Instead of copping chains, lets fly to Chile and dig. Go to Haiti and feed to the Bahamas and breathe. On the way back, to my nigga Sean from Belize, you know. Sometimes I feel like this rap shit is heaven sent. Then I get a high, feel like it's irrelevant. So I'm about to pop the trunk like an elephant. And campaign with Wyclef while he run for president. I'm 'bout to pop the trunk like an elephant. And campaign with Wyclef while he run for president. Told you I was gonna kill this shit, Premo.."

breakfast with al pacino,"The other day I had breakfast with al pacino (politicking). Told him I wish he was in casino (probably checking). Breathe. Fresh out the kitchen with waffles and cappuccino. (hood nigga). Eating breakfast with al pacino was good nigga. Please. My life a movie directed by tarantino. My lambo lounging the kimo. I'm at that fork in the road like a torturous hov. I ain't wanna sell blow, I was forced to that stow. See, I was forced to be hard, without multiple goals. So I multiplied and magnified that coke, till I was satisfied. Took oath in my last supply, I kept my tenants classified. My momma ain't know nah. My daddy and my uncles gave me bundles. Put it on bees I made it bumble. Bred 11's, thou should not stumble. In bed by eleven, that's where. She thought but I'm in a jungle. Sayin no this ain't no training day. I'm on that track, but I put them trains away. And my enemies on this train today. My dreams is where them bangers lay. The sky is where my fingers stay. Unless I bring the k, and choppers making rainy day. Niggas praying to yezus. Remember before he was famous, yeah!. A younger game would say. The other day I had breakfast with al pacino. (politicking). Told him I wish he was in casino. (probably checking). Breathe. Fresh out the kitchen with waffles and cappuccino. (hood nigga). Eating breakfast with al pacino was good nigga. Please. And if you must know, nobody's perfect. We screw up, we make mistakes. Have heart breaks, go through hard times. But you need to know that's life. The world ain't full of assholes. But they strategically play. So that you could come across one every day. You know what I'm saying?. Sometimes things that happen in life are not part of a plan. But when that happens, don't give up on your dreams!. Just find another way to reach em. Just give your food for thought, ladies and gentleman. Worrying won't stop the bad from happening. But it will stop the good from being a joy. Yes sir!"

california dream,"[Verse 1 - Game]. I'm at the house bout to roll this kush up. I can get a call at any minute, so I'm just doing push-ups. Waiting on what seems to be forever. I burned a hole in my Polo sweater cause I was nervous. That's how crazy birth is, loading up this Beretta. Cause this time I'm having a baby girl. So it's whatever, whenever.. whatever. You my willow and it's my will to make this last forever. First thing I'mma tell her? Daddy's your umbrella. Get with a glass slipper Cali, you my Cinderella. Gotta be a dream, hold up, that's your middle name!. Both your brothers big now, so baby you my little Game. Who gon be the Godfather? Swizz? Lil Wayne?. Y'all smoke too much but got Cali tatted on his veins. And I just got a text from your mama. Saying the water burst, I guess it's time for my comma... [Verse 2 - Game]. You walk through the door, she on the ground crying. She don't wanna get up, you had a baby right here. I ain't cleaning that shit up!. I finally got her out the house, now we on the elevator. She screaming, her left the car seat. But I'mma tell her later. Forget the car seat - man - I'm hella-faded. She like ""I know you ain't high!"" Man, I'm celebrating... Now we in the car, she won't put on her seatbelt. Screaming at the top of her lungs: ""I need help!"". Weaving through traffic, minutes between contractions. Close your eyes right now, and you can see it happening. Imagine: she pulling on me ""stop I'm about to crash, shit!"". Butterflies in my stomach, heart beating fast as shit. Every time I have a kid, it's like the first time. Kids the best, but they be coming at the worst times. Now we here, Tiff get in the wheelchair. Butterflies still here - am I happy? Hell yeah!. [Verse 3 - Game]. I parked the car, now I'm running through the halls lost. Trying to figure out which one of these rooms is ours. Think: damn.. one of the nurses stuck her head out. They gave her an epideral so I pulled the couch bed out. Took a nap, woke up, they almost got the head out. She grabbing on the rails, looking like she about to pass out. Told her to breathe, grab my phone and hit record. ""Breathe! 1, 2, 3, 4 - one more - 1, 2, 3, 4"". Push! C'mon Tea, push! God damn it, just push!"". Nurse coaching her, doctor pulling on shoulders. Giving me the notion to cut the umbilical. She out, 8 pounds 4 ounces. Hold up: I'm about to make an announcement. See, every time a child is born somebody leave the world. So I thank the woman who gave her life for my baby girl"

church for thugs,"[Verse 1]. To all my niggas on the porch getting their hair braided. Corn rolled by a L.A. bitch. And I can't forget. My niggas riding the train Yankee fitted. Thermals under that Pelle shit. I love New York but gangbanging that's L.A. shit. And I'm proud of it. Spit it through the wire so the crowd love it. Haters you know who you are you can turn it down fuck it. I can shoot a video to it and spend half the budget. I'm gangsta, let the .40 cal blow in public. More hatred inside my soul than Pac had for Delores Tucker. Every time one of my niggas get shot the more I suffer. Cause we trapped inside a world where your forced to die for your colors. I seen it all through the Range tints. Got niggas doing life in the state pen. So I dread like Jamaicans. If I die for one of my statements. Than break up the streets of Compton and spill my blood in the pavement. [Hook]. Believe me niggas keep sayin they gon heat me up. Talking that shit like they goin lay me down. And then I come through strapped to see what's up. Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal. Niggas keep sayin they gon heat me up. Talking that shit like they goin lay me down. And then I come through strapped to see what's up. Niggas really don't know parts of me pal. [Verse 2]. Who I gotta talk to who I gotta write. I want my unsigned hype. Like Kanye want his five mics. Aiight, I handle bars you ain't gotta ride a bike. To peep game and his skill here go some training wheels. Let's roll. Through the city of god. Where LA niggas train to kill. Chop you up hundred times worse than the Haitians will. For real naw Pharrell I need a track homie. Dre we to close aint no turning back homie. Deal with it I'm a be here for ten years. Spittin like the ghost of Eric Wright and Big yeah. Let me paint this picture. While you sit here thinking in the back of your mind this is the shit yeah. I spit for you niggas doing 25 on they 5th year ready to throw a nigga off the 5th tier. Them white boys in the Abercrombie and Fitch gear. And every nigga who ever helped me get here. [Hook]. Believe me niggas keep sayin they gon heat me up. Talking that shit like they gon lay me down. And when I come through strapped to see what's up. Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal. Niggas keep sayin they gon heat me up. Talking that shit like they gon lay me down. And when I come through strapped to see what's up. Niggas really don't know parts of me pal. [Verse 3]. One brick, two brick. The boy moving weight. Now three bricks, four bricks. I'm driving upstate. Five Bricks, six bricks. The nigga got cake. Not rap money, but money been rap since '88. Look at the world we live in. Niggas steady hate, to the heckler at Koch. Leave him chopped up like freddy's face. Niggas catching feelings. Cause I'm about millions. And outta all the newcomers out, my flow's the illest. You a close second nigga,. A banana to a guerilla. Put us in the same cage and I'ma have to peel 'em. The best of both worlds. Rapping and drug dealing. Run and tell the chief I came to burn down the village. The head honcho, staring out the third story window. Of my Beverly Hills condo. With two long ass heats. I call 'em Shaq and Alonzo. You niggas want me outta L.A.. Yeah I know. [Hook]. Believe me niggas keep sayin' they gon' heat me up. Talking that shit like they gon' lay me down. And when I come through strapped to see what's up. Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal. Niggas keep sayin' they gon' heat me up. Talking that shit like they gon' lay me down. And when I come through strapped to see what's up. Niggas really don't know parts of me pal"
cocaine,"[ Verse One ]. I'm too gangsta for the streets, watch me when I creep. I put five in ya, G - leave a nigga sleep. Now you six feet deep over bullshit. Got a Mac 10 mouth ain't never pull shit. The ghetto know made G's and mo niggaz. Get down or lay down, like Bennie Mack told niggaz. Or meet the fo fo, nigga - I let the guns blow nigga. I'm a rider - thug live til I die. Black Wall Street behind us - I'm a menace to society. Fuck Cane And O dogg, I got the cane and the o's, dawg. I'm gangsta like Hennesy and Alizay, thug passion. Ride or die til they kill me and put me in thugs mansion. Gang bangin, this California life-style got me heated. They want me burried so I don't leave with out the Desert Eagle. Shoot first, ask questions on way to country jail. Kill a nigga over my chain, 'cause I know I'ma make bail. I'm troublesome. [ Verse Two ]. If I die tonight - bury me a G, (...) rap legends. 'Cause I spit bullets and rhymes, sixteens and nines. I keep a vest and a weapon, my baby momma got me stressin. Prayin on my knees every night, askin God is there a heaven. So here is my confession to my unborn child. If five shots couldn't drop me but I ain't take 'em and smile. I lost a lot of my niggaz to gang bangin and ditches. One finger on the trigger, dawg, I live the life of a sinner. These motherfucker wanna see me doing life in the pen. I'm a outlaw and the westcoast is ridin again. My competition is none, I'm on the mission with guns. Starring death in the eyes, 20 niggaz deep, when we ride. My enemies is bitches - they plottin on my riches. Can't walk in the street with out paparazzi taking pictures. Label me a made nigga, all the way from Compton to Boston. These niggaz keep talkin, I leave 'em dead in the coffin. I'm troublesome. [ Verse Three ]. Money over bitches is my motto, in the street I'n known for catchin hollo's. Packing pistols and drinking (belvy) and grabbles out the bottle. No roll models, only killas and fiends. Withness my niggaz strapped with gats, an army for (...). If it's murder, he wrote it, if I'm lying. let the devil excel quoted and know that I'm strictly a rap poet. Babtized in my own tears, (chestized) by my own peers. I'm a product of my childhood years. My mother told me I'm hopeless, my pops wasn't around. One of the reasons why I'm clutchin a pound. California dreaming, chronic smoke out the beamer. One hand on the nina, got these hoochie bitches screaming. They know that I'm a celeberty - keep the cop-killers in the clip. And watch my back is what my niggaz keep telling me. Twenty-one years old, no felonies so I ride with the Desert. and pay homage to the hardest rap legends. I'm troublesome"

Fuck all rappers, look at all the hate I see. I'm sick, you can't get rid of me, I'm HIV. Nigga get another job, hip-hop is not hirin. I'm the reason Dre feel comfortable retirin. I just might put out ""Detox"" myself. Smoke so much, I check in detox myself. One man army, took out Reeboks myself. Fortyfive in my khakis gotta watch my health.

Drop Jag with the price to pay. Cause the bags was heavy my chain swangin like a ice capade. Got the feds lookin twice this way. Cause we shuffle the P's in different places that the {?} name. Compton to Fillmoe man the game is real. When you turn 15 get your stainless steel. Whole squad been trained to kill, we official. And switch to get rich now we after the meals. Hard times got cakes for 3. When it's havin a bundle we break bread for the safe and flee nigga. [Chorus]. [The Game]. I got guns, guns, guns, guns. Guns all over the club. We in V.I.P. strapped, security know that. 25 deep, guns up under the throwback. That new R. Kelly shit sound like Bobby Womack. Black Wall Street in HURR, nigga where the hoes at. We got sour diesel, three cases of Hypnotiq. And more guns than the Nickerson Projects. Niggaz don't want beef with me. Cause they know they gotta pay for talkin shit but the sheets is free. And ain't nuttin to shoot the club up. You don't want drama in this motherfucker throw them dubs up. Jacob got the wrists on chill. And N.W.A. chain glow like the memory of Ill Will. Relax your mind and let your drawers feel free. You're now rollin to the sound of the Game and JT. [Chorus]. [JT the Bigga Figga]. But you can't come with the rest of her friends. Cause you know I'm a boss and won't play cause she short on my ends. Make rounds from the back of the Benz. With the {?} that kid with frog eyes with the corners to bend. The things we go through I'm beatin ya brains. Got some homies next do' and I picked up the Game. While they knockin on the do' I get deep in ya dame. Gotta charge you a G just for speakin my name. [The Game]. I'm not eatin your chocha or payin for the coach ma. I'm a pimp like 50, the nigga to leave you broke ma. 6 in the mornin, you stretchin on the sofa.

And I give you a dope track like my name Phar-rell. And you can get that stainless steel. Walk in my Chuck Taylors for a day, if you think it ain't f'real. When I buy rocks homey baguettes on my ring. And only neighborhood watch is my Tecno Marine. Keep a +Mac+ on the block, I ain't talkin 'bout Beans. QB in the hood and I'm far from Queens. The boys in the hood is always hard. So come through and get smoked like a Cuban cigar. [Chorus]. [The Game]. I'm from Compton, Compton, a block from hell. And you can come get a bird for eleven. And we ain't got a penny for the reverand, a dime for a witness. Only +Church's+ in the hood sell chicken (ba-KAW). Every nigga in the hood sell chickens move work like city buses. You fuckin with the Hub City Hustler. The vans on the block won't touch us, the streets my home. So I move weight on the block like I'm Moses Malone. Bring the guns anywhere I roam, go with the chrome. And I hit all my shots, like I'm in the A.I. zone. And mob like Al Capone through N.W.A.'s home. Homes like Ed Jones will cripple your team up. In the home of Dr. Dre, Venus and Serena. Where 14-year-olds pack ninas and drive Beamers. We ball up subpeonas, take niggaz to the cleaners. And you know what I'm talkin about if y'all seen where... [Chorus]. [The Game]. We drug dealin, but niggaz is squealin (fuck you rats). What more can I say, just kill 'em. Fuck 'em, the gun bust 'em, we just knock on wood. Now is this under-stooooooood?. I mostly George when I whip, my supply is good. The man behind the bricks, I'm supplyin the hood. Catch bodies like Pistol Pete passes on the wood. Benz parked by the fence, brick stashed in the hood. Top work by the inch, I bag it, it's gone. Ask Quik, we rock more than microphones. Some niggaz ball, some niggaz do what we do. And other niggaz sing for Cash Money like TQ. The block will heat and sink you (hey dude). Cali ain't all palm trees, purple haze and sea dude. Lose your life tryin to get these jewels. I keep the 40 cal wrapped in chrome like R2-D2. [Chorus]"

It, never stops, there's no stoppin' (It don't stop *****z). Light a lo', blow a smoke, oh,. As I cruise, streets of Compton. (Roll out the six fo, six trey, glass house, '57 Chevelot, tell them *****z). [Verse 1]. I let the whole world know that I can't be stopped,. Even without Doc I'm still from the (Streets of Compton),. Yeah ***** I said it, and I'ma stay on top,. Like a hoodrat with bomb ass cock,. Run up in 'em like these rap *****z, I ain't gotta clap *****z,. End your career with one line like that *****z,. Hit the switch front and back, make it bounce,. Let it jump, Killa-for-ni-a is where I'm from,. 3 wheelin' with the ass out, smoke chronic 'til I pass out,. All the way to my ***** Daz house,. He always gotta big bad bitch from Long Beach,. She a known freak and she gotta long reach,. She gon' touch it, suck it, fuck it, never back down,. 'specially when Al Green in the background,. Now bitch hit the weed and turn that ass round,. It's time to bring back Chronic into Doggystyle,. Westcoast *****z still holdin' shit down,. [Chorus (The Game)]. I'm a G, you can't see me,. That must be, why you're talkin' (Shut your mouth bitch). I'm the shit, and you know,. It, never stops, there's no stoppin' (It don't stop *****z). Light a lo', blow a smoke, oh,. As I cruise, streets of Compton. (Roll out the six fo, six trey, glass house, '57 Chevelot, tell them *****z). [Verse 2]. I'm back on the cover of the Source and the XXL,. Floatin' all through the (Streets of Compton),. I got more bitches, more plaques, more beef, and more straps,. That's what the fuck I call ""Gangsta rap"",. I was the Aftermath remedy 'til friends turn enemies,. Streets kept me laced like bloods dipped in hennesse,. You *****z act like the Game can't roll 'em out,. One man show still sell a motherfucker out,. We know Dre still sell a motherfucker out,. 'cus everybody here from the (Streets of Compton),. We got crip *****z, blood *****z, assays, asians,. Red and blue laces, tattoos on faces,. I kept you *****z waiting had to take you back to the basics,. Switch the Impala from gold to chrome Daitons,. Everytime your bitch hear my voice she masturbating,. I run though hoes like Walter Payton on the daily,. I got your main bitch swallowing my babies,. [Chorus (The Game)]. I'm a G, you can't see me,. That must be, why you're talkin' (Shut your mouth bitch). I'm the shit, and you know,. It, never stops, there's no stoppin' (It don't stop *****z). Light a lo', blow a smoke, oh,. As I cruise, streets of Compton. (Roll out the six fo, six trey, glass house, '57 Chevelot, tell them *****z). I'm the Westcoast Rakim, got you *****z blocked in,. Glass house parked sideways on the stock rims,. New school, old school mentality,. Translation - Four pumps and twelve batteries,. Hydraulics make the world go round,. Your girl go down, chronic make your girl slow down,. For she end up like superhead, giving superhead,. Every ***** in the industry now fuck superhead,. And I might just fuck her too,. If I ever catch her sliding or riding through the (Streets of Compton),. Rolling down Green Leaf smoking on that green leaf,. With a Mac 10 like I was born on Queen's Street,. Murder MCs like I was born in Queen's Bridge,. That how I show you palm *****z where the King is,. And you don't wanna play chess on a time clock,. I'm in the Hall Of Fame next to Snoop, behind 'Pac,. I got the whole motherfucking world locked,. [Chorus (The Game)]. I'm a G, you can't see me,. That must be, why you're talkin' (Shut your mouth bitch). I'm the shit, and you know,. It, never stops, there's no stoppin' (It don't stop *****z). Light a lo', blow a smoke, oh,. As I cruise, streets of Compton. (Roll out the six fo, six trey, glass house, '57 Chevelot, tell them *****z). [Outro]. Everybody wanna know what the fuck is going on,. Am I signed to Aftermath? Interscope? What's up with Geffen?. I'ma just say it like this:. One day I walked in the motherfuckin' house,. And all my shit was gone."

Real niggas sentence you. Dead Penalty. [Fabolous]. Uhhh. Lets get back to this real shit. We ride no pump breaks. Errbody takin like they the shooters. Mann I ain't goin for them pump fakes.

Jesus piece on my chain. need God with me in these streets. I went through hell to get to where heaven is. Lucy in that red dress lookin devilish. Scale a 1 to 10 she lookin elevenish. If she ain't ridin shotty AK 47 is. Shorty came to me when she left her man. I looked at her and said you sumthin else. But the best way to get over sumbody. Is gettin under sumone else. On that note I'm in that 1,2,3 pin that. Baby tellin me I'm the best I b yellin I been that. In the club half a pill and a full clip. Get a deal on a Rose no bullshit. [Game]. There goes ghost.

[Slim Thug]. I'm goin back to cali. I'm goin back to cali. I'm out of drank and dro so I'm goin back to cali. I need pints by the cases for this bag of big faces. Couple pounds of that kush I ain't the only one getting wasted. Smoke a lil, sell the rest Ima hustla baby. gotta Invest get mine plus interest. you niggas still ain't winiing yet. I just sold my 4th bentley. Then I got that photo porche. Bout to switch it up for the summa. Thinkin bout that electric hummer. Strapped up got extra armor. in case a hatin nigga wanna play. everythang I rep a 100. you could check my resume. they don't make em like me no more. They don't make a miss t no more.

If you see a fake nigga point em out (point em out). [Chorus]"
doctor's advocate,"[The Game]. Yo Bus, I think I got.... the answer to all my problems.... [Busta Rhymes]. The fuck you talkin' bout, n***a, what's that?. [The Game]. Belevedere... and Banana Snapple [hiccoughs]. [Busta Rhymes]. Look.... get your fuckin' ass up, n***a, you over here trippin' on yourself, n***a, you get in the fuckin' car, man, we gotta bounce, nig!. [The Game]. I'm a man... and most of these n***as, they don't know how to be a man... I got a son.... [Busta Rhymes]. The fuck you talkin about, n***a, come on, n***a, let's take yo' ass to the crib, n***a, you tired, n***a. And put the drink down, n***a! We gotta go, n***a!. [The Game]. One more shot..... [Chorus]. I didn't mean to walk away,. But I hear every word they say,. I guess my mind just drew a blank,. Like la, la, la..... Now I'm sitting in this goddamn cage,. Reminiscing about my day,. Wit' your blood all over my slate,. As the devil says, la, la, la.... [The Game]. [Verse 1]. Dre, I didn't mean to turn my back on you,. But I'm a man, and sometimes a man do, what he gotta do,. Remember, I'm from Compton too,. I saw you and Eazy in 'em so I started wearing Khaki suits,. I was 12, smoking chronic, in '92,. I had a choice, be like Mike, or be like you,. I made a choice, now it's be Crip, or be Piru,. Whatever I was, I was banging Gin and Juice,. Never knew back then, I'd be friends with Snoop,. Now I gotta keep it gangsta cuz it's in my roots,. So I owe you my life, when I betrayed you,. I tried to think of what the fuck, Eminem might do.. If every n***a hated him, for that black bitch track,. And n***as stopped bumping Dre after Dee Barnes got slapped,. When Doc say it's a wrap, it's a rap,. It's still Aftermath, and ain't nuttin' after that!. [Chorus]. I didn't mean to walk away,. But I hear every word they say,. I guess my mind just drew a blank,. Like la, la, la..... Now I'm sitting in this goddamn cage,. Reminiscing about my day,. Wit' your blood all over my slate,. As the devil says, la, la, la.... [The Game]. [Verse 2]. I never said thank you, and I took it for granted,. You let me in your house and made me a part of your family,. Now I'm eating with you, Eve and Busta Rhymes,. I wasn't star-struck, I was just glad to be signed,. And even though sometimes I run loose,. You still my homeboy, Doc, I'd take a bullet for you,. I'm not asking you to take my side in the beef,. But you told me it was okay to say 'Fuck the police!',. Now it's my turn to carry the torch,. And I still got the chain that you wore on the cover o' The Source,. Remember when we got drunk to do Start From Scratch?. I told you you was like a father to me, I meant that!. Sitting here looking at my platinum plaques,. Thinking 'What the fuck am I without a Dr. Dre track?'. When Doc say it's a wrap, it's a rap,. It's still Aftermath, and ain't nuttin' after that!. [Chorus]. I didn't mean to walk away,. But I hear every word they say,. I guess my mind just drew a blank,. Like la, la, la..... Now I'm sitting in this goddamn cage,. Reminiscing about my day,. Wit' your blood all over my slate,. As the devil says, la, la, la.... [Busta Rhymes]. [Verse 3]. See when the world is on your shoulders, and the stress grows bigger,. The fire in him made it difficult to talk to the n***a,. Most of the time I let him know, I don't agree with what he do,. But he a hard-head, Dre, that's why I'm talkin' to you,. See when I first met my n***a, son was laying in the cut,. Type reserved, homie was quiet and kept his mouth shut,. Until you told him to spit for me, he flippin' from the gut,. I dug his spirit, and I thought the dude was talented as fuck,. And as time went on, and he was working with the finest,. I saw the pressure start to build so I gave additional guidance,. You gave him something that could make or break a n***a you should face it,. So big I don't even think he was ready to embrace it,. With the potential to be a strong n***a with conviction,. The only problem was our little n***a wouln't listen,. But when Doc say it's a wrap, it's a rap,. It's still Aftermath, and ain't nuttin' after that!. [Chorus]. I didn't mean to walk away,. But I hear every word they say,. I guess my mind just drew a blank,. Like La, la, la..... Now I'm sitting in this goddamn cage,. Reminiscing about my day,. Wit' your blood all over my slate,. As the devil says, La, la, la.... [Busta Rhymes]. Aiyo, Game... Aiyo Game! Wake up, n***a!. [The Game]. I'm up man, I'm up.... [Busta Rhymes]. We at your crib, n***a, get the fuck outta the car, n***a, get up, man!. [The Game]. This ain't my house... my house is.... is green!. [Busta Rhymes]. The fuck you talk- look, come on, n***a, let's go man, let me walk you up to the... come on... n***a where the keys at, n***a we need to open your door, n***a!. [The Game]. I got love for you, Bus', you my n***a.... [Busta Rhymes]. Nig get in the fucking bed, n***a, go to sleep, n***a, you tired, n***a. And don't fucking drink like that no more, man, you fucking look like Ned the Wino, you drunk motherfucker.... [The Game]. Just goin to the studio.... [Busta Rhymes]. [Laughing] Go to sleep, n***a.... [8 Bar Verses]. by nbU."
don't cry,"[Intro/Chorus - sample]. -- Don't cry {*5X*} don't... -- Don't cry {*5X*} don't... [The Game]. Amayah wake up baby. I know you're sleepin, but daddy's home now. Pictures gettin old, my lil' girl lookin grown now. Your moms said you're talkin on your own, walkin on your own now. Run across the kitchen floor in them baby drawers. I sent you from off tour and I miss you when I was tourin. Smilin at them baby pictures, so happy, tears pourin. God how can somethin so beautiful come from me?. After the gunshots thought you was done with me. But I know I'm livin now, why you made me put the guns down. Pick up the mic, start rappin for a living now. My sun, my moon, my starts, my earth. My wind, my fire, my life, my bay-bay. Tryin to make your moms life ya must be crazy, fussin and fightin. I know she love me cause ya look just like me. Day you came into this world I was so excited. Eleven twenty-one double-zero, my baby girl is here. [Chorus]. [Blue Chip]. Yo, yo, you see this rap shit I do it for you. And the first time I heard your voice I prayed to God it had to be true. Got a son now, cuttin the game, stoppin the bullshit. Remember eyein your enemy, can you pull quick. Dipped out Cali, came back, snatched my son. my girl moms and I moved out Maui. Yeah your pops gone bananas, seen wild went hard. Bigger house, wider yard, nappy with the crash bar. Off that hersh', shit you stupid, you ain't no dad nigga. Takin your black ass to court for all you have nigga. You see me and your moms, that's another topic. Ain't no whip in this world with a price you can't cop it. Stop it, press rewind, you didn't hear me right. It's a lesson to the song, I'm tryin to steer you right. Just remember your father taught you to go hard or go home. Never sing that sad song, don't cry. [Chorus]. [The Game]. Huh daddy ain't gon' preach to you, I'ma let your moms school you. Don't let the streets fool you, streets'll do you, that's why I'm talkin to you. [Blue Chip]. Yeah, you see these niggaz out here, have you stressin by the hour. Never turn your back on your foes, them dudes cowards. [The Game]. Some days sweet, and some sour - but we gon' make it together. The world is ours, and you're my flower. [Blue Chip]. If it's ice you can get that, model chicks hit that. Never stress about the downfalls just 'bout the getback. [The Game]. And I ain't sayin sex is wrong, just make sure he strap a condom on. And never, ever do it in your mother's home. [Blue Chip]. Yeah, never call a girl a bitch, show respect, son pop ya collar. Ain't nothin free, scrape and lock every dollar. [The Game]. And I will leave you with this, my lil' angel, daddy loves you. How I'd die for you, cry for you, ride for you. [Blue Chip]. Yeah, switchin handles like you breakin a zone, candy paint Impala. On the Golden Bridge, bouncin on chrome. [Chorus]"
don't kill my vibe (freestyle),"[Verse 1: Game]. Bitch, don't kill my vibe ? nigga, don't blow my high. Wake up in a Bugatti but I'm in a Maserati when I'm on the 405. I'm king of the motherfuckin' Westside. Two dubs up when the TEKs fly. ?Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! ?. Turn a 600 to an S5. Compton made me direct this ending. Like my little nigga Kendrick, props to Jay-Z. Got a Rocky pendant and a drop Mercedes. I'll been gone 'til November but I'm not from Haiti. I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-N, N-I. Double G A like a young D-Wade. Brought my city a championship by myself. And niggas think I'm doin' this shit for my health. I am, don't make me go HAM, 4-5. Go blam, I was just protecting my wealth. Matte black Bentley, all-black pennies. Black Tom Ford shades, I'm 'bout to go stealth. All black everything?. Trap Wesley Snipes inside Tiffany's wedding ring. Nigga, never get out?. I'm constipated, just tryna get my shit out. False alarm, I can't do #2. Pee on you peons for eons and eons. Used to intercept niggas, rock like Deion. Sellin' white packs out my grandmama's Neon. Ask my nigga Breon?. I played ?Pac's brother in this classic movie. No relationship to Leon?. When I spit for Dre I had a nigga forehead. like a nigga was a klingon. No album out, I'm on 106 like a nigga put Free on. Any beat that I breathe on or be on, I be gone. I brawl like I'm out in Maryland, Georgetown, Michigan. Florida, watch a nigga get his UNC on. Baby Jordans for my baby daughter. No Harold Miner, can I get my USC on?. Eight cars in my driveway, sideways. Horsepower make the Lamborghini fly away. I am the shit when I step out the Six. And I step at your bitch in my brand new kicks. ?you bitch? don't act brand new. ?Cause you suck on my dick when you walk in my crib. Airplane mode, won't be no duck lips next to Van Gogh. Dance with the devil, I learned to tango. ?S? on the metal, I wrapped the Range Rove. Ride to my limits inside the Infinite. God is my witness, I've got the roof in it. Designed to go win it. Mismatched rims on the motherfuckin' Phantom. Nigga, nigga on God, I'mma spend it. Compton? Westside, and I'm riding with Kendrick. [Outro: Kendrick]. I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again. Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me. Things I don't understand. Sometimes I need to be alone. Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe. I can feel your energy from two planets away. I got my drink, I got my music. I would share it but today I'm yelling. Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe. Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe. You ain't heard a chorus like this in a long time. Don't you see that long line"
don't need your love,"[The Game]. Yo Havoc, I'm too close to the edge on this one nigga. I ain't gon' jump though, I'ma keep it raw gutter. Yo Prodigy, you know I need you on this one nigga. [The Game]. I got shit on my chest, I must confess. Last night I was the nigga that shot up your projects. Now I'm back in the hood, with rocks in the Pyrex. Tan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks. I was forced to live this life, forced to bust my chrome. My pops left me in a foster home. I felt abandoned like Quik now that Mausberg gone. So I don't hop in the SS without the Mossberg homes. I've been rappin for a year and a half, my life is real. Put the gun in his mouth, he gon' bite the steel. Come to Compton, I got stripes for real. Before Dre, before the ice, before the deal - I was almost killed. Like 'Pac before the Death Row deal. I got shot over two pounds of weed, still ain't found them niggaz. But karma come quicker for a nigga on the other side of the gun. That's somethin I gotta teach my son. [Chorus: Faith Evans]. I don't need your love, no no no no. I don't need your love. Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it. I don't need your love, no I don't need your love. I don't need your love. Cause, the, game, don't, change. [The Game]. I heard they got Bloods in New York now. Red rags in Uptown Harlem now, I need that love. Front court at the Knicks game, new chick, French name. New car, new house, and sometimes friends change. And you don't need that love, when you G's like us. And your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's. And your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's. First they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again. What the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?. No mics, no +Unsigned Hype+, nigga *FUCK* The Source. Plus them awards I don't need. And them niggaz breathin the same air as me, actin like they don't bleed. We don't drive the same speed, this a Continental T. That's a case of Armadale, this a continental suite. So I'ma drown in my own sorrows. Live life, fuck tomorrow, nigga cause reality is. [Chorus w/ variations + ad libs]. [The Game]. I was gassed up, Murder Inc., Roc-A-Fella passed up. Sat in Daddy's House with Black Rob and Lou and asked Puff. Now The Game set in stone, the Frank Muniz set in stones. Dre cut me a check, I'm gone. Tryin to be the king of the streets, niggaz'll wet your throne. But I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please. So I roam through the city like the ghost of E. Gotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be. Nuttin between all my niggaz that's close to me. In the streets with two fellas packin toast for me. I'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watchin my pivot. On my block in the Coupe readin kites from prison. I got niggaz doin life in prison. All my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor. So this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur. And all the mothers of dead sons that went out in the war. [Chorus - 2X w/ variations + ad libs]. *Enviado por ""Sekef"""

dope game,[Lil Wayne:]. Money to be made best believe a nigga glockin'. I run it myself like a quarterback option. I pitch her ten G's tell a bitch to go shoppin'. She buy herself some clothes and she brought me back a chopper. See niggas tryna kick it but no I don't play soccer. I'm all about my cake I'm tryna marry Betty Crocker. A package on the way you know my whip game proper. And off of one key I see seventy thousand dollars. Now I was shootin' dice smokin' on a joint. I bet with Yo Gotti he hit five straight points. We over here hustlin' we over here grindin'. You rap about money and a nigga might sign you. Rap about me and a nigga might find you. Banana in your ass with your head right behind you. Dope game bitch let his mama worry about him. You could holla at me or Feat. [The Game:]. As if he fuckin' come at us with real murder shit. John Mohammed Lee Malvo when me and the kid split. Surgical when I'm in a convertible state of mind. Lock me in the pen watch the murder rate decline. I'll do mine like Shyne soon as I hit the bricks. You better have fake on that Bad Boy shit. I got niggas that'll kidnap kids to get dough. And dress up like SpongeBob in a six-four. It's fucked up what they did so I'm on one knee. God bless the brother of rich fo'. Ain't no love lost I'm still Don sippin'. Readin' the LA Times and Louis Vuitton slippin'. Sittin' behind bars for the simple fact that the. Hip Hop police is drivin' behind Scar's. Air Force One's in the Bentley GT. It's the reason I'm still rap's MVP. [Malice:]. Ugh.. so much glamour that I can't stand the. Bright from the ice the chain xenon lamp ya. Impression in your mind like a freeze-frame camera. The white tee tight like you seen on Pampers. What's under the couch probably free off santa. Whatever it cost baby we got answers. Line outside full of jojo dancers. We Got It 4 Cheap that's the re-up anthem. By far the coldest '06 Lotus. Zero to sixty hokus-pokus. The feds don't know so they stick they noses. While we off the coast proposin' toast-es. Hoes and mo' shit the family close-knit. And deep like the who too you cockroaches. Just like the flow the fo's ferocious. I'll tuck you in homie buenas noches

dr. dre 1,"[Dr. Dre]. Now his parents hustled. So he was left alone by himself a lot. So shit, he did whatever the fuck he wanted to do. When boys in the hood came out, this little nigga rolled himself a joint. And watched the whole motherfucker by itself. His pops didn't give a fuck, but his mom found out?. Shit, she'd kill him and his dad. She didn't want him seeing, being or getting caught up in no gangsta shit. So she never knew, until now"
dr. dre 2,"[Dr. Dre]. In Compton, you either a blood or a crip. Nigga ain't no one in between. Shit was a hard decision for him to make, cause both his parents was crips. His Uncle Greg was a crip, he died when he was 5. His brother Jevon was a Crip, he got murdered when he was just 13. After that he decided that being a crip just wasn't for him. So he ran across the tracks until everything turned red. And never looked back"
dr. dre intro,"[Dr. Dre]. His moms and pops met in Compton. His pops was a Nutty Blocc Compton Crip. Moms was from South Central, she claimed Hoover. They had the lil nigga in 1979 at Martin Luther King hospital. And if you know anything about Killa King, you know this:. Being born there is just like dying there"
dr. dre outro,"[Dr. Dre]. This nigga been shot, but you already know that. He went to jail recently and Monster Kody taught him. ""This ain't no place for you, you see bein' locked up 24 hours a day. That shit ain't gangsta, you see bein' outside takin' care of your family. That's the most gangsta shit a nigga could ever do"". He said ""The shit ideal for takin' em out the hood. Givin' em a chance to be some motherfuckin' body. Now that shit was gangsta"""
drama is real,"[San Quinn]. Drama is real, like not wakin up. I'm breakin up grounds when this patriot thrust. Your mouth is on shut, your emotions are hidden. For you to handle your business, you are more than driven. If you kill it no more standin on that corner like a stop sign. Everytime you spotted they call it shot time. Not at the gym but in the grim reaper's hands. You important if a bullet hits, injure your plans. This is not an adventure, but a full-time duty. If you seen how niggaz hit the club, they pullin out uzis. Sometimes bruisin and grazin, mostly takin. No more sleep for the shooter, no more of that hangin. No mo' trustin hoes you ain't know fo' ten plus. No mo' smokin with the homies, no mo' late night clubs. Cause the victim, is ready to stick him like a mousetrap. I'm 'bout to rap, you better be 'bout peepin out cash. [Chorus: The Game]. If there's blood on my Nikes I done murdered a nigga. If the stash spot smokin I done murdered a nigga. San Quinn got a hurt for the nigga, it get worser for niggaz. We take this beef shit further than niggaz. Streets are shady, the Game got curtains for niggaz. All-of-a-sudden-ass killers never heard of these niggaz. Have your whole family cryin a river, we'll murder you niggaz. We take this beef shit personal nigga. [The Game]. I ain't met a nigga yet could fuck with this rap vet. I'm the realest since I came in the game on Kam back. Rest in peace to Mausberg, gotta live with that. Keep the M2 on my hip, I live with that. Eat with that, sleep with that, come get me. Four-fifty put somethin through your son Easter basket. Six in your truck, get you each a casket. Put termites in your box let 'em eat your cabbage. A wife right here, see if she can weave through traffic. Everybody gotta die, when the beef is active. If you know Game, you know I'll never give free passes. But I give choices, how you want it, metal or plastic. Life is real, pedal to traffic, no spots on my tail. Cops on the payroll so me and Quinn live well. And I can still get a nigga the hill, your bitch as well. Shotgun got mo' punks than shells. [Chorus]. [The Game]. See the Escalade got 'em runnin downhill, snowball niggaz. We throw vapors out of truck windows, blow our figures. Suede corners out the sunroof, the fifth or the Ruger. Broad daylight, blow the windows out of your Cougar. Move in the S5, plus my, leather dust fly. Spark up a dutch, Game put niggaz in a coffin too much. Turn niggaz kids into orphans too much, In God We Trust - nah. Keep the fifth close like Starsky & Hutch. Your daughter cryin it's just {?} tuck, but so what. Blow the dutch, southpaw bust out your whole fronts. Have you eatin soup for months, broken jaw, lick your shit out of straws. I guess I got that same ol' harm. I ain't for play, the Game is raw. Specialize in death jackets, here try these bullets on. And next time have all my cheese cause if you owe me. Guns O-U-T, we all gon' squeeze. [Chorus]"
dreams,"""Dreams"". [Verse 1]. I woke up out dat coma, 2000 and 1. Bout the same time Dre dropped 2000 and 1. Three years later the album is done. Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude Volume 1. Rap critics politicin. Wanna know the outcome!. Ready to die, Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one. I feel like Pac, after the Snoop Dogg trial was done. Dre behind the G-Series and All Eyez On Me. I watched the death of a dynasty!. So I told Vibe Magazine. Workin' with Dr.Dre was a ""DREAM!"". I had visions of makin' a classic. Then my wall turned black,like I was starin outa Stevie Wonders glasses. It's kinda hard to imagine,like Kanye West. Comin back from a fatal accident, to beat makin' and rappin'. But, we da future. Whitney Houston told me that, it's gon take mo' than a bullet in a heart to hold me back. [Hook]. Blushin' in this 40 ounce. Lettin the ink from my pen bleed. Cuz Marthin Luther King had a ""DREAM!"". Aaliyah had a ""DREAM!"". Left Eye had a ""DREAM!"". So I reached out to Kanye and ""brough you all my dreeam!"". [Sample playin ""It's cuz I love you!""]. [Verse 2]. I had dreams of fuckin' an R'n'B bitch like Mya. When I saw dat ass on a front of that King. Read the article in a magazine. She loved gangsters, loved nasty things. So I'm the glass house havin' nasty dreams!. Good girls neva' give it up. But anything gets possible ,if 50 fucked Vivica. Heard of life's obstacles,found my way through the maze. Then joy turned to pain like, Frankie Beverly and Maze. Used to dream about bein' Unsigned Hype. Till I was crushed my Dave Mase, almost let my pen fall asleep on a page. Daydreamin' yesterday. Dozin' on offback stage. I tought I saw Eazy talkin' to Jam Master Jay. So I walked over heard Jam Master say. It's a hardknock life, then you pass away. They say sleep is the cousin' of death. So my eyes wide open cuz a dream is kin to ya last breath. [Hook]. Blushin' in this 40 ounce. Lettin' the ink from my pen bleed. Cuz Marthin Luther King had a ""DREAM!"". Aalyah had a ""DREAM!"". Left Eye had a ""DREAM!"". So I reached out to Kanye and ""brought you all my dream!"". [Sample playin ""It's cuz I love you!""]. [Verse 3]. The Dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through. The Dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you!. Who walk through the Whithouse without a business suit?. Compton had Jerry Curl drippin' on Ronald Reagens shoes. Gave Mike Lim my demo came here to pay my dues. Started of with Whoo Kid then I started blazin' Clue. It was all a Dream like BIG said it be. Don't sleep on me homie I bring nightmarers to reality. Rap Phenomenon defyin' the rulez of gravity. Studied all the classic start revisin my strategy. Cuz Marshall Mathers made it. Curtis Jackson made it. Head in the clouds wonderin where the hell Marvin Gaye went?. How do I say this, I'm livin' for my son but I can't figure, why I'm at my temple with this gun. Wake up to a Jesus Piece like a Cathlic Nun. The War to be a rap legend has just begun. [Hook]. Blushin' in this 40 ounce. Lettin' the ink from my pen bleed. Cuz Marthin Luther King had a ""DREAM!"". Aalyah had a ""DREAM!"". Left Eye had a ""DREAM!"". So I reached out to Kanye and ""you are my dreeam!"". [Sample playin ""It's cuz I love you!""]"

(Was it all a dream?) Dream (dream) dream (dream) dream. (Was it all a dream?) (Jay-Z: ""It was all a dream"") {*3X*}. [Notorious B.I.G.]. It was all a dream; I used to read Word Up magazine. Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine. Hangin pictures on my wall. Every Saturday, Rap Attack - Mr. Magic, Marley Marl. I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped. Smokin weed and bamboo, sippin on private stock. Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack. With the hat to match. (Jay-Z: ""It was all a dream"") Duh-ha, duh-ha. You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far. Now I'm in the {dream} cause I rhyme {dream}. Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade. Born sinner, the opposite of a winner. Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner. Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri. Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky. I'm blowin up like you thought I would. Call the crib, same number same hood, it's {dream}. [The Game]. Aaliyah had a {dream} Left Eye had a {dream}. [Notorious B.I.G.]. And if you don't know, now you know.

Yo, Fig' never play with them guns, no you hear me. Fig' ain't shot nuttin up but kill spirits. Fig' ain't the one to be, scared of the losses. One-on-one fightin for stripes with right crosses. Uppercuts and heatbutts to get a head rush. Bitch niggaz rather kick back, and let they lead bust. I been a pitbull since Fila {?} and Kenny Ken. Used to chuck 'em by the corner sto' whoever win. Them was my O.G.'s, and I was just a B.G.. Whoever want to see me, Figgaro can {?}. But now we got them old niggaz that bust with they tommy. But caught without they tommy get rushed like salami. Cause everybody tired of them R.I.P.'s. We 'bout to bring this fightin back mayne to all our streets. Now, cowards wanna pack and, killers wanna cruise and. Real niggaz stand alone mayne and do what we do. I wanna bust you but homey let me ask you. Why you wanna play with that gun, and make me blast you. Moms all cryin and shit, she gotta ask you. {?} better to save on caskets you dumb nigga. [Chorus + Hook]. [Verse Three: JT]. Oh boy! Old friends like to make up and get cavi. Hell nah, she in the club wit'cho baby daddy. She got the coat on he bought you for yo' birthday (oh no!). You kickin back, I'm 'bout to clown him in the worst way (bitch).

That's right, so if she leave, she fucking with me. That's life, twerk something, work something, hurt something. She wanna check, check this shit out like a verse coming. They rip their neck and run their mouth when they heard something. Dre dropped another one and fucked around and murdered something. Club filled with dead bodies. If not then you a zombie, I'm not gonna feel sorry. You pass out from it, get drunk, get blunted. Do what you wanna do, drug test on you. [Game]. Lotta money when I talk. Big mills, big deals ‘bout a hundred in a vault. Sit still, that real, lotta haters throw salt. They lost big Game give a fuck how you feel. I fear she just might just pop that pill. And feel on me all night till the tip spill. Tip scales with her waistline, sex with the bassline. She gon' fuck a snare drum one drink at a time. [Dr. Dre]. Blow right, hoes fight over my name. I got my dough right, hustle running all in my veins. It’s forty days, forty nights if I’m making it rain. I reign supreme, a bottle and some bomb-ass weed then we good. [Hook: Sly].

'til your mothafucking brain don’t function. High of something, high of something. What I supply taking you high?. [Verse 2: Game]. Fireworks when I spark, yellow tape. Lotta chalk thought you said you a boss. Big deal, bitch chill, pulling out that black card. Showin’ off big spendin’, letting alcohol spill. I feel she might just get too faded.

eat your beats alive,"Three wheel motion around the corner on these niggaz mayne. Smashin down the block, Charlie O beat in the deck. Game, what it do? (What it do?). [The Game]. They love the way a nigga hop them six-fours and shit. The way I, push buttons make them Diablo doors lift. The way I, stick and move, when I'm behind the wheel. of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill. The way I, peel back niggaz jerseys. It ain't your life, I'm just not a big fan of James Worthy. So wait 'til I see y'all, I'm real surgical with the Ruger. But you won't catch my face on E.R.. But you might catch them dudes from the ambulance. Squattin on top of ya mans givin 'em each CPR. Tryin to get 'em to ""Breathe Again"" like Toni Braxton. Told y'all 'bout comin to Cali, with them phony accents. Hollywood got movies, but it ain't no actin. So wear that bling to them awards like it ain't no jackers. We chain snatchers (twenty-fo' seven). [Chorus: JT]. When you're on the West coast - eat ya beats alive. When ya come to the lab - eat ya beats alive. Fuckin with this cash - eat ya beats alive. Cause it's all about math - eat ya beats alive. When you're on the West coast - eat ya beats alive. When ya come to the lab - eat ya beats alive. All about this cash - eat ya beats alive. Nigga all about math - eat ya beats alive. [The Game]. It ain't nuttin to spray you faggots. Or have your moms get you a Burberry suit so you look good in that casket. It's [reversed] you faggots, desperado in tact. June, Drago, The Game and D-Mac (holla). Come through in a grim reaper black Cadillac. Seven-three, ooh-wee, you see, who he. With the ugliest, flows, money hungriest. Oh, the kid got hoes, you ain't know?. Head is never optional, get my whistle, blizzow. Carry pistols, to your Sources and your Grammys. Of course it's that nigga that kick down doors. And leave rooms filled with corpses, Jordan and bloody Air Forces. To get my dough I come back like Air Jordan. Same shot, lil' older, still no nigga can hold him. Stepped back, sold crack let the Compton streets mold him. Big face said I could it, he'll bet you a G. [Chorus]. [JT]. See I'm the nigga with the most flow. Figgaro from killer Cali, reppin Get Low, niggaz know. Independent with my hustle. Couldn't give a fuck money or muscle it's time to bubble. West coast is the place where we holdin it down. Bay area thuggin, they knowin it now. I'm from the home of the Get Low, home of the get dough. Home where they want mo' so niggaz get they pistol. Run up in yo' back do', lookin for the cheddar cheese. Canary wristwatch on celebrities. Diamond bezelled iced out with hella cheese. And every fuckin link is like a masterpiece.

I'm from Compton homey, but I'm like a center for Milwaukee. Cause I play for the Bucks, and I keep the 40 on me. Gotta keep the chrome-y, gotta keep my back to the wall. Wait for Q to rock me up, like cavi dawg. Speakin of lle', I put 8 in, 10 jump back hard. And watch my money come back, like Jordan in charge. I'm like the black Yankees, they don't want me around no more. Cause I hold the record for the most fiends roamin the boulevard. And when I'm on the boulevard, catch me behind the wheel. of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill. [Chorus - repeat 2X]. Steppin out of Chevies with heat that's heavy - that's president. Bullets flyin for them dead guys - that's president. Led meltin inside your wig - that's president. 20's 50's and 100's burnin - it's all president. [Telly Mac]. Aiyyo I do this shit from Compton to the Mac block. High-tech collaborations with the Gamblaz and Blacksox. Drillin 'em killin 'em if we ain't feelin 'em nigga. If Sticky Fingaz need some music straight stealin it nigga. Shinin, in big trucks, big will in it nigga we climbin. To the top and we sealin it nigga. So back the fuck up, my niggaz act the fuck up. So keep yourself in line or you could get smacked the fuck up. Jacked the fuck up, beat up bad and clapped the fuck up. Wrapped up in white sheets and threw in a white truck. Over presidents, now you willin to give your life up?. Put your kids on the line, and give your wife up?. Over presidents, they got you soulless. So take this bomb and hold this, while we control this. For the streets, we comin with heat that's stolen. And we hustle universal, for that paper that we foldin. Roll in 600's, Beemers and 'llacs. We a team of cats, with the pens and gats. That fiend for jacks, but only when the green's attached. We fiend for jacks, but only when the green's attached. [Chorus]. [The Game]. It's Telly and young Game the hustler, ho juggler, coke smuggler. No matter what the hustle, dough doublin. Lle or the rock, give me a day and a spot. And I bet I'll come back with 10K in the drop. [Telly Mac]. I'll stay in the spot, wearin a crop and coppin ounces. Telly Mac and Game the hustler, we rock the house. And plus we the reason that the blocks is out. So my words to the wise is just watch your mouth. [The Game]. And you don't want it when the stainless out, what the game about. The bullets is in, your brains is out. All over Frisco and Compton dawg, we ruthless. And the truth is y'all niggaz can't stop us dawg. [Telly Mac]. So why the fuck you wanna knock us off. Like we some high-powered cowards and y'all really the niggaz that's soft. Still across the train tracks, we turn 'caine crack. It's Telly Mac and Game the hustler, you can't change that. [Chorus] - to fade w/ Digital Underground ad libs"
exclusively,"[Chorus: repeat 2X]. Exclusively, ridin on them deuces G. Talkin 'bout what your gameplan used to be. They got us choppin up game through the fog and smoke. We came a long way but still we got so far to go. [Verse One]. Yeah I know I got 4 to go, so with these bars I flow. At a pace for the papes I thank y'all should know. I lace it properly for property, it really ain't no stoppin me. And plus I'm tryin to get my money on like Monopoly. Politickin economy, if I could be a made nigga. Smokin on e'ry nigga, balled out paid nigga. Keepin it real, I'm still deep in the field. Deep with the skills for the bills. I got the million dollar mouthpiece with no gold grill. I bring the thrill like Will Clark. I will bust I will spark and flame in the booth. You blind you shoulda saw it when I came in the booth. I serve the thunder, that shit that'll brang in the roof. [Verse Two]. My niggaz, stack riches, mack bitches. Blow fast Swishers with my folks, act vicious with my folks. Sav livin with my vo-cals, Outlaw like my nigga No-ble. Fuckin bad bitches at the hotel. There's nothin to a boss, man we live it up. Smash for the cash and respect so when we mash niggaz give it up. I got no time for that fake shit. Jersey to the Bay niggaz thuggin even bitches thinkin they sick. So nigga basically the world is a ghetto. Play a nigga out his scratch, he gon' be twirled in a meadow. I keep it real with niggaz that be true to me. There's nothin you can do to me. My crew is deep and real niggaz rule the streets. [Chorus]. [Verse Three: The Game]. Lace your Timbs, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas. You can't ball then it's probably the haters. Can't breathe then it's probably the desert, if you a gangster or not. I give a fuck dawg, bullets is hot. And every nigga gon' cry when he hit. The more pain the more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit. And your niggaz ain't gon' ride for shit, they know. if they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit. Red rag or blue rag, niggaz die for this. The Game the reason all these niggaz on that ""Cali Love"" shit. Compton niggaz get grimy too, pull you out of that 6. Fuck you up like one time'll do. And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard. Pull it hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw. Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket. You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it. [Verse Four]. It's time for me to shine, life on the grind, life on the line. Feelin like I'm runnin out of time. It's now or never, chasin this cheddar 'til things get better. These streets got me hungry as ever. Can't stop can't change, young Sav stuck in the game. Everyday we gotta hustle and slang, struggle and strain. to bubble, weed plus the 'caine to juggle. Organize the brains and muscle. [Chorus]. [Verse Five]. You {?} like Sammy did Gotti, told 'em we kamikaze. Like those whiteboys ain't heedin the robbery. Told 'em we ride around in them cars on them big wheels. In the killing field makin 100 bills on the P-700 Pirelli wheels. Marshall Faulk in to ball again in this day to day scrimmage. 'Bout the spinach this game is relentless where we livin. Niggaz'll 32 round ya, kick you on the ground. After they down ya, sneak ya and plot ya, Heckler & Koch ya. Got ya body bein scrutinized by a flock of doctors. Still an unsolved mystery, statistically, history. A Get Low nigga victory by fuckin with my credibility"
fire in ya eyes,"[Sample]. Love is as well gone. As sunny sunny days. [Hook 2X]. [Game]. Yeah I'm addicted to slugs. I can tell by your pearl handle you know how to treat a thug.

Nigga run up on Ya Boy baby you be shootin' too. Fuck Bonnie and Clyde mama, we much deeper. Ya Boy love dough and you the toppings on my pizza. The heater to my ether, my beautiful senorita. And I knew you was my bitch from the first, moment I seized ya. And just like, every blunt needs some green. Every gun needs a beam, every thug needs a queen. She suckin me up, I be sippin the bub. Had to pinch myself, nigga, I think I'm in.. I'm in... [Hook 2X]. [Cyssero]. Shit.. Fuck.. That's how it go... Lemme show ya man.. ?? .. That's my bitch man.. First time I held her, the first time I banged her. First time I made her bust, first time I aimed her. Me and her the oh six (06) Bonnie and Clyde. And I call her Nino Wesson when there's drama she ride (ah ha). And it's gutter hell, it's just me and my bitch. Like Ready to Die, track number twelve. Yea that's wifey: sexy, chrome and black complexion. Got me gettin erection. She chill on my hip, when I play the strip wit her. Show her how much I love her when I stick my clip in her. I get chips and dip with her. Then the shit'll get ugly if I'm doin ? wit her. Menage a toi, double the action. Real street niggaz know I be double the slappin. And to my main squeeze, believe me. The Fire in ya eyes, will have me squeeze on a man easy. [Hook 2X]. [Game]. Night after night... lookin through that glass window wishin you was mine. Wishin I could hold you... Just wanna squeeze the life outta you... I remember in '96 when we met, you got the best of me. I had an appetite for destruction, you had the recipe. Told me the last motherfucker chose his destiny. One in the head, execution style, so I'm guessin. He ain't know you was special, misused you and abused you. Put his hand around your neck, squeezed harder when you refused. To open your mouth, give him everything you got. I see the fire in ya eyes and in a nigga the shot. I guess what I'm tryin to say is that I like you a lot. You let me hold you like he hold you we take over the block. Go from the dope spot to the CL drop. You like it I love it, now me and you callin the shots. Remember yesterday when we rocked ____ (muted) ??. You told me you wished you could've been there when Pac got knocked. Tonight we goin to the range, that'll get you hot. Wear your pretty dress, the one with the infrared dots. I'm in... [Hook 2X]"
for my gangstaz,"Livin in Compton, California C-A"". Charlie O, drop that hot shit. [The Game]. Motherfucker it's the Game, mister tint the windows wit'cha brain. Since a young'n up and comin, all I did was cop 'caine. They try and change the Game, nigga I still cop 'caine. I ain't moved out the hood, still stay where the cops came. Bitches tryin to throw salt in my name, barbers tryin to part my game. Niggaz tryin to chalk my frame. But I walk on a thin line without scuffin my Chucks. Bad Boyyyyy, and I fuck with Puff. So bring the guns if you want nigga; I'm real good with the glock. And 50 G's say you leave in a box. When I fuck Lil' Kim guess I'm feelin like 'Pac. Niggaz wanna wrestle The Game, guess they feel like The Rock. ""It doesn't matter,"" 745 up and down your block. Hop out with a Nextel, niggaz feel like they shot. It's different in my hood, only time we take shots. is when the Dodgers did good, my niggaz live on the block. [Chorus]. This is for the gangster, in me. This is for the gangster, in you - all my gangsters pour the brew. This is for the gangster, in me. This is for the gangster, in you - all my gangsters red and blue. [Verse Two]. I'm worldwide with this gangsta lean, my life's no dream. I got a crew in Jamaica, Queens. Lake Charles up to New Orleans in D.C. I sip. My thugs get crunk off Lil' Flip. State to state many shows I rip, I'm the boss of the Bay. Like Clint Eastwood, make my day. Fine bitches look like Lisa Raye, plot on gettin paid. In the end, all they get is played. Maybe a nut, no Ice Capade. Real dudes is shiesty, I only give jewels to wifey. And I don't give a fuck if you really don't like me. It's in my blood to thug, get ill and hyphy. One of the best I might be, it really don't matter. When I bust, sucker MC's scatter, gettin out of my way. I bust bad bitches night and day. I make classics like Dr. Dre, closed casket from rhymes I say. [Chorus]. [The Game]. ... Gon' move in on your rock, say fuck the crisis. And ride with the West we got lower coat prices. You know me the king of L.A., New York. Drivin through Brooklyn in a fo', same color as water. You want X? I can cover the order. Ninety-fo' been hustlin now watch the shit elevate like Vince Carter. Not the rap martyr, or the second rap Carter. Compton's own, I'm home, not the best I just rap harder. Heir to the throne, nobody rep Compton like me. Street spinnin like waves on that Continental T. My grandmoms woulda been proud of me, look at your grandson now. 'Til my demis, Black Mafia ties. So it's hard to let the larcent die, my {?} treys. A killer changin the game like them Marcy guys. And I been compared to Shyne like Shyne was compared to Biggie. I'm from Compton, he from New York City, c'mon really?. [Chorus]"
fuck wit me,"Yo, it's the nigga with the nasty flow and the clean rag six-four. With the D's spinnin I can bag a ho. Top down so my rag can show, whatever in the dutch. Purple or orange haze it's just a bag of 'dro. Hit snatch with my khakis on, Aladdin Lounge. In Mark Jacobs denim and Don Magli's on. I'm a gangsta and the birds they love it. 20 with a babyface and sit on base like Kirby Puckett. You can't buy a Ferrari fuck it, cop lle' from J. The bricks come with Louis Vuitton luggage. He order rock and cover it, the dimes is free. The quarters is 75, the ball is live. Ain't nobody fumblin on my block. We in the field like Biggs or Marshall Faulk, we runnin the rock. Nothin less than a hundred a pop, anything less you a cop. Shoot you and take your vest and your glock, motherfuckers. [Chorus]. What'chu know about stackin G's; you got to come fuck wit me. Puffin on sticky green; you got to come fuck wit me. My team is just oh so clean; you got to come fuck wit me. What'chu know about stackin G's; you gots to come fuck wit me. [JT]. I'm in the streets like the place is mine, told to cover my tracks. I push paper to increase my shine. I'm on my chief, jumpin out the wagon like Tyco. And get the kind of paper that these niggaz'll die fo'. Bossed out, camouflage under my vest B. Motorbike, fast cars, broads and jetskis. Rule #1, keep your eye on your cash flow. Cause rule #2 will get rid of your best so. None of 'em best show, ridin in stress mode. 'less they got petrol, pushin that Benz slow. Pick up the Game, let's count some cash. Then we, get to the do', then you put on your mask. On some other shit, ridin wit'cha boy now. We on the West coast, seek and destroy now. It's like when Cal-Berkeley whooped on that Georgetown. We had a riot in the streets fin' to blow now fo'sho' now. [Chorus]. [Verse Three - unknown]. The underboss, ill too fast. Buildin my stocks off the blocks and the wears will sag. Not Gil but tryin to top, the nerd Bill Gates. From the city of project buildings and them mossberg K's. San Francisco, West coast, Northern Bay, California. Man it's Get Low so best to toast, or torch'll spray on ya. Uhh, makin mafia moves, skate from the cops. Yeah they tried stoppin ya dude. But nah, the ball, it don't stop. A shot callin if I fall then my thoughts gon' flock. Yeah, underboss with Game and Doc Figgaro. Clear {?} and I'm the in-di-vi-dual. Holdin weight, in the dope state. Tokin the 8-8, oh, fold {?}. Watch our bread and our team skyrocket. Visualize I can rip beam on the cash and not 8 guys can't stop it. [Chorus]"
g.a.m.e,"[The Game]. Live now, die later, flood or clock the shit out of haters. Got niggaz tryin to ""Kiss the Game Goodbye"" like Jada. Get your shit pushed back like Jada's CD. I'll put your brains on that Kenwood TV. So you can see hell in 3D, it's right there dog. And the Game behind the Desert is a nightmare dog. If it's pussy, I might share it dog, beef I'm right here dog. I'm on the block, white Nike Airs on. Gucci check, Coogi sweat, they wanna know. if 22's on the truck, give me coochie yet. But I come through in the new GS with two, three tecs. Got niggaz Harlem Shakin like the new G. Dep. Tryin to read my whole script, but ain't seen the movie yet. Better have that glock stuffed tonight. I'm comin through with Young Noble, and we, gon', make, it. A block bust tonight. [Chorus 2X: The Game]. Getting American Money Easy, all I know. The Gangsta All Motherfuckers Envy, all my dough. It's a West coast knot, watch, let it bang out. Shots range out, for all the gangsta hangouts. [The Game]. Lace your tips, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas. You can't ball? Then it's probably the haters. Can't breathe then it's probably the Desert, if you a gangsta or not. I give a fuck dog, bullets is hot. And every nigga gon' cry when he hit, the more pain. the more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit. And your niggaz ain't gon' ride for shit, they know. if they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit. Red rag or blue rag, niggaz die for this. The Game the reason all these niggaz on that ""Cali Love"" shit. Compton niggaz get grimy too, pull you out of that 6. Fuck you up like one time'll do. And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard. Comin hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw. Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket. You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it. [Chorus]. [Young Noble]. Aiyyo, we left a stain on your block, you came with a cop. Pointin fingers at them niggaz, that kept shit hot. Next to 'Pac, I'm the hottest thang out, homey we can bang out. Outlaw air it out, box 'em in, square it out. Learn about your whereabouts and we right there. Me and Game have you left right there. N-O-B-L-E, O-U-T-L-A-W-Z. We bubble with ease, and I double my cheese. I got niggaz out in Compton that'll find yo' ass. I got niggaz out in Jersey, that'll hide yo' ass. for a long time if you ever fuckin with mine. It's a thin line dog between the real and the fraud. We killin your squad, my homeboy still in the yard. You the type of motherfucker standin next to the God. The Game is deep, you motherfuckers ain't the streets. Young Noble and the homey Game flamin heat, c'mon. [Chorus]"

Keepin it gangsta in a P.D. fitted velour. Late night I'm in Dublin's and I got myself a four. The hood love me, hoodrats gotta hug me. Pop ex, spark the buba, the shit get ugly. Rock the mic anywhere, and I ain't talkin 'bout a concert dog. Talkin 'bout ten niggaz in converts dog. Get it crackin like we out in the yard, and the warden's watchin. Only difference is the whores is watchin. Still love to see a nigga, roll up on 20's. Hop in that six-four, roll up on Bentley's like. I'm a gangsta bay-bee from the C-P-T. Run with the +Pound+ like I'm from DPG. If it's beef, you C-Murder like it ain't No Limit. And I represent the P like Russell Simmons. [Chorus: repeat 2X]. I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right. Got it? Good, okay. It's the Black Sox and Get Low we get dough. In the Yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'. [The Game]. I'm a shining star.

Two gats in my sleeve, two rats in my Beam'. X-5, mami let's ride. Weave in and out of traffic from Compton to Bed-Stuy. It's the kid from the far West I, oh, shit. He know how to do more than flip pies. Get money like them stick up guys. Them ""Ocean 11"" licks got the young kid rich for life. And I talkin 'bout a movie or George Clooney. I'm talkin 'bout, runnin in your spots with uzis tucked in the Coogi. Dude me? Naw truly, might lose your lives. They say I've, got 2K2 covered like A.I.. [Chorus]. [JT]. I know ya, love to watch me, 'specially when I'm lookin rocky. The trey with the broccoli with my handles on the Kawasaki. Handle my jewels with the cuff in my shoes. AD jacket on my elbow, 50 coast the jewels. In my neighborhood I'm Young Bill Gates, never shuffle the cake. So cover my face, and run up in the place. I'm a superstar, dick and my chain, glass bezel and bang. 80 karats on my pinky and rang. Crews buzz when you speakin my name, cause I'm deep in the game. With top cool thangs and million dollar planes. I'm a maniac, young boy gone, like a young Roy Jones. You ought of my zone and ain't nobody home. In my neighborhood, produce stars, stakes is high. Now we soarin through the spacious skies. Drop yo' body with them cakes and ride, the handle is up. Switchin gears with the pedal and ride. [Chorus]"

good girls go bad (feat. drake),"[Game]. Since Big ain't here, I?mma do it for T?yanna. And put roses on the grave for Kanye?s mama. This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen. All the girls that hold it down, gettin? beat on by their man. Respect women, I don?t care if they a 2 or a 10. We don?t beat on Kat Stacks we just bring it to an end. And we don?t wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim. There?s missin? women out there, let?s just focus on them. This song is dedicated to Natalee Holloway. I feel for her Daddy, so I wrote this on Fathers Day. I know she gone, but she ain't far away. I just had a daughter, pass me that cigar ?Ye. I?m about to tell a story, everybody parlay. Sit back, listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way. My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day. So I took my chronic out and slept in the hallway. I learned this the hard way. When police came our way, my daddy had his act on. Like it never happened: (Broadway). Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you. Now my mama good, nigga, she ain?t gotta deal wit? ya. You want some money? Nigga I ain't get a deal wit? ya. You ain't sayin? nothin?, you like a still picture. You better thank God you still breathing air cause. You coulda went out, like ya boy Steve Mcnair. [Hook]. Don?t make the good girls go bad, no. Don?t make the good girls go bad, no (I, won't). If you don't, you gon? really love us (I said I won't). Please don?t use us, dooon?t. [Drake]. Good evening, I?m in Chicago at the Elysian. With some girls that say they models, but hmm? I don?t believe ?em. Who?s still gettin? tested?. Wheres all the women at, could still remember who they slept with?. Where?s all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list?. But when you do go out, you still working with what you was blessed with. Do it girl, I?ll be your King, be a Queen Latifah. I love ya ass like Milhouse love Lisa. I love ya ass like the ninja turtles love pizza. Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of. You got it girl, this song remind me of Kat from Philly. A girl I used to love but still she started acting silly. Her hearts a lil? chilly, she a little too carefree. In 10 years, who?s paying for all that therapy. Umm, nigga not me!. Yeah, I?m probably not the man you take me for. But I bet I could be if you make me yours. Most of the shit I say is true. When I?m done with bad bitches I?m coming straight to you. Good girl. [Hook]. Don?t make the good girls go bad, no. Don?t make the good girls go bad, no. If you don't, you gon? really love us. Please don?t use us, dooon?t. [Game - Verse 3]. Drizzy, I?m sittin here watchin? Basketball Wives. Like ugh, them is basketball wives?. Only cute one, Gloria, thats my nigga Matt Barnes chick. Can?t swim in that poon fool, thats a crucial conflict. Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with. And never buy a chick a bag on the first day. Or pop a bottle with her on her birthday. And tell her ass, get on. That type of shit?ll get you spit on. I don?t hit on girls, I just hit on girls. Like ?hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy world?. ?Get busy girl, drink that Rose til you dizzy girl?. She walking round the club all lost like ?where is he, girl??. He on the top of the charts next to Beyonce. Right under Kanye, so let the Dom spray. Thats your girl, nigga go on make her cry. Soon as you do, I?m pulling up in that Porsche, like ?let's ride?. [Hook]. Don?t make the good girls go bad, no. Don?t make the good girls go bad, no. If you don't make the good girls go bad, no. Don?t make the good girls go bad, no. If you don't, you gon? really love us. Please don?t use us, dooon?t. [Game - Outro]. Word on the news stand, Alicia got herself a man. And thats my nigga Swizzy, know you see Game and Drizzy. Surrounded by them diamonds, Imma cold mackin. Nigga its a cold climate, don?t ask me where the crime went. Just tell me where them dimes went. So I can get em fitted, let em beat a bridesmaid at the wedding for my niggas. Yeah I?m married to the game. And she married to my chain, watching Boys In The Hood. let's take a drive down memory lane."

You roll deep but when I see you it's just you and your kids. I roll sick, my rims feel like helicopter propellers. And my pockets run deep like a Mercer teller.

And my niggaz'll put you under the street. We gangsters nigga; so you better watch what you say. 'Fore I empty the whole glock in your face. [Sean T]. Streets is tough, but ain't no hopscotch lines on the ground. Just burner shells, and police siren sounds. Niggaz know who I am in the town; it ain't a circus. But it might as well be, cause you know I'ma clown. I'm a terrain boss, I know most niggaz envious dawg. And if a nigga owe me change you better give me it dawg. If you feelin like you wanna leap, make like a frog. You niggaz lame, transparent like Wonder Woman's plane. I'm a stunna in this game, a federal figure.

hate it or love it,"[50 Cent]. Ya, let's take em back. Uh huh. Comin up I was confused my momma kissin a girl. Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world. Daddy ain't around probably out commitin felonies. My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody. I wanna live good, so should I sell dope for a fo-finger ring. Money and them gold ropes. Santa told me if I pass could get a sheep skin coat. If I can move a few packs and get the hat, now that'd be dope. Tossed and turned in my sleep at night. Woke up the next morning niggas done stole my bike. Different day same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood. I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could. [Chorus (50 then Game):]. Hate it or love it the underdog's on top. And I'm gonna shine homely until my heart stop. Go head' envy me. I'm raps MVP. And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me. Hate it or love it the underdog's on top. And I'm gonna shine homely until my heart stop. Go head' envy me. I'm raps MVP. And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me. [Game]. On the grill of my lowrider. Guns on both sides right above the gold wires. I'll fo-five em. Kill a nigga on my song but really do it. Thats the true meaning of a ~ghostwriter~. 10 g'z will take ya daughter out of Air Forces. Believe you me homie i know all bout losses. I'm from Compton where the wrong colors be cautious. One phone call will have ya body dumped in Marcy. I stay strapped like car seats. Been bangin since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkley's. That's 10 years I told Pooh in 95' I'd kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95s. Told Banks when i met him imma ride. And if I gotta die rather homicide. I ain't have 50 Cent when my Grandmomma died. Now i'm goin back to Cali with my Jacob on. See how time fly?. [Chorus - 50 Cent]. From the beginnin to the end. Losers lose, winners win. This is real we ain't got to pretend. The cold world that we in. Is full of pressure and pain. Enough of me nigga now listen to Game. [Game]. Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench. Now i'm fuckin with ~5-0~ it's all startin to make ~sense~. My moms happy she ain't gotta pay the rent. And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz. Waitin on Sha Money to land sittin in the Range. Thinkin how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes. When there's kids starvin. Pac is gone and Brendas still throwin babies in the garbage. I wanna know what's goin on like i hear Marvin. No school books they use that wood to build coffins. Whenever I'm in the booth and i get exhausted. I think what if Marie Banker got that abortion. I love ya Ma'.

I got the ""411"", what's crackin'. What I owe you for helpin' me go four times Platinum. I add a kid to ""My Life"", he's almost two. I guess what I'm tryin' to say is thank you. For over ten years of the ghetto gospel. You've paved the way for young black women to prosper. How you paint pictures you deserve Grammys and Oscars. Congratulations for me, Aftermath, and the Doctor. So niggaz go 'head and envy me. I'm Billboard's Top 10 featuring M.J.B.. [Mary J. Blige]. When you learn stepped in this game. After ""What's The 411?"", things ain't been the same. And I can't complain. But with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain. But I'm so glad to be here. And my music's still sincere. Lets get back to the story. All of this pain and glory. And 94 was ""My Life"" and my life wasn't right. So I reached out to you and told you what I've been through. [Chorus: 50 Cent] + Mary J..

And I came and ""Shared My World"". But at that point I was just a foolish girl. Tryin to find my way. And I dropped a ""Mary"" album and people would say. That it's just not gonna work and my feelings they did hurt. But my fans showed me so much love and I owe it all to them. Then I came with ""No More Drama"", I remember that week. It was when Aaliyah died, I couldn't hardly sleep. Thought about it every day. And it made me change my ways. I'm a real woman, now because of all of these days. [Chorus: 50 Cent] + Mary J.. (Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top. and I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop). Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen. and I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me.

""You Remind Me"" of a ""Real Love"". You don't have to worry (""Real Love""). ""All Night Long"" ""I'm Goin' Down"". Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-dahh. Do-do-do-do-do-dahh. ""Reminisce"" on the love we had. ""You Are Everything"" ""Love Without A Limit"". What are you gonna do without ""My Life, My Life, My Life, My Life"". [Chorus: 50 Cent] + Mary J.. (Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top. and I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop). Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen. and I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me.

Murder game cold as Aspen, body found in the trash bin. First 48, they don't find me, case closed. Like a rehabilitation spot in Bobby Brown nose.

I still pull it, still bully niggas on the strip. Beef, I cook it fully with the fifth. And I ain't got no pets, I put a bullet in ya bitch. A nigga with a gun in his hand who won't bust it?. Like a bitch with a dick in her hand who won't suck it. This is the art of war, you niggas just drawing. Anything I target on is dearly departed, gone. Drive by or walk up on --. I just stop, breathe, aim cock squeeze. Silencer on the Glock, infrared beam. Put your block up on machines while the pussies run and scream"

Even if she had Ashanti butt naked in bed. cause she got a forehead just like Tyra. I can say what the fuck I want, you thought Dre retired. Left me in 6-4 his Dayton wires. These niggaz is a waste of rhymin, Doc got somthing to say be quiet. [Dr. Dre]. Look out for Detox. [Chorus]. [Bridge]"
holy water,"[Hook]. My Phantom so mean like. I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water. My Jesus piece clean, even my shoes are Christians,. I'm walking on holy water. She came out them. True Religion jeans and fell straight to her knees. like she was dipped in holy water. Holy water, holy water. [Verse 1]. Back when Michael Jordan was raw. '92 was the year my city was city of God. Coke on the boulevard, crack fiends skiing the slaloms. Is exactly how drug lords found their way from the bottom. Them Yeezy's drop got ?em, couldn't afford ?em you shot ?em. Cause they the same price as fucking red bottoms. We don't pop tags, leave that motherfucker on it. Return it back to the store when you no longer want it. Sleep outside for days for a pair of J's. The you sleep outside forever cause you got sprayed. If you gon' die for em, they better be some number 4?s. Or some shit made in Japan you can never find in the stores. Rolex watches, Gucci belts, and Louis luggage. Definitely set us apart from niggas when we in public. Jeffery Campbell and Michael Kors got you looking rugged. Gave her a Louis bag, now she love me. Take a look at her posin' on my car cause. [Hook]. My Phantom so mean like. I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water. My Jesus piece clean, even my shoes are Christians,. I'm walking on holy water. She came out them. True Religion jeans and fell straight to her knees. like she was dipped in holy water. Holy water, holy water. [Verse 2]. Met a girl named Christian in some Christian, she a Christian. Suck a dick like sucking dick is her life's mission. Trynna' save her ass like trynna' save a stripper. She fine as fuck, you trynna' fuck, that's the reason you tip her. And all I'm sayin' is a watch and a gold chain. Can't make Bobby Valentino, Johnny Coltrane. And she knows this, that's why her mouth wide. Openin' up her legs straight up like they suicide. I cross my heart and hope to die. If something happens to my voice and can no longer provide. Should I run and hide? No. hustle and survive. Workin' 9 to 5 until sweat drips into my eyes. And if it burns like the kush, then I go back to sellin' pies. Switchin' lanes in that Cutlass, rubbin' her thighs while I drive. Reminiscin' on the days I was rollin' broke. Jesus piece on the rearview, holy ghost. Amen!. [Hook]. My Phantom so mean like. I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water. My Jesus piece clean, even my shoes are Christians,. I'm walking on holy water. She came out them. True Religion jeans and fell straight to her knees. like she was dipped in holy water. Holy water, holy water"

[Game]. No more Bleek and Buddens I was hopin' for silence. Till the little sleeping beauty, went and woke the giant. This little bitch from The Luniz want beef he liein'. So I called E-40, and tried to seize the violence. I got niggaz on the island, for puttin' in stainless work. With vaseline on they palms, gettin' ready to +Bang Em Smurf+ (you little bitch).

I got fish to fry, throw a line in the pacific. With cocaine on the hook, for this +Luniz+ ass nigga. You a bitch, how you call your self the Ice Cream Man. When Master P took your name and your ice cream van. Made 500 million, that's your homey though. Took your man hood, gave your shit to Lil'Romeo. This nigga, 5 foot 2, talkin' that big shit. You got +5 On It+? that money went to Chris Hicks. Tryin' to diss Too $hort for doin' his pimp shit. Nigga you been gitten fucked, swallowin' big dicks. Pac knew he was a pussy, that's why he ran south. Signed to Rap-A-Lot, they never put his ass out. Hid behind Lil' J, all the sudden you thugged out. Ran back to the Bay, sleepin' on wannabe cuz couch. How you drop 5 albums, don't own one house. Or get the boss to call me, Banks, and fuck out. It's G-Unit bitch, let me show you what blood bout. When my blood pressure rise, I bring the bloods out. Put the barrell on his neck, blow his guts out (*gunshot). Now that's whats you call a +Yukmouth+. [Outro: Game].

i'm a king,"[50 Cent]. I never said anything, I never take anything back. [Young Buck]. Well you kinda heard me speaking. ""You ain't a crip like Snoop, you ain't a blood like Game"". And I was speaking on Game without knowing him. but now, you know alot of these dudes jump in the game. and they rap artists, and that's exactly what they is. but they not what they say they are when they rap it. [T.I.]. Everybody wanna be the king of the south when. they ain't runnin the damn thing with they mouth. no doubt, it's all good, y'all just stay in y'all opinions. but in the South and in the hood it's understood without saying. it's a given, and it ain't cause what I'm doin for a livin'. it's more because of what I'm doin how I'm livin. not to mention when I'm rappin, I'm just hurtin niggaz feelings. And still chillin on somethin that's into healing. Man, permissions from the Click to continue to keep it pimpin'. but while the crack was in the house, the record sale went thru the ceiling. so say what you want, and do what you please. but for fun I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees. I run a record label and a crew of G's. so niggaz'll come and look for you if you sneeze. or even breathe the wrong way. you better do what the song say and be easy, else it'll be a long day. I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans. I'm a king - you pussy niggaz couldn't see me in your dreams. I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines. I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team. I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off. I'm a king - a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off. I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the South. I'm a king - just respect it and keep my name out'cha mouth. (The Game). Everybody wanna be the King of the West. but, they ain't runnin the damn thing in the West. that's to bad, it's all good, they just speakin they minds. stand on top of the Hollywood sign, you can see that it's mine. I'd rather die, motherfucker, than give up my throne. my crown is a Dodger fitted, California's my home. and it's known when the drama pop off, I bring the chrome. so nigga leave me alone, 'fore I start living my songs. I made a killin drug dealin, some people say I'm a villain. went from choppin' in the house, to the top of rap gettin millions. so watch your mouth, unless you ready to bleed. cause to me, murderin wack mc's is somethin like a disease. top down in the Impala, so I can ride in the breeze. and where I'm from, niggaz throwin up B's and C's. so make a turn the wrong way, think about what the song say. and be easy, else it'll be a long day.

i'm a mobsta,"Yeah! What is it? It's Young Menace, and the Game. (Hahaha, yeah) Stackin chips, G-Unit (Chuck Taylor). Doublin down on who? (Compton's young guns). Sacramenton's finest (Who fuckin with me?). From Sac-Town to Compton, you dig?. [The Game]. Yo, yo, now ain't no tellin what the Game'll do, listen dawg. I blow the guts out the dutch and do the same to you. And just to get shit crackin, I drop the toaster. Grab the Louis go Sammy Sosa. And you ain't gotta know me to know that, I hop out a new pink Rolls. With the fifty-two Pete Rose throwback. Haze in my eyes, listen to Bobby Womack. On the same corner where Eazy-E sold coke at. And dawg I'ma test your education. What do I mean when I say I move more birds than migration?. I'm the nigga that'll smoke the purple, get high as a kite. Down half the Goose then choke your workers. Don't make me put two in your shirt, dawg I put in the work. Then move bags like Doony & Bert. And stuff work in the GMC, cause on my block. I'm the King of Rock like Run-D.M.C., nigga. [Chorus: Young Menace]. I'm a mobster, with a mac-11 chopper. That'll pop ya and put one through ya motherfuckin collar. I'm a mobster, Robin Hood's like Kevin Costner. If ya fuck with my dollars I'll make you swallow my daughters. I'm a mobster, I keep a bitch by my waist. Just in case I gotta draw down to get this big face. I'm a mobster, uh-huh, yeh-yeah. I'm a mobster, uh-huh, yeh-yeah. [Young Menace]. Shhhhh.. I got a lot to say. Dawg I gotta get paid that's why I rock the lle'. And chop the lle' to push bricks through your block a day. I'll bring terror to your squad and make you rock away. Don't depend on tomorrow you can get shot today. I'll spit acid on your turf and watch your block decay. Dawg I spit on your grave and fertilize you too. I hit 'em hard with 16 bars, flames and fumes. Somebody needs to push your infant rap back in the womb. Go 'head and keep talkin that shit and get your life consumed. I put a hole in your chest dawg the size of the moon. Yeah you musta been talkin, how'd you get out that soon?. (You fuckin snitch!) I got a chop that'll touch yo' head like Vidal Sassoon. You don't wanna see my platoon, I got gorillas and baboons. That won't hesitate, they gon' do what they have to. When there's beef on the streets it's on for life like tattoos. [Chorus]. [Verse Three]. It don't matter what season, it don't matter not a day. I move traffic through the city, plus I keep the right of way. I'm on point like Bibby, I'm the leader of the team mayne. Got the whole city amped just like a Lakers versus Kings game. Everybody's fired up, I drop major packages. I'm never doin bids because my game is so immaculate. A bitch try to snitch, ""I Can't Deny It"" like Fabolous. Before the evidence gatherin, someone's in an ambulance. Now that'll learn you to keep your big mouth shut. Those with big mouths I got the perfect size nuts. Yeah I do my dirt, but I wash my hands thoroughly. Handle my business first so I can celebrate early. It's business before pleasure my business brings me pleasure. It feels good to be able to shine, in any type of weather. That's why I do what I gotta do so my money's lookin tight. Whether I'm jukin on the block or have bitches hookin lights y'know?. [Chorus]"

Thats why I love the hood and everything we got. From the ice cream trucks to the fourty ounce tops. All white Air Force Ones to fake Jacob watch. A few reasons why I drive the Bently hard top. Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block. Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch. I'm that type of nigga yall made my city bigger dawg. Turn the TV off got tired of watchin Jigga boss. So we told our mom's we was lookin for jobs. When we was really in the record store lookin for Nas. Project of the ghetto, Ghetto and the project.

Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it. Everybody know eachother if not they realated. You can get shot or get bladed. Theres dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties. Six months five years for you just to cop out. Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out. Fights break out when you wired and start joking. Alot of OG's retired and started smokin. House party games of spade sweet kool-aid. Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid. So therefore I could never be too paid. I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid. [Dre].

i'm looking,"[The Game]. I'm from Compton where them guns bust, watch Poppa George pop. Cats tellin jokes at them car games. Seen big face hundreds, handle the rock like Nate Archibald. What? This nigga only sixteen. And I wanted to be, just like him, middle school fightin. Any nigga with a chip on his shoulder, whattup nigga?. You want beef with me? Now I let the heat speak for me. No more talkin, just outline chalkin. Nigga Witta Attitude from birth, ""100 Miles and Running"". Gunnin bustin shots like fuck the cops. Notorious for burnin blocks, weavin in and out of traffic and chop. Game the young Robin Hood of the block. Steal from the rich, give to the poor, coward niggaz rock. Second comin of this black Alfred Hitchcock. Kick in the door, wavin the four-four. Ten shots to your spleen, let them violins sing. [Chorus: Blue Chip] + (The Game). Yo, I'm just a ghetto nigga stuck in this game, young'uns runnin with 'caine. Rain hits so we floodin the game. When you come to Compton respect the grounds, leave you shook man. (And I look good, from Compton to Brooklyn). Hey yo I don't give a fuck who you are, fuck ya ice. Fuck the block that you claim, fuck your Bentley Azure. (Dead presidents is all I represent). ('Til y'all met me y'all niggaz ain't met gangsta yet). [The Game]. Fast cars, money and muscle, the hustle I was brought up in the 80's. Gangbangin, dope traffic, shit get crazy. From where niggaz grow up hard like dicks raised. Them hustlin guns like Knicks players, we got mouths to feed. 'Til they put flowers on me, moms kiss my cold cheek. In that pine box, I'm buyin rocks, eyein cops. Fuck a cell block, the young kid makin it happen. Who you think got them fiends runnin back like Bo Jackson?. I'm a gangsta, what else could I say?. I'm ahead of myself like it's Y4K. 2Pac, Scarface, N.W.A.. Taught me how to dodge them bullets, keep my wig in play. Keep fo' snug in the waist or pay a thousand to have 'em. Niggaz in the street move faster than, Michael Jackson's album. But the shit don't really matter to me, we get better G. Bet the four slow 'em down like PCP. [Chorus]. [The Game]. Real gangsters never talk shit, handle they business. Fuck the dry snitchin and bitchin, niggaz die when them bullets fly. Who fuckin with him, ha? Not a nigga alive. End up dead in that 5. He got no sympathy for them dead guys, friend or foe. Watch that chest cave in, what that vest savin?. Make it sloppy for the autopsy, leave my enemies in a frenzy. On the frontlines holdin a 9. Everyday a new chapter, my own niggaz plottin on me. Tryin to hit me but they won't get me, feel the semi first. Fuckin with my dough, is the worst way to go. Y'all know, niggaz cry when them bullets burn slow dummy. In and out of spots watchin my money. If one dollar come up missin bodies start to come up missin. No one too heavy for the Expedition, piss on your corpse. Watch your soul shiver, throw him in the river, bitch nigga. [Chorus]"
i'm the king,"[Hook]. I'm the King. And I be smoking. Welcome to my town. And I be smoking, (x2). If I say we on one nigga. Then we on. And if I say we gone my nigga. Then we gone.

in the city,"I was forced to be a gang banger. On the cover of the source with my chain. Hanging, and that was '05. Still fuck benzino, riding through the city in them twin benz. Stepping on c-notes, rollin red dice like casinos. Throwing shots like free-throws. Tell judas I'm alive and well. Will I be crucified only time can tell. Well till then I'm thugging. Spend my money on whatever. Running through this cheddar. As long as my crew together. Pop ace, pop tags, pop hammers. ""Thug life"" I put that on pac's bandana. Los angeles king, tell my niggas. In the I blacked out the card. And minimized the bling. Updated the ghost with nas on the way. Gangster living. The playas had the the dough. So the girls brought the freaks. Every single night we did it again. We had a good time, we had a good time. In the city. I was forced to be a farce. Diamonds in my cross. The cost for me to floss. Got me exhausted. Got me wide awake, just make sure. That my wallets caked while away. Got banana clips in the big apple homie ""su cartel"". Eh game what it look like. I got the shorty and I'm playing. With her chest in the corner look like a rug rat. The city that never sleeps. Now we ain't talking bout money you never spitting. We generated revenue. Old heads put me on. The things that we never knew. Word to my moms there it's hard. To be a giant just ask tom brady. This why they pay me when. They ask who the best. Right now they say me, fred in the game"
intro,"[A Man]. Alot of people are advocated that the rich gets richer and the. poor gets poorer.. Thats only because you dont understand. whats going to happen to you, you see its all just a game ladies. and gentlemen,. and the quality of your living depends entirely upon your. ability to play the game,. and i play the game......."
it must be me,"*[Intro]. Let's make it big, Pharrell.... [Verse 1]. Wake up in the morning, oh shit!. Had to cock the 9, niggas' tryin' to steal my pits. Went out the back door, see them niggas hit the fence. I'm telling you, life in Compton is a bitch. Let off a couple shots, God damn, I miss. Say fuck it anyway, and let off the whole clip. I'm not to be fucked with, when I'm off liquor. Old English in my system, 'bout to kill me a nigga. See, I remember back in the days, loadin' my Ak. Ridin' 'round in my Impala with my lungs full of haze. That's when I didn't give a fuck, now I got my son. Shoot a nigga, he die, public enemy number one. But, this ain't no action flick, no Johnny Depp shit. When the Tec spit hollow tips in your Lexus. So. Don't fuck with a Compton nigga when he packin' the gat. Yeah, nigga, I stay strapped. [Chorus]. Somethin' hot in here. Nigga, it must be me! (x2). Is it the shades? Is it the J's?. Is it the Bentley with the full color ways. Or the old-school sittin' on blades. What could be?. [Verse 2]. It's 2-o'-clock in the afternoon, I'm 'bout to roll a Swisher. 'Cause that's what real niggas do when they at home. Watchin' Espn on the 70-inch flat screen. K-Gs and Wade jerseys, blowin' chronic, that green. Gave up the hoop dreams, bubble with the crack dreams. Turn hood zombies into a Olympic track team. 'Till I got shot, and infiltrated the rap scene. Had to clean my life up, doc gave me the vaccine. Don't get it twisted, I still click-clack things. Red beam attached to each and every strap. That I keep locked up in my basement. If I shoot a nigga, will the Lord forgive Jason?. I don't know, still got a sick fetish for shoot-outs and car chases. Fuck Pacino, 'cause we know niggas with scarfaces. And we go back, like D-Boys and small faces. And we crashin' new Ferraris while ya'll hatin'. Pharrell I think it's. [Chorus]. Somethin' hot in here. Nigga, it must be me! (x2). Is it the shades? Is it the J's?. Is it the Bentley with the full color ways. Or the old-school sittin' on blades. What could it be?. You know the answer, fool. [Verse 3]. Niggas cain't fuck with me, real spit. I guess I am a motherfucking legend, Will Smith. All I'm missin' is a bitch like Jada, Bonnie & Clyde shit. Hit the fence like later, sayonara, arrivederci. Black rose Phantom, interior hearse shit. And I got some kisses from a couple Brooklyn bitches. Them hoes'll never testify, peace to Common. But Game keep it hood like weaves and Top Ramen. Never stop coming for the top. If the bass a flesh wound and Pharrell a head shot. Motherfucker, and when he take aim. Bullets enter your frame, my bars simi-lar. To a dragon swalloin' flames. Cain't walk through the club and take a piss. Without these new school rap niggas on my dick. While you fuck around with your jewelry and all your whips. I pull up with your bitch pumpin' gangsta shit. Now you know. [Chorus]. Somethin' hot in here. Nigga, it must be me! (x2). Is it the shades? Is it the J's?. Is it the Bentley with the full color ways. Or the old-school sittin' on blades. What could it be?. You know the answer, fool. Do ya thing, shawty.

it's okay (one blood),"[Intro]. Dre, I see dead people. Yo Dre, thought I was dead. West Coast. [Verse 1]. I'm the doctor's advocate, nigga Dre shot cha. Brought me back from the dead, that's why they call him the Doctor. The Math gonna drop him and 50 ain't rockin. With him no more, It's okay, I get it poppin. Whole club rockin like a 6-4 Impala. Drink Cris', throw it up, call the shit hydraulics. Then piss in a cup, call the shit Hypnotiq. I bleed Compton, spit crack and shit Chronic. And you new niggaz ain't shit but new niggaz. Bathing Ape shoe niggaz, I'm talking to you niggaz. Bounce in the 6-4, throwing up Westside man. Sell another five million albums, Yes I am. Fresh like damn, this nigga did it again. A hundred thousand on his neck, La above the brim. Inside the lambo, shotgun with snoop. What would the motherfuckin' west coast be without one crip and. [Chorus]. One blood {*4x*}. Blood {*9x*}. One blood {*4x*}. [Verse 2]. I'm from the west side of the 6-4 Impala. Where niggaz say where you from, we don't ever say holla. Bandana on the right side, gun on the left side. Niggaz in New York know how to throw up the west side. Word to Eazy, I'm so ill, believe me. I made room for Jeezy, but the rest of you niggaz. Better be glad you breathin, All I need is one reason. I'm the king and Dre said it, the west coast need me. I don't know why you niggaz keep tryin me. Everybody know that I'm the aire to the Aftermath dynasty. And I ain't gotta make shit for the club. What Dj gonna turn down a 38 snub. You 38 and you still rappin? Ugh. I'm 26 nigga, so is the doves. In the '07 Hummer, hop out, nobody dodge. When the chronic smoke clear, all you gonna hear is. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. I ain't got beef with 50, no beef with Jay. What's beef when you getting head in the 6-Tre. And the double game chains, I keep 'em on display. Black t-shirt so all you see is the A. Turn on the Tv and all you see is the A. You niggaz better make up a dance and try and get radio play. Keep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away. I don't regret what I spit cause I know what I say. And niggaz talking bout me, they don't know when to stop. I got the Louis Vuiton beltbuckle holding the glock. No bean, no silencer, I know when to pop. Wait til Lil' Jon come on and let off a shot. I had the number 1 billboard spot. Niggaz stepped on my fingers and I climbed right back to the top. I'm Big, I'm Cube, I'm Nas, I'm Pac. This ain't shit but a warning until my album drops. [Chorus] - 2x"

jackin' for beats,"Straight outta Compton, Chuck Taylor in Brooklyn 8 deep. And the Desert Storm blew in Ghetto F-A-B. The only difference between us. Is the coast and the length of the ninas. And the rainbow paint on the beamers. Out here they call me ""All Star Game"". And every nigga with a gun is waiting on the '04 All Star Game. So while you in the Staples parking lot. I'm watchin the corners, with the safety on like Ronnie Lott. [Fabolous]. Straight outta Brooklyn it's the same youngan. Slangin that same onion. Smokin that Cali bud that my nigga Game brung in. I keep a dame tongue on my dick. The chain huggin my dick. The cane brung by the brick, it's ghetto!. The fiends sprung on me quick. But I still got 20s of dope that'll have yo brain strung on a fix. These haters can't stop the rock I pushes. Cause a nigga move around with more arms than them octipusses, nigga. [The Game]. I got a winchester that will turn your vest into confeddi. I'm Chuck Taylor, the same nigga that put the 6-4 in Chevy. It's the same nigga that keep the .44 in the Chevy. With no stash spot, when you in Compton ask coppers. If that Aston Martin's the same color as grass hoppers. I'm runnin the rock, not J, Dame Dash of Hoffa. So when you in Compton, you know who to ask for. That 21 year old young gun with bricks in the Jaguar, nigga. [Fabolous]. The kid push Bentley exaust thru. And if you see my guns you would think Bush sent me to war too. Even with chicks beggin me for dick regularly. A nigga known for gettin rid of weight like Dick Gregory. I'm New York City's fly guy, you bums don't impress me. I already got the lead waitin for someone to test me. You don't wanna be in the news. Cause when I'm lookin for you. Not even Bin Laden wanna be in your shoes, nigga. [The Game]. Every ghetto in America, I know that niggaz lettin clips fly. So I keep that in mind when I'm out in the N-Y. Niggaz see the Aftermath chain they like f... 50. Cause we flyin thru Queens in that Ferarri F-50. Bitches see me in the video, wanna have sex with me. So keep a box of Magnums and a bag of X with me. Keep a .38 Magnum stashed in the vette with me. And it's 'fuck yo life' if you ain't signin check with me. [Fabolous]. Nigga I'm eatin, and you be snackin like you on a diet. That's why you window shoppin actin like you wanna buy it. Actin like you gonna roit, like you gonna shoot. When in fact you gone be quiet, like you on mute. That's proof, you a punk, and you lucky. There ain't enough room to fit a nigga in my roof or the trunk. I got a box to quickly hide the gun. You shouldn't move if you seen Boyz N The Hood. And when Ricky tried to run. [The Game]. Niggaz know when them hollows airin. I'll turn your Antoine Walker into a throwback Robert Parrish. With 2 holes under the Celtic. And you will think your 'Boston Warm-Up' jacket hot. Till the desert eagle melt it. I'm a gangsta, and the birds, they love it. 20 with a baby face, and sit on base like Kirby Puckett. If you can't afford the new Bentley, fuck it!. Copp yay from Jay, the bricks come with Louis Vuitton luggage. [Fabolous]. In my hood the slower you move, the quicker they get you. Sometimes it's somebody in your click that be with you. That's why my vest is thicker to get thru. And I keep 2 nines on my shirt like Dickersons shit do. Why waste my breath when I'm bickering with you. I'd rather waste my techs till they flicker and hit you. You sick cause my shit blew. And you ain't goin' nowhere for a while. A commercial where Snickers will fit you, fucka!. [The Game]. Ain't nothin but a gangsta party when I'm spittin to Pac. The paint fall off your Miskeen when I'm spittin the Glock. Before I was 16, I was liftin the drop. Spittin on cops, pitchin the rock. Like Charlie Ward before the New York Knicks. Now you can catch me in Brooklyn with Fab. On a New York bench, while you old niggaz in rehab. And if I can't be a hip-hop legend, I'll just die in a ski-mask. [Fabolous]. When a gangsta like me ride. It be suede in it, be shades in it. Tires that got the rims that Spree made in it. 1 of the prettiest hoes be laid in it. Blowin the kid faster than pre-paid minutes. And I'm guessin these haters. Don't know I keep Wesson & 8ters. Fully loaded with the vest penetrators. But if they want it, ya'll can get it. Ya'll love the way the coast to coast G's did it, nigga!"
jesus piece (feat. common & kanye west),"[Verse 1: Game]. Tell 'em pray for me. It was God that brought Dre to me. Even brought the nigga Kanye for me. Bless - but them niggas shot Big. Made a nigga feel ashamed of the the city where he live. Make a nigga hate the logo on the Dodger cap. Thinking back to that beamer, wish my nigga Pac was strapped. But I'm dreaming Las Vegas Boulevard, Afeni's son's bullet scars. Everybody king of Diamonds until the feds pull they cards. Not the deck though. Hip Hop was better off when it was just Dre, Scarface, and Esco. Memoirs of the gold chain. It's a cold game nigga, Johnny Coltrane. Black Versaces with the gold frame. Nigga said he sold 'caine that's a bold claim. 14 had a brain that could throw flames. So strange, have to blow they mind, Cobain. [Hook: Game & Kanye West]. Mama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah. Them niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah. Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah. Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah). Lord willin', I see a billion. 'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece). Throw them suicide doors up. And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece). [Verse 2: Game]. That's the crack music, nigga. Never spit a verse cause I was making trap music, nigga. I'm not an army, I'm a movement. The flow is water, Andre tried to Ice Cube him. Ice Cubin', roof translucent. Chick on my side tryna get my Trues loose. When I'm talkin' 'bout God, she 'posed to bow her head. Now she all on the blog, steady postin' 'bout her head. Got me thinking like a father, is the world safe?. Got me clinging to my daughter like shark fins in water. Rocks in my ears something Titanic. This is my life and it's exactly how I planned it, damn it. God says everything happens for a reason. I seen four seasons at The Four Seasons. Take that chinchilla off, poor kids is freezing. Cookin' up in the same pot they ain't got to pee in. [Hook: Game & Kanye West]. [Verse 3: Common]. Pieces on gold leashes. Cruisers, around greases make them cohesive. I'm the sun shining with God features. Draw closer to a true blood bleeder, soul of a southern preacher. Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders. We throw the peace up, knowing the world need us. Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights. To sacrifices we made it's sorta Christ-like. At the after party thinking what the afterlife's like. He paid for my sins, is it really priced right?. Fuck it, I see the light, raw Stacy delight. Can't deny my Jesus piece that's so Peter-like. Chicks crow for dough, get low for mo'. A combo she end up at the condo. Another Jane Doe or a golden angel. Pendant on an angle, watch the chain glow. [Hook: Game & Kanye West]"

just beginning (where i'm from),"Sometimes I wonder. Man, how long is it gon' be for my people to come out. Man we strugglin, it's hard sometimes, but. Tomorrow's better than yesterday, uhh. [The Game]. I was, born in the slums, struggled from day one. Ray Charles vision, blinded by the light from the sun. No navigation, no sense of direction, darker complexion. made it hard to live; dad, how you fathered your kids?. Stranded on the highway of life, left us out to die, left us out to dry. Shhhh, I'm still here, my mother's cries. Nigga no father figures make harder niggaz. Through the years, went to war with niggaz from what I saw in the picture. Now your son is bigger, 13, but just like you. Moms said I would grow up and be just like you. From what you did to my sister she disliked you. Sixteen, eleventh grade, look at me just like you. Gunnin for riches, runnin hoppin project fences. Street corners to Arizona, how I earn my digits. And I'm far from finished, gamin 'til my coffee diminish. Why pray for the afterlife when mines just beginnin, huh. [The Game]. Only son by our mother, no brothers, only sisters by this one. Every time I kissed one I missed one, let me explain. Eight years before the game, everything came with pain. Watch the fate of my family slain would never see good times a-gayn. Cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame. My father, that have the same name as his father. My grandfather wouldn't believe, he pulled up our family tree. I can see him rollin over in his coffin. I'm left with often, thoughts of how could you molest your daughter. They say that's ten times worse than manslaughter. Man you oughta, be dead in a grave. But it wasn't my call, so instead you sat in a cage. High-powered, two-hundred and fifty pound, six-five coward. Woulda been dead in an hour. Heard you was scared to take a shower, scared of the yard. Your end is near, you shoulda been scared of God, motherfucker"

Wanna be, wanna see, wan' get a shovel. dig Tookie up nigga, cause he know gangstas. Niggaz think cause they watched ""Menace"" a couple times. Seen Cube in ""Boyz N the Hood"" and pressed rewind.

Just stay the fuck up outta my hood. where my niggaz take you up outta yo' shine. It ain't a movie dawg, hell yeah this a real fuckin uzi dawg.

Where I'm from it's only two things. standin on the corner, me and that liquor store. Look what the Bloods did to Weezy, look what the Crips did to Jeezy. This gangbangin shit ain't nothin to play with. Me and Snoop Dogg just made it look easy. [Chorus]. [Outro: The Game]. Y'all niggaz got this L.A. shit real fucked up man. Niggaz better start respectin what the fuck we about man. We take niggaz the fuck out, this shit ain't no movie dawg. This shit is real - Crips, Bloods, Ese's. We hold shit down, this L.A..

let us live (feat. chrisette michele),"Yeah, Scott Storch. [The Game]. Yo I'm hoping out a Phantom with a' iced out medallion. Stallions on both arms, rocks on both charms. My Dominican chick looking like Scarface sister. Red and curly and she wake me up early. Cus hustlers hit the block when police change shifts. New York, California different toilet, same shit. In Brooklyn I rock Timberlands. Still toast cinnamon. Been gangster way before he dropped many men. Liquor in my system, voice raspy who I sound like?. Don't ask me that's my nigga we classy. Him and Montega Jada our style superior to haters. You can catch me in the latest Marvin Gaters. Ralph Lauren suit tape it up fly cause I'm papered up. Why these niggas keep hating on my Phantom. I be out in Atlanta and body tapping I'm probably strapped. Toast it up niggas. [Chorus: Chrisette Michelle]. All my hoods on the real dark side of the track. No sunny sky's just really black. We live real down here, Lord let us live. No playing around here, Lord let us live. Don't hate my hood just hate my shine. We coming out we on our grind. We live real down here, Lord let us live. We coming outta here, Lord let us live. [The Game]. Now who the fuck want war with the human gun store?. Gangsta rap is where I live just knock on the front door. Niggas stunt more than Jackie Chan. What the fuck them faggots saying?. Nothing when I walk in the club with the gat in hand. Take 'em back to '94 shooing out a Astro van. Banging was the blueprint money was the master plan. Duffel bag full of Grants and Franklins. Rob niggas take they money shoot straight to the bank then. Head to the barbershop to get chopped up. Hearing war stories who dead and who locked up. Who snitching, who pitching and who knocked up. Fuck niggas in Black Wall Street I trust. Black hoodies and black Asics standing on the pavement. Hustlers don't sleep nigga we work the grave shift. Fuck that long money nigga get paid quick. And don't save shit. [Chorus: Chrisette Michelle]. All my hoods on the real dark side of the track. No sunny sky's just really black. We live real down here, Lord let us live. No playing around here, Lord let us live. Don't hate my hood just hate my shine. We coming out we on our grind. We live real down here, Lord let us live. We coming outta here, Lord let us live. Lord knows that money don't matter. Lord knows that status is badder. Lord knows about the hood I live in. He's taking away but he's giving. Now don't give me these cars. Don't give me these mansions. Don't hate me just let me ride, Lord just give me light. [The Game]. I don't hate Mobb Deep or M.O.P. That was a phase I was caught up in the beef like a rat in a maze. And my legacy will never be that of a hater. Lyrical rhyme slayer wack niggas say your prayers. It's the return of Gandhi. Criminal minded city behind me. Put it on my face to remind me. Of all the shit I been through my physical presence, my pen too nice. My first album sent you life. I should of put down the mic when Rakim left Dre. No cleanup hitter so I was stranded on second base. I had to steal third motherfucker that's my word. There's some Queens niggas try to put me back on the curb. I was ultimate warrior to you bully ass niggas. I will come through the hood with the fully axe niggas. Like Snoop or Suge I'm in the coupe I'm good. Mothafuckas make way. [Chorus: Chrisette Michelle]. All my hoods on the real dark side of the track. No sunny sky's just really black. We live real down here, Lord let us live. No playing around here, Lord let us live. Don't hate my hood just hate my shine. We coming out we on our grind. We live real down here, Lord let us live. We coming outta here, Lord let us live. [The Game]. Is that Michelle Chrisette. Black Wall, Coollie High, Scott Storch, let's ride. '08 to infinity. California, New York.

let's ride,"aka as ""Strip Club"" / ""Let's ride (Strip Club)"" - dirty version /uncensored.. [Verse 1]. Pull the rag off the six-fo',. Hit the switch, show niggas how the shit go,. The Game is back, the Aftermath chain is gone,. The D's is chrome, the frame is black.. (So watch it lift up). Till the motherfucker bounce and break,. And knock both of the screws out the licence plate.. Let the games begin,. These other rap niggas so far behind me, go taste my rims,. Shit, let the chronic burn as the datens spin.. It ain't been this much drama since I first heard Eminem,. In the club, poppin' X pills like M & Ms,. Call it Dre day, we celebratin', bitch bring a friend.. Bottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round,. And put that cheap-ass hypnotic down.. (Put your 'cris up!). If you feel the same way,. Who got 'em hittin' switches NY to LA. [Hook]. (Got the whole world in the club). Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back,. (I turn it into a strip-club). Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass,. (Get the whole world in the club). Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch. (Pop bottles and twist up). Roll up chronic and hash,. In a blunt, call it Aftermath. [Verse 2]. Somebody tell me where the drinks at,. Where the bitches at,. You fucking on the first night, meet me in the back.. I got a pound of chronic, and a gang of freaks,. Move bitch! Who the fuck you think they came to see?. The protégé of the D R E,. You take a picture with him, and you gotta fuck me,. And you gotta fuck Busta, can't touch Eve,. Got something in my waist that you can't touch either,. That's - my gangsta bitch, and like Crips and Bloods,. I'm in the club on some gangsta shit.. (So nigga twist up). Light another dub,. Bitches get scared when niggas start fighting in the club.. Ain't nothing but a g-thing, baby it's a g-thing,. Bounce like you got hydraulics in your g-string,. I fuck a different bitch seven days a week,. Hit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat.. [Hook]. (Got the whole world in the club). Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back,. (I turn it into a strip-club). Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass,. (Get the whole world in the club). Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch. (Pop bottles and twist up). Roll up chronic and hash,. In a blunt, call it Aftermath. [Verse 3]. Who thought I weren't coming back?. Look at me now,. Hoppin' out the same Cherry six-fo' with the motherfucking top down,. I'm The Game, nigga. Call your bitch, she ain't home, she with Game, nigga. Remember that, Dre. You passed me the torch, I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray,. Ridin' three-wheel motion 'till the ass scrapes,. Turn sunset into a motherfucking drag-race.. Now watch it bounce,. Hit the switch, let it bounce till the police shut the shit down.. {When you hit the club). Tell 'em you came with me,. (We gonna twist up). In the V.I.P.. It's a new day, and if you ever knew Dre,. Motherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre.. Same Impala, different spokes. Same chronic, just a different smoke.. [Hook]. (Got the whole world in the club). Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back,. (I turn it into a strip-club). Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass,. (Get the whole world in the club). Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch. (Pop bottles and twist up). Roll up chronic and hash,. In a blunt, call it Aftermath"
life is but a dream,"I am happy to join with you today. In what will go down in history. As the greatest demonstration for freedom. In the history of our nation. So it seems I'm lost. In between exotic cars in phoenix. Palms hella itchy baby mama bitchy. Dish washer broke cause them pots too sticky. Snap back to the back cause I got that crack. And I'm from that city. Where even the girls is packed. And I'm strapped this zone they don't hear that rap. Shit unless it's watch he a problem. Then them bitches turn up asap. Like they went to school in harlem. But they know they from compton. Yeah they know they from compton. Where we put bass with the head. Before dre was with monster. We pull guns on niggas before we ever play contra. Turn up countering they bands and. I make them hoes dance so. Let that bitch breathe before she take yo kids. And you be forced to watch that bitch leave. And that's every nigga's situation. In a town where them gang signs go up. And them bitches going down. Life is a but a dream. I'm searching for a dream. So I'm finally free. Don't let me, don't save me. Life is a but a dream. Life is a but a dream. Life is a but a dream. Life is a but a dream. I'm searching for a dream. So I'm finally free. Don't let me, don't save me. Life is a but a dream. Life is a but a dream. Life is a but a dream. A great american in whose symbolic shadow. We stand today signed the emancipation proclamation. But one hundred years later the nigro still is not free. Niggas rock two chains and one star. I seen these niggas runnin. Them ain't yo niggas no more. Cause I got macks comin. You take a nigga jewels. And act like you done did something. We take a nigga life and act like we ain't did nothing. And all of this is like a push of a button. I got niggas bustin simply because they ribs touchin. And we ain't tryna work the nicky d. Niggas is tryin to put that six on d's. And flip one of them bentley keys. Hood niggas that only wanna be hood with. Stack 100 cash and then you safe and wife a good bitch. Cop a gucci belt maybe in louie 2. Line at challenger with that camaro. And see what it do?. Hit toxic cause we got a fit and cane wasted. It's hot as fuck but at least we can see these hoes' faces. And it's drama what that shit do. Every time we hit the city. Give'em a couple hoes and a pistol. Cause I, I hold my niggas down. I said I, I hold my niggas down. Yeah I hold my niggas down. And the day I go out this is kendrick's crown. No we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied. Until justice rolls down like waters. And righteousness like a mighty stream. Life is but a dream. Life is but a dream. Life is everything but a dream"
like father like son,"[The Game]. June 30th, 11:07 I got that call. She 8 centimeters, my lil' man about to fall. Scuffing my Air Forces, running through the hospital hall. Deja vu, like I been here before. I'm feeling reborn, like a Bed-Stuy brethren, my first born. Dre, I'm about to have a bad boy, family in the lobby. See my nigga Church, ""What Up,"" shit I left the camcorder in the truck. Running through the maternity ward, out of breath, sweating. I swear to God every minute's starting to feel like a second. I seen Hell staring down the barrel of a Smith & Wesson. My son's ultrasound the closest I ever been to Heaven. Lord forgive me for my sins, I know it's last minute. Put the chronic in the air, a little hash in it. Spread my wings, If only I could fly. Why fight to live homie?, If we only living to die. [Chorus: Busta Rhymes]. I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be. That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son. But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me. I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son. My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you. And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you. [Verse 2: The Game]. They say every time somebody die a child is born. So I thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son. 11:32, she screaming at the top of her lungs. I'm panicking, nurse yelling for the doctor to come. All I could remember was lamaze class, breathe baby. ""One (one), two (two), three (three), four (four),"" I see the head. Doc busting through the door, he between the legs. He see the head, it's my baby boy!. 11:46, the head out, she screaming, making crazy noise. Pain is love, my stomach folding like a La-Z-Boy. I'm feeling like Mariah Carey, all these butterfly's. Voices singing to me, sound like Teena Marie. I'm calling niggas on tour, ""Jayo tell spears, I just cut the umbilical cord"". 11:57, a soldier is born, and he's flesh of my flesh, young Harlem Quaran. [Chorus: Busta Rhymes]. Verse 3: The Game]. I wanna thank Dr. Azworth and Nurse Theresa, for bringing my baby boy to life. You birthed a Caesar, And my baby Mama, Aleiska. For pushing out a 10-pound, 4-ounce Mini-Me, I still can't believe it. Nose, ears, eyes, chin, just like your Daddy. I die before you grow up and be just like your Daddy, or your Grandfather. Call Uncle's, tell him I got a son and I ain't even in Harlem. I'm popping Cris with your Godfathers, Baron Davis and ""D-Mack"" Darius Rogers. Drop the top on the '71, with my face in the clouds, Lord spare my son. And watch over Aaron Wright, T'Yan and Lil' Pun. Lowriding, banging ""Ready to Die,"" track number 1. If I bust 5 times and they never see the sun. My life is a black hole, like the barrel of a gun, one. [Chorus: Busta Rhymes]. . By Raphael Preto_Sao Luis-MA"
lookin' at you,"[Chorus: song by Tracey Nelson]. Walkin down the street, in my All Stars. In my, khaki suit, doin what (I) do. Walkin down the street, smokin, chronic. In my black locs, lookin, (AT) you. [The Game]. Guess who's back on the West coast tracks. It's the motherfuckin messiah of gangsta rap. Still dip in the six-fo', still puffin on the same chronic. Haters mad cause I still got it. I never fall off, even without the Doc. You niggaz sellin your soul tryin to stay on top. Bitch nigga check your Kotex, you niggaz ain't movin shit. like the hand on a fake-ass Rolex. I'm five million sold, the cover of my last album. the only time you see me sittin on gold. I'm the most anticipated, most celebrated. Most loved and the motherfuckin most hated. Keep rollin like gold Daytons. Niggaz got the game fucked up like Hennessy with a Coke chaser. You gotta deal with me, I'm the West coast saviour. Niggaz think of me everytime they six-fo' scraper. [Mac Minister]. What do you call a nigga who's overbearin. Belligerent, foul, defiant and very disrespectful. You call that nigga the Doctor's Advocate. He's a reflection of Dr. Dre in his heyday in the worst way. The five star surgeon general. Took Jayceon to the Aftermath research department. And gave him a blood test. It came back G-A-M-E positive. The nigga's infected with the Game virus. His oratorical skills are so impeccable. That niggaz in the streets call him Cyrus. The young don who is down with violence. cause in his heart he's a tyrant. It's not a game, it's just called The Game. There'll be no referees, no halftime reports. When the game is over, The Game is over. You can't put a quarter in the machine and get three mo' men. THAT'S, the end. [Chorus]. [The Game]. I done been to hell and back. Left for dead, you know who to thank for that. Finished my second LP without a Dr. Dre track. You can take my soul but can't take my plaques. I'm the motherfuckin snare when it touch the beat. I'm the 808 drum that got you movin your feet. I'm the heir to the throne after the D-R-E. Product of my environment, you old-ass niggaz. get ready for your early retirement. Before I let hip-hop burn down I run in the building like a fireman. Who can outspit me when I'm high off sticky. Throwin back Patron shots in some creased up dickies. I'm D.O.C. certified, Ice Cube (Lynch'd) me. Snoop stamped me and the good Doc handpicked me. You still with me? Me and my mic. can't be seperated like Interscope and - hahaha. Ohhh shit. This some good ass motherfuckin weed. California sticky green!. This is the aftermath for the Aftermath. West, coast!"
m.o.b. freestyle,"[Nas]. Aiyyo whassup Game. This the biggest boss in New York, Nas. Whattup my nigga I love what you doin out there man. New York got'chu, Queensbridge got'chu. Do the damn thing. We'll probably do some shit that'll scare the shit outta y'all. Nas y'all. [Verse One: M.O.B.]. Money Over Bitches, yeah. Watch it, when I hop out, 38 and a knockout. The studio on lockout like the day they let 'Pac out. Back to drop out, store the blockout. Homies say the cops out, stash spot got popped out. Grind 'til I clock out, tick tock out. Shake shakin them haters off, runnin a hot route. Get my Mike Williams on, homey do not doubt. #1 in Southern Cal', knowhatI'mtalkinbout?. Suckers up top on, shut 'em out of the pros. But runnin the fo'-fo' open them do's. Run and gun how I 'em them shows. When they see he can ball, let the cold flow open them hoes. I'm here, so go against my arrival is suicidal. Homicidal dynamic certifiedal my mob or die crew. You niggaz been lied to, we the best that did it. since Big was wit it and don't forget it (M.O.B.). (""It's the real.."") Money Over Bitches, the new edition. (""This.. is a DJ Ski exclusive""). (""The real.."") Money Over Bitches, and we the new edition. (""Hip-Hop..""). [Verse Two: M.O.B.]. Yeah, yeah, it's the mob nigga, ha ha. Ay Tec I get these G-Unit niggaz trippin. Talkin shit 'bout niggaz like they can't come up missin. Ay look I'm here so you don't get the story twisted. When I catch him slippin I'ma gun him down homey pay attention. You niggaz fin' to pay a visit, with readmission. What'chu know about cemetaries and morticians?. Know dat, can't run or escape like lo-jacks. With bullets that I aim cock spit and throw back. I'm Mr. Lemonhead on your block in a gold 'llac. Escaped from Death Row so stop askin where Suge at. You niggaz need your minerals, vitamins, three chemicals. Lyrically invincible spittin repeated principles. I'm killin you, I ain't feelin you meanin a war. Cause when we mob through the door, e'rybody on the floor. It's the mob {*echoes*}"
mama knows,"[Verse 1 - Game]. Mama told me stay away from them niggas. Mama told me she had a K for them niggas. Mama told me she go to pay for them niggas. While my grandmother told me that she would pray for them niggas. They just young black and ignorant. Lusting over models and the Benjamins. Got the game twisted like (what?) licorice. When I was rocking lottos moving packs in front of McDonalds. She was looking for me, pulled up in that Old El Dorado. I was running around with Chase, chasing new black wheels. Why would I do that still? That's what got 2Pac killed... But I use that still cause I won't do that deal. Screw the muzzle in potatoes of that new Mac Mill. What did I learn? Nothing. My papa smoking sherm blunts and. Beating on my moms like her head was a percussion. Tat! Tat! My .45 knocking on your window. She said there would be days like this,. Pharrell, drop the instrumental. [Pharrell]. Yezzir... [Hook - Nelly Furtado]. I know I must go and I don't know my way. Still don't know where we all came from. [Verse 2 - Game]. Crack a Swisher, crack a 5th up. Hennessy pouring like Niagara Falls. Used to watch Magic, he showed me how to ball. Moms working late night, to get a plate right. Had some older brothers, all we did was smoke and play-fight. Wish I could go back to them days cause streets don't play right. Some niggas hard, other niggas was the Kid N Play type. Didn't stop me from pretending I was Apollo from Rocky. Working on my dip-game, now nobody wanna box me. Pick and choose, stick and move. So many dudes ended up in sleeping bags on late-night news. But not my mama's song, going around. the hood serving customers. She yapping in my ear, but it's louder than the muffler. What I didn't listen to, I wish I would've trusted her. Wish I had a shovel, be digging both of my brothers up. Like ""here hug em ma, one last time"". Put a chain on both of them niggas, they get one last shine. [Hook - Nelly Furtado]. [Verse 3 - Game]. Put your glock down, recognize a king cause it's my town. Word to my mother you can throw up your rock now. Got off the beef shit cause I ain't tryna see my mama in all-black. Right there, crying over hard facts. Now she gotta turn in all her cars and get her house back. Never! She carried me for 9 months so she can have whatever. Plus she taught me how to shoot Berettas,. told me that I'd be a king. So RIP to Coretta, if you don't understand that. Then refer to my letter, while I sprinkle. Niggas with platinum, from my last album. Got the check, so I signed on the X like Malcolm. Riding through the hood, you hating niggas like ""how come?"". That niggas Game got it, heard he selling talcum. Either way, hey playboy, check it, this is the outcome. You might not like it, but my mama psychic. Why you niggas twisted like the top of a Sidekick?. I know I must go and I don't know my way. Still don't know where we all came from. I know I must go and I don't know my way. Still don't know where we all came from"
martians vs. goblins,"(Game). Blood gang kill 'em all, Odd Future Wolf Gang. Kidnap a vampire, drain all his fuckin veins. Wolf Grey Jordans, use his intestines for the strings. Snatch up Rihanna and throw her in front of a fuckin train. Sniff a fucking unemployment line of cocaine. Tie Lil B up to a full tank of propane. Swag, now watch him cook.. and just stand there and look. Have a bonfire with old Harry Potter books. Martians vs. Goblins, goons vs. the crooks. And since me and Tune had Viacom shook. I shoulda got a real-ass pirate to do the hook. Maybe Jack Sparrow maybe Peter Pan's nemesis. My power's limitless like Blanka on Sega Genesis. Superhero, mad that Marvel overlooked me. Cause Spiderman and Hulk straight pussy. Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin). Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin). Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin). Muthafuckin Martian (goddamn Goblin). We are not the same, I am a Martian. (Tyler). A year ago, I was poor, somewhat. Now my future's brighter than Christopher's new haircut. Bruno Mars is still sucking dick and fucking male butts. In the same closet that Tyler Perry gets clothes from. I suck? Where the fuckin Ring Pops?. You got a better chance of getting a copy of Detox. Wolf Gang, we rock, crack rock and that shit was expected. Like Jayceon whenever he name-drop (Fuck you, Tyler). Jesus, motherfucking Theresa. This nigga Game got Wolf Haley for this feature. My team is running shit like we have full-cleat Adidas. Getting chased by the police on a full bred Cheetah. Bishop Eddie caught me tryna escape. Bag full of drag and a Nicki Minaj mixtape. Dragging all you fags to the back of the log cabin. Fall back like Lebron's hairline. Against the Mavericks, he lost. Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin). Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin). Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin). Muthafuckin Martian (goddamn Goblin). We are not the same, I am a Martian. (Game). (Chuck, fuck what) I do. Cause Lil Tunechi always bless me (Not you). He killed me on my own track, so what? Not you. Fuck you, I spit like I had kids with Erykah Badu. I fucked her on the day of that naked video shoot. I was sucking that pussy like it was wonton soup. Then I hit Lebron's mom in bron-bron's coupe. With Delonte West taping, we had bon-bons too. With Cleveland cheerleaders, they had pom-poms too. So I smacked them bitches wearing Bishop Don Juan's suit. (Where was Snoop?) I don't know,. Probably doing what the Crips do. But when I'm with my uncle, fuck it! Then I'm a Crip too. And I will Crip Weezy, Crip Jones, and Crip you. Now I'm the Doggfather, walking with a Shih Tzu. Mad that DC comics overlooked me. Cause Captain America's straight pussy. Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin). Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin). Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin). Muthafuckin Martian (goddamn Goblin)"
maybe in another life,"I can only try so hard, girl. Remember '95 like our love feel right, girl. And maybe it just wasn't the right time. Maybe in another lifetime. I'm sitting in my ghost, I don't know what to do. But what I know is I'm at my best when I fuck with you. I always thought we'd kinda end up just like the huxtables. Thought our love was like swizz and alicia, untouchable. Thought we always had that jay and b potential. And ever since we've been apart everything is instrumental. And I can't even hear the words to my favorite song. I'm so numb inside. Bitch you telling me ""boy, I'm ovulating, so just come inside"". I'm kinda torn between what I want and what I know. That's why sometimes after the kids. Fall asleep I get up and go. Used to chase me down the hallway. Acting like you on broadway. Hop in your benz, tailing my range. Trying to jump out where that broad stay. And that was crazy but at least I know you care. That was then, this is now, how the fuck did we end up here?. Now we care about our instagram posts more than each other. Posting subliminal shit like we ain't never. Met each other, that's crazy. So we go. I can only try so hard, girl. Remember '95 like our love feel right, girl. And maybe it just wasn't the right time. Maybe in another lifetime. We spent the last 24 months arguing over these broads. That we forgot about the show and then cali became a star. And maybe that was a blessing. 'Cause she could grow up to be. Reyna simone at our discretion. I be right there for protection. 'Cause these days my kids the only place to get affection. Could be wrong, you a school teacher. Maybe I just need correction. You used to be the one to point a nigga in the right direction. Now we both inside greystone sitting in different sections. Pretending we having fun but what I really want to do. Is get you to that sls and fuck you till you see the sun. And maybe I wouldn't feel so bad every time I see my son. And he ask am I coming home and I tell him to go ask his mom. And shit get real hard 'cause I can't live without my daughter. You can't just be beyoncé and try to ride for sean carter. You know I love my kids and can't no nigga replace their father. This could be a love story, view the offer right. So we go. I can only try so hard, girl. Remember '95 like our love feel right, girl. And maybe it just wasn't the right time. Maybe in another lifetime"

See what the problem is too much east coast dick lickin. And everybody tryin to do their best 2pac rendition. Listen they wonder how I live with 5 shots. Niggaz is hard to kill on my block. When you was in the streets comin of age. I was in the streets pumpin the gauge. While you was rappin I was makin it happen. On the block with a k. While you was with the roc on the stage. I had rocks on the stage. On headliner for the front page we know that you front. You be on sunset doin what? Gettin your punk ass stunt. You gon respect us or that fo' rippin through the vests. And you know who you are deaf nigga'll get the message. Malik or M-E-M-P-H Bleek. Fuck around and be a B-I-T-C-H sleek. Cuz all that yappin dude will get guns clappin dude.

It took me a little while but I am now understandin. Jay fucked up in the first round when he picked olo with candy. Did olo in the second, nigga take it from me. The Roc get knocked off the bounce till you picked up beans. Add freeway to the team but move the ugly bitch. Trade the Marcy reject for Cam'ron and Lil' Chris. Now the squad 5 is live 6 man is Neef. Fans in the stand yellin out fuck Memphis Bleek. You want beef I have your body parts all over New York. Leg in jersey arm in Brooklyn head buried in central park. You can't even borrow from New York no more like john Storch. And I ain't talkin to him I'm talkin to Malik. And I got a pine box for a nigga like you. Streets is talkin how many real niggaz like you. Hit LAX remember when you come to the coast. Niggaz don't play with they lives when it comes to the toast. [Chorus: The Game].

All we know is rocks and presidents like Mount Rushmore. Fuck the police, they hop out and bust doors. I ain't goin' back to jail, nigga that's what I flush for. My money or my glock, who do I trust more?. I don't know, it's probably the one that I touch more. Guess it's the green, 'cause paper motivate niggaz. And my Rolex racist 'cause it hate niggaz.

Fuck a black car, you see these green faces?. Look at my chest, now you seen fakers. Treat my money like the Cristal that we wastin'. Cause I'm a money machine, I could re-make it. You a fool thinkin' that Freddy could see Jason. I've been iced out, like who the fuck need Jacob. The doc told me to be patient, but I want. money like Dwight Howard, next time he a free agent. I'm tryin' to make enough money so I could feed Asia. Have Asians in the kitchen cookin' in Louis V. aprons. Word to Martha Stewart, if I could park a Buick. Then I could flip a Brink's truck, I got the heart to do it. Ball like the nigga Tony Parker do it. Speak no engles but dinero I talk it fluent. [Chorus]. Dead presidents, big paper (""for the money""). Benjamins, skyscrapers, my niggaz get (""money""). My bitches get (""money"") like the strippers get.

And if you see a white truck that mean yo' sheets is dead. Then I'm goin goin, back back. to the block to dump the bucket and jump in the drop. Niggaz know I'm good with the glock, they call me Chick Hearns. Cause if the game on knot, I'm callin the shots. I'll wear a shiny suit for a minute like I'm The LOX. Then get gangster with a swap meet bag and a Jordan box. And when I die, bury me with the glock, and a bucket of shells. In case niggaz want drama in hell. [JT]. Yeah, so when Compton niggaz and Fillmoe niggaz get together. Shit happens mayne; real talk from ya nigga Fig'. Doin it big and don't wanna split yo' wig. [Chorus: repeat 2X]. I'll give you anything you ask fo' - money over bitches. Tell me what'chu blast fo' - fuck around with snitches. What you had to smash fo' - niggaz tried to play me man. (1) Anything you ask fo' - all about this Bay game. (2) Anything you ask fo' - representin Bay game. [JT]. I be the boy with the most cabbage, pluck strings like I'm Lenny Kravitz. I'm in the streets where they goin savage. One, two, we dance on the rooftop. Let the Coupe ghostride then we come to two stops. Figga eight'n by the corner sto'. Niggarali from killer Cali you gotta let 'em know. Yeahh, ya hit me on my Sidekick. Inventory pilin up, niggaz tryin to buy shit. They got me diggin in my files. Pro Tools, ADAT tapes and big sounds. Jumpin on a plane, jumpin out a taxi cab. Stackin up this fettucini now these niggaz hella mad. ""Fuck that nigga! He got another album on the board?"". Damn right, another album on the board. Fuck the bullshit, the Figgarali don't play. I represent the whole Bay every motherfuckin day. [Chorus]. [Verse Three]. Count rubber band grands. I'm out big on the under, with my fam bam. And I, hover the lands. To expand, I'm from the gutter grime and the sand. No jams the flam's all busted. The dames want the bucks when, they see you stuffed in. your pockets, 'til they get them some. But testin my pocket, only gets you none. Cause I, got a pimp mentality. The scrubs wanna eat shrimp, and get my salary. They ain't knowin I'm tight laced in my shoestrings. Hate the way I'm flowin on the mic, cause I do gleam. All types of baguettes and bezels. We shine like life's {?} rebels. 2005, me and my crew just pile the pots. Move like the ice loose, pimp these thangs to watch. [Chorus]"

Ye what these niggas start hummin' out their mouth with?. Bunch of bullshit, weak ass albums. Bunch of lil' niggas tryna copy our style. When we originated this. whole mothafuckin' album had hits. That's why we up in the Ritz. That's why I'm up in your bitch, head honcho. Get you killed pronto, wearin' red now, El Segundo. Bail long as Alonzo Mourning. Kill a nigga in his Monte Carlo like Alonzo. Sold records, sold crack, nigga, recognize. For the record, I've been wreckin' shit since '05. No lie, J's on. Take these mothafuckas off and throw the Ye's on. Rewind, J's on. Take these mothafuckas off and throw the Ye's on. Yeezy, tell these niggas that they is slaves. Master want you on red carpet like yesterday. You a house nigga, I'ma get away though. Come back kill master ass like Django. Most you niggas just rapping for the fame though. I start rapping to get the fuck out this durango. What goes around comes around how that saying go?. Documentary 2, no 50 keep the change hoe. [Hook: Kanye West Sarah Barthel]. Feelin' lonely. Let me know if you're feelin' crazy. I guess all that stuff they told me. In my life was extra shady. I should've kept 'em waitin'. Say hello to the mula. I'm on top, no lie. Say hello to the mula. I'm on top, good night. Feelin' lonely. The night, it swallowed my soul. Let me know if you're feelin' lonely. [Verse 2: Game Kanye West]. Back like I never left, nigga I'm on my second breath. And I got another track from Yeezy. How'd you do that? Like Eric Wright said Eazy. Pull up in my cool whip, I don't give a fuck about it. Leave it at the valet, I ain't fucked up about it. I'll call an Uber, nigga, I'll fuckin' shoot a nigga. I got a white bitch that blow like a tuba, nigga. I just got a new crib, I just got a new Wraith. I just got cooler than Ll Cool J. I just got a new gun, squeeze it like some toothpaste. I, I, (aghhk). Spit in the face of a coward. Shit on anybody ever try to take ours. Ye why that nigga's face so sour?. Cause that slick mouth got him wet up like a shower. Now what you know about power?. What you know about dreams?. What you know about freestylin' versus each other. Shelter outside of Nike Town without a dollar in your jeans. [Hook: Kanye West Sarah Barthel]. Feelin' lonely. Let me know if you're feelin' crazy. I guess all that stuff they told me.

my life,"[Intro]. *breathing*. *dog barking*. *gun shot and glass break*. [The Game]. Punk ass mothaf**ka, get your ass up. What chu was goin do? kill me in my sleep you bitch ass nigga?. Tupac, Biggie! shut the f**k up! f**king dogs barking and shit. [Punk Ass Motherf**ker]. Don’t shoot!. Don’t shoot!. *gun shot*. [The Game]. F**k You Nigga!. . [Chorus: Lil' Wayne]. And I’m grindin’ til I’m tired. They say ""You ain’t grindin’ til you tired"". So I’m grindin’ with my eyes wide. Looking to find. A way. Through the day. A life. For the night. Dear Lord, you’ve done took so many of my people but I’m just wonderin’ why. You haven’t taken (my life? x3). Like what the hell am I (doing right? x3). (My Life x3). [Verse 1: The Game]. Take me away from the hood like a state penitentiary. Take me away from the hood in the casket or a Bentley. Take me away. Like I overdosed on cocaine. Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain. Suicide (Suicide..suicide..). I'm from a Windy City, like ""Do or Die"". From a block close to where Biggie was crucified. That was Brooklyn's Jesus. Shot for no f**kin' reason. And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces? (My Life x3). 'Cause that's Jesus people. And The Game, he's the equal. Hated on so much, ""The Passion of Christ"" need a sequel. Yeah, like Roc-a-fella needed Sigel. Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle (My Life x3). I need some meditation, so I can leave my people. They askin' “Why?"" Why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?. And why every hood nigga feed off evil?. Answer my question before this bullet leave this Desert Eagle. [Chorus: Lil' Wayne]. And I’m grindin’ til I’m tired. They say ""You ain’t grindin’ til you tired"". So I’m grindin’ with my eyes wide. Looking to find. A way. Through the day. A life. For the night. Dear Lord, you’ve done took so many of my people but I’m just wonderin’ why. You haven’t taken (my life? x3). Like what the hell am I (doing right? x3). (My Life x3). [Verse 2: The Game]. We are not the same, I am a Martian. So approach my Phantom doors with caution (caution...caution). You see them 24's spinnin'? I earned them. And all the pictures of me and Em, I burned them. So there ain't no proof that I ever walked through 8 Mile. And since there ain't no Proof, I never walked through 8 Mile. Sometimes I think about my life with my face down. Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile (My Life x3). Damn, I know his momma's proud. And since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my momma now. And like MJB, ""No More Drama"" now. Livin’ the +good life+, me and Common on common ground. I spit crack and niggas could drive it outta town. Gotta Chris Paul mind state, I'm never outta bounds. My life used to be empty like a glock without a round. Now my life full, like a chopper with a thousand rounds (Gunshots). [Chorus: Lil' Wayne]. And I’m grindin’ 'til I’m tired. They say ""You ain’t grindin’ 'til you tired"". So I’m grindin’ with my eyes wide. Looking to find. A way. Through the day. A life. For the night. Dear Lord you’ve done took so many of my people but I’m just wonderin’ why. You haven’t taken (my life? x3). Like what the hell am I (doing right? x3). (My Life x3). [Verse 3: The Game]. Walk through the gates of Hell, see my Impala parked in front. The high beams on, me and the Devil share chronic blunts. Listening to the ""Chronic"" album, playing backwards. Shootin’ at pictures of Don Imus for target practice. My mind f**ked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood. I'm from the city that made you motherf**kers afraid of Suge (Compton... Compton...). Made my grandmother pray for good. And never made her happy, when I bet that new Mercedes could (My Life x3). Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood. They took so many of my niggas, that I should hate the hood. But it's real niggas like me, that make the hood. Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should (My Life x3). With the top back. In my Sox hat. I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that. Even if they brought the nigga 'Pac back. I'd still keep this motherf**ker cocked back. [Chorus: Lil' Wayne]. And I’m grindin’ til I’m tired. They say ""You ain’t grindin’ til you tired"". So I’m grindin’ with my eyes wide. Looking to find. A way. Through the day. A life. For the night. Dear Lord you’ve done took so many of my people but I’m just wonderin’ why. You haven’t taken (my life x3). Like what the hell am I (doing right? x3). (My Life x3). (My Life x3). (My Life x3).

my love for you,"[The Game: Intro]. Edith Sigler. Truely a black rose cracking the concrete. I love you and I miss you so much. [The Game: Chorus]. My love for you, is like a angel. Flying through the sky like a bird in the winter. And your love for me, is so deep and. Sorta like a black rose cracking the ce-ment. My love for you, lives on. Like the memory of Aaliyah singing her last song. And your love for me, will never die. Like a black child struggling the ghetto to survive. [The Game: Verse 1]. My heart goes out to the beautiful woman that raised me. Twenty years after the Watts Riots, early 80's. Pop's on drugs, Mom's couldn't take me in. Had a daughter already, said she was too young.. to feed another baby and. Shit got crazy then, two years came went. Baby sister on the way, we can't even pay the rent. No hot water.. I reminisce. Tears running down my face as I hold my daughter. You spent years by the fire place, I was in the garden. Every Sunday at the church, Bible study at the quarters. I was hard head back then, I was selling crack. When your hard earned money paid for basketball practice. Always at the game on time, yelling at the coaches. Wondering why your baby boy's sitting on the pine. Even though life get hard sometimes, I keep my head up. And I can make the sun shine in just one rhyme. Walk with me. [The Game: Chorus]. My love for you, is like a angel. Flying through the sky like a bird in the winter. And your love for me, is so deep and. Sorta like a black rose cracking the ce-ment. My love for you, lives on. Like the memory of Aaliyah singing her last song. And your love for me, will never die. Like a black child struggling the ghetto to survive. [The Game: Verse 2]. I'm at the lanes, in that '57 Lincoln Continental. Peddle to the floor, looking for the highway to heaven. Remember when your baby boy was 7?. We had +Good Times+ like I was J.J. and you was Florida Evans. I shoulda listened to the reverend. Now I drown my pain in this 40 ounce and these boring ass records. Disrespecting your house, living reckless. Look at me, inside your jewlery box, 'bout to pawn your necklace. Every night you in the window looking. But what'd you do when your grandson crooked and he too old for whooping. Used to tell me I was smarter than that. Took me down to the Compton swap meet, bought my first starter hat. ""Pull over, wait! A jacket to match,. a pair of Levis, and number 8 Jordan's with the all black straps!"". When you died, my soul cracked, can i get a soul clap?. I'm walking without a heart, can somebody hold that?. [The Game: Chorus]. My love for you, is like a angel. Flying through the sky like a bird in the winter. And your love for me, is so deep and. Sorta like a black rose cracking the ce-ment. My love for you, lives on. Like the memory of Aaliyah singing her last song. And your love for me, will never die. Like a black child struggling the ghetto to survive. [The Game: Verse 3]. I got a lotta things i wanna ask the Lord. Like why I can't see my grandmother face no more. And why I cant seem to live without her. And if I pray could he send her back to me one day, 'cause heaven too crowded. Everytime I think about it, I'm missing your smile. Can barely cope, my angel is gone, I'm heartbroke. Drowning in my own tears, somebody throw me a rope. Or spread my wings so I can fly, I'm ready to die. Might cry but I'm still a man, might be a man. But I still cry, big mama, my angel in the sky. If you wanna feel my pain, then close your eyes. Hold your breath, now that's too close to death. Open your eyes see the light now. And if you love your grandmother like I love mine, go tell her right now. I know how this might sound. But my plan is to show you that I understand, you are appreciated. [The Game: Chorus]. My love for you, is like a angel. Flying through the sky like a bird in the winter. And your love for me, is so deep and. Sorta like a black rose cracking the ce-ment. My love for you, lives on. Like the memory of Aaliyah singing her last song. And your love for me, will never die. Like a black child struggling the ghetto to survive. [Fade Out]"

Handle my jewels with the cuff in my shoes. AD jacket on my elbow, 50 coast the jewels. In my neighborhood I'm Young Bill Gates, never shuffle the cake. So cover my face, and run up in the place. I'm a superstar, dick and my chain, glass bezel and bang. 80 karats on my pinky and rang. Crews buzz when you speakin my name, cause I'm deep in the game. With top cool thangs and million dollar planes. I'm a maniac, young boy gone, like a young Roy Jones. You ought of my zone and ain't nobody home. In my neighborhood, produce stars, stakes is high. Now we soarin through the spacious skies. Drop yo' body with them cakes and ride, the handle is up. Switchin gears with the pedal and ride. [Chorus]. [The Game]. I'm a shining star. And I gotta hit the boulevard in that new Jaguar. Why he move through traffic like that, purple haze. Ralways, the Ojays, the gangsta lean so. Please believe that I keep two G's in my jeans. Two gats in my sleeve, two rats in my Beam'. X-5, mami let's ride. Weave in and out of traffic from Compton to Bed-Stuy. It's the kid from the far West I, oh, shit. He know how to do more than flip pies. Get money like them stick up guys. Them ""Ocean 11"" licks got the young kid rich for life. And I talkin 'bout a movie or George Clooney. I'm talkin 'bout, runnin in your spots with uzis tucked in the Coogi. Dude me? Naw truly, might lose your lives. They say I've, got 2K2 covered like A.I.. [Chorus]. [JT].

never can say goodbye,"By: XaRaDa a.k.a. On FiRe. . ""93.5 K-DAY, givin you the taste of good life, your girl Yo-Yo.. Should I say is it still all good?. Today at 12:45 outside the Petersen Museum here in Los Angeles,. Notorious B.I.G. was gunned down and pronouced dead at 1:15 this morning.. As a result of the ongoing feud between East and West coast,. the tragic death of Tupac Shakur who was gunned down in Las Vegas. just six months earlier, our prayers go out to the families."". ""Westside Radio, Julio G.. A sad day today for the West coast; we lost an icon y'all.. Eric 'Eazy-E' Wright, passed away today at 6:45 PM,. Cedars Sinai Hospital, due to complications from AIDS.. A definite West coast legend, brought you N.W.A.,. brought you Michel'le, brought you D.O.C., and the list goes on.. We definitely gon' miss you Eazy."". [The Game – impersonating 2Pac]. Picture me rollin in that black B-M-dub, headed to the club. Fresh out the Tyson fight, Beamer all rimmed up. Shinin with the big homie, five-car caravan. Ridin shotgun, put that chronic smoke in the air. ""Me Against the World"" is what I told my foes. So it's me against the world, 'til they poke them hoes. Leanin out the window, flickin ashes off the indo. Throwin up Westside, I see, some of my kinfolk. Pull that blunt closer to my mouth cause only she know. I'm feelin bad about that nigga we stomped out in that casino. But fuck it it's Death Row - the big homie never told me. that my next blow could be my fuckin death blow. Tell Kidada I'm not ready, I ain't even let my momma know. I ain't got no kids, I'm only twenty-fo'. Before I can let the smoke out, niggaz let twenty go. The thirteen that hit the car was through the passenger do'. Now come wit it. [Chorus: Latoya Williams]. Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends). Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends). Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends). Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (I will always keep you near). [The Game – impersonating Notorious B.I.G.]. I love it when they call me Big Popp-a. I only smoke blunts if they roll prop-a. Look I gots ta, catch the first thing smokin in Cali. And hit one of my bitches in the valley. Gotta call my nigga Sean, tell him reserve the don. Tell him to get the chron' and the teflon. I think they trippin off the homie gettin shot. But God bless his soul, Lord know it wasn't Pop. or the M.A.F.I.A., Kim tell Cease get the fuckin truck. We 'bout to hit the Wilshire district, get fucked up. Pop mad bottles son, twist up the Phillies. I'm thinkin 'bout T'yanna, these niggaz is lookin silly. If this was Blook-lyn I would up the 9-milli. But fuck it we to the truck, roll the dutch, we out of Phillies. Hop in the front seat, of that dark green Suburban. Heard another car swervin, gunshots close the curtains; Biggie!. [Chorus]. [The Game – impersonating Eazy-E]. Layin in this hospital bed with bronchitis, I can't talk. Walked myself in and all of a sudden I can't walk. IV's in my arm, my wife Tomica at my legs. +Ruthless+, I mean Records, we got married on my deathbed. I could hear Jerry Heller in the hall. But I couldn't hear Cube and Dr. Dre no more at all. Through all the bullshit them niggaz was my dawgs. Niggaz With Attitudes spraypainted on the walls. I'm flatlinin, it's bad timin. +Straight Outta Compton+, the king of gangsta rap's dyin. Cause of death, the AIDS virus. Conspiracy, I guess the government just hate violence. They thought my group influenced the L.A. riots. Woulda been here to see my kids grow, if I stayed quiet. Took 12 years for a real nigga to break silence. Eazy I had to let 'em know. You could catch me, cruisin down the street in my six-fo'. [Chorus]"
"new york , new york","Yeah muthafuckers. It's the muthafuckin Game. gu, gu,...gu,gu,gu,gu, G-Unit. I got a hundred guns and a hundred clips. Nigga I'm in New York (New York).

Ride wit a hundred Bloods and a hundred Crips. Whenever I'm in New York (New York). Everybody wanna know why he got beef. 'Cause in my dreams I talked to 'Pac and B.I.G.. Got on the plane hopin that the NYC. It's me behind these bars like Chi-Ali. Niggaz want me to D-i-e. Been there, done that. Woke up from a coma on 3 I.V's. Eyes on the thrown, somebody in my seat. Fiddlin with rap like Miri Ben-ari. I scoop up swiss(beats), drive thru the Bronx and get Jada on the phone. My next stop is Yonkers. After that its Harlem, why?. 'Cause im a certified gangsta. And Jim Jones' throwin a Blood party. Red bandanas from 93rd to 115th and Lennox. It's the sequel to Menace. Oh Lord, he done went o dogg. Made 50's beef his and knocked 'em both off. [Chorus]. . New aftermath chain on, thats the bling. Stones yellow and black - he a Latin King. Mira me king ton el jefe Simone. Translation: I get money off ringtones. King Blood, even though I used to sling drugs when i see snoop he tell me ""Keep doin your thing cuz"". I do it cause I love it. Do it for the niggaz that don't know the difference between 'Chuck Taylors' and chuckers. I'm a gangsta tell Remi Martin I wanna fuck her. Thats what I call a championship game at the Rucker. ya'll want beef? change the subject. You ain't got no stars like the flag of the Dominican Republic. After Angie's show I was finna to get the bus. And catch a cab to a house and ask any nigga hustlin. I ain't got to live in New York all my life to know the A and D train go to Washington Heights. [Chorus]. Left the VMA awards, went back to the hood. Streets is talkin - 'Game got slapped by Suge'. False, I was face to face wit him. Media wanna criticize the game. Like he had Ma$e wit him. He a hood nigga that ain't ever try to snake niggaz. Walk thru the 5 boroughs never had jake with him. Bake it how u want, ain't no cupcake in him. Even Diddy know, I make the city glow. Never had an album, never had his own video. I was sellin crack while Ja was watchin 50 blow. White tee shirt, converse and my dickies on. Signed wit Dre recorded 150 songs. Now the fuckin hip hop police hatin. tryin to run me outta New York like Anthony Mason. Nigga I'll come and erase you. Only nigga from california. That'll come from the tongue wit a razor. [Chorus]"

Before I go, I shoot it out with the cops. Hit one for Sean Bell then bleed on the block, yeah. Like Big did, I play with toys like a big kid. Got a snub nose, call it Big Tig. You art not fuck with Game, he crazy. And the bars comin' straight outta Compton, baby. My 16's mean, you know what I mean. Headed to the airport, my flow flying in from Queens. Accompanied by my bitch, flying in with them things. My shorty is a 10, that's that singing nigga, Dream. The life of gangsta in Cali, is to short. So I might as well find me a borrow in New York.

Man you know, I don't give a fuck and I don't give a shit. Any drama, I'm locked on like a red-nose pit. Keep shooting them cap guns with the red nose tips. Have some Cali niggas come out and dead those strips. Give a fuck if you tuff nigga, or you buff nigga. My 4-5 weigh 3 pounds and it'll snuff niggas. Hop out the truck with the gun so long. Let the bullets jump out and ask, ""What's going on?"". What the fuck can I say? I grew up a bastard. Got sick in the Impala so I threw up a Aston. I pop big shit, and I keep my wrist slit. My entourage shine like the Diamond District. I got a Rolex, a real big Rolex. With so many rock, the Africans is trying to protest. Bully of the block, why? Cus they got me top 5.

'Til one weekend my uncle got stabbed to death. He got murdered by a fiend my pops ain't like that. He was from Nutty Block they used to call him Maniac. Crazy ass nigga wit' a Black Panther tat.

When I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott. Used to think that I was hard so I stole my brother's glock. And that's the day my life changed 'cause that night he got shot. Killed by another crip over his Rolex watch. I got high for three years off that Chronic from the Doc. I was drinkin' 40-ounces a lot. And every liquor store in Compton sold out the day Eazy dropped.

Bought a Cadillac thought I was rich bangin' DJ Quik. On Crenshaw got jacked for my shit. Took a long chronic hit and thought about the time. When I was 12 years old and I emptied my first clip.

one night,"[Chorus: Andrea Martin]. I only fuck wit'chu, on two occasions. When I'm drunk, when I'm high. I would be broke, if I would be wit'chu. That is why it's fo' one night. [The Game]. I'm a motherfuckin gangbangin nightmare, wake up motherfuckers. I traded in my white Nike Airs. For a rare pair of Converse, back to the hood. My own niggaz actin like I turned my back on the hood. I used my rap money to put crack in the hood. Even brought the nigga Dr. Dre back to the hood. I showed niggaz the Bentley then let you drive it. Gone for two days and I ain't even check the mileage. When we was fightin with Crips it wasn't about no dollars. It was about sellin dope to put our kids through college. I'm sittin on the block, reminiscin for hours. Wipin my tears cause now half of my niggaz is cowards. And I was still fuckin with niggaz, after I got shot. and didn't get one hospital visit. My homey Snoop told me it'd be days like this. It hurt my heart, to say this shit. [Chorus: Andrea Martin]. I only fuck wit'chu, on two occasions. When I'm drunk, when I'm high. I would be broke, if I would be wit'chu. That is why it's fo' one night. [The Game]. Red bandana in my back pocket, I'm for real. This ain't a pastel color khaki suit, and I ain't Pharrell. I don't front about shit I pull my gun up out shit. And let everything fly to keep my son up outta this. I thought you loved me nigga, talk is cheap. Remember, the bulletholes in my son's car seat. My baby momma found four shells, I ain't get. one keep your head up, all I got was keep it real. Keep it real my niggaz?. Last year alone I spent one point five mill' on my niggaz. After the bullshit, I stayed right there. Took you to award shows, there go J right there. Where? Right there! I had all you niggaz in suits. Cleaner than a pair of fresh Nike Airs. I'm supposed to enjoy this shit but it's quite clear. The last twelve months been a fuckin nightmare. [Chorus: Andrea Martin]. I only fuck wit'chu, on two occasions. When I'm drunk, when I'm high. I would be broke, if I would be wit'chu. That is why it's fo' one night. [The Game]. This shit worse than arguin with my bitch. I done been through mo' ups and downs, than the Impala switch. Get yo' hand out my pocket nigga, go fish. I was born by myself so I don't owe y'all shit. Nigga you tell me, what'chu want me to do. Drop my son off at home and come bang wit'chu?. Oh now it's fuck Game, nah nigga fuck you. I put that on my life, matter fact, that's on Piru. And the reality is, I could die too. And end up in the cemetery, right beside you. We can both ride, angels flyin over my head. Stoned but the devils inside yo' box. You wanted my shine so I gave you ice. Then I gave you a second chance and you played me twice. Couldn't be a real homeboy to save yo' life. I shoulda took Dr. Dre's advice. [Chorus: Andrea Martin]. I only fuck wit'chu, on two occasions. When I'm drunk, when I'm high. I would be broke, if I would be wit'chu. That is why it's fo' one night. [Outro - Andrea Martin]. Black Wall Street fo' life. Only fuck with you on two occasions. When I'm out of my mind, or when I'm high. I only, fuck with you.... by nbU."

You it's drama when the llama get out. Pull and spit the lead. Bullets hit your head. Then your mind'll sit out. By the time they find this shit out. I'm in a different state. In a different zip, different whip, different plates. Wait! I put the heater to your head. You G Unit Ninja Turtles cause your leader is rat. Scrat!. It's simple as 1,2,3. You lames. Wanna get at Game. You gotta come through me. Tony Yayo. Get out the way ho. Lloyd Banks just got shot. Technique pass the mack. And aim it at Curtis Jack. You ain't right. Trying to be Frank White. You getting smacked. Little accident murderer. I just now heard of ya. And the next time you disrespect the west, E serving ya. Yayo. You better lay low. Cause the M.O.B. got some killers on the payroll. I put a million dollar hit on you snitches. Show you why we call ourselves Money Over Bitches. (Chorus). I got a clip full of poison bananas.

Either that or I'mma knock Chris Lighty unconsciencious. Cut all the non-sense. You was PC'd up. Hit the bricks, rapping 'bout the corner like you Common. Talk of New York? You Jorge Pasada. I throw 'em, you catch 'em, that's not a threat, that's a promise. You did 6 months, now you a convict?. I accepted your phones calls now you got me on some wild shit. Judge said, ""Time spent"". Now you can get it from the same gun homicide dropped five dimes with. And next time you try to kiss me on the cheek. You won't be alive long enough to put out my heat. (Chorus). Welcome to the west, let me show you what hood like. My niggas down to sit on death row and ain't fucking with Suge Knight. Tag your left toes, wish you niggas a good night. Rock-a-by baby. Chrome .380. Screaming, ""Ready to die"". Them niggas ain't crazy. On the black wall on the mini street that they can't be. A pine box plenty of leg room. Game, hit me, we're watching X's rented in Cancun. I'm look at the two like, ""The nerve of this damn dude"". Pointing a beam at him, locating his next wound. Talk to my heat. Chi-Chi get the Yayo. Replace that G Unit bandana with a halo. (Chorus)"
pot of gold (feat. chris brown),"All this spotlight is not for me. I close my eyes and imagine I'm home!. I miss the days when life was simple. But if I never tried to follow that rainbow.

Still gotta carry my piece and soo-woo when it's reppin' time. Yall don't understand, I'm misunderstood. Give Interscope 2 more albums then I'm done for good.

promised land,"Sometimes I wonder. Man, how long is it gon' be for my people to come out. Man we strugglin, it's hard sometimes, but. Tomorrow's better than yesterday, uhh. [The Game]. I was, born in the slums, struggled from day one. Ray Charles vision, blinded by the light from the sun. No navigation, no sense of direction, darker complexion. made it hard to live; dad, how you fathered your kids?. Stranded on the highway of life, left us out to die, left us out to dry. Shhhh, I'm still here, my mother's cries. Nigga no father figures make harder niggaz. Through the years, went to war with niggaz from what I saw in the picture. Now your son is bigger, 13, but just like you. Moms said I would grow up and be just like you. From what you did to my sister she disliked you. Sixteen, eleventh grade, look at me just like you. Gunnin for riches, runnin hoppin project fences. Street corners to Arizona, how I earn my digits. And I'm far from finished, gamin 'til my coffee diminish. Why pray for the afterlife when mines just beginnin, huh. [The Game]. Only son by our mother, no brothers, only sisters by this one. Every time I kissed one I missed one, let me explain. Eight years before the game, everything came with pain. Watch the fate of my family slain would never see good times a-gayn. Cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame. My father, that have the same name as his father. My grandfather wouldn't believe, he pulled up our family tree. I can see him rollin over in his coffin. I'm left with often, thoughts of how could you molest your daughter. They say that's ten times worse than manslaughter. Man you oughta, be dead in a grave. But it wasn't my call, so instead you sat in a cage. High-powered, two-hundred and fifty pound, six-five coward. Woulda been dead in an hour. Heard you was scared to take a shower, scared of the yard. Your end is near, you shoulda been scared of God, motherfucker. [The Game]. All my niggaz listen, huh. I stay a step ahead of the rest of y'all. Why I gotta keep a vest for y'all. Though I made it dog I still stress for y'all. Funny how my folks think rap money stretch so far. Pray to God my niggaz see through all the checks and the cars. I'm tryin to invest in what's ours, gimme a couple of years dog. I'll turn your tears stress and your scars. into lawn chairs and green grass in your yard. I'm tryin to watch my kids wrestlin yours. Not have to get 'em ready for school and strap a vest on 'em all. I know sometimes it get hard. Keep your head up mami, reach for the stars. Havin a child is like a blessing from God. You just gotta work hard, can't let your youngest star strip in that bar. I feel your pain, this shit is rippin my heart. But where and when do we start, listen to the voice in back of my mind. Can't reach all my women so I attack it in rhyme. I know what you're feelin, I'm wripin ya tears ma, it could happen in time. For now I take your tear strife sufferin, imagine it mine, huh"

I'm physically before mentally, just remember me. For you I let that thing sing like a symphony. Sid and Nancy and Micky and Mallory we meant to be. Never been a trick I do the shopping for the both us. Send shots at the vultures. In these Marc Jacob loafers. And I'm saying. You gon let me see something. Stop playin. I didn't know it was like that, God-damn. You bring the LL out a nigga. The Louie V the Burken the Chanel out a nigga. J 12 out a nigga so you know what time it is. I'm bout to call the.

Livin' in a lap of luxury so you should go with me. I'm openly excited spend the night I bet u like it. Do with it whatever you like it don't matter just don't bite it. You see that feeling when you met me well you shouldn't fight it. They said you and I are more than worth a try so don't deny it. See I'm king like Leonidas, dress your hands with the brightest stones. Known the man when your mans pockets on a diet. Walk you in this presidential out that doublin' the Hyatt. Big money talkin', all broke niggas be quiet. It don't matter how we feel all what matters is how we live. Don't listen to his opinion until he stack a couple mil. But until then feels free to come chill. And my crib in the hills set back and kick off your heels. Say you never seen a pad with a view so ill. Or receive so much pleasure that you couldn't hold still. We'll until. [Chorus]. [Bridge - Robin Thicke]. Straight to the Penthouse, Elevate. Let me put my hands on your w-w-waiste. Let me take a second, let me take it in. You can run that game all night. But you know I w-w-win. I am Superman, I'm supercool. I'm in the air, all over you. I am Superman, I'm supercool. I'm in the air, all over you. [Verse 3 - The Game]. I let your friends talk bad about you. I didn't lisso (listen). Behind your back calling you a H to the Izzo. I apologise lay your head on the pillow. Mr and Mrs Smith and we can have a little Willow. She can shave the sides put a couple lines in it. And we can have spitzers put a couple limes in it. Throw a Bar Mitzvah put a couple dimes in it. She go see a Drake show but never out of line with it. So every chance I get nigga I'm in it. Deep sea diving trying to see what I can find in it. So it's mine illy and that's a Porsche ain't it. So picture that and have Andy Warhol paint it. I'm a rude boy so I'm a go get it up. Rihanna post Chris Matt Kemp. Baby this is us. So talk to me. Have you ever been to Cannes. Yeah South of France next stop Japan. Let's go. [Chorus]. [End]. Alceu Almeida. Facebook: https: ww. facebook. com alceubrooklin"

Swayin in and out of white line, six double-oh. Deuce zeroes, I'm feelin like the streets is mine. Mines hustle, mucho dinero, heat's confined. See more fall guys than Foreman/Ali combined. If there's beef, I'm releasin mine. And I won't stop bustin 'til them Escalade seats recline. The kid roll with a greasy nine, come through and blast. I return shots like Arthur Ashe. You do the math, ten shots, ten dead bodies. Fuck bein sorry, it ain't nuttin but a gangsta party. And I'll make sure ain't a nigga survivin. Shoot up the ambulance, make sure it ain't a nigga there to revive him. And the Game ain't tryin to win, fuck the awards. So keep that little-ass horn, and that Neil Armstrong nigga. [Chorus]. [The Game]. Trust me dog, ain't shit you can put in your rap. that'll make you a gangsta, you a bitch and that's that. Niggaz thinkin I retired my Chuck, put the gun back in the holsters. Cause I weave through traffic in a roaster. But that don't stop the heater from bangin, or me comin through. Droppin all y'all niggaz with three in the chamber. Keep two mac-10's when I'm rollin, one in the changer. One when I push the button's right next to the cupholder. Dog we can get this shit over, I got ten on the Game. Let's say that Lee Harvey crack ya brain. Ain't gotta look over my shoulder, I'm good with the aim. Good with the handle and the bullet's good with the bloodstains. And the coroner's real good with that pickup. A1 good with the carpet cleaning, they can get the rest of that shit up. Cause I kill like the hiccups, two at a time. Put you niggaz next to each other how I do 'em in line. [Chorus]. [The Game]. Come through in a big boy, leave the bullshit at home. If beef cook then I'm bringin the chrome. If I die then I'm leavin a clone; but if I live. through the drama one mo' time then them boys gotta dig. When I think about who shot me, I listen to Big. When I'm rhymin on the road, I listen to Jig. Bump Nas off that purple, sittin on the block. And when I'm loadin up them clips, I listen to 'Pac. A semi with me like Eddie Murphy, got mo' guns. than F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S got jerseys. And you might get 'em all in the face when shit get thick. Make the back of your head look like Jerome Kearsey. And ain't nuttin to do a driveby in the hood. We ain't even got survival, but I'ma still take that ride. Bet my drink on it, bet my main squeeze mink on it. Think this shit a joke? Bet the S-5 pink on it. [Chorus]"
red bandana,"Not! [echoing]. Blackwall street. The game. Beach boy. Charli baltimore (he wears a red bandana). Rockstar. We are the black gang. Free shye. Mother fuckers! (he wears a red bandana). [chorus:]. On the front of murder dog (he wears a). On the cover of the source you see (he wears a red bandana). The whole world know (he wears a). Every nigga in the hood know (he wears a red bandana). 50 told the nypd (he wears a). Why you snitch on me and tell em that (he wears a red bandana). All the pirus know (he wears a). Even my crip niggas know (he wears a red bandana). [verse 1:]. Chea chea. Dear god let me clense my soul. Throw away all the rims and the gold. O no i cant do that. Do i love god? true dat. But i got a gun so move back. Im loco like 5 eses in the side of chevelle ridin on low pros. Im a renegade ride with the 44. Been a gangbanger all my life, fuck the popo. I aint never been a cocky kid. Know they could kill me if they shot pac and big. But i let my bandana hang. In the city of angels we gangbang. I move that chronic and yayo. Way before i met 50, banks, buck and yayo. Ask eminem, even dr. dre know. I put one in last ten in the range rov. Used to push that rock like jay hov. You better lay low when the ak blow. Or get wings and a halo. Run to the hood and tell em im the nigga they gotta pray for. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I said run to the hood and tell em im the nigga they gotta pray for, lay low and stay low. [chorus:]. On the front of murder dog (he wears a).

Im a gangbanger don't get it fucked up. You aint never bang, you aint never laces chucks up. So how the fuck you gon criticize me. I aint the reason niggas is bangin the nyc. Makin bullshit threats on the m.i.c.. I don't wake up in cold sweats when i sleep. I live comfortably. With a red rag tied around the 45 in case nigga try to come for me. Mad cause i started my own company. I don't know what the fuck niggas want from me. Except something for free. Before the documentary dropped, you bitch niggas wasn't bumpin me. And to some degree. I gotta keep that 4-5th under me. I don't run from beef. It's either cock back, squeeze, or be underneath. Cause im from the streets of (compton). And my grandmother died before i was multi. Wasn't raised right cause my parents was both high. High off cocaine, my introduction to the dope game came in 85 watchin soul train. Mama told me i was the future, and one day i'll be fly like soul plane. Just don't bang. But back then, i'd do anything for a jerri-curl and a gold chain. Niggas always got something to say. Like they aint never bumped n.w.a.. Punk niggas talk shit, but when they need hits they swallow their fucking pride and come runnin to dre. Niggas come to la when they need to talk. Cause kanye told everybody jesus walks. Bush killed more niggas in the towers then gangbanging ever did, that's why they need new york. [chorus:]. On the front of murder dog (he wears a).

remedy,"[The Game]. As my, Daytons spin, lowrider sittin low. Hittin corners so hard you can taste my rims. Rag top six-fo', Henny in the passenger side. Smokin chronic just (Let Me Ride). You would do it if my name was Dre, second comin motherfucker. Throw it up for the king of L.A.. I'm known for makin bitches take they clothes off. Long as I'm from Compton, California I could never go soft. I'm hard as a motherfuckin ounce of raw. Dribble rock like Kobe Bryant bounce the ball. Fuck the law!! Feedin my son is a must. Whip it soft, whip it hard, in crack we trust. Why Andrew Jackson look high as fuck on the 20, G answer. Cocaine been around for centuries. Since I'm young, black and rich, I'm the (Public Enemy). Ridin the bass drum, Just Blaze got the (Remedy). [Chorus]. [scratched:] ""Now they got me in a cell"" - Chuck D. I got the remedy. [scratched:] ""Now they got me in a cell"" - Chuck D. Aftermath got the remedy. [scratched:] ""Now they got me in a cell"" - Chuck D. Nigga back up (back up) back up (back up). 'Fore you get your punk-ass smoked. [The Game]. I ain't no joke G, so don't provoke me. I'm from the city of angels where that Jacob watch is a trophy. And starin at that Hollywood sign'll get you straight jacked. (Where you from fool?) Better say you pro-black. Causin walkin in Roscoe's wit'cha chain hangin. is like Giuliani tryin to get rid of the gangbaners. Now that 'Pac passed, tryin to put us on Death Row. Get ready for the Aftermath. I run through the city like Godzilla. Doin mo' damage than Ice-T when he dropped (Cop Killer). Pull a shotty out the trunk of the Chevy. There go another victim of a one-eight-seven. Who's the grim reaper wit'cha life in his hand. Even the toughest niggaz run when my gun go... blam. So kick back and watch the bitches dance.

The West Coast still dippin. Game still Bloodin, and Snoop still Crippin. So what you sayin loc? Red and blue bandana. tied in a knot, as I creep through the chronic smoke. They say it ain't good weed if you don't choke. Shit got my head spinnin like the hundred spokes. Three wheelin through the neighborhood. System on blast, as the motherfuckin one-time pass. The key to drivebys is aim steady. Turn that Bape hoody into motherfuckin confetti. When you cross that enemy line. Close your eyes, (Parental Discretion Iz Advised). by nbU."
ricky,"[Intro] (Boyz in the Hood). ""Shit! Rick!. C'mon man!"". ""Ricky!"". ""Help me! Help me! Somebody, help me!"". ""Ricky, Ricky!"". ""Ricky!"". [Verse 1]. Blood of a slave, heart of a giant. Had to leave Aftermath, Dre said I was too defiant. That was five years ago, look how fast it go. Destroyin' Interscope, shot myself like Plaxico. But fuck that, blaze one, where the matches yo?. Hit the freeway and see how fast the Aston go. Roll the window down, clip off the ashes so. You can see all my diamonds and how much cash I blow. How many bitches I fuck, how many cars I drive. How many goons I got, count 'em and they all outside. Niggas try to shut me up like Malcom. But standin' in the window caine smoking was the outcome. Sometimes I get a little stressed and pop a Valium. Hit Hollywood late night and knock down a stallion. So niggas think twice about my medallion or. You'll hear Cuba Gooding yelling ""Ricky!"". My nostalgia is one hundred percent Compton and zero percent snitch. Park a Bentley and the Phantom on blocks while I use the pitch. Made the Cincinnati fitted more famous than Griffey did. And just to think, several years ago they tried to split his wig. Two to the chest, struck his heart, one hit his rib. Then I blacked out, like a movie, all I could hear.... [Verse 2]. Feelin' all fucked up, woke up to a doctor. All I could think about, was that the cops took my weed and my choppers. They want me to sing, like Sinatra, I told the detective. Get this clear like Belvedere vodka. Them five shots created a monster. Hell's Kitchen comin' straight out of Compton. I seen Boyz in the Hood, Morris Chestnut was a actor. 2Pac was the real life ""Ricky!"". Then they shot down the nigga that shot him, I swear to God. If I'm lying then Compton is New York and I'm Rakim. I'm from where niggas get murdered over stock rims. And punched in the jaw just for a cocked brim. Nobody mama let the cops in, we ain't got no options. Wanted to be a boxer, but I was boxed in. Then my grandmother house went up for auction. And that's what tipped(?), I'm goin' back to buy the block then. Too many niggas locked in, dig up Cochran and defend all my niggas. With they faith under stockings, rather face God then 25 with no options. If Compton ain't the murder capital, we in the top ten. Drive by with our face painted, like a clown. With a tre-pound, forty shells bouncin' off the ground. This how my living room sound, when my brother got shot down.... (Crying (sample from Boyz in the Hood))"
rookie card,"[The Game]. You can catch five, or catch me in the CL-5. Whatever way dog, the Game get live. Keepin it gangsta in a P.D. fitted velour. Late night I'm in Dublin's and I got myself a four. The hood love me, hoodrats gotta hug me. Pop ex, spark the buba, the shit get ugly. Rock the mic anywhere, and I ain't talkin 'bout a concert dog. Talkin 'bout ten niggaz in converts dog. Get it crackin like we out in the yard, and the warden's watchin. Only difference is the whores is watchin. Still love to see a nigga, roll up on 20's. Hop in that six-four, roll up on Bentley's like. I'm a gangsta bay-bee from the C-P-T. Run with the +Pound+ like I'm from DPG. If it's beef, you C-Murder like it ain't No Limit. And I represent the P like Russell Simmons. [Chorus: repeat 2X]. I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right. Got it? Good, okay. It's the Black Sox and Get Low we get dough. In the Yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'. [JT]. I know ya, love to watch me, 'specially when I'm lookin rocky. The trey with the broccoli with my handles on the Kawasaki. Handle my jewels with the cuff in my shoes. Avi jacket on my elbow, 50 coast the jewels. In my neighborhood I'm Young Bill Gates, never shuffle the cake. So cover my face, and run up in the place. I'm a superstar, dick and my chain, glass bezel and bang. 80 karats on my pinky and rang. Crews buzz when you speakin my name, cause I'm deep in the game. With top cool thangs and million dollar planes. I'm a maniac, young boy gone, like a young Roy Jones. You ought of my zone and ain't nobody home. In my neighborhood, produce stars, stakes is high. Now we soarin through the spacious skies. Strap yo' body with them K's and ride, the handle is up. Switchin gears, hit the pedal and ride. [Chorus]. [The Game - fading out]. I'm a shining star. And I gotta hit the boulevard in that new Jaguar. Why he move through traffic like that, purple haze. Ralways, the Ojays, the gangsta lean so..."
rough,"[Game]. What do you do when life gets too hard for you. Shed tears or is that to hard for you. I'm just a man, reflection of my family. Meaning you ain't gotta have one to understand me. I got kids, I got friends. Only difference between me and you is I don't care bout this benz. I care about Will he was dying and he needed me. I care about the Grammy they gave Missy they cheated me. But they cheated Drake, they cheated Justin Bieber. Guess America don't like Canada we some fuckin heathens. Game can't watch his mouth thats why his daddy beat him. Same mouth made him millions and now his daddy need him. Finally got a black president look at how they treat him. Kids starvin in Africa why only Oprah feed them?. What happened to the music that I know. I miss it, U2 I guess we feel like Bono. [Game]. The living, the dead. These Dre beats, my head. My life, featuring Wayne. That was Jason, this is Game. Adjacent to the fame aint chasing a damn thing. So tonight let all of your pain be champagne. I cant tame my killers but I can tell them chill. I might give you a pass depending how I feel. The bi polar bear. They said the end of the World is comin I know it's here. Cuz California cold this year. Detox, R.E.D. MC's dead. Kill them softly like Lauren Hill. Skin heads goin K-K-Krazy cuz a nigga in a foreign wheel. We all born to die, some of us born to kill. If that don't wake you up I hope tomorrow morning will. [Yelawolf]. Never I thought I'd see the day when I, would roll up in the parking lot. And having people comin up to me for a photograph of the shit I talk about. Yela can I get an autograph Alabama so proud that we just can't wait. Congrats on the Shady deal, any news on the release date?. I told them what I can, shake another hand sign another autograph it's cool. Got fans gettin inked up, deticated to me I love you too. Got 3000 too, the spirit of rock and roll. Long barrell .38 loaded I'm John Wayne in Geronimo. So I dont really know whats got some these pussies panties in a ball. Cuz I never done shit but get better and believin' in God. And leavin' my mom at fifteen with a dream and a cross. A cross that I didn't see until I was nailed to it for believin' at all. That I could ever be accepted the way I saw it. I mean I knew it would be hard but really come on yall. Oh I'm a redneck? FUCK YOU tatted on my neck. I'll sip high life in a can at the grammys now add that to my rep. Bitch!"
runnin',"[Chorus]. Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me. Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny. (If you got it). I'm gone take it. (If you're in it). You're coming with me. (Bench warmers). Get no playing time. (No sleeping). Till I cross the line. I'm runnin'. [The Game]. With 99 miles left, on the Avis rental car. blowing horns like Miles Davis at the pearly gate. God let me in. Give me a room by Aaliyah with ESPN. I know I got more sins than two lesbians. Been back and forth across the border like Mexicans. But (I'm runnin') like New York pedestrians. Trying not to scuff my Nike Air checks again. It's funny how niggaz be the best of friends. And fall out over pussy and wanna dead they man. One of my niggaz in the grave the other one in the pin. She fuckin my enemies inside my homeboys Benz. Now she beggin God's mercy cause she ain't listen to Nas. And never heard about Ike and the Iverson jersey. He got a cousin named Jason that rock the Gary Payton. Now the same trifling bitch is a HIV patient. True story. [Chorus]. [Tony Yayo]. If I get knocked with my Gun nigga I'm runnin'. If I catch a murder one nigga I'm runnin'. Homicide come around and they keep on coming. That's why I'm out of state and I keep on runnin'. I ain't Nelly Put my desert eagles on girl. Just Jumped bail traveling the world. When I sign my deal I said fuck jail. I went on tour to Barcelona and Brazil. This shit real fuck an appeal. D's want my head like that bitch in Kill Bill. Sling dope sling crack and them e pills. That's why I'm on the low like a navy seals. I'm runnin'. [Chorus]. [Game]. Cause I gotta pack them shows. And Dre told me ain't no coming back from Go. So I gotta get my album in place. My G-Unit features. My Eminem sixteens. My Dr. Dre beats. And it was two years from today when I started rhyming. And took my demo to Suge and he ain't sign me. Niggaz threatening my life like it's hard to find me. See me shining in the hood like twenty inch Lexanis. My mom said I'm hard head. I don't follow the rules. Why should I when Reebok giving niggaz they own shoes. And I'm dealing with the same problems 50 Cent got. Yayo in jail and they think I'm trying to take his spot. I'm in the studio laughing at Chris Rock. Then I turn on MTV and see Soulja Slim shot. And niggaz trying to gun me down in the rim shop. Cause I just want the same recognition that the crypts got. They say I'm the next in line and if I get shot. Then I go out as the Bobby Fischer of hip hop. Make yo chest move. Sylvia Rome and Kevin Lyle slept cool. Jimmy Iovine was the best move. [Chorus]. .

Hip-hop death blow, Swizz Beatz, let's go!. [The Game]. My flow opposite of handsome, it's ugly. Hip hop tantrum, sick, call the shit cancer. One man show cause I fucked all the dancers. Let the critics ask questions, my album be the answer. These niggaz let the rumors sit in they head like tumors. So I had to take 'em back, to toothbrush on the Pumas. Clean... mean... rappin machine. Red rag hangin low in the back of my jeans. I black out like February, back out what's necessary. Oh-seven Bugatti with Jimmy Iovine's secretary. I'm runnin the buildin, don't make me run in the buildin. No this ain't the first time I had my gun in the buildin. Walkin past offices I see my son in the buildin. Last album on the wall I'm number one in the buildin. They should build me an office up under the buildin. My elevator goin down, I am done in the buildin nigga. [Chorus]. (ARRRRRRRRGH!). This is that disrespectful, motherfuckin West coast. Hip-hop death blow, Swizz Beatz, let's go!. [Swizz Beatz]. We in the motherfuckin buildin man. You ain't got your motherfuckin mind right?. You gon' get your mind blown out your motherfuckin mind right nigga. It is what the fuck it is man. How y'all wanna cut the cake?. You touch this you get your hands cut off, nigga. Swizz Beatz the motherfuckin monster. Game is in the motherfuckin buildin. We could turn this whole motherfuckin world red nigga. Bitch!. by nbU."
see no evil (feat. kendrick lamar & tank),"[Verse 1: Game]. I don't read the XXL. Told em .45 the church, think I'm destined for hell, oh well. Blood tears off the face of my Jesus Piece. It's bloodshed, feel the cracks in my city streets. I'm from the crack of them city streets. Used to sell crack in them city streets, born in Blood nigga. In a coma five days, life of a thug nigga. Momma ain't show, grandma almost pulled the plugged the nigga. Used to pull the gun out, just because of cuz niggas. Five shots to the head cause I'm a Blood nigga. Nuttin' brewing but suwoo'ing where the fuck I'm from. You lucky if you make it out of Compton, ask Andre Young. Smell the scent of dead bodies ridin' down Green Leaf. No peace so don't get caught up with no piece. Fuck Fatburger, we cooking that real beef. Momma's mourning they sons, I'm talking real grief. Real funerals of them lost Juveniles. Trying to be generals, be missing your dinner now, huh. Say its a blessing when you die in ya sleep. Cause the coroner don't need no sheets, capishe. I'm sayin', stop playing, wrap him up in what he lay in. Fold a nigga arms, now a caskets what he pray in. Compton streets raised me. Can't tell my grandma nothing bout her baby, you crazy. [Hook: Tank]. I said she see no evil. She gonna knock it at all. You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk. Say we on our way now, I'mma see you again. And when they ask you questions, you just answer. What happened then?. What happened then?. [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]. I live this life at a pace that anyone can go. Know your place and dedicate your role, to the faith that you'll die alone. Trace your steps when I do step in a fire of broken bones. And I require my heart's desire and when I reap what I sew. I bought my momma a Benz, my boobie a jag. A cut for my dogs with a roof full of glass. But still I be feeling like none of my light never casts. Out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast. But fuck that, I'm not worried, even when discouraged. Skirt off makin' them hurt off I should have hurt them in a hurry. Dirt off all under my fingers, dirt all of 'em gon is gone. Shirt off when precedure, resuscitation came early. I need you to keep quiet as a mouse. Which is ironic cause rats is what I'm talking about. I'm hearin the sonics of gun fire. The whispers, the silent cries even though I know it's an eye for an eye. [Hook: Tank]. I was born a soldier. Ride or die for mine. Tied two tears and a lawyer. Tried to give me love. Heaven can you heal me? I know that hell can. So heaven can you heal me?. I'm only just a man. [Verse 3: Game]. You want to go to Compton? Nigga I'll take you there. Hub City bodies get burnt butt-naked here. Respect the code, a nigga's calling from the pen. Colombian neck-ties on the outside from within. And then, your momma never see you again. Casket to never wake up plastered in MAC make-up, huh. Niggas can't hear you talking from the sky. And only five year olds see your ghost when you die, no lie. Karma catches up to all you head honchos. 2 Dome shots in that head, Griselda Blanco. Shit get real though inside the Foxhills though. Nigga living that fast life and get killed slow. Ask Wack and Draws if a nigga run the streets. My grandmother's prayers saved you niggas I never wanted peace. Los Angeles, I'm the motherfucking king here. No first 48 cause motherfuckers don't sing here. [Hook: Tank]"

And the nigga Paul Wall.. take his grill back. Gotta go back to Nashville, you gon' feel that. David.. this aint' no butterknife Dre shit. This is one shot, kill.. ask him where his face went.

speakers on blast,"[Game]. It's not usual, the game be, all up on some South shit. Straight West Coasting, you can tell by my outfit. Red 'nati fitted, ""Blood in, Blood out"" shit. Empty jelly jars, nigga, bird in the couch shit. The mad rapper, Oscar the Grouch shit. Except when I'm hopping out of cans, I'm pulling out shit. Dippin' the 4 though, double X 3-D Polo. If hip-hop was the league, I'd be the motherfuckin logo. Your last shit was so-so, you should sign to Jermaine. I've been hard since I was solo. Niggas feel my pain, I make it rain without the strippers. Go against the grain, and put your shit back like some clippers. I bang and then I hang out at the Staples like Blake Griffin. You can tell I'm getting money the way that glass house is sitting. I mash out the strip then like Nas when I'm dippin. Feeling like God's Son, the way that It Was Written. [Hook]. Them boys want they music on blast. Don't turn me down, turn me up every time them cops pass. Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask. Cause I got another ounce up in the stash. Them boys want they music on blast. Don't turn me down, turn me up every time them cops pass. Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask. Cause I take 2 hits, and then I pass. [Game]. I see the cops in the rearview, why can't a motherfucker chill in the car. Feelin' like Missy, why you all up in my grill. They must know that I got bird stashed all up in my grill. Camouflage by the Armor All while it's sparkling off my wheels. And I fuck hoes that prey on Dwight Howard and Shaquille. Not them throwback rats they be on showin' college hill. For real, I think my first album sold 5 mil'. And you say to yourself ""He's broke"". Well how the hell am I ballin', like Spalding. I did a couple of movies, now agents calling and calling. Can't get to the phone right now cause balls is all in this bitch mouth. When did we start taking these tricks out?. Now she gon' run her big mouth and tell her girlfriend. You had her all up in the wind. Blowing yo cheese on Louie Vuitton, and now that bitch is in the wind. And after the next draft, she gon' start that cycle again. How you claimin' that bitch when she with him?. Come again cause. [Hook]. [Big Boi]. Daddy Fat Sax, my balls are on your chin, but can you tell me where my dick's at?. Come order ghetto, head hunter, head buster through the chit-chat. I skip to the lou, my darling bring the thunder, I'm the lightning that strikes twice. Motherfucker, call me mass of, cause I run the plantation and I'm whooping niggas asses. If they disrespect the presentation, below the Mason-Dixon, we facin' the basses that were missin' pimpin'. You can embrace it or come face to face with total devastation. My mojo is never fadin', I'm in my Optimus Prime transform. Switch it up, heat it up, speed it up, that means I'm gone. Light years, ahead of your Buzz, Toy Story and club songs. Boy, gone, the A-T-L-iens are phoning home. But I feel like a librarian, cause style's are being' loaned out like books. A castle full of crooks, rape and pillage. They'll do anything for money, I bet misleading the village. [Hook]. [E-40]. Not from New England, but I pack a patriot. Not from Atlanta, but I got the cater. Not from Chicago, but I'm a bear. I'm a bay area nigga, 49er, Raider. I'm about my bread man, I ain't no sucker. Now these bitch ass niggas soft as table butter. I'm about my riches, magazines, street hustler. You can ask your uncles, daddies, mothers, and your older brothers. But I used to flee through that yellow white. Sellin' that shit below the retail price. I'm a rare breed like the bike club, get it right. Desperado like Tori Amos, shout out to dynamite. I got my red cup, and some green. What kind of green you smoking pimp? Blue dream. My nigga let my hit that there hemp, do your thing. How many woofers in your trunk? 4 15s"

I know he treating you like k-ci did mary j. I wanna ease ya pain, kick off your Louie sandles. Let me wipe your tears with my g-unit bandana.

Turn yo true religions into pajamas cause"
the city,"Intro]. Leave the angels in the city. [Verse 1]. Tell them muthafuckas I'm forever paid, California king. Wrestle gators in the Everglades, drive up out that muthafuckin swamp. In the Escalade so before you put that Red rag. In your pocket I wanna see your fuckin resume. Started off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate. Rip rappers a new asshole: I never hesitate. Dre Beats on, smoking that chronic just to meditate. I'mma give em hurricanes until another Levee break. You niggas is featherweights, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight. Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate. When a nigga (Wack?) found me, shit, I was selling weight. Now a nigga's selling millions, now it's time to celebrate. Performing in front of millions, nigga every race. 64 in the '64, now watch the Chevy scrape. 4th album, no 5 mics? Then let 'em hate. But I'm not stopping 'til I'm the fucking king in every state. [Hook: Kendrick Lamar]. Recognize my life, ridicule my fight, give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights. In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write, get familiar with Cartwright. Cause I wrote that shot, I'm a raging bull when the needle drops. For the record, I'mma wreck it, even if my record don't pop. I'mma tie your knot on a Downtown building, let the toll behind me tell 'em. They can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart, nigga fuck your feelings, this is me. [Verse 2]. I'm sick of motherfuckers talking about ""the West died"". Can't you hear my heart beating?. That's the motherfuckin West side, you test me, you test God. I'm his son, insane songs, you come at me. Then I can split you with this Tommy gun, you won't have time to run. I'm from the Compton slums and that's how the West ride. I'm from the city where 2 of the best died. Rest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em. Damn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of 'em. Name your top 10, I'm harder than the most of 'em. Matter of fact, shorten your list nigga, top 5. Game, Biggie, Hov, prolly Pac, Nas. No particular order, bet a mil that I slaughter. Serve niggas, give a fuck what you ordered. How dare you niggas pop fly when I'm the nigga. Sold 5 mil out the gate and numbers do not lie. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. I gave you the Documentary, shit was a classic. Gave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package. Came with LAX, since critics said it was average. I was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and. Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope. Spill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke. And this is what you all been waiting for. I'm the lost angel knocking on Satan's door. What the fuck y'all take me for? I love you cause you hate me more. I'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84. Shake you like Haiti's floor, walk up on you. Like ""what's going on baby boy?"" Shots in that Mercedes door. Either I'm crazy, or the black Slim Shady, or. That be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more. But I still owe Jimmy one more album. The best the West has ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin. [Hook]. [Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]. And I wear pendant on my shoulder, soldier. Like a lieutenant, and the coupe tinted got pulled over. Johnny always lock a nigga down. Knowing damn well we don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao. Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac. In his prime, thug life is now on radar. Til the federal come through and raid ours. Reminiscing when the LA Raiders. Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome. And I don't condone dickriding, I'm addicted to. Westsiding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die. And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion. Trying, and I mean that shit. Game came through, put the city on his back. I was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit. ""Compton!"", a nigga gotta scream that shit. Never went commercial, never T.V. screened that shit. Can't block or screen that shit, now everybody sing that shit. [Outro]. Red, is a very emotionally and instense colour. It enhances. Human metabolism, increases respiration rate and raises. Blood pressure. It has a very high visibility, it is why. Stop signs, stop lights and fire equipments are usually. Painted red. It also represents one third of Californias. Gang population. Needless to say, please dress. Accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area. Also, tuck your jewellry , and keep your hands inside your. Vehicle. Thank You! Enjoy it!"
the documentary,"[Boy talks to lady to start the song]. [Verse 1 - Game (DRE)]. What happened in hip hop. That got pac and big shot. The thicks blocks. Now every rapper claim. He let his clique pop. But even myself told the gun. To know the run then get shot. Ive been there before. Now im fuckin with doc. (Gotta do the Calvin Broadus numbers). If not i push rocks. Intisipatin my encarceration. Media think im fakin like mason. But when it comes to mase. Fuck r kelly i dont take it in the face. I find out who sprayed it. And im putting you under the pavement. No buddhist priest, catholic, or babtist pastor can save him. Im far from religious. But i got beliefs, so i put. Cannary yellow diamonds. On my jesus peace. I came back from the dead. Without a part of my chest. Layed in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest. I waited for 3 years. While everyone else dropped. Now i understand why NAS. Did a song with his pop. [Chorus x2]. Im ready to die. Without a reasonable doubt. Smoke chronic and hit it. Doggy style before i go out. Until they sign my death certificate. All eyez on me. Im still at it, illmatic. And thats THE DOCUMENTARY. [Verse 2]. If i die my niggas, fuck it. I did a song with Mary Blige, my niggas. Got a hook from faith. No verse from Jay. I guess on westside story. He thought i spit in his face. I told Ed Lover & Moni Love. I was talkin to Ja. With that mayback line. It was payback time. Keep fuckin with me nigga. Ill put you under me. Take your car and trade it in. For eight 3 hundred C's. If you cross my T. I dodt your eyes. You'd do life in a cementary. I'll do mine with shyne. Come home sit in the thrown. With my legs crossed. And my air force. Middle finget rough. Fuck the world. Cause im fellin like puff. When life after death hit. Mo' money, mo' problems. And i lost my best friend. Im the second dopest nigga. From compton u'll ever hear. The first nigga only put out albums. Every 7 years (haha). [Game (Commentator)]. (You know what speakin of Jay. That just makes me roll down. Now your song westside story). Ohh Ohh. (You got a line that says. Dont wear throwbacks. Or drive, ride in maybacks,. Is that a shot at Jay?). Naa, i was talkin about Ja Rule. Yeah, So, Yeah, i got a lot of. Respect for Jay. You know what im saying. I never take shots at legends. Thats just something i dont do. [Verse 3 - Game (Busta)]. Let me tell you why i do this shit. Im a son of a gun. Cause moms was a hoover crip. First day i got signed. I had to prove i spit. Freestyle with Busta Rhymes. (son you can sing). Told to Jay and Doc Dre.. I could finally put the shoes on. Now that the rumors of Rakim and cube gone. The q gone. They say truth hurts. Chunk, like quick sand. Dont stop me in traffic. And ask about hitman. I gotta restore the feelin. It crawled from under the rock. After the dog pound. Crushed the buildings. I got a family to feed. Im the middle of 9 children. We can talk about a loan. After i sell 5 million. If i tell you i aint game. And i dont know Dre.. You gonn do me like x-zibit. And cut half of my face?. I take all the credit. For putting the west. Back on the map. If you aint feelin that. Go sign Gorilla Black!!!. [Chorus x2]. (DOCUMENTARY). *Enviado por ""Sekef"""

"the good, the bad, the ugly","Yo you can keep asking them fuckin questions all fuckin day man. I told you what- I told you what the fuck happened man. Told your partner the same thing man, how long a nigga gotta stay here?. [Verse 1]. There was money on the table with the bricks. I was in the living room feeling on this bitch. Heard my car alarm goin off on my 6. So my dogs start barkin and some niggas hit the fence. So I take my dick out this bitch mouth and walked to the window. Pull the blinds down and took one hit of the Endo. You niggas ain't doin shit, but stealin my neighbors rims so. Walked back to the couch and told the bitch to bend over. That's what I'm rolling with... Nah I ain't saying shit and I ain't snitching on nobody. Yea that's my .45, but it ain't got no bodies. And 2 dead niggas? Them is nobody... They should've torched em, then you wouldn't had no bodies. I mean look at these pictures, just so sloppy. Couldn't have been me, I do my shit like John Gotti. Feed the nigga to the sharks after dark. Man fuck this shit I thought I told y'all. [Verse 2]. There was money on the table by the bricks. I was at the kitchen table choppin up some shit. Listenin to Jeezy and I heard a little (bullet sound). So I turned the radio down and cocked my 4-Fif, oh shit... Am I hit? Nah just a hole in my Jordan fitted. So I turn down all the lights and cock my 4-Fif. Seen some niggas jump in they escalade and that was it. How much longer I gotta stay in this muthafucka?. Let me get a cigarette, I don't even smoke but shit y'all got a nigga stressed. I gotta stay in this muthafucka until I confess?. Shit, y'all bitches better get some rest. Cus it'll be a cold day in Miami. Before I snitch on myself or the hood, you understand me?. Ya I fuck with the Bulls but I ain't Sammy. Niggas run around the hood singin.. They should get a Grammy. And you two muthafuckas should get an Oscar. With this good-cop-bad cop shit.. Take me to process. Cus I don't eat breakfast with no pigs. I watched First 48 so fuck your 25 years. No evidence, no big. I don't know who split them niggas' wigs. [Verse 3]. Already told y'all, there was money on the table with the bricks. I was walkin to the bathroom to take a shit. Then I heard my dogs barkin, there's some noise by the fence. So I ran to my room and reached for the 4 Fif. Then I seen three niggas by my back door. Looked out the bathroom window and seen two more. So I reached for my chopper and some clips out the drawer. Guess I had to welcome niggas to the gun store.."

Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack. (Compton!) Yeah that's the name of my hometown. I'm goin down, in the town, where my name is all around. A nigga just be hatin and shit, that's a pity. But I ain't doin nuttin but claimin my city. [Chorus: JT]. Where they actin a fool, and they carry the tool. Them sick dudes in the streets of Compton. Where I found The Game, he was stackin his change. to maintain in the streets of Compton. Took a trip to the Sco, got low for the dough. In Fillmoe from the streets of Compton. Now we stackin the bread, never run from the feds. They shed treads in the streets of Compton. [The Game]. See my lyrics are double or nothin provin to suckers I can throw 'em. Pass the natural 10 to 4 and six-eight before I go. Not really into freestylin, or tryin to promote violence. But they gotta know about the five-five-fo', so. That's how I'm livin, I do as I please B. A young gangsta put in work on these Cali streets. And everybody know, that you gotta be stompin. If you're born and raised in Compton. [Chorus]. [The Game]. Nowww Compton is a place, where all my niggaz chill dog. 'til I found out, the streets get real dog. 'Bout a year ago, somebody musta wanted me to die. Cause they kicked in the door, and gave the young kid five. They musta thought that I was gon' play the bitch role. Cause I lived through fo' five six holes. But I ain't goin out like no faggot-ass clown. They found, they couldn't keep a gangsta nigga down. So here's the burner in your face motherfucker silly sucker. ass clucker now you're duckin cause you can't stop a Y.G.. Gangsta, cause I'm true to my game. You're lame, and thangs ain't gon' never be the same. Cause a nigga like the Game is takin over. I really don't think I should have to explain. Oh yeah I'm a dog but my name ain't Rover. And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain. Sometimes I have to wear a bulletproof vest. Because I got the C-P-T style written across my chest. A gangsta motherfucker never ceasin to impress. My name is young Game so you can fuck, the rest. I'm comin like this and I'm comin directly. Cause niggaz gettin all stirred up, I'm doin damage quite effectively. Rhymin is a battlezone and niggaz can't win. Cause I'm a gangsta from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N. [Chorus]. [JT and Game ad lib shoutouts]"

til we meet again (r.i.p. frogg),"[Intro:]. Rest in peace to my motherf-ckin nephew Frogg. Niggas this fat rap nigga. Love nephew, see you when I get there. Meet me at the front door. R. I. P. Frogg. [Chorus:]. Livin on a day. Even though that I can't touch you. It will never be the same. I will always love you. Only you're so far away. Only you're so far away. Only you're so far away. I will always love you. Only you're so far away. [Verse:]. It's a problem they don't see the block. Block block soo woop til them heaters pop. Damn, my nigga dead in his grave and I can't wear this chain no mo. It got me feelin like a slave so I gave it to his pops in his memory. Loadin up the Glock, takin shots of that Hennessey. Layin on this table, getting tatted. And don't worry about who get it ‘cause we at em. That's on the block. I know you standin next to Pac. Throwin up the west side, polo down to the socks. And I'm selfish cuz I want you here. But you gone so it's chronic smoke in the air. And you know bad ass got a hot head. So it's on til a motherfucker drop dead. And even though it won't bring you back. I'm sippin on Rose clan, just me and my strap. Watching as the cars pass. [Chorus:]. Livin on a day. (Watching as the cars pass). Even though that I can't touch you. (Just watching as the cars pass). It will never be the same. I will always love you. Only you're so far away. Only you're so far away. Only you're so far away. I will always love you. Only you're so far away. [Verse:]. Swear to God I ain't slept in 5 days thinkin bout the 7 kids that you left behind. While I'm swerving on this highway. Reminiscing bout the time I joked about your cap. And how you wore that polo hat. Handin off yo head, point it to the back. Same smile since you was 10. And King Frog had you on his shoulders. Yelling see the burnin through the trap. Time flies, now we chasin all these hood rats. West side, you a diamond rollin through the hood, up and down the block. Pocket full of cash, fresh J's on the gas. Hop in the 1-10, meet the homies in the lot. Following this upper club and bout all the Ciroc. And remember when I bought your first bottle of sprays. Always down for yo niggas so you gave it to D Shade. So I brought a couple mo bottles, gold bottles. How a young seater becomes another's role model. Til we meet again. [Chorus:]. Livin on a day. (Til we meet again). Even though that I can't touch you. (Til we meet again). It will never be the same. I will always love you. Only you're so far away. Only you're so far away. Only you're so far away. I will always love you. Only you're so far away. [Verse:]. I was holdin on. Your funeral is jumped up. Cemetery flamed out, all the homies burnt up. Tryin not to shed a tear but I couldn't hold it. Your daddy took it like a G and everybody know it. I told yo mama yesterday I got er and I do. As long as they printin money and I'm bangin pyroo. If one of the kids needs something, niggas comin through. They don't just go for his, all the homie's kids too. And look how them niggas did you. Homie stretched out, retaliation is sketched out. And we at it to the day's end. Bustin on my enemies til it cave in. And to my brother face and my homie slim roo. You know I got this. And these going up, you got a hood full of riders. Laugh now, cry later, the sucker niggas that shut up. We part em, red see em using products. And then it's on. [Chorus:]. Livin on a day. (And then it's on). Even though that I can't touch you. (Til we meet again). It will never be the same. I will always love you. Only you're so far away. Only you're so far away. Only you're so far away. I will always love you. Only you're so far away. [Interlude:]. [Chorus:]. Livin on a day. (And then it's on). Even though that I can't touch you. (Til we meet again). It will never be the same. I will always love you. Only you're so far away. Only you're so far away. Only you're so far away. I will always love you. Only you're so far away"
too much,"[The Game]. I'm from the old hood, somethin like yo' hood. Where niggaz don't know good, or know Suge, but the blow good. So we rock it like Tracy McGrady. Send it to Houston in a gray Mercedes. I'm a product of my environment, grew up in the 80's. So that mean, me Kanyeezy and Jeezy all crack babies. And it's evident my flow is heaven-sent. First LP, on the same shelf as the veterans. Nigga I can't be fucked, like a lesbian. I'm to hip-hop what Cartoon is to Mexicans. I'm a artist, never claimed to be the hardest. Just number one since B.I.G. and 'Pac departed. Nate ridin with me, Snoop ridin with me. All you other niggaz used to be good like Ken Griffey. I'm on fire like the tip of a blunt. On fire like a nigga that let it drip for a month. I'm a Blood, you can Crip if you want, just let it bump. like you got Scott Storch tied up in the trunk. I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man. Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man. [Chorus One The Game]. Too much Cris' in the club not to get drunk. Too many bitches in the world not to fuck. Too much chronic in the studio not to roll it up. And too much bass in the trunk, so let it bump. [Chorus Two Nate Dogg]. You look like you mad as fuck, but who cares?. Grabbin her by the arm, cause she stare. Don't know how much atten-tion you pay. You better be ready to die, in this game. [The Game]. I thought I told y'all. I'm done with the beef clown, my son three now. And I've been watchin Dre so long I'm makin beats now. Game on the rebound like Ben Wallace in the D-Town. I mean Chi-Town, fuck it it can go down. Nigga I spit the whole round, fo' plus fo'-pound. Nigga this the wild wild West, call it a showdown. And I'm Billy the Kid 'til they split my wig. I come back from the dead, tell 'em kill me again. Put my head on the barrel, dare a nigga to shoot me. I'm gangsta, took more shots than Tookie. I'm alive, so I'ma take a Patron shot for Tookie. Roll a California blunt and keep watchin the movie. Inspired by this gangbangin shit since I was two. I brought the West coast back, what the fuck you do?. I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man. Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man. [Chorus One + Chorus Two]. [The Game]. Drive fast, both hands on the dash. Close both of your eyes and hope that you don't crash. It's lyrical homicide, both airbags out. Roll the fuckin windows down, let the bass out. Niggaz - drop the top on whatever in. Bitches - let your ponytail blow in the wind. Inhale the chronic, blow out dollar signs. Nigga you can drive a Bentley if only in your mind. Four doors, leather and wood. Ride like I got a horse stable under my hood. And I keep a chrome fo'-five under my hood. So if I die, nigga bury me under my hood. Who had the hottest bitch in the game, wearin they chain. Mr. H to the Izzo, Nas and Hurricane. Long as my family straight, read this at my wake. I gave 'em ""The Documentary"" and they scraped the plate. Twenty magazine covers, nigga look at his face. I can not, will not ever be replaced. I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man. Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man. [Chorus One + Chorus Two]. [Nate Dogg]. He wolfin a lot of shit, he look scared. You can't find your girl, she right here. I'm not a bad dream, I'm a nightmare. 'Sides there's way too many hoes in here. by nbU."

troublesome,"I'm too gangsta for the streets, watch me when I creep. I put five in your Jeep, leave a nigga sleep. Now you six feet deep over bullshit. Got a mac-10 mouth, ain't never pull shit. The ghetto don't make G's, it mold niggaz, get down or lay down. like Beanie Mac told niggaz or meet the fo'-fo' nigga. I let them guns blow, nigga I'm a rider. Thug Life 'til I die, Black Wall Street behind us. I'm a ""Menace II Society,"" fuck Caine and O-Dog. I got the 'caine and the O's, dawg. I'm gangsta like Hennessy and Alize, Thug Passion. Ride or die 'til they kill me or put me in ""Thugz Mansion"". Gangbangin, this California lifestyle got me heated. They want me buried, so I don't leave without the Desert Eagle. Shoot first, ask questions on my way to county jail. Kill a nigga over my chain cause I know I'ma make bail. I'm troublesome. [The Game]. ""If I Die Tonite"" - ""Bury Me a G"" amongst rap legends. Cause I spit bullets in rhymes, 16's and 9's. I keep a vest and a weapon, my baby momma got me stressin. Prayin on my knees every night askin God is there a heaven?. So here is my confession to my unborn child. Them five shots couldn't drop me, but I ain't take 'em and smile. I lost a lot of my niggaz to gangbangin and digits. One figure on the trigger dawg I live the life of a sinner. These motherfuckers wanna see me doin life in the pen. I'm a Outlaw, and the West coast is ridin again. My competition is none, I'm on a mission with guns. Starin death in the eyes, 20 niggaz deep when we ride. My enemies is bitches, they plottin on my riches. Can't walk in the streets without the paparazzi takin pictures. Label me a made nigga, all the way from Compton to Boston. These niggaz keep talkin I leave 'em dead in a coffin. I'm troublesome. [The Game]. Money over bitches is my motto in the streets I'm known for catchin hollows. Packin pistols and drinkin Belve and Grey Goose out the bottle. No role models, only killers and fiends. Witness my nigga strapped with gats and army fatigues. If it's murder he wrote it, if I'm lyin let the XXL quote it. And know that I'm strictly a rap poet. Baptized in my own tears, chastized by my own peers. I'm a product of my childhood years. My mother told me I'm HOPELESS, my pops wasn't around. One of the reasons why I'm clutchin the pound. California dreamin, chronic smoke out the beamer. One hand on the nina schemin got these hooptie bitches screamin. They know that I'm celebrity, keep them cop killers in the clip. And watch my back is what my niggaz keep tellin me. 21 years old, no felonies, so I ride with the Desert. And pay homage to the hardest rap legend. I'm troublesome"
truth rap,"Yeah, big spit, it's that Bay Area game, Sean T beats. We feedin the underground with this Yay Area tycoon shit. For my nigga JT Fig', y'all know where it come from. Never forget it, that Bay Area shit mayne. Y'knahmtalkinbout? Yeah!. Game, spit that shit. [The Game]. Hey yo the kid still at it, woke up from that coma. Seen hell came back and here comes my first classic. Still chop it up at the table, still put dope in the bag. and still got dope, under the mattress. It was hustle before rappin, nuttin before that and. 12 years old, a lost soul, bumpin ""Illmatic"". Gunshots tried and almost took the young kid's live. Can't do it I been through it the young kid survived. Got the ghetto on my shoulder homey, it's gon' be a long ride. Bear with me, I'ma take you there with me. Show you how the sun shine in one rhyme, no more stormy weather. Streets is mine, we gon' live forever. Get it together 'Pac is watchin, Big is listenin. Eazy is talkin to us, Big Pun is witnessin. While they souls still glistenin in ghettos from Compton to Brooklyn. the shells cry, every hood's anthem. Where everybody goes to church and prayers are never answered. And they throwin us curveballs but we Hank Aarons. A picture with no canvas, streets are so skanless. Young'uns jump rope, play ball with fiends and dope handlers. Teenage mothers, deadbeat fathers, no families. Lost and often runaway or live with grandparents. Life stories with no authors, see it through, {?} Robinson's cubicles. When time life is so beautiful. Walk with me we can make it if we try, lost soldiers sometimes. We gotta die but it's okay to cry. Mothers strugglin tryin to survive, reach out grab my hand. I got'cha, won't let you go for nuttin, I promise. Praises due to Elijah Muhammad, peace be unto Farad Muhammad. Words of Minister Farrakhan. Been true, be loyal, know your roots, water your soil. Stop fightin amongst ourself from birth we royal. Who's king we fightin over a crown, while lifeguards. watch the hopes and dreams of kids and young teens drown. More infants bein born with AIDS, more parents mournin graves. The plot thickens, somebody show us the way. Tears crackin the pavement, streets breakin up. The thrill is gone and it's a long walk home. So we might as well start runnin, if it's there gotta take it. 'Member Jada said ""We Gon' Make It"". And it shouldn't take 9/11 to bring our minds together. Shit rough we'll grind together. Light a candle we can shine forever or I can pass. So I won't miss Aaliyah's concert in heaven. Live life while we listen to my old heads. So I glow like the memory of Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopez. Through a six-seven Brougham, ride with me through the hood mayne. Where street lights flicker and Chuck Taylors hang. And nobody know they neighbor's name 'less they sell weed or cocaine. A lot of black clouds on a block but no rain. And Game got a lot to say, so they wanna take me down. in my own front yard like Marvin Gaye. Can't do it by myself, people need help. Keep on tryin to live healthy 'til the end of my days. And when I die won't lead my daughter astray, lookin from heaven. Watch my people drive my coffin through the Compton parade. [Verse Two]. I'm in the city where it's strange where killers follow direction. And trail witness protection to get a shot at they brain. Where the babies carry semis and swallow pills for power. Count paper for polly'n, penny-pinch for hours. Take sacks from cowards when the streets is watchin. Tuck guns in trunks cause real G's is boxin. Ain't no other options if you stand on your own two. And if you came to battle you can stand in the phone booth. Cause we don't wear capes in this part of the land. Cause every youngster from my block has been a part of the plan. I've been trainin since eighty-seven and famous since eighty-nine. Teaching came from the Nation, my spirit is from divine. When I, pass the word through these raps on beats. It's fo'sho' that the Lord gon' make the whole track speak. To the streets, when I pass these beats. It's fo'sho' that the Lord gon' make the whole track speak. To the streets, y'knahmtalkinbout people?. Make the track speak, ""Truth Rap,"" get it right. ""Truth Rap"" mayne, for the people, get it right, ""Truth Rap"""

untold story,"[The Game]. Niggaz don't really want it, just talkin out the side of they neck. How many gangsters you know, ain't scared of death. That's why I, ride with tecs, soon as I pull 'em out. breathe easy nigga they tryin to get them bullets out. It was all good a week ago, you was callin shots in the hood. Bitch now you so {?} the hood. Used to be a gang leader, now your gang need ya. But no more rocks or dope spots in the hood. Ghost town, niggaz won't even walk in your hood. I want respect like when niggaz is talkin to Suge. You cats gon' get with that, or get with the +Mac+. And I ain't talkin 'bout +Beans+, talkin 'bout this gat. The kid still a hundred miles and runnin. Niggaz smoke 10 boxes of Newports, when they know I'm comin. And fuck MTV, I live in +The Real World+. Call my guns R. Kelly, they'll touch your lil' girl, cause. [Chorus 2X: JT]. Layin with dogs, you gon' wake up with fleas. Fuckin with rats, you'll never get yo' cheese. You know J cats, like to sell you dreams. And a snake gon' scheme (and a killa will do anything). [JT]. It's a done deal, Seth's back, makin it hot. No questions, I'm takin my spot. Project walls, hoods and blocks, Get Low, we hard to stop. JT, and the Game is hot. It's so necessary, these dudes are so scary. When I cruise through Bentley Coupe that's cherry. Tailored suits and gators, man, laughin at these haters. Man, show me the money then, pay me man. It's a new day, same team, I'm still the ghost. Big crib, jet skis and boats, listen close take notes. Mink coats and diamond clusters. West coast we nothin but hustlers. We grimy and gritty, cool like dat, old school fools. Willy Ness throwbacks, we send tricks to the nearest track. Who you know that's as real as that?. I pimp this game like Goldie the Mac, holla back. [Chorus]"
walk thru the sky,"Open your eyes, we in a new era. Less drama more unity, everything's lookin a lil' clearer. Like a face in the mirror karma. It was right before our eyes, facin the future I cried. No more Martin Luther shots, from off the words from Malcolm. Tunes from Jimi, it's sad but you gotta hear me. All praises due to the mighty Allah, God forgive me. I've been through it, but it's not all bad in me. A young kid tryin to change his ways. Every day a lil' closer, show him the light let him pave the way. Gotta see my grave someday, no more cheddar, some pictures. Grandma I'm comin to spend forever wit'cha, I miss ya. No more Sunday dinners, wish you could see your grandson now. Got bigger, all grown now. Got a daughter think she grown now, just started walkin. Just started talkin, she can potty on her own now. Life is good, memories are better. We all gotta go, I know it's cold grab a sweater. We can take that ride together, cry whatever, die whatever. Walk through the sky together, huh"
we ain't (feat. eminem),"[The Game]. Hahahaha, ladies and gentleman. You are now about to witness the strength, Aftermath. Straight out the mothafuckin' streets of Compton. Put your hands together for Game bitch! Hahahaha. [Eminem]. Yeah mothafuckas. Compton's back on the mothafuckin' map. Aftermath in that ass bitch!. Game, let's go. [The Game]. Me and Marshall ain't start shit, they listen to our shit. and talk shit about us, but that shit is foul. when I'm tryin' to feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums. Make my mother proud that her son made it out. But it's hard when they hate us, and think Em a racist. They say shit, but fuck them, Shady one of the greatest. Like Biggie and Pac was, we started throat was empty. and decided to chase it, me him and 50 racin'. This rap shit is basic, I followed that Jay shit. Think of what I wanna say, step in the booth in one take and. How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits. Then spit that classical LA, N.W.A. shit. The media is bullshit, now we can't even say ""bitch"". They accusin' Michael of touchin' kids in the wrong places. At first they embraced him, had a couple of face lifts. Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists. They comin' I can taste this swear to God I ain't racin'. Put the clip in and wast 'em before I go out on that fake shit. I'm so sick and tired of this black shit, this white shit. So I sit here and write shit, Em they ain't gon' like this. So they callin' us. CHORUS. (We ain't, goin', nowhere, so fuck you). (We ain't, goin', nowhere, so fuck you). [Eminem] This day, The Game, will never be the same. [Dr. Dre] Things just ain't the same for gangsters. [Eminem] The Game just isn't the same, it's changin'. It's a new Game! You're now about to witness the power. [Eminem]. Only Dre can, judge me for the mistakes I'm makin'. If I'm fakin', I'm Clay Aiken. You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame, you're tame. Bitch, your mind's lost, you ain't ready to make that flame switch. You'll end up in the same situation, same shit. Different day, just with different gangstas in your face. Which way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement. Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it. For the day that they got them affidavits wavin' in my face. Lookin' for answers, rap sensation. Eminem battles to ward off, accusations. That he had somebody blasted. The mask of Jason was found at the scene of the task with masking tape. And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case. And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wastin' too much time. Me no kiss ass, and if that's the case, then we ain't goin'.... Chorus. [The Game]. Lo get Dre on the phone quick. Tell him Em just killed me on my own shit. I'm walkin' through 8 Mile, startin' to get home sick. I'ma do Shady numbers, I'm ridin' my own dick. Yeah the chrome sick, the window's tinted. If Eminem is in it, body armor under the panel. Ten these niggaz is killin' it, take a minute to listen. Turn down my Jimmy Hendrix, I'll throw your demo out the window. For tellin' me it's hot when it's not and you got what you got. From them rocks on the block, you can stop tellin' Dre you got shot. with a glock that don't phase me, I'm crazy. Why the fuck you think I'm rhymin' wit' Shady. I don't care if the radio don't play me. I say what I say when I feel like I'm feelin' today. And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets. I can't even take my son to cop them G Unit sneaks. So I'm gone bitch. Chorus. [Eminem]. Yeahhhhhhhhhh! Oh!. G shit homie. Can't do nothin' but respect. So shut yo' ass up, Aftermath motherfucker. Haha, Game, Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, G Unit!. G-G-G-G-G-Unit!"
we are the champions,"[Chorus]. I am the champion my friend. And I'll keep on fighting 'till the end. I am the champion. I am the champion. Don't end for loser cause I am the champion. Guess whos back in a son of a bitch. Underground king with a gun on his hip. Not the UGK like Bun B and Pimp C. But I got the Ghost Unit bumpin in my Bentley. Ain't shit changed with the guts in a range. And no more Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck in my lane. I'm a hood nigga for real motherfuck the fame. Nigga I'ma get mine. You can hate it or love it but it's a thin line. Between G-Unot and G-Unit. Nigga talk shit catch one in the hip. Fuck beef for the rhyme. 50 forgot about his but I took mine. I showed you all 5 but he never took 9. He rap like Trina blah blah blah. Ok, shut up. Let us see the wound. Show it to the world. He got shot in the mouth and cried like a girl. You sing like a girl. And I gangbang so hard it'll bring back curls. I'm tellin' your fan don't believe that shit. Tryin beef with The Game like he that sick. You movie was trash and I went to see that shit. With a camera and got it on DVD that quick. Chicken Little and Harry Potter. The bootleg hell yeah we got 'em. Two movies 15 dollars with no numbers on the bottom. Hahahahahahaha.... Chicken Little ghetto pimp!. [Chorus]. I am the champion my friend. And I'll keep on fighting 'till the end. I am the champion. I am the champion. Don't end for loser cause I am the champion"
we are the hustlaz,"Yeah.... Yeah man we them niggaz everybody talkin 'bout. Hey yo, yo. [Verse One]. Whether it's, chips or whips or bricks of 'caine. I still shine at the end when y'all forced to rain. Changed the game, three shots parade ya Range. Hit the passenger, driver, old man on a cane. I'm a shell in the chamber, waitin to pop. Like Stoudamire on the court I'm used to movin the rock. Cruise in the drop, 740, snub in the box. My attitude shifty, never callin the cops. A Green Bay jersey, out on Bennett puffin hershey. D's on the route tryin to catch a nigga dirty. Respect the flow, better yet respect the dough. He get respect like rich and po'. Fuck a 9 to 5, I'd rather wake up and spit bars. And your wife, known to make my dick hard. Cartier lenses, 22's on my Benz's. When shit break out, y'all hit the fences. [Chorus]. We stay bent, laid back behind tint, puffin sticks, spliff up. We are the hustlers everyone's talkin about. Big belt, flossy shades, paint on glaze, nigga. We are the hustlers everyone's talkin about. Unidentifiable straps makin heat clap sicker. We are the hustlers everyone's talkin about. We about reliable scratch and gettin this math quicker. We are the hustlers everyone's talkin about. [Verse Two]. Shit I might as well be duels, cause they call me the Flowmaster. I keep ridin tracks like a natural disaster. You know I'm 'bout macra{?} I'll clap ya, a pirate like {?}. Far from a Hollywood actor. A factor, focused on paper and cars. I move like crowds, stay minglin with the stars. I'm in the 6500 Benz truck with some broads. Dimes in every state I strike through be on me so hard. You know them Bentley bound, {?} down, wild Hummer chicks. That wanna take the car, cover up your tight summer shit. The game's heavy, man that's way off the charts. Heavier than killer whales at animal theme parks. You niggaz is SweeTarts, my family is street sharks. We keep the ER busy tryin to revive the treat marks. Shit, we merk niggaz like Eddie, get ready. We got heat that set car alarms off like M-80's. [Chorus]. [The Game]. The Game on some regular rhymin, fuck all this new shit. When they gon' let real niggaz get on that cruise ship. Black Sox and Dallas Squad got, chains and cars. Get, brains from stars after those awards. Miyagi's or doubles, don't think I won't buy out the bar. That's little shit, Mercedes dealership, buy out the cars. Sticker in the window, let 'em know that it's ours. Sittin on shit you ain't never seen like we got it from Mars. Game like Laker Will, snatch a bitch off your arm. She see Game covered in ice like I lived through a snowstorm. Plus I blow digits like my first name was {?}. Pay off security at clubs, get our guns admitted. Outside the club in the parkin lot, four dot six. Not know it's stocked? Nigga it's the one we keep the bricks in. Hard black on black leather's what we keep the chicks in. And bitches stay sniffin like smellin dubs is a sixth sense. [Chorus]"

when shit get thick,"[The Game]. Who really the best rapper since 'Pac got killed. I done answered that question when I copped my deal. Ask yourself when the Game is comin, after next summer. I predict my shit'll drop before the next Howard homecoming. Now who in the runnin, no one, ask the niggaz who want it. I got a four-fifth and it just like me, it stay gunnin. Me and my niggaz stay blunted fogged up in the 600. Guilty as charged, blunts in the air, guns in the doors. It's written, Compton niggaz never run from the law. Plus we get Monopoly money with hotels and a board. So I'll never see a jail, and I'm allergic to bars. Can't sit behind 'em or drink at 'em, so we travel with ours. Poppin Crist' in the 6, like we drivin through Mardi Gras. Thinkin 'bout beads and titties as I roll through the city. And I keep 16 in the clip, and I let 'em all go. like the Lakers did Ellie, Atty and Nick, huh. [Chorus]. When shit get thick, niggaz start dyin. Bodies pop up in dumpsters, mothers start cryin. Payback come through violent, nigga. We hit blocks, bust shots, leave ya whole block silent, cause. When shit get thick, niggaz start dyin. Bodies pop up in dumpsters, mothers start cryin. Payback come through violent, nigga. We hit blocks, bust shots, leave ya whole block silent. [Sean T]. No garbage we smoke molta, move big cocoa. We off the train tracks like the great space coaster. We hit real big and consistant like Sam Sosa. Prepare for war, like United States soldiers. Lock tight and rock right like grey eight oz's. I'll be hittin up spots, in them flip Range Rovers. Before you even try to play, foolish all over. Empty out yo' pockets, turn everything over. We ball out cursin yeah we keep it the sickest. When we roll by the quads in them Z-66's. Big spittin, grip kitten, that big face greed. Always dirty never clean but we live like kings. Legendary like Sting, it's a history to follow. But not known for stingin known for gettin off hollows. Shoot me a glass of Remy, nah fuck it the whole bottle. And watch me act bad and take off, full throttle. [Chorus]. [JT the Bigga Figga]. I'm from a batch where it ain't no cut, we all in. 36 on a triple beam scale for meal. Duffle bag on my shoulder my route, through the back of the jet. To bag up baguettes and everybody know it. I'm the iceholder makin the cut, never breakin 'em up. My favorite color is rainbowed up. Ain't a coke dealer, but I got bricks for cheap. Hit the lab for a fo' day block, we got heat. You niggaz can't compete when I walk in the streets. We Get Low, and there's no idea with the info. It's a rule of thumb, let them dudes a come. I'm cruisin some, 20 inch shoes and some. I'm in the widebody XM-5, all my snakes is live. We check your five, the spot where the tec dies. And everybody gotta holla the name. It's JT from the Fillmoe streets to CPT"
where i'm from,"[The Game]. I'ma B-L-double-O-D. Been on songs with S-N-double-O-P. Inside a Ferrari with the D-R-E. Run up I let it sing like Nate D-O-double-G. Walk through 8 Mile, G-Unit's on my feet. Got a cherry lowrider in the N-Y-C. Eve took me to Philly, never been to the pen. Been to Uptown with 50, seen niggaz in Timbs. I done seen Young Buck scuff Air Force Ones. in Cashville, but Compton is {where I'm from}. Where it's just me, my son, and my bitch. She graduated when Notorious B.I.G. dropped ""Me & My Bitch"". She get them birds past, I put her in first class. And tell her to carry on that Duni & Burke bag. She from Grape Street, she know how to work the mag. And only buy white tees, tell 'em to keep the purple tags. Cause the laces in my Chucks keep the beef crackin. I lay niggaz out like creased khakis. In that G-wagon, lean like the 23's draggin. I got the whole N-Y-C saggin. [Refrão: Nate Dogg]. If you don't know. (Aftermath, nigga witta attitude) (Game time niggaz, Westside). Where I'm from. (Nigga witta attitude) (Straight Outta Compton) (We rock khakis and Chucks). If you don't know. (Almost lost my life when Dre dropped The Chronic) (Legend in the making). Where I'm from. (Aftermath, you better watch your colors in the City of Angels). [The Game]. Y'all niggaz got it fucked up. What you thought cause I'm from Compton I couldn't do numbers like Usher?. Platinum certified, nigga that's a mill' plus. Play both sides of the fence cause the Crips feel cuz'. See me ridin with Nate, nigga it's still Blood. You can C-walk to this, homey it's still love. Nigga I've been bangin since Mary J. did ""Real Love"". (If you don't know) I painted the Rover black. The West coast is back, I can smoke to that. Moms got the CL-6, that's a fact. I bought the house, I'm just waitin on the platinum plaques. Niggaz lookin for a cat to jack. Homey I'm willin to do two life sentences back to back. So please don't push me... You niggaz is W-N-B-A, all pussy. [Refrão - 2X]"
where you at? (the whole city behind us),"[Verse 1: Kanye West]. Yeah, yeah - I used to front when I write songs. Talk about havin ice on, and I could barely keep my lights on. And my beats was so sick, I shoulda got a medic. But my credit was so pathetic I couldn't afford a debit. When the dropout dropped, I had to cop me a money tree. To front on anybody who ever tried to front on me. With so much personality, what do you want from me?. I could be by myself and enjoy the company. My life, this year, my career, is the Lord. Bad chick, this award, is for Melissa Ford. Ninety-four I could only afford this Accord. From the home of gangbangin and we all outdoors. Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride. Eastside, right B-Side, Lakeshore Drive. And I'm (and I'm) Chi-Town's finest. Where you at? The whole city behind us. [Chorus: Kanye West]. Where you at? The whole city behind us. Where you at? The whole city behind us. Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride. Where you at? The whole city behind us. [Verse 2: Ludacris]. It ain't nuttin to it but to do it! I came here. to shut the place down 'til my body stops pumpin red fluid. A-Town I've been through it! And we steady gettin tested. But ready to fill your bubble when we put the lead to it. Out West they still bangin, up top it's really gully. Down South we get buck and turn hearts to Silly Putty. Ludacris I got silly money - you got jokes?. I'll be laughin all the way to the bank - now that's really funny!. Big city bright lights - and many pity cause we like fights. May be long days but it's fright nights. Living out the night life - and people asking 'Where You At?'. Not the club; I stay in the get right!. Hotlanta home of the booties and the really tight skirts. Where if somebody moves then somebody gets hurt!. From Decatur down to CP, and EP. Adamsville to the battlefield it's D.T.P.. [Chorus]. [Verse 3: The Game]. It's Compton's prodigy. Obviously I'm from the home of hydraulics. Where they tie bandanas around the steerin collar. 'Nuff Impalas in to get holla. We fightin pitbulls and Rottweilers. In the projects the objective is make dollars. 'Where You At?' It ain't a problem to get it there by tomorrow. Cause I got a female friend, with frequent flier mileage. I ain't never been to college got the IQ of a Rhodes Scholar. If you follow G-Unit throw up your dubs and yell holla. To all the Y.G.'s in khakis and white tees. With And 1's in every colour like Ice-T. I might be the city of Compton's right knee. The way I paint pictures with these hip-hop scriptures. Pay attention while The Game shine like a prism. Glisten, show you how canaries can alter one's vision. Not to mention I am Dr. Dre christened on behalf. of Luda and Kan-Yeezie, I'm gon' breathe easy. [Chorus] - repeat 2X"
who the illest,"[The Game]. Who the illest hub dawg you know. Peelin slugs at your mug, dealin drugs in front of the projects. My projects, more scatter, more street. Makin room for more drama, more hustle, more heat. I can show you how to get, American money easy. It's the gangster, all motherfuckers envy. Leave all semi I tote, clips empty. Foes tempt me, I'm seein no penitentiary. Crime scene clean, shells, no prints. Flee the shootout, X-5, no {?}. It's meant for me to survive this gangster shit. Meant for you not to be livin, food for the pigeons. It's rules I'm givin, new lessons for the street. This jungle I'm from B don't breed no weak. Lames that don't know the game please don't speak. You get killed, want me peeled, I'm showin no {?} nigga. [Chorus: The Game] + (Sean T). Every nigga out there claimin to be the illest. I don't know if y'all know let a nigga know I'm lost in the stipulations. Niggaz hatin, everybody waitin for the outcome. Whatever happened to just to rappin?. (Mic graspin, freestyle flow flashin). (Rippin up tracks and, doin the thang). (What'chu niggaz know about Sean T and the Game?). (Who's the illest?). [Sean T]. I'm off the rack like slabs of ribs, I want it big. I ain't fuckin with kids, I'm after six digit things. Fuck the rings and the tribulations, constant playa hatin. This crimin-al lifestyle, keeps me animatin. Let's turf talk before you niggaz thuggin it up. It don't matter if you Crip'n, or Blood'n it up. Dallas Squad blooded it up, smashin on sight. But he hoppin on haters like BMX bikes. Fuck around with the Squad see unbearable sights. We takin gangster shit to the maximum height. But I'm mainly into bubblin, fat grip doublin. Big heads I'm lovin 'em, you feelin me y'all. Leavin the envious in awe cause I tremendously ball. I'm supported by the Game so you know I won't fall. I'ma execute my options, keep wettin my paws. And come out unscathed with no scratches or flaws. Who's the illest. [Chorus]. [The Game]. They say ""Game, you rappin like you from the East coast,"" meet toast. Gun jammed in your throat, forgot that you spoke. Game got the streets woke young'n, same nigga got the coke runnin. Introduce the new fiends to smack. Pops told me when I was younger, you can't live like that. So I don't listen to pops nigga I listen to Kool G. Rap. Went from hustlin sacks to heavy weight, shufflin crack. Kids and preachers know me, young Game the O.G.. Ask the reverand kept the church from fallin, young'uns from starvin. I'm the project like Marcy or the Nickerson Gardens. Comfortable dawg, Compton to Harlem, any city ghetto or hood. Kick back, blowin, listen to Marvin. Get head, count dough and just sit in the apartment. AK in the sofa, I'm the illest, who come closer. to the late ones or great ones fightin over a crown. Get shot off that throne, who the illest now, huh?. [Chorus]. [Sean T]. Some say the gangster mentality is dead, imagine that. When fools pullin straps out with infrared. We're livin in a time of plagues and corrupt life. When homies in the circle end up all trife. Tryin to shine bright, but lookin all dim. Meanwhile I stay sharp like a ballpoint pen. I see the smirks and grins but I just laugh. Cause I'm gettin lucrative loot, endless math. If you only knew the half of it, you wouldn't hate. But niggaz just pig and talk shit behind Jake. Man you cain't knock the hustle, I ain't fin' to be greedy. I want an exit out the game kinda like Paul Vitti. I'm tryin to slang CD's in cruise control. Instead of sellin illegal pharmaceuticals. Should I ask for your advice? Like you would know. Fuck it, I'm out to get it, I'm a fool for dough. [Chorus]"

"why you hate the game (feat. nas, marsha ambrosius)","Y'all know what it is. The streets named me Illmatic. For that I'm still at it. Can't hate us. Fellas. Vice behind me on the intersection. Sex and drugs, my anthology on perfection. Dress superb, admired by conspirers. Who wanna try me. But ain't high enough to four-five me up. Child of the eighties, y'all niggas is lazy. Complain about labour pains. Nigga show me the baby. And my nigga Game. Light another L, pass the bottle. Pro-black. I don't take cotton out of aspirin bottles. Yeah, I learnt my lessons. And heard y'all snitchin'. Witnessin' you rockin' [?] with Nas. Confirmed my suspicion. Green fatigues on, My niggas I bleed for 'em. I can show 'em the water. But can't make 'em drink it. And I can show 'em my fortunes. But can't force 'em to think rich,. And still I don't abort 'em. When and if they sink quick. Ignore the ignorance. I rep the brilliance of Queensbridge. And pray to fans, let Murder Inc. live. (8 Bars... kind of). I don't talk about my guns, nigga I just blaze. 'Pac is watchin', Big is listenin'. While Pun talkin' to us, Jam Jay still spinnin'. To every nigga listenin'. I was supposed to be amongst kings. My Mom shouted out at my Christening. And while you still listenin'. Shyne locked in a man hole. Cam got shot inside his lambo'. Sample, life is a gamble. 15 years old red rag around my hand. My sisters used to laugh and call me 'Rambo'. Seen Eazy's legacy melt away like a candle. I rekindled the flame. Dre created The Game. nigga with an attitude from the cloth I came. Young homie ate his way up. From the bottom of the food chain. Keep the crown, clown. I rock an La Dodger Fitted. I showed my ass at Summer Jam. But New York was down with it. Now the ball's in my court. Never dribble out of bounds with it. Behind the back to Nas. He alley oop to Jigga, Nigga. (8 Bars). Me and nasty puffin', this a classic, trust me. How you gon' pass the dutchie. To them niggas that don't love me. I'm talkin' niggas. That never wanted to see me on top. Same niggas that never wanted to see. The Doctor's Advocate drop, flop, I think not. I'll fuck you rap niggas like virgins. Dre took my training wheels off his curtains. I don't need no encore, no claps, no cheers. The Game ain't over. This the beginning of my career. The ending of yours, the endin of his. Like Flavor Flav's clock. I'm back to handle my biz. N*gga, it's Game Time. That was Dre's favorite line. Back when proof was in the booth. And I recited his lines. And I still think. About my nigga from time to time. Make me wanna call 50. And let him know what's on my mind. But I just hold back. Cuz we ain't beefin like that. He aint Big, and I ain't Pac. And we just eatin off rap. One love. (8 Bars). I'll do Marsha's bit if you want. But it seems kinda pointless. I thought Nas was on point with his multis. The cotton line is a bit old though"
work hard,"[JT]. Get Low Records motherfucker. Bringin the best to the table. Bluechip, Nina B, {?}, what it is. JT Get Low motherfucker that's what it is motherfucker. Yeah, who fuckin with us nigga. Now (what goes around comes around). I'm puttin this clique up nigga against all you niggaz. Now get it right. [Verse One: Bluechip]. Hey yo, this is where I see me in this game. Benz Coupe, Maserati, plus I got your bitch all in the Range. And y'all niggaz ain't gon' do shit, soon as your crew spit. My tool spit, metal to your side, watch you lose hips. And I ain't want to take it there but fuck it we can bang. My Cali headbusters'll show you how to throw them things. I'm too connected like John Gotti and Nino. For a small fee they find your body wreakin out in Reno. I know the niggaz that sell weight, and niggaz that stick the niggaz. that sell weight, hammer close behind me like when you tailgate. I know you a snitch, I can see it in your eyes. Shackled up, D.O.C.'s, all my niggaz on that ride. You can, stunt if you wanna, Chip is a gunner. Been reignin/rainin since ninety-six now it's time for the thunder. [Verse Two: Nina B]. In your mind you can blame me but open your mouth and name me. I'm runnin you out of office you're softer than Bush and Cheney. Go 'head, and try to play me I do you like I was Amy Fisher. Smokin a Swisher like I wish a bitch would. Listen and use your vision cause livin in this - hood. And sinnin in your division you think it's all - good. Got niggaz on +Death Row+ and it ain't about Suge. Niggaz that stay home they scared to come out shook. Mothers with five kids and all of 'em got took. It's right in these niggaz face, but they just will not look. I'm tired, of the B.S. I'm cheatin {?} some rejects. Even though we make the best of what little respect, we get. This is the life, that was given to me. A rich-ass bitch that's what I'm fittin to be. Brooklyn to Bangkok I'm beggin to be. And don't nobody write, what I'm spittin but me. Nina B. [Chorus: JT]. We 'bout to blow this bitch. Niggaz work hard in the game so they notice this, what. We 'bout to blow this bitch. Niggaz work hard in the game so they notice this, what. Underground with it, poppin collars now. Bust yo' shit nigga, put them guns down. Put yo' knuckles up, catch you slippin dawg. That's how we do it independent now we 'bout to ball. [Verse Three]. For years niggaz sold me dreams that got me gassed. Made me want to get revenge or get the hockey mask. Got beef? Yo the burner's in the lobby stashed. Get your crew if you want, all them niggaz is probably ass. I take the long way, fuck takin the shortcut. Now we got corporate sponsorships wrappin our tour bus. A quick 32, yo them shits is like warmups. It ain't coincidental in the hood we was born tough. You chump or get chumped, punk or get punked. Save your lil' craps homey, fuck it get drunk. Was one at the top, but now I'm back at the bottom. Most 'em hate to spit with me cause when I rap I surprise 'em. Shit is real, that's why I stay strapped with a condom. I keep 31 flavors just like Baskin & Robbins. I'm here now, y'all supposed to be stressed, scared to death. that you gonna be next, record labels, promote the rejects. While starvin artists is closest to sets. And certain niggaz duckin me because they owe me a check. I spit more heat, than a bowl of chili, y'all niggaz know the deally. So turn the music up and roll a Philly. [Verse Four: JT]. Yeah, roll the Philly or Swisher Sweet. And I ain't trippin while you niggaz just stand on your feet. Figgaro done walked in the building, it's time to expand. Comin with hundreds of grands and hundreds of plans. You see this Black Wall Street is for the po' broke and hongry. None of my niggaz on the corner never be lonely. Stuck in the gutter mayne, coke packs like Tony. Bricks and pounds of weed half the city owe me. My shipment too big, frontin out the homies. I ain't even trippin mayne my pockets never lonely. Benjamin Franklins and Grants stick together like. Boys in tough weather makin noise forever, ahhhh. Yeah mayne, it's real shit nigga and we independent nigga. Fuck what'chu heard dawg, independent is where the money is at nigga. Fuck all your major labels nigga, that's what it is. JT the Bigga Figga, Nina B {*fades out*}"
wouldn't get far,"[Intro: samples from ""I'd Find You Anywhere""]. For you baby, I'd find you [4X]. You wouldn't get far. [The Game]. I done been around the world, been around the block. Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac. Like Rita Guerrero, ass took her to the top. She'll give you some brains you let her throw up the Roc. Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cock. Picture that like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx. Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set. Puttin oil on her likes like she Gloria Velez. She was (Eye Candy) in the XXL. Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell. I knew she {""wouldn't get far""} cause five hundred dollars. can't get you that {""far""} how you get that {""far""}. And all these new video bitches tryin to be Melissa Ford. But they don't know Melissa Ford drive a Honda Accord. She a video vixen, but behind closed doors. She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards. Ha ha. [Chorus: The Game]. {""You wouldn't get far""} Fuckin them rap stars. You know who you are, put your hands up ladies. {""You wouldn't get far""} If you kept your legs closed. {""It would be best to wait your turn""} But you know. {""You wouldn't get far""} Fuckin them rap stars. You know who you are, I wrote this song for you. {""For you baby, I'd find you""} For you. And you, for alla y'all. [Kanye West]. For you... uhh... Pop quiz, how many topless, black foxes. did I have under my belt, like boxers. Not to brag but, if it add up. One, two, nigga that's mad nuts. Game you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these. bitches knowin damn well they gon' call me?. The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen. was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen. Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team. Head so good he don't ask for a pre.. nup. Now ask yourself this question, umm. Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O. Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo. Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo. Well why the hell you think these bitches comin at me fo'?. But since they all fall in my palm, I take a trio. Yo. [Chorus - sub ""mouth closed"" for ""legs closed""]. {""You wouldn't get far""} Fuckin them rap stars. You know who you are, put your hands up ladies. {""You wouldn't get far""} If you kept your legs closed. {""It would be best to wait your turn""} But you know. {""You wouldn't get far""} Fuckin them rap stars. You know who you are, I wrote this song for you. {""For you baby, I'd find you""} For you. And you, for alla y'all. [The Game]. I done had my share of bitches with long hair. Short doo like Kalissa, Halle in ""Boomerang"" yeah. I been around the block in the Bentley drop top. In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fuckin with Scott. I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case. She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes. And ain't nobody tryin to take Beyonce from Jay. But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day. The things niggaz do when pussy sittin on they face. Stabbed Un in the stomach. She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman, on that superhero shit. Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'. Impala, forget the double D's. I put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Takara. And she ain't win the show but she ridin in that Galata. That's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow. [Chorus]. {""You wouldn't get far""} Fuckin them rap stars. You know who you are, put your hands up ladies. {""You wouldn't get far""} If you kept your legs closed. {""It would be best to wait your turn""} But you know. {""You wouldn't get far""} Fuckin them rap stars. You know who you are, I wrote this song for you. {""For you baby, I'd find you""} For you. And you, for alla y'all. [The Game]. God damn! Y'knahmsayin?. I'm sittin back watchin Kanye video. And I see the same bitch that was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video. Then I flip the muh'fuckin channel. Checkin out my uncle Snoop Dogg video. And I see the same BITCH, that was in my video! Y'knowhatI'msayin?. And then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up. I'm watchin Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina. I see the same bitch on Oprah, floatin away on the hood of a Camry. That was in the nigga Lil Weezy video!. I mean DAMN! Everywhere I look. Everywhere I go I see the same hoes. Don't get mad, I'm only bein real. Yeah. by nbU."
