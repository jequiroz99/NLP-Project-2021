To accept my emotion. And hear my words fully, do not listen. I do not value your money. I value your acceptance and loyalty. Here is my pain. And thoughts put into words. I put my all into this,. In the hopes that it will help cure. Or at least numb your depression. I love you. Thank you for listening. Enjoy"

train food,"I remember I had walked home that day. Content with all my misery. Told my self it'd get better, no clue what there was next to me. Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance. I was dressed for winter weather. But the summer rays were kissing me, I. I was lost. So I took a different path. In the distance he awaited me. Had no weapon, I'm guessin' his hands were just enough for me. Was no question, I'm guessin'. he laughed just at the sight of me. I was lost.

I was dressed for winter weather. But the summer rays were kissing me, I. I was lost. And there he was, his presence was alarming. As he approached, was casual, we talk 'bout self-harming. He told me, ""Kid, you shouldn't be walkin' on your own"". He smiled and laughed, and pat my back. He asked, ""How far are you from home? "". I said, ""Maybe 30 minutes"". His frequency distorted quick, I seen it in his image. I should've run right fucking there, I. You ever woke up on a train track. With no motherfuckin' clothes on?. Death before your eyes, you prayin' to God. but ain't no response. Trying to scream for hope, just a shoulder. that you can lean on. But ain't nobody coming. So you scream on and scream on and scream on. While this evil fuck laugh at you. Train getting closer, you still surprised that he battered you. Tears falling harder and harder, minutes get minuscule. Could've had a son or a daughter, now what you finna do?. You finna die here on this train track. 'Cause clearly after death. ain't no way you can find your way back. Thinking 'bout your previous memories, going way back. All them fucking dreams 'bout a diamond chain. and a Maybach. Now your time finally up. Ask yourself the final question, is you going down or up?. Recollectin' all the moments that you never gave a fuck. Now it's here, death has now arrived, time's finally up"

vice city,"Hey there you, looking for brighter season. Need to lay your burden down. Hey there you, drowning in a helpless feeling. Buried under deeper ground. I seem depressed, always being bothered never less. Keeping me out of prison and putting me to the test. They ask me what is happiness, you write it on a cheque. Or you feel it on the sweat, when your dick is in the breast. Hey there you- When the lights go out and you're on your own. Hey there you- When the lights go out and you're on your own. If death is what it seems. Why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?. Fear of understanding, the Devils running his course. Pitchers not receivers, it's coming straight from the source. Remorse, as this time becomes a factor. Minds full of greed exposing your benefactors. Backwards, pace backwards. Everybody is superficial, only breaching the surface. Surface, upon the Earth. Flames engulf the Earth. And prized possession they incinerate. This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate. See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight. Perplexed, only receive slumber when that heaven gates. And this is fairly simple for your breath. Try and contemplate your conversates. Hesitating, navigation in the traits. Back to a time where minds were just matter. If you stated opinion then bones would begin to shatter. It didn't matter back then, cause there was no reacting, acting up. Chevy in black, accurate fact put the black in fact. If you thought that, you a bree, you should disregard that. All fact"

Tie it around his neck. and get to fucking buckling it up. For every moment I counted on him. I'm fucking him up. Torture victims are due to scriptures. it's written as such. So every moment. my uncle suffered was planned in the cut. Cut his tongue out. and hammered fucking nails in his skull. Couldn't see what Jesus planned, my vision is dull. And so. If there's a fucking god. I wanna slit his fucking throat. And feed his organs to the children. And, shower solutions to the black and the white. And, endless indulgence to the youth in the night.

He just replaced you. you are just a book on his shelf, and so. Who the fuck is God?. I said, who the fuck is God?. Is he a trap star or rockstar. Or the president. Doesn't leave many men. Innocent. See, living for a reason I don't know. Fuck shit hoe. Society is a parasite that darkens the soul. Keeping us ignorant and under control. Our heart's growing colder as the eagle takes over. Drugs numb the pain that I carry on my shoulder. Smoking all this weed hoping that God forgives me. While I stand and refuse to bow down to my knees. Bow down to my knees. Fuck that. Smoke that Dmt. You never seen the shit I seen. Pullin' up in beams smoke by the steam. Once had hood dreams all about the cream. Then you with the team, servin' up the fiends. Poppy and a spleen, don't fuck with it. Now let me take you back to the story. that I once told. Ayy, ayy, that I once told"
