always on time,"Artist: Ja Rule. Album: Always On Time 12"". Title: Always On Time (Remix). . feat. Ashanti, Jay-Z. (Ashanti) [Ja Rule talking]. Always there when you call [Buck-shots, haha]. Always on time. Gave you my....baby be mine. Always there when you call, always on time. Gave you my....baby. (Chorus - Ashanti). Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time. And I gave you my all, now baby be mine. I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time. And I gave you my all, now baby be mine. (Ja Rule). C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover. You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit). I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain. But baby you know the name and love is about pain. So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints. Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint. 'Cause I can't wait no more. 'Cause it's about a quarter-past three. And shorty's eyein me. I got the Bentley valeted. And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades. And I love to see that ass in hoops and shades. Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids. Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile. While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin you all wild. [With Ashanti]. But we share somethin so rare, but who cares, you care. (Chorus). (Jay-Z). Hov!. Big Pimpin'. Walk with a small limp. And I'm here to scoop you broads out your mid-sized cars. Bring hoes out of the closet. My dough gives chicks motive. He got enough money to afford it!. But one thing you could say about Jay. . It's not a day I ever bought it. Y'all can audit my life. I put on that on my unborn daughter's life. All I give 'em is game. I don't give 'em my name. Chicks leap through hula-hoops to get in the flame. All it takes is Cristal juice to get in they pants, man. Ain't nothin' gon' change 'bout Hov. But my socks, my draws, and my Roc-A-Wear clothes. And of course the flows. So pretty soon I'll be able to rap in Morse Code (beep beep, beep beep). Please believe me. But enough about Jay. My resume speaks for itself. Get your keys we leavin'. Hov!. (Chorus). Oh I'm, feelin' like you livin' a, double life. 'Cause you don't be comin' home, sometimes. Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin' for one time. You and I, got a special bond together. We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather. And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy. Then I'm gone. Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy. She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy. Remind these bitches to mind they business. Believe me, this pimp game is very religious. And I'm built like the Don Bishop. Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness. The life we share is a thug affair. [With Ashanti]. But who cares, you care. (Chorus). (Ashanti). Always there when you call, always on time. Gave you my....baby be mine. Always there when you call, always on time. Gave you my....baby be mine."

When you ain't here so I can't let you go. And they don't understand why I still be here while you be out, oh. I'm staring in the mirror saying ''damn, I really love him''. I just can't explain it, Picasso couldn't paint it. But these 3 words say all; I hate you. I hate you. I don't why it really hurts me. I'm still here and why do I love him through these tears?. Maybe cause we been together all these years. And maybe being alone in this, my one true fear. I know I can't change him so why am I complaining?. I know it sounds insane, but I'm still staying. Cause deep inside I love him and deep inside I hate him. And these 3 words say it all; I love you. I love, I hate, I love, I hate, I love, I hate, I love. I hate, I love I hate, I love, I hate, I love, I hate, I love you"
always on time,"Artist: Ja Rule. Album: Always On Time 12"". Title: Always On Time (Remix). . feat. Ashanti, Jay-Z. (Ashanti) [Ja Rule talking]. Always there when you call [Buck-shots, haha]. Always on time. Gave you my....baby be mine. Always there when you call, always on time. Gave you my....baby. (Chorus - Ashanti). Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time. And I gave you my all, now baby be mine. I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time. And I gave you my all, now baby be mine. (Ja Rule). C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover. You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit). I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain. But baby you know the name and love is about pain. So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints. Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint. 'Cause I can't wait no more. 'Cause it's about a quarter-past three. And shorty's eyein me. I got the Bentley valeted. And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades. And I love to see that ass in hoops and shades. Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids. Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile. While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin you all wild. [With Ashanti]. But we share somethin so rare, but who cares, you care. (Chorus). (Jay-Z). Hov!. Big Pimpin'. Walk with a small limp. And I'm here to scoop you broads out your mid-sized cars. Bring hoes out of the closet. My dough gives chicks motive. He got enough money to afford it!. But one thing you could say about Jay. . It's not a day I ever bought it. Y'all can audit my life. I put on that on my unborn daughter's life. All I give 'em is game. I don't give 'em my name. Chicks leap through hula-hoops to get in the flame. All it takes is Cristal juice to get in they pants, man. Ain't nothin' gon' change 'bout Hov. But my socks, my draws, and my Roc-A-Wear clothes. And of course the flows. So pretty soon I'll be able to rap in Morse Code (beep beep, beep beep). Please believe me. But enough about Jay. My resume speaks for itself. Get your keys we leavin'. Hov!. (Chorus). Oh I'm, feelin' like you livin' a, double life. 'Cause you don't be comin' home, sometimes. Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin' for one time. You and I, got a special bond together. We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather. And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy. Then I'm gone. Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy. She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy. Remind these bitches to mind they business. Believe me, this pimp game is very religious. And I'm built like the Don Bishop. Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness. The life we share is a thug affair. [With Ashanti]. But who cares, you care. (Chorus). (Ashanti). Always there when you call, always on time. Gave you my....baby be mine. Always there when you call, always on time. Gave you my....baby be mine."

Can't wait to hear those sleigh bells ringing. It's Christmas time again. Can't wait to hear those sleigh bells ringing. 2. Chestnuts roasting on an open fire. Jack Frost nipping at your nose. Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir. And folks dressed up like Eskimos. Everybody knows a turkey. And some mistletoe. Help to make the season bright. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow. Will find it hard to sleep tonight. They know that Santa's on his way. He's loaded lots of toys. And goodies on his sleigh. And every mother's child is gonna spy. To see if reindeer. Really know how to fly. And so I'm offering this simple phrase. To kids from one to ninety-two. Although it's been said. Many times, many ways. Merry Christmas to you. 3. Hey Santa can you bring me something good. (something good, something good). Hey Santa can you bring me something sweet. (something sweet, something, something sweet). Like chocolate kisses or candy canes. gumdrops, or butterscotch, fruity flavor, chewy rings. Hey Santa can you bring me something nice. (something nice, something nice). Hey Santa can you bring me something new. (something new, something, something new). Like a diamond bracelet or a diamond ring. How about a shiny new, baby blue, convertible. Hey santa can you bring me everything"

colors of the wind,"You think you own whatever land you land on. The earth is just a dead thing you can claim. But I know ev'ry rock and tree and creature. Has a life, has a spirit, has a name. You think the only people who are people. Are the people who look and think like you. But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger. You'll learn things you never knew you never knew. Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon. Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grins?. Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?. Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?. Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?. Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest. Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth. Come roll in all the riches all around you. And for once, never wonder what they're worth. The rainstorm and the river are my brothers. The heron and the otter are my friends. And we are all connected to each other. In a circle, of a hoop that never ends. Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon. Or let the eagle tell you where he's been. Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?. Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?. Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?. How high does the sycamore grow?. If you cut it down, then you'll never know. And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon. For whether we are white or copper-skinned. We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain. We need to paint with all the colors of the wind. You can own the earth and still. All you'll own is earth until. You can paint with all colors of the wind.."

And you aint flattered by canary envy es dipped Jesus'. Other ballers look dumb when they press you, 5 and 6's. You don't let them kinda numbers impress you. Even though I was somewhat successfull. Bein a player was becoming too stressfull. But every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue. My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special. Let's fly to St. Bart, while the villa be painted. Just so we can get really aquainted. The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted. But I can't really explain it, uh, yeah.

rip,"Your hands should be covered in blood. By the way you ripped up my heart. It feels like I swallowed a blade. Every time I say, every time I say. Not an email, not a text, no phone. Nothing left, just me sitting in this bed alone. That's how we started unraveling. Boy, you stripped me to the bones. Something so small as. Picking up the phone may seem so small to you. [?]. Don't hear two words from you. Everything that's going through my head. Where he at, where he been, who he with. Why he ain't hit me yet. And then I start to mimic this, what's next?. Is he having sex? Is he using latex?. And is he gonna bring something home to me?. Why he giving these bitches the privilege of something to say?. I put on my black dress, I put on my black heels. I got two dozen roses in my arms. I got on my black shades to hide all of my tears. I gotta say goodbye to this love gone wrong. I think it's best that we lay this thing to rest. I think it's best that we lay this thing to rest. I think it's best that we lay this thing to rest. I think it's best, I think it's best. Not even karma is enough to get you back for what you did. It's like your love is poisoned and you've infected me. It's running up through my veins, affecting my every day. I wish I had the power to erase your face from my brain. Something so small as. Picking up the phone may seem so small to you. [?]. Don't hear two words from you. Everything that's going through my head. Where he at, where he been, who he with. Why he ain't hit me yet. And then I start mimic this, what's next?. Is he having sex? Is he using latex?. And is he gonna bring something home to me. Why he giving these bitches the privilege of something to say?.

I think it's best that we lay this thing to rest. I think it's best that we lay this thing to rest. I think it's best that we lay this thing to rest. I think it's best, I think it's best. You promised me forever. You said we'd be together. You would never turn your back on us. Now I wanna thank you. For forcing me to get through this. Didn't recognize my very own strength. Now I'mma stick out my chest and I'mma throw my head back. And I'mma put a smile on my face. I put on my black dress, I put on my black heels. I got two dozen roses in my arms. I got on my black shades to hide all of my tears. I gotta say goodbye to this love gone wrong. It's time to lower this in the ground. I'm gonna cover it up and put my head down. I'm gonna say my very last goodbye. I'm gonna wipe these tears for the very last time"

scars,"Yeah, He's a walkin' (walkin'). Talkin' (talkin'). Livin' regret. I wish I never met him. Never slept wit him. Never involved myself. If I would have known better. I would never stayed together witchyu. He wrong so I'm gone and I ain't comin' back. Wish I could be vindictive 'cause I wanna hurt him back. He wrong so I'm gone and I ain't comin' back. Wish I could inflict something 'cause I wanna hurt him back. And I'mma make sure I'm drop-dead gorgeous every time he see me. So he want it more, more. And I'mma make sure everything is successful let him know he. Fucked around and left the best he had. He stuck in his ego. He lost when let me go. I was arguably the best thing that happened to him. He know. What I gave he can't find. There ain't nothin' like mine. Thought my e and you was just us. I guess you couldn't man up. So I'm gone. I gave you everything. All of me. All my heart. Now I'm leaving with scars. With scars [x3]. You could have kept the pain. My heart is slain. Nothin' remains, no more. But scars [x4]. Now I can barely make a standing. Here lookin' in your face. Your Such a disgrace. To who we were and what we had. Thought we was on it like Usher. And both had it bad. Everything I thought that you stood for, I'm takin' all back. He wrong so I'm gone. And I ain't comin' back. So tired tryna figure out why this just didn't last. He wrong so I'm gone. And I ain't comin' back. My heart is hurtin' but my mind is sayin' leave his ass. And I'mma make sure I'm drop-dead gorgeous every time he see me. So he want it more, more. And I'mma make sure everything is successful let him know he. Fucked around and left the best he had. He stuck in his ego. He lost when he let me go. I was arguably the best thing that happened to him. He know. What I gave he can't find. There ain't nothin' like mine. Thought me and you was just us. I guess you couldn't man up. So I'm gone. I gave you everything (everything). All of me (all of me). All my heart. Now I'm leaving with scars. With scars [x4]. You could have kept the pain. My heart is slain. Nothin' remains, no. More but scars [x4]. Thought we was gonna build. Thought what we had was real. Thought me and you was gonna have a house in the hills. Maybe three or four kids. Bently's and drop Benz's. We was spos'd to ride out and be best friends. But no it all came to an end (Came to an end). 'Cause I refuse to go through the same shit again. Ain't no more questionin'. Ain't no more arguin'. Ain't no more cryin', lyin'. Tryn' to put up wit him. I gave you everything. All of me. All my heart. Now I'm leaving with scars. With scars [x2]. I'm leavin' [x3]. You could have kept the pain. My heart is slain. Nothin' remains, no. More but scars [x4]. Ugh. We all go through it. So, everyone always wants to know. Like what goes on personally in my life and where I get all my inspiration. I mean, I've gone through a lot, you know'. People that I loved betrayed me and, and I never saw it comin'. It was crazy and it's like, it leaves a lil' scar. You know what I mean' But these scars are like little. Reminders that you got through it and not to look back. (Scars). It's like a double entendre I guess. 'Cause you're leavin', you're scarred. But you're also healed and you don't have to worry about bleeding anymore. You know, a scar, it's like it symbolizes healing. So, it's good that you got the scars and you leave 'cause you healed up. I'm leaving with scars. I'm leaving with scars. I'm leaving with scars. I'm leaving with scars. Said I'm stronger, Yeah"

the christmas song,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire. Jack Frost nipping at your nose. Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir. And folks dressed up like Eskimos.. Everybody knows a turkey. And some mistletoe. Help to make the season bright. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow. Will find it hard to sleep tonight.. They know that Santa's on his way. He's loaded lots of toys. And goodies on his sleigh. And every mother's child is gonna spy. To see if reindeer. really know how to fly.. And so I'm offering this simple phrase. To kids from one to ninety-two. Although it's been said. many times, many ways. Merry Christmas to you.. And so I'm offering this simple phrase. To kids from one to ninety-two. Although it's been said. many times, many ways.

time of year,Christmas is the time of year. That we become as one. Tears of joy. Heart filled with love. Cause Christmas time has begun. There is nowhere else I would rather be. My family's here with me. Even though some of them are watching from above. I feel their love for me. Christmas is the time of year. You give your very last. Just to see that smiling face on someone that you love. And there is nowhere else I would rather be. My family's here with me. Even though some of them are watching from above.

I think you stole my heart from me, I don't want to be wrong cause I like it. Cause I belong to somebody even though it seems wrong I can't fight it. It almost feels as if I'm not myself, I'm nervous bound from someone else.

Because I never felt like this, I don't want to be wrong cause I like it thinking about the way you kiss, I don't want to be wrong cause I like it. Got me thinking I should leave, I don't want to be wrong cause I like it.. But I belong to somebody even though it seems wrong I can't fight it I know that I already have a love, he's all I know and all I trust but lately I've been falling out of love. I find myself so deep in love and every time he's here with me I look into his eyes so desperately but it's not his face I see, tell me what comes over me.

He'll say: Are you married?. We'll say: No man,. But you can do the job. When you're in town.. Later on, we'll conspire,. As we dream by the fire. To face unafraid,. The plans that we've made,. Walking in a winter wonderland.. In the meadow we can build a snowman,. And pretend that he's Parson Brown. He'll say: Are you married?. We'll say: No man,. But you can do the job. When you're in town.. Later on, we'll conspire,. As we dream by the fire. To face unafraid,. The plans that we've made,. Walking in a winter wonderland.. Walking in a winter wonderland,. walking in a winter wonderland.."

you're gonna miss,"It's killin' me to think. that you don't want it no more. I shoulda learned my lesson. when you fucked before. You said something, I said something. seems like this thing is over. Cuz you ain't called since you been gone. But I ain't gonna stress about it anymore. And I ain't gonna cry another night no. You gonna miss this chick right here. You gonna miss this chick I swear. I hate to admit it my heart was all in it. Like a fatal attraction happened. cuz now it's killin' me. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't breathe. I just want you back with me baby. I can't help but think that we were always wrong. Although I find it hard to keep myself from holding on. And when I try to justify what you did wrong. It's like I'm constantly reminded that I can't move on. But I ain't gonna stress about it anymore. And I ain't gonna cry another night no. You gonna miss this chick right here. You gonna miss this chick I swear. I'm tired of faking that we could have made it. My heart keeps on aching and I just can't take it. Hey! I feel so weak (I can't breathe). I just want you back wit me baby. I can't help but think that we were always wrong. Although I find it hard to keep myself from holding on. And when I try to justify what you did wrong. It's like I'm constantly reminded that I can't move on. Oh!. But I ain't gonna stress about it anymore. And I ain't gonna cry another night no. You gonna miss this chick right here. You gonna miss this chick I swear. Said ain't nobodys out there like mine. You went and (Uhh) for the very last time. You gonna miss this chick right here. You gonna miss this chick I swear.
