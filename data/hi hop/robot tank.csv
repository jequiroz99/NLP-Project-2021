america,"[Warcloud:]. The maid was in the garden, hangin' out the clothes. While I crept up and shot her dead in the nose. Message in a bottle, violent as our records spin. One stranded couple terrorized by backwoods men. A young man home from reform school, now a burglar. Since sixth graders suspect their principal is a murderer. A man investigates the death of his twin brother. Three kids search for their missin' parents and cover. A nightclub owner, schemes against mobsters. Four congressmen turn out to be impostors. Five teens try to track down the jewel thief. One little boy, knocked out another's teeth. Successful script writer becomes a heroin addict. A surgeon and his ex-wife slaughtered by a mechanic. A barroom boss and they lost, threw it to the hospital. A little girl found a fly inside a popsicle. Two bored Indians become bank robbers. A cop searchin' for the killers of his father. A rapper's lifestyle of sex, drugs and booze. A highway man, swindles a drunker's booth. A homeless in a dumpster, and finds a new pair of shoes. An injured jazz musician, dead on the news. A housewife entangled in lies and domestic abuse. A dirty politician tries to rub out his opponents. The outside man fought another man in the rain. A business woman had to smooth for the correct spelling of her name. A skinhead who lead a fierce biker gang. Involved in white slavery and Mr. Avery was never neighborly, romancin', a jackpot. He killed his wife and drove to Vegas wit her head in a hat box. [Chorus x4: Warcloud]. One candy apple, two white chocolates, three blueberries. [Warcloud:]. She had rings on her fingers and bells on her toes. She would have music wherever she goes. Seven ladybugs on a honeydew, for crummy you. Mystic rhymes straight from candy house wit a gummy roof. I got a Tommy gun that shoots eggs, and I'll put it down. Pop you on the shoulder wit a large revolver and laugh. Warcloud's warpath is a conquer that ever last. Like tea cakes and crumpets, shiny, right turk gold trumpets. Gold's in the compass, pilotin' and airship. One sea of clouds, they drop an axe on you now. Shadow on the barn wall, float a newspaper boat. Juice bars and fudge sticks, roller coasters and ferris wheels. [Chorus x4]. [Warcloud:]. There was a young lady, my wife, who disrespect. And the first day I met her she had a ribbon around her neck. And she wore that ribbon for years and hear the flutes. When I asked her to remove it, she'd always have excuse. One stormy night, while we were in bed. I snatched the ribbon off and off rolled her head. I laughed my self to sleep, the room spun around like a record. [Chorus x4]"
channel warcloud,"[Intro: Warcloud]. Speed takes lights, and them have enemies. Enemy back in the days, buryin' a fish in the house. Plant, buryin' a fish in the house, plant, yo. It's Channel Warcloud, Channel Warcloud, Channel Warcloud. It's Channel Warcloud, Channel Warcloud, Channel Warcloud. Clack-clack-capow. [Chorus: Warcloud]. Do not attempt to adjust ya radio. It's Channel Warcloud, muthafucka, I'm on now. Violent and disturbin' images, it's groovy. Like an old movie, stay fly like rough schools. [Warcloud:]. The ghost of the bloody red Baron. Known for shootin' down planes in the sky over the west. I still terrorize the skies, cuz I'm the best. And Wu-Tang Clan will lay you all to rest. Drunk off the dastardly alcohol. And happily bring forth tragedy to academy. We juggle steamrollers, cannons built on a skyscraper. Mad voices, subject Warcloud, had a fly caper. Guns too big, granola truck and a gas masl. Chitty-chitty, bang-bang, better duck when my gats blast. Stack cash, rumble and crumble civilization. Battle when my battle sound drown you in shark water. Darts came to slaughter wit horror, you couldn't grab them. They don't have to pay for the deaths of any mad men. Warcloud, pay the Eolithic sterling revolvers. A frame work of uprights and cross pieces, the horror. Burst like radiance, war prophet like Gideon. Holy war gospel, ramble knife in tonsils. Ya live but ghost bloody and hostile, crack the tonsil. So let ya light apostle hit a body in my garage though. He's too swift, he's too nice like Christ. Who sent you on a mission back to the Arabian nights. Pop you wit my pistol, discipline was the doctrine. Drop tractors on you like oxygen in my moccasins. Hang you from a fixture, slaughter in the mixture. Shit chilly on ya dog snapper picture, lunatic minister. Raps crack sinister, throw ya head in the shredder. Cyber crime letters, still stackin' my bloody cheddar. Welcome to the funk house, pinball, you age. While I gun rappers down in arcades, crumble the page. [Chorus x2]. [Warcloud:]. I put full cans of pop in a pillowcase wit my roller-skates. And knock the champs teeth down over to the next street. Crook neck, croon playin' croquet wit the crooked. Move 'cross country wit a crucifix and a crossword. Cookie crossbones in my license plate, never lost this. I bust open ya head and sow it up wit a cross-stitch. Left M.C.'s cross-eyed, make a right at the cross street. Just pass the crossroads, tuckin' a lot of cops heat. A crow landed on the crossbow, I'm cross paths. Stone steps red, sit cross-legged, the moth's back. Crummy crybabies, I'm crusaidin' wit cuckoo. My curriculum is consisted of crystals, you crustacean. And crumble like a cornbread, makin' ya listen glue. Rhyme gladiator, the miraculous Mr. Wu. [Chorus x2]. [Warcloud:]. Channel Warcloud, live for the dart of all, it's archival. Knock off, guns pop off, you keep the heart to brawl. Shark 'em all, cards and pool, I'll loan you lumps son. Cheap spin lyrics that's drunk runt, we bump hunt. Diamonds in the spine of yours, you're livin' wit dinosaurs. Slash a chump ass punk fag and watch his neck burst. Bank heist in Paris, muthafucka, cuz my cassette curse. Vulture raps set hearse, Dodgers make the playoffs. Don't champ layoff, machines just might spray off. Warcloud bats like Babe Ruth, the errors. Catch like Yogi Berra, you doubt she Sister Shera. Better bring ya torches, green hummingbirds, black organs. Spiral velvet chain, I ferociously metamorphosis. Scrape the skull layers like cancer rights and fool you. Jagged bone do you, I'm cruel, the pain sooth you. Catch her by the smooth hounds, cool sounds, he's ale. Can't by the tails, it's pale fangs wit scales. Mermaids and belly dancers, neck romancers. We stalk like three headed panthers through the caverns. Wit all littered laterns, roarin' and carvin' patterns. Encountered by Gods, like Saturn, we leave 'em splattered. Heartless spark, caught the dark market, Venus vacation. We march into our father's spaceship, lookin' like cavemen. Luxury and ancient, ice planets and mammoths. Leave the world damaged, vanish and keep you stranded. Snow White dragon lives under a thirty mile sandpit. You saw me in Los Angeles, hunchback and bandages. Rhymin' biohazardous, heavy guns and scandalous. Fabulousy murderin' you cancerous ignoramuses. Sloth teach ya vessel, Warcloud's an intellectual. Transmutin' through ya jet, and swoop off into the celestial. [Chorus x2]. [Outro: Warcloud]. Stay fly like rough schools. Stay fly like rough schools"
falling hammer,"[Intro: Warcloud]. Warcloud, West-Coast Wu-Tang Clan. Dirty hammer drop, the dirty hammer drop. [Chorus x2: Warcloud]. Dirty hammer drop, door knocker, funeral rose. Cross-cut saw, play dead, the bone breaker. Tooth-fairy sleeper hold, dark greeting stay gun-wise. Wolf bite, falling tree, old tequila sunrise. [Warcloud:]. Welcome to the bunk house, jewelry in the sound. I'm laying on the roof with no skin from the top down. Watching old Mickey Mouse cartoons, I'm grim. There's a broad with a cocktail dress inside my pen. I'm William Make's body, the look of John Merrick. I play Alison who turned to back Eric. Dwelling in the pueblo, setting my dirty guns down. Look out for the cat in the box, we go to fun town. Poets better shush or get mushed, my gun blaow you. Dazzling diamonds, sparkling values. Will favorite value, punch you until you splatter. Jump up and punch a hole in the moon, watch it shatter. Be he live or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make bread. [Chorus]"
fever dream,"[Chorus x2: Warcloud]. You're stuck on a ship in a bottle, quite unique. You live inside my painting and move once a week. I switched the art around, my friends are gettin' suspicious. I switched the art around, my friends are gettin' suspicious. [Warcloud:]. The ballot of Mr. Edward Hyde, crook as Scrooge. Hooligans and scallywags, crickets and ice cubes. Shiny red tricycle, a rhinoceros skull. Old captain flag, standin' in the hole. M.C.'s is dull, phantom in the steam. Brought the engine clean, world ain't what it seems. Slinky falls down the stairs, can't forget that. Chase you wit a pink axe, bullets, you get gift wrapped. Mud crew over the house, hot moistures. Found a black wallet in a bucket of blue oysters. I'm in the air like the ozone, bubble gum snow cones. Raccoon in the yard, layin' wit drug bones. That's how I roll palms, Godsy wit the drug lord. Off wit the soldier's daughter, swallow the love nun. It's no jive, Warcloud has arrived. The reflection of guns in his eyes, we all lie. And this is Wu-Tang, cargo wit my hook hand. L.A. story, flip a nickel, the book stand. It's full of crooks and dry host to sells. Say giants swift bitin' a whale in the hail. [Chorus x2]. [Warcloud:]. Pistol in your face, skeletons in the wires. We move like new vampires, meet your desire. Walk wit a monkey wrench, body inside the lake. We swung off cake like slugs and earthquake. Mics in decay, my rhyme is violent, goofy. I laugh like he threw money bags in a silent movie. Seven stone cozy, vodka in the jukebox. One heavy pistol came from the nut house. Pineapple soda pop, knock you off porches. Village swift portrait, thrown to death on your horses. Mean Warcloud, break you into powder. Who put the poison in Mr. Sledge's chowder?. A weasel fell out of his hide, death was holdin' ya'll. Who group the crew? A roaster in a bowling ball. Gun you down on the street, bullets that hit you through trucks, don't even argue. So stuck up that niggas just might rob you. I laid in bed next to her black cat. Warcloud, Warcloud, Warcloud.... [Chorus x2]. [Warcloud:]. Aiyo, thanks for go pumpin' tonight, my rap embargo. Is like cotton dolls, bird feathers and marbles. Diamonds and sea shells, sown the size of cartwheels. Throwin' large portraits of Maharaja you walk. Suzy got shot in the sternum, watch the spear. Stab you wit a 12 inch knife, behind the ear. Then leave the scene in slow motion, one red. Sasquatch, Yeti, battalion wit one head. Stash of cloth, bits of paper, pieces of string. Mighty long carrots in the spring. Recite on the new brick stones, steel and concrete. The weakest of gun fights like the last days of Long Beach. A jewel don't match, a helmet full of gold dust. You got, people blast me wit rose. Flied out bones, they scatter and grow wit molds. The honest man, is the cookie man and his clothes. Lay bitches splat in a circle around the war hawk. Stir fried vegetables, marshmallow's cloakin' it. Crops meant to hurt you, eight sugars, snap peas. While I crept up on the ribs to buy a deed. Wack, wack, wack, wit arrows I came to waste y'all. Now you look cheap, my cry rattles the great wall. A dirty old baseball rolled in Polly-O, aiyo.... [Chorus x2]"
ghost pirates (old los angeles),"(feat. Skarekrow). [Intro: Warcloud]. You find ya self devoured by woodland creatures. Lightin' matches under my hat, ghost pirates. Frosty mug of rum. [Warcloud:]. Old Los Angeles, heroin epidemics. I bust slugs, they love to figure skate through me. We had a merry war, turn M.C.'s to cannon boys. I carved Wu-Tang in the tie, you heard the stabbin' noise. Raw head breaks, snake eater of dungeon. A web of dead bodies in the sewer, underground London. Passion in the desert, my guns'll love backwards. Just around the royal staircase, he runs laughter. Just around the royal staircase, he runs laughter. My forearm is made out of rifles that bust factor. And pop might murder the woman in the here after. I laugh cuz I'm a pirate, shot you twice in the abdomen. Then opened up the back of his head, like a cabinet. The blood sprained into my face. And ran down my revolver like the gaze of the next victim I slaughtered. Caught within a second, he wandered down the tunnel. Feel the ghost of a little boy rammed by, at the end. I squeeze a trigger violent, Warcloud the tyrant. All wet wit blood, on Godly assignment. Slap a whipper snapper, ya's better mount up and slither. I smack you like a bear, watch a salmon out of a river. [Chorus x2: Warcloud]. Roll him up in the carpet, carry him up the staircase. Ghost Pirates, Old Los Angeles, and we're fabulous. Rhyme biohazardous, shot him twice in the abdomen. Then opened up the back of his head, like a cabinet. [Skarekrow:]. My liquids drip through ya storm drains, stained window sills. Black feathered birds gathered in the back of the cornfield. Stuck like a quicksand on rich land. While apostle tried to translate the novels in the palm of my hand. I break training wheels and kick stands. Produced clones of myself in one hair strand. Live in stereo, perform miracles at ya burial. One shot from a crust roll is enough to scare ya sterile. Mars apply, blank at ya eyes in the skies. While I'm on the low, tip towin' through the shadows. Settin' the stage for my entrance. When I hit the street, smoke leavin' me like incense. Intense events, shiny instruments. Got you duckin' my buckin', my introduction is deep moans and groans. Screamin' bone collector, soul resurrector. Bloody whore show records, swoop down and take ya man's hands like checkers. Ya all left beheaded by the dreaded Skarekrow. Fiery war chants givin' oak branch elbows. Stone bones staircase, my home and air base. You misplaced, now which way do you go?. Yo, I jump and bite ya Adam's apple. The air hits thirty three below. You trapped wit the iceman made of hot snow. Old clothes, innocent blood, throw in a cemetery club. [Chorus x2]. [Warcloud:]. Trees, whose fruits wither it, without fruit, that art's twice dead. The sleepy old man, who dips his head. He said ""I have a bat in my belt for ya and a baseball in my bed"". A skeleton, loadin' revolver in a snowstorm. Vampire walk in the studio in my ghost form. Feet in the mud, my slugs are like thugs. That get all up in you at twilight, like street serpents. Gape into the future, wit black markets, ya organs. Hand the project kid some loot and a pair of Jordans. Block head niggas, my pawn, ya'll get a hold of that. In the red rams, red boulders, watch the ogre's hat. The long shadow, hard rain in America. Cantaloupes fall out of ya back from cannon raps. You leave the scene bloody, I'm haywire and nutty. Warcloud, who bit off them bees and got muddy. Now I lounge on the track wit the Skarekrow. Get knuckle sandwich delicacy, and it's real, as the hallway. Gats sunk to me, let's murder some more web heads. An old jagged fence where ya hang ya clothes to dry. [Skarekrow:]. Thank God, we bust, blow clutch, put big green in unnamed trust. Miscellaneous, my code name alias. Word archery, armory, perform tracks surgery. Givin' you brain strains and lower back pains. When you talk, I cover ya tongue like fat daddy shoe strings. Blow ya game in the grain wit stainless styles. Black Angus, stoned off by igneous, enemy lust. Left them all in the dust, now must. You keep playin' ya self, and claim you payin' dues. You the type, go head, rush out, and tell old news. Wouldn't know the delphonics if I left you clues. Tangled and strangled in the game of 'snap fool'. I seen more life in a statue, uh. And the truth hurts like body piercings and tattoo. My mental strength is chemically natural, physically impossible. To be recreated, upgraded and duplicated, formats fat and saturated. You must have heard too many shots when the ghost pirates raided. [Chorus x2]. [Outro: Warcloud]. Immortal battalion wit pirates ship and a ghost crew. Explosives twisted in my being"
in the hall of the warrior king,"[Intro: Warcloud]. Yo, what's the deal champs?. Muthafuckas, this is Warcloud. West Coast Wu-Tang Killa Beez, representin' for the underground. For the main spade style is architect tile. Bionic, it's like we done unfinished cathedrals. Item number productions, it's gon' be repercussions. Smack niggas faces. [Chorus x4: Warcloud]. War, War, Warcloud. [Warcloud:]. Aiyo, you get strangled in burgundy velvet ropes. Stained wooden floorboards, sleepin' on the ceiling I murder warlords. Fever dreams, sling bean, gun, lead blow. The jury let me walk, I laughed and spat at patrol. And crushed ya dirty smiles while I was eatin' tiles. And farted out twenty beach balls, bounced down the aisle. The vibes of great film, though my cane is stuffed in the wastebasket. Pop a cucci, sizin' them tits, so they can taste magic. Casket face miraculous, murder you while I'm kneelin'. Where's Warcloud? I heard he sleeps on the ceiling. You move like snails, arsenic and old lakes. House of Frankenstein, slow hand lays down the cold ace. Murder you on 7th Street, merciless Jack Frost. Left bit, cast on, while playin' wit Adam's rib. Still ride a Harley through cop-land, wit Digit. I howl, and shatter the moon, send you a postcard. Chicky-chicky, boom-boom, now they call you broken face. Heard your rib cage healed up and I hope it breaks. Open case, glance two times, while others glare. A ghost wrapped in bandages laughed his way up the stairs. [Chorus x4]. [Warcloud:]. You'll find stepping stones along the way, through the streams. Run silent, run deep, you're now surrounded by misfits. Twelve angry men like angels wit dirty faces. Armed to the truth, you couldn't move many paces. Blood hits snow and hearts, scoop it up in handfuls. Then I walked the green grasslands, smoked the Indo. Passed that house wit the woman always in the window. I'm at the helm, you've now entered harsh realm. Big spore zone, severous poisonous herbs. They're are water spiders that eat lizards and birds. While bloody red icicles hang from every word. Ears full of nails, you stagger off of the curb. And fall in the street, avocados and fortune cookies. Ginger snaps and finger-paint, ammunition for hand guns. Go away and stay there, man wit twisted beard. He fell through a hole in the ice and disappeared. I ride a bicycle, and bite an apple. Alamo Bay, bloody old man from L.A.. [Chorus x4]. [Warcloud:]. Heat bringer of war, white feathers wit red tips. Gun powder keg, called American Beach. Vocal antiques, in the hall of the mountain king. Hansel & Gretel, threw rats down from the balcony. I horseradish you're brain, raise your Alchemy Elite's. Eight hundred muthafuckas wit bats who never speak. In the misty street, Warcloud came in your nose. A killa bee sat on the rose, unfold the scrolls like. Five zombie soldiers playin' cards at an outpost. Laughin' at midnight, weapons against the wall. Tall red, white, blue werewolf, palace in India. Jewel like the sky laugh at Fourth of July. Sleepwalker talk, that's one eye under water. Archibald Leach, escape wit the preacher's daughter. Terror on the high seas, gun brought you guzzle. Get regular dart books, skull snakes and puzzles. Raps overlap, clap tracks and gap wax. Like gat hacks, tennis balls lacks to use fat. Bear trap pack and splat a guy's back, I'm anthrax. Violent Jack's rap will tap from the pitch black. And smear you on the wall like taff and watch you gasp. If you bust me back I murder you wit a flock of bats. Snap a six-pack, pass the tack and make mine laugh. And clap you wit the mack off the rack, you get jacked. Yack bags of that, America muscle rap. We ran for the grams, sweet pinball and hammerheads. Alcatraz flash, cold bear, crooked. Fever dreams tooken, Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde. [Chorus x4]. [Outro: Warcloud]. This pirate is called Warcloud, I think. He likes to drink, he likes to wink. He likes to drink and drink and drink. The thing he likes, to drink is ink. The ink he likes to drink is pink. He likes to wink and drink pink ink. He bosses his gong, all day and night. From right to left, and left to right. Warcloud out of the savage L.A. streets, muthafuckas. Pistol pop your head, you'll never catch me Sleepy Horse. Pistol pop your head, you'll never catch me Sleepy Horse"
island of dr. warcloud,"[Intro: Warcloud]. You have now entered harsh realm. Island of Dr. Warcloud, Wu-Tang. Jiggy, jiggy, boom, boom, magena, magena, la, la. [Warcloud:]. Welcome to my window the recipe for ice. a one room school where I murdered off poets twice. I brought two kegs one of beer and one of gun powder. red splattered count their organs I call it fun chowder. crank the music louder, miraculous how it rocks. I throw the whole crowd in a big three lock box. I'm smelling like a convertible man, I'm Micheal Myers what. crash into the gully and neck, I'll steal a firetruck. red twighlight, a vampire grin clever. The city on the edge of forever, his hand was severed. The antique shop is where I found a whale hook. He had a book on his book was how to cook. At my house we play out back, thats how I shattered shields. At my house we play out back, the dirty battlefield. This is the one thousandth raid of the ice pirate. A cloud of bats, war axes and maps, the skeletons. threw down heavy stones when you encoutered them. Up in the mountain, shotguns and acid fountain. and white dragons return from a hunt, but thats not all. The dusty footprints led up to a solid wall. [Chorus x2: Warcloud]. Island of Dr.Warcloud, journey, journey. Journey to spirit, Island, voyage, voyage. In the riddles of a time looking swell. In the riddles of a time looking swell. [Warcloud:]. In thru the outdoor, up the down staircase. Wooden wood cutters, a pyramid made of pearl. You were left scolded where the ground became open. and the sky broke thunder that later shattered the world. Fear in the dark they hid deep in the silver weed. I crossed the upper-bridge, the lower-bridge was burning. I capture MC's like pollywogs, for real. A hunchback stood in the wind at the foot of the hill. The house reaks of death and dripping blood. the stench is like a breath from the tomb. Dirty monsoons, magena, magena, la, la. I stroll on emerald beach with black guns. Goo, goo, ga, ga. the queen once led us to prince, iron wires. Warcloud feathers, the war of the vampires. The chief rabbits depature, the crow and the beanfields. Slaughter rappers sloppily, starwars monopoly. Leave you all curled like dirty rash girl. eyes bugged out like red and white swirl. We use to chase yall niggas, no sleeves. We only thieves if thieves champagne in the breeze. believe Warcloud is sip a Coors now. Ghost children jumped on the bed three doors down. [Chorus]. [Warcloud:]. You still cant hit a curve ball. We play baseball at midnight drunk as fuck (HAHA). Chicks in the bleachers, missle launcher in the truck. your ryhme style is sorry, the hypnotist Calagari. they roam the sky blue grasslands to shimmer narly. Theres black tigers with white stripes. I saw a taylors patch, might just mail her that. Seagull took a sailors hat. Glass eye piece, Geppetto, strombolli. Pirhanna face rappers, they call him Mar Mr. Sheephead. broken face losers I'll knock a hole in you fence mouth. Now they call you ragged tooth. slaughtered when my tents out, Uncle golf haven. my rhyme came in a fever dream. Only one survivor, you told your story to children. A mountain made of lugnuts. battlefield in the rugged lands, mixed forest. on harsh realm, diamond nugget hands. Cap the prospector, mosquito inside the bookstore. El Capitan, in deep, was how the hooks tore. elbows shoulders and knuckles, I never go back. I never flatter, I never reflect. [Chorus x2]. [Outro: Warcloud]. Bats fly in the rain. Jiggy, jiggy, boom, boom, magena, magena, la, la. Welcome to Warclouds pycho,cybernetic. Pychotropocist Island. come again. Jiggy,,jiggy, boom, boom, magena, magena, la, la. Jiggy,,jiggy, boom, boom, magena, magena, la, la"
mad axes,"[Intro: Warcloud]. Mad axes.... Silver ants and golden beetles, crawlin' throughout my paragraphs. Chief Warcloud, to peel a lemon and share a drag. Wu-Tang Clan, West Coast, so carry torch. Throwin' mad axes, bad apples at dead whores. Throwin' mad axes, bad apples at dead whores. [Chorus x2: Warcloud]. Throwin' mad axes, heavy sawed-off shotty. Old liquid foot, powder foot, chopped up the body. Great Warcloud, who cracked you mighty hard. I watch the children chasin' chickens off in the yard. [Warcloud:]. I crash through the door and motor head through the window. Wit a heavy pistol, Warcloud the Champion. Victory born freedom, the universe can't defeat him. Crash you wit the sea grams, ooh-yah. Chop ya head in half wit the heavy old sword from Old Asia. Sick man amaze ya, dark castle fantasia. Shot you in the early life, throw your arms in the garbage bin. Records will retard the spin, lay my gats on wax. Slit your belly open and stash a hammer in the back. Warcloud don't play Sleepy Horse, clack clack. Slumped on a horse wit a creepy torch and black gats. If one cannot speak wisdom, about his or her culture. Therefore, they cannot deal equality. Barbaric policies, slaughter you in the odyssey. Crack you like a Polly seed, make your organs come out of thee. Shot 'em barefoot in the dark, you was a tyrant. Fiasco pop violent, I smoke jump like a giant. And escape the deep end, my deadly maze of clues. We smoke muthafuckas like Army and Navy news. A hall full of dinosaurs heads, hear the best tune. You were mangled by a mad man inside a wet room. Cut you at the knee wit the shotgun, it's hurtful. You slight blind fish that swim in lazy circles. Gun 'em so swiftly, fired my Smith & Wesson. He tried to escape, but stepped on his own intestine. Throw you in the shredder for pleasure and live to tell. Old war ghost, they cannonball in they well. [Chorus x2]. [Warcloud:]. Sunburst, shotgun, drop son, and scotch run. Down and dirty staircase, clatter like when the cops come. Warcloud, you punk crews, never started. It's like someone took human skins and filled them wit garbage. You'll find your ass back in the dumpster from heavy gats. Baptism of blood, I leave you wit flies and gnats. I stalk wit a sawed-off shotgun and an axe. All wrapped in bandages, coat was long and black. Spark it in the darkness, we rich men and hunchback. Shovel through the portal wit cyber gats for askin'. School of assassins, stashin' your body fragments. Just behind eight big crates we drunk laughin'. Heavy swords, axes and hammers are my brigade. I cut you men down wit the gauge and flip the page. Stumble off the ripple, cuz everyday is New Year's. Sick like the green coyote, I drink a few beers. Lift that brick, grab that gat, painting's in a stack. I bump you and slump you on every track. It's that Warcloud rap, we desperate desperados. Machine junky crunchy wit shots to pop the lotto. Swiggin' dusty bottles, the strongest you sing the longest. Throw you in the hells of hells from markin' zombies. Rap creature land, beware mechanical animals. Warcloud stretchin' in daisies, wit revolvers. Drunk like thieves, take it just like the breeze. Now look at all the clowns there, sleeping up in the trees. [Chorus x2]. [Warcloud:]. It's way past your curfew, I came here to unearth you. Heavy old sword from Jerusalem, splatter juice from them. Red bangle, that's murder stupid men, peep my future pen. Here from the roof, the grim records, poet salute the spin. Cave where I knew you when troops were been, I shoot the lead. And let loose the hand, right close to where the foods were in. Fry ya brain, roots and grits, who'll spin, the scoops of men. Pick a soot suit and then strangle, mangle and slaughter you. Storm dream marauder who meat markets you artists. A large scholastic lesson from butcher college. Tear your gut open, out gasses, liquids and solids. The'll be astonished, how I left the whole place polished. Carry mad knowledge, for those who wrestle wit concepts. Warcloud, outsiders, wanderers and conquerors. Warriors, angry men, war mongers, barbarians. Holy men, crusaders, face huggers and space truckers. Brake fuckers backs, your spines were made of Lego. I laugh like a merchant who teeth were made of Play-Do. Champs and your brought out, I snatched the bitch by them jaw out. Hacksaw your leg, it's evening at the raw house. Warcloud, don't play monologue, pleasure ships. Slumped on a horse wit a tomahawk, and desert mints. Gallop through snowflakes, tent him and catch a rope face. Razor blade tropical snowstorm, that slopes waste. Tatter rappers to form, holy lyrics you torn. Fly like a diamond wing unicorn, beyond the norm'. [Chorus x2]. [Outro: Warcloud]. Wu-Tang Clan, West Coast, Killa Beez. Mad axes, mad axes, mad axes. [sample:] ""What do you call yourself, politically and how do you define it?"""
"mics, turntables, spray cans, & records","(feat. The Parralax). [Intro: Warcloud]. Aiyo g, we gon' bong, pinball over here, down the street. Yo, the Los Angeles fabulous. Yo, Warcloud, the Skarekrow, Leviathan. The Great Chiefs, yo, it's how we rock it. Yo, yo, go how we rock it. [Hook x2: Warcloud]. Mics, turntables, spray cans and records. Mics, turntables, spray cans and records. [Warcloud:]. Aiyo, my pen is a merciless sword that burns you open. Throw ya arms and legs in a big barrel of vinegar. Puny little men in green uniform, want to hurt Warcloud. Warcloud smash, the planet crash. Deep in the Sun, I'm awfully unstable. Spin like a quarter on the edge of a coffee table. Sterling rap cap muthafuckas like AK's. For decades, I infect AIDS to rap brigades. A mutated stranded, swell up ya head and burst it. Hideous by pitiless greed, hits on a prettiest. Eat through the walls, and I look at ya girls skirt, cuz. Cambodian dirt buzz, waffle chromes and soap suds. Helicopter fire power shower you after April. Warehouse machinery, heavy bionical chronicle. Old abominable super sonical, metropolital. Metacarpals, pop orchestra, run away ya vertebrae. Swamp voice, in for thick natures, raise ya flexures. Bitter bone lecture epics, holdin' cryptic. Down in the hollow, men crumble when I mumble. Underwater cyber jungle, lyrics tumble. [Hook x2: same time as the chorus]. [Chorus x2: Leviathan]. Great Chiefs, we slaughter, clobber all impostors. Urban legends stalkers, fresh off the meat locker. Urban legends stalkers, Great Chiefs, we conquer. Clobber all impostors, fresh off the meat locker. [Leviathan:]. Drunk off the Lager, slobber, speech improper. Zoomin' past coppers, renegade hip hoppers. Shake, rattle or shatter, mirrors to windows. Hench those, ears and cannons, drums explode. The verter-breaker, homes, Holmes, we got you done. Out, Great Chief scout, muzzle ya snout dog. It's turbulence, turbulence, else swift. Knuckle uppercut, detachin' the fence. Scars are, permanent, permanent. Parallax crack backs, on wax, smack ya brats. Trapped in a torture rack, we torture tracks. Sure son release the Mantra, asthma, microphone basher. Answer for ya cancer, tomahawk slasher, yo, causin' disaster. [Chorus/Hook x2]. [Leviathan:]. Fresh off the meat locker.... [Skarekrow:]. Lyrics leave you wit more knots then spots on a leopard. The crocodile shepherd, leave teeth marks in records. And bend microphones, form funeral homes. That's right boy, you in the danger zone. I hook up wit M.C.'s, make love to M.P.'s. Half natural laborer, give birth to C.D.'s. Drop niggas on they heads like careless baby-sitters. You can throw ya best verses, and I'll, flush 'em down the shitter. Tear out ya tongue and feed us to the scavengers. Carve a mark on my chest, for every wanted challenger. Who died on this mission and got malnutrition. Went up against drive, and then survived the collision. My hands swoop from my pockets, evil plotter eye socket. Couldn't block it, broke his forearm tryin' stop it. My comment, ripped his veins to his arm pits. And dragged the flag, puffin' through hot car pits. Hard hits to the head, make the genius retarded. Flip confidence like the Red Sea garden. Bear trap raps, snapped on his back from the black man. Tryin' to grow on site, take the flight on the demise. [Chorus/Hook x2]. [Leviathan:]. Fresh off the meat locker. [Unknown singer:]. We can be, we can be, we can be.... [Hook x2]. [Outro: Warcloud (unknown singer)]. Great Chiefs (We can be, we can be, we can be, everything.... We can be anything...)"
old toy room (a pie in the window),"[Intro: Warcloud]. Lucky charms.... When it rains the flowers drip candy. To attack and spit ground.... [Chorus x2: Warcloud]. Hot apple pie, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Shavings of white and dark chocolate melted over. Crushed up almonds and peanuts, taste. Niagara grapes, the highest in mental states. [Warcloud:]. A mosquito in the book store, dastardly tales of torment. Street corner minds and bad medicine vendors. Try to overthrow you, take the celestial railroad. Vitamins and intense oil, moist in poetry. Deep depths of gun, that's a falling of sparrows. Music from the sun, a simple art of war. Trouble is my business, vital summer observer. Evil is the victim, merchant prince of burglars. Who struck each down, snatchin' ya fake veils. Got parrots wit pterodactyl wings and snake tails. They whistle when I feed them, demons fingers and toes. Fair well my lovely, blood-curdling scenery. Chateau, Braille, Capon, an allure. Alcazar, on the balcony, dunkin' donuts in Java. Last my horizon, never sound retreat. The lost regiment, rise of the walking dead. Battle flag tattered in stain, call us windigos. Sasquatch, Yeti, battalion with one head. All devils fled, of man, they were a replica. Indians and cowboys, cops and robbers, America. Long good-bye, I'm headed towards Arabia. Persian in states, and pyramids made of ice. Milk not, gather no sand, mighty architect. Creator of all, and rest within the universe. Soon to burst, acid, rocks, flesh and silver. Never speak in questions, the scriptures of a building. [Chorus x2]. [Warcloud:]. Astronaut candy, space caramel, jelly beans. Gyms from around the world, sparkle Knights. Blue socks, fancy red shoes, shiny bottle caps. Toy chest, green and white blocks, triangle buttons. Baseball gloves, a book of picture riddles. I swing on moonshine, and a big city with fiddle. Little do they know, it'll be sunset for those. Telephone poles, dirty pistols and foes. Gun 'em down, that rough magic, sugar time. Briefcase man, sand castles and bowling pins. Barrels full of cherries, grapes and rusty nails. Steel corn chips, Spanish peanuts and dusty rail. Headin' down stone steps towards the old attic. Architect static, Pacific to the Atlantic. Arctic, Indian Ocean, black sand. Toe prints, gray sea shells, French vanilla. Seven horses, seven arrows, seven scalps. Over night delivery, sailin' the seven seas. Seven corks in champagne bottles, sit in the breeze. A bust off of which, smoke stacks and trees. Money comes from paper, smoke comes from burnin' it. Smoke stacks are made from metal found in the ground. Same as the buzz-saw, paper comes from wood. Any answer to the question's, no good, that is the hood. No friendly neighbor, set plants in animals. Cain before Abel is cannibal, understandable. [Chorus x3]. [Outro: Warcloud]. Jill got her feet cut off while she slept. Eighty eight black birds on a telephone wire. One peacock at the top. That was the house that Jack built"

For the price of an argument, to fuck up my high. Fuck up my day, it ain't goin' down that way. Cuz something's gon' make me smack yo ass (bitch!). Mad cuz our splashed don't trick cash. Don't give a fuck, roll wit my niggas, Bar Mitzvah slut. Phones stay off the hook, now ya ass is fed up. Disrespect my click like we don't keep it crunk. Stay in ya place and keep ya ass outta my shoes. Hit the road bitch, if you can't follow the rules, so what you choose?. [Crisis:]. It might be the P.M.S., it might be the alcohol. It might be the fact that the Black Knights about to ball. [All (Kurupt):]. Something's gon' make me smack this bitch. (Bitch, bitch, make me rich). [Monk:]. It could be the naggin', it could be the braggin'. It could be the fact she hatin', cuz the nights splashin'. [All (Kurupt):]. Something's gon' make smack this bitch. (There bitch, you gots to skitz kadaf, it). [Doc Doom:]. You short on chips, runnin' her lips. Don't wanna share the pussy wit the rest of the click, but. [All (Kurupt):]. Something's gon' make me smack this bitch. (Yeah I know that bitch, that bitch ain't shit). [S. Man:]. I fuck hoes for the squirtin' any season. African, Korean, European, Polynesian. No further reason to lessen my capacity. From the scrotum, cuz the nut gush it gradually. I'm S-man, tastefully delicious. Spittin' my game, gracefully, the bitches. I meant to step, the ladies pimp, the Don Peter. 380, concealin' 'Gnac, pussy beater. Bitch bring a heater if it's cold outside (bi-atch!). You better walk if I want at to ride (bi-atch!). Fly like a bird if you wanna be free. Cuz I hate hoes, and hoes hate me. Lately, I've been watchin' you, watchin' me. Ain't no stoppin' me, from gettin' this pussy for free. Cuz pussy's made to be poked, don't be afraid of the stroke. [Warcloud:]. Now I'm big Warcloud from the L.A. streets. Swing a timepiece, last name: Concrete. I crack a crystal coconut, cruisin' wit a silly bitch. Smellin' like cigarette, high, we drove by. Apple martini's and tic tac, forget that. She's wearin' so much make-up, if I slap her, her face will shatter. Riffraff fiddle sticks, Huck Finn the lawyer. I make her paint the fence like her name was Tom Sawyer. Dirty, beggy Thatcher, I'm great like Joe DiMaggio. I used to write books by a soda pop and the Cosby Show. I push a girl down real hard and watch him laugh. His smile so twisted the world will feel the draft. Young, and the Rocky just shootin' at tin cans. Goofy bitch said something that made me mad (bitch!). Gray jackrabbit, black boxing gloves, so love. I smack you like a toucan, swattin' a turtle dove (goofy bitch). [Chorus: All (Kurupt)]. Something's gon' make me smack this bitch. (Yeah, I'mma end up puttin' somethin' in this bitch right here). Something's gon' make me smack this bitch. (Oh man you see that bitch over there). Something's gon' make me smack this bitch. (Say bitch, don't you owe me some bread). Something's gon' make me smack this bitch. (Yeah, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, give me some head). Something's gon' make me smack this bitch. (I ain't got money for you, nigga). Something's gon' make me smack this bitch. (Bitch, shut up, shut up, bitch). [Outro: Kurupt]. I know you bitch, you ain't nothin', ain't never been nothin'. If you was a quarter, bitch, you already broken down to a penny. You bitch, yeah, yeah, now go out there and get by bread. 'For I slap the wig off of ya"
strawberry creme,"(feat. Black Knights). [Intro: Warcloud]. All you mad babies out there. You beautiful young ladies, this one's for you. Go out and shake ya little fanny, you fancy fuck. [Chorus x2: Warcloud]. Strawberry creme champagne's her last name. Strawberry creme champagne's her last name. Strawberry creme, strawberry creme. Strawberry creme champagne's her last name. [Warcloud:]. Liqourice and ice cream, chocolate chip cookies. She moves like the enchantress, vixens and belly dancers. Nah, playboy, that's you, I'm cruisin'. With a big bottle, cigarettes and groovin'. Watch her sly movement, chicks can suck my boing-boing. When we gonna join-join, back, flippin' a coin-coin. Keep the pistol tuck-tuck, slap it like a truck-truck. Glance at an elegant broad, wit a yuck-yuck. His dirty luck-luck, pair neck to groovy. I might go up to the roof wit pretty Suzy. Or another cutie, keep my music spooky. We touchin' mad tropical fruit, cold and juicy. Watermelon waterfalls, teeny bikini bitches. Silly, silly, silly, ice sunken treasure and riches. Give a champ stitches, turn the place into Fight Club. How many French maids does it take to screw in a light bulb?. Classy model chicks, an apple martini. I pour my champagne in a wine glass, wit peony. L.A. hustle, might greet you with a knuckle. And tongue kiss an actress makin' the place buckle. Malt shots and roller-skates, caterpillars on mint leaves. Malt shots and roller-skates, caterpillars on mint leaves. [Chorus x2]. [Warcloud:]. The bouncers give respect to the Black Knights vet. Might rock the whole party wit a mic and cassette. Apple stems and cherry pit, sweat a strawberry bitch. Shaped like a vase full of Indigo pearls. Pistol walk swiftly, ice cream on her pantyhose. Ask me to dance, I drank and dropped a sandy rose. Bowl of cherry Cola, evening at the club house. Black Knight berserkers, crowds is givin' love out. Might just rub out, some that look thugged out. Deep in the party, knuckles on the bar. Ice cold drinks, chewin' Malaysian bubble gum. Miniskirt Mom, lyrics'll they will trouble some. Bodies lay in the hall, a bloody ball. The flying birds now all fall, I stand tall. Cashews and walnuts, loungin' lavender lime light. An apple full of sour gummy worms, you couldn't rhyme right. [Chorus x2]. [Crisis:]. Sexy bitch, yo, you beautiful, do you know what I'd do to you? (What?). All the above, you incredible, lookin' edible (for real?). Girl you look like a meal in small bills. That's my brother Monk, maybe him and ya girl can build. [Monk:]. Casually step this, splashin', I the rugged Monk-Monk. This fine bitch glance, while dance, she backed it up-up. Amazed by my swift high pitch, she got stuck-stuck. Henny off the breath from the bar, fo' sho, I'm drunk-drunk (so what's. crackin'?). [Crisis:]. Beds and backboards, whatever you ask for. Except kisses, hay and cash, what more can you ask for?. Oh yeah, only time I go raw is the jaw (where we about to go?). Well shit, we rollin' wit ya'll. [Monk:]. So what's ya name? (Champagne). [Crisis:]. And yours (Elaine). [Monk:]. You'se a fly dame (hop in). We poppin', I got the black box, go raps, let's go to Compton. Mistress crack a travel live, room 212, my entourage. It's waitin'. [Crisis:]. Patiently, damn this remy martin's makin' me see double. That and the weed made me stumble out the vehicle. Didn't let the ho see it though. And that nigga Monk, rollin' up some more weed to smoke"
the beer song,"[sample repeated through out the song:] ""Oh yeah, oh-oh yeah"". [Intro: Warcloud]. The same, yeah, same ol' song. Same song, call it the beer song. Fuckas, the beer song. Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song. Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song. Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song, fuckas. Bud Light, beer, worldwide, for more, beer. This how we rock it, yo. [Chorus x2: Warcloud]. We all cheer for big bottles of beer. We all cheer for big bottles of beer. Tall cans, short cans, small bottles, clear. We all cheer for big bottles of beer. [Warcloud:]. Stone becomes red, yo, champ, we cheer beers. For nine hundred years, robust you, so stand clear. Warcloud, call him the sleepwalker wit phantoms. For old Sam Adams, Budweiser, Miller and Tantrum. Grumpy drunk, lazy and crazy, I'm drunk tomorrow. Drinkin' big grades, I swagger and swipe the cargo. Six packs, twenty four packs and gun powder. I brought two gauge and my gun'll turn you to chowder. Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song. Got me up in North Long Beach, smokin' a tree in bong. Keep a heavy pistol, hip hop was kinda joggy. Kid, back up off me, I murder you kind of sloppy. I drink crazy beer, big beers in bad bars. From the tap, I squeeze eight mugs and date slugs. Play hugs, as I stumble out late, wit a great bottle. Rev a Harley, squabble, catch coffin straight from Chicago. Model broads love flashy little ones, sip a fiddle one. Pop you wit the gat, snap a brew and watch the dribble run. [Chorus x2]. [Warcloud:]. Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song. Rice ball it, wheat, and hot, to make the year long. Cigarette fell to the bottom, of the beer can. I use sportsmen steel, faster than ears can. Now they fear man, and Warcloud was great. I smoke a big Dutch, statue at the bottom of Beer Lake. I lick off shots from a crop duster and bet. We'll go beer, sunrise to sunset. Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song. Rice ball it, wheat, and hot, to make the year long. Cigarette fell to the bottom, of the beer can. I use sportsmen steel, faster than ears can. Now they fear man, and Warcloud was great. I smoke a big Dutch, statue at the bottom of Beer Lake. I lick off shots from a crop duster and bet. We'll go beer, sunrise to sunset. Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song. Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song. [Chorus x2]. [Warcloud:]. The dirty bat flies anyway, we love beers. Sip a frosty mug in a row boat, at winter times. Snowy forest days at Christmas and through the year. We all cheer for big bottles of beer. Skarekrow music, your beats the Stevie Wonder. I drag a rapper under, drink Larvae age the whole summer. Thunder mermaid hair in a bottle, at the bar. The attic toy pistol and cotton for a beard. The cheerleaders cheered, blood on the mirrors smeared. My flow is architect tonic and atmosphere. Cold beers, cold cans, cold bottles and kegs. I bust crazy shots at the legs if you square pegs. Whacko wit a stool on your chest, the place bubble. I hustle up a couple of Coors cans and chuggle. I'm laughin' wit the cat, you found my book of witches. I'm at the regal eagle wit the Three's Company bitches. Drink wit the pirates, cruisin' and never steer wrong. Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song. [Chorus x2]. [Outro: Warcloud]. Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song. Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song. Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song. Yeah, yeah, yo we drink beers forever. Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song. Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song. Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer"
the renaissance,"(feat. The Parralax). [Intro: Leviathan]. Ah, West Coast, ah, the renaissance. It's the renaissance, strangers wit candy. Leviathan, Warcloud, Mantra, word. It's the renaissance ya'll. [Hook x4: Leviathan]. Those who were blessed in the garment. Shall be, shall be not reincarnated. [Leviathan:]. Yo it's the dynamo, body blow specialist, here to twist wrists. Kidnap ya life, take a hike and don't forget this. Broke, you bout to learn, hip hop's not always business. Cuz underground authentic linguistics, represent ships. That launch missiles at ""Wannabeez"" under seas. Victorious, P.A.C., crossbreeds. Who don't have a clue, stop rhymin' like you're brand new. Parallax, we see right through, nobody's fool. Unglue, you're molecules'll send you back together. I'm Leviathan, lickin' shots wit the strangler. We cliffhangers, unit bangers. Echo no Asian honey lemon, will throw drop full of nature. The revolution won't platinumized and televised. We third dimension strangers here for you to analyze. In this wilderness, of America-ca-ca. We carry heads and roll them back to bury the sucka. Cuz he deadly palm, shatter your dome and scatter your bones. You hear the tone dialin' you out, it's combat zone. [Chorus x2: Mantra]. Poison blood from the bay of pigs, catcher in the rye. Walkin' dogs to West Asia, kept them in a bind. Retreat to the sea cliff, strength versus weakness. People of the world, let my particles unite. [Warcloud:]. Aiyo, let the dead bury their dead, the wasteful son. You caught 'em wit a bucket of blood, down in Damascus. Eighty eight back flips, stack chips and write. Though eye is the organ of sight, I cracked it twice. Tripped to oblivious, slaughter you in the rut. While you worship what you know not what, your crew's snuff. I battle til my brain shuts off, the street's left you. A strange man kept you, he crept through a can of beans. Bone dust suffer, rap protein forever. And eat to reality, gun you down in a tragedy. Somethin' from the nightmare realm, abnormality. Snap your rib cage out your back, don't call the Warcloud. Red, white and blue werewolf, wit sleep technique. Bop you on your head hard, wit the last baseball. Autographed by Babe Ruth, devil's better respect God. Perplex odd, quote that was Para' mention you, injure you. Heavy old sword, that warm body will smother you. Jockeys in the rain, we rob you in living luxury. Them poison Adam eaters, come and try to defeat us. The famous old story of the Ace and his three kings. In the Parallax, I'll chop you all up in to stacks. Flap jack back, they froze a fifty two pickup. Crunchy shots burst the slump, wit bloody hick-ups. Battleground sound, Warcloud the dirty planter. Wu-Tang soldiers will buzz saw on you wit records. Password crept it, perplexed it by rap embargo. It's like cotton doll, bird feathers and marbles. Mineral bats, sharp water, save yourself, buckers. You can never buck us, I want you to try and touch us. [Chorus x2]. [Mantra:]. The stigma of a flower, pistol in a hair piece. A static symbol of a mind, that impeach. The legacy on the mound, he was known as Saint Tropez. Struck men out for the effect of oppressive ages. Unstable cages, radicals'll rush us in the classroom. They shoot off in the black boy jungle. Misty serenades, the bogarts'll cook. Pendulum foot, I was in, he didn't look. When Mantra broke out the window, bird became cuckoo. Flew over sea-saw, chiefs who come to greeet you. Villages concealed in the sounds of the vultures. Crashed on the streets, where my kids gotta eat. Lady vinegar, momma let the heart spill. Armor shade bias, catch your high tide crescents. Ran from Allah, free cypher for self banishment. Sun spot, rise of the apricot, catch. Twelve trot, understanding hell of happiness. Somebody told me that the Parallax were here. Left hands are diced, then writin' on Sheik punishment. Catcher in my name is in the straw hoods of Saigon. Nation of water comes down from hot places. Hard for critics to rate this, solid basement. Mechanize a thought when I walk, gather a witness. Recordin' ya'll shit, whether people's faces change. Like a scent on the brain, family portrait was hung. A livin' myth was taken, tunnel to be driven. And subterranean vessels, carry the sleepin' conscience. Took a train to market, get your hands out my pockets. [Bridge x3: Leviathan]. Aiyo, yo, reincarnated M.C.'s. Agree or disagree the style is restin' in peace. [Leviathan:]. Because.... [Hook x2]. [Outro: Leviathan]. Not reincarnated, hah, word, not reincarnated"
vicious killer beez,"(feat. North Star & Suga Bang Bang). [Intro: Warcloud]. North Stars, North Star, North Star, Cha-Cha-Cha-Cha-Cha. Warcloud. [Warcloud:]. Flame tanks, stealth tanks, mammoth tanks, and hover tanks. Cargo planes and gun boats, I smother banks. Helicopter landing, step off and shoot standard. And blow you into fly with a particle beam cannon. Skiing off a snow slope on fire. And it's still snowing, The Big Wolf on Campus. Shots run rampid, their bodies are now my canvas. Hot chain-gun your soldiers fell in the sandpits. At my weapons factory I am the new prototype. If you're like me you're at the repair facility. Warcloud, day at the power plant, the warhawk. To ladies Mr Chair-hands blow a hole through your store lock. Bank heist in Kathmandu, it was a slaughter. The day Buddha was born it rained tea instead of water. Old toys in the ""Old Toy Room"" cock revolvers. I camoflauge in rocks with guns and crystal armor. An old man and his wife wrecked their car in the mountains. and wandered up 3 miles then to their surprise. they found a ghost army hazy in their cataracts. And at the tip-top Warcloud threw his battle-axe. [Chorus x3: unknown reggae artist]. This killa bee, gun shot it by the rain. This killa bee, yes, you know a blood stain. [Christbearer:]. Christbearer be ya vital information. Grab the microphone and make somethin' outta Nathan (what?). With no jilation, my justation, germination. An Emancipation Proclamation in a rhythm vindication. M.C., free-mason degree with the gavel, mystery unravelled (God in the flesh). God in the being, y'all niggaz still cant see Jeanie/Genie. with a flow so dreamy, it's the phenomeonally, phenomenal, phenomenon. Young Genghis Khan is designed to be on, tip-toe onto the set. with my gods in the flex for Tyrannasaurus-Rex. I gets hotter than the hair on the gazelle. That, that threw the death deal with my style unveiled. It aint hard to tell, Christbearer done cracked the scale. with Coolie Mack and L (North side). I never let the truth and the false of the jail. All hail bearer, of the thunder Christbearer. [Chorus x3]. [Meko the Pharaoh]. Fuck it, let's tear the world up. since everybody motionless and don't give a fuck. Movin' like an SUV truck, Rollin on the right side high. Y'all niggaz can't fuck with this Long Beach mind. Tear down your city make everybody cry. And it's a shame how the world been tricked. I move across the nation with my global black fist. Coz niggaz out here is like terrorists. we'll blow your whole Ave. up with one stick (Wu!). And I ain't talkin' 'bout sherm. I'm talkin' 'bout shit to blow your whole damn firm. Actin' like you concerned, about me? (What?). You get dropped G, movin with your paparazzi (nigga). You takin' chances like you playin yahtzee. You could never fuck with me, North Star (Yeah). [Mikey Jarrett:]. Run outta luck, you know them run outta luck, ooh. Run outta luck, you know them run outta luck, ooh. Run outta luck, you know them run outta luck. Say when them check it out the killa bee dem buck off. Say when them check it out the killa bee dem buck off. Killa Bee and North Star, we done heard them step up. So listen and your lyrics when the God gonna spit. Say two shots are now suck up ina ya hip. So listen and your lyrics when the God gonna spit. Say two shots are now stuck up ina ya hip. So listen and your lyrics will pick up on the spliff. We no business if you a Blood and nah care if you a Crip. Say when we come through, you know strictly street sweep. Say when we come through on the crib, we a creep. Boy, you better go and go back down beneath. [Outro: Mikey Jarrett]. Yo, yo, yo, yo. Word up, man, Killa Bee, North Star. It's how we do it, blaw! blaw!. One, niggas"
