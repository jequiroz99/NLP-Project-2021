"black unicorn (feat. chrisette michele, sunni patterson)","And when you spiral through the atmosphere. All they see is motion. They never see the tears. They never feel the pain. They always think it's nothing but it's something. Such a shame. So caught up in the fantasy. Humanity has made a love story out of tragedy. But there is no romance. In life that's on the ledge. And there's no one to talk you down. And tuck you in the bed. Lord, it's so ironic that it's funny. Of something for the books or the bars. To bob your head and nod. I recall, so many never ever thought you'd make it. So sad they were mistaken. The joy they tried to take it. Mama said that ""The best thing you can do. And be is you. This world ain't got but one. So give credit where it is due"". Ain't that the truth. And here you are, a black unicorn. Mythical, mystical. Since the day that you were born. Mastered all the madness. Let the magic have his way. Let the power paint the day. Let the god have his say. Cause there's a place that you can go. No one else is allowed. Sitting up on your cloud. So high when you look down. Just glance upon the beauty. And the wonder to be found. Then know that you can stop your search. 'Cause love is all around. Yeah. Free at last, free at last. That's what I said when I got out my last deal. Some people can't relate. Sleep is the cousin of death. That is some Nas shit. And when it's cold outside. So your pipes won't bust, turn on your faucets. Drip, fuck the water bill. We stay in apartments. And everything is a obstacle. When they watching you. The hospital needs a hospital. Now they mocking you. They say the flattery is sincere. I rhyme like a nigga younger than me by ten years. Yeah, and that's my car talking. Old school running with the dogs barking. Parked out that bitch like I'm sellin' coffins. Weed so strong I be seldom coughin. And I'm covered in Balmain. Instagram pics of my lobster omelette. Sellin' that parcake, life aint no arcade. Now I got more knives than the 4th grade. Its all I really want. Its all I really want to be. Its all I really need. I want, I want to believe. Thought you had the best of me. Now I'm what you need, you need. Hear ye, hear ye. You cant come near me. Competition must fear me. Lyrically, I could be Talib Kweli. But with gold teeth it'd be hard. For some to believe. I leave them pussys stinkin like Summer's eve. I practicin' repitition now I need a hundred G's. A hundred M's, hug and squeeze. Dad kept us in the Dungarees. Rather rap but I love the cheese. I change hoes like I change gears. And my yard so big I got pet deers. And my homies try to act like aint real. I put my apron on. And taught myself how to make meals. You need a focus group, my group focus. Hit the loker jokers with the hocus pocus. I'm the dopest you can quote this under scope. Its just me and Goat,. Dirty ass niggas will sell your ass a key of soap. I'da seen em rich, I'da seen em broke. I'da seen it all watch the pregnant lady smoke. When the baby come out it gon' be geeked. You never know he might come out to be me. Its all I really want. Its all I really want to be. Its all I really need. I want, I want to believe. Thought you had the best of me. Now I'm what you need, you need"

live & learn (it will) (feat. dolla boy & pusha t),"(Verso 1: 2 Chainz). So many watches, I need a time capsule. Combine all my thoughts, make my mind travel.

"money on the floor (feat. big krit,8ball & mjg)","[Verse 1: Big Krit]. Is it me or is it something about a car. That makes a bad bitch get freaky fuck like porno stars?. Or maybe it was that chrome that keep a bopper in the zone. But either way she hit my phone like she can't leave me lone. And that there just keeps happening,. blame it on all this rapping shit. 10 out of 10 she dying to fuck, that's just what my average is. Slab and chassis lavishly, wood cabin, digi-dash in it. I'm an advocate. Chromed out wheels if you hop in here you might jet lag a bit. I'm passionate about everything that I want,. I do what it do and y'all don't. I put the whole world in my trunk, let it bump. Check the stars out when I ride, dodgin' potholes with these tires. Hogging lanes, swang and bang in a 'Stang so let me by. Cuz I got --. [Hook: Big Krit]. Money on the floor. Lighters on the dresser. Drop my top, no one can do it better. Diamonds and the leather. Wood and the chrome. Bopping ass hoes just won't leave me alone. [Verse 2: 8-Ball]. She call me big baby, I got my Guccis on. Black on black, head to toe, smelling like Prada cologne. Feeling like big pimping, inhale, exhale. Good green, thick lean, give them bitches x pills. Cocaine make them get so loose on them tequila shots. Every time I do it I regret it, the bitch just can't stop. Now she's dancing on the table, skirt done went up to her navel. Niggas throwing money at her, shit I can't be mad at her. [Verse 3: Mjg]. You bring the girl to me then I'mma bless her, yessir. 25 lighters on my dresser, yessir. My bitch on the block with some money on her mind. A pistol in her purse and a heart full of grind. I'm pimp type, Mj, drop my top, light that dro. Hand on the wood with the pedal on the floor. Forever get dough and I'm clever on the ho. Still get vetted man, never be a scary man. My Dna is all Ike Turner, Eddie King. [Hook]. [Verse 4: 2 Chainz]. 25 lighters, 25 cyphers. Went to jail and shared a cell with a 25-to-lifer. Stayed at my grandma house with 25 bibles. Stayed in the trap house with like 25 rifles. Drop my top and I dip dip dip. But if I pop my trunk you better duck, don't slip. Chrome lips on the vehicle look like they blowing kisses. Reel them hoes in, it look like I'm going fishing. Okay this how I ride, two bad hoes inside. One ho say she ready, the other ho said she tired. I'mma drop this other ho off, me and the other ho we gon ride. All jokes aside I'm the get money poster child. [Hook]"

They said I was killing tennessee when I was down in florida. Murder, murder, my shoes none than a quarter. Rapping with the murder team nobody wanna record us. Murder, murder listen to the chorus. Niggas wanna know how I get it when I get. Don't worry, just know it's murder. [hook]. [kreayshawn - verse 3]. This right here is murderous. I'm mama kreay the gangsterous. From the east to the west it gets dangerous. When you get that dough on display and shit. Bitches will be hating this. But my mind still climbs for greater-ness. That money that I'm playing with. Put a whole in your head with no blame for it. Saying it. I'm kaying. Come back to the block and I'm spraying it. Delaying, I'm stopping it. Put a end to your life, I'm blocking it. Your career bitch, you was never on. I heard 2 chainz blocked you off his phone. Bitch don't call him if you ain't 'bout to ho. Bitch don't call him if you ain't 'bout the doe. Hello.... Hello....

Jumpin out on anybody who try to say some one thing about it. Got a problem, I got the same one. Money rolls, we fold. Plently clubs we closed. Follow the same code. Never turn our backs, our cars dont even lose control. [hook]. I never feared death or dying. I only fear never trying. I am whatever I am. Only god can judge me, now I'm.
