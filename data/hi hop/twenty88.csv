london bridge,"[Chorus - Jhené Aiko:]. I don't mean to sound hysterical. But baby if you left, baby if you left. It'll be a historical disaster. The kids will sing about it swear the kids will sing about it. Like the London Bridge is falling down. London Bridge, London Bridge. Like the London Bridge is falling down. Falling down, falling down. [Refrain - Jhené Aiko:]. I heard everything must come to an end. Well hopefully the end ain't near. Or for that matter even clear. The only thing that matters is right here. Like the sky, the sun, the waterfalls. I decide when I'm gon' fall. I can't tell you everything I don't know. Oh baby I can't tell you everything I don't know. [Chorus - Jhené Aiko Big Sean:]. I don't mean to sound hysterical. But baby if you left, baby if you left. It'll be a historical disaster. The kids will sing about it, swear the kids will sing about it. Like the London Bridge is falling down. London Bridge, London Bridge. Like the London Bridge is falling down. Falling down, falling down. [Refrain - Jhené Aiko:]. I know everything that starts has an end. Well hopefully the end ain't near. Or for that matter even clear.

Falling down, falling down. [Verse - Big Sean:]. Who would have ever thought that we would fall like London bridges. I know you heard the rumors about me lies and superstitions. Heard but ain't choose to listen that's what made you different. And you keep me driven guess that's why I could see us going the distance. On nights you text and text and text with no auto corrections. Misspelling every other word but I still got the message. And you get carried away like you wearing wedding dresses. I'm sorry I even ever gave you reasons to question. Cause you make me feel like the chosen one. Eight billion people in the world and I still chose the one. Answer this question and I'll answer what you asking me. What happened if we got in an accident died tragically. And next lifetime you remembered and had to come after me. And convinced me that we not meant to be that have to be. And like the defending champs you had to win it all back for me. Just got to know how deep is our love actually. What if this was the end and we had to bow out together. I need you to tell me every emotion like now or never. Only two times I ever needed you was now and forever. Don't know what else to tell you. [Chorus - Jhené Aiko Big Sean:]. I don't mean to sound hysterical. But baby if you left, baby if you left. It'll be a historical disaster. The kids will sing about it, swear the kids will sing about it. Like the London Bridge is falling down. London Bridge, London Bridge. Like the London Bridge is falling down. Falling down, falling down"

selfish,"[Verse 1 - Big Sean:]. You know I ain't having that shit. (Got you Bitch). How could you be so selfish. Phone off, careless. You ain't drinking no more that's bullshit. I heard your taking more shots than a full clique. No call, no text, huh?. That's how you feel when you stressed, huh?. You know I'm from a tribe called questions. I need them answers now like it's test time. Do you realize how many good girls I lost. When I changed the number for you. When I needed that peaceful sleep and still cuddled for you. You ain't even know when times get hard I bent up the budget. I kept it subtle. Might as well put jackets over the puddles for you. You're acting irreplaceable, pfft, bitch, hardly. I feel like I chose the wrong bitch like Steve Harvey. When you back to me the morning time. You got me on the borderline. I used to want to put the work in now I feel like overtime. [Chorus - Big Sean & Jhené Aiko:]. When I hit you late night, texting. Phone off, no stressing. How could you be so selfish. Selfish, so selfish. Phone off, no texting. No pics, no calls, no sexting. How could you be so selfish. Selfish, so selfish. I can't help it. I can't help it. I can't help it. I can't help it. So, so selfish. [Verse 2 - Jhené Aiko:]. Why would you just play with the one who been there with you when no one would come. Can't believe I stayed faithful to somebody so ungrateful. Don't you know there's a line for my love. And you be out here lying on us. Ain't that some shit. Ain't that a bitch. And you wonder why the past has changed us. Wonder why it ain't the same for us. You keep fuckin it up it's all on you.

talk show,"[Intro:]. Welcome back, welcome back. to the very very very late night show. I'm your host like every night Lb. And uhh we got two of the biggest stars. in the world right now. I mean, we can't go anywhere. without hearing their names. Now you two usually keep it private. but you're about to open up and uhh. I guess we'll start with you. And tell us how you're feeling. [Verse 1 - Jhene Aiko:]. See I'm a real woman. A women that doesn't need much but. Appreciates a whole lot. And he always call me crazy, but I'm not crazy. I'm from La where the sun's always shining. so a lot of people are shady. But at least I got my baby. [Verse 2 - Big Sean:]. Yeah, right baby. Right, look. What's the difference between real love and fake love. The same difference between real titties and fake ones. You can feel the difference. And even though it changes overtime. It stays consistent, I ain't gonna lie though. It takes persistence. But you the one I wanna be with when the ball drop. That's why I send for you like the call drop. Plus I know all your insecurities. And I don't mean like mall cops. I mean the type we all got. I'm never focused on my exes more than our execution. No time to be stressed and confusing. A happy home is the best to move in. Just like happy endings can be the best conclusion. My dad used to say real love can be the best illusion. Because when you think it's there, it's already moving. And some feelings will leave before the rest can move in. And I know both of our families are divorced and suing. But look, this ain't repetition, It's evolution. You changed the theory up. You the type to have the hardest nigga tearing up. And all your friends around you try. to get their appearance up. When you ain't even wearing much. But real enough to remind me to hit my parents up. [Interlude:]. Aww make some noise everybody. everybody make some noise! Wow. That's just real. Love, you know... Beautiful. Makes me want to call my wife up right now. and just tell her. I Love her... I promise but Jhene. you were saying something along the... ohh. [Verse 3 - Jhene Aiko:]. Yeah he's sweet. I mean you know when he wants to be not all the time. Let's not front in front of all these people nigga. Don't act like just a couple weeks ago. you wasn't fucking with them bitches. Out here, disrespecting me. I mean you know I fucked up too. Went through your phone you wasn't looking. And I found out, but if we in the same house. the same building. Then you can't interrupt a happy home that's still buildin'. You ol' sneaky ass nigga. [Verse 4 - Big Sean:]. Fuck is you saying. Who are you talkin to. Never called you a bitch, but who are you barking to. Look you disrespecting me, calling me a lying ass nigga. Who are you trying, am I on trial?. Are you not the number one on my speed dial. You know that you tripping. You need guidance. You got these people inside our business. Like U and I is. You probably didn't even catch that did you. You're too undivided. You're too undecisive. You're too one sided. You the type to kick me out the house after I buy it. And then talk to me like you're the pro. when I'm the one that's been providing. I hate talking about what's private when we not in private. 'Cause I don't want to say nothing to piss your mother off. Since we inviting everyone in the bedroom. Let's take the covers off. And talking about how you fucking. what's his name who's so fucking lame. I wish I would've known before I took the rubber off (ah!). Got me questioning like is this even love at all. I used to see my future in your eyes like the crystal ball. Looking for some feelings in the lost and found. Contemplating. Thinking how we supposed to hold each other down. if we can't even hold on a conversation. You take the sex away. then what else are we left to lay in. I'm tired of fronting for these people. who ain't got our back. 'Cause to them it's all entertainment. And they not looking at us like we real people. Or like we up here just fuckin playing. And time's the only thing we can't afford. Then why would waste it. How we supposed to face our problems. If we can't even face to face it. [Outro - Big Sean:]. Fuck. Fuck this shit"
