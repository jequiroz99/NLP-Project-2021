24 hours,"They said ""no, I'm tired""; they say ""yes you can"". Push me to the fire, they say that you're the man. They said ""no I'm tired""; they say ""yes you can"". Push me to the fire, they say that you're the man. Toast to the new age superman. And fly around the globe. And leave home, to do shows. Our 24 hours is a week for most. Toast to the new age superman. And fly around the globe. And leave home, to do shows. Our 24 hours is a week for most. I gotta smile even when I feel let down. I just gotta live ready. I put the world on my shoulders before I left out. Shit's way too heavy. ""How dare you be tired, let alone stressed out?. Man, you're on the telly. "". ""And how can you moan about rollin' around?. Ain't you got a Bentley? "". Let me show you where I get lost. When I get picked up and I jet off. And I get picked up when I get off. Straight to hotel like ""get washed"". Do interviews and press shots. Then I hit the venue get my ""Wretch"" on. Feelin' hungry lookin' at the restaurant. But we gotta rush for our flight. Gotta get gone. And I get picked up when I get off. And I do a few phoners with some new press. Tryin to sound alive when I feel like death. Don't know what I need more, food or rest?. Bein' rude ain't ""Wretch"" so I've gotta take a picture. I'm with y'all when I ain't even with ya. Said ""follow me back"" my only problem with that. Is that my battery's flat, there's no twitter. No twitter, no Bb. In the back of car the new Et. I wanna phone home, believe me. But I can hear in your tone that you need me. It's ironic that I spoke to The Sun. Before I spoke to my son. Almost like I'm gettin scared of familiar voices. And that's somethin that I'm really annoyed with. It's like the things that seem to mean most. Just end up one of my a million choices. So how do I how avoid this?. Without hearing your pointers?. I said ""no, I'm tired"" they say ""yes, you can"". Push me to the fire, they say that ""you're the man"". I said ""no, I'm tired"", they say ""yes, you can"". Push me to the fire, they say that ""you're the man"". You're the man (x5). (Yo Wretch, Wake Up; Wake up, We're here). That sleep in the car felt like a few hours. It was just a few minutes. And I reach for my Red Bull to get some power. But I forgot it was finished. Went straight into makeup to get that powder. For that fake star image. Now go look alive, then they throw me my mic. And I'ma straight up kill it. Ladies say I got gorgeous cheeks. Smile for the pictures before I leave. My head's been spinning since 4 or 3. So after the flash I see four of me. The whole team's spirits like a courtesy. Just find the first place and it's soon on me. One more Pa, then we all can sleep. That 24 hours was an awesome week. That 24 hours was an awesome week. That 24 hours was an awesome week. Welcome to the darkest island. Happiness seems so saddenin'. How are you standing?. Welcome to the darkest island. Happiness seems so saddnin'. How are you standing?. The hunger's gonna feed you action"

all that i need,"It's crazy, cah i remember when i never felt like this.. It was only the other day i was 'lying next to you'.. I remember i done ish, you forgave me.. Even though i 'can't say' (heh).. But we both know 'nothing lasts forever'.. (psssh) listen. Cah i am not with you no more. Your no good for me, your just bringing me down. My son shines in the rain while your giving me clouds. I once cried and complained now i'm kicking out. Cah i refuse to live in doubt, i don't trust you. It's weird 'cause i love you, but fear cannot love. Who it chooses to scare. Now i'm stress out losing my hair. What's next i ain't losing the year. Your supposed to be me crutch. As of lately you provoked me enough. Especially when i'm closed to being up. I'm finishing my album, your tryna kick when i'm down and. Focusing on other tings, a real women's supposed to be mothering. Not like holding a grudge and ting, when i'm in the studio late. And when i don't come home for a few of the days. Out the week, that just means that i'm doing it babe. Allowed to speak, of course you are. But don't force it cah. I never liked that you crossed the line. You said something that shouldn't even cross your mind. And that's a criminal sentence so do the time. Without me. i'm just doing i. Allow me i am through that wire. I'm now free i am moving higher. I'm proud to see that your cruising aiya. (huh) but i am not beside ya. [chorus:]. All that i need. Is my own space, i've been chilling on my own for days, i say. All that i need.

Plus i can't look my son in the face, cah i remember the day. That i told his mum chuck him away. But she never listened. She gave birth i was there to vision. It's a boy was the words i whispered. (huh) and i remember that look on your face. When the nurse said push it again. Your like i can't mommy, i was like your pushing it babe. Your like it's hard bubby, the tears would fall on your face. I'm like gwan honey. Then i gave you a kiss on your lips. (huh) it's weird that i'm picturing this. Cah fastforward as i listen to this (all that i need). Piss'd. (huh) listen we learnt a lesson that we'll never dismiss. Cah i never thought we'll end up like this. (huh) cah perfect films always end with a kiss. And i swear we're at the end of the script.

anniversary (fall in love)(feat. alex mills),"It's funny how we share those laughs, and a year goes fast,. I can't wait till another years goes past,. Grinding, trying make your ear lobes glass,. Diamonds, I put you in a pharaohs arms,. Lets raise those glasses, nobody claimed that we lost it,. We just overcame all the crosses,. Everyone staring at your frame when your passing,. Used to get me jealous,. I ain't changed I'm a bastard,. Only thing changed now I'm car sick,. Why are you driving me crazy,. We just went half's on a baby,. When I have half on a scales,. One day we will have a bunch like bradies,. Right now we just gotta wait no creating,. I'm trying to stay on my feet cos I'm lazy,. Now u can never leave or replace love,. Cos if we make one it will break us.. [Pre-Chorus:]. We should make a toast,. cos we just went from one year to another,. And I never thought that we'd be this close,. we gotta fight when I ride you like a brother,. But your my lover, so lets make a toast,. cos we just went from one year to another,. And I never thought that we'd be this close,. we gotta fight when I ride you like a brother,. But your my lover.. [Chorus:]. Baby take my hand, your my everything,. When we made it through the storm again,. Your my hottie and my little thing,. Said every word would last but,. Every little passage,. We fall in love we fall in love we fall in love again.. Look, sometimes I feel like you mirror me,. cos you remind me of myself when we disagree,. Arguments, always seemed verbal, literally,. then we'd get hotter than an inferno physically,. Yeah and I never acted spiritually,. then I saw mini me looking like a different me,. And, this is weird, isn't me, and this is overhill softly killing me,. Stung like I was hit with a wasp. and a killer bee for the first time like I lost my virginity,. My head gone no guillotine,. I still get my game on, don't finish me,. Yeah and let me spring through the winter time,. the greatest season on earth gotta let it shine,. They never thought that we'd make it to the finish line,. Now were on our victory lap upon the window vine,. [Pre-Chorus]. [Chorus]. And we share those laughs and a year goes fast,. but can't wait till another year goes past,. We share those laughs and a year goes fast,. but can't wait till another year goes past,. We share those laughs and a year goes fast,. but can't wait till another year goes past,.

Every verse every day like. Every word every tape. Every person that ate I. Still got the same hunger. So I work every day why?. The closer I get now the further. My break time. Being safe ain't safe. But the combinations still the same. You do you and everybody commentates. On your game. That's just the way it plays. But I remember being eight.

breathe (sha la la),"3 bedroom house. 6 live inside it. Queuing up for the bathroom is a hype ting. Staring out the window. All you see is rain and some little bit of lightning. Chillin in the ends to the police show up. If one makes a joke then they get shown up. Round ere your friends are your family. If ur dad aint around then the ends grows us. These are the times when you feel most neglected. Our mum just sent you to the shop to get electric. And deep down you didnt wanna go,. but if you ever let her know then you're livin on the road. And right now you're livin on the road,. but its nice to know that you got the choice of going home. Its wierd cuz its busy in the pitch,. but you still cant catch who's pissin in the lift. [Chorus:]. (sha la la) I'm like just give it a rest man, I know best man please. (sha la la) police are still chattin, preachin I had it like please. (sha la la) cuz all the words I'm hearin. got my eardrums burning like please. (sha la la) you got nothing good to say. then just keep quiet and breathe. Livin paranoid that's what the game does. Sitting there talkin how the world is a game. And how you scared of what change does. Why would we leave estate it made us. Mum keeps saying I should go and get a job. So that's the reason that we dont get along. Saying she gonna send me to live with my dad. Everyone's an influence and they leading me on. But she dont understand that I'm my own man. I can make me a grand or make her a gran. Only thing changes is the number of the days. So with that selotape Imma stick to the plan. Cuz its the only way I know how to live. And dont claim that you know how it is. Cuz if you ever walk one mile in my shoes. You be slippin in the ends like you need better grip. [Chorus:]. (sha la la) I'm like just give it a rest man,. I'm know best man please. (sha la la) police are still chattin, preachin I had it like please. (sha la la) cuz all the words. I'm hearin got my eardrums burning like please. (sha la la) you got nothing good. to say then just keep quiet and breathe. (sha la la). Growing up we were ever so skint. That made it so hard tryin to be the fresh prince. I stopped combing my hair on purpose. Just so my mom would make me get a fresh trim. Lookin in the mirror while I'm gettin out the chair. Mumbling to myself ""what the fuck you done here"". But I didnt even say it cuz I know I gotta pay him. Cuz when you growing up I know nothing aint fair. Bodged trim, hoody up, trying to chat girls. She said I chatted up the rest of the world. Said I sent texts when I never had credit. The truth is that I done it on free voicemail. I aint saying that I never had a good life. But every other night I had to watch brookside. The soaps are getting boring and its lonely at the bottom. One day I'm gonna make it out the hood life. [Chorus:]. (sha la la) I'm like just give it a rest man, I know best man please. (sha la la) police are still chattin, preachin I had it like please. (sha la la) cuz all the words. I'm hearin got my eardrums burning like please. (sha la la) you got nothing good to say. then just keep quiet and breathe. (sha la la) I'm like just give it a rest man, I know best man please. (sha la la) police are still chattin, preachin I had it like please. (sha la la) cuz all the words. I'm hearin got my eardrums burning like please.

doing ok,"I was a lonely man, you can find me downtown. Playing blues songs for anybody that comes round. Now they hear me sing, they want to come round round. I been waiting long for the sun to shine down. I'm doing ok. I'm doing ok. I'm doing ok. I'm doing ok. Imagine that. Never gave a shit, now I'm giving back. Used to run around the flats saying ""brap"". Now I got the whole festival saying that. Thinking 'bout the youths that I've taxed. Now look at me paying Vat. I remember coming home to my bags. The door wasn't on the latch. But mum, I'll always love you for that. Only real women make a man. That's why I wanna give you more than a hand. That's why I wanna give you more than my bank. I just wanna see you fly, wanna bring back my nan. Wanna put you in the sky, give you land when you land. Still ain't met your new man. He better do you right 'fore I turn this to a wrap. 'Cause I'm living on kick. I was a lonely man, you can find me downtown. Playing blues songs for anybody that comes round. Now they hear me sing, they want to come round round.

Late night daydreaming 'bout my kids. 'Til the day I die, they're the reason that I live. I just had to do it right, done the legit thing. I ain't just a role model in the business. Tell my baby mother don't cry for me. I'll just have to love you from a distance. And I'm still the man, just a little more clearer. I traded grams, switched them for letters. Just like Instagram makes things look better. When I hit the ground, I'll live forever. Live forever, I'm alright with that. Rolex on my wrist, good times are back. Can't get evicted, I can buy my flat. Life's so relaxed. [I was a lonely man, you can find me downtown. Playing blues songs for anybody that comes round.

don't be afraid,"As the darkness turns to day, only you stand in the way,. No stops when you're on a run, understand who you've become.. You're the fire in the rain, only greatness will remain,. Push up, yes I raise the bar, don't be afraid of who you are,. You are, you are, who you are,. You are, you are, don't be afraid of who you are. [Verse 1: Wretch32]. Growing up I liked G-banks,. But everyone was saying he was too cocky,. I noticed when you're the new champ,. There ain't nothing you can do properly,. That's why I'd rather run my race,. Before I think about how they judge my face,. I came to be the best so my training was immense,. 24 hours and I won't even break a sweat,. I won't even take a rest cause to sleep when your dead's enough,. Main side of mileage on my price is still wearing off,. Had to put smiling to the side and get serious,. Wanna join me you're free to, that's the Wretch in ya,. I bet it feels like I'm directing ya,. Mr Tom-Tom going in and out your area,. It's a long run, you feel hate till you're scared of love,. I'm just trying to paint the picture, is it clear enough?. [Hook: Delilah]. As the darkness turns to day, only you stand in the way,. No stops when you're on a run, understand who you've become.. You're the fire in the rain, only greatness will remain,. Push up, yes I raise the bar, don't be afraid of who you are,. [Wretch 32:]. Tell me if you're with me,. I said I'm traveling at wind speed, ye-e-eah,. Tell me if you're with me, yea. Because I'm traveling at wind speed, ye-eah.. [Verse 2: Wretch 32]. Wake up on a high, and then I cross my heart and hope to fly,. With one question on my mind,. If you gotta stay grounded how the hell do ya touch the sky?. Assuming we're born to die,. But it's what you do between that deters if you're alive,. You only kill your dream when you open up your eyes,. And impossible's just a word that we recite,. It's a word that we've relied on for way too many years,. When they've put a man on the moon, planes in the air,. Probably said Houdini was a fraud before he disappeared,. Zuckerburg never had a penny to a millionaire,. Are you listening with your vision ears, ride to the willful,. Off in different years, I've engaged in a busy year,. I died trying to make my paradise, but I'm living it.. [Hook: Delilah]. As the darkness turns to day, only you stand in the way,. No stops when you're on a run, understand who you've become.. You're the fire in the rain, only greatness will remain,. Push up, yes I raise the bar, don't be afraid of who you are,. [Wretch 32:]. Tell me if you're with me,. I said I'm traveling at wind speed, ye-e-eah,. Tell me if you're with me, yea. Because I'm traveling at wind speed, ye-eah."

forgiveness (feat. etta bond),"Feel like I'm slackin' with my children. Focusing on rap tryna pack and shake the building. In a race with my own race, just to raise the roof. And I ain't talking 'bout the ceiling. Here's something to believe in:. No sleep 'cause you're livin' what you're dreamin'. And it's the lesson in itself. How* my son can call me dad when I miss the parents evenings. Amazed that I'm still breathin';. Every other shot I feel my insides bleedin'.. Grandad, turnin' in his grave,. Cause I promised that I'll be there for my gran when she's grievin'. I used to be a man of my word;. Now, time seems to have got the best of my sentence. In that case I'll have to adjourn,. Cause the thought of an excuse is just as bad as the intention. (Hook). Excuse me, my friend. I think I might've hit my head. Excuse me, my friend. I don't remember who I am. Cause I'm holdin' on tryna be somebody. But it won't be long before I need somebody. Forgiveness, asking for forgiveness (hey, hey, hey, hey) [x4]. . Went to church to pray for a top ten. Then I went number 5, I ain't been back again. But when my jewellery friend phones. Like they got new rings I'll most likely attend. Hoppin' out a new benz, start the car from outside. When is this gonna end?. Cah mum's still livin' in the endz ..spend jibbs on the wrist. before I put her with celebs. I'm still livin' like a wretch all I hear is fuck fuck. All the girls got turrets. And no I don't wanna bet even the odd birds. Wanna take me to the nest. I swear I only came for the music, but the more I touch notes,. It's like the more I get stupid. It's a gift than a curse, but before I blame myself,. Imma say it's what the tunes did. (Hook). Excuse me, my friend. I think I might've hit my head. Excuse me, my friend. I don't remember who I am. Cause I'm holdin' on tryna be somebody. But it won't be long before I need somebody. Forgiveness, asking for forgiveness (hey, hey, hey, hey) [x4]"

i'm not the man (feat. chipmunk & angel),"[Wretch 32:]. I been a wretch from about 3 or 2. Cruisin on the tele it was on channel 2. My dad was in the riots so they came to seize you. Growing up I was a kid that everybody knew. More me, its like I'm never in the mood. A true pisces my emotions in my tunes. Its an understatement to say its over with me and you. I took a few shots but I'm soldiering it through. And now I'm looking at my boys turned men. Thinkin lord god we coulda been like them. Cuz we aint the type to fear our opponents. The road door closed when my career pass opened. Its like I'm drinking more than I'm thinking. Celebrating as I'm crossing off my wish list. I'm sleeping with both eyes open. I'm living my dream man, I dont wanna miss this. [Angel:]. I'm not the man you thought I should be. That's just the way we drop them jeans where I stay. I'm not the man you thought I should be. Just take a second get to know me. [Wretch 32:]. It takes a second just to look me in my eyes. It takes an hour just to listen to my life. It took me years just to push me to this hype. But it take a lifetime to try and duplicate my vibe I'm me. Smooth with my scratches and scars I'm free. 2 minute stamp on the charts. And I'm sending a letter, I hope you receive it. Hand on my heart Imma flow while its beating. To put it in words, it coulda been worse. From the undergrounds I coulda been dirt. I took a right turn at a wrong place. Cuz sometimes shortcuts are the long way. Gotta have strong faith. Now I'm pleading with my baby mamma. She tryin to tell me that I turned into a lady lover. Huh, I got my eye on the prize and. I'm bringing home the bread. Lets make a toast, you can save the butter. [Angel:]. I'm not the man you thought I should be. That's just the way we drop them jeans where I stay. I'm not the man you thought I should be. Just take a second get to know me. I'm not the man you thought I should be. That's just the way we drop them jeans where I stay. I'm not the man you thought I should be. Just take a second get to know me. [Chipmunk:]. Hey yo wretch. Let me get this from here, yeah. Last month a 14 year old in my hood got stabbed and died. I used to cruise on my bike down that same. side road that he lost his life. I fill a cup with tears and kick it back l. ike a shot just to swallow my pride. Niggas would eat from your bowl. and you keep down like a pin coulda hold a strike. You dont know what its like. Getting cheese amongst a rats fam. From a town where robin could rob batman. Taxman underneath the taxman giving me that tax man. I'd rather die from death man. And everything aint what it seems on these shelves. You parting red seas and A&R in ourselves. And you can still get a deal and get shelved. Getting signed wont necessarily help. All this fire in my tank. I've come too far to get shanked. I'm walking on water that others sank. And I'm laughing all the way to the bank. Power of the grime, lord on my side. Test me, I can make a preacher man grimes. From a council estate but yeah we made it. Best things can come from the worse places. [Angel:]. I'm not the man you thought I should be. That's just the way we drop them jeans where I stay. I'm not the man you thought I should be. Just take a second get to know me. I'm not the man you thought I should be. That's just the way we drop them jeans where I stay. I'm not the man you thought I should be.

ina di ghetto,"Where straps are seen more than dads. Cause they clap at these boring actors. Cause everyone's big with hard weight. Now everyone thinks they're scarface. It gets fizzy when their plans evolve. And they end up in the can for coke. I hope you're 7-up (i-i-ina di ghetto). Where we wish for better luck (huh). But we still see black cats. We get cheese cause we're lab rats (woah). So then we reproduce. And we grind just to feed our yutes. Gettin' by's like squeezin' through. That's the cycle of me and you. We're designed to lose (i-i-ina di ghetto). Where the yutes get high off an 8th. Ride for their name. And love to die for their chain. Just cause he swore on his cross. That if he gets popped then the war's kickin' off. And we'll take it to them. Now that's what i call the chain of events. You break out the chain they're takin' your breath (i-i-ina di ghetto).

let yourself go,"I used to see him every day. I used to rate this guy. Didn't know that they made chains that size. Had my whole house on a neighbors vibe. Lookin' out the window he's on a flagrant hype. First guy I saw with the butterfly baura, cut-a-guy aura. Had my mum sayin' you ain't touching my daughter. Way too bad breed half the youths. On road, claimed they were family. They got out the beef if you said he's name. First guy rollin' when fiesta's came. Offkey diss, capsule of that, champagne. Sipping with expensive taste!. Wait I'm talking back in the days when. You'll have a tiny little part in your fade when. It weren't bb pins it was paging. He had sticks and stones like the cavemen. Yeah, man I swear he was a braveheart. He weren't really playin' games in the sega park. No couple'o names tryna save their arse. Cause it put their mind at ease when they made him laugh. Yeah he had the world on his back. And had the ends in his palms. Yeah he was the last man standing. Yeah because his friends didn't last. Uh man I swear he had a legacy. Yeah, street name straight legendary. Yeah, and now he's sitting in jail telling. This same story like, I wonder if they remember me. How could he be that person my life's cold. When everybody saw you as a king. And then you get dethroned. Cause I don't wanna be that person. Like man she was cold. Cause everyone saw her as a queen. And then she gets dethroned. I used to see her everyday, young youth begging for a hug. With that cute smile I could never get enough. You'll only get a word if you're relevent enough. The type of angel causing hell up on the bus. Couldn't let her pass you had to chit-chat with her. Probably try and share your lickle kit-kat with her. Spending hours on the house phone. God knows you nearly got kicked out fi' her!. I'm like isn't it a shame. The only girl popping off the mrs single wave. The primary school queen secondary's dream. Legendary team the picture's in the frame. Cause you went to the dance just to draw her. And if you locked off the dance it was for her. Might of heard 'couple man fall out and two two's it was for her. So the looks started getting to her head. Every man's talking trying to get into her bed. And then she laid down with one too many. And the mad ting is not one of them's an ex. And when she was looking for a someone. Yeah it was preferably a someone. She found him they were living their dream. And this one guy turned her friends and her loved ones. When I saw her she didn't look right. But who am I to tell her that she didn't look nice. Now picture she with her man on a prison v. He's asking her ""do the roads still remember me? "". How could he be that person my life's cold. When everybody saw you as a king. And then you get dethroned. Cause I don't wanna be that person. Like man she was cold. Cause everyone saw her as a queen. And then she gets dethroned"
long way home,"Rolling through london, I been cruising a while. I see a man in a fued with his girl. About losing his child, she was crying. Him river I guess she in denile. And the car ain't tinted, and this. Ain't none of our business. So we ain't trying to stare too long, me. And the driver looked like neither of us listening. And not one of us listening, we probably. Both had a row with our sisterin. While the whole street witnessed. Just gotta turn a blind eye and no winking. We still rolling, we shoulda took the other way. I'm still moaning. I shoulda kept that myself, still told him. So now he's going all the way, real sulkish. Clubs are closed, I'm gettin mad. Like would you take a look at these lads. Trying to stop a cab like they can't see man. Alcohol is got em feeling like they can't be stabbed. And one of them's vomiting kebab and. The other is hoppin on his back. And his girl tryin to pick him up, that's. The one time that she gotta be the man. Taking the long way home again. Watching the world drive in the rain. There's motion but there's no change. It's the same old, same old race till it's over yeah. Rolling through london, where we slipped on a junction. I don't wanna see anymore drunkerds. And I'm talking to myself cause I wanna. Conversation with a little more substance. And it's alright, it's in the brain. And what a surprise it's gonna rain. And we speed past the homeless. And still act like we not got enough change. I guess summats gotta change, traffic light he stuntin in a range. Imagine I'm sat lusting at the paint. While the prostitute screamed that she never got paid. Cause she thinks that she never got raped. Still got the mind of a child. That only happens when you never get raised. Trapped in a cycle that you can never escape (woahh). And this shit used to burn me (burn me yeah). And that's why it's part of my verse b. Sitting in a back of a cab, guess. This is part of my journey (part of life). Cause this shit used to burn me (oh yeah). Ant that's why it's part of my verse b (ba ba ba la la). Sitting in the back if a cab, guess. This is part of my journey (oh oh oh woah). Taking the long way home again. Watching the world drive in the rain. There's motion but there's no change. It's the same old, same old race till it's over yeah. And these things used to burn me. But now they just part of my journey. And these things used to burn me. But now they just part of my journey. And these things used to burn me. But now they just part of my journey. And these things used to burn me. But now they just part of my journey (oh oh oh woah). Taking the long way home again. Watching the world drive in the rain. There's motion but there's no change. It's the same old, same old race till it's over yeah. Taking the long way home again. Because there's no way home from here. So much for cycle, I'll start making. My own way back when it's over, over, over. I'm making my own way"
never be me,"[Intro]. That coulda never been me. Cah I forever been me. Hittin' on another team. That coulda never been me. Cah I forever been me. Not livin' out my dreams. That coulda never been me. Cah I forever been me. Hittin' on another team. That coulda never been me. C'mon and get to know me. [Verse 1]. Look, at the age of fourteen, I felt the pressure on me. That's why I never did sleep, that I never had dreams. I was forever on the street, I had a pair o' off-keys. An' a top of Dolce, an' had a pair of cold sneaks. That help me run from police. Cah my mother's so deep, she woulda sent me O.T.. Because she never got pees she was ever so pleased. When I got my own keys, at sixteen so sweet. Even tried to sell weed, but couldn't get a whole key. I had to let it go peek, didn't get to know pees. Until I got to eighteen, but still I never Od'd. Cah my foot was in the scene, I had to make it concrete. And now I feed my whole team. [Chorus]. They can't believe the one they doubted. Is taking the house tonight. When I didn't even try. Ain't that what. You screamed and shouted. Cause I've made you change your mind. And I didn't even try. You love it. How he does it. [repeated with adlibs]. [Verse 2]. An' I ain't never been tight, I'm like drinks on me. An' I can do that all night, cah I got my shit right. I never blink or sleep, cah my dream's my life. So the limit's my sky, until into the ground I dive. But a legend don't die so why the hell should I. I've got heaven on side, my little boy soon stride. When he gets his own stripes, I get him sponsored by Nike. It's real talk no hype, cah his daddy's been fly. I been cool no ice, I don't stunt I style. It ain't all about price, unless you get it on swipe. I pay cash no dice, so everything nice. Becah a rider got drive, I get head no lice. [Chorus]. They can't believe the one they doubted. Is taking the house tonight. When I didn't even try. Ain't that what. You screamed and shouted. Cause I've made you change your mind. And I didn't even try. You love it. How he does it.

And now I'm riding solo. You only end up in a frame when you take a photo. I say my stunners got me feeling stone cold. Now I feel to hop the bar like I got a pole-vault. And now I'm drinking away my fears. I guess everything became so clear. I'm saying it's a new beginning and I'm hooked on loose women. So you just name the place I'm there.

someone like you,"Nevermind, I'll find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you. Flickin' through the pictures. I can see you chilling with my sisters. And I can see me in the background. Talking on the phone, probably to another mistress. I guess I prove everybody right. But this ain't everybody's life. I bet nobody's hurtin' like I. Cause the heartache meant to break. And we wasn't meant to divide. So I'm never supposed to be lying. We're fighting for this love. And we're never suppose to be dying. The topic of discussion. I'm never home and you're crying. You're crying me a river. I'm bit and so I just dive in. Lyrical arguments. Feels like we're in the house of parliament. But I ain't trying to play the prime minister. Turn the whole country against me, I can't pretend. That I don't need nobody. (You don't need nobody). But I don't need no worries. (You don't need no worries). So I left when you told me you're pregnant. (Told you I was pregnant). Heartless, not even your screams could stop me. Free. Nevermind, I'll find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you two. Don't forget me, I beg. I remember you said. Sometimes it lasts in love. But sometimes it hurts instead. Sometimes it lasts in love. But sometimes it hurts instead. Oh yeah, I. Phone you last week. You answered your phone and didn't speak. And I could hear your boyfriend in the background saying. Who's that? I wish he would've ask me. I see your true colors shining through. You've moved on, I guess I'm nothin' like you. Or am I stupid to assume that there's a cupid. And I'm hoping if he shoots, he finds me someone like you. I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited. But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I'd hoped you'd see my face. And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over. Nevermind, I'll find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you, too. Don't forget me, I beg. I remember you said. Sometimes it lasts in love. But sometimes it hurts instead. Sometimes it lasts in love. But sometimes it hurts instead"

unorthodox,"[Wretch 32 - Verse 1]. Yea, I got a good heart. I was born on beat that's a good start. I had a feeling I pushed past. And now I feel like I'm the reason I should last. And I move like my shit don't sink. But I'm all in a trance no hit no assist. This is all from the heart intro no script. I'm just about writing it down. So now I don't sleep man I miss those nights. I take planes like trains I don't miss no flights. I'm the type of guy that will have no life. Just so I can shine like this gold life. And that sounds sad but I'm happy. And the only plans to stay scatty. Yea unorthodox, I made the bar so I call the shots. [Chorus - Example]. We don't follow no crowd, they follow us. Don't follow no sound it follows us. Go sit in hell, look down that wishing well. Unorthodox, we call our own shots. [Wretch 32 - Verse 2]. Yea I got a good vibe. I ain't trynna be bait with my hook lines. I had a feeling I could fly. Before I hopped on a plane or a new sky. Yea I'm a good guy. And if you heard otherwise it's a true lie. I'm hype I don't do shy. I bark up every tree and I do bite. Syke I'm only playing. We all got freedom of speech I'm only saying. I ain't got time for beef I'm on the way in. So the 8th day of the weeks my own lay in. And that's sounds said but I'm happy. But the only plans to stay scatty. Yea unorthodox, I made the bar so I take the shots. [Chorus]. We don't follow no crowd, they follow us. Don't follow no sound it follows us. Go sit in hell look down that wishing well. Unorthodox we call our own shots. No one can hold us down again. No one will touch our crown again. No one can hold us down again. No one will touch our crown again. [Chorus x2]. We don't follow no crowd, they follow us. Don't follow no sound it follows us. Go sit in hell, look down that wishing well. Unorthodox, we call our own shots"
