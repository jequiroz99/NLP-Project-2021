all falls down (feat. syleena johnson),"[Chorus. Oh when it all, it all falls down. I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down. [Verse - Kanye West]. Man I promise, she's so self conscious. She has no idea what she's doing in college. That major that she majored in don't make no money. But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny. Now, tell me that ain't insecurre. The concept of school seems so securre. Sophmore three yearrs aint picked a careerr. She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair. Cause that's enough money. to buy her a few pairs of new Airs. Cause her baby daddy don't really care. She's so precious with the peer pressure. Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus. (a Lexus). She had hair so long that it looked like weave. Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve. And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe. Single black female addicted to retail and well. [Chorus - repeat (w Kanye ad-libs) ]. Oh when it all, it all falls down. I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down. [Verse - Kanye West]. Man I promise, I'm so self conscious. That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches. Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy. I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!. Then I spent 400 bucks on this. Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!. And I can't even go to the grocery store. Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team. It seems we living the american dream. But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem. The prettiest people do the ugliest things. For the road to riches and diamond rings. We shine because they hate us. floss cause they degrade us. We trying to buy back our 40 acres. And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop. Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop coupe. [Chorus - repeat (w Kanye ad-libs) ]. Oh when it all, it all falls down. I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down. [Verse - Kanye West]. I say fuck the police, thats how I treat em. We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom. We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em. Things we buy to cover up what's inside. Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth. That's why shortys hollering where the ballas' at?. Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack. And a white man get paid off of all of that. But I ain't even gon act holier than thou. Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou. Before I had a house and I'd do it again. Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz. I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific. I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific. I got a problem with spending before I get it. We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it. [Chorus - to fade (w Kanye ad-libs) ]. Oh when it all, it all falls down. I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down"
power (feat. dwele),"I'm livin' in the 21st century. Doin' something mean to it. Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it. Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it. I guess every superhero need his own theme music. No one man should have all that power. The clock's tickin', I just count the hours. Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power. (21st century schizoid man). The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons. open. We ain't got nothin' to lose, ma'fucka, we rollin'. Huh? Ma'fucka, we rollin'. With some light skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands. In this white man world, we the ones chosen. So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'. Huh? I see you in the mornin'. This is way too much, I need a moment. No one man should have all that power. The clock's tickin', I just count the hours. Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power.

last call,"[Intro: Jay-Z (Kanye)]. [laughing]. Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost. For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker. Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room. 'Cause they don't fucking... (I'd like to propose a toast). (I said toast motherfucker). [Chorus: Kanye]. And I am. And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them. Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky. This is the last call for alcohol, for the... So get your ass up off the wall. [Verse 1]. The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac. The Rudloph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc. I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame. And come back next year with the whole fucking game. Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top. They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop. Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself. Rocafella's only niggaz that help. My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair. Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here. They say he bourgie, he big-headed. Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is. Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds. I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas. It's funny how wasn't nobody interested. 'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir. Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir. Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest. But all they got left is this guy called West. Better take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def. Call him Kwa-lI or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z. I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh. It come out sweeter than old Sadie. Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards. Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards. And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye. I'm almost reignin'. Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?. It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him. Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine. Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme. Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem. Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams. I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed. But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh. So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more. You niggaz wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more. You can't say shit to Kanye West no more. I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga. I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don. Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom. I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards. I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars. I went to the malls and I balled too hard. 'Oh my god, is that a black card?'. I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term. African American Express. Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell. Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to. Killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips. [Chorus]. ""... last call for alcohol, for my niggaz"". [Outro]. So this A&R over at Rocafella, named Hiphop. picked the Truth beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin?"". I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay."". Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone. going back and forth, just askin me to send him beats. And I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers. cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with. And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""look man, you wanna mess with Kanye. you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"". [No ID:] ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap"". I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not. but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer. [Hiphop:] ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper"",. I'm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the Ghost production. But that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know. After they picked that Truth beat. I was figuring I was gonna do some more work. But shit just went poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago. I had my own apartment. I be doin' like, just beats for local acts. just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy. get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something. or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then. I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample. I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like ""oh, yo that shit is crazy. Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty."". And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me. so I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. and really I just, like picked the drums off Xxplosive and put it like. with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style. when it started, when he rapped on 'This Can't be Life.'. And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album. I could say that was the, the resurgence of this whole sound. You know, I got to come in and track the beat, and at the time. I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with. Hiphop. 'Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm. sayin, 'cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they did. for me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he. gotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. And that day I. came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, ""oh. you a real soulful dude"" [Jay-Z: ""you a real soulful dude""]. And he. uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got. to the studio, you know how he do it, one take. And he said. [Jay-Z:] ""check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"". ""tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking. like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z, I ain't. want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the, in my. personal opinion. So he asked me, ""what you think of it?"". [Jay-Z:] ""so what you thinkin?"". And I was like, ""man that shit tite,"". you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train. man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just. in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got. acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like. poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that was one. of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through. my production company, but he ended up going straight with the. company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad. news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at. the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took. that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about. ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to deal. with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to. [Mother:] ""Come on, let's just go"". Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment.. I remember I pulled up. [Mother:] ""Kanye, baby, we're here"",. I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a. bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and. the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.'. And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up. there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I. played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the zone. he already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like already at. that time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a GuccI bucket. hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said. ""yo play that one beat for him."" And I played 'Heart of the City.' And. really I made 'Heart of the City,' I really wanted to give that beat to DMX.. [Hiphop:] ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here"".. And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that. GuccI bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of. them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen. Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like ""yo what's up I'm Kanye."". [Dame:] ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"". ""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?. Yo, this nigga got classics"". [Dame:] ""Jay got classics, G."". You know I ain't talkin shit.. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm. still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggaz on the show. The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my. eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all. these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one. thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be. Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton. sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Tata, John. Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the. time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I. spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical. shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his. eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the rap. was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response.. He said ""man that was tite."". [Jay-Z:] ""That, that was cool. That was hot."". That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe.. Okay, fast forward.. So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just. took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship. with KwelI I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my. career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me. to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at. this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had. relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so. they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound. like Jay-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them. these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll. be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy. 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they. didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked. with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the. company that'll say ""naw."" Like, Dave LottI fucked with me, my. nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man. [Jessica:] ""Man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."". I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up. ""Y'all niggaz is stupid"". Let's just say I didn't get my deal.. The nigga that was behind me, I mean,. he wasn't even a nigga, you know?. The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol. Records. He wanted to sign me really bad.. [Joe:] ""We gonna change the game, buddy."". Dame was like, ""yo you got a deal with Capitol,. okay man, just make sure it's not wack."". [Dame:] ""you gotta make sure it's not wack."". Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to. play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and. Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll. never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'. ""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow. I got eleven plaques on my walls right now. You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."". Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So. I play that song for him, and he's like ""oh shit"". [Dame:] ""Oh shit it's not even wack."". ""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."". [Dame:] ""it's actually kinda hot."". Like they still weren't looking at me. like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole. album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and. save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's. like ""yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick"". [Dame:] ""you don't wanna catch a brick"". You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.. I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with. that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was. already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you. know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I. was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm. not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer. rapper"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right--. the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio. sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes. man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said. ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal"". [Mel:] ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."". And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested. and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying. to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I. called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Rocafella?"""

You are about to experience something cold man. We never had nothing handed took nothing for granted. Took nothing from no man, man i'm my own man. But as a shorty i looked up to the dopeman.

And everybody selling make-up, Jacobs. And bootleg tapes just to get they cake up. We put shit on layaway then come back. We claim other kids on our income tax. We take that money cop work than push packs to get paid. And we don't care what people say. Momma say she wanna move south. Scratchin lottery tickets Eyes on a new house. Around the same time Doe ran up in dudes house. Couldnt get a job. So since he couldnt get work he figured hed take work. The drug game bolemic its hard to get weight. So niggas money is homo its hard to get straight. So we gon keep baking to the day we get cake.. And we dont care what people say. My Niggas. [Chorus]. [Kanye West and Kids:].

And they DCFS them some of them dislecsic. They favorite 50 Cent song's 12 Questions. We scream, rock, blows, weed park. so now we smart. We aint retards the way teachers taught. Hold up hold fast we make mo'cash. Now tell my momma i belong in the slow class. It's bad enough we on welfare. You trying to put me on the school bus with the space for the wheel chair. Im trying to get the car with the chromy wheels here. You tryin to cut our lights like we dont live here. Look at whats handed us our fatheres abandoned us. When we get the hammers gone and call the ambulance. Sometimes i feel no one in this world understands us. But we dont care what people say. My Niggas. [Chorus].

i thought about killing you,"I know, I know, I know, I know, know. I know, I know, I know, I know, know. I, I know it, I know it. The most beautiful thoughts. Are always besides the darkest. Today, I seriously thought about killing you. I contemplated, premeditated murder. And I think about killing myself. And I love myself. Way more than I love you, so. Today, I thought about killing you. Premeditated murder. You'd only care enough. To kill somebody you love. The most beautiful thoughts. Are always inside the darkest. (mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhmm). Just say it out loud to see how it feels. People say, ""don't say this, don't say that"". Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels. Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table. Today I thought about killing you. Premeditated murder. I think about killing myself. And I, I love myself way more than I love you. The most beautiful thoughts. Are always besides the darkest. (mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhmm). I think this is the part. Where I'm supposed to say somethin' good. To compensate it so it doesn't come off bad. But sometimes I think really bad things. Really, really, really bad things. And I love myself way more than I love you. See, if I was tryin'. To relate it to more people. I'd probably say. I'm struggling with loving myself. Because that seems like a common theme. But that's not the case here. I love myself way more than I love you. And I think about killing myself. So, best believe. I thought about killing you today. Premeditated murder. I called up my loved ones. I called up my cousins. I called up the muslims. Said I'm 'bout to go dumb. Get so bright, it's no sun. Get so loud, I hear none. Screamed so loud, got no lungs. Hurt so bad, I go numb. Time to bring in the drums. That prrt-pu-pu-pum. Set the newtone on 'em. Set the nuke off on 'em. I need coke with no rum. I taste coke on her tongue. I don't joke with no one. They'll say he die so young. I done had a bad case of too many bad days. Got too many bad traits. Used the floor for ashtrays. I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache. I'ma make my name last. Put that on my last name. It's a different type of rules that we obey. Ye, ye, ye season, nigga, we old bay. We was all born to die, nigga doa. Niggas say they hero, mhm, I don't see no cape. Mhm, I don't see no, mhm, yeah. I don't see no, mhm, mhm. If I wasn't shinin' so hard. Wouldn't be no shade. Buckwheat ass nigga, it's 'gon be otay. Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age. I thought I was past my deebo ways. Even when I went broke, I ain't break. How you gon' hate? nigga, we go way back. To when I had the braids. And you had the wave cap. Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way asap. Don't get socked in the mouth. You know homie don't play that. Pay the fire marshal bill. 'cause this shit done got way packed. They wanna see me go ape (ape, ape). All you gotta do is speak on ye. All you gotta do is speak on ye. Don't get your tooth chipped like frito-lay"
never let me down,"When it comes to being true, at least true to me. One thing I found, one thing I found. Oh no you never let me down. Get up, I get.... Get up, I get.... Get up, I get.... Get up, I get.... Get up, I get.... Get up, I get down. [Jay-Z]. Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts. First I had they ear, now I have their heart. Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start. I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart. Seen the rovers roll up wit ribbons. I seen them re-po'd, re-sold then re-driven. So when I reload, he holds #1 position. When you hot I'm hot. And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin. It's plain to see, niggaz can't fuck with me. Cuz I'm a be that nigga for life. This is not an image, this is God given. This is hard livin, mixed with crystall sippin. It's the most consistent, Hov. Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and. Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggaz visitin. It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap. I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy. [Chorus overlapping last four lines]. [Kanye West]. I get down for my grandfather who took my momma. Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat. At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in. And with that in my blood I was born to be different. Now niggaz can't make it to ballads to choose leadership. But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership. Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin it. Racisms still alive, they just be concealin it. But I know they don't want me in the damn club. They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club. I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed. Swear I've been baptized each 3 or 4 times. But in the land where niggaz praise Yukons and getting paid. Its gon take a lot more than coupons to get us saved. Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves. Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away. So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter. And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up. And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her. You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up. But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye. Cuz look what an accident did to Left Eye. First Aaliyah now romeo must die?. I know I got angels watchin me from the other side. [Chorus]. [J.Ivy]. We are all here for a reason on a particular path. You don't need a curriculum to know that you're apart of the math. Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious. That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world. I'm tryna make it better for these little boys and girls. I'm not just another individual. My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual. But I get my hymns from him. So it's not me it's he that's lyrical. I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument. My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes. For your soul and your mental. That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into. Yeah I need my loot by rent day. But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte. I'm tryna give us us free like Sinke. I can't stop, that's why I'm hot. Determination, dedication, motivation. I'm talking to you of my many inspirations. When I say I can't let you or self down. If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff. And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life. In my grip I would never ever let you down. And when these words are found. Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed. With a language called love. That's why my breath is felt by the death. And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind. I too dream in color and in rhyme. So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house. Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth. A touch of god reigns out. [Chorus]. [Jay-Z]. Who else you know been hot this long. Started from nothing but he got this strong. Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you. Peddled bikes, got my nephews peddle bikes because they special. Let you tell it man I'm fallin well. Somebody must have caught hi'm cuz. Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan em. Number one albums what I got, like four of em. More of them on the way, the 8th wonder on the way. Clear the way, I'm here to stay. Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that. This is Jay, dissin Jay will get you Mase'd. When I start spittin them lyrics niggaz get very religious. Six hail mary's please father forgive us. Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggaz. They way y'all all follow Jigga. Hov's a livin legend and I'll tell you why. Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive"

How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead. I'm here to resurrect me, mosh is to sexy to even make songs like these. That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys. To many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is populer. Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin her. Album, how come, you the hot garbager. The years clear your image and snooped up. Label got you souped up, tellin you you sick. Man you a dick with a loose nut. Video hard to watch like Medusa. Even your club record need a booster.

And I'mma pull up in the Bentley all white. Step up in the club with nothing but all dykes. Sippin' on some Louis and partyin' all night. Phony-ass people, I don't feel they demeanor. So I hop in the rocket and go and chill over Venus. One of rap's heroes, who came from zero. Makin' something out of nothing, call me Gilbert Arenas. Now I'm fuckin' with divas that rock the stadiums. Blow my brains back 'til my face be numb. I am the shit. It don't make me numb. Rockin' wit a swagger like I got an eight-feet gun. And my flow be colossal cause I spit the impossible. Whether with rhythm no limit to what I can do. See through a prism when I conquer an obstacle. And always get money no matter how illogical.

And I drive so fast I blur the light post. They say Drive Slow, I say ""I know"". Then errrr, away I go. And the way I flew. In this year or two. I know this is what God put me here to do. But in this excitement. You just might miss. A shorty with a demo like ""Hey, you might like this"". And see. He. Remind me of me. Just a year ago. Now he. Tellin' me. I'm his her-ro-oh.

My shoulder I know he's been warning me. To stay out the clubs where the police and warrants be. Cause that will lead to prison where the inmates and wardens be.

Bitches be Cons, took a stripper named Diamond. If he gonna be conflicted no different than diamonds. And the Lord is the only one that he can confide in. So I don't know how you think that you could deny Him. I open up the Book and the message is clear. But I still be in the hood so the pressure is there. To grab at that fast money just to get out of Queens. To bag up the work that they give out to fiends. But that ain't gonna work if I say what I mean.

While im waitin on a dream that'll never come true. Oh you just goin' keep em like you never knew. My face turned to stone when I heard the news. Whats on the news?. Channel cruise..."
banging up the block,"[Hook - 2x]. I'm still swanging in a drop. Slow Loud-Slow Loud, Bangin' up the block. Either way it go, I know I can't stop. Cause I gotta let em know, where I come from (H-Town). [Lil B]. Representer from Hiram-Clarke, your body outlined in chalk. Cause a nigga will get to tussling and rushing, like Marshall Faulk. You haters don't wanna see a nigga, grind for a minute. Recline for a minute, that's why I'm finna shine for a minute. We rhyme for a minute, but I'm still Lil B from the block. Swanging my do's wide open, making you niggaz mouth drop. Tops drop on cops, but bops we wreck shop. S.L.A.B. wrecking your spot, boy this here won't stop. We some certified wreckers, on the track we molesters. Got the cheese like Chester, boys bet not test us. We gon glide like Clyde, North-East-West and Southside. It really don't matter, represent it with pride. [Trae]. Well it's the wood grain grabber, fo' do' glass skater. Tinted up like Darth Vader, when I slide pass haters. The only way you know is Trae, is when I'm stepping out gators. On 22's candy blue, and on a mission for paper. And I'm a cock-glock popper, and a Slow Loud rocker. Bitch-made nigga knocker, and a bop type stopper. With B and Jay at the spot, with them dots on stock. Looking like a helicopter, when I crawl down blocks. While my chrome be spinning, iced out when I'm grinning. I know I need to stop sinning, when I'm fucking with women. Cause I'm a G by nature, I get the game from my brother. I'm on the Belt burning rubber, born and raised in the gutter. [Jay'Ton]. I'm still swanging up in a drop, and steady running from cops. With golds across the top of my mouth, swanging the lot. While looking for yellow bops, you know it don't never stop. With trunks waving the block, with Reese and Lil' Pop. We some Down South playas, and flipping in Navigators. For niggaz that's talking down, we pop the trunk on the haters. I'm steady pumping for paper, from Houston on to the Caders. The only thing that I know, is to drop and slide on them skaters. [Hook - 2x]. [Pimp Skinny]. Steady acting bad, moving fast as I dash. It's this nigga named Pimp Skinny, stay up on the mash. Bleeding for the cash, with the drop and then I dash. All you bitch ass niggaz, gon feel for that. Gun clapper ass slapper, close the chapter. S.L.A.B. nigga ass waxer, underground punch will never be a factor. For the real track master, doing it like a G. Cause I'm a wicked flow master. [T-2]. I'm flipping with the S.L.A.B., give your boy dap. You say you my partna hicka-hicka damn, quit making me laugh. Cause you making me, stop my car. You'll be laying six feet, in a do' in the hearse. I'm putting in work, playboy I'm writing my own rhymes. Doing my shows in different places, buy my own shine. Chill and recline, got my life made. My platinum in my mouth, like it was cleaned with Cascade. Could it be, the ice in my mouth. I'm still-I'm still, T-2 from the block. Use to have a little, but I have a lot. Southside of H-Town, is where I came from (yes sir). [Hook - 2x]. [Kiotti]. Don't be fooled, by the rocks that I got. I'm still-I'm still, Kiotti with a glock. See me in a drop, pulling on your block. And I ride Sprewell, cause I guess I got tired of chops. In my throwback. Maybe brick 4 red Mustang, that's a jet car. You know me, young Kiotti. Baya-bay and I hang on the block, like clouds on gray days. When I pull through, it's like whoa. Niggaz see me coming, rims stop then go. Man I got a whole, lot of cash to blow. I mash hard, with them S.L.A.B. niggaz swanging down your 'Vard. [Maurice]. Crawling through the scene, Benz lime freaky green. Too big to be a machine, falling screens submarine. Swanging from coast to coast, I never brag never boast. On a Rolls Royce man, I'm eating scrambled eggs and toast. Hard top Testarosta, when I slide down 'Boule's. Double header watch me swinging my blades, chop like swarms. I'm wrecking mics for rewards, I'm cracking dats in the cars. 84's or vogues, I do the do like more. [Hook - 2x]"

"bet cypher 2010 (feat. big sean, pusha t, & common)","[Kanye West]. Uh, Good music, this our year. Backing drums by Dj Premier. Now let me count it down, who the fuck up in here?. Common, Don, Old G, battle rap, oh. Y'all niggas know you can't really fuck with that. Pusha T, the Clipse just made a classic. Good music together we too Jurassic, you stay plastic. Ramadan with the flow, guaranteed everybody fasting. Big Sean is a don. Cyhi Da Prynce. Why you so nervous dog stop being tense. If you ain't talking bout Rash we ain't got nothing in common. Fuck that and that's just common sense what the. [Pusha T]. Came in the game, 8 years prior. 8 years later, your mans on fire. My Book of Eli, to all my subscribers. Play the two doors, street car named desire. Came in Grindin', Ye' came throught the wire. But at the crossroads, Bone thugs inspired. 1st of the month, Trump to the buyers. Rent too paid on the coupe you been fired. Smooth criminal, no prior's. Man in the mirror, check no liar. Still like that butterfly like Mariah. Show me the money the black Jerry Mcguire. Tom Cruise on that couch if that money right. West Hollywood feels like a bunny night. With Good company and better jewelers. To the Good Life, we Good music. [Big Sean]. Man, I wake up to a wet dream. Every day's a Friday and every nights a sex scene. Every week is fashion week and every day I'm pressed clean. Detroit's Angel, I even got red wings. I'm headed to the ball, me and three prom queens. My life's prom night and guess who's the Prom King. They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King. Everybody know I'm coming soon like Lebron's ring. I'm Big L, Notorious, Big Pun, Shawn Carter, Sean Combs and Connery all in one. Whoever told you sky's the limit is looking dumb. Cause I'm 22 and I'm moonwalking on the sun. Oh thats your girl?. She feelin on my water right next to a couple boaters. And she tryna motor boat her and im coming from the w-w-westside of the Motor. You might find banana clips 'cause it's Guerilla warfare. Last year I was watching this from the couch and now I'm here. Thats to let you know what I'm about. Reaper black suit cuz my whole team's killin'. Had to keep setting trends cuz your whole team stealin'. Many tell me I'm the man I ain't made it yet. Tell me who the baddest, I'll see if I see them naked yet. Won't stop til I get that Mercedes 700 Clk and Mercedes ain't made it yet. [Cyhi Da Prince]. I'm Mr. Got Bread like Quizno's. Better known as Mj with the big nose. I swear your artist couldn't see me on his tip toes. Only on Tv I gotta take a quick pose. Let me stop I forgot this was a big show. If being dope made you broke I am piss poor. I'm big poppa plus I'm 2pacalypto. My mind is a weapon what I need to pop a clip for?. Huh, I'm doing this for hip hop. I'm coming after you, him and his spot!. Still tied to the streets like a fish knot. Ain't nothing fake, I'm not a Rolly with a tick tock. Atlanta repper in the home of the yankee. Rose wood suit on with the hanky. I got rich from the zones of the stanky. So everybody know my money long, lanky!. So I'm flexible stretching out my decimals. Switching up the flow got the crowd going testicles. Can't bleep it out cuz there wasn't nothing sexual. I'm blowing loud, somebody check the decibels. I'm impeccable they put me on the pedestal. And if you bite me, it's good for you like a vegetable. Shows by the several, schedule full of festivals. And if I ever do time than you know its federal. Uh, incredible, yeah. [Common]. F-f-f-fam fam fam I'ma monster too. You don't see I do things that the monsters do. The incomparable, remarkable, articles. About my audible technique, my technique. I recognize game like the Espy's. Cold to myself I say God Bless me the truth. So I speak live and directly. You, I will set free my mic is where my check be. Rah, I echo, I echo, I echo, the sounds of the ghetto, future of the retro. Prolly in the metro just so I can get dough. The name is Common but the frame is special. Leave requested from the years I've invested. Arrested, develop, addressed it, envelope. The body of the black party from Farley to Bob Marley. Go home or go hard, at home is life hardly. [Kanye West]. The plan was to drink till the pain over. What's worse, the pain or the hangover?. Fresh air rolling down the window. Too many urkels on your team thats why your Winslow. I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal. Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal. This game you could never win. Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again. Get away from me lonliness. Get away from me misery. Get away from me fake shit, I can't take the phoniness. Get away from me wack tracks. I can only make only hits. I'm an only child lost in the World. Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring. Feeling like hell rings. Bringing me back down. Checking my background. Its ironic whats happening. Imagine if I didn't have the ends. I would'nt have so many imaginary friends. I'm spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk. Wonder if God asked Mike how to moon walk. I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more. I stopped visitin around the time I was a sophomore. I guess everything I hate about me I see in him. And I ain't finna change, so we'll never agree again. Just a few things pouring out my soul. Rosewood we could see her with our eyes closed"
big boy's neighborhood,"[Verse 1]. I guess I get mad when you get boxed in. So mad, you wanna start boxin'. So mad, you gonna turn to Tyson. Slicin' and dicin'. Paparazzi, I'm like a Nazi to 'em. I'm not Bill Cosby to 'em. And I ain't Bing Crosby to 'em…. More like… to 'em. Aye yo, I've got to ruin. The image and the style that you're used to doin'. When people usually do music. I am a visionary, Christian soldier, don't confuse it. Before I lose it and have to prove it. This the way to prove it, this the way that we gon' do it. Time, we gotta move it to the future. Karma Sutra, any way that suit ya. Don't shoot… stop the violence, and it's been stopped. We stopped the violence in the hip-hop. We stopped the hatin' and the degradation. We 'bout to build like One Nation. Got off the phone with Benjamin Carson. Uh, that's the next president, arson. Burn it down, burn Hollwood, burn, like Ice Cube said. I'm the rudest…. A lot of people say that, 'cause they say ""'Ye, don't play that"". They be off that Grey Goose, I be off that 'Ye Juice. That's the way I stay loose. Confidence and esteem, American dream. My crib's spatial…. And my relationship is interracial. [Verse 2]. I don't know where to start…. I don't know where to start. Maybe the chart, maybe the heart. Maybe the flow… maybe the gold…. Where I was grown, what I grew up in. Well, you see, my mama divorced my daddy. And moved my family when I was 3. And in the cold…. Straight from Chicago where I go. And everybody know…. From my homie Don C, I be air. Aye, yo - like IBM. Or Apple, Steve Jobs of this. Yeah, I'm on my job with this. Aye, yo, it's very, very simple. You heard me on Jimmy Kimmel. I can do it every tempo. I'll use my temple. I wanna build a temple. I wanna build churches. That could be as big as The Adam's Family's, where Lurch is. Aye, yo, this is not a circus. The zoo is closed, motherfuckers. Aye, yo…. It ain't no cursin' in the verse which you know is not perfect. And now you know it's still worth it. I might short-circuit, I might just black out. Hit you with that ""BLOCKA! "". You know I'm the blocka…. Number One Chief Rocker, Number One Chief Rocker. Ain't nobody gon' stop him, ain't nobody gon' stop us. Because... God on my side. That's the way I ride. Jesus Christ…. Yeezus nice!. [Verse 3]. One time I had lost my faith. But I had to stay faithful and grateful. For the God I was given. The way that I was livin' or the life that I've been livin'. It didn't make a difference. See, when I was 30, I had 6 parents. Grandmother, grandfather, grandmother, grandfather. Mother, father, now I've only got one parent. Life could change in a blink, and that is apparent. But still you've got to stay strong. I don't know what everybody else is on. Sometimes I don't listen to music, I just need to zone out. Sometimes I don't listen to music, everybody clones now. And I doubt they even listen, and I ain't tryna diss 'em. But sometimes I be in music and feel like it's a prison. And everybody say bein' a rockstar is everything. But see, I wanna do everything. And I know I could do everything. And be anything that I wanna be. So simply, if you wanna be like Mike, I wanna be like Christ. You know what I'm saying?. Okay, this beat just threw me off…. Took it extra old-school. This ain't no freestyle beat - yo, yo, dude!"

Sibling rivalry, only i could see, it was the pride in me, that was drivin' me.. At the grammy's i said, i inspired me.. But my big brother who i always tried to be.. When i kicked the flow, it was like pick and roll',. Coz even if he gave me the ROC, it's give and go.. I guess being styled was more of a slam dunk,. And my **** was more like a finger roll, but i had them singles so,. And them hoe's at the show gonna' mingle yo, (laughs), ya'll know!. I told Jay i did a song with Coldplay,. Next thing i know, he got a song with coldplay.. Back of my mind, im like 'damn,no way',. Translate Espanyol, No way hose'!. Then i went and told Jay Brown,.

We've been generally warned, thats what the surgeon says. God talk to me now this is an emergency. And my nigga says I shouldn't let her worry me. I need to focus on the girls we gettin currently. But I've been thinking and it got me back to sinking it. This relationship, it even got me back to drinking now. This Hennessey, is gon be the death of me. And I always thought that you havin my child was our destiny. But I can't even vibe wit you sexually. Cause every time that I try you will question me. Say ""you fuckin them girls, disrespecting me?. You don't see how your lies are affecting me?. You don't see how our life was supposed to be?. And I never let a nigga get that close to me!. And you ain't cracked up to what you was supposed to be!. You always gone! You always be where them hoes would be!"". And it's the first time she ever spilled her soul to me!. I fucked up and I know it G. You're gonna be the death of me (I guess it's bittersweet poetry). I don't want you, but I need you. I love you, hate you at the very same time. [Hook] x2"

blame game,"(John Legend). Let's play the blame game, I love you more. Let's play the blame game for sure. Let's call out names, names, I hate you more. Let's call out names, names, for sure. I'll call you bitch for short. As a last resort and my first resort. You call me motherfucker for long. At the end of it, you know we both were wrong. But I love to play the blame game, I love you more. Let's play the blame game for sure. Let's call out names, names, I hate you more. Let's call out names, names, for sure. [Kanye West]. On a bathroom wall I wrote:. ""I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else"". I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck and I went and found somebody else. Fuck, arguing and I harvesting the feelings, yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self. Till about 2 a.m. and I call back and I hang up and I start to blame myself. Somebody help. [John Legend]. Let's play the blame game, I love you more. Let's play the blame game for sure. Let's call out names, names, I hate you more. Let's call out names, names, for sure. [Kanye West]. You weren't perfect but you made life worth it. Stick around, some real feelings might surface. Been a long time since I spoke to you. In a bathroom gripping you up, fucking and choking you. What the hell was I supposed to do?. I know you ain't getting in this type of dick from that local dude. And if you are, I hope you have a good time. Cause I definitely be having mine. And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional. Every time I hear about other nigga's stroking you. Lie and say I hit you, he sitting there, consoling you. Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?. You should be grateful, a nigga like me ever noticed you. Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you. 1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you. I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do. Even though I knew, he never told the truth. He was just go say whatever that you told him to. At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions. Chuck on dirt on each other like mud wrestlers. I heard he bought some coke with my money. That ain't right, girl. You getting blackmailed for that white girl. You always said: Yeezy, I ain't you're right girl. You'll probably find one of them ""I like art"" type girls. All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl. And I was satisfied being in love with a lie. Now, who to blame? You to blame, me to blame. For the pain and it poured everytime when it rained. [John Legend]. Let's play the blame game, I love you more. Let's play the blame game for sure. [Kanye West]. Things used to be, now they not. Anything but us is who we are. Disguising ourselves as secret lovers. We've become public enemies. We walk away like strangers in the street. Gone for eternity, we erased one another. So far from where we came. With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?. Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of el, o, vee, e. Hatred and attitude tear us entirely. Chloe Mitchell. [John Legend]. Let's play the blame game, I love you more. Let's play the blame game for sure. Let's call out names, names, I hate you more. Let's call out names, names, for sure. I can't love you this much [5x]. No, I can't love you this much. I can't love you this much [2x]. [Kanye West]. And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing. And when the phone called, it just rang and rang. You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back. And I heard the whole thing. I heard the whole thing (the whole thing [3x]). [Chris Rock]. Oh, my God!. Baby, you done took this shit to the another motherfucking level. Now, a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this. Goddamn, goddamn! Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?. -Yeezy taught me. You never used to talk dirty, but now yo-you're goddamn disgusting!. My, my God, wh-where, where did you learn that?. -Yeezy taught me. Look at you motherfucking but-ass naked. With them mothefuckin' Jimmy Choos on. Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?. -Yeezy taught me. Yo, you took your pussy game up a whole another level. This is some Cirque 'u Soleil pussy now! Shit. You done went all porno on a nigga, ok?. And I, I, I, I, I love it and I thank you, I thank you. My dick thanks you!. How'd you learn? How'd, how did you pussy game come up?. -Yeezy taught me. I was fucking parts of your pussy I never fucked before. I was in there like: oh, shit, I never been here before. I've never even seen this part of pussy town before. It's like you got this shit reupholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?. Who, who the fuck got your pussy all reupholstered?. -Yeezy reupholstered my pussy. You know what? I got to thank Yeezy. And when I see that nigga, I'ma thank him. I'ma buy that album, I'ma download that mothefucker. I'ma shoot a bootlegger!. That's how good I feel about this nigga. Oh! I still can't believe you got me this watch. This mothefucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!. Even with the bezel! This is the mothefucker I wanted. I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in The Source. I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source. That's right, that's right!. Yo, yo, babe, yo, yo, this is the best birthday ever!. Where you learnt to treat a nigga like this?. -Yeezy taught me. Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well!"
blood on the leaves,"[Intro: Nina Simone]. Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees. Blood on the leaves. [Verse 1]. I just wanna clear my mind now. It's been racin' since the summertime. And I'm holdin' down the summer now. And all I want is what I can't buy now. Cause I ain't got the money on me right now. And I told you to wait. Yeah I told you to wait. So I'mma need a little more time now. Cause I ain't got the money on me right now. And I thought you could wait. Yeah and I thought you could wait. These bitches surroundin' me. All want somethin' out me. Then they talk about me. Would be lost without me. We could've been somebody. Thought you'd be different 'bout it. Now I know you naughty. So let's get on with it. [Hook 1]. You could've been somebody. 'Stead you had to tell somebody. Let's take it back to the first party. When you tried your first molly. It came out of your body. It came out of your body. Running naked down the lobby. And you was screamin' that you love me. Before the limelight tore yah. Before the love life stole yah. Remember we were so young. When I would hold you. Before the glory. I know there ain't wrong with me. [Bridge]. Something strange is happening. [Hook 2]. You could've been somethin'. We could've ugh, we could've been somebody. Or was it all our first party. When we tried our first molly. And came out of our body. And came out of our body. [Verse 2]. Before they call lawyers. Before you tried to destroy us. How you gon' lie to the lawyers?. It's like I don't even know yah. I gotta bring it back to the 'Nolia. Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas. Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas. Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas. I ride with my niggas, I'll die for my. [Verse 3]. To all my second string bitches, trying to get a baby. Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy. I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z. He ain't with you, he with Beyonce, you need to stop actin' lazy. She Instagram herself like ""Bad bitch alert"". He Instagram his watch like ""Mad rich alert"". He only wanna see that ass in reverse. Two thousand dollar bag with no cash in your purse. Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side. Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid. Then she said she impregnated. That's the night your heart died. Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that. Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that. Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that. All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that. That going to that owing money that the court got. On and on that alimony. Yeah, yeah she got you homey. 'Til death but do your part. Unholy matrimony"
blow / funk flex freestyle,"[Pusha T]. Malice found religion, Tony found prison. I'm just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen. A birdseye view got me channelling my vision. Turn one to two now the kilo's got a sibling. Father knows best, wash my hands all is forgiven. We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors. Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors. Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue. Grants, Jacksons no room for George. Yeh, the Fear of God's in you muthafuckers. This art imitate my life. You Worldstarhiphop fame based off imitation hype. Eliminate the fools gold and imitation ice. My music for your soul, inspiration for your life. Every dime made in his life more disastrous. Help my new bitch see her way through her Bachelor's. Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters. Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters. The truth hurts everytime it's revealed. What goes around comes around, this is lifes ferris wheel. Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parrallel park. Kentucky derby on the grill. The fact that I'm free lets me know God is great. Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate. These rappers talk crowns but I'd rather talk fear. Villian like candyman, say my name and I'll appear. No weapon formed against me shall prosper. Hakuna matata, feet up sipping java. Strolling up the totem poll, what's my only problem. Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler. So many hands raised as the band plays. I'm here now, watch how many nigga's plans change. [Kanye West]. Penitentiary chances, the devil dances. And eventually answers to the call of Autumn. All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'. Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin. Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums. Based off the way we was branded. Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon. And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random. But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage. I need a happy ending and a new beginning. And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative. And sold your dreams, you don't know who did it. I treat the cash, the way the government treats aids. I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it. I need more drinks and more lights. Hot American Apparal girl in just tights. She told the director she tryna get in a school. Told to take them glasses off and get in the pool. It's been a while since I watched the tube. Its like a crip said: ""I got way too many blues for any more bad news"". I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today. They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday. What's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach. I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach. But God said I need a different approach. Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke. It ain't funny anymore try dipping jokes. Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o. Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I'm got it. Play strings for the dramatic. And end all of that wack shh. Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes. I ain't got it I'm going after whoever who has it. I'm coming after whoever who has it. You blowing up, that's good, fantastic. That y'all, its like that ya'll. I don't really give a fuck about it at all. Cause the same people that tried to black ball me. Forgot about 2 things, my black balls. [Pusha T]. Uh, I let you into my diary to admire me. The making of this man, I let you see the higher me. The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy. I'm drawing from both sides, I'm Siamese. The tug of war opens the door, entrada. Rip me apart and see what's inside this pinata. And rolling kilos in gym(?) is one saga. One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter. Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women whom. Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom. And blossom, I swear this Vegas nights was awesome. But adios I blow my own dice before I toss 'em, loss 'em. Some other muthafuckers double crossed 'em. Tryna snatch my nigga back I blew a small fortune. Russell with the work, we was like the four horsemen. Rick Flair with the flame, I'm muthfucking Gorgeous, wooooooooo. As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smtih. Whiter than the coke brush that they paint me with. Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss. But the devil red, tires double tread. I'm posting parks up. that gets me double head. Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head. The bright lights blind look what the devil did. Yeah. [Kanye West]. It's hip hop, this is euphemism for a new religion. The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing. This is more than just my road to redemption. Malcolm West had the whole nation standing to attention. As long as I'm in Polo's they think they got me. But they would try to crack me if they ever saw a black me. I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me. If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet. But this pimp is, on the top of mount Olympus. Ready for the Worl's game, this is my Olympics. We make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish. Choke a southpark writer with a fishstick. And I assisted to get up offa this dick. And these drugs, fans can't resist it. Remember, remind of when they tried to have Ali enlisted. If I ever one of the greatest homie, I must have missed it!"
blue note (feat. mos def),"[Kanye West]. It's like I wanna spit something written. But keep forgetting. So I guess it's from the heart from the start. Played my part. Seemed like I just wasn't reaching the charts. 5000 hours, rewritting Power. Over and over. Some nights sober, some nights gone off the Henny as usual. So unusual to be in this position. Everything I say everybody tryna diss 'em. Everybody playin him, truth be told. The last nigga ever let the truth be told. And oh Mos Def ran to my home. And said they gon have yo ass gone. Light jokes, you keep playin with them white folks. Can't even take the piss. They gon' test your urine. Cut all the sponsorship for the touring!. ""Where the Dark Fantasy tour at Ye?"". I dont know, ask, ask Hennesy (thats Coca-Cola). Say 'he ain't clean enough'. But rappers ain't mean enough?. Enough lashes like I ain't seen enough. On the real, this is like the neo-Emmitt Till. Whistling, get yo fuckin' ass killed. Lets keep this shit real!. Now who the realest. Everybody feel this. And everyday of my life, people try to tell me that I hate the whites. Cause I said what's right. I go to sleep and deal wit it every night. And wake up every morning. And walk to the liquor store or coffee store shop on the Mersa wats worser?. Its no verse that would reverse the-. In print or in cursive. They curse the name, or maybe call me Kane. Let's have a 'toast for the douche bags'. Black people wanna talk about me on blogs. Cause I like clothes like, 'look at this fag'. Thats what I have to deal wit real shit. Yall dont even understand, what it take to be a real man. A black man interested in art, speaking from the heart and playin' my part. All this illuminati talk, like my first hit single wasn't 'Jesus Walks'. For many years, these ain't rhymes these is muthaf-cking tears. They playin' wit niggas careers. Felt like I'm the only real nigga here. From my last breath. They kicked me out the awards and my nigga Diddy left. Then they even set Beyonce up to give the Award back. Didn't even know I afford that. And she rode the wave as I rode the slave. As I felt like a slave as they try to put my shit up in the grave. Nigga behave, nigga behave. Be the first ?. I bet ya no one else would ever say nuttin' and stay frontin'. And get up and just perform, Shit is enormous. Shout out to Steve Stout, you know what this shit 'bout. My whole family, now I'm scared of Grammy's. Cause everybody know that Dark Fantasy was the highest rated album in history. So I just avoided it, not to be exploited, not to be recorded. Cause I cannot afford it, I cannot afford more shit to be in more debt. Uh, it's too real for these niggas, you feel for these niggas. How I feel to be a black man, you say something wrong, nobody understand. Money, power, black, opinion, pick two, they would kill ya. [Mos Def]. No matter what goes on. They may not agree, they may not understand. But God got a plan, to put the mic in my hand. And his hand and that hand. And ideas, and all of theres. And the end, everybody up in here, in this atmosphere. So make it clear, live long and prosper. Much success, even if you wish me the opposite. To quote Nas, I stay on my job. Try to pray to keep my heart from going harm. And I ain't perfect, you know that from old me. My life is real even when I'm in the movies. I'm on the ave, I'm in the cave. I buried my Grandmother on Thursday, two weeks ago. My life is real, as it ever been. To all my friends and even foes. Each and every one of those, let em know. I shine a globe, even in the dark, stay smart. Stay sharp, as a harp played by a musician in this position. Feel blessed to make the whole World listen. And just glisten without even trying. Even when I die, I won't stay dead. And its straight off the head, and its straight out the lungs. Looking fly, fresh, old man, so young. And I'm straight from the slums. And never been above so the ba-bum-ba-bum-bum-pum-pum?. This thing ups, let us all give some. Number one yo, I'm number none, no comparision. And make the whole world aware of it. Brooklyn in the building we take care of it. Peace out to all the Sagittarius. And happy birthday Pisces and Aries too. And this go out to all area crew. And if you come from the seven-eighteen then you just like me. Say it over ?. From the present, and the past and the future and beyond. Me and Lupe and Kanye we play the song and get it on"
bonnie & clyde freestyle,"Look for me Young K. Took 2Pac beat and got paid. My favorite rapper is Makaveli, Nas and Jay-Z. Eminem, Mase, Biggie Smalls and me. Now if you was my girlfriend you don't need no guyfriend. He could get his head bust nigga ain't my friend. Why the hell you lying who the hell you trying. Who the hell you know that threw away his throwbacks. When they suggested they was made by Majestic. My answers cost three-hundred-fifty ya naw mean. Doesn't even have got her number we ain't on the same team. You got the hat the jacket shoelaces to match. I got the gat ratching new cases to catch. I got my business manager erasing my debt. I mean my credit was so pathetic I couldn't get a debit. I fill out for a car but shit they always debt it. My girl come over try to help me shine. How you gonna help me get a car your credit worser than mine. But everytime I get a check you be first up in line. Told you bout gold-diggin bitch it's worser than lying.

Shit that's how I knew you was my girlfriend. So I promise to never pick up smutts. In my Cadillac pick-up truck. They need to get they sit-ups up. They always be colder than you. A little richer a little thicker a litter older than you. Probably a little smarter so they can drop me some jewels. That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college. So you can be where they at two years from now. But for now bartender two beers for now. The second one is for my girlfriend. [Jay-Z] All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend. [B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend.

No styles just good times like they're so nuts. We always thought if we had dough we could do so much. Like you ain't got to save the roach we can finish the Dutch. Like we ain't have to go coach told you i'll be paid soon. We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room. We ain't got to go back to my room there's only one bedroom. That I call my lair. We was V.I.P. Very Imaginary Playaz. But you was my girlfriend yea yea yea you was my girlfriend. [Jay-Z] Holla, All I need in this world of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend. [B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend. That's Right (Kanye).

With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit. You don't like it - get off my (brand new) dick. [Verse: Kanye West]. They say your attitude determines your latitude. I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker. And still the motherfucker you love to hate. But can't - because you love what I make. Now ain't - that about a bitch. And I'ma talk shit until I'm out of hits. They don't want to turn they speakers up. they claim I ain't deep enough. All that talkin' I feed off of - keep it up. I'm relaxin' my feet is up - I'm leavin' you haters. Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to ""Heat"" it up. I state the stats to stunt - I don't need to front. I make history e'ry day - I don't need a month. The survey says - by the streets according. Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan. Was to the NBA when he was scorin'. Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and. [Hook: Kanye West]. I don't like it unless it's (brand new). You might see me in my (brand new) whip.

Damn - what you make them jeans rip for?. I guess she's lookin' for a brand new man who. Ain't always gotta sit down cause he can't stand you. Boo - this the brand new jam to dance to. While you givin' me ""Head"" like shampoo. come as you came. Skip the brand name - I won't brand you. What you do here'll stay here like Cancun. Besides your breasts is augmented - I like things authentic. Look at all my whips, they're all vintage. I got a loft with a view of the sea. See I take some more shit and make it new for me. Pimp it out like Xzibit to the (oomph) degree. Why spend and arm and a leg. we can kick it for free you see. [Hook: Rhymefest] x2. I don't like it unless it's (brand new).

"breath in, breath out","Artist: Kanye West. Song: Breathe in breathe out. [Hook: Ludacris]. Yeah, breathe in, breathe out. If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out. Push a big truck, pull ya keys out. Girls go wild and pull ya deez out. Breathe in, breathe out. Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out. If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E´s out. When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!"". [Verse 1: Kanye West]. Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap. I got to ´pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably). But is it cool to rap about gold. If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!). First nigga with a Benz and a backpack. Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack. Always said if I rapped I´d say somethin´ significant. But now I´m rappin´ ´bout money, hoes, and rims again. And it´s still about the Benjamins. Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms. Strippers named Cinnamon. More chips than Pentium. What´cha gon´ buy next? Whatever new trend it is. I´m tryin´ to spend my stacks. And I´m so broke I look back like ""Damn, was I on crack?"". I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?. What the hell was wrong with me dog?. Sing along with my y´all. [Hook: Ludacris]. Yeah, breathe in, breathe out. If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out. Push a big truck, pull ya keys out. Girls go wild and pull ya deez out. Breathe in, breathe out. Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out. If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E´s out. When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!"". [Verse 2: Kanye West]. Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick. I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick. Ladies tired of gettin´ ripped off by guys like this. And givin´ head is like a whale, using the toothpick´. Well, I´m in the club for a limited time. Act now and get some action for $free.99. Later on I might charge for ménage. Heard her man was the boss of the floss. But she still want to toss me the drawers. And it ain´t gon´ cost me because she my caddy. Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club. And I´m still actin´ calm than a mug. She asked ""Can you drive me and the hunnies to where my Altima was?"". While we drive she tellin´ me ´bout problems with her man. Baby I fully understand. Let me help you with a plan. While he trickin´ off, don´t get no rich nigga. Give ME some head, that´ll really piss hI´m off. [inhales]. [Hook: Ludacris]. Yeah, breathe in, breathe out. If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out. Push a big truck, pull ya keys out. Girls go wild and pull ya deez out. Breathe in, breathe out. Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out. If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E´s out. When I pull a piece out niggas like ""Peace out!"". [Verse 3: Kanye West]. I blow past low class niggas with no cash. In the fo´ dash six, bitch you can go ask. So when I go fast popo just laugh. Right until I run out of gas or ´til I go crash. Whatever comes first I´m prepared for the worst. Whatever comes second I´ll be there with my weapon. Pullin´ up in the Lexuses/´lexeses, one on both hand. So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous. Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin´ me messages. ""K I need a free hand mammogram. I got weed, drink, and a Handicam. All of which is legal in Amsterdam"". So say my name like Candyman. And I´ma come and fix you up like the handyman. But if you don´t need a fix, girl you gotta leave. You can´t take that all at one time ya gotta breathe. [Hook: Ludacris]. Yeah, breathe in, breathe out. If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out. Push a big truck, pull ya keys out. Girls go wild and pull ya deez out. Breathe in, breathe out. Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out. If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E´s out. When I pull a piece out niggas like ""Peace out!"". [""Can you say Chi city?"" scratched repeatedly]. . By Ned"

Hater niggaz marry hater bitches and have hater kids. But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive. 'Cause when I was barely livin, that's what kept me alive. Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time. Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind. And get some lee way on the he say she say. You girl don't like me, how long has she been gay. Spanish girls say ""No able ingle"". And everybody want to run to me for their SINGLE. It's funny how these wack niggaz need my help. Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself. Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself. Dog, If I was you, I'd kill myself. Made a mill myself, and I'm still myself. And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help. Ask me from the heart, y'all all frontin. Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel somethin. [Brandy]. Why you come here, I bet it only it was forget to get ya. What kind of dream we found, see I'm often at your cross way. forgetting it was that heaven let ya. They tried to bring me down.

can't tell me nothing,"La laa la wait till I get my money right. I had a dream I can buy my way to heaven. When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace. I told God I'd be back in a second. Man it's so hard not to act reckless. To whom much is given, much is tested. Get arrested, guess until he get the message. I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny. And what I do? Act more stupidly. Bought more jewelery, more Louis V. My momma couldn't get through to me. The drama, people suing me. I'm on TV talking like it's you and me. I'm just saying how I feel man. I ain't one of the cosbys i aint go to hillman. I guess the money should've changed him. I guess I should've forgot where I came from. (hook). La laa lala wait till I get my money right. La laa lala then u can't tell me nothing right. [Chorus]. Excuse me, are you saying something?. Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing. (x3). Let up the suicide doors. This is my life homey, you decide yours. I know that Jesus died for us. But I couldn't tell you who decide wars. So I parallel double parked that mother f***er. sideways. Old folks talking bout back in my day. But homey this is my day. Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?. You know I already graduated. And you can live through anything if magic made it. They say I talk with so much emphasis. OO They so Sen-Sa-Tive. Don't ever fix your lips like collagen. Say something you gon end up apologizing. Let me know if it's a problem man. Alright man, holla then. (hook). La laa lala wait till I get my money right. La laa lala then u can't tell me nothing right. [Chorus]. Excuse me, are you saying something?. Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing. (x3). Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash. Let that man get pass. You don't needa stop to get gas. If he can move through the rumors. he can drive off of fumes. How you move in a room full of no's?. How you stay faithful in a room full of h**s?. Must be the pharoahs, he in tune with his soul. So when he buried in a tomb full of gold. Treasure. What's you pleasure?. Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her. So if the devil wear Prada. Adam Eve wear Nada. I'm in between, but way more fresher. But way less effort, cause when you try hard. That's when you die hard. Ya homies looking like ""Why God? "". When they reminisce over you, my god"

And I don't know what he did for dough. But he'd sent me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and hey!. (Did you realize. That you are a champion?. Yeah right). I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib. Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live. E'r'thing I wanted man it seemed so serious. That's that shit. So if you gon' do it, do it just like this. (Did you realize. That you are a champion?. Yeah right). When it feel like livin's harder than dyin'. For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'.

They got the crop out keepin' kids in the school. I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do. If not for the pleasure, least for the principle. They got the CD then got to see me drop gems. Like I dropped out of P.E.. They used to feel invisible. Now they know they invincible. (Did you realize. That you are a champion?. Yeah right). This is the story of a champion. Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns. Stand up stand up! Here he comes. Tell me what it takes to be number one?. Tell me what it takes to be number one?. This is the story of a champion.

Nothin' to say, I tote them choppas like pool sticks. I wear pajamas to Ruth's Chris. Couldn't walk a mile in my new kicks. I'm comin' from the apartments. We never had our damn pool fixed. Walk in the mall with my new bitch. Tell her to get the whole rack. My new bitch gon' pull me a new bitch. Then pull me a new bitch. See that is a snowball effect. I got gold on my neck.

My bitch drive a Lamb', you should call her ma'am. I love my Auntie Jean, but fuck Uncle Sam. I'm a walkin' money machine, check my Instagram. Niggas never test the kid so I don't have to cram.

Told her that ""You the star at the top of my Christmas tree"". My only question is, ""Where my presents?"". She said, ""Shhh,"" she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see. Well, I like the way you think, mami. Now pour some more eggnog in you drink, mami. Got a surprise for you that ain't on your Christmas list-es. Gave her the hot chocolate, she said ""It's D-ricious"". Christmas in Harlem. Right after autumn falls. Soakin' it all in. Then we gon' hit the mall. (I'm like Bad Santa, though). Even though we ain't ballin'. (You might have to sit on my lap). Feel like we bought it all. (Ho, ho, ho). The mistletoe's right here. Come give a kiss to Santa Claus. (Cyhi the Prince:). First, I wanted to say Merry Christmas to y'all. For Santa Claus, so bake a turkey, burn a few logs. I be there soon, on my sled, me and Rudolph. Thugs think I'm a Blood 'cause I won't take this red suit off. Ha, I swear I got the freshest wardrobe. I let my beard grow 'cause it's cold in the North Pole. Her voice slow 'cause ""I always got a sore throat"". Okay, stop it, no more jokes. You never see me 'cause I shop when the stores close. And my sleigh go faster than the Porsche go. Ha, I got nine reindeers. That's Dancer, that's Prancer on the fourth flo'. That's Comet, that's Cupid, that's Vixen. That's Donner, that's Dasher, that's Blitzen. Happy Kwanzaa, and for the ones that aren't Christian. Everybody gets gifts as long as I'm livin'. So look forward to havin'. Christmas in Harlem. Right after autumn falls. Soakin' it all in. Then we gon' hit the mall. Even though we ain't ballin'. Feel like we bought it all. The mistletoe's right here. Come give a kiss to Santa Claus. All the flashin' lights up on a tree. The house lit up ni-ice. Wit' your family's where you wanna be. Here on Christmas night. When you wake up and you see the gifts. Don't that make you feel go-ood?. So since we all snowed in in Harlem. Let's have Christmas in the hoo-hood. All of the flashin' light. Yeah, when they shine so bright. Always for you and me. Baby, you're Christmas Eve. If you like what you see. Won't you come sit on my knee?. Tell me everything that you want"
"classic (featuring nas, krs-one & rakim)","Is y’all ready for Twenty-0-7, it’s now another drought. Everyone’s a killer, wow we buggin out. Since 86 showin the crowd what I’m about. And they still want to know when the album comin’ out. Ask the teenagers, O’Gs and Ask the kids. What they definition of Classic is. Timeless, cause age don’t count in the booth. And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth. And no doubt the truth I’m off the meters. Everybody co-signing even non-believers. I came in the door, became one of y’alls leaders. In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers. Uptown we call ‘em uppies when they on divas. Prolly worn when KRS One teaches. Nas, made you look, before the haters. I bet you Kan had ‘em on when he walked with Jesus. This is classic. classic, better than I'v ever been. talent,. If it’s classic it’s gonna last forever than I’m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been. Classic. Better than I'v ever been. [Kanye West:]. Can’t buy this, superflyness, like a shyness, your highness. It’s performin’, look how long the line is. That’s what happens when you make shit that’s timeless. That’s what happens these rappers is the pioneers. What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?. That’s so novice, I’m so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish. I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base. To let me figure out this wasn’t my place, the beat slowed til’ you listened to my pace. Cuz I be killin’ shit, but that’s evident, and y’all feelin’ it, but I expected it. If it’s classic it’s gonna last forever than I’m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been. classic, better than I'v ever been. talent,. If it’s classic it’s gonna last forever than I’m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been. Classic. Better than I'v ever been. [Nas:]. Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper to them it hurts to hear this. O you went platinum – yeah that’s nice, now let me see you do the same thing twice. New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur night is show time. It’s one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one less man. Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans and vans. When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain’t right, by the time you could afford it the car ain’t important. In the streets silent, it’s just I and - cops keep firin’ in my environment. Leavin’ your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager to jump on. I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong. I’m classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that’s what I’m accustomed to. classic, better than I'v ever been. talent,. If it’s classic it’s gonna last forever than I’m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been. Classic. Better than I'v ever been. [KRS One:]. How many y’all got criminal minded you you you y’all don’t be blinded. Me I got no jewels on my neck, why – I don’t need ‘em I got your respect. KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock – this hip hop. And we’s a nation, don’t you want to hear more KRS on your radio station?. Instead of broadcasting how we smokin’ trees, on the radio we need to hear more local MC’s. Where you at? Come on where you at? This is the difference between MC’ing and rap. Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal, MC’s spit rhymes to uplift they people. Peace, love, unity, and Havin’ fun, these are the lyrics of KRS One"

Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne. Whole clique’s appetite had tapeworms. Spinnin’ Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns. I shed a tear before the nights over.

diamonds from sierra leone,"[Intro]. Diamonds are forever. They won't leave in the night. Have no fear that they might. Desert me. [Chorus]. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever). The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.. Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?....... Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic. Vegas on acid,. Seen through these St. Laurent glasses. And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz. It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does. These writers don't rhyme, so sort of. I think 'em. That mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up. Damn, is he really that caught up?. I ask if you talkin' bout glasses, do my name get brought up?. I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder. so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche. - its for yourself that's important. If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men. Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan. Excuse me,. That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because. [Chorus]. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever). The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.. Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?....... I was sick about awards. Couldn't nobody cure me. Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry. Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them. 30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them. What more can you ask for?. The international awards? nah. Who complains about when he is old?. And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old. You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul. And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,. When he came, in the game, he made his own name. Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name. Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kayne. Got family and a deacon, folk from Motown. Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown. Life movin' too fast I need to slow down. Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). My father Ben said I need Jesus. So he took me to church and let the water wash over my season. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). The preacher said we need leaders. Right then my body got still like a paraplegic. You know who you can call you gotta best believe it. The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it. Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic. Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic. After debris settles and the dust get swept off. Big K pick up where young Hov left off. Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off. I dropped my new shit sound like the best of. A&R's lookin' like ""pssh we messed up"". Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up. Bottle after bottle till we got messed up. In the studio, where really though, yea he next up. People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back. That'll be the day I give the game back. You know the next question dog ""Yo, where Dame at?"". This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back. ""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?"". They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen. R-r-r-right here stands a-man. With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands.... Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever). The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.. Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?....... Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)"
diamonds from sierra leone (remix) (feat. jay-z),"[Intro]. Diamonds are forever. They're all I need to please me. They can't stimulate or tease me. They won't leave in the night. Have no fear that they might. Desert me. [Hook]. ""Diamonds are forever forever forever"". Throw ya diamonds in the sky. If you feel the vibe. ""Diamonds are forever forever forever"". The ROC is still alive. Everytime I rhyme. ""Forever and ever!"". For ever ever? for ever ever? ever ever?. Ever ever? ever ever? ever ever? ever ever?. [Verse 1]. Good Morning, this ain't Vietnam still. People lose hands, legs, arms for real. Little was known of Sierra Leone. And how it connect to the diamonds we own. When I speak of Diamonds in this song. I ain't talkin bout the ones that be glown. I'm talkin bout Rocafella, my home, my chain. These ain't conflict diamonds,is they Jacob? don't lie to me mayne. See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin',. How? when I know of the blood diamonds. Though it's thousands of miles away. Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today. Over here, its a drug trade, we die from drugs. Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs. The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses. I thought my Jesus Piece was so harmless. 'til I seen a picture of a shorty armless. And here's the conflict. It's in a black person's soul to rock that gold. Spend ya whole life tryna get that ice. On a polar rugby it look so nice. How could somethin' so wrong make me feel so right, right?. 'fore I beat myself up like Ike. You could still throw ya Rocafella diamond tonight, 'cause. [Hook]. [Verse 2]. [Kanye]. People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back (uh). That'll be the same day I give the game back (uh). You know the next question dog 'yo, where Dame at?'(uh). This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back (whoo!). 'wassup wit you a Jay man, are ya'll okay man?'. [Jay-Z]. Yep!. I got it from her 'ye damn!. The chain remians, the gang is in tact. The name is mine, I'll take blame for that. The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack? (laughs). Part of me I had to laugh at that. How could you falter when you're the rock of gibralter. I had to get of the boat so I could walk on water. This ain't no tour order, this is nothin to me. Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week. I do this in my sleep,. I sell Kilos of coke, (so?) I'm guessin' I can sell CD's. I'm not a buisness man I'm a buisness, man. Let me handle my buisness, damn!. Kanyeez you got me, Freeway and Foxy. YG', Teairra Mari, Petey watch me. Bleek could be one hit away his whole career. As long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire. And even if I die, he's in my will somewhere. So he can just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah. He don't even have to write rhymes. The Dynasty like my money last three lifetimes. Shirley Bassey was in the rear sayin exactly. What I was sayin practically me whole carreer. The diamond is forever, I been mindin' this forever. Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better. People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'. Instead we rose from the ash like a phoenix. If you watin for the end, the dynasty signed. And what seemed like forever is a mighty long time. I'm young bitches [laughs]. Goodnight!"

drive slow,"[Chorus:]. Drive slow homey. Drive slow homey. Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey. Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey. [Kanye:]. My homey Mali used to stay one 79th and May. One of my best friends from back in the day. Down the street form Calumet a school full of stones. He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone. Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off. Walk around the mall with his radio face off. Plus he had the spinner from his Dayton's in his hand. Keys in his hand reason again to let you know he's the man. Back when we rocked Alesis he had dreams of Caprice's. Drove by the teachers even more by police's. How he get that cash today his father passed away. Left him with a little somthin 16 he was stuntin. Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy. Hit lakeshore girls go all crazy. Hit the freeway go at least bout 80. Boned so much that summer even had him a baby. See back back then then if you had a car. You were the Chi town version of Baby. And I was just a virgin a baby. One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy. I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked. Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cracked. We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall. They had the Lincoln's and Aurora's we were hurting them all. And there was a lot of flirting involved. But dawg fuck all that flirting I'm trying to get in some draws. So put me on with these hoes homey's. He said don't rush to get grown drive slow homey. Drive slow homie. Drive slow.... Ya never know homey about these hoes homey. Ya need to pump your breaks and drive slow homey. [Paul Wall:]. What It do. I'm posted up in the parking lot my trunk wavin'. The candy gloss is immaculate and is simply amazing. Them elbows poking wide on that Candy-lac. Trunnk open screens on neons lit with --. I'm on a mission for dime piece's and sexy ladies. Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes. It's a star-studded event when I valet park. Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark. You see them 4's crawlin, you see them screens fallin. The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin. I'm leanin on a switch sittin crooked in my slab. But I could still catch boopas if I drove a cab. A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla. Riding some candy coated crawlin like a caterlippar. I'm tippin on those 4's I'm jamming off this screw. I'm lookin for them hoes baby what it do?. [Chorus:]. Drive slow homey. Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes. Drive slow homey. If you ridin around the city with nowhere to go. Drive slow homey. Live today cuz tomorrow you never know. Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey. Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey. [Kanye:]. My cars like the movies my cars like the crib. I got more TV's in here then where I live. [GLC:]. And it don't make no sense but bay I'm the shit. And everything I flip you know is something serious. I got the custom grill I got the Brabus rims. I got the baller genetics baby that's evident. You see a player flicking and you ain't convinced. That you should go and kiss it just a little bit. I wear my custom kicks I got my Jesus chain. My canaries is gleaming though my angle wings. They see me hoes acting like they seen a king. With that mean lean smoking on the finest Cali green. My wood grain oak I'm riding on vogues. My cylinder quiet like tip toes. I sold O's and this I know. When you see them hoes little homey drive slow. Chopped and Screwed. Yeah... Drive slow homey. Drive slow homey. Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey. Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey. Drive slow homey"

The second verse is for my dogs workin 9 - 5. That still hustle cuz a nigga cain't shine off 6.55. An everybody sellin makeup, Jacobs. And BOOTLEG tapes just to get they cake up. We put shit on layaway then come back. We claim other people's kids on our income tax. We take that money, cop work, then push pounds to get paid. And we don't care what people say. Mama say she wanna move south. Scratchin lottery tickets, eyes on a new house. Bout the same time Do ran up in dudes house. Couldn't get a job so since he couldn't get work. He figyad he'd take work.

family business,"[Intro: Kanye West]. How's your son? (all, all, all the things, things). He make the team this year? (all, all, all the things things). Aw th-, they said he wasn't tall enough?. (all, all, all the glitter in that gold). Yeah me we gon' cook this up (now gold is not a reality). (real is what you live to be). [Verse 1: Kanye West]. This is family business. And this is for the family that can't be with us. And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us. That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet. Like a photo of your granny's picture. Now that you're gone it hit us. Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas, this can't be right. Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be light. Somebody please say grace so I can save face. And have a reason to cover my face. I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it. Pumpkin bread on the side, know how the family do it. When I brought it why did God have to look all to it?. As kids we used to laugh. Who knew that life would move this fast?. Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?. And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it. And if you did, then that's family business. [Hook: Choir]. And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings). They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things). All these fancy things. I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for. Now all I know I know all these things. [Verse 2: Kanye West]. This is family business. And this is for everybody standin' with us. Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture. Hey B, remember when they ain't believe in me?. Now she like ""See, that's my cousin on TV"". Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it. And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite. I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider. But when we get together be electric slidin'. Grandma, get 'em shook up. Aw naw, don't open the photo book up. I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name. But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane. You know that one auntie, you don't wanna be rude. But every holiday nobody eatin' her food. And you don't wanna stay there cuz them your worst cousins. Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins. Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins. Fit three in the bed while six of y'all. I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg. But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed. [Interlude: Choir]. Rain, rain, rain go away. Let the sun come out and all the children say. Rain, rain, rain go away. Let the sun come out and all the children say. [Verse 3: Kanye West]. I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind. A creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns. Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God. And keep your face to the risin' sun. All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog. And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog. I feel like one day you'll understand me dog. You can still love your man and be manly dog. You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'. Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman. Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?. The second he storm out then she storm in. Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion. And drink some wine like Communion. And act like everything fine and if it isn't. We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business. [Interlude: Choir]. (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings). They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things). They don't mean a thing. (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings). They don't mean a thing, a thing. [Hook: Choir]. And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings). They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things). All these fancy things. I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for. Now all I know I know all these things. Females: (oooh) All these things (these things). Males: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things). F: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things). M: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things).

They don't wanna see me love you. Nah, don't stop it. They always love it. They always wanna. They don't wanna see me love you. They don't wanna see me love you. They don't wanna see me love you. They don't wanna see me love you. See through the veil. And forget all your cares. Throw them, throw them away. Oh, life's a feeling. Oh, the body's a feeling"

get by (remix),"Kanye West feat. Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Jay-Z & Busta Rhymes - Get By (Remix). . [Mos Def]. History. It's happening every day y'all (right now). Everyday (right now). Right now (good mornin', Vietnam!). Listen. Brooklyn wins again. It's the Stuy, it's the Bush, dem niggaz again. Ta' Kweli, Mighty Def, and S Dot on the guest slot. Kanye, you're the dope man in hip hop, now let's rock. Now roll out niggaz, my hometown niggaz. I get it good in your hood so slow down niggaz. Watch the speed though, mind the pedal and ease off. A street talk into a collision course with these walls - bam!. They don't move, don't brake, don't lose, don't sleep. Light passin', light fashion, life happens that fast, party done. Black hands up and prayer. Black guns up in fear. Dyin' wish is to touch the air. Seekin' heaven that wasn't here. Eyes will not see another year. It's another day. It's the same fight. Different round, sound the bell. Mix it up as if you're where you live it up the beat. And get risen up you're knocked down get back and get it up. Get off of queer street and get with us. And get clear where we did it. From the heart, from the people. From the top, from the jeep. From the gutter, from the street. From my soul to the mic to the essence. So in my absence you feel the presence, exactly. I make contact for sure the emcee. Me and mine we don't just get by. We get free and that's ready [Mos -- nigga]. [Jay-Z]. Just to get by. Nigga I sold coke, nigga I pushed lah. Carried a fo'five. Claimed I was ready to die. Promised never to cry. Held it all inside. Reality was too much to take so I. Kept my mind fried. Slept for most of mine. Soon as I closed my eyes. Then I woke up behind. Thinking either I load up these nines. Or blow up with rhymes. cause this flow of mine is like blow up but lines of coca. And your folks think Hov' just wrote stuff to rhyme. Nah, I'm a poster for what happened seein your moms. Doin five dollars worth to work just to get a dime. So pardon my disposition. Why should I listen to a system that never listened to me?. Picture me working McDonald's. I'd rather pull a mac on you. Sorry Ms. Jackson but I'm packin. [Kanye West]. It's on I'm packin weight like nina simone. Piano flow. It's like a Michaelangelo painted a portrait of Maya Angelou. And gave it to a sick poet for they antidote. If music gets you choked up this is the tree and the rope. This is Chi, nigga, I mista all of that. Fuck a map, let's put this bitch on the almanac. Dice what they hittin' for, 'lacs what you sittin' on. Tracks who you spittin on, rap till we get it on. And don't let nobody with the power to sign. Ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme. They used to tell me toughen up. Put some bass in your voice. They used to tell me lighten up. Put some Mase in your voice. Lord willin' I ain't killed nobody. But I have a feelin' this album. That I'm gonna make a killin'. Or not a shillin'. This is love it or hate it music. But, at least we made it music. And we didn't make it industry. This is gon' be interesting. This'll be the end of me or I'm finna be an entity. Kanye, Jay-Z, Mos Def, and Kweli. We are not makin' songs no more. We're makin' history. [background singers]. This morning I woke up. Feelin brand new, I jumped up. Feelin my highs and my lows. In my soul, and my goals. Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin. But I been thinkin I got my reasons. Just to get (by), just to get (by). Just to get (by), just to get (by). [background singers repeat in the background]. bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah. bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah. [Talib Kweli]. Just to get by, just to get by. Just to get by, just to get by. [background singers]. bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah. Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah. [Talib Kweli]. Just to get by, just to get by. Just to get by. We keep it gangsta, saying 'fo shizzle', 'fo sheezy'. Desensitized to the violence on TV during the war. Killin each other is easy as whore and liquor for fallen niggaz Believe. me, it's ghetto libations seen it all befo'. Just to get by, my people we get fly. My people we get high, fillin cigars with the lah. Nigga come on, even Jesus was stoned before receivin' the throne. I send a rest in peace to Nina Simone. [Busta Rhymes]. Back in the days we was used to doin the shit. I can't call it all in the streets. We would hustle and fiends would ask for it. I guess I was used to just standin on corners. Waitin for paper bags with bundles of crack. Hopin the week was good so I could get money back. To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by. When I was stressed I possessed a side of my strength. That made me angry and bleed. With the frustration havin me smokin Newports and weed. To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by. Those be the times when I try to rely. On my niggaz and street motherfuckers. And reach out to wifey and then I place a call on my mother. To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by. (Hey yo mom pick up the phone, I g- I gotta to talk to you ma). If you was five percent instead of actin stupid and guessin. You had to go and study your lessons. And know your math in the building recession to get by. [Hook: Talib Kweli + background singers]. This morning I woke up. Feelin brand new, I jumped up. Feelin my highs and my lows. In my soul, and my goals. Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin. But I been thinkin I got my reasons. Just to get (by), just to get (by). Just to get (by), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye). [background singers repeat in the background]. bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah. bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah. [Talib Kweli]. Some people cry. Some people try just to get by. For a piece of the pie. You love to eat and be high. We deceive and we lie. And we keepin' it fly - yo yo yo yo yo. When people decide. Keep a disguise. Can't see your eyes. See the evil inside. The best people you find. Strong or feeble in mind. I stay readin' the signs. yo-yo-yo-yo yo. [repeat]"

I can't call it, I got the swerve like alchoooool-ics. My freshman year I was goin through hell, a problem. Still I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta collllllll-ege. My teacher said I'se a loser, I told her why don't you kill me. I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna folllllllllll-ow. My heart, and if you follow the charts, to the plaques or the stacks. You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see. I'm so shy that you thought it was bashfull but this. bastard's flow will bash a skull. And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro. And I don't, usually smoke but pass the 'dro. And I won't, give you that money that you askin fo'. Why you think, me and Dame cool, we ask hoes. That's why we here your music in fast fo'.

At NYU but she headed from Kansas, right now she just lampin, chillin on. campus. Sent me a picture with a feelin on Candice. Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis. W-H-I-T, it's gettin late mami, your screen saver say tweet. So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend. His name Kweli. (You mean Talib, lyric sticks to your rib). I mean. (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib). I mean. (You don't really know him, why is you lyin). Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pickup the line. She gon' think that I'm lyin, just spit a couple of lines. Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high. . [Verse 3: Talib Kweli]. Yeah. I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin up dolls but. GET EM HIGH, I need some tracks you tryin to pull tracks out. And my rhymes as fittin to blow you tryin to blow back south. Well ok, you twisted my arm, I'll asist with the charm, aiyyo. I though you meet that chickit that got friends with yo moms. And she's the bomb, boy she got the boujI behavior. Always got somethin to say like a bookee playa hater. Anyway, I don't usualy fuck a interneter. Draws stuck to they arm like Nicorette. You really fuckin that much, you tryin to get off cigarettes. And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet. I appoligize if I come off a little inconsiderate. I got the bubble cushion a sister could get ahead of it. [Verse 4: Common]. Get em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke. A high filled with dope. Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes. The real nigga quotes. Real rappers is hard to find, like a remonte, control rap is not a. Used soup it still got life, that's why I abuse you who are not thugs. Rock clubs, it's like Tiger, Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show. Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggaz in you. You'se a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you. How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead. I'm here to resurrect me, mosh is to sexy to even make songs like these. That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys. To many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is populer. Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin her. Album, how come, you the hot garbager. The years clear your image and snooped up. Label got you souped up, tellin you you sick. Man you a dick with a loose nut. Video hard to watch like Medusa. Even your club record need a booster. Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illeaterate nigga. Read the infa, red across your head I'm bread king like Simba. Bolder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a emcee with a temper. You dansin for money like honey, I did this my way. So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye. Spittin through wires and fires, emcees retirin. Got yo hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then. [Chorus: Kanye West]. N-now, th-th-through ya motherfuckin hands. GET EM HIGH. All the girls pass the weed to ya motherfuckin man. GET EM HIGH. Now I ain't never tell you to put down ya hands. KEEP EM HIGH. And if ya losin yo high than smoke again. KEEP EM HIGH"

See me at the airport, at least 20 Louis. Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay. BROTHER NUMPSAY! Groupies sound too choosy. Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies. Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays. If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way. [Chorus]. Too late, we, gone - we strivin home. Gone - we ride on chrome. It's too late. [Kanye West]. Y'all don't want no prob from me. What you rappers could get is a job from me. Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn. I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the win-turr. Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn. Caught somethin on the Usher tour he had to ""Let it Burn"". Plus he already got three chil'run. Arguin over babysitters like, ""Bitch - it's yo' turn!"". Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you. Even your superficial raps is super official. R-R-R-Roc pastel with Gucci on. With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on. Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with doobie long. Cause the dookie's on any song that they threw me on, gone. [Chorus]. We strivin home, gone. [Cam] I ride on chrome.... We strivin home, gone. [Cam] Killa, I ride on chrome. [Cam'Ron]. Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?. Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, gorilla true. Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer. Well here's the deal ma we goin to the {?}. No concealin, no ceiling I don't need a roof. Act up, get out, I don't need you poof. Poof, be gone, damn tough luck dag. Dag, niggaz still doin puff puff pass. Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em. Hey, back in a touched up Jag, shit. Y'all niggaz want Killa Cam, cerebellum. An old man just gon' tell 'em (too late, he, gone). Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm (gone). My last girl want me back then I'm on. Fine stay, you got the grind hey. Came back, read what the sign say (too late, he, gone). Yes I know you wanna see my demise. Yeah you church boy actin like a thief in disguise. Ain't leavin my side, see the greed in my eyes. Ask Abby y'all hustle for a week to the Chi, shit. And that ain't leavin alive, please believe me. Gave Weezy a piece of the pie, and. You can ask George or Regina. The whole Westside I explore with the Beemer now. [Chorus]. We strivin home, I ride on chrome. Listen homeboy move on. That's your best bet, why's that?. Cause. [Consequence]. Uhh, uhh, yo, yo. I been pourin out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone. And tryin to help his momma with the fact that her child gone. And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon. Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on. But since they got a foul on, what coulda gone wrong. Now they askin Cons, how long has this gone on. And maybe all this money mighta gone to my head. Cause they got me thinkin money mighta gone to the feds. So I ain't goin to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed. And when I came the next mornin he was gone with my bread. And with that bein said, I had gone on my instincts. And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks. But lookin back now shoulda gone to the crib. And rented ""Gone With the Wind,"" cause I'da gone about 10. But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar. And heard a nigga talkin shit so I had gone to the car. And now the judge is tellin me that I had gone too far. And now we gone for 20 years, doin time behind bars. And since I gone to a cell for some cruddy crimes. I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone. [long instrumental pause]. [Kanye West imitating ""The Show"" at first]. Uh-uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn. Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh I'mmmm. Ah-head of my time, sometimes years out. So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out. And that make me wanna get my advance out. And move to Oklahoma and just live at my Aunt's house. Yeah, I romance the thought of leavin it all behind. Kanye step away from the lime-. -light, like, when I was on the grind. In the ""One, Nine, Nine, Nine"". Before, model chicks was bendin over or. Dealerships asked me Benz or Rover, man. If I could just get one beat on Hova. We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa. What the summer of the Chi got to offer an 18-year-old. Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play gyro. My dawg worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural-fied. A week later the manager count the churros. Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirrow. How we out in Europe, spendin Euros. They claim you never know what you got 'til it's GONE. I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on. I'ma open up a store for aspiring MC's. Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free. But if they ever flip sides like Anakin. You'll sell everything includin the mannequin. They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston. Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin, stay calm. Shorty's at the door cause they need more. Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs. They said sorry Mr. West is gone!"

I know the city gettin’ ready for me. I know the city gettin’ ready. (Kanye). Such an easy mornin’, we on a ride. And I’m feelin’ smooth as the way the Benz drive. Turn the radio down if they playin’ that bullshit. They don’t want black people to think at trial. He think he live. (Common). He think he live, he think he cold. He think I’m high, I’m in thinker mode. Eyes low’d, I let the skies hold the thoughts. The streets are like the high road that I go across. (Kanye). I mean, my whole team ’bout to smash the streets. The Phillip Lim remind them that it’s Fashion Week. And the weather wasn’t barely hot. Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott?. Did I mention G.O.O.D. Music, yeah, forever we hot. Motherfucker, are you ready or not?. Are you?. Ready to go?. I know the city gettin’ ready for me. I know the city gettin’ ready. Are you?. Ready to go?. I know the city gettin’ ready for me. I know the city gettin’ ready. (This goes out to the hardcore hip-hop). (Can’t stop! Yooou can’t stop!). (This goes out to the allcore hip-hop). (Can’t stop! Yooou can’t stop!). (Pusha T). As ‘Ye flips the piano. The mood swings like the change of a channel. He’s heating up like they wrapped him in flannel. Sellin’ kilos through your iPod nano. Cocaine vandal, I induct scandal. Money drive you crazy, look at Marbury’s handle. Vaseline face, reminiscent of my tires. Ice cream paint job, somethin’ like Breyers. Euro tank top, Dior inspired. Sell it to you hard, no assembly required. (Eyuck!) I’m 2012 in 2010. Which makes this a time machine, not just any Benz. Floss for the members of the gang with 28. While haters wish death ‘pon me, that’s many men. Yeah, and if you slaim you on your paper route. Stop talkin’, motherfucker, pull your paper out. Are you?. Ready to go?. I know the city gettin’ ready for me. I know the city gettin’ ready. Are you?. Ready to go?. I know the city gettin’ ready for me. I know the city gettin’ ready. (Big Sean). Now tell me, do it feel good? Well, all right. Don’t worry, we gon’ be here all night. And you know a nigga rep that Westside (Westside!). Westside, Westside!. So te-te-tell who the freshest of ‘em all?. They claimin’ that they fresh, they ain’t fresher than my balls. A nigga seen the fresh like I’m headed to the fall. MC hunting season, putting heads up on the wall. I sneak peeked ahead while we headed to the loft. Man, I always thought with the head inside my drawers. I guess that’s why in school, my grades went from As to Bs to Cs. All over double Ds, I be absent all week. This is for my niggas, all the ones I ride for. Man, that’s the fam, we let ‘em in through the side door. Hold on: That’s the girl you gave a wedding ring?. Man, me and my niggas nutted on her everything. (Charlie Wilson). And let me hear you say ahhhh. Va-va-va-va-va-va. Va-va-va-va-va-va. Let me hear you say ahhhh. Va-va-va-va-va-va. Va-va-va-va-va-va. (Kanye). Ay, we promised. Now put your hands up to the sky. Until the day in that we die. And we’ll be here all evenin’. G.O.O.D. Fridays, I hope you have a nice weekend. Are you?. Ready to go?. I know the city gettin’ ready for me. I know the city gettin’ ready. Are you?. Ready to go?. I know the city gettin’ ready for me. I know the city gettin’ ready. Are you?. Ready to go?. I know the city gettin’ ready for me.

What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'. What do it mean when you never dream at all then. And you don't really know cause you can't recall them. It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to. People you never got a chance to say bye to. Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams. Into real life, if you try to. So close, but so far. And so far, no cigar.

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances. and eventually answers to the call of Autumn. all of them fallin' for the love of ballin'. got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin. inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums. based off the way we was branded. face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon. and at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random. but we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage. I need a happy ending and a new beginning. and a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative. this the real world, homie, school finished. they done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it.

Is hip hop, just a euphemism for a new religion. the soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing. this is more than just my road to redemption. Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention. as long as I'm in Polo's they think they got me. but they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me. I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me. if a n-gga aint running shootin a jump shot running a track meet. but this pimp is, ar the top of mount Olympus. ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics. we make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish. choke a southpark writer with a fishstick.

I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today. they rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday. and what's a black beetle anyway, a f-cking roach. I guess thats why they got me sitting in f-cking coach. but God said I need a different approach. cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke. it aint funny anymore try dipping jokes. tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o. kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I'm got it. play strings for the dramatic. and end all of that wack sh-t. act like I aint had a belt in two classes. I aint got it I'm going after whoever who has it. I'm coming after whoever who has it. you blowing up, that's good, fantastic. that y'all, its like that ya'll. I don't really give a f-ck about it at all. cause the same people that tried to black ball me. forgot about 2 things, my black balls. [Kid Cudi - Chorus]. [Raekwon]. I know cops, hems is lifting lenses. kid, Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes. counting up, smoking, one cuff. live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, f-ck it. steam about a hundred and one L's. kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson. n-gga hat game was special. it matched every black pair of Nikes. throwing dice for decimals. the older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head. make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead. got made code red. break up the black skunk. the black dutch, back of the old shed. if you can't live, you dying. you give or buy in. keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding. keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan. learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye.

h.a.m,"[Verse 1: Kanye West]. It was all good just a week ago. Niggas feel theyselves. And they watch The Throne drop. Niggas kill themselves. What are niggas gon' do Hov?. This a new crack on a new stove. I'm in the two-door, true that. Niggas telling me ""you back"". Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch huh?. And if life's a bitch then suck my dick huh?. And I bet she fucked the whole clique huh?. By the way nigga you should fucking quit nigga. Just forget it, you talk it, I live it. Like Eli, I did it. Joke's on you motherfucker, I get it. No paper ho but you can have some more of me. Or-a-gy or are we speaking metaphorically?. Historically I'm kicking bitches out like Pam, nigga. Doing H.A.M nigga, me and Jigga. And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids. But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit. Had a few white girls, asses flat as shit. But the head's so good, damn a niggas glad he hit. Got em jumping out the building, watch out below. A million out the door. [Hook]. I'm about to go H.A.M. Hard as a motherfucker. Let these niggas know. Who I am. I'm about to go H.A.M. Hard as a motherfucker. Let these niggas know. Who I am. [Verse 2: Jay-Z]. Fuck y'all mad at me for?. Y'all don't even know what I've been through. I played chicken with a Mack truck. Y'all muthafuckas would've been moved. I swam waters with Great Whites. Y'all muthafuckas would've been chewed. I hustled with vultures late nights. Y'all muthafuckas would've been food. Fuck is wrong with these dudes?. Try to walk around in these shoes. See the shit I saw growing up. Then maybe you could take a peek at these, boo. Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily. Like, these rappers rap about. All the shit that I do - really!. I'm like really half a billion nigga. Really, you got baby money. Keep it real with niggas. Niggas ain't got my lady's money!. Watch The Throne: no steppin on it, bro!. Bad enough to let you step in the club. With my nephew die, daddy dead. Nigga took the price on my uncle's head. Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled. So I feel like I would like to know my uncle's bread. Bow down, brotha pay homage. Don't spill hate all on my garments. Comme des Garcons, fuck yo fresh. Headshots nigga, fuck your vest. Fuck the pigs, don't talk to the law. Peace God, cause you know a nigga gets. H.A.M. [Hook]. I'm about to go H.A.M. Hard as a motherfucker. Let these niggas know. Who I am. I'm about to go H.A.M. Hard as a motherfucker. Let these niggas know. Who I am"

From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way,. So this is in the name of love, like Robert says. Before you ask me to get a job today, can I atleast get a raise on a minimum wage?. And I know the gouverment administered Aids,. So I guess we just pray like the minister say,. Allah o Akbar and throw em some hot cars,. Things we see on the screen are not ours,. But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far,. Where im from, the dope boys is the rock stars,. But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars,. I guess they want us all behind bars.. I know it.. [Chorus (Adam Levine)]. Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.. (ooooooooo). And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.. (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.). But we'll find a way. (And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way). [Kanye]. They say people in your life are seasons,. And anything that happen is for a reason,. And niggas guns a clappin and keep to squeezin',. And Gran (Grandma) keep prayin' and keep believin',. And Jesus and one day that ya see him,. Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him,. The devil is alive I feel him breathin',. Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin',. And put those lottery tickets just to tease us,. My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down,. Now my lil cousin smokin those cigarettes now,. His job trying to claim that he too niggerish now,. Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now?. I can't figure it out.... Im Stickin around..... [Chorus (Adam Levine)]. Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.. (ooooooooo). And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.. (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.). But we'll find a way. (And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way). (Cuz every worthless word we get more far away, and nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,. And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way). [Beat Changes]"

You fixed me up something that was good for my soul. Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?. You work late nights just to keep on the lights. Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike. And you would give anything in this world. Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl. And you never put no man over me. And I love you for that mommy cant you see?. Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes. Cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry. As we knelt on the kitchen floor. I said mommy Imma love you till you don't hurt no more. And when I'm older, you aint gotta work no more. And Imma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford. See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable. Highly capable, lady that's makin loot. A livin legend too, just look at what heaven do. Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama). [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates. My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate. Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with. But still supported me when I did the opposite. Now I feel like it's things I gotta get. Things I gotta do, just to prove to you. You was getting through, can the choir please. Give me a verse of â€œYou, Are So Beautiful To Meâ€?. Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry. Maya Angelou, Nicky Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy. Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet. Now when I say Hey, yall say Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama). [Chorus]. [Bridge]. I guess it also depends tho, if my ends low. Second they get up you gon get that Benzo. Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama). [Verse 3]. Tell your job you gotta fake em out. Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out. To a restaurant, upper echelon. Imma get you a jag, whatever else you want. Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?. Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right. It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday. For me to just call and say (Hey Mama)"

Sorta like Grant Hill and Kobe's wife. So when we at a club, and she be so polite. But when we back at home she be poltergeist. I mean provoking fights. Trying to poke me with knifes. And last time I tried to poke her she just told me goodnight. See her clothing be tight. She was pervert approved. So she gave up on life, now she don't wanna move. Hypnotized by the tube. So she stay with the clicker. In a cup full of liquor. Thinkin its makin her thicker. But its makin her slimmer. So our future is dimmer. I can't remember last time I took my baby to dinner. See I'm sayin' a sister who was freaky and ruthless. In a yorkshire terrier in the pocket with pooches. In a pocket with Gucc's. Was taking my lunch money. Just like the gooches.

They smile in my face is what I don't like. They steal your whole sound that's a soundbite. The media crucify me like they did Christ. They want to find me not breathin' like they found Mike. A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite. But I never hit a woman never in my life. I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife. In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice. Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice. Eatin' good, vegetarian with the brown rice. Girls kissin' girls, cause it's hot right?. But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes.

And I spend on a bunch of clothes, cause I'm livin' life. I come up on the scene, and I'm stealin' light. Bitch I'm high off life, got me feelin' right. Bitch I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like.

i thought about killing you,"I know, I know, I know, I know, know. I know, I know, I know, I know, know. I, I know it, I know it. The most beautiful thoughts. Are always besides the darkest. Today, I seriously thought about killing you. I contemplated, premeditated murder. And I think about killing myself. And I love myself. Way more than I love you, so. Today, I thought about killing you. Premeditated murder. You'd only care enough. To kill somebody you love. The most beautiful thoughts. Are always inside the darkest. (mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhmm). Just say it out loud to see how it feels. People say, ""don't say this, don't say that"". Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels. Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table. Today I thought about killing you. Premeditated murder. I think about killing myself. And I, I love myself way more than I love you. The most beautiful thoughts. Are always besides the darkest. (mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhmm). I think this is the part. Where I'm supposed to say somethin' good. To compensate it so it doesn't come off bad. But sometimes I think really bad things. Really, really, really bad things. And I love myself way more than I love you. See, if I was tryin'. To relate it to more people. I'd probably say. I'm struggling with loving myself. Because that seems like a common theme. But that's not the case here. I love myself way more than I love you. And I think about killing myself. So, best believe. I thought about killing you today. Premeditated murder. I called up my loved ones. I called up my cousins. I called up the muslims. Said I'm 'bout to go dumb. Get so bright, it's no sun. Get so loud, I hear none. Screamed so loud, got no lungs. Hurt so bad, I go numb. Time to bring in the drums. That prrt-pu-pu-pum. Set the newtone on 'em. Set the nuke off on 'em. I need coke with no rum. I taste coke on her tongue. I don't joke with no one. They'll say he die so young. I done had a bad case of too many bad days. Got too many bad traits. Used the floor for ashtrays. I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache. I'ma make my name last. Put that on my last name. It's a different type of rules that we obey. Ye, ye, ye season, nigga, we old bay. We was all born to die, nigga doa. Niggas say they hero, mhm, I don't see no cape. Mhm, I don't see no, mhm, yeah. I don't see no, mhm, mhm. If I wasn't shinin' so hard. Wouldn't be no shade. Buckwheat ass nigga, it's 'gon be otay. Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age. I thought I was past my deebo ways. Even when I went broke, I ain't break. How you gon' hate? nigga, we go way back. To when I had the braids. And you had the wave cap. Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way asap. Don't get socked in the mouth. You know homie don't play that. Pay the fire marshal bill. 'cause this shit done got way packed. They wanna see me go ape (ape, ape). All you gotta do is speak on ye. All you gotta do is speak on ye. Don't get your tooth chipped like frito-lay"

last call,"[Intro: Jay-Z (Kanye)]. [laughing]. Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost. For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker. Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room. 'Cause they don't fucking... (I'd like to propose a toast). (I said toast motherfucker). [Chorus: Kanye]. And I am. And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them. Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky. This is the last call for alcohol, for the... So get your ass up off the wall. [Verse 1]. The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac. The Rudloph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc. I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame. And come back next year with the whole fucking game. Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top. They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop. Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself. Rocafella's only niggaz that help. My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair. Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here. They say he bourgie, he big-headed. Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is. Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds. I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas. It's funny how wasn't nobody interested. 'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir. Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir. Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest. But all they got left is this guy called West. Better take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def. Call him Kwa-lI or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z. I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh. It come out sweeter than old Sadie. Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards. Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards. And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye. I'm almost reignin'. Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?. It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him. Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine. Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme. Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem. Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams. I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed. But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh. So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more. You niggaz wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more. You can't say shit to Kanye West no more. I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga. I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don. Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom. I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards. I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars. I went to the malls and I balled too hard. 'Oh my god, is that a black card?'. I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term. African American Express. Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell. Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to. Killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips. [Chorus]. ""... last call for alcohol, for my niggaz"". [Outro]. So this A&R over at Rocafella, named Hiphop. picked the Truth beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin?"". I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay."". Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone. going back and forth, just askin me to send him beats. And I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers. cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with. And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""look man, you wanna mess with Kanye. you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"". [No ID:] ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap"". I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not. but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer. [Hiphop:] ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper"",. I'm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the Ghost production. But that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know. After they picked that Truth beat. I was figuring I was gonna do some more work. But shit just went poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago. I had my own apartment. I be doin' like, just beats for local acts. just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy. get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something. or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then. I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample. I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like ""oh, yo that shit is crazy. Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty."". And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me. so I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. and really I just, like picked the drums off Xxplosive and put it like. with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style. when it started, when he rapped on 'This Can't be Life.'. And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album. I could say that was the, the resurgence of this whole sound. You know, I got to come in and track the beat, and at the time. I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with. Hiphop. 'Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm. sayin, 'cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they did. for me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he. gotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. And that day I. came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, ""oh. you a real soulful dude"" [Jay-Z: ""you a real soulful dude""]. And he. uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got. to the studio, you know how he do it, one take. And he said. [Jay-Z:] ""check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"". ""tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking. like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z, I ain't. want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the, in my. personal opinion. So he asked me, ""what you think of it?"". [Jay-Z:] ""so what you thinkin?"". And I was like, ""man that shit tite,"". you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train. man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just. in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got. acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like. poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that was one. of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through. my production company, but he ended up going straight with the. company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad. news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at. the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took. that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about. ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to deal. with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to. [Mother:] ""Come on, let's just go"". Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment.. I remember I pulled up. [Mother:] ""Kanye, baby, we're here"",. I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a. bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and. the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.'. And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up. there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I. played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the zone. he already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like already at. that time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a GuccI bucket. hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said. ""yo play that one beat for him."" And I played 'Heart of the City.' And. really I made 'Heart of the City,' I really wanted to give that beat to DMX.. [Hiphop:] ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here"".. And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that. GuccI bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of. them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen. Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like ""yo what's up I'm Kanye."". [Dame:] ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"". ""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?. Yo, this nigga got classics"". [Dame:] ""Jay got classics, G."". You know I ain't talkin shit.. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm. still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggaz on the show. The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my. eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all. these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one. thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be. Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton. sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Tata, John. Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the. time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I. spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical. shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his. eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the rap. was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response.. He said ""man that was tite."". [Jay-Z:] ""That, that was cool. That was hot."". That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe.. Okay, fast forward.. So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just. took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship. with KwelI I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my. career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me. to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at. this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had. relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so. they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound. like Jay-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them. these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll. be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy. 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they. didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked. with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the. company that'll say ""naw."" Like, Dave LottI fucked with me, my. nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man. [Jessica:] ""Man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."". I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up. ""Y'all niggaz is stupid"". Let's just say I didn't get my deal.. The nigga that was behind me, I mean,. he wasn't even a nigga, you know?. The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol. Records. He wanted to sign me really bad.. [Joe:] ""We gonna change the game, buddy."". Dame was like, ""yo you got a deal with Capitol,. okay man, just make sure it's not wack."". [Dame:] ""you gotta make sure it's not wack."". Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to. play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and. Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll. never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'. ""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow. I got eleven plaques on my walls right now. You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."". Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So. I play that song for him, and he's like ""oh shit"". [Dame:] ""Oh shit it's not even wack."". ""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."". [Dame:] ""it's actually kinda hot."". Like they still weren't looking at me. like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole. album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and. save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's. like ""yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick"". [Dame:] ""you don't wanna catch a brick"". You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.. I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with. that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was. already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you. know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I. was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm. not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer. rapper"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right--. the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio. sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes. man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said. ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal"". [Mel:] ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."". And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested. and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying. to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I. called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Rocafella?"""

My mom would always say ""Dad, why don't you work?"",. But he just kept learning.. All the other kids parents were working and saving up money for school,. And I was actually in school all when my dad was in school.. He was so gready with degrees, he took my degree.. And now I'm just glad he left me these.. Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have.. These are documented.. My father left them for me.. And Im going to leave them to my kids.. I'm going to learn too.. I'm going to get super smart, so I too can die without money.. But I'll be the smartest dead guy.. Who has that. . By Ned"
lollipop (remix),"[Intro - Lil Wayne]. No homo. I say he's so sweet, make her wanna lick the wrapper. [Verse 1 - Kanye West]. Lollipop, lollipop. Breasts is just like Dolly Parton. She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top. That hit the spot, 'til she ask. ""How many li-I-li-I-licks do it take 'til she get to shop?"". Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze?. Tell her, ""Girl, like Doritos, that's nacho cheese"". Tell her friends, ""Like Fritos, I'm tryin to lay. I can't only have one and I ain't tryin to wait"". This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gonna melt. But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else. I'mma rap like I got some type of respect for myself. I don't do it for my health, man I do it for the belt. Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt. Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt. Man, the flow so cold chicken soup won't help. We need fo' mo' hoes, we need Mo-oh-oh!. You know what it is when we're outta town. We ball in 2 seats, and you out of bounds. So come here baby girl. You're now fuckin' with the best in the world. [Hook]. She lick me like a lollipop. Shawty want a thug. Bottles in the club. Shawty wanna hump, you know. I like to touch you're lovely lady lumps. [Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]. Shawty say she wanna lick the wrapper. And she gonna lick the rapper. And I just wanna act like a porno-flicking actor. I Anita Bake-her, now she caught up in that Rapture. I got so much chips, I swear they call me Hewlett Packard. I got so much chips you can have a bag if you're a snacker. Greedy mutha-fudge cake, now tell me how that fudge tastes. I do it for bloods' sake, soo-woo think it's voodoo. How that roof do di-di-dissipate, your girl wants to participate. She so so sophisticate, cause her brain is off the chain. And then my diamonds are in the choir,. because they sang from off my chain. And my Nina just joined the gang, because, all she do is bang!. Like Ricky Martin; Wayne and Kanye: pick your poison. If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment. Tell her to make an appointment with. Mr. I-can't-make-an-appointment. Take my lollipop and enjoy it. [Hook]. [Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]. Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie. In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building. I flushed out the feeling of me being the shit. Cause I was leaving skid marks on everywhere I sit. I am everywhere, I'm it like, Hide-n-Go. And I can go anywhere: innie, minnie, miney, mo. I'm in your neighborhood, area, Cd thing, tape deck. Ipod, your girlfriend - and she say I got great sex. Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex. Cause you don't want that late text, that ""I think I'm late"" text. So wrap it up!. But he's so sweet she wanna lick the wrapper"

That you're mean so much too me so. [B-Section]. Baby (baby) these butterflies they never lie. Been thru so much pain before (and). Baby (baby) - I had to try. 'Cause you're not like most guys. And I ain't ashamed to say that you're my. [Hook]. Baby (baby). Don't matter what they say baby (baby). They just don't know my baby. And how I feel about you. Baby (baby). Don't matter what they say baby (baby). I won't let go my baby. And how I feel about you. [Verse 2]. When you look in my eyes. I wish you could read my mind (and). And know how I feel inside (feel inside). And hear what they say about you. Just because they can't see (see). You're more than enough for me (why). Why can't they just let us be. (can't they just let be). And leave us alone. [B-Section]. [Hook]. [Rap]. I go by the name Kanye Omari. And I wrote this just to say I'm sorry. I have foreign cars and houses. I have porno stars and spouses. You tryin' to stab one like Jack the Ripper. I was tryin' to stabe two like Jack the Tripper. My nigger Tone been locked for a minute. He come home he. And I'm a big tipper I don't need to be trippin?. This my first Rolex it don't even be tickin'. This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower. Without them clouding up in half an hour. So that basically mean my paper getting mean. Basically mean I'm into better things. I was an addict of cheating but I stopped before. You an addict you go with Janet Jackson you cured. [Hook]. [Vamp Out]. Don't matter what they say baby. They just don't know my baby. Don't matter what they say baby. I won't let go, my baby. But y'all don't know a thing about my. My baby (baby) My baby (baby). There's more to his love than what y'all see. And it don't describe what he is to me"
my way,"My Way. Kanye West. I've lived. Yes I've lived a life that's full. I've traveled each, and every highway. What more, and what's more than this -. It go my way, Chi-Way. This way or the highway. Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday. The ROC got ""-Ye"" but they ain't snortin' it. They just got him up the base line recordin' shit. Yeah I've been broke. Now I'm good bitch. I ain't no Kennedy. But I'm hood rich. So I say my way to thank you to the ghetto. And everybody else, thank you very little. I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path. I've been beatin', but never brokin' through the darkest past. It's sort of like when King spoke and said we free at last. Ain't nothin' free from that point, though. We needed cash. And we need it fast. We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last. Now all the blacks cookin' up, they're almost white. 'Cause gettin' green makes 'em treat us treat us like we almost white. Almost. I've lived. Yes I've lived a life that's full. I've traveled each, and every highway. What more, and what's more than this -. It go my way, Chi-Way. This way or the highway. Niggaz wanna diss K. On they're local mix-tapes. There they go again, lyin' to consumers. Get their hair cut in the little shop of rumors. Your lil' sloppy with your cockyness ain't ya. A little arrogant with all your compares. 'Cause as far as the Chi. I got the most plaques since the beginnin' of rap. And nah, I ain't mentionin' that. Y'all just talk about my dough. How I left Chicago. How I'm the only one eatin'. Shut your pie hole. And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though. Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro. When you prepare, would you copy what I do and say?. Only difference between you and me, you were gay. Ahhhhh, did he get his feelin's hurt?. Nahhhh, he's got titties under his shirt. I've lived. Yes I've lived a life that's full. I've traveled each, and every highway. What more, and what's more than this -. It go my way, Chi-Way. This way or the highway. When you walk straight, niggaz tend to look at you sideways. I say, Fuck that dog, I get my own way. Niggaz ain't believe me 'till they see me on T.V.. And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway. Then passin' up Freeway, just like it's a relay. We stay 4 stars, or better. 'Cause the couches in the rooms got, more leather. And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better. And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas. You still dress (Ardjo), but only pay partial. Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's. Polo and (Carbesher's), we into them things dogg. Back in '96 we was livin' like kings dogg. 40 cals or better, tottin' them things dogg. So up the turkish snake, and take them rings off. I've lived. Yes I've lived a life that's full. I've traveled each, and every highway. What more, and what's more than this -. I did it my way. . By DAN'S"
my way home,"I'm on my way home. They say home is where the hate is. My dome is where fate is. I stroll where souls get lost like vegas. Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses. Pray to god that my arms reach the masses. The young smoke grasping graspless jungles. Rubberband together in cashless bundles. We wear struggling chains. Divided only hustle remains. Making sense of it we hustle for change. Revolution ain't a game. It's another name. For life fighting. Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson. Hypes fighting for hits to heighten they hell. Don't he know he only get as high as he fell. Show money becomes bail. Relationships become jail. Children are unheld. I wish love was for sale. Behold the pale. Horse got me trapped like r. kel', I bail and it-. Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again. I'm on my way home. I left three days ago. But no one seems to know I'm gone. Home is where the hatred is. Home is filled with pain and it. Might not be such a bad idea if I never. Never went home again."
never let me down,"When it comes to being true, at least true to me. One thing I found, one thing I found. Oh no you never let me down. Get up, I get.... Get up, I get.... Get up, I get.... Get up, I get.... Get up, I get.... Get up, I get down. [Jay-Z]. Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts. First I had they ear, now I have their heart. Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start. I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart. Seen the rovers roll up wit ribbons. I seen them re-po'd, re-sold then re-driven. So when I reload, he holds #1 position. When you hot I'm hot. And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin. It's plain to see, niggaz can't fuck with me. Cuz I'm a be that nigga for life. This is not an image, this is God given. This is hard livin, mixed with crystall sippin. It's the most consistent, Hov. Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and. Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggaz visitin. It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap. I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy. [Chorus overlapping last four lines]. [Kanye West]. I get down for my grandfather who took my momma. Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat. At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in. And with that in my blood I was born to be different. Now niggaz can't make it to ballads to choose leadership. But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership. Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin it. Racisms still alive, they just be concealin it. But I know they don't want me in the damn club. They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club. I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed. Swear I've been baptized each 3 or 4 times. But in the land where niggaz praise Yukons and getting paid. Its gon take a lot more than coupons to get us saved. Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves. Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away. So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter. And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up. And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her. You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up. But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye. Cuz look what an accident did to Left Eye. First Aaliyah now romeo must die?. I know I got angels watchin me from the other side. [Chorus]. [J.Ivy]. We are all here for a reason on a particular path. You don't need a curriculum to know that you're apart of the math. Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious. That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world. I'm tryna make it better for these little boys and girls. I'm not just another individual. My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual. But I get my hymns from him. So it's not me it's he that's lyrical. I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument. My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes. For your soul and your mental. That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into. Yeah I need my loot by rent day. But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte. I'm tryna give us us free like Sinke. I can't stop, that's why I'm hot. Determination, dedication, motivation. I'm talking to you of my many inspirations. When I say I can't let you or self down. If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff. And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life. In my grip I would never ever let you down. And when these words are found. Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed. With a language called love. That's why my breath is felt by the death. And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind. I too dream in color and in rhyme. So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house. Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth. A touch of god reigns out. [Chorus]. [Jay-Z]. Who else you know been hot this long. Started from nothing but he got this strong. Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you. Peddled bikes, got my nephews peddle bikes because they special. Let you tell it man I'm fallin well. Somebody must have caught hi'm cuz. Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan em. Number one albums what I got, like four of em. More of them on the way, the 8th wonder on the way. Clear the way, I'm here to stay. Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that. This is Jay, dissin Jay will get you Mase'd. When I start spittin them lyrics niggaz get very religious. Six hail mary's please father forgive us. Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggaz. They way y'all all follow Jigga. Hov's a livin legend and I'll tell you why. Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive"
new god flow (feat. pusha t),"[Pusha T] (Kanye West). I believe there's a god above me. I'm just the god of everything else. I put hoes in everything else. New God Flow, fuck everything else. Supreme dope dealer, write it in bold letters. They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella. They said Pusha aint fit with the umbrella. But I was good with the Yay as a wholesaler. I think it's good that Ye got a blow dealer. A hot temper, matched with a cold killer. I came up more, for more than just to rhyme with him. Think '99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him. (Matching Daytonas, rose gold on us). Going ham in the ? done took a toll on us. (But since you over do it, I'mma pour more). Well if you goin' coupe, I'm going 4 door. [Hook]. Shake that?. Come and have a good time with G-O-D.. [Pusha T]. Step on they necks till they can't breathe. Claim they 5 stars but sell you dreams. They say death multiplies by three's. Lined them all up and lets just see. Fuck ?em ?Ye, fuck ?em ?Ye. I wouldn't piss on that nigga with grand?. They shoulda shopping in target. My shit is luxury gourmet. I'm ballin', I'm all red. ?. Whats a king without a crown nigga. Whats a circus without you clown niggas. Whats a brick from an outta town nigga. When you flood and you can drown niggas. It's the GOOD music golden child. M-A-Dollar sign aint nobody hold me down. [Kanye West]. Hold up, I ain't tryna stunt man. But the Yeezy's jumped over the jumpman. Went from most hated to the champion God flow. I guess that's a feeling only me and Lebron know. I'm living 3 dreams, Biggie Smalls, Dr. King, Rodney Kings. Uh, cause we can't get along, no resolution. Till we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston. Cars, money, girls and the clothes. Aww man, you sold your soul. Nah man, mad people was frontin'. Aww man, made something from nothing. Picture working so hard and you cant cut through. That can mess up your whole life, like the uncle that touched you. What has the world come to?. I'm from the. 312, where cops don't come through, and dreams don't come true. Like where did God go, in his Murcielago. From working McDonalds, barely paying the car note. He even got enough to get his mama a condo. Than they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom. 40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week. Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street. Welcome to Sunday service if you hope that Sunday service. We got green in my eyes, follow this Eric Sermon. Did Moses not part the water with the cane. Did strippers not make an arc when I made it rain. Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame. Ran to Jacob's and made the new Jesus Chains. In Jesus name, let the choir say. I'm on fire ayy, that's what Richard Pryor Say. And we annihilate anybody that violate. Ask any dopeboy you know, they admire Ye'. GOOD Music, GOOD Music, GOOD Music, GOOD Music. And all my niggas say GOOD Music. And all my ladies say GOOD Music. I don't know but I've been told. I don't know but I've been told. If you get fresh get all the hoes. If you get fresh get all the hoes. I'm way fresher than all my foes. I'm way fresher than all my foes. Somebody please pick out they clothes. Somebody please pick out they clothes. And all my niggas say GOOD Music. And all my ladies say GOOD Music. Who run this shit today: GOOD Music. Who run this shit today: GOOD Music"
new slaves,"Verse 1]. My momma was raised in an era when. Clean water was only served to the fairer skin. Doing clothes you would have thought I had help. But they wasn't satisfied unless. I picked the cotton myself. You see its broke nigga racism. That's that? Don't touch anything in the store?. And there's rich nigga racism. That's that? Come here, please buy more?. What you want a Bentley, fur coat. and diamond chain?. All you blacks want all the same things. Used to only be niggas. now everybody play me. Spending everything on Alexander Wang. New Slaves.

We make it out alive. All right, all right. No church in the wild. [jay-z:]. Tears on the mauseoleum floor. Blood stains the coliseum doors. Lies on the lips of a priest. Thanksgiving disguised as a feast. Rollin' in the rolls-royce corniche. Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police. Cocaine seats. All white like I got the whole thing bleached.

And deception is the only felony. So never f-ck nobody wit'out tellin' me. Sunglasses and advil. Last night was mad real. Sun comin' up, 5 a.m.. I wonder if they got cabs still. Thinkin' 'bout the girl in all-leopard. Who was rubbin' the wood like kiki shepard. Two tattooes, one read ""no apologies"". The other said ""love is cursed by monogamy"". That's somethin' that the pastor don't preach. That's somethin' that a teacher can't teach. When we die, the money we can't keep. But we prolly spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap. Preach.

And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs. Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous. When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list. Strippers get invited to where they only get hired. When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired. I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired. And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir. Any rumor you heard about me was true and legendary. I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries. For all my niggas with babies by bitches. That use they kids as meal tickets. Not knowing the disconnect from the father. The next generation will be the real victims. I can't fault 'em really.

Some rappers complex, but they can't see the music. We show orchestration, and with funky prevention. It was different and black, and it caused devestation. Gotta new bag, signed a deal with Wild Pitch. Now we're back on the street, with the flavor you missed. So get with the program, Ultra hot off your real high. I know I'm a real pro, like Michigan Fab 5. Runnin and shootin, for me alley-oopin. Is makin an album, with big distribution. Promote it and hype it, make up posters then snipe it. Raise it up!. Chorus. Interlude: Announcer. Ladies and gentlemen, live from Flatbush Brooklyn. I bring to you tonight, the Godfather Don. From the Orphans.... (""Hit it!""). Verse Three: Godfather Don. Lookin down the barrel of a gun is no fun. So for some, I rum-pum-pum and flip, like a tongue. of young dragon, with the force and ten sacks of buddah. To wax a crew of jacks and looters, even your hoe I shoot her. In the face, with the mother-uffin bass. Now taste the venom of the ish that I sent em. And foes, that doze, I chew em like gristle. Wipe my mouth with tissue, there's no issue. I'm first print, mint, check the wizard. The force of my blast, blow em like a Tec in a blizzard. Now what is it? Exquisite physics to stain your brain. When they visit cardiovascular masterer, words are massacred damn. I got beats rhymes tanks gats includin Ultra. Check the loop, snoop low we do ya like a vulture. Back in the days, there was just beef and knuckles. Nowadays, a beatdown consists of some clips. My oowop, rips with abandon at random. Whiff, you be ghost, like Michael Landon. When I bust amazing nuts you play the cut. The Father's Ultra paid, I raise it... up. Chorus: repeat 2X"

saint pablo,"Yeah, 9: 08 L. A. time. Back in the lab and shit. Kanye West. My wife said, I can't say no to nobody. And at this rate we gon' both die broke. Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt. And like my wife said, I still didn't say no. People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter. My friends' best advice was to stay low. I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills. Especially when you got family members on payroll. The media said it was outlandish spendin'. The media said he's way out of control. I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'. I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control. I know I'm the most influential. That Time cover was just confirmation. This generation's closest thing to Einstein. So don't worry about me, I'm fine. I can see a thousand years from now in real life. Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like. Troll conventional thought, don't need to question. I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive. Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission. Did it with with no permission, on our own conditions. Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission. Yeezy with the big house, did it way different. Never listen to Hollywood producers. Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa. The ultimate Gemini has survived. I wasn't supposed to make it past 25. Sampha. And you're looking at the church in the night sky.

A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums. I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro. If the phone ringing, go and get your kids ho. Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation. He sat back and smiled. Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime. The jews share they truth on how to make a dime. Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook. But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout ""how my neck look? "". Well it all looks great. Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains. The light is before us brothers, so the devil working hard. Real family stick together and see through the mirage. The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality. Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?. I am one with the people. I am one with the people (real). I've been workin' from enlightened man's dream. Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem. Let me not say too much or do too much. Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch. I'm praying a out-of-body experience will happen. So the people can see my light, now it's not just rapping. God, I have humbled myself before the court. Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort. I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams. One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me. When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me. One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me. When I was negotiating with Apple, it was Larry and me. Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see. I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov. I heard it's the way they did it when we only had the stove. But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks. Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'mma never go broke. Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go. We all go. Not just by myself, looking for niggas like where's Waldo. She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo.

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky. [Verse 1: Kanye West]. Man, man, man. If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him. After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up. Let's go back, back to the Gap. Look at my check, wasn't no scratch. So if I stole, wasn't my fault. Yeah I stole, never got caught. They take me to the back and pat me. Askin' me about some khakis. But let some black people walk in. I bet they show off their token blackie. Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store. Saw him on break next to the 'No Smoking' sign with a blunt and a Marl'. Takin' my hits, writin' my hits. Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind. This fuckin' job can't help him. So I quit, y'all welcome. Y'all don't know my struggle. Y'all can't match my hustle. You can't catch my hustle. You can't fathom my love dude. Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers. That's a different world like three summers. I deserve to do these numbers. The kid that made that deserves that Mayback. So many records in my basement. I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow. [Hook: GLC]. I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit. I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky. I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit. I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky. [Verse 2: Consequence]. Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky. Let's go, yeah. And I didn't even try to work a job. Represent the mob. At the same time thirsty on the grind. Chi state of mind. Lost my momma, lost my mind. +My life, my love+ that's not mine. Why you ain't signed?. Wasn't my time. Leave me alone, work for y'all. Half of it's yours, half of it's mine. Only one to ball. Never one to fall. Gotta get mine. Gotta take mine. Got a tech nine. Reach my prime. Gotta make these haters respect mine. In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule wore headset nine. Puttin' known ass on shelves. Waitin' paitently I ask myself. Qhere I wanna go, where I wanna be. Life is much more than runnin' in the streets. Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat. Put me on my feet. Sound so sweet. Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee. Stayin' low key, nope. Holler at God ""Man why'd you had to take my folks?"". Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G. Love my G, Rolly G. Police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's. Got a lot of people countin' on me. And I'm just tryin' to find my peace. Should of finished school like my niece. Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow. Aw man, all this pressure. [Hook: GLC]. I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit. I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky. I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit. I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky. [Verse 3: Consequence]. I remember havin' to take the dollar cab. Comin' home real late at night. Standin' on my feet all damn day. Tryin' to make this thing right. And havin' one of my co-workers say ""Yo you look just like. This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night"". Well easy come, easy go. How that sayin' goes. No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows. I all had that snatched from me. And all the faculties all turn their back on me. And didn't wanna hear a rap from me. So naturally actually had to face things factually. Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me. Cuz nothing's there, nothing's fair. I don't wanna ever go back there. So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off. [Hook: GLC]. I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit. I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky. I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit. I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky. [Outro: GLC]. I wanna fly, I wanna fly. I said I want my chariot to pick me up. And take me brother for a ride"

Had a beautiful night, until a storm done made it ugly. And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and its ugly. Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly. I'm ready to turn it up in the streets and make it ugly. Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these chickens that were ugly. And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly. Say things that were ugly in regards to their tummies. But I took it all back, cuz God don't like ugly. Now I'm curbin my bad words, they say that the bad burn. I left it on bad terms, with a chic with a bad perm. Whose case took a bad turn, and face caught a bad burn. And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs. The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and bout it. But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it. So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood. But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood. And once it get bad, it be bad for good. THAT'S BAD MEANING BAD NOT BAD MEANING GOOD. But I greet it as good, when you leave with the good. Its all good in the hood, got called good cuz I'm good. Now I'm havin some good nights, livin this good life. Got me a good girl that I'm gon make me a good wife. So I'm, good to go, and I'm good where I go. Look my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know. And he came home for good, off of good behavior. Spittin that good game, so what's good with this paper. And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies. We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly. Chorus"

He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feeling. Well let me be the first to get mine. [Verse 2: Common]. I was born by a lake, chicken shack, and a church. That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt. Gawdly, I know she wanna test the 'Rari. Eye on a dollar like Illuminati. Life is foggy, tryna see through the mist of it. Could have been livin' it, you was Mrs. Mischievous. This is just a letter to better your development. Situation delicate. [Verse 3: Pusha T]. Some claim God body, blame Illuminati. All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair. Yeah, all Sonny no Cher, only solitaires. You clusterfucks could cluster up. On tippy-toe and still not muster up. So it's ashes to ashes, dust to dust. In God we trust, the game is all us. 'til the sky calls or it's flames on us, Push. [Hook]. I'm getting this nigga in the morning. He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when. He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feeling. Well let me be the first to get mine. [Verse 4: 2 Chainz]. 2 Chainz. I'm chillin' in my camo, flippin' through the channel. On my GOOD Music shit, my logo's a Lambo. Four doors of ammo, ammunition I'm pitching. To make your body switch another position. [Verse 5: CyHi Da Prince]. I hope the people is listening, I could never sell my soul. I gave it back to God at my christening. It's tickelin' when I hear what haters be whisperin'. What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?. Fake friends and siblings. Like to wish you well but ain't never flip the nickel in. Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car. But you can't spell war without an A-R. 15 I was pushing carts at K-Mart. By 21 they said I'd be inside a graveyard. Can't wait to get that black American Express. So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card. [Break: Kid Cudi and Kanye West]. Yeah, you feelin' on top now, getting that money nigga?. (You sold your soul). Yeah, you feelin' on top now, getting that money nigga?. (You sold your soul). Yeah, you feelin' on top now, getting that money nigga?. (Naw man, mad people was frontin'. Aw man, made something from nothing). [Outro: Kanye West]. I treat the label like money from my shows. GOOD woulda been God except I added more O's. If I knew she was cheatin' and still bought her more clothes. It's cause I was too busy with my Baltimore, you know. Some people call that the art of war, you know. I guess it depends what you fallin' for, the clothes?. Cars, money, girls and the clothes. Aw money, you sold your soul. Nah man, mad people was frontin'. Goddamn, we made something from nothing"

"the one (feat. big sean, 2 chainz & marsha ambrosius)","[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]. The storm is on the horizon. I'm standing here alone. Got a pistol on my hip. And it's gon' be some shit. If you want it then bring it on. See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier. And I'mma be here till it's done. And when they asking who I'm is, shit. You just tell them that I'm the one. (One, one, one). Tell them that I'm the one. (One, one, one). Tell them that I'm the one. [Verse 1: Kanye West]. I'm the one, baby. Yeah, I'm the one, baby. Since God gave his only begotten son, baby. It's hard preachin' the gospel to the slums lately. So I had to put the church on the drums, baby. You on a run, baby. You on a run, baby. You think you free but you a slave to the funds, baby. You think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?. Mhm that's cool but I been runnin on the sun, baby. We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit. That's my reality so get off my Scott Disick. If you ever held a title belt you would know how Michael felt. Tyson, Jackson, Jordan - Michael Phelps. Yeahhh, had to take it to another 'round. Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed. Best way to describe my position is at the helm. Best way to describe my new whip - Yeeeaaaalmmp. [Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]. The storm is on the horizon. I'm standing here alone. Got a pistol on my hip. And it's gon' be some shit. If you want it then bring it on. See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier. And I'mma be here till it's done. And when they asking who I'm is, shit. You just tell them that I'm the one. (One, one, one). Tell them that I'm the one. (One, one, one). Tell them that I'm the one. [Verse 2: Big Sean]. I told Detroit I'mma fuckin' get it. I told my brother we'll be fuckin' winnin'. Ye told me I'm the man for the job. So I told my mom, call her's up and tell 'em that she quittin'. Started off in that Chevrolet, but it's Ferraris I gotta drive. I'm on HBO I'm on Entourage,I'm 5'9'' fuckin' 9 to 5. I need a hundred million no compromise. I'm a double X L nigga : magazine and condom size. See what I seen and be traumatized. I don't wait, I marinate, variate erryday. Every state, sold out, fuck around and need a barricade. My weed loud I need a hearing aid. Livin' life behind a pair of shades. I be a billionaire if I could get a dollar. For all the bullshit that I hear a day. I did it. [Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]. The storm is on the horizon. I'm standing here alone. Got a pistol on my hip. And it's gon' be some shit. If you want it then bring it on. See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier. And I'mma be here till it's done. And when they asking who I'm is, shit. You just tell them that I'm the one. (One, one, one). Tell them that I'm the one. (One, one, one). Tell them that I'm the one. [Verse 3: 2 Chainz]. Treat the back seat like a sofa bed. Break bread with my niggas, call it profit share. This some good shit, but it get better. And yeah my bitch cold, nigga thin sweater. Like my verse suede and the beat leather. Just tryin' to stay above sea level. When my nigga went to jail, I said, ""Free Gucci"". I done bought so much shit, I should get free Gucci. Bought my baby momma anaconda bags. I shouldn't have bought it all. I should've went and cut the grass. Snake ass niggas in my fuckin' face. Bring your girl here nigga so I could fuck her face. Yeah I run this place, this is cash mill swag. Niggas treadmillin' goin' nowhere fast. Sittin' courtside at the Hawks game. Louis on, I could trip a fuckin' ball player. [Outro: James Fauntleroy]. Fuck yeah, awesome, yeah I lost some of my mind. And then I found peace it was really kind of awesome. It's possible, goddamn right. I've been on this the whole time"
they say,"[Chorus: John Legend]. They say ""What's happenin'?"". We say the facts and if, they lie.... We comin' back for them. They might say... but they don't know!. (They say, They say...). They don't knowwwww. [Verse 1: Common]. They say a nigga lost his mind. But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme. The thin line between love and hatred. I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life. They say life is what you make it. So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it. As high as the stakes get when paper get low. I be tellin Derick, ""Tell Kara get us a show"". Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low. The richest man aint necessarily the nigga wit dough. They say ""You ripped"" ""Wow..."" Yea, that's what they say. My niggaz couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray. Paintin a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine. They say ""Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes"". I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye. They never could say - tell 'em, J. [Chorus]. [Verse 2: Kanye West]. Ahh... The sweet taste of victory. Go head and breath it in like antihistamine. I know they sayin ""Damn, Yay snapped wit this beat!"". Fuck you expect? I've got a history. Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!. Haters back down, gotta be that steel!. I know they cant wait till ya outta ya deal!. Look how they did D'Angelo ask em how do it feel!. My best friends worry bout me. Cause they know when you famous/fame-ass. And you had made cash the media aims at us and you be up so high. if you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash. But God don't ever give me nothin I cant handle. So please don't ever give me records I cant sample. So I could vacate where it aint no channels. but it's quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals. They say because of the fame and stardom. I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum. I guess it's messin with my health then. And this verse so crazy when I finish. I'm just gon check myself in - again. [Chorus]. [Kanye West:] ""Uh!"" (hey!). [Verse 3: Common]. They say ""Dude think he righteous"". I write just to free minds, from Stoney to Rikers. Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is. On my paper, whether its weed or Isis. They say ""life is a game,"" so I play hard. Writin for my life cause I'm scared of a day job. They say ""Sef kept the hood together"". I tell the young, ""We can't play the hood forever"". Play my cards right, they say I went to left. They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F. Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights. Now I claim ""King"" like Don, or Frank White. They say my life is comparable to Christ's. The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice. They say ""The crochet pants and the sweater was wack"". Seen ""The Corner"", now they say ""That nigga's back,"" uh.... [Chorus]"
this way,"[Kanye West] + (Choir). Now turn it up, turn it up (a little louder). turn it uuuuup, turn it up (little louder). now turn it up (can't live my, I, I can't live my).

Our moves calculated through the lens, almost here. succes will be the best revenge. man, from Clint East' to Kanye West (whut up, whut up!). the sun can't chill but everyday it sets (everyday!). [Chorus - Male Choir] + (Female Choir). this time I made up my mind. this time I'm back on my prime. I know there's thing in my life. that I'ma let go startin tonight. (I can't live my, I, I can't live my). (I can't live my, I, I can't live my). I can't live my, I, I can't live my.

[Kanye West]. Kanye Chedda. My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend. my freak girl told me ""now, she a christian"". my white girl wanna move back to Michigan. I'm pullin girls off the bench like a sixth man. I'm in the club doin the same ol' two step. while Omegas doin the same ol' ""Q"" step. I have my money on my mind I was thinkin green. she a pledge A.K.A. ""she was pink and green"". I wanna a good girl she want a gentleman. we sayin' the same thing like a synonym. I wasn't really spittin game I was scrimaging. my penmanship's so hard it needs censorship. I'ma Chicagoan till Chicago ends. till we blow like Chicago wind. I don't know what's better, gettin laid or gettin paid. I just know when I'm gettin one, the other's gettin away. this way. [Chorus]. [Rakaa Iriscience). Go 'head, flip a coin so the game don't stop. believe I know the drama, kid name the part. I learnt before the hot flame came the spark. it's like 'fore the pop fame came the park. but this industry'll play with yo' life man. they playin with yo' rent, food, water and lights man (yeah). that's why Rakaa brings it like that ol' ""Tidy T"" jam. the battleram, then I'm off to Amsterdam. to rest up for strength to deal with this weight. to deal with these deals to deal with this hate. I dedicate this Jam Master Jay. Run-D.M.C. showed me how to walk, this way. [Chorus]. [Kanye West & Rakaa speak in Outro]"
through the wire,"Kanye West -. Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?. Can they huh?. I spit it through the wire man. To much stuff on my heart right now man. I'll probably risk it all right now. It's a life or death situation man. Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man. It's your boy Kayne to the..... Chi-Town what's going on man. [Verse 1]. I drink a Boost for breakfast, and Ensure for dizzert. Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp. That right there could drive a sane man beserk. Not to worry the Mr. H to the Izz-O's back to wizzerk. How do you console my mom or give her light support. Telling her your sons' on life support. And just imagine how my girl feel. On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like EMMITT TILL. She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine. She a delta so she been throwing that dynasty sign. No use of me tryna be lyin. I been trying to be signed. Trying to be a millionaire. How I use two lifelines. In the same hospital where Biggie smalls died. The doctor said I had blood clots. But I ain't Jamaican man. Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band. I swear this right here, history in the making man. I really apologize how I sound right now man. This ain't fair at all man. They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks. You know we had reconstru..... I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw. Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth. I couldn't believe it. But im still here for yall right now man. This is what I gotta say yo. Yeah, turn me up yeah. [Verse 2]. What if somebody from the shadow. that was ill got a deal. on the hottest rap label around. but he wasn't talking bout coke and birds. it was more like spoken word. Except he really putting it down. And he explained the story. about how blacks came from glory. And what we need to do in the game. Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time. In the blink of an eye his whole life changed. If you could feel how my face felt. you would know how Mase felt. Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt. I swear to God drive a two on the sue. I got a lawyer for the case to keep whats in my safe-safe. My dawgs couldn't tell if I,. I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky. IT WAS TELEVISED. THERE'S BEEN AN accident like GEICO. They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael. I must gotta angel. Cause look how death missed his ass. Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass. Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past. Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash. And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid. Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did. But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph. Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire. Know what im saying. When the doctor told me I had a um.. I was goin to have to have a plate on my chin. I said dawg don't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now. Its bad enough I got all this jewelry on. You can't be serious man"

Let me see you one more time. [Hook]. [Verse 2: Kanye West]. Mmm ain't this some shit ? Pulled up in the A-V-entador. And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord. Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score. This a ghetto opera, Francis Ford Car Coppola. I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that. Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs. Like, ""These niggas tryna hold me back. These niggas tryna hold me back"", I'm just trying to protect my stacks. Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax. Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back. Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axle Foley at?. ""Ease up there baby boy"", Ving Rhames told Jody that. R. Kelly and the God of rap. Shitting on you, holy crap. [Hook]. [Outro: Teyana Taylor]. I could give it all up, but it's not enough. Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger. To the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon. Here's to the mountains, yeah here's to the room. Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me.

touch the sky (feat. lupe fiasco),"[Chorus 1]. I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly. For the day I die, I'mma touch the sky. Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly. For the day I die, I'mma touch the sky. Back when they thought pink polo's would hurt the Roc,. Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed.. I felt like Bad Boy's street team,. I couldn't work the Lox (locks).. Now let's go.. Take 'em back to the plan.... Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van.. Any pessimists I ain't talked to them,. Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.. Let's take 'em back to the club.. Least about an hour I would stand on line,. I just wanted to dance.. I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.. I just wanted to shine.. Jay's favorite line: ""Dog, in due time"". Now he look at me, like ""Damn, dog, you where I am"". A hip hop legend.. I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.. [Chorus]. [Hook 1 (Lupe Fiasco)]. Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la. (Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world). Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la. (Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world). Back when Gucci was the shit to rock,. Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop,. I'd do anything to say ""I got it"".. Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket.. Before anybody wanted K-West beats,. Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC.. Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns,. Like ""Damn, these niggas that much better than me?"". Baby, I'm going on an airplane,. And I don't know if I'll be back again.. Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets,. But when she came to kick it, things became different.. Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on.. I couldn't keep it home,. I thought I needed a Nia Long.. I'm trying to write my wrongs,. But it's funny these same wrongs. Helped me write this song.. Now,. [Chorus 2]. I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly. For the day you die, You gonna touch the sky. (You gonna touch the sky babygirl!). Testify, come up in the spot. Looking extra fly. For the day you die, You gonna touch the sky. [Lupe Fiasco]. Yes, yes, yes guess who's on third?. Lupe still like Lupin the Third.. Hear life here till I'm beer on the curb. Peach fuzz buzz but bit on the verge. Hold it down like we're on the serve. Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth's.. But, before you say another word,. I'm back on the block like a man on the street.. I'm trying to stop lying like a Mum-Ra,. But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat.. Engarde, Touch© Lupe cool as the Unthar,. But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge.. I come as correct as a porn star,. In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.. So, I represent the first.. Now, let me hear my verse right where the horns are like. [Chorus 2]. (We back at home, baby). Sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. Sky, Sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. Yeah! (Keep it rollin). (Feels good to be home, baby! Feels good to be home!)"

we don't care,"[Chorus]. [Kanye West:]. And all my people thats drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high. We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive. Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say. [Verse One:]. If this is your first time hearing this. You are about to experience something cold man. We never had nothing handed took nothing for granted. Took nothing from no man, man i'm my own man. But as a shorty i looked up to the dopeman. Only adult man i knew that wasnt a broke man. Flickin starter coats man, Man you ount no man. We don't care what people say. This is for my niggas outside all winter. Cuz this summer they aint finna to say next summer im finna. Sittin in the hood like community colleges. This dope money here is Lil Treys scholarship. Cause aint no to tuition for havin no ambition. And aint no loans for sittin your ass at home. So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job. You gotta do something man your ass is grown. [Chorus]. [Kanye West:]. Drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high. Kids Sing Kids Sing. . [Kanye and Kids:]. We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive. Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say. [Verse Two:]. The second verse is for my dogs working 9 to 5. That still hustle cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55. And everybody selling make-up, Jacobs. And bootleg tapes just to get they cake up. We put shit on layaway then come back. We claim other kids on our income tax. We take that money cop work than push packs to get paid. And we don't care what people say. Momma say she wanna move south. Scratchin lottery tickets Eyes on a new house. Around the same time Doe ran up in dudes house. Couldnt get a job. So since he couldnt get work he figured hed take work. The drug game bolemic its hard to get weight. So niggas money is homo its hard to get straight. So we gon keep baking to the day we get cake.. And we dont care what people say. My Niggas. [Chorus]. [Kanye West and Kids:]. Drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high. Kids Sing Kids Sing. We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive. Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say. [Verse Three:]. You know the kids gonna act a fool. When you stop the programs for after school. And they DCFS them some of them dislecsic. They favorite 50 Cent song's 12 Questions. We scream, rock, blows, weed park. so now we smart. We aint retards the way teachers taught. Hold up hold fast we make mo'cash. Now tell my momma i belong in the slow class. It's bad enough we on welfare. You trying to put me on the school bus with the space for the wheel chair. Im trying to get the car with the chromy wheels here. You tryin to cut our lights like we dont live here. Look at whats handed us our fatheres abandoned us. When we get the hammers gone and call the ambulance. Sometimes i feel no one in this world understands us. But we dont care what people say. My Niggas. [Chorus]. [Kanye West and Kids:]. drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high. Kids Sing Kids Sing. We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive.

we major,"[Chorus]. You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up and watch how we roll up and. I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts. I take a sip of that yak, I wanna fuck. I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck. But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing. Towel under the door smoke until the days end. Puff, puff then pass, don't fuck up rotation. Hpnotic for Henny, now nigga that's your chaser. Turn nothin to something now pimpin' that's a savior. Best things are green now pimp and get your paper. High off the ground instead of skyscraper. Too low thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major. We major (come on, homie, we major) [repeat]. Feeling better than some head on a sunday afternoon. Better than a chick that say yes to soon. Until you have a daughter, that's what I call karma. And you pray to god she don't grow breasts too soon.. Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up. Niggas hats broke off that's how we grow up. Why else you think shorty's write rhymes just to blow up?. Get they first car and then IRS show up. He ain't never had shit but he had that nine. Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine. Put two and two together in a little bad weather. Gon' be a whole family on that funeral line. Ask the reverand was the strip club cool if my tips help send a pretty girl through school. That's all I want like wino's want they good whisky. I ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me. [chorus]. [Nas:]. I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write. First line, should it be about the hos or the ice?. Four-four's or black christ? Both flows would be nice. Rap about big paper or the black man's plight. At the studio consol asked my man to the right. What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?. He said, Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic. Picked up the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel. Been like 12 years since a nigga first signed. Now I'm a free agent. And I'm thinking it's time. To build my very own Motown. Cuz rappers be deprived of executive 9 to 5s. And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life. And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic. So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt. I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony where King got killed. I survived the livest niggas around. Lasting longer than more than half of you clowns. Look, I used to cook before I had the game took. Either way my change came like Sam Cooke.. Feeling better than I ever felt before today. Like better late than never is orientation. Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away. [chorus]"

white dress,"Just me and you girl. (Wooooah oooh). Just me and you girl. (Wooooah oooh). Tryna sneak upstairs to your apartment. Aren't you a sight for red eyes. I just flew in and slipped in on your left side. Just a satin gown, you asleep with no makeup. I'm just tryna be inside you ‘fore you wake up. Just me and you girl. (Wooooah oooh). Just me and you girl. (Wooooah oooh). We have problems but thats all in the past. Everybody got problems baby I got a past. Remember I used to do things that would make you laugh. Like ordering girl drinks in a masculine glass. You like pina coladas, getting caught in the rain. Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain. Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains. And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name. But they never let us do our thing. Everybody lying on who I bang. We was on fire but they blew our flame. Ain't no denying baby you have changed. Cause now your high heels clicking. Your lip gloss glisten. Your hips start switching. You're pissed off, tripping. Cause even when we're kissing baby girl feel different. Friends all diss him like ‘no he didn't?'. No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?. Is that bitch still stripping?. Tryna to get a pair of Christian's?. I swear to God that they got you going crazy. But you play it off and say how it's work baby. Well some of the models is too coked to walk straight. But seem to still love the man that they all hate. But babe I call you back and say that you say that always. It kept me on the phone and demanded they always. See, she knew about all my lies the whole time. Now my credit so bad I can't get no one to co-sign. I woulda thought she woulda busted a dope crime. But she up and left a nigga and she aint give me no sign. Now she back in the club in a tight dress. With dreams of someday wearing a white dress. Seen with some lame, it's a miracle that she'a talk to a nigga. With a ten year ago swag. Plus I don't like none of her girlfriends. Quote unquote cause her girlfriends got girlfriends. On the phone hollin' at niggas is watever. Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever. Now she headed to Rome, Rome is the home. Rome is where she act like she aint got no fucking phone. I accept that I was wrong, except a nigga grown. So I can't bitch and moan in a session gettin stoned. So a nigga had to hop on a plane. A bus and a train to try and come talk and explain. Rented the whole bottom floor for a candle light dinner. Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her. And told her even though I met you in a club in a tight dress. At first sight I can picture you in a white dress. 30 foot train, diamond from Lorraine. Just to make up for all the years and the pain. Family on both sides I'm so glad you came. Auntie couldn't make it, oh no, thats a shame. Wedding in June, what could be better. Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever. Take the very last car of the Eurostar. Tell the conductor just drive so far. Told some of your friends and they wasn't excited. Well we'll go to the country side and they won't be invited. We will not be disturbed by the fussing and fighting. Tell peaches light the herb, we just re-united, we just re-united. Lets make a move on these herds, go somewhere private. I'm talking just me and you and a plane and a pilot"

wouldn't get far,"[Intro: samples from ""I'd Find You Anywhere""]. For you baby, I'd find you [4X]. You wouldn't get far. [The Game]. I done been around the world, been around the block. Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac. Like Vida Guerrera, ass took her to the top. She'll give you some brains you let her throw up the Roc. Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cock. Picture that like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx. Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set. Putting oil on her likes like she Gloria Velez. She was (Eye Candy) in the XXL. Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell. I knew she {""wouldn't get far""} cause five hundred dollars. can't get you that {""far""} how you get that {""far""}. And all these new video bitches trying to be Melissa Ford. But they don't know Melissa Ford drive a Honda Accord. She a video vixen, but behind closed doors. She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards. Ha ha. [Chorus: The Game]. {""You wouldn't get far""} Fucking them rap stars. You know who you are, put your hands up ladies. {""You wouldn't get far""} If you kept your legs closed. {""It would be best to wait your turn""} But you know. {""You wouldn't get far""} Fucking them rap stars. You know who you are, I wrote this song for you. {""For you baby, I'd find you""} For you. And you, for alla y'all. [Kanye West]. For you... uhh... Pop quiz, how many topless, black foxes. did I have under my belt, like boxers. Not to brag but, if it add up. One, two, nigga that's mad nuts. Game you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these. bitches knowing damn well they gon' call me?. The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen. was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen. Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team. Head so good he don't ask for a pre.. nup. Now ask yourself this question, umm. Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O. Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo. Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo. Well why the hell you think these bitches coming at me fo'?. But since they all fall in my palm, I take a trio. Yo. [Chorus - sub ""mouth closed"" for ""legs closed""]. [The Game]. I done had my share of bitches with long hair. Short doo like Kalissa, Halle in ""Boomerang"" yeah. I been around the block in the Bentley drop top. In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fucking with Scott. I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case. She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes. And ain't nobody trying to take Beyonce from Jay. But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day. The things niggaz do when pussy sitting on they face. Stabbed Un in the stomach. She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman, on that superhero shit. Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'. Impala, forget the double D's. I put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Takara. And she ain't win the show but she riding in that Galata. That's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow. [Chorus]. [The Game]. God damn! Y'knahmsayin?. I'm sitting back watching Kanye video. And I see the same bitch that was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video. Then I flip the muh'fuckin channel. Checking out my uncle Snoop Dogg video. And I see the same BITCH, that was in my video! Y'knowhatI'msayin?. And then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up. I'm watching Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina. I see the same bitch on Oprah, floating away on the hood of a Camry. That was in the nigga Lil Weezy video!. I mean DAMN! Everywhere I look. Everywhere I go I see the same hoes. Don't get mad, I'm only being real. Yeah"
wouldn't leave,"I don't feel that she's mine enough. God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up. Butterfly in my wrist, you make me run out of my skin. And I don't feel like. And I know you wouldn't leave. They say, ""build your own""—I said, ""how, sway? "". I said, ""slavery a choice""—they said, ""how, 'ye? "". Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day. Now I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls. My wife callin', screamin', say, ""we 'bout to lose it all! "". Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe. Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave. And I know you wouldn't leave. When somethin' frees. We doin' such things. We could wait longer than this. Yes, you know you're one of these. We can run through with the top chopped, yeah. And the sundress down, ooh. And I know you wouldn't leave. Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental. You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental. Every time somethin' happen, they want me sent to mental. We had an incident but I cover incidentals. You want me workin' on my messagin'. When I'm thinkin' like george jetson. But soundin' like george jefferson. Then they questionin' my methods then. If you tweakin' out on my texts again. Then I don't get reception here. I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere. I use the same attitude that done got us here. I live for now, I don't know what happen after here. I live for now, I don't know what happen after here. Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be. Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy. I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries. One and one is two but me and you, that's infinity. And I know you wouldn't leave. I don't feel like she's mine enough. God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up. Butterfly in my wrist. You make me run out of my skin (run out of my skin). And I don't feel like (uhh). And I know you wouldn't leave (love me or hate me). For any guy that ever fucked up (love me or hate me). Ever embarrassed they girl (love me or hate me). Ever embarrassed they wife (gone when you miss me). She told you not to do that shit (ohh). She told you you's gon' fuck the money up. But you ain't wanna listen, did you?. Keep that same energy. Keep that same energy. Keep that same energy. Now you testin' her loyalty. This what they mean when they say. ""for better or for worse"", huh?. For every down female that stuck with they dude. Through the best times, through the worst times. This for you. And I know you wouldn't leave"
wouldn't you like to ride,"[intro (kanye west)]. You like to ride... (uh). (so ""why don't) you and your friends (get with) me and my friends"". ""(my friends) my friends, my friends, my friends"". Would you like to ride?. (i don't know what happened, it's just like, heh). ""so why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"". ""my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"". [kanye west]. I had that little ass nissan at your crib showin' up. Liquor store out of arbor mist, we irish rosed it up. Then we rolled to the movies, you rocked your fake chloes. You had gap and gucci, that's still two g's. But that's that last year purse like it's still too cheap. Ooh you so boozy boo you could of fooled me. Cuz five years ago you was so fugees. Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few g's. You like the light-skinned ania, the dark-skinned aaliyah. The black jennifer lopez, a ghetto senorita. You remind me of my jeep but not no kia. We can talk on your cell, but not nokia. It be goin' in and out, that's why i barely hear ya. It be goin' in and out like a robbery ah. I'm tryin' to +take this money+ like +robin geeda+. Then i'ma +take you to the house+ like +trick and trina+. [hook]. Would you like to ride shotgun in the escalade. ""so why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"". ""my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"". Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away. ""so why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"". ""my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"". [malik yusef]. Malik yusef, bet your baby momma know the name. The most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game. I give you words spit with flames. Stay to myself and let nerves mix with lames. Connoisseur of kama sutra, do somethin' absurd with your dame. I used to love this girl who loved shoppin' and smokin' herb. But my job was to hustle 'dro. Now an artist of the spoken word, i just hustle flow. Never a preety boy, always a +beautiful mind+ like russell crowe. Now you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go. I would love for you and your friends to get with me and my friends. But the problemo is your attitude be on the stank side. And i no longer like you. Fuck it, now you can't ride but ooh, wouldn't you like to. [hook]. Would you like to ride shotgun in the escalade. ""so why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"". ""my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"". Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away. ""so why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"". ""my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"". [common]. Deep as the ocean is the motion of life. Thought you would have been the sister i chose for my wife. Not knowin' you was trife. Stiflin' a nigga's growth. All you wanna do is shop at river oaks. Watch soaps on the couch, take shit and smoke. I'm workin' hard like a fiend tryin' to get some dope. Thought my +real nigga quotes+ would make you truer. You ain't gon' let me school ya, at least let me tutor. The sex is good, but you ain't a shooter. There's a war goin' on inside, you ain't a trooper. I look through the mirror and see my reflection. It ain't in your direction so i passed her like a reverend. Return to my bitch and wine ways goin' wild like west and kanye. Wherever i lay my kufi is my home, goddamnit i'm grown. Broke broad i'ma leave your ass alone. You still wanna ride though. [hook]. Would you like to ride shotgun in the escalade. ""so why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"". ""my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"". Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away. ""so why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"". ""my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"". Would you like to ride shotgun in the escalade. ""so why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"". ""my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"". Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away. ""so why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"". ""my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"""

ye vs. the people (feat. t.i.),"Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I had for us. You turned my dreams into dust. I watch a phone that I had for us. You turned my dreams into dust. I know Obama was heaven-sent. But ever since Trump won, it proved that I could be president. Yeah, you can, at what cost though?. Don't that go against the teachings that Ye taught for?. Yo, Tip, I hear your side and everybody talk though. But ain't goin' against the grain everything I fought for?. Prolly so, Ye, but where you tryna go with this?. It's some shit you just don't align with and don't go against. You just readin' the headlines, you don't see the fine print. You on some choosin'-side shit, I'm on some unified shit. It's bigger than your selfish agenda. If your election ain't gon' stop police from murderin' niggas. Then shit…. Bruh, I never ever stopped fightin' for the people. Actually, wearin' the hat'll show people that we equal. You gotta see the vantage point of the people. What makes you feel equal makes them feel evil. See that's the problem with this damn nation. All Blacks gotta be Democrats, man. We ain't made it off the plantation. Fuck who you choose as your political party. You representin' dudes just seem crude and cold-hearted. With blatant disregard for the people who put you in position. Don't you feel an obligation to them?. I feel a obligation to show people new ideas. And if you wanna hear 'em, there go two right here. Make America Great Again had a negative perception. I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction. Added empathy, care and love and affection. And y'all simply questionin' my methods. What you willin' to lose for the point to be proved?. This shit is stubborn, selfish, bullheaded, even for you. You wore a dusty-ass hat to represent the same views. As white supremacy, man, we expect better from you. All them times you sounded crazy, we defended you, homie. Not just to be let down when we depend on you, homie. That's why it's important to know what direction you're goin' now. 'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down. You think I ain't concerned about how I affect the past?. I mean, that hat stayed in my closet like 'bout a year and a half. Then one day I was like, ""Fuck it, I'ma do me. "". I was in the sunken place and then I found the new me. Not worried about some image that I gotta keep up. Lot of people agree with me, but they're too scared to speak up. The greater good of the people is first. Have you considered all the damage and the people you hurt?. You had a bad idea and you're makin' it worse. This shit's just as bad as Catholic preachers rapin' in church. Y'all been leadin' with hate, see I just approach it different. Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand. I know everybody emotional. Is it better if I rap about crack? Huh? 'Cause it's cultural?. Or how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?. Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich?. You'll deal with God for the lack of respect. Startin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check. Now you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that. What's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit?. Okay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bitch. Yeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget. And all that free thought shit, find a better defense. But if Ye just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that. Fuck it. Alright, Tip, we could be rappin' about this all day, man. Why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?"

They been strategizin' to harm me. They don't know they dealin' with a zombie. Niggas been tryna test my gandhi. Just because I'm dressed like abercrombie. You see? you see?. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's why I fuck with ye. That's my third person. That's my bipolar shit, nigga what?. That's my superpower, nigga ain't no disability. I'm a superhero! I'm a superhero!. Agghh!"
