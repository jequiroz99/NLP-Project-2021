I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go. I mean for real, fuck how you feel. Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill, yeah. And everyday I wake up celebratin' shit, why?. Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch. I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich. That's what put me on, that's what got me here. That's what made me this. And everything that I do is my first name. These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain. Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me. I just bought a crib, three stories, that bitch a trilogy. And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone. I got a bitch that text me, she ain't got no clothes on.

Got a million things on my mind. Executive deals online, limited amount of time. Chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind. You liable to find me up in the Mgm casino in the D. Fuckin' off fetti I coulda put on property. From the Bay to the Murder Mitten. My niggas put murder missions. She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison. On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit. For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich. Got a blunt in my dental, goin' Ham in a rental. On my way, to Sacramento, late night, Arsenio. I'm never sentimental, go hard or go home, listen. Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless. I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me. I'll make a bitch stand outside forever. Like the Statue of Liberty. Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South. I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drank in my mouth. Why you always coming around with bad news?. Say you want me to win, but hope I lose. Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew. But them niggas cool, it's just that. [Hook: Big Sean]. I don't fuck with you. You little stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you. You little dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you. I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do.

Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do. [Verse 3: Big Sean]. I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for. I got a new whip that I gotta thank a lot for. Yeah I got a lot but want a lot more. Yeah we in the buildin' but I'm tryna take it to the top floor. I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up. It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up. That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl. I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up. I guess drama makes for the best content. Everything got a bad side, even a conscience. Now you're drinkin' 'til your unconscious. Feel me when you get a fine bitch. Just don't forget to read the fine print. Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas. Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator. Yeah I know that karma's too real so I hope you doin' cool. But still stupid ass bitch I ain't fuckin' with you. Little stupid ass I ain't fuckin with. I ain't fuckin', I ain't I ain't fuckin' with you. I ain't fuckin' with you"
blessings (feat. drake & kanye west),"[Intro]. Look, I feel blessed. Way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed. Straight up. [Verse 1: Big Sean]. I live the life I deserve, bless. Fuck a vacay I feel better at work. I mean whatever it's worth. I give whatever I'm worth. For my niggas who gonna go to Hell and back for me. I'mma give em Heaven on Earth for a hell of a check. Yeah whichever come first. Blessings on blessings on blessings. Look at my life man thats lessons on lessons on lessons. I treat the beat like its a reverend. I tell the truth like father forgive me these are all my confessions. Man this wasn't luck it was destined. I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd, and Eddy. Who flip like confetti and then when you back they back to call you dog. That shit get get petty, bitch don't give no dap to me nigga. Funny thing about talkin' behind my back. Is that it just keep comin' back to me nigga. Was all for a sec now its back to me nigga. You mad at me, this ain't what I want man this what it had to be. This is that late night workin' after three. Man this why my old girl was mad at me. This why I'm your majesty. Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy's the tightest. The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest. The feat not divided, the love is divided. And I just got it, thank God that we got it, blessed. I don't know what I would do without it. Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits. Your prophet will profit, oh God. [Hook: Drake]. I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I. I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I. I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed. I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed. [Verse 2: Drake]. Look, I ain't gonna say that we back or nothin'. Cuz that implies that we're back from somethin'. If we're back from somethin' its some checks you owe us. I expect that payment, nothin' less or over. I dont need them favors that you ask me for. I could give two fucks bout' where the Grammy's go. I just gave out Grammy's on my Instagram. Them Ovo boys the business man. It is what it is, trust me you get what you give. You gotta come to my side and see how we live. I cannot see Heaven bein' much better than this. Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the Six. Look at what we did. Be quiet I'm doin' a toast. For niggas that don't really do shit I swear y'all be doin' the most. Stop worryin' about whoever's next. I am just worried about my mama worryin' less. I think I'm famous enough, I don't need anymore press. I am convinced I'm the only one left thats still doin' this shit man. [Hook: Drake]. [Verse 3: Big Sean]. My grandma just died I'm the man of the house. So every mornin' I'm up cause I can't let them down. Always down for the cause, never down for the count. I guess when your stars align you do like the solar system. and plan it out. So I'm goin' overtime on the overtime. Yeah I'm not invested but you can't attest it. Million dollar goals, man its to manifest it. The family never goin' anorexic. I pay my mortgage and electric. Never goin' under even with anesthetics. At the top of the rap game and progressin'. Check after check, checkin' off my check list. Try and blow my cake just know thats a death wish. No mistakes in life ever, it? s only lessons. Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together. You tore the game apart who put it back together. [Hook: Drake]. [Verse 4: Kanye West]. Since the truth keep niggas traumatized. They tryna compromise my condom size. So I snapchat that whole shit. Tryin' see titties, tryna show dick. And I swear to God I hope they post it, I'm blessed. Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors. C3po's like Star Wars. They want me by the road holdin' up cardboard. So I go extra hard on the hard floor. Right now callin' you from my home gym. Right after that, nigga I'm gon' swim. Just did a couple laps in my home pool. And my daughter right there gettin' homeschooled. I'm blessed, and I was thinkin' 'bout startin' up my own school. A montessori, and the hallway lookin' like a monastery. Oh yes I'm way up, I feel blessed"

Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place. Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away. You a star, you need space, we can shoot up by the town. Have you ever been to Texas? South By Southwest. Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested. Where they might know us off any intersection. I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest. Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it. No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted. [Verse 4: Big Sean & (Jhene Aiko) ]. I know you've been crying and poutin'. Know you're tired of arguing. But no screaming and shouting. And you know we on a roll like we did good in college. Throwin' hundreds and thousands. Like they not hundreds and thousands. Why? Cause I know you've been going. through some things. (I know you've been going through. some things you can't explain. With your main thing that shit insane. I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame. you can't complain). I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?. (Don't love the same, I know you've been. diving through pain. I know goin' runnin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty. That shit can fuck with your mente. I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you...). [Hook]. The way you move it's like you could use a vacation. Drink in your hand and the harder you dance. I swear right now it look like you on a vacation. Gotta get away, make it happen. Whatever happened just had to happen. On vacation, yeah. I know you've been, I know you've been. [Outro]. I know it look like like you need a vacation. How 'bout Hawaii, maybe Jamaica, maybe Asia. Take you places 'lotta niggas can't take ya. Don't forget the make up. Yeah"

Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back. (You ain't getting checks). Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back. Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back. D town Lax, every week I bounce back. If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back. [Verse 1]. Don't owe nobody, owe nobody. Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies. Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown. Vibin' out more than my phone though. Leave me 'lone, me on my own though. Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit. My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up). I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic. Ya contract should be shredded. Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing. I kept it G, yeah, one thousand. Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain. Everything I do is righteous. Betting on me is the right risk. Even in a fucking crisis. I'm never on some switching sides shit.

(Never sold my soul, never will never have). Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority. If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory. I done did everything except worry. Hella drama, my life story. Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing. I knew that this life was meant for me. Niggas change up more than wishin' wells. Karma come around I'll wish 'em well. Livin' like I'm on a limitless pill. I kill the scene like I'm Denzel. Crazy like my jacket strapped up. Nigga, I don't act but I'll act up. Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up. Back, back, back, back up. Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet. Or get stomped out with ten feet. I'ma always lose my temper. You cannot ""count to ten"" me. If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5. Seen court rooms and court sides, ain't too many seen both sides. Nigga, fuck what you know. Nigga, I'm takin' back control. The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows. Yeah, I call shots while you call off. Never takin' summer or fall off. When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so. Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back. Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks.

one man can change the world (feat. kanye west & john legend),"[hook: big sean]. They used to tell me. I hope you learn to make it on your own. And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone. I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose. I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know. Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything. Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams. And when you get it all just remember one thing. Remember one thing. That one man could change the world. That one man could change the world. [verse 1: big sean]. All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars. And a bad chick. Imagine this so much some nights it felt like that I had it. Back on the mattress. Starin' at the ceilin' tryna to connect the dots. But its hard makin' those attachments. I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day. You know?. My - my step brother used to flip them bags. Outside the crib like it was trash day. No kim k, but he bagged yay (ye). But when you're getting fast money, slow down, don't crash. With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas. Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it. Tell your team about it. Go make million dollar schemes about it. Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance. Used to look up at the stars. And be like ain't too much that's different. I be shinin', they be shinin'. Get your one shot don't you miss it. What you know bout' wakin' up everyday l. Ike you on a mission?. [hook: kanye west]. They used to tell me. I hope you learn to make it on your own.

That one man could change the world. That one man could change the world. [verse 2: big sean]. My grandma told me if you write your name in stone. You'll never get the white out. I grinded out that black hole. Then performed up at the white house. Standin' next to jim carrey, we traded stories then laughed. I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks. Where I'm from I swear they broke. They need way more than the cast. We need more than what you have. And then we need more than that. But how am I supposed to say I'm tired. If that girl from west virginia came up in conditions. That I couldn't survive. Went to war, came back alive. On top of that became a female black captain. When being black you had to extra extra try. Way before james brown made us proud. She bought a crib on the same street as marvin gaye. Right there on outer drive, and she taught me how to drive. And she raised the kids. Then the kids' kids, and she did it right. Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry. When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly. All my life you've been that angel in disguise saying. [hook: john legend]. They used to tell me. I hope you learn to make it on your own. And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone.

How I know? 'Cause I don't write my shit. I think it, my nigga. Look, all I ever did was beat the odds. Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out. Never stopping like we hypnotized. Watch what we visualize on the rise, be the Goat. While we alive when we die, we gon' be the gods. Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it. You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it. Everything lined up for the taking. And what I need from em? No favors. Clique too big, bread? gotta break it. 'Cause these others lowkey with the snaking faking. Everything lined up for the taking. And what I need from 'em?. No favors, no favors. [Verse 2: Eminem]. If she was flavor I won't savor. No taste buds, hoe later. Fuck you looking at, hater?. I saw them eyes like an ass raper. Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate. I'll be the last face you see before you pass. When you get your fucking ass graded like a math paper. So ahead of my time late means I'm early. my age is reversing. I'm basically 30, amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy. Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty. Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy. They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis. Said I put her face in the furnace. beat her with a space heater. A piece furniture, egg beater, thermos. It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringe worthy. But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81. Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap. State of emergency, the planets having panic attacks. Brady's returning, matter fact I may be deserving. Of a Pat on the back like a Patriots jersey. Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it. Like a fucking Terrier hittin' it. Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous. Tongue is foul shoot off at the fucking mouth. Like a missile, a thunder cloud. 100 pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound. And you'll get a round like Digital Underground. And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan Poster. With a lamp post, door handle shutter. A damn bolt cutter, a sandal. a can opener, a candle rubber. Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter. A banjo and manhole cover. Hand over the mouth and nose smother. Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover. The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner. Go ham donut or go Rambo. gotta make an example of her. That's for Sandra Bland ho and Philando. Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn. I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando. Your man don't want it, Trump's a bitch. I'll make his whole brand go under (yeah). And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L. A. White bronco like Elway. Speeding, I'm bout to run over a chick, Del Rey Cd in?. Females stay beatin 'em, bet you they'll lay bleeding. And yell, ""Wait! "", pleading-but screaming is pointless. Like feeding Michel'le helium. Leaving them pale faced medium sized welt. Straight treating 'em like a cell mate. See me I'm climbing hell's gate. Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made. Meaning someone else is self Made needed?. Cause I'ma. [Hook]. Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it. You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it. Everything lined up for the taking. And what I need from em; no favors. Clique too big, bread? gotta break it. 'Cause these others lowkey with the snaking faking. Everything lined up for the taking. And what I need from 'em? no favors. No favors. What I need? No favors. Everything lined up for the taking. And what I need from 'em? no favors. [Outro]. I know you feeling yourself right now. but I'm not sure she's the one. I would call them in. ""Hey, I'm outside"". What are you doing here?"

Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll. Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated, F.F. affiliated. Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated.

Stick to the, plan, to the plan. Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing. Stick to the, plan. [Verse 1]. Stay focused. Don't let these niggas see your emotions. Stick to the notion, stay in motion.

I, I, I, no you need to buckle down. Have people asking where you at. And wondering why you never wanna come around. You know that effort gon' come around. Big face like Zordon. You bought the watch but can't afford the time. Even if you running out of breath. Weight of the world doing lots of reps. Time to get this generation. Last one and then the next two outta debt. And they gon' pay you back with respect. Just stick to the plan, still we can chill. Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills. I realized there's no dream that I can't fill. I manifested all while I'm the man still. (Bitch I'm the man). [Verse 3]. Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking. Bullet to the head might be the way to free it. If I leave my body I can free the spirits. Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking. Wishing I could go back to the nineties. Back when I was dreaming. Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan. Early 2000s Detroit. might as well been the hell with demons. Wondering when I started it, the losing grip. Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean. You either drown or canoe through it. Voices in my head said I'm used to it. Some help me to lose. and some help me maneuv' through it. When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it. I know in life you either blow it or blew it. And at the end of life. it's gonna feel like you flew through it. I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head"

100 keys,"Ay, ay. [Chorus: Big Sean]. I'm from a big city. Tryna make a living. Come to my hood. Everybody get it. And for that paper all the wrong things sound right. Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like. Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like. Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money. Just a bittersweet symphony. [Rick Ross:]. I play these keys like a dope Barry Manilow. They get a bitch for that time, she speaks kinda low. Hit the roadkill coke and the manifo. Triple beam dreams with a trunk full of scattered clothes. Japanese denim, down south numbers. Hittin' once trusted partners, make a fat fiend stumble. Through the speed limit, on goes shoes. Call 'em penny loafers, they a pretty penny too. I'm tennis shrivels but I call it penny pinchin'. She told me shit but I could get her titties lifted. My new crib got it's own city limit. Motherfucker got his own city in it. Blue bottle on the floor. Plenty soft water. A hundred boss on the flow. Plenty hoes like a fourth quarter. (Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money). (Big Sean). Just a bittersweet symphony. [Chorus: Big Sean]. I'm from a big city. Tryna make a living. Come to my hood. Everybody get it. And for that paper all the wrong things sound right. Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like. Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like. Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money. Just a bittersweet symphony. [Pusha T:]. One hundred keys. One hundred please. My gazuntite could make a whole city sneeze. Walk the mud jungle where they grinded out the leaves. So they swarm to my honeycomb, I am for the bees. You know what this sounds like. When he countin' out the sound bytes. But she ain't gonna fire. Name ringin' through like the town like. Church bells ringin'. . Know where he was found like?. Colombian necktie in a hospital, damn right. She live on her knees. I live in a condo in the trees. The air's a little thinner than I breathe. Iron Man Audi, let the top strip tease. My life is slow motion but the watch hittin' freeze. Yeah, young nigga gettin' money. The feds dragged me, couldn't take nothin' from me. The decoy car is a crash test dummy. What follows is a hundred of 'em wrapped like a mummy. [Chorus: Big Sean]. I'm from a big city. Tryna make a living. Come to my hood. Everybody get it. And for that paper all the wrong things sound right. Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like. Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like. Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money. Just a bittersweet symphony. [Big Sean:]. Do it. And they gon' risk a hundred lives. So they could rock a hundred whites. The guests look like a hundred lights. Man when playin' dumb, my city cried a hundred nights. Yeah I got a main girl, but I done hit a hundred types. Every wrong I do, I'm stayin' tryna do a hundred rights. God of a G, a better price. My nigga keep that low key, Barry White. And don't worry 'bout the info. From where they ride Pintos, couldn't afford Benzos. 'Cause everybody know, keys open doors (keys-keys open doors). But bricks open windows. Countin' a hundred hundreds, more by more. Built this form the tile up, floor by floor. Talk shit, I send 'em door by door. Made for the Snow White life, four by four. [Chorus: Big Sean]. I'm from a big city. Tryna make a living. Come to my hood. Everybody get it. And for that paper all the wrong things sound right. Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like. Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like. Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money. Just a bittersweet symphony"
24k of gold (feat. j. cole),"[Hook]. Wishing I could rap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold. Lately I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls. Yup, diamonds and pearls, and enough money. I could rule the world. (If I ruled the world). [Verse 1: Big Sean]. If I ruled the world, I would buy it all. I'm addicted to champagne and buying the mall. I'm addicted to living life above the law. How much do it take to live above the law?. I call my homie Ralph up, cause his car stop. Told him bump a new car, come grab the car lot. That way you can have convertibles, and a hard top. Open up a few doors, since we had a hard knock, life. Like, open up, Where restaurants and legs stay opened up. Start a franchise. So my dog can quit wearing a. 44 up on his waist like it's his pants size. And to my OG locked up bumping Ready or Not. Who was just trying to do it big, but wasn't ready to die. Cop a first class whatever he like, with hoes already inside. Now he can rest in piece while he alive. [Hook]. Wishing I could rap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold. Lately I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls. Yup, diamonds and pearls, and enough money. I could rule the world. (If I ruled the world). [Verse 2]. Seems life's never at a stand still, even in a photo. Thinking about an the ex girl, I hold though. Like would we have won it all, or would I have lost it all like Ocho. The things I think about the most are things I never know though. Like, why don't school teach more mathematics. Less trigonometry and more about taxes. They at the chalkboard, teaching us ass backwards. How about preparing us for life, instead of lab rat us. With a mansion that's about 5 floors. No more sleeping on the couches, cause we got 5 more. With the fam that reminded me what I'm alive for. And at the same time remind me what I'd die for. A world where you wouldn't need sleep. That way we'd catch up instead of chase dreams. And finally get the speed boat my dad always wanted. I swear I feel it coming. [Hook]. Wishing I could rap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold. Lately I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls. Yup, diamonds and pearls, and enough money. I could rule the world. (If I ruled the world). [Verse 3: J. Cole]. Is this a dream, well that's how it feels. Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it's real. I specifically remember, no heat in the winter. Now I supply heat for the winter. Then I skate to the beach for the winter. When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip. No cleats I'm a winner. Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember. Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners. Meet the young Dennis, the menace of society. Check my sobriety fuck hoes in varities. Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me. But, I'm getting doe man these flows ?gon retire me. Splurging all crazy, switching lanes in the. Range swerving all crazy. Style on the dial, I've been serving ya'll lately. Cheddar on Federer. Ball 'till I fall, et cetera, et cetera. [Hook]. Wishing I could rap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold. Lately I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls. Yup, diamonds and pearls, and enough money. I could rule the world. (If I ruled the world)"
a million dollars,"[Hook]. I'm gone make a million and one dollars,. And do it again.. Just wait 'till tomorrow, we gone borrow, and record again.. Cant wait till the day we wake up, wake up, wake up.. And we all gone be paid up, paid up, paid up.. Just wait, wait.. [Verse 1]. Man, I'm so tired for praying for this free shit,. And being broke as some weak shit.. But thank god for that Micky D's,. One dollar double cheese,. Or something nice I don't wanna eat shit.. But there always was girls on my penor,. And I fell victim to the vagina.. But when it comes to the ass chase,. No thank you rather run in the cash race.. To the world knows Sean,. The only thing getter better in time besides wine.. Honestly better than all these asses,. With no practice,. Forreal just as is.. I didn't have to go to school,. I was better at this,. Watch a nigga pull more strings than Lenny Kravitz.. So I can say I have it,. If not I wish I had it,. I do it with a passion.. [Hook]. [Verse 2]. And we just started we nowhere near the outro,. I'll tell y'all what I'm about though.. High ends, high spending,. We just trying to end life on a high note, soprano.. And I was supposed to be on for a minute,. Man I've been writing songs for a many.. And you can ask Kanye, you can ask G-Ro, you can ask Don C.. Hip hop why the hell you find a nigga like me?. Snotty nose lil' nigga,. Yous to tell by his cream.. Now I'm wearing ice cream with a chain on my shirt,. Call that bitch a ice t.. So tell me what it takes to go from sitting on porches,. To sitting in porsches.. Take in less fortunate,. And turn it into a fortune,. And make my mama proud that she didn't get that abortion.. [Hook]. [Outro]. I'm gone make a million, just wait 'till tomorrow [x5]. Do it again, we gone do it again, do it again..."
all figured out,"[Intro:]. Finally Famous in this. [Verse 1:]. It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out. Just because your bank account gets all figured out. Next time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit. And they ain't major shit. Do yourself a favor: kick 'em out. Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life. I always say long days is better than long nights. At least in the day you've got shade. In the night it's all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights. I wish somebody would have told B. I. G. that before March ninth. I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights. 'Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries. Extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe. But I didn't know it was off of infested streets. Now he the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat. I guess that's the hunger that got me out. At the top of hotel suites renting the lobbys out, you know?. Stuntin' like a bitch, prime night me out. And the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route. That was back when I was seventeen. It's crazy though, cause even then I thought I had it all figured out. [Hook]. [?]. [Verse 2:]. It's crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed. 'Specially if you've got a vision. Or how you could have everything. And still think about everything missing. Like I probably remember the times I missed out on. More than the ones I lived. I probably remember the girls that I ain't have. More than the ones I did. But I remain a two timing, one girl on the way. Two lyin and one bed-never too tired. Smoke so much I need two lighters. Shoppin overseas I do buy it, who higher?. They taught me that I had to dream, black history month. I wake up and treat the day like stack history month. I'm talkin' Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson. Front of the plane: I'm Rozay Parks. SUV swervin like it's O. J. 's car, oh. To me and my dogs is all gettin out. Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out. Finna take extra shots for my dogs missin' out. That keep remindin' me at the same time. That I still ain't got it all figured out. Fact, the only thing I really figured out. Is that I'll never have it all figured out, fuck. Even when your bank account is all figured out. Even when your bank account gets all figured out. Even when your best friend gets all trickered out. Even when it... all of it... when you still ain't got. [Outro:]. Today I woke up and realized every day gets shorter. Every minute turns into the longest second, yet never ending. Age is nothing but a reminder and it doesn't tell you. How old or young minded someone is. Cause we all started at the same starting point of a woman's legs. But each have our own finish line. Understand it never ends, and the only way to be immortalized. Is to be remembered, hopefully from right than wrong. Better to be in the hall of fame than shame. Whether it exists for what you do or not. We create this world so we make what exists. It isn't about the award, it's about the award of being immortalized. And remembered for all the right reasons. Mistakes are forgotten, no footprints of any missteps. So when it's so late that it's early. And you need a drink even though the bar's closed. Remember why you do what you do. For the coldest drinks, the fastest cars, luxury. The adrenaline rush of creating what you think about. With who thinks about you. Your family, your team. The joy of looking back and saying that you did it. Winning the game: hall of fame"

This is that late night workin' after three. Man this why my old girl was mad at me. This why I'm your majesty. Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy's the tightest. The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest. The feat not divided, the love is divided. And I just got it, thank God that we got it, blessed. I don't know what I would do without it. Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits. Your prophet will profit, oh God. [Hook: Drake]. I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I. I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I. I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed. I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed. [Verse 2: Drake]. Look, I ain't gonna say that we back or nothin'. Cuz that implies that we're back from somethin'. If we're back from somethin' its some checks you owe us. I expect that payment, nothin' less or over.

Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the Six. Look at what we did. Be quiet I'm doin' a toast. For niggas that don't really do shit I swear y'all be doin' the most. Stop worryin' about whoever's next. I am just worried about my mama worryin' less. I think I'm famous enough, I don't need anymore press. I am convinced I'm the only one left thats still doin' this shit man. [Hook: Drake]. [Verse 3: Big Sean]. My grandma just died I'm the man of the house. So every mornin' I'm up cause I can't let them down. Always down for the cause, never down for the count. I guess when your stars align you do like the solar system. and plan it out. So I'm goin' overtime on the overtime. Yeah I'm not invested but you can't attest it. Million dollar goals, man its to manifest it. The family never goin' anorexic. I pay my mortgage and electric. Never goin' under even with anesthetics. At the top of the rap game and progressin'. Check after check, checkin' off my check list. Try and blow my cake just know thats a death wish. No mistakes in life ever, it? s only lessons. Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together. You tore the game apart who put it back together. [Hook: Drake]. [Verse 4: Kanye West]. Since the truth keep niggas traumatized. They tryna compromise my condom size. So I snapchat that whole shit. Tryin' see titties, tryna show dick. And I swear to God I hope they post it, I'm blessed. Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors. C3po's like Star Wars. They want me by the road holdin' up cardboard. So I go extra hard on the hard floor. Right now callin' you from my home gym. Right after that, nigga I'm gon' swim. Just did a couple laps in my home pool. And my daughter right there gettin' homeschooled. I'm blessed, and I was thinkin' 'bout startin' up my own school. A montessori, and the hallway lookin' like a monastery. Oh yes I'm way up, I feel blessed"

Boy I'm 'bout my business on business. I drink liquor on liquor. I had women on women. Yeah that's bunk bed bitches. I've done lived more than an eighty year old man still kickin'. Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'. But this for the girls that barely let me get to first base. On some ground ball shit. Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit. They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall bitch like a drought but. You gon' get this rain like it's May weather. G.O.O.D. Music, Ye weather. Champagne just tastes better. They told me I never boy, never say never. Swear my flow special like an infant's first steps. I got paid to reverse debts. Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress. So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death. So I can kick it with my grandad, take him for a ride. Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried. Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside. Don't matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind. In my mind, but fuck tryin' and not doin'. Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga's not doin'. I said fuck tryin' and not doin'. Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga's not doin'. I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac b*tch, and got ruined. So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that Juicy vid. I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'. Go against me, you won't stop losin'. From the city where every month is May-. Day at home, spray your dome. Niggas get sprayed up like cologne for a paycheck or loan. Yeah I know that shit ain't fair. They say that Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor. You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone. I knew that the world was for the taking and it wouldn't take long. We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody. Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit wrecks everybody. I'm so first class I could spit up on every pilot. The city's my Metropolis, feel it It's metabolic. And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest shit. Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot. I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop. Drop fire, and not because I'm name droppin'. Hall of Fame droppin'. And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OG's. Cause that ain't the way of an OG. So my GO collect more G's, every dollar.

Cardio bracelets for my women free as I'm in Vegas. Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?. If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me. I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable.

And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way. And if you're in it, better run for pete's sake. I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time. Who's the best MC? Kendrick, Jigga and Nas. Eminem, Andre 3000, the rest of yall. New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved. And I ain't rockin no more designer shit. White T's and Nike Cortez, this is red corvettes annonymous. Im usually homeboys with the same niggas im rhymin wit. But this is hip hop and them niggas should know what time it is. And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big KRIT, Wale. Pusha T, Meek Mill, A$AP Rocky, Drake. Big Sean, Jay electron', Tyler, Mac Miller. I got love for you all but I'm tryna murder you niggas. Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas.

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]. You could check my name on the books. I Earth, Wind, and Fire'd the verse, then rained the hook. The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof.

And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turns the coldest. The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over. Put your trust in the Lord, pretend that your Chevy Nova.

That's why I came with a rock, then signed my name on the Roc. Draw a line around some earth, then put my name on the plot. Cause I endured a lot of pain for everything that I got. The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rains from the heart. And the tissue is like an angel kissin you in the dark. You go from blind sight to hindsight,. Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin in the limelight. It takes time to get your mind right. Jay Electricity, PBS mysteries. In a lofty place, tangling with Satan over history. You can't say shit to me,. Alhamdulillah. It's strictly by faith that we made it this far"

dark sky (skyscrapers),"[Intro]. Sean, it's good to be home, isn't it?. I see the skyscrapers in the back, this shit is official. [Verse 1]. I got a lot on my mind, I got more in my face. If I ain't going to get it, that day is going to waste. I'm tryna move in my safe, like the safe was a safehouse. I ain't going out to eat, but these hoes stay on the stakeout. And you know it's official when I go bringing that Bape out. I'm thumbing through the magazines like. ""this the girl I'mma take out"". Imagine stuck in the D and you tryna find a way way out. And yeah, your music been bumping. and you just waiting to break out. And I've been waiting all god damn year, all year. I can tell that it's near, but near ain't here. Man, them bills is here right now. I guess you shine brightest when the lights down, like now. And then they say it happened for me overnight. shit, yeah I guess. I guess it took ten years for me to be an overnight success. What you know about living check to check to living check. to check to check to check? First place, no neck and neck. Two girls is breast to breast to breast to breast. Blowing smoke but I'm a breath of fresh air. Yeah, saying I'm doing extra numbers like I'm Chinese. Taking double shots like Siamese. I'm from where crime breeds, her titties out like sign these. I knew I lived this life back. when I was young and used to climb trees. I should've known back then I wasn't gonna stop. Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top. I said I should've known back then, man. that I wasn't gonna stop. Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top. [Hook] (x2). And I don't owe nobody in the world no favors. I started from the basement, made it to the skyscrapers. I'm a successful nigga, I got shit going on. I'm a successful Don, I got shit going on. [Verse 2]. Bitch, watch how you speak to me. I've been working all week and I know I need ZZs. Tryna get paid repeatedly. Jamaica or Cancun, now that's where I need to be. Credit card used to be Ebt, in the D though that's D-Ebt. I've been thinking about becoming a cop. So I can murk some niggas one by one off legally. I talk that real shit, but that's why they loving it. One time for the city, treating it like it's the mothership. Was talking to my dad though on some other shit. He like ""man, slow down with the girls you're fucking with. If they ain't a quarter back, there's no point of rushing it. Don't make the same mistakes I made with your mother"". But that's on some other shit, look. I'm into risk and taking it. I'm into making it then get back to making. like I ain't made it yet. This the rehab for a workaholic. I been thinking bout shaking it. I done had a Rolex longer than I had relationships. I'm embarrassed to say that shit. But I've been working on myself. and that's the most important work. Even if you don't get paid for it. Shit, call me the greatest. Don't call up no favours, I call up my saviour. Like thank you God, look at all we created. I started rapping Biggie Smalls in the basement. And now we headed to the tallest skyscrapers"
deep (feat. lil wayne),"[Intro]. Do or die, nigga. I'mma keep poppin' this Champagne. Don't worry about shit. Finally famous, nigga. [Hook: Big Sean]. Man, I look up to God, I wonder if I fell from the sky. Would I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly?. I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes. Sometimes I wonder if I already died. That shit get deep, deep, deep. Man, I swear to God that shit just get so. deep, deep, deep, deep. [Verse 1: Big Sean]. Man, I swear to God it get so deep though. That sometimes I just gotta wake my ass up. out my sleep though. And wonder what if all the shit I reaped then got repoed. And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though. See, I got a stack of problems. that could use a fucking steamroll. Got off in the game, don't need no cheat code. As long as I know the G code. Being paranoid done turned me to a creep. You ain't got that metal on your side. Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to. it get deep. Deep, deeper than telekinesis. Deeper than your sister dying. and you're telling your nieces. The deeper it gets, boy, the pressure increases. But pressure make diamonds. And my name is Sean cause I shine, it's self explanatory. I architect the flow, rapping all of these stories on stories. You know the story. If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish Stone Cold it. My opponent probably praying for postponement. You fuck with the best rapper, don't even know it. It's written in the stars, man, the sky is the author. I pulled the sword out of the stone, I'm King Arthur. Motherfuck your armor, nigga. only weapon I'm scared of is Karma. You watching the son turn to father. fucking life and her daughter. Nigga, that shit just get deep. [Hook: Big Sean & Lil Wayne]. Man, I look up to God, I wonder if I fell from the sky. Would I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly?. I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes. Sometimes I wonder if I already died. That shit get deep, deep, deep. Man, I swear to God that shit just get so. deep, deep, deep, deep. [Verse 2: Lil Wayne]. Been going hard all day. Wish a nigga would fuck with me. Then I blow the candles out on my cake. And niggas always thinking it's a game. Til we ran them out the arcade. Stunting in my southernplayerlistic Cadillac, Andre. I talk that cash money shit. Ym plus Cmb, you can do the math for me, bitch. Jail time, a slap on the wrist. Cut your head off, get it mailed out, stamp on your lips. You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist. Anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist. Well, tell them I'll be waiting in suspense. I got some miles on me. but it's cool cause I never give an inch. And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say. Cause this shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say. That shit enough times like somebody rewind me. Like shit is deeper than rap. I cannot say that shit enough times. I feel like Sean, don't get enough shine. Is it because he ain't got the tattoos?. He ain't throwing up signs. Well, let me throw up mine. And also let me show this vision of mine. Fuck the finish line, just finish your lines. And if getting your point across crosses the line. Some of the time then cross it with pride. That's real, my nigga, remember that. And it ain't about if they remember you. they remember rap. So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that. Cause this shit is deep, deep. Deep as empty pockets, nigga. We come empty pockets before. we have empty pockets, slime. That shit get deep. [Hook: Big Sean & Lil Wayne]. Man, I look up to God, I wonder if I fell from the sky. Would I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly?. I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes. Sometimes I wonder if I already died. That shit get deep, deep, deep. Man, I swear to God that shit just get so. deep, deep, deep, deep"
don't tell me you love me,"(Verse 1). I know your tears more than you cause I see 'em so much. That's what happens when you're here with no trust, okay. I lied, cheated, you cried. You done worse shit, and I'm still here, right?. And motherfuck your friends. All them hoes hatin'. If you're not down, then what's your location?. I called and checked in every night and that was not probation. They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation. Man, you on some other other shit. Just found out about my other other bitch. Went from ""I love ya"" to ""Ya don't know who ya fuckin' with"". Fresh off of vacay and already need another trip. She said I had enough tries. Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys. What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time?. If you wanna leave fine. (Chorus). Just don't tell me you love me. You're gonna make it too hard for me. I wish you were ugly. It'd wouldn't be so hard to leave. 'Cause baby I hate to love you. I can't make up my mind. 'Cause right when I tell you it's over. By the end of the night, I be right back in bed witchu. I be right back in bed witchu. So don't tell me you love me. (Verse 2). Wishin' I would've tried more. She wanted the truth. Truthfully I wish I lied more. 'Cause when I was true, all I heard was buy more,. Fuck you, who is that? And I don't know why more. We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart. But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage. Feelin' like we ended too soon. Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms. Back shots, I know what you like. Had you hittin' high notes and you don't even need no autotune. Nights I was Patron'ed up. Girls dressed alike lookin' like they cloned up. Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up. And you was thinkin' ""Damn boy, grow up!"". And I could still hear her leavin'. Crazy, when a heart breaks it never breaks even. I even found another girl that's perfect. And I'm the only reason we're not workin'. 'Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time?. And if you wanna stay, fine. (Chorus). Just don't tell me you love me. You're gonna make it too hard for me. I wish you were ugly. It'd wouldn't be so hard to leave. 'Cause baby I hate to love you. I can't make up my mind. 'Cause right when I tell you it's over. By the end of the night, I be right back in bed witchu. I be right back in bed witchu. So don't tell me you love me. So don't tell me you love me, whatever you do, whatever you do. So don't tell me you love me. So don't tell me you love me, whatever you do, whatever you do. So don't tell me you love me"

first chain (feat. kid cudi & nas),"[Verse 1: Big Sean]. Coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls. Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose. Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hoes. Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals. BIG was the first one that had it. Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic. Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace. Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic. Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt. Used to pick me up from school right after work. Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church. She's ask why I rock all this gold, cause I'm coming in first. Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear-view. Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew. Now I'm in the penthouse, look what a mill do. Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you. [Hook]. Got my first chain. Feeling like I got my first chain. I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain. I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain. BIG was the first one that had it. Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits. I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain. I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain. [Verse 2: Nas]. What's the noise all about with this rap stuff. I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up. I can say I never been chased, jumped or backed up. I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas. who be acting up. Cause it's a mental game. I learned that when I got my first initial chain. I didn't fake it, it was gold plated, I was [?] relatin'. To those dealing with blow, had the [?] it was those gangsters. That bonus, that culture, those projects. Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint. They got in my bones, now I'm coppin' stones. Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs. 18 karat gold Cuban on, not too short, not too wide. not too long. [?] in the truest form. Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?. [Hook]. Got my first chain. Feeling like I got my first chain. I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain. I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain. BIG was the first one that had it. Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits. I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain. I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain. [Verse 3: Big Sean]. On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid. I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved. No matter what why I turn things go my way. I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave. Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga. To remind me of everything that we did, nigga. Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'. No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flying. I know the higher that I go, the harder to climb. But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind. Police only work 12-hour shifts. Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch. Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues. FF good, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews. Stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools. Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge. God damn, I think I'm gon' O. D. Off this asparagus and bread and pasta. Need a doctor, I've been dogding shady hoes and rainy days. It's like I got a built-in doppler. And it's a shame, a goddamn shame. I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'. But remember my first ass and the first time she came. It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain. [Hook]. Got my first chain. Feeling like I got my first chain. I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain. I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain. BIG was the first one that had it. Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits. I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain. I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain. [Verse 4: Kid Cudi]. It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things. Niggas and bitches, where you at?. I got my mind is on me. A couple others and dreams, would've seen me. Me and my niggas in this bitch. About two months in a week's time. Movin, feelin hellish [?] with lemon, lime shine. Now how the fuck can i chill now?. Kanye think I'm dope. See this piece that I own now. How sick is the rope?. Taking life for what it is. The troublesome chick, who throws fists. Sometime's it's the weather. Things switch up, people trip up. The money come down, then climb up. But when it come again. The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'. Saying that you love me [?] and if you don't. Motherfuck that sometimes. Get it, shred it. Young nigga lost to the night. I'm so ready to let it go. My life is fucking awesome [?] but I'm awesome. So fuck whoever has a bad thought. Don't know the god. Cause when I leave this bitch. you all gon' wish you knew the God. It might be too late, but the song [?]. Just know this fact, ou were all wrong. Now watch me do my silly dance. Not really a dance, more like a [?]. I'm signing off with a crotch grab.

I just bought a crib, three stories, that bitch a trilogy. And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone. I got a bitch that text me, she ain't got no clothes on. And then another one text, then your ass next. And I'm gonna text your ass back like. [Hook: Big Sean]. I don't fuck with you. You little stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you. You look, you look dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you. I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do. Than to be fuckin' with you. Little stupid ass, I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck, I don't I don't I don't give a fuck. Bitch I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do. Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do. [Verse 2: E-40]. Got a million things on my mind. Executive deals online, limited amount of time. Chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind. You liable to find me up in the Mgm casino in the D. Fuckin' off fetti I coulda put on property. From the Bay to the Murder Mitten. My niggas put murder missions. She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison. On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit. For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich. Got a blunt in my dental, goin' Ham in a rental. On my way, to Sacramento, late night, Arsenio. I'm never sentimental, go hard or go home, listen. Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless. I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me. I'll make a bitch stand outside forever. Like the Statue of Liberty. Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South. I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drank in my mouth. Why you always coming around with bad news?. Say you want me to win, but hope I lose. Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew. But them niggas cool, it's just that. [Hook: Big Sean]. I don't fuck with you. You little stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you. You little dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you. I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do. Than to be fuckin' with you. Little stupid ass, I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck, I don't I don't I don't give a fuck. Bitch I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do. Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do. [Verse 3: Big Sean]. I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for. I got a new whip that I gotta thank a lot for. Yeah I got a lot but want a lot more. Yeah we in the buildin' but I'm tryna take it to the top floor. I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up. It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up. That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl. I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up. I guess drama makes for the best content. Everything got a bad side, even a conscience. Now you're drinkin' 'til your unconscious. Feel me when you get a fine bitch. Just don't forget to read the fine print. Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas. Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator. Yeah I know that karma's too real so I hope you doin' cool. But still stupid ass bitch I ain't fuckin' with you. Little stupid ass I ain't fuckin with. I ain't fuckin', I ain't I ain't fuckin' with you. I ain't fuckin' with you"
i know (feat. jhen√© aiko),"[Pre-Hook: Big Sean]. I know you've been goin' through some things, uh huh. I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?. I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty. [Hook: Big Sean]. The way you move it's like you could use a vacation. Drink in your hand and the harder you dance. I swear right now it look like you on a vacation. Gotta get away, make it happen. Whatever happened just had to happen. On vacation, yeah. I know you've been, I know you've been. [Verse 1: Big Sean]. Dancin', dancin', dancin' like you fucking got a reason. Dancing like it's something to believe in. Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season. Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa. The harder your heart keep beating. Only feel bad while you're thinkin'. Pop, pop, pop like Pepsi Co. the best we smoke. Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico. Go go, let me see how wild it get. Bust it wide as it get. You need to be taken care of and pampered. But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit. I know you've been silencing your phone. (Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home). I know you've been tryna get along. What's up, it's on, no games, we grown. I know you feel like sometimes that y'all. don't speak the same language. I know that you just wanna let it go with. all the bitches that you came with. [Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]. . I know you've been going through some thangs. wanna get away. Baby, let me be your vacation. That other trick you've been fuckin' with, is a trip. You know she be playin',. baby I am just saying. I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah. You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah. Take a load off on my private island. Come inside and go into hiding. I know that you've been sacrificing your time. And need time to unwind and let go. So let go, and let's go, and let's roll and we roll. [ Big Sean]. Excited, activated get ignited. So many charges on my card oh God I think it got indicted. Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place. Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away. You a star, you need space, we can shoot up by the town. Have you ever been to Texas? South By Southwest. Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested. Where they might know us off any intersection. I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest. Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it. No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted. [Verse 4: Big Sean & (Jhene Aiko) ]. I know you've been crying and poutin'. Know you're tired of arguing. But no screaming and shouting. And you know we on a roll like we did good in college. Throwin' hundreds and thousands. Like they not hundreds and thousands. Why? Cause I know you've been going. through some things. (I know you've been going through. some things you can't explain. With your main thing that shit insane. I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame. you can't complain). I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?. (Don't love the same, I know you've been. diving through pain. I know goin' runnin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty. That shit can fuck with your mente. I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you...). [Hook]. The way you move it's like you could use a vacation. Drink in your hand and the harder you dance. I swear right now it look like you on a vacation. Gotta get away, make it happen. Whatever happened just had to happen. On vacation, yeah. I know you've been, I know you've been. [Outro]. I know it look like like you need a vacation. How 'bout Hawaii, maybe Jamaica, maybe Asia. Take you places 'lotta niggas can't take ya. Don't forget the make up. Yeah"

And if I put my mind to it then that's what it has to be. Yeah you're fucking right damn, sure bitch that's for certain (fucking right). Never cut the family ties, I only cut the burdens (whoa). Got so many cuts and scars it look like I left the surgeon. Done been through so much shit, I'm like a whole 'nother person (thank God). Don't get it confused, don't get it confused, yeah (no, no).

We be here, that I knew, since Timbaland and Magoo. And I proved and I bloom. I'm gon' win more than my room. Hand straight up like it's noon. If I can't live a hundred years, I'm gone way too soon. I'm in tune. If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you"
intro,I say I'm still dreaming bigger than I'm living. And just sleeping long enough to dream. Spent long enough in the sheets. It's time to turn it to the real thing. And turn these ideas to milli's. Business in the buildings. No girlfriend you're looking for some feelings find a dentist. Me and my crew toured around the world shook a million hands. I never made the crowd fans I made them all fam. And came back to the city that made us all men. Except we kings now reflecting trying to take it all in. I put the city on my back. So that way if I fall I'm crowd surfing the map. I turn mistakes into lessons dead ends to exits. On the journey of my life so I'm inviting y'all to get in. Let's go. Go go go go go go
it's time (feat. young jeezy & payroll),"[Intro: Big Sean]. I done fell asleep fucking last night. That? s how much I don? t sleep nigga. Finally famous nigga. [Hook: Big Sean x2]. And I? ll be goddamned if I didn? t. Put the city on let? s get it. (alright alright alright, alright alright alright). Let? s get it. [Verse 1: Big Sean]. Today is a good day. I wish a nigga would day. Ride through the hood day. Ride through the hood where I would stay. If I wasn? t me, wasn? t committed. I told my mom and my dad it? ll be the last Christmas. In the hood that you can visit. Oh boy I got it, no chasers. Cause the best mixed with Hennessey is problems. I took that advice young when I was headed up to college. Momma swimming in that debt. Rather swim with the piranhas or the shark. Ready set go, on your mark to the top. Getting rich ain? t a blessing it? s a choice. Drunk and still drinking out the bottle. I want a hood rat bitch motherfuck a model. You ain't alive if you ain't living that? s the motto. And imma? probably wake up tomorrow sayin, sayin. [Hook: Big Sean]. [Verse 2: Young Jeezy]. Lets get it, yeah be alright nigga. It? s the motherfucking world nigga. Getcha some time to just do it how I done it. First up on the first cause? first of all you gotta want it. Re-up time for every penny, never fronted. So room for, paid every penny then I stunted. Stunted so hard you woulda thought I was a stuntman. TS4 with 23? s I? m talking jumpmans. Twos and thirds watch for the blitz, you know they rush. Just don? t get caught in the coupe with them birds, end of discussion. Them boys round the corner wanna sell in that Cal Ripken. If them niggas think I? m riding with that, them niggas tripping. Yeah I got a magnificent hustle, cause? imma? grinder. Told my olds im hiding you here, so they won? t find you. What you know about a bag that? s heavy as anacondas?. Bet you one thing, I ain? t talking no marijuana. That? s whats wrong with these niggas they think it? s about shine. You niggas get back to your grind, I think it? s about time. [Hook: Big Sean]. [Verse 3: Payroll]. They say it? s my time according to my Rolex. I? m bout to fuck the game, then your ho next. I used to talk dirty on my cell, no phone sex. No yoga boy I was making blow stretch. Press the fast forward button, I? m pushing a foreign something. All through my neighborhood, next stop is the haters hood. My bitch so bad, but you can bet that my paper good. I do this for real, you lil niggas just fake it good. It? s time for a new crib, it? s time for a new chain. 20 thousand on me homie that? s just loose change. Too many diamond chains that nigga a mess. But if you knew bout my hood you? d say that nigga is blessed. Detroit in this bitch, Big Sean what it do bro?. Getting money four ways so I can buy a two-door. Stash looking healthy but my jewelry got the flu though. The hustle? s who I represent, dope boys we in this bitch. [Hook: Big Sean]. [Outro]. Detroit, once the backbone of this country. Now it? s the largest U. S. city to file for bankruptcy. Thriving neighborhoods are now vacant. Going from a population of nearly 2 million. To under 700, 000 in a matter of years. The people of Detroit really going to have to stick together. To make it through these tough times"
jump out the window,"I think I'm ready to jump out the window. And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though. We already wasted too much time. And your time is the only thing I wish was mine. I think I'm ready to jump out the window. Know yo mama didn't raise you to take no disrespect. I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check. You cried on my phone the whole night. That time you crossed the line yeah, yeah, yeah. I went to straighten his ass out. And you told me never mind, yeah. The question isn't do he love ya. The queestion is do ya love yourself?. You give te best advice to your friends. And not take it for yourself. Remember when you used to though and hit Mario Kart. And you always picked the princess. I realized you was princess. Way back then we the best thing that never happened but. I think I'm ready to jump out the window. And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though. We already wasted too much time. And your time is the only thing I wish was mine. I think I'm ready to jump out the window. I don't know if I'm ready for this mentally. But look, you the best thing that happened. You been up at night sleep deprivation. What's the hesitation?. What's yo reservation?. You been tripping tripping with no destination. You need separation. You need recreation. Y'all been arguing every other day. Ya friends gotta step in. And break it up like chill chill chill. It's no need to turn this into kill bill. Funny we ran into each other while we leaving. You walked in with a perm. And now yo hair look like The Weeknd's. I know that you been needing clarity. Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy. But you gave too much time to that boy charity hear me. I think I'm ready to jump out the window. And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though. We already wasted too much time. And your time is the only thing I wish was mine. I think I'm ready to jump out the window. I don't mean to sound like the jealous type. But you oughta know. I think me and you should get together sometime on the low low low. Sometimes I wonder if you even know. How much you worth, I gotta know. Sometimes I wonder if you even know. How much you worth, I gotta know. This one's for you"
life should go on (feat. wale),"From the west but I'm heading to the northside. That's the top, I need a crib on the shortside. I need a backyard full court size. From where the jury is the only thing that's courtside. Chasing money in the city of crime. Cash back so then it's black bags under my eyes. Man fuck it I got a dream worth more than my sleep. To me playing in the game is worth more than the seats. Man fuck these hating ass bitches I'm gone. They told me no then I reverse it I'm on, I'm on!. I'm on, I'm on, they told me no then I reverse it I'm on. Mama had 2 jobs I know that she was working for me. Ten years later, I got her working for me. Hired the whole family like mobsters. Getting paid off our operation we ain't even doctors. Grandma called, see me on the billboards around the city. Man going around around the world so many times I'm dizzy. London or japan, orlando, walt disney. Paris, abu-dhabi, california weed twistin' yup!. Texas to toronto where they love that nigga drizzy. All the way to detroit, the whole city fucking with me. Heading to the money, whole city coming with me. And I'mma rep the city 'til the reaper come and get me yup!. [Hook]. And this is how life should go. Everything I wanted never seem so close. Good people, good drinks, good smoke. Got me thinking this is how life should go. This is how life should go. Everything I wanted never seem so close. Family all around, all highs no lows. Got me thinking this is how life should go. [Verse 2: wale]. Sitting back, putting all my issues in a swisher. I keep a fuck you with my misses, fuck these other bitches. And this ain't biblical but this sermon is spiritual. 'Cause when it come to winning, convincing is only been a few. The upper percentile. Whipping whatever I, 460ls you. I probably go less miles, stay in a small circle. Know that it's god working. Police got the swine flu and these niggas is raptized. Yeah, maybach poetic genius. You buying a seven jeans, keep mine in a seven beemer. I'm trampolining on niggas and I actually mean it. A fly nigga, I keep having the gravity grievous. And while these niggas keep hating, they be asking for features. That's like a complacent atheist is asking for jesus. Riding around without a fuck given. Behind them dirty plates like a catcher with a mitten. The best in my position, I'm passionate with lyrics. And they ain't fucking with the kid like chris hansen in the kitchen. I'm handsome to these women, I'm envied by these no ones. That's no joakim noah, nigga everybody know us. And even if you don't drink everybody po' up. 'Cause all these hating niggas probably never gon' show up. Never hate on no one, your blessing's getting closer. Even when I'm open, there's nothing the air colder wassup"
light,"Is it time?. I spent my whole life trying to improvise. I'm not saying that shit for you to sympathize. Spent my whole life tryna find the light that's at the end of the tunnel. I should have realized it was inside. So lately I been trying to get what's inside outside. So many people wanna see my insides outsides. I'm from that city four hours east of Southside. Where everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders. Growing up, with the ones I hold it down with. Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit. Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit. Before this I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with. You know, take the fame, take the crib. Take our cars, now we gotta take the train. Hood niggas takin' chains, slave master take our names. 5-0 take the shot, young souls take the blame. Man but they can't take away the light. No matter how much they gon' shade you (no). Man they can't fuck with the light. They can't stop the shine. They can't fuck with the light, hell nah the boy's that bright. Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light. No matter how much they gon' shade you. Got the whole city on fire. Boy this the flow that got Steph Curry inspired. This the flow that got Lebron James finna rewire. This the flow that got my whole family finna retire. Flows on flows, I might drown in this bitch. Ye found a pro, I guess I'm profound in this bitch. My dad from Louisiana, man the smallest town. Where if they know you brown, they might hold you down. And even hose you down, man. Since I'm a son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard. I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Drumpf card. And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings. And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon. So when they take the fame, take the crib. Take our cars, now we gotta take the train. Hood niggas takin' chains, slave master take our names. 5-0 take the shot and young souls take the blame. Man, but they can't take away the light. No matter how much they gon' shade you (nah). Man they can't fuck with the light. They can't stop the shine. They can't fuck with the light, hell nah the boy's that bright. Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light. No matter how much they gon' shade you. Don't let them take away your soul (no, no). Don't let them take away what makes you whole"
live this life,"Oh shit I'm finally famous. And I'm rolling with the mother fucking top down. How can you blame us?. I wanna break you off like right now. Old time millionaire. I wanna break you off like right now. I wanna break you off like right now. Hell yeah nigga high right now. That's the reason I said hi right now. Had the time of your life right now.

memories,"[Big Sean - Verse 1]. Sometimes I dream bigger than I live. Sometimes I think better when I'm lit. So go head and light it. Roll it up, ignite it. One time for all my n-ggas that dreamed it than real life'd it!. I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin. They say sky's the limit, how b-tch? I'm moonwalking!. And my middle name Michael hoe. Success is my idol and being broke is my rival. But it's because I got the title hoe. See I just want my fantasies and real life. You got everything to me what it feel like. Muthaf-ck the radio if I can't hear mine. They give the wrong n-ggas more airtime than airlines. Is you feeling me?. If not you feel my energy. See I know I'mma make it, but even if I don't. Don't feel bad cuz honestly all these times that I had. Those will be the best memories. [Chorus]. Be the best memories. I hope that you remember me. These will be the best memories. Ooooh ohho ooooooooo. Cuz in the end all you really have is memories. Ooooh ohho ooooooooo. [Big Sean - Verse 2]. Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love. Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love. Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs. that's what happens when they need connections and you the plug. How many trends you gotta set before you considered great. How many missed calls before you considered fake. How many dreams before it's considered fate. I'm eating in a World where I'm considered bait. A workaholic addicted to bills. People addicted to me cuz they addicted to real. My best friend got addicted to pills. I can't look at him in his eyes, you don't know how that sh-t feels mentally!. I aint trying to rock no shirts that say ""in memory"". I'm praying that he make, wished we could go back. Cuz honestly all the times that we had. Those be the best memories.... [Chorus]. [End]"
memories part 2,"[Verse 1 - Big Sean]. Sometimes I dream bigger than I live. Sometimes I think better when I'm lit. So goin and light it. Roll it up, ignite it. One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life'd it!. I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin. They say thr sky's the limit, how bitch? I'm moonwalking!. And my middle name Michael ho. Success is my idol and being broke is my rival. But it's cool because I got the title ho. See I just want my fantasies in real life. You got everything tell me what it feel like. Muthafuck the radio if I can't hear mine. They give the wrong niggas more airtime than airlines. Is you feeling me?. If not you feel my energy. See I know I'mma make it, but even if I don't. Don't feel bad cuz honestly all the times that I had. Those will be the best memories. [Hook]. Be the best memories. I hope that you remember me. These will be the best memories. Cause in the end all you really have is memories. [John Legend]. Let's reminisce over the good times and the bad. Reflect on everything we missed. Cause you know we'll never get it back. [Big Sean - Verse 2]. Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love. Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love.

Let's reminisce over the good times and the bad. Reflect on everything we missed. Cause you know we'll never get it back. [Verse 3 - Big Sean]. Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed. Was mailed one when I heard Nique had died in that crash. Seemed like yesterday I just seen him smile and laugh. I'm stressing over little shit. When I should be happy I can. They say my music beating, cause I follow my heart. I always have faith, like who swallows the darts. And with my Mama looking at cribs that we can't purchase. Houses bigger than a palace. But she a queen, so she deserve it. So I'm focused, they try to throw me off track. But they just hurdles. I'm marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle. Man, I'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle. Fast forward a few years later. Now we the fucking winner's circle. Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan'. Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom. Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect. But I already dreamed it. So it felt like I rehearsed it. Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed. Sad I used to steal $20 bill right out her purses. No I ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse. Life out of a hearse. And if I die, of course I have the memories.... [John Legend]. Let's reminisce over the good times and the bad. Reflect on everything we missed. Cause you know we'll never get it back"

Everything lined up for the taking. And what I need from 'em? no favors. [Verse 1: Big Sean]. I'm about getting the job done, boy up every night. I'm about rolling a seven, when I toss up the dice. I'm about getting my logo off, flooded with ice. I'm about taking a risk, that might fuck up your life. Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews. In front of cameras too (brr). Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?. I'm like ""niggas took the flow but I'm still standing too"". Thought I had the Midas touch. and then I went platinum too. Mother fuck all your comparisons. Ive been talking to God like that's my therapist. I'm African-American in America. I ain't inherit shit but a millionaire under 30. So he must be hearing shit. Don, don, don, life, I do this for the crib. The D to Flint who kids sick from led. Others get the hit with the laugh. From where they need a handout. But they tell you put hands up. Only deals I have is from the Sam's Club, now it's. Blue blood in my veins, so you know where I came from. Born in a world going where they told me I can't go. In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt. Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for. When my grandma died, I realized I got an angel. Show me everything's a blessing. depending on the angles. Look, I am the anomaly. never needed favors or apologies. That's my new lifetime policy. Wood grain steering wheel this bitch. feel like a pirate ship. How many hot verses till you bitches start acknowledging. The pictures we been painting, my nigga. Connected to a higher power. How I know? 'Cause I don't write my shit. I think it, my nigga. Look, all I ever did was beat the odds. Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out. Never stopping like we hypnotized.

So ahead of my time late means I'm early. my age is reversing. I'm basically 30, amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy. Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty. Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy. They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis. Said I put her face in the furnace. beat her with a space heater. A piece furniture, egg beater, thermos. It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringe worthy. But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81. Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap. State of emergency, the planets having panic attacks. Brady's returning, matter fact I may be deserving. Of a Pat on the back like a Patriots jersey. Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it. Like a fucking Terrier hittin' it. Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous. Tongue is foul shoot off at the fucking mouth. Like a missile, a thunder cloud. 100 pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound. And you'll get a round like Digital Underground. And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan Poster. With a lamp post, door handle shutter. A damn bolt cutter, a sandal. a can opener, a candle rubber. Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter. A banjo and manhole cover. Hand over the mouth and nose smother. Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover. The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner. Go ham donut or go Rambo. gotta make an example of her. That's for Sandra Bland ho and Philando. Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn. I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando. Your man don't want it, Trump's a bitch. I'll make his whole brand go under (yeah). And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L. A. White bronco like Elway. Speeding, I'm bout to run over a chick, Del Rey Cd in?. Females stay beatin 'em, bet you they'll lay bleeding. And yell, ""Wait! "", pleading-but screaming is pointless. Like feeding Michel'le helium. Leaving them pale faced medium sized welt. Straight treating 'em like a cell mate. See me I'm climbing hell's gate. Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made. Meaning someone else is self Made needed?. Cause I'ma. [Hook]. Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it. You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it. Everything lined up for the taking. And what I need from em; no favors. Clique too big, bread? gotta break it. 'Cause these others lowkey with the snaking faking. Everything lined up for the taking. And what I need from 'em? no favors. No favors. What I need? No favors. Everything lined up for the taking. And what I need from 'em? no favors. [Outro]. I know you feeling yourself right now. but I'm not sure she's the one. I would call them in. ""Hey, I'm outside"". What are you doing here?"
"no heats, no love","Metro. We done came up dog and never look down. I might gotta throw my Jesus chain on for this. When you put the work in man it shows. Straight up out the ashes then I rose. I done hit a all time low. Been at a stand-still and had to go go go. Man they out here on a scheme like la-la-la. Breaking promises you need like na na na. No hearts, no love, no kumbaya. No hearts, no love, no kumbaya. Everything automatic so I can't waste time. And if we break up I only make up time. My team do this shit easier than lay-up lines. Never scared to cross that line or pay up fines. Look, Don Don Don, that's my top 3 in the order. Never took a shortcut. Meet a Crip off the late back. Y'all look like a short club. Shoutout to my loyal ones, I wish that it was more of us. Went from 30, 000 a year to 30, 000 feet as my floor plan. I got El Chapo with a choppa as my doorman. I'm on the other side taking care of what's important. If business not boomin' then it's time to change the format. Time to change the recipe, I'm special especially. Going for the record, no felony. And I'm dodging jail and jealousy. Day dreaming about a cruise with Penelope. Looking like success fell on me (damn). And get rid of all that jealousy. All that hate in your heart. I ain't got no enemies. I'm focused on what's meant for me. Putting my energy back into me, real shit. When you put the work in man it shows. Straight up out the ashes then I rose. I done hit a all time low. Been at a stand-still had to go go go. Man they out here on a scheme like la-la-la. Breaking promises you need like na na na. No hearts, no love, no kumbaya. No hearts, no love, no kumbaya. Boy this shit intricate. Working like a machine. they keep trying to throw a wrench in it. But I'm too intuitive and into it. No ghostwriting, no sixth sensing it. That's why all this shit sound so intimate. That's why I feel like you know me before we face to face. As for the latest, I'm the greatest Ali Bomaye. I put that work in overnight like that shit due today. I paint the pictures they can't trace, try and you get erased. I'm less focused on props and more on property. They put so much back on my hood. that I changed the economy. I'm 'bout to build a movie deal to downtown properly. And help revive the heart of the city. just keep on watching me. And if these bitch ass niggas got they wish and stopping me. Just know I done done so much good business in my life. That there's gon' always be a job for me, a op for me. I never burned bridges so there's a hundred ways. to get where I gotta be, Don. Same people, you see on the way up. Same ones you gonna see on the way down. You feel me?. You love me, I love you. You hate me, I love you, straight up. When you put the work in man it shows. Straight up out the ashes then I rose. I done hit a all time low. Been at a stand-still had to go go go. Man they out here on a scheme like la-la-la. Breaking promises you need like na na na. No hearts, no love, no kumbaya. No hearts, no love, no kumbaya"
no more interviews,"I guess I'm on my... on my Don shit. Somebody gotta do it. Look, no more interviews. I'm not talking about this on a song, feature or interlude. Reporting live from Hawaii with my girl. I brought sand to the beach. Working on vacay in the booth, sand on my feet. I'm from the ground up like a ground-ball play. I'm coming from the underground like it's Groundhog's Day. I'm talking so underground that when I talk about J, nigga. I might mean J Dilla, R. I. P. real niggas. Lately I only do the shit that inspire me. Lately niggas treat the Shade Room like a diary. Oh yeah, is that what you heard?. Believing everything that you hear without confirming it first. And you know the funny thing about it is my ex wanna write a tell all. Fucked up thing about it is she ain't even tell all. Like how I introduced her to meditation, positive thinking. And the books she probably read in daily rotation. I learned when people lie on you not to return the favor so. I won't get you embarrassed. I won't tell them all the other parts about you that's plastic. This my last time putting my ex in a song even though the last one went triple platinum. I'd rather put that energy into what's worth having. Like how I got a platinum album with no solo tour. Niggas say it's over for me I go overboard. Back against the wall like my poster but I'm the poster boy. Not from the city if you let THEY tell it. Greatest rapper of all time if you let YE tell it. You ask me, I don't got the resume. But, shit, I can go bar for bar for niggas who talking off. And getting egged on by A&Rs who, soon as your shit fallin' off, they walkin' off. And if you rappers diss us and ours just know that you dead and you know it. My career been moving perpetual motion. I'm not impressed with the whoopty woop, I don't know who is who. And can't pretend like I'm hip to it, no hula hoop. And I can't lie like I like this shit like I usually do. And I'm just not impressed by you niggas rapping fast. Who sound like one big asthma attack but trash when I'm rapping it back. Who you put in your top five and claim they the savior of rap. So many friends turn to enemies, they frenemies. I don't know why I act like I'm surprised or it's offending me. I'm saying, though, I should have learned from Hov and Dame. From Stunna and Wayne, Cudi and YE. What happened to our family ways, though?. When I put you on that song with Nas, you had told me that you was forever grateful. And that we brothers, so it hurt to hit the internet to find out that me and you don't fuck with each other. Over a miscommunication that probably could be fixed with a 5 minute conversation, I'm still praying. For ya, though, I guess I charged it to the game. How much it cost? Around twenty88. Going off like Kobe when he wore the crazy eights. All y'all niggas looking like my kiddos wearing Bape. Shot my first video in the Harajuku store. With Nigo in the background, that's a picture that you can't take. Yeah with Hype Williams directing each take. And GOD directing each step that we take. I'm a king, a legend, man, you niggas ain't worthy. 10 years in and a nigga still under 30. I'm feeling like an old man that failed at life. Got reincarnated to do it all again right (that's how I feel). So I'm treating every second like it's an investment. Time is money, every second I'm collecting. Don't ask me no stupid questions. ""Are you still signed to YE? "" questions, no Roc nation questions. Or who I'm dating questions, look, no more interviews. Unless you wanna talk about the music or something that has a different view. And not the shit that's getting the hits and views. Words misconstrued with no credit, but you niggas approved. My mistakes are my biggest professors and learning life lessons. I realize it ain't what you have, it's what you feel, that's what true success is. I am the one of one, after me there's no successor. DON"
nothing is stopping you,"[Verse 1: Big Sean]. I know I'mma get it, I just don't know how. Heart up on the stage, body in the crowd. Parents always tried keep me home. But I can't get paid from the crib, so I'll be gone till we on. Whats up, Finally Famous. I had it on my jacket way back in high school. Know I wanted to be in them night clubs. and not all off in that night school. So me and my niggas real life'd it. every week we did them cyphers. At the radio, had a crazy flow. man the city ain't heard shit like this. I woke up early on a saturday. Said I'mma cash my check and hit some ass today. Hit the bank, my nigga called me like: ""Go rap for Ye. He at the station, rap that shit that you rap everyday"". Man, that shit sounds stupid then I hang up on his ass. Then called him back like ""Fuck, let's do it"". I didn't even cash my check. man can't believe my ass pursuit it. I didn't even have no gas. but somehow God just lead me to it. Like, ""Let's do it"". [Interlude: Kanye West]. When I heard the songs he was doing. Man, I knew he had to be on G. O. O. D Music. (BIG! SEAN!) (x5). [Verse 2: Big Sean]. Just to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches. Thanking God Almighty, condoms were invented. Cause I had a yellow bone. that could've come from out the Simpsons, man. Who claim she never did it (Yeah right). But under these conditions she was with it. Then I hopped up on that red eye when I finished. I been gon for five hours, fuck, my head still spinning. Fucked the hotel up, shit she probably still in it. Getting rest that I be missing, but fuck it I'm on a mission. Flight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate. Now it's eight thirty, I'm officially late. for that eight o'clock spot. I know the Program Director hot. but I spit a freestyle up in there so cold. That everybody in that bitch forgot. Now I'm running late for sound check. And I heard the line's already to the lot. walking out the station. And that's around the time that I got stopped. by this shorty tryna rhyme. Manager said we ain't got time. But time to time you gotta make time. when it's time for karma to come back around. I say ""Aye dawg, What you got? "". ""Aw dawg, Big Sean, thanks a lot. Um alright, stay young ran the game. man they been afraid, tryna follow me get in a maze. Leave you minute maid. Um, I'm like a young black Eminem. it's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan. tryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them. And the bunch just synonyms about how he was living in. I ain't even let him finish shit. I mean I can't lie he was alright. but at his age, shit so was I. So give him my email on a fly, and if it sound good. then I reply, Uhh"
one man can change the world (feat. kanye west & john legend),"[hook: big sean]. They used to tell me. I hope you learn to make it on your own. And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone. I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose. I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know. Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything. Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams. And when you get it all just remember one thing. Remember one thing. That one man could change the world. That one man could change the world. [verse 1: big sean]. All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars. And a bad chick. Imagine this so much some nights it felt like that I had it. Back on the mattress. Starin' at the ceilin' tryna to connect the dots. But its hard makin' those attachments. I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day. You know?. My - my step brother used to flip them bags. Outside the crib like it was trash day. No kim k, but he bagged yay (ye). But when you're getting fast money, slow down, don't crash. With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas. Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it. Tell your team about it. Go make million dollar schemes about it. Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance. Used to look up at the stars. And be like ain't too much that's different. I be shinin', they be shinin'. Get your one shot don't you miss it. What you know bout' wakin' up everyday l. Ike you on a mission?. [hook: kanye west]. They used to tell me. I hope you learn to make it on your own.

That one man could change the world. That one man could change the world. [verse 2: big sean]. My grandma told me if you write your name in stone. You'll never get the white out. I grinded out that black hole. Then performed up at the white house. Standin' next to jim carrey, we traded stories then laughed. I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks. Where I'm from I swear they broke. They need way more than the cast. We need more than what you have. And then we need more than that. But how am I supposed to say I'm tired. If that girl from west virginia came up in conditions. That I couldn't survive. Went to war, came back alive. On top of that became a female black captain. When being black you had to extra extra try. Way before james brown made us proud. She bought a crib on the same street as marvin gaye. Right there on outer drive, and she taught me how to drive. And she raised the kids. Then the kids' kids, and she did it right. Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry. When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly. All my life you've been that angel in disguise saying. [hook: john legend]. They used to tell me. I hope you learn to make it on your own. And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone. I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose. I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know. Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything. Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams. And when you get it all just remember one thing. Remember one thing. That one man could change the world. That one man could change the world.

outro,"Okay now, why you wanna go and do that, do that?. Sometimes I say that I'm the best, I guess I had to prove that. You know I had to cop that mansion on the hill and pool that. You know I don't rely on 8 balls, no, I never pooled that. You know I always like the best, roll it up and pull that. Now baby, don't get too deep on me, I might have to pull back. I got weed rolled, drinks po'd if you wanna do that. And I be in and out of love, the ogs be like true that. Cause you know sometimes man, that shit can get way too irritating. Say the wrong thing to the right girl, you might not make it. Dark skin with a lightskin girl like taye diggs. And you go from tryna save her to her taking your savings. And when she do, man, watch how them bitches shit talk. Wonder how they would feel if our lives got criss-crossed. What if you lost your homie and you felt like kriss kross?. Double cross, I swear that christians don't even get this cross. Talk so much shit that a nigga pissed off. She talk so much that she done fucking made my dick soft. Pushing all my buttons, this ain't fucking pinball. I guess women are sometimes like a jigsaw. Sometimes you hit a lick, sometimes you get ripped off. Sometimes you gotta sit, sometimes it's time for lift-off. Sometimes I just shut up and let my wrist talk. It be like ""we don't got time for bullshit, dawg"". You know I'm 1 of 1, just like the prototype. You look like the ""um, you owe me"" type. Oh, hardly never taking pictures, not the photo type, no. Please don't instagram this shit and be up on me like. ""Oh, you owe me likes"". Man, I swear these bitches don't know. What the fuck is more important to em. The more I kick philosophy, the more I'm boring to em. The more champagne I pop, the more I'm pouring to em. I just hope that's not the only single thing that's going through em. I hop up on a beat like it's the '08 me. When we was riding four deep, boy, no ac. Headed to the game for okay seats. Now I'm courtside at okc, I know kd. And all these singing bitches know me like do-ray-mi. Fa-so-la-ti-do but dough come first. No late fees, kool-aid smile, colgate teeth. The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks. I be in and out of cars like a fucking crash dummy. Spending money till it's dizzy but I still stash something, you know. But I'm tryna get that real real money, like um. White people with a black son. And first time I met oprah, that was motivation. Went from standing in court to starting up a corporation. Went so hard last night that we made the morning paper. Plus my girl's rated r, all your hoes overrated, damn. Niggas say I changed, how they damn how they do. Say I'm hard to get in contact with, oh, is that true?. But what about now? 313. 515-8772, Bitch, call me"

I always wanted to wear that ice. I always wanted paradise. I always wanted paradise. Look, now it don't take a lot to make you rich. I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit. Man, I feel like money is the best drug. Sometimes, hate can be the best love. Walkin' in like I got cameras on me. Niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me. Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie. Got a pretty young girl look like janet on me. She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers. Till we crash up the whole database. I bring it home like I'm base to base to base. Closet lookin' like planet of the bathing apes. What you think this life just landed on me?. My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie. And we came straight out of those abandoned homies. Every wish we ever had got granted, homie. And I'll never take that shit for granted. Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite. Back before I got paid any advances. Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing. Nigga, never did I slip or I panic. Even if I was the captain of titanic. Riding through the north atlantic, homie. I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie. All the fruits of my labor organic, homie. Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it. And a good guy can change, 'specially if he saw change. So fuck is my ransom, homie?. Money bag, money bag, money bag. Money bag, money bag, money bag. Money bag, money bag, money bag. Money bag, money bag, money bag. I always wanted to stunt so hard. I always wanted to ride that whip. I always wanted to fuck that bitch. Thank you God, I fucked that bitch. I always wanted to live this life. I always wanted to wear that ice. I always wanted paradise. I always wanted paradise. Straight up, finally famous, nigga. I always wanted paradise"
platinum and wood,"[Verse 1]. Come roll with a nigga, get high with a nigga. Count stacks with a nigga, fuck hoes with a nigga. Back in high school we used to trade clothes with my niggas. Back when Icebreaker and Girbaud. Was like the wardrobe for the killers, we pose for the pictures. Stunting on hoes, I stunt with my bros. Real go-getters, I swear being broke didn't fit us. Like new T-shirts, new jeans, new hats. You know, spending gas money on everything except gas. Spending my last on the shit that won't last. Back when 20 dollars would impress that ass. A movie and popcorn and caress that ass. Overdress and undress that ass, god bless that ass. It was me and my dawgs, summer on summer. Riding around like we dumber on dumber. Whipping that Toyota like it's a Hummer. What happened to those days? I really do wonder. When all I did was safe sex, latex. The first time I slipped up, wished I had a homemade Aids test fuck. But I ain't flunk once. Back before I got drunk once. I was smoking on haze, all in a daze. My homies would call and say, ""nigga, come roll"". [Break]. The [?] used to get it man. You know what I'm mean. Just hustle hustle hustle, you know we [?] man. So we just had to let our nuts hang and just, shit, boss up and learn the game. [Verse 2]. Man, I'm straight up off the 7 Mile, they call that the better mile. Tryna get a house up in the woods off on 11 Mile, bet it now. One time for the D, Girls that hold me down Corretta style. Free Juan, let him out. And everything I want off in the world is a must-have. I realised that at the bus stop with a bus pass thinking ""fuck rap"". Cause there's niggas in the streets. Getting money under my nose that I must stash. I've seen people get murked who ain't deserved that shit. Cops should've protect-and-served and shit. But still pull me over, disrespect and search my shit. Ask ""why the attitude? "" cause bitch, you deserve that shit. Bang bang bang, how do you maintain. The same brain and mind in a city of Aks and K9s?. When only language they know English and gang signs. Fuck it all though, I'm repping till the world blow, come roll. [Break]. Well shit I'm just you know I'm proud of lil' bro man. That nigga listened and he was able to stay focused man and through all the adversity man and through all the hood politics. But he seen it, he was with it, he was on it, you know? I mean like I say the [?] man, shit that's what we know the city man, that's for the city man all fucking day. [Outro].

And I can't lie, the price'll probably go up when I wear it. I'm just D-Town reppin'. And makin' all these niggas who second guessed it regret it. Regret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets. At least I realise now how much I loved Ashlee Marie. And when it's all said and done I'd probably give her my knee. Cause she put up with too many games not to have her a ring. Man she almost cried when she seen me on TV on BET. Just making it seem easy. Standing next to Common Sense and Yeezy. And the whole world's seen me. Bitch I know you seen me. (Been this way before). (Dream of finding so much more). ""Man, I wake up to a wet dream. Everyday's a Friday and every nights a sex scene. Every week is fashion week and every day I'm pressed clean. Detroit's Angel, I even got red wings. I'm headed to the ball, me and three prom queens. My life's prom night and guess who the Prom King. They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King. Everybody know I'm coming soon like LeBron's ring"". You tell me that wasn't verse of the year. Man that shit deserves a hearse and a tear. Swear to God I'm overlaid, all my girls get overf-cked. All my deals be overpaid and all my joints get over stuffed. Finally Famous bitch, there aint a f-cking thing that's over us. So take that check out and owe it up. Man I turned impossible possible. And what these niggas can barely see in the optical. The same teacher who told me rappin' is what not to do. Said I'm throwin my life away if I drop outta school. Want me to come speak to the kids, the point I gotta prove. Is that I did everything they told me not to do. After I went down the road, they told me not to cruise. They aint know that was my road to success. Now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through. My dream girl is every night, my dream car is optional. My old school look like a T-Rex, I should feed her fossil fuels. Man, I turn my enemies to molecules. Little hoes. Without any preparation, I exceed these expectations. Man, they wanna see me dead, but I gave them dedication. I'm yellin' f-ck em all, with a hundred exclamations. Cause I'mma be the man til my f-cking expiration. B-I-G, I do it. This goes out to my muthaf-cking city. Detroit, Westside to be exact. Right over there on Northline.... [Outro]"

We could fuck up the couch in the club like it came from Ikea. Goin' so hard the whole night is a blur. Older women be like, ""damn, you're mature"". I say you the one, but goddamn I got nerve. [Hook x2 Refrain]. [Verse 2]. Okay, I sip the kamikaze while I bend the body. And I whip the Maserati like I'm Ricky Bobby. I be mobbin', I be mobbin' like I'm Gotti.

They ain't gonna let you get the fountain in the front with the fist. They gonna give you courtside at the Clips. But never on the shit, they ain't on that gunner shit. Well, fuck giving it to me, I'mma take that shit. Forget crackin' the code, I'mma break that shit. I'mma calamari steak that shit. And cause so much ice, me and my dogs gonna skate that shit. Bitch do it so big you can't escape that shit. Hoes tryna have my baby just to Ricki Lake that shit. I hate that shit. Girls handing me their heart, how could I not break that shit?. [Hook Refrain]"

toyota music,"[Refrain 1]. Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD. Selling D, feeling like the 70s. Getting paid like we seventy. [Verse 1:]. Float around my town like it's the motherfucking seven seas. Hit the club, lose seven Gs, fill it all on seven D's. Spilling liquor rest in peace, rest in my G's, rest with her [?]. Start the day dissecting weed, then strategize then rest my team. Same show, different seats, same game, different league. Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see. Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see. Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see. Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see. Bitch. [Verse 2:]. I was thinking about the ice that I put on, money that I've blown.

Drugs and women coming too. Got my family living comfortable. Got me thinking I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. [Refrain 2].

voices in my head/stick to the plan,"Voices in my head sayin' I could do better, damn. Voices in my head sayin' that I knew better. (You know better, what the fuck!). I done seen this shit happen. a hundred times on the regular. But I still crossed the line like I'm blind, damn. Voices in my head saying I could do better. (You always do the same shit). [Verse]. This was supposed to be the last time, last hit. Last call, last feel, last trip, last run. That's what I always tell myself, huh, damn. This was supposed to be the last one, last two. Last flip, last you, last me, last night. Doing every single thing my parents warned me about. (You're a fucking disappointment) 'Til I wore 'em out, shit. [Hook].

Stick to the, plan, to the plan. Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing. Stick to the, plan. [Verse 1]. Stay focused. Don't let these niggas see your emotions. Stick to the notion, stay in motion. Remember soon as you stand still. So will everything else you notice. Make sure all your inner actions end with actions. If you stacking fronting and back in. Subtract if it isn't adding.

Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing. Stick to the, plan, to the plan. Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing. Stick to the, plan. [Verse 2]. Stay focused. Pay attention who you getting close with. Distance yourself from negative energy. Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me. I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy. I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary. I, I, I, no you need to buckle down. Have people asking where you at. And wondering why you never wanna come around. You know that effort gon' come around. Big face like Zordon. You bought the watch but can't afford the time. Even if you running out of breath. Weight of the world doing lots of reps. Time to get this generation. Last one and then the next two outta debt. And they gon' pay you back with respect. Just stick to the plan, still we can chill. Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills. I realized there's no dream that I can't fill. I manifested all while I'm the man still. (Bitch I'm the man). [Verse 3]. Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking. Bullet to the head might be the way to free it. If I leave my body I can free the spirits. Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking. Wishing I could go back to the nineties. Back when I was dreaming. Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan. Early 2000s Detroit. might as well been the hell with demons. Wondering when I started it, the losing grip. Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean. You either drown or canoe through it. Voices in my head said I'm used to it. Some help me to lose. and some help me maneuv' through it. When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it. I know in life you either blow it or blew it. And at the end of life. it's gonna feel like you flew through it. I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head"

Leaving the crib a hundred deep like we going to march. Okay, I pin her on the wall like she go with the art. Trying to keep up with me, oh, I know that shit hard. And I'm going too far. Niggas ask me who I'm going with. I told them my heart, the best beat thus far (the best). My dog Earlly telling jokes, man I'm laughing at that. I had a dream I rode with Rosa Parks. in the back of the 'Bach (damn). And we was blowing a blunt and she was packing a strap. Like damn, it do feel good to be black in the back. Going so far back, it felt like I was back in the act. (swerve, swerve). Gear up, tryna bring him back home like, up back. Europe, I love pussy so good. It taste like syrup, mixed with Ciroc, and coconut (whoa). A slick bitch will make you tie your laces. I'm never getting sick, sipping ginger echinacea. The voice being broke, yeah, I need that separation. To make that paperwork for me and my 'ministration. (for the dawgs). [Chorus]. Big dawg, autobiography. Make moves with the bros, no choreographies. She told me I'm the one, I looked over, said obviously. Then looked up in the mirror like. who the fuck stopping me, huh?. Who stopping me, nigga?. Shit, who stopping me? (who stopping me?). At the top, my girl the only one on top of me, nigga. Who stopping me? Huh?. Who stopping me? (who stopping me?). Keep, keep it going, don't stop for me (don't stop). [Bridge: Big Sean & Nazar√© Pereira]. Don't stop, don't stop. Don't stop, don't stop. Yeah, if Lil Metro don't trust you, need shots. (bah! bah! bah!). (Don't stop, don't stop). O sol vive semÔªø amor. (Don't stop, yeah). Eu n√£o vivo sem te ver. (Shit, you know I ain't gon' stop). Quem chega na mar√© cheia √© cantiga de bem querer. (Nah, you wanna, he said take your clothes off). O sol vive semÔªø amor. Eu n√£o vivo sem te ver. (Yeah, take that shit off, do that dance I like). Quem chega na mar√© cheia √© cantiga de bem querer. . [Verse 2]. Don, Don. Look, baby, I want the full thing, not the teaser (no). Fuck a teaser, I'm the full feature (whoa). This African-American express mixed with this Visa. Can get me in and out of anywhere I need to (oh God). And no more disrespecting me. We grew up poor, I changed my whole family trajectory. (respect). You couldn't see these type of checks. if you was Einstein on Jeopardy (whoa). Self-made to make that hell of a recipe (goddamn). And if you not down with me, you offending me (no). I'm so righteous, I'm praying for my enemies (pray). 'Cause they gon' need that shit. for whatever they go and guess on me (yup). Turn they ass to history then get back making history. See I'm the type to get a check and invest it. Buy some land and protect it (whoa). Live off the interest and give my family the rest (straight up). And then start from square one. on some first cigarette shit in a whole new direction. (Don, Don). And I pray you got the courage to flourish. On all your urges, where it's a new dream or refurbished. (whoa). Understand nothing's off limits if it's on this Earth, bitch. So let's get to work, bitch. [Chorus]. Big dawg, autobiography. Make moves with the bros, no choreographies. She told me I'm the one, I looked over, said obviously. Then looked up in the mirror like. who the fuck stopping me, huh?. Who stopping me, nigga?. Shit, who stopping me?. At the top, my girl the only one on top of me, nigga. Who stopping me? Huh?. Who stopping me?. Keep, keep it going, don't stop for me. . [Outro: Big Sean]. Don't stop, don't stop. Don't stop, don't stop. Yeah, if Lil Metro don't trust you, need shots. (bah! bah! bah!)"
"win some, lose some (feat. jhen√© aiko)","[Hook: Big Sean and Jhene Aiko]. You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life. I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right. (Okay, you got ahead tonight). Man, that doesn't make it right. Man, that doesn't make it right. How do you sleep at night?. [Verse 1: Big Sean]. Sean, nigga you on, damn, nigga, you on. You was a millionaire but your niggas is still at home. Damn, nigga, you did it, but damn it you did it wrong. You got time for that gig, but not time for the phone. Got it right with your ends, but fucked it up with your friends. I seen your ass up on Tv, touched up on them twins. You don't know about hard times, you clutched up in that Benz. Get tired of fuckin' hoes then get to fuckin' their friends, whoa. Niggas want handouts, and I only got two. Now I'm on the phone talkin' to my mom like I only got you. Gettin' dressed up for court, that's a law suit. Ain't wearin' V necks, but niggas ask what happened to the crew. Now I'm in court for some shit I didn't do. Cause of my nigga, knowin' my career could've been through. So when it's time to travel management say I only need two. Listenin' to them when I'm the one that makes the rules. I'm just a victim of the life though that I ain't tryna lose. This the dream, I had a wake up call and missed snooze. Lately though my family been too happy. I just turned my mama hooptie to a new Caddy. People thinkin' I'm rich and I wish they knew that. I been signed for four years and I'm just able to do that. Worry 'bout my next Rolex time piece. My nigga Tone worry 'bout our sis, Shanice. We supposed to be the role models. No wonder why she wanna smoke weed and skip college. [Pre-Hook: Big Sean]. Is this the example I'm tryna set?. Are these the people I'mma forget?. Are these the times I'mma regret?. Livin' life wishin' I could hit reset but, but. [Hook]. [Verse 2: Big Sean]. Okay, you win some, lose some, break some, bruise some. Life could be a test, multiple choice, choose some. Choose one, stick with it, man, prove some. Sometimes the best teachers is ourselves goin' through somethin'. Real life will teach your ass way fucking fast. I always thought my last girl was supposed to be my last. I got four aunties, two uncles, one dad. One mom, two brothers, and 200 niggas mad. And it's only one me, divide it and do the math. I'm the one that dropped out, got no time for the class. How am I supposed to have time for everyone I just said?. I don't even have time for everything in my head. On my way to see Kim and Ye both tie the knot. Wishin' me and you were no strings attached, but were nots. Man thats drama, drama drama. So deep that call each others mamas' mamas. We need a break I mean comma, comma comma. I'm tryin, homie. But she always picks the wrong time, my phone's dyin' on me. In the bed cryin' on me, talkin' lyin' on me. It sucks to hit the internet and see you're lyin' on me. [Pre-Hook Hook]. [Outro]. See, the mind is a fucking trickster. It can fuck you 'round, but your heart will never lie to you. And that's why people love you, Sean. Because you talk to them from the heart. (Thanks, dad). That's why you're magical, Sean. It's no mistake that you're where you are right now. You speaking that from your brain, but they hear you from your heart. Because people can see your bullshit. And I know I'm talking a lot of shit. (No, you're not). But I want you to hear that. Because I'm a great motherfucker, man. And I'm very modest. You know, I am. And I know a lot of shit. They know when you bullshit. They don't even intellectualize it. They feel it. Life is a feeling process"
you don't know (feat. ellie goulding),"[Intro]. You know what you do. You know what you do. You know what you see. You know what you do. You know what you - you don't know what you do!. [Verse 1: Big Sean]. How about we pretend all these niggas not around. And get fucked up like we was out of town. Woah, then go get fucked up and go get out of town. (Swerve, swerve). And tell ourselves that one time doesn't count, tell me. How fucked up you down to get. A pound is it, [?] a thousand tears. Red cup yeah, that's college year. Free liquor got it on scholarship. Bitch act like you don't know what's up. Act like it ain't my crew blowing up. Lose not to much champagne, no throwing up. One time for the set, please go throw it up. It's Finally Famous, overbooked, overpaid and overpriced. But don't get it twisted, that shit ain't happen overnight. Had dreams of balling now I'm NFLing. Let her spend the night, she feel like Cinderella. All she tell me is. [Hook: Ellie Goulding]. You don't know what you do!. You know what you do. You know what you do. You don't know what you do!. You know what you do. You know what you do. And you don't know what you do!. It's just a feeling inside me. And you don't know what you do!. It's just a feeling inside me. You don't know what you. [Verse 2: Big Sean]. I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get dressed up. I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get messed up. Heart breaker, young heart breaker. When you get in the game. I swear the whole world commentates you. But man, I don't give a fuck what they saying. I don't give a fuck about opinions. I don't give a fuck about feelings. I ain't no dentist, either I did, I do or I didn't. You could try to tell me how to live my life, I ain't hearing it. I must be doing something right. if every mill comes with a spare I guess. Straight, straight, straight up out that dirt. but my t-shirt clean, ohh. Do it for the city, that's the 313. That's unnecessary, fuck her like she my secretary. Ass and face is hereditary, her momma, shit, legendary. You don't know what you do. [Hook: Ellie Goulding]. You don't know what you do!. You know what you do. You know what you do. You don't know what you do!. You know what you do. You know what you do. And you don't know what you do!. It's just a feeling inside me. And you don't know what you do!. It's just a feeling inside me. You don't know what you. [Outro: Big Sean]. Go, go, go, go. go. Can't let that high go to waste I feel high on. [Some Poles, some poles, some poles. some poles, some poles]. Man, watch your back I swear man. some of these niggas be. [Hoes, hoes, hoes, hoes, hoes]. But I'mma live this like I swear that's all I know. Know, know, know, know, know, know"
