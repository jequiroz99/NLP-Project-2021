21 questions,"[50 Cent]. New York City, you are know ridin with, with 50 Cent, you gotta love it. I just wanna chill and twist a lot. Catch sunshine in my 745. You drive me crazy, shorty I. Need to see you and feel you next to me. I'll provide everything you need and I. Like your smile, I don't wanna see you cry. Got some questions that I gotta ask and I. Hope you can come up with the answers babe. [Nate Dogg]. Girl, you seem to love me now. Would you love me if I was down and out. Would you still, have love for me?. Girl, you seem to love me now. Would you love me if I was down and out?. Would you still, have love for me?. [50 Cent]. If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?. If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?. If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century. Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?. If I went back to a Hoop-D from a Benz. Would you poof and disappear, like some of my friends?. If I was hit and I was hurt would you be my side?. If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?. I get out and peel a nigga cap and chill in drive. I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside. If I ain't rap 'cause I was flip burgers in Burger King. Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feeling me?. In the bed, if I use my tongue would you like that?. If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?. Now we can have a little drink, you know a Nightcap. And we can go do what you like, I know you like that. [Nate Dogg]. Girl, you seem to love me now. Would you love me if I was down and out?. Would you still, have love for me?. Girl, you seem to love me now. Would you love me if I was down and out?. Would you still, have love for me?"
till i collapse,"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired. Feel weak, and when you feel weak. you feel like you wanna just give up. But you gotta search within you. you gotta find that inner strength. And just pull that shit out of you. and get that motivation to not give up. And not be a quitter. no matter how bad. you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. [Eminem]. Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps. long as you feel 'em. Till the day that I drop you'll never say. that I'm not killing them. 'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop penning 'em. And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem. Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women. are caught in webs spin and hauk venom. Adrenaline shots of penicillin. could not get the illing to stop. Amoxacilin is just not real enough. The criminal cop killing hip-hop. filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners. Your coming with me, feel it or not. you're gonna fear it like I showed you. the spirit of god lives in us. You hear it a lot, lyrics the shock. is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up. For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot. listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck. [Chorus - NateDogg]. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse. [Eminem]. Music is like magic there's a certain feeling. you get when you're real. And you spit and people are feeling your shit. This is your moment and every single minute. you spend trying to hold onto it. 'Cause you may never get it again. So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can. And when your run is over. just admit when it's at its end. 'Cause I'm at the end of my wits. with half this shit that gets in. I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in. It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie. Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me. But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy. so when I'm not put on this list. the shit does not offend me. That's why you see me walk around. like nothing's bothering me. Even though half you people. got a fucking problem with me. You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me. The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me. [Chorus - NateDogg]. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse. [Eminem]. Soon as a verse starts. I eat it at MC's heart. What is he thinking?. How not to go against me? Smart. And it's absurd how people hang on every word. I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve. But I'll never be served. my spot is forever reserved. If I ever leave earth. that would be the death of me first. 'Cause in my heart of hearts. I know nothing could ever be worse. That's why I'm clever. when I put together every verse. My thoughts are sporadic. I act like I'm an addict. I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers. But I don't want to go forth and back. in constant battles. The fact is I would rather sit back. and bomb some rappers. So this is like a full blown attack. I'm launching at them. The track is on some battling raps who want some static. 'Cause I don't really think. that the fact that I'm Slim matters. A plaque of platinum status is whack. if I'm not the baddest. [Chorus - NateDogg]. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse. Until the roof. The roof comes off. Until my legs. Give out from underneath me. I will not fall. I will stand tall. Feels like no one could beat me"
music & me,"[Nate Dogg]. Hey OG, could you tell how to find some good weed. I need it homie oh so fast. That last bag was the best weed I've ever had. Bass so deep, I can't even seem to feel my feet. Girls so fine, I can't help it got to make this one mine. I hit em with my, gangsta leans. They can't seperate my music from me. [Chorus]. Music and me [3x]. Music, my music and me. [Nate Dogg]. Time does change, but the music it remains the same. I hit em with the music from the slave. Oh my goodness, what my ancestors gave. I don't want u to think I don't know. They tought me how to reach deep down and touch the soul. Without my music, where would I be. You tought me how to cry and still remain a G. You keep alot of soldiers at ease. And together the next level proceed. [Chorus]. [Nate Dogg]. Music and me, go together perfect harmony. Soft and mellow, oh so hard it will make your speakers explode. Stay with me, and together we will live out this. dream. My music and me. Music and me [4x]. My music and me. Music and me [4x]. My music and me"

never leave me alone,"Chorus(Nate):. Never Leave me alone (never leave me alone). Leave me alone (never leave me alone). never leave me alone (Never leave me aloooone). leave me alone (Never leave me alone). Never leave Me alone. Verse 1 (Nate Dogg):. They tell me that temptation.....ooh, is very hard to resist. You tell me that you want me....I tried to hide my feelings, D-O-G's. ain't supposed to feel like this. You can call it what you want to....But I don't even know what it is. You've got me singin' in the morning....you bring me breakfast in my bed. and when it hurts you rub my head. I'll ask you one time only....baby, won't you be there when it's hectic. When I don't have a hit record (Never leave me alone). Chorus. Verse 2 (Nate Dogg):. I've traveled so many places....I've seen so many faces. There were times I didn't think I'd make it through (alone). I went through so many phases....that got me so many cases. Three strikes you're gonna' then what you gonna do. I guess I'll call my lady....and tell her to kiss my baby. They tell me that crime is all I know how to do. Tell him his daddy's sorry....let him know all about me. There's one more thing I'd really like for you to do. Chorus. Verse 3 (Snoop Dogg). Somebody was naughty when they snitched on me. And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century. I'm mobbin' through the county mainline. back in 9500 just tryin' to handle mine. Spittin' game at the homies about the good ol' days. As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to Chino. I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo. And my nigga Spanky too. It's true that the dirt I did from an O.G. to a snotty nose kid. Got me caught up in the rapture like maze days gone by. And real G's gon cry. But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky. And hope my baby boo ain't fuckin niggas on the outside. But what's the chance it ain't crackin. If I was out and she was in I'd probably be mackin. I can't lie. So I say I would now my girl in a world of playahood. A playa should show a nigga love and look our. But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out. So keep away better yet stay away. And hope I get out one day, OK. But if I don't I guess this is home. My girl is trippin she got a block on the phone."

Another victim I would love to delete. Come one come all. Taste the agony of defeat. But I know how sneaky niggas can be. When e're they fall. Some niggas try to take my cash. Dumb niggas try to make me blast. These days it's kinda hard to laugh. I gotta host of new friends I never had in the past. Some niggas try to take my cash. Dumb niggas try to make me blast. These days it's kinda hard to laugh. I gotta host of new friends I never had in the past. Stone cold. [Chorus - x4]. Hey let's party y'all. All I wanna do is have a good time. Tonight it's goin down.

Earn your keep. Regulators, mount up 88. It was a clear black night, a clear white moon. Warren g. was on the streets, trying to consume. Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk. Just rollin in my ride, chillin all alone. Just hit the eastside of the lbc. On a mission trying to find mr. warren g. Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak. All you skirts know what's up with 213. So I hooks a left on the 2-1 and lewis. Some brothas shootin dice so I said let's do this. I jumped out the ride, and said what's up?. Some brothas pulled some gats so I said I'm stuck. Since these girls peepin me I'ma glide and swerve. These hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb. Won'tcha think of better things than some horny tricks. I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix. I'm gettin jacked, I'm breakin myself. I can't believe they taking warren's wealth. They took my rings, they took my rolex. I looked at the brotha said damn, what's next?. They got my homey hemmed up and they all around. Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight. Pound for pound. They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown. I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down. They got guns to my head, I think I'm going down. I can't believe this happenin' in my own town. If I had wings I could fly, let me contemplate. I glanced in the cut and I see my homey nate. Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole. Nate dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold. Now they droppin and yellin ' it's a tad bit late. Nate dogg and warren g had to regulate. I laid all them busters down. I let my gat explode. Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode. If you want skirts sit back and observe. I just left a gang of those over there on the curb. Now nate got the freaks and that's a known fact. Before I got jacked I was on the same track. Back up back up cause it's on n-a-t-e and me. The warren to the g. Just like I thought they were in the same spot. In need of some desperate help. The nate dogg and the g-child. Were in need of something else. One of them dames was sexy as hell. I said ooh I like your size. She said my car's broke down and you. Seem real nice would ya let me ride?. I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell. The next stop is the eastside motel. I'm tweaking into a whole new era. G-funk step to this I dare ya. Funk on a whole new level. The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble. Strings. We brings. Melody. G-funk. Where rhythm is life and life is rhythm. If you know like I know you don't wanna step to this. It's the g-funk era funked out with a gangsta twist. If you smoke like I smoke then you high like everyday. And if your ass is a buster 2-1-3 will regulate"
one more day,"[Intro:]. We would like for you to help us welcome a very distinguished speaker. He hails from the DPG. Would you please stand and welcome the one, the only. OG Nate Dogg. [Verse 1:]. Now I was about eight when I caught my first case. My mother she turned her back and bowed her head in disgrace. Now I didn't do a thing, I was just standing by. Here's a message to the youngsters today: standing by you can die. Usually I'm in the house but today I snuck home. And when I walk down the Long Beach streets, what a lesson they taught. While walkin to the cornerstore a big mistake was made. My big homey I was walkin with decided he needed to get paid. So he loaded up his .32 and walked right in the store. He said ""Dear God, forgive me please but I can't be broke no more"". Now remember I was just eight, I thought this was a joke. What I'm sayin I ain't playin, it was funny til that nigga got smoked. Can you guess who that could've been quite easily?. but it wasn't so I'm lucky to be standing right here to see. [Chorus:]. One more day, one more. One more day. One more day, one more. One more day. [Verse 2:]. One more day, I'm hangin around so I can see. little Nate have a pocket full of money just like his daddy. Everyday I'm sellin big dope, it's all that I know. I ain't workin and I got a baby so don't axe me what for. One more day, gather round everybody and listen to me. I gotta another story about the penitentiary. One more day, see while I was servin cavi I forgot to think. Say for instance they catch me, little Nate'll never see. Now remember I'm sellin big dope but I'm packin my thangs. and every corner police watchin, I ain't crazy so I'm leavin the game (I'm. leavin the game). But I guess I waited too late cos they just caught me. Now I'm locked up, every mornin I am prayin for my son's safety. One more day, I'd like to thank you for watchin over my D-O-double G's. and would you keep an extra eye on Nate Dogg especially. I guess I'll just continue liftin from day to day. and if I live to see tomorrow, thankyou for one more day."

Leave your number on the cabinet. And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call. Next time I'm feelin kinda horny. You can come on over, and I'll break you off. And if you can't fuck, that day, baby. Just lay back, and open your mouth. Cause I have never. met a girl. That I love. in the whole wide world. Verse Two: Kurupt. Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke. I'd never have no motherfuckin indo to smoke. I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me. Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?. I have no love for hoes. That's somethin I learned in the pound. so how the fuck am I supposed. to pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe. I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times. And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it. Pass it to the homie, now you hit it. Cause she ain't nuthin but a bitch to me. And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me. i gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention. Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt. Hoe you'll never be my only one"
all about u,"You probably crooked as the last trick. Wanna laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch?. Thinking I had her but she had me in the long run. Its just my luck I'm stuck fuckin with wrong one, uh. Wise decisions based on lies we living. Skandalous times is games like my religion. You could be rolling with a thug. Instead you with this sweet scrub. Looking for some love. In every club, I see you standing like you want it. Well baby if ya got it better flaunt it. Let the liquor help you get up on it. I'm still tipsy from last night. Bumpin in walls as I pause. Addicted to the fast life. I try to holler but you tell me you're taken. Sayin you ain't impressed with the money I'm make. Guess its true what they telling me. Fresh out of jail lights hell for a black celebrity. So thats the reason why I call. And maybe you with it. Fantasies of the sweatin. Can I hit it? (hahaha). Addicted to the things you do. Its still true what I'm saying Boo. Cause this is All About U. Every other city we go. Every other video. (its all about you). No matter where I go. I see the same hoe. [repeat]. I'll make a promise if ya go with me. Just let me know, I'll have you hollering. My name out before I leave. Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga. I only hang out with the criminals and the drug dealers. I love niggas. Cause we coming from the same place. Witness me holler at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes. How can I tell her I'm a playa. And I don't even care. Creep though. Weed smokes in the air. Everywhere I go, its all about the groupie hoes. waiting for niggas at the end of every show. I just seen ya in my friends video. Never put you on my friends so here we go. Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm going through. It's All About U. (Yeah nigga, its All About U). [Chorus 2X]. Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?. It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew. Every other city we go and every video. Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty hoe. You think it's all about you?. Well, boo, I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas, too. You couldn't hold me back. It'll take a fatter track, a lyrical attack. Or perhaps it was a visual bluff. When I started to snaps all your ??. Straight in control. ?Flows are full?. Why hold a cold stroll?. Coldest set. I told you I'm as gold. And that's gold diggin. Cold diggin a ??. I slide in easily. Try a grizzly. Sluts know the cuts. I came to fuck. Try skeezin me. Runnin up in this. It's like ?? when I bring ya the most. I fuck a bitch from the West coast. [Chorus 4X]. (You know what I'm saying?). Every other city we go. I see the same hoes. In the studio, that kickin it in the video. It's gotta be the same ass and thighs. But you's a groupie baby, and don't look surprised. I can see it in your eyes, that you ain't nothing but a trick. Hanging with us, for some superstar dick. Want an autograph placed on her napkin. After she asks ""Ain't you the Top Dogg and don't you be rappin?"". She know whats crackin. Peep shows like Luke. From the limos, down to the Lexus coupes. We be flossin, and all females love that. Especially when you're dope, platinum, and your own ?. So when I met you. I really didn't have to say much. Cause me alone. Just made you want to taste and touch. Don't be trippin if I run up in you and your whole crew. I'ma still let you know girl, that it's all about you"
all night long,"It's a party y'all, tear the roof right off. Bounce with the double o-g. Alllllllll night looooong. Get off the wall, all of y'all. Wake up all the people who sleep. Alllllllll night looooong. Let's grooooooove lady. I don't wanna sleep with you, but maybe later on I do. Too smoooooooth baby. C'mon let me dance with you, girl I like the way you move. Home after a hard day's work. I wanna see the mini skirt. Tonight I wanna take you out. I wanna know what you about. I need to grab some juice and gin. I need to call a couple friends. I want to see you shake it and. I hope this party never ends. Where else would I go? what else would I do baby?. It's a party with you lady, ahhhhhhh. I know you want to, it's all up to you baby. We can party all night baby, ahhhhhhh. This party won't stop (all night long). Let's take it to the top, all night long (all night long, all night long). This is where I wanna be, my loved ones and me. All night long (all night long, all niiiiight). Go ahead get off the wall, tear the roof right off. All night long (all night long, allllll, all night). Welcome one, and welcome all,. to the city by the deep blue sea. Where they party all night long, all night long. All night [5x]"

Just about had me hooked, 'til I had to take a second look. Almost in love. Just about had me hooked, 'til I had to take a second look. Almost in love. [Verse 3]. The roses we picked just yesterday. Seemed to have wiltered away. And we've been on the ground. Looking for a four-leaf clover but there's been no luck. Baby I guess it's over. But we almost make it to the finished line called love. Almost and there's no need to raise our voices. Unless we're singing in harmony. But we're not 'cause there's no harmony. But we almost make it Almost. [Chorus]. Almost in love. Almost in love. Almost in love."

Spead dumpin lead bustin. Tell me you wanna be done. It's so many thangs on these streets. Gang bang on these streets. Heat holders. That hug wit slugs. And it's the thang to be either crips or bloods. Nate show these niggas how it was. And how nobody do it like we does cuz. [Nate Dogg]. Something about the west coast. Makes me bang the beats.

child of the night,"[Chorus: Nate Dogg]. It's gonna get in ya, child of the night. and the hood rolls on. How do I begin to, do this shit right. get my hustle on. [Ludacris]. Look here!. Now I'm a man of many talents and a man of my word. But on my path to see the light. sometimes my vision gets blurred. It's all a part of growin up and seein life at it's worst. Then tryin to iron out my wrinkles, puttin family first. It seems like the whole world is out for sinkin my boat. But with God as my navigator I'll be stayin afloat. And I admit to bein caught by many foolish distractions. Then I'm forced to pay the price as the result of my actions. I'm battlin with MYSELF and every DAY it's a war. Curiosity killed the cat, why am I Curious George?. Gotta keep my nose up outta thangs that ain't none of my biz. And just cause somethin looks don't really mean that it is. Get through the agony and anger, the pain and strife. And take the necessary steps to try to change my life. I got some questions for you Lord cause my mentality's hood. So why is everything that's bad for me feel so good?. [Chorus]. It's gonna get in ya, child of the night. and the hood rolls on. How do I begin to, do this shit right. get my hustle on. [Ludacris]. Now I'm a only child, so excuse some of my selfish ways. I got spoiled when I was young, spoil myself today. Oh but I feed at least a thousand stomachs. and how I've done it. is from the ground up a hundred miles and runnin. Dodgin and duckin everybody tryin to hammer me down. A self-made millionaire, baby look at me now. Can't tell me nothin still hungry as the day I began. Cause all I ever really needed was a pen in my hand. And a, pad in my lap, didn't matter in fact. Me and my momma lived in one room. and what's badder than that. was a young man forced to grow up at the age of 12. Tryin to get in where I fit, streets givin me hell. But yet I give it right - back, so how you like - that. Continue doin wrong 'til I was on the right - track. Tell me 'bout heavy money I might give it a PUSH. But a, bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Come on. [Chorus]. It's gonna get in ya, child of the night. and the hood rolls on. How do I begin to, do this shit right. get my hustle on. [Ludacris]. No matter how much older we get man. we all still children at heart. We all make mistakes, it's all good. Now I've tried plenty of times to get rid of my bad habits. Livin life on the cuttin edge, takin a stab at it. And learnin from my mistakes, try not to make 'em twice. Just admittin when I'm wrong, tryin hard to make it right. And baby, nobody's perfect in this world of ours. There's plenty people gettin stitches in this world of scars. But over time, pray to God that he can heal your wounds. Try to love and love again until they seal your tomb. Cause life is short if you don't know this it'll pass you by. That's why my head is in the clouds tryin to pass the sky. Never blinkin for a minute, keep my eyes on my foes. They wanna catch me in the open, bring my life to a close. Meanwhile that's why I'm bringin so much life to my shows. I've seen smiles I'm makin changes turnin glitter to gold. Don't let these devils play you down or belittle your soul. Just be happy with yo'self and it's so simple to grow. Come on"
concrete streets,"[Chorus]. I'm from the jungle with the concrete streets. You don't wanna rumble wit the real O.G.'s. Man I'll plant ya like a chronic seed. And ya girl done ran away wit me. I can show you how to catch these freaks. I can show you how to beat these streets. I can show you how to crack the safe. Let me show you how to break that bank. [Nate Dogg]. Ain't a damn thang changed. Still rollin on Dana Danes. Still packin steel claimin DPG. I always keep my thang. Always got weed on my brain. Always got a dime piece wit me. I'm gone let yo roll call. I'm gone ball till I fall. Keep it gangsta just for all of ya'll. Nate D, O, double G. Bangin from the west to the east. [Chorus]. [Nate Dogg]. No need to fight it baby. I know you want it lady.

Cause tragically the way this shit. Cracked off for Doggy Dogg was magically. And now I'm gettin' everything I'm supposed to get. But my friendship with niggaz always ends up as bulshit. I listen to my momma though. She always tried to prepare me. Byt how could she do what I. I mean I'm do or die. But my life on the streets. That shit is suicide. So to cope I got a dogg and a locc.

In front the White House, my ice out demandin' respect. Braveheartin' to the grave darlin' wavin' my sterling. From out the black Bentley it's off, spray till y'all fallin'. East to West Coast ballin'. Nate Dogg, Nas, and Kurupt, liven it up, dimes in the cut. Sizin' us up, y'all wanna fuck, gin and tonic my cup. And we live the good life, still chronic it up."

hush is coming,"""Turn my vocals up a little bit more Scott... all of 'em..."". ""Yeah... uh huh..."". [Verse 1]. I'm caught up inside a tornado and sucked in. By a rainstorm holding a hairdryer that's plugged in. Somewhere between the Renaissance Center and 8 Mile. Inside the Rock City that has spawned a unique child. And lightening strikes twice I was hit when they birthed me. And now I gotta live with this mouth that they cursed me. They said I gotta use it with tracks and try to fuse it. Don't abuse it and don't ever let 'em crack on your music. So I sit and watch the people that do it and don't pursue it. And instead I jot a little bit down then go review it. I just wait until I'm ready to leap and jump into it. Until I feel a little more confident I can do it. Not so many years later I've waited and now I'm here. To release a masterpiece on everybody in fear. I ain't holding nothing back in a world that's full of evil. My words can only injure or hurt so many people. I'm here to trade spaces shatter and blade faces. With guitars and bass lines and embrace and break stages. The pain'll come in phases for now it's just outrageous. When I'm knocking hear me cocking my gauge cause I'm impatient. [Chorus]. From the Motor City.... (Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming. (You ain't heard spread the word on down). Down to New Orleans.... (You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming. (I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming. From the penitentiary.... (Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming. (You ain't heard spread the word). To the criminals roaming the streets.... (You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming. (I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming. [Verse 2]. I've waited so long to unleash on these streets. A diary with more fury in sprees than Alicia Keys. My words are mere visions of movies with non-fiction. Intertwined in each rhyme that I spit with sweet diction. The rest are so pathetic and best are copasetic. By the time it hits you dead in the chest I hope you get it. I'm out to break laws slice and break jaws. Or I'll be on your stage with an axe and chainsaws. Of course my pains raw my brain is off a little. Ever since the first time I could rhyme and solve a riddle. Simon says go ahead and block the silence. And fuck with anybody who says to stop the violence. Go run and tell your parents I'm evil and I'm the devil. When it's gonna take a nation of mil to stop a rebel. Cause now it's all over I'm crazy and even zany. Lyrically Scorsese on a track by Mr. Shady. [Chorus]. From San Diego.... (Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming. (You ain't heard spread the word). All the way back to Queens.... (You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming. (I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming. This ain't a rumor.... (Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming. (You ain't heard spread the word). Remember you heard that from me.... (You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming. (I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming. [Verse 3]. My behavior gets erratic on tracks that got static. When I spit the bullets just keep coming it's automatic. I'm ill it's been said every letter I let sink. And left 'em dead inside a puddle of songs with red ink. I played away shy since the day I stayed high. And staged dive from the top of my roof at age 5. My mother always said that her son was gonna make it. If he wasn't gonna make it he'll have to go and take it. So now I'm on Geffen the whole world is trippin'. Cause another new MC from the D is off and flippin'. And this one's Lebanese do we have to say the bomb. Is he related to Osama Bin Laden or Saddam. I'm just a suicidal bomber on tracks and always killin'. Everything that ever gets in my way and such a villian. If you think you know me now then get ready because I'm grinning'. This ain't even near the end of Omega it's just beginning'. [Chorus]. From the City of Angels.... (Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming. (You ain't heard spread the word). To the streets of Mississippi.... (You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming. (I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming. For the players that's hatin'.... (Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming. (You ain't heard spread the word). You better start clearing the street.... (You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming. (I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming. (Tell 'em Nate what) Hush Is Coming. (Pull 'em out mafuckerz cause) Hush Is Coming. (Better run cause) Hush Is Coming. (Better duck mafuckerz cause) Hush Is Coming"

Man I been thinkin lately. About the way the world just be changin. Is it a sin to be chasin paper. I can't count the niggas dyin lately. It's the grave or incarceration. I know you hurt but you can't replace em. You go and dig a hole then erase em. You just created a smaller nation. A jail cell is all that's waitin. Look at all the progress you're makin. I really hope you're kinda patient. You facin 25 no probation. 2 for 1 is multiplication. You're freedom is all their takin. Is it best to be dead or pacin. All cos you couldn't take it. Chorus (x2). [Danny ""Butch"" Means]. How can I concentrate. With all the problems that I face. I often ask myself if there's a place. where I can get away (Where I can get away). I keep my head to the sky. And try to maintain my pace. If I don't then I'm gone. Somebody gone take my place. No need to go too fast. Cos I know a little time it takes. But my situation's bad. I'll be jackin soon at this rate. I ain't tryin to make you mad. It's a plain and simple fact you face. If you're broke you hurt most. From all the bullshit you take. Chorus (x2). [Nate Dogg]. Lately I've been feelin like givin up (Don't give up). The pain inside makes me wanna reach out and touch. Someone, anyone who feels that I ain't been hurt enough. You best duck or get stuck. Cos man I been hurtin for months. No more, no more, no more, no more. I've been hurtin a while. No more, no more, no more, no more. And I don't wanna hurt no more. No more, no more, no more, no more. Don't wanna hurt no more. But the rain keeps comin down."

I've seen about my friends and all the gangsta things we did, we did. Back in those days there was some who always said. You'll never make it no, you'll never get ahead of time. I guess I'm going for mine, contrary to what they said and I did. this is just to let you know. (Chorus) x4. I gonna make. I'm gonna make my money (money). No matter what they say to me, I'm gonna make my money. And anyone who don't believe, best stay away from me. Been on a mash for currency, since 1993. There ain't no way you stopping me. I'm determined as I can be. And if my funds get low again one thing I can guarantee. you catch me by the corner store sellin badass bags of weed. Not because I think it's cool, or because I think it's neat. It boils down to one simple fact, me and mines have got to eat. (Chorus) x4. I gonna make. I'm gonna make my money (money). x4. Tell me have you ever heard G-Funk. Tell me have you ever heard. Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate. (repeats through chorus). Tell me have you ever heard G-Funk. Tell me have you ever heard.

Remind yourself that can't nobody can bust like me. If this were my world every day they'll be. Another young brother claimin DPG. Raised from the good of dogs to make money. Why do niggaz talk about what they can't see. If this were my world I'd take my gangsta name. Set it at the top next to fortune and fame. Finally I got myself up out of them chains. If they lock you up dont let em count your brain. (Chorus). If this were my world (If this were my world) My world. If this were my world (If this were my world) My world.

They tell me makin' music's fun. When you got no shackles on your feet. (Chorus). No matter where I go. I'm lettin' people know. No matter where you go the grass is always green. No matter what you say. You gotta' release the chains."

I'm so fucked up I couldn't read my own writin' (Heh). Clash of the titan, (Yeah!) no propaganda. Big (?) hummin' for you Tony Montana. T-shirt, khakis, tucked in bandanas. Livin' amongst the most scandalous on the planet (Yo!). [Chorus x2]."

Time does change, but the music it remains the same. I hit em with the music from the slave. Oh my goodness, what my ancestors gave. I don't want u to think I don't know.

Yes I would do it, cause I can. If this were my world you know who I'd screw. all the motherfuckers that be screwin you. Not that I'm trying to get elected man. I would set trip because I can. If this were my world the holidays would be. one for famous black folk and one for me. Just in case you dont know who I be. Make a holiday for the G-Funk king. If this were my world things would go my way. Every single day I'd have one more day. And if ever anybody got in my way. All I can say is first we pray - first we pray. (Chorus). If this were my world (If this were my world) My world. If this were my world (If this were my world) My world. If this were my world (If this were my world) My world. If this were my world (If this were my world) My world. If this were my world you could bet I'd clown. Have a mini mansion in every town. Fan mail comin in from all around. Asking me where did I get that gangsta sound. If this were my world it would only be me. Standin on the top of the industry. Bouncin like a baller over tight-ass beats. Remind yourself that can't nobody can bust like me. If this were my world everyday there'd be. another young brother claimin D.P.G.. Raised from the gutter taught to make money. Why do niggaz talk about what they can't see. If this were my world I'd take my gangsta name. Set it at the top right next to fortune and fame. Finally I got myself up out of them chains. If they lock you up don't let em capture your brain. (Chorus). If this were my world (If this were my world) My world. If this were my world (If this were my world) My world. If this were my world (If this were my world) My world. If this were my world (If this were my world) My world. If this were my world, you now what I'd do. Buy me a spaceship and a condo on the moon. If this were my world, I'd have a low low crew. We'd go roll your hood and do what gangstas do. If this were my world. (Chorus) x2. If this were my world (If this were my world) My world. If this were my world (If this were my world) My world. If this were my world (If this were my world) My world."
never leave me alone,"Chorus(Nate):. Never Leave me alone (never leave me alone). Leave me alone (never leave me alone). never leave me alone (Never leave me aloooone). leave me alone (Never leave me alone). Never leave Me alone. Verse 1 (Nate Dogg):. They tell me that temptation.....ooh, is very hard to resist. You tell me that you want me....I tried to hide my feelings, D-O-G's. ain't supposed to feel like this. You can call it what you want to....But I don't even know what it is. You've got me singin' in the morning....you bring me breakfast in my bed. and when it hurts you rub my head. I'll ask you one time only....baby, won't you be there when it's hectic. When I don't have a hit record (Never leave me alone). Chorus. Verse 2 (Nate Dogg):. I've traveled so many places....I've seen so many faces. There were times I didn't think I'd make it through (alone). I went through so many phases....that got me so many cases. Three strikes you're gonna' then what you gonna do. I guess I'll call my lady....and tell her to kiss my baby. They tell me that crime is all I know how to do. Tell him his daddy's sorry....let him know all about me. There's one more thing I'd really like for you to do. Chorus. Verse 3 (Snoop Dogg). Somebody was naughty when they snitched on me. And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century. I'm mobbin' through the county mainline. back in 9500 just tryin' to handle mine. Spittin' game at the homies about the good ol' days. As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to Chino. I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo. And my nigga Spanky too. It's true that the dirt I did from an O.G. to a snotty nose kid. Got me caught up in the rapture like maze days gone by. And real G's gon cry. But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky. And hope my baby boo ain't fuckin niggas on the outside. But what's the chance it ain't crackin. If I was out and she was in I'd probably be mackin. I can't lie. So I say I would now my girl in a world of playahood. A playa should show a nigga love and look our. But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out. So keep away better yet stay away. And hope I get out one day, OK. But if I don't I guess this is home. My girl is trippin she got a block on the phone."

oh no,"[Mos Def]. Yeah. One for the treble, two for the bass. Welcome to the great incredible paper chase. Keep your boots laced if you want to keep pace. Oh No. Niggas ain't scared to hustle. It's been seven days, the same clothes. Ask them originals cause they know. Mos Def, Nate Dogg, and Pharoahe. Step away from the mic they too cold. The funk might fracture your nose. [Mos Def]. Say my name, say my name. Observe how I stake my claim, I independently lay it down. and played my game, my own two raise my flame. Cause dick ridin ain't my thang. I earned what they said I wouldn't. I got it the way they said I couldn't. But now I'm gettin it and they whole grill is crooked. Mad cause I'm gettin caked out from my bookings. When y'all was askin permission I just stepped up and took it. What! The kid's better buy my rookie card now. Cause after this year the price ain't comin down. And if you got a joint bubblin then get money now. Cause in a minute, there's gonna be some real trouble comin out. Just a warnin, as usual some cats wont heed it. The hard headed always gotta feel it to believe it. It's a shame that jealous gaze is too short to see it. But when they face hit the cement, they nod in agreement. We could play nice and decent, or dirty like the 7-1 Precinct. Call it a day or make it a long evenin. You keep on schemin, man give me some more reason. to have the women in your mama's church screamin ""Lord Jesus! "". Harder than y'all cause I'm smarter than y'all. I know that deep down it's got to be bothering y'all. Pay attention, watch fly gon' get larger than y'all. Put your pride on the rocks, make you swallow it all.

Queens salute to Pharoahe (you know). Step away from the mic they too cold. The funk might fracture your nose. Very contagious raps should be trapped in cages. Through stages of wackness, Pharoahe's raps are blazin. And it amazes - me how you claim thug. but go two-ways without SkyTel pagers. I'm intellectual, pass more essays ese's. than motorcade police parades through East L. A. More beef then deli's, thus what I vent is just. What you lust to vent is irrele'. Huh, hallelujah, Pharoahe Monch'll do ya. Maintain the same frame of mind - screw ya!. Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, preacher with scriptures. I'm equipped to rip ya, reach ya. Pharoahe and Mos is verbal osmosis. Coast to coast, we boast to be the most explosive here. Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis. The dosage is leavin you mentally unfocused here. MC's just - come on 'round. You're the next contestants on ""Catch-A-Beat-Down"". Don't be hesitant, sound cracks the sediment. It's evident we medicine for your whole town. Sky's the limit, game's infinite when I'm in it. All windows is tinted, how you seein me when I'm in it?. Rap, we got it on lock man, stop that. Put that mic back down, boy, drop that. Pharoahe's flows blows shows like afros. We hate y'all though, that's why Nate Dogg goes. Oh No. Niggas ain't scared to hustle. It's been seven days, the same clothes.

one more day,"[Intro:]. We would like for you to help us welcome a very distinguished speaker. He hails from the DPG. Would you please stand and welcome the one, the only. OG Nate Dogg. [Verse 1:]. Now I was about eight when I caught my first case. My mother she turned her back and bowed her head in disgrace. Now I didn't do a thing, I was just standing by. Here's a message to the youngsters today: standing by you can die. Usually I'm in the house but today I snuck home. And when I walk down the Long Beach streets, what a lesson they taught. While walkin to the cornerstore a big mistake was made. My big homey I was walkin with decided he needed to get paid. So he loaded up his .32 and walked right in the store. He said ""Dear God, forgive me please but I can't be broke no more"". Now remember I was just eight, I thought this was a joke. What I'm sayin I ain't playin, it was funny til that nigga got smoked. Can you guess who that could've been quite easily?. but it wasn't so I'm lucky to be standing right here to see. [Chorus:]. One more day, one more. One more day. One more day, one more. One more day. [Verse 2:]. One more day, I'm hangin around so I can see. little Nate have a pocket full of money just like his daddy. Everyday I'm sellin big dope, it's all that I know. I ain't workin and I got a baby so don't axe me what for. One more day, gather round everybody and listen to me. I gotta another story about the penitentiary. One more day, see while I was servin cavi I forgot to think. Say for instance they catch me, little Nate'll never see. Now remember I'm sellin big dope but I'm packin my thangs. and every corner police watchin, I ain't crazy so I'm leavin the game (I'm. leavin the game). But I guess I waited too late cos they just caught me. Now I'm locked up, every mornin I am prayin for my son's safety. One more day, I'd like to thank you for watchin over my D-O-double G's. and would you keep an extra eye on Nate Dogg especially. I guess I'll just continue liftin from day to day. and if I live to see tomorrow, thankyou for one more day."

All my demons always beggin' me to ride. [Ludacris]. Uh, now ever since ruffles had ridges, Luda's had bitches. Pimp, get more gums then baby pictures. Menages wit sistas, veins poppin' out like shimp, lobster. A-Town mobster, garage full of 6's, what can I say?. If something don't smell right, what can I spray?. Tec-9 incense, say for instance. See you in the distance, hit 'em in an instant. We so crummy, countin' mo' money. But stay strapped up like crash test dummies. Put 3 to ya tummy, 2 to ya throat. And bulletproof cars, we ride like the pope. Just in case, you don't make it home. You better super glue grip the chrome. 'Cause you was talkin' that yap and got put in the bed. Now it's a frog in ya throat like Ms. Piggy givin' head. [Chorus]."

Be prepared to blast, that's all that he ask, if he's to ride wit you. We gonna make some cash, and dash, you can toss him when ya through. [Chorus]. The hardest man in town. The hardest man in town. The hardest man in town. The hardest man around. Little big man, don't you see me lyin here; pick me up, if you dare. I'll make you're life easier, cuz I'll be pumpin fear. Disrespect, you don't have to take. If you see him comin, just wave me in his face. But you ain't the only one that got a friend like me. So hurry up, let's go, I'm kind of tired of being broke. I know you gotta get paid, I can show you the way. So take me home, polish the chrome. Load me up, and put me to his dome. I got a lot work to do, so toss me and be gone. You're a big man now. You're a big man now. You're a big man now. You're a big man now. I told you once before I'm pumpin fear. Nobody's gonna step to you, let them know I'm here. And if you have questions in the corner of your mind. Pull the trigger, and leave your questions behind."

Tossed the tall can on a campus off the limital. scanners takin' penitentiary chances. Sick wit it, off the ric wit it. Blue beenie knitted; freshly acquitted. Grind-grimey, the big body and the big body. Wit lyrics and 'draulics hotter than the Majave. Sellin', brubble bellin', career felon. Escalade 3-braid beer wearin'. Fuck it, I thug for free and thug to eat. Niggas call me ""Home of Cake"" cause I love the cheese. Gangstas, hustlas, pimps, if ya follow me. Let me see ya put them hands up like a robbery. I solemnly swear to stay down and slang the seed. I spit in the name of the streets. [Chorus: Nate Dogg W. C.]. I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll). I'm gon' stay fly (I'm gonna stay fly).

I'm gonna ball (I'm gonna ball). Hold my hood up high. In the name of the streets. [Verse]. This is for them geniuz. Da best is my East niazz. Both sides street niazz. This is for them DJ's coast to coast movin' this. Spin-ni-nin them turntables that bomp the Ruvian. Smashous, best trap us for cash and dump a blunt at ya's. Outta the mix-classes, this is for them riders, ridin' for the mims. Ghetto ass niazz on them big shiny rims (uh huh). Thrashin', you're back at ya, bring a debassa'. Got dropping on your drastic, another hood classic. Dump the ""Ghetto Heisman"" singing ""more cabbage"". A street niazz livin' on seek and kill status. Unlock the racked Def Jam cock it back.

I told a woman I don't love her but she wants to go. I told another that I want her but she wants to hoe. I ain't a hater I'm a player so I fucked 'em both. In the name of the streets. [Outro].

there she goes,"(feat. DJ Quik, Warren G). [Warren G]. Oh yeah I chill with Nate, Like I did as a youth. It's still 213, ain't nothin different with Snoop. Music is the tool I used to leave the hood with. Became my own man, I wish you would BITCH. I been around the world and back. Two times ain't nuthin like home its crackin. After all the women, the money and the TV shows. I'm not really tryin to see these hoes. [DJ Quik]. Now AMG said her eyes are the index to her soul. But when I look at her face, all I see is a ho. We sex playin, with the Hennessey, and she in the mood. While y'all see her as a broad dude, I see her as food. Take her back up to the bar to get her cigerette lit. I told her, ""I be buyin liqour like it Shh.."". She told me I'm a player motherfuu... Forget about it, she know the scam. And now she belly dancin to that Indian Jam. So hell, I'm a let her get a little more buzzed. Till she starts to get to slurrin and forget where she was. Take her purse out to her buddy car, back to the bar. For another round of drinks with a pla-ti-num star. I'm gettin conceded, a lil bit, the game owe me. I've been humble since my first hit, but back to baby. I'm a rub her on the belly, make her scoot down the couch. Look her right up in her eyes, and take some food out her mouth, She want it. [Chorus: Nate Dogg]. There she goes, the kind of girl that I wanted always. My favorite pro, oh I love how she got gangsta ways. I thought you should know, the way that I want it, I get it that way. Cant stand it no mo', nobody does it better than she. [Nate Dogg]. When I Wake up in the morning, fresh up outta my dream. I ain't even finish yawning, still as hard as I can be. Even tho I havent found her, I seen her when I was asleep. I'm pretty sure that she is out there. I'm pretty sure that there is some one else for me. [Bridge: Nate Dogg]. Hey ho, Hey ho, now that I found you, I wont look any further. Hey ho, Hey ho, now that I found you, I wont look any further. [Chorus]. [Nate Dogg]. The first time I ever saw her, I couldnt look her in her face. I tried hard to ignore her, but I couldnt walk away. When I finally got the courage, I couldnt think of what to say. To make a long story shorter, I better bust a different way. I was at the park one day, thats when I saw her face. She was kinda cavi to me. Had some nigga hangin on, I sent that busta home. And now she ridin with me.. THERE SHE GOES!!!. [Chorus] - 2X"
these days,"(Chorus) x2. These days, you gotta be strapped. I'm already knowin ain't nobody got my back. these days you gotta be down. who said it was easy claiming Dogg Pound. I believe I got good skills. we been makin music since we were kids. thats all I wanna do, for life. keepin it real until the day I die. obstacles get in my way. continue to mash and dont forget to pray. I keep my hand on my steel. because I love my life and I always will. whatever people say to me. I take it in stride I'm thinkin negro please. if you really dont know me. then you best back up, I suggest strongly. they started this DPG. until the day I D-I-E. for my L-I-F and E. no matter where I look thats all I see. and I know.... (Chorus) x2. Many niggaz cling to me. I think its because they see me on BET. cuz everybody knows my name. all the police think I'm serving cane. jealous niggaz call us out. but I dont worry long as I hear their mouths. if ever they decide to kill. you better be prepared because I know I will. I think I can guarantee. you dont wanna be standin next to me. before my final curtain call. I forsake save hen and wont be long. so if we bump hits in the streets. or even at some party. you niggaz really can't see me. my request is that you stop trying. before I let go.... Chorus x2. Daz-. Everyday, the 45 stays I'm jackin for whoever. I bustin takin now bowin down never. gotta watch my back for these coppers. as well as these niggaz that I kick it with. they stick you faster than these bitches will. since I'm pimpin everybody wants my riches. and I can't keep the Don from buying weed actin everytime. I smoke constantly and can't flinch me. from commitin the murders so I chill and puff the herb. who gots my back nobody. little John Gotti's layin niggaz down at the homey's party. all be goin crazy I guess we are bein who we are. really say the nigga gotta be a star. I gots to get mine and if I blast then its my destiny. if I die then it was meant to be intentionally. worry stressin I'm guessin no confession. when the murder take place set yourself protection. Chorus x4 to fade."
thugs get lonely toor,"See, it ain't easy bein' me. Life as a celebrity is less than heavily. I got these fakes and these back-stabbers chasin' me around. And it's always drama. Whevever I wanna get around mama told me. Long before I ever came up gotta be true. To watchya' do and keep ya' game up 'cause things change. And jealousy becomes a factor. Best friends at your wifes house tryin' to mack her. I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door. And I got no time to worry I'm steady wantin' more. Every day is a test, yes I try hard. But I'm strugg-a-lin' with every breath. I pray to god that the woman that I left at home, all alone. Ain't nothin' like tryin' to bone. Over the phone, in my mind I can see her naked. I can't take it. Got me shakin' at the thought that we can make it. I thought you knew. I'm rolling out on tour today. You getting sad because I'm goin away (naah). Chickenheads wanna play with me. You getting mad because you think I'ma sway. Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck. I hear them scream as soon as I hit the stage (naah). Still I be getting lonely for you. I'm coming home as soon as I make this pay (make this pay). I call you up long distance on the telephone. I wanna tuck you in. Even though I know I can't make it home. I whisper things in ya' ear like youre near me. Wonder if you feel me from far away. Or can you hear me. It seems to me that ya' jealous. 'cause I'm hustlin' and makin' money. With the fellas' in the back streets. Tryin' to trap me baby hold up. Thugs get lonely too! but I'm a soulja. And theres no way I'mma' stop makin' money. 'cause ya' attitudes changed and ya' actin' a little funny. Always complainin' sayin' we don't spend time. Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind. And hangin' up like you all that. And get mad when I'm tell you that. ""I'm busy baby, call back"". Please, ain't nothin' left to say to you. Thugs get lonely too. You know. I'm rolling out on tour today. You getting sad because I'm goin away (naah). Chickenheads wanna play with me. You getting mad because you think I'ma sway. Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck. I hear them scream as soon as I hit the stage (naah). Still I be getting lonely for you. I'm coming home as soon as I make this pay (make this pay). I sit alone in my room, drinkin' without a care. Talkin out loud to ya' like ya' there. Take ya' picture out my back pocket. Man it's on you the first face I wanna see. When I get home I wanna love you 'till the sun rise. Buckwild touchin' every wall in the house. Thug style put ya' hands on the headboard. Think of me drippin' sweat on top of you. Sick of scenes in yo' head that I'm makin' love. So turn the lights down. Reminice 'n relax 'cause baby right now. I feel in the middle of my stomach. You whisper in my ear baby tell me how you really want it. Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling. Scratch my back how you react. Let me know you feel me. 'cause everything I'm giving to you is so true. Thugs get lonely too. You know. I'm rolling out on tour today. You getting sad because I'm goin away (naah). Chickenheads wanna play with me. You getting mad because you think I'ma sway. Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck. I hear them scream as soon as I hit the stage (naah). Still I be getting lonely for you. I'm coming home as soon as I make this pay (make this pay). Yeah! thug life baby"
till i collapse,"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired. Feel weak, and when you feel weak. you feel like you wanna just give up. But you gotta search within you. you gotta find that inner strength. And just pull that shit out of you. and get that motivation to not give up. And not be a quitter. no matter how bad. you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. [Eminem]. Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps. long as you feel 'em. Till the day that I drop you'll never say. that I'm not killing them. 'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop penning 'em. And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem. Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women. are caught in webs spin and hauk venom. Adrenaline shots of penicillin. could not get the illing to stop. Amoxacilin is just not real enough. The criminal cop killing hip-hop. filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners. Your coming with me, feel it or not. you're gonna fear it like I showed you. the spirit of god lives in us. You hear it a lot, lyrics the shock. is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up. For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot. listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck. [Chorus - NateDogg]. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse. [Eminem]. Music is like magic there's a certain feeling. you get when you're real. And you spit and people are feeling your shit. This is your moment and every single minute. you spend trying to hold onto it. 'Cause you may never get it again. So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can. And when your run is over. just admit when it's at its end. 'Cause I'm at the end of my wits. with half this shit that gets in. I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in. It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie. Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me. But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy. so when I'm not put on this list. the shit does not offend me. That's why you see me walk around. like nothing's bothering me. Even though half you people. got a fucking problem with me. You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me. The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me. [Chorus - NateDogg]. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse. [Eminem]. Soon as a verse starts. I eat it at MC's heart. What is he thinking?. How not to go against me? Smart. And it's absurd how people hang on every word. I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve. But I'll never be served. my spot is forever reserved. If I ever leave earth. that would be the death of me first. 'Cause in my heart of hearts. I know nothing could ever be worse. That's why I'm clever. when I put together every verse. My thoughts are sporadic. I act like I'm an addict. I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers. But I don't want to go forth and back. in constant battles. The fact is I would rather sit back. and bomb some rappers. So this is like a full blown attack. I'm launching at them. The track is on some battling raps who want some static. 'Cause I don't really think. that the fact that I'm Slim matters. A plaque of platinum status is whack. if I'm not the baddest. [Chorus - NateDogg]. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse. Until the roof. The roof comes off. Until my legs. Give out from underneath me. I will not fall. I will stand tall. Feels like no one could beat me"
warrior part ii,"[Intro - Eminem]. Remix [echoes]. Lloyd Banks! [echoes]. Ha ha! [echoes]. [Verse 1 - Eminem]. It's like a throne that he dont even own. He wont sit down, given the crown he just throws it around. It's like a joke he's like a king, but he dont rule a thing. He dont want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry. He dont want the fame dont want the lute he's in this for a sport. Runnin suckaz with the competition round the court. He appreciates your support but he aint beggin for it. And you cant love it you can hate it but you cant ignore it. You cant be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short. But you cant fuck with his last joint or the one before it. And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys. And if I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it. [Chorus - Nate Dogg]. This Is The Story Of A Warrior U Kno U Kno It.

He's straight outta the neighborhood but Niggaz hate. They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate. Your stomachs ache while he's loungin at the big estate. And he hops in a 100 thousands with a Nigga's gate. House with just a bigger gate, houndin him was a big mistake. He wont surrender he'd rather give up a rib to break. Cuz he horrendous when they wouldnt lend a helpin hand. So he was sittin on green like a Celtic fan. Created a buzz so when you gotta mention his name. When you discuss him the illest playa that's in the game. And he's ridin with Em, 50 cent, Doc and them. G Unit records aint no motherfuckin stoppin them. [Chorus - Nate Dogg]. This Is The Story Of A Warrior U Kno U Kno It. Tru Warrior Go Ahead Make Some Noise. It AInt Nuthin To Be Makin Niggaz Paranoid. Hit Ur Corner Wit More Weapons I Dont Need My Boyz.

These niggaz got A Lot of Nothin. So those niggaz from the hood act like we owe em somethin. They talk crazy til we send this nigga in there to fuck em. Ask 'em if theres a problem and they'll say naw its nothin. He's been tryin to help em out, but since they fronted, fuck em. He dont care how they feel theyre makin em love em. He hold it down on his own the kid is really thuggin. He's rich now, he aint change since these Niggaz buggin. He pull a clip everything Niggaz try to buck him. Keep ya pistols on ya hip I show you we aint tuck em. Niggaz say they gon' get at him but they cant touch him. Try to catch em slippin, they creepin and he start bustin. [Chorus - Nate Dogg]. This Is The Story Of A Warrior U Kno U Kno It. Tru Warrior Go Ahead Make Some Noise. It AInt Nothin' To Be Makin' Niggaz Paranoid. Hit Ur Corner Wit More Weapons I Don't Need My Boyz.

I can give you somethin' you can talk about. I can turn this smile upside down. You ain't no G-Unit fuckin' clown. I can take your girl until I turn her out. The bootey layed all out. I can give you fuckin' somethin' to be mad about. And buy her rings and I back out. With my DNA all in her mouth"
where are you going,"People where are you going. People where are you going. Everybody wants to play the game. But nobody wants to lose. I see my people die everyday. That's why I sing the blues. Now tell me who wants to roll with me. Take a look at my world. I see some problems. Maybe you can help me solve them. Turn boys to men. And make women from girls. I see my loved ones turning to drugs. Almost everyday I lose another one. Where are you going I ask you one and all. Anyone can answer. I betcha' they dont know. People where are you going. People where are you going. What if I could save my nation. What if I could save my friends. If I had the whole worlds attention. What if people were really listening. I would tell them that I'm no good without them. I would tell them together we can stand. Another message to brothers, colors bother. I'd introduce them to the hardest man in town. Somebody thell me please. People where are you going. People where are you going. Where are you going I ask you one and all. Anyone can answer. I betcha' they dont know. People where are you going."
who's playin games?,"Just in case you didn't know, I blow (I blow). constantly for dough. I'm sittin next to my heat (my heat). Fuck peace, as I listen to the beat. We came to rock your body, ding ding dong. We came to rock your body, all night long. We came to rock your body, ding ding dong. We came to rock your body, all night long. Way back in the days when the hottest thang was Jherri curls. When you could always spot a gangsta. by the way his hair out grew his girl's. There lived a little boy who wore khakis everyday. He never would be broke he swore, always to get paid. Up jump the boogie the bang the bang boogie. Got them same ol' gangsta ways. Up jump the boogie the bang the bang boogie. And I ain't the one to get played. [Chorus]. Who's playin games man I really hope you burn. Who's playin games when I'm gonna get my turn. Who's playin games I don't wanna be left out."
why,"[Intro/Chorus]. Why did my homie have to die, with tears in my eyes. I came to say goodbye, say goodbye. [repeat 2X]. Just passin through to let you know that I remember the times we shared. Your mother prayed for us both night and day. I guess this is what she feared. The picture in my room keeps your image sharply in my head. All in my head. I just can't let go of the memories I had; will this madness ever end?. [Chorus]. Sometimes I wonder if it's better to be free or be in jail. Incarceration at this time to me is better than heaven or hell. I often wonder if you'd still be here if you had won your bet. Won your bet. You most likely soon see me we'll all be a memory. if we don't change this mess... change it or we gone y'all. [Chorus]. Hi, passing you through to let you know. Passing you through to let you know. That I, gonna tell everyone I know. Gonna tell everyone I know. How we, used to send them to the floor. Used to send them to the floor. Have we, have we forgot to mourn. Ohh, how long, how long, how long will they mourn. Ohh, how long, how long, how long will they mourn."

your woman has just been sighted (ring the alarm),"Your Woman Has Just Been Sighted (Ring The Alarm). . (feat. Jermaine Dupri). [Jermaine Dupri]. Cmon. Dance with me baby girl [x2]. Cmon. Dance with me baby girl [x2]. [Verse 1: Nate Dogg]. Man I was dancing, prancing, laughing, bouncing, swinging. Moving, grooving, cause the music's booming. Macking, tryna get some action, packing, acting. Manish, drinking, tweaking, winking, peeping. Seeking a freak for the evening, really feeling way too horny. Reaking from the weed I'm token, choking, smoking, real doping, hoping. My nights wide open, knowing that my girls at home. Snoring, boring, ignoring, warning that my girl was coming. Sudden mood interuption, busted my girls in the club. [Chorus]. Ring the alarm (oh oh). Your woman has just been sighted (uh). Ring the alarm. How'd she get in if she wasn't invited? (I dunno). Ring the alarm. She's headed this way like lighting (yeah). Ring the alarm. I'm not tryna be ducking and diving (cmon). Ring the alarm. [Verse 2: Nate Dogg]. Headed, top speed for the exit. Damnit don piece can't grab it. Habbit like chassing my cabbage. Magic, time to disappear fast with. This chick, who I slept last week with. Real trick, I like her cause she real slick. Let's dip, I don't care who you came with. No lip, got no time for some bullshit. She went, that she all in the backpen. Time spent, now it's time to hit the pavement. Two sense, got no time for your comments. don't trip, do you know where my girl went?. [Chorus]. [Verse 3: Jermaine Dupri]. Listen, I'm in the club, no where I ain't even suppose to be. Drinking with a girl all close to me. I'm all up in the air, telling her some superfly shit she need to hear. Thinking can't nobody see us cause we in the rear. All I'm tryna do is get a number then I'm up out of here. Cause my girl ain't home, she out with a friend. Ita be just my luck this the spot they in. Not the place for her to spot me in. You know specially when I'm suppose to be at the studio. I take one step, what do I see my girl coming threw the door but she don't see. me. Now I'm ducking, now I'm dodgeing, hiding, praying to god that she don't come. find me. What was I thinking of, I should of never parked my car in front of the club. damn!. [Chorus x3]."
