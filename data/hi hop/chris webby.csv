almost there (feat. miss daja),"They say, they say this life is gonna chew you up. And spit you right back out. But this games all I know about and. I know it aint fair but im almost there, I know im almost there,. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Im feeling stuck really what the fuck, I kill it with the lyrics. While I struggle for a buck. Im frustrated, feelin like I shoulda just made it,. Making money off of shows. But cant even make a payment on a new whit. On the edge im realy bout to lose it,. But the fans keep me motivated I know I can do this. Its funny, seems like everbody focusing on the lyrical content. But im barely seeing any money. I'll leave your nose runny cause im so sick yo,. Still scrapin together quarters to get bogies down to sicko"
blunt ride cypher (interlude),"[freestyle]. It's chris webby, getting high as fuck right now. I'm hella sick, and no one knows what I'm infected with. So hi it's nice to meet you. I'm the guy your girl been texting with. Evil rap nemesis, lighting up that heady shit. That's potent as the poison in a fucking box jellyfish. In a box chevy with the soldiers in my fellowship. Legolas and aragorn cruising through connecticut. Leave behind a trail of empty bottles and jealous chicks. Throw around bread, I'm on my hansel and gretel shit. A psychopath on a path of destruction. Popping xanax til I'm seeing black. I better pass the dutch master I'm puffing. The first up the the mic but the last to the function. Stumbling drunk with a busty chick with a passion for sucking. East coast, we don't borrow your swagger for nothing. We'd rather start a battle instead of start a discussion. So pass it back to me, cousin. Shit I'm so nice I could spit this shit. Right here backwards in russian!. No sound like the one I got. They can hear it anytime I rock. Cause all I got's my balls and my word. And this baggie full of herb. And I'm coming for that #1 spot. I've always been a loose cannon. They say I rolled off of a pirate ship. High as shit, bobby costas, look how red my eyes'll get. I'm out in sochi, 720 to a flying split. And land all up in that vagina bitch, huh. See I be showing them what I can do with this shit. Yo what you think I was new to this shit?. Got a beautiful chick in the passenger seat. Giving head to me while I maneuver the whip. Vroom, rhyme book staying fucking full. Chemically imbalanced, and fully fucking disfunctional"
brim low,"[Verse 1]. Pulling my fitted right down to my eyes. like a fucking disguise. Thought that I wanted it so I just shot for the sky. Now I don't even know why. Gave it a try, wanted a piece of the pie. Now it's a fucking surprise. The way that I'm living is different. I'm hitting and missing, and I'm just here trying to vibe. Oh my god, all this shit done changed, people be noticing me. Now they all love me, or hate me. Like there ain't no in between. I'm doing me, and that's all I know. Out on the road doing these shows. To give you the fans a little piece of my soul. But you must know I'm just like you. When I ain't got no mic. So if you see me out in public show me respect and we aight. And yes you can have an autograph. But if I'm with a girl or my family and friends. I don't get that much so please don't ask. Pick and choose, you respect me as a person, I'll reciprocate. Tip my hat and give you dap and I will just be on my way. If you see me while I'm out and got my hat down to my eyes. Brim low, that is like my “please do not disturb” sign. [Hook]. I'm just tryna live my life like I'm supposed to be. While I'm following the path that has chosen me. Now it's everywhere I go people notice me. Feet planted with my head up high. But I'ma keep my brim low, and I don't see no haters. My eyes red, cause I'm always medicated. Now they say I made it, cause I'm elevated. But my feet planted and my head up high. But I'ma keep my brim low. I'ma keep my brim low, I'ma keep my brim low. I'ma keep my brim low with my head up high. And I'ma keep my brim low. [Verse 2]. Always be keeping my hat to my brow. And my head in the clouds. Shit has been stressing me so I been rolling this loud. Trying to block it all out. But I know right now that this here's my shot. Shit or get off of the pot. Shoot for the top, ain't no looking back. This is all I got, so I will not stop. But I sacrifice my private life. That's the shit that drives a person nuts. But I won't lose sight of that feeling I got way back when. When I started to write. Hit Radio Shack with my dad. Bought me a mic, best day of my life. Ever since then I just make this music. Put it out for them to hate. But I'm Superman, my skin too thick to be penetrated. So many people always been telling me. That I never would make it. But I'm an artist. How many times must I demonstrate it?. Now it's my time to take it, I made my choices. But now so many people in my ear I'm hearing voices. So if you see me while I'm out. And got my hat down to my eyes. Brim low, that is like my “please do not disturb” sign. [Hook]"
chemically imbalanced,"[Verse 1]. I'm on the edge, one step and I'll be over. Unless I take those 12 steps, aimed at gettin sober. That's the shit I told myself I'll handle when I'm older. And now I'm older and still got this devil on my shoulder. Bottle up my problems, like prescriptions I'm poppin. All the liquor that I find myself drinkin so often. Now these cards are dealt, told myself I don't need help. Numb myself to everything, and keep on runnin from myself. [Hook]. Let's drink away the pain. Let's make another toast. Let's smoke another blunt. Until it's just a roach. And pop another pill. And drop another dose. I haven't lost it yet. But now I'm coming close. I'm just chemically imbalanced (On that shit). I'm just chemically imbalanced (Lost my grip). I'm just chemically imbalanced (One way trip). And now it's too late for turnin back (x5). [Verse 2]. Left here to battle this addictive personality. That's got me living in this alternate reality. Losing touch before this [?] so gradually. Cause at this point I need these chemicals to balance me. It's like I'm following a blueprint that the devil made. Since I first took my Ritalin in the 7th grade. The doctor gave me 16 milligrams, just a kid. Barely weighed a buck, it's like they used me as their guinea pig. Crazy teen, medicated Add. Doctor said take only 1, but you know I was taking 3. Blazin tree and skippin class, getting drunk and missin math. Bangin chicks without a rubber, crushin pills up on the desk. Chemically imbalanced in this motherfucker, startin shit. Still I was a smart kid, got myself a scholarship. Private schools with it, button-downs with the dockers. And the Jansport full of weed stuffed into my locker. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. See I'm just wreckin out weekly, livin on repeat. Still in highschool but the teachers could never reach me. Always was the fuck up with a chip on my shoulder. And a pocket full of anything to keep me from sober. See I was livin like there's no tomorrow. Chewin on a xany bar, rollin up the window smokin blunts up in family car. Bottles to the head, got the tension on the reg. Never listenin to what my parents said. I was always rollin with an ounce or two. Everytime I'm bouncin through. Flippin everybody off like Shady taught me how to do. Always thinkin that the more we burnin, the merrier. Just a kid from middle-class suburban America. And so many others like me, listen to me nightly. Happy that somebody else is feelin' what they might be. So Christian pop a pill, oh yeah I bet you will. Cause if that shit don't make your problems any less forreal. [Hook]"
conan,"Sufferin succotash this motherfucker's back. Running tracks like I'm Usain Bolt on Adderall,. doing a hundred laps. Got the world in my hands, and I'm shoulder shrugging that. Doing sets of ten until I'm as big as a fucking lumberjack. See I'm dope, but they always seem to forget this shit. So quick to judge the white kid from Connecticut. No embellishment, they saying Webby's hella sick. And I don't need a fucking magazine to tell me this. I keep it fresh, man, shout out to Funk Flex. The whole game hears me stomping up the front steps. I'm up next, not giving a fuck less. You see me losing the day I pass a drug test. Ain't happening, leaving their brains rattling. President status in the burbs, James Madison. I'm every Head of State. Written in the legislate. Ticking time bomb in the game, ready to detonate. [Hook: Chris Webby]. Get it crackin' when I come around. Ridin' 'til the sun goes down. All I know is where I've been. I don't know where I'm goin'. Standin' on the front lines like a soldier. Never backing down to no man. Call me Conan. And I'm in it 'til they tell me it's over. [Verse Two: Chris Webby]. Hip-hop is a chessboard, and I've been learning the game. Stayin' patient, independent, got no worries of fame. I'm just stacking up my paper, counting checks in my name. So much internet money, I make my iCloud rain. I'm a beast, what the fuck is you?. Steady droppin' number two. Shittin' on my compettition everytime I'm comin' through. Put your crew on blast. Up on stage got the crowd bouncing like a Kangaroo on crack. See I say it how it is. Boba Fett, come and try it kid. Mercenary, murder instrumentals for the highest bid. Pop the ray gun, well done, grab your A1. Keep the shades on. Bitches call me Johnny Cage, son. Bicycle kicking you off of the fucking mountain top. With an ounce of pot, and this album that I'm about to drop. 2013, this shit is a rap. Funk Flex and C-Dub, nothin' realer than that. [Hook: Chris Webby]. Get it crackin' when I come around. Ridin' 'til the sun goes down. All I know is where I've been. I don't know where I'm goin'. Standin' on the front lines like a soldier. Never backing down to no man. Call me Conan. And I'm in it 'til they tell me it's over"
take me home (feat. slaine),"[Verse 1: Chris Webby]. I'm a walking bad habit, E tabs up in the cabinet. Savage rap status: vocabulary extravagant. A rock star poppin' rotches in bars. Used to flip bud now just rappin' cop me a car. No tellin', Connecticut felon, I Gps 'em. And find my mark like Magellan with more lines than. Corey Feldman. I never cease to impress 'em. I cardiac arrest 'em. With every studio session I'm killin' 'em, no question. Webb's back, better hold your breath when I'm rhyming homes. I murder beats, I'm Jonah Hex on the microphone. Fiends saying I'm the dopest yet. And haters? I shrug 'em off until my f*cking shoulders sweat. I'm breaking bones, a modern version of Casey Jones. Scored a hand, I'm the winner playing the Game of Thrones. F*ck beef, my rapping style's filet mignon. Gettin' drunk, f*ck yo' driver, somebody take me home. [Hook: (Some girl) & Slaine]. (Take me home). Take me home now b*tch. (Take me home). Watch for the cops, hit the blinker when you switch. (Take me home). Lanes 'cause you know that I'm famous and I'm rich. (Take me home). Eyes on the road, take me home now b*tch. (Take me home). Take me home now b*tch. (Take me home). Watch for the cops, hit the blinker when you switch. (Take me home). Lanes 'cause you know that I'm famous and I'm rich. (Take me home). Eyes on the road, take me home now b*tch. [Verse 2: Slaine]. I know that I should change, but I don't really think I can. It's just part of my nature ? I never cracked, I never ran. The world was falling on me when my back was in a jam. I always kept on fighting, that's exactly who I am. And this is who I am, no way that I can change it. I'm buckwild, stupid, and dangerous. My best friends are not strangers. These are the motherf*ckers I hang with. We speak the same language. And I ain't saying French, English, or Spanish, or Spanglish. I mean pain and anguish,. this cocaine slangin' bang-bang sh*t. Mac-11s that we aim with. In other words, I'm rolling with the same clique I came with. I'm the sameness and f*ck being famous. Fame dreams are for groupies. I'm a real-life gangster that you ain't seen in the movies. What I mean is I'm truly off the hook. Like a phone in a nursing home, homie I'm that Boston crook. [Hook: (Some girl) & Slaine]. (Take me home). Take me home now b*tch. (Take me home). Watch for the cops, hit the blinker when you switch. (Take me home). Lanes 'cause you know that I'm famous and I'm rich. (Take me home). Eyes on the road, take me home now b*tch. (Take me home). Take me home now b*tch. (Take me home). Watch for the cops, hit the blinker when you switch. (Take me home). Lanes 'cause you know that I'm famous and I'm rich. (Take me home). Eyes on the road, take me home now b*tch. [Verse 3: Chris Webby]. I damage tracks, so listeners always ran it back. Always with a half-ounce stuffed into a sandwich bag. I kill it quickly and always keeping the realest with me. Stealing all the f*cking insulin from Wilford Brimley. ""Diabetes,"" rappers could never beat us. I been spittin' sh*t like this since I was just a f*ckin' fetus. Keep your chick with me as long as she give dome. Rollin' up the Diesel, I'm burning like Jim Rome. B*tch!. [Verse 4: Slaine]. Yeah, standin' here's a man with the past, the inspiration. For the kids on the corner,. but still got the laugh of a mental patient. The infiltration of the game. Born from a central hatred of fame. A pencil shaking with pain. An injured stake in the claim from the wrath I became. My paragaph's insane,. are futuristic pictures of the past from which I came. And this is Slaine with a shotty in the hooptie son. My whole career's a robbery. that they could never scoop me from. [Hook: (Some girl) & Slaine]. (Take me home). Take me home now b*tch. (Take me home). Watch for the cops, hit the blinker when you switch. (Take me home). Lanes 'cause you know that I'm famous and I'm rich. (Take me home). Eyes on the road, take me home now b*tch. (Take me home). Take me home now b*tch. (Take me home). Watch for the cops, hit the blinker when you switch. (Take me home). Lanes 'cause you know that I'm famous and I'm rich. (Take me home). Eyes on the road, take me home now b*tch"
there goes the neighborhood (feat. a. mitch),"[Verse 1]. Yeah, see I've been grinding for a long time man. But I'm here now, there goes the neighborhood I guess, huh. You see I'm here to save the day with this music. Grinding to the point I think I'm really gonna loose it. But I won't lose nothing,. They trying to step to me but sh*t. you think you could do better with it homie. Then go and do something, ah. They trying to tell me I'm crazy, but sh*t I'm crazy good. Step into your city, they sayin' there goes the neighborhood. The sale signs go up as soon as I show up. They building bomb shelters cause they know. I'm gonna blow up, ah. . Bright future, they say I'm a ticking time bomb. Until I'm up on Mtv, waving saying hi mom. Grab your video cameras and get your night calms. Making history from the second they flip the lights on. I made it off being business savy and street smart. Who needs a co sign, I let the beats talk. I don't need another rapper lending help. Telling listen to some dope cuz sh*t, I tell him that myself. I'm just playing what I'm dealt, sh*t it's been a long road. But I got a lot under my belt and I felt. At times it was a lost cause. But I always got back upon my paws dog. So I know I'm gonna make it in the long haul. Sh*t it's now or never homie, I cannot stall. So I'm gonna reach out for the stars and I pray for the best. And that's how it's gonna be until the day of my death, word. [Hook]. Just play in, tune in to this music. Have no fear, I save the day with this music. My city on my back, and I'ma take it wherever I go. Wherever I go, wherever I go, wherever I go. Say hello to the new guy in town. There goes the neighborhood, it's what they say. [Verse 2]. This is 12 years in the making, far from immediate. But now it's time to sink my teeth in it,. I'm on my beastly sh*t, cause I'm sick as f*ck. You don't believe me b*tch,. then go ahead and spit that semen on a petri dish. You need sterilizer just to give me dap. Unless you want your immune system attacked, real rap. I'm not doing no duggy, these. f*cking idiots should drop the swag and take notes. Cause they can learn something from me. This is all I do man murder instrumentals. With this fire off the top like sweet tooth in twisted metal. I'm spitting rebel with a cause, deadly with the bars. Underdog since day one, wasn't expecting your applause. I respect your damn opinion, if you don't like my music. But if you don't respect my hustle,. then you ain't paying attention. I pay so many f*cking dudes my wallet's empty. Ain't a person here stopping Webby, motherf*cker. [Hook]. Just play in, tune in to this music. Have no fear, I save the day with this music. My city on my back, and I'ma take it wherever I go. Wherever I go, wherever I go, wherever I go. Say hello to the new guy in town. There goes the neighborhood, it's what they say.. [Verse 3]. F*cking animal, Webby's the Serengeti type. They whipping Lambos, but I made it on a pedal bike. Not even Gatorade replenishes electrolytes. I burn, going nuts from the f*cking second I get the mic. I'm the grittiest grimiest and the wittiest, yeah. Jack the ripper to the beats I'm getting busy with, yeah. And half these rapper idiots ain't even literate. I'm battle tested and ready, Webby a young Odysseus. Fire in my eyes and I hunger for success. I'm hunting for the title, while they hunting for a check, yeah. Wondering what is next, but I'm going in fists swinging. Till your ears ringing, they don't expect what this kids bringing. Though if you didn't notice, so homie just don't provoke it. I got my state on my shoulders, till I'm getting scoliosis. Never gonna stop, my life is like the script of vertical limit. Motherf*cker I'm getting to the top. [Hook]. Just play in, tune in to this music. Have no fear, I save the day with this music. My city on my back, and I'ma take it wherever I go. Wherever I go, wherever I go, wherever I go. Say hello to the new guy in town. There goes the neighborhood, it's what they say."
until i die (feat. zavaro),"I started in the game on the grind and I still am. All of it off the sweat on my back without a deal man. Spit it real, and treat em like protected areas in Alaska. Cause they about to know the drill man. So f*ckin' illy that I got to pop a pill again Adderall,. X all 20 or 30 milligrams. Gotta stay focused in the land of opportunity. Prepared for any twist and turn that anybody threw at me. Grew to be a beast learned it all up in the cypher. All off the top slaughtered 90% of you writers. Regardless of my f*ckin' heritage and nationality. I grew up decapitating anybody who battled me. Rapping rapidly ain't nobody be lapping me. Jackie joiner curses 26 paces in back of me. An alcoholic but f*ck it homie I'd rather be. Liquored up not giving a f*ck and living lavishly. On the go hard diet I burn calories. Setting fire to mics til the melted plastic and ash you see. I've lost my marbles somebody should straight jacket me. Latch it and throw the key in the deepest part of the blackest sea. Toss me on an island like f*ckin' Survivor casted me. And still I'll make it back and make every hater a casualty. Running Connecticut shouts to my homie Apathy. And shouts to everyone who supported me on my path to be. Successful in one way or an other cus grammatically. They know no one could f*ck with my metaphorical masterpiece. Got the f*ckin' Grim Reaper coming after me. The good die young someone show me where the casket be. I keep on moving forward. With my head held high. I do this sh*t forever or at least until I die. Ain't no use in stopping. I got nothing left to hide. I do this sh*t forever. You couldn't stop me if you tried. Nobody f*ckin' with my flow man. Modern day Comanche swords swinging in both hands. Hip hop is all I know man dank. B*tches to Chronic 2001 motherf*ckin' Slow Jam. Keep grinding til the day that Webby holds the belt. Make my haters sit the f*ck down Franky Roosevelt. With that polio flow homie I'm dope as hell. Captain of my movement and I'm treating all of my soldiers well. My fans know I won't give rhyming a rest. And I mean that, from the left side of my chest. I got heart, so all you motherf*ckers step your game up. Me with a microphone is like Bob Ross with a paint brush. All you lame f*cks getting pummeled from the waist up. I don't need a cheap shot to leave your raps laid up. Shane Mosley with punches f*ckin' your face up. Eating at roofs Chris now let me raise the stakes up. I keep on moving forward. With my head held high. I do this sh*t forever or at least until I die. Ain't no use in stopping. I got nothing left to hide. I do this sh*t forever. You couldn't stop me if you tried. I keep on moving forward. With my head held high. I do this sh*t forever or at least until I die. Ain't no use in stopping. I got nothing left to hide. I do this sh*t forever. You couldn't stop me if you tried"

what i do,"Straight chuggin' on the 40 ounce, brain cells fry. Like a clamb strip all day get high. Never ending story felt course stay fly. My mom's a math teacher so I gotta multiply. Not a mathematician myself so I ride. At my 98 Altima parked outside. Hustle and mixtapes I'm tryna get by. Double U E double B follow with a Y. Mothaf*cka that's me and I be so cool. To be on my level you gonna need a step-stool. Always been a troublemaker gotta break rules. Breaking every law till they kick me out of school. So amped up you'd think I'm chuggin' jet fuel. Chasing a bottle of moon shine with an O'Doules. No more rules let me call up Billy Madison. And have em slippin' on banana peels if they challenge him. I'm bafflin' any competitor with what I'm rappin' and. The future's lookin' bright I think I'm staring at a halogen. Born in '88 I got it tatted on my abdomen. Product of the 90s, everyday practicin'. Then it started happenin', turned into a beast. Full bred pit with a little Maltise. Woof, slaughter any track I see. You've now been warned, you'd better hide your beats. [Hook]. I'ma never give a f*ck about you. I'm just doing what I do. Murder any beat I put my mind too. Thought you knew that's what I do. Rappin' on the mike till my face turns blue. Through and through that's what I do. That's what I do. Stop sleeping over there man pass the blunt. L ride around town and be back for lunch. Got a full plate of beats and some Captain Crunch. Me on the mike only lost a battle once. Everybody else, murked em. Cooked it up, served em. Pen in hand I got the dexterity of a surgeon. Freestyles burn em, written rhymes flawless. Like the names of every Mutant Ninja Turtle, I'm an artist. B*tch, nobody stoppin' what I'm sayin'. Lyrical display gon' shock em like Raiden. Everyday ragin', show me where the party's at. Where the b*tches where the broads where the hotties at?. Where the liquor where the bud, where the Marley at?. Where the stage I'm bouta give the crowd a heart attack. Life's short so you know I gotta live it up. Brim low dutch rolled I'ma never give a f*ck. [Hook]. All I got's my word and my balls just a nerve with a cause. Livin' life like a video game so press pause. Double tap X with a shot to the brain. Back back square hit em with the scorpion chain. So get over here b*tch ill kick em like Liu Kang. And fatality anybody who sh*ts on my name. Its that tatted up tyrant, heatin' up the climate. Pissing on these haters like puppies on fire hydrants. It's that motherf*ckin' Optimus Rhyme full bottle of pills. Blunted with a bottle of wine. Fully transform bout to take over the game soon. Ain't no mothaf*cka I'm afraid to bring the flame to. Got em rotisserie while I be smokin' piffery. Making words connect like letters written in calligraphy. Not a person here stepping in my shoes. 'Cause see Webby's back and this is what I do. [Hook]"
