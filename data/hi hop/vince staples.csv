like it is,"I tell it like it is, then how it could be. Heaven or hell boy, freedom or jail boy. A Jansport bag full of shit I could sell for. The higher, the low boy, just me and my homeboys. The police kill us so we made up our own laws. Been fighting this long war. there's shells in this shores sand. Still young but a grown man, could tell by my stash. Been stackin' money and problems. as I wait for the rapture. Death never been no threat, I be chillin', relaxin'. Everybody bleed. I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one. To make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done. I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one. To make my momma proud, feel like her only son. I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one. With everything I need, with everything I want. I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one. To do it like nobody has ever done. When I was in seventh grade. my grandfather told me don't get caught. Lovin' the streets cause they never gonna love you back. But I feel like it's all we got so it's all we really do love. At the end of the day I feel like the problem. is the people that control. It don't really come from here. so they can't do nothing but look down on us. We look at them, we see somebody. that could help but they look at us. and all they see is a nigga. It don't really matter anyway. we all gon' die one day man, one day. Do doves cry when the black man dies. or do we croak with crows. The young catch gun shots. the old catch the holy ghost. Ho I love not, I never seen no pot of gold. Just ball windows and six fours with no switches. Was broke with no bitches, she love me though. You'll kill me if it make you richer. what you screaming, you my brother for. Heart is where the hatred is, the brain. that stained the love below. And life is what you make it. so I'm makin' money for my folks. I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one. To make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done. I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one. To make my momma proud, feel like her only son. I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one. With everything I need, with everything I want. I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one. To do it like nobody has ever done. When most people look at a person who does what I. Do they look at us with these preconceived notions as if. It's a set way for us all to be. but we all people at the end. Of the day so I wonder why. we don't treat each other like it. You're looking at a person telling them. that they story don't. Matter when they're no better than me. walkin' down the streets tryna shoot at somebody. 'Cause all we got is these dreams man. and y'all ain't never had to not have nothing. And that's the last thing you want from anybody. Is to not really have nothing. I been through hell and back, I seen my momma cry. Seen my father hit the crack. then hit the set to flip a sack. I done seen my homies die then went on rides. to kill 'em back. So how you say you feel me. when you never had to get through that?. We live for they amusement. like they view us from behind the glass. No matter what we grow into. we never gonna escape our past. So in this cage they made for me. exactly where you find me at. Whether it's my time to leave or not. I never turn my back. I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one. To make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done. I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one. To make my momma proud, feel like her only son. I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one. With everything I need, with everything I want. I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one. To do it like nobody has ever done"
