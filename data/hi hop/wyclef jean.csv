High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym (Just to get a peek again, shes a 10). High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym. (Just to get a peek again, shes a 10). Never thought she would come and work for the president. Mr. George Washington (where my money at?). She thought he'd call (where my money at?). She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day. All you wanna know is (where my money at?). Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread. All you wanna know is (where my money at?). She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard. All you wanna know is (where my money at?). She thought he'd call (where my money at?). [Chorus: (Akon) ] (x2). Cos I'ma tell you like Wu told me. Cash rules everything around me. Singin dollar dollar bill y all (dollar, dollar bill y all). Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all(dollar, dollar bill y all). [Verse 2: (Akon)]. Pimpin got harder cos hoes got smarter. On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of. Rather be up in the club shakin for a thug. For triple times the money and spending it like they wanna. They got they mind on they money, money on they mind. They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines. See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind. And ain't nobody takin from us, and that's the bottom line. But I know, there's a drop in the block. You move slow, you getting pressure from cops. You don't know, not to lay low. Because 25 to life's no joke. To all my real gorillas thuggin. On top of corners every day strugglin. All the beautiful women gettin money. Washin' them dollar bills like laundry. [Chorus: (Akon) ] (x2). Cos I'ma tell you like Wu told me. Cash rules everything around me. Singin dollar dollar bill y all (dollar, dollar bill y all). Singin dollar dollar bill y all(dollar, dollar bill y all). [Bridge: (Wyclef Jean)]. Money, money-money-money. Money, money-money-money. It drives the world crazy. [Verse 3: (Lil Wayne)]. (Weezy) She used to be (she used to be the sweetest girl). She used to be the sweetest girl ever. Now she like sour and Mcgregor. She wears a dress to the T like the letter. And if you make it rain she will be under the weather. She used to run track back in high school. Now she tricks off the track right by school. She takes a loss cos she don't wanna see her child lose. So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used. And then she runs to the pastor. And he tells her there will be a new chapter. But she feels no different after. And then she asks him (where my money at?). [Chorus: (Akon) ] (x2). Cos I'ma tell you like Wu told me. Cash rules everything around me. Singin dollar dollar bill y all (dollar, dollar bill all). Singin dollar dollar bill y all(dollar, dollar bill y all). [Outro: (Wyclef Jean)]. Some live for the bill. Some kill for the bill (where my money at?). She wined for the bill. Grind for the bill (where my money at?). Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay the bill (where my money at?). Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy and Nia"

Verse One. I caught the bullet, I was stumblin like a mulet. Drink white Russian; game, Russian roulette. Flight Continental six o'clock in the mornin. Briefcase full o' cocaine on my way out, I tipped the doorman. Jumped into the cab said, ""Hail Mary, full of Grace"". Yesterday communion was the Mafia's reunion. Confessed to the priest, evade the apple, I ate the peach. Slept with Vanity, sold my soul to Robin Leach. Devil music in my ear, no fear, I'm pumpin Def Leppard. Slow down, here comes the narc' with the German shepherd. I got the plan, man, meet me in the van. I got this kid from the Sudan bringin tecs from Iran (uh-huh). Chorus. What do you mean, John 3 16?. For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16. Says the boy to the fiend (All around the world). (uh-huh) What do you mean? What do you mean?. What do you mean, John 3 16?.

Yo with the gun to his head; yo he was already dead. Sunday mornin in court, the judge got Wyclef confessin. ""Yo, I murdered Steve Austin,"" now I'm wanted by Bionic Woman. Women bring you more miseries like that movie. Stress go to India, smoke hashish with Ghandi (uh-huh). My bills of rights is to make sure you're alright. Superman left the gang, cause his weakness was Crips-tonight (bing). Godfather got the cottonballs to his cheeks. Pig couldn't fly straight so you die in your sleep. I stay awake only to see Nicodemus. The young one got murdered, the day was the Sabbath. Chorus. What do you mean, John 3 16?. For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16. What do you mean, says the boy to the fiend. Why we killin for the green?. What do you mean, John 3 16?. For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16. Says the girl to the fiend (All around the world). I wanna wake up from this dream. Verse Three. I know this drug dealer, who drive a black beamer. Dreadlock cut off once by this girl named Delilah. Pretty little dancer, voice like Tina Turner. Chickenheads are you a virgin? Yeah right, so was Madonna!. S-s-sinner, sinner, seek the master. If not, feel the explosion from the day after. Bit by the vampire, worked for the mobster. Two to the head - and now you swimmin with the lobsters. We got'cha got'cha, set up in Oklahoma. You caught a bad one like a kid catchin pneumonia. So storyteller, what's the moral of this story?. Live reality and don't get caught up in your fantasy. Chorus. What do you mean, John 3 16?. For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16. Says the boy to the fiend (All around the world). Aren't we all human beings? (uh-huh). What do you mean, John 3 16?. For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16 (M-16). But the dream.. is still for green... (so) so we die in the steam. Wyclef Jean. (What do you mean, John 3 16?). This is how it is around the way, y'knahmsayin Muggs?. Wyclef.. and it don't stop.

pj's,"Mmmmmmmmm... yeah. [Wyclef]. (PJ's!) I was born in the PJ's. So I gotta rep for the PJ's. The elevators with the pissy hallways. Bangin on the project walls, all day. [Verse 1]. Yo if it wasn't for the PJ's y'all probably never heard of me. Y'all be like, ""Who the hell is Wyclef, and what's a Fugee?"". I'd probably be standin on a corner - watch you approach. Steal ya dope, sell ya coke, then snatch ya rope. Run for brokes with the cash and the jewels. Bows-eye, I hold my breath when I shoot. The reason you should hold ya breath; cuz most thugs. when they breathe and shoot tecs, they aim right but shoot left. Now they flesh being swept off the surface. If you ain't B.I.G. then Notorious. So why ya man reckless, side-ballin like he holdin heat. Someone bring him a bed, for the permanent sleep. Weight beneath Jacob's Latter and the Aftermath. Don't matter if you use a desert eagle as your armor. Blood splatter, glass shatter through the project slums. Another one in the obituary column son. [Chorus]. (PJ's!) I was born in the PJ's. So I gotta rep for the PJ's. The elevators with the pissy hallways. Bangin on the project walls, all day. (PJ's) I gotta make noise for the PJ's. Wrote my first rhyme in the PJ's. You can hear it in my speech, I'm from the PJ's. The PJ's! PJ's. [Verse 2]. Before I was signed, I used to move on the block. All I wanted to do was rhyme, rhyme, rhyme. Line for line, I make the blind man walk in a straight line. to prison - and take a message to Shyne. Peace God from the PJ's to Ground Zero. It's a ""Hardknock Life"" but ""The Sun'll Come Out Tomorrow"". Walk with a shadow through ghettos, playin in every borough. You would think rap was rock they way I carry heavy metal. It such a shame, cocaine in ya veins, screamin. ""Team Spirit"" grippin the shottie like Kurt Cobaine. In the projects God, nuttin come easy. Gotta deal with the grimy, greasy, the sleasy. Move like a professional, young thug funeral. Wattchu thought this was another Pepsi commercial?. Nah it's the art of war, when you least expected it. Wyclef the president, the PJ's elected him. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. Yeah, and to the teachers that said I wouldn't live. and my remains would be found under the Verizano Bridge. Well I'm alive teach! So put ya theory to rest. I ain't Makaveli but I might fake my death. Make no mistake, I'm a hip-hop artist. Before the diamond in the Billboard, the hood charted it. Surburbia bought it, we bootlegged it, we couldn't afford it. Cuz in the PJ's we undergroudn like black markets. The 'P' stand for public housing. The 'R's for respect that ya get, when ya hold down ya set. The 'O's for ounces that we flip into ki's. The 'J's for the judgement handed by the ju-ry. The 'E' is for enter, at your own risk. You know the 'C' - that's for the cats that's out to get rich. And the 'T'... trust no one. And the 'S' is for the snitchers - you know the outcome.... [Chorus]"

something about mary,"Yo, I'm a dedicate this to everybody that was at Woodstock '99. DMX, Limp Bizkit, Sheryl Crow amongst many. Yo, just before I got on stage this chick came on to me. She offered me sumthin. It looked kinda strange, it was in a bag. I said ""Yo, girl let me talk to you real quick"". Yo. I don't sniff cocaine 'cause it melts my brain. For sexual stimulation I neved did no ecstacy. I don't pop pills, I neved did no LSD. but I wouldn't mind a kiss from Ms. Mary. 'Cause. She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard. She's homegrown and you can get a kiss in her backyard. I remember when I was a young boy. I waited for my grandad, ""So daddy can I get a puff?"". He looked at me, he says ""Son, man, you're too young kid"". ""When you get older now and you understand that"". ""I let you get one kiss from Ms. Mary"". 'Cause. She's homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard. She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard. If she allows you to you can hold her-a. She's homegrown and you can kiss her in her backyard. She's homegrown - I like to be with you Ms. Mary - in your backyard. That's when she looked at me and she said. ""Wyclef this' what I want you to do son"". Come on. Inhale - exhale. Exhale - inhale. Inhale - exhale. Now hold it now. Inhale - exhale. Inhale - exhale. Exhale - inhale. Now breath in my face. Marijuan' Marijuan'. She said that. She's homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard. She's homegrown, she said ""'Clef, I'll kiss you in my backyard"". And my daddy don't need to know. She said that. I'm homegrown and you can grown me in your backyard. I'm homegrown and you don't need to worry for my backyard. That's when it sounded we get in trouble, ""I gotta go girl"". This' what she said. Laa la-laa laa laa, strictly la-la, to take me higher, and higher (2X). Laa la-laa laa laa, strictly la-la, to take me higher. I'm about to take it higher (4X - in the background). Come on y'all, come on y'all, come on. Yo, I want for everybody sleeping on my guitar skills. It's about to beat on right about now. Turn my guitar up yo!. What up Jimi Hendrix, I'll see you baby. Yo, Carlos Santana, thanks for the lessons baby. Yo, Steve Rod, I ain't forgettin you man. To the godfather B.B. King. and to my man Eric Clapton. I think I'm forgettin somebody, man. The ?????, ha-haaaaa. Yo, Jerry Wonder, man,. you're playin that bass like Bootsie Collins, man. Don't hurt 'em baby boy?"

[Verse One: Wyclef]. Let me talk to my daughter. Daughter this is your poppa. I know it's been a while. We haven't talked. [Mary J. Blige]. But daddy you've been gone. And me and mom have been all alone. It's been a struggle and you weren't there for us. He say. [Wyclef Jean]. Okay, when I called you. She wouldn't put you on the phone. She call the police, restrainin order. 50 feet, from my home. I tried, I ain't lyin. It's so sad that the heavens cryin, AYY~!. Once a boy and twice a man. I'm just tryin to do the best I can. Give me a chance girl. [Chorus: Wyclef]. A grown man ain't supposed to cry. So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice. Everything gon' be alright. Baby girl I'm by your side, dry your eyes. [Verse Two: Mary J. Blige]. Let's talk this over. Now see I heard everything that you told her. But it's gon' take more than words. for you to be a father, uh-huh. Responsibilities of a man. Like stayin faithful just for the fam'. What if she knew that you chose. another over her mother, aowwww!. So you called her. and I wouldn't put her on the phone. I called the police yes, restrainin order. 50 feet, from my home. I tried, I ain't lyin. It's so sad that the heavens are cryin, yeahhh. Once a girl, twice of a man. And I'ma try to do the best I can. I can't give you a chance noooo. [Chorus: Blige]. A woman ain't supposed to cry. So why don't you just wipe your eyes, dry your eyes. You've learned a house is not a home. When you're living all alone, and you want back home. [Verse Three: Wyclef]. WAIT A MINUTE GIRL! You're my joy, happiness that you bring. Turn the fall back to spring girl, you're my bling. You a hip-hop song I heard for the first time time. Studied all the words to the rhyme. You're my life, without you there's no sun, there's no moon. There's no stars, shinin in the ni-iight. [Mary J. Blige]. But if I give you a chance, would you show me you care. Be a man, no matter what the circumstances. AHOW~!. [Chorus: Wyclef]. A grown man ain't supposed to cry. So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice. [Blige]. You've learned a house is not a home. When you're living all alone, and you want back home. [Chorus: Wyclef]. A grown man ain't supposed to cry. So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice. (What about the baby~! What about the baby~!). Everything gon' be alright. Baby girl I'm by your side, I apologize!. I cry, and I cry, I cry. {*fades out*}"

apocalypse,"[Intro:]. Yeah, I was looking out my window. when I heard this sound. look up into the sky. saw the moon turned to blood. looked at my little brother. said, ""you high as hell maaan"". [Chorus:]. Apocalypse... 1,2 the headlines youths just rolled through. Apocalypse... 3,4 solder, 100 horsemen at your door. Apocalypse... 5,6 you wanted dead or alive, hit or miss. We we y'all, yeah, we we y'all. [Verse One:]. Arrival of the Carnival. New beats, I never recycle. While your looking for samples. You might get trampled. Surprise, hey. I'm back with lightning and thunder. I heard you over saying that I was a one year wonder. You dumb or some, I went to refugees. Silly felony, when I'm done. Collect royalty from record company's. Clouds getting darker. Suns getting nearer. I'll turn a atheist into a god fearing believer. The back of a building. Your body's found by children. Playin' hide go seek. All we found was his skeleton. In the back of a car. You spawned with the wrong guard. You know my empire strikes back hard. Listen hard, war. This is the day after action. Projects, cannons. Being launched at the palace. Vision, revelation. Sky know apocalypse. Enemy pilots kamikaze into the abyss. [Chorus:]. Apocalypse... 1,2 the headlines youths just rolled through. Apocalypse... 3,4 solder, 100 horsemen at your door. Apocalypse... 5,6 you wanted dead or alive, hit or miss. We we y'all, yeah, we we y'all, yeah, we we y'all. [Verse Two:]. Aiyyo, Back on earth. The party is in the tunnel. On the west side of the river. Went mad quiver. Rats get fed to the alligator. Gun blast equivalent to the bombs in pearl harbor. Rescue choppers broke the turn to hiroshima. I'm driving to jersey to escape the terror. I was on the highway pushing a black viper. A car pulls up, is he a jack or a sniper (sniper). A blue range rover, he says pull over. I didn't know he was a DT undercover. I screamed out my lungs. This is discrimination!. He tried, he said you just robbed a gas station. Who me? not me! it couldn't be. I was in the Grammys with Brandy. Didn't you see me on tv?. Bullshit, y'all all in the same game. He tried to run me off the road. Like he was Roscoe P. Coltrane. I stayed calm, gave him a hell of a show. Cause when its time to go. All i gotta press is turbo. Heard it on his walkie, road block on 280 west. Things got serious, that's when i bust a left. U-Turn, my eyes burned. My concern was a truck coming. Head on collision within a chase position. Close one, i almost went up in a blaze. Running from what appears to be a masquerade. Least that what i thought, it was all in my mind. Reality stuck when i got to the borderline. The headline reads every ghettos sad story. A rookie shoots a boy over mistaken identity.... (crash). [Chorus repeat (2X)]"

QU New York, you try to criticize me I criticize you. been the same muthafucka since in high school. any beat I shed light to with crazy wattage. Blankin' out bought my first eight ball for eighty dollars. learned who not to trust grew obnoxious. so niggas start to hate me same time the boys in blue watch us. circlin' but they don't slow down take you to court. think you seein' Judge Joe Brown they just actin'. Indy's throwin' Tyson back in another year. fuckin' with a nigga's career I cock back at bust in the air. give me space beats with plenty bass drink my Hennessey straight. 'til I hurl out third world clout I'll take niggas hearts. and turn killers into girl scouts works of art. Picasso from the Hydro roller-slash-hustler CEO-slash-retired soldier. (For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life). [Ja Rule]. Kill or be killed behind the wall 40 day short. still the thought of murderer true to the sport. I bang with the best niggas them career criminals. now I'm in with these youngins lookin' to feel me out. Hollerin' 'bout how they gon' hit on me now. Niggas is real wild bangin' before trial. new kicks new trial I don't give a fuck.

I know that real recognize every hustle. and die with these niggas in the struggle. Ya feel me. [Reptile]. Oh God shells loaded in the semi auto quoted. unknown cat never voted picture me on the scene. huntin' for greens like Mike Meyers trick or treatin' on Halloween. mashed down in the fatigues servin' the fiends. kill or be killed metal pipes under the sleeve. in the city slicker bust checks or puff cess. ruffneck love liquor & act figures bloodsport on the streets. no gloves pullin' knives out the 'fridge handin' out cold cuts. ugh streets real thug so recognize thug close yo' eyes thug. you 'bout to die thug!. Call the President I'm blowin' up ya residence. spill acid on the corpse to clear the evidence. Protestors outside screamin' free Gotti. guard your body SWAT teams is waitin' with the shotty.

Wyclef Jerry ""Wonder"" New Millenium new millenium come on"
80 bars,"[Intro: Wyclef]. 80 bars, 80 scars. Yo, engineer turn me up, yo. [Wyclef]. I started off in the underground. From mono to stereo, now I'm surround sound. Blowing through your tubes, leaving holes through your speakers. Cracking through your tweeters, my frequency's off the meter. Jam packed arenas from here to Bangkok. I'm ahead of my time like Jimi Hendrix playing Woodstock. Me, I'm playing Hoodstock before I had the dreadlocks. I use to reminisce ""Should I do music or sell rocks?"". Wrote my own props, living in the PJ's. That's when the Angel came to you and said ""It's all a Masquerade"". Eyes with no faces, speakers with no lace. I feel that Earth's spinnin, but I'm standin in the same space. With no trace of what happened last night. I seen two fiends fighting over a crack pipe. Now I'm watching TV, my antennae was a close hanger. Blurry vision, Mister McGee Hunn, David Banner. Flip the data, the kids was wearin bandanas. Totin hammers aimin at your medulla oblongata. Blaow blaow, a young thug with a slim figure. The romantic type like the movie ""Castle Blanca"". Herbs, sell 'em once, got busted by undercover. Buyer, my supplier was a Gypsy cab driver. That's when I realize I need to find a new hustle. Living in the jungle to get taught became my muscle. I strive through snake eyes who wanted me crucified. I thought that I was drowning but I was getting baptized. Now behold, I heard you sold 20 mill'. But with no street credibility, your overkill. You ain't real, talkin bout keep it gangsta. Phony, if you knew the gangstas sent me to shank you. Gank you, gank you, tie up your ankles. And if that ain't enought, I call Henchman's to linch you. Now, at the funeral, I can see the Priest bless you. But in the after life, I'ma still touch you. Knockin on heavens door, your beggin to get in. That's when the center man greets you with the face of Satan. Now you look frightened in the belly of the whale. That's when the warden say ""I wanna welcome you to hell"". Fools, is 5 bucks, get off the phone, times up. I seen him cut from his head to his nuts. You wish you wouldn't, wish you couldn't, wish it got to me. Cause you screamin so loud that a deaf man can hear. Back to the silence, no more droppin science. Er'body rappin about diamonds and violence. And they ain't are's, all they do is charge credit cards. And when the bill comes, they blame it on the rap stars. Now how you figure? I ain't rent a car. I wasn't at the spa, I ain't by the bar. Now here's a jewel when you get your first record deal. Don't subject yourself to the mass appeal. First Class, caviar in the vel'. In the new S Class with the Jordan wheels. Remember, the music in the streets like the streets. You know the cold of the streets, er'body tryin to eat. The evidence is concrete, I'm tired of the same song. You take me how, you must be high off heroin. Sharper than I ever been, this one gon get a 10. Rappers, I'ma murder y'all with your own medicine. I move with faith, I never have doubt. I'm so hungry you will think I'm just coming out. But I been here before, from ""Blun"" to ""The Score"". To ""The Carnival"", Ecleftic World Tour. I'm causin whores, waitin in the back doors. They want me to rock they boat and shift they more short. That's when the Father said ""Take me to this lesson"". They wanna cut your hair like Deliala did Sampson. I felt that, so I went back to my format. Raps and backpack, gats for carjacks. Hats for pussycats, cause Aids, I don't want that. And for the DJ's, here's something y'all can scratch. Technique 12, Benito hits the watts. Hypnotize the crowd, the dance floor is jam packed. Now sing along like a negro spiritual. No one got shot tonight, it's a miracle. What's this I hear, y'all wanna take my spot?. You got a better chance putting a gorilla in a headlock. I'm too focused, I can see through your lens. You ain't a G, just a wanna be, Kingpin said.... ""The next time, y'all wanna pay for protection. I suggest that you hit up the Haitian Sicilians"". [Outro]. 80 bars, 80 scars. 80 bars, 80 scars. 80 bars, 80 scars. 80 bars"

Feelin like leavin with somebody who. Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade. Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade. When you know what he likes and what he might say. And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways. And, if I can go, with you. Way out the states no 2 ways and no page. No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away. So all I got to say is.

apocalypse,"[Intro:]. Yeah, I was looking out my window. when I heard this sound. look up into the sky. saw the moon turned to blood. looked at my little brother. said, ""you high as hell maaan"". [Chorus:]. Apocalypse... 1,2 the headlines youths just rolled through. Apocalypse... 3,4 solder, 100 horsemen at your door. Apocalypse... 5,6 you wanted dead or alive, hit or miss. We we y'all, yeah, we we y'all. [Verse One:]. Arrival of the Carnival. New beats, I never recycle. While your looking for samples. You might get trampled. Surprise, hey. I'm back with lightning and thunder. I heard you over saying that I was a one year wonder. You dumb or some, I went to refugees. Silly felony, when I'm done. Collect royalty from record company's. Clouds getting darker. Suns getting nearer. I'll turn a atheist into a god fearing believer. The back of a building. Your body's found by children. Playin' hide go seek. All we found was his skeleton. In the back of a car. You spawned with the wrong guard. You know my empire strikes back hard. Listen hard, war. This is the day after action. Projects, cannons. Being launched at the palace. Vision, revelation. Sky know apocalypse. Enemy pilots kamikaze into the abyss. [Chorus:]. Apocalypse... 1,2 the headlines youths just rolled through. Apocalypse... 3,4 solder, 100 horsemen at your door. Apocalypse... 5,6 you wanted dead or alive, hit or miss. We we y'all, yeah, we we y'all, yeah, we we y'all. [Verse Two:]. Aiyyo, Back on earth. The party is in the tunnel. On the west side of the river. Went mad quiver. Rats get fed to the alligator. Gun blast equivalent to the bombs in pearl harbor. Rescue choppers broke the turn to hiroshima. I'm driving to jersey to escape the terror. I was on the highway pushing a black viper. A car pulls up, is he a jack or a sniper (sniper). A blue range rover, he says pull over. I didn't know he was a DT undercover. I screamed out my lungs. This is discrimination!. He tried, he said you just robbed a gas station. Who me? not me! it couldn't be. I was in the Grammys with Brandy. Didn't you see me on tv?. Bullshit, y'all all in the same game. He tried to run me off the road. Like he was Roscoe P. Coltrane. I stayed calm, gave him a hell of a show. Cause when its time to go. All i gotta press is turbo. Heard it on his walkie, road block on 280 west. Things got serious, that's when i bust a left. U-Turn, my eyes burned. My concern was a truck coming. Head on collision within a chase position. Close one, i almost went up in a blaze. Running from what appears to be a masquerade. Least that what i thought, it was all in my mind. Reality stuck when i got to the borderline. The headline reads every ghettos sad story. A rookie shoots a boy over mistaken identity.... (crash). [Chorus repeat (2X)]"

A few good men in the new millineam. Women got a new law, if you cheat you're a dead man. so I been dead like 100 times. Ask Cyndi Lauper, she'll tell you time after time.

I use chose remix to make it quite clear. that he came in when you didn't want to be there. and I fell victim to this one night affair. by the time weeks came you was already there.

da cypha,"(feat. Supreme C, Marie Antoinette, Hope). . . [INTRO:]. Yo 1, 2, 1, 2. The Clef is back with some adjustments. Refugee camp. (Turn it up! Turn it up! Turn it up!). Yo, you see them Refugees right there, they goin in the car. [HOOK:]. WooWooWooWooWoo. Keys they goin in the trunk. WooWooWooWooWoo. Fiends they don't give a uh. [Marie Antoinette]. And Flex couldn't save you even if he dropped a bomb in this. You still gon be found in a ditch. My name should be Robin Banks the way I be robbin banks. I'm a fiend for the S-500 I want it. Used to stay high and blunted, but all that had to stop. Chick like me be chasin after cops. And they don't stop at my block after the Diallo shootin. Soldiers in waitin, marksmen recruitin. Salutin, thug confederates, rhyme and reason. Time and treatin, Air Force One we leavin. Panama red, holdin 52 hands for ransom. My man Johnny Handsome, itchin to cancel 'em. I'm like hold up, wait a minute, let's get down to buisness. We could shoot up everything soon as the deal is finished. Blah, blah, I got two hours to kill. We want like 5 mil in a private jet so peel. [Supreme C]. Supreme C been after mean figures, ask my lil nigga. Since back in the days, before he was raised. Aint nobody puttin fear in my heart, who need a jumpstart. My art sharp, shoot your posse apart. Nigga take you on one by one, gun by gun. Son by son, done by done. Whoever come murder fest, one of the best. I'm gettin assets, collect ass bets, squat by your address. I come to kick it wit you, walk beans stickin wit you. Why try to hide from accomplice vibe. Yo we break bread, break heads, my people shake feds. Gamble and scramble, F what your man do. It's all about this husltin game, muscle and fame. Tussels in rain, take aim, blush you with game. My language is unexplainable, switch, changeable. And I stay remaindable, with bigger guns aimed at you. [HOOK]. [Hope]. I run up in Da Cypha heavily armed with endless bars of metaphoric harm. A python with poisonous charm, extending my arm. Pushing figures way to the back. Out of your reach, excessive like Fatal Attract. Freeze, a renegade bar stroke, an ace of spades. I'll kiss you wit a blade when I think I'm gettin played. Made woman, you never in bed with the same woman. You say you want it, you don't wanna see the omen. When my sixth sense start flowin I bless like holy water. I don't wanna die cuz I'm my daddy's only daughter. But yo, sometimes I see the writin on the wall. You know the ghetto testaments, the shootouts, the brawls. Close frames in the hall, will you stand or will you fall. Your whole click is on the run now would you tell it all. About the night shifters, me, I'ma cypher drifter. My sixteen bars is up so peace to the mixes. [HOOK 2X]. [Wyclef]. October 31st I was standing by the sour. These thugs don't wanna talk they want these Pumas I just bought. Fresh outta school, picked on cuz I'm bilingual. I barely spoke English but the gun language was universal. Ran in the grocery store, spoke to Gabriel. He said, you have problems, here's a feezy from Israel. Ran back outside, just before I could say... another homicide. Threw the biscuit in the bushes runnin like Jesse Owens. Police showed up, but I was nowhere in existence. Back in the crib thinkin bout what I just did. I'ma police of defense but I'm bound to catch this bid. My hypothesis was right, they knocked the door, homie. Like a super in the projects wantin rent money. Just when I thought I get my life straight in the states. Is when I found myself climbin down the fire escape. Bodies found in Virginia under the dumpsters, no. 18 shell cases in front of the grocery sto'. Flee the scene of the crime before y'all kick the door. No your honor that must be some old rhyme that I wrote. And lyrics sometime man they misinterpretate it. For example when I say gun I mean my pen and paper. And everytime I wave and spit the crowd jump. Cuz I'm still Digital Underground like ""humpty hump"". Feel the funk comin through your elephant trunks. I aint even *Kriss Kross* my clothes yet. And yet y'all wanna ""Jump, Jump"" in Da Cypha, ""Jump, Jump"". You in Da Cypha. [HOOK]. [OUTRO:]. Stay in the house when you hear. WooWooWooWooWoo. It means the murder's outside you hear. WooWooWooWooWoo. Where the real killers at you hear. WooWooWooWooWoo. Honey who chill with the gats you hear. WooWooWooWooWoo. Yo don't talk crap man. WooWooWooWooWoo. Just cuz your girl's wit you man. WooWooWooWooWoo. Cuz both o y'all gon go man. WooWooWooWooWoo. To a place where no man knows man. WooWooWooWooWoo. Femme fatale, Hope. WooWooWooWooWoo. Supreme C, kinda dope. WooWooWooWooWoo. Marie Antoinette in the back with the techs. WooWooWooWooWoo. Y'all know the flavor Refugee Camp.... WooWooWooWooWoo..."

Be strong. Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy. Now I understand what Scarface meant. When he said I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die. Never in my deepest thoughts that I would imagine. I would be the one carrying a coffin. Yo I feel like a orphan even though I got a mom. I'm the first born so I gotta play strong. Memories of the past bout when we cried when we laughed. It makes it hard, dad, for me to finish write this paragraph. I remember when we all shoved snow frost bites and all. Temperature forty below. You used to call me lazy cause I said it was too cold. But you would go in the crib fix me a fresh cup a cocoa. I can't front. I wish there was a sequel of the sixth sense. So I could see dead people. I'm so hurt, dad. I can't cry no more. But I know that you're knockin on heaven's door. Peace. Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy. Rest in peace, dad. Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy. All my people live on. Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy. Rest in peace, dad. Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy. Look into my eyes. Realize I'm the same man my father was. Y'all can tell by my Pink Cadillac. The way I clean my ride. Old grim tilted to the side. But what I loved most was when the God philosophize. About the philosophies of life in its reality. Keep the right mentality. Don't fall into vanity. Sometime I feel like he standin watchin over me. Whisperin in my ear, baby boy, I'm still here. I heard him said I'm the shadow right beside you. And if you confused, son, I'm there to guide you. And even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. I fear no evil. For the Lord is wit me. But don't forget that your mom's in your hands. You two were so close. That I finally understa nd. And here's a message to your brothers and your sisters. I'ma miss em. No matter what I'ma be wit em. Peace. Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy. To my dad, rest in peace. Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy. I guess I'll see you at the resurrection. Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy. To all my people that lost somebody. Da--a, daddy, daddy, daddy. Put the lighters in the air. Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy. Oh, daddy. Oh, daddy. Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy. Oh, yeah, yeah. I need you, daddy. Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy. Oh, oh.

Maybe my fans at the show saying don't stop. Probably the struggle of all refugees. Maybe the sign how the diamonds bling-bling, ching-ching. Ring ring, there's a call from my wifey, whoo. Perhaps I gotta make it home but music keep calling me. And maybe it's all I know, whatever it is I'm grateful for being. [Wyclef Jean]. A man with a guitar, a dude from the streets. A cat with a song, a ReFugee MC. Wyclef Jean, a Fugee for life. A preacher's son, first one on the run. I'm grateful that I haven't been shot. Stopped by the cops and they didn't find a glock. W-Y-C-L-E-F, I'm grateful. [Wyclef Jean]. Coulda been a crack fiend with no place to go. Lord, oh mighty God, have mercy on my soul. Coulda been Pablo, king of Yayo. Or a pimp with a limp screaming we don't love them hoes. Oh no, God knows, perhaps I was chosen. A source of inspiration for the next generation. And maybe it's all I know, whatever it is I'm grateful for being. [Wyclef Jean]. A man with a guitar, a dude from the streets. A cat with a song, a ReFugee MC. Wyclef Jean, a Fugee for life.

Everybody sing along now. You can make it like I made it. Don't let anyone tell you different. When doors close another door will open. Many have called but my people are chosen. You can make it if I made it. Don't let anyone tell you different. When doors close another door will open, yeah. Many have called but my people are chosen, yeah. [Wyclef Jean]. A man with a guitar, a dude from the streets. A cat with a song, a ReFugee MC (yeah). Wyclef Jean, a Fugee for life. A preacher's son, first one on the run.

Hey yo I'm standing at the bar with a, Cuban cigar. Guajila, Guantanamera. Hey, yo, I think she's eyeing me from afar. Guan-tana-mera.... Guajila Guan-tana-mera.... [Verse One: Wyclef Jean]. Yo, I wrote this in Haiti, overlooking Cuba. I asked her what's her name, she said, 'Guantanamera'. Remind me of an old latin song, my uncle used to play. On his old forty-five when he used to be alive. She went from a young girl, to a grown woman. Like a Virgin, so she sex with no average mahn. Peep the figure, move like a caterpillar. Fly like a butterfly, let your soul feel her glide. Pac Woman better yet Space Invader. If your name was Chun-Li, we'd be playin Street Fighter. Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for your kiss. A dime if you tell me that you love me. [Chorus:]. Guantanamera. Hey yo, I'm standin at the bar with a, Cuban cigar. Guajila, Guantanamera. Yo, I think she's eyeing me from afar. Guan-tana-mera.... Guajila Guan-tana-mera.... [singing in Spanish, with Wyclef responses]. Soy una mujer, sincera. (I am a sincere woman). Do you speak English?. De donde crecen las palmas. (From where the palm tree grows). Can I buy you a drink?. Soy una mujer, sincera. (I am a sincere woman). Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh. De donde creeeeeeecen las palmas. (From where the palm tree grows).

Aiyyo I'm standing at the bar with a, Cuban cigar. Guajila, Guantanamera. Hey yo John Forte, she's eyeing me from far. Guan-tana-mera.... Guajila Guan-tana-mera. [Verse Two: Lauryn Hill]. Yo, she was a rose in Spanish Harlem, mamacita beg your pardon. Make stakes at a faster rate then she fornicates. Pure traits of genius, Goddess of Black Venus. Crab niggaz angry cause they can't get between us. to no sele-xion, smooth complex-ion. The lexicon of Lexington, parents came from Cuba. Part Mexican, pure sweet, dimes fell to her feet. She like Movado, and shook her hips like Delgado. And broke niggaz down from the Grounds to Apollo. and then some, she took her act sent it to dim sum. And waited patiently while the businessmen come. Call late on purpose, got even politicians nervous. And made plans to infiltrate the street secret service. This gentle flower, fertility was her power. Sweet persona, Venus Flytrap primadonna. Que sera que sera she turned dinero to dinera. [Wyclef responds to singing again]. Guantanamera. Hey yo I'm standing at the bar with a, Cuban cigar. Guajila Guantanamera. Hey yo... I think she's eyein me from afar. Guan-tana-mera.... Guajila Guan-tana-mera..."

haitian experience,"Yeah, now I'm a rock-star, it started with my imagination. Used to gaze at the twins before the birds hit 'em. Daydream about the god, my axe, my excalibur.

And I used write these thoughts on a black and white notebook. Haitian experience, now I'm a page in a book. I'm a haitian, haitian. When I landed in america, 'merica.

When papa first got his green card, worked seven jobs in america. Then he came and got me from haiti, told me I had one chance. To make it in america. In the legal valley and lookin' for work in manhattan in america. My papa was a haitian, haitian. He got to america, 'merica. On a six month visa, visa.

heaven's in new york,"If it was my last day on earth. I'd treat it like my first. go out the way i came in. so innocent so pure with no thoughts of insecurity. Live life to the fullest be what i wanna be. Last day on earth I tell my momma dont cry I'll see my daddy in paradise. Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk. but for now Heaven's in New York. First thing I'd do is go back in time take the twin towers, put it back in the skyline. Tell my girl two wrongs still dont make a right. Make love for the last time under the candlelight. Pick up my hommies at the gentleman club after that hit. Man i sucked as a quarterback remember getting sacked man almost broke my back. If it was my last day on earth. I'd treat it like my first. go out the way i came in. so innocent so pure with no thoughts of insecurity. Live life to the fullest be what i wanna be. Last day on earth I tell my girl don't cry I'm with my daddy in paradise"

I'ma send this one out to all the refugee gangs around the world. Signal, signal, y'all need to chill with the driveby's. It was the Fourth of July I heard the cherry bomb bang. Stay in the house that's the sound of the gangs, Clef. By the time we figured out what happened. I was in an ambulance tellin my cousin keep breathing. [Chorus: Wyclef Jean].

That cemetery gear (California, California). I got my gun and nine from Hollywood, to your neck of the hood. [Wyclef Jean]. True, true, yo Hollywood got a lot of kids twisted. Jumpin in and out of limo's thinkin is his ass really gifted. The only gift y'all possess is workin with the triple six's. Y'all disguise yourself with bandanas and diamond necklaces. Mosta y'all can't even go back to the hood where y'all grew up. Actin like y'all drink alcohol and all y'all do is throw up. Talk about when y'all blow up y'all gonna visit the project floors. But the last time they saw y'all was 1984. Now y'all wonder, why they got all hoodies screamin ""freeze"". Get out the navigator, Godfather III's in the DVD. They hoppin, they take your car for a spin. It's cold outside so all you feel is the wind. There's no celly phone, so you can't phone home. Oh lord, here come those criminals Maleeg & Jerome. (""Yo, who you know here, you got family over here?""). He a rap artist. (""I don't care, he got the wrong colours over here, no fear""). Now you look shook like that Mobb Deep song. I'm surprised, cause on all y'all records you was Al Capone. And come to find out that you never held a chrome. And you escaped the draft and never bust a shot in Vietnam. Now you standin in the form amongst the children of the corn. Like the Sun of Man stood with a crown made of thorns. The only difference is for you there'll be no resurrection.

You never knew bout how we play these innings. But you about to play the commission. Waves are spinning, I'm out the glaze I'm sh...ing. The real is missing but the fraud is evident. ever so clear, but you got the nerd to come around here with pounds of fear. Your colours wrong you must rock edible dons with that huh?. Damn Paul, what's that huh?. Let me get that, with the quick snatch. If it's a little man in you then I better put the trick back. And if it's anything killers is fearing, I know my clit stacked for realer. [Chorus: Wyclef Jean]. Don't wear your colours here, that cemetery gear. I got my gun and nine, killing's my appetite.

however you want it,"[HOOK:]. However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts. Your body carried out the church. Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh my baby!). They shoulda took me first. However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts. Your body carried out the church. Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh...). [Verse 1]. Aiyyo. What y'all thought I was too busy writin songs with Whitney Houston. Cuz ''My Love's your Love'' will be my slugs wit blood. For any thug that wanna bang and play orangutang. Find yourself in the river with the rest of them. Wake up, wake up, I'm in a nightmare dream. Where I found myself loadin magazines after magazines. Ski mask on my face, gun on my waist. Fine pens shakin in my hand as I write this next line. You look strange, shootin victims at close range. And saw his vein burst from his neck, as I snatched his chain. Is this a Bible, I used to read the Gospel. Until I got betrayed by one of my twelve disciples. Which one, look through the crowd son. You could spot the traitor wit a tatto on his arm. The symbol is a microphone, an intellectual. A wannabe Rakim, but too extraterrestrial. I heard he's lethal and I'm too rusty to battle him. Me being rusty is like Biggie not being *Born Again*. It never happen, watch who you call fam. On MTV, he painted himself as the tin man. Predicted platinum, way before it happened. So that's why when you ship gold, you only sold aluminum. And now you wanna tell everybody I messed up your record?. C'mon!. [HOOK]. [Verse 2]. You a thug? You aint a murderer, just an undercover caligula. Cuz when you saw the luger became silent like Caesar. Enough of this rap stuff, Sedeck take his watch. If I wasn't rappin, I'd take that stash in your left socks. Don't make me raise my voice cuz I'm masterin a coo. So, and besides when they find you you'll be bones. Mom say watch my peers, hangin like chandeliers. Orderin Don P, you couldn't pay for one beer. Perpetratin, a fraud, oh god, you aint hard. Take thirty of y'all to murder one kid on the boulevard. You want Wyclef Jean, bring your same thug guys. Here's my advice, leave the ring with your bride. Cuz you aint comin back no more. We gon send you to a vacation for two, with crabs on the seashore. You freeze up, hold up I really thought you was psychotic. Is that tears in your eyes? You cryin for your life. Kid you tellin me what you did, you didn't wanna do. Watch what you say on record cuz it might come true. [HOOK]. [Outro:]. Should I take them? Should I wait?. Should I take them? Should I wait?. Should I take them? Should I wait?. I say ''No Woman, No Cry'' like I should own a piece of the estate. But at the tribute they didn't invite me. So I put in a call to Halis Alassi. He said be easy, aint no need to bust a shot (BLOW! BLOW! BLOW! BLOW!). Like Supercat said, yo the ghetto's red hot. Before bling, bling, bling it was BLING, BLING, BLING!"

industry,"[Intro]. Yeah I wanna dedicate this to everybody that love hip hop music. Cause without hip hop music I wouldn't be here today. Preacher's son, yeah. [Verse 1]. Imagine if Biggie and Pac never got shot. And they both still were rulers of hip hop. And Puffy and Suge was roomates from college. And Big L never got found in the alley. Nas and Jay-Z they were still homies. Squash the beef with Ja Rule and 50. Benzino shook hands with Eminem. And on the same record I heard Eve, Fox and Kim. And sometimes when I dream, that's when I wake up. I kinda hoped that The Fugees didn't break up. And when they walked into the studio I prayed they didn't spray. Cause I miss that scratch from Jam Master Jay (Whoa oh oh!!!). [Chorus]. Shots go off, mother's cry. Death since rise, homicide. Black on black crime needs to stop. Y'all can't blame it on hip hop. Cause what we say is what we see. What we see is reality. The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow. Soon they won't live to see tomorrow. [Verse 2]. Imagine if Big Pun was still alive. I could see Fat Joe screamin Terror Squad. Imagine if there were still four survivors still in Destiny's Child. And TLC never lost they Left Eye. Imagine Refugees never needin a passport. And John Forte never at Newark Airport. Million Man March, man, that was a start. Now I need a million more to meet me at Central Park. When the revolution start y'all 'gon have to play this. Imagine Slick Rick not gettin deported (Whoa oh oh!). [Chorus]. Shots go off, mother's cry. Death since rise, homicide. Black on black crime needs to stop. Y'all can't blame it on hip hop. Cause what we say is what we see. What we see is reality. The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow. Soon they won't live to see tomorrow. [Verse 3]. In the club never though Shyne shot the gun. But in the limosine JLO had to run. Paparazzi snappin shots through the mirror. That's when I saw a smile from Princess Diana. Back and forth and forth and back. Like Miss Aaliyah man do I miss her. The war goes on with The ROC and The Lox. Murder INC, G- Unit it's a fight to the top. Stop! We lost too many soldiers like Freaky Tah. While they get the cover of a magazine who got to die. [Chorus]. Shots go off, mother's cry. Death since rise, homicide. Black on black crime needs to stop. Y'all can't blame it on hip hop. Cause what we say is what we see. What we see is reality. The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow. Soon they won't live to see tomorrow. [Outro]. Yeah, peace be with y'all"

Yo, yo, yo, yo. I got fifty Bentley's in the West Indies. (It doesn't matter). I got a pocket full of cheese and a garden full of trees. (It doesn't matter). I just won the bingo bought a crib in Rio. (It doesn't matter). Cause if you ain't sharing, people ain't caring. Come up in the hood and take everything you're wearing. Back in the days it was all about the clubs. And the so-called thugs used to dance the break for love. The girls, they wouldn't say HEY!. Unless you bought 'em champagne like it was their birthday. Me I used to stand outside,. hustle my way in. I'm on the guest list plus five!. Who's performing tonight?. He said Shabba. Mister Lover that be needy and selective. (Someone jump the Rock's up in here). Disrespect emcees and catch a smack in your left ear. Light up like Vegas when its time to gamble. Girls scream for me like I was part of the Beatles. But I'm not honey. But I could be your Paul McCartney. An ebony or ivory into my Jacuzzi. Foundation like Kool Herc as DJ Red Alert go bizzerk. The needle ain't skip the record jerked. Cause y'all jumpin' too hard. (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!). [Wyclef](The Rock). I got fifty Bentley's in the West Indies. (It doesn't matter). I got a pocket full of cheese and a garden full of trees. (It doesn't matter). What? I just won the bingo bought a crib in Rio. (It doesn't matter). Yo cause if you ain't sharing, people ain't caring. Come up in the hood and take everything you're wearing. Yo Rock I just bought a fresh Bentley. (It doesn't matter if you just bought a fresh Bentley). [Wyclef](Melky Sedeck). How many of y'all ever been to a barbecue. And you always got an Uncle Juan that wanna show you. How all the dances go. And they start it off like this. Electric side on the dance floor. Freaky-deaky like Studio 54. GIRLS!! Until the IRS raids it. Drug money get converted into music. The dope man becomes an entertainer. Leave that crack alone!. I told the customers. I'm into bigger and better things Mr. Fiend. You want a hit?. Give me a guitar and a drum machine. And the crowd will scream loud when the bass thump. I can smell it in the air, the smell is funk. Excuse me I gotta cough. Girl you in so much ice you could freeze New York. You're man must really love you. What does he do for a living?. (He works on Wall Street he's only home two nights a week). That's when she said a little too much conversation. I think she want to indulge in lyrical masturbation. So I proceeded with the compensation, I said. Can I offer you a glass of Merrill Mrs. No Name?. (Let's get it straight huh, my name's Veronica). She had the ass the size of South America. She said ain't you that kid that sing Guantanamera. Way before Ricky Martin started Livin' La Vida Loca. What hood you come from?. I was raised in Brooklyn, but did my studies in Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem yeah that's short for New Jersey. Checked my watch it was a quarter to three. Slid to her crib when we opened the door. Her man was on the bottle waiting for her with the 44. [Wyclef](The Rock). Now what it look like, it ain't really that. (It doesn't matter). So he cocked the gat at my top hat. (It doesn't matter). Are you crazy? You was married!. (It doesn't matter). Cause if you ain't sharing, people ain't caring. Come up in your hood and take everything you're wearing. Yeah that's when shorty walked up to her man. And she said I gotta go I can't be here no more. And she said this. [Melky Sedeck]. Take me home, to the place. I belong at the Refugee Camp. And the Booga basement. That's where I live, oh. Come on. Yo Rock man, I sold like seventeen million records. (It doesn't matter how many records you've sold). Alright I'm with…yo check it out. You wanna go get diamond rings. (It doesn't matter if the Rock wants to go get diamond rings or not). Man listen, listen. I just got two new Grammy's man. (It doesn't matter about your Grammy's). It doesn't matter…."

Briefcase full o' cocaine on my way out, I tipped the doorman. Jumped into the cab said, ""Hail Mary, full of Grace"". Yesterday communion was the Mafia's reunion. Confessed to the priest, evade the apple, I ate the peach. Slept with Vanity, sold my soul to Robin Leach. Devil music in my ear, no fear, I'm pumpin Def Leppard. Slow down, here comes the narc' with the German shepherd. I got the plan, man, meet me in the van. I got this kid from the Sudan bringin tecs from Iran (uh-huh). Chorus. What do you mean, John 3 16?.

Women bring you more miseries like that movie. Stress go to India, smoke hashish with Ghandi (uh-huh). My bills of rights is to make sure you're alright. Superman left the gang, cause his weakness was Crips-tonight (bing). Godfather got the cottonballs to his cheeks. Pig couldn't fly straight so you die in your sleep. I stay awake only to see Nicodemus. The young one got murdered, the day was the Sabbath. Chorus. What do you mean, John 3 16?. For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16.

Pretty little dancer, voice like Tina Turner. Chickenheads are you a virgin? Yeah right, so was Madonna!. S-s-sinner, sinner, seek the master. If not, feel the explosion from the day after. Bit by the vampire, worked for the mobster. Two to the head - and now you swimmin with the lobsters. We got'cha got'cha, set up in Oklahoma. You caught a bad one like a kid catchin pneumonia. So storyteller, what's the moral of this story?. Live reality and don't get caught up in your fantasy. Chorus. What do you mean, John 3 16?. For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16.

men in blue (no airplay),"[Wyclef]. Yo, the Brooklyn Bridge is going to collapse yo. Yo, this is Wyclef Jean the Refugee Allstars up in here. The CNN for the world. Yo what's this I here about the police in Brooklyn?. Turn this jam up yo. Yo this is the type of jam that be getting No Airplay. I want the whole world to hear this joint right here (apocalypse baby). Yo this is the type of jam that be getting No Airplay. You asked for it buddy, here it comes.... [Wyclef - Hook - 2x]. One, two ; watch out for the man in blue. Three, four; I keep it raw and hardcore. Five, six; you're beating us with nightsticks. Seven, eight; I'm forced to pack a thirty-eight. Nine, ten; you put me in a pen. if I could do it all again, I'd probably bust your chin. [Wyclef - Verse One]. I'm from a land of black bats, alley rats and cats. Scratch up my car, set me up for the carjack. Under pressure, I've got a legal gat. Two straps, a total of sixteen caps. Say something positive? More positivity. More positivity, more police brutality. Thugs get angry, the violence increase. You want peace, make Wyclef chief of police. Riding through the hood it's the same old story. It's either you play ball or you drug dealy-dealy. Standing on the block when the spot gets hot. Guaranteed to get set up, by a crooked cop. So I'm sittin back, rhyming on instrumentals. Anything I touch, it turns monumental. Me and Jerry Wonder, we keep it credible for the streets. At the same time we've gotta eat. When we commercialize it's to enterprise. We're guaranteed to sell a hundred mil before we die. But Jerry is broke, that's the situation. Nine-seven, it's like no more eviction. No more war milk, no more government cheese. Police keep on shooting at our bulletproof Bentleys. [Pre-chorus]. Yo this is the type of jam that be getting No Airplay. The Brooklyn Bridge is about to collapse, apocalypse. This the type of jam that be getting No Airplay. The ghetto is fed up, we got the arms in the air. [Hook - 1x]. [Wyclef - Verse Two]. Hey yo, back on Earth, the party's still at the Tunnel. on the West side of the river, what man quiver. Rats get fed to the alligator. Gun blasts equivalent to the bombs in Pearl Harbor. Rescue choppers, Brooklyn turned to Hiroshima. I'm driving to Jersey to escape the terror. I was on the highway pushing a black Viper. A car pulls up, is he a jack or a sniper?. A blue Range Rover, he says pull over. I didn't know he was a DT undercover. I screamed out my lungs, 'This is discrimination!. What's the charge?'. He said, 'You just robbed a gas station'. 'Who me? Not me! It couldn't be,. I was at the Grammy's with L-Boogie, didn't you see me on TV?'. 'B.S.!, you're all in the same gang'. He ran me off the road, like he was Roscoe Pe-col-trane. I stayed calm, gave him a hell of a show. Cause if it's ever time to go, all I gotta press is turbo. Heard him on his walkie, road block on 280 West. Things got serious, that's when I bust a left. U-Turn, my tires burn, my concern, was the truck. comin head-on collision waited a second, changed position. Close one heh, I almost went up in a blaze. Running from what appeared to be a masquerade. You know the story, it's the same old math. In Brooklyn, police put a plunger up a man's ass!. [Pre-Chorus]. This is the type of jam that be getting No Airplay. The Brooklyn Bridge will collapse son!. This is the type of kam that be getting No Airplay. Police brutality needs to stop!!!. [Hook]. I'm out!. Wyclef Jean, CNN...CNN...CNN! (Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?). Can't forget Jersey though baby!. Police brutality is all around the whole world,. we really need to chill all of that out..."

new day,"What we gon' do right now is go back, way back. Bring in the groove. I wanna dedicate this to those who never made it. From kindergarten to the 12th I never graduated. Yo but college wasn't for some of us. So we joined the service. I seen a kid get murdered in Nam listening to Elvis. But on the out looking in. Things stay the same. But at the same vein. Looking out the whole world's changed. So keep your head up. Don't get caught up in the fast bucks. And find your mom crying while your lying in a black tux. Trust me. We don't need no education says a young man. Sitting in class (sitting in class). School is out 3 o'clock on the dot. He had beef with some kids and he got shot, oh Lord. Turn on the television.

next generation,"(feat. Rah Digga, Scarface). . . [Wyclef]. Hold on now, don't die now, be strong now. He said, I was born a crack baby. In a plastic bag in the alley. Raised in a foster home. With no mother to love and I never knew my papi. Back in the days of Bobby McFerrin. Used to sing don't worry, be happy. Lord how can I be happy. When I don't even know my own family tree Lord. [Wyclef]. We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die. The only thing I fear is the after life. Cos I don't know what's there on the other side. But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try. [Wyclef]. Gang poppin' things, doing drive-by's and angers. Kids going to school putting fears in their teacher. The teacher let them know that it ain't all good. Cos the gang was created to protect the neighborhood, now. All you red now, all you blue now. All you yellow now, follow me now. To that place of righteousness. Where the only thing that matters is your consciousness, he said. [Wyclef]. We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die. The only thing I fear is the after life. Cos I don't know what's there on the other side. But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try. [Wyclef]. In my father's kingdom there are many mansions. All the rooms are free, there is no tax collection. I can see Biggie, Tupac, Moses and Abraham. Jason, the one and two's, jamming with the sun of man. [Scarface]. I've been kicked, I've been stabbed. I've been shot, I've been ? by a. Person that I thought I trusted, where I live. It's a war at the cribs, walk with a strap. Myself cos I don't want nobody's son on my back. My mind playing tricks ?, to really ?. Me out in five unless I take another hit. I done seen the sun set on the other side of town. Now I'm drifting in the darkness, Heaven hold me down. ? ? ? but I know I'm born dying. Feel the tears of the angels looking down on me crying. For a lying ass but yo forgive us in a while. And I'm sorry, never let me forget that I'm your child. While I'm locked up in this basement staring eye to eye with Satan. In this cold dark world with no patience. We get plotted on by agents with talks of replacing. The Africans, Jamaicans and the Haitians in this next generation. [Wyclef]. We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die. The only thing I fear is the after life. Cos I don't know what's there on the other side. But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try. [Rah Digga]. Whoa, we the next generation, look at what we facing. The kids raise themselves, all kind of temptation. Flowers and candles decorating all the pavements. No, the perpetrator ain't seeing no arrangements. Nobody cares about the feelings of the poor. Man they suffer while we spending eighty billion on a war, uh. Cutting school budgets, US stockmarket plummets. Condition's only worse and I wonder what become it. Metal detectors replace music classes. Angry little kids wanna beat their teacher's asses. The red and blue's, somebody gotta lose. Reality TV be reality for who. I don't question what the Lord found in me. I just pass it on to folks with no boundaries. Got a long road ahead of us, AIDS already gettin' us. Now we got stars, how many will there be left of us. [Wyclef]. We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die. The only thing I fear is the after life. Cos I don't know what's there on the other side. But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try"

Under pressure, I gotta leave the gat. Two straps, a total of sixteen caps. Say something positive? No positivity. More positivity, more positivity brutality. Thugs get angry, the violence increase. You want peace, make Wyclef chief of police. Riding through the hood, it's the same ol story. It's either you play ball or you drug dealy dealy. Standin on the block when the spot get hot.

Forty caliber, seventeen through your character. Waterworld's world, underwater, Sub Mariner. Derringer, twenty-two one in the challenger. Seven, four-eight, 23rd on the calender. My word verses, burst raps you rap nervous. It's worthless, you get smashed up, on the surface. Projectile, my forty-four style, blood on silver. The red ripper, fill up the resevoir nigga. Armageddeon, you smack dead on, a world crisis. The nicest, for sixteen bars, of preciseness. [Wyclef]. One two, watch out for the man in blue. Three four, I keep it raw and hardcore. Five six, you're sticking me with nightsticks. Seven eight, I'm forced to call Canibus. Nine ten, you put me in a pen; if I could. do it all again, I'd probably bust your whole chin. [Canibus]. You got a gat nigga, use it, go 'head pull it. Scientists got raw footage of me dodgin bullets. I walk the streets with heat, three biscuits. Outnumberin niggaz twin glocks with triplets. When I spit shit I lace it, you get punched in face with. puncutations of five-knuckle phrases. I assure you the vocalist standin before you. will destroy you with temperatures hot enough to flamebroil you. My tongue moves much faster than yours do. Every three thousand styles I change my voiceboxes oil. Embarass you in front of your crew to annoy you. If you know some chicks that suck a good dick, then I'll employ you. To this hip-hop shit, Canibus stays loyal. That's why every Killuminati I battle somebody for you. I'm warnin you, me versus you, I hurt you. My balance enables me to squaredance in a circle. Your head'll spin so fast you'll catch whiplash. I practice lyrical witchcraft on your bitch ass. Make your hard drive crash to C colon backslash (C:/). Go back to the roots and reprogram your wack ass, nigga. [Wyclef]. One two, watch out for the man in blue. Three four, I keep it raw and hardcore. Five six, you're sticking us with nightsticks. Seven eight, I'm forced to pack a thirty-eight. Nine ten, you put me in a pen; if I could. do it all again, I'd probably bust your whole chin. Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at? (right here, right here). A-ight? New Jersey in the house.... The people versus gestapo, what what. Yo, there'll be no sequel to this revolution. There will be no sequel to this revolution.

oh what a night,"[Inrto: Wyclef]. It's funny how the Earth rotates, man you never know what's. going to happen, ya know mean?. All I said was ""Aiight, I got this chiki bang bang dang da dang"". Then it all got it started for me, man. Yo, man I'm just getting back from the tour, man. What it be like, man?. Yo, bust it, turn me up. Somebody told me if you can make in New York City, man, you can. make it anywhere else, man. Somehow I believe that shhhh. [Chorus (Wyclef)]. Oh, what a night. Late December, 1993 (what happened?). Who thought he would rule the industry?. What an MC on the grind. [Wyclef]. Yo, I ain't always have whips, I ain't always have yachts. I ain't always have chips, I ain't always have rocks. Matta fact I was a grimey little negro. Who said if music didn't work, I'd sell diesel. What cha'll thought, I wasn't raised in the projects?. First of the month waitin for that PA check. Lived on the first floor. Were so poor that if you rung the buzzer the roaches would answer the door (who is it?). I went from boy to man in one night. When I saw my life flash like light from poltergeist. What made it worse, I couldn't speak English. But from his facial expressions, he wanted my Adidas. So hurry up and come out and play. I'll be damned if I leave bare-footed in this hallway. And I got big plans, so beg your pardon. Cause next year this time I'ma sell out the Garden. [Chorus]. [Wyclef]. Yo, yo, I ain't gonna brag and boast and say I did it all. But I'm the only rapper to play Carnegie Hall. The first rap group, video cost a million. First rapper to ever rep for the Haitians. And sa fa say, na boolay. Grammy night, we took 3 away. 22 million sold, I can't believe this. There's still ain't a rapper alive who could achieve this. But I ain't satisfied, when back to my home contemplating. How could I become the next Quincy Jones?. That's when Jerry hit me up on the horn and said. ""Clef, your on the cover of. the cover of The Source by The Rolling Stones"". No more struggling, good life we loving it. You could live it too, if you only publish it. So here we go, so what's the scenario?. I own so many cars that I'm renting 'em for videos. [Chorus]"

Inhale, exhale herbal meditation. Put the fire arms away. Cause we don't want no confrontation. Not me, I'm talkin bout you jerk. Cause when you die your life ain't even worth the paperwork. So, peace God, even through war we bring peace. And after the blood shed then your first son deceased. And you will understand I'm the beginning of the end. The alpha, omega, the present, and the future. So hold on to your winchester. Cause the hollow tip penetrate lead through your polyester. Peace God, even though we ice the wrist. Guzzle the fifth. Protect us with a crucifix, Lord. And bless me with an extra clip. So just in case one jam release my twin from my waistband. [Chorus x 2]. Ay, yo peace God. I ain't tryin' to see the graveyard. But in this game of life I was dealt the wrong card. I wasn't born this way it just came to be. Sellin crack through a alley where the fiends rally. Where the dealer was the president. And the fiend was the voter so they voted for the government. And stick ups was only natural. It seem every other day a new gun pointed at you. Peace God. Yo only God got the answer. And sorry bout ya mom dyin of cancer. But congratulations, I heard you no longer a runner. You a big man now, the black Tony Montana. But watch out cause I heard wealth bring envy. Trust me I did sing for the Kennedies. Until we meet again feel my words through my pen. And stay pure in the city of sin. [Chorus x 2]. [Humming]. [Chorus x 2]"

pj's,"Mmmmmmmmm... yeah. [Wyclef]. (PJ's!) I was born in the PJ's. So I gotta rep for the PJ's. The elevators with the pissy hallways. Bangin on the project walls, all day. [Verse 1]. Yo if it wasn't for the PJ's y'all probably never heard of me. Y'all be like, ""Who the hell is Wyclef, and what's a Fugee?"". I'd probably be standin on a corner - watch you approach. Steal ya dope, sell ya coke, then snatch ya rope. Run for brokes with the cash and the jewels. Bows-eye, I hold my breath when I shoot. The reason you should hold ya breath; cuz most thugs. when they breathe and shoot tecs, they aim right but shoot left. Now they flesh being swept off the surface. If you ain't B.I.G. then Notorious. So why ya man reckless, side-ballin like he holdin heat. Someone bring him a bed, for the permanent sleep. Weight beneath Jacob's Latter and the Aftermath. Don't matter if you use a desert eagle as your armor. Blood splatter, glass shatter through the project slums. Another one in the obituary column son. [Chorus]. (PJ's!) I was born in the PJ's. So I gotta rep for the PJ's. The elevators with the pissy hallways. Bangin on the project walls, all day. (PJ's) I gotta make noise for the PJ's. Wrote my first rhyme in the PJ's. You can hear it in my speech, I'm from the PJ's. The PJ's! PJ's. [Verse 2]. Before I was signed, I used to move on the block. All I wanted to do was rhyme, rhyme, rhyme. Line for line, I make the blind man walk in a straight line. to prison - and take a message to Shyne. Peace God from the PJ's to Ground Zero. It's a ""Hardknock Life"" but ""The Sun'll Come Out Tomorrow"". Walk with a shadow through ghettos, playin in every borough. You would think rap was rock they way I carry heavy metal. It such a shame, cocaine in ya veins, screamin. ""Team Spirit"" grippin the shottie like Kurt Cobaine. In the projects God, nuttin come easy. Gotta deal with the grimy, greasy, the sleasy. Move like a professional, young thug funeral. Wattchu thought this was another Pepsi commercial?. Nah it's the art of war, when you least expected it. Wyclef the president, the PJ's elected him. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. Yeah, and to the teachers that said I wouldn't live. and my remains would be found under the Verizano Bridge. Well I'm alive teach! So put ya theory to rest. I ain't Makaveli but I might fake my death. Make no mistake, I'm a hip-hop artist. Before the diamond in the Billboard, the hood charted it. Surburbia bought it, we bootlegged it, we couldn't afford it. Cuz in the PJ's we undergroudn like black markets. The 'P' stand for public housing. The 'R's for respect that ya get, when ya hold down ya set. The 'O's for ounces that we flip into ki's. The 'J's for the judgement handed by the ju-ry. The 'E' is for enter, at your own risk. You know the 'C' - that's for the cats that's out to get rich. And the 'T'... trust no one. And the 'S' is for the snitchers - you know the outcome.... [Chorus]"
pullin me in,"[Intro:]. Y'all know y'all done messed up now right?. Mmmm mmmm, fo' real. [opera singing]. You know, you messed up, I'm not laughing. All y'all beats is soundin the same, y'all rhymin the same. Some of y'all even wearing the same jewelry. And y'all doin the same videos. Shut up, you know you messed up right?. That's why they brought me back in this game. To bring it right back to the essence, mmm hmmm. Oh yeah, and all this kill this, kill that, kill this. Lemme tell you somethin, (what, what). The real killers, they're standin right over there. Waitin for you to act like a killer, so they can kill you. Yo Sedeck, do me a favor yo. Yo tell everybody on this side of the stage. To just move back a little cuz it's about to get real rowdy. in the front yo, they comin yo. I could never forget the underground hip hop. I'ma dedicate this to everybody that knew me when I was broke. Workin at Burger King, hustlin dime bags on a twelve speed bicycle. All the projects man, youknowwhatimsayin?. Yo. [HOOK:]. Every time I keep pullin out, y'all keep pullin me in, sin. Kick a little somethin for the New Jerusalem. Let people know you aint forget where you came from, where you came from. Every time I keep pullin out, y'all keep pullin me in, sin. Kick a little somethin for the street DJs. Let people know you aint forget where you came from, where you came from. [Verse 1]. Yo, yo this probably the hardest verse that I ever recite. I'm in the studio with a gun in my neck it's all right. Surrounded by gangsters, I don't know how they got here. But I feel like the Haitian Frank Sinatra, in his young years. New York, on my way to Kennedy airport. L.A., I was told wear colors wherever you walk. Dirt, dirty south, I heard they run up in your house. Shakespeare, no time to jive blast your girl through the blouse. What? MCs, y'all aint nothing but assassins. Every two lines is killin, or incarceration. Murderation, closed casket cremation. Closest you got to prison was seein barson television. But I'ma go long as this thug phenomenon. Pass me a bandanna, two shots from my Mag-num. All of that, to get your attention. Here's a few things I been dyin to mention. Anyone talk about guns, I'ma buy the cartel. Any more beats soundin the same, I'ma put your MPC to cell. Listen, reminiscing on Nas, *It Aint Hard To Tell*. Still feel like somebody's watching me like Rockwell. Talk about diamonds, I'ma kidnap Jacob. Talk about the Fugees, I'ma break up the make up. Put your stake up, I'm about to work my way back to the streets. And y'all wanna bootleg cuz y'all will get Jay-Z. [HOOK (variations)]. Kick a little something for the projects Clef. Kick a little something for the hip hop fans. [Verse 2]. Hip hop fans, y'all like the woman in my house. No matter how faithful I am, y'all still have your doubts. Talkin bout, is he real in this relationship. Or did he go pop, and on the side get a mistress. My mistress is a guitar, classical like Mozart. Paint murder on the wall just to show y'all some art. And y'all wanna start, and lose body parts. I suggest you start walkin, tell your man stop talking. You know the scenario, the innocent is always the first to go. And Dorothy sings somewhere over the rainbow. Kum Ba Ya, got you trapped in barbed wire. Dope delivery, but I'm the ghost writer. Tall tribes of Juda, deeper than books. Watch what you cook cuz you might get hooked. Man... I miss real MCs. Like Kool G Rap, written in graffiti. Before the plane, I used to take the train. Watch fiends puttin up they vein, moms raisin caine. Able's on the roof, cook like a goose. To calm my nerve, I drink Vodka 180 proof. I'm back in the shack, lay flat on my back. Two choices, sell rap or sell crack. Chose sell rap, but watch my back like I'm sellin crack. Cuz the music industry is the same street format. I sold y'all Nappy Heads, to The Score, to The Carnival. But yet y'all still wanted more. Since Sedeck went back, came off wit a break. I blend so perfect, that you would want it for your mixtape. [beatbox]. [HOOK (variations)]. Kick a little something for the brothers up north"

Rebel music, everywhere put the peace sign up now. Rebel music, hold on, listen. [Wyclef]. Tell the DJ turn the music up. Gangsters in the club, everybody thugs.

The music industry brainwash celebrities. Girls sleep sexy, they wake up with a monster. Have no idea that their face was a piranha. Word from the wise I can see through the fog. Reason why they rob cause they got no job. [Wyclef]. But I woke up in the morning, sexy, yawning. Feel like it's gonna be a good day. No war on the street, no way, today.

Our DNA's foreign to them. We kings of the planet Earth, Gods if you will. Yo, cash be my ?, it's about to get stupid. These niggaz trying to stop our plans, peace to it.

red light district,"Intro. Yeh, ohh!. Check me out, look. It goes love, hate, pleasure and pain. Fo' albums in the can and I'm STILL in the game (what up?). And last album, they don't like me to tell this. Debuted at #1 and sold more records than Elvis (shut up!). That's what they tellin me, switch up your melody. Through with misdemeanors, they tryin to give rappers felonies. So they can lock us up one at a time. But true writers stay FREE in e'ry one of our lines. And if you not feelin I'm the cream of the crop. I'll KNOCK rappers off your list 'til I get to the top!. Still you lookin at a man that's financially stable. Only nigga gettin checks cut from four different labels. That Pillsbury dough, women poke my guts. Still I walk around the streets like I'm broke as FUCK. So if you see me in your town and I appear to be moody. It's cause I'm thinkin 'bout plans that's bigger than Serena booty. Me and Shaka still starvin and lookin for meals. And HEADS UP! Ludacris is almost out of his deal. I'm over ten million sold, every album is CRACK. And for now I'm bout to carry Def Jam on my BACK. Mad rappers I hear you talkin way down at the bottom. Though I make big money, still handle small problems. The ramblin at the mouth, I don't PLAY THAT SHIT. I'm the best and I ain't really got SAY THAT SHIT!"

The break is over man, I'm back with the ink pen. Like Ali bomaye okay I'm on my second wind. Used to roll dice when the luck was on my side man. Four-five-six, walked away with a grand man. Seen many blocks turn to the Twilight Zone. D.A. on the case like Sherlock Holmes. My old high school sweetheart started sniffin a bone. For the right bag she deep throat, deeper than a baritone. I caught you off guard, this verse is unexpected, check it. Like when I rhymed on Big Pun's record, check it. I got a swagger that cut any rapper mind over matter. Lyrical dagger like alcohol I'm bad for your liver. Quiver, shiver body temperature get found in Hudson River. Deliver a message to your miss you won't be comin over. And if you on the street tonight, see that ReFugee logo. We beam around the world like satellite. [Chorus One: Wyclef Jean]. It's them hip-hop boys, turn your radio down. It's the rock 'n roll boys, turn your radio down. It's them reggae boys, turn your radio down. Neighbors mind your business. It's a riot, Trouble again! The world is getting nervous. It's a riot, Trouble again! Main journey's the unconscious. It's a riot, Trouble again! The world is getting nervous. It's a riot, Trouble again! Main journey's the unconscious.

Yeah you're right, we got enough for everyone. So get all your friends and your families and come along. Move to the beat that's all we do we got Jerusalem. Everyday we offer praises like King Solomon. Ain't gon' hurt ye, don't be nervous. I'm your guardian angel, know you purpose. And if I look at you low, if I should make it. Believe me, I leave you, show you how to make it. (Hung up high, in the M-I). (Double-S-I, S-S-I). (P-P-I, three-piece tie). (Wanna see me die so the heavens they cry). [Chorus Two: Wyclef Jean].

Main journey's the unconscious. It's a riot, Trouble again! The world is getting nervous. It's a riot, Trouble again! Main journey's the unconscious. [Verse Three: Wyclef Jean]. I was down in Texas; drivin wreckless. Police stop me, axe me for my license (oh yeah). Registration so I played him some Elvis. He let me go, then I lit off the chalice. I said if things don't change, we headed for the Arma-ged-deon. And the great dragon with seven head, ten. horns, at the Arma-ged-deon. Listen to the choir children. [Verse Four: Serj Tankian]. The matterings of all matter. Masters and their extended batters. Internet intelligence for investments for the natural world. Their divestments; truth is knowledge. Although bi-polar if it's attainment is equitable. Man's mirrors face the flesh but hide the spirit. in opposite worlds; vision can only be attained universally. Lamps of varied sizes and shapes carrying different shades. All having the propensity to illuminate. Let's ruminate on realization that the means is the end. The Earth's water is mirroring the stream-of-consciousness. The dead being reborn as flowers. smiling through the battlefields. [Wyclef Jean (Serj)]. It's them hip-hop boys, turn your radio down. It's the rock 'n roll boys, turn your radio down. (Flowers, smiling through the battlefield!). [repeat to 21 seconds before the end]. It's a riot, Trouble again! The world is getting nervous. It's a riot, Trouble again! Main journey's the unconscious. It's a riot, Trouble again! The world is getting nervous. It's a riot, Trouble again! Main journey's the unconscious"

To show the Free Bob right. The righteous Asiatic thinker. While Satan rob light. Civilised like the Molly. Burgundy, wildy rocking. Seen the fifth when Ali clocked him. John Forte will keep you locked in. [Q-Tip]. People all around. You got to recognise and witness. The Mister who swift enough to knock you out with Mic fitness. Hands blistered from holding the mics tight. Some say it's fright night. Well throw the R after the F 'Cause I'm gonna take away your breath. The bell rings and now it's just a daily operation.

Send me an angel in the morning, baby. Send me an angel in the morning, darling. Send me Muhammad in the morning, baby. Send me an angel in the morning, darling. [Ali Shaheed Muhammad]. Once the pen hits the pad it's danger. To this I be no stranger. Step inside the ring and I'll derange you (Come on). I'm hearing no comments. Everyone looks dispondent. Dejected, rejected similiar to Liston. Catching lists. Beat it, sonny. My man is still the greatest in this. To hell with Frazier yappin' about that negative shit. Now listen, you can try and escape if you want to. But ask yourself, who the hell you gonna run to. Like Sade Abu you got a punch that I can sleep to. Fugees, Tribe, Busta Rhymes forever coming through. [Prazwell]. We sing Amazing Grace over two dollar plate. One roll snake eyes like Jake The Snake. Many lies put up for stakes. Wash our sins at the Great Lakes. You and I cannot see eye to eye. So therefore we cannot relate. I'm here when I make myself crystal clear. You fled to Cape Fear when I laced you in Zaire. Tussle with a lasso in the Royal Rumble. Seperate boys from men in the concrete jungle. [Busta Rhymes]. I remember when Cassius Clay flipped the script. Taking trips to Zimbabwe. Africans started calling the God Ali Bumbaye (so bwoy). It be the God stricken, God nutrition, lightly stricken (ha). Blow that make you feel like you was poison bitten. Ha yo I'm 'bout to blister you and your sister. Predicting every ass whipping before my fights my nigga. This be your last warning once you walk past the doorman. Ali and Foreman gonna lock ass until the morning. Marvellous finances provided by Joseph Mobutu. Special guests of honour like the Archbishop Desmond Tutu. We watched the Rumble In The Jungle. To see who be the targeted uncle to be the first to fall and fumble. Nuff blows they gettong thrown, like solid milestones. Internally shaking up niggas, imbalance your chromosones. With the force of a thousnad warriors. When I bust your ass identify me as the lord victorious. Blocks on fire (You're a star). (Blocks on fire). Fiends getting higher (You're a star). Robbing blue collar (You're a star). (Yeah rob them blue collars). Killing for a dollar (You're a star). Youths get tired (You're a star). (Youths getting tired). We're dealing with them liars (You're a star). (We're dealing with too many liars). From Brooklyn to Zaire (You're a star). We need a ghetto Messiah"

Hoping that darkness brings me light. Praying for that better day where we won't have to runaway. [Bridge]. Runaway. We living like runaways. Wake up. Stretching in the morning. Trying to make it through the day. Brush my teeth. Hit the streets. Where there's heat. We afford to beef. Hoping one day. We don't have to run away. [Chorus]. I didn't want to runaway.

Not me, it could never happen to me. Professor says what you wanna do? Sell drugs or get a degree?. Looked at him and smiled with 32 gold teeth. And said what you make in a year, I make it in a week. Elementary at the time, I don't think of gettin caught. Sellin with degrees, pickups at the seaport (come on). Once caught, you know the drill, it's military. I can't lie, it gets scary, you screamin' for your mommy (come on). Truth or dare, beware, the game is never fair. I'm fallin and I can't get up, like a dead hare. You stare like you seen me before. Yup, you put the gat to my gut, stuck me up in the truck. And said, ""Don't nothin move but the goods"". Caught an arrow in your back fuckin wit Robin Hood. [John Forte]. This street life'll get you if the hustle don't fit you. Paranoid crews don't choose, nigga stick you. Arms and foldin macks to ya back tryin'a vick you. Belief in my crew wishin' foes never get through. And if so, Shalom, bless my soul, I'm home. I lived my life to the fullest, neighborhoods now known. A stone face is outta place when discussin B.I.. If I have a second thought, you ought not reply. I fought hot and sticky summers when the game started heatin. Competition, mega jail, and the well, who was eatin (oh well). And every cell in the bang had a tenant. With each of them regrettin they was in it. [Wyclef (singing):]. Have you ever heard the sound of a .44, at your door?. You got guns, I got guns.

I got up, sunny day, hood callin my name. Strange, I feel nauseous, memories of a pine cauffin. Seemed to me that I was dreamin. I'd been struck by a crazed fan after the concert, damn. Slugs form and I hurt, hopped up, checked my physical. But the pain was all mental, I slipped into. The shower, hopped out, got dressed, hit the blocks. Swarmed with cops, mad shots, hot shells dropped. You ever heard the sound of a .44 at your door?. Before, many times, I answered back with a milli. Now what? Now give me mine. It ain't no games like B.D.P.. My 9-meter go da-da-da-da-dang-hey hey. [Wyclef (singing):]. Have you ever heard the sound of a .44, at your door?. You got guns, I got guns.

She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day. All he wanna know is (where my money at?). Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread. All he wanna know is (where my money at?). She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard. All he wanna know is (where my money at?). She bawls, he'd call (where my money at?). . . (AND THIRD WEEZY!) She used to be the sweetest girl ever. Whatever, now she like sour ameretta. She wears a dress to the T like the letter. And if you make it rain she will be under the weather. She used to run track back in high school. Now she tricks on the track right by school. She takes a loss cause she don't wanna see her child lose. So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used. And then she runs to the pastor. And he tells her there will be a new chapter. But she feels no different after. And then she asks him, ""Where my money at? "". . . Yeah, light that... yes sir!. (AY RAEKWON!). Move flow, then over the stove, open pie racks. And smoke and chain dangled, vein in my brain tangled. Thinkin bout broth in both coasts is all on my money made. I should be revealed to Oprah. But flashin to the times I was broke, no lights. No gas, couldn't buy Ivory soap. But got with a sick-type clique. You know, the smart ones who came through. Frontin with the long jumps. About a week later, we on, we been, hate us. Shoebox and money lookin bummy my delagators. Or ride for me, hide from me, bust a 4-5 for me. Police come, see us gone, we survivors, shorty. . Some live for the bill. Some kill for the bill. She wined for the bill. Grind for the bill (And she used to be sweetest girl. Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay the bill (where my money at?). Tonight Wyclef, RAE-kwon, Weezy on the bill. WHERE MY MONEY AT?"

the industry,"[Intro]. Yeah I wanna dedicate this to everybody that love hip hop music Cause without hip hop music I wouldn't be here today. Preacher's son, yeah. [Verse 1]. Imagine if Biggie and Pac never got shot And they both still were rulers of hip hop And Puffy and Suge was roomates from. college And Big L never got found in the alley Nas and Jay-Z they were still homies Squash the beef with Ja Rule and 50. Benzino shook hands with Eminem And on the same record I heard Eve, Fox and Kim And sometimes when I dream, that's when I. wake up I kinda hoped that The Fugees didn't break up And when they walked into the studio I prayed they didn't spray Cause. I miss that scratch from Jam Master Jay (Whoa oh oh!!!). [Chorus]. Shots go off, mother's cry Death since rise, homicide Black on black crime needs to stop Y'all can't blame it on hip hop. Cause what we say is what we see What we see is reality The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow Soon they won't. live to see tomorrow. [Verse 2]. Imagine if Big Pun was still alive I could see Fat Joe screamin Terror Squad Imagine if there were still four survivors. still in Destiny's Child And TLC never lost they Left Eye Imagine Refugees never needin a passport And John Forte never at. Newark Airport Million Man March, man, that was a start Now I need a million more to meet me at Central Park When the. revolution start y'all 'gon have to play this Imagine Slick Rick not gettin deported (Whoa oh oh!). [Chorus]. Shots go off, mother's cry Death since rise, homicide Black on black crime needs to stop Y'all can't blame it on hip hop. Cause what we say is what we see What we see is reality The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow Soon they won't. live to see tomorrow. [Verse 3]. In the club never though Shyne shot the gun But in the limosine JLO had to run Paparazzi snappin shots through the mirror. That's when I saw a smile from Princess Diana Back and forth and forth and back Like Miss Aaliyah man do I miss her The war. goes on with The ROC and The Lox Murder INC, G- Unit it's a fight to the top Stop! We lost too many soldiers like Freaky Tah. While they get the cover of a magazine who got to die. [Chorus]. Shots go off, mother's cry Death since rise, homicide Black on black crime needs to stop Y'all can't blame it on hip hop. Cause what we say is what we see What we see is reality The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow Soon they won't. live to see tomorrow. [Outro]. Yeah, peace be with y'all"
the mix show,"We gon send this out for every street dj. This is somethin for the mix shows. Mix shows. You don’t wanna go outside. Because the thugs are outside. They bustin slugs outside. So you don’t wanna go outside. Let’s go. Uh, I’m outside lookin in. I could feel it through the wind. From the streets’ shore. I could see the shark’s fin. They ain’t eat nuttin in a week. And they hunger is the reason why the blood drips on the concrete. So run your juice. Pit bulls drew. They gon shoot you in the head so what good is your bullet proof. Unless your bullet proof-la what’s your affiliation. You just a rat handin out information. You wanna run and said clef took my paper. Clef ain’t take your paper. Clef is just a narrator. Think I’m a singer. I’ma have you call a operator. 911 now you breavin through a respiratior. All dat gun-clappin yappin meet me outside. You never seen a ghost until you seen the other side. So think before you speak or blood is go leak. You shouldn’t have no problems understandin. I ain’t speakin greek. I need a hundred grand. And I ain’t talkin bout no candy bar. Take over your strip like it’s candahar. You gonna see so much red you think your man on mars. That concrete that’s under your feet gon land on hard. I got gooms that stand on guard. Post up waitin wit the toaster. Hit you from close up. Bare face. No black mask. No silencers. On the burners everybody hear da gat blast. Bodies found chopped up in black bags inside incenerators. I got power like generators. Slugs wit names on it. The message I send to haters. In my hood I’m know as a menace to neighbors. Me and my men for paper. We don’t fear the morgue. Only thing we afraid of is we scared to starve. You can’t stop the shine. Play a black cloud in my dollar signs and be a victim of a violent crime. For real. The flows is death defyin. Act real and ya neck be flyin. Brains and guts like I was savin private ryan. Test the iron. And I show you a wall, cat. That’s filled wit bodies. See where your balls at, if you all dat. And I show a wall, cat, that’s filled wit bodies. And yours could be the next. Number 19, erased out the projects. I progress everyday I’m livin this life. I won’t stop till I’m buried, dog. I’m livin it right. Just gimme the price and I’m willin to take a chance. I keep it ass hard. Cause this sh¡ª in my pants. And if you wanna dance you need to jump to these lyrics. You feelin the physical form as well as the spirit. Don’t try to compare it. Just listen and love to hear it. And if it’s fire you know not to come near it. I keep it flame broil enough to make your brains boil. Put you in a stash where nobody could say they saw you. Check, g.o.d. put it down like it’s burnin hot. Execute you on the spot no warnin shot. Comin timothy mcvay I burn down your block. First I kick in your door cause in war we don’t knock. I got no competition. Only man that could see me is the man in the mirror. Keep wishin. Keep fishin. Get a hundred and fifty stitches. Your last rights. Last meal. Last wishes. This is summin for the mix shows. They call me most honorable, most knowledgeable. Toast bottles in blue. The hydropronic goose. I spit ten words blow you to molecules. I’m under your skin cells and your hair follicles. It’s the jewel. Whatever I could see I could be. I saw hip-hop became a mc. Then I saw the streets became a og. Then I learn to see myself became g.o.d.. We get them packs off often. I’m on da block where it’s scorchin. The life that I live’ll make you nauseous. Most of our n¡ªgs see a coffin. Most of our ¨cish see abortions. Of course we are lost in the circle of karma. This is summin for the mix shows. Where you and your mama, grandmama, and great-grandmama live out the same drama. Where you and your father, father’s fathers, great and fore fathers felt horror like no tomorrow. I’m from united snakes, the country of crime. The city look ¨cish they changed the skyline. And it’s us against swine and they loosin they mind. In the van with my grind. And thirst to gimme time. I’ma ball or get signed or bang and take mine. My design’s undefined. I’m clearly one of a kind. It’s best you realize only the fittest survive. For cowards it’s suicide so don’t come outside. You don’t wanna come outside. Masquerade. Its blaques outside. Fam and prolific, we all outside. So you don’t wanna come outside. Refugee. Ay, yo we gon send this out for every street dj that ain’t getting no real radio airplay. You know I mean. That’s comin on the radio at one o’clock in da mornin. That got da streets on lock.

the pj's,"Mmmmmmmmm... yeah. [Wyclef]. (PJ's!) I was born in the PJ's. So I gotta rep for the PJ's. The elevators with the pissy hallways. Bangin on the project walls, all day. [Verse 1]. Yo if it wasn't for the PJ's y'all probably never heard of me. Y'all be like, ""Who the hell is Wyclef, and what's a Fugee?"". I'd probably be standin on a corner - watch you approach. Steal ya dope, sell ya coke, then snatch ya rope. Run for brokes with the cash and the jewels. Bows-eye, I hold my breath when I shoot. The reason you should hold ya breath; cuz most thugs. when they breathe and shoot tecs, they aim right but shoot left. Now they flesh being swept off the surface. If you ain't B.I.G., you ain't Notorious. So why ya man reckless, side-ballin like he holdin heat. Someone bring him a bed, for the permanent sleep. Weight beneath Jacob's Latter and the Aftermath. Don't matter if you use a desert eagle as your armor. Blood splatter, glass shatter through the project slums. Another one in the obituary column son. [Chorus]. (PJ's!) I was born in the PJ's. So I gotta rep for the PJ's. The elevators with the pissy hallways. Bangin on the project walls, all day. (PJ's) I gotta make noise for the PJ's. Wrote my first rhyme in the PJ's. You can hear it in my speech, I'm from the PJ's. The PJ's! PJ's. [Verse 2]. Before I was signed, I used to move on the block. All I wanted to do was rhyme, rhyme, rhyme. Line for line, I make the blind man walk in a straight line. to prison - and take a message to Shyne. Peace God from the PJ's to Ground Zero. It's a ""Hardknock Life"" but ""The Sun'll Come Out Tomorrow"". Walk with a shadow through ghettos, playin in every borough. You would think rap was rock they way I carry heavy metal. It such a shame, cocaine in ya veins, screamin. ""Team Spirit"" grippin the shottie like Kurt Cobaine. In the projects God, nuttin come easy. Gotta deal with the grimy, greasy, the sleasy. Move like a professional, young thug funeral. Wattchu thought this was another Pepsi commercial?. Nah it's the art of war, when you least expected it. Wyclef the president, the PJ's elected him. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. Yeah, and to the teachers that said I wouldn't live. and my remains would be found under the Verizano Bridge. Well I'm alive teach! So put ya theory to rest. I ain't Makaveli but I might fake my death. Make no mistake, I'm a hip-hop artist. Before the diamond in the Billboard, the hood charted it. Surburbia bought it, we bootlegged it, we couldn't afford it. Cuz in the PJ's we undergroudn like black markets. The 'P' stand for public housing. The 'R's for respect that ya get, when ya hold down ya set. The 'O's for ounces that we flip into ki's. The 'J's for the judgement handed by the ju-ry. The 'E' is for enter, at your own risk. You know the 'C' - that's for the cats that's out to get rich. And the 'T'... trust no one. And the 'S' is for the snitchers - you know the outcome.... [Chorus]"
the streets are like a jungle,"[Wyclef]. One, two.... One, two-One,two.... Yo!. [Chorus]. Hey yo! The Streets Are Like A Jungle. I'm countin' money in the jungle. Hey yo! The Streets Are Like A jungle. Guns go off in the jungle. [Wyclef - Verse One]. I tip my derby like Zorro. Ain't no such things as war heroes. Frontline planes fly by, like the sparrow (BLAOW!). My face hits the dirt, flashbacks of Vietnam. Remind me of the L.A. riots, when it was on. Fire hits the street, neon lights are bright. My tank cuts the corner, enemies take flight (That's right!). Make no mistake, you can't have this cake it took too long to bake. and you can't carry this weight, so move on. These are the words of the elders. Babysitters got caught with cocaine in a baby's diapers. Explain that, in the form of a rap. She got caught with vals, A-CRACK-A-LACK-A-LACK!!!. Now I'm upset, I get back to the projects. First one I blast was a usual suspect, a fiend. In the alley, named Ricky. Talked to a Det. rookie, gave him the info. About the paliquo, and where he gotta go. All he want in return is a Sony stereo. [Chorus 1x]. [Wyclef - Verse Two]. Hey yo my mind is my business so I'm.... Minding my own, in the club 'til this girl said,. ""Let me see your telephone"". I passed her my celly. She called her girl Mary. And said that she just broke up with her nigga out in D.C.. She needs a new honey, in the city she gets lonely. I finally figured out her man's locked up in a penatentary. So tell me, what should I do when she gets off the phone?. The devil said, ""Clef, take her ass home!"". God says, ""Repect her, her man's in the pen"". This kid pushed me from behind, ""Yo, why you fuckin' with my woman?!!!"". Then his girl looked at me, she winked! I blinked!. Now he's coming up to me with the gorilla instinct. Aww, cool-n-shit! I'm sittin' here eatin' shrimp. Besides, I would hate for you to be a missing link. He said, ""Son, do you know who I am?! I'm no man, but one man. who? The son of Sam!"". I said you've got this wrong, I never sung your girl a love song. He drew for his weapon, there's no more conversation. Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock! He released!. then breathe, His aim went off balance. The music got tense. That's when I knew I was in trouble! The street is like a jungle!. I jumped behind the bar, but caught two in the ankle! POW! (Echo)"

So who better to know about a nine-to-five. Wakin' up at five with the cold in my eyes. Now my daddy, he can rest in peace. From the belly of the beast to the sunniest beach, let's go. Three nights in Rio De Janeiro with no sounds of buses. No ambulance, no police sirens to interrupt my silence, aha ? dinero. Means I work hard and have a warm day. Playin' my guitar, used to daydream at the stars. Prayin' if I ever make it, I'm gon' help my family make it. From the streets of Brooklyn, to the Jersey ? ?.

to all the girls,"[Intro:]. Yo, Wyclef, It's time that I confess (Refugee Camp) to all the girls. (Don't do it, don't do it). [singing] To all the girls I loved before. [rapping] To all the girls I cheated on before. [singing] To all the girls I loved before. [Verse 1]. To all the girls I cheated on before, I tip my hat like Willie Nelson. You got pressure, take a sip of this Molson. Here's what happened, it wasn't my intentions. To fall into seduction while playing a temptation. I thought I had it figured out, but games don't last. The hourglass ran out, I got sprayed with the tear gas. Big men don't cry, hold my feelings inside. Stress brings me ?, I gotta hold my pride. When I see you with another guy, jealous thoughts of homicide. Call me selfish when I say Abraham has many wives. You say this is the 90's, either it's gonna be me or her. I found myself in a blur. Lookin' into the clouds thinkin' out loud. ""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?"". [Chorus:]. To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year. I got a new change of gear, I swear. I can see clear now the clouds disappeared. You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh. To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year. I got a new change of gear, I swear. I can see clear now the clouds disappeared. You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho. [Verse 2:]. Second verse is gonna hurt, based on a true life story. I got married at 24 in New Jersey. You know the feelings start nature take it's course. Two years later 'Clef gets a divorce. When I had the cold feet, I shouldn't've walked the altar. With Dionne Warwick, she could predict my future. Went with my feelings even though it wasn't right. Creepin' with my secret lover in the middle of the night. Back home, break of dawn, dinner's at the table. Thin Line Between Love And Hate is on cable. I'm lookin' at myself thinkin' out loud. ""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?"". [Repeat chorus]. [Break: (includes elements from Rapper's Delight)]. Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though). And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you take her friend. Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though). And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you snatch her friend. [Break it down right here]. [Verse 3:]. One love, you're lucky to have one love. It sounds bugged, drinking wine from the same jug. One heart, one mind, one soul. She ain't a gold digger, she don't care about your bank-roll. Keep your money, she make her own cheddar. All she want from me is respect like Aretha. Cooked me lasagne, stayed in for the winter. Chilled to the summer, now I'm gone 'til November. Have you seen her?. I think I did. But what I did wrong was take a love for granted. Cause first comes trust, don't rush into lust. Easier said than done, I lust and I must. Passion is a must, but then we start to cuss. We was just makin' love, now we tearing up each other's guts. Like species, she called me an animal. So feel the tongue of the warm-blooded mammal. [Repeat chorus]. [Outro:]. I'm not a ho [repeat and dimminuendo at the same time]. (You don't believe me though). I know you're diggin' this. Is it OK if I play my guitar right about now, is it alright?. (You don't believe me though). Alright (you don't believe me though), alright. People in the back, is it OK if I play my guitar right about now?. Alright, alright, alright, alright. People on the side, is it OK if I play my guitar right about now?"

Verse 1:Unsure of what the balance held. i touched my belly overwhelmed. by what i had been chosen to perform. but then an angel came one day. and told me to kneel down and pray. for unto me a manchild would be born. woe this crazy circumstance. i knew his life deserved a chance. but everybody told me to be smart.

war no more,"Light is in the air right now. Two thousand and two rebel music. The saga continues. Listen, children. What's the problem in Manhattan. Every ten men they look like Bin Laden. So I have problems when I go to the airport. First thing they do they wanna ask me for my passport. The said Wyclef we love the Fugees the score. But did anybody give you any strange package to bring on board. I was like 'no'. Here comes your national guards. This look like a scene from the movie Star Wars. One foot in, one foot out standing in the airplane. I'm on tour. I'm on my way to Japan. First class, dark shades. Let the fuschia out bed. I want to sleep but keep my eyes on the cock pit. Why just think they stay target- the pilot. We gonna take over the plane. Like the Los Angeles riot. Riot. Riot. The Middle East. The Middle East. The street pack more heat than the Middle East.

what a night,"[Intro: Wyclef]. It's funny how the Earth rotates, man you never know what's. going to happen, ya know mean?. All I said was ""Aiight, I got this chiki bang bang dang da dang"". Then it all got it started for me, man. Yo, man I'm just getting back from the tour, man. What it be like, man?. Yo, bust it, turn me up. Somebody told me if you can make in New York City, man, you can. make it anywhere else, man. Somehow I believe that shhhh. [Chorus] (Wyclef). Oh, what a night. Late December, 1993 (what happened?). Who thought he would rule the industry?. What an MC on the grind. [Wyclef]. Yo, I ain't always have whips, I ain't always have yachts. I ain't always have chips, I ain't always have rocks. Matta fact I was a grimey little negro. Who said if music didn't work, I'd sell diesel. What cha'll thought, I wasn't raised in the projects?. First of the month waitin for that PA check. Lived on the first floor. Were so poor that if you rung the buzzer the roaches would answer the door (who is it?). I went from boy to man in one night. When I saw my life flash like light from poltergeist. What made it worse, I couldn't speak English. But from his facial expressions, he wanted my Adidas. So hurry up and come out and play. I'll be damned if I leave bare-footed in this hallway. And I got big plans, so beg your pardon. Cause next year this time I'ma sell out the Garden. [Chorus]. [Wyclef]. Yo, yo, I ain't gonna brag and boast and say I did it all. But I'm the only rapper to play Carnegie Hall. The first rap group, video cost a million. First rapper to ever rep for the Haitians. And sa fa say, na boolay. Grammy night, we took 3 away. 22 million sold, I can't believe this. There's still ain't a rapper alive who could achieve this. But I ain't satisfied, when back to my home contemplating. How could I become the next Quincy Jones?. That's when Jerry hit me up on the horn and said. ""Clef, your on the cover of. the cover of The Source by The Rolling Stones"". No more struggling, good life we loving it. You could live it too, if you only publish it. So here we go, so what's the scenario?. I own so many cars that I'm renting 'em for videos. [Chorus]"
what about the baby,"[Intro: Wyclef Jean]. I want to apologize for makin you wait so long for the sequel. Wyclef, Mary J., this one called What About the Baby. You ever been like. [Verse One: Wyclef]. Let me talk to my daughter. Daughter this is your poppa. I know it's been a while. We haven't talked. [Mary J. Blige]. But daddy you've been gone. And me and mom have been all alone. It's been a struggle and you weren't there for us. He say. [Wyclef Jean]. Okay, when I called you. She wouldn't put you on the phone. She call the police, restrainin order. 50 feet, from my home. I tried, I ain't lyin. It's so sad that the heavens cryin, AYY~!. Once a boy and twice a man. I'm just tryin to do the best I can. Give me a chance girl. [Chorus: Wyclef]. A grown man ain't supposed to cry. So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice. Everything gon' be alright. Baby girl I'm by your side, dry your eyes. [Verse Two: Mary J. Blige]. Let's talk this over. Now see I heard everything that you told her. But it's gon' take more than words. for you to be a father, uh-huh. Responsibilities of a man. Like stayin faithful just for the fam'. What if she knew that you chose. another over her mother, aowwww!. So you called her. and I wouldn't put her on the phone. I called the police yes, restrainin order. 50 feet, from my home. I tried, I ain't lyin. It's so sad that the heavens are cryin, yeahhh. Once a girl, twice of a man. And I'ma try to do the best I can. I can't give you a chance noooo. [Chorus: Blige]. A woman ain't supposed to cry. So why don't you just wipe your eyes, dry your eyes. You've learned a house is not a home. When you're living all alone, and you want back home. [Verse Three: Wyclef]. WAIT A MINUTE GIRL! You're my joy, happiness that you bring. Turn the fall back to spring girl, you're my bling. You a hip-hop song I heard for the first time time. Studied all the words to the rhyme. You're my life, without you there's no sun, there's no moon. There's no stars, shinin in the ni-iight. [Mary J. Blige]. But if I give you a chance, would you show me you care. Be a man, no matter what the circumstances. AHOW~!. [Chorus: Wyclef]. A grown man ain't supposed to cry. So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice. [Blige]. You've learned a house is not a home. When you're living all alone, and you want back home. [Chorus: Wyclef]. A grown man ain't supposed to cry. So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice. (What about the baby~! What about the baby~!). Everything gon' be alright. Baby girl I'm by your side, I apologize!. I cry, and I cry, I cry. {*fades out*}"
what's clef,"Wyclef Jean feat. Queen Pen, The Product, & Naomi Campbell. . [Phone Rings]. [Phone Voice Sample]. If you'd like to make a call, dial your operator. If you need help, try, try again. Try, try again. [Wyclef Jean]. I got it started to my face. I got it started to my face, right?. What you thought, there wasn't gonna be no retaliation?. Ha, ha, ha. You gotta be kiddin'!. You call my name four times on a record?. Heh, heh!. [Phone Rings]. [Phone Voice Sample]. If you need help, try, try again. Try again. [Wyclef Jean]. Yo, ""Return of Jack the Ripper,"" what? Nigga please. I'ma push you further back than your hairline recedes. New York City, don't get it confused. Your song will last as long as your part in ""Krush Groove"". Body moves, the battles, bullets, the lesson. You write about being a veteran, but not a legend. Back from the war with thirty-two medals of honor. You claimin' underground but never been to Bobbito the Barber. Gimme them medals back, since you forgot how to rap. Call DJ Bobcat and ask him where them old records at. Like Channel Five karate, my kick is gonna reach ya. A new episode where the student kills the teacher. Any last words before I send you to your dream?. Hold my hands and pray. [lyrics in Creole]. You don't got knowledge yourself. So you don't know what that mean, a'ight?. Who suped you up to do the record in the first place?. It lacked taste, you get ""The Gas Face"" like 3rd Bass. L.L. stands for Lickin' Lyor, or Lickin' Lichty. Lickin' Lyles, Lickin' Labels, lickin' they balls. Under the conference room table. When you hear this record, you bound to go AWOL. I worked too hard, for this life is serious. This ain't bulls-eye, I ain't your target practice. So call Mr. Martin, I rarely kill often. But in this sound clash, I got a bodybuilder's coffin. Back from Miami where your record got no heat. That's why your Def Jam interns call it ""Battle of the Beats"". You're weak nigga!. [Phone Rings]. [Phone Voice Sample]. If you need help, try, try again. Try again. [Wyclef Jean]. Yo, this my question. [The Product]. What's your question?. [Chorus]. What's Clef got to do with this, got to do with this?. What's Clef?. I'm not a Bob Marley impostor. What's Clef got to do with this, got to do with this?. Tell your ghost writers, ""Go write something better"". [Phone Rings]. [Phone Voice Sample]. If you need help, try, try again. Try again. [Wyclef Jean]. Guess who? Uh-oh, uh-oh. Here we go-o, uh-oh. Every two records you do scenario. You get the best MCs, how? To rhyme first. Of course you rap last, so you can show off your skirt. I guess it didn't work on ""4 3 2 1"". You got out done by Canibus the young gun. Your last weapon, is to call out Wyclef Jean. Not knowing that you callin' fire for your cremation. Jammin' and cool, sumpthin' like you. Jamaicans say, ""L.L. a fool"". Kids wet too who do the pool. Let bells ring like Sunday school. L.L. Cool J is hard as hell?. So hard at night he's Jezebel. I heard the teller, Himmemel. How you think he wrote the song?. Rock the bells!. [The Product]. Yo, Clef. I know you got styles, but get back to the issue kid. This is real!. [Wyclef Jean]. Yo, don't get me angry, like the Hulk, I'll turn green. Your marriage is a cover up, 'cause you use Vaseline. Fun love of hip-hop, these lyrics got you steamed. Knowing damn well that bad men don't wear g-strings. Another side of Clef, the face you won't seein' oppressed. I even got the Devil worshippers sayin', ""God bless"". You star struck, and I'ma buck you like Carlito. And when they say, ""Who did it?,"" you tell them Benny Blanco. Wyclef, preacher's son, check the revelation. Polygram buy Def Jam for twenty million. MCA buy Polygram for eleven billion. I come to Sony and get pimped by the Haitian-Sicilians. And I'll even, get you an ad in ""The Source"". You'll be the first rapper selling products for hair loss. The W-Y-C-L-E-F, Wyclef. The return of Jack the Ripper was only to meet his death. The next time, you wanna dis me for kicks. Get off my dick, go somewhere and lick your lips, bitch!. [Phone Rings]. [Phone Voice Sample]. If you need help, try, try again. Try again. [The Product]. Rest in peace!. [Chorus]. What's Clef got to do with this, got to do with this?. What's Clef?. I'm not a muscle man impostor. What's Clef got to do with this, got to do with this?. Watch what you ask for, 'cause you just might get it. [Naomi Campbell]. Yo, this is Naomi Campbell chillin' with Wyclef. I just wanna tell you L.L., your record is wack. L.L., why don't you just give up?. [Phone Rings]. [Phone Voice Sample]. If you need help, try, try again. Try again. If you need help, try, try again. Try, try again"

This aint a sequel son, but I have you ""Scream 2"" [AHHH!]. Real live cinema of the streets produced a junkie. Put back on your shirt man you lookin like ET. You're cracked out, for dough, some blow on saxophone. You're rhymin off beat even with help from my metronomes. See, y'all aint MCs, you a CM. Common Motherfucker rhymin about Lexus and Benz. The same Benz you got jacked in, drunk off of Gin. You woke up in hell gettin sexed by Marilyn Manson. You lie, you deny, pass me the microphone. I guess like Eddie Murphy you was givin 'em a ride home. Yeah right, 25 mics, material in The Source. While your rap crew's on steroids lookin like Full Force. Your girl she's buffed, puffed, in daytime don't play rough. The freaks come out at night so that's when I bring out the cuffs. Grandma yell, CD player number two. Shadae's in my bedroom singin ""sweetest taboo"". [HOOK]. [Verse 2]. We used to rap, now y'all wanna come and get me with a bat?. Y'all must be smokin crack, with Pookie from New Jack. How could y'all forget, I'm the reason y'all MC. But y'all flip like Pharisees and charge me for blasphemy. You know who you are, eight bar superstar. Karate cars, buy up the bars with the credit cards. You wanna impress, I'm young chick, you just met. First thing she say, ""I used to run with Wyclef"". Look surprised, see your flesh outside your vest. Yeah you could fight, in the WWF. Cuz in this arena aint nothin but gladiators and haters. Hopin they kill me and roll and feed me to the tigers. Oh Lord, protect me from the devil. They open the book of life, y'all readin like the anti christ. Your weak kid, stop lyin to the public. You wanted it so bad that you took all the production credits. Some MCs in the underground, mad at me cuz I'm above ground. Counting English pounds. I tell ya what, success don't come overnight. I was in Noah's Ark for Forty days and Forty nights. Contemplatin what should I write, what should I recite. Cuz aint nobody here but thugs and chicks wit ice. That's when I daydream into the twilight. Girls wit they man, screamin ""I hate life"". Baby girl look in the opposite direction. Cuz my class is the *Misedu...*. [HOOK]"

It's okay, as long as Wyclef is with me. (North Side, Jamaican, Caribbeanon, Haitian. hands in the air, everybody, hey!). My love is your dubbing, your dub is my dub. It will take eternity to break us. And the change of our start: (LISTEN TO ME!). :as myself is yourself. Cause the Refugee sound is the only sound. It will take eternity to break us. And a million sound boys will die before us. [Wyclef Jean]. This for the hardcore, before I had the record deal youknowhatI'msayin?. I'ma take y'all back when I was walking down the street. My little girl saying: Yo Clef, that nigga trying to stick with something. Walk over to him and said: Yo.."

words of wisdom,"[Wyclef:]. Hello, boys and girls.. Welcome, to Wyclef Words of Wisdom.. Have you ever been sitting in your. house at two o'clock in the morning. and you get a mysterious phone. call from a girl that you don't know?. (A female begins talking sexy). Now, hold on, think with your mind. and not with your pistol.. Cause if you invite her over. this is what might happen:. Rape! Rape!. Rape! Rape!. Rape! Rape!. (What the... Yo, yo, yo...shit!). Rape! Rape!. Rape! Rape!. Rape! Rape!. [Cop:] Freeze! Put your hands in the air!. [Wyclef:] Officer, you don't understand.. She called me. I was sleeping.. I was minding my business.. [Cop:] I don't give a flying fuck. about two bits about a piss.. You're fuckin' guilty.. (Yes, yes). [Wyclef:] Nobody's protected."
year of the dragon,"(feat. Lauryn Hill). . . [Intro:]. [sirens] Yo yes yes yo. Lock your door. Die die die [x6]. [Wyclef:]. I remember comin' from Hati growin' up in Brooklyn. On Flat Bush got my first sneakers tooken. Learn the game quick so I got my first device. Mom move to Jersey so we could get a better life. But little did she know a ghetto is a ghetto. Good time found myself like Jimmy Walker sayin' ""Cello"". [Lauryn:]. Yellow cheese bus gettin' beatings if I cuss. Lay away another day in stripped Lees and letegrays. But the lyrical bomber momma tried to stop. Paranoid cause this boy around my neighborhood got shot. Name plate hair straight metal braces on my teeth. Fat laces on my feet when crack first hits the streets. [Wyclef:]. I use to push up on a girl Salt 'N' Peppa Push It Push It. D's in school cause the music was my focus. Jokes in class but when I learned I didn't pass. I knew it was my ass with my mothers leather lash. Belt buckle said Nelly Nel similar to Melle Mel. Hits the third rail Beat Street made Gazzels sells. [Lauryn:]. As the tale gets poetic watch the streets turn magnetic. Towanna Balley's rape is alleged. Hang out in hooky places watch streets corners turn to oasis. Young men aspire to be Scarfaces. [Hook:]. In the year of the dragon lots of men disappear. Quiet as it's kept they won't be around next year. [Wyclef talking:]. Yo yo watch out for the black van. Yo yo (last days last days) planes. exploding yo close your door yo nobody's safe. Halloween. October 31. Yo. close your. door yo kids are disappearing. Yo. [Wyclef:]. Late at night the light was bright on the ave. I went to pick up cash from my cousin little Kev. He told me Joe had a dream in jail he got steamed. His wife became a fiend fuckin' little Raheim. Damn, drugs will make you do terrible things. He told me when he get out he's murdering by any means. The day came I saw him on the train. He pulled his gun and aimed and started firing like the son of Kane. I saw civilians runnin' for their life. Like the devil on judgement night running from Christ. Ice and Armarretto please as I fell to my knees. Being shot by Fergusin the vigilante. [Hook]. [Wyclef talking:]. So CNN nawhatI'msayin? Fergusin is at court and he's his own lawyer. youknowmean what's goin' on. Talk to me. This is definatly the last days.. Jewish calendar has already arrived the year 2000. Watch ya back watch ya. back watch ya back DIE DIE DIE DIE. [Lauryn:]. Clef it kind of remind me of this chick I once knew. Use to be a dime now she's strung out in Bellevue. See the serpent played tricks run game like the Knicks. Build you up just to lose the championship.. I seen her reminisce over Wu-Tang could It Be that Simple. She lost her Prince cause there were Thieves In the Temple. Tragic depression made her lose all her teeth. Lost and turned out gave her body to the streets. Sweet Mary don't you weep. Still water runs deep. So be carful of the company you keep. [Hook]. [Wyclef talking:]. Yo I'm frustrated youknowhatI'mean? Use to work at McDonalds just got. fired.. If I get in I'm sprayin' everybody the boss the manager yo these are. definatly the last days. Yo here he comes with his gun yo duck duck. Black. Panther yo nobody's protected. Yo 6-6-6 watch your back don't get caught in. the rapture yo AIDS, Moses the plaque watch your back. Pharoh let my people. go.. Yo watch your back. Last days. Last days. Nobody's protected. Yo my little. sister is Rosey Sharen. Yo yo nobody's protected. Not even Rosey Sharen.. Nobody's protected. Yo you come try to get my sister I'm a get you first.. I'm a be driving a hearse. Cause nobody's protected."
