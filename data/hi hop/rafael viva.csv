"bad poets (feat. n. dre, eevo)","Ain't nobody tellin' me what to do. aint no one is gonna come. til' I find another clue. cause aint nothing gonna stop me saying. when I wanna move. aint nobody is gonna party. till I say get in it too. Music industry is full of posers. no composers. All they want is fame. and say they diverge from us. But in reality they don't even know. how to make a stupid song. or how to write a note. Aint that bad right? You make up with style?. No you no brain dummies. you cant even make a rhyme. And when someone criticizes you,. you take it like a crime. You need to stop being a bitch. going to your corner and cry. I swear to god this no brain singers. are making me sick. With their sensless lyrics. talking about how life is a btch. How they want to quit. How we cant see it and all of that shit. Well I guess maybe I should be the one to quit. Ain't nobody tellin' me what to do. aint no one is gonna come. til' I find another clue. cause aint nothing gonna stop me saying. when I wanna move. aint nobody is gonna party. till I say get in it too. Stepping up in the game for the first time. And most of you prolly hope. is my last time. As I'm gonna beat you all in your own game. in no time. You prolly just think I'm a really good mime. But no, I'm just here for show. To show you clowns how to make a stupid song. And I've been in the game for a few moments. And you've been the game for hmm how long?. You know what, I doesn't even matter how long. What matters is that you rappers. got it all wrong. You make music with no sense only rhymes. Good music only comes out from time to time. You talk about your drug addictions. like its yo life. And all the hoes that you slept with last night. Boy, what would your parents say to you. They prolly don't even know. what you have been up too. But I mean is that all you say even true. I'm sure that people. never even heard of you. You can't get away with a beat and autotune. Shut up and go back to your cave will you coon?. Uhh I'm about to kill somebody soon. Uhh man check out my fire toon. Uhh get high and travel to the moon. Uhh let's go home and get drunk at high noon. Ain't nobody tellin' me what to do. aint no one is gonna come. til' I find another clue. cause aint nothing gonna stop me saying. when I wanna move. aint nobody is gonna party till I say get in it too"
dream,"Oh no I'm not alone. Just felt another strok'. Ain't gonna sleep tonight. This ghost is in my mind. My head is on the moon. I still ear the low ""hoo"". Common some call this night. Abandoned hearted crime. Stop. Some of'them just said. that the tales never ever happen. Stop. Cause the world knows that tales. never ever fought it. Stop. But when the moment come to you. you will never know what's part in. Stop. Cause when you dream s. ome come and go like you never ever locked it. My life is kinda dark, I hear some voices talk. But no one knows what is, I feel it come to me. My eyes are on the moon, my heart has come to you. I still can hear my brain. just talkin in a loop. Common and tell me lies. I'm here just laying tight. I know I'm not alone. I hear somebody talk. Just sit and ear a bit. You'll know I'm not a sick. My heart is tellin tales. Come heat it with a lit. Oh no I'm not alone. Just felt another strok'. Ain't gonna sleep tonight. This ghost is in my mind. Oh no I'm not alone. Just felt another strok'. Ain't gonna sleep tonight. This ghost is in my mind"
heartbeat,No more flirt after some days. No more feels upon the shades. I keep yelling heartbeat sound. Rising love on the streets ground. Buying pills until I die. By the dreams I felt denied. All alone just passing by. All the days I've been so kind. No I don't need no more time. Just to know how I survived. Without hearing heartbeat sound. Bleeding love for the all town. Babe I know just how time. As come and flowed for life's. But I'm killing my soft bound. Waiting love and heartbeat sound. And I know I can rise you more. Just to get up in the floor. I'd rather feel this way. Than to die and feel the pain. No I don't need no more time. Just to know how I survived. Without hearing heartbeat sound. Bleeding love for the all town. . Babe I know just how time. As come and flowed for life's. But I'm killing my soft bound. Waiting love and heartbeat sound. I got wasted. By this pretty. And felt it touch the ground. With my bleeding heartbeat sound. Babe I know just how time. As come and flowed for life's. But I'm killing my soft bound. Waiting love and heartbeat sound
