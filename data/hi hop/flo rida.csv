Off of the porch where they think about paper. Don't need to fuck when I eat with the majors. Passport says I get rent in Malaysia. All over Asia, cuz my.... Mind on my money,. Money on my mind,. Trying to stack paper,. Counting every little dime,. Down to the penny. Holla if ya hear me,. I do it for the streets ya,. I do it for my city,. You know you gotta love it, ay ay.

thinking of you,"But it hurts to think you're somewhere on a search for me.. I'm right here with no words to speak. Daydreaming about what could never be.. It will never be.. But I wonder. Do you think of me. Do you think of me. Cause I'm thinking of.. All I wanted was to keep this love alive (yeah). And all I wanted was to be there by your side.. (yeah yeah). I know better than to keep on telling lies. Should have swallowed my pride. But I think sometimes that. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. But it hurts to think. You're somewhere on a search for me. I'm right here with no words to speak. Daydreaming about what could never be. It will never be. But I wonder. Do you think of me. Do you think of me. Cause I'm thinking of you. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. I think it's best that we let it go. No stress than the mess we was headed for. Cause only trouble had vision in the telescope. A peace of mind better than mission impossible. Who want a possible. I take a bird in the hand if it's toucan. But two can't play the star in a new band. Rockin wit you get it poppin with you. When da gossip hit you I don't wanna say. I shoulda coulda woulda would. Any nigga in his right mind wanna keep a grudge. Deadly flow kid you ain't never seen a dove. Dancing over trouble what it's papas daughter. Rolling stones she can't hide in a louis clutch. The bigger man when I look back at it pretty much. Another chance at it pass on it like a bud. Just hit the gas on it man shortly to the club. I think it's best it was best that we split up. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. But it hurts to think. You're somewhere on a search for me. I'm right here with no words to speak. Daydreaming about what could never be. It will never be. But I wonder. Do you think of me. Do you think of me. Cause I'm thinking of you. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. And, all I ever wanted was a good girl. Good girls come within I got a tell a little girl. Shawty lil mama let's try to save the drama. I know I ain't a saint but still believe in comma. I'm gon try to get my shit together. Oh yeah I know it's misery. So what the hell I tell her. Hello good morning. I was out with my homie for his birthday. But that excuse had neva had me comin home late. You straight im straight I don't want to deal with it. Yeah she told me that a couple times ima live with it. No yo let me know I might come visit. That's when you know you got the rope around your neck. Pitchin, scratching, choking whatever. Hangin from the tree the next time I know better. Face tattooed on me should of got letters. Dead to her face if I could I'll tell her. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. But it hurts to think. You're somewhere on a search for me. I'm right here with no words to speak. Daydreaming about what could never be. It will never be. But I wonder. Do you think of me. Do you think of me. Cause I'm thinking of you. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go"

all my life,"[Chorus:]. All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on. All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on. The hood never caused but they all was hard. His kind never represented love at all. Purple hearts in the hood, them ghetto scars. Where every time I see my daddy it was just a mirage. Now my mammy need a mechanic when the car wouldn't start. I couldn't understand it, even told it to god. Now my family in jeans, headed straight to the top. Access granted with this empty can of starch. No not the [?] liquor store got robbed. Yellow tape was the moon every night on the block. Surrounded by the stars them dirty cars. Dreadlocks in the grill try to camouflage. Gotta make it out for real for I be at large. I wrote XXL in the view of my squad. Got a record on the shelf they say I'm good at the mall. Gotta learn to help myself no sugar to borrow. Cause.... All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on. All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on. A four course meal every first of the month. Everybody in the projects family home. Don't know you till the DJ like I want some. But before thanksgiving, was a catholic nun. Crabs in the bucket dirty 11 to 1. Without the struggle probably never woulda heard of lebron. Try and juggle in the casket with ya sister lavonne. Suicide, live lavish at the tip of my tongue. Only thing come to ratchet was the 23rd song. Yeah it coulda been tragic for the boy from the scums. Yeah he got the craftmatic no rest till I won. Life took a stab at him couldn't punch him alone. Born near the savages kinda made me numb. Two doors from where the dope boi magic was slung. It was real not a fancy, they'd kill ya for crumbs. Only reason why I rap, keep from being a bum. Cause.... All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on. All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on. Sitting here, reminiscing,. Of all the nights I had to grind. Taking chances with the system,. I put my whole life on the line. All my life know it ain't been sweet. All my life I been in the streets. All my life up against concrete. All my life mama gave me the speech. All my life somebody died every week. All my life ducking the police. All my life without soda I weeped. All my life no first class seats. All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on. All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on"

finally here,"(Chorus). Hard to follow my dreams workin this 9 to 5. People keep tellin me my check is on the way. So sun up to sundown I’m grindin, tryin to make it by. Prayin for my shift to come and take away the pain. That day is finally here (x3). New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain,. new wrist, knew that, knew this, finally here. That day is finally here (x2). New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain. New wrist, knew that, knew this. (Verse 1). No, no I won’t settle for nothing less than the air that I breathe. I-I-I know it’s a struggle, but who the hell g’on do it for me. Who the hell g’on do it free. If I don’t get up and bust my ass, that’s my motto. I can’t put my faith in the lotto, luck don’t stay nowhere near where I go. Unless you ride that muthafucka. And you be lucky enough to get away, in the grave. What can I do, what can I say, I tried to get paid. But I got grazed, the bullet went through. But I ain’t get paid,. Now what do I appreciate? My J-O-B. Hey boss, I’m comin in late. (Chorus). (Verse 2). Lil cousin got it right? and bike without no frame, ride the same rides without no brain?. Life ain’t life, without no shame, if I make it out the hood, damn right I’m gon change. My cell phone number. But the area code still gon be 305 tho. My friends who was my friends just like my kin. Walked em in model?. But please wipe your feet on the rug. You can keep your shoes on, it’s all love. Boy let me stop, im dreamin too much, now who the hell. ?Gon give up a million bucks. Nobody but God, right now I could use me one of them black cards. I’m scarred, I fell apart, I came here with stars, its hard huh?. (Chorus). (Verse 3). F-F-F-Findin me. That day I been tryin to reach, that pay I been diein to see. Boy them folk wouldn’t lie to me. I thought money ain’t grow on trees. Depends on the roots, how you plant that seed. They quit, you can’t see no leaves. Hold up, I need my versace’s. Grace covers of magazines, my mother she proud of me. Myself, I, the one who the haters thought wasn’t gon be shit. Big yachts, every day I get seasick, I was broke, the prefix. My book say “Why yall gave that nigga some cash?”. I wrote a song about it, wanna hear it? here it goes"

And a lil' penetration. Give it to you like you never had it before. And you ain't never gon' think about his ass again. Lips, hips, eyes, thighs. Here I'm gon' have to give that ass a ten. And they can get a five. Even though one of them kinda fine. But ain't none of them got nothin' on you, you. So let's go somewhere to dine. And sip some expensive wine. Later on tell me what we gon' do, do. We gon' bump and we gon' grind. So good it should be a crime. And next time tell your friends to come too, too. I know you got a man, man, man. But tell me what your man, man, man. Got to do with me, me, me. (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh). Got to do with me, me, me. (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh). I know you got a girl, girl, girl.

I know that love comes once in a lifetime. Love comes once in a lifetime. She was the neighborhood dream girl. Can look, but don't touch. They all wanna know us. If it ain't with me, then it can't be no one. When the groupies came to the show. When the money started to grow. You stayed down, don't play around. Look at this girl we made now. Been around the world and I came right back for your love. Forgive me for the days and nights I was cutting up. Wanted the motions in the ocean. And emotions covered up. From flashing lights in the club to magazine covered up. Fly you to Miami and cop you floor seats. And you would always tell me your heart was for me. Way before the models ripped the runway. It was us, drop-tops, speeding down the runway. So let's go. I want you to know that you're special. I'll never compare you to no one. Baby, cause I know that your love comes. Once in a lifetime.

When they started feeling the flow. Them girls trouble. Come more than a lifetime. And time don't wait for no one. I'm out here like I throw ones. and they dance for me. My man he warn me how my come-up might just cancel me. Now I gotta go fix that, get that, hit that. He flip that in that like I used to be big D-A-D-D-Y. I'm so special, she can't have another dude that woo her. I got my Bugatti, but that just pickup [?] her. That sears these years on lairs get weird. My fear is tears that smears and make-up. Don't ever make up, you better wake up. So let's go. I want you to know that you're special. I'll never compare you to no one. Baby, cause I know that your love comes. Once in a lifetime. Let's go back, I'm without you. I know that love comes once in a lifetime. Love comes once in a lifetime. Let's go back, I'm without you. I know that love comes once in a lifetime.

That’s because of my roots (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeeeaaahh). I’m talking’ bout roots (Yeah, Yeah, Yeeeaaahh). I’m talking bout roots. Verse 1. Hey I can’t be mad at what ya’ll meet ahead. I don’t regret my ghetto struggle due to my success. It ain’t that beautiful to write on overcoming stress. Top Ramen noodles thank pappy for the fact I was fed. Look at me now but all before hey Mr. Skid Row. The dirty south ain’t just a name the way I’ve been poor. The projects burnin’ white, I call it gizmo. Went from a gun to them cars in a Jigga video. Can’t find a meal to a mil, only God know it. No record deal to a deal, I work hard for it. Can I live to I’m livin’ like my Momma told it. Before you rip it, gotta sew it. Yeah. Chorus.

Somebody had to be just to get away. My sister had to leave, I respect her stayin safe. Oh yea I had to grieve but I’m stronger to this day. Pain, I can’t ignore it, you might say I’m ignorant. I’m mistakin’ for courage, which victory so gorgeous. Make it through two Bush, I can make it through any forest. Hunger gave me the wish, but the bottom is so important. 37 ave and 187 street, Miami (Karat city), now I’m part of a legacy. I’m thankful for the hood, what is love without jealousy. There’s only five letters really help me. Chorus. I’m talking’ bout roots. I can’t hate where I’m from. Cause where I’m from made me (Cause where I’m from made me). I came from the bottom of the slums. But now I got me...me. That’s because of my roots (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeeeaaahh). I’m talking’ bout roots (Yeah, Yeah, Yeeeaaahh). I’m talking bout roots. Verse 3. Hey I know the seeds been planted. It’s damaging my soul but my dreams been granted. That triple life towards, much deeper than nurse planet. What could I want more than redoing I never planned it. Gets no lower than a grabbin’ on your feet. A man will stand for nothin’if he fall off with the feet. A baller and a hitter all in the street. If you look beneath the sand then we all need a crease. Roots before the branches, roots before mansions. Roots before your paper crazier than Marilyn Manson. Roots with your grandparents, roots under your canvas. Roots whether you black, white, or Spanish. Chorus. I’m talking’ bout roots. I can’t hate where I’m from. Cause where I’m from made me (Cause where I’m from made me).

rewind (feat. wyclef jean),"If you love somebody. Put a light in the air. From the hood to the stakes. Fry your finger in the air. Flo Rida up in here. Wyclef up in here. If I could I would pull it up and rewind. To the time when it was just me and you. Oh how we were inseparable. If I could I'd pull it up and rewind. To the time before you went away. Wish I could go back to yesterday. If I could I'd pull it up and rewind. I try sticking to the rivers that I'm used to. But these tears got me searching for an inner tube. Witness my homies life shorter than my inner lose. Don't wanna drown in my hurt cause it's critical. I pop champagne, but still it's a damn pain. Beedee I love you my sister died but it never changed. My last love that we just ditched in my brain. Give up the fortune and the fame to hear you say my name. The ghetto rough while the doff try purple rain. Lord knows I wish death never had a name. Our last breath that it never had a relevate. Wyclef, Flo Rida here to tell it man. To the left, move, hurt for suffering. I lose myself when I think about my people's slain. If I could I'd rewind this whole thing. If I could I would pull it up and rewind. To the time when it was just me and you. Oh how we were inseparable. If I could I'd pull it up and rewind. To the time before you went away. Wish I could go back to yesterday. If I could I'd pull it up and rewind. So I sit down and I had try. Are you living up in this life?. I know if I could I'd pull it up and rewind. If I could take yesterday and place it in my palms. I anticipate the day like a school prom. Promise tomorrow what you think till you lose some. Big will I know heaven got the futon. Face good with the man paid your dues done. Wack your shows in Japan with me getting drunk. We had plans, plans change the new sun. The lord never leave us lonely when you lose one. If I could change the past, my people wouldn't past. I wish life was Tivo and you could bring it back. I wish it all was remote and how the day be said. I were Ip use it like its pixel flap. Pull up the hood times, pull up the good times. Everyday be forever when I'm puttin down. Showing off that's the truth nah. If I could I would pull it up and rewind. To the time when it was just me and you. Oh how we were inseparable. If I could I'd pull it up and rewind. To the time before you went away. Wish I could go back to yesterday. If I could I'd pull it up and rewind. So I sit down and I had try. Are you living up in this life?. I know if I could I'd pull it up and rewind. If I had the gift be here I'd cure your mom from cancer. Take the Breena and stuck em up all with answers. Take the crack feen turn her into the prom queen. Have her graduate suma ku la day. But she so high that she's riding on drug assist. Growing up like the women from the exorcist. Her heart stopped in the ambulance. If I could I would pull it up and rewind. To the time when it was just me and you. Oh how we were inseparable. If I could I'd pull it up and rewind. To the time before you went away. Wish I could go back to yesterday. If I could I'd pull it up and rewind. So I sit down and I had try. Are you living up in this life?. I know if I could I'd pull it up and rewind"

A hoe is good for diggin',. I shoulda know this from the beginnin'.. I don' got caught slippin' now. I'm trippin out the door somebody else found interest.. Throw my hoe until I found out until I find out different.. Better to know then have intuitions.. Who been in my yard, why would anybody split us apart.. I never thought that hoe would get to my heart, I found out right off this bitch came from a bar?. Why this hoe ain't in somebody garage.. I was a gentlemen right from the start.. Ever since I put the hoe in my touch,. now this bitch won't even spare me the rod.. My lawnmower home, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'..

I try to drink petron so all the memories gone.. All the pain I'm trying to pour it in my cup. Bought the hoe my last couple of bucks.. Lost a hoe I never felt this crush, like cushion a dutch, never this much.. If I woulda known my hoe was just temporary.. And I ain't talking about the hoe you find in the dictionary.. I feel like going to war like the military.. Somebody gon' have to visit the cemetery.. My lawnmower home, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.. My rake's in the shed, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.. Plow in the world, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.. I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my hoe's still missin, like it's greener on the other side."

Any nigga in his right mind wanna keep a grudge. Deadly flow kid you ain't never seen a dove. Dancing over trouble what it's papas daughter. Rolling stones she can't hide in a louis clutch. The bigger man when I look back at it pretty much. Another chance at it pass on it like a bud. Just hit the gas on it man shortly to the club. I think it's best it was best that we split up.

I was out with my homie for his birthday. But that excuse had neva had me comin home late. You straight im straight I don't want to deal with it. Yeah she told me that a couple times ima live with it. No yo let me know I might come visit. That's when you know you got the rope around your neck. Pitchin, scratching, choking whatever. Hangin from the tree the next time I know better. Face tattooed on me should of got letters. Dead to her face if I could I'll tell her. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. But it hurts to think. You're somewhere on a search for me. I'm right here with no words to speak. Daydreaming about what could never be.

thinking of you,"But it hurts to think you're somewhere on a search for me.. I'm right here with no words to speak. Daydreaming about what could never be.. It will never be.. But I wonder. Do you think of me. Do you think of me. Cause I'm thinking of.. All I wanted was to keep this love alive (yeah). And all I wanted was to be there by your side.. (yeah yeah). I know better than to keep on telling lies. Should have swallowed my pride. But I think sometimes that. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. But it hurts to think. You're somewhere on a search for me. I'm right here with no words to speak. Daydreaming about what could never be. It will never be. But I wonder. Do you think of me. Do you think of me. Cause I'm thinking of you. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. I think it's best that we let it go. No stress than the mess we was headed for. Cause only trouble had vision in the telescope. A peace of mind better than mission impossible. Who want a possible. I take a bird in the hand if it's toucan. But two can't play the star in a new band. Rockin wit you get it poppin with you. When da gossip hit you I don't wanna say. I shoulda coulda woulda would. Any nigga in his right mind wanna keep a grudge. Deadly flow kid you ain't never seen a dove. Dancing over trouble what it's papas daughter. Rolling stones she can't hide in a louis clutch. The bigger man when I look back at it pretty much. Another chance at it pass on it like a bud. Just hit the gas on it man shortly to the club. I think it's best it was best that we split up. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. But it hurts to think. You're somewhere on a search for me. I'm right here with no words to speak. Daydreaming about what could never be. It will never be. But I wonder. Do you think of me. Do you think of me. Cause I'm thinking of you. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. And, all I ever wanted was a good girl. Good girls come within I got a tell a little girl. Shawty lil mama let's try to save the drama. I know I ain't a saint but still believe in comma. I'm gon try to get my shit together. Oh yeah I know it's misery. So what the hell I tell her. Hello good morning. I was out with my homie for his birthday. But that excuse had neva had me comin home late. You straight im straight I don't want to deal with it. Yeah she told me that a couple times ima live with it. No yo let me know I might come visit. That's when you know you got the rope around your neck. Pitchin, scratching, choking whatever. Hangin from the tree the next time I know better. Face tattooed on me should of got letters. Dead to her face if I could I'll tell her. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. But it hurts to think. You're somewhere on a search for me. I'm right here with no words to speak. Daydreaming about what could never be. It will never be. But I wonder. Do you think of me. Do you think of me. Cause I'm thinking of you. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go"

all my life,"[Chorus:]. All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on. All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on. The hood never caused but they all was hard. His kind never represented love at all. Purple hearts in the hood, them ghetto scars. Where every time I see my daddy it was just a mirage. Now my mammy need a mechanic when the car wouldn't start. I couldn't understand it, even told it to god. Now my family in jeans, headed straight to the top. Access granted with this empty can of starch. No not the [?] liquor store got robbed. Yellow tape was the moon every night on the block. Surrounded by the stars them dirty cars. Dreadlocks in the grill try to camouflage. Gotta make it out for real for I be at large. I wrote XXL in the view of my squad. Got a record on the shelf they say I'm good at the mall. Gotta learn to help myself no sugar to borrow. Cause.... All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on. All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on. A four course meal every first of the month. Everybody in the projects family home. Don't know you till the DJ like I want some. But before thanksgiving, was a catholic nun. Crabs in the bucket dirty 11 to 1. Without the struggle probably never woulda heard of lebron. Try and juggle in the casket with ya sister lavonne. Suicide, live lavish at the tip of my tongue. Only thing come to ratchet was the 23rd song. Yeah it coulda been tragic for the boy from the scums. Yeah he got the craftmatic no rest till I won. Life took a stab at him couldn't punch him alone. Born near the savages kinda made me numb. Two doors from where the dope boi magic was slung. It was real not a fancy, they'd kill ya for crumbs. Only reason why I rap, keep from being a bum. Cause.... All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on. All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on. Sitting here, reminiscing,. Of all the nights I had to grind. Taking chances with the system,. I put my whole life on the line. All my life know it ain't been sweet. All my life I been in the streets. All my life up against concrete. All my life mama gave me the speech. All my life somebody died every week. All my life ducking the police. All my life without soda I weeped. All my life no first class seats. All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on. All my life, had to hustle just to make a way. All my life, riding dirty on the highway. All my life and it all changed in one day. All my life it's the moment I been waiting on"

finally here,"(Chorus). Hard to follow my dreams workin this 9 to 5. People keep tellin me my check is on the way. So sun up to sundown I’m grindin, tryin to make it by. Prayin for my shift to come and take away the pain. That day is finally here (x3). New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain,. new wrist, knew that, knew this, finally here. That day is finally here (x2). New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain. New wrist, knew that, knew this. (Verse 1). No, no I won’t settle for nothing less than the air that I breathe. I-I-I know it’s a struggle, but who the hell g’on do it for me. Who the hell g’on do it free. If I don’t get up and bust my ass, that’s my motto. I can’t put my faith in the lotto, luck don’t stay nowhere near where I go. Unless you ride that muthafucka. And you be lucky enough to get away, in the grave. What can I do, what can I say, I tried to get paid. But I got grazed, the bullet went through. But I ain’t get paid,. Now what do I appreciate? My J-O-B. Hey boss, I’m comin in late. (Chorus). (Verse 2). Lil cousin got it right? and bike without no frame, ride the same rides without no brain?. Life ain’t life, without no shame, if I make it out the hood, damn right I’m gon change. My cell phone number. But the area code still gon be 305 tho. My friends who was my friends just like my kin. Walked em in model?. But please wipe your feet on the rug. You can keep your shoes on, it’s all love. Boy let me stop, im dreamin too much, now who the hell. ?Gon give up a million bucks. Nobody but God, right now I could use me one of them black cards. I’m scarred, I fell apart, I came here with stars, its hard huh?. (Chorus). (Verse 3). F-F-F-Findin me. That day I been tryin to reach, that pay I been diein to see. Boy them folk wouldn’t lie to me. I thought money ain’t grow on trees. Depends on the roots, how you plant that seed. They quit, you can’t see no leaves. Hold up, I need my versace’s. Grace covers of magazines, my mother she proud of me. Myself, I, the one who the haters thought wasn’t gon be shit. Big yachts, every day I get seasick, I was broke, the prefix. My book say “Why yall gave that nigga some cash?”. I wrote a song about it, wanna hear it? here it goes"

Looked at me so fatigued, I must be her soldier. Hopin she wouldn't tease and get in my Rover. Lil' momma you got to breathe like diamonds supposed ta. Come closer, can I hold ya, just what I need. Like my Gucci loafers, hold the, disappointment - must be sealed inside. Bowlegged woman that's what I need, I don't mind. Like how she flaunt it, see that's my speed, she a dime. Thought for a moment how could this be so fine?. Body bangin, I lay the language, that walk is famous. The proper anus like she was painted. She got me tainted, I gotta brang it, this woman dangerous. None other, who's her lover, this above her. Get it from her mother, did it to her brother. Magazine cover, glad to meet a hustler. Shorty whassup~! She had.... [Chorus]. [Flo Rida:]. Heyyy parking lot pimpin, yeah that's the way I approached her. Hips went up and down like a roller coaster. Miss - got her attention, tapped her on the shoulder. Serious, she the business and I need closure. So hood and I'm startin, I'm blowin see no stuck up trumpin. Bugari I'm good and I smell like the fragrance of money. I'm sorry this lady take over just like a tsunami. She had on the Jacob, I'm rockin my platinum my money. This ain't your normal every day baby. The type to drive nothin less than that 600 Mercedes. It's rare that you find a woman so vicious on the daily. That grant all your wishes with looks to kill like a .380. I feel like she put me under a spell. Pretty ambitious about delicious full attention on the yell.

r.o.o.t.s,"Chorus. I’m talking’ bout roots. I can’t hate where I’m from. Cause where I’m from made me (Cause where I’m from made me). I came from the bottom of the slums. But now I got me...me. That’s because of my roots (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeeeaaahh). I’m talking’ bout roots (Yeah, Yeah, Yeeeaaahh). I’m talking bout roots. Verse 1. Hey I can’t be mad at what ya’ll meet ahead. I don’t regret my ghetto struggle due to my success. It ain’t that beautiful to write on overcoming stress. Top Ramen noodles thank pappy for the fact I was fed. Look at me now but all before hey Mr. Skid Row. The dirty south ain’t just a name the way I’ve been poor. The projects burnin’ white, I call it gizmo. Went from a gun to them cars in a Jigga video. Can’t find a meal to a mil, only God know it. No record deal to a deal, I work hard for it. Can I live to I’m livin’ like my Momma told it. Before you rip it, gotta sew it. Yeah. Chorus. I’m talking’ bout roots. I can’t hate where I’m from. Cause where I’m from made me (Cause where I’m from made me). I came from the bottom of the slums. But now I got me...me. That’s because of my roots (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeeeaaahh). I’m talking’ bout roots (Yeah, Yeah, Yeeeaaahh). I’m talking bout roots. Verse 2. Hey, still on my coupe but can’t take. Somebody had to be just to get away. My sister had to leave, I respect her stayin safe. Oh yea I had to grieve but I’m stronger to this day. Pain, I can’t ignore it, you might say I’m ignorant. I’m mistakin’ for courage, which victory so gorgeous. Make it through two Bush, I can make it through any forest. Hunger gave me the wish, but the bottom is so important. 37 ave and 187 street, Miami (Karat city), now I’m part of a legacy. I’m thankful for the hood, what is love without jealousy. There’s only five letters really help me. Chorus. I’m talking’ bout roots. I can’t hate where I’m from. Cause where I’m from made me (Cause where I’m from made me). I came from the bottom of the slums. But now I got me...me. That’s because of my roots (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeeeaaahh). I’m talking’ bout roots (Yeah, Yeah, Yeeeaaahh). I’m talking bout roots. Verse 3. Hey I know the seeds been planted. It’s damaging my soul but my dreams been granted. That triple life towards, much deeper than nurse planet. What could I want more than redoing I never planned it. Gets no lower than a grabbin’ on your feet. A man will stand for nothin’if he fall off with the feet. A baller and a hitter all in the street. If you look beneath the sand then we all need a crease. Roots before the branches, roots before mansions. Roots before your paper crazier than Marilyn Manson. Roots with your grandparents, roots under your canvas. Roots whether you black, white, or Spanish. Chorus. I’m talking’ bout roots. I can’t hate where I’m from. Cause where I’m from made me (Cause where I’m from made me). I came from the bottom of the slums. But now I got me...me. That’s because of my roots (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeeeaaahh). I’m talking’ bout roots (Yeah, Yeah, Yeeeaaahh). I’m talking bout roots"

Wish I could go back to yesterday. If I could I'd pull it up and rewind. I try sticking to the rivers that I'm used to. But these tears got me searching for an inner tube. Witness my homies life shorter than my inner lose. Don't wanna drown in my hurt cause it's critical. I pop champagne, but still it's a damn pain.

I anticipate the day like a school prom. Promise tomorrow what you think till you lose some. Big will I know heaven got the futon. Face good with the man paid your dues done. Wack your shows in Japan with me getting drunk. We had plans, plans change the new sun. The lord never leave us lonely when you lose one. If I could change the past, my people wouldn't past. I wish life was Tivo and you could bring it back. I wish it all was remote and how the day be said. I were Ip use it like its pixel flap. Pull up the hood times, pull up the good times. Everyday be forever when I'm puttin down. Showing off that's the truth nah. If I could I would pull it up and rewind. To the time when it was just me and you. Oh how we were inseparable.

My rake in good condition,. my lawnmower in position.. I ain't done a damn thing wrong for my hoe to get up and get missin.. Now I'd be wrong if I was to dig up the dirt and I saw for myself then witness.. Well I'd tell you about my hoe, never had restrictions.. I guess more green was her attention, I shoulda kept that hoe in the kitchen.. Got me on a mission, left my shed without permission..

A hoe is good for diggin',. I shoulda know this from the beginnin'.. I don' got caught slippin' now. I'm trippin out the door somebody else found interest.. Throw my hoe until I found out until I find out different.. Better to know then have intuitions.. Who been in my yard, why would anybody split us apart.. I never thought that hoe would get to my heart, I found out right off this bitch came from a bar?. Why this hoe ain't in somebody garage.. I was a gentlemen right from the start.. Ever since I put the hoe in my touch,. now this bitch won't even spare me the rod.. My lawnmower home, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.. My rake's in the shed, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.. Plow in the world, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.. I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my hoe's still missin, like it's green on the other side.. . 7 years now it's all over, now hold on goin' gotta feel me brah.. Left my home, no sign of luck. I try to drink petron so all the memories gone.. All the pain I'm trying to pour it in my cup. Bought the hoe my last couple of bucks.. Lost a hoe I never felt this crush, like cushion a dutch, never this much.. If I woulda known my hoe was just temporary.. And I ain't talking about the hoe you find in the dictionary.. I feel like going to war like the military.. Somebody gon' have to visit the cemetery.. My lawnmower home, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.. My rake's in the shed, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.. Plow in the world, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'..

thinking of you,"But it hurts to think you're somewhere on a search for me.. I'm right here with no words to speak. Daydreaming about what could never be.. It will never be.. But I wonder. Do you think of me. Do you think of me. Cause I'm thinking of.. All I wanted was to keep this love alive (yeah). And all I wanted was to be there by your side.. (yeah yeah). I know better than to keep on telling lies. Should have swallowed my pride. But I think sometimes that. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. But it hurts to think. You're somewhere on a search for me. I'm right here with no words to speak. Daydreaming about what could never be. It will never be. But I wonder. Do you think of me. Do you think of me. Cause I'm thinking of you. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. I think it's best that we let it go. No stress than the mess we was headed for. Cause only trouble had vision in the telescope. A peace of mind better than mission impossible. Who want a possible. I take a bird in the hand if it's toucan. But two can't play the star in a new band. Rockin wit you get it poppin with you. When da gossip hit you I don't wanna say. I shoulda coulda woulda would. Any nigga in his right mind wanna keep a grudge. Deadly flow kid you ain't never seen a dove. Dancing over trouble what it's papas daughter. Rolling stones she can't hide in a louis clutch. The bigger man when I look back at it pretty much. Another chance at it pass on it like a bud. Just hit the gas on it man shortly to the club. I think it's best it was best that we split up. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. But it hurts to think. You're somewhere on a search for me. I'm right here with no words to speak. Daydreaming about what could never be. It will never be. But I wonder. Do you think of me. Do you think of me. Cause I'm thinking of you. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. And, all I ever wanted was a good girl. Good girls come within I got a tell a little girl. Shawty lil mama let's try to save the drama. I know I ain't a saint but still believe in comma. I'm gon try to get my shit together. Oh yeah I know it's misery. So what the hell I tell her. Hello good morning. I was out with my homie for his birthday. But that excuse had neva had me comin home late. You straight im straight I don't want to deal with it. Yeah she told me that a couple times ima live with it. No yo let me know I might come visit. That's when you know you got the rope around your neck. Pitchin, scratching, choking whatever. Hangin from the tree the next time I know better. Face tattooed on me should of got letters. Dead to her face if I could I'll tell her. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. But it hurts to think. You're somewhere on a search for me. I'm right here with no words to speak. Daydreaming about what could never be. It will never be. But I wonder. Do you think of me. Do you think of me. Cause I'm thinking of you. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go. Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go"
