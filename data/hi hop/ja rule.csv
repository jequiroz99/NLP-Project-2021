Got me seekin capital game when I spit sixteen. Whether bars or sixteens in the doors of cars. A star is born. In the hood, made a name live on, R-U-L-E, ladies, feel me. (Chorus). (Charli Baltimore). Now I'm show you blood or love, there's no belly you bounce from. Blow sellin, dough amounts to no tellin. There'll be no tellin, snitches get it back. Those gats to your backs for my boy. What part of the game is that, huh?. Niggas and they feelings 'cause I handle your dealings, keep your name in tact. My fame's in tact so cops won't know what it's hittin for. Now hoes wanna know what you shittin for. 'Cause I'm your bitch, the Bonnie to your Clyde. It's mental, mash your enemies, we out in the rental. I'm your bitch, niggas run up on ya, shift ya lungs, who's your organ donor?. What they know about, extreme meausures I'm a ride with you. And my baby three-eighty at my side. And we lock the town, I'm as down as any thug. My love, they gotta take us in blood, what. (Chorus). (Ja Rule). You could die from love, at any given time I could die from slugs. But that's what this life is capable of. The death and the life of a bitch and a thug, is what I'm scared of. But got a woman that ain't afraid to, tuck the toast in the Escalade. Pop on niggas that showin me shade, but only for the Rule 'cause that's my baby. Got me a down ass bitch with red hair, that don't care. Blazed by the shots and flares. Girl c'mon, follow me, and bust back at police, conceal ya heat. It's a bit much to blaze up. Rule and Chuck and I.G., the Murderers, I-N-C. With one on the hip, one in the holster, nigga will toast ya quick. Especially a down ass bitch. (Chorus). (Ja Rule). Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch. Thug on, ladies. Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch. Thug on, baby. Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch. Thug on, ladies. Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch. Thug on, baby. (Chorus) 2x. Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)."
new york,"[Hook – Ja Rule]. I got a hundred guns, and a hundred clips, Niggaz I'm from New York ( New York ). I got a semi-automatic that spit's next time if you talk ( you talk ). I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York ( New York ). I got a semi-automatic that spit's next time if you talk (you talk). (And I know). [Verse 1 – Ja Rule]. Yall niggaz is pussy, poonani, Vagina. Your +Monologue's+ getting tired, now it's time to ride. You're print distrified, you're no longer desired. So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire. I'm on fire, holly dipped in octane. Let each coast bang, let west coast bang. And Rule gonna bring the ghetto gospel. To every 'hood possible, pushin through in the sky blue. Back with the gods you now, preferably the 4 pound. Slugs flyin at the speed of sound. Tryin to catch the ears of niggaz that's runnin their mouths. I might get my Brooklyn niggaz to run in your house. I don't really understand what the runnin's about. But we're hunters, we take pride in airin our prey out. Leavin 'em layed out, dead, in just a sport. 'cause we ain't playin up here in New York. [Hook – Fat Joe]. I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Niggaz I'm from New York (New York). And you can tell the way the homie spit, That niggaz, I'm from New York (New York). I got a hundred ways to make a grip, Yes, I'm from New York (New York). And you can tell I get real ignorant, 'cause niggaz, I'm from New York (New York). (And this is how we do). [Verse 2 – Fat Joe]. Nigga I can see the coke in your nose. This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe. And I was just about to find god. But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage. And everybody talkin crazy how they're AK spit. But we know this investigatin, and they ain't spray shit. Not me, I'm the truth homie, got the industry shook like. ""Naw nigga, Joe gonna let 'em loose on me"". True Story, I'm bringin the T back. Even Roy Jones was forced to +Lean Back+. My nigga Dre said grind cook. Now we killin them Howard niggaz, who said I must of found Pun's rhyme book. Got bitches on top of the Phantom. And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn. Cook coke, crack, niggaz fiend for that. And you already know the x is where the team be at. [Hook – Jadakiss]. I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Niggaz I'm from New York (New York). +Ruff Ryde+, and +D-Block+ and shit, Niggaz fuck what you thought (you thought). And you can't take shit for granted, because life is too short (too short). I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Niggaz I'm from New York. (Aha, and this is how we do). [Verse 3 – Jadakiss]. I swear it couldn't be sweeter, Life's a bitch. Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich. It's guaranteed you gonna die, you might get missed. For maybe 2 or 3 hours, 'til they light their spliffs. And that coke will get you a long time. But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online. Wise has awoken. And you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open. I still hold a title, because I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles. Stick up kids, hoppin out with them old rifles. Just doin shit for nothin, it's so spiteful. Ha I'm just like you. Word that niggaz wanna murk you is in the air. A double shot of yak and the purple is in the air. And I'm not cocky, I'm confident. So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment. [Hook – Jadakiss]. I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Niggaz I'm from New York (New York). +Ruff Ryde+, and +D-Block+ and shit, Niggaz fuck what you thought (you thought). And you can't take shit for granted, because life is too short (too short). I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Niggaz I'm from New York. (Aha, and this is how we do)"

the manual,"(Ja Rule). Yeah, yeah, yeah. You talk too much shit. You know niggaz always talkin bout bitches ain't shit. Money over bitches. But give all our money to the bitches any fuckin way. (I love my bitch) So I'ma send some love out. to the bitches, holla. (Verse One). Shit, here's somethin to remember. When we met that day in September. But, you've been gone since November. Had to finish out yo' last college semester. Her major - brokerage investor. She probably go broke tryin to invest her. time and money in somethin that she call love. Cause, she love fuckin with thug niggaz. That alwasy get high and had to be drug dealers. Eventually, she hooked up with some hood bitches. The hood bitches turned her on to strippin. Now the, gettin is good and it's well understood. That money on the wood can make things get harder. Be glad I'm not a pimp, if I was I'd charge ya. But for all that you go through, just thought I'd let you know. Hoes need love too, I'm fuckin witchu. (Chorus: Ja Rule). Niggaz need to read the man-u-al. To seperate your housewife from a hoe. Cause there's no rules to this shit here. Am I makin myself clear?. What she don't know won't hurt her y'all. So keep big pimpin on the low. Cause there's no rules to what I do. And I know, hoes need love too. (Verse Two). You know what they say right? Bitches ain't shit. And all men are dogs cause we just wanna fuck. Sundown to sun up, one up on a hoe. I might go down on the low, that's just me though. From L-A-X to Heathrow, I'm one of them niggaz. that really doesn't need no, introduction. When I met her she was ""Girl, Interrupted"". Grew up became a woman not to be trusted. Frustrated and flustered, living amongst. these thieves hoes and hustlers, I'm diggin what's next. She had a studio apartment in the projects. With her and her girl from D.C. used to bus checks. And hold the coke, her niggaz ain't sold yet. In hopes the copes don't know about all this. Shiiiiit, for all that you go through. Just wanna let you know, hoes need love too. (Chorus). (Verse Three). Fake nails, fake breasts, fake eyes too. It's oh-four, and that's kinda what we used to. But you don't holla back like you used to, but I ain't mad at cha. I'm happy for a bitch, even if I can't have her. I remember when you was down in Atlanta. Workin gentlemen's clubs and you didn't even know what a gentlemen was. Forty to love and I wanna serve. That body like Serena's with less curves. But actions speak louder than words, and you gettin your money. Mami every month, 15th and 1st. Shit could be worse, you could be in the struggle. Or born with no ass and have nothin to hustle. Go on flex your muscle, cause that ain't the case is it?. Go on get your paper keep flossin on these bitches. Cause for all that you go through. Just thought I'd let you know, hoes need love too, I'm fuckin witchu. (Chorus) - repeat 2X. [Ja Rule]. Ha ha ha, yeah, Rule"

Fuck, knowing your name, get your ass in the Range. And rollover, gettin' blown while blowing the doja. Bring head to a closure. That's a good bitch. Before it's all over, I'ma leave this bitch. Probably treat this bitch, smoke better. 'Cause if you ain't know, gangstas and hoes go together. Poppin' my collar, partna. Who in the spot?. Baby, Rule in the spot. In the mug and the watch, love me. Half the hoes hate me, half them love me. The ones that hate me only hate me 'cause they ain't fucked me. And they say I'm lucky. Do you think I've got time to fuck all these hoes?. And do all these shows?. Or flight in the lama, Dodge and White Rolls. Uh-oh, another episode. [Hook: Case & Ja Rule]. What, do I do?. To all my niggas that be livin' it up, we say.... What, I do. To all my bitches that be givin' it up, uhh. What, you do. To all my niggas that be livin' it up, we say.... What, do I do?. To all my bitches that be givin' it up, uhh. My love for you. C'mon. [Verse 2: Ja Rule]. Bitches, just wanna hold the name exactly. That's why they suck dick with more passion than apples. And I ain't mad at'cha. Never leave you alone. 'Cause we fucks when I'm home. Phone sex when I'm gone. We both grown, both got minds of our own. Bust our freaks off like old dog and Love Jones. Been, in many zones, baby. One hoe, two hoes. Fuck prizzy bitches, the hoes that do bono. But you know, the Rule be livin' it up. And got all these hoes, givin' it up. I like a little Rule baby, how cute are you?. With a body that rides all sexual. I got a stick, I'll ride right next to you. Do a doughnut, and cut, and I'll open it up. On the freeway, dick in her mouth, foot on the clutch. Rule bitch, not givin' a fuck. [Hook]. [Ja Rule]. C'mon, we get high. C'mon, we get ride. C'mon, we get live. Live yo' life. [Verse 3: Ja Rule]. Love you so sexy, I just want you next to me. Your whole vibe, like you high on Extasy. 'Caue ain't nuthin' but an ""E"" thang baby. I know that pussy wet like crazy. I wanna feel your passion, come when you ask me. Laugh when you cry, cry when you laughin'. But ain't nothin' happenin'. The bitch got a little too high. Picked up my ride and started crackin'. The radio blastin' +Between Me And You+. But you ain't on the low with that freak shit you do. I thought you knew (What I do). Know I know (What you do). 'Cause it's been a good night, your head ain't right. Like Teddy P, let's +Turn Off The Light+'. And grind it out, takin' no times out. 'Til the sun come out. Bitch, when you find out. [Hook 2x]. [Ja Rule]. C'mon, we get high. C'mon, we get ride. C'mon, we get live. C'mon, it's my time. [Ja Rule talking until end]."

Won't you let me let you live it a little bit. I know a stressful relationship is hard to deal with. But here's how you deal with it. On your weekly visits, use a code name. To protect the innocent. Maybe I'm too generous. Generally believin that all women want me. They don't wanna get even. But who do you believe in?. Is it money or God?. Betrayal or trust, sustain your vows. Secretly or sacred. Cuz I love it when you pop your body-body. Move your body-body. Drink up all the Bacardi. And roll up alongside me. I love too see you wild and free. But occasionally you get cold wet feet. And all that it means to me is that you need my heat. Cause when it's said and done you're gonna want me. Lovin', thuggin' and I know you.... [Chorus 2x]. Baby, here I'm holdin' your love hostage. The ransom for you, sugar, be priceless. Cause you been gettin' at me in many a ways. Now tell your man to watch his back and duck them strays. Cause I been in a rage lately. Hopin' God'll forgive me for all the sin and all the woman. All the drama I been in and it's just the beginnin'. I hope your watching so you could see that nigga ain't built. like me!!. The black sheep of my family. But we one in the same, that's why we get along. Freak off and get it on. When we make love lookin' somethin' like soft porn. Tell me, baby, do you really wanna go home to him??. But the brightest of your days just goin' look dim. Cause you fuckin' with a loser, baby, you can't win. When it's said and done you're gonna need me. Lovin', thuggin' and I know you..... [Chorus 2x]. Yeah, yeah, I.G, Ja Rule. B. Brown Murder Inc.. Def Jam, Sony. This is what we buildin' here. Murder Inc.. Ha-ha-ha. Bobby Brown. Murder. Ha-ha. It's that real. Rule, baby. Bring it back my, niggaz. B. Brown, ha-ha.

I know not the answers but I ask the questions. Do all Muslims really study their leasons?. And how many Christians lie during confessions?. I know I did when I was just a kid. Never told about the guns my uncle hid. Under my bed, and at night I played with them. Kind of grew up to be sort of a loose cannon. Before my sins, I'm asking you to let me in Lord help me,. I been through all the pain. Now I wanna know who loves me. [Chorus x2]. [Ja Rule]. Changes, changes My mind is going through. Changes, changes My body's going through. Changes, changes My life is going through. Changes, changes. . [Ja Rule]. Yo, looky here I just wanna fuck all day, live my life. Get high all day, my life. Maybe one day, I'll live right. Fuck the world, it's my life. [Chorus x4]."
race against time part. 2,"Yeah, yeah, uh huh. Race against time, ha part two. You know, haha,. Uh, c'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah, haha. Nothin like the future. [Verse 1]. Guess who's back to personify money, power, and bitches. But when bitches been gettin money, that when shit get ridiculous. I'm hittin switches like six fo's, bouncin and leanin. The west coast seemin, keep the fo' fo' demon. And the rock is all stashed up. Roll up a little diesel, keep it hashed up. Then +Holla, Holla+ at the whores, is hollerin back. Let 'em know a few facts like if your ridin, your back's slidin. This is the 'Race Against Time' and I ain't got time to waste. To give chase, I put a hole in your fin. But your head to the barrel like DJ's is spinnin. Backward, to blow off the backwood, I'm so hood. But what's really hood, when you ain't doin your hood. no motherfuckin good, and bein misunderstood. I would die if I could, Rule the lion. And I'ma keep ""ri-da-da-da-da-in"". [Chorus - 2X]. Race against time, I - can't stop. Runnin through the red light - livin my life. Even if I'm gettin too hot. Still I can't stop - ""Ri-da-da-da-din"". [Verse 2]. Bless the day that the God was born two, twenty-nine, seventy-six. This cocaine was heavily mixed. And all them niggaz had a fixation for bad reputation. For pimpin hoes, and shootin fo, to bring the free basin. If this is time erasin, the devil is runnin like Bettis. And got his guns out lookin for ways to behead us. You can die in a matter of seconds, so I'ma slow it down. Turn back the hands of time with the 40 Cal. Claimin your style is the realest, so I'ma define the meanin of murder, it's killer. You outta your mind, the burner's designed for the fill up. No gas, and when I spits like acid. smoke weed, but blow ether, spit ashes. cause young Rule in his prime like 'Clay Cassius'. Hated by the masses, but overwhelmed with love and passion. For when I die niggaz keep ""ri-da-da-da-din"". [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. If Jesus Christ was criticized, then why not me. What the fuck am I special, I struck a deal with the devil. Haha, every kid a prophet, which one seem like its logic. Me in church, or me in bed with bitches managen. I can chase like sergeant, addictive like heroin. Outsiders just lookin in, through a barrel that's pinned to the peep hole. They seein all or nothin like Jazz from Clisco. Hit 'em up and let's go, jump over the threshold. I just got married to bangin pistol, drugs and other shit. Feel in love with a bitch that I call crime. She reminded me that nobody can beat time. If you get enough of it nigga. So I looked her dead in her eyes and pulled the trigger. Thinkin that the music we feel would be somethin different. But this the same old criminal vibin. I ain't hidin, I'ma keep ""ri-da-da-da-din""."
caught up,"[Intro - Ja Rule - talking]. Word to mother, my nigga Buck 3000 on the boards. Holla back ... hey Terry you gon' be big boy. Y'knahmsayin? ... aiyyo, aiyyo Jody. Hey you can tell somebody to go downstairs to the car and shit, get that bottle of Voo. Out the back of the back for me baby. I need to get right before I do this here. Uh huh. [Chorus - Lloyd] + (Alexus). (Why me and you). Had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up. (What we been through). It's enough to get any man caught up. (I'm feelin you). And I'm feelin we should both be free. (If we were through). Just imagine what life be without me. [Verse 1 - Ja Rule]. Mami I put my best foot forward, though it's kinda awkward. Cause I'm pigeon-toed and bow-legged, but you ain't too proud to beg. First time we got alone, you gave me some head. And been callin me ever since, to do it again. When we met you was a seven, just creepin to ten. And now your my lucky quarter, the days get shorter, lights get longer. You know when the weather is cold, feelings grow stronger. Wanna perform her, your pussy feel like walkin pneumonia. Got me snifflin, sneezin, coughin, and achin and shit. And I'm startin to think I'm fallin in love with this bitch. I'm havin dreams about her jeans and how they fit. ... in that Urban Jeffrey baby tee. She's wearin my name already, so you know she's fuckin me. I'm a G like that, but for you I fell backwards. The only question I ask myself is ... shit. [Chorus]. [Verse 2 - Ja Rule]. Why me? Better yet why you and I?. Why I always pick the ones not in they right mind and crazy?. Singing ""Dangerously In Love"" and ... this a dangerous broad I'm fuckin. Like Al it's the ""Scent of a Woman"". That got me playin hardball like Doc Gooden. Excuse my intrudin, I don't mean to be rude, but our situation is kinda amusin. Cause we both like each other, but scared of each other. It's like we more than friends, but less than lovers. And my niggaz can't tell us, what we been doin is wrong. And your girl's gettin jealous, cause we been gettin along. Hold on, this is how it all begins. You call your friends, I'll call my friends, we'll all be friends. And hang out at the mansion, in the Hamptons on weekends. Then it all ends, and the question is ... [Chorus]. [Break - Lloyd]. Have you even been touched like I touch ya?. Been held like I hold ya?. Been loved like I love ya?. Be real, be real. Have you ever been seen like I see you?. Been heard how I hear you?. Been felt how I feel you?. Be real, be real. [Verse 3 - Ja Rule]. Girl your my (Alexus: sunshine), but sometimes it gets a little cloudy don't it?. Them sunny days, I see the sunrise, and wish that it could hit ya face. It'd be great to get up every morning to eggs and steak. But you can't relate, so we separated on good terms. No one's concerned, about who ya been fuckin, and who ya fucked last. But when I see you, still the question I ask is ... [Chorus] - 2X"

bout my business,"[Caddillac Tah]. Yeah... Yeah, yeah, yo. I got a knack for pushin crack, and cookin raw coke. Fresh off the boat, no vest but I tote, and wear it like a coat. I'm starin through the scope, with one eye open and one shut. Zero in on the target, spark him and watch his head bust. Ain't shit to discuss, unless it's moneybags. or the SK-8, drop Jag with funny tags. Homey laugh now but die later when the lead dump. And double barrel slugs like Elmer Fudd, I'm handsome. [Black Child]. Some of your favorite rappers is flamin, I'm bangin things at them. They claim they gangster, lettin mens give brains to them. I aim the stainless, let the games begin. Bang bang dangerous, my gun gang famous. My hoes don't speak english, catch 'em at the foreign money exchange. New Armani leather in the Range. When you see my gang, tuck in your chain. We stuck in the game, we fuckin the same, bang!. [Chorus: INC]. [Merc] I'm bout my money and bout my business (bang!). [B.C.] Shout out my niggaz en route to riches (bang!). [B.C.] I doubt we different, hustlers pitchin (bang!). [B.C.] And we all gon' get away, all my niggaz say. [Merc] I'm bout my money and bout my business (yeah!). [B.C.] Whatta, bout my bitches who mouth is ridiculous (yeah!). [B.C.] Gettin money and nigga it's insignificant (yeah! what?). [B.C.] Always get your pay, I love it when I hear 'em say. [Black Child]. It's back to business, stackin riches. If you, act suspicious, it's a Wrap like Reynolds. Black Continental, mac outta the window. Black's out of his mental, I black out with pistols. It ain't confidential, all the shit I been through. Now I'm gettin money and a mill' is essential. Bang bang, nigga, 'til the day we die. A tooth for a tooth and a eye for a eye. [Caddillac Tah]. Nigga you know it's, business befo' pleasure, money over chicks. Dummies in the clip, nickel on my hip patrollin through the strip. Bet a stack, head crack, no rollin to the six. Scoop up my chips, then I split, with my beautiful bitch. Like Jada Pinkett Smith, for that paper I leave stinkin and stiff. Your pinky and wrist, and your necklace. Get removed nigga, my wolves is playin hardball. Leavin him bloody like a Pelican Bay yard brawl. [Chorus]. [Ja Rule]. Who wanna know why I got so much beef with so many rappers?. Drama, it's the INC redrum spun backwards. Karma, is a muh'fucker watch your actions. Cause the clip to the max slips in bananas. I catch fire like matches {*whew*} then blow out. And the flyest crews goin the fastest. Pull up to the hottest club in New York, with my hazards on. No tags, I just drove it off the showroom floor. Straight cash, bout my paper, I'm on my gangster. Doin this shit for ten years, niggaz I'm major. Maybach and all that, same behaviour. Money over bitches, bitches over strangers. Guns befo' bangers but bangers do. For niggaz that had enough and ain't got no clue. that they can get slayed, flex and get sprayed. And spin they head like yo' hottest DJ's, motherfuckers!. [Chorus]. [Merc] I'm bout my money and bout my business.."
caught up,"[Intro - Ja Rule - talking]. Word to mother, my nigga Buck 3000 on the boards. Holla back ... hey Terry you gon' be big boy. Y'knahmsayin? ... aiyyo, aiyyo Jody. Hey you can tell somebody to go downstairs to the car and shit, get that bottle of Voo. Out the back of the back for me baby. I need to get right before I do this here. Uh huh. [Chorus - Lloyd] + (Alexus). (Why me and you). Had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up. (What we been through). It's enough to get any man caught up. (I'm feelin you). And I'm feelin we should both be free. (If we were through). Just imagine what life be without me. [Verse 1 - Ja Rule]. Mami I put my best foot forward, though it's kinda awkward. Cause I'm pigeon-toed and bow-legged, but you ain't too proud to beg. First time we got alone, you gave me some head. And been callin me ever since, to do it again. When we met you was a seven, just creepin to ten. And now your my lucky quarter, the days get shorter, lights get longer. You know when the weather is cold, feelings grow stronger. Wanna perform her, your pussy feel like walkin pneumonia. Got me snifflin, sneezin, coughin, and achin and shit. And I'm startin to think I'm fallin in love with this bitch. I'm havin dreams about her jeans and how they fit. ... in that Urban Jeffrey baby tee. She's wearin my name already, so you know she's fuckin me. I'm a G like that, but for you I fell backwards. The only question I ask myself is ... shit. [Chorus]. [Verse 2 - Ja Rule]. Why me? Better yet why you and I?. Why I always pick the ones not in they right mind and crazy?. Singing ""Dangerously In Love"" and ... this a dangerous broad I'm fuckin. Like Al it's the ""Scent of a Woman"". That got me playin hardball like Doc Gooden. Excuse my intrudin, I don't mean to be rude, but our situation is kinda amusin. Cause we both like each other, but scared of each other. It's like we more than friends, but less than lovers. And my niggaz can't tell us, what we been doin is wrong. And your girl's gettin jealous, cause we been gettin along. Hold on, this is how it all begins. You call your friends, I'll call my friends, we'll all be friends. And hang out at the mansion, in the Hamptons on weekends. Then it all ends, and the question is ... [Chorus]. [Break - Lloyd]. Have you even been touched like I touch ya?. Been held like I hold ya?. Been loved like I love ya?. Be real, be real. Have you ever been seen like I see you?. Been heard how I hear you?. Been felt how I feel you?. Be real, be real. [Verse 3 - Ja Rule]. Girl your my (Alexus: sunshine), but sometimes it gets a little cloudy don't it?. Them sunny days, I see the sunrise, and wish that it could hit ya face. It'd be great to get up every morning to eggs and steak. But you can't relate, so we separated on good terms. No one's concerned, about who ya been fuckin, and who ya fucked last. But when I see you, still the question I ask is ... [Chorus] - 2X"

Real tears from a burned out life in ten years. I sware I got the Devil in me, with no fear. If I hear I can't see, if I can't see I can't hear.

Yo, yo Now let's look at things from a right hand Would if you was that man. Would you run wit me? Gun wit me?. Would you understand the husstlin', the struggeling. Livin' the most dope heads, raisin' your kids and runnin' from the Feds. We'd be bound to bump heads, 'cuz you livin' my life. All righteous, and you said Liberacci's was right. But there's two sides to life - one dark, one light. If you lighten up forever you can dig to the night. Wrap them guns over there, and bring 'em on ova' here (One of us). 'Cuz my God is bigger down your god down here. Now we ride jet sled baby, bubble in Ba-Namb. 'Cuz Rule and the Lord got it goin' on. Been, know to do, bad shit, I'm so heavenly, butt so devilish. If, you, live through the strangest to die from the pain, tell me. Would you believe that you could breathe again? (Chorus) Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yo. Let's trade places, Rule be Spirit, God be flesh.

And I'm supposted to judge you, on earth where it's ugly. You might as well aim at the sky, slug me (One of us). 'Cuz I ain't bein' a Fair God, when life is so hard.

Degrade yourself, never cuz I'm teaching you better. Life ain't all about cheddar diamonds and leather. Understand you a black sister, in this white man's. World, don't let it get ya, down girl. It's essential that you grow amongst your group. So you don't grow too fast and be doin lord knows who. Cuz daddy loves you, don't let nobody tell you different. What I, do for a living is a talent I'm given. And I'ma raise you too black too strong beautiful. Tell the truth let you know what women go through. Lies and deceit, the nigga you love he gone cheat. So be careful in the heat baby girl wit cold feet. Keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready. Make me proud you daddy's little baby yea. [Chorus]. I'll always come back to you. I'll always come back to you. I'll always come back to you. You're my baby now and ever. . Yo Ja's imagery is somewhat like God and its chemistry. Blasphemy, I tell my baby girl proudly. Put her over my knee and let her know this world is yours. Men are dogs take it from daddy and hold yours. Head high lady, love is bout lies and deception. Will always be seen through the eyes. In my demise don't cry just, hold on. Stay headstrong and live to learn that life goes on. The day you was born God answered my cry for help. I look at you a female replica of myself. I was conceived 2/29 you 9/22. God' whats the science in this sign you grew. I wanna know just so I can spread the jewel to my youth. So she don't have to come up like I did runnin loots. Keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready. Make me proud you're daddy's little baby. Fo real. [Chorus]. . When I look in yo eyes I see stars. It's me and you against the world. Baby it's in the signs. And anything you want you can get it daddy's getting it done. You the reason why I keep the hundreds under the ones. And go through rain sleet and snow to kiss the sun. Though my travel through the storm has just begun. Swear to god when my sister died, I was only five. Didn't even cry, couldn't know the value of a life. Know I realize why Brittney's so rare to me. She came at the time when nobody cared for me. This world's tough, I'ma guide you through it carefully. Learn the game and remember nothing in life's free. My little lady, can't quite understand me now. But baby, in time I'll break it down. So keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready. Make me proud you're daddy's little baby. Fo real."

I'm top ten bigger than life the aura. If this ship sink nigger I'm gonna walk on water. Gigantic but Jesus I'm of the Christian manic. How do I manage? To be above average and not ever again. To be the one to dive in knowing I can't swim. For me to go under not breathing. I'm drowning. I'm going in the downer shape. Into the darker days. Please don't let me drown (drown). All life was fatally. The burst of your judgment day. Please don't let me drown (don't let me 4x). Pray for me cuz I tested positive. For being the shit now niggers won't touch me. And I'm allergic to broke niggers, trust me. Independent, been in the blood since a youngun. So I'm thinking there ain't no cure for my illness. And the diagnose is just something I could live with. Cause I'd have make it rain on bitches, storm on niggers. Cash flow like rivers (Please don't let me drown). The drifting it wasn't enough for me. To be in the deepest of waters, to feel like I'm snorkeling. Off shore and this so reassuring. That I'm still sick, in need of a donor. Cuz I'm heartless, so I dive in. No life vest, knowing I can't swim. So if I go under and I'm breathing. Am I drowning?. I'm going in the downer shape. Into the darker days. Please don't let me drown (drown). All life was fatally. The burst of your judgment day. Please don't let me drown (don't let me 4x). This is the story of a girl (pray). Who cried a river and drowned the whole world (they fought me). I told her cry me a river, little mama don't give up. Daddy's here to deliver, the world is cold. So them tears you can tie them up. Just don't wanna let ‘em running down your face. Baby the world is frozen. I told her if she shared it with me then it'd be ours. Like anything you maw. How can you give and drown?. Under water I can't hear a sound but I. See the rain dropping like tears from god am I. Mother's telling me that it's a sign of wealth. When I don't think the lord is too fond of her. But there's gotta be a reason. I'm not drowning, right?. I'm going in the downer shape. Into the darker days (kill my lights in here baby). Please don't let me drown (drown). All life was fatally(it's black out now). The burst of your judgment day. Please don't let me drown (don't let me 4x). Please don't let me drown (don't let me 4x). By: Binho Mpire"

get it started,"Yeah... It's still Murder, I.N.C.. [repeat 4X]. [Ja] I got you mami. [Ciara] I got you daddy. [Chorus: Ciara]. Let's get this party started. Throw your drink up and move your body. But you can't get up on it. 'til I see you work harder for it. C'mon, let's get it started. Don't you leave me all hot and bothered. You want me? Come grab it. Show me that you got me daddy. [Ja Rule]. I got you ma, workin in New York City. It's Satuday Night Live, and I'm hot so bear with me. Plus a little tired from the time zone switches. But right on time to hit a club for a minute. I get in and get a table, get bottles, some bitches. come over, they claimin they models. Until they want a drink they ain't even know who I was. Until I took my hat off, and then they started backin that ass up. Whoa! She did this dance with her hands up. Then she touched her toes and made my thing stand up. Type of chick that'll have a nigga in handcuffs. Taste but don't swallow, look but don't touch. Forbidden, not to be eaten, but she is. feedin me rotten apples that fall from the tree. Why don't we leave, just us three, and get acquainted. Mama I'm just playin - but I'm sayin. [Chorus]. [Ja Rule]. I got you ma, I'm in L.A., I'm the latest. Caught the last flight in from JFK. Baggage claim sign read R-U-L-E. Takin me straight to the party so I can get started. Rubbin on bitches like full body massages. And takin dead aim on all open targets. Soon as I walk in I see the one. that I wanna be humpin, bouncin, and grindin on. Her lowrider sit low, you can see her thong. And she like to get low on her favorite songs. I'm like don't stop, get it get it, let me get up on it. Let me see how bad you really want it. like, them cold nights when you're hot and lonely. Give me your pager, pick up a phone and call me. I was thinkin that maybe we could have an orgy. Mama I'm just playin - but I'm sayin. [Chorus]. [Ja Rule]. I got you ma, and Miami's the scene. Filled with fast women when they stop intervene. Tanned up and their walk is mean. I don't wonder how she got in, I want her out of them jeans. It seems, me and my team got a routine habit. Of gettin rid of sweaters as soon as we snag 'em. In the club, gettin high, relaxin. I see a few asses that's pacin backwards my way. The DJ spinnin it backwards. Givin shouts to actors, athletes and rappers. Now, let's get it crackin, you know how it happen. After the party there's an afterparty happenin. (Let's get this party started). Ain't that what you said, or am I hearin things?.

Friday night, getting bent, lick a poem. My dawg, not even home a month yet, and blaze a girl. in the stomach, he robbin niggaz who pumpin. Lil' Blood got popped, by the Group Home cat. Everybody nervous in the hood, pullin they gats. Fiend yellin out, who got those? Go and see. shorty snot-nosed, he don't floss but he got dough. Thug faces, fugitives runnin from court cases. Slugs shootin past for the love of drug paper. Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers. And God'll throw a beam of lightning down cause he feel us. May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest. The Mayor wanna call the SWAT team to come and kill us. but, dawgs are friends, if one see the morgue, one'll live. to get revenge, and we ride to the end. Bravehearts blow the lye with Henn, and still rise. Took alive with live men, my man got three six-to-eighteen's. and only five in, the Belly of the beast. Didn't wanna hear the shit I tried to tell him on the streets. It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat. And got us niggaz from the hood, hangin off his teeth. We slangin to eat, bringin the heat. Bulletholes, razor scars is the pain in the street, huh. [Chorus: Ja Rule [repeat 2X]]. When you a dawg you a dawg for life (ride or die).

Mad money out here. What you tryin to get it? (Word up). You gonna bust your gun to get it? (Tsh, whatever yo). I hear you I hear you. [DMX]. Uhh, I've lost my grip on reality or so it would seem. Pinch myself to wake up, cause I KNOW it's a dream. Niggaz that don't know me see me and think I'ma rob em. Niggaz that know me well see me and think I'ma problem. I'm just a nigga that's misunderstood. But word to God I turn your last name to Underwood. Cause if I see it, I'ma take it and run with it, that's me. What type of bullshit is this nigga on? That's D. The dawg come and getcha outside. The more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed. Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you. Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you. Drama, it's right here, how MUCH YOU NEED?. Beat you down with gat see how MUCH YOU BLEED. How MUCH YOU PLEAD, for your life, you was a killer. And all the bitches comin up out that ass you feelin, gettin realer. Now beg for your life, one more time, one more crime. one more nine, c'mon cry nigga. It's over! This is the shit, that hits hard.

i cry,"When I cry, you cry, we cry together (4x). I love my life, I love my wife. When bad times prevail and overwhelm me. I'm livin in hell but livin wealthy. I know these hoes love me because I'm a star. I can't even cop a drink at the bar. Just gimme some bottles of that Remy Martin. Let's get the party crackin right here, fuck Vip. Knowin my baby loves me, home wit tears in her eyes. And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin her lies. She ain't surprised at me, she's just surprised that we. Been together for this long, and I could be. The one to mistreat her, thought it'd last forever. Cause if I cry, you cry, we cry together. (Chorus). When I cry, you cry, we cry together (4x). From what I recall, we was lil niggas. Cuttin school, gettin high with the hottest bitches. Livin life so free that we ain't fearin. The ills of the world or the heat of drug dealin. You and I done made a killin and stuck together. In this land of forbidden treasures. Love is the only evil seed that could sever. A tie this close, not the love between us. But your love for the dough. You went O-T, started makin M-O-N-E-Y. Why All my good niggas gotta die. Wish it could last forever, I wish death was pleasure. Cause when you died, I cried, we cried together. (Repeat Chorus). Wash away your tears, my love. You ain't got to cry no more, my love. I put it on everything that I love. That my pain is my love, and I want. This world to smile for me. Don't shed a tear cause the nigga died happily. My momma warned me life was a mothafucka. But I ignored the warnin and kept on hustlin. And every night she'd just look at me with tears in her eyes. And then be sayin shit like I don't want my baby to die. For so much pain to her life, I gotta make it better. Cause when Ma cried, I cried, we cried together. (Repeat Chorus)"

Gotta break free from all this. Motherfuckin... anxiety, strains on my life. Open my eyes and see. It's a big world out there. If God could only.... Shine his light on me. [Ja Rule - singing]. I'm crying everyone's tears, my pain, my love. I'm crying everyone's tears.... [Narrator:]. And now, ""Pil 2"". [Chorus: Leah Siegal]. And the world was so cold; I couldn't recognize myself [x2]. So I took a little ""Pil"", and it changed my whole world. Said I want a view, so I had to take two. {Fuck Fame}. [Ja Rule:]. Picasso, Rembrandt, Basquiat. Warhol couldn't paint a better work of art. And I'm like a child in all black. Cause I tried to brainwash it, we can't man, dog is back. Elephant's in the room paint it retro. Here's a Van Gogh, but y'all don't hear me though. I'm what you never saw, but somethin you never seen. You motherfuckers can't see me, can't see. [Chorus]"

I'm the villian that's creeping around corners. Like shorty you see them niggas creeping around, warn us. We might be coming through, gunning through, running through. So be careful what you do. Or the slugs might come to you. As long as I can remeber, the streets have kept me safe. And ever since that time in December, the heat's been in my waist. I need an extra set of eyes so I keep my dogs with me. Doctor says let them die said his fucking dog bit me. I don't know whats wrong with me. But it seems like since you heard of us. Y'all niggas turning into murderers. Couldn't fuck with a third of us. Still against me. And wanting to see me in the box. Grilling me all crazy when you see me and the L.O.X.. Leave you Red like Foxx. Ain't nothing funny about that. I see you in a coma, ain't coming up out that. You hold on for too long and they ain't pulling the plug for you. I'll run up in the joint myself and bust another slug on you. It's murda. It's murda motherfuckers. Jay-Z:. I take a squat then post up with the toast up. I bring beef to a closure.

I leave bullets lodged leave you leaning on your broad. And our punks leave you gagged up in your car. Slumping Kennedy-style with your memory out. What the fuck y'all want?. Daddio with the calico. Let the gaty blow leave you bleeding on your patio. I leave rivals on their backs looking up at the sky blue. Not only do I leave you I hide you. I before you. X and Ja-Rule. Death before dishonor now and prior to. Boss man spy on you. Conspire you. Me die before you?. You liar, you. Niggas is dead off the hits I approve. Fuck it, I got the feds wearin wired suits.

Murder incorporated. It's murda. In crime we all related. It's murda. See if y'all can take it. Ja-Rule:. I'ma murderer and murdering anything that moves. Through ya nine niggas. Straight do or die niggas. Caught up and fall victim to the worst shit. X, Jigga, and Ja as expected. Shot on the world and reflect it. Niggas don't respect it. So get it the worst way. Fuck with the wolves you get hunted like prey. Shot up in broad day. Now everybody want you. I'm feeling like: stupid didn't the inc. warn you the first time. It's murda. Whenever you see blood. It's murda. Lay you down for the love. That's us. Leave the lights on. Knife through your windpipe. Cause most of your niggas ain't cut right. You thinking it's alright. But it ain't. I'm paralyzing clowns up and down from the waist. Giving niggas facelifts and taking it. While making you bleed. And if I got a taste of the shit I'm taking more than you need. It's nothing but love between me, you, and these slugs. Hit him up wrap his body up in a area rug. Who holding the heat?. Who leaving niggas cold in the street?. Y'all know me, ya Co-D, Ja-Rule the O.G.. Niggas better watch me closely. Get a grip, it's hennessy that fuels all that murderin' shit. When I look in the mirror my reflection is killer.

See me in the dark whip. Better go call your guards quick. Better go hit the block and tell them bitches that shisty shit. Known the freaks face like that yellow bezel ice shit. Similar response. Yo that kid spit the nieces. Baby re-intise this. CD’s raise they prices. Make a nigga chain. Paid off in a different name. Maid think they got flame. Shade just hit the brain. Me and Ja fucked around and made the teams A list. Two niggas from Two sides. Like a 7/10 split bitch. Niggas if you hustle and stick ‘em. It’s your life. Bitches if your Fuckin and striping.

Running through hell wit no ice. It’s a sin. But I’d sell my lost soul to win. Go to bed and die. Then I’d wake up breathing again. Cause I’m all in. Even though shit ain’t right. I wake up sweatin my life every night. Help me. Is it the devil that going to get me. Or is it God don’t feel like being bothered wit me. So hard to hit me. This life a sacrifice. If I grow blind through the dark my kids gonna see the light. If I die young it’s cause a nigga too high strung. Got scary love for gun wit too much weed in my lungs. And still niggas screaming Ja the one. The chosen. The God’s only be gotten son. It’s my life. yo. Niggas if you hustle and stick ‘em. It’s your life. Bitches if your Fuckin and striping.

Cuz y'all pop shit nigga, I pop clips nigga. Hot, but not the black four-dot-six nigga. You know the Rule,. thug heart nigga. And I don't need no fake friends, broke ties, loose ends. There they go niggaz is at it again. Tryin to befriend the nigga that they claim they love, but hate so much. And really all we got is us. But fuck it, it's the same way they fucked me. Now I'm fuckin your broad in the back of a Humvee,. go figure I'll have your niggaz pourin out liqour. All because you fuckin with the Rule nigga. [Chorus x2]. [Ja Rule]. Take my life, take my mind. Take my heart, take my soul. Take my cash, take it all. But save me I'm throwing my life away. [Ja Rule]. Why, would a nigga with so much talent. Want to throw it all away to drugs and violence. I know not the answers but I ask the questions. Do all Muslims really study their leasons?. And how many Christians lie during confessions?. I know I did when I was just a kid. Never told about the guns my uncle hid. Under my bed, and at night I played with them. Kind of grew up to be sort of a loose cannon. Before my sins, I'm asking you to let me in Lord help me,. I been through all the pain. Now I wanna know who loves me. [Chorus x2]. [Ja Rule]. Changes, changes My mind is going through. Changes, changes My body's going through. Changes, changes My life is going through. Changes, changes. . [Ja Rule]. Yo, looky here I just wanna fuck all day, live my life. Get high all day, my life. Maybe one day, I'll live right. Fuck the world, it's my life. [Chorus x4]."

I pour out the liquor for (ohh). I wish I wish I wish for (yea). For all my niggaz that's dead and gone (ohh yea). I'ma see you when I get there (life goes on). They say kill or be killed's the only way to live these days. So how come only my hood niggaz live this way. We put together the puzzle but still stuck in a maze. I put it all in perspective cause I'm coming of age. 28 and I see more niggaz go to the grave. More mommas in pain. More murals wit names (ey). Sometimes you look to the Lord to blame. And pray everyday wishing that things could change. Cause I'm just wishing you was here my niggaz. Wish that you could be wit me to ball my niggaz. Send a sign I'm on call niggaz. Promise to pick me up if I fall my niggaz. The way I wish y'all was still alive (I know). Through memories y'all still alive (and I know). Through my eyes in my mind you'll live 4 ever. [Chorus].

Cause I'ma holla atcha I'll see you in the next life. And I'll still be that same nigga. Still doin thug thizzle. Wearing the same ol' Dickies. Then we can drink the same Henny. Cause back then that's how we did it. So how could I 4get it. My three daughters and goals out the doors. I lost in the struggle. My homie and my oldest brother. [Chorus]. What part of the game is this my nigga. Wish you was wit me in my 6 my nigga. While you was flipping them bricks I figure. I been flooding the streets wit hits my nigga. You told me give it my heart. I gave it my love. I gave it my life. But you was my blood. You bringing me pain dawg. But I'm on the grind. I'm trying to stay focused. I'm losing my mind. I'm missing you dearly. I wish you was here dawg. Fucking these hoes wit me. But instead I'm in tears. But when you passed it rained. And God's tears took away the fucking pain. So look man (ey). I can't cry no more. You died once and you can't die no more (no more) (shit). So they can't stop me now. The only way is if they pop me now. I'ma hold it down. [Chorus]. Damn. Y'all niggaz got me feelin this shit in here man. V- I miss you. It's aiight tho. Life goes on. No matter what. Life goes on, right?. I wanna say to all my peoples. All my niggaz. All my family.

The radio blastin' +Between Me And You+. But you ain't on the low with that freak shit you do. I thought you knew (What I do). Know I know (What you do). 'Cause it's been a good night, your head ain't right. Like Teddy P, let's +Turn Off The Light+'. And grind it out, takin' no times out. 'Til the sun come out. Bitch, when you find out. [Hook 2x].

me,"I know you niggaz ain't fuckin' with me. [Hook]. How dare these niggaz try to fuckin hate on me. Come out and make records sound just like me. But nobody does this here quite like me. Now let me tell a little something 'bout me. Pops tags, things fresh to death like me. Who pulls more whips out the stash than me. Y'all bitches wanna ride, c'mon it's on me. I guess it's my time, all eyes is on me. [Verse one]. Man everybody wanna rhyme like Rule, sing like Rule. Talk some shit to get they name on the news. Papers, haters never pay they dues. Always got to be in somebdy shoes. Walk with me, or ride this on Bentley. With the rims you can sit in. Or the Enzo with them TV's that's hidden. I stay in menages with various women. Huh, I'm just kiddin' that's not how I'm livin'. The realest, the nigga in the realest state. I got real estates in different states, go figure. Cause I ain't singing you'se a +Gold Digger+. But bitches, +you ain't fuckin' with no broke niggaz+. That's why I ride, ain't you see I put you on the CLS. We on the point your voice sound like sex, yes. There's no real way to stop me, that's why y'all copy. I know you niggaz ain't fuckin' with me. [Hook]. [Verse two]. Yea, I know, one more gin, bitch you better come on in. Relax a while, sip on hypno and henn. I like your style, you're so old school. In them Sasson Vidals, fiftyfour eleven. Reebok classics Remind me of '87 when. Niggaz was playing with blocks like little kids and. Even though we men we still big wheelin'. Still cop cribs, six beds, four baths, high ceilings. All of the art of drug-dealin' cause every mil. Is two for me, when it's all tax-free. Pray for God's children, all except for me. I'mma walk in the path the Lord has paved for me. One foot at a time, niggaz follow my footsteps. Put the world on my shoulders, leave one set of footprints. Man, y'all motherfuckers can't stop me, that's why y'all copy. I know you niggaz ain't fuckin' with me. [Hook]. [Verse three]. I know what niggaz to do right, can't do no wrong. And everything's alright, then lyrically goes wrong. No part to piss in, no shoulder to cry on. You get to thinkin' why can't we let by-gones be by-gones. Rule the icon, who killed the industry like iPods. Had these niggaz runnin' like track stars. Except runnin' backwards when I sit back rollin' the backwoods. Loadin' my trey-duece for them niggaz that act hood. Ridin' my six-duece uptown, I'm so hood. Bitches love the coupes when them doors swing upwards. Money long, I'm putting from the green like T-Woods. ?? is not to be confused with white good. White gold should never be percieved as platinum. And cubic-zirconia never gon' shine like diamonds. Cause, no matter how hard they copy, they still not me. Y'all bitch niggaz ain't fuckin' with me. [Hook]. *Enviado por ""Sekef"""

murder reigns,"Yea {*echoes*}. I feel the rain comin down on me niggas, heh {*echoes*}. When the sun gon' shine? {*echoes*}. My lord, somebody help us all, heheh {*echoes*}. [singer: repeat in background]. I think the rain is callin murda (Murda). I think the reign is callin murdaaa (Mur - da). I think the rain is callin murda (Murda). I think the reign is callin murder (Mur - da). 1st verse:. Dear Lord, can you, feel my pain. If you can't it's alright, cause I'ma live my life anyway. Just let, it, rain - on me. I feel, so free like a, cool breeze. And when the sun dont, shine. Fold up the mini-blinds, load up them lucky 9. hit 'em from behind. That's, my, life - and it'll never be the same. Never again, and the game is to blame. Don't get caught up in your Range Rover, pullin over. On the Westside highway shoulder, nigga I'll blow ya. like a windshield, leave yo' mind on the windshield. And have yo' whip through in windmills, that's what rain feels like,. when it's hittin a little harder than drizzlin. pickles flyin out pistols, gotta niggaz cryin they Christians. I can't believe shit has come to this. It's unheard of, now it's gonna reign down murder. [Chorus]. I think the rain is callin murda (Murda). I think the reign is callin murdaaa (Mur - da). I think the rain is callin murda (Murda). I think the reign is callin murder (Mur - da). 2nd verse:. God only breathes to confess to them, bury the rest of them. A storm is comin, I got a hundred mile runnin head start. On these niggaz cause it's murder for life. Drugs, bitches, the money be my only vice. But I'm livin life in the fast lane, doin the damn thang. In the Ferrari hard top watchin hard rain. It's a damn shame, no more games. No more love, baby boy I throw back slugs. Through your Green Bay throwback, I hits that up. And let you know where the reign is from. You ever heard of mixin whiskey with Jamaican rum? You get Biggie. Mix gin with a little cocaine, you got me. And my style is a little too savage to not be. Be looked upon as one of the illest to MC. Y'all niggaz want it with me? That shit's unheard of. Cause niggaz, now it's gonna reign down murder. [Chorus]. I think the rain is callin murda (Murda). I think the reign is callin murdaaa (Mur - da). I think the rain is callin murda (Murda). I think the reign is callin murder (Mur - da). 3rd verse:. Nobody loves me. Sometimes I wish the good Lord would come down and hug me. I take a look at my life, it's gettin ugly. And now I know that you all wanna slug me. I can get above it, it's my life and I thug it. Even though I live it close to the edge. I'm gettin closer to death, with every little step. that I take, and be awake of my last days. I hope the sun shines with a light rain. That would mean the world shared my pain. And now the world could be happy again, smile. Cause if I ever walk ""The Green Mile"". You can look at me and blame it on my lifestyle. What can I say? I was raised as an only child, lonely. Poppa disowned me, so the streets raised me. now call me crazy is not unheard of. Now it's gonna reign down murder. [Chorus]. I think the rain is callin murda (Murda). I think the reign is callin murdaaa (Mur - da). I think the rain is callin murda (Murda). I think the reign is callin murder (Mur - da)"

Y'all *Silence* gonna feel the flames and a lotta pain. Let me explain from day one its murda one with no gun. Taking income, makin bitch niggas run. The nine-one-one roll up nigga what. We got the four pund tucked, the Porsche look plush. Niggas get fuckin clapped and killed for flossin. That probly why niggas get killed so often. Nothin to live for type a nigga I did a bid for. Snitch bitch niggas that ain't built for war. Is it because we ain't got no love for thugs. And slugs for drugs, the worlds most murda'rous. Black Child, nigga you know how the fuck I do. Put two in you, then puff a blunt at your funeral. I might touch yo' click and fuck yo' bitch. But'choo never heard a nigga spit shit like this[Ja Rule]. Murder'a, inside must be hollow.

Kill us today or you'll have to kill us tomorrow. Murder'a, inside must be shallow. How does it feel to take a life...[Tah Murdah]. When I'm gunnin I'm coming on ??? shit rubber grip. Four shit on the sawed off, blowin the doors off the Range Rov' shit. Fo' sho' this, is somethin' we die for. And my murdera's I lie and fry for. Murda man, when the shit hit the fan. The plan formulate, for instance, fuck a percentage you need the all the cake. Put the four to snakes make 'em lay for raw. Fuck the game, 'cuz nigga I don't play no more. Size 'em up, nevermind if you ridin tough. Count 'em out 'til his eyes is puff, despising us. I got hungry thugs that'll tie you up. And they ain't got a problem with, snub nose revolver shit. We hard to hit, my mom's a Crip. We thristy niggas that'll rob ya bitch for the love of the chips. So when I'm soaking the whip, y'all niggas keep hatin'. Gotta stash where the heats placed in, paper I keep chasin. Motherfucker, uh uh[Ja Rule]. Murder'a, inside must be hollow. Kill us today or you'll have to kill us tomorrow. Murder'a, inside must be shallow. How does it feel to take a life of anotha. Murder'a, inside must be hollow. Kill us today or you'll have to kill us tomorrow. Murder'a, inside must be shallow. How does it feel to take a life...[Ja Rule]. Yo, yo.... Forever young this face kills so many all die, nigga must I?. Confess my sins, to the souls of the unknown, why?. Would you ever disrespect my niggas. We murderous engines that lead to lynchin's. Index, itching, ready to run up and hit 'em. Let the teflon spin 'em, they say ""look how Ja did 'em"". I a murder'a , Inc'ed and blood you know you heard of us. Murderers juts because we the shhhhhhh. Make a nigga much harder to hit with the ox. We can take it back, give me five minutes in the box. Or trade hot rocks 'til one of us drops. Nothin but shells and you can hear the shot for blocks. I'm giving 'em hell, while niggas steady hollerin' ""stop"". I spit sixteens with aim and continue to pop. Motherfuckers, what'choo want with this shit. The murderous I-N-C, nigga[Ja Rule]. Murder'a, inside must be hollow.

never again,"(talking). Uh, you make a lot of mistakes in life. Those same mistakes keep callin us back, pullin us in. What the fuck's wrong with niggas?. (Chorus). Never again. would I run down a road so dark and hoped to die,I cross my heart. Never again. It keeps callin, it keeps callin, it keeps callin. Never again. Would I run down a road so dark, hoped to die, cross my heart. Never again. [But the streets keep callin, they keep callin, they keep callin]. Never again. Will I look a nigga dead in his eyes and know he's dead wrong. And don't leave him dead where he lies, it's a fucked up world we live in. I'm tired of feelin the pain but ain't fightin the feelin. Niggas can you feel me?. 'Cause in this world I'm alone, and trapped inside this body that's out of. control. I'm hittin these streets daily. Know when I got babies to feed rarely seein 'em rarely. This game inhaled me, and like Christ on the stake, nailed me. God, please don't fail me. But it's crazy to ask upon the Lord for help. When I got guns to bust and drugs to sell. I see you in hell, muthafuckas, I ain't bitter. 'Cause I know snakes and snitches get it where they slither. My niggas, doin life in the pen. This gotta be what y'all thinkin, shit. (Chorus). ['Cause these hoes keep callin, they keep callin, they keep callin]. Will I make you cry baby. You know I lie, you can see it in my eyes baby. But the truth is when a woman's fed up. There ain't a damn thing you can do about love. What about us?. Why must our lawyers discuss. Who gets the kids, who gets the cribs and how we should both live. When I love ya, when we apart all I do is think of ya. But you think I'm fuckin everything that's walkin. Either skirt or the thong. It don't matter, 'cause in your eyes I'm dog-fuckin 'em all. I got a woman that's gone and a passion for bitches. If you lose one the other becomes your religious. So what am I to do but get the wind behind me. Ground beneath me, make it hard for hoes to reach me. 'Cause the Rule ain't easy. Babe, unless you're freakin please believe. (Chorus). [But the game keeps callin, it keeps callin, it keeps callin]. Will I think these niggas friends and they foes. 'Cause in this rap game, you never know, just let it go. If my pain is love, my brain's on drugs. And may all my hoes thug on. And keep these punk niggas paralyzed, from the waist down. I got 'em face down is the equivalent of where I'm at now. Over the top of y'all niggas. Just a little quicker and smarter. Enhancin the game makin it harder. For niggas that freeze again like Braxton. I be hittin niggas with thrillers like Mike Jackson. I'm a problem. Number one with a bullet, I keep it up in my gun. It's hollow so when I pull it it numbs. Your whole body. Give it or take a few seconds. You'll probably, be the same nigga to dick ride me. Never again would I close my eyes. And walk through the dark backwards blind. (Chorus). [It keeps callin, it keeps callin, it keeps callin]. Never again. (Chorus to fade)."
never had time (feat. jon doe),"[Jon Doe]. Between the lights and the cameras,. The trips from New York to Paris. It seems I never could manage to say that I, I never had time.

Living my life on the road, and every city is home,. I should have picked up the phone. And say that I, I never had time. [Ja Rule]. Let it rain, let in rain. Rain down on me. I've been really trying to be someone I never been. Trying to visualize something I never seen. And if I can't see it, how could it ever be?. I'm just trying to be more than a memory. I pray. Remember me, miss me when I'm gone. 18 months ain't that long. I need to get away from it all. The niggas, the bitches, the bizness. Like Drake say, the hardest part is minding your own. F*ck em all, bilingual, money call. I'm on the bitch with my feet up,. Money call. The sad part about it though. I wanted you to be here. I just never took to say so. I kinda think you was waiting on my call. I just never had time. [Jon Doe]. Between the lights and the cameras,. The trips from New York to Paris. It seems I never I never can manage to say that I,.

I'm here, but never there for the.... Especially know how we still do it.... So selfish, but so.... If there's anything you learn from this is. Don't let your feelings...

never thought,"[Chorus]. (I never thought). That you would fall in love with this side of me first. (That I'd be). Intrigued with the thought of the gift and the curse. (Without ya). And now your heart broke and it's making it worse. (Why Me, Why Me). WHY ME. (I never thought). That you would be involved with a nigga like I. (That I'd be). Scared to look passion right in it's eyes. (Without ya). And when you found love it was nothing but lies. (Why Me, Why Me). Why, who would've thought. [Verse]. What the fuck is ya hobby mami highway robbery. cuz u got enough jewelry on ya body to buy a Farari. i'm like Ruben i'm sorry but I dont studder. matter fact call me Frank Love cuz i'd love to fuck ya. she said slow baby dont rush. I promise if u be patient i'll let u tear it up. and nigga sho nuff. we decided to keep in touch with each other u feel me. I didnt know we'd be touching ??. i'm surious, and i'm so sincure. my object is to stay in the clear. cuz we find fuck and flee these broads round here. I done made so many women shed so many tears. sittin home all alone getting drunk off of shots of bathome. decided to call let her feelings be known. in a slurred tone, she said I always get what I want. and what I want is u, but I dont get it cuz.... [Chorus]. Girl our, situation is getting a little out of my hands. u calling me constant telling bitches that i'm ya man. I thought we was just friends conversating. gettin to know one another on a friendly basis. lets face it we from two different worlds that dont collide. but when they do the crash is more like a biz-omb. your favorite seasons bigati and mines is summer. u use credit I rubber band wrap my hundreds. what we got in common is minimal right next to nothin. and I think that's whats subliminally keepin u comin. back to the one u been fuckin but never thought you'd be fuckin. how often do u think about the awkwardness of it. I know u love it to say the least. and I aint just sayin that contrary to some beliefs opposites attract. and my track record is something to be expected. money cash hoes u know how it goes. [Chorus]. Who would have thought that something so simple would turn out to be detriminal. now i'm feeling like i'm caught in the middle. of this love triangle between she me and reality. reality is tellin us that we could never be. cuz I come from the streets and u come from a rich family. but I dont think that your family would understand me. it's the little things u overlook when you're around me. drugs guns bitches and needless to say. you're a pimp in your own way. baby you're makin it hard for me to look in your eyes and tell u to move on. i'm gone (i'm gone). but then i'm back again. money and good pussy's a fatal attraction for men. she hits me every night quarter past ten. and with every call her voice got a little more intense. now we involved and it really dont make no sense. so be careful what u ask for u just might get it biaaaatch!. [Chorus]"
new york,"[Hook – Ja Rule]. I got a hundred guns, and a hundred clips, Niggaz I'm from New York ( New York ). I got a semi-automatic that spit's next time if you talk ( you talk ). I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York ( New York ). I got a semi-automatic that spit's next time if you talk (you talk). (And I know). [Verse 1 – Ja Rule]. Yall niggaz is pussy, poonani, Vagina. Your +Monologue's+ getting tired, now it's time to ride. You're print distrified, you're no longer desired. So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire. I'm on fire, holly dipped in octane. Let each coast bang, let west coast bang. And Rule gonna bring the ghetto gospel. To every 'hood possible, pushin through in the sky blue. Back with the gods you now, preferably the 4 pound. Slugs flyin at the speed of sound. Tryin to catch the ears of niggaz that's runnin their mouths. I might get my Brooklyn niggaz to run in your house. I don't really understand what the runnin's about. But we're hunters, we take pride in airin our prey out. Leavin 'em layed out, dead, in just a sport. 'cause we ain't playin up here in New York. [Hook – Fat Joe]. I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Niggaz I'm from New York (New York). And you can tell the way the homie spit, That niggaz, I'm from New York (New York). I got a hundred ways to make a grip, Yes, I'm from New York (New York). And you can tell I get real ignorant, 'cause niggaz, I'm from New York (New York). (And this is how we do). [Verse 2 – Fat Joe]. Nigga I can see the coke in your nose. This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe. And I was just about to find god. But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage. And everybody talkin crazy how they're AK spit. But we know this investigatin, and they ain't spray shit. Not me, I'm the truth homie, got the industry shook like. ""Naw nigga, Joe gonna let 'em loose on me"". True Story, I'm bringin the T back. Even Roy Jones was forced to +Lean Back+. My nigga Dre said grind cook. Now we killin them Howard niggaz, who said I must of found Pun's rhyme book. Got bitches on top of the Phantom. And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn. Cook coke, crack, niggaz fiend for that. And you already know the x is where the team be at. [Hook – Jadakiss]. I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Niggaz I'm from New York (New York). +Ruff Ryde+, and +D-Block+ and shit, Niggaz fuck what you thought (you thought). And you can't take shit for granted, because life is too short (too short). I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Niggaz I'm from New York. (Aha, and this is how we do). [Verse 3 – Jadakiss]. I swear it couldn't be sweeter, Life's a bitch. Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich. It's guaranteed you gonna die, you might get missed. For maybe 2 or 3 hours, 'til they light their spliffs. And that coke will get you a long time. But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online. Wise has awoken. And you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open. I still hold a title, because I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles. Stick up kids, hoppin out with them old rifles. Just doin shit for nothin, it's so spiteful. Ha I'm just like you. Word that niggaz wanna murk you is in the air. A double shot of yak and the purple is in the air. And I'm not cocky, I'm confident. So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment. [Hook – Jadakiss]. I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Niggaz I'm from New York (New York). +Ruff Ryde+, and +D-Block+ and shit, Niggaz fuck what you thought (you thought). And you can't take shit for granted, because life is too short (too short). I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Niggaz I'm from New York. (Aha, and this is how we do)"

niggas & bitches,"[Intro-Ja Rule-talking]. Yeah...ha,uh huh. You know how we do(we´re gonna do how we do). Uh, uh, yo my nigga Cad what´s hangin nigga(gangsta shit). Nigga Terry what´s goin on nigga. Let me talk to `em for a minute(Murder Inc. bosses in the building). Yeah, haha. . [Chorus]. Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked. Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot. Cause it´s all about the benjamins and nobody ain´t doin it like us. C´mon what y´all want?. . Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked. Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot. Cause it´s all about sex, money, and murder. Bitches that burn ya, niggas with burners. Cocked and let go!. . [Verse 1]. Fuck all y´all motherfuckin bitch ass niggas. I´m talkin to whoever wanna be ridin my dick. And you know your gon´get it as hot as I spit it. It´s the Rule and nobody wanna be bothered with. If I hit `em in every direction with four fifths. Will expend like 45´s with compact discs(c´mon). It´s a disappointment to see niggas flip on Rule like they double jointed. When I´m one of rap´s anointed. Who else used to order it all on the dick. Like when I come through with spinners on the six. And got bitches bouncin like Ronnie in Tricks. But some whores in this game really don´t make sense. Bomb roof and via Cal´s and clonin Ems. But when bullets go through your film, we break your limbs. A horror show, yeah picture this. Cause I guess you can´t see it, it´s Murder again. . [Chorus]. . [Verse 2]. Rule I fuck with bitches in Manolos and thick Louie Vuitton logos. Cause I don´t love these hoes. I´m above and beyond everything that your seein. And I´m the only real nigga left rappin this freakin. If I could be one of the seasons, you´d call me summer. The way I bang the heater out the back of the Hummer. The bull just move like runners from city block to city block. Layin down the foundation for what´s really hot. Y´all niggas really not on my level(c´mon). I´m like slugs when they pierce the metal, you see sparks(what). My voice is a brush, they hear it it´s like art. And nobody can really tell the twins apart. I call one Nina, other one Santa Maria. I might roll up on your set, dump and lean ya. My bitch is cocked to bang men in Virginia. Don´t make me run up on ya, put a few in ya. . [Chorus]. . [Verse 3]. Yeah, yeah, yo, Murder´s outlaw, that guess I get a city´s a broads. So I push the Porsche high and truck to court. Holla at the judge if the judge made a bad decision. I feel like the nigga that triggerin guns with mittens. It´s hard to get done, I´m hearin that security runs. around 30K, if they don´t get hit with an AK. And found out that the security´s runnin another way. Like with me, it´s Murder, probably. If I could drop in to manslaughter get a bail and flee. Cause my downess says bitch up, let her handle the pick up. Snow cone the country leave no market untouched. Call me drugs if this is how they pushin us rafters. But I don´t do it cause I need it, I do it cause I want more. Definition is greed, I do it cause I want yours. And y´all niggas is teasin, y´all don´t really want war. But if you really do, your gonna need a lot more. . [Chorus-2X]. . [Outro-Ja Rule-talking]. Faggots, haha(Panna Banana what up). Yeah, shout out to my nigga 01(my nigga Holla, I see you baby). Baby, you know what I mean? My nigga Black Child(Joe, what up nigga). Big Caddillac, my motherfuckin partner my brother. What up Gotti, you know we gonna do these niggas. You ain´t got to pick up no mic either my nigga. I got this, I got these niggas Gotti. Holla back nigga[laughing]. Yeah, uh, yo my nigga Burns in the building. Blow somethin up nigga [fades out]"

one of us,"Well when I die, pacify, crucify me,. I rock the double cross,. ones for the soul and one for the body. if I’m built in God’s eyes, I wanna see God cry. real tears from a burnt out life for 10 years. I swear I got the devil in me with no fear. if I hear I can’t see, if I see I can’t hear,. it’s an eerie little thing between deafness and blindness. weakness and kindness rejects and promise. my mind when I’m hollering dear Lord take me. cause I ain’t really happy here can you blame me. this game done changed me made me an animal. I can’t even laugh no more my kids smile for me now. I’m the first and only my mammas only child. Lord save me before I go crazy. cause if you live through the strain just to die from the pain. tell me would you believe that you can breathe again. If God was one of us. would he sin and love to lie. I wanna. know if God was one of us. would he frak and live his life. I wanna know. if God was on of us. would he use his name in vein. I need to know. if God was one of us. would he believe that could breathe again. Now lets look at things through a right hand. what if you was that man would you run with him gun with him. would you undertsand the hustle and the strugglin. live amoungst dope heads raising your kids and running from the feds. we bound to bump heads. cause you living my life. all righteous and you said living righteous was right. but there’s two sides of life. one dark one light if lighten up forever you could dim to the night. grab them guns over there and bring them on over here. cause my God’s bigger than your god down here. now we ride jets leir baby, bubble in Belaire. cause Rule and the Lord got it going on. been known to do bad shit I’m so heavenly but so devilish. shit if you live through the strain just to die from the pain. tell me would you believe that you can breathe again. If God was one of us. would he sin and love to lie. I wanna. know if God was one of us. would he frak and live his life. I wanna know. if God was on of us. would he use his name in vein. I need to know. if God was one of us. would he believe that could breathe again. Now trade places Rule be spirit God be flesh. and lets see just how weak the flesh gets. now you call on me every night bended knee. until you start to realize I ain’t answering. now you hang up the phone Lord. pick up the chrome Lord. can I blame you Lord needing to feed what’s yours. got a wife that you love but you still lust whores. and I’m supposed to judge you on earth where its earthly. you might as well aim at the sky, slug me. cause I ain’t being a fair god, when life is so hard. I know every crime committed every little mistake. and still got love for you fair is fair. as long as you repent you’ll be good up here. cause if you live through the strain just to die from the pain. tell me would you believe that you could breathe again. If God was one of us. would he sin and love to lie. I wanna. know if God was one of us. would he frak and live his life. I wanna know. if God was on of us. would he use his name in vein.

only begotten son,"He who believes in Ja Shall not be condemned. But he that believeth not Is condemned already. Only because He has not believed In the man. And the only begotten son. My Lord. Chorus (2X): For he so feared the word. He left his only begotten son. To shed his blood. Show that pain is love. But I wont cry. Cause I live to die. Wit my mind on my money. And my guns in the sky. Yeah, Why would you leave somethin you love here to die. In the cold And it grows. Like a concrete rose. Beautiful ain't I. Till I withered and died. On the same streets you left me. And, screamin Lord let me in. I don’t know where to begin. Since I lost yo love. But then again your love. Was strictly for the drugs. I don’t know whether to hug. Or to fill you with slugs. Fuckin them hoes Instead of claiming whats rightfully yours. Holdin my heart from all the pain you caused. With no direction you left your first born lost. Give or take a few. Cause my hate for you. Grew, over the years Through blood, sweat and tears. I wanted to be just like you. My father figure now I want to fight you. You bitch nigga You left me alone. And parts of me never out grown. The fact that left home. When moms was so strong. Don’t let them get you fed. This world is yours she said. Now nothin that stoppin me but two to the head. In life theres more to come. When its all said and done. You lost one love. Your only begotten son. Chorus (2X). But what a nigga live for. And damn ready to die young. I’m the shadow behind the gun. Look st what I’ve become. The fear of many niggas. The floss of most bitches. The love that runs deepest In the hearts of street niggas. Raised in the ghetto. By the ghetto. Was taught young to pop the medal. That’s how shit get settled. Learn to cook up the coke. Never leave home without toast. Learn to fly my bitches with birds not coats. Never trust ya. From a tight blood to hustla. I was trained as a youngsta. To cock back and slug ya. Love me or hate me. Ya only son. Let me live or kill me. The chosen one. Ja, under the gun gotta kill ‘em for show. If you want it you gonna get more then you askin for. Lifes got more to come. But when its all said and done. You lost one love. Your only begotten son. Chorus (2X). I wanted to be forever yours. Lookin now but nothin wrong. Two souls. Lookin to meet at the cross roads. I burn the hydro. Lay back with my eyes closed. In deep thought like Brittany is somethin I’d die for. Well how the fuck do you sleep at night. Knowin you wrong the only thing you ever did right. Despite the loss I stretch the length of a short. Now I got a new father whose name is New York. Runnin wild in the streets In heat we don’t talk. Cause when its cold you basically live life in the dark. When light would shine from the heavens. And bless one Ja Rule loved. Your only begotten son. Chorus (3X)."
pain is love,"[Chorus: Ja Rule]. Love don't love me. Is the only thing that seems to hold me. God can you explain why. Love don't love me. Is the only thing that seems to hold me. God can you explain why. [Ja Rule]. I sit alone in my four cornered room staring at candles. Gettin hot tryin to handle, this hand that's been dealt to me. I don't need, especially in this world overwhelmed with greed. See we cut from a different tree. Y'all niggaz hope and I wish a nigga would fuck with INC. Went through the troubles and the struggle of hustlin and runnin (what). So the ones that come behind don't' run through nothin. They would fear no man but God and do a lot of frontin. And I'm here to tell the world that pain is lovin'. Like when I die I hope it rains. Cuz if it does, that mean the lord shared them niggaz pain. Here lie our man slain. And I would get out the game if I could. But I promised all my life to my kids I'd make good. Can't stand my father and love my momma. STILL I TRY, God can you explain why. [Chorus]. [Ja Rule]. I live my life under pistol, cuz lately love ain't been a issue. With who's gone miss you, when you dead and gone. Will my name live on? Or will I be the last to die and breathe and eat. Cuz I need a little love and affection and baby. I live like every day was my last one. Dang, I've been living my life... (haha, yea). Like I'm a leave this world unmarked, smiles combed to horror. For all them days when it rains. And it feels like thangs ain't gettin no better for me. Nobody loves me, sometimes I wish God could come down and hug me. And wipe the tears from eyes. Cuz in my heart I know only the strong survive. And I die for my family, so they can live a better life. I try, God can you explain why. [Chorus]. [Ja Rule]. I'll sacrifice my life, fuck all the dumb shit. Cuz being black and broke's gettin redundant. My grow to be a world leader like X and King. If I can live a longer than Pac and BIG. What do (?) niggaz run red, you could tell by the lives we live. If it changes it'll be God's prediction, so pain inflicted, like Jane's Addiction. Live right like Christians, but dance with the death. It's like callin' stones a devil, the road is unlevel. Still I walk through the valleys of shadows of death gasping for air. Breathe in my last breath. My daughter told me first words, my son walked his first steps. And all through life we anticipate death. And if pain is truly love, for my family I DIE, God can you explain why."
parachute (ft. leah siegal),"When you play by the rules of the world. The world will rule you!. When you play by the rules of the divine. You will rule the world. Bring back ?. [Chorus:]. All the way from Heaven to the stars. The stars pass along,. The moon turns to sky. The sky turns to you. I?m falling, I?m falling with no parachute. I?m falling for love with no parachute. All the way form the heaven to the stars, to the moon,. to your heart. We only fail to get up to you. My world is new, I put it on the cross. Get thanks to the Lord, the legendary fall. Fuck you, no pause, niggers make God bless us all. ? form the.. to the roof, to the head, to the floor. ..it?s a long fall and a lot of nigger fall short. And? a lot of niggers fall off. But not me, I could never see the ball drop. Unless is new year in the heart of New York. If you?re new to the block, get a little rough. Especially if the heart ain?t wide enough. Cause I?ve been through it all, and it?s even more. Only? niggers get the fall.. [Chorus:]. All the way from Heaven to the stars. The stars pass along,. The moon turns to sky. The sky turns to you. I?m falling, I?m falling with no parachute. I?m falling for love with no parachute. If I get it? from the Heavens above to the fire to my ass. Nobody surpasses death, it don?t lasts?. ..now you .. kill me. I?ve already been dead, I?m a wholly spirit. Watch my flow fly around like a G6. While my body stays down in the audience.. I?m living this life limitless. If it ain?t fly has no relevance. If it ain?t domestic, it?s not intelligent. You should be smart and jump of the?. The dark side, is a long ride?. Just to been through it all, and to see even more. ..to fly, the niggers get to fall.. [Chorus:]. All the way from Heaven to the stars. The stars pass along,. The moon turns to sky. The sky turns to you. I?m falling, I?m falling with no parachute. I?m falling for love with no parachute. I?m thinking of you. With no parachute"
passion,"[Chorus]. Nobody loves me. Sometimes the world can seem so cold. Looking through the windows of my soul. I see, the true fan now I know (I know, I know, I know). Y'all gotta love me. When the weight of the world was on my shoulders. You were there. When it got heavy, I held it. You were there. The ones that stood by me like soldiers. You were there. I know you love me. [Verse One]. But I'm still waiting for the Lord to come hug me. Send a sign or somethin'. This is all for nothin'. The talent and Passion of mine. I'm sick of sufferin'. I know your plans is greater than mine. So I'm asking. Why do you want me dead or alive. And how could you let the people see me through the enemy's eyes. Like, jealousy, envy, Feds wanna convict Gotti. I'm thinking probably we was gettin' too much money. Too many niggaz in whips sittin' on 20's. Too much connections to the streets, y'all niggaz doin' somethin'. And after overall assumptions, or it's all or nothin'. Ain't nothin' stopping the second coming, except the coffin. I may be incased, but even from there I still touch 'em. niggaz ??, that's why we still hustle. For all my niggaz that can't be here. For every tear, send my a prayer, I swear. [Chorus]. [Verse Two]. But what's love, when your friends become enemies. Your nightmares are no longer your worst dreams. And as bad as everything seems. Keep hustling. We gon' get it by any means. How unfortunate, January the sixth. Federal officers, raided our offices. Making it hard for us to eat, and breathe, and live. And they swear they got niggaz asking for relief. They've been handin' down indictments for about a year. And they send nobody to jail yet, we still in the clear. And the Bible that said, ""Thou shall not fear no man but God"". Whoever said that, ain't never faced the law. And why all this fake ?? going on. I'm fighting niggaz, swingin' back against the wall. That's for my niggaz that can't be here. For every tear, send my a prayer, I swear. [Chorus]. [Verse Three]. How could you hate me, why would the Lord forsake me. Put the weight of the world on my shoulders. I thinkin' I could brush it off and nobody notice. Keep raisin' my kids: Britney, Jeffry, and Jordan. Keep coppin' new whips: Bentleys, Benzes, and Porshes. My niggaz, and my fans is the only thing of importance. It's crazy how the world turns. Sometimes, you gotta light up and let it burn. Sweep up your ashes, put 'em up in a urn. On a mantle from memories. I hear you callin' me, Lord knows you love me. The Passion of Rule is so real, just lend me your ear. You'll feel what I feel, you'll tear when I tear. The vision's real clear, just look in my eyes. I believe in putting my life in the hands of God. For all my niggaz that can't be here. For every tear, send me a prayer, I swear. [Chorus]. [Outro]. You know..... I give love to all my niggaz. Murder Inc. fam, my nigga Gotti, what up nigga. I nigga Prim, we with you niggaz. Been with a nigga, roll with a nigga. My whole carreer and shit.

(x2). HUH, you feelin hot tonight well look it here lil' mama we could go outside. (x2). [Ja Rule]. Certain niggas need to be kissed in the ground that I walk. Shuttin up when I talk, its Rule in full floss. 5-0 is tellin him X marks the speasy. How niggas gettin dis money, it can't be this easy. Believe me, I see between cracks and crevices. Angelic and devilish, who thinks better than this. The shell love and angel live in the darkest angles, this is Rule here. I'm cockin back I got an idea. (Chorus). [P. Williams]. Yeah, you feelin hot tonight. well look it here playboy we could go outside (x2). HUH, you feelin hot tonight. well look it here lil' mama we could go outside (x2)."
pray 4 the day,"[Intro/Chorus: Leah Siegal]. Pray for the day, your pain goes away. And for the time, wasted on goodbye. Can't get back the time, but you stay on my mind. Forgive me for the lies... and all the tears you've cried. [Ja Rule]. Yeah; so I pray, every night for a better day. It's like the world's Ike and I'm Annie Mae. But ain't no bitch here, though I shed so many tears for ya. Only cause a nigga care for ya. I'm talkin 'bout the world over, wake me when it's all over. I don't know if it gets any colder, or any warmer. I'm weak but I'm gettin stronger. Forever young but I'm gettin older, lend me your shoulder. But I don't wanna cry on it. But at times I feel a need to lie on it; closure. And some things will never change. I could be last but still way ahead of the game. I do my bid to go hot like 'Pac like Wayne. like Rick like Ray even muh'fuckin James. I'm just sayin, (Love Is Pain). And all I ask of y'all is keep Rule in your prayers. [Chorus]. [Ja Rule]. Yeah... hope to see you when I get there. Mile high heavenly skies will be a breath of fresh air. G5, nobody on my plane cause it's private. on my way to St. Elsewhere. I swear, I know they say the good die young and. I guess that's why I'm so scared. But I refuse to die and I won't die. until history records my greatness, Amen. I see angels, I see demons. I hear laughter, people screamin. Makes me wonder what's my reason for being here. And so I'm kneeling. [Chorus]. Pray for the day, your pain goes away. And for the time, wasted on goodbye. Can't get back the time, but you stay on my mind. Forgive me for the lies... and all the tears you've cried. [Ja Rule]. Sing a prayer for me. But don't nobody shed a tear for me I'm dyin inside as it is. If, lonely is the way of the walk. Then, I'm practically lyin in a coffin. How often do you tell someone you love 'em?. I bet not as often as you say you love summer. And it's gonna be the coldest winter ever while I'm locked up. CL and A-Team, one love and fuck fame. [Chorus]. Pray for the day, your pain goes away. And for the time, wasted on goodbye. Can't get back the time, but you stay on my mind. Forgive me for the lies... and all the tears you've cried"

r.u.l.e.,"[Intro]. Yeah (yeah)...Yeah (yeah)... You Know (you know)...Lets (lets)...Go (go)...(laughter). Yeah (yeah)...Yeah...WHUTS MY NAME?!. [Chorus]. They cool but they ain't R.U.L.E.. They do, but dont do it like me. Nobody, nobody, Does it Like R.U.L.E.. They do but dont do it like me. Nobody, nobody, Does it Like R.U.L.E.. [Verse 1]. Nobodys livin life the way that I live it. Nobodys spittin and doin it, I spit it. But who fuckin admitted. I'm one of the bigger biggest of niggaz that done did it. Been hated and delt wit it, when agents tap in my lyrics. So by the time that they hear it, the crime's already committed. Natural Born Killa, but that I'm already and then. Murdah was the case, but I-N-C's been aquitted. The Agency's gettin livid, They wanted us to be finished. But we got unfinished business, Sned God as my witness. This is another testimony to my life and my story. Askin you hoes, Why should I talk when I got guns to speak for me. Dont come at me homie, Especially tryin to act like you know me. Only if you can control me, Know where you been choosen befor me. To sit in ya grave, homie dig it, I'm hearin its lonely, But see. Nobody...Does it...Like Me! And they know it they cant spit it the same. But still they try, cuz thats part of the game, WHUTS MY NAME?!. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. These niggaz incredible, throughout the ghettos of America. People, see these window I see through. Off they mirror they evil, jealous bullshit that men do. Had I known it was you, there'd be no clue on who done killed you. Like when Kane murdahd Able, Niggaz must have been able. To put caine through they nasals, They so high they see angels. I see life from all angels, tangled, webs and weaves. Now niggaz is able to kill like Kane all over the streets. 100 degrees Ferenheite, hot as the hottest summer night. Heatin up desperatly in the need of some ice, I'm nice. Nobodys quite like, flow like rare blood types. I be wrong if I'm right, right if I'm wrong, I was the RULE born. When my legacy is left through my boys maiden name live on RULE. Niggaz is foolish tryin to do whut I do, Cuz see. Nobody...Does it...Like me! And they know it they cant do it the same. But still they try, cuz thats part of the game WHUT MY NAME?!. [Chorus]"
race against time,"In my race against time (i can't stop). Runnin' through the red light. Livin' my life. Even if I'm gettin too hot. I'ma keep runnin' through the red light. Livin' my life (2 times). God, why the hell am I here?. Is it a blessin', or a painful lesson. Of life and its directions?. Date of conception two twenty nine. I was birthed and won't be denied. Lookin into these eyes. And witness lives' tragedies. The boy who made slaves out of men, that's me. For every lock there's a key. The only thing that ever made me click was ""Cash Money"". So that I lust for. Be it one of my deadly sins. You know the seven. I got all of them deep within. Sometimes I slip, but you be there. Pick me up, now I'm on my knees like what's up. 'Cause only in a world that's corruptin' the sick. Could you dare to look at my life and call it innocence. Got me to a better sense. Cause whats yours is mine. Hear me lord, I'm runnin' out of time. [Chorus x2]. Nobody cry for me. Cause I, wanna see you smile for me. When I die look through my windows, to the soul. Tell me if you see Ja livin' to grow old. Cause too many niggas done died for what I hold. The talented warmer world. Which is so cold. Take me. Save me. Before I'm crazy. The only reason I live. Is for my baby. Never did you tell me that. Life ain't a game. Maybe if you told me this. Shit might be changed. But now I'm just racin' against time. Tryin' to survive. And see why. Ya niggas drive over 155. If you gonna live. Know you gonna die. If you gonna steal. Know you gotta lot. Get drunk and stay high. Don't de-nigga-ny. Cause they'll never take me alive. Feel me lord. I'm runnin' out of time. [Chorus x2]. I fears no man. But when its time to go. I'm gone. Racin' through the darkness. Learnin' what's right from wrong. Lookin' for the light. But all I see is the night. When everything else is bright. What happened to my life?. Is this what I am?. Is this what I've become?. A nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin and no one. Cold, even though I gotta burnin' desire within my soul. I must set this whole world on fire. If I control my destiny. Maybe one day I'll give this world the best of me. You know why I'm never the one to judge right or wrong. I embraced and showed you love. Then I throw slugs. At the other side. Go get 'em in broad day light. What a nigga would give to live my life. You don't want it. Cause if you could get it you would try. Feel me lord. Ja has arrived. [Chorus x4]. My life..."
race against time part. 2,"Yeah, yeah, uh huh. Race against time, ha part two. You know, haha,. Uh, c'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah, haha. Nothin like the future. [Verse 1]. Guess who's back to personify money, power, and bitches. But when bitches been gettin money, that when shit get ridiculous. I'm hittin switches like six fo's, bouncin and leanin. The west coast seemin, keep the fo' fo' demon. And the rock is all stashed up. Roll up a little diesel, keep it hashed up. Then +Holla, Holla+ at the whores, is hollerin back. Let 'em know a few facts like if your ridin, your back's slidin. This is the 'Race Against Time' and I ain't got time to waste. To give chase, I put a hole in your fin. But your head to the barrel like DJ's is spinnin. Backward, to blow off the backwood, I'm so hood. But what's really hood, when you ain't doin your hood. no motherfuckin good, and bein misunderstood. I would die if I could, Rule the lion. And I'ma keep ""ri-da-da-da-da-in"". [Chorus - 2X]. Race against time, I - can't stop. Runnin through the red light - livin my life. Even if I'm gettin too hot. Still I can't stop - ""Ri-da-da-da-din"". [Verse 2]. Bless the day that the God was born two, twenty-nine, seventy-six. This cocaine was heavily mixed. And all them niggaz had a fixation for bad reputation. For pimpin hoes, and shootin fo, to bring the free basin. If this is time erasin, the devil is runnin like Bettis. And got his guns out lookin for ways to behead us. You can die in a matter of seconds, so I'ma slow it down. Turn back the hands of time with the 40 Cal. Claimin your style is the realest, so I'ma define the meanin of murder, it's killer. You outta your mind, the burner's designed for the fill up. No gas, and when I spits like acid. smoke weed, but blow ether, spit ashes. cause young Rule in his prime like 'Clay Cassius'. Hated by the masses, but overwhelmed with love and passion. For when I die niggaz keep ""ri-da-da-da-din"". [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. If Jesus Christ was criticized, then why not me. What the fuck am I special, I struck a deal with the devil. Haha, every kid a prophet, which one seem like its logic. Me in church, or me in bed with bitches managen. I can chase like sergeant, addictive like heroin. Outsiders just lookin in, through a barrel that's pinned to the peep hole. They seein all or nothin like Jazz from Clisco. Hit 'em up and let's go, jump over the threshold. I just got married to bangin pistol, drugs and other shit. Feel in love with a bitch that I call crime. She reminded me that nobody can beat time. If you get enough of it nigga. So I looked her dead in her eyes and pulled the trigger. Thinkin that the music we feel would be somethin different. But this the same old criminal vibin. I ain't hidin, I'ma keep ""ri-da-da-da-din""."

Fold up the mini-blinds, load up them lucky 9. hit 'em from behind. That's, my, life - and it'll never be the same. Never again, and the game is to blame. Don't get caught up in your Range Rover, pullin over. On the Westside highway shoulder, nigga I'll blow ya. like a windshield, leave yo' mind on the windshield. And have yo' whip through in windmills, that's what rain feels like,. when it's hittin a little harder than drizzlin. pickles flyin out pistols, gotta niggaz cryin they Christians. I can't believe shit has come to this. It's unheard of, now it's gonna reign down murder. [Chorus]. I think the rain is callin murda (Murda). I think the reign is callin murdaaa (Mur - da). I think the rain is callin murda (Murda). I think the reign is callin murder (Mur - da). 2nd verse:. God only breathes to confess to them, bury the rest of them. A storm is comin, I got a hundred mile runnin head start. On these niggaz cause it's murder for life. Drugs, bitches, the money be my only vice. But I'm livin life in the fast lane, doin the damn thang. In the Ferrari hard top watchin hard rain. It's a damn shame, no more games. No more love, baby boy I throw back slugs. Through your Green Bay throwback, I hits that up. And let you know where the reign is from. You ever heard of mixin whiskey with Jamaican rum? You get Biggie. Mix gin with a little cocaine, you got me. And my style is a little too savage to not be. Be looked upon as one of the illest to MC. Y'all niggaz want it with me? That shit's unheard of. Cause niggaz, now it's gonna reign down murder. [Chorus]. I think the rain is callin murda (Murda). I think the reign is callin murdaaa (Mur - da). I think the rain is callin murda (Murda). I think the reign is callin murder (Mur - da). 3rd verse:. Nobody loves me. Sometimes I wish the good Lord would come down and hug me. I take a look at my life, it's gettin ugly. And now I know that you all wanna slug me. I can get above it, it's my life and I thug it. Even though I live it close to the edge. I'm gettin closer to death, with every little step. that I take, and be awake of my last days. I hope the sun shines with a light rain. That would mean the world shared my pain. And now the world could be happy again, smile. Cause if I ever walk ""The Green Mile"". You can look at me and blame it on my lifestyle. What can I say? I was raised as an only child, lonely. Pop disowned me, so the streets raised me. now call me crazy is not unheard of. Now it's gonna reign down murder. [Chorus]. I think the rain is callin murda (Murda). I think the reign is callin murdaaa (Mur - da). I think the rain is callin murda (Murda). I think the reign is callin murder (Mur - da)."
represent,"[Ja Rule]. I represent Gangsta Shit. Niggaz that spent time on the brick for keys on the strip. Loadin my clips, givin ass niggaz the shits. Life's a bitch, gotta murda to get rich. And infamous, that's when the game gets deep. Gotta re-up, cop heat and hit the streets. Now the feds is buggin me, D.T. straight fucking me. The whole operation shook, bitches ain't loving me. No more, see, I gotta make a switch. Should I lay low or run wild and stick shit. Ran up a team, that's striclty dedicated to cream. It's time to go outta town and wash niggaz clean. For everything they got, leave nothing to spare. But the shells on the ground when that ass is shot. And once again it's hot, but this time there's a snitch. Thought he was dead when he got hit in state Mich.. Turn states to evidence, we on the run. Reprisentin all illegal drugs and guns. [Chorus]. Where all my gangsta niggaz at?. Supply the town with coke and Hen(Hennesey) and cuban contacts. We keep them coming back, plus the one's that copped crack. Raw cut, overdose off the feedback, alone. Intoxicated from the Cognac, charge that Al Capone suite to Ammex. Valley to Lex, that black hand is on deck. We rollin in, peelin notes off of G stacks, We Murderaz. [Verse2]. This fuckin life's got me feeling like a lefty. It's aight, I'll go hard, make sure this world don't forget me. It's like my game's virtual, based on reality. I'm speeding like a bullet at high velocity. You think you stopping me, I think not. Ain't too many who known to do it properly. I'm likely to get so high like Tony be, toasted bein free. And trip out occasionaly, you know. Cause it ain't nothing for me to touch you. But for you to touch Ja, yet to been proved, I'm still breathing. Current age, those dopes wanna live, gotta get paid to do so. The average mind can't elevate and grow, calculate the dough. Analyze and invest where it's profitable, marketable. Billboards hot shot debut. Ja Rule Unstopable. [Chorus]. Where all my gangsta niggaz at?. Supply the town with coke and Hen(Hennesey) and cuban contacts. We keep them coming back, plus the one's that copped crack. Raw cut, overdose off the feedback, alone. Intoxicated from the Cognac, charge that Al Capone suite to Ammex. Valley to Lex, that black hand is on deck. We rollin in, peelin notes off of G stacks, We Murderaz. [Verse3]. Fear, that is my logic, the suit's made a composite sketch of this object. Blazing throught the projects, E.S. Lex coach edit, new shit. Got a nice connect, 12, five the brick, Heading o.t.. With this chick who like to slay, drink baby, snort coke and weed. Half Trinidadian and Vietnamese. She made a habit of calling a nigga daddy. Would die for me gladly, feloniously, I taught her well. Took her heavenly body and showed it hell. I made a lot of dought with her, she was my top nigga. Knew the rules to the game but painted her own picture. She wanted everything black and white. Never paying attention to the gray areas in life. Stayed up half the night, wondering is my dough all right. Is she high on the job, or maybe she's getting robbed. Quick picked up the mac milli, ready to get involved. Cause my .44 revolves around this. Fucking with Black Gang, all you get is hot lead. Muthafuckaz, cause you know that shit. [Chorus]. Where all my gangsta niggaz at?. Supply the town with coke and Hen(Hennesey) and cuban contacts. We keep them coming back, plus the one's that copped crack. Raw cut, overdose off the feedback, alone. Intoxicated from the Cognac, charge that Al Capone suite to Ammex. Valley to Lex, that black hand is on deck. We rollin in, peelin notes off of G stacks, We Live It. Where all my gangsta niggaz at?. Supply the town with coke and Hen(Hennesey) and cuban contacts. We keep them coming back, plus the one's that copped crack. Raw cut, overdose off the feedback, alone. Intoxicated from the Cognac, charge that Al Capone suite to Ammex. Valley to Lex, that black hand is on deck. We rollin in, peelin notes off of G stacks, We Murderaz...."

I'm not the only nigga that prays every day for forgiveness. This life is makin me substance abusive. The media always wants the exclusive. Well here it is - FUCK THE WORLD - baby cause they useless. Sometimes I feel all I need is my music. It fuckin sets me free, and let me breathe. Cause my niggaz ain't leavin they blood on the streets. for they kids not to eat, and they kids not to eat. REVOLUTION! Pick a side and draw heats. And may the best man hold his head on these here streets. Cause in life and in music I'm poised and I'm focused. And the world should take notice. [Chorus]. [Ja Rule]. Underworld ties, is where my heart lies. They do the drama, makin songs like ""Ol' Blue Eyes"". that make the whole world sing... It's alright if you don't understand me, it wasn't meant to be. Cause it's hard enough for me to fight for what I believe in. Then have to look in the mirror and see demons. Now everybody's talkin rhyme over reason. My only reason for rhymin is cause I bleed it. and come to leeches; they gettin paid. off my talent, my love, my pain - am I a slave?. Bein cursed in my own vain. For this life I embrace and I praise. A nigga stuck in his ways. As the remix plays. Rule and J. Blige, ""Rainy Days"". I think about life and music and how to stay focused. And the world should take notice. [Chorus]. [Ja Rule]. Hey, this is a message to mankind. I bust clearly to shoot blind, not in my right mind. Lord if you love me please throw up a sign. And take a nigga off the path of destroyin his life, hey. This life we're livin the sign of the times. Where buildings take on planes, babies born with AIDS. And we all need change. So I became a rock star bay-bayyy (rock on). Now they all gon' hate me (hate on). But from the bottom of my heart I pray. That in life and in music the world stays focused. And I hope you all notice."

Smokin weed, fuckin hoes, slangin thangs, that's the life I live. Even if I tried to go back I'd get lost (come back). And everything I seem to love I done lost. Fuck the world if they can't understand me. What else could I do? I had to feed my fuckin family. Yo' lies is my truth, so I'm a drug to your youth. And you don't want 'em nowhere near me, now that they can hear me. I spits razors, never been a stranger to homicide. My city's full of tote-slangers and chalk lines. Why do we die at an early age?. Nigga so young, but still a victim of a twelve-gauge. Feel the rage this world has bestowed upon me. And I don't give a fuck 'cause they don't give a fuck 'bout me. So I keep - drinkin Hennessy, bustin at my enemies. Will I live to see twenty-three? There's so much pain. [Chorus]. Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh.

But my, grimiest grimeys got love for me. They're blazin, sendin shotguns up above for me. My face in, Hennessy with no chaser. Coke rises on every way in - keep us hustlin nigga. Me and my man got a plan to get this paper nigga. So if you owe nigga, look for the gauge to blow nigga. I figured I'd be considered a killer. Doin crime excited my mind and leadin the blind. I, can't express my compassion, my satisfaction. for gettin fucked up and blastin - we all been there. Taught from young to shoot, show no fear and lie. And wipe the tears from yo' mother's eyes - so much pain. [Chorus] - repeat 2X. (""They'll never take me alive..."" -> 2Pac). Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh. I'm tired of the strain and the pain.

They got me mobbin like I'm - loc'd and ready to get my slug on. I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin gloves on. I ain't scared to blast on these suckers if they test me. Trust, I got my glock cocked, playa if they press me. Bust on motherfuckers with a - PASSION. Better duck 'cause I ain't lookin when I'm - BA-BLASTIN. I'm a nut and drinkin Hennessy. And gettin high on the lookout for my enemies. Don't wanna die, tell me why?. Cause the stress gettin major. A buck-fifty 'cross the face with my razor. What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone. I keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong. These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep. I'm real they can not see. And everyday is just a struggle, steady thuggin on the streets. And I be, ballin loc, don't let 'em make you worry. Keep swingin at these suckers 'til you buried. I was born to raise - hell, a nigga from the gutter, word to mother. I'm tough - I'm kickin dust up, ready to bust. I'm on the scene steady muggin mean; until they kill me. I'll be livin this life, I know you feel me. There's so much pain. [Chorus] - repeat 2X w/ variations. Ooooohhhhh, pain."
spun a web,"[Intro]. Love thy hater. You know they say everything we hear is an opinion not fact. And everything we see is perspective not truth. The fewer the facts the stronger the opinions. And opinion is the medium between knowledge and ignorance, bitch. [Verse 1]. I’m hoping in heaven got a ghetto. So when I get there I can tell you to smile whole hearted. I’m back where I started. I’m prisoner of my own success. But hardly caring enough to know that I’m dead without it. No cribs, no cars, no champagne. No bright lights, no bitches, no big stage. But f-ck it I’m in a better place. And I’m talking in third person in case you couldn’t relate. Diary of a monster. Sometimes my mind fades to a place not even I can explain. Cause theres a thin line between genius and insane. Guess which one I am, I think it’s obvious that. [Chorus]. They spun a web for me. They spun a web for me. They spun a web for me. [Verse 2]. Yeah, And I say that to say this. Man if life is a bitch I’m gon f-ck her then tell her that I love her. Not beneath her or above her but inside no rubber. Thats my interpretation of mutherfcker. No lie, no truth my life is a little bit of both. Who’s who, who knows anymore. My choice is to get it in real moist so I can come hard. And the world is ours, better yet bitch mines. Shot at the moon just to be among stars. Then God alienated it and ended up on mars. Serenity understand it extraterrestrial that I is. Think I do it all because it’s obvious. [Chorus]. They spun a web for me. They spun a web for me. They spun a web for me. [Verse 3]. Yeah, uh huh. Let me, I’m seeing my whole life ahead of me. And I’m feeling like this life can never be (naaah). Cause a nigga on a whole nother pedigree. I’m so far from home it feels like a million miles. And I’m long gone and ain’t no coming back. But really I never left. I’ve been silent yet at my the best. Ya’ll haters spread hatred like ?. And I still find ways to make crochet hearts. Like Kanye my 808′s is heartbreakers. Maybe me singing to your heats a mistake. Nah, Maybe I’m just before my time. Or maybe it’s just that obvious. [Chorus]. They spun a web for me. They spun a web for me. They spun a web for me"

It ain’t pumpin out the love no mo’, and I feel that. Where’s God when you really need it, where the love at?. That’s why a lot of niggaz got more faith in they gat. Freeze that like a photo, take it with you and know. This lil’ nigga bout to kill all comers for cash flow. His role model, the heat, cause it runs streets. His motto: ‘Nobody eats but me!’. Finally this young thug turned pro. Used to show love now he nuttin but hatred and foes. Five-double-oh’s, hoes so deep. He the type of nigga that got it and break down a key. Remember me? J to the A R-U-L-E baby. Smell beef, it continue to uhh, give em hell. Fill they bodies with shells and leave niggaz with a story to tell,. uh-huh. Listen I got a story to tell.

Keep the vibes and i stood my ground. They will never ever take my crown (let's get to the song). Who Jah Bless i say no man curse. Things getting better when they thought it would get worse. Here comes the officers asking for a search. They found no weapon just only a draw first.. Ja Rule. You know they can't keep a real nigga down (no). Not what they niggaz can even wash up it's federal. Comin and puttin snicthes on a pedestal, glorify. Had to put niggaz in jail fo' life, ain't no blood in they eye. But who, Ja' bless 'em with tha sizzla touch. Thing's gettin better when they thought it would get worse. I bomb first, and breath in the heat, knowin to hell I send em'. And I ain't talkin' devils or demons, just be happy ya breathin. And cowards get to hiccupin' and sneezin'. leavin every soul cold, and bodies more than a day old.

That's for all the hatin' niggas waitin' to see me go. Down to the bottom. Chop up crack. Playin' the blocks and. Still wouldn't matter, push the rock well like Stockton. Paper chasin', chasin' acres. Operation get rich, take money over a bitch. You see me move low in the six and magazines a flicks. Playin' hard in the porch, plush. Young thuggin' and bossed up. Touch niggas clutchin' what they know they bustin'. We can do whatever nigga, whenever nigga. Really is nothing. Murder killa, we crush 'em, shit. Got the industry on romadon. While we celebrate tastin' bottles of Perinon. So for life it's murder. Ice burners, stacks and trucks. We after bucks, mother fucker!. Murder INC.. [Black Child]. Murder INC.'s the underdog. It's a blessin' to ball. We learn a lesson from y'all. How not to fall. Black Child will body a beat, this is airway robbery. When Murder INC. drop albums, that's when gangstas party. What chu know about Ferrari or Cadillac Escalade. Or bitches on Ecstasy, sexy. Eat, sleep, eat and watch freaks eat freaks. Throw it up, put it down for the streets. Who wouldn't fall in love, with a life like this. Hittin' hoes that's priceless. In tight icebergs shit. You can blame the drugs. It ain't gon' change to slugs. A famous thug. Pain is love, mother fuckers!. [Chorus] (2X). [Ja Rule]. Who would've thought, we get away with manslaughter. Numerous cars, cribs off the water. A playa no longer, life's gettin' shorter. Tired of hoes takin' offers, instead of orders. The Rule don't condone this. Cause in the late '60's this game was flawless. Until blow got on the rise. Them ol' Jacks was slingin' pies in bell bottoms and buttonflies. But now, pop yo collars, blow set for sag. And we still fly birds L-A-X to Lag. They roll caddies with white walls, we ride Benz with mags. Still the goal remains the same, guard from feds. Y-D to O-G, the game chose me. R-U-L-E the INC. and I-G. We never gon' break free from this life we live as thugs. Pain is love, it's murda. [Chorus] (2X). [Ashanti]. You see the life we live, we on the murderous shit. And every time we breathe, it's Murder I-N-C. You know it's love to thug, cause thug is in our blood. And how we paint this shit, stay on that gangsta shit.

Representin the Stock Family. I don't really care how big you get pussy, you can't handle me. Won't say I'm the toughest. So I'll tell you right now when it's on, it's nothin. Shadow gettin to bustin. Every class at school nigga was special ed. Teacher got bored a nigga so we was all red. Twenty four with no diploma I don't really care. These cowards don't got it crackin and I'm out there. Lou we got the brown, Ferrari got the green. Smells caught in between, nigga doin his thing. What I'm sayin it's a hustler's pain. Bein rich by myself, it's a treacherous dream. Damn!. [Chorus - Sekou 720 - 2X - w/ ad libs]. Queens is back, Queens is back. Nigga Queens is back, Queens is back. Man Sekou ain't the toughest. I'll tell ya right now, when it's on it's nothin. 720 get to bustin. [Verse 2 - Sekou 720]. Oh my gangstaness. All the anger in my heart who we thank for this. Yo I can't thank a soul but God and guns. Don't kill a damn fool it's a animant's steel (drugs). It's the liquor and the bills cause a man to steal. It's the lack of Medicaid and these bitches got AIDS. And they snaggin at the Y, player we too high. I ain't really into ballin and tossin my chips (uh huh). Rather cop real estate then ride big whips. Rather trick on my wife and go real a dick or hips. Slick bitch that's strict man, she can't get shit. But she get trashed on the car hood by Hoodstock. We got good stock. and size does matter bitch, that's why we slang good cock. Back the thirty eight slug, back out (what what). Look out the way, 'fore your whole hood shot up (yeah). [Chorus - Black Child - 2X - w/ ad libs]. The Inc. is back, the Inc. is back. The Inc. is back, the Inc. is back. The Inc. is back, the Inc. is back. Black Child is gutter, it's on motherfuckers. The Inc. is back, the Inc. is back. The Inc. is back, the Inc. is back. Black Child is gutter. I don't give a fuck what I sell out with a gun motherfucker. [Verse 3 - Black Child]. I got stocks in the hood, sold rocks in the wood. Pop up on your block, with the glock like its good. Got niggaz scared to cop and drop like I'm Suge. Pop if you could, watch if you would. Nigga go platinum from the federal pen. Go 150 months, and come home gettin rich again. Nigga it's sicker than, I hope you listenin. Nigga we glistenin, pop off and leave you in the dead man position. Black Child is Murder, y'all forgettin. The work I put in, the dirt I done did. On this earth niggaz lives is worthless. Unless you worth a few million, school your children. Let the game get to 'em, then they brain get ruined. Mine speak foreign languages fluently. Hoodstock exchange ain't nothin new to me. Cop and go, set 'em shoppin up to Unity. I've been ticklin clit ever since puberty. Might taste it if it smells clean to me. Mama lean with me, holler and scream with me. [Chorus - Ja Rule - 2X - w/ ad libs]. The Rule is back, the Rule is back. The Rule is back, the Rule is back. Like 'Pac said ""keep your head up man"". Like Biggie Biggie ""give me one more chance"". Haha, niggaz. [Verse 4 - Ja Rule]. I +Clap Back+ just from my mental anguish. This cash is aimless, cop the new yellow Vanguish. And I ride swervin down the westside highway. Get high like a G4 on the runway. I can't land it man with gun in hand. A hundred grand in escrow tryna expand. A million niggaz that brick, whole bricks to grams. Just leave with money, its seems like its Uncle Sam. So keep (hustlin) I done roll that comes from all the pain and the (strugglin). (Look at here) federal agents (runnin in). Come again, it must be mistaken identity. Like when Oswald took the rap for killin a Kennedy. We in the street, not industry niggaz. And because we're called ""the Murderers"" that don't make us killaz, now does it?. Now it's not home but still them trumpets blowin. Hold on cause the leader of this mission is a pro."

The life, the life (the life, the life). The life, the life (the life, the life). [Verse 1 - Ja Rule]. Yo, what up world, it's Rule public enemy number one. it's cool, my new best friend is my pistol. And anybody that want it or got jewels run it. and end over your head, don't make me gun butt it. Do you like Manolo, put two in your stomach. And flash the burner on bitches like stacks of hundreds. I'm livin my life (my life), what gets better than ice in hell. When you cookin up coke to sell. It be the little statistics, some pictures, some prints. Some informants to get the operation pitched. We enormous, some would say the ""Inc."" is ""Murderous"". You don't want us to strap up and bang the strip. But if need be, we'll bang out like Bloods and Crips. Styrofoam the noozles and extend the clips. Murder meets gangsta shit. And all my niggaz that live it from hood to hood bang to this, nigga. [Chorus #1 - Ja Rule]. The life, the life (the life, the life ...). Whether your Blood or cuz we all gangsta. The life, the life (the life, the life ...). Whether it's dope or coke we all slang drugs. [Verse 2 - Hussein Fatal]. I'm the street's poster child. I'm supposed to wile. With the toast I'm foul. My Murder Inc. mob money, Oprah style. From here back to the block, they get that green. Known to put a hole through a nigga's shoulder soon as the beam glow. Probably graze you in the face, give me a break. I'ma rapper, out here to stay, don't make me do what I say. Just let me say what I do. Cause I'ma put it in a rhyme, everytime, about to spray up your crew. And I ain't lickin off shots to warn 'em. Just a pop swift to the dome, on the real ""G-Unit"" nigga, glock and all this. So believe I'm not the one when it get stupid in the booth. I told y'all with Rule it was a gun in this bitch. Now I expose how scary you niggaz is. And when you want the bis. My brick city outlaws' a bury you niggaz. I'm so cool, when I ain't doin my numbers. Let the .... [Verse 3 - Caddillac Tah]. Okay, motherfuckers when the bounce came to your waist. and shells get to droppin. you better duck, and get up poppin. Don't get left with the cops. Gangsta, yeah, put that work in. Put a nigga dick in the dirt. Lace shots to the face. Hopin it shut case, John Doe. Unidentified, I always hit 'em high when I dump and let it fly. Now once with 45 nigga I had a picture on top of the coffin. Murder Inc. bosses. [Chorus #2 - Ja Rule]. The life, the life (the life, the life ...). Whether your Blood or cuz we all gangsta. The life, the life (the life, the life ...). Whether it's dope or coke we all slang drugs. The life, the life (the life, the life ...). Whether your hoein or stuck up, we're still gon' fuck. The life, the life (the life, the life ...). Niggaz don't want it with us, cause it's Murder. [Verse 4 - James Gotti]. Okay you hard as fuck. but when the slug hit, you dead if your name ain't armored truck. Murder Inc., Outlawz and the Floys is here. Bang, bang, shoot 'em up, cowboys is near. Stampedin anythin in our way, we'll attract war. If your smart you'll slide over like handicap doors. I ain't a killer, I just spark a lot. So when I squeeze I'm turnin your whole block to a parking lot. Understand I'm the grimy Floy. Wanna trip to death then try me for it. Crazy since '94, that's why cats don't hang around me like Chinese stores. One step ahead of you, get more guys. You strapped with four fours, we pack four fives. Fuck talk get the chalk out. You'll be lucky if your able to crawl or walk out. [Verse 5 - Ja Rule]. I'm in the pop life. so when I pop up in your life, and I pop twice. Get down, I spits more than rounds. and niggaz bleed heavier than hoes on they period. This sound gotta movin ""Faster Than Furious"". But nah I ain't Ludacris. I'm here to let y'all niggaz know I ain't new to this. Gun butt your bitch. That's the way I get down, believe my style is Murder. Clap a nigga, dipped and hide the burner. The rule to learn ya bomb ya like embalmin fluid. Until your limbs feel a loss of movement. In the hospital in critical livin. Must minimal (who done it?) it's Murder. Yeah, that's subliminal. Who gets down and bangs with nothin but criminals (c'mon, c'mon). Rule nigga you know it, these others cats is pitiful. Bein a rap God is spiritual. Your God is Ja Rule nigga let's not get it confused, haha. [Chorus #2]."
the manual,"(Ja Rule). Yeah, yeah, yeah. You talk too much shit. You know niggaz always talkin bout bitches ain't shit. Money over bitches. But give all our money to the bitches any fuckin way. (I love my bitch) So I'ma send some love out. to the bitches, holla. (Verse One). Shit, here's somethin to remember. When we met that day in September. But, you've been gone since November. Had to finish out yo' last college semester. Her major - brokerage investor. She probably go broke tryin to invest her. time and money in somethin that she call love. Cause, she love fuckin with thug niggaz. That alwasy get high and had to be drug dealers. Eventually, she hooked up with some hood bitches. The hood bitches turned her on to strippin. Now the, gettin is good and it's well understood. That money on the wood can make things get harder. Be glad I'm not a pimp, if I was I'd charge ya. But for all that you go through, just thought I'd let you know. Hoes need love too, I'm fuckin witchu. (Chorus: Ja Rule). Niggaz need to read the man-u-al. To seperate your housewife from a hoe. Cause there's no rules to this shit here. Am I makin myself clear?. What she don't know won't hurt her y'all. So keep big pimpin on the low. Cause there's no rules to what I do. And I know, hoes need love too. (Verse Two). You know what they say right? Bitches ain't shit. And all men are dogs cause we just wanna fuck. Sundown to sun up, one up on a hoe. I might go down on the low, that's just me though. From L-A-X to Heathrow, I'm one of them niggaz. that really doesn't need no, introduction. When I met her she was ""Girl, Interrupted"". Grew up became a woman not to be trusted. Frustrated and flustered, living amongst. these thieves hoes and hustlers, I'm diggin what's next. She had a studio apartment in the projects. With her and her girl from D.C. used to bus checks. And hold the coke, her niggaz ain't sold yet. In hopes the copes don't know about all this. Shiiiiit, for all that you go through. Just wanna let you know, hoes need love too. (Chorus). (Verse Three). Fake nails, fake breasts, fake eyes too. It's oh-four, and that's kinda what we used to. But you don't holla back like you used to, but I ain't mad at cha. I'm happy for a bitch, even if I can't have her. I remember when you was down in Atlanta. Workin gentlemen's clubs and you didn't even know what a gentlemen was. Forty to love and I wanna serve. That body like Serena's with less curves. But actions speak louder than words, and you gettin your money. Mami every month, 15th and 1st. Shit could be worse, you could be in the struggle. Or born with no ass and have nothin to hustle. Go on flex your muscle, cause that ain't the case is it?. Go on get your paper keep flossin on these bitches. Cause for all that you go through. Just thought I'd let you know, hoes need love too, I'm fuckin witchu. (Chorus) - repeat 2X. [Ja Rule]. Ha ha ha, yeah, Rule"

the rain,"[Ja Rule: Talking]. We 'bout to do the damn thing, you know. Roll that shit up, pop that shit. Pass that quarter, nigga. Haha, it's the CMC[Chorus 2x]. Everybody wanna fly, hiiigh. Aim for the hills now. The Rain go drip on down, Sugar. All over you, heeey[Jody Mack]. Aiyyo, I figure if I'm goin out, fuck it, I'm goin all in. Straight to the, top of the world where it ain't no fallin. My inner self is warnin, Chris Black it's like chill. But you know about Jody, oh Jody get ill. But now here I go, fallin down the hill, nigga tumblin. Thirsty than a muh'fucka, butterflies rumblin. The sunshine comin in, my eyes still rainin. I'm focused real hard but the numbness remainin. 1, 2, 2, 4, 5 hours pain. Spend up the gas station, tank still for of gas. Oh Lord, it's what I'm in but I want it to stop. I got my rain coat on and really want it to pop. A nigga humble, but you know a nigga Jody won't eat. It's real crazy on the hill where the homies don't sleep. I seen a full moon, made a left, jammed on the breaks. Hit the curb, crashed and burned, damn it was too late[Chorus 2x][O-1]. I feel like I'm smok-in, cause the way you make me feel. Like I need - goin, I'm so open, I'm tryna stay focused. But I'm livin it up, fourth way model, bitches and up!!.

Everything is a blur, heart racin. Mind over matrix, Heavenly Father. Devilishly I really got a low key car. But it's harder then to pass, peer pressure in all the masses. When all the kids is goin on class trips, caught acid. Listenin to hard rock classic, bangin they head on walls. Then go blamin them for that shit. The mind could be hazardous, when it's influenced. By substance abusive music for people to go use it. But, I was alike, like a tint on a window. Everything is darker, just a little bit harder. So when the wind blow, I wistle in the willows. On the top of the hill, 'cause I know[Chorus 4x]"

[Case]. Thug life, everybody needs a friend. Thug life, we all got a space to fill. Thug life, everybody wanna be on top. Life, it ain't that funky. Yes he's got that dropping. Tell me, what's the matter with your bitch?. [Ja]. Baby, I don't respect shit, with diamonds and live reckless. Pushing the six, top speed, getting my dick licked. I'm childish, one of a kind, one of my own. I'm about to take these freak hoes to levels unknown. Touch a little, later on, fuck a little. The more resist the better, I'm in it for whatever. Feel me, I don't need weed to get high. Some good head make a nigga kiss the sky. No lie, but if she ain't right, turn the lights off. Put her on her stomach and fuck her 'til ya dick soft. The rules to the streets, love. I met you kinda drunk with a light buzz. I respect it cuz niggaz ain't shit, you right. Cuz every bitch need a lil' dick in they life. I betcha. [Case]. Thug life, everybody needs a friend. Thug life, we all got a space to fill. Thug life, everybody wanna be on top. Life, it ain't that funky. Yes he's got that dropping. Tell me, what's he puttin' in your mouth?. [Ja]. Nigga, ain't nuttin' goin' in need that's trail. But how told y'all 'bout how we gettin' it now. 40-inch screen nigga, rocks gleam, nigga. You a customer, and I love a fiend, nigga. Cuz just like the coke, cook up and come back. I load up the gat, tell niggaz to hold hat. Help me, what I do is a stick of genius. I study the eyes of niggaz who done seen this. Learn to lean on the mean, yeah. Coverin' my ground, paying attention to the cracks in the cement. It's on now cuz I got my vision together. What y'all thought? I was gon crawl blind forever?. It's now or never, curupt thoughts 'til I die. When you talk to me, motherfucker, please look in my eyes. See my life."
thug lovin',"It's on and poppin' baby! The Last Temptation! He's Back! Y'all know who. I'm talking bout!. Chorus:Bobby Brown. And I know you're gettin bored. Dealin with him,. I know you miss my lovin, my thuggin. Thug Lovin'. Verse 1:Ja Rule. I know you're livin your life, faithfully. Safe from me, away from me, but you miss being next to me. Don't you-don't let our love haunt you. Lust for what you want and go for your guns. And back out on anyone tries to interfere or intervene. With me peelin your wide body outta them tight jeans. Wrist on freeze, seats on lean, shoes 19. Comin through in that Bentley thang. The top of the town, the keys to the city. You and I make headlines like Lo, and Diddy. Bob and Whitney. I'm here cuz the Lord sent me, pound push like a fugilist. But I'm real devilish and freak that bad bitches, shit. But you-a different story and I know your. gettin bored and. And he ain't gettin you horny no more, is he?. When it's all said and done, it's me. Lovin, thuggin and I know you're. [Chorus 2x]. Sweet thang livin' it. Won't you let me let you live it a little bit. I know a stressful relationship is hard to deal with. But here's how you deal with it. On your weekly visits, use a code name. To protect the innocent. Maybe I'm too generous. Generally believin that all women want me. They don't wanna get even. But who do you believe in?. Is it money or God?. Betrayal or trust, sustain your vows. Secretly or sacred. Cuz I love it when you pop your body-body. Move your body-body. Drink up all the Bacardi. And roll up alongside me. I love too see you wild and free. But occasionally you get cold wet feet. And all that it means to me is that you need my heat. Cause when it's said and done you're gonna want me. Lovin', thuggin' and I know you.... [Chorus 2x]. Baby, here I'm holdin' your love hostage. The ransom for you, sugar, be priceless. Cause you been gettin' at me in many a ways. Now tell your man to watch his back and duck them strays. Cause I been in a rage lately. Hopin' God'll forgive me for all the sin and all the woman. All the drama I been in and it's just the beginnin'. I hope your watching so you could see that nigga ain't built. like me!!. The black sheep of my family. But we one in the same, that's why we get along. Freak off and get it on. When we make love lookin' somethin' like soft porn. Tell me, baby, do you really wanna go home to him??. But the brightest of your days just goin' look dim. Cause you fuckin' with a loser, baby, you can't win. When it's said and done you're gonna need me. Lovin', thuggin' and I know you..... [Chorus 2x]. Yeah, yeah, I.G, Ja Rule. B. Brown Murder Inc.. Def Jam, Sony. This is what we buildin' here. Murder Inc.. Ha-ha-ha. Bobby Brown. Murder. Ha-ha. It's that real. Rule, baby. Bring it back my, niggaz. B. Brown, ha-ha. And I know you're gettin' bored."
true love,"[Chorus 1]. Love has truely been good to me. Not even one second a memory i had. Since you came my way. I hope you know i'll gladly go. Anywhere you take me ain't no limit to this love. I'll follow you to the moon and the sky above. [Verse 1]. The first time i met you. I didn't sweat you. My Juliet i knew that i catch you. Gave you the key to my heart you unlocked it. A perfect match you the plug in the socket. As time moved on we became friends. I knew was love at first sight and it wasn't 'bout to get wit this. You was there when i needed you. I remember writing letters on the road i wanna be wit you. I know we young and we got time. Little soldiers need love so girl i want to make you mine. We could row together, go to shows together,. my best friend girl lets grow together. [Chorus 1x]. [Verse 2]. We could walk together rode busses together. Ya moms call us telling things we stuck together. We at paerks play hide-go-seek. I find you, or you find me. This was meant to be they call us little one and shorty find us hugged up at every school party. We study together, ball together, somebody said cupid must've brought us together. I love your cute eyes and you love my tight braids. Play video games almost everyday and when we not together we on the phone talkin' 'bout our. first kiss and we don't wanna be alone. [Chorus 1x]. [Verse 3]. And i remember so while how your smile made me feel bright like the sun shine i'm so glad that. you mine. You my Juliet I never let the jeolous ones in between and thats a safe bed and we could get the. study in after school is over homework is a must so we can come over and have the words we could. hit the mall zip ices and cotton candy and after that come chill wit the family.

I can't even cop a drink at the bar. Get me some bottles of that Remi Mar-tin. Let's get the party. Cracking right here fuck V.I.P. Now when my baby loves me. Home wit tears in her eyes. And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin her lies. She ain't surprised at me. She just surprised that we. Been together for this long. And I can be. The one to mistreat her. Thought it last forever. Cuz if I cry, you cry. We cry together. [Chorus]. [Ja Rule]. From, what I recall we was little niggas. Cuttin school gettin high wit da hottest bitches. Livin, life so free, that we ain't fearin. The, ills of the world, in heat of drug dealin. You and I then made a killin, and stuck together. In this land of forbidden treasure. Love is the only evil seed that could sever. A tie this close. Not the love between us but your love for the dough. You went O.T. started makin M-O-N-E-Why. All my good niggas gotta die. But shit could last forever, I wish death was pleasure. Cause when you died, I cried, we cried together. [Chorus]. [Ja Rule]. Wash away your tears (my love). You ain't gotta cry no more (my love). I put it on everything that I love. And my pain it's my love. And I want, this world to smile for me. Don't shed a tear cause the nigga died happily. My momma warned me life was a motherfucker. But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin. And every night she just looked at me. Tears in her eyes and they be saying shit like. ""I don't want me baby to die"". Brought so much pain to her life. Gotta make it better. Cuz when ma cried I cried. We cried together. [Chorus]. [Lil' Mo]. Oooooohhhh. You cry, then I cry. Then we cry. When he cries. I cry together, together. When I cry, then you cry. Then we'll cry, together. Baby, cuz when. Ja cries, Mo cries. We'll cry, together. If he cry, I'll cry. Then we'll cry, together."

where i'm from,"[Lloyd]. Umm hey, comin from Where I'm From (I'm from) ohhh yea. [Ja Rule]. Kids get killed in ghettos, shot up over the car limos. While they mom was at home, tears hittin the pillow. Where women in the middle in a serminal funereal. Shed a tear cause he lost his son the same way a year ago. It's the same egospiritual, we thuggin in harmony. They say death brings life, there exchange no robbery. If I'm wrong pardon me, me I'm just tired of poverty. Why them niggaz in the hood never hit the lottery. Unless they go lottery, first round in the draft. First we dustin off the rounds and we slip in the mag'. Then we slip on the masks, and go out and mash. And we call it feeding our family. Ya'll call it a tragedy, Damn. How I could just kill a man. His blood flow like a river and rinse his blood off of my hand. If you hearing me speak please Lord give me a chance. Please forgive me of my sins, cause we cleansed where I'm from. [Chorus] - [Lloyd]. Me and my niggaz ride. Even when the sun don't shine and its cold outside. I never run in or hide, cause some niggaz hate it. But I can't get faded cause I done made it. Instead of struggling or strive. Survive my weight how these ghetto streets of mine. This is coming from Where I'm From (I'm from). We all walk back in line (yeah). [Ja Rule]. Now everybody know that everybody said nobody can hide from beef. Except but us, who surprised when these kids get killed on the streets. Look how these animals eat that's how they talk bout us. While they shed they joke and laugh puttin a choke round us. Can I get a moment of SILENCE. Cause they claimin it's the niggaz that's causin all the violence. What bout the ones that protect to serve our honor. Poppin the blue colla', with shots soon to follow. The ghettos in horror, cause in this boy shot went back. And now the neighborhood hot and he can't move the crack. When it's all about the dollars. And he'll individually get murdered cause money is power. But then these snitch's get to talking and it's colder than ours. Cuffed and crimed on the bus heading straight to the Island. He was only 13, but tried us in the dope and as high as the coast. Cause ain't no more children in the ghetto where I'm from. [Chorus]. [Ja Rule]. We ain't all killers in prison. Matter fact that's a stereo typical thought of livin. Cause they don't know about the hood and them love in it. Summer time top down with the wood finish. Pushin hard uptown windows slightly tinted. Back to back Benz and jeeps, blowin weed with my niggaz. On our way to a house party, gonna fuck with some bitchs. Let's get some liquor for shorty who said she make us some chicken. And if we get 'em drunk enough we probably could freak em, and do it every. other weekend. If I don't have to kill niggaz, I never would leave the ghetto. I'm like an angel that put on a halo, cradle the grave of my niggaz that we. lost in the ghetto. Cause where I'm from in the ghetto we rock white tee's and nike's. Roll 3 dice and name our dope ice cream. Set trends and ya'll follow our lead. But in New Yitti niggaz follow they dreams, where I'm from. [Chorus]. Now I lay me down and sleep. And I pray to the Lord, for my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake. Pray to the Lord, for my soul to take (Pray to the Lord, for my soul to take). [Chorus till song fades out]"
