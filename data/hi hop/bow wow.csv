my baby,"[Verse 1]. It was the summer 2001. All before the drama begun. When we first met. I seen you sitting out on your steps. You was broke down crying a mess. So I interferred. I asked what's the reason for tears. I was wishing you could tell me your fears. But I'll start with ya name. You told me how ya man playin games. So I said that it was time for a change. And you just laughed. But it looked like you aint laughed in while. I was glad that I could give you a smile. Then we both blushed. But really girl it aint no rush. I was thinking maybe that we can discuss. A future for us. Cause homeboy just got you crushed. You need to leave that clown in the dust. Trust. I just wanna talk. I'm thinking I can give you a call. And we can pick it up. Where we left off. I'll holla tomorrow. [Chorus]. Girl I understand you loyal to ya man. And that's alright aww baby. But that dont change the fact. That you fine and you stay crying every night nah baby. Girl you got to let him know. You can't live like this no more. Nah baby. Cant see. Together you and me could be so special ah baby. [Verse 2]. Our feelings get greater. A million days later. Talking all night we stay up but. Here comes ya ex. Returned with that drama and stress. All the nonsense that you just left but yet. You except and go back to try it again. Then return with a broken heart. That I gotta mend. That's unfair. I've only been your lover and friend. Homey there he just front and pretend. But you dont care the life he leads. Is unsafe. I would never place my hands to your face. But still I chase. Cat and mouse. First you kick him out. Then you at his house. What is that about. I cant figure you out. Even your friend said I was better. But you listen to them. Never like uh-uh whatever. So the next time he hurt you again. You already knew where you should've been. And that's with me. [Repeat Chorus]. [Verse 3]. All the times. You 2way telling me. That you miss me. Wanting me to come over and keep you busy. Remember that. Now that you gone. It's been kinda hard. Cant think, cant sleep. Cant do nothing at all. Just tell me why you had to go back. See you aint have to go through that. My baby. You could've been here right by my side. Me and you at the park taking walks outside. But. Instead, I keep on having these dreams. Waiting for my phone to ring. My baby wishing that it would be you But I know that that wont come true"

Strike one, caught you by surprise. Strike two, right before your eyes. Pitch three, this one's to the wall. Ain't no fun game like a game of Hardball. [Verse 1: Lil' Bow Wow].

Bubble gum cards and all the posters. Y'all know, how I roast ya when it's time to compete. On the field, on the court, over any hot beat. or break, and you know it when you see your clone. And right now that's all I see goin on, holla at me. Game time, all I think about is bringin home the trophy. If your team is better mine, you really gotta show me. Really gotta beat me, really gotta trash talk. Mistreat me, and send my squad back home. Cause I don't know lose too much. Matter fact, I ain't never lost at all. When I'm playin Hardball (that's right). So, if you on the mound about to pitch to me. Understand I'm like Griffey, I keep 'em to the wall. [Chorus 2: (Sammie)]. Strike one, caught you by surprise. Strike two, right before your eyes. Strike three, ohh I got you out. Without a doubt, I got you out. Strike one, caught you by surprise. Strike two, right before your eyes. Pitch three, this one's to the wall. Ain't no fun game like a game of Hardball. [Verse 2: Lil' Zane]. This goes out to them jocks that stay on my jock, throwin the pop. Keep pitchin, I'm in the kitchen makin radio rock. It's usually preferred, I be choosy with all my words. Throwin eggs at them chickenheads, beggin on the curb. Direct from my burb, a fast baller with a curve. Have her slidin home, tellin her friends just in the third. I'm sure ya done heard, who I'm doin and what I'm doin. What's false and what's true and.. (girl listen). When it comes to this game they call me Zane McGwire. That other kid was just a Mark, so I made him retire. See we all got a base, and we hold our own. But when I - come up to bat, we all goin come home. And our fans cheers us on cause they know what the drill is. Goin, out of the field into your automobile. And I hope it ain't your Range Rover that you spent your change over. I'm in the dugout with my tongue out player game over. [Chorus 2: (Sammie)]. [Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]. Listen, listen, listen. They call me young Wheezy Rodriguez. You know I'm gettin it hot as the bullet that (killed) Kennedy, y'know. And I keep the chrome bat swingin, slingin that iron. Pitch on the block like Nolan Ryan. Too bad for TV, you won't see me I'm right in the streets. I'm a hustler, people, my life in the streets. Watch the game, get you wife in the sheets. My watch, my chain, and my teeth cost. That way I will never cheap talk. And I call mami sweetheart, she call me sweet daddy. And she gladly, loves the way that daddy bat it, yeah baby. Wheezy Weez a player baby, and I don't share baby. So if you searchin for some (pussy) ain't nuttin here, baby. Catch me throwin an eighty in the latest Bentley, goin out. And Wheezy never hit a foul, a Hot Guy.

I just breed them blue pits. Niggas talk tough but they don't want it though. Confront it to your face and then I'll tell your man that he a hoe. Bow wizzle I'm as real as it gets. I'm either getting money or boning a chick. Counting all this money. All these bottles we popping. In a club with the models. Got so many options. Nigga talk your shit. Yeah they hate me they watching. They know my flow ill. I be spitting and hulking, biatch. At 15 the bentley was a kid's dream. Now these couple links got me speaking like I'm european. A hundred thousand packed at the show in manila. Then I'm down in africa where the kids are the killers. Got a mind of a king but a heart of a gorilla. You can imitate but ain't nobody realer. Yeah I'm counting all this money. Milli for the bugatti. And my girl ass thick like buffy the body. And which one I'ma choose. I think her with the woos. I keep paper like the kid in elementary school. You know I'm smoking on the finest. G5 to the islands. I'm too fly yeah it's like I'm on autopilot. Man stop it I'm way outta your league. See it'll take a lifetime to spend all this cheese. I got a new bitch for erryday of the week. Suck a nigga off until I'm fast asleep. You know.... Take it back to the hood. Screaming father forgive us. All my killers what's good. You know my flow is like murder. Go on give me a sentence. Got too many bars you think I'm building a prison. Anything that I sing is a hit, car collision. How you got all that mouth and your heart is missing. Stop playing with me y'all lames to me. Me and chris got our weight up. Better your cake up. Like g&c get your weight up"

I been in the club long before you been going in the club you know what I'm saying. I was walking in the club with JD at 10 years old you know what I'm saying. Sitting on couches, man I been doing this what you talkin bout. You a new jack. [Verse 1:]. Hold up jow wow, bow wow, Mr. 21. Did 5 movies and none of em amount to my 1.

And you far from a flirt how you messing with Ciara. Then you cut your hair off, that's when you fell off. Man say your album go to platinum that's when you cooled off. Disrespectin the Bow Wow legacy. You got the nerve on this song to say you better than me. Man I rep Columbus, you rep the A Town. I got more street cred, I ran with the Dog Pound. [Chorus:]. Anything you can do, I can do better. Man we go out with the old. Homie you can't deny. I'm saying. Anything you can do, I can do better. Ain't talkin bout nothing, the whole world agree. You can't do it like me [x6]. You can try all day but you can't do it like me. [Verse 2:]. It's time to put the kids to bed. The ending of an era. The playtime is over. I'm older but I'm better. I'm bigger and better. More swagger, you mad cause. You met Ciara first homie but you couldn't bag her. You said you were a dog, but see you was just a puppy. You say you getting paid but you can't spend none your money. Ha, that's funny, I'm in the back of that 'bach. And you know I got nobody writin my raps. So fall back little kid, you ain't Fresh Azimiz. I'm in my bachelor pad, you up in your mamas crib. Matter of fact, how you pop up after all of these years. I know Jermaine ain't here so here man, he put you up to this?. [Chorus]. [Verse 3:]. Now first you rappin like TIP then you rappin like Wayne. Get your own little style, homie, stay in your lane. You see me switchin 4 lanes, paint drippin like rain. I ain't tipping, I ain't wayne, don't trip you know the name. Still So So Def, Mickey Mouse around my neck. Crying out on television how you don't get no respect. I rock a Dog Paw Chain repping L B W Gang. I ain't never shed a tear, I got no fear I feel no pain. Need to hop up on your cash quick rats to the action. First time out I went 3 times platinum. I'm talking 1 million, 2 million, 3 million, 4. That's 4 years on the runway on a major cd tour. Mr. 106 and Park, yep my money keep stacking. Ain't nobody know who you is if that had never happened. I'm the B O W W O W, see what it is nevermind what it was. Roll up in the game, sold up and it's all grown up, lil bow we won. [Chorus]"

Ain't nuttin' but net, but I can go glass too. when I'm in the paint defense so shook. They don't know if Imma put up a slow hook or dish it for no look. To drive the lane would be dumb'no. Cuz imma send it bak atcha then give you da finger like Mutumbo. Surely ova the summer you mita boosted an inch. But as long as Fabulous is playin get used to the bench.

big dreams,"[Verse 1]. I had a homie named Tony 16, 6'2. Headed to the NBA straight from High School. My nigga has his ball game on lock. But at the same time he was in love with the block. All the stuff that came wit it the drugs and the guns,. the gangs the slang and all the funds. He just got a letter of detent from the Cavaliers. saying how they love him and they wish he was there. He had it made like special-ed about to get the bread. But chose to do something dumb instead. Go to war with the crew on the other side of town. And was more ready and Tony got laided down. He ain't even have a chance. Died before the ambulance even got to him. So many went through him. I hate to tell the story but that's how it is. Growing up in the hood as a kid. [Chorus]. When you got big dreams. Don't listen to what nobody say and don't let nobody turn you away. When you got big dreams. Keep your eyes on the prize don't fall to the way. side. When you got big dreams. Don't listen to what nobody say and don't let nobody turn you away. When you got big dreams. Keep your eyes on the prize don't fall to the way side. Reach for the sky. [Verse 2]. I knew a girl named Gina that was a hell of a singer. And everybody fell in love with her when they seen. her. Babygirl was on the verge of signing a big deal. 18 and life looked so so real. She was stuck with a dude that was all bad news. And all he ever did was give baby the blues. And she was true to a nigga, do for a nigga,. pop you and your whole crew for a nigga. One night he came and picked her up, told her let's ride. That's the same night that he watched her die. They was tryna hit a lick but the lick hit back. Put a end to the deal and all of that. She ain't even have to be there and he knew it wasn't right. Now he gotta deal wit it for the rest of his life. And the part I don't like he ain't even get grazed. But the home girl Gina is laying in the grave. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. I got a few relatives giving the family drama. Always got they hands out when they see me and my. mama. One could have been a doctor, the other a chef. But when he got his own kitchen he was cooking. something else. Now his life in the drain, a trifling shame. He all washed up, wife took everything. No car no more, no house. And everywhere he go he stole so they throwed him out. I was growing up looking up to be like them. Now I'm throwing up cash rolling up in the bent. I'm stuck with a dream I had since a shorty and. I'll be damned if I let another man support me. Now Uncle June Buck sick, skinny as hell. He got AIDS in his body from the needles he shared. Everytime he get his welfare checks he don't care. If you wanna see him go to he crackhouse the there. [Chorus]. When you got big dreams [3x]. When you got big dreams don't fall to the way side. reach for the sky"

Fav'rite rappers is Bow Wow, Snoop, JD, & Nas. Always up in they sombodys face tryin to fuss. And to get where she goin she can take the bus. Like when Jada was Peaches in the movie Shame. Or the type you can find sitting at the roughtest game. Only like dealing with cats that love to floss. Only like rocking the stuff that really costs. Lip gloss shinnin' tattoos on her back. Attitude like Mary J. Mixed with Brat. You can find um' at a beauty shop, mall, or church. Name brand head to toe with the matching purse. So all that siddity stuff, ya'll can keep. Cuz only girls that keep it ghetto get to ride with me (fo' sho). (Chorus). Ghetto Girls. That like hot boys that push hot toys. And ball wit the best of them.

lil rascals,"Throw me the ball and watch me what I do with it. We got Bow Wow in the house. My man Lil' Zane - huh, and Lil' Wayne. Sammie sing to me. [Chorus 1: (Sammie)]. Strike one, caught you by surprise. Strike two, right before your eyes. Pitch three, this one's to the wall. Ain't no fun game like a game of Hardball. [Verse 1: Lil' Bow Wow]. When I step to the plate the outfield gets back (back). Cause they know I'm the over the wall type of dog. So many back to back hits they call me little Sammy Sosa. Bubble gum cards and all the posters. Y'all know, how I roast ya when it's time to compete. On the field, on the court, over any hot beat. or break, and you know it when you see your clone. And right now that's all I see goin on, holla at me. Game time, all I think about is bringin home the trophy. If your team is better mine, you really gotta show me. Really gotta beat me, really gotta trash talk. Mistreat me, and send my squad back home. Cause I don't know lose too much. Matter fact, I ain't never lost at all. When I'm playin Hardball (that's right). So, if you on the mound about to pitch to me. Understand I'm like Griffey, I keep 'em to the wall. [Chorus 2: (Sammie)]. Strike one, caught you by surprise. Strike two, right before your eyes. Strike three, ohh I got you out. Without a doubt, I got you out. Strike one, caught you by surprise. Strike two, right before your eyes. Pitch three, this one's to the wall. Ain't no fun game like a game of Hardball. [Verse 2: Lil' Zane]. This goes out to them jocks that stay on my jock, throwin the pop. Keep pitchin, I'm in the kitchen makin radio rock. It's usually preferred, I be choosy with all my words. Throwin eggs at them chickenheads, beggin on the curb. Direct from my burb, a fast baller with a curve. Have her slidin home, tellin her friends just in the third. I'm sure ya done heard, who I'm doin and what I'm doin. What's false and what's true and.. (girl listen). When it comes to this game they call me Zane McGwire. That other kid was just a Mark, so I made him retire. See we all got a base, and we hold our own. But when I - come up to bat, we all goin come home. And our fans cheers us on cause they know what the drill is. Goin, out of the field into your automobile. And I hope it ain't your Range Rover that you spent your change over. I'm in the dugout with my tongue out player game over. [Chorus 2: (Sammie)]. [Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]. Listen, listen, listen. They call me young Wheezy Rodriguez. You know I'm gettin it hot as the bullet that (killed) Kennedy, y'know. And I keep the chrome bat swingin, slingin that iron. Pitch on the block like Nolan Ryan. Too bad for TV, you won't see me I'm right in the streets. I'm a hustler, people, my life in the streets. Watch the game, get you wife in the sheets. My watch, my chain, and my teeth cost. That way I will never cheap talk. And I call mami sweetheart, she call me sweet daddy. And she gladly, loves the way that daddy bat it, yeah baby. Wheezy Weez a player baby, and I don't share baby. So if you searchin for some (pussy) ain't nuttin here, baby. Catch me throwin an eighty in the latest Bentley, goin out. And Wheezy never hit a foul, a Hot Guy. Don't hit pop flies, I knock it up out the park. And after the game's over we gon' meet up after dark. [Chorus 2: repeat 2x (Sammie)]. Lil' Bow Wow, Lil' Zane, Lil' Wayne, Lil' Sammie."

my baby,"[Verse 1]. It was the summer 2001. All before the drama begun. When we first met. I seen you sitting out on your steps. You was broke down crying a mess. So I interferred. I asked what's the reason for tears. I was wishing you could tell me your fears. But I'll start with ya name. You told me how ya man playin games. So I said that it was time for a change. And you just laughed. But it looked like you aint laughed in while. I was glad that I could give you a smile. Then we both blushed. But really girl it aint no rush. I was thinking maybe that we can discuss. A future for us. Cause homeboy just got you crushed. You need to leave that clown in the dust. Trust. I just wanna talk. I'm thinking I can give you a call. And we can pick it up. Where we left off. I'll holla tomorrow. [Chorus]. Girl I understand you loyal to ya man. And that's alright aww baby. But that dont change the fact. That you fine and you stay crying every night nah baby. Girl you got to let him know. You can't live like this no more. Nah baby. Cant see. Together you and me could be so special ah baby. [Verse 2]. Our feelings get greater. A million days later. Talking all night we stay up but. Here comes ya ex. Returned with that drama and stress. All the nonsense that you just left but yet. You except and go back to try it again. Then return with a broken heart. That I gotta mend. That's unfair. I've only been your lover and friend. Homey there he just front and pretend. But you dont care the life he leads. Is unsafe. I would never place my hands to your face. But still I chase. Cat and mouse. First you kick him out. Then you at his house. What is that about. I cant figure you out. Even your friend said I was better. But you listen to them. Never like uh-uh whatever. So the next time he hurt you again. You already knew where you should've been. And that's with me. [Repeat Chorus]. [Verse 3]. All the times. You 2way telling me. That you miss me. Wanting me to come over and keep you busy. Remember that. Now that you gone. It's been kinda hard. Cant think, cant sleep. Cant do nothing at all. Just tell me why you had to go back. See you aint have to go through that. My baby. You could've been here right by my side. Me and you at the park taking walks outside. But. Instead, I keep on having these dreams. Waiting for my phone to ring. My baby wishing that it would be you But I know that that wont come true"

puppy love,"[JD](Jagged Edge). (Oh...). Je y'all. [Lil Bow Wow](JD). Yo I'm looking for girls. (Bow Wow). Girls that can give me puppy love. Ya know?. (He, he yeah). Yeah it's going down right here. West coast rock on. (Come on). East coast rock on. (Come on). Dirty South rock on. Yeah. (Come on, come on, come on). All young girls beware. This pup's off the chains. I'm gritty little something here. Putting down pain. Since I was six. Running with the pound. It's been going down. From city to city, town to town. They running up screaming my name. Running up grabbing my chain. Running up tryna get in the game. I'm like ma don't get it twisted. If we kick it get your bark on. Hope to God you see me again, when I'm grown. Type of playa but it ain't. It just sounds like that. Cause I'm just too young to get down like that. (I agree). Hit the movies, hit the mall. Then come out with big bags. Next day do lunch then head Six Flags. But it don't mean nothing. We're just having some fun. Even though I may have told you on the ride. You're the on. I'm sorry little shorty. I gotta take that back. 'Cause I'm just too young to get down like that. So.... Chorus - [Lil Bow Wow](Jagged Edge). (You can't hear me). Not a word that I be saying. (Its plain to see). Girl I just be playing with you. (Girl you and me, see it's just puppy love, oh). Bark on baby, bark on, bark on. Repeat Chorus. [Lil Bow Wow]. Even if you're three years older than me. And caught yourself noticing me. In my mind, set don't change. I might up my game. But the story that I tell 'em. When I tell it, it remains the same. You wouldn't believe how they be coming at me. Steady, steady tryna throw something at me. Like I'mma get happy. Just because honey got her learner's permit. Can come and scoop me after school. Like I'm supposed to be on it. Naw ain't no sippin' over here. It's Big Pimpin' over here. And I hope that I make myself clear. That when it comes to honeys yo I got some minutes. And I ain't tryna get serious 'till I'm up in my twenties. It's just the paper that I'm after. The drop with the top I'ma cop when I'm able. And that's all that matters. So if I told you something shorty. I'm taking that back. Cause I'm just too young to get down like that. So.... Repeat Chorus (4x). You can't hear me. It's plain to see. Girl you and me. See it's just puppy love, oh. You can't hear me. It's plain to see. Girl you and me. See it's just puppy love."

Hey why they hatin on you bow?. 'cause all that shit I know y'all smell it and they sayin I ain't got it if you let them hata's tell it. I'll remain on top whether you like it or not. Toppin' every single chart from r&b rap to pop. Homie get on your grind, why you hatin' on mine?. I've been stackin' all this paper ever since I was five. Stuntin' plaques on my wall mane, goin' down my hallways. Cash money, young money a-a-always. Sellin' our arenas. Packin' out the garden. Message to y'all sucka niggas fuck 'bout what y'all talkin'. I keep girls in my jacuzzi, a mil' for every movie. Like what the fuck y'all talkin' 'bout, can't nobody out-do me oh yeah. And it's hard to handle all these groupie hoe's. And I could retire off of one of my movie rolls. Hey why they hatin on you bow?. 'cause my bankroll stupid. They just mad cause they can't do it like I do it sucka nigga.

Hook up my grandma with a fresh new V with a note attached. Telling her you love me. The six-o-six-four-four and I'm too nice to stop the flow. Rock some more. So So Def is a family. We on top and that's how it has to be. From JD to Bow Wow, to JE and me. Everything we drop so hot continuously. If the sex ain't freaky that ain't me. And if the check ain't weekly, we can't be. I'm still a big thang getter. Big Momma the Brat from C-H-I-C-A-G-O."
