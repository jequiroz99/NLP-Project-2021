keep movin' on feat. shara worden,"I lost my job at the factory and that's disastrous. They said it's due to regulation and higher taxes. They ain't give me no notice. They knocked me off my axis. I can't pay the electric bill. It's total blackness. I suggested some incentives for innovation. But that was met with resistance like it's a sin of Satan. I'm losing my patience over here. I'm sick of waiting. And I ain't never expect to be in this situation. And the manufacturing jobs are fading fast (Damn). Can't do nothing else. I should've stayed in class. I have to wait till summertime to cut the blades of grass. I have this little bit of money. Have to make it last. I have children to feed. I have a loving wife. I had a hard time coming that was nothing nice. I keep asking myself what am I doing wrong. And they just look at me and tell me ""Keep it movin' on"". Keep movin' on. But I don't know where to go. Nowhere to go. Keep movin' on. It was like '91, '92. I remember people telling us. that ain't nobody signing you. There's no Italians or Puerto Ricans. that's shining through. Y'all should just go back and just do what y'all. was designed to do. We ain't listened to none of that. We hard-headed. We took it back to the lab and then the God set it. We smoked L's, drank liquor and we got wetted. And everything we did back then was barbaric. Around '94 had some labels take notice. They said that Stoupe was the illest. but that I ain't focused. The label execs needed to be explained dopeness. And that's around the time. I thought that it became hopeless. We was still in the street. D was moving strong. I was failing out of school. It wasn't cool with moms. I was asking myself, ""What was we doing wrong? "". And why the industry keep saying to keep it movin' on. Keep movin' on. But I don't know where to go. Nowhere to go. Keep movin' on. I signed up cause they promised me some college money. I ain't the smartest motherfucker but I'm not a dummy. They told me I would be stationed in places. hot and sunny. I had a lot of pride. Motherfuckers got it from me. These people over here innocent. They never harmed me. My sergeant tried to convince me. that they would try to bomb me. I feel like an outsider stuck inside this army. Everybody brainwashed. American zombies. I ain't realized how much it set me back. Until I lost my leg and then they sent me back. I don't have anything now. I'm left with scraps. From a government who created Aids, invented crack. People told me not to join. I tried to prove 'em wrong. Now I'm homeless and I'm cold without no food thas' warm. I keep asking myself, ""What did I do that's wrong? "". And the government telling me, ""Keep it movin' on"". Yeah, a wise man once said. There is no progress, without struggle. I'm a believer in that shit. I struggled my whole life. Feel me on this here. [Shara Worden]. Ohh, keep movin, keep movin (Pazienza).

ain't shit changed (feat. lawrence arnell),"Ain't a goddamn thing gonna change. I'm still the same Vinnie*. I'm still the same fat motherfucker, same guinea. A little bit more money. That's why I ain't skinny. Still the same block-hugger, still the same city. I still got the same people that remain with me. That was drinking 40s with me when they slain Biggie. And the same motherfuckers felt the pain with me. When my stepfather died and they came with me. I ain't expect nothing less from them. They chained to me. Spiritually, mentally, we the same really. We all was raised on different blocks in the same Philly. Still some stupid motherfuckers saying they can't feel me. Actually they do feel me, they just ashamed really. That they ain't shining like the kid, a bunch of lames really. Dirtbags trying to make the kid insane really. But Louie Dogs just impervious to pain really. Every morning I rise up, I open my eyes. Thinking I'm the shit. I guarantee if you're fucking with me. You gon' know who you're fucking with. I been this way since I came of age. And I never did play them games. I'll be this way till the day I lay. Cause ain't a goddamn thing gonna change. It ain't anybody ever gonna hold me down. I'm one of the greatest ever, homie. I stole the crown. I'm too strong and fast. You ain't slowing me down. I'm gonna keep beating your head. Call me Homie D. Clown. I hope that y'all are holding close to your rosaries now. I think I got a couple snitches that's close to me now. If I was them I'd keep it moving. Be ghost from me now. And pray that they don't run into Vinnie socially now. It's always one motherfucker trying to set you up. Dry snitch take something from you, wet you up. I was sleeping, being dumb, trying to protect the fuck. He getting buck fifty. Slice him from his neck to gut. All in all ain't nothing changed. Still the same squad. Some are still hustling summers at the same job. Some is 9 to 5, some is on the graveyard. I'd rather have them on tour with me so I pray hard. Every morning I rise up, I open my eyes. Thinking I'm the shit. I guarantee if you're fucking with me. You gon' know who you're fucking with.

That there ain't a woman that's living that's willing to stay. Somebody please fix my head. I'm willing to pay. I'm too at ease with the dead and the killing, okay?. Damn, I'm anti-social. I'd rather be home. And when I'm drunk Planet and Crypt carry me home. I don't have a happy ending, just tragedy homes. You better address me as Mister or Majesty, homes. I'm a messiah. I'm a liar. I have to be stoned. I'm a pariah. I retire. I have to be cloned. I have fire. I'm desire. This has to be known. I'm a survivor, a relier on tragedy's throne. Every morning I rise up, I open my eyes.

Your fam should be ashamed of you still. This ain't a cookout but Vinnie put the flame to your grill. You claim to be real but y'all just end up painfully killed. My four-fifth is vicious, cold enough for Satan to chill. I don't give a fuck cousin, everybody can fry. Everyone could be a victim, everybody could cry. Only a real man look another dead in the eye. And tell him that he only got like twenty seconds to die. I'm slow but I realise that's my best pace. My voice raw, when I spit it crack through my chest plate. I ain't the type of motherfucker to test fate. The type of motherfucker to increase the arrest rate. Streets fucked up suffering bad. There's no kush, motherfuckers stuck hustling skag. Yeah, same ones get stuck with the mag. Hard rock turn to rubble cause he's fucking a fag. Silly girl to be a fool. You didn't play the golden rule. Cause once you're through with one world. There's another waiting there. I'mma go hard 'tll nothing is left. Till there's nothing left in the world, nothing but death. And the. 38 tucked in my vest. And I stare at my guns. like they're a pair of voluptuous breasts. I don't care, I'll take one in my chest. If it means seeing my father again. and maybe touching his flesh. I'll walk around with thirty guns in my sweats. If it means that I'm eating. and my mother eating, son of success. I see the world different than y'all. I have more determination and persistence than y'all. It's probably why I have such a resistance to y'all. It's probably why I been so much more consistent than y'all. It's business-involved. I'm everything that you could possibly dream. I'm a mathematician, I'm a vision, I'm a machine. Know what I mean?. I roll with brothers pushing rock to the fiends. Roll with brothers who love their mothers. stay on top of their Deen. Louie Dogs rap harder than most. And I got something that rearrange your face. and turn your pop to a ghost. You get rocked with the toast. And I make you put your hands up. like people that are talking in quotes"
bad day,"Some people wake up late, I wake up mad late. All the time hung over. It's a sad state. I love liquor. She's my bitch and her ass great. But I don't remember anything from our last date.

Rap critics, they always got something to say. I would never let that fuck up my day. I don't know where the fuck I'm at today. I drank a couple of bottles. I guess I have to pay. This bitch laying next to me, she look like Cassius Clay. Gotta get outta here before she ask me to stay. I don't know how I got here in the first place. She had a bangin' body but she had the worst face. I guess I act like an animal. I deserve hate. She must've lured me in with white like she was third base. It ain't hard to convince me to do some dumb shit. Especially when I'm on that get high and drunk shit. That's why Vinnie always end up with a dumb bitch. The only thing I'm never on is on some punk shit. I'm on the other side of town and I'm walkin' dolo. Panerai watch, Gucci kicks, lots of Polo. Goons ran up on a kid, put the gat to my dome. I was caught slippin'. I left the ratchet at home. Every time that I feel this shit is goin' my way. Something come along and fuck up my day. I had a rhyme in my mind. Now there's nothing to say.

One should meditate on being ripped apart by arrows. Rifles, spears and swords. Being carried away by surging waves. Being thrown into the midst of a great fire. Being struck by lightning. Being shaken to death by a great earthquake. Falling from thousand foot cliffs. Dying of disease or committing seppuku. At the death of one's master. And every day without fail. One should consider himself as dead. This is the substance and the way of the assassin"

Nowhere to go. Keep movin' on. It was like '91, '92. I remember people telling us. that ain't nobody signing you. There's no Italians or Puerto Ricans. that's shining through. Y'all should just go back and just do what y'all. was designed to do. We ain't listened to none of that. We hard-headed. We took it back to the lab and then the God set it. We smoked L's, drank liquor and we got wetted. And everything we did back then was barbaric. Around '94 had some labels take notice. They said that Stoupe was the illest. but that I ain't focused. The label execs needed to be explained dopeness. And that's around the time. I thought that it became hopeless. We was still in the street. D was moving strong. I was failing out of school. It wasn't cool with moms. I was asking myself, ""What was we doing wrong? "". And why the industry keep saying to keep it movin' on. Keep movin' on. But I don't know where to go. Nowhere to go. Keep movin' on. I signed up cause they promised me some college money. I ain't the smartest motherfucker but I'm not a dummy. They told me I would be stationed in places. hot and sunny. I had a lot of pride. Motherfuckers got it from me. These people over here innocent. They never harmed me. My sergeant tried to convince me. that they would try to bomb me. I feel like an outsider stuck inside this army. Everybody brainwashed. American zombies. I ain't realized how much it set me back. Until I lost my leg and then they sent me back. I don't have anything now. I'm left with scraps. From a government who created Aids, invented crack. People told me not to join. I tried to prove 'em wrong. Now I'm homeless and I'm cold without no food thas' warm. I keep asking myself, ""What did I do that's wrong? "". And the government telling me, ""Keep it movin' on"". Yeah, a wise man once said. There is no progress, without struggle. I'm a believer in that shit. I struggled my whole life. Feel me on this here. [Shara Worden]. Ohh, keep movin, keep movin (Pazienza). Keep movin, keep moovin on"
kill 'em all (feat. beanie sigel),"People want to think that this is the Wild West. we don't have any laws. What we don't have is enforcement of those laws.

same story (my dedication) (feat. liz fullerton),"They say that things just cannot grow. Beneath the winter snow. So I have been told. You came into my mother's life at the right time.

Moms went with you. I stayed and held down the fort. I was nervous. I was crying and really distraught. I was alone by myself, just left with my thoughts. Mommy called. Told me that you had a stroke and fought. I ain't seen a hospital since my father died. I don't like it there. Memories is locked inside. When I walked inside the room we started to cry. I was just so happy that you was alive. And you told me how much that you hate the hospital. And that they thieves and trying to keep their pockets full. I think I hold myself a little bit responsible. When you was smoking all the time. I wasn't stopping you. Nevertheless you came home and that was real. A lot of therapy and doctors gave you lots of pills. You couldn't drive anymore. You had to stop and chill. And that's too much for anybody that can stop your will. But you never got back to your norm. You was proud. Didn't want any help from my mom. I left for tour and you asked me how long I'd be gone. And I could see inside your eyes. you knew something was wrong. I got back. Mommy told me you was sick again. Couldn't believe. that we was going through this shit again. I love you Rock and I'm always gonna miss you friend. And for me it's just the same story, different pen. I am made of all four corners. All directions without the borders.

Then I scrape the sides then I let em test. Yes, I got weight like Creatine. A gem star hit that chopping block like a guillotine. Know what I mean? Sitting on chrome rims. Not only paper, we stack brick like Stonehenge. Go against us? Haters got no wins. I trust no one and I don't need no friends"
warmonger,"My fist enters in your temple like an obelisk. It's blackness, darkness, abyss of joblessness. Everything you do is small, my shit is monstrous. I murder devils and any of their accomplices. My brain function on other levels of consciousness. My brain function on other levels of pompousness. You're listening to the bass and treble of godlessness. My thirty-eight will spit hate and level the populous. My esophogus breathes evil that just demolishes. Whether or not you're a believer in the Apocalypse. Y'all shit is sweeter than two faggots that's locking lips. It ain't a rapper competing with my obnoxiousness. It ain't nobody that's equal to my accomplishments. The Desert Eagle is legal and it astonishes. The Ar15 diesel and blow your mom to bits. It's hard to catch me, I'm Thurman Munson. and Carlton Fisk. Music is motivation for me to just go insane. Man I see it on paper, I know that I should be caged. And I'm trapped but I escaped it. By trapping in that trap for that paper. Music is motivation for me to just go insane. Man I see it on paper, I know that I should be caged. And I'm trapped but I escaped it. By trapping in that trap for that paper. Y'all know the flow is precise. You don't owe me your life. But that could change one roll of the dice. And then money try to go for his knife. I'm a levitate his body to the sky. until he's homies with Christ. Don't even fuck around, son is a goon. Son is bipolar, alcoholic, son is consumed. I breathe life into the sun and the moon. I breathe life into the most barren bloodiest womb. Y'all don't know y'all getting stalked in the shower. Populism is rebellion over corporate power. Politics is just the talk of the hour. It's a matter of time before they hit another office or tower. I don't care, I put the gun to your ribs. And the Desert E big, it'll separate mothers from kids. I walked around from Philly slums to the bridge. Been around the world eighty times. nobody can fuck with the kid. Yeah"
washed in the blood of the lamb,"""The only reward of those who make war upon Allah. and His messenger, and strive after corruption in the land. will be that they will be killed or crucified. or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off. or will be expelled out of the land. Such will be their degradation in the world. and in the Hereafter theirs will be an awful doom! "". If you listen to me then you know my father was G. And the apple don't fall too far from the tree. Me and you is different as we can possibly be. Me and you is just different philosophically. I don't think its anybody as obnoxious as me. I don't think that anybody else could parted the sea. I don't think that you wanna discuss the horror with me. If I was you I'd move a little bit more farther from me. It ain't nobody living more of a sergeant than me. It ain't nobody alive more of a prophet than me. It ain't nobody living possibly rocking with me. On the stage, in the studio, or boxing with me. Every second I'm awake there is a toxin in me. Anti-depressants, Suboxone, Oxycontin in me. Only a stupid motherfucker have a problem with me. Cause he don't know. I got the fucking problem-solver with me. [x4]. I was washed in the blood of the lamb. Whoever touches my hand. gonna leave enough blood in the sand. I was washed in the blood of the lamb. Whoever fuck with my fam suffering. A motherfucker should scram. I slaughter anything I get my hands on. Inside the Church of Anton with bloody pants on. I was in the land of Israel and heard ram's horn. I was in the sand with Ishmael and fought the sandstorm. I'm just waiting for the raven to thaw. Cause I don't argue with Mesopotamian law. I submit my will and faith into the grace of Allah. And the Mayan calendar say it's erasing us all. The four-fifth: you should see this thing. It's berserk. And y'all are royalty inside a fucking kingdom of dirt. How are y'all original when y'all ain't think of it first?. I just wish I could put everything I think into verse. But instead I decide to drink in a Russian bar. I'm Rasputin, I'm influencing a Russian Tsar. I'm Dave Lombardo on drums. Leave the percussion scarred. I drink the bottle to the bottom. Put my trust in God. [x2]. I was washed in the blood of the lamb. Whoever touches my hand. gonna leave enough blood in the sand. I was washed in the blood of the lamb. Whoever fuck with my fam suffering. A motherfucker should scram. Kill them whenever you confront them. and drive them out from where they drove you out!. For though killing is sinful, wrongful persecution. is even worse than killing. Do not fight against them near the holy mosque. unless they fight against you. But if they fight against you, kill them. for that is the reward of such unbelievers. Pazienza! Fourth disciple! The Assassin's creed!. Official Pistol Gang! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
you can't be neutral on a moving train,"Governments lie all the time. Well, not just the American government. it's just in the nature of governments. Well, they have to lie. And since they don't represent the people. and so since they act against the interest of the people. The only way they can hold power. is if they lie to the people. (You don't know what I know. you can't see the spreading state. Of deception, I am cruel to myself. things will never be the same). If they told people the truth they wouldn't last very long. (I will hold my silence like a weapon in my hand. If I used it I would murder myself. You could never understand). Columbus came ashore. greeted with nothing but niceness. Sailing west in attempt to find gold and spices. Dominated by the popes in frenzy for ices. The Catholic church expelled Jews. and claimed it was righteous. The first man to see land would get a reward. And get a yearly pension for life clearly from God. A young sailor saw land said, ""We isn't far"". Columbus lied, said he saw it the evening before. They touched ground, they were greeted by the Arawak. Columbus had them locked up as prisoners. in an hour flat. He wanted to find their source of gold and that was that. And when they thought that wasn't fair. then he stabbed their back. When there was no more gold he took slaves instead. And left a quarter million Indians in Haiti dead. The men died in mines, the women died at work. The children died from lack of milk. and they died in the dirt. They were just taking advantage of a passive people. They were just being the savages of massive evil. That's the church work, that's the path of massive ego. That's the blood of Abraham. being stabbed by the steeple. In 1619 they were patiently waiting. For a ship that carried slaves. that was changing the nation. The white man was a cannibal praying to Satan. Hatred contempt a pity of patronization. That's the corner stone everything racism based in. The African had a more advanced civilization. Black was slave, master was white, rationalization. 50 million dead, that's Western civilization. At first they appeared in the North. And they were helpless in the face of superior force. And all of them were chained together. they really was lost. Racism isn't natural it's merely divorce. Before the slave trade black was considered distasteful. By the Oxford dictionary, I find it disgraceful. It's not a natural tendency to be bitter and hateful. It's the natural enemy of the critical staple. Slavery grew as the plantation system grew. The reason for that's kinda easily traceable. Society of helpless dependence was capable. Of saying, ""Fuck a slave master, you're in slavery too"". Seven slaves were put to death for murdering master. Fear of slave revolt had them developing faster. You a cataline killer, ineloquent bastard. I would burn the white man while smelling the ashes. From time to time white man was part of the resistance. White indentured servants wanted no part of the system. King Philip's War showed that if people would listen. That they can. maybe break the complex chain of oppression. Tyranny is tyranny, but that's a concession. But the women they was treated like that of possessions. Black women had it worse cause they was abused. That's the white justification of Aryan blues. The next move was to dominate the Mexicans. James Polk dominated them like they was next of kin. He sent Colonel Cross to lie to them and let them in. 11 days later, his skull was crushed, so message sent. ""We take nothing by conquest, "" that was the mantra. The military wasn't human, they was just monsters. Henry David Thoreau refused to pay his taxes. Denounced the Mexican War and got locked in shackles. The twentieth century opened, anger reemerged. Reality of ordinary life was being heard. Anarchists and feminists came from factory work. Communism, socialism seemed to be re-birthed. ""War is the health of the state"" is what Bourne said. And if you was born around that time you was born dead. The Espionage Act had people confused. Cause it was double talk. and they didn't know how it'd be used. Supposedly it was an act against spying. Dubois knew that that was bullshit and they was lying. Charles Schenck was arrested in Philadelphia. For printing and distributing leaflets. cause they was helping ya. He was indicted, tried and then found guilty. And spent six months in jail, don't that sound silly?. Had his freedom taken away by his own nation. But there's a lesson, do not submit to intimidation. The act still exists today and this shit is real. Supposedly Kennedy tried to have that shit appealed. Eugene Debs did ten years for no purpose. He obstructed the recruiting and enlistment service. The post office started taking mail privileges. Of magazines who printed anti-war sentiments. A Socialist named Fairchild had it right. He said that ""they can shoot me. but they can't make me fight"". They sentenced him to a year in jail. and that was reckless. 65, 000 men, conscientious objectors. They were sent to army bases to work there. They were treated sadistically and were hurt there. They were strangled with the hemp rope til they collapsed. And officers punched they stomach and they lower back. A garden hose was placed on they face with a nozzle. About six inches from them so they couldn't swallow. The war ended in nineteen hundred and eighteen (1918). The government was just trying to wipe the slate clean. Hemingway wrote Farewell to Arms. Dalton Trumbo wrote Johnny Got His Gun. The war was over but they didn't learn they lesson. Twin tactics of control, reform and repression. The patriotic fervor of war had been invoked. That's why the country that you live in is a Fucking Joke!. You cannot be neutral on a moving train. This is a story about the lies that your teacher told you. This is real actual factual. No lies in the whole record. If you don't believe me look it up. I'm trying to share the shit that I learned with y'all. Do the knowledge. Your government does not care about you. The people in power do not care about you. Understand that. Power to the people"
