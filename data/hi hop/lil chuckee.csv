christmas in new orleans,"It was December 24, I was chilling up town. I was posted on a... tree, it went down. And somebody over roof, so I looked in the air. I seen that dude in all red, with 12 reindeers. I say it am I tripping, he gots to be slipping. Rolling it's the... he gots to be tripping. As soon as I seen that the boy fell fast. And when he fell down you would have thought he was dead. I went to go help him put the ball straight down. I picked up his wallet it was Louis Vuitton, for real?. I looked at his I'd and guess what it read. It read North Pole and the name was Saint.... And then I took a pause, I said it's Santa Clause. All this money in his wallet he got it going on.
