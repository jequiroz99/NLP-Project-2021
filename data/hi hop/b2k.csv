alone,"Alone. Na na na na na. Alone. Na na na na na. I know (listen up). Questions cloud my head with why. Tears on my pillow as I cry. Makes no sense for us too say goodbye.

I been seating here waiting. By the phone. Give anything to hear. Your tone. It was all my fault. I know. Now I just stand here. Alone. Still remember the day when everything. Went wrong. Try to think how it would be if you hadn't. Gone. Away, shoulda made you stay. Now I just stand. . Stormy nights and cloudy days. Can I fix it, what can I do, what can I say. Feels as if I'm stuck in a maze. With no way out I think I'm goin insane. So alone without you. Where'd you go I miss my baby boo. It's a shame cause I can't breath without you. Please come back girl. Cause I'm missing you. . (Chorus). Alone. I been seating here waiting. By the phone (by the phone). Give anything to hear. Your tone (yeah, ohh ohh). It was all my fault.

Now I just stand. (Bridge). Why, why, why. You leave out of my life. Need you right here by my side. Why, why, why. Why oh why. (Chorus 2x). Alone. I been seating here waiting.

Wishing for a bank account with at least 2 zero's. Playing ball all day. Sharing one Gatorade. No dogs of our own. So we walked Bear and Jane. Playing B-B bridges. Hopping over gates. Just to go swimming. Yeah we were bad. Tryna holla at older women. Man. Times was hard. You know we didn't get much. But we had each other and man that was enough. [Chorus:].

Cause we are boys for life. [Rap 3:]. We found a home now. It's on. We in the game now. Chris and Max done made this thing crack now. Now we work with Tom and Polly with Dee Mack now. Took us a while but we got a name now. A platinum album with dough up in the bank now. No more lounging around, we businessmen now. Epic helped us and put us in the right gear. Video and radio thanks for the great year. I'm glad the time that it took was a struggle. To when this time came we would be greatful and humble. We thank God for making all this happen for us. We thank all our fans for having love in us. Ah come on. [Chorus:]. We been through thick and thin. But we still here. No matter what goes down. We are still friends til the end. Ups and downs.

Beautiful, baby that was you and I. Now everyday I got to sit and wonder why. The way we kissed, got a feeling deep inside. What I'm hearing girl, it has to be a lie. How can you, just keep me to the side. You never even gave this thing a T-R-Y. Don't understand these feelings you try to hide. Now all the sudden you been actin f-u-n-n-y. (omit). How could you do this to me. You led me to believe you want me. Now I cant change how I feel inside. Girl tell me why. [Chorus]. Why, why would you make me feel this way.

one kiss,[Verse 1:]. She was so sincere. The way she grabbed my hand. And introduced herself. Like no one else has done before. And I can’t lie. I was hypnotized. By the smile of the talk and the style of the walk. And when she tried to kiss me. I just stopped. And said to myself this can’t be real. Light to my mind but my heart it could. Could feel something was wrong. Don’t worry (that’s what she said). Now I. Look back on the night that changed my life. I remember the things. That made me call at night. And to think I portrayed me for one kiss. [Chorus:]. One kiss for all my trust. One kiss for all my love. One kiss cause me to break. One kiss. I just hate it. One kiss. One kiss. One kiss.

How could I not see. That eventually she would break my heart. Where did it all start. It started with a little bitty kiss. [Chorus:]. One kiss for all my trust. One kiss for all my love. One kiss cause me to break. One kiss. I just hate it. One kiss. One kiss. One kiss. That’s where I started feeling. One kiss felt so good. But I never shoulda had that kiss. [Hook]. A one step for kissing quietly. How could I be so blinded. Shoulda read. Instead. I made it easy. But I won’t let my heart get hurt. It was all about a lesson learned. And the lesson learned was taught to me by one kiss. [Repeat Chorus]
