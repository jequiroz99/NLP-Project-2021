blessings (reprise) (feat. ty dolla $ign),"[verse: chance the rapper]. I speak of promised lands. Soil as soft as momma's hands. Running water, standing still. Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile. Rice under black beans. Walked into apple with cracked screens. And told prophetic stories of freedom. Found warmth in a black queen for when I get cold. Like nat king, I'm doing the dad thing. I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood. Make you remember how to smile good. I'm pre-currency, post-language, anti-label. Pro-famous, I'm broadway joe namath. Kanye's best prodigy. He ain't signed me but he proud of me. I got some ideas that you gotta see. Make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the odyssey. They never seen a rapper practice modesty. I never practice, I only perform. I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn. I speak to god in public, I speak to god in public. He keep my rhymes in couplets. He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans. I used to dance to michael, I used to dance in high school. I used to pass out music, I still pass out music. The people's champ must be everything the people can't be. I'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some hebru brantleys. You must've missed the come up, I must be all I can be. Call me mister mufasa, I had to master stampedes. [hook: chance the rapper]. I made it through, made it through, made it through. And everything I gave to you, I gave to you, I gave to you. You got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming. (coming, coming, coming). So are you ready?. Are you ready?. [outro: ty dolla $ign, bj the chicago kid. Anderson. paak, raury, nico segal.

My stars, egad, she said: ""this my favorite song"". ""Hold my purse"" - now she on the floor, droppin' like it's hot. You blast this shit in Abercrombie. When your work is finished. Your mom won't play it in the car cause it's got cursing in it. Your boy like: ""I'm the one who showed you. ""he want his percentage. Cause you were like. ""this ain't the nigga you said spittin', is it? "". Two-step - white dude's Harlem Shake. Why you laughing? Cause you Harlem Shake?. I was never fake, I was just too good to be true.

The first, is that god is better than the world's best thing. God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer. [verse 1: chance the rapper]. Magnify, magnify, lift it on high. Spit it spotify to qualify a spot on his side. I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies. Lullabies and alibis. The book don't end with malachi. Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen. 'til one score and three years. From the third when he doesn't. My village raised 'em a child. Come through the crib and it's bustin'. You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins. Shabach barak, edify. Electrify the enemy like hedwig till he petrified. Any petty peter petigrew could get the pesticide. 79Th, 79th, I don't believe in science. I believe in signs. Don't believe in signing, I seen dollar signs. Color white collar crime. Good god, the gift of freedom. Hosanna santa invoked and woke up slaves. From southampton to chatham manor. My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm james early. The type of worship make jesus come back a day early. With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed. Hear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me. Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery. I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody. Exalt, exalt, glorify. Descend upon the earth with swords. And fortify the borders where your shorties lie. I used to hide from god. Ducked down in the slums like ""shh"". [verse 2: jay electronica]. I was lost in the jungle like simba after the death of mufasa. No hog, no meerkat, hakuna matata by day. But I spent my night time fighting tears back. I prayed and prayed and left messages. But never got no hear back, or so it seemed. A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream. I build the ark to gently, gently. Row my boat down noah's stream. Sometimes the path I took to reach. My petty goals was so extreme. I was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine. But you was always there. When I needed to phone a friend or use a life line. From a lofty height we wage war. On the poltergeist with the exalted christ. Spark the dark with the pulse of light. Strike a corpse with a pulse of life. I spit on the tidal it's tidal waves. I spit on the apple and kill a worm. A fire in cali will swallow a valley. For every african village burned. Jay elect would've never made it. O' son of man, o' son of man. Who was the angel in revelations with a foot. On water and a foot on land?. Who was the angel that rode a harley from. The project to the house of parliament. And opened the book in the devil's chamber. And put the true name of the lord in it?. Old jerusalem, new jerusalem. Comes like this beast with a ball of fire. They poisoned the scriptures. And gave us the pictures of false messiahs. It was all a lie. Mystery babylon, tumbling down. Satan's establishment crumbling down. This is the year that I come for the crown. Bury my enemies under the ground"

Socks on concrete, jolly rancher kids. I was talking back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib. Bunch of tank top, nappy headed. Bike-stealing chatham boys. None of my niggas ain't had no dad. None of my niggas ain't have no choice. Jj, mikey, lil derek and them. 79Th street was america then. Ice cream truck and the beauty supply. Blockbuster movies and harold's again.

May the lord give your journey mercy. May you be successful, grant you favor. And bring you back safely, I love you. [outro: jeremih]. When I was so young before I could remember. I would always treat my gang like family members. Even when I changed, a nigga never changed up. I always bring my friends, my friends. My friends, my friends up.

Chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?. Did a ton of drugs and did better. Than all my alma mater. Motherfucker money dance. Hundreds zan, gallon lean. Make a joke bout leno's hair. Then piggy back on fallon's spleen. Balancing on sporadicity. And fucking pure joy. Nightly searches for a bed. And I just came off tour with troy. But I can't complain. I got some motherfucking bitches. How many lab partners have. I fucked since I got suspended?. Mr. bennett, you done did it. You did it, you did it. You did a good ass job. You did a good ass job. And I'm good. [hook]. [verse 2]. Work, work, work, work, bang nigga, bang. Twerk, twerk, merge. Swerve, dang, pick a lane. Flip a bird; pigeon. Plane, it's a word, it's a shame. But god I'm good, swear I couldn't be better. Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames. Keep a tab on my exes. Keep some ""x"" on my tongue. Keep my work out in texas. That's just me flexing my lungs. See them showing they teeth. That's just them flapping they gums. If they bite and I'm snapping. Clap clap collapsing they lungs. Call me chancelor the rapper. Please say ""the rapper"". Magical word (poof) , please say 'kadabra. Replay the replays; green bay, the packers. Cremate your teammates. And freebase the ashes. Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk till dawn. It's just us, and trust ya bottom bitch. My stuff the fucking bomb. I'm the motherfucking fucker. Fuck a niggas fucking dumb. This your favorite fucking album. I ain't even fucking done. I'm good! igh!. [hook]"

acid rain,"Chance's ""NaNa"" ad-lib. Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain. Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane. The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace. Spineless bitches in backless dresses. Wore my feelings on my sleeveless. My weed seedless, my trees leafless. I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses. And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus. Before I believed in not believing in. Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in. Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin. My big homie died young; just turned older than him. I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always. He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways. I trip to make the fall shorter. Fall quarter was just a tall order. And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty. As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y. And all my words just mean controversy. Took the team up off my back, like ""That's not your jersey? "". Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked. All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick. Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich. Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams. Sometimes the truth don't rhyme. Sometime the lies get millions of views. Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?. From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view. I think love is beautiful too. Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do. For future hoopers dead from Rugers. Shooting through the empty alley. Could've threw him an alley-oop. Helping him do good in school. Damn that acid burn when it clean ya. I still miss being a senior. And performing at all those open mic events. High schools, eyes closed seeing arenas. And I still get jealous of Vic. And Vic's still jealous of me. But if you touch my brother. All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you. And the rest of your team. Smoking cigarettes to look cooler. I only stop by to look through ya. And I'm only getting greedier. And I'm still Mr. Youmedia. And I still can't find Talent. And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck. Mom still thinks I should go back to school. And Justin still thinks I'm good enough. And Mama Jan still don't take her meds. And I still be asking God to show his face. And I still be asking God to show his face. I am a new man, I am sanctified. Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized. I have been born again, I am the White Light. Rain, rain don't go away"

Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics. Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key. Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing. If I don't know what I miss is. I'ma end up figuring out that it's home. And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses. This is just a testament to the ones that raised me. The ones that I praise and I'm thanking. I need em but the chronic all up in my clothes. And I wanna get a hug, and I can't cause I'm stanking. Never too old for a spanking, igh. [refrão 2]. Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank.

That I'd make it even if I never make a milla. When I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chillin'. And everything's good. I ain't really that good at goodnight, I ain't really that bad at sleepin. With bad bitches, put them aside, I used to be thirsty creeping. Now I'm out working evenings birthdays even Tuesdays Wednesdays Thursdays weekends, rehearsing verses, murdering merch and events. Damn it feel good to be a gangsta. And it feel good for me to thank you. Put money back in your bank account. Off of songs I barely could think up. Cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up. Make sense, but they never gon' make a sound. I'm better than I was the last time, crescendo. Thanks Justin, lending them pencils. Mr. Menzies, Mensa, Chris Minto. The time I beat Chris on Nintendo. Nanana hey hey, good intro. Remember jacket shoppin' after listening to Thriller. Remember the first time you heard this dude and thought damn that's that nigga. Everything's good"

""this ain't the nigga you said spittin', is it? "". Two-step - white dude's Harlem Shake. Why you laughing? Cause you Harlem Shake?. I was never fake, I was just too good to be true.

The first, is that god is better than the world's best thing. God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer. [verse 1: chance the rapper]. Magnify, magnify, lift it on high. Spit it spotify to qualify a spot on his side. I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies. Lullabies and alibis. The book don't end with malachi. Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen. 'til one score and three years. From the third when he doesn't. My village raised 'em a child. Come through the crib and it's bustin'. You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins. Shabach barak, edify. Electrify the enemy like hedwig till he petrified. Any petty peter petigrew could get the pesticide. 79Th, 79th, I don't believe in science. I believe in signs. Don't believe in signing, I seen dollar signs. Color white collar crime. Good god, the gift of freedom. Hosanna santa invoked and woke up slaves. From southampton to chatham manor. My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm james early. The type of worship make jesus come back a day early. With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed. Hear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me. Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery. I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody. Exalt, exalt, glorify. Descend upon the earth with swords. And fortify the borders where your shorties lie. I used to hide from god. Ducked down in the slums like ""shh"". [verse 2: jay electronica]. I was lost in the jungle like simba after the death of mufasa. No hog, no meerkat, hakuna matata by day. But I spent my night time fighting tears back. I prayed and prayed and left messages. But never got no hear back, or so it seemed. A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream. I build the ark to gently, gently. Row my boat down noah's stream. Sometimes the path I took to reach. My petty goals was so extreme. I was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine. But you was always there. When I needed to phone a friend or use a life line. From a lofty height we wage war. On the poltergeist with the exalted christ. Spark the dark with the pulse of light. Strike a corpse with a pulse of life. I spit on the tidal it's tidal waves. I spit on the apple and kill a worm. A fire in cali will swallow a valley. For every african village burned. Jay elect would've never made it. O' son of man, o' son of man. Who was the angel in revelations with a foot. On water and a foot on land?. Who was the angel that rode a harley from. The project to the house of parliament. And opened the book in the devil's chamber. And put the true name of the lord in it?. Old jerusalem, new jerusalem. Comes like this beast with a ball of fire. They poisoned the scriptures. And gave us the pictures of false messiahs. It was all a lie. Mystery babylon, tumbling down. Satan's establishment crumbling down. This is the year that I come for the crown. Bury my enemies under the ground"

Who taught all these rappers that a big deal's not a big deal?. Inherited the earth, popped them wheelies on a big wheel. My enemy lives in his mother's basement. That's why my videos don't got no Baphomet product placement. I'm a real one. The honey is sweet, the apple's bitter. They'll try to convince you you stronger without your woman than when you with her. And tell you they kidding while Twitter trashing your litter. I know the devil's a liar. I know that players is quitters, I heard you hire your hitters. I know the higher the bidder, that mean the less on return. So I just hire a sitter. I'm not no boss nigga, I'm a soldier.

And gettin' chased by their baby mommas. My first tat was on my stomach. Got a pocket full of money. And a mind full of ideas. Some of this shit may sound weird. Inside of the maybach. Look like it came out of ikea. Run shit like diarrhea. Big yacht, no pies there. Aye, aye, captain. I'm high, captain. I'm so high. Me and god dappin'. This is my blessin'. This is my passion. School of hard knocks. I took night classes. [hook: chance the rapper]. You don't want no problems, want no problems with me, bih!. You don't want no problems, want no problems with me.

Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns. In the streets my face a coupon. Her pussy too warm. All these bitches come to do harm. Just bought a new charm. Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm. I'm uncle luke with the hoes. Pretty bitches, centerfolds. Tippy toes around my crib in their robes, just their robes. Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase. Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race. Fuck wrong with you? what you thinkin'?. What you thought it was?. I just popped five percocets and only caught a buzz. And if that label try to stop me. There gon' be some crazy weezy fans waitin' in the lobby. Mula, baby. [hook: chance the rapper].

same drugs,"[chorus 1]. We don't do the same drugs no more. We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs. Do the same drugs no more. Cause she don't do the same drugs no more. We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs. Do the same drugs no more. [verse 1]. When did you change?. Wendy, you've aged. I thought you'd never grow up. I thought you'd never.

[outro]. (turn it around. I remember when. This age of pathetics). Don't forget the happy thoughts. All you need is happy thoughts. The past tense, past bed time. Way back then when everything we read was real. And everything we said rhymed. Wide eyed kids being kids. Why did you stop?. What did you do to your hair?. Where did you go to end up right back here?. When did you start to forget how to fly?. (it's so natural. Just like juicy fruit. Works like a magic trick. Please give me half of that...). Don't you color out. Don't you bleed on out, oh. Stay in the line, stay in the line. Dandelion. (do the same drugs no more. We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs. Do the same drugs no more. We don't, we don't, we don't...). Don't you color out. Don't you bleed on out, oh. Stay in the line, stay in the line. Dandelion"
