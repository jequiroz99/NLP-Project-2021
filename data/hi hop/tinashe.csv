Don't trip, everything will end up just fine. The summers they ain't the same. These lovers they ain't the game. These feelings, they don't mean nothing. These ceilings can keep the pain. Explanations you say I deserve it. Why after all this time. I'm finally worth it. Ain't it funny, a power comes with money. And how now I'm out here poppin'. They come back like they're an option. Man this shit is hella scummy. They claiming that they love me. Cause they realize that my time is finally coming. They know it. Cause my night is young. Moon is high. The stars are all. Alligned"

Come and spell me back for us. I was waiting on you. Waiting on you. The leap, leap, leap. To dark, to the down. Leap, leap, leap. For you, for me. Late of the night I'm suffering. Moons have gone by it seems like dozens. Why do I feel so numb?. Hear me now. If you're the man you claim to be. Why do you dream a life without me. Never make a move, never make a change. I need it, I need it, I need it. To make a shift of faith"
