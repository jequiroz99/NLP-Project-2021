when it rain,"[Intro]. Have you ever been, uh, stiffed at work?. No, I've never been stiffed... at work. [Verse 1]. With a bat. Go dangerous on that cat. Go Traxman, hit it from the back. DJ Assault, bitch, let me bang. Bruiser Brigade, we run that train. Put that thang in her caboose. Only way you hang is with a noose. Beef with us, it ain't no truce. Y'all niggas lame, y'all ain't like us. Hanging with the devil off angel dust. For that money, in God we trust. All fall victim for greed and lust. Who you 'pose to trust when guns gone bust?. Living every day like it's the end. Just waking up, feelin' like a sin. Gotta keep a eye on your friends. Cause everybody hungry in them streets. Nigga rob ya grandma for something to eat. Know it's fucked up, that's how it be. Growing up living everyday in the D. And it don't seem like shit gon' change. No time soon in the City of Boom. Doomed from the time we emerged from the womb. So to cope, drugs we consume. Here we go, now, here we go. Ain't no water, how a flower gon' grow?. Ain't no change, then how we gon' change?. No umbrella, we stuck in the rain. Dark clouds hanging all over our head. No sunshine and them showers be lead. Lighting up squares and them dots be red. Now ya best friend gets shot in the head, damn. [Bridge 1]. Oh, you ain't know that. When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now. Oh, you ain't know that, did you?. Better duck when you hear them gunshots go off. Pop off when them shots go off. Knock off, you try to play me soft. Glocks all in yo face, dog. No baseball, better run home. Hit ya lung, blood on yo tongue. Exorcist, yo head get spun. Exodus, I might forget. Bitch, when it's time for your ass be done. [Pre-Hook]. You ain't heard it like this before. They don't do it like this no more. That get on up, that get on up. That get on up, up on the floor.

When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now. Oh, you ain't know that, did you?. When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now. [Verse 2]. Time for the percolator. Murder music orchestrator. Point blank hollow tip circulator. Your ass lucky if you on respirator. I'm like Vega rolling with that blade. Kid don't play, wanna catch that fade?. Shoot the house party up with them K's. Shut down when we hit the DJ. That Detroit shit, do the Rambisco. Minks and Gators, pistol the disco. Eating crawfish up in Fishbones. Heater off safety, watching the Pistons. Niggas get pissed on no-fly zone. Call Uncle Trick when you hit my home. Beef with him? Don't hit my phone. D vs. everybody, ain't no song. Coming from the city where them goons be lurking. Get caught slipping, yo ass will be hurting. That's for certain, yo ass be curtains. Young niggas out there puttin' that work in. On you scoring for a pair of Jordans. Whole damn city probably got a couple warrants. Why the county jail always stay crowded. They don't give a fuck, they just go POP. [Bridge 2]. Oh, you ain't know that. When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now. Oh, you ain't know that, did you?. Better duck when you hear them gunshots go off. Pop off and all them shots go off. Knock off, you're tryna play me soft. Glocks out in your face, dawg. No baseball, better run home. [Pre-Hook]. You ain't heard it like this before. They don't do it like this no more. That get on up, that get on up. That get on up, up on the floor. You ain't heard it like this before. They don't do it like this no more. That get on up, that get on up. That get on up, up on the floor. [Hook]. Oh, you ain't know that. When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now. Oh, you ain't know that, did you?. When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now. Oh, you ain't know that. When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now. Oh, you ain't know that, did you?. When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now"
"really doe (feat. kendrick lamar, ab-soul and earl sweatshirt)","[Verse 1: Danny Brown]. You niggas don't even know. All that talk then no show. Cannot tell me nothin'. Show me somethin' I ain't seen before. That hoe want my piccolo. Smoking on that mistletoe. Make her kiss all on it. While we chop chop on them 24s. She look like a centerfold. Mouth all on my genitals. Suckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals. I be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles. Poke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules. Rolling up them vegetables. Rapping with that special flow. Only way you're next to blow if you be strapped with C4. I be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show. Used to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe. Now I sell out all my shows. Used to sell out all my blow. That was back when we was coppin' dubs. to try and roll up 4. Now a nigga livin' good. I done made it out the hood. Think I'm goin' back?. I wish a motherfucker would. [Hook: Kendrick Lamar]. Yeah, they say I got the city on fire. I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah. Really doe, like really doe. Really doe, like really doe. They say I got the city on fire. I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah. Really doe, like really doe. Really doe, like really doe. [Verse 2: Ab-Soul]. Still wicked as Aleister, Crowley niggas know me well. For heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell. When you're getting money, nigga, every day is sunny. I'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail. Second grade, took my mama weddin' ring, took that bitch. To show-and-tell, now I'm married to the game to no avail. Grounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck. Employer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer. With ambitions of a rider. and half the shit on my rider I don't even want. the Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts (chyeah). Givenchy bikers with the rev rips. Balmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick. Paid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips. Soulo Ho3 the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition. Oh yeah, now a nigga livin' good. But good could be better I wish a motherfucker would. [Hook: Kendrick Lamar]. Yeah, they say I got the city on fire. I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah. Really doe, like really doe.

Life is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya. Life to end in vain before the end is near. See I can hear you crying. Silence sittin' in the dark. Holdin' crosses 'cross your heart. Sin is such a work of art. Watch out for the love lost. [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]. Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand. Things a nigga do for thousands. Made a million counting sheep. Gave it all to public housin'. Taking off to Abu Dhabi. Beamin' up the motor, Scotty. Talking to promoters, Scotty. Everybody know it's Gotti. Murder one, you've heard of them. The rev undid, the all day madness. Got it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress. Big power, big stages. My zoo cannot fit the cages. This booth is not used to fakin'. My crew just love confrontation. I chewed the face off the laces. I moved the weight from the waitress. I chef the pot that made poison. I cooked then kicked all the patients. My bitch is way beyond basic. That's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance. Ayy, look what we're enduring. Ayy, ridin' in foreigns. Ayy, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch. But it's the real watch and that bitch fire. Speed Racer waitin' outside. The roof on it like a tank top. Countin' money, watchin' paint dry. When I'm done is when the rain stops, uh. [Hook: Kendrick Lamar]. They say I got the city on fire. I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah. Really doe, like really doe. Really doe, like really doe. They say I got the city on fire. I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah. Really doe, like really doe. Really doe, like really doe. [Verse 4: Earl Sweatshirt]. Good, hood. I wish you motherfuckin' would. Listen, wish a motherfucker would, Brown. I had to put my foot down. It's like I'm popping a clutch. Your hate palpable, your jaw full of dust. You gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up?. And I'm the type of nigga. it ain't never been an honor to judge. You a mouse that the falcon picked up. So disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month. I was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck. And I never pass my mama no blunt. And kept my hair straight. Listen deadweight never been a problem to dunk. Look, I just broke up with my bitch. 'cause we ain't argue enough. I keep it dirty as a spliff my uncle Alchemist puff. I strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club. I wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must. It's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sick, countin' your dubs. Either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks. Loungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts. You've been the same motherfucker since 2001. Well it's the left-handed shooter, Kyle Lowry the pump. I'm at your house like. ""Why you got your couch on my Chucks? "". Motherfucker"

downward spiral,"I'm sweating like I'm in a rave. Been in this room for 3 days. Think I'm hearing voices. Paranoid and think I'm seeing ghost-es, oh shit. Phone keep ringing but I cut that shit off. Only time I use it when I tell the dealer drop it off. Had a threesome last night, ain't matter what it cost. Couldn't it get hard, tried to stuff it in soft. Had to fuck em both raw, keep my fingers crossed. Been grinding on my teeth so long it's swelling up my jaw. Nothing on but my bathrobe and pinky ring. Your worst nightmare for me is a normal dream. And if I learned anything. Is don't nod off with ya motherfucking cigarette burning. Knocking on my door but I won't answer. Residue on mirrors, Jojo dancer. [Hook]. And it's a downward spiral. Gotta figure it out (out). I gotta figure it out (out). I gotta figure it out. Cause it's the downward spiral. I gotta figure it out (out). Gotta figure it out (out). I gotta figure it out. [Verse 2]. Everybody say, you got a lot to be proud of. Been high this whole time, don't realize what I done. Cause when I'm all alone, feel like no one care. Isolate myself and don't go nowhere. Smoking blunt after blunt, 'til my eyes start burning. Hennessy straight got my chest like a furnace. Drowning frustrations in a ocean of sin. Thinking irrational, I have no emotions. Cold cold world, some might say. Freezing on the snow, brain feel a bit frostbit. Nauseous, don't know the last time I ate. But I eat these fucking rappers like fucking last steak. On death row, feel like I am. You never know, one day you're here, the next you're gone. So I put it all up in these songs. [Hook]. And it's a downward spiral. Gotta figure it out (out). I gotta figure it out (out). I gotta figure it out. Cause it's the downward spiral. I gotta figure it out (out). Gotta figure it out (out). I gotta figure it out"
from the ground (feat. kelela),"[Verse 1: Danny Brown]. 8 balls wit a safety pin. I deserve the finer things. Told myself back then. When I used to ride a Schwinn. Now I'm on a tour bus. Going places I ain't never been. Wrote my rhymes down on a paper bag. That was way back. Having dreams of a Cadillac. Dog, I had to bounce back. Locked a nigga up. Why they do me like that?.

So while I'm counting bars y'all be counting sheep. No cheat sheet, get it out the mud. Get it how you live, why I'm out here in the field. My nigga wake up, wipe the cold out your eyes. It's a cold, cold world but even hotter when you die. So no try to do, what about you?. Work off, well met, do the same thing too. A lot locked up wishing they was like you. Got a letter from my nigga saying he be out in June. Been down for a minute and every since sentence. Things ain't been the same so I'm missing my nigga. Staring at the ceiling thinking how far I came. Was trapped in the storm but I made it out the rain. [Hook: Kelela]. You turn around, and now I'm winning. I built it up, from the ground. You stay asleep, I'm gonna get it. I built it up, from the ground"

And I gotta hunch. Roll another blunt. Call some hoes up nigga lets do some bumps. Caught up in the whirlwind. Life took a tail spin. Hid behind designer shades. Life of sin. Lost control.

grown up,"Remember when my first meal was school lunch. Now I spit a 16 straight with no punch. Remember all for dinner. All we ate was captain crunch. Now we blow big blunts on the way to brunch. Went from good fella to commissary slips. Now I got back up man every time I slipped. Never ever quit, I just kept on pursuing. Teacher always ask me, what was I doing. Scribbled in my notebook. And never did homework. Low attention span. Guess these adderall worked. Rocked tommy hil shirts. Ones with the boat. Rockport kicks way before we even smoked. Used to have baby lungs. Choking when I hit it. Nowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting. Remember back then we thought we growed up. Rushing at a kid just to be grown up. Rushing at a kid just to be grown up. Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up. I can eat a pound and shit sixty four quarters. Burn up fire and drown drops of water. Son, I told you I got them beans like goya. Gone off them pills. Got me jumping off the sofa. Hotter than a hot pocket. Out the devil microwave. Model bitches begging. Just be a nigga's sex slave. Exotic foreign garments lookin' tailor made. And when these bitches see me man. They wetter than the everglades. Everyday same shit, me getting paid. Waking up, new bitch, it's me getting laid. Used to take bottle back. Waitress bring the bottle back. Now they see me shining. And they looking like a sour patch. Nigga catch a heart attack. Newport soft pack never blow blunt wraps. But these blunt raps sewn up. Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up. Rushing at a kid just to be grown up. Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up"
hell for it,Holy spirit. When I look. I cannot see. Reflection in the mirror. Broke bread with the Judas. And I think I see it clearer. These niggas want what's mine. But I be damn if I'm a give up. Stuck up in the hood. Praying rap would get me out. Momma ‘bout to lose her house. Gotta figure this shit out. Use to catch the bus to 12th. Just to hustle for some Prada. In the kitchen with my uncle. Beat the pot like a piñata. Baraka wit the product. Use to hide it in my closet. Type of shit. That have a fiend. Crawling on his carpet. Walking over carcasses. Of artists in my garden. Nice with the bars. Even the beat begs my pardon. Got me mistaken. Muslim salami bacon. Always on the defense. So it's no offense taken. I'm smoking on them raisins. From the bay they taste amazing. Cajun kicking flavor. All the time. Not on occasion. Would be amazed. All the time I heard I wouldn't make it. I was writing shit that was so damn amazing. When half these little niggas was still watching. That's so raven. I was out there hustling. Scraping up and saving. Just to catch a 12 hour bus to NY. Sleeping on the floor in studios. Asking God why. But never got deterred. From the voice I heard inside. Tell myself everyday. The greatest that's alive. [Hook]. And I'm a give em hell for it. Until it's heaven on earth. My nigga. I'm a give em hell for it. For whatever it's worth. My nigga. I'm a give em hell for it. Unless death come first. My nigga. I'm a give em hell for it. For whatever it's worth. My nigga. I'm a give em hell. [Verse 2]. Cause we living in that. Actavis double cups was addicted to that. Had them demons on my back. Was escaping through that. Blamed everybody but myself. Apologies for that. So they hold a nigga back. For the way that I act. People scared of doing business. Thinking I smoke crack. I react immature. To anyone talking smack. Cause where I'm from respect. The only thing that you have. Grew up virtually poor. Realities unmasked. So my task. Is inspire your future with my past. I lived through that shit. So you don't have to go through it. Stepping stones in my life. Hot coals. Walk with me. Listen when I speak. Every time talk with me. Couple screws loose. You don't wanna start. With me.

In the Caddy Ron Isley on between in the sheets. And a way a nigga work make a grip in a week. I'm a chill with this freak. Sniff a gram and a half. Plus her pussy juicier than Shalamar curl bag. While she draw me a bath. Roll a blunt then passed. Giggled and jiggled her booty. Couldn't do nothing but laugh. Credit cards separating. White lines on a mirror. Roll a 100 dollar bill. Now my sinus all clearer. Flat screen porn on. Watching Asa Akira. Nothing on but my pinky ring. Sniff when I get up. On the balcony drunk. Like the world is mine. Staggering inside with my robe untied. [Hook]. So fuck waiting round. Nigga I'm about to get it. Dog I'm tryna eat. So I'm staying in the kitchen. Hunched over the stove. Gotta water water whip it.

Cutting up the hard like the yard ain't filling. [Verse 2]. I'm like Spielberg. With ill words and hoes on that curb. Gotta screw loose. I'm cuckoo. Mentally disturbed. But still smart enough. To hit this bitch wit a rubber. And with ya wrinkle pussy. Hoe can't be ya lover. But I still get the head. If you swallow with bubbles. I'm a Linwood nigga I done traveled the world. Made a name for myself use to serve on the curb. Now my words worth a bird. I could front you a zip. Made a million in a year and I still ain't trip. Bout to put my niggas on make a million for them.

My dick head, she celebrate like the world end. And she could be my girlfriend. Only fuck her on the weekend. Momma found some racks in some dirty jeans. Told her keep the money, take 'em to the cleaners. Threesome watched how this dick came between them. Licked the clit and she did the Macarena. Crib in the forest, deer in my yard. '07, I got locked up on a charge. Now a nigga got four bank cards. Looking like a nigga gotta thank God. Going through a bag like I'm snatching purses. Half a key of raw inside my fucking verses. Like a surgeon with that scalpel, bring that track to life. Bounce that ass for that pussy, got a appetite. Geeked up, geeked up, pop a pill just like Mike and Ikes. Head sent me straight to the moon with a mac tonight. Running low on alcohol, nigga gotta make a call. Stay afloat, try not to choke. [Hook]. Made 30 bands in 30 minutes.

"really doe (feat. kendrick lamar, ab-soul and earl sweatshirt)","[Verse 1: Danny Brown]. You niggas don't even know. All that talk then no show. Cannot tell me nothin'. Show me somethin' I ain't seen before. That hoe want my piccolo. Smoking on that mistletoe. Make her kiss all on it. While we chop chop on them 24s. She look like a centerfold. Mouth all on my genitals. Suckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals. I be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles. Poke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules. Rolling up them vegetables. Rapping with that special flow. Only way you're next to blow if you be strapped with C4. I be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show. Used to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe. Now I sell out all my shows. Used to sell out all my blow. That was back when we was coppin' dubs. to try and roll up 4. Now a nigga livin' good. I done made it out the hood. Think I'm goin' back?. I wish a motherfucker would. [Hook: Kendrick Lamar]. Yeah, they say I got the city on fire. I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah.

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]. Still wicked as Aleister, Crowley niggas know me well. For heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell. When you're getting money, nigga, every day is sunny. I'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail. Second grade, took my mama weddin' ring, took that bitch. To show-and-tell, now I'm married to the game to no avail. Grounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck. Employer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer. With ambitions of a rider. and half the shit on my rider I don't even want. the Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts (chyeah). Givenchy bikers with the rev rips. Balmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick. Paid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips. Soulo Ho3 the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition. Oh yeah, now a nigga livin' good.

Life is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya. Life to end in vain before the end is near. See I can hear you crying. Silence sittin' in the dark. Holdin' crosses 'cross your heart. Sin is such a work of art. Watch out for the love lost. [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]. Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand. Things a nigga do for thousands. Made a million counting sheep. Gave it all to public housin'. Taking off to Abu Dhabi. Beamin' up the motor, Scotty. Talking to promoters, Scotty. Everybody know it's Gotti. Murder one, you've heard of them. The rev undid, the all day madness. Got it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress. Big power, big stages. My zoo cannot fit the cages. This booth is not used to fakin'. My crew just love confrontation. I chewed the face off the laces. I moved the weight from the waitress. I chef the pot that made poison. I cooked then kicked all the patients. My bitch is way beyond basic. That's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance. Ayy, look what we're enduring. Ayy, ridin' in foreigns. Ayy, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch. But it's the real watch and that bitch fire. Speed Racer waitin' outside. The roof on it like a tank top. Countin' money, watchin' paint dry. When I'm done is when the rain stops, uh.

Listen, wish a motherfucker would, Brown. I had to put my foot down. It's like I'm popping a clutch. Your hate palpable, your jaw full of dust. You gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up?. And I'm the type of nigga. it ain't never been an honor to judge. You a mouse that the falcon picked up. So disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month. I was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck. And I never pass my mama no blunt. And kept my hair straight. Listen deadweight never been a problem to dunk. Look, I just broke up with my bitch. 'cause we ain't argue enough. I keep it dirty as a spliff my uncle Alchemist puff. I strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club. I wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must. It's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sick, countin' your dubs. Either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks. Loungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts. You've been the same motherfucker since 2001. Well it's the left-handed shooter, Kyle Lowry the pump. I'm at your house like. ""Why you got your couch on my Chucks? "". Motherfucker"
rolling stone (feat. petite noir),"[Hook: Petite Noir]. You know I'm living like a rolling stone. But don't feel for me. You know I'm in my zone. So don't speak to me. And in my mind I just feel so alone. Just release me. [Verse 1: Danny Brown]. Feeling like I got money. Know I'm just nigga rich. Even if she fuck me. I still know life a bitch. Bought a nightmare, sold a dream. Happiness went upstream. Blame myself, I had no control. Now I'm living with no soul. I'm on a road that never ends. Don't know opposite of sin. Some people say I think too much. I don't think they think enough. Time rough but it got rougher. Weight heavier up on my shoulders. Living crooked 'til it's over. Can't be straight, can't be sober. Thought process so immature. Can't make it up, up out the sewer. Feeling like there's no hope. Blaze dope, my mind float. I love her, she love me. Love ain't enough with no bucks. Fucked up, that's the way it is. I don't know who I should trust. Riding around with the windows up. Smoking like it's ten of us. Just me in the back seat. With the driver bumping them Isleys. I'm walking on this long road. Will I come back?. Homie, I don't even really know. [Hook: Petite Noir]. You know I'm living like a rolling stone. But don't feel for me. You know I'm in my zone. So don't speak to me. And in my mind I just feel so alone. Just release me. [Verse 2: Danny Brown]. Feeling like I'm not alive. But I know I'm not dead. Living lies but can't hide. Deep inside, the truth dies. Bought hope, can't get change. Lost my brain, going insane. Self-medicate is how I cope. Leave my body, soul go afloat. On a roll that never ends. Don't know where I should begin. Feeling trapped, no looking back. Head first in that deep end. Living like a rolling stone. When I die, I leave alone. Getting high, I feel low. But we all know life goes on. [Hook: Petite Noir]. You know I'm living like a rolling stone. But don't feel for me. You know I'm in my zone. So don't speak to me. And in my mind I just feel so alone. Just re. [Outro: Petite Noir]. All that I know. All that I know is to feel your shame. 'Cause you can't let go. 'Cause you can't let go, you drive me insane. But will I ever find my way?. Or go back to the beginning. There's a thing that I know for sure"
