I used to make money, now I just take it. I do what I gotta do to bring you to the concrete. Buckin niggas down cause they think shit is sweet. I keep a Tec whenever I'm in the projects. Ease out, then flex, in effect like Wreckx. Buck to your head, now die is my slogan. Don't front, you know I got you open"

But every good is duck this God right creation. My get down is all in my mans for the station. Bring ya four universal greatings which be peace. Travel worldwide, leavin my mark in the east.

I go to left, I never stop, because I can rough it the top of my head. Niggaz be like; yo, Shorty, I thought you was dead. I thought you was the vein from the way they had you strained. On the last time, on the rhyme, you brung pain. To all the other MC's, like my man, Five FT. Niggaz be like, yo Shorty, can you rock the mic please. Slapped on your skills, didn't think you had it. Your gonna shoot the mic, like my main peradict, on the mic. Give a check, one, two, to the head, niggaz be on your dick. So yo, yo, just come and flip a script. [5FT.]. Back up off this little trip. To pull the muthafuckin' dozen, give a dick. So, don't you dare, press your luck. The war has begun, and I'mma about to get in. Flip a script, pick a target & I shoot to kill. Cuz I deathstalk with the glock strapped to the right. Prefer grenades cause they get the job, done right. I blow but sneeze, let niggaz know what I mean. When I get mad, I go the muthafuckin' bloodstream. Bust a bitch in her throat and watch blood spill. As I get, an ill do, she die for her own will. I'm sending bodies after bodies to the morgue. And with an autopsy, somebody had a smorgesboard. Of jealousy, I feast the heart to body parts. As I spark up that L and get dirty after dark. One time, as I blow your muthafuckin' mind. It's time for me to get ill, and commit a mad crime. I went off throat, but, I keep the flow going. Keep it going, keep it up and going, and I'm just showing you. Just a little bit, of my lyrical skills. When I go with the skills that pay the bills, when I flip. And I rip, it's time to be - ahhh, fuck it. [Buckshot]. Inside of the mind, I see. I'm the type of nigga that you call a mad freak. Cuz I'm a scorpion, Buckshot Shorty, be. In your fucking drawers, yo, sharp like claws. Always break laws, cause I hate the fucking devil. Niggaz be on my dick, cause I'm a hardcore rebel. Look at the 85, you'se a dumb, deaf and blind. I'm the type of nigga, that flip the script, I hit from behind. Like my niggaz Mobb Deep, creep on the under. Yo, where's my man, Mighty-O, pass the blunt-a. A nigga like me, because I've been ya man for years. Word up, I knocked out beers, and then we knocked out years. And all the type of shit, that we did, me just can't hang with. We grab the glocks, bang-bang, bang-bang with. Niggaz on two-third, word up, served. When we got fucked up, yo, we just smoke the pound of herb. We never gave a damn, we went blow for blow. Niggaz were on our dick, because we're toe to toe. And niggaz pulled out knives and razors. But we pull out the muthafuckin' infered lazer. Right to the head, now pull, nigga. I'mma get swift with my trigger, take a swig of the 40. On the block, to park the yard. Niggaz be on my dick because I say that I'm God. Why, cause I'm God, cause I manifest the puss'. What? And I'mma catch you down. When I hit you with the push in the mush. In the green, from the textbook. Like the Holy Koran, when I drops the bomb. I'mma take it easy, cause you not ready for me. If I say this type of shit, you might just spit, or with. But if you, get it, yo, you gotta, dig it. Now I can grab the mic, check one, can you get with it. Yo, 5 F-T, bring it back from the top of the head for me, aight?"

Want me to flip? I flip. The rhymes I whip, hence back to Brooklyn in a flash. Thinkin about the weed and the stash, in the ash tray. Man I got ass on the way. Shit I got a call from Renee today. She got that bombay, I'm bout to put her on the block. where the drugs and the thugs stay. Pick up my money and send her on the way. You know what it's like. I fuck around and smack the chicken in the breast. Chill, you can get wet by the Hennyville spill. Buckshot I still kill. [Chorus x2: Buckshot]. You want some, you get some. I'ma bout to fuck around and bleed somethin. Don't start none, won't be none. But since you started, I'mma bout to rip apart shit. [Buckshot]. Aiyo, what ya niggas wanna do with us. Bucktown we bust, murder is a must. Everytime I think about commercial rap niggas. Leave the hood and scared to come back, niggas. I subtract them niggas, they aint a part of us. He ain't a part of my click, don't even start him up. He rock a 10 Karat, we rock 24 all day. Still smoke in a hallway. And I make more in a day, then you make in a year. So why the fuck is you in my ear. You still think it's sweat now?. Fuck the beef now. Yo Louieville take it to the street now. [Louisville Sluggah]. It's BDB and Hennyville ya. On fire like cheeba, get ya girl scream ""Mamma mia"". Aiyo I'm out of Henny's World with the go cart girls. My niggas barkin, while some turn over and nerve. Too many drinks son, it's affectin what you thinkin. Stop dummin, don't forget we Black Trumpin'. Yo I jump inside my Buggy. Aiyo shorty wanna wish me luck, I ask. If I win or lose, will you still give it up?. She giggled and pilled off, we had to laugh. Buck sever before we dash, it's in the bag. There it go, the checkered flag. I'm neck and neck with shorty for a second. I wouldn't believe she do me dirty. She tried to ram my tire, caught the divider. Flipped the entire car and caught fire. I kinda felt sorry, nigga, not hardly. Sittin in the window, startin smokin Bob Marley. [Chorus x4]"
confusion,"[Chorus x2: Buckshot]. It's just a day with another night. Another pray for another life. Another wrong with another right. Strong when I'm on this mic. Cuz it's always, a lot of confusion. [Buckshot]. Industry rule number 10 thousand and 80. Record company niggaz are shady, baby. Definetly, never maybe, or have to be. A pain in the ass, like 'fuck you, pay me'. Crazy, picture me slippin', like a broke transmition. I got both positions, I own both the missions. I wrote poems for commissions. I'm the leader for the squad, when the Gods. In a hard perdicament, like. Got a hot group, but need they contracts right. Or got jerked for your publishing last fight. Now you wanna act tight, let me give you advice. It don't matter if you that nice. Cuz the bottom line is the kind of mind, not the kind to rhyme. Sign, and sealed, delivered, delivered and signed. Right now, I know you wanna get yours. I'm out my prime, so I got to get mine before I'm out my mind. [Chorus x2]. [Buckshot]. Let's keep it real, y'all niggaz know the deal. Rap on your LP's and don't own 'em still. Don't own 'em, chill, don't it feel. Foul, don't own your LP, but you own your bills, now. Everybody got a story to tell, or glory to sale. But alotta niggaz bore me to hell. That's why the number one question. Where's Buck? Get the number one answer. Here, let's hear it up, listen up. Yeah, I'm back with the hounds, ridin' round. Cuz the hill look deep when you slidin' down, how that sound?. I'm from the Crown, plus parts unknown. Everybody who met me, took a part of me, home. Cuz I be fool droppin', never was with crew hoppin'. It's the true topic, that'll have y'all fools watchin'. Dudes stoppin', in the middle of their tracks, like wait a minute. Whose that, that's Buck, what the fuck?. [Chorus x2]. [Buckshot]. From ya, streets to the industry, friend or enemy. In the end it'll be, who got it, who don't, who want it, let's see. Niggaz say that underground shit. Like they don't want chips, yeah right, they don't want chips?. Let's get this straight, underground of '93 and '94. Ain't the underground of '98, I see it's too late. For y'all to relate, so fuck it. I left my show in the quarter to eight, a quarter to eight. And y'all can talk about me and them streets. Ain't shit to hide about BDI, I be in them streets. Back on my grind, this week, spread your little rumors. I'ma shut up, and this nine gon' speak. All y'all internet freaks and click-on thugs. On my web, get off my dick, you get no love. This ain't face, but I faith in the snub. After failin' with my OJ glove, show 'nuff, cuz. [Chorus x2]"
duress,"This is how the real shit. [Chorus x4: Buckshot]. Why the Devil keep fuckin with me. Why the Devil keep fuckin with me. [Buckshot]. Listen up yo, ah. Feel like the Devil got a personal grudge against Buck. What the fuck. Walkin thru the streets, mindin my biz. Fearin like the Devil know what time it is. Rollin my leaf, just bought a dime. Everything is spinnin in my goddamn mind. Hold up, wait a minute, speak a one time. It's too many voices in my head, I hear the flatline. Could of sworn I heard the voice whisper from behind. Kinda deep though, made a nigga creep slow and breath slow. Cautious, nautious I could feel it in my stomach. The Devil wanna blow the trumpet. Look at every step I take, I could feel it every breath I take. If I sniff up one time, I feel the earthquake. Damn the takes, so much to hold it all inside my chest. Feel like I'm bout to jest. Blow up, but before I do, I'mma take to them demoms. Schemin on whole crew. [Chorus x4]. [Buckshot]. I used to want a Beemer, I used to want a Benz. One thing that I never wanted was fake friends in the end. I knew that ones that stuck by me be, was the ones that see me. On the streets, not TV. It's an everyday, it's an all day. Devils and the cops will get me in the hallway. Hopes drop me in the for slay. Around the third, because I'm about to blow. And be the shit, my word. I don't give a fuck, I ain't trying to quit at all. Even if my back is up against the wall, I brawl. It's a struggle in life, and it struggles the game. But whatever you gain when you at your worst at you feel the pain inside. That's when I'm near my goal. I could taste success, gotta stay in control. See the world's cold, momma told me from day one. ""Prepare to blaze dum, play the game son"". As a juvenile, I always got into shit. Even If I didn't start, I was bound to flip. Gettin to me in the worst way. Shot my little nigga on his birthday. Rest in piece to my nigga Ray. I know the Demon want me next. I see you schemin on me next. But I'm about to flex, Devil you can check. [Chorus x3]. [Buckshot]. I'm livin in the world, where nothin is free. Gotta pay the Devil even if I smoke trees. Oh come on now, is it on now?. Smoke my weed and the public put me on foul. When the judge lock me up I see the jury smile. Gigglin, finger wigglin, he gone for a while. Hit a nigga, what? your shoes don't fit a nigga. You just wanna get a nigga, I figure. I'mma be the livin proof. Hit them niggas, blow up like koof. Put your smoke inside your face like poof. What now muthafucka? 98 Duck Down nigga. Straight to ya chest like arrow nigga. Straight shots, Devil wanna put me in the lot. Six street deep till a nigga rot"

fuck it up,"[Buckshot]. Call me, hits and say jack, cause I get no punani. Flippin' a script, leaving the sucker ducks behind me. I'm a threat to poetry, you know it's me. When you see brothers, running around, here now Duck Down. Here comes the Buckshot Shorty. Swingin' tracks, with more rhythm and blues then Berry Gordy. Doing damage, when I vanish an MC, and picture the dream. I'm a warrior, not Freddy Kruger Part Three. Slap that wack shit, you can face your arraignment. Life, I think you need some edutainment. Try to slave my mind frame, you catch a spazasm. Damn I feel good like a long awaited orgasm. I blow up like a nigga who doing life in jail. But failed, kick back and drink an L. Yeah, I'm the man that control with this. Run with a crew, and in my mind I'm a soloist. I don't walk, but verbally break x. That's why I got nuff respect, in this profession. But all punk sucker ducks, still don't know the answer. to the question. [Chorus x2: Buckshot]. How we gonna fuck it up? (Yo, it's fucked up). How we gonna fuck it up? (Yo, it's fucked up). How we gonna fuck it up? (Yo, it's fucked up). How we gonna fuck it up? (Yo, it's fucked up). [Buckshot]. Here I come, with the mic in my right. To get paid, plus raid the lime light. For any MC, that's so called, gets the props. I rock hip hop, non stop, to give nots. I'm the man, the original. Straight from Crown Heights, my life's subliminal. Make my mark then spark, intellect, you'll find. And give insight to the blind. I manifest the best when I step through. Five deadly styles, but I don't do kung fu. Give me the tool and I go buckwild. Bitches and niggaz on my dick because I'm versatile. So if you bite, I'll ignite the dynamite. Battle words, and battles gone, but I'm not that type. But I get hype, when I write to a format. Produced by Evil Dee, so now it's all that. Watch your back, cause I attack. And if you ain't down with Beatminerz, your. wig-wig-wack. [Chorus x2]. [Buckshot]. Lyrical genius, mic Mr. Wonderful. I grab the mic and make it turn like a run-do. Known to poetic, to terrorize, listen. This is a call to other mc's, time to televise. A smooth black brother on the rap scene. Doing my best to manifest to the fiend. That I can finesse, and excel beyond any dope. Guaranteed to turn the party out. I light shit up like a professional mob hit. No competition, cause the rest is garbage. Yeah, I'm not the one to get played. So back up off my dick, before I spark my renegade. Lyrical melodies are chosen. I revise the travel, cause the rest had 'em dozin'. Off, I'm the boss, don't forget it. When I rip it and stick it, manifest to the wicked. And wow, I don't smile when I catch wreck. Fuck the body blows, I'm going straight for the neck. [Chorus x2]"

Buckshot b-d-b-d and the Evil Dee, we rock fluently. [Chorus x2]. [Ruck]. Mr. McGee don't get me angry (why?). you wouldn't like it when I'm angry. Ill thoughts to the dome start to change me. Rearrange the, way I be kickin, my flavor. Even my neighbours. notice a change in the Ruck-est behaviour. [Tek]. Now you roaches don't even come close or approach this. What I be smokin leave your monkey ass chokin. Straight from yardie like the one Robert Marley. You hardly ever saaw me witout a bag of that bomb weed.

I'm steppin in hotter this year. wit my bredern dry-tear, my cousin wit no fear. so who - wanna come tess Top Dawg. They dig you out the ditch and then they take you to the morgue. [Steele].

Now I got fo' eyes to watch my back. plus my own two make it a full six-pack. Now we bring the ruckas to wannabee knuckas. Bodyin suckas like I change up my chuckas. [Buckshot].

Who rhyme from the last penny, up until the last dime. I don't play games at all. I'm at the bottom where the flames engulf, brains come off. Brave us off, it don't matter, when ya face up north,. it's no laughter. Everybody seen the joke after, choke half the. The niggaz in ya frontline, or in ya back up. One time, duke, you betta know who you dealin' with. No card, this is God, you hard of hearin' shit?. Listen up. [Chorus]. [Buckshot]. Let it be known, Buck be ahead of the throne.

But of course, each are free, at the age 10. Seen my first coffin, but I was sharp like cleets. So I, stuck with the plan, fuck with the fan. Got a label, plus an office, and a custom van. But that ain't interrupt the scan. Cuz with no deal, my Set Dip like we fuck with Cam. Bucktown to Uptown, Brooklyn to Manhattan. We make records, you make raps, so stand back. You not on my league, not on our level, either homey. Please, little homey, you'll be. [Chorus x2]. [Sean Price]. Aiyo, gun on my left and knife on my right. One in your neck is slicin' your wife.

And if you wanna bump makin dough let me know. I rather get paid with the paid program. You can keep your fame and fuck who's the man. I scheme and I scheme till I go get the green. And if you want a scene of the money fiend. Niggas ( ? ) hit the screen. Everybody in the house, if you want dough. You gots to let me know. [ CHORUS ]. [ VERSE 3: Buckshot Shorty ].

A few bitches on my list now. a few niggas get me pissed now, but who gon get dissed now. First, I kick a verse for them niggas that thurst for the liquid. When I kick it, check it. True soldier, started as a teen in rap thing. Now I'm like the rap Don King. Blastin thru the city with, no car. While you drivin your city whip, where ya jar nigga?. [more ""one-two's"" scratched]. [5 Ft.]. The problem is you didn't listen when I warned you. Now I took five step, now I'mma lawn you. Evaluated, elevated, escalated, exellerated. Even became more educated. Comin thru fully equiped, stick it to the script. Prepare for battle and war, causin the enemy to abandon ship. It's my turn to burn, the flame I desent like the sun. And catch rip with or against anyone. The heat is on, as knowledge is beein born. Creatin that electrical magnetic dorm. Consistant combagin, do you really think you can fuck with. This intelligent team of destruction. Forever buildin and destructin. Maintainin balance in our cypher. Keepin a more flammable fluid than in your lighter. Got enough energy to incite ya, excite ya. Yeah, I'm here to take ya higher to the Messiah. And get my earth wind & fire, Devil's a lier. You best to beware of the soul buyer. Better drive the lead ya to damnation, cancelation. But every good is duck this God right creation. My get down is all in my mans for the station. Bring ya four universal greatings which be peace. Travel worldwide, leavin my mark in the east. Many fakes and frauds be gettin applauded. At least ya brain weight, that of distorted. Got my peoples reachin it when they can't afford it. Forgetten the true factors of life. I'm bringin this drum thru my windpipe. My shit is mad tight. Shinin the true light, boastin ya adreneline. To take flight, Power Universals out of sight. Hah!"
onslaught,"[Featuring Busta Rhymes]. (verse 1 -- Buckshot). Buck spread love like the Pope but I never spread false hope. I bring the bomb squad close. Rock you with a dose of TNT. What you ain't believe in me?. I'm comin' back from of these who be thievin' me. I'm incredible also edible. Rock it in the stage show, see me in the interview. Wanna be worldwide but you get with I.

Feel the pressure burn wild like (comin' for you). (verse 2). I used to sit back and let a lot of clicks. get to my head, wanted to dead a lot of clicks. Broke wit' no chips, frontin' in the game wit'. a little record deal but still drive the same whip. It's a shame ain't it, the vision that they show you in the videos. would really make you think that you got the ghetto, oh. Don't get me wrong, I ain't tryin' to stay. But yo, at the same time I ain't tryin' to run away. A lot of family get left behind. back on the block still left to grind, some still do crime. some do time, but no matter what. none of my heads keep an empty shell inside the nine. Cock back, Buck on the Evil Dee track and make the mind react. Smoke a fat one listen to Buck and get black. As a matter of fact. even if you don't toke you can feel the contact. (hook). (verse 3). See you through the window to your rescue I guess you. heard the rest do all that wackness but in fact it's. Sounded kinda good 'til you hear this phatness. You lack this, what scrap this. Record this, oh my Lord this is the warning sign for y'all. B.D. wanna ball. Is you feelin' me? Let me know somethin'. And if you see me with you smoke well let me smoke somethin'. Pump it up like he, film me like Spike Lee,. body count like Ice-T, do it nicely. Hize to see the B.D. Buckshot rappin' he can make the bomb happen. All my heads stick to gun clappin'. don't change, from my street cats to my man Starang. Bang, bang, yo, can you hang yo. It's your own fault you got caught up in the rain yo. now in the onslaught.

Here comes the Buckshot Shorty. I kill black real, so guard your grill like naughty. Niggaz call me Jeffrey Dahmer, why. I'm quick to bombercars. That fuck your armor, cause I cause mad trauma. No comma, straight through your mama like acid. I fucked her, then I did it, that's why you's a little bastard. You talk mad shit with no back up, what's up, act up. You punk niggaz get smacked up, word life. You fuckin' with the wrong nigga. I fuck too many on the mic, they call me daddy long trigger. Mister Buckshot, makin' the gun hot. >From niggaz that fiend to see my little ass rot. Peep my style, check my level. I'm so hot, I shot a fuckin' fair one with the devil. Booyakya!, watch your back, grab your fuckin' gat. Here come brothers who are ready to act. Chorus: [samples of Busta Rhymes]. [Powafal Impak] 4x. Boom!! [the cannon]. (Repeat). Verse 2: Buckshot. Some pack a mac, I choose to pack a black 22. By my waistline, buckin' your whole crew. I step through, and represent Black Moon. First, before I kick a verse, I puff a bag of boo. Lyrically I freak your funk you never heard. My shit is so fly, when I kick it, it's absurd. Damn, how I wrecked your life with one record. Made your crew break up and girl get naked. Respected, because I work hard for my cash. Shakin' more flavor then Mrs. Dash. Look out below, my flow will hit your brain. I got dough, but I still hop the train. I'm bustin' niggaz open, Attica style. Yo, straight to the jugular, brother you're mad foul. Gimme dat, because I rock with the best. Yo, peace to the hardcore niggaz, fuck the rest. Chorus. Verse 3: Buckshot. Free, to the five, to the four, to the funk. I pop junk and keep the bump in the trunk. Puff the skunk and get high, Oh lord. Get on my skateboard and do a motherfuckin' driveby.

Cause I want beef, for you can hang here right. Yo, sometimes I wonder how the fuck you get a mic. But I don't sweat that, cause I 'm still paid. Niggaz get bucked down, bitches get sprayed. I do what I want, just so I can make loot. If it's an eagle, pack the gat son. You know how we do, true. Chorus. (Assorted shout outs 'til end)"
pressure iz tight,"[5FT.]. D.A.'s all over the case, judge in my face. Feeling the pressure, all over the place. Court officer playin' me close. So I won't position, post boat float, right through ya dough. ATB lawyer representin' me fo sho, a conviction, ain't hopin' to score. But bein' I'mma, fighter for life, I'm takin' these bastards to war. They actin' like they caught me, with a key in the raw. I'mma open my mind and beat this Rockerfeller law. So I can, flee the states and go on tour. On a, wing of prayer, I'm keepin' it faith. Throw yo, hands in the air, I'm bleedin' with hate. This little nigga had all he could take, for all the bullshit. I need a permanent break, see my freedom's at stake. Trynna put food on the plate, my knees can't wait. - All ya niggaz is bait, I'm so hard, all on my grizzy. Don't walk with Five, if you ain't ready to die, with me. [Chorus 4X: 5FT.]. Bringin' the heat, to these streets. No sleep, pressure is tight, pressure is deep, we. [Buckshot]. The block is sizzlin' now. Niggaz like fuck crack, I'mma bump cigarettes now. Hustlers don't hustle for profit nowadays. It hurt, niggaz put in work and maintain. Hard as fuck, the God is stuck. To get a buck, shit suck, but in God in trust. And if that fail, then a nine I bust. I play the side, when they side with us, I must. Flip for the dollar, like heads and tails. I go all out, cause I'm not about to fail. Not about to chill, son, keep it movin'. Don't sit still, cause I get it, the click will. Ya'll build, but I destroy. Scam dough out ya fam like Deac and Troy. But, I'm not a pastor, I just get dough faster. Than the average, has ta'. You play the wall like plaster, I play the block. Cops got a glock, now they wanna shoot a shot?. But this is what I do when I make a stop. Get a spot at a vacant lot, then I make it pop. [Chorus x4]. [5FT.]. I'm not playin' with it, while dudes fight for positin. And stay in it, hit it with vinyl, make it final and spin it. Cause I'm comin' to get it, hungry nigga on line, you can forget it. It's a done deal, when I spit, I'm your. Royal loyal, fully committed militant mind. Ain't spillin' every time, bong bong, shine. Many niggaz die for this, so I gotta survive this shit. Drop it hot and rip, poppin' blow the spot a bit. There's no stoppin' this, throw the lock, at a click. We shuttin' it down, I'm fuckin' around. Yeah, the fever bringin' plenty of fire to your town. Rippin' the flow, through the sound barrier. Strictly heavy artillery, air force carrier. [Chorus x4]"

I wake up in the evening...(we puff Li). Check the blahzay blah. I'm feeling the rhyme from the rhythm and the soul. I pack a 20 sack and watch a nigga fold. Don't you hate niggas who make records for bitches. It's all about the blunts. Fuck them stunts. Now, what ya want is what ya get. Like biggety bitch bend over blow me. So I can feel the breeze. Giving my enemies time to recollect on the past. When I bust that ass base to ya check. Figure I get bigger when I lose my beeper. Knock the head. Plus Knock the dred. All body dead. We be I and I be we cause we be family. Buckshot, Five FT and Evil Dee. T to the R-E-V and the M to the E-E-C-H-E. All my niggas in the place to be. Can I get an Amen?...(Amen!) C-D-B. [Chorus]. I like the night, if you like the night. I like the night. Bitchass niggas take flight. You want your gun I got your millimeter. I eat a sucka duckity smoke blunts by the centimeter. Right to way to serve the nigga on the curb. I love my niggas so my niggas puff herb. Now my niggas throw ya blunts in the air like this...(like this). Original crooks never get dissed. If we get dissed. Niggas get that to the back. Five where he at?...(right here!). Another mission to be dissing. Now who do I be dissing bitches. God, fuck the intermission. It's about killing the nigga. The one playing the bigger. The one playing the sucka ducks with my trigger. Feel the buck coming on in the set. Some Barley on the wreck. Fuck it, time to break a neck.

Four five six, niggaz in your spot, lookin' at shot. Thinkin' I'm sweet, like apricots. Cause when I let 'em know -- I can be Teddy Pendergrass. If you want me to let it go, I spit for life.

Shoot you in front of your kids, and been slid. To the next state, me and Beatminerz on the way up. Quick to slay up, the next up, fix ya face, don't miss the date.

Talkin' bout I can't come in? We bumrush. You see them niggaz with no grins, they from us. We all got big ones to bust, got a lotta respect. For them niggaz that never did, run from us. But respect ain't shit, when the tech spit. Two shots in your Lexus Coupe and your neck split. That's it, it's a wrap, you ain't know this and that. Will get you clapped, fuckin' with Shot, watch ya back. Cause we comin' through, runnin' through, murder in two. Anybody can get it, nigga, including you. It's awful, unlawful, how we kick down the door. Your jaw, hit the floor too, back up a little bit. Give me some room, niggaz ain't wanna give props to the Moon. Cause I'm underrated, the underdog, and you overhated. You know I made it, but you still tellin' me no favors. Fuck it, let's get it on right now. Alotta niggaz gone right now, but I'm born right now what?. [Chorus]"

You couldn't tell me other word to mother. When I was fifteen runnin around I was the real street lover. On the corner out shootin the dice. Layin up, gettin nice, talkin bout a heist. GQ headin up to one-two-five. Push up on a shorty lookin live on the prize. I couldn't get the time of day when I was Little K. Now you call me Buck so your lips wanna puck?. Fuck that bitch, I know your X amount of thoughts. But they call me Buckshot Shorty cause I take no shorts. Word to the shell around my chest. Big up to all de massive rudebwoy pon deck. So if you see a weak nigga speak to that bastard. Or I'ma hit his ass with the motherfuckin plastic. Word life, I ain't bullshittin. Buck em down (32X). Verse Three: Buckshot Shorty. When I was in school I was a mack. Shorty was strapped with a lyrical contact. knapsack, filled with the shit that I G'd. and a nickel bag of weed, yes indeed. A mad little nigga runnin up on em all. Fly as hell, hit the park play the wall. And all the older people sayin Shorty's a bad-ass. but youse a smart little nigga so you gonna last. They knew the time and they knew the rhyme woulda. hit you in at least four years, so I came to split ya. in the nine-three it's all about me. Ninety-four ninety-five that's my years fuck it I'm takin over. In nineteen-ninety-eight I couldn't wait. To get all my niggaz and do shows from state to state. Now I'm the motherfucker that's givin instructions. Fuckin with them niggaz Beatminerz on productions. Welcome to Bucktown, U.S.A.. Where the weak niggaz get their shit ass played. Buck em down (repeat 32X). Outro: Buckshot Shorty. Aiyyo, this is goin out to all the real niggaz. who buck down the bullshit, you know what I'm sayin?.

Black Moon, we out"
stay real,"[Chorus x2: Buckshot]. I, stay real, never change, it's alotta suckas. Who runnin' this game, I'm bustin' them thangs. Hah, peace God, it's no peace, now. I'm here to tear the streets down, I'm here to eat now. [Buckshot]. Yo, on the block that I'm from. Late night is a hustle hour. Anything gets sold, weed, clothes, plus the powder. Let's take a stroll, see what we lookin' at. Niggaz used to cook up crack, now they learned to hat. 2000 and up, what? Everybody got another. Scam to get a buck, Commander Lil' Buck. Well here I am, fam, damn. The pussy niggaz with powers, the ones. Who put the paper to the plan, so I take it to the fan. Police wears clothes the way I do it hand to hand. Plus I push the land cruise, with musc-lin' from the mobs. Who told me, God, build on what you got and praise the father. Perspect, I started the army, now we up and runnin'. Look, you dissed me yesterday when I was off. I'm on today, and now you up and coming. What a shame, that's what dollars do?. What makes you think when I get on, I'ma holla at you. You see how we do, you see how I dust this. Frontin' like you from the Ave, buster, bust this. Yo, it's the key to longevity. And I'ma show y'all niggaz why they all remember me. [Chorus x2]. [5FT.]. Full throttle, for ground water bottle. We about to celebrate it, like we just won the lotto. If, money for the makin' and money for the taking. Not to give a fuck less, about anybody who'se hatin'. I'ma conquer this mall, to conquer it all. And in a minute, I'm about to go bonker for y'all. I'm outta, control with it, where the darkest grow with it. With me and my militant mind, go head and blow with it. Take it to the top of the charts like 4th of July. Sparks, make sure my beats bark, meanin' the heat spark. Right or left, life or death. I give you everything I got, to my last breath. I, 718, Brooklyn to heart, the 5 and the beats from the dark. Te fever's unleashed from the start. [Chorus x2]. [Buckshot]. Let's take another trip, see what we can find. A whole lotta niggaz, runnin' outta time. Everybody's scramblin' to get a hand in. Everybody throwin' bows, but nobody landing. My plan is, the fans and them, got to hear the new shit. From my mans and them, niggaz that I move with. What's the movement, first of all, eye on the night. The rest of y'all niggaz rely on the light. Light beats, light hooks, light beef and you shook. The rap game like the crack game, the streets is cooked. Believe me, that nigga sellin' you soap, we can tell. The way he keep the shit clean, that I'm sellin' you dope. So raw, so uncut, uh, you can smell it through the placid. That be that classic acid, black, move and pass it. For the masses to get, learn the lessons. When you wonder why ya asses is kicked. Check it, it's the key to longevity. And I'ma show y'all niggaz why they all remember me. [Chorus x4]"
stoned iz the way,"[Buckshot]. Stoned is the way of the walk. In New York, shit is real, number one, grime this meal. Now I'm for real, my mind's designed to kill. Like muthafuckas who behind them chills, and I'm still. Settin' it off, lettin' it off, begin it. Rough til my ending, leavin' in trust linen. Little Buck, bad ass fuck, whatever now. Got smart with the hustle, shot clever now. Set 'em down, make way for the king. Hailin' from New York, New York, the big city of schemes. Man, I'm mean, it's so many rumors, cause I. Stay fly, and do crimes, with alibi. That's why, y'all be lookin' like, y'all them Brooklyn Knights. You know the type, gettin' niggaz on or off the night. So get on it right, cause we off the chain like bikes when they stoled. And all of my niggaz like when it's cold. Cause in the winter, I begin to, alotta other shit. Now BDI means Buck Does It. Hennessey, you guzzle it, cause wasn't this, the recovenent. If it ever was, we covered it, we thuggin' it. Like Joe and the R, no film, but y'all can still get shot. When you pose on your car, slow up pa. You should get you dough up, pa. So I can stick ya like a blow up doll, now grow up y'all. [Chorus x2: Buckshot]. Bidididididi-da-di-day, bidididididi-da-di-day. Stoned is the way - of the walk. In New York, shit is real. And everywhere you go, you know the deal. [Buckshot]. Now let me show you how the East Coast rock. Better yet, how these toasts pop. Keep frontin', and your magazine team don't need those props. Only mag' I need is on machine gun tops, now take it back. You said something? I said it back. And next time it's a bomb, in your watch, when you send it back. We the true Men in Black, cause we don't wear suits. And ties, when we shoot you guys, in fact. It's still Timbs and Carhart jeans. With my team in the dark art beam. Man, you know how hard I scheme, to get cream. To get this far and come off with a jar of steam. That's y'all dream, shit, pardon me. I got to make moves in the game, give a fuck about losin' the fame. Better yet, losin' ya brain, the more or less, losin' ya name. Cause you won't be losin' no pain, who movin' this mayne?. [Chorus x2]. [Buckshot]. Caught up in the street life, everybody think it's a sweet life. I mean, it's sweet, if you eatin' right. But nine times out of ten, the mind tricks the body again. The body go for the shotty to win. The brain split, ain't shit, niggaz talk alot. But loose lips sink ships, and you about to drop. And I don't mean no record, be double o, be double you. We never know, he never knew, check it. Boots and jeans, all hoops and dreams. The ghetto model just to get out of the ruthless scene. We call the hood, so it's all good, I hustled up state. In the woods, with po' nine, put your face in the mud. I had to grind, double time, get mine, listen to dudes. That shine, movin' through them ruthless times. [Chorus x2]"
that's the way shit iz,"[Intro: Buckshot]. That's the way shit iz. That's the way shit iz. That's the way shit iz. And that's the way shit iz. [Buckshot]. My man on the corner with a bottle of juice. Every day hustlin', botherin' you. Well, what would you do, if it came to you?. And the world put the blame on you, like it's your fault?. I was taught, no shorts, to take. Get everything I want and go for break. Go for broke, don't you know. Life is like one big door, closing slow. So, let's procede, gotta have probe bigger than the S.C.. Or, M3, or Benz 3, or them three, or anything. Of them things, so -- let's get deeper. Cause life is dictated through a speaker. And y'all need ta, peep the, bigger picture. Behind that, reefer, every generation needs a. New drug, to me, that shit been bugged. Well, I guess that's how it be cuz. The world won't change, and you can't change the world neither. [Chorus: Tek (Buckshot) {Steele}]. Every day all day, round the way. Gettin' chased by the rich, you wish. (That's the way shit iz). {Little homey just didn't make way. Got blazed on the strip}. (That's the way shit iz). Young g had money and the game. Got played a bitch. (That's the way shit iz). {All I know, is we gon' roll. And we won't stop til we make it rich}. (And that's the way shit iz). [Buckshot]. Living in the fucked up city. Walkin', trynna avoid beef, from often. Hawkin', by the same little dudes with a lil' food. Got a let fed, now they feel a little rude. Fuck feuds, they don't fight, they fire. Cause they won't let Buckshot retire. I, then keep it going though. When it get outta hand, don't tell so and so. Fam, niggaz be frontin', like they man. Wanna run to the cops, give 'em the drop on the shot. Damn, comin' out my crib, I seen two cops. Started wildin' out, thinkin' I'm 2Pac, bust 2 shots. Now it's a warzone, and I'm on the run. Plus I got a body on the gun, gotta call my son. Son, this is shit is off the chain. Nowadays, niggaz will do whatever for fame. There's no gain, no shame, it's a double o thing. Right now, the po' men love to go to pole main. [Chorus x2]"
that'z how it iz,"[Buckshot]. Keep thinkin' it's easy, like all you gotta do is. Spit a hot verse to get on, and cop them new whips. Hah, joke's on you kid, you hot on your block. But not off your block, you need to pay more dues, kid. ""Hold up, hold up, rewind that, I want y'all to hear. that again"". Keep thinkin' it's easy, like all you gotta do is. Spit a hot verse to get on, and cop them new whips. Hah, joke's on you kid, you hot on your block. But not off your block, you need to pay more dues, kid. I know you wanna and shit, cause on the streets. Rap is bigger than crack to flip. You like, watch me turn the o to a ki'. In one day, and one day turn to one week. See? I know you love the chains and the jeeps and. Hoes in the videos, make it so neat, like 'damn'. All I gotta do is learn, to spit a hot 16, and it's my turn?. 'Nuff la to burn - I earn my dues. Wanna do what I do, nigga, learn the rules. Rule one, what's that, never bite, cause when you bite. That's like rockin' ya man's drawers at club night. Ill, dis-gusting, keep bustin' flows. You wanna shit like 'keep bustin', whoa. Pause, rule number two and three. Is the same as four, respect the laws. Five is, what you in this for?. Cause there is guide in this rap shit, this ain't no image, pa. [Chorus: Buckshot]. It's not a game, in this game, everybody want bills. Everybody want mills, thatz how it iz. You can't explain the greatness, no fakeness. No imitation, thatz how it iz. Everybody wanna blow in the game. Some don't go long in this thang, that's how it iz. You can ask kids, the fact is. This rap shit, is not for the average. [5FT.]. It's not about, doing a demo, and gettin' on. It's about handling business, being focused and strong. It takes, a hell of a lot, to make it to the top. Your blood, your sweat, meltin' in the pot. Puttin' in work, around the clock. See this shit don't stop, it goes beyond. Studios, and the press shot. Originality rules, when you limit the style. You seen the fa-tality blues. Either you sound like Kiss or Jay, but y'all not them. That's when you lose, drown in the pool, before you could win. This is a grown man's game, with grown man's aim. Not everybody blowin' the game, is flowin' the same. You must perfect your craft, if you plan to blast. Take this, as a little, lesson to last. Instead of, gettin' the gash, you movin' to fast. Cause your eyes are locked on the bling bling and the cash. [Buckshot]. Shorty, I ain't gonna do shit, cabbage you. Say you nice, when you nice in average. You need to get your own flow mastered. Cause son already blew with that flow last year. [5FT.]. You claim you the nicest with identity crisis. Spit a whole heart to this jewel, cause it's priceless. Perfect to your tightest, your highest. Don't be a carbon copy, end up on the strike list. [Chorus x2]"
the fever,"""Baby, here I am"". [5FT.]. It's a total eclipse, alone with this track. Once the, moon turns black, the shit is a wrap. Step back, and give this legend some space. So I can, set the pace, I'm not playin' with the case. Call me the, hungry piranha, spit it like the llama. Fifty calibur, ride the road like no tomorrow. I gotta, deliver it hotter, and hotter. Wicked like Chaka, who dealt hot? Lick you a shotgun. Nigga, I top gun, number one question that's asked. Who gonna stop son, nah, nigga, not one. Slaughter the daily order, leave you wetter than water. Rest in peace to my nigga Headquarterz. And big Rah Rah, AVK Crew thick to the sky. All dangerous, all on the front line. Heads up, ears and eyes open. I'ma wolverine with a guillotine, wicked when I stroke it. I do it for the family, the struggle of life. Bought out the hell and the man in me. Being on top of my greatness, is where I plan to be. This is serious business, no time for fantasy. It's 5, BDI Thug and Evil Dee. Duck Down, cuz we buckin' the shot at this industry"

Feel the pressure burn a nigga like a Newport!. [Buckshot]. Comin for you. I used to sit back, and let a lot of shit. get to my head, wanted to dead a lot of shit. A lot of fake niggaz, frontin in the game with. a little record deal but still drive the same whip. Damn shame ain't it? The vision that they show you. in they videos'll make you think them niggaz moved out the ghetto. Oh? Don't get me wrong, I ain't tryin to stay. But shit, at the same time I ain't tryin to run away. A lot of family is left behind. A lot of my niggaz is left to grind, some still do crime. Some do time, but, no matter what. None of my niggaz keep an empty shell inside the nine. Cockback, fuckin up the Evil Dee track and make the mind react. Smoke a phat one listen to Buck and get black. As a matter of fact. Even if you don't smoke you can feel the contact. [CHORUS].

Fuck it, I'ma make it happen. All my niggaz stick to gunclappin, don't change. From my street niggaz up to my nigga Starang. Bang bang nigga, can you hang, nigga?. It's your fault you got caught in the rain, nigga. [CHORUS]"
this goes out to you,"[Steele]. Let it be known, you can't keep a good man down. Hard time, hardly wear me down. The strong survive, what comes around, go around. When the going get rough, we ride, lord, hold me down. Blood, sweat and pain, take it and strive. Nothin to do, it's breakin' my pride. My eyes on the prize, been through, tribulations and trials. I realize, I'm still gonna rise. [Buckshot]. I need one hundred percent, undivided attention. Provided you mention, Black Moon is back. And all the questions, like Smif-N-Wessun. Changin' their name to Cocoa Brovaz, did it ruin the track?. Let's think back, like the song I made. So we can reminisce the rights and the all wrongs I made. Don't get it twisted, I don't progress shit. I don't remember, but I don't forget, shit. That's how the game go, things get harder to spit. What's real love, without pain, the part of the shit. Who knows, few blow, few will get dough. It's the reason so many rappers never move with the flow. But I've shown, that I'm prone, to keep going. Cuz I flown, this goes out to you. This goes out to you. [Chorus x2: Steele, Buckshot]. This goes out to you, and out to you. Who didn't believe I wouldn't achieve. My goals, yo, I'm so, out of control. I just don't know. [Buckshot]. I started out with nothing, got a little talent. Came up with something, got a little violent. It was hardly thumpin', everybody fakin' moves. While I'm makin' moves and that party jumpin'. What part of me bluffin, huh? I don't see one. See guns, he run, leave sons with nothing. Stranded - handle it, stress on my chest. Like a tight lamel lid, I just -. Breathe in, breathe out, see what he about. And if there's no cheese, we leave him out. Cuz niggaz see the route that I'm on. Big movers for the kid to rule, everything abroad. See I was taught to write everything I saw. Been around the world, from the US to Singapore. You can learn a thing or more, from the veteran. No calm, wanna learn no more, just get a pen. [Chorus x2]. [Buckshot]. Me and Dru hooked up in '93. Started out as a management, then a record company. Even then they wasn't bumpin' me, but I ain't give a fuck. Still represented, every time I had to give them Buck. On stage in the studio, or on screen. They stayed out of sight, out of mind, if you off the scene. Knah'mean, I do too much for me to be enlightened. That's the reason, when you see me, you see me at night. Walkin', by myself, spliff lit by my lip, gun by my belt. Yellin' out, Duck Down is the label. Plus a million soldiers with me, nigga. Now that we able to make moves, and slay crews. And pay dues, cuz they rule. This goes out to you, this goes out to you. [Chorus x2]"

Who the fuck wanna test the son. Guns got developed in the war we fight. >From the weakest to the strongest. I been on tour for the longest at night. I used to dream about becoming the star when. I first seen the microphone feened the R. In 86 and now im in the mix. I like the blackstreet I need a fix. So call up the doctor its. Time to rock you with the shit. So sit back cause when I hear it. Beat bodies, niggas man I flip its. Repeat 1. I used to hear beats. Buck with the baseline. And 1 thing I never did was waste time. Rhyme after rhyme I got.

Mines for the takin, never fakin when I kick it. Girls be on my jock, they want a taste so they lick it. Rip it from the back, bust a nut in her crack. Big Dru Ha puffin lye and I'm out, black. [ CHORUS (2X) ]. Now you the man, now you the man, now you the man. Now you the man, now you the muthafuckin man. [ VERSE 3: Havoc ]. Niggaz regret it when they get wetted with the automatic weapons. When I walk the streets I pack a Tec for protection. You know the deal, nowadays shit is real. Kid, I had it up to here, muthafuckas better chill. Cause on the block, yes, kid, we get busy. Front on my crew and get bust open like a fuckin Philly. Punk muthafuckas on the mic get violated. A rhyme ain't a rhyme if it ain't crime-related. I'm bustin raps like a nigga bustin caps. I grab the mic, cock it back and kick the fuckin facts. Stompin niggaz out with my black Timbs. Leavin niggaz crippled with artificial limbs. A slug in the brain cause you tried to sham. You thought you was the man, you fuckin coward. [ VERSE 4: Tek ]. I'm with my ill niggaz troopin down Atlantic Av. Three blunts still plus there's weed in the stash. Timb boots flop as the l gets sparked. Play the ( ? ) from the street, it's flames movin in the dark. I've had it up to here with y'all weak-ass rappers. Bucktown, home of the Originoo Gun Clappaz. The name's Smif-N-Wessun and we're representin lovely. Smif joins the forces if you punks try to rob me. And I got his back, leave your body lyin flat. It's time to knuckle up, guard your grill, fuck that. Timberlands bootin up the ass of A&R's. You gettin surgery tryin to cover up the scars. You pussy ( ? ) bwoy, ( ? ) watch where ya stand. Smif-N-Wessun comin, lettin you know who's the man. [ CHORUS (2X) ]. Now you the man, now you the man, now you the man. Now you the man, now you the muthafuckin man. [ VERSE 5: Steele ]. These niggaz is crazy, but I get real rough, no question. Runnin with Black Moon, representin Smif-N-Wessun. The boy's crazy, boys roll Mobb Deep. Bring in Havoc, so get dramatic and get splattered in a heartbeat. Bits and pieces when I release the boom. These type of tunes kept me consumed in a rubberroom. Now I rock with Buckshot, what the fuck, ock. I got nuff props so you can get the fat cock. [ VERSE 6: Buckshot Shorty ]. I've got 1, 2, 3, let me know if you're ready for me. Lawd, you must throw your hands upon the mic and let em know. About the flow when you rip and stick it cause you must get wicked. Never hesitate to ( ? ) lyrical gangster, not lyrical prankster, see. Straight from the head of Buckshot hittin em real irie. Mi never come fi short, mi a-fi shoot upon di mic. You gwan fall like di Babylon on sight. Taught by my nigga Screwface how you shoe-lace. Let my nigga Bass tell me who take who place. Side up and up, side up and up, black. Yo chill, parlay, god, they ain't ready for that. They ain't ready for that. Everybody wan fly and get high but nobody wan die, why. Hey yo word up, kid. That's not that bullshit. Word, hahaha. [ CHORUS (4X) ]. Now you the man, now you the man, now you the man. Now you the man, now you the muthafuckin man"

weight of the world,"What what what what what!. [Chorus]. Holding the weight of the world, holding the weight of the world. Weight of the world on my shoulders (rock, rock, rock, rock). [Verse 1 Buckshot]. Yeah, I know you can relate to this shit right here,. feelin like you got a lot of weight. Sometimes you wanna bomb never hesitate, bomb first,. hold ya head up yo, get up yo. Got all these stressed out niggas with firearms. Prepare, get ready they about to bomb. First one hit usually an innocent civillian. Shot by the elevator dead up in the building. I'm illin' of the chill I got. Through my spine last night when I heard the shot. Took flight, cos I know that the Gods is right. Telling me you gonna make it when there's hard in life. And the stripes that you gain through the streets is pain. No matter how many motherfuckers is slain. Hold your head son, maintain. Fuck getting the tumour in your brain. Mutherfuck the rumour that you on came(?). Simple and plain, like piece of the pie. It's the hustle to get yours, Nigga I can't lie. I'm addicted to the high life, the wild life. Make the stress go by easy, when the bomb right. [Chorus]. [Verse 2 5 ft]. The weight of the world is on my shoulder. But, everyday I wake I find myself I'm getting bolder. As I annihilate, plus dominate. Thinking of ways to rise up, like a republican prominent. In the bomb state of thinking. Sometimes, life is like quicksand, if not watching your step. You end up sinkin. So pay close attention, don't be blinkin'. Cos you might miss the entire point of the words that we speakin'. [Chorus x1]. Holding the weight of the world (bomb first). Holdin the weight on my shoulder (booya!). [Verse 3: Buckshot]. The weight o' the world's on my shoulder. I'm never gettin younger, only gettin older. As I, walk the streets with stress. Hold my head, cos the more I finesse. Tap the plate on my bullet proof vest, YES!. I'm strapped in tight,. Cos I feel like some shit gonna happen tonight. I been eyein' a lot of niggas, closin' up. Eye on my jewellery, they frozen up (rock rock rock rock). Wanna stick me why? How come?. Jealous cos my shit is sophis, I don't fuck wit' none of them. Commercial rap get the Originno gunn clapp. Believe me, stress on my brain, roll a sack of that. Shit that'd make the devil dissolve. Holdin the world spinning on my shoulders wit' no prob. [Chorus]. [Verse 4 5 ft]. 5 o' cock on the dot.. I, I'm up performing callisthenics. While the muslims are making salot (?). And the Devil plots. The pressures of life got me rock. Plus my ambitions fired up, I just can't stop. Been singing broke too long, time for a new song. Rest in peace to 2strong(?), cos reddaman is still new born. The world's been warned. You get tooken out like a pawn in this game. Or get caught flashin' and flossin' at fame. But, trials and tribulations force me, to claim what's mine. Plus blow mine, (mine!) meaning!. What I work and struggle hard for. To the end of my existence, yes I'll die for. The rules and regulations, all God's laws. Laying it down, under the ground. Until the surface hardcore. Pushin' to become a rich man once poor. Tell you to your face, you ain't ready for the war. (rock rock rock rock)"

where it goez wrong,"[Tek]. Dear Lord can you hear me?. Do I want them to respect or fear me. Nightmares got me sleepin' with the little shotty. Though I know I can't put the barrel to everybody. Pray for me now, what makes a soldier?. I know it's no breaths til beef is over. Keep your guns warm, my heart goes out to you Seth. And my cousin baby just died from crib death. Stay with me, just hit me on the celly cell. I know sufferin' and pain really well. If it don't kill you, it makes you strong. I think of the song, ""what's going on"". When it's going wrong. [Buckshot]. When I act like it's love, and I know it ain't. If it was up to you, y'all niggaz would be throwin' paint. On my outfit, like he ain't about shit. Before you talk about shit, take your mitts of my mini fountain. See I had geeks, and all y'all really had was feet. And you ain't never had a beef, so why you had to speak. Fasten your seat, and I'ma take ya on a mission, nigga. I teach my own how to keep my own, listen nigga. Get the check, pay ya dues, or pay ya respect. Or pay attention, cuz I already paid the rest, to just. Focus on the god, as the God speak. Never waste a line like I'm sniffin' on the hard street. And as far as we go, you know how the squad see it. If it's love it's love, if it's not, so be it.... [Tek]. I put my love for boxing, into everything. I know the ropes how to read the scale and work the ring. I'm military in the mind, hood in the streets. Good nigga in the hearts, nothing bout me weak. I open shop, rent the blocks, and call the shots. You get popped, get knocked, co-operate with cops. I get live, survive at one sixty five. You nothin' like the god, I'm out raw til I die. Smile for me, kiss ya little child for me. I know the story, going to bed, feeling hungry. Wakin' up dirty, all eyes on me. Blinded thug angel til my god call me. [Buckshot]. I brought you up, from the ground up. Now you wanna run and say my sound suck. Tellin' niggaz Duck Down butt. But ain't no buts when I come around. All you hear is the crowd yell ""Buck"". Get it right, or get it wrong. What's my name, Buckshot, what ya name. Not in this song, heh, sorry no props today. Hard on the stretch, fiends won no rocks today. Shame, could of been in the game, but now what. You shine for an hour, nobody dug ya style, butt. The niggaz that be geesin' you up. Hopin' you hand them a piece of the cut. Jesus, it sucks, your reason, is what. You don't got one, big deal, you got guns. I got guns, be for real, we can get it on. Right now, but stack up, your money short. And I'm long right now, I told you"

But I'm a get paid from the 90's. Quick to play you Little Rascals out like Stymie. Kicking flavor, with my life saver techniques. Guaranteed to move feets and I go on for weeks. Maybe years if my peers give me ears to fill. Lick off a shot and act ill, parlay and chill. See I paid my dues, now you can't tell me nothing. This is dedicated to the ones who kept fronting. The ones who tried to diss and play high? Oh no. Just cause you had low, see now I got dough. And I'm paid out my rectum, meaing my backbone. Grab the mic, flip a mad script to your dome. Suckers, I kick 'em like tae kwon do. Yes and low, from head to toe to let you know. Who got the props? *bo!*. Who got the props? *bo!*. 5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot! *bo!* (Repeat 4x). I'm the rugged operator like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Buckshot quick to play your nigga like Sega. Smooth trigger-happy snappy, keep my hair nappy. When I swing an ep girls call me ""big pappy"". I used to play a game called ""Ring Around the Rosey"". But now I play the mic, that's why the whole world knows me. I'm sort of like a Chevy heavy when I bumrush. You'd better bring your whole damn crew or get your head crushed, sucker. Cause I'm a set it off with one shot. One trigger, one nigga ??? heads drop. Don't even try to play me out cause static. Buckshot Shorty, he sounds like an automatic. Rip the set, my friend's mad tight. Cause I rocks the mic and keeps the crowd hype. Straight from Bumrush, I crush and cause chaos yo, and I'm a let you know. Who got the props? *bo!*. Who got the props? *bo!*. 5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot! *bo!* (Repeat 4x). One, two, melody shows. And before I flip a script you know I must keep you dozing. Into the stage of the Buckshot Shorty. Son pass the boom, keep the top on the 40. Never ever ever get played, KILL THAT. Bust a mad cap in your back cause I'm all that. Straight from Crooklyn, better known as Brooklyn. Elude the hook and, your whole beat's tookin'. Must take charge, bomb guard, I'm the man. Bust my plan, it feeds back on my fam. Once I cruise, pay dues, I never lose. When I break on fools, wake up, you don't snooze. Bust a move, I get smooth like Roadie. Kick it like the Four Horsemen, yeah you know me. Booming like a speaker with my 100 dollar sneakers. Baggy black jeans, knapsack, and my beeper. keep a fresh cut, never see me with a busted fro. And I'm a let you know.... Who got the props? *bo!*. Who got the props? *bo!*. 5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot! *bo!* (Repeat)"

Shit, I concure you niggaz birds. Pigeon ass niggaz plus ya vision's blurred. Word, but you see me when you see me. Trust me real clear my gun you will hear. Listen I don't play games at all.

Cus niggaz trying to live it up. Ain't got give it up. Knowing we don't give a fuck that's real yo it up. See me out in the streets ya niggaz throw it up. Drive by slow in your hood, y'all bitches know it up. If I don't fuck with cha, it's not 'cus I'm blowing up. It's 'cus a nigga did a whole lot of growing up. When it was Nervous, y'all were serviced. And y'all don't purchase so y'all worthless. But overseas and on both coasts. You notice two of the dopest vocalists. So focus, Boot Camp Clik is here. And niggaz ain't goin nowhere, goin nowhere. [Chorus]"
