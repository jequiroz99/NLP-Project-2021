Saturday, Sunday I just can't stay away. [VERSE 2:]. I just can't spend a day without him, sometimes my girls trip about it. But I don't care what they have to say. See, he don't have to buy me roses. He loves me and knows how to show it. He turns me on in every way. Day by day it seems to be that for him I get weak. I just can't let him go. And it's not that hard to see that. Seven days a week. We just can't get enough. And that's why. [CHORUS]. It's so hard for everyone to see I love him and he loves me. Seven days a week. I'm so down for him and. He's so down for me and. That's how we're gonna be. (On Sunday - Monday - Tuesday - Wednesday - Thurdsay - Friday - Saturday). It's gonna be; yeah. [REPEAT CHORUS 3x]"

it hurts when,"There you were last night sitting close to her by candlelight. I couldn't let you see my crying eyes but I wanted so bad to runto you. How could you find someone in just so little time. We said we'd be friends maybe one day - give us one more try. I can't understand, it happened so fast. Six months have passed. Now suddenly you've gotten over me. It hurts when I thought I had gotten over you. It hurts when together forever won't come true. It hurts when one broken heart is how it ends. 'cause it hurts to know that you are in love again. I'm trying so hard not to care but you're happy now and it's notfair. Just when I thought that I was getting strong I see you with her- I was wrong. Now I can pretend that losing you didn't mean a thing. And I can deny that this whole thing's not happening. To hold it inside-it's killing me, it's hurting me. If you couldonly see. It hurts when I thought I had gotten over you. It hurts when together forever won't come true. It hurts when one broken heart is how it ends. 'cause it hurts to know that you are in love again. La-la-la-la..Ohh. It hurts when ooooohhhhhhh. It hurts when I see you, I see you with her. It hurts when my broken heart is how it ends. 'cause it hurts to know that you are in love again"

I remember when (when when when). Let me turn back time on Big Ben. Let me tell you about the story from start to end. Release the ink from my Ballpoint pen, when it touches the page. It reveals the message that I send. Are you listening?. Let me tell you about my first and only christening. My eyes all glistening. With the innocence of a blank page. Life is like a blank page. Enjoy the beef, the strife, the rage,. Wait... let me turn the page. And continue to verbally burn the page. With fire flows that are capable of burning down the stage. Chorus: Romeo & Christina Milian. Remember when we used to say. Ain't always gonna be this way. From lemonade to alize. Now it's all gravy. Remember when we used to say. Ain't always gonna be this way. From lemonade to alize. Now it's all gravy, baby.... Verse2: Romeo. Back in my school days. Was the cool days. School was the good old days, now. I tend to leave my teachers amazed. They never knew my hard work paves the way. When I talk about back in the days. The hard life. Everything will be all gravy if I play my cards right. That's right. Mother said keep close friends tight. Keep frienemies in the distance, in the night,. Wait... let me turn the page. And continue to verbally burn the page. With fire flows that are capable of burning down the stage. Chorus: Romeo & Christina Milian. Remember when we used to say. Ain't always gonna be this way. From lemonade to alize. Now it's all gravy.

oh daddy,"I used to be daddy's little girl. To us U meant the world. And, oh how we seemed so happy. Thought we had everything. But oh how the seasons changed. When you broke up with us and made a new family. So many. Times I cried. Sleepless nights. Asking why did U go. I still don't know. What happened to the man I used to know. You loved me then left me. Out here with no daddy. No longer a family with daddy. Though we struggled for a while. We still made it through these trials. I don't think back because we're OK, Oh daddy. Day by Day it got so hard. Ma takin any job. And the car just won't drive and nothing to get by. Next thing we in a food line. These things, no you didnt see. Cause you gave up on me. I just kept following my dream. So many. Times I cried. Sleepless nights. Asking why did U go. I still don't know. What happened to the man I used to know. You loved me then left me. Out here with no daddy. No longer a family with daddy. Though we struggled for a while. We still made it through these trials. I don't think back because we're OK, Oh daddy. Now slowly I start to understand. This was just all apart of a plan. Cause without we've been thru so many things. Now to you we are thanking. Every word I say is true. I couldn't forgive but now I do. But we just can't forget I just can't let it happen all over again. You loved me then left me. Out here with no daddy. No longer a family with daddy. Though we struggled for a while. We still made it through these trials. I don't think back because we're OK, Oh daddy. You loved me then left me. Out here with no daddy. No longer a family with daddy. Though we struggled for a while. We still made it through these trials. I don't think back because we're OK, Oh daddy"

If we see the last day and they say we gotta go to war (To War). I’ll be fighting with you, you, you ,you, you. Because it’s us against the world. The world, the world. You know it’s us against the world. The world, the world, ohh. Now if I’m lost at sea 7 days I’m not alone. If I’m holding you, you, you, you, you. And if it all end’s; everybody in the world is gone. I’ll be standing with you, baby. And if it’s the last breath I take. I’ll leave my kiss my with you. If there’s a wall between us, baby. I know I’ll break through. No matter what anyone could say. This is the only place for me. And no one could ever take that away. Nothing could come between us. If the sun shuts down and decided not to shine no more (No more). I would still have you, you, you ,you, you, you, you. If we see the last day and they say we gotta go to war (To War). I’ll be fighting with you, you, you ,you, you. Because it’s us against the world. Nothing’s stronger now than you and I. Cuz your love is all I got. And this ain’t never gon’ stop. No, whoa. There’s no distance here when we’re apart. Come on in from the cold. Lay your head on my shoulder. Ride like a soldier. I’ma stay right here. If the sun shuts down and decided not to shine no more (No more). I would still have you, you, you ,you, you, you, you. If we see the last day and they say we gotta go to war (To War). I’ll be fighting with you, you, you ,you, you. Because it’s us against the world. The world, the world. You know it’s us against the world. The world, the world, ohh (Repeat). ""By Tgifymariah"""

Hold is so tight I can barley breathe. Cause you know I keep it real. Giving you what you can feel. Hook:(2x's). Whatever you want I got it. Whatever you need that's me.

And he's no longer playin. But neither am I. So what Im saying is hop in that deuce seater with I. Cause you know when them boots and the vita she fly. Other dudes act too cheap with the pie. Wont drop a few pennies or cop you a guinea. But I'll cop you as many. Toast to the bottles all empty like pardon the Bravado in me. Us two that's a plan somehow. Get to know each other later let's dance for now. Come on. Breakdown:. Whatever you wan... Im here for you...AAAHHHHH'S. Whatever you need that's me, What ever you want AAAHHH'S. (Hook Out).

it hurts when,"There you were last night sitting close to her by candlelight. I couldn't let you see my crying eyes but I wanted so bad to runto you. How could you find someone in just so little time. We said we'd be friends maybe one day - give us one more try. I can't understand, it happened so fast. Six months have passed. Now suddenly you've gotten over me. It hurts when I thought I had gotten over you. It hurts when together forever won't come true. It hurts when one broken heart is how it ends. 'cause it hurts to know that you are in love again. I'm trying so hard not to care but you're happy now and it's notfair. Just when I thought that I was getting strong I see you with her- I was wrong. Now I can pretend that losing you didn't mean a thing. And I can deny that this whole thing's not happening. To hold it inside-it's killing me, it's hurting me. If you couldonly see. It hurts when I thought I had gotten over you. It hurts when together forever won't come true. It hurts when one broken heart is how it ends. 'cause it hurts to know that you are in love again. La-la-la-la..Ohh. It hurts when ooooohhhhhhh. It hurts when I see you, I see you with her. It hurts when my broken heart is how it ends. 'cause it hurts to know that you are in love again"
it's all gravy,"Romeo Guest Artists: Christina Milian Album: Solid Love Track-. Intro: Romeo & Christina Milian. Remember this.... Romeo, Christina Milian. Verse1: Romeo. I remember when (when when when). Let me turn back time on Big Ben. Let me tell you about the story from start to end. Release the ink from my Ballpoint pen, when it touches the page. It reveals the message that I send. Are you listening?. Let me tell you about my first and only christening. My eyes all glistening. With the innocence of a blank page. Life is like a blank page. Enjoy the beef, the strife, the rage,. Wait... let me turn the page. And continue to verbally burn the page. With fire flows that are capable of burning down the stage. Chorus: Romeo & Christina Milian. Remember when we used to say. Ain't always gonna be this way. From lemonade to alize. Now it's all gravy. Remember when we used to say. Ain't always gonna be this way. From lemonade to alize. Now it's all gravy, baby.... Verse2: Romeo. Back in my school days. Was the cool days. School was the good old days, now. I tend to leave my teachers amazed. They never knew my hard work paves the way. When I talk about back in the days. The hard life. Everything will be all gravy if I play my cards right. That's right. Mother said keep close friends tight. Keep frienemies in the distance, in the night,. Wait... let me turn the page. And continue to verbally burn the page. With fire flows that are capable of burning down the stage. Chorus: Romeo & Christina Milian. Remember when we used to say. Ain't always gonna be this way. From lemonade to alize. Now it's all gravy. Remember when we used to say. Ain't always gonna be this way. From lemonade to alize. Now it's all gravy, baby.... Bridge: Christina Milian. Boy you told me not to worry 'cause it's gonna be all gravy. Boy you told me not to worry 'cause it's gonna be all gravy baby. Boy you told me not to worry 'cause it's gonna be all gravy. Boy you told me not to worry 'cause it's gonna be all gravy baby. Chorus2x: Romeo & Christina Milian. Remember when we used to say. Ain't always gonna be this way. From lemonade to alize. Now it's all gravy. Remember when we used to say. Ain't always gonna be this way. From lemonade to alize. Now it's all gravy, baby.... Remember when we used to say. Ain't always gonna be this way.

oh daddy,"I used to be daddy's little girl. To us U meant the world. And, oh how we seemed so happy. Thought we had everything. But oh how the seasons changed. When you broke up with us and made a new family. So many. Times I cried. Sleepless nights. Asking why did U go. I still don't know. What happened to the man I used to know. You loved me then left me. Out here with no daddy. No longer a family with daddy. Though we struggled for a while. We still made it through these trials. I don't think back because we're OK, Oh daddy. Day by Day it got so hard. Ma takin any job. And the car just won't drive and nothing to get by. Next thing we in a food line. These things, no you didnt see. Cause you gave up on me. I just kept following my dream. So many. Times I cried. Sleepless nights. Asking why did U go. I still don't know. What happened to the man I used to know. You loved me then left me. Out here with no daddy. No longer a family with daddy. Though we struggled for a while. We still made it through these trials. I don't think back because we're OK, Oh daddy. Now slowly I start to understand. This was just all apart of a plan. Cause without we've been thru so many things. Now to you we are thanking. Every word I say is true. I couldn't forgive but now I do. But we just can't forget I just can't let it happen all over again. You loved me then left me. Out here with no daddy. No longer a family with daddy. Though we struggled for a while. We still made it through these trials. I don't think back because we're OK, Oh daddy. You loved me then left me. Out here with no daddy. No longer a family with daddy. Though we struggled for a while. We still made it through these trials. I don't think back because we're OK, Oh daddy"

someday one day,"Day to day and each night I pray that this ends. That there's someone out there that's gonna melt my heart away. And take me to another place.

But I can't hide this hurt inside. [CHORUS:]. But I'll tell you someday I'm gonna find. A guy that's gonna change my life. And I tell you one day just wait and see. True love is waiting out there for me. [VERSE 2:]. I'm like an open book just trying to turn the page. Feels like I'm trapped in a maze trying to find my way. Oh my heart's yearning for someone to call my own. And I don't wanna sing another sad love song again. I get so cold summer feels like the winter. And not a full moon of gloom that just cried?. I wish that I could just lie like I'm happy. But I can't hide this hurt inside. [CHORUS 2x]. Take me away, away. Far away, away. Take me away. So far away, away. [CHORUS]. Someday"

until i get over you,"Woke up today, thinking of you. Another night and i made my way through. So many dreams still left in my mind. But it can never come true. I press rewind and remember when. I close my eyes and I'm with you again. But in the end I can still feel the pain. Everytime I hear your name. Chorus:. The sun won't shine, since you went away. Seems like the rains falling everyday. There's just one heart, where there once was two. That's the way it's gotta be, until I get over you. [You.........]. Walk through the park in the evening end. I heard a voice and I thought you were there. I ran away, but I just can't escape. Memories of you everywhere. They say the time will dry the tears. That true love burns for a thousand years. Give my tomorrows for one yesterday. Just to know that I could have you here. Chorus:. The sun won't shine, since you went away. Seems like the rains falling everyday. There's just one heart, where there once was two. That's the way it's gotta be, until I get over you. [Till I get over you...]. When will this river of tears stop falling. Where can I run so i won't feel alone. I can't walk away when the pain keeps calling. Just gotta take it from here on my own. But it's so hard to let go....... [Oh no no no]. [Oh no no]. Chorus:. The sun won't shine, since you went away. Seems like the rains falling everyday. There's just one heart, where there once was two. That's the way it's gotta be, until I get over you. [You.......].
