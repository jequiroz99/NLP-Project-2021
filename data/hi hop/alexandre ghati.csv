amazing (feat. joe welch),"Let me say a few things about life. You can have all you want. If you really, really want, you'll get it. Just believe!. Can you imagine all the things that you want?. Only you have the power to make it happen. All your dreams can be true. make your wishes come true. Do you want love?. Do you wanna feel better?. It can be true, just ask, and the universe will give you. Believe! Keep faith!. Allow yourself, and you'll receive. Chorus--- This Is Amazing!. It Is Amazing!. The Way The Things Goes On. The Way Your Life Can Be Depends On You. To get everything you want. Just release yourself. Guide your mind, to reach the sky. The secret is just believe. Don't stop, anyway, don't stop anyway!. Chorus--- This Is Amazing!. It Is Amazing!. The Way The Things Goes On. The Way Your Life Can Be Depends On You. Your mind has all the tools to change your life. And make the best choice to everything came true. Believe! And remember: - you were born to win!. Trust yourself, trust yourself!. Chorus--- This Is Amazing!. It Is Amazing!. The Way The Things Goes On. The Way Your Life Can Be Depends On You"
