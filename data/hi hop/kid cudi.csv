cudi zone,"Soarin'. Is this allowed?. I sure bet my daddy proud. A little nigga wit a Shaker smile. On top of the dreams is where I'm found. Some figured I was Satan bound. Until I came back with a style I found. Then all of the sudden they fixed they faces. Cause of who I know and trail of places, that I've stepped. How many niggas wanna hate cause I left?. How could you blame me and my plan of attack?. Cause I'm risking my soul attack. Now I'm heard all over the map. Only rule of thumb:. It don't really matter just where you from. All that really matter is where you're gon’ go. Maybe upstate for some. But you can't rule out these claps for gun (?). Second chances given out for some. All you gotta do is take advantage. So maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage. Been pimpin’ you should think about marriage. Until then get it then. Find yourself and let's begin. Im’a tell you how in a minute,. Im’a show you how I be livin'. From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid,. Now I'm zone and see things so vivid. Hide my soul? Nah homie, not even. Im'a zone out till I lose feeling. Remember,. Im'a be gone way past November. Even stay up there, up there. Floatin’ floatin' hopin'. I could find peace somewhere. In my, mind sounds like oooooooh.... When I'm gone it feels like ooooooh.... When I zone,. I'm feeling alright. I'm feeling alright. I'm feeling alright. When I zone,. I'm feeling alright. I'm feeling alright. I forget about it all.. Ballin'. Is this allowed?. Without feelin' like Shallow Hal. Comma's (?) on the Jesus piece for style. Back in Cleveland city we ride around. Greetin' my niggas wit' dap and pounds. So if I fall I won't hit the ground. These are the things that'll make me smile. Knowin' this blunt might burn a while. I keep myself so lifted. I am accustomed to new heights. I feel perfect though they think it's worthless. See without my flight. Man, everybody wanna be a critic. I have my life and I will live it. Shut your mouth before I fuck it. Ha, my jokes they will love it. If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans. More than likely I am fadin' man. Doin' other shit if everywhere you go niggas ain't just standin' round hatin'. So, my advice is when the lights start flashin'. I'll be zonin' all alone. And then the place where my mind is goin'. Filled with songs that no one's knowin'. And the Devil in a hot pink dress tryin' to ask me for one dance. He think he slick, but my guardians protect me from his wrath. So, in my place no hate shall enter. Livin' high up there, up there. Copin' copin' floatin'. I will find peace somewhere. In my, mind sounds like oooooooh.... When I'm gone it feels like oooooooh.... When I zone,. I'm feeling alright. I'm feeling alright. I'm feeling alright. When I zone,. I'm feeling alright. I'm feeling alright. I forget about it all (all)"

So now I'm thinking that (what's your thought). 2OO stacks what would it bring me back (thinking to flip). Especially now that recessions here (it's hard out here). My only answers to my questions is, is (let me figure out). Ok now here's a thought (1 more thought). Streets is a marriage that you can't divorce.

cudi zone,"Soarin'. Is this allowed?. I sure bet my daddy proud. A little nigga wit a Shaker smile. On top of the dreams is where I'm found. Some figured I was Satan bound. Until I came back with a style I found. Then all of the sudden they fixed they faces. Cause of who I know and trail of places, that I've stepped. How many niggas wanna hate cause I left?. How could you blame me and my plan of attack?. Cause I'm risking my soul attack. Now I'm heard all over the map. Only rule of thumb:. It don't really matter just where you from. All that really matter is where you're gon’ go. Maybe upstate for some. But you can't rule out these claps for gun (?). Second chances given out for some. All you gotta do is take advantage. So maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage. Been pimpin’ you should think about marriage. Until then get it then. Find yourself and let's begin. Im’a tell you how in a minute,. Im’a show you how I be livin'. From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid,. Now I'm zone and see things so vivid. Hide my soul? Nah homie, not even. Im'a zone out till I lose feeling. Remember,. Im'a be gone way past November. Even stay up there, up there. Floatin’ floatin' hopin'. I could find peace somewhere. In my, mind sounds like oooooooh.... When I'm gone it feels like ooooooh.... When I zone,. I'm feeling alright. I'm feeling alright. I'm feeling alright. When I zone,. I'm feeling alright. I'm feeling alright. I forget about it all.. Ballin'. Is this allowed?. Without feelin' like Shallow Hal. Comma's (?) on the Jesus piece for style. Back in Cleveland city we ride around. Greetin' my niggas wit' dap and pounds. So if I fall I won't hit the ground. These are the things that'll make me smile. Knowin' this blunt might burn a while. I keep myself so lifted. I am accustomed to new heights. I feel perfect though they think it's worthless. See without my flight. Man, everybody wanna be a critic. I have my life and I will live it. Shut your mouth before I fuck it. Ha, my jokes they will love it. If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans. More than likely I am fadin' man. Doin' other shit if everywhere you go niggas ain't just standin' round hatin'. So, my advice is when the lights start flashin'. I'll be zonin' all alone. And then the place where my mind is goin'. Filled with songs that no one's knowin'. And the Devil in a hot pink dress tryin' to ask me for one dance. He think he slick, but my guardians protect me from his wrath. So, in my place no hate shall enter. Livin' high up there, up there. Copin' copin' floatin'. I will find peace somewhere. In my, mind sounds like oooooooh.... When I'm gone it feels like oooooooh.... When I zone,. I'm feeling alright. I'm feeling alright. I'm feeling alright. When I zone,. I'm feeling alright. I'm feeling alright. I forget about it all (all)"

do it alone,"These voices - they tell me go.. Why should I ever go?. Man, I'm so comfortable here,. Why should I head to a place where people live in fear?. Stand off is still really here,. Something they can really feel.. But see, I'll never get why the earth is a puzzle that'll never fit.. I'm not of their world.. So why should I leave my sanctuary?. Man, the whole thought of that is scary.. How do I know that their kind will truly hear me out.. Will they understand I'm flying a different route?. Pose as a human being, mother moon tells me that people need my help.. I guess these are the cards she threw out and dealt.. She said I gotta do it alone,. She said I gotta do it alone.. I guess I gotta go.. You gotta do it alone, man,. You gotta do it alone.. You gotta do it alone, man, go on your own.. It's bigger then you, man.. It's bigger then you.. It's bigger then you, man.. She said to pack my bags dawg, and never look back.. This is something that I have to do.. A hero to save the world.. A hero with no girl and no family.. Just sacrifice as a friend and struggle is the enemy.. But weed is the remedy.. And if you get lonely, boy, you can just roll up a dutch and keep your head high.. Wanna see home, look at the sky.. Remember you're not strange, but you're not the same man.. You gotta do it alone, man,. You gotta do it alone.. You gotta do it alone, man, go on your own.. It's bigger then you, man..

Sure enough 1 week later I'm in extra love. Let everybody know she mine so she extra club. Every bouncer every club show her extra love. We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us. All good things gotta come to an end-a. She let it go to her head, no not mine-ria. The height of her shopping was writers blocking me. I couldn't get my sh-t out anyway. I hope she's diarrhia. [Chorus]. I keep on running, keep on running. And nothing works. I can't get away from you. No, I keep on ducking keep on thucking. You're nothing else. I can't stop missing you"

high n lows,I be high when I split a dutch and fill it up. I be high when I get my money doubled up. I be high when a model wanna let me cut. I be high when I'm signing cus my diamonds blush. I be low when a nigga cant get away. I be low when I cant seem to make a way. I be low when I can't even feed myself. I be low when I realize I'm by myself. But I be high when I'm shopping for expensive clothes. I be high when I get what I couldn't before. I be high in the club while I'm poppin bub. I be high when I'm cruising sitting on them dubs. But I be low after shows in my dressing room. I be low when i see that I'm a different dude. I be low on the plane looking at the sky. I be low but my highs keep a nigga tied. [Chorus ]. I be high then I be low. I be low then I be high. Its like a battle knife to a gun fight. But I be cool this the story of my life. I be high then I be low. I be low then I be high. Its like a battle knife to a gun fight. No need to worry this the story of my life. I be low when I gotta get ready for work. I be low cus after bills my pockets be hurt. I be low when I can't take a girl out. I be low cus they can't even figure me out. But I be high when the phony chicks show me love. cus in my mind I read them but I don't give a fuck. I be high when a nigga get attention. I be high when your girl catch feelings. Then I be low when i go into that empty space. I be low when I'm looking at a stressed face. I be low cus my brother's facing hard times. And I be low cus my nigga ryan close behind. Then I'm high when I know the places we can go. I be high when I think what the future holds. I be high when she asks for my room number. I be high but my lows keep a nigga humble. *Chorus*. I was high when the label said that I was dope. I was high in my eyes cus i had hope. I was high when I first had the taste of love. I was high when I left the city I was from. And I was low when I had a recent heartbreak. I was low cus I truly thought I had a mate. I was low when I lost her over sillyness. I was low cus she twisted what my words meant. But I was high when I finally had the chance to see. Everything thats pretty ain't always good for me. I was high when she first said i liked you. Man I must be too high to even write dude. And these things show you growth. Some niggas show a little but I show you the most. Highs n' lows and succeed fo sho. The only thing left to do is say a toast. CUS. *Chorus*

In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to.. Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat.. Not many people stood up against the system we all call life,. But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice.. A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time.. A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest.. This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself,. But his dreams too."

lord of the sad and lonely,"[Kid Cudi]. (Lord of the Sad and Lonely). Won't you tell me who is; the supreme leader. Still underused, like I'm not a human heater. Move and groove, make the bitch linger. Want more than the dick, gold on the ring finger. Not the one to play dumb, see I'm from Cleveland bitch. I'm up in the hills still keep it way triller than most. Wanna relax, someone tell me how that feel. I say that now until I go an pop this pill. I say out loud 'you wanna let me cop a feel? '. Now I don't pray out loud but I know my god heals. Bounce with me If you dont give a fuck simply. Fed up won't let up on the overtime. The more I work, the more they wanna sweat mine. I can feel those lames they love to speak my name. Sometimes dreams of breakin niggas whole faces. And fuck the precinct, ain't scared of catchin' cases. Sky might fall, but I ain't worried at all. Got me some xannies and a couple adderall. Plus these racks we distribute at the mall. With the spirit of god and some Gandalf balls, yahm!. Lord of the sad and lonely. And the ones that feel like shit on the daily. Dont let these phony niggas and hoes. Be the ones that bring you low. Let it be from the fatigue from making a pussy bleed. All of the things I've seen and survived. Make a nigga feel way more than just alive. You know my name you know my face. All hail King Wizard in your motherfucking space. You love it. [Hook]. Yep, yep, yep. Lord of the sad and lonely. Yep, yep, yep. Lord of the sad and lonely. And the ones that feel like shit on the daily. I got you. [Verse 2].

Check with my fresh, if you want I can style you. So unearthly, my profession is to wow you. Nigga how you not better than me? Listen I swear to Jesus. I feel like Baby back in 99. In the SLS stunting and it's all mine. Shitting on these nigga sipping on some Swiss Kriss. I got jewelry that is sitting on ma' slit wrist. My label fucking up my flow, see I'm getting pissed. Work too damn hard here for the shenanigans. Don't hang around bums, and that's how I win, fe fi fo fum. Haters, how do my cum taste?. No more fun, no jokes, no smile. Just a grin that suggest I'm the best. Living like I got a motherfucking pump on my left at all times. So many kids live their life through my rhymes. See I'm in love with you all to the end. When shit was dark for me you were my only friends. On the realer, so smoke some tree for your nigga. Ain't nobody got my bounce, know my juicy ounce. Walk in rooms and fuckboys close their mouth. The Cud life, you know what we about. Lord of the Sad and Lonely"

Try without an igloo. Cold cold world wasn't fit for me at, all. Look at where I stand at. Tall, Cutcha' my kid cudi bisohs. Mute mutha' fucka' back home. Quick pause. Gargle on my mayo. Look at me I bet I'm the one you think the feo. Floatin in my mind. No Sail. Ahoy. Ahoy. Listen Good. I don't need nobody. This is what you feel are the sounds of insanity. Hopin what I hear loops itself to finish me. No I wont be afraid. Hey Hey. [Chorus:]. Oh woh woah woah. Why must it feel so wrong when I try and do right, do right. Oh woah woah woah. Soaring through paradise when I'm closing my eyes. I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo. Why must it feel so right when I know that it,s wrong, it's wrong. When will I ever learn from the words in my songs.

my world,"VERSE 1:. Hello yeah,. Lil homie in the room, in, in the room boy, on the moon. No one to hang out with, talk that shit to. Just my little homies one year younger they ain’t get where I was goin’. Took a turn for the worst when my father left me lonely. Lonely in my room I, I mean me up on the moon. Entertain myself laugh at myself. As I grew to be a teen, I disguised myself. Had the lowest self esteem especially with the girls. Tried every sport just to impress all the girls. Instead of all the ladies cause they talk down. I was too artsy known to be a clown. Now my facebook poppin’ cause I told the same girls I would be the hot shit one day. CHORUS:. This will be my world. I told you so…. VERSE 2:. Big homie made the move made, made the move. Flew off the moon. No one to hang out with talk that shit to, just my Brooklyn niggas. All I would wonder is when will my time come. Had mad jobs and I lost them all of them. Thinkin’ bout my bosses yup, I hated all of them. Studio at night had me hustlin’ most of them. Nigga I was late damn near every day. But Imma be on time when the stars align. When my soul was happy on my ramen diet. Followed by a loosie was the meal of grinders. If you knowin’ the truth all you think about is that thing. Always be a hater tryna shoot down any dream. Until you meet a kid like k dot. Niggas thought I was crazy my momma know I stay hot. We getting’ money. mom. . CHORUS:. This will be my world. I told you so…. VERSE 3:. I was heavy, heavy, heavy on my grizzle. And none of y’all had a clue about me. And none of y’all had a clue about me. And none of y’all really knew about me. I was heavy, heavy, heavy on my grizzle. And none of y’all really cared about me. And none of y’all really cared about me. Now guess what I’m all you see, I’m all you see. CHORUS:. This will be my world. I told you so…"

scott mescudi vs the world feat. cee-lo,"(VERSE 1). Hello!. How is everyone doing?. You are now in a world I am ruling. Take a minute to adjust for the wonderous cluterfuck of fun and enchantment. I promise you some generation next shit. Speak for the silent who are left with. Parallel levels in a dark, dark place. Tricked all you niggas to a dark, dark fate. And guided you all with a smile upon my face. As the sun kisses us on our foreheads gently. Gentle with the drugs. Heavy with the love and my spee ches onst age rock mountains from a club. Money doesn’t move me except on the literal. G4 flights now were off to Australia. I wanna see more of the World. These are more th an just words. These are facts from a winner. (CHORUS). This is a journey into the horizon. You can see past, If IT’S real to you. We can meet on the other side. On the other side. This is a journey into the horizon. You can see past , if IT’S real to you. Then we can meet on the other side. On the other side. (VERSE 2). What up!. How is everyone feelin’?. I hope you understand what YOU’RE hearing. Take a minute to roll up for the wonderous clusterfuck of darkness and evil. I will paint the yin and the yang for ya. And my jeans are Dior for the love of skinny’s. Upgraded. Faded Aided to the T. Work hard makin’ sure I don’t become a memory. Hard to press on when the memories remember me. And they always find the perfect moment. High speed my momentum won’t slow up none. Lost in the wind. I’ve lost all my friends. Maybe we were never meant to be acquainted. Money seems to make everything tainted. Everybody mad cause they stuck where I knew ‘em last. Took what I wanted and I did it all blunted. Oh oh. (CHORUS). This is a journey into the horizon. You can see past , If IT’S real to you. We can meet on the other side. On the other side. This is a journey into the horizon. You can see past , if IT’S re al to you. Then we can meet on the other side. On the other side"

Before I blast and break legs, ride past. And they scream out ""little Johnny is dead! "". You wish me well, I wish you Hell. Eternity, no such thing as time will tell. Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion. Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'. What's the definition of water?. Sherm sticks, sipped a gallon of it when you caught us. Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter. If my son heard it, probably look at you as his father. I'm proud of myself in a bad way. Halfway house, tell 'em to me halfway.

Complete, so in control of who I want to be. Times have changed now. I've changed, a good difference. More champagne now. What I'm seeing, for the world I wouldn't miss it. Go far beyond my hopes to go. Fly, you got places to be, can't let the time speed by. Times have changed now. I'm strong, a good difference. More champagne now. What I'm seeing, for the world I wouldn't miss it"
the mood,"(VERSE 1). Shades over my eyes make the creepers look back at themselves. Sittin stuck. An emotional bliss. The skinny model girls rub coke on the gum. Tap my knee. I’m keepin the rhythm. The young and wild take chances together. They all jump up, twist and groove. But no one talks. Lost in the muthafuckin mood. (CHORUS). No one talks, lost in the mood. No one talks, sweatin it out, lost in the mood. . (VERSE 2). There’s a hunger in the night. The moonlight kissing the nips on a model frame. I kissed her inner thigh. Close my eyes. She began to make me fit. She like to go the mile. All the while I can see her tear a bit. I forgot her name. suttin that sounds like Penelope. Maybe a french twang to it. Her tongue was quick. She was french I knew. A lovely foreigner. Foreign to racism. She like that young nigga vibe. My brown skin, my shagged out fro. I’m king to her. And she will please her friend for me. So funny how the starving are guard less. Naked is always honest. Her hands all over my privates. Lost in the mood. (CHORUS). No one talks, lost in the mood. No one talks, sweatin it out, lost in the mood (REPEAT 2X)"
the prayer,"Talking: Plain Pat what up?. My heart thump not from being nervous. Sometimes I'm thinking God made me special here on purpose. So all the while 'til I'm gone make my words important so. If I slip away, if I die today the last thing you remember won't. Be about some apple bottom jeans with the boots with the fur. Baby how I dream of being free since my birth. Cursed but the demons I confronted would disperse. Have you ever heard of some shit so real. Beyond from the heart, from the soul you can feel. And if I die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take. But please don't cry, just know that I have made these songs for you. And if I die before I wake I pray the lord my soul to take. 'Cuz I'm ready for a funeral. My mind runs I can never catch it even if I got a head start. God please tell me I am feeling so alone way. I don't need to worry 'cuz I know the world'll feel this nigga. Blessing in disguise but I am not hiding who I am open your eyes bro. If I ever met you, I appreciate the love yo. Girls that I dated, it's ok I am not mad yo. Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho, this shit is so I'll. Play it back from the top if you recognize real. And if I die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take. But please don't cry, just know that I have made these songs for you. And if I die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take. 'Cuz I'm ready for a funeral. And if I die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take. So please don't cry, just know that I have made these songs for you. And if I die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul take. 'Cuz I'm ready for a funeral (I'm ready for the funeral, I'm ready for the funeral)"

You got it goin on young lady. [Verse 2: Kid Cudi]. How'd you get so fuckin cool?. Fools probably try to spit at you daily. The price you pay cause you're hot. Has anyone told you that you're fresh as hell. And I dig the way you wear your hair too. It makes you look more mature. See I just wanna be a man. and I think you can be the one to guide me. But who the fuck am I kidding. Man you know they say I'm wild. But real people rarely come around if ever. You got it going on young lady. [Hook] (x4). [Verse 3: Kid Cudi].
