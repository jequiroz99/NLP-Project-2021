It seems like yesterday I was only five. And my mom used to put out my clothes to get shavvin. These days I gotta get dressed myself. But let me go back in time, like Michael J myself. Well, my moms was a fox, she's still a fox. But my sister grew up, she took her spot as the fox. But it still was all good. My dad used to work all the time, he was rarely home. Sing this song. You see, uh I used just to watch cartoons. Back then my homies didn't have war wounds. You fast forward a little, older when I got. A lot of my homies see that they all got shot. But I remember the days, I remember the times. When we used to listen Eric B and Rakim for rhymes. And we used to shoot ball at the park everyday. But now things changed, I'm on my way, see. I'm on my way, see. [Hook:]. Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore. But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again.

Chyeah I remember when we used to have to do math like one plus one equals two?. I remember when I learned my A, B, Cs. And my one, two, threes, it was just so eased. And my dad sat me down. And he taught me about the birds and the bees. Then I used to bring home bees. And then I started bringing home seeds. Even brought home dees and I saw the way. That my mom used to cry when I brought home the dees. So I got up on my GOB. And I used to shine like the sun. And I used to sip on Capris. I used to like the gummy bears. And I used to like the fruit gushes. And I used to get snowballs with rome. But fast forward I used to watch The Flintstones. But it's funny how time go and my homie long gone, but uh. [Hook:]. Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore. But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again. Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore, anymore.

Remember your first kiss. And your first girl that you really made love with?. That was the shit. Remember how you used to need her fit for the dance?. You was running around trying to get something for the homecoming. Then you went to your prom. See that was just your time, that was your time to shine. Now everybody trying to work on their 10 years anniversaries. And half of your homies stay up in the hearse you see. Remember the ""rest in peace"" T-shirts and the second line. Hardy hard a lot of smiles when we was at that Marti Grass. Chicks was trying to get the bees. I remember back in the day. When you ain't had to worry about trying to worry about feeding yourself. Now you feed your seed and you're getting what you need. You can't get what you want. You used to have an allowance, you used to watch TV. Hot day during the summer man back in the days. Plan back in the days, you know. I remember back in the days, let's go. [Hook:]. Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore. But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again.

And go back in the days. I ain't really had to worry bout nothing. Peanut butter & jelly sandwiches. You know, lil debby cakes. Put your lil uniform on girl let's do it, that's it. I'm a 80's baby. It wasn't really that hard to please moms and pops. I love the 90's too. Remember they had too much to worry bout. That's what it used to be like. Girls was uh. Sometime I still wish I was like girls is uh. But love licks, and a nigga really got turned up you know. Mack Maine's a ay. Back in the days, back in back in back in the days. When I was young, I'm not a kid say. Back in the days, see I remember way back in the days. When all my homies they was kids. I wish that we could really be kids again. I wish that we could really be friends again. I miss my homies, I just wish that, I just wish that"

Workin' hard today for a better tomorrow. [Verse 1: Talib Kweli]. Hey! blow the horns on 'em. The sun is out, it's a brand new day and it just dawned on 'em. The smoke in here got 'em floating just like in salt water. And break is fast, we got it cooking just like a short order. Feed the hands ? birds cover the cheetah print. A jungle out there and the jail is the zoo that keep us in. Players in gators is crazy, we feel the need to rock 'em. Furs coming in all different colors like Peter got 'em. Killing yourself for a salary. Look ya line flatter than stomachs of the women that's running,. watching them calories. Hope that we linking, we smoking and drinking casually. Cause life without living ain't nothing but a fallacy. [Hook]. [Verse 2: Lil Wayne]. Say, who's that peekin' in my window?. Is that sunshine? Is that one time?. Let that sun shine through my living room. Hospitality is what I'm giving you. Harsh reality is what I've been through. But I'm not alone, ask her and him too. And they shall tell ya, ain't nothin' better. Than the smell of a new day. And I know the ocean runs dry and the sky gets dark. And ya don't see what He's trying to show ya. And I know the wall may seem tall. But if we help each other I guarantee we get over. And once I'm over, I'll reach back for my brother. And pull him over as well. Keep our heads high and our noses wide open. Hopin' for that new day smell. Love live life. [Hook]. [Verse 3: Mack Maine]. Yea homie, I been away since I was 16. To tell 'em what I'm 'bout to tell 'em. So I need more than a 16. See I'm the only son of Mary and Joe. So I gotta fulfill my purpose 'fore I'm buried, ya know. My momma say she having visions of me being a missionary. And the hood looking at me as a walking visionary. So I sit back and wonder will I ever have my time to shine. And die like Pac in his prime. Or will I go out like Len Bias and Od before the tryouts. No tell a reaper, no buyout. I'm good, I pray for a head to protect ya. And I gotta walk the streets with the heat as my protection. Still gotta watch my back, still watch my front home. Cause I seen a lot of niggas die with they gun on. So with that in mind, I just get higher. And pray to the higher Messiah, I'm no liar. And they say that puffing the fire fucks with your memory. But I got a lot of stuff that I don't wan' remember see. Like when my homie ? died. I like how I never seen a man cry 'til I seen Lance died. Never seen my pops cry 'til I seen my Grams died. And I'm here to tell him that I miss my Grams too. And I wish I could hug her for mothers day too. And I feel the same way that you do. But we gotta still move on so she can just smile down on us. And I don't want the Lord to ever frown down on us. I know that they really got power in a gun. But I also know that they got power in a tongue. So every time I speak, look I try to speak life. Y'all tweaking for broads, I tweak life. They said I was s'posed to die as a fetus. My momma said I ? that Devil in the name of Jesus. So now I'm here just to talk to y'all. Come and stroll with me homie, let me walk wit' y'all. Ten million ways to die so I chose. To get my life right by the end of the road. 'Fore my body in a casket and I'm stiff and froze. 'Fore I'm laying in a morgue with a tag on my toes. I'm here to tell you take heed to the warnings. School shootings, hurricanes, and global warming. Open ya Bibles up with no hesitation. Bc was the Genesis, this is Revelations. So you better pick your destination. Tomorrow ain't promised, better pick your destination. Rest in peace B Spencer, rest in peace ?. Shit could be worse so I'm feeling like Weezy. I wake up in the morning, take a piss, and wash my hands. Take a knee and thank the. Man and leave my life in God's hands, yea!. [Hook]"

groundhog day,[intro/chorus: cee-lo]. It's just the same shit different day. We pretend to work while they pretend to pay. They dreaming all day after day. Every minute every hour that I'm spending awake. Awake. [verse 1: mayday]. New collard green dreams roll it up and blow steam. Clocks ticking pops tripping different day new scheme. No job and rents due and I have is hope saved. And if I fail man oh well atleast I got these ropes made. Suicide suicide someone read that note I left. I'm just trying to stay afloat but I could barely hold my breath. I'm sick of being stinking rich. Why should I think otherwise we just getting over there. For we are hardly sober so I think I need a shot. Throw some green couple gin I will pick this fucking lock. If you don't let my people in. Not a burglar simply trying to get back what you stole from us. Triple ass pop a pill and you think you still cannot roll with us. Fuck you very much of course. Can't wait to show my supervisor when I'm up in source. Oh you can't feel my vibe bitch turn your faders up. They selling dreams wanna buy but I ain't made of thug?. [chorus: cee-lo]. It's just the same shit different day. We pretend to work while they pretend to pay. They dreaming all day after day. Every minute every hour that I'm spending awake. It's just the same shit different day. We pretend to work while they pretend to pay. They dreaming all day after day. Every minute every hour that I'm spending awake. Awake. [verse 2: ghostwridah]. Ok I wake up with this feeling. That it's the same season. And the world is runned out by demons. I got you babe I'm bleeding. And for no reason babys head been spinning out my ceiling. Transpire my pains plotting to murder me. The games frying I'm play calling emergency. This record label things a joke cause I'm broke. This used to be upon coke for the fact you never heard of me. I'm wa-wa-walking down the grocery aisle. Trying my hardest not to work or rock a broken smile. The supervisiors riding on me with some open violet. And getting closer now trying to hold me down. I'm aching and my lazy friend ain't been making ends. This wages make believe but I ain't here to play pretend. I've had enough but you'll never hear me say when. I flew by in and you'll never see this day end. [chorus: cee-lo]. It's just the same shit different day. We pretend to work while they pretend to pay. They dreaming all day after day. Every minute every hour that I'm spending awake. It's just the same shit different day. We pretend to work while they pretend to pay. They dreaming all day after day. Every minute every hour that I'm spending awake. Awake. [verse 3: cee-lo]. Yo same shit different day. Twist it light it up and watch it fade. I don't go [?] I'm just a blair on the stage. Acting outta place and bouncers out the cage. Shake your cheddar and [?] in a maze. Round pays but motherfuckers still insist it's a phase. Even thought their honies know the lyrics to the throwaways. I ain't the type to rain on no parade. So I let them hate that's the type of shit that start up on their face. Pace car brick star in the bar. Down and out gutter rats flicking back cigars. Anyway and everyway even when start. That's why we open books we gonna get a chapter on secret art. It's deja vu all over again called up some friends. This time I flip some beats added some strings. Before the haters come and get me. I hope to carry some suspends. Mabye cee lo on the hook with a beat as catchy as shit. Wait ain't that what we just did?. I swear to god this is groundhog day. It just keeps repeating and repeating and repeating. When will this day end?. I don't know just bring the president. [verse 4: mack maine]. Fieces turd my words are obsurd. I blame it on the hurb when I got the urge to splurge. I just splurge with the nerds. Put my dick up in your ear like fuck what you heard. I'm a motherfucking hip hop rockstar gnarly. Puffing on that marley. Cruising in a harley. Ziggy when I get jiggy. Mobster shotta rasta chopper. Hopta blacka. Come here lil mama. I'll be your big papa. Christopher wallace. Dissing on a pilot. Kicked off a plane I admit it I'm deranged. Mack maine it's so lame. Cypress hill should be my name. Cause I'm insane in membrain. I'm lyrically incorret. Therefore I'm in sex. 1 2 Mic check. Love alcholic. No phone I can't call it. Same shit different shit. Mr. green. [chorus/outro: cee-lo]. It's just the same shit different day. We pretend to work while they pretend to pay. They dreaming all day after day. Every minute every hour that I'm spending awake. Different day. We pretend to work while they pretend to pay. They dreaming all day after day. Every minute every hour that I'm spending awake. Awake

In my city, my city, in my city. They hustle, they grind and they chussle. They struggle, they fight. They muscle they way to the top. No sobbin, no crying. They put they fire in the poest. And flowin they rhymin. They writing, they focused. They know that they glowing, they shining. Sub doping, they open, they loaking, they smokin. They dranking. They hope to be sanging the ball. And that's all that you think?. They ripin off your chain they trippin and creepin. They banging. They throwing up flames, dippin, they flippin, they slangin. They claimin blocks that they don't own and die for em. They taking shots enduring pain so we writing for em. To make em stop for a second cause everyone hurt. If I can give them a record, I'd give them one verse. I try to inspire, they survivin, not living. You can't make a prediction, the future's not written. Although I'm not a physician I try to stop and listen. It's like we got a condition. [Hook:]. People die in, ride by in. People cry in, everyday. In my city, my city, in my city. People die in, ride by in. People cry in, everyday. In my city, my city, in my city. I'm from the city where the babies killin babies. And the babies havin babies. Ain't no ifs, ands and maybes. All the pastors is crazy. The baby mama's lazy. The congregation seem like they suffering from constipation. And since female seem like they on a slow shit. Niggas from my hood holler, we ain't bout that hoe shit. Soon as the beef jump off, mix with they glock up. Then ride around rock windows and hoops and tear your block off. It's where the youngest practice prostitution. And where niggas don't give a fuck about the constitution. They say abe lincoln freed the slaves. But honestly homie we still slaves. And we don't behave. Ever since katrina, my niggas ain't got sense. And they ain't got funs, but they all got guns. What's up america get back in the hood.

Making money in the city I'm from, from grinding. Until they get us tired it's after racism. Our actions is affirmative, come get the affirmation. With our minds we can move mountains like the appalachians. Victims, of circumstance not stopping until the whole block flooded like urkle pants. Niggas will creep up to squeeze on you with the violence. Everyday in they life like mileage. So they go out in the streets smart despite college. The wrong mind frame with the right wallet. You are listening to the heart of the city. I'm part of the greediest place you can visit. Niggas even fill the may up, spray up. Then go somewhere way up till the way up. A bunch of slum dog millionaires, yeah yeah. [Hook:]. People die in, ride by in. People cry in, everyday. In my city, my city, in my city. People die in, ride by in. People cry in, everyday. In my city, my city, in my city"

In fact, I'll always try to stop the confrontation. [Chorus:]. And I'll take everything in this life. I'll join everyone when I die (I'm the sacrificial lamb baby). [Verse 3:]. Me and Him got the same parents' name. You know, Mary and Joseph. How do you know His last name?. Shit, I'm not from Bethlehem. See, I'm from Holly Grove. But I would lend a hand to those that need. Some counseling to make sure they not lost. Plus I could call shots every day, see, I'm a bossy. If this was the old days I'd be born as a king. Landing the major, type that's not endangered. My dad will make sure that I plight and shoot like a ranger. And I have a lot of soldiers, I still got a lot of soldiers. I don't need to pop the doja, I just maintain composure. You know that, you know that. [Chorus:]. That I'll take everything in this life (come on come on...). I'll join everyone and understand (I'm the sacrificial lamb baby chyeah). I don't understand. 'Cause all men die. 'Cause all men die. [Chorus:]. And I'll take everything in this life (where you gon be when the trumpets blow? You know... leggo). I'll join everyone since I'm gonna die (let us not hesitate... revelations). (I'm a die anyway). I'll take everything in this life (I can't take the Bentley with me to heaven). (Can't take none of this money with me to heaven). (I'll I could is leave is leave my soul and leave these songs that you on, I hope ya'll live on). I'll join everyone 'cause all men die. (Like Martin Luther King, Malcolm and all the great ones). (I don't need a halla bit). (We all die, can't escape it)"
