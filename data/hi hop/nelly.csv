Smoke like dynamite the good times. Want both girls like prime time. Want real highs and thick thighs take pride in my stylin. Head bustin you be drivin. Got 'em bangin the walls so hard te neighbors callin. Asking you whats. (Chorus) *begins*. Going on over there. Sounds like you guys are going CRAZY. Going going gone. (Chorus) x2."
splurge,"(Chorus). You see the magazines and. Me on your TV screens and. You think you know me but you really dont (You dont even know). But I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell. You see the money and. The cars and diamonds and you. You think it make me but it really dont (It really really dont). But I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell. I think the time has come, for me to have some fun. I'm bout to peel back the top go on and let in the sun. What the fuck I done done, my mamma's only son. I went from slangin and bangin to yellin number one. I love my fans to death, until my last breath. Thats why when I perform I give until there's nothing left. No competition, my opposition gon' feel the pain. More complications, relationships ain't gon' be the same. Do they want the fame, and all that it can bring. If they attracted to Nelly then who like Cornell Haynes. I'm poppin collars from California to D.C.. I'm in the VIP, Louis bottles and Hennessey. I'm putting mileage on 20 inches and 23's. I'm flippin out my keys, I'm flippin down the screens. I'm bout to spread my wings, tryin to fulfill my dreams. Want anything that I want, if I dont I got the means. (Chorus). You think you know me but you really dont know. Peep I could walk through the club like everything be fo sho. And I'll get, one lil' girl, two lil' girls tryin yo get me to dance,. I'll get, three lil' girls, four lil' girls pullin at my pants, damn. It feels good when errthing is okay. And its a beautiful site when errthing goes your way. And I could park in the mountains and i'll still get valet. Hop out in a Vokal valour and my suede Bally's. I'm feeling good its only right I deserve. To spread the love through all my peeps, its only right that I splurge. And any nigga trippin now I leave him right by the curb. And I dont go to sleep mama so good night and good word. I'm on a mission and its sort a like a mystery. And I aint stopping til' I go down in history. Now who ever said you knows, you dealing with a pimp fo sho. The N-E double L-Y follow now, now here we go. (Chorus). You read the magazines, and heard I made a scene. Believe it or not, I swear I'm just a human being. I'm doing human things, cuz only humans change. They label me a role model cuz I appeal to teens. It really ain't that strange, now that I think about it. I came up in the game, changed everything about it. I'm feelin better then ever without that Lotto shit. I wake up early hit Cuda, like lets go by some shit. You dress the hottest fits, driven the hottest whips. We've got the baddest chicks, we with the whitest kicks. Donating money, the families called and be lying shit. They screaming war, I'm like fuck it, go buy a battleship. And bring it up that Mississipi, if you really wanna come than get me. Tell them niggaz that a, don't tempt me. Cuz I'll squeeze them shits til' empty. Throw shouts at nigga like frisbee. Who the juice? How the hell you gonna pimp me?. You niggaz must be kidding me, make an innocent nigga plead guilty."

You can even wait 'til the mountain comes down. And if you wanna wait 'til the river runs dry. But you'll never find another one. You can search around the whole damn globe. Search from in the North, to the East, Westside. I bet your bottom dime. No matter what you do, you'll never find another one. [Nelly]. Hey yo this chronic got me to', I try to shake it and break it. Thinkin it won't go, I went to see the doctor. X-rays it won't show, I even wrapped myself up in blankets. Just like a cold cause I'm so sick-wid-it. It just happened on a song, I feel it in my eyes. My urrs and in my nose, my fingers and my toes. Translated into flows, man rap gon' need a facelift. I'm just so hungry I can taste it. Imagine me up in the sto', somewhere behind the counter. pushin buttons on the drawer, like doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. Chk-chicka, here you go, please come another day. I waited a lot of winter days and summer nights to rock the mic. City locked down, right before me and the other 'Tics went down. You fuckin right it went down. Fuckin right I drink Crown, fuckin right we move crowds. It's a Derty E-N-T thang, want ya pretty sweet thang. [Chorus]. [Nelly]. I said I like the way you do that right thurr - uh. You just remember why you do that right thurr - uh. I made it tight to be country, they thought country was bummy. Until country start makin money, now they all in Kentucky. Oklahomas and Nashvilles, they givin out record deals. (They eventually had their shot) man they been had skills. But leave it up to Moses, cause he gon' lead us out. I made the world accept on how we speak and how we shout. I started that whassup dirty, that dirty how ya doin. I let the dirty go up and now niggaz runnin through it. Huh, that's why I did it - mayne, just don't forget it - mayne. The whole world know I killed it but I still get acquited - mayne. I'm a thoroughbred, with some thorough bread. I got a thorough chick waitin with some thorough head. I'ma pro model, I'm fitted for the new era ranks. I should move to Bel-Air the way I +Phillip Banks+. [Chorus]. [Nelly]. I take a pair of black nines and I'm - the man. I said a pair of black nines make 'em - jump man. I push your wig from the back to the - front man. Just cause I'm peaceful don't mistake me for no - punk man. Shit I'ma come clean, I should sleep on the triple beam. I'm too damn dope nigga to hang around fiends. Plus a team, playa, I never play the team. Cause even if I win, we all gettin rings. We all gon' bling whether I rap or sing. Matter of fact, I should hit a note now just for the hell of it.

I'm like Sprint or Motorola - no service, out of your range. You out of your brains, thinkin I'ma shout out your name. You gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame. All that pressure you applyin it's time to ease off. Before I hit you from the blindside takin your sleeves off. As much as we's loss, still hard to please boss. Don't be lyin b****in and cryin - suck it up as a loss. Cause your, a** is wack, your whole label is wack. And matter fact, eh eh-eh eh a-hear that. [Chorus: Nelly].

Or some, Internet access some, website chat line. Mad cause I got mine, don't wind up on the flat line. Ohh if my uncle could see me know. If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now. Straight emulatin my style right to the ""down down"". Can't leave out the score now better wait 'til they calm down. I got little shorties, comin askin, ""Yo where the party?"". Oh lordy - will I continue to act naughty?. Mixing Cris' and Bacardi, got me thinkin fo' sho'. I'm not a man of many words but there's one thing I know - pimp. [Chorus].

chill (feat. st. lunatics),"[Introduction: Nelly]. Yo, what you tell a motherfucker with two black eyes?. Nothing, you did already tell his punk-ass twice. [Verse 1: Ali]. D, E, R, R, T, Y. We all we got, yo, know I want y'all do?. Yo. Ey yo stand at attention, raise your right arm, salute. Roll the carpet out, watch all the Bloods ""woo-woo"". Watch the Crips loke it up, we back, we got our focus up. St. Lunatics, nigga know that, know that. Supreme the team, if we lose you open your minds. Start readin some things, we got it, holla at us, come on. Easy with that ""murder, murder, murder, kill, kill"". We did that back when I was born, real, real. But I still do the knowledge, let me give you the math. I rock a 7-and-a-half on my 7-and-a-half. I be with Moses and Kane and Abel putting in work. I slap a nun, beat the reverend up and spit in his church. My Derrty niggas come through. we turn the heat up in June. We at the party macking. even throw our bitch in the room. Menage-a-trois. Cause we the baddest motherfuckers. that you seen thus far. [Chorus 2x: Ali]. (So) Nigga chill (chill) calm down (calm down). Watch your words (watch your words). don't let your mouth get ahead of you. You really talking wreckless right now (right now). And we know you ain't built for that (nope). [Verse 2: City Spud]. Look, learn, listen, check it. Start your cars up, trick your broads up. Pump your hard up, homie now put your guard up. You throw that one-two but, look how I jab you. No need you run in the derrty, homie I had to. You was doin a lot of talkin, yup, a lot of barkin. But your bite was nothin. guess you might've been fronting. Yo ain't no mic to it, City see right through it. I was born to be the shit like I was Mike Hewitt. Don't, test me though, homie I might do it. Check my track record, the flow that'll go right to it. It was easy for me, I was born to win. You was born to hate me, you should be born again. You with Mike and Kevin, we with Law and them. You cop American cars, we cop foreign 'em. Take a look at us derrty, we put the star in them. No slow stray bullets nigga, we Brett Favre-ing them. [Verse 3: Kyjuan]. You gots to chill, and let your conscience be free. Lil' boy, obviously y'all ain't fuckin with Ky'. You see I stays real high, but I be as low-key. I'm so allergic to the line errybody know me. You know what? (What?) Why shouldn't y'all hate?. Cause y'all so half decent, we Frosted Flakes great. And these ain't came out yet, I know y'all so late. I smoke zips, you pop 8's, damn what a waste. My lady is so happy, yours masturbates. You wash up in a sink, nigga I bathe in a lake. The way y'all copy our style Ascap should make y'all pay. But they don't, so I'ma smoke a joint and get to the point. The muhfuckin point is keep my name out your mouth. Unless you saying how we repped the Lou. since we came out. We've been winners since we came out. yo' mouth keep my name out. You don't wanna see thirty cardinal birds. with their thangs out. [Chorus]. [Verse 4: Murphy Lee]. Murphy Lee God-body (like) take shit from nobody (nope). Nelly bought it for me so that's my Maserati (yup). Y'all know about me, I'm so far from sloppy (dirty). You not a female, nigga, so how can you top me?. My style can't be copied people trust me (trust me). Even though you look like me, your flow musty (musty). That means you stinkins, what you think's extinct. Been gone too long to even dig up the bones. I'm on my new-new, upgrade the kush from the doo-doo. That's a big step, but that's how niggas from the Lou do. Last rap was too cool, but this one is too damn hot. You wack rappers think you hot when you not. (this is why I'm hot). All this I talk slick shit as if you really did shit. Thinking you deserve my spot, well thurr it is then. Gave niggas time. but now I'm back with a few of my friends. Lunatics about to do this again, ohh. [Chorus]. [Verse 5: Nelly]. Uh, tell you something. You should see their faces when I walk in the facility. Mean mug, what's the purpose of you ice-grillin me?. You're killin me but really B, you ain't on my radar. Always used the right amount of strokes. that's why I stayed par. I ain't no killer lil' silly nigga but they are. You got the same ride as me but that's just my day car. My decor, might be Levi's and a A-R. 15 G's in my pocket just to play cards. So meet me in the casino, way in the back. Me and her fleein the scene, away in the 'llac. She say she feelin her bean, a green double stack. She say she like it obscene, I'm way into that. In fact, you niggas ain't like me, you salty (nah). Me, I'm like pepper cause I spice shit up. The Flavor Flav of the game cause I hype shit up. Might call my hundred watt niggas in to light shit up. You better chill. [Chorus]"

I hear dem boyz come'n(repeat 4x's). [Verse 1: Nelly]. Who am I you ask me you know it's bout that grammar. From any state it don't matter, from here to Montana. From whit girls name Anna, to old ladies name Nanna. They hold'n up they banners, and run'n wit they cameras. Can I get a flick you damn right miss. (Can I take a hit) here boo like this. Chronic sticky like gum, I guess that's how it comes. Don't worry bout my funds, I play around it in one (Like ohh). When you seen that hummer, but that was last summer. this year I'm more blunter. More up close and personal, it's just gon get worser now. From Prada to Vokal, the Tics are too versatile. Can't worry bout certain sounds, that come out these haters mouths. I realize they can't help it, just stay where you bow'n down. Some more you can't get these pounds, unless you gon smoke it now. If not I suggest you pack yo shit up and head out of town. [Hook]. [Verse 2: Murphy Lee]. They be like hold up, hold up, hold up I know that aint them man. Murp jersey on backwards wit ol' school Tim's and. Kyjuan got on so many colors just like a pimp. Nelly chain so long got him walk'n wit a limp. Ali is throw'n money in the front row. And er' body scream'n Slo Down but where the hell is slo of course. We be them up, close, live, and in person. Might look like the type that be rob'n them purses. But I aint I'm the yung dude I be rhyme'n them verses. Worked hard since '93 that's how I got signed to Universal. Now the girlies take they thongs off. And it be crazy in the club when that Lunatic song go off. I be that pull up right beside you beat'n bad type of Tic. I'm a hold up traffic to touch her ass type of Tic. Lunatic, that's what I am that's what I said I am. I'm try'n to be a millionaire I bet I am, I bet I am. [Verse 3: Kyjuan]. It's dem boyz on dem porches in Air Forces read'n Sources. My choice is ol' school's over dem Rolls Royce's. Of course this Tic shit live like EA Sports is. Dribble in the club I lay up wit two draft choices. Hit the center touch the point guard, she hit the joint hard. Ohh wee oh Lord, she don't want no more. Cutlass is four door, stash for the 4.4. Smokes 1 44, what dem o's go for (Like oh). 350 1 more, 350 stick'n the floor brand new bizare. smashes, g 's and c's all in my glasses. Tics fantastic we get booked more than matches. Imagine, me without those two headbands. Them Vokal t-shirts with some 8 class pants. Feel'n dapper like Dan yes fresh like Mannie. Cutlass candies sit down you know you can't stand me. [Hook]. [Verse 4: Ali]. Andy freeze all his fees, locks, stripy stocks, rocks in the watch. Big shorts, headband to a cross-jersey back Ross. That's that Mid-West talk, I think yo future boss Batter Up. Naw cough, and let you know Caprice Classic on these hoes. Ver big shows tell her best be on they toes. 5 country grammar boys in bandana platinum no gold like (Oh). That's what they say when I pull up on d's in that old Dr.J. Hold a v a, fat laces this world is rat races. Head'n back places but it still seem racist. Got locations so I haul off the wall off if you could fall off. Got a room at the Wada wit a saw that 'll take the wall off. Hit the mall off wit a sag hockey jersey du-rag. Fitted still switch'n two different shoes starchy wit tags."

fugitive,"I ran like a rebel, in '85. Cops tried to catch me, cause all of 'em said I. Beat up these other men who were bigger than me. Was it because I was black and they were W-H-I-T-E. Here I was walking down the block. I seen these two big bikers standing by the biker's shop. They seen it was me so to make theyself feel bigger. One got bad bold, pointed and called me a ""nigger"". I suck my finger up, I said ""His mother"" and kept stepping. His friend told his other friend ""Hey Cauky let's get him"". I looked to my back, to my suprise, one had a chain. In his hand and the devil in his eye. I said ""I'm in trouble, let me think real quick"". I looked down at the ground and got this big fat brick. With no time to waste I put the brick in my hand. And then the biker took the chain fell out of his hand. Then his friend Crotty said ""Cauky are you alright?"". But what he didn't know was he was in for a fight. The right his his jaw, he fell on the floor. The kid I hit with the brick before said ""Don't hit him anymore"". I put my brick down, left him on the ground. Everything was cool til the cops came around. They said ""You're under arrest for assault 2 and 3"". I laughed at the copper and said ""Explain this to me"". He said ""You hit the man with a brick and punched another in the jaw. And left the scene like nothing happened and then they called the law"". I laughed in his face, I said ""This don't make sense"". It was two against my black ass, this makes this an offense?. He tried to grab me, so I pushed him on the floor. And ran my black ass home and locked the living room door. I did what any black kid would have did. But to the coppers of the county, I'm known as a fugitive. I had to go to school, I couldn't be late. If I miss another day Mrs. Cann said I wouldn't graduate. I didn't go a lot, that didn't mean I didn't care. I had to come to school more often to try again next year. Fuck that, I went to school and I tried. You know to hide from the cops to June of '85. I get my diploma and things would be straight. Find out my graduation cops came and tried to put me on the gate. I ran though, with the diploma that I owned. With cops chasing me all the way til I got home. I got away gain, why, you know what I did?. I ran my black ass home and to them I'm still a fugitive. Two years went by, me running from the cops. My mom looked at my dad, my dad said ""Son, this has gotta stop"". Dad gave me money, he said, ""Son, this is for ya"". I went to Garden City to go get me a lawyer. I went to jail, Monday I was in jail through Friday. When you're black and you're in trouble man does your lawyer get paid. Then my moms told the judge ""My son's a good child"". Then he laughed at my mother and said ""Then take us to trial"". I told my mom and dad I felt within. If we took Suffux County to court or trial, I know I wouldn't win. So without a doubt, like any black kid in Suffux county. K-S-O-L-O had to cop out. To sixteen months in Riverhead. Instead of fighting and wilding, I wrote my records instead. Comisarry was ???, inmates owed me. CO's would beat me up on shakedowns, but now those suckers know me. And I laugh at those cops who arrest me for what I did. Cause I'm hooked and no longer am I a fugitive"

Sixty on the bezel, a hundred on the rings. Sitting pretty baby with a Cash Money bling. 12 AM I'm on the way to club. After three bottles I'll be ready to fuck. Some niggas even put me on their grocery lists. Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolates. Designer pussy, my shit come in flavors. High-class taste niggas got to spend paper.

Warm, sweatin its hot up in this joint. Vokal tanktop, on at this point. Your with a winner so baby you cant loose. I got secrets cant leave Cancun. So take it off like your home alone.

i wish,"Why don't you call no more, I'm not sure. Thought you were the one for me. The only girl I adore, now you belong to someone else. Yeah, I wish that I just can rewind, take it back in time. A couple years too, when you were just a friend of mine. Around the time I started nodesing that you was fine. The biggest nodes was to nodes why you wasn't mine. I recognize I'm in the stage girl, I admit it. Didn't see just what I had shawty, I was tripping. If I told I'm a mess with, did that make a difference. I would have traded all my success for you in a minute, second. Probably roll your eyes when you get this message. Feeling like the homey when that nigga saying confessions. But this is my confession, I'm nothing girl without you. And if you take me back, I'll make it up in part 2. I wish I never let you go. Never let you go, you should know. I want you to come home, but you ain't got love for me. No love, no love, my baby. But now you belong to someone else. I hate the situation's different but my heart's the same. I hate the fact we gotta play these little stupid games. I hate the fact another nigga fucking my girl. I hate the fact another nigga fucking my girl. You see the past is the past, can we leave it there?. I put it all on the table, you need a chair. And tell your mama I still love her. And let her know I still look out for your brother, for you. And when I think about the things we used to do. Wishing I can rearrange time and start new. Time to start a sequel, we need a part 2. But you say in part 1 I didn't played my part, true. I know that's where I'm wrong,. but don't let a few bad notes in a great song. And don't let all of these hating ass bitches tell you wrong. I'm a keep holding on till my life gone. I wish I never let you go. Never let you go, you should know. I want you to come home, but you ain't got love for me. No love, no love, my baby. But now you belong to someone else. Never let you go."
"i'm number 1 (feat. baby, dj khaled)","Uh uh uh. I just gotta bring it to they attention dirty. That's all. You better watch who you talking bout. Runnin your mouth. Like you know me. You gonn fuck around and check. Why they surely. They call me ""show me"". Why one-on-one you can't hold me. If your last name was Haynes. Only way you wear me out. Is stretch my name on your pen. No resident of France. But you swear I'm from Paris. 106 Karats. Told em ""Naw that's pure rich"". Trying to compurr (compare) this. My chain to your chain. I'm like sprint and Motorola. No service, out of your range. Your out of your brains. Thinking I'ma shout out your name. You gotta come up with better ways. Than that. To catch your fame. Only pressure you applying. Is time to ease off. Before I hit you from the blind side. Taking your sleeves off. As much as we's lost. Still hard to please boss. Don't be lying. And crying. Sucking the bezel loss. Cause your. Ass is wack. Your whole. Lable is wack. And matter fact. Eh eh eh eh eh hear that. [Chorus]. I-Am-number one. No matter if you like it. Ready take this sit down and write it. I-Am-number one. Hey hey hey hey hey hey. Now let me ask you man. What does it take to be number one?. Two is not a winner. And 3 nobody remembers (hey). What does it take to be number one?. Hey hey hey hey. Do you like it when I shake it for ya?. Daddy? Move it all around?. Let you get a peep before it touches the ground?. [Nelly]. Hell yeah. Ma I'm in a girl that's willing to learn. Willing to get in the driver's seat. Willing to turn. And not concerned about that. He say, she say, did he say, what I think he said?. Squash that. He probably got that off E-bay. Or some Internet access. Some website chat line. Mad cause I got mine. Ooh don't wind up on the flatline. Oh if my uncle could see me know. If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now. Straight emulating my style. Right to the ""down down"". Can he bout to score now. Better wait till they calm down. I got hella shorty's. Coming askin me ""Yo where the party? "". Oh lordy till I continue to act naughty. Mixing cris at the party. Got me banging fo sho. I'm not a man of many words. But there's one thing I know. Pimp. [Chorus]. Hey yo I'm tired of people judging what's real Hip-Hop. Half the time you be them niggas who's fuckin album flop. (You know) Boat done sank and it aint left the dock. (Cmon!) Mad cause I'm hot. (He just) Mad cause he not. You aint gotta gimme my props. Just gimme the yachts. Gimme my rocks. Keep my fans coming in flocks. Till you top the Superbowl. Keep your mouth on lock. Shh I'm awake ha ha. I'm cocky on the mic. But I'm humble in real life. Taking nothing for granted. Blessing errthing on my life. Trying to see a new light. At the top of the roof. Baby ain't not single. But I speak the truth. I heat the booth. Nelly acting so uncouth. Top down shirt off. In the coupe. Spreadin the loot. With my. Family and friends. And my. Closest to kin. And I. Do it again. If it means I'ma win. Dirty I am. [Chorus - repeat until fade]"
icey,"(Nelly). I got a whole heard of cows ta die for my 6'. Hockey players pagin' me to practice on my wrist. 20 inch chocko treads so my whip don't slip. Pullin' up bringin' joy like my nigga Baugette. If I go on a rampage then watch my mo' flip. Draw from both hips, emptyin' both clips. Got a whole lotta niggas wanna ride wit' me. Now that a niggas so hot, can strike fire from me. Thinkin' Nelly 'posed to take 'em outta poverty. But when I tell 'em no, they think of robbin' me. Son ain't no stoppin' me, some are home at Iceland. Hang with penguins, like that's my reason (that's my reason). Like Berkley we'll find the part that's freezin'. Last time you seen Nelly, snowin' in June. You ever had a bicoastal orgy happen off in yo' room. But what happen's in Cancun, stay's in Cancun. [Chorus-2x](Nelly). Icey that, icey this. Icey neck, icey wrist. Icey cris, I see miss. Icey 6 tha sea six. Icey fits on five, icey tips. (Keyuan). I live a nice way, I store my jewels in an ice-tray. How you want it, the man or the mice way?. Talk 2 of these karats, call me in tha mornin' have an ice-day. I stay in more leather than Andrew Diceclay. You might say I'm arrogant, just because I ain't sharin' it. If the check ain't seven digits, I'm tearin' it. If the 'Tics can't fit in my whip, then I ain't steerin' it. Bomb that rifle cuz, now a nigga wearin' it. Catch me on my set wit' my iced-out chain. An iced-out rapper wit' my iced-out name. A cold hand shake because of my pinky rang. Iced-out Cordeara's with an iced-out frame. Catch me in an iced-out Range wit' icey dames. Puffin', bling-bling, while she do tha damn thang. I'm spendin' half my changes on clockin' thangs. And I got a icey game like hockey man. (Ali). I gave knowledge to scientists who brains was locked. They didn't know that Iceland was just my jewelry box. And then the South Pole, that's when I used to slang O's. And moved to keys and bought diamonds outta control. My poppa, Snow Man, momma, Eskimo. So many rats that I need pest control. Would cop from Jacob, but I don't know where he at. So 'till I found that cat I guess I'll roll wit' Zach. And puff sacks in the hydraulic-dancin' cars. Gotta a caulus on my hand for poppin' Branson jaws. Bitches be prancin' hard cuz they know we maintain. With enough ice to freeze rain in a woodgrain Range. Dual exaust playa, I keep some soft. It's da gloss-boss, the floss-frost across the Randy Moss. Until we meet again, y'all keep on servin' 'em out. Nicky Sach, AKA, George Durban, what?. [Chorus-2x]. (Murphy Lee). Young dude 'bout to do this like a veteran. Long shorts, tall Timberland's. Flossin' in my icey Vokal, Varsity letterman. Icey headband to hold my baby-dreads in. That's what it is, what 'of that a been. Cuz when I get cold I freeze, when I'm hot, I'm water. On ice at all times, hittin' hockey player's daughters. I'm like Ralph and the Honeymooners (Why I oughta!). Put ice on the S-T-L and my role model for startas. I'm like icey as frozen foods with frost big friends. Who all like 'em thin with icey rear-ends, nine outta ten get hit. Seven outta nine givin' icey head in the icey whip. School boy keep a icey fit for icey mits. Who like icey that and icey this. Smoke a icey spliff gettin' icey licked. By these Pizza Hut delivery chicks who love tips. (City Spud). Aiyyo, I'm icey when you say Lunatics gon' ride. Love when ya call me to make yo C.D. hot. Met this man sayin', ""How you go from bottom to top?"". Juan B behind me when I do T.V. slots. Now I'm at the bar floatin' from the icey jaw. Know who we are when I pull up in tha icey car. I ice the chain cuz niggas got twice the change. I ice the ring and niggas go to sortin' the game. So if I'm hot, I'm hot, if you not, you not. And if I'm clockin' dough, let me tick and tock. And if love ready to rock, yo I'm hot to trot. Courtney B. ready to rock, I'm hot to trot. Yellow Mack ready to rock, I'm hot to trot. Cougar Love say I'm hot then I'm buyin' a yacht. And a drop to shock these niggas who jock D's. Think he might shock Eve, like the icey watchee. Put these on six e's, if I want it I get it. I do it for publise so honeys'll love this, ugh."

Stone washed, baggy as hell, double XL, with the sleeve off. On my way to drop a few G's off. Ease off, doin thirty-five, smokin fire, makin a right. I'm doin thirty now, riskin my life. Both clients on my cell phone, typin on my two-way. Rollin a blunt, still drivin, lookin at movies. Young Dude be floatin the city like cab drivers. Professional but still keep it real like Allen Iverson. I'm liver than Jay, Dave and Kathy and Regis. Been on more MTV shows than Butthead and Beavis. Keep a stash with the gas money, fast money, me and Slo Down, huh. We almost had to buy up the town. It's like a movie, oohhweee, doobies in a jacuzzi. Girls do what I say so I just tell 'em to do me. (Chorus). (Keyjuan). Ay, you know where my change comes from, I spits fire. You know what them girls look at dirty, my big tires. My attire forty-two large denim, I sag in 'em. Dress eyes and ride hot rides and Jags in 'em. Let him talk his jazz, what's the tag gon' get 'em?. While I hit him in clutch time, roll up his dutch time. ""No more herb"", no such line, ""uh oh"" is my punch line. I'm hungry like a hobo standin in lunch lines. Crossed the gun line, boss, like Ray and Claud. I know niggas that make they money then pay they broads. I'm from the Lou, kinda new, I'm a make my laws. When I pull up on the show lot, it be, it's like pause. (Ay, where yo' Range at?). It's outside you wanna clean it?. (Ay, where yo' name at?). It's in The Source, you ain't seen it?. (Ay, where yo' change at?). You can't tell dirty, I'm sparklin?. Split it, fill it up, wrap it and spark it. (Chrorus)."

She probably got a man, but I've been wrong befo'. All I know is that she make her knees touch her elbows just to get in a show. I'm startin to think, this how it's supposed to go.

Rollin fo'-do's, sippin Mo' with fo' hoes. I'm a two-triple-0, U-City, gigalo. Duece Duece Bigalow, love a man, Joe Blow. And you should pay me, I'm Super like Nintendo.

I like 'em clumsy mo', just let everything hit the flo'. Not once, not twice, three times, but fo'. Each time, makin her knees touchin her elbows. I said, each time, lookin at me, yellin she want mo'. I'm like, ohh!. (Chorus). (Nelly - talking). Baby girl like to shake a lot, huh, baby girl like to shake a lot.

She said she did what?. Well, hoo, she wrong. Since she know so much,. Ask her what I had on.. True religion, and enjoying ???. Come on, ma, that's every nigger in the party.. But I was at the studio, affecting my hustle.. Up with Ky, Murphy, Mo, just finishing Brass Knuckles.. Now, it all leaves purses, fur coats, fly whips. I didn't ball for 'em, I used to believe any shit.. (Yeah, you is). [Chorus]. She said you tried to fuck her. She's a motherfucking lie. Boy please, no way, whatever, not me, yeah you.

Take it to the grave (8x). 3:24, and I walked in the door. Phone on loud, what it do that fo'?. She said she went down south, all in my Texas. 3:30 in the morning, got that loud-ass message. I ain't even do it though, mama girl lyin'. (Tried to fuck her). I ain't even had time. Ask her where she know me from. Who I be with, what number she dialed. That crazy girl wild. [Chorus].

Fellas, what we gon' do?. Take it to the grave (8x). I really don't know her, I seen her on myspace. Looked at her page, all I seen was my face. Her user name read: ""Kyjuan for life"". With videos and pictures set up so right. The only bad thing is she writes me all night. Saying shit like, ""The 'tics is so tight."". She ends it with ""I love you"", that starts the big fight. Baby, I can't control what she type.. [Chorus]. She said you tried to fuck her. She's a motherfucking lie. Boy please, no way, whatever, not me, yeah you. Man, she just hating. She said you met her last summer. She's a motherfucking lie. Boy please, no way, whatever, not me, yeah you. Girl, you sound crazy. She said y'all exchanging numbers. She's a motherfucking lie. Boy please, no way, whatever, not me, yeah you. Fellas, what we gon' do?. Take it to the grave (8x)"

love you so,"Cardan - talking through chorus). You know I loved you right. I never, I never knew girl, you see. You know the pain right, you can feel my pain right?. Uh, to the gateway, now check it out, yo. (Chorus). Ooh, I loved you so. But why I loved you, I'll never know. Ooh, the pain you put me through. You know you've killed, now I lust for you. (Cardan). Now since I've came in the game, money and fame, I love it. But whoever thought I'd wake up one mornin with no budget. It's Cardi the golden kid with that older shit. I live, learn, learn to live, the older I get. And I remember Thursdays, hungry Thursdays. 'Bout sixteen, seventee, um, Murphy age. But this rap game I love it, it's like I'm married to it. I proposed on Clue?, she said I'd be happy to do it. Gave her a kiss, mmmwwhha, she gave me fifty G's. Silly Cardi I spent it, now Cardi on his knees. Now I'm livin reality, a Biggie Smalls theme. Askin for one more chance to show her what I really mean. She said, you done seen a lotta things baby bro'. Even best friends turned and take out videos. I got with the 'tics, EI, still no deal. 'Til Sugar said ""chill baby, everything is Fo' Reel"". C'mon. (Chorus). (Ali - talking through chorus). Yeah, loved y'all punk ass nigga, showed y'all love. Never know that shit. How the fuck you gon' drop a group, and the got the number one shit on the. radio?. Dumb ass nigga, look at us now, Fo' Reel nigga, Fo' Reel. (Kyjuan). Nineteen-ninety-six! (hurry up, sign right here), let's sign these papers. So we can get these papers and give these hoes the vapors. Double-dumb entertainment dropped ""Gimme What You Got"". Off top, 'tics hot, even sent you a shot (Double-dumb nine sevennnnnnnn!). Didn't want Nelly on it, said his verse didn't fit. Some ol' seperatin shit, ten percent ass bitch. Whole town love us, no one is above us. Treated you, no talent, knowin niggas like brothas. No street team, no promotion. Just woof tickets, raw fuckin, no lotion. One year later you decide to drop an EP. At the same time drop us, that confuse me. So like a bastard child, we on our own. Put out and left alone, y'all wont answer the phone. It took a little time, but we got it ourself. Five million records later, now y'all askin for wealth. (One, two, three, four, five), nigga please. (Chorus). (Murphy Lee - talking during chorus). You know what I'm sayin, life is crazy, you know what I'm sayin. You got choices in life. But bro' when you make 'em, you gotta make 'em and make 'em right. And if you ain't makin 'em right it's just crazy. You ain't got nobody else to blame, nobody but yourself. You know what I'm sayin, mad truth to that. (Murphy Lee). Let me pretend that I'm a lawyer and explain the situation. Facin three-to-one five across state, humiliation. St. Louis set it off, phone calls was long distance. (Ay yo, it's four birdies in Houston), c'mon, send some one to get 'em. Who would do it for a grand?. Eighteen, only thing on our mind was that killer money. From Missouri to the T-E-X, A-S. Two cats strapped it tight, right up under her chest. One-way trip on Southwest but she didn't make it that far. Metal detectors went bizarre, one-way trip to the car. Your honor, she got a baby that'll drive my granny crazy. A long distance lawyer that keep on tellin us ""maybe"". And we all raise her baby, takin curr (care) of her daily. This law shit is crazy, never cease to amaze me. It's different from the eighties, ninety-five to lately. They givin out time like dogs givin out rabies. (Free City). (Chorus)."
lovin me,"A yo ma, how you doin, it's ya son now. And I picked up the mic and put the drugs down. Now I'm tryin to do some things that'll make you proud. Instead of everytime I call it's to bail me out. Oh why I didn't I listen to things you used to tell me. Knowin that everything that you said would never fail me. Like 'they got plans for ya. Ain't nothin I can do when them laws get they hands on ya'. But I ain't listenin, even payin attention. I'm just tryna get mine. Takin advantage, you would get two jobs at the same time. Ungrateful, complainin about Nike and Polo signs. But you always come through, and what do I do. I wreck both ya cars, stole money from ya drawers. Sold dope out ya yard, stayed into with them laws. Tryin to pay you back for all the stress that I caused. And i'll always be there to give you whatever you want. (Chorus). (Don't stop ever lovin me). Uh, uh, I said whatever you need.

Now verse two, yeah that's for you boo. I send ya props 'cause you the only one that stuck through. When I'm upset and stressed you give me back rubs. When I'm depressed you give me head up in the bathtub, E-I!. On ya P's and Q's, on ya Q's and P's. You hear my beeper goin off and you just throw me my keys. Ain't even askin me yo is it coochie or G's. And for that reason now you can ask me for anything. Not a for real smoker but you choke with me. Not too hot about the drinkin but you toast with me. Livin at ya granny house you kept the dope for me. And wouldn't hesitate to go to court for me. Need money, my boo will go and work the avenue. My boo will fuck you up if I ask her to. That's why I do the things I do. And I will always be there to give you whatever you want. (Chorus). (Don't stop ever lovin me). Uh, uh, I said whatever you need. (Don't stop ever lovin me).

Young Big Touch, Pooh and Big Baby. Rio, J.T. and Big Money. Herky Jerk, Wezz and Pea and Cody. J.E., K-Ug and Odie. Toe-Fa, M.J., and Cowlby. And all my soldiers down at Fair Ground on Monday. My Lunatic fam, Keyuan, Murphy Lee. City Spud, T-Love and Baby Lee. Yellow Mack, Slow Down, Courtney B. The rest of my niggas up in the N.Y.C.. And without Trail, Cooter and Coach it just wouldn't be. And I will always be there to give you whatever you want. (Don't stop ever lovin me). I said whatever you need. (Don't stop ever lovin me).

Got 7 niggaz tryin to be me, out here breakin they spine. But they got 7 different levels for they minions to mind. I want you both shorty (oh) go get it crunk shorty (oh). I see your A-T-L stamp and go' head and stomp shorty (oh). I got that shake now, and don't be scared now. Cause we can come from the kitchen up to that bed now. Shit it ain't nuttin to a boss, I heat you like air off. It ain't nuttin, they ain't cuttin, they frontin, that's they loss. Cause the, 'Tics is good, and the van is paid off. And I done got so damn cocky I took that Band-Aid off. [Chorus]. [Nelly]. Uhhhhhhhh, picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture. Third album, same focus, my intent is to get richer. I'm with my dirty Jazze Phizzle, he yieldin that instrumental. Youse a cold-ass nigga on the track (SHO' NUFF!). Man - I'm tired of poppin these bottles, tired of fuckin these models. I'm tired of these menage-a nights - yeah right (PSYCH!). I was built for it, I got hip for it. I even got a little swagger in my limp for it. I done had, sex in the city plus sex in the country. You know - sex in the zoo di-rectly behind the monkeys. Hold up! Don't get me wrong, I'm lookin for Ms. Right. But tonight ain't the time, I'm lookin for right now. It's two-thousand-fo', I'm in a new home. Threw out the Bentley bought a Double R {?}. It's like I'm holdin on to permanent mistletoe, I think you been sittin low. I got a driver dirty, he come when the whistle blow. [Chorus]. [Nelly]. (Na-nana-na) I'm smoother than you know. (Na-nana-na) Cadillac do's and bank rolls. (Na-nana-na) I simply go places you can't go. Ain't see me in no Linc', but you know that derrty in Brougham. I be on my (grind-na-grind-na-grind-na-grind). With my money on my (mind-my-mind-my-mind-my-mind). Plus I'm still in my (prime-my-prime-my-prime-my-prime). And we be smokin that (la-lala-lala-lala). [Chorus]. (Na-nana-na, nana, nana, nana) - [repeat to fade]. (letra enviada por T0Sk0)"

nitty gritty,"Ay-yo, peace god, Shaquan Allah!. Yo peace, this J-Quest the Boogie Man. Yo, peace, god, D-Black. Peace to the gods! Tony D. from the Now Rule mob. Ay-yo, ain't them the gods K.M.D. in matter of fact?. Yeah, K.M.D. - yo, ain't them the brothers Brand Nubians?. Yo, I heard they go by the name of the God Squad, what's up with that?. The Five Percent and the Ansaar together?. That is something totally new indeed, god, true indeed god. [Zev Love X]. Check it out!. Born again, my soul then, blends. K.M.D. and Brand Nubian, friends. X tends to grip palm in cousin calm. In this knowledge of self, so commence to bombin'. As alarmin' as a beep from your beeper. What you needed was a wake-up call to the Sun, you sleeper. You don't wanna get wolfed by the wolf, does ya? [Naaah]. Good guessin' - switch the pitch up. Another session from the infamous God Squad. See, we's all peas in the same pod, god. On and upright, getting downright knit. With rod held up tight, 'cause I'm sick wit'. Nitwit Witnesses knockin' at my door. Preaching the Lord to change your life around. I figure I just saw Jamar the other day uptown. Give him a pound, it's no puzzle, relax. The nit-wits guzzle 85 proof that's Max!. [Grand Puba Maxwell]. God Cipher Divine, as I build on an incline. Quick to help another, 'cause I know I'ma get mine. Build-Powers think they hard, but they killin' they own kind. Emphatically no, divine evil got him in his mind. Now you caught a case you're in the mountains, you're a lifer. With no skins from your girl, that's a He-Cipher-Monkey-Cipher. Or you can use the next plan. Vaseline, a magazine or your lovin' hand. I know you know who got you livin' like this, Black man. So honey, honey, honey, with the real big titties.... ""Let's get right down to the real nitty gritty now!"". Put some clothes on that behind. And maybe brothers wouldn't think skins all the time. You wanna look lustful, but don't want them to lust. Which is crazier than a bag of dust. So weavy weavy weavy is quick to deceive me. So I had to tell Weavy weavy, leave me. [Onyx the Birthstone Kid]. Yeah, I hear you Haji, but yo, I got something for those that are. frontin' out there, god. Now ain't that the pits - another brother's blown to bits. But when the news hits, everybody catch fits. He gets mad, but still at home we sits. Piggin' out on the big pig, spoon to the grits. Talkin' 85 jive, brothers they wanna get live. But some funk while I strive. See I strive, I gotta keep gods steppin' in harmony. The devils try bombin' me, the devils try Tommin' me up. But Now Cipher Way, I gots knowledge of self. I been had it, but it's a bad habit to health. See I build with the Nubians I chill with. I fill with - my Zig-Zag-Zig. I never lived big, I never lived large, I never lived fat. The devil man in this land, he won't allow that. So brother man, I don't wanna bust you. But if you don't know the devil, then how can I trust you?. Know'm sayin'?. [Lord Jamar]. Ay-yo, true indeed Onyx, they don't know the time on the dial. It's like this.... Life's hardships. Stones are placed and one must face trips. Falls and spills and kills and cause mishaps. These are some of his traps. But I got a jewel which needs no gift wrap. So just receive, believe when shown the light. The devil gets left, the Gods gotta get right. To the source of our loss, stop wearing the cross. Do for self, kill that ""Yes, sir, boss!"" and. When you do, from the other you won't beg. Can't you see my brother, yo, the Arma-Legga-Leg. Arm supreme Head. And instead. Of relyin', why don't you start tryin'?. You say try is to fail, I say try is an attempt. 'Cause when you stop tryin' that. Makes victory exempt from your cipher. The life you lead is not hype. The Black man was not born to be a gutter snipe. Or an alley cat - you should be steppin' to the rally fat. Not just with dough, but with the knowledge you know. So, get up and go. Get yourself a book of life instead of living life like a hooker!. Know'm sayin, that's the knowledge of self. And do for self!. Black man gotta move on.... [Subroc]. I see some so dense. Man, from head to toe they're full of lead. I flipped a brick, nah, I build a fort instead. So I talked, chilled, before I flipped!. 'Cause in actuality my man's mentality was stripped. Back to the roots I am, that I am a king. Cream in the coffee? No thanks, plaything. You simple teenage, you thought you got the knack to be Black. State of mind ain't like mine. I got soul that you lack. Each one teach in every town, we like that. The God Squad is like Homey the Clown, we don't play that. Coon, jigaboo, Uncle Toms in the mix. Get a clue, or get the Book of Psalms, 82 and 6. ""All gods, and children of the Most High"". Cave-guys still fry in the Sun, and don't deny. I got a third eyesight vibe that don't lie. I AM that I AM good night, divine evil's the bullseye. Bam! Right between the eyes! So y'all know who's the target right?. [Sadat X]. Yeah, I hear ya Subroc, and I see it like this:. It's a modern type of style, look at what I did. A devil still can't build a pyramid. I dug a - tunnel to Asia. Wrote a speech with a laser. Rush your brain with a [???] strain. A god in god's clothing, and the devil's loathing. Got enemies, but I really don't give a damn. Smacked a man 'cause he tried to serve a plate of ham. Disguised in a patty, my uncle Trevor's knotty dread. [? He got a dude that's Fred, used to be a foot Fed. The city {???] suspension?], and I forgot to mention. That I'm the word buff, yes, enough is enough. Zig-zag-zig, watch the Black man get big and burst. The Black man is first. I drive a black hearse and I bury all the devils. With K.M.D. I can raise up my levels. Bust it!. [everyone]. Yeah! You know what I'm sayin'?. It's time to build, it's time to build.... We gotta raise up the dead.... Word is bond, we gotta reach them - let 'em see the light. You know what I'm saying? True indeed.... 'Cause each one must teach one, that's how we reach one. God Squad - getting down to the Nitty Gritty..."

I'm gettin pissy, with Tissy, Missy and Irene. Real close friends that like to try things. Me and my dirties we like to buy things. Fuck around and give me a license to fly things. Look up in the sky and have a Nelly sighting, like. [Chorus: repeat 2X]. Skurrrrt, oh! (Gon' break it down). Oh Nelly! (Gon' change that game around). And I bet (y'all really gon' hate him now).

Who in? Can't tell, too much tint. But why the radio so loud? Too much spent. Never be a Bush man, too Bill Clint'. Both country boys, and if the head right, E.I.. Head for my residency, lovin my presidency. I do it like you never did see. Shady to them niggaz that's shadin me. Givin back to the ones that gave to me. Bought a Caddy for the man that created me (who?). My daddy, call him Big Nelly (ooh!). Pimp juice flowin through that bloodline cuz. Huh, see what it does? Yeah, you feel the buzz, like. [Chorus]. [Nelly]. One mo' time! N, E, dash L-L-Y. If you didn't like me then, gon' hate me now. Me and Murph' fogged out in the buggy I. With the, suction doors, two bad-ass whores. Holla at Yo, cause I need that custom made. Waves, fresh fade, brand new Band-Aid. Skurrrt, them boys ain't playin around. unless it's in to watch shorty (?) face hopscotch. Never tic-tac-toe, there's too many of those. I need a Rocky Dennis face - uhh, knowhatImean?. Then I'm good to roll; hey, out of control. New motto - never fuck the same hoe!. Tryin to catch Bilt, four 'more to go. From the bed to the flo', jackrabbit too pro. Knock 'em out, wake baby girl to let her know. Yo - you can't even stay here tonight, f'real, I'm sorry. [Chorus]. [Nelly - still talking over Chorus]. Y'know, cuz, my security they gon' be knockin on the door in a minute. and, if you ain't out ma it's, it's it's gon' be violence.

okay,"(Ali). St. Lunatics and we here now, we never give up. Swallowin Cris' 'til we spit up, put your shit up 'cause now. We navigatin, wood grain, hood slang, collaboratin. God over satan, no debatin, so I'm celebratin. This new life, off the block buyin stock. Divin off the dock in Bangkok, I used to slang rock. And it was so hard, but now the wallet sport a gold card. Bitches goin nuts when the rims hit the boulevard. Hustle hard, the whole inside glowin. From the T.V.s, diamonds went from hard to see to 3-d. Double VD, bubble Lex with the CD. Puffin seaweed, I'm free, hit the slope and ski. DC to France, finance is too advanced. Wit' plans to 'cause a trance, money stands yellin ""romance!"". I never stop comin, gunnin, runnin and sunnin. With Cuda spinnin them hun'neds on hun'neds spinnin and blunted. (Chorus - Ali) 2x. I'm like okaaaay, niggas brought they cars out. Thick broads out, all the stars out. We ain't been here two minutes, mami already yellin. ""What a nigga gon' do with it, can we hop in the Infinite?"". (Murphy Lee). Five deep in a Yuko', we struggle by toes, we still ghetto. Float St. Louis, fake insurance, with no petro. Nuts are heavy, Teddy Peddy tell 'em to let go. 'Tics are ready, Kevin Law tell 'em I said so. I let go, sixteen out of sixty-four. And the forty-eight bars left'll have you keekin for mo'. Women be like ""who do y'all think y'all are?"". I'm Mr. pull up in big trucks, I'm far from a star. 'Cause I'm the sun, the reason why the day gon' come. One out of five reasons why they hatin on us. Tracks is like a gas tank, I fill 'em on up. And my shows is robbery style, they givin it up. I'm like a Michael Jackson concert, a milli' and up. And these haters are like a comedy, be buggin me up. They women treat me like cows, they be pullin my stuff. And to get that up outta me more, they be suckin me off. (Chorus). (Kyjuan). Now you know Mo, I stay equipped with a zip. And the soles of my Air Force One's on e'ry trip. And on e'ry whip I choose those D's to roll. (What them niggas 'round the corner gon' start shit for?). When they know, oh, he keep a stash in the Nav'. Pop a half and take out your Ave. on my behalf. My whole staff love to laugh and count the money. On the couch, hands in our pants like Al Bundy. I love smoke ganj&auml;, Monday to Monday. And e'ry other day a nigga fuckin with gun play. It's ok, since all the dogs out. All my broads out, doin they bump they ?? out. And we rollin, Henny holdin and blunt rollin. Money foldin, been in more rings than Hulk Hogan. It's official, Nelly Hummer clean as a whistle. You boys signed to Fo' Reel, you doin your thug thizzle. (Chorus). I'm like okaaaay."

Same elementary, shared the same bus stop. Even as a youngster I knew you was so fly. Even back then I knew you were the one. I watched you grow, I watched your transformation.

Girl I need to know that, I can be your one and only. I need you, to need me. See you were my worst mistake girl, and that's why. It's hard to keep my cool when I see you with him. Cause I really wish that you were right here. Tell me what's it take to win just a - piece of your heart. My only kryptonite is you, that's why anything you say I'll do. So let me stop for a minute, take a second to say. Girl you take my breath away, awayyyy. Girl you take my breath away (awayyyy). You take my breath away, you take my breath away, yeah. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. They say one man's trash is the next man's treasure. Where one finds pain the next might find pleasure. I don't pay attention to them haters, now or never. I don't give a damn who was before me (me). All that matters is you're with me now. All I need to know is that you're down. Man it's somethin special about round-the-way ladies. Ride-or-die baby, girl. (Chorus). (Rap). Yeah, on the real, let me tell you somethin... Uhh, uhh, it's like I die a little every time I see you with this guy. Thinkin to myself, ""Now why the hell she with that guy"". While she ain't by my side, we would be so fly. We would live that life. The life you used to dream is all about rapp-in. Back when I used to pull my BMX up alongside of your Schwinn. See, and here we are again. Funny how fate brought my Phantom up alongside of your Benz. And still. (Chorus). Yeah so, I mean, like I said. You know we been knowin each other for a long time. You seen me go through, I seen you go through. We here now and, I just thought I'd tell you that. So, you got my number, as you got my e-mail. You know everything. So I guess the next message I get from you. will let me know what you think about this right here, aight?. Aight, get home safe."

Used to have quarter thangs but now I got quarter games. Got a quarter of a movie, here come {?} trains. [Verse Four: Missy]. I'm not tryin to be your girlfriend (you dig).

I got repsect but it's lost and that's a fact. Like K - ""Know"" one here even said your name. R - You really feelin guilty bout somethin mayn. S - Sad to see you really just want just. One - more hit please please!. You the first old man who should get a rapper's pension. No we ain't system call this mic invention. Snitchin? Matter fact stay the fuck out the kitchen. Nelly cookin with too many dimensions. Mid west, and we aim about mid chest. Duked on my side, too many in my tribe. Coupe outside who the fuck want a ride?. [Chorus 3]. [Chorus 2]. [Outro - Freeway (to fade)]. All a y'all need to one yo self. Go get the burner nigga clap yo-self!. All a y'all need to one yo self. Go get the burner nigga clap yo-self!. Yeah!

My nigga Kyjuan gon' kick this shit out right here,. we the Lunatics, no doubt. We gon'...., they wildin, they don't know. (Kyjuan). Ay yo. St. Louis is small but we still do it all. We hit the mall, we drink it all, we always gon' smoke it all. Get hit, we shake it off, at the club yellin ""take it off"". My success is takin off, I'm always workin, never takin off. I done that, did that, who her? I dont hit that. Cats be trippin off them rats, I ain't really with that. Makes me wanna sit back, I relax and think back. To when I used to click-clack, makes me angry when I flash back. Mo, you should get back, I mean this, hang with the meanest. Remain the cleanest, always smoke the seedless greenest. You've seen this like reruns, pop-a-lock like reruns. St. Louis where we from, you ain't never heard a weak one. (Ali). You got to stand up and get it together, roll with the punches, whatever. Get in our way, destroy ya, make you wish you had never, ever. Fucked with the real crazy, pyscho sick ??? lady. Sunnin so nut and shady, kid pass me the three-eighty. By my sack, cock and load it, this world I'm a rock and roll it. My business, you shouldn't a told it, to end I'm a forty-four. They switch guns and they go for show it, your pupils is dialating. This rap is so beautiful watch The Source give it higher ratings. The 'tics j-just can't be faded, to nothin that's star related. More than just duplicated, Kenjuana's to celebrated. Got damnit we finally made it, haters they gotta hate it. Bought my house off and finally paid it, often intoxicated. Just call me the Don-dotta, original rider, rider. Your mama just gotta, gotta, take her home and here ""splatter, splatter"". Splatter, splatter, I'm from St. Louuuuuuuiiiiiie. (Chorus - St. Lunatics) 2x. S-T-L is where we stay, in the middle, no coast. Lyrics boastin with flight, what up hoe, I'm just your neighbor, what up. St. Louis' finest, keep a cover like Linus. Stop your ass up like sinus, congest ya 'til you learn your lesson, we blessin. (Murphy Lee). Now you can find Murphy in a Jag, on a commercial. When at home in St. Louis, yo I's a *walkin* like Herschell. I be like (oh, oh, oh). Wit' a pocket full of bus tickets, lookin at booties thinkin I must hit it. (EI!). Why must I live like that, what you expect?. Young dude done paid bills with them advancement checks. Honeys screamin they want more than sex, I'm like ""why me?"". ??? take that Lex to like me. I be the young dude, Mr. drop a top a bubble Benny whipper. (What else nigga?). A weed head slash Henny sipper. No I'm not ballin. I'm tryna' get it how I live and how I live is how I get that shit. I'm like nine-nine-nine-na-nine-nine-na-nine short of a mil ticket!. (Chachi'll take it) and say that Bill did it. But I'm a be real for real and deal wit' it. And get mine in the summertime like Will did. (Nelly). What you thought I was gonna do, bitch and scream, fuck my dreams?. Walk off the team like Rodman?. Move the scene, nigga what you mean, not now playa I'm swabbin. I put four silver dollars up on a white castle out in ??. Get them things out and cock 'em, anything bubble I'm poppin. Anything stumble, I'm droppin, whatever you rollin, I'm toppin. And it's fully loaded, I'm coppin, wheww. No more slang rocks, I rock rocks, you duck cops, I cop drops. You buy cock, I buy stock, touch mine, you are not. I'm Rocafella with *hard knocks*, dome shots 'til I get popped. Used to ball on the blacktop now I balls on hardwood. With enough finance stability to finance a small hood. Call it Nellyville nigga, and guess who the mayor. My whole towns chronic'd out so we ?? ??. I'm playin truth or dare with dime pieces, and they nieces. Showin me there's more than one way that they can eat a Reeses. Can I repeat this, man, you niggas need to see this."

Got fathers grabbin sons ""where the hell have you been boy?"". And yeah they startin young I'm talkin 13 and 10. They started tranin in streets on top of ghetto battles. But they aint hoopin in no gym they hoopin crates in the alleys. Where else can you shoot a jump shot. Slang a rock off all from the same spot?. Got one gang on this half the other gang. on the other half of the same block. Gunplay on Monday. Sundays a fun day. Will it stop one day?. Well I cant call it no way.

When I come down the street dirty why you mad at me?. Is it cause the old school freestyle nigga from A to Z?. Aint seen these, tvâ€™s, I aims to please. They mean the same to me like Biggie to C's. Like Easy to E, Tupac to overseas. And I done seen more Aaliah fans fall cryin to they knees. I tell ya, I aint been livin this life for too long. And I cant count how many times someone has asked me what's wrong. Why my mother was gone. Why my daddy wasnt home. And the same shit they told me I found myself tellin my own. Now its good-bye bad nights. Hello good times. There aint no way I let no nigga step in my shine. Keep tryin (keep tryin). Theres bound ta be somethin G. As long as I'm in S-T-L-U-N-A-T-I-C.

Freaking 'tics man, I'm sick of them, they keep playin that song. They're stupid!. (Chorus - Murphy Lee). I said you don't wanna roll where I could go. Hard times, Hennessy and Optimos. Twenty inches on the car, gotta lock the doors. 'Cause these groupies and these haters are scan-da-lous. (Murhpy Lee). Ay yo, I'm Chachee the Navihater. Fuck shoes, I want the whole fuckin alligator. Murphy rather put the shoes on a Navigator. Size twenties that could kick it like a soccer player. Been a player since Freeze Pops, nigga, Now 'N Laters. I used to be well connected like an operator. I used to rub on some of the teachers and administrators. Woulda' hit it, but yo, I'm not a good cooperator. That's why the, that's why the people wanna get me for pollutin the sky. Factory full a bud got the whole city high. St. Louis peoples can't cooperate without (without). St. Louis po-pos wanna stop me but I doubt (I doubt). (Chorus) 2x. Ay yo, I happen to be, I happen to be the Young Dude. With the hook up like Black and Blue. My milky flow's cowin these hoes, I make moves. True smooth figga, coochie licker, relationshipper. Damn right I'm wit' her twenty/four/five, she gettin thicker. By the daily, as a child they couldn't fade me. Brotha my league's speakin the truth, I'm only eighteen. Do the math, killed a pig, chicken and cow. My third eye's so versatile it make me smile. At myself damnit, I'm in the backfield like Emmit. My life is a movie got damnit, give me a Grammy or a meal ticket. I ain't picky until I get it, we can still kick it. Gimme a minute to handle business, 'cause I'm real wit' it. Soon as I'm finished, yo, we can deal wit' it. Bill wit' it, Lunatic skills to make a mil' wit' it. (Wheewwww), we ain't black, we original. The deal is y'all don't see it's all biblical. (Chorus) 2x. St. Lunatics did it all. From highschool ball to feelin booties in the hall. Skip school, buyin Nikes, twenty deep up in the mall. Me and my dogs, found a road to make it flow. Got money to go, fuck somethin, we want it all. Done worked to hard to see it fall. Seven years to get our name on the wall, Cuda called. That did it all, 'cause we cool now, pockets grab for now. I'm like Jordan in ninety-five, no Bull now. Promotional tours now, funky like sewers now. Six-hundred with duals now, like tractors got pull now. We in a good situation like Phil and Shaq. On our way up the hill like Jill and Jack. (Chorus) 2x."

And that dress should be worn. When there's nothin else up under. Just in case I run into you I can pull up to your bumper. She politely declined when I offered her my number. Then I asked her what's her name,. said she'd rather make me wonder. So I paid and she laughed, carried out her bags outside. And I couldn't get her ass, I tried. As I watch her leave out the store. How one man wanted shorty ass and more, for sure. [Chorus]. [Nelly]. Shorty harder than Cialis. See my hand, got the money countin careless. Couldn't find a bigger star than in Dallas.

Ay yo, Bob, they want Keyjuan, the one who gets the job done. Keep huns screamin ""Keyjuan-na-na"". On the block I Rule like Ja, in the sun like Wa. Me and mine at the mall spendin grands like Puh-ba. See I'm a Ruger shooter, don't make me have to do ya. Boo-ya, you see what Lunatics'll do to ya. Tip-??? pursuer, get 'er in a room and do 'er. First cat out the Lou that you knew that. Wore a lime-green headband, matchin leather pants. Vokal t-shirt with some sparklin wristbands. This man, he keeps it real sweet. With somethin sweeter than sweet, puffin on Swisher Sweets. I'm unique, like a blue cardinal bird without the beak. I'm deep, like bucket seats when the 'tics hit the streets. Pick door number three if your price is right. I'll pull a DJ Quik ""tonite is the night"". (Murphy Lee). Hold on, so I can tell 'em who I is, a young school boy with one kid. I think I'm five-eight, but yo, maybe I'm five-six. With my boots off, I prefer my booties in boots off. You get in my bed, you better take pants, shoes off. Now, and not right now but right now!. And I ain't backin down, she can get up and bounce. The Young Dude, quick to roll up an ounce and head south. Don't even have drive, I can sit on the couch. And wrap somethin, and put on a beat and rap somethin. They call me Mr. get all mad and smack somethin. I'm wild dude, you could probably find me on side two. If not I'm a holla like Ja Rule, get a dollar from my boo. And go and by a juice or somethin. A virgin rapper, I ain't gettin loose for nothin. Money earnin rapper, I ain't got no boots for nothin. So I'm servin rappers, I be cookin when I'm comin. (Chorus) 2x. . . . . . . ."
splurge,"(Chorus). You see the magazines and. Me on your TV screens and. You think you know me but you really dont (You dont even know). But I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell. You see the money and. The cars and diamonds and you. You think it make me but it really dont (It really really dont). But I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell. I think the time has come, for me to have some fun. I'm bout to peel back the top go on and let in the sun. What the fuck I done done, my mamma's only son. I went from slangin and bangin to yellin number one. I love my fans to death, until my last breath. Thats why when I perform I give until there's nothing left. No competition, my opposition gon' feel the pain. More complications, relationships ain't gon' be the same. Do they want the fame, and all that it can bring. If they attracted to Nelly then who like Cornell Haynes. I'm poppin collars from California to D.C.. I'm in the VIP, Louis bottles and Hennessey. I'm putting mileage on 20 inches and 23's. I'm flippin out my keys, I'm flippin down the screens. I'm bout to spread my wings, tryin to fulfill my dreams. Want anything that I want, if I dont I got the means. (Chorus). You think you know me but you really dont know. Peep I could walk through the club like everything be fo sho. And I'll get, one lil' girl, two lil' girls tryin yo get me to dance,. I'll get, three lil' girls, four lil' girls pullin at my pants, damn. It feels good when errthing is okay. And its a beautiful site when errthing goes your way. And I could park in the mountains and i'll still get valet. Hop out in a Vokal valour and my suede Bally's. I'm feeling good its only right I deserve. To spread the love through all my peeps, its only right that I splurge. And any nigga trippin now I leave him right by the curb. And I dont go to sleep mama so good night and good word. I'm on a mission and its sort a like a mystery. And I aint stopping til' I go down in history. Now who ever said you knows, you dealing with a pimp fo sho. The N-E double L-Y follow now, now here we go. (Chorus). You read the magazines, and heard I made a scene. Believe it or not, I swear I'm just a human being. I'm doing human things, cuz only humans change. They label me a role model cuz I appeal to teens. It really ain't that strange, now that I think about it. I came up in the game, changed everything about it. I'm feelin better then ever without that Lotto shit. I wake up early hit Cuda, like lets go by some shit. You dress the hottest fits, driven the hottest whips. We've got the baddest chicks, we with the whitest kicks. Donating money, the families called and be lying shit. They screaming war, I'm like fuck it, go buy a battleship. And bring it up that Mississipi, if you really wanna come than get me. Tell them niggaz that a, don't tempt me. Cuz I'll squeeze them shits til' empty. Throw shouts at nigga like frisbee. Who the juice? How the hell you gonna pimp me?. You niggaz must be kidding me, make an innocent nigga plead guilty."

Just the north south east west coastin us. Chorus repeat until end (with talking)x2."

To rep that Midwest, it's sets and projects. (Keyaun). Now once Keyaun say hit the safe, raise the stakes. 'Tics in fifty states, might as well blaze the cake. I got moves to make, transactions to handshakes. Drugs for papes, now I'm sellin CDs and tapes. Funerals and wakes caused by greed and hate. A snake is still a snake no matter the size or shape. Those that hate, anchored with weights, found in the lake. Come off the chain my main, you tied to the gate. First you caught a case, second you caught the babes. Third, you caught me with your date, that was no mistake. Good things come to those who wait. So if you waitin on them 'Tics, huh, they gon' be late.

Watch me load up the ammo, cock it back slow. In the back door, infrared low. Tell me somethin that I don't already know. Like, which one of these closets contain cash flow. Got three little problems I just thought you should know. Peep, I'm addicted to 'yes' and I'm allergic to 'no'. I'm obsessed with dough, money makin and the hoes. Anything other than satisfaction gon' blow. Heard through the grapevine you lookin for me. Couldn't be, 'cause if it was you would be bookin from me. Shook when ya see Nelly rollin in the GS-3. Hangin out the sunroof like ""bing, bing, bing"". Back the car up, pop the trunk now. Can ya hold ya breath 'cause I'ma flood this town. That ass scream ""nine-second-five right here"". Neighbors on the lawn like ""Nelly, why right here"". (Hook) 1 1/2x."

I can scream I'm the best in the world. Whole world. All my blood, sweat and grind. Was all for this time. Lap after lap, mile after mile. Push up after push up. Everybody count it out. Everybody up, now we back down. All my pain and sweat was for this moment right now. All from different places. well we came with each other. We came together as a team,.

Girl when a good thing, living without you. Thought I'll pay for my wrongs ‘cause I ain't have enough. Told me I'm living, I had to call you bluff. Now I'm calling your phone, but you ain't picking up. I should have gave you love, I should have gave you trust. And now you moved on, and you're forgetting us. I'm singing this sad song, but you don't give a ***. I hope you're happy. I hope you got what you wanted. And since I'm no longer wanting. I guess, I walk away. (Guess I got to walk away, yeah). I really hope he makes you happy. I hope he gives you everything that you wanting. All the things that you wanting. ‘Bout the presence I'm holding I guess I walk away. Guess I got to walk away yeah. There's nothing that hurts more than heart break. No one wants to take that phone. You're thinking about her all day. Nothing else matter at all. And the only thing worse than her living. Is no one it's your fault. And now I'm going through her. I hope you're happy. I hope you got what you wanted. All the things that you wanted. And since I'm no longer wanting. I guess, I walk away.

And if you don't, come on down here where you can see that. Anything you wanna be, best believe I be's that (oh). Where the G's at?. Where the keys at?. Where the 22's on them SUV's at?. Gotta have that from the do'. And gotta get me some mo'. Man you think I'm goin' on a groupie, no. Spot me with a fifth in the velvet room. Crown Royale while J.E. spit this velvet tune. It's over (over). Dough"
who fucks with me,"[Nelly] WOO! Uhh uhh, yeah. [Chorus: Avery Storm] + (Nelly). I ain't even gotta talk no more. All my letters speak for itself. You see my numbers, you can add 'em up. (Now who fucks with me?). I ain't even gotta rap no more (no!). My money works for itself (uhh). I'm runnin interest while I'm sleepin man. (Now who fucks with me?). Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh. (Yeah, now who fucks with me?). Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh-oooooh. (Uhh, uhh, now who fucks with me?). Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh. (Ay, now who fucks with me?). Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (I'm earnin interest as I'm speakin man). (Now who fucks with me?). [Nelly]. I ain't even gon' talk no mo'. When you done with the minors ma come to the pros. See I could put you in all them clothes. Your neck, wrist, ears, hands, all that froze. He could never ever put you in a rose. But anything goes when you dealin with the baller. Stand on my money if I wanna be taller. Smack him with a G, I bet he go and get his lawyer. Cause he really wanna sue me. Take the bitch route, cause he know he cannot do me. Know he can't outdo me in the records or the movies. Man, I don't want your girl, plus I heard she got the cooties. (Ah, ah, ahh...). If you mean what you feel then I mean what I said. (Ah, ah, ahh...). You don't like cheap sex, I laid a mil' on the bed. Spread it all out and we can roll around in it. Hop off in the whip and we can roll around in it. In the back seat and we can go to town in it. Or maybe on the hood, sound profound, did it?. He ain't get the message ma, act like he ain't get it. He ain't catch a hint when you gave him back his rented. Now his lil' condo one less tenant. And I did it - but you know what?. [Chorus]. [Nelly]. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Well who you know with ten mil' on a plaque?. Hit the Superbowl once so they brought me on back. Ride around with my Grammy's on the 'Llac. Better bag up nigga, Nelly bonds are the bag. Me be the rapper, Nicky Bonds be the crack. Think I fell off when they fell from the track. You wanna come to Nellyville I'll draw you the map. Follow that yellow brick road. Follow that rainbow of diamonds down to the gold. Follow shorty as she slide down a pole. He tryna make it rain but it's comin down slow. I hope he got the gloves cause I'm about to make it snow. (Ohh, ohh, ohhh...). Like kids seein Santa when I walked in the club. (Hohh, hohh, hohhh...). But I only brought presents for the girls. Listen, play with me nigga if you wanna, if you feel. Won't kill at will but will kill Bill. Somebody better grab Bill, tell him to chill. Before somebody find him buried in the hills. (Ah, ah, ahh...). I got a reach, try on an order myself and such. (Ah, ah, ahh...). Cause I be feelin myself too much, now listen. [Chorus]. [Nelly]. WOO! Ohh. Uh, uh - now who fucks with me?. Yeah, I ain't even gon' talk no mo'. (I ain't even gon' talk talk talk no mo', talk talk no mo'). I ain't even gon' talk no mo'. (I ain't even gonna talk no mo', talk no mo'). Now who fucks with me?"

you can't win,"* for verification mail this author or janis@betatesters.com. [Puff Daddy]. Ladies and gentleman. (Come on throw your hands in the air like this one time). One-two, this thing on right here. (We ain't gonna stop). Can y'all hear me out there?. (And we want every one in this motherfucker to get out their seat). Ladies and gentleman without further adieu. (It's our time). I'd like to introduce to you, my bitch. [Lil' Kim]. Fuck that, bitches don't deserve to rap. I'm back, and I'm about to murder cats. Trying to take my crown, I ain't letting that go down. I cop the four pound and go the whole twelve rounds, yeah. You broke hoes need to throw in the towel. Life's a wheel of fortune and y'all can't buy a vowel. Who me? That's none of your concern. Like ashes in the urn, more money to burn. Damn my ass is firm, stay away from germs. Pussy flawless, get wetted in worms. If you only knew like Aaliyah. How your man be hawking me and stalking me. When he fucking you he see me. Every crack valve or record he sell I get a piecey. Easy, believe me, my words is credible. Ask Nat Cole huh, I'm unforgettable. Don't let the QB get a hold of your guy. Sex him well, get him high, he might fuck around and die. 1 - [Lil' Kim]. I guess you know by now who's number one. Brooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from. (Number one). So if you got beef better think again. (Number one). Cause you can't win. (You can't win). Repeat 1. Your so called vendetta was light like birds' feathers. Even with an umbrella, you can't stop my hurricane. I moved on to bigger and better things. Y'all still making minimum wage. First on stage, like the ever I graze. Leave you amazed. And keep the fifth by the rib cage. All you jealous ass holes is rebellious ass holes. Still trying to recoup from the first album ass holes. You's a gangster, prove it. Wanna shoot me, do it. That's word than Jerry McGuire. I'll set that ass on fire. That's how you work with barbed wire. Carve my name in your face. Pour gas-o-line on you and drop you at the gas station. Y'all chicks ain't blind, I shine like polyeurotheme. Cocoa butter cré‘e. That's the gleam of drugs baby like codeine. Low self esteem, eh-eh, the flows excellent. Your's is satisfactory return them to the factory. I mean practically, the shit is whack for me. Mama bear, finally out of hibernating. Here to tell you chicks to stop tailgating. Repeat 1 (2x). [Lil' Kim]. It's the B-I-G-M-A-M-A. Often tipsy, cabin in Percipsy. I've been in this shit since Biz hit the, one-two. Nothing left to do. Move it in there, cathedral ceilings. Don't come to my house, it might hurt your feelings. P Diddy introduced me to the business side. Fired me a few mill and a couple of oil spills. That's how we do it, you chicks is no thrill. Doin' it Flinstones style, car with no wheels. Still on tricycles, riding bicycles. Our diamonds be so white they look like icicles. I'm getting sick and tired of hearing all these rough drafts. On the countdown, don't make me laugh. Got my own company, I'm chief of the staff. They say we twins then I'm the better half. I'm nasty worse than Howard Stern. This court is adjourned. And now it's your turn bitch. Repeat 1 (2x). [Puff Daddy]. Can you feel me?. I just wanna know if y'all can feel me. I just wanna know if y'all can feel me out there. It's not a game, we're back. And this time we're not going anywhere. Number one, that's my bitch. Recognize! Ya feel me?."
