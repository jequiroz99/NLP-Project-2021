My shot fierce like Paul Pierce. I barely acknowledge picks. Put your best man on me. Put your whole camp on me. I'll leap over your team like Vincanity. Or Shawn Marion cause I be jumpin. But my game is big. Like T.I.M Duncan. My heart is huge like Iverson's. And if you ever guard me, like Marbury. I'm invitin 'em and slicin 'em. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. I doubt you find anyone as smooth as this. I'm a Vet like Erving. Whether it's Johnson or Julius. The court is where my heart beat. You can't guard me. I'm a beast on the court. Like Lenny B. and Barkley. If I want I can glide like Clyde. Or drain three's in your eyes. Like Byrd from any side. I could, lace up my sneaks. And leap like Dominique. Or I, could give your team flashbacks. Of Pistol Pete point blank. Gettin the win for my team is the job. That's why, on the court. I'm the King like Bernard. All in above the rim like Daryl Dawkins. Or flat our single handedly. Disgracing your team like Jordan. Either way I'm puttin it down. Playa I been had games. Since I've checked. The Mack-a-Do was around. You ain't gotta ask. You know how I'm built. Drop three digits on your team. Alone like Wilt. You know what it is. YEAA!. [Chorus]"

no love 2 b found,"Yo, one time for the money getters. Broke niggas cause me nerves, you're not wanted with us. Bitch boy I got bread, and it ain't shit. To put a couple loafs on your head. No wonder though,. No surgery to undergo, just a couple from the foe. Shoot fast, slump them slow. These motherfuckers really think they stunting though. But they jury game got them looking like brian... whoa. Having hard times, there's no love to be found. Having hard times, in this crazy town. Having hard times, there's no love to be found. Ah, bumping ... in the coop as I take off. Bad red bone with me rolling like a skateboard. And you ain't gotta ask what team I play for. Kill my voice box then 5 letters still say it all. While I'm seeing b, where's the fucking love. Even steven a will tell you it's some fucking stunts. We ball, and all them other niggas fucking scrubs. Crew of the decade hater, what the fuck is .... Having hard times, there's no love to be found. Having hard times, in this crazy town. Having hard times, there's no love to be found. Yo, no reason to ice the audemar. Pure gold, grab a fork, lame nigga, eat your heart out. Black mambas on the range and it's mad black. Brand new yankee fitted fuck a snapback. My low slammer let that choppa start chopping. And shoot your stupid ass back there. When chris cross was popping. Warm it up mills, I'm about to. You got swag, this will clap it out you. Having hard times, there's no love to be found. Having hard times, in this crazy town. Having hard times, there's no love to be found. Say as the world keep spinning. My team keep winning. Having hard times, there's no love to be found. Having hard times, in this crazy town. Having hard times, there's no love to be found."

And if the bouncer be like 'chill', tell em (no no no). Those dudes lame, we ain't the same as them. My crew move, all shots our style like BIGs, Wayne and them. But if them boys catch me slipping, I ain't naming them. They ask for info, I'm like (no no no). My homeboys got bad tempers, and there's no controlling them. So if you say you holding them, you better be unloading them. Cause I'll have your Reverend standing up at your podium. Your momma falling over him like (no no no). Plus recently I been watching a lot of cats. Cause this game got me prepared for all types of acts. I know you cats wanna see me laid flat. That's why when you reach for daps I'm like (no no no).

For my peoples, this for my peoples, MH! (no no no). [Verse]. Yo in school I was a rude boy. Now I move around wit respect of rude bwoys. Murderers and crude boys; So be cool boy. Matter a fact, click clak, don't move boy! (no no no). My mens clap shit that sound like bombs when they blast off. Pussy, you will have your thoughts on your dashboard. Be careful brother you might get just what you asked for. And I ain't talking rap dawg (no no no). Mi pesos short, no time for rhyming wars. You talking bars, I'm talking more like Saddam and George. Stop all the hatred, cause once you see that thang. Only thing you gon say is (no no no). You niggaz basic, I'm nothing to play wit. Aim at your grill, I'm not trying to graze it. So before you think about coming at me. Think about what the track say (no no no). [Background - repeat]. ""Jeah jeah, j-j-jeah jeah jeah jeah jeah!. I'm having a lot of fun man. I see the haters though. I told ya y'all make me work harder man. This for my peoples, this is for my peoples, MH! (no no no). [Verse]. Yo I got a Jamaican broad named Candi. That roll blunts of chocolate bigger than the Marley Family. She even sleep wit a desy, she like Shakira and ""Belly"". So fucking wit her, that's a (no no no). Fam, don't try that punk shit, cause you'll get jumped quick. Dumb clips will get dumped quick where ya lunch went. Screw where ya from prick and who ya run wit.

protect ya neck freestyle,"[Jae Millz:]. I get kited till the haze gone. That's why my lungs look like they could be related to Grace Jones. You better check what the beat is sayin, I'm like a stove on it. The Dark, it ain't hard to see I'm far from a?. Harlem, faggot fuck your past views. You think it's '89 the way niggas still snatch jewels. Plus niggas clap tools. And they'll have lead engraved in your skin like the ink they use for tattoos. Look I ain't one of them rap dudes who act rude. And yack about how much back in the day they gat blew. Nah homie, I don't spit it, I live it. Shit matter fact I do both witout even movin my pivot. I swear I wish I had a camcorder. So you could see how I go in booths and come out with charges of manslaughter. You motherfuckers prolly heard it befo. But just in case you dumb niggas ain't know.... [Papoose:]. I'm a four bar killa, killa reflection in all ya'll mirrors. First Slay gave me breakfast now all ya'll dinner. Cause my shots wasn't for ya'll niggas. But it's enough room in the cemetery for all ya'll niggas. I carry the Mack Milli, I don't play with toy guns. I raise M&M's like the Detroit slums. Thugacation Nation, niggas avoid them. Brooklyn is the place we build and destroy from. Pull out the M-1, leave you and your boys done. Niggas thought I was 97 the way I point one. You can't compares us, you here to fear us, then plan the grammar. I'm the hand in hander, blam the cannons, I'm jamming hammers. Put a knot in back of his head just like a bandana. Niggas always want static, that's why I pack an antenna. From New York, Pap is a monster. I got a hundred guns and fifty clips, half of 'em revolvers. [Canibus:]. Yo I put it to you so raw, you prolly O.D. on the floor. That's what you get for disagreeing with God. The Lebron James Bond, my aim with the arm is so long. That I could tag along, with Socom. I spit to the beat, flip like Swizz did to the beat. At sunrise I spit to the East. Niggas talk shit in the streets. When they bout to get released, they ain't got no lip for the beast. Make you strip like police, I point the heat. From the hip to get leverage if you more than four deep. Got a pistol grip hawk with a chrome beak. Shit is so deep, I check to make sure it's no leaks. Lookin like Jada in the black Jaggari. Half Jag, half Ferrari, the valet saw me. Shorty wanna know how the flesh work, what's under my sweatshirt. That's why I hit the gym till my chest hurt. Next year's summer I'm a kill a conjecture. For now I'm just a hustler tryna give you my best work. [Lord Tariq:]. Lord, pimpin it's truest, I really do this. Still amongst the realest and focused as a Buddhist. Notice how I stroke this, quote it ""I influence"". The youngest to the oldest, I'm Jesus to the Judas (huh). The reason the game done weakened the chain. They speakin my name, they speak it in vain, but they clueless. And when I reach for the thang, they each wanna change. They speech and they claims, But, I'm a do this. Cock and squeeze on who wanna romp with me. Got G's on that (OOWEE), that'll stomp with me. By now you shoulda heard how the Feds wan get me. And how my bread long like the dreads on Ziggy. You're dead wrong silly, I ain't tryna take nine shots. To sell records, that there song's Fifty. I ain't doin time cause I'm good with crime. Sorry, but that's how my crew is designed. Team Saga, we chasin that agua, that's the glory. You could see it on the E True Hollywood Stories. Bout how they hollerin for me, blind how to endure me. But not witout profit, surely you ridin for me (C'mon B). [McGruff:]. Yo the Fif will lift you, so damn high up in the sky. Niggas prolly think you could fly. Niggas like you don't think you could die. Yap nigga's shines, throw drinks in they eyes. Stick-up kids, shoot it out, like Billy The Kid. Shit I rap about is the shit, I really done did. Shit you rap about is the shit you really don't live. You think the streets don't know you oh-so-fake. Lameass cornball namer hold no weight. You's a sucka in the hood bitch, nigga I'm hood rich. Strippin all the good shit, stay in some bullshit. Sprayin the full clip, makin sure every bullet count. Bounce a couple bullets in ya mouth. Know where you rest at, pull up at ya house. Wifey, I bless that, be pullin up her blouse. Holla at ya boy, in ya cranberry exhaust. Beige interior, pedal to the floor. Heavy on the bling, Sean John velour. [Cory Gunz:]. When them shells pop out them twelves, pellets whiz and they twist niggas. He filled mine with blanks, said wassup till we switched blinkers. Thinkin I'm dumb, but he don't know my 9 got a twin sister. Sixteen kids in her, they hungry, they skipped dinner. Squalie on that hollow tip diet, ya gettin thinner. You know the difference now between a wild and a bitch nigga. The type that go to trial the other would rather skip nigga. Hard livin not knowin if your momma exist nigga. Started with the yellow radio on the block spittin. Everybody and they mother heard before Pop listened. I was on that Tupac and with Hova and Nas dissin. Each other, it was hard cause both of them had caught my vision. I'm better than whatever rapper you bring in front of me. It's a lot of Jiggas and Pacs but it's only one of me. Don't nobody want it, that's the reason I'm bored. Cause they buyin they ways into battles they cannot afford. Before I get at a nigga, I go straight to the source. Shit I say make 'em get pen, paper, and a Thesaurus. The Militia, they ain't got shit for us. I'll have a nigga runnin like Forest, through a forest, tryin to shake the Taurus. Like he holdin the torch. But him getting away is equivalent to a turtle outrunning a Porsche. Go straight through a nigga door, with the four four. And the moss, in my jacket, if he chattin, to the force. Then he gon get lost, and we both drivin off. But the catch is, his lips'll be taped to the exhaust. Of a four door Ford, with multiple horsepowers. Ya label gotta be pussy cause they endorse cowards nigga"
run 4 mayor freestyle lyrics (feat. tyga & gudda gudda),"Jae Millz. Young Money...Harlem. Umm...I got one thing to say before I start this verse...LEGGO..haha. Feeling so good that I might run for mayor. So good I might buy a present for a hater. I just wanna slay her,. You just want to savor. Well good come and get her, let me get back to my paper. Straight from harlem with the cellars and the shavers. To a high rise balcony way in the air. Stand on my own, so I don't need no favors. And the watch on my wrist dumber than any one of Flavor's. Cyclops watch the bitch beam lasers. And all my diamonds dancing Jr., Sammy Davis. Oh that's you girl, I make her scream see you later. Take her home and make her sing like Anita Baker. They all under estimated, but I made it. So Im waving from that young money flow while we parading. Yeah we the champs so every days a celebration. Aint nobody do like this in ages. Not only are we young money, bitch we are the greatest. Catch me in some jordans before you catch me in some gators. No I'm not icy bitch I'm definetly a glacier. Certified N.Y. wife taker. Old school game like Walt,Clyde,Frazier. Pockets of money like an open pager. I grew up in an apartment but im a don acre. Tyga. Mass murder every Tyga hater.

Player player shit, city's next to where they names is. Famous amos shit, want the cookies with the rasins. I play stages, no games no sages. Rap raging, move out my fucking way bitch. Are you asian, yup smartest in my age group. I'm fading, and I aint even off nathan. So blatant, and half of these bitches basic. I'm on it, you faling off, Humpty Dumpty, in the yard I'm a fucking dog. Princess shit, write my name on a star. Skinny nigga dough, hoses slurping on my straw. Big boy though. Gudda Gudda. Real fly nigga, bitches see me and they holla. My shades block the sunrays, Dolce and Gabana. Louis breifcase Louis rag I'm stylin. Credit cards in my Louis wallet when I'm going shoppin. This is young money, so the money aint a problem,. Got my daughter with me, if she want it them I'm going to cop it. All my kids, pearl and ryan, they get everything they want and. They just call daddy and I'll have it to them by the morning. I'm a young paid nigga, got it made nigga,. Not bad, I quit school in the 9th grade nigga. Left my Momma house I was still an underaged nigga. I was like, fuck this shit, I gotta get paid nigga. Now it's 20-10 and we the hottest in the game,. It's young money mention money when you say my name,. They call me gudda gudda, double g it's all the same. Heroine flow, cocaine, put it in your vein.... Millzy... we gone kill these niggas in 20-10, you hear me now? on some g shit, you feel me, you hera, slurring right now?"

I do it for the g's never been a fan of suckers. Born and raised in the city that never sleeps. So blame my fuck a pillow mentality on nyc, warrup.

You need to go harder. You ain't getting where you tryina go,. You need to go harder. I'm everything a man bout, rap. With my arms tied behind my back. Cause I ain't looking for no hands out. True under dog so you know I understand doubt. But even with no legs, I still stand out. How do you expect me not to show my ass. I've been dreaming this, since I used to show my bus pass. Had an unlimited metro card for my transportation. Now the coup far, sway interior like decoration. Man these niggas know my reputation, I play dirty. Ball hard like anthony mason. Minus the graffiti on the side of my fay. Just line me up taping my ways. Just enjoy your day, pops wasn't there for me. But mine gonn be okay. Never be a day we wake up, in mind don't see my face. One of these fake niggas sorry, I am not them. My city know I got em, that's why everybody riding, what it is. [hook] x 2. I ain't worry bout nobody if they don't sit at my table. With they plates.

who!,"Browz they gon' hate you after this one. It's one to what? let's go!. [verse 1:]. Who the fuck want a problem with a problem with steam trees. Ironman status press cowards with steam tees. Catch me in the corner to somethin' wit some mean b's. I'm harlem's best kept secret like I'm kareem reed. Comfy on the ave cuz I reps my shit. I got a crew why I need cops to protect my shit. Yeah I know cats haitn' but I'm lovin' it. Thats why I park before deuce troop it out just for the fuck of it. You can't find a nigga in the city thats tougher. I got a 3-year run like ts at the rucker. Don't tell me nothin' 'bout who da next to pop. Cause everybody who's supposed to been hot done flopped. Last year on the mixtapes I heard a lot of greasy rappin'. Now niggaz tryin' to see what happened. Everybody mad but you see I'm laughing. Their careers stuck at the toll I'm e-z passin'. It's harlem to the death of me till ain't nothin left for me. Fuck showin' em how to do it I gave niggaz recipes. And your label knows you garbage. Thats why they got you sittin' on the shelf like you. Was made for a cabbage stupid!. Yeah! I run new york man!(get in touch wit me). [chorus:]. Who (who) wanna be the next to get it. And become the next statistic in da hood and tell me. Who (who) wanna try to get luck. And get left right beside their truck. Nigga lemme know. Who (who) wanna aim at the statue. Let the whole city vote get at'cha. Please tell me. Who (who) wanna call my bluff. Who think they friend can't get touched. Point him out nigga. Who who who who who who who who. [verse 2:]. Back on da scene it's ya motherfuckin' man from da block. In da h where da cake can buck buck they shots. Never solo on da ave always posted with my gang. Mh get it straight ain't a damn thing change. Bang! back up don't make a nigga have to pull the 'lac up. Hop up the front seat and act up. Stomp you all wit some hightops. And jump right back in da esv and re-strap my straps up. Make sure my cuff is right fix my jacker. And pull my fitted back over my brows and light a sack up. You might as well pack up. And your album might've been hot but just hearin'. You fucked all da tracks up. Lotta niggaz gon' get exposed once I do a number. Think about it be scared yeah you should wonder. Just think about when I swipe da throne. And even worse than that just think about when mice come home. Niggaz mad cause they raps is lame. And I flash them chains gettin' better yearly like. Madden games money. I know your life don't go past your lane. I'm passing fully stuffed vanillas you passin' grains. This is nyc at its best. I grew up runnin' my mouth for free now. I breathe for checks and yes!. I ain't losin' not a thing. Fuck a headlock I got the streets in a million-dollar dream. Motherfucker!. Yeah! it's one to what?(harlem). Swat team! (your more welcome man). [chorus]. Swat team man! vado, al, reese!. Free mike song thats da campaign. Its da statue!. Naj 2. They ain't fuckin' with ya boy man. E rolla!"
