goodbye,"(Goodbye, goodbye). I'm speaking from the heart, no shame. since you up and left it has never been the same. why would I lie, you never realize. that when I'm in your presence you would give me butterflies. Remember talkin till 4 in the morning. I would ask you if you're tired you said no with yawning. the next day, same thing. oh why did you have to go away. And I just thought that you should know. you are always on my mind. and I can never let you go, not even if I try. I can fill the deepest valleys with all the tears I cry. and I never wanna have to say (goodbye, goodbye). If you could see how my heart cries. 'cause I never wanna say goodbye. I can't let go even if I try. I don't wanna say (goodbye, goodbye). Baby girl if you're listening to this. I made a little list with all the little things I miss. your long hair, beauty eyes, super model lips. when you give my hand a squeeze every time that we kiss. when we watching television. just a couple of the things I sit on reminiscing. and I will start to cry every time that you will cross my mind. And I just thought that you should know. you are always on my mind. and I can never let you go, not even if I try. I can fill the deepest valleys with all the tears I cry. and I never wanna have to say (goodbye, goodbye). If you could see how my heart cries. 'cause I never wanna say goodbye. I can't let go even if I try. I don't wanna say (goodbye, goodbye). And I jus want another chance. forget about everything and just give me back romance. I love the way you move, I love the way you walk. the way your eyes close when you smile and you talk. And just the thought of me without you drives me insane. and It'll never be the same if I ever said (goodbye, goodbye). And I just thought that you should know. you are always on my mind. and I can never let you go, not even if I try. I can fill the deepest valleys with all the tears I cry. and I never wanna have to say (goodbye, goodbye). If you could see how my heart cries. 'cause I never wanna say goodbye.

solo,"(Intro). I said I don't want to part this earth. If I got to do it solo. (Verse 1). See how we used to be a team. Running the streets. Ya we was living out our dream, ohh. You used to be my rider. I was your provider. Now we separated in two. Oh we was burning up the block. And everybody know when we step in the spot, ohh. See, we was like the dynamic duo. I'd never thought that you'd go back, but you did. You did. (Pre-Chorus). Oh baby you left and sailed away alone. (Yeah, alone). And now you got me trapped up on this island.

You asked me [pinned] onto my top line. Put us together. And you offered it the rewind. See, you give me a purpose. Now I'm getting nervous. That my heart will never sing again. Oh, when we were burning up the airways. Didn't know I was from the Virgin Islands or the U.K.. See, we was on the way to the platinum and gold. Never thought youd go back, but you did. Yeah, You did. (Pre-Chorus). Oh baby you left and sailed away alone. (Yeah, alone). And now you got me trapped up on this island. With nowhere to get home. (Chorus). And I don't wanna go, go.

goodbye,"(Goodbye, goodbye). I'm speaking from the heart, no shame. since you up and left it has never been the same. why would I lie, you never realize. that when I'm in your presence you would give me butterflies. Remember talkin till 4 in the morning. I would ask you if you're tired you said no with yawning. the next day, same thing. oh why did you have to go away. And I just thought that you should know. you are always on my mind. and I can never let you go, not even if I try. I can fill the deepest valleys with all the tears I cry. and I never wanna have to say (goodbye, goodbye). If you could see how my heart cries. 'cause I never wanna say goodbye. I can't let go even if I try. I don't wanna say (goodbye, goodbye). Baby girl if you're listening to this. I made a little list with all the little things I miss. your long hair, beauty eyes, super model lips. when you give my hand a squeeze every time that we kiss. when we watching television. just a couple of the things I sit on reminiscing. and I will start to cry every time that you will cross my mind. And I just thought that you should know. you are always on my mind. and I can never let you go, not even if I try. I can fill the deepest valleys with all the tears I cry. and I never wanna have to say (goodbye, goodbye). If you could see how my heart cries. 'cause I never wanna say goodbye. I can't let go even if I try. I don't wanna say (goodbye, goodbye). And I jus want another chance. forget about everything and just give me back romance. I love the way you move, I love the way you walk. the way your eyes close when you smile and you talk. And just the thought of me without you drives me insane. and It'll never be the same if I ever said (goodbye, goodbye). And I just thought that you should know. you are always on my mind. and I can never let you go, not even if I try. I can fill the deepest valleys with all the tears I cry. and I never wanna have to say (goodbye, goodbye). If you could see how my heart cries. 'cause I never wanna say goodbye. I can't let go even if I try. I don't wanna say (goodbye, goodbye)"
