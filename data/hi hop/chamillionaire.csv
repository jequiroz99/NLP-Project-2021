ridin' (feat. krayzie bone),"They see me rollin. They hatin. Patrolling they tryin to catch me ridin dirty. Tryin to catch me ridin dirty. Tryin to catch me ridin dirty. Tryin to catch me ridin dirty. Tryin to catch me ridin dirty. My music so loud. I'm swangin. They hopin that they gon catch me ridin dirty. Tryin to catch me ridin dirty. Tryin to catch me ridin dirty. Tryin to catch me ridin dirty. Tryin to catch me ridin dirty. Police think they can see me lean. I'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen. When you see me ride by they can see the glean. And my shine on the deck and the Tv screen. Ride with a new chick, she like hold up. Next to the playstation controller is a full clip and my pistol. Turn a jacker into a coma. Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone. Just tryin to bone ain't tryin to have no babies. Rock clean itself so I pull in ladies. Laws of patrolling you know they hate me. Music turned all the way up until the maximum. I can speak for some niggas tryin to jack for some. But we packin somethin that we have and um will have a nigga locked up in the maximum. Security cell, I'm grippin oak. Music loud and tippin slow. Twist and twistin like hit this dough. Police pull up from behind and is in his throat. Windows down gotta stop pollution. Cds change niggas like who is that producing?. This the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruisin. Got warrants in every city except Houston but I'm still ain't losin. They see me rollin. They hatin. Patrolling they tryin to catch me ridin dirty. Tryin to catch me ridin dirty.

I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope this big ol Excursion swerving all up in the curve man. Nigga been sippin on that Hennessey and the gin again is in again we in the wind. Doin a hundred while I puff on the blunt. And rollin another one up, we livin like we ain't givin a fuck. I got a revolver in my right hand, 40 oz on my lap freezing my balls. Roll a nigga tree, green leaves and all. Comin pretty deep, me and my do-jo. I gotta get back to backstreets. Wanted by the six pound and I got heat glock glock shots to the block we creep creep. Pop Pop hope cops don't see me, on a low key. With no regards for the law we dodge em like fuck em all. But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all. Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark, but well if you want, nigga you poppin dark. Ready or not we bust shots off in the air Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire. They see me rollin. They hatin.

100 million (freestyle),"[Intro: Chamillionaire - talking]. Haha, a wise man once told me. keep me your friends close and keep your enemies closer. And he only got close enough to tell me that because,. well he was a enemy. Shout out to all my frenemies, haha, Major Pain boy. Yeah, yeah!. [Verse: Chamillionaire]. I'm in first place, in this wonderful World chase. I'm a current case of a rapper that won't break. Playin dirty (yeah), I'm too sick with the word play. I make words that don't rhyme start rhymin like ""you're gay"". Be on your way, I'm a mercy mercy. You be workin hard, she givin me your pay. Women walk up to me, ""it's nothin"" that girl say (yeah). Stick money on my shirt like it was my birthday (hey!). Let's go, rest mo', get slowed. I'm like ""f hoes"", they metroed, I'm petroed. Get blowed by your girl like red nose. And every single day I'm catchin a head cold (hachoo). ""Pimp Mode"", Katt Williams, yeah them know. Put it on a tape and call it the ""Best Show"". Koop' versus Chamillionaire, which is the best flow?. You'll probably see a tie like NBA dress code. Be the best to' (woo), jump up and get squashed. Just thoughts, just talk your lip gloss. 'Cause you spit soft, thick bosses get off. And I know what you're thinkin, I hit ya with this pause (haha). They say you shouldn't throw stones at a glass house. Got my money up and I throw out of my stash house. What your cash 'bout? I ain't takin the tag out. Ask me why I bought it, my wallet just passed out. Rapper ran mouth and I bet he get ran out. I bet another sucker gonna follow that man route. I'm a bad cough, that sick, big, bad boss. See me and they bow like ""wow, Chat Moss"" (haha). Tryin to say that you ain't real if you got it. Yeah I'm on the internet because it fill up my wallet. Uh, street money helped me get into college. I bust you in your face, log on and Twitter about it (woo!). Uh, the auducity, run 'em over like athletes. Self serve means I'm the only person that's gassin me. You should ask of me, money lookin like math to me. One plus one equals equity, what it has to be. Uh, better come at your boy carefully. Or get shown the definition of real reality. Who's as bad as me? Any other name is calamity. 'Cause I be flippin the G's daily like Vanna be. Wanna challenge me? What a beautiful day that that'll be. You could battle me any Sunday through Saturday. You a cavity, too sweet to even handle me. I'm insanity, not sane, my brain out of me (woo). Take a budget, turn it into confetti. If I start another label I'm a call it ""Machete"". Nah, won't drop an album 'til I'm motherf'in ready. Was gonna call it ""Venom"", when I'm strikin I am deadly. Don't know me Mister, don't ask me about my sister. They don't really know me but label me like a risk a. You can have all the swagger, you can have the charisma. If I want your opinion, I'll log on the 'net and Twit ya (Tweet). It's the Mister ""Sicker Than Every Pic Ya Makin"". But it's no hate and they waitin to get ya issue. And it's official, I'm so official. Turn my iPhone towards me and I take a picture (cheese!). Women say you real and say that they wanna kiss ya. Haters see it happen, that day they gonna wanna diss ya. Promise it's a myth, you need to know I will get ya. Richer, so I call up my lawyer before I hit ya (uh). You mess with me, impossible gonna be possible. What you think we even look at the Oscars for?. Hang with me to hear product 'cause he a gossiper. Thought that we was fly but ain't like a ostrich bro (woo). That's why I say no way,. Larry King of this thing, my pay stay okay. Mixtapes in the street and pass A plus K. Aunt Jemima plus vagina, you a sweet pussy. Every verse is a better verse, you know what it's worth. Since my birth been blessed with a curse, realest on the. Earth. It's a curse, get another nurse, in a mini skirt. Make her work 'til her feet is hurt, open up your purse,. Captain Kirk. I can't ever be, she'll be payin me (me). Walkin through the mall like we on a shopping spree (spree). Open up the garage, yeah everything you see,. black on black like the NAACP. Gettin money, yeah I let the cat out. I get any sicker then I'm probably gonna pass out. In the studio 'cause they sleep on me like the black couch. Still got mad clout, that's what haters is mad 'bout. Here we go, here we go, I'm in the studio. My whip got me feelin like my name was Domino. 'Cause it's a big six with me everywhere I go. Your chick is still tryin to get me in a figure four. Lookin for some hotness, let a heat seeker know. George Bush, one push, let a heat seeker go. Hit the studio, there goes another heat seeker ""whoa! "" (whoa). But I don't know why they doubt 'cause. I've done this before (whoa). [Outro: Chamillionaire - talking]. I want a hundred million dollars, hundred million dollars. Hundred million dollars, hundred million dollars.

I'm a Chamillionaire, but got billionaires for my neighbors (Rock On). I been havin paper, I been havin stacks. The crowd screamin loud in every city on the map. Got the groupies goin crazy, they don't know how to act. I bring em backstage and tell em baby just relax. [Verse 1]. Rock on, they see the jewels is so sick,l like flu spit and flu cough. Take it off and you lost, the tough talk get tooled off. Keep the 4 iron near, keep on thinkin that it's for golf. Nickel Plate on your head, silverware's food for thought. Grammy winner the haters is like 'How could this happen?' (how?). On the red carpet so much they mistake me for Aladdin (wow?). How I'm a rapper with revenue like a rock star?. If I'm near you can believe the black card is not far. 'Teen Spirit' ain't what they smellin, they yellin 'Where that Nirvana?'. The crowd is rockin n rollin, them swishers full of marijuana. They judgin me like your honor, your daughter's here with her mama. They tell me that I'm a charmer, more freakier than Madonna. Famous look right at me and said 'Know why i got my ligher up?'. 'Cause like the throwback P. Diddy alias I'ma 'Puff'. See how we rippin up tickets that police be writin us. Do like Michael Jackson's complexion Mr. and lighten up. [Chorus].

The cloud see me and they cry just to get a glimpse of I. Got Mother nature so jealous she knockin pigeons out the sky. Can't help it, i got em rockin they pelvic-bones. And losin clothes. The higher my album sales get. They love me, that's right you nailed it. They treatin me like I'm Elvis. Naked pictures she mailed. She licked on a stamp and melted. So save your rap for the rookies, 'cause there ain't no rappers here. A show you do in a club is a show we do in the ampitheatre. We packin stadiums, ladies come in i'll introduce ya. It's too packed to maneuver, crowd look like LaLaPalooza. We outshinin the losers, know i ride with the Ruger. You know I'ma producer, weapon upside ya medulla. Got no time to seduce a Super Head type of seducer. Groupies tyrin to snake me, but Koopa denyin' Medusas. [Chorus]. Ladies love it when your livin like a rock star. I got em screamin loud as they be screamin comin out broads daily. Ladies love it when your livin like a rock star. She's sayin she's in love with me and she is probably your lady.

slow loud & bangin,[Hook: Chamillionaire]. Slow loud and bangin'. I turn my speakers up. And then I just start swanging. Sometimes I get behind the wheel. Then I start to steer. Don't know where I'm going but just get me out of here. Slow loud and bangin'. I feel the breeze and it be feelin so amazing. See baby I'm just trying to live. And I got stress for real. So I drop the topper 'cause how will that make me feel. [Verse 1: Chamillionaire]. Drop the top and then you know the drill. Git the strips so I can show the wheels. People say that I'm over thrill. But when they talk about me they promote and steal. They told me real to recognize the real. But if you real then you should know Chamill. If you don't then you should get a coke. Because a coke show that it's the cola feel. Wooden rippen written on my plates. This type of weapon is in normal ways. But I can see you ain't got a clue. So be a good detective and get on the case. You can sit on that couch at home. And not reach success and then call it fate. ‘Cause y'all the type that applies the brakes. But know that I'm the type that ain't trying to wait. [Hook]. Slow loud and bangin'. I turn my speakers up. And then I just start swanging. Sometimes I get behind the wheel. Then I start to steer. Don't know where I'm going but just get me out of here. Slow loud and bangin'. I feel the breeze and it be feelin so amazing. See baby I'm just trying to live. And I got stress for real. So I drop the topper 'cause how will that make me feel. [Verse 2: Chamillionaire]. Money don't make you bullet proof from stress. You can get sued mess around and lose your vest. Get your heart broken and it bruise your chest. Peace won't guarantee the roogie's rest. Your good girl trying to find who to sex. While you try to figure what dude is next. Someday you gotta give bad news to press. But even winners gotta find new success. Meditate ain't a spare to wait. Next stop on the map is a better day. Pretend that the towers was never break. But the past's in the past so just let it chain. The passangers out with your head to lay. When I'm in the road till the getaway. The truth remain with you so be scared to say. When I turn the beat up and I let it play and say. [Hook]. Slow loud and bangin'. I turn my speakers up. And then I just start swanging. Sometimes I get behind the wheel. Then I start to steer. Don't know where I'm going but just get me out of here. Slow loud and bangin'. I feel the breeze and it be feelin so amazing. See baby I'm just trying to live. And I got stress for real. So I drop the topper 'cause how will that make me feel. [Verse 3: Chamillionaire]. Seem like this world so chopped and screw. Good parents don't give proper dues. What the hell happened to Dr. Seuss. And who taught these little kids how to cock and shoot. Turn 13 and get shot for shoes. Turn 15 and get shot in school. Get too upset when I watch the news. So I just hit the strip in the drop topper cruise. Please Lord don't fail me now. This partnership's a cooperation. I'm on the job and know who to bust. And make living longer my occupation. They always told me their money talks. I always loved a good conversation. But they ain't seein' who behind the wheel. So let's drop the top so they not mistaken. [Outro]. Slow loud and bangin'. Amazing. Down against the wheel 'cause it always makes me feel. Down against the wheel 'cause it always makes me feel alright. Slow loud and bangin'. Slow loud and bangin'. Slow loud and bangin'

Yeaah Sound of Revenge saying Universal to go get my plaque. Rappin's dead so I'ma bring it back, like DJ's do when they hear my track. Check out my track record, they'll say I'ma track wrecka. Hotter than a black pepper now that I am back nigggga (He's Baaack). You can't get mad if you feel that you and cap fit ya. Drop the biggest stat's ever so don't let that bbback hit ya.

If they got clovers on they neck we in the same gang. I'm 20 deep in V.I.P. puffin' Mary Jane. Splinters still in my hand from my woodgrain. I got homies on the West who like to gangbang. And I got homies on the East who do the same thang. I told Johhny put 50 in my pankyrang. 5 karot diamond chain vvs is in it mayne. You know I rep the dirty dirty where they move cane. You know we mix purple stuff in that blue drank. Hipnotic, Big Bodies with Blue paint. We got that oomp spray, but it still stank. You a lame so yo dame playin mind games. Ima pimp so I stay in that mindframe. Niggaz talk shit untill I let that nine bang. Me and Duke in that maybach switchin lanes. [Chorus: Chamillionaire]. I'ma show you how to get your shine on (shine on). Turn it up the DJ playing my song (my song). Everybody keep on calling my phone (my phone). Which one of y'all am I gone take home (take home). I'ma show 'em how to get the club crunk (club crunk). Give 'em something thats goin' rattle that trunk (that trunk). Tip ya cups up until ya get drunk (get drunk). Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up... [Bridge: Chamillionaire]. Heaaded to the baar (I'm headed to the baar). You know I'm V.I.P. (You know I'm vipee). And since you rollin' with a star (You rollin with a staar). You V.I.P. with mee (Chamillitary heey heey). [Chamillionaire]. Chamillitary the biggest threat to any of these rapper thinkin' they doin it. (Who That Is??) That's dem boyz from Texas that always do it big. Multi-colored diamonds got us shining They say our jewerly sick. Houston got a problem and you don't want nuthin to do wit it (Do you kid?). I ain't think so I'm tippin slow. Wen my trunk is liftin' up look at the neons as they glow. Groupies never givin' up they be everywhere I go. When that elevator go up to my suite they there fo sho. Told me that she didnt care about my money Wasnt hearin it. Looks can be deceving as Chamillion paint apperances. You know how we do it at home of Screw and purple syrup is.

bet you won't,"I bet you won't. I bet you won't. I bet you, I bet you, I bet you, I bet you. Man these rappers ain't saying nothing. Every verse is a damn lie. Your position is pro voice. My position is anti. Swear they tellin these stories to you. These rappers full of that mantie. Can't stop me they can try. But I'm winning up by that landslide. Y'all worse than that tie tanning. Get a ship but it won't sail. Y'all posting on snitchagram. Why you saying you don't tell. These boys they got no stamps. They don't really touch no mail. I'm still trying to get super poster. Still fill up under her oh well. All talking like he the man. Y'all softer than Peter Pan. So many fish in my fishtank. And my crib she talking about eating in. Call me up sure be to spend. Got money treating pass me your lamb. Play me hoe we won't meet again. And my knuckles probably gonna beat your chin. Get it off for my plan A. Never needed that B row. I ain't never even shed a tear. When anybody ever said peace out. Made a hit with my freestyles. They ain't talking about free now. They always told me that money talks. So I always got it on speed dial. I'm trying to work she trying to play. Treat the bank just like a hotter wave. And I'm showing up just like a holiday. But I'm back to work I'm not trying to stay. My money day is my kind of day. Very large is my kind of pay. Tell avado I'm not the best. I bet he was fond of you cayate. Wonder why I'm ahead of them. Talking down then I ended them. They try to say that they on your side. But switch back and forth just like pendulums. Bought your strap and extended 'em. New cars when they rented them. Our old schools look so cool. That you probably thought we invented them. Steal a heart but I'm not thief. Star snatching is so weak. You ain't gotta thank me for it. Just show respect to my OG. I drop it off in your OD. Veteran but I'm cold beat. They keep saying I don't drop. So might drop another in 4 weeks. Chamilitary go so beast. Freestyle on your beats. Gotta take it out of my 2 hands. And that's the reason it don't leak. 2 businesses out of state. No card that's out of date. I've been stuntin on 'em since '98. If you tryin' to hate then you kinda late. Hit Brazil and take frequent trips. Groupies all on that freaky tip. Say goodnight and then take a flight. When I disappear you can't keep a chip. Let me tell you how deep it get. This is more about keeping it. Take a pocket then strippen it. Then I put the profit down deep in it. Your girl talking about orgies. Rather go get more G's. Duplicate how I rep the state. We need less of them and need more of me. Spit a verse then it's for a free. Tryin to do it before hopefully. No trick or treat in my clickazie. And I'm feeling like it's your boy D. Sip patrone while they copy. Call me up and say papi. Knowing that I might store so they tryna. Block me like we play hockey. Pocket got me like Gretzky. Where the hell is my SB. I use sandboat to that paper. Going go and tell them come catch me. Don't talk about financials. Tell me what your man do. Unless you got your own dough. And you make enough cash to brag to. Hope your rent ain't pass due. Hope your shape is natural. Can't say you're a model. Even if that shit was in your bathroom. Why everybody got to be the same. Every group got to be a game. Every rapper got to be a rapper. And every rapper got to be a lame. Love my jewelry that's cool. She gonna catch a bad flu. But if my wrist ain't sick enough. Then my whip gonna make her hat you. Everything happen for a purpose. Obvious they didn't mean your verses. Every verse that y'all spit is worthless. And they couldn't pay me to give you a purchase. Every verse they say Cham is ripping. Say it's false if they tell you different. I'm still a Jordan grand and a Pippen. Up man your scripts don't have me trippin"
elevate,"[Verse 1]. Well, it's beginning to look a lot like y'all, follow my every step. Take notes on how I rep, what else would you expect?. Oh yes, they say that money talks in these streets. If money talks, then who say the most and who say the least?. Speak, that's if you can and if you can't choke. Ironically, the ones who can't the ones who ain't close. They tell me this how the city really supposed to feel. Tattoo my name in your checkbook, that'll let me know it's real. Listen, hating is a decision. I normally stay in the cut but some people hate the incision. Tell you 'bout that suspicion, I ain't getting commission. And tell you how well and different they do it in my position. Aborted mission, you shoulda coulda woulda did that. If it's 15 minutes of fame, where yo minutes is at?. What have you ever done? What have you ever did?. It's rhetorical, don't answer that, cause you know what it is. [Hook]. When you're moving on up and everybody wanna roll. They say they love me but I can never be sure. So you know, you know. I elevate on these hoes. Elevate on these hoes. They can talk down about me everywhere they go. But they don't say it when they see me in the streets though. So you know, you know. I elevate on these hoes. Elevate on these hoes. [Verse 2]. They'll tell you your fate I said you can't win. What good's a hustle when your mentality caged in?. I pull up on 'em, park it right up on the pavement. Step out and look and be stuck in my own amazement. And that feeling still ain't fulfilling. Millions on top of millions, you gon' become the villain. You see this one-room apartment where we was living?. This why I'm claustrophobic and riding without the ceiling. Guess who calling my number, sitting in her pajamas. Feeling like it's a bummer that I ain't give her the lumber. Tapping that like a drummer, turning her to a cummer. Instead I'm somewhere in winter that's feeling like it's the summer. Hold up, the garage as big as the court. How you learn how to ball and not even get in the sport?. Decorated the grill, made it look like an ESPY. But you can't see the front when you in the rear trying to catch me. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. See I came up on that Scarface and I came up on that 'Kast. That Pimp C and that Bun B the professors of my class. When a major deal had came through, who came up on one last. Same person that taught you how to come up on that cash. They say that flattery's what you get from an imitator. Gave birth to all my haters, I shouldn't have paid for your labor. When you turn to the savior, they never ask for a favor. Watch people that never gave you a favor act like they made ya. But I gotta get mine, get, get in the rotation. Gots to stay trill, never been a imitation. Never stop mine, cause they come with complications. Broke them boys off, caught 'em with intimidation. Look in my eyes, try to tell me what you're facing. Out the north side, it's a legend in the making. Watch where I slide in the elevator though. Elevate on these hoes. Elevate on these hoes"
hold up,"[Verse 1]. Self-employed so I'm paying me,. stayin' trill 'cause it pay to be. Won't lie I parked handicapped. and then get a ticket and pay the fee. Ridin' 84 or the 83, ain't ridin' them,. then they ain't wit me. How y'all pay to get in the club,. and then hate on the person y'all pay to see. Now we got my block live again,. look at these whips we're riding in. Making balling look easy baby,. we don't practice like Iverson. Sliding in on them super pokes. when I'm getting close just guard your face. All the sinners start calling God,. all the rappers start calling Mase. Drop sounding like an earthquake,. trunk bound to make the earth shake. Every day is a movie for me,. like the destination on the first date. Telling me it's her birthday, new shoes and her purse suede. You should go and preach to the choir,. I ain't the one that you can persuade. She ain't worry of the hotel,. I wouldn't even get a motel. Mess around and take your girl from you. then sell her to ya for the whole sell. (Oh well) Have her back,. won't love but I love the stacks. So I'm pulling up in that you know what,. they looking at me like, what is that?. [Hook]. Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up. Hold up, hold up, hold up. That's what they call it. Soon they see me roll up, roll up. They don't know what to call that. So they call it, call it, call it. Hold up, hold up, hold up. That's what they call it. Hold up, hold up, hold up. That's what they call it. Soon they see roll up, roll up. They don't know what to call that. So they call it, call it, call it. Hold up. [Verse 2]. Told Brad to send me a track,. he send me a track that sound like the trap. I don't know normally do this,. but hey when I do it sound like a ""brat"". Competition left laying flat,. I'm just hoping that you try. I'm just hoping you try to try me,. get drag around by your suit tie. You can catch me in a foreign city,. where they don't even know I rap. First album when platinum. so there ain't many places on my map. Going golf in Iraq, going shopping in Dubai. She'll be asking her man for gifts. and give me the gifts the her dude buy. Bought a wallet with a mouse trap,. no rat can get my cheese. Hoodrats get no scraps get throwed back like huaraches. Wanna book me for 5 G's,. read the sign that say stop please. Can't knock me my trunk knockin,. might make your woman look knock knee. Call me but I'm unreachable, too trill to be speaking to. Got lost in my own garage. and they couldn't find me for a week or two. My trunk'll open like peek-a-boo,. neon lights'll be seeping through. Candy blue, all my speakers blue,. but I turned ?em up and my speakers blew. [Hook]. Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up. Hold up, hold up, hold up. That's what they call it. Soon they see me roll up, roll up. They don't know what to call that. So they call it, call it, call it. Hold up, hold up, hold up. That's what they call it. Hold up, hold up, hold up. That's what they call it. Soon they see roll up, roll up. They don't know what to call that. So they call it, call it, call it. Hold up. [Verse 3]. Hold up man, just hold up man,. rep the state then pour up then. Chew up cheese and throw up grands. then get some bread yall know I'm jam. It's lunch time, she got one friend, but just one fine. One four, one dime, you already know which one mine. Tripping like Juicy J, Cee Lo done got me in the booth today. If it come 'tween hoes and dough. I drop off the chick and then scoop the pay. Might as well, I might as well,. passing up dough is a major fail. Take a trip to South Africa,. but can't lead the paper like Dave Chappelle. Realest rapper you'll ever meet,. she want an autograph on her fake breast. Too young or just too dumb,. girl slow it down and take a brake test. My jack is out when my Lac is out,. don't worry 'bout it, I ain't stressed. Hot chocolate on my hallo tips. they might mess around and get a taste test. [Hook]. Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up. Hold up, hold up, hold up. That's what they call it. Soon they see me roll up, roll up. They don't know what to call that. So they call it, call it, call it. Hold up, hold up, hold up.

think i'm crazy,"Chours. i dont know who you are. but you seem very nice. so will you talk to me. shall i tell u a story. shall i tell you a truth. they think i'm crazy. they don't know our life is near. Verse 1. See, it started off as just a simple conversation I gave her. The name of my record company, she said ""You a sanga"". My name's Chamillionaire and I'm a rap entertainer. Oh, you that guy they talkin about when they be whisperin aint ya. Bring ya name up when they talkin and say money will change ya. I heard a lot about how you can't deal witchya anger. Heard the rumors bout how you always in trouble or danger. Not gonna judge you if it's true so there's no need to explain. Cause ya do have a right to be, ya seem like ya nice ta me. I'm bout to order me another drink, here, would you like a seat?(Yea). I tell the bartender send Hennesey on ice for me. Her drink starts emptyin while she spillin out her life to me. Tellin me about her goasl and how successful she would like to be. Invitin me, into a session of her life and she. Seems so damn innocent, but something isn't right to me. She pulls out a picture phone ""I got pics, would you like to see?"". I'm thinkin she gotta be friendly as hell. Givin her soul to me, it's like an identity sale. We never met is the story that my memory tells. Tellin me tales like she doesn't handle Hennesey well. Gettin into it, gettin intimate, and into detail. See I just met ya and ya showin me ya kids. Who said I had any kids? I didn't bring up no kids. Then who is in this picture?. Man, lemme show you just who it is. Chours. i dont know who you are. but you seem very nice. so will you talk to me. shall i tell u a story. shall i tell you a truth. they think i'm crazy. they don't know our life is near. Verse 2. Um, I don't remember her name, but she looked like a angel. Knew she wasn't from here, I knew that she didn't hanga. Round the same part of the hood, but hey the story gets stranga. Cause this stranger was stranger than I could explain ya. See, said she wasn't married, but the ring on her finger. Told me that she was lyin and just usin the same ah. Game I use on women so I couldn't even blame her. Spittin the game I spit to em when I'm tryin to bang a. I walked into this guy and he told me he used to know you. He told me about the loyalty and the love he used to show you. He said what he said with a passion like it was so true. And took advantage of the fact that the listeners really didn't know you. His picture's in my pocket book, almost got it, I'll show you. Sheee digs in her purse and while she fumbles around. To find that photo I'm like oh no, there's some trouble in town. We turn around and see two officers comin in now. They walk in real suspicious and come and sit down. So close I could see they barrels of they guns to the ground. So close that they could listen to either one of us now (shhhh). We turn back around and then she says ""No need for whisperin"". Then she tells me ""I don't really give a damn who's listenin"". Tried to make it last a long time was my mission. And he kept on trippin and then I got pissed at him. Hit him with my fist and them punches were never missin him. Chours. i dont know who you are. but you seem very nice. so will you talk to me. shall i tell u a story. shall i tell you a truth. they think i'm crazy. they don't know our life is near. Verse 3. Okay, let's get this straight. Your man cheated on you and now. You're talkin to a perfect stranger like it's makin ya proud. And the rest of this conversation she's just tellin me how. Wasn't her boyfriend in the pic, but a familiar smile. She said pictures can be decieving like she knew he was foul. Look closely and you'll see a coward who uses his smile as power. Gleamin smoke screen, couldn't stand it another hour. So she did what she did then she went to go take a shower. What're you sayin? What do you mean?. I couldn't tell you that I'm missin him. I don't understand what you're sayin. How'd you get rid of him?. She dissin him as I ask her what it is she did to him. She stops and I say ""Eh, keep talkin I'm listenin"". I don't wanna tell about the images I'm picturin. Henny spillin and she tell me for real. That the feelin that I was feelin. Was that I wanted to kill him. Somethin is wrong here. And I know just who's the villian. Her voice was gettin louder, the moral is gettin clearer. The officers lookin at us, and I can tell they can hear her. Told me it was protection, reached for it in the stash. The plastic is what she grabbed and she put right on his ass. Busted before the blast, she thought she was free at last. ""Baby I think you crazy. I'm sorry, I'm pressin. for time. I gotta go grind,. times been interestin"". Now I sweatin, I'm stressin, this girl got me guessin. That this conversation is some type of evil confession. She pulls a clearer picture it's my damn best ex-friend. ""How you know him?"". She told me that she was wit em at his house watchin movies. Sundays is when they be chillin. And that's exactly the day that the hospital came to get him. The feelin was the worse feelin she possibly could be feelin. Stood up, and then I yelled out ""Why the hell did you kill him?"". I didn't kill him I have AIDS. She had sex with em. And that's crazy"

Yea I'm a star can't say I'm not. When I gotta tour bus for a car. Got stacks on deck and I roll with soldiers like ja-bar. While I'm in a jacuzzi watchin your braud take off her bra.

Gave a card that was sayin chamillitary to the teller. Be raining forever are logo should be an umbrella. [Rick Ross:]. Big black nigga, and an icey watch.

Like I'm coasting on cloud nine, cloud nine, I ride so clean. Hol' up, some people don't like me, must be cause I'm riding so clean. Like I'm coasting on cloud nine, cloud nine, I ride so clean. [Verse 1]. I know, I'm a master at chick removal, but I never trick cause I'm living frugal. You a boss that ain't got a boss then these bossy people don't get to boo you. See it's normally business as usual, never needed no one's approval. But it ain't under they information, want that they need to take a trip to Google. Pick her up, now your boo is missing. Tellin' me I'm her new addiction. Ladies lovin' my old school. Got me feelin' like New Edition. Maybe I should go buy another one just so I can have a new addition. I would let em all count em up but yall know my haters never knew addition. I ain't into no superstition. I'm just into new coupes with stitchin'. No degree but you'll notice we. Done spent more today than your school admission. Got the money then ladies came and they'd swear to God that I'd lose my vision. But that's somethin' you'll never see, like a Hindu Muslim and Jewish Christian. [Verse 2]. You got gossip talk you can't wait to text. I got contracts I can't wait to fax. That's why I got her so steamy, she should jump in my pool and go take some laps. Taught you losers how to get the chips. These losers like, ""I can't relate to that"". If you would have listened when I taught you that. Then you mental midgets would have made the stacks. Just admit it, you were born a hater. If you're tryna say that I shouldn't have it. I'm ridin' spokes and if you're not a broke. And not takin' notes then get a basic tablet. Got her sittin' on special fabric. She lookin' like she just left a pageant. She in the whip inspectin' gadgets. While you watchin' us like Inspector Gadget. Don't hold your breath, because I know you're waitin'. The city's somethin' I'm overtakin'. Captain Save Hers go call the pigs but I dissapear before they get the bacon. Not a hero, you're so mistaken. If you're Superman then just throw your cape in.

victory,"(*talking*). That's what it is, ""The Sound of Revenge"". Summer 2005 nigga, whoooooo. [Chamillionaire]. Gimmick rappers, can't lie forever. But as long as I'm here, gimmick rappers gon die together. Told lil' mama I love drama, no one tried to tell her. She shoulda left the club, instead of trying to find a fella. The villain's born, dark storms that's my kind of weather. Sending gimmick niggaz to the mall, to go buy umbrellas. Like Eminem was telling them, that they should die it yella. Some of my fans they look like Cham, but say I am better. Picture the though of that, since no one spit a harder rap. I told 'em that I'm Jehova's lil' brother, the God of rap. Don't play me like you a atheist, face it it's more fact. Gimmick rappers have heart attacks, when you tell 'em that God is back. The problem is more than that, like Iraq when the gats in em. You diss me you gon be done, like a snack when the rats get em. After the baptism, the black in the black hit em. No need for that gat, cause fact is the raps kill em. Live your life like a mockery, niggaz will see the prophecy. Stare at a flight of stairs, 'fore you ever think you on top of me. Nigga how could you possibly, think that you could be stopping me. Destiny couldn't stop me, I move and that hoe be watching me. Fans are no longer crying to see, Jay-Z throw up the dynasty. Not big as that nigga Jigga, but nigga tell 'em it's time for me. Rap game is dying to me, I'm the rapper they trying to see. I could bring it back, not only force-ably but violently. Ladies and gentlemen, introducing from Houston. The truth and I'm in the booth, and your truth is a big illusion. What you choosing if you're choosing, to jump into the confusion. You losing and end up choosing, and cruise it into a bruising nigga. (*talking*). I'm peeping out here in these streets, and I see these old. Record labels trying to advance, trying to drop old material. On a nigga, so instead of Controversy Sells we gon switch it up. Summer 2005, ""The Sound of Revenge"". [Chamillionaire]. Then they said on the radio, I ain't beefing with rappers no mo'. But tell 'em to go correct it, cause rappers be acting homo. Came in and screaming duo, I'm leaving and screaming solo. Disrespecting the logo's a no-no, I'll leave you rojo. Hey that's red in Spanish, real niggaz'll never vanish. We rise up and then we ride up on haters, prepare to panic. Put ya teflon on, you better go get it plant it. Rip off your chest piece, to make niggaz remember Janet. Ay log on the net, type in ""the villain"" and search. And realize why gimmick rappers is hurt, cause the truth hurts. And you jerks (you jerks), is a package of skirts. Put your little advance, back in your purse ha-ha. That nigga say he don't like me, he acting like he a wifey. Ain't held a pistol, acting like he the type that'll snipe me. You don't like me invite me, you don't like me come fight me. And if you can't afford the flight, and you don't like me then write me. I ain't concerned, with any of your concerns. I'm trying to stack, plack on top of plack like gum germs. I got enough tongue twisters, to make the tongue turn. Make the sun burn, I'm so hot I could give it sun burn. So call up, Kay Slay and ask him who is. The trillest to spit it, then call up DJ Whoo-Kid. DJ Drama, Vlad Green, Lantern and Kool-Kid. Tell 'em it's time to switch they playlist up, with the new kid. What's his name, Chamillitary mayn. (*talking*). Yeah, the hardest rap nigga and if you beg to differ. Step to the mic, and spit some'ing sicker nigga. Ha-ha, Chamillitary mayn"

How they gon talk about what you never accomplished. Like they dun done something thats worthy of my responses. Look at the tags, I'm showing 'em how to stunt G. Candy and paper plates, it looks like I got the munchies. It's so ironic they couch got money in it. But y'all always on the couch and never get any money. Where's Cupid, they only love ya till ya next hook. but I don't check the gossip blogs. I check check books. Ask Lebron he'll say winning is the best look. Every move I make is right like I aint got a left foot. To keep it real a record deal couldn't stop me. I'm bootlegging bullets, you can still get a copy. Lucifer is in a pair of heels in the lobby. I don't dance with the devil call it trilluminati. [Chorus]. So when you feels like it's everybody for themselves. And the place where ya living isn't far from hell. And they keep tellin' you that you were born to fail. And everybody say they real but it's too hard to tell. So until I die, I'mma always grind. Ima be ok, Ima be alright. If they say i'll fail, that would be a lie. But there aint no such thing as a tie. They only love ya when ya on. Northside where ya at. Northside let me know you got my back.

Westside where ya at. Westside let me know you got my back. [Nipsey Hussle]. Look, I'm a get money n-gga, on a daily basis. Road to the riches, potholes in the pavements. Thats why I follow every rule and regulation. Making rap money off this game I've been laced with. Uh, and you can blame it on black sam. Blame it on Crenshaw and Slauson Ave. Fly whip bad b@tch with a fat @ss. Bail money, big pistol and a black mask. That's how we play it, we living with the fast cash. To all my haters, consider this the last laugh. I've been the greatest in my city, now I'm past that. It's all money ascap, broke bitches bag back. Please, Louis loc's, Louis back packs. First class seats like a pillow top mattress. Uh, we can't take it to the casket so I'mma spend these racks. Just to laugh at your reaction. [Chorus]. So when you feels like it's everybody for themselves. And the place where ya living isn't far from hell. And they keep tellin' you that you were born to fail.

But there aint no such thing as a tie. They only love ya when ya on. I know, I know-ow-ow-ow. They only love ya when ya on. I know, I know-ow-ow-ow. They only love ya when ya on. What goes up, must come down. What goes up, comes down. What goes up, must come down. What goes up, comes do-ow-oown!"
2 real (feat. lil' flip),"(187, 187, 187). (Who's next?). Screwed Up Click. You know what this means, right?. Clover G! Let's go. Yeah, I'm too real to be an actor. Ya dig?. You know who you are. You be home, you behind the mic. Not me though. [Chorus]. ""Nigga's a threat, too real to be an actor"". [Lil' Flip]. This ain't a movie, this more like a screenplay. Cause on the real I went to the block each day (for real). The G way, so hit me on my three way. Look if you want to live, you better take it easy. You jump, fly with me, I clip your wings off. You violate me again, I infa beam y'all. This H-Town, the home of the trunk poppers. Oh and I'm on that kush nigga, I'm a funk doctor. I make hits in the streets and in the booth. So keep playin I'll put one on you (YOU). I'm tatted up, cause I love takin pain. I give my artist's a cheat and tell 'em ""keep the change"". I ain't petty player, I buy the whole thang. My work pure since you want to talk blow man. I got that shit that made Len Bias overdose. Yours truly, the King of the Third Coast. [Chorus]. [Chamillionaire]. Yo, it's Koopa baby, uh. Jackers pay attention and don't get the script confused. Cause I promise Black & Decker ain't gon' miss you with the tools. Better duck before you lose, like McDuck or Mr. Scrooge. I ain't givin away a golden cent or nothin to you fools. Clownin on the camera, tryin to get you on the news. Sometimes the cloest ones, the ones who tryin to see you lose. They say that ""Family Matters"" tell Urkel that I'm the truth. Cause I'm a be a ""Family Guy"" 'til Stewie get it misconstrued. Scratchin off the serial, materials get thrown away. For jackers I got that cereal, I'm pourin out the Special K. Don't get blown away, plot and you will bowl away. From no one just with a Cheerio size hole to stay. Homie it ain't no debate, some Pirelli's known to hate. So I had to motivate a set of O's to hold my swangs. Tippin on my rollerblades, head to toe way on them thangs. Tickets just get thrown away like I was supposed to pay. [Chorus]. [Lil' Flip]. Look, aye it's way too late to try to make peace. Just be glad they didn't find your ass on the streets. First they said H-Town wasn't gonna blow. But we proved 'em wrong, even Bun B went gold. I'm Michael Phelps, the way I swim up in your wife. Look I'm the reason her juice box ain't tight. (Who the King of Houston?) , y'all better say me. Cause Def Jam Vendetta is the only way you'll play me. [Chamillionaire]. NBA Live 2006, only way that they'll play me. I was born to be a boss and you just a trainee. In money that we trust, so you can trust in me. Cause I am money, you should see how much I clutched this week. They say that money talks, so you can trust this speech. It's Barack O'Balla baby, let's do lunch, let's feast. Landlord of the H, let's discuss this lease. If you in Texas and you leanin, then adjust your seat, for Pimp C. [Chorus]. [Lil' Flip]. Hey, we too real man. For real, yeah. Too real to be an actor, man. (187, 187, who's next?) 187, who's next?. Hahaha. Hey Cham man. It feel good to be amongst the platinum elite club baby. Hey let 'em know. The grind don't stop, Flipgates, Chamillionaire. It's Volume 4, right?. Hey Cham man, let these niggaz know man. I'm fuckin with these beats now. 682-561-8900"

Somewhere loading up bullets into my gat. In a black hawk sittin next to the pilot. Maybe in the college hopping outta my lac. Making curry your girl tellin me ta try that. Sending me a contact, number I'm a dial that. Later on I'm a tap tap it like a high hat. No, I can't be no hoe. Who ya know that il be d before. Whatchu thought that the kid won't gone show.

Tell me what your stats bout. Is he gettin that clout. Car that I'm pullin out looking like a black out. Gettin rid of that dawg card never max out. Cribs and money nickname jerry stackhouse.

Still up in the game so I'm bout to take the trash out. [Chorus]"

Ha ha, Chamillitary mayne! (innnn the trunk). [Verse 1]. I heard somebody say that the South ain't got no lyricists. Well 'bang bang' at the game like everyone down here is pissed. You lookin for the truth then look no further, here it is. Turn it up a notch so they can not say they not hearin this. They say Chamill is sick, click click, here's a clip. 'Bang bang' at the rap game to make your spirits lift. And it seems to me the industry is all on Jigga's dick. Who? You, you, you, and you nigga - pick a click. Universal sent me to bring some realness to the industry. Got here, then I realized that ain't nobody real but me. Okay, a couple niggaz but none of 'em real as me. Tell your favorite rapper he should diss me if he disagree. I bet I'm actin like your favorite rapper isn't me. Tell your second favorite whose the best and show 'em a picture of me. He'd have to take me out to prove that he's as sick as me. So me verse me, the only battle that y'all gonna get to see. I'm plainly sayin what I'm sayin to make these haters mad. Perpetratin hatin ass, see me ridin candy slab. Disbelieve his ass, how many vehicles can he have?. I be losin count myself and I ain't even that bad at math. That's how we do it in Texas, poppin trunk and grippin wood. We reply to threats (how?) Nigga, I wish you would. You can keep on talking, but that's only if you could. Gotta turn my speakers up, can you hear 'em now? (No) Good!. [Chorus]. Ain't runnin from a thang, cause I ain't never been a punk. Drama ain't a thang, cause I can bring it if they want. I'ma let it bang, so they can feel it in the (innnn the trunk). You bout it wit'cha game, decide your rep and throw it up. What you tryin to drank, cause I'ma bout to get you drunk. Keep it pimpin mayne, so they can feel it in the (innnn the trunk). [Verse 2]. This for the street niggaz knowin they gotta pee in a cup. Know your peace officer tossin ya when he see the results. This for the G's, hate is what you see in the scope. Gauge gonna get sprayed like it's Raid when you see him approach. Tell you ahead of time, solo I can handle mine. You ain't too smart but play the part like you a pantomime. But you don't have a nine, I'll show you I hammer mine. Time to make you do the Running Man like it's Hammer Time. Shout out to the west and all my gangstas pack heat up. Actin up and pack enough heat to make you back it up. The hoes back it up, soon as they hear the back of the trunk. Now I'ma stock like New York slang (What you mean?) That's what;s up. Money stack it up when they feel they have enough. Get the chips and add 'em up, then she givin that to us. Don't put all that in cuffs, treat your money like a slut. Niggaz better share, hell yeah, cause I just wanna cut. A hater gettin cut, someone gon' get hurt (hurt). Especially if you met me and was disrespect turf (turf). (Houston, Texas) I'm the worst, ice looking like sherbert. Bouncin off my chest, you're starin at it like a pervert. Mixtape god, don't hate me, go to church first (why?). Might as well since all the rappers wearin church shirts. Better think ahead of time, call yourself a nurse (nurse!). Diss me in your second and you won't get to finish your third verse. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. You in the presence of the finest. The game is full of fakes, all these rappin niggaz front (front). _Controversy Sells_, the industry givin 'em what they want (want). See he ain't gangsta as he say, that's why they dress 'em up. Get a vest, a plastic gun and go pull a publicity stunt. Hoe act like she slow, don't know that I'm rich. And ignore the handles missing from the do's of my whip. But then she saw me on TV and told me pause for a flick. (What you tell her?) You can ""106 & Park"" on my dick (on my dick). Can't speak about Texas and not mention me. Cause the world gon' have to see the truth come out eventually. I'll rip any gimmick rapper out from A to Z. 934-829 to the 2 if you still disagree. We never marry a hoe, what I'ma marry you fo'. I'm too busy tearin my shows up and getting married to dough (dough). Grave dig a nigga, (Whatchu mean?) I bury a flow. Run, go get your city, come back and then I'ma bury your area code"

Chamilltary boys, We the illest boys around here hoe. Flyer than a bird yes but your correct if your guess. Is that the eagle gonna hurt when aiming at your bird chest. Pow!

[Rasaq]. Mayne I'm fly as a plane, Me and Lil Wayne. Spitting game, get your girl weezy like his name. We don't have to say a thing cause the chain can explain. First they look at the piece then they look at the rang. I'm fly as a pelican, Ice on my skeleton. On a sunday morning, I stay sharper than a reverend. Candy on my doors, looking something like gelatin. Syrup in my cup but I ain't talking about medicine. I'm cold as an eskimo, throwed from my head to toe. The white tee fresh but it starts in my denims though. Yeah and if I pull down my fly, I could piss on the sky. Cause nigga I'm that high. I pulled up in heaven up in the candy painted ride. And I gave jesus five and I'm still alive. Even though I know them haters wish I would die. Even in they day dreams, i'ma still stay fly boy. [Chorus]. [Lil Wayne]. They call me Birdman Junior, I'm flyer than the rest. I'm trying to get a couple cool pigeons to the nest. And if you look at how the jewels glisten on my chest. Then you will be impressed and yes that's VS. Fly boy to death, I used to only fly. First class on every plane til I bought a jet. I'm on the runway, let down the steps. Open the phantom door and light up the cess. I smoke the best, Chamillion come get me. From University of Houston after I pass my test. Swisha laced with syrup, it'll come your nerves. So boy I'm so high, I could palm the world. Yeah and I'm strapped for the turbulence. Pow! Now you up here with me in a cloud (Chea). They call me Weezy Baby, the son of a stunner. Bitch I'm flyer than a motherfucker, ya know. [Chorus]. [Chamillionaire - Verse 4:]. Poster child to the pop trunk, I pop it up and let it bang. I'm show ya how to rep the city, correctly run the game. Grip tightly on the grain, turn it left and we call it swang. Let me show ya how to make the baddest ladies scream your name. I'll put that boy J Junior in the future in a body bag. I'm trying to quote that bad body like a boxing bag. Trying to get below the belt and beat it like a boxing jab. Hit it then I quit it like I dropped out of a boxing class. Know how we doing it, we been chopped and screwing it. Coming to get that number one spot you got like Ludacris. We ain't acting groupie-ish, taking a sip out Luda's Cris. We buy our own bottles, grab one and put it to your lips. Hating on your hood, throw your hood up, put it in his face. Repping Texas, got that real estate down in that realest state. Didn't need a bigger place, didn't need a bigger face. On my watch but forgot and went a got them both a place"
picture perfect,"(feat. Bun B). [Intro]. My life is real baby, you peeping me take a picture. You peeping me take a picture, (you should take a photograph) - [2x]. [Bun B]. Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak. Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback. (You see it's real, they be like look at that. Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph). [Chamillionaire]. Introducing the truest voice of the South, it's who else but me fool. Don't let all that foolishness they feed you, on T.V. mislead you. Don't let all the magazines, and them papers out there deceive you. The cups that be used to sip, but Caucasian kinda like my tee do. You see that hand be glistening, you see the Sedans we flipping. The hundreds of grands we getting, these units of scans we shipping. You see that Caddy tipping, them thangs on that Caddy twisting. That paint and that candy dripping, that drank and that can is missing. That ain't a Cola, though dry and you feeling sober. Boys trying to switch it over, apply it up in a soda. Home of the Houston hustlers, who grinding and hit the quota. Who fire and hit the doja, you high when you sniff the odor. Told ya you gotta have, a foreign or buy your slab. Afford it then buy it that's, important without it now. You ain't gotta take college class, to see that we bout our cash. You not if you gotta ask, let's take a pic by the slab hol' up. [Hook]. You see my slab, you see my candy slab. Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph. You see my chick, you see my chick is bad. Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph. You see it's real, they be like look at that. Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph. Photograph, ph-ph-ph-photograph-photograph. Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph. [Chamillionaire]. When I'm tipping they'll probably watch me, the cops'll be paparazzi. And try to patrol my posse, we shining and glowing glossy. The jealous will try to top me, we keep it too real to copy. What I'm listening to ain't a floppy, that disc gon be Screwed and Chop-pied. All the ballers will ride to this, deposit deposit slips. Buy the car and apply the fifth, raise the trunk an entire lift. Use to go to that Kappa, but Kappa ain't been as crunk. So I'm popping up at Daytona, on chrome and I'm popping trunk. Jamming that ""Ridin' Dirty"", while riding beside the laws. And they staring over at me, trying to scare me like I'ma pause. Tell 'em naw they know I'ma crawl, all day in the robber cause. I'm trying to go wash the ride, till them tires have whiter walls. You peeping him take a picture, that chrome and that paint official. You smoking then take a swisha, there's plenty just take 'em wit ya. You chilling you ain't a sipper, then I'ma be hanging wit ya. Take a hold of the grain and grip a, handful and smile for the pictures nigga. [Hook]. [Bun B]. You see the bling up on my bracelet, and the shine on my chest. Syrup in my styrofoam, it's sweet with doja no cess. You done put it down with the rest, time to roll with the best. Cause when you ride with the original, you ain't gotta guess. I'm the connection that you need, when they say it's a drought. Cause it's not really a drought, them other niggaz just out. And I'm the plug you gotta have, when they say the river's dry. Cause it's not really dry, they just ran out of supply. I'm too fly for the clouds, too down for the green grass. Better wear tinted lenses, if you look at my clean ass. Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak. Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback. Candy still dripping, 4's is still tipping. Wood grain grass, steering wheel I'm still gripping. Repping for P.A.T., the West and the East. And I'm repping for Pimp C, till he get back on the streets it never cease. [Hook]. [Chamillionaire]. My life is real baby, ain't just a song (ain't just a song). Gripping that wood wheel baby, and riding chrome (I'm riding chrome). This is for the real playas, that get that do' (that get that do'). Tell me how it feel baby, to see I'm-I'm riding candy and chrome. [Bun B]. Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak. Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback - [2x]. [talking]. Know I'm saying, gripping wood. Riding through the hood, and feeling good. Just like we say down in Texas, it's already. You staring at me so hard. You need to go on, do yourself a favor playa. And take a motherfucking picture"
rain,"[Talking]. I was sitting back, and I was thinking man. I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know. Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know. Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man. Nigga take two steps back, you feel me. [Chamillionaire]. They told me that pain was just in the frame, the. irony of that. Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats. Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact. Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat. Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps. To help with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed. Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats. Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat. And that one tire, left a sign of hope. That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda. broke. That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk. That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your. throat. Don't choke, you feeling like giving up. Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living. sucks. God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna. give him trust. Mama telling you pay your ties, and you yell at her. back for what. Wrong: To the path took a ride fast,Right: So the. pastor can ride faster, to get some rims on his truck. I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of. negative bucks. Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will. start to drown. But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back. around damn. [Hook: Billy Cook]. Keep your head up is what they telling me, what it. gotta be. Sorry but the world keeps stressing me, rain drops. round up the memories. It's gonna be alright is what they telling me, don't. let the stress get the best. of me. Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me, till. my heaven gets cloudy bout. a memory. [Scarface]. God knows, how I feel now. On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he. hell bound. It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of. it. Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing. I took the time out, to save a little bread. Now my eyes, got water in em. Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me. I ain't happy here. My mama said, she can't handle him. But still, I'm looking at the bright side. But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a. different color sky. Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may. never come. So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun. End it all, put a stop to the pain. That goes on in my head, everytime it rains. But that was speaking, so you listening to the. thoughts. Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk. I'm confused, by my psychological set backs. In the storm, watching out through the wet cracks. Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places. I've given up so all long faces, let it rain. [Hook]. [Chamillionaire]. Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer. Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on. your nerves. Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the. third. Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't. believing a word. Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as. steel. Not to mention the realest member, of your family is. getting ill. Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real. In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to. kneel. To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama. You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a. plumber. They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you. stronger. You'd have to be a Superman, to lift as much as me. partna. (Could tell you stay strong) you're trying, but help. is just what you doubting. Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to. drying. The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people. lying. They saying they had it worse, but how come they all. keep on smiling. [Hook]. [Billy Cook]. Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I. know. I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x. [Hook]. [singing]. My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah. Stressing me-stressing me, my memories. That's what they telling me. I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me. By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah. [talking]. When it seems like nothing but dark clouds. Are raining in on your bright, sunny day. Remember, the sunlight always comes after the rain. You should be thankful, everyday"
frontin,"Let's get 'em Happy. Go!. [Chorus]. Y'all ain't about nothing. Y'all ain't about nothing. Y'all frontin, y'all frontin, y'all frontin, y'all frontin.

You see him how he look now and he ain't found a reason. My reason is that they won't have to persuade. Me to have the courage to walk right up and say it to your face. A faker never know he fake. A hater never admit he hate. By the time they figure it out is probably gon be too late (yeah). Grinning up your face is like you tryin to let me know. That you ain't really happy how how I'm getting all this dough. Let the truth be told tell me is your friend a foe. Better make it clear or get mistaken for a hoe (Yeah). And then you take him to the floor. I can't ignore it if you're talking. But I hope that what you talking ain't about running up or robbing. Walk around like everybody is the enemy just for precaution (just for. precaution). I get no surprised and have to see an early coffin. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. And what you smokin'. your brain clouded yet the pine got your mind polluted. You got some smarts in your mind hey it's time use it. Your friends arrive talkin down on the loud music. Them niggaz's lying plus them concept is gettin included. How could they tell you, you was built to last. You built like a boxing bag, put a whoopin on that ass. See us approachin that set in motion in that hour glass. Wrong words are built too fast, find your exit and dash. Lookin for crabs in a bucket tryin criticize me (me). But they do it around them niggaz don't say it around me (me). And if they do us opposite how they feel about me (me). Turn my back and they relax and talk that lip behind me. I see you a busta and I'mma bust ya in your lip. Put some lipstick in my fist, throwin you a kiss. Since I see that you a sucker, suck a gasoline dick. Put it right up to your lip, put a lighter to the tip (boom!). [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. Where you from? (Where you from?). Act like you know I'm from the south. We ain't playin, what you sayin?. I can't hear you when you talk. What you want? (What you want?). What you sayin out your mouth?. We ain't playin, what you sayin?. I can't hear you when you talk. Where you from? (Where you from?). Act like you know I'm from the south. We ain't playin, what you sayin?. I can't hear you when you talk. What you want? (What you want?). What you sayin out your mouth?. We ain't playin, what you sayin?. I can't hear you when you talk"
void in my life,"[Hook]. When I look back at my life, I realize-realize something ain't right. I'm missing you Lord, in my life make it right. I got something to decide, just wanna make-wanna make everything right. Cause there's a huge void, a huge void in my life make it right. [Chamillionaire]. I'm staring up at the Pope, it soak it up while he spoke it. Mesmerized and repeated, like he the author that wrote it. The broads are the ones I love, just don't wanna be the corporate. So waiting for death to approach this, take the time to say no sis. I don't hate ya, for having these little seeds. At 17, best believe they're a beautiful breeze. Of fresh air when their's nothing else, I usually need. Just a smile look at em now, hoping you just believe. And my broad been in place forever, I'm gone but I'm chasing cheddar. Been gone could of kept it going, with a poem or a basic letter. But naw I just hate to tell her, try hard but I didn't let her. The groupies get at you boy, but you're my Cinderella. Look girl we can make it better, but there's a gift and a curse. While you healing a nigga feelings, your's are usually hurt. It ain't amount of cash on Earth, to match what you really worth. Know your turf has been the church, that's where you put in work. And you put in overtime, because you noticed i'm. In more danger than I've been lately, rap is mo' than rhymes. But you still hold me down, I'ma do way mo' this time. Got some time that I need to manage, girl you know that's right. And that's speaken like a true deacon, cause even to see you sleeping. That comfortabally ain't enough for me, anything that you needing. I'll cease anything that squeaks, and cease any sink that leaks. Ain't nothing gon interrupt, your sleep deep into them sheets and peep. [Hook]. [Chamillionaire]. How your father call the police, have your mama put in the jail. When the arguments always started, and ended up in a cell. Hard to it was the thought of this, ring that you use to wear. As I darted out the apartment, and pawned it to get the bail. Argument after argument, drama wasn't getting well. Talking it ain't no harm in it, smart so I didn't tell. God that it was the hardest, yeah life was a living hell. Spent part of it steady dodging it, charging off fended trails. Father say he a Muslim, your mama say she a Christian. The Bible or the Koran, which one would you be picking. When the cards are in your palm, ain't really no use in tripping. Be true to the one you choose, ain't really no use in switching. Yeah they gon have to be mad at us, choice is something I had to trust. Standing up when I had enough, for my blessings not adding up. Take too many things for granted, right after that metal gat'll bust. Somebody's life is missing, that's when the spirit grabbing us. [Hook]. [Chamillionaire]. A religion is what you missing, someone tell me how can it. Make people panic, mention God and all the weak people vanish. Take God your woman and your family, even your own life for granted. Until you slanted on the planet, with your face in the granite. And I won't have it, I don't wanna see my culture divided. So I decided to remind it, there's a choice and provide it. So put your ego to the side, soon as you standing beside it. Raise your right hand, and let the spirit know it's invited. Don't need to fight it, I just wanna make it right before they bury me. Cause the truth is like therapy, plus my conscience is tearing me. Into pieces as death itself was not even fair to me. To the soldiers that passed in the game, we missing you terribly. Thank my family especially, in my mind like telepathy. Staying humble's the recipe, keep my faith and he blessing me. I use the energy left in me, to make sure they respecting me. Walk the steps of my destiny, like I know he protecting me. I'm a leader, believe the people won't get to see less of me. No they won't see the death of me, or no police arresting me. I live life so successfully, and just show em the best of me. On another level mentally, this position was meant for me. [Hook]"
outro,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top. They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about. When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop. But this the sound of revenge. Yea. On the path to find out who's true. The only person you can really trust is you. And if you feel like you can't even trust you. Then you can always trust you know who. And if you don't know who you know who is. Then I feel so sorry for you. Cause that's really the only person that can judge you. Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do. Shouldn't do and must do. But when you got that glow. Nobody else's words can really budge you. Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin. And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win. Sometime it sound like :gunshot:. Is what it coulda been. When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in. But ya change that meanin up and success is what it is in the end. And instead of worryin about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been. Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it mov-in. Know what I'm sayin?. Well say it again. Keep it mov-in. Know what I'm sayin?. Screw it then. Know what I'm sayin?. If you're waitin for me to fail, your time is runnin out on that clock. I'm runnin to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop. Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got. It's the sound of revenge"
clap,"[Hook. (hey-ya hey-ya) , ooh-ooh-ooh (clap). [Chamillionaire]. Only imagine, how close all the diamonds in the jewel sit. Invisible set and canary yellow, as a tulip. See I can spit some calm words to you, through my two lips. I can have them hollow tips, popping up out them two clips. You pick, don't run up on me with your tool slick. I'll be damned if I get jacked with a strap, under my blue nit. Don't do nothing foolish, cause I'll completely lose it. Give a nigga a new breathing hole, with a pool stick. I got hoes square rooted, doubles and cubics. They come in groups of two or mo', and they be wanting do it. Got females that do lick, and some that strictly do dick. But if you freaky prove it, I'll go get the cool whip. If you love your shirt so much, that you don't wan' remove it. Then you can get up out my party, you can get excluded. Don't know what click that you with, but I'm king of the new click. Color Changin' Click-clack rap, I plan to rule it clap. [Hook. [Chamillionaire]. If you owe me any more than zero cents, time to collect fool. I step through, and re possess the nigga my respect's due. Hope the numbers you wrote in the middle, of that check's true. Unless you fast, and don't think a bullet can catch you. Buy a drink I bet you, that she gon get the next two. Or she'll be standing next to, the pay phone and get. Left too bad, your homie had already left too. Can't take you home look at your feet, and now she right and left too. Who's next to, let Koopa undress you and sex you. Can't get you pregnant, condom packs go in and get two. We can chop it up like O. G. Ron C, and Mike Watts do. Or treat you like some Southern music, and make sure you get screwed. [Hook. [Chamillionaire]. Internet, Chamillionaire. com on my channel. Run up on the vehicle, I bet that boy get handled. I don't like your tone of voice, you better calm your grammar. And slap you with the baking soda, my arm and hammer. Chain hanging to my nuts, is kinda like you tasting. Ice, if your tongue is in the right location. I don't fight temptation, I invite temptation. Cause I got a lap that, I would like your face in. Hey ya-hey ya, ooh-whoa Kemosabi. This liquor in my body, and I'm ready to party. Hey ya-hey ya, ooh-whoa Kemosabi. Hypnotic is for kids, we sipping Gin and Bicardi. Hey ya-hey ya, the minute she saw me. She whispered, all the things she wanna do. So you know I'ma do, just what a playa do. And let her leave with me, then send her home to you probably. [Hook. Hey ya-hey ya, hey ya-hey ya. Hee-ooh, hey ya"

'Cause you spit soft, thick bosses get off. And I know what you're thinkin, I hit ya with this pause (haha). They say you shouldn't throw stones at a glass house. Got my money up and I throw out of my stash house. What your cash 'bout? I ain't takin the tag out. Ask me why I bought it, my wallet just passed out. Rapper ran mouth and I bet he get ran out. I bet another sucker gonna follow that man route. I'm a bad cough, that sick, big, bad boss. See me and they bow like ""wow, Chat Moss"" (haha). Tryin to say that you ain't real if you got it. Yeah I'm on the internet because it fill up my wallet. Uh, street money helped me get into college. I bust you in your face, log on and Twitter about it (woo!). Uh, the auducity, run 'em over like athletes. Self serve means I'm the only person that's gassin me. You should ask of me, money lookin like math to me. One plus one equals equity, what it has to be. Uh, better come at your boy carefully. Or get shown the definition of real reality. Who's as bad as me? Any other name is calamity. 'Cause I be flippin the G's daily like Vanna be. Wanna challenge me? What a beautiful day that that'll be. You could battle me any Sunday through Saturday. You a cavity, too sweet to even handle me. I'm insanity, not sane, my brain out of me (woo). Take a budget, turn it into confetti. If I start another label I'm a call it ""Machete"". Nah, won't drop an album 'til I'm motherf'in ready. Was gonna call it ""Venom"", when I'm strikin I am deadly. Don't know me Mister, don't ask me about my sister. They don't really know me but label me like a risk a. You can have all the swagger, you can have the charisma. If I want your opinion, I'll log on the 'net and Twit ya (Tweet). It's the Mister ""Sicker Than Every Pic Ya Makin"". But it's no hate and they waitin to get ya issue. And it's official, I'm so official. Turn my iPhone towards me and I take a picture (cheese!). Women say you real and say that they wanna kiss ya. Haters see it happen, that day they gonna wanna diss ya. Promise it's a myth, you need to know I will get ya. Richer, so I call up my lawyer before I hit ya (uh). You mess with me, impossible gonna be possible. What you think we even look at the Oscars for?. Hang with me to hear product 'cause he a gossiper. Thought that we was fly but ain't like a ostrich bro (woo). That's why I say no way,. Larry King of this thing, my pay stay okay. Mixtapes in the street and pass A plus K. Aunt Jemima plus vagina, you a sweet pussy. Every verse is a better verse, you know what it's worth. Since my birth been blessed with a curse, realest on the. Earth. It's a curse, get another nurse, in a mini skirt. Make her work 'til her feet is hurt, open up your purse,. Captain Kirk. I can't ever be, she'll be payin me (me). Walkin through the mall like we on a shopping spree (spree). Open up the garage, yeah everything you see,. black on black like the NAACP. Gettin money, yeah I let the cat out. I get any sicker then I'm probably gonna pass out. In the studio 'cause they sleep on me like the black couch. Still got mad clout, that's what haters is mad 'bout. Here we go, here we go, I'm in the studio. My whip got me feelin like my name was Domino. 'Cause it's a big six with me everywhere I go. Your chick is still tryin to get me in a figure four. Lookin for some hotness, let a heat seeker know. George Bush, one push, let a heat seeker go. Hit the studio, there goes another heat seeker ""whoa! "" (whoa). But I don't know why they doubt 'cause. I've done this before (whoa). [Outro: Chamillionaire - talking]. I want a hundred million dollars, hundred million dollars. Hundred million dollars, hundred million dollars.

You be home, you behind the mic. Not me though. [Chorus]. ""Nigga's a threat, too real to be an actor"". [Lil' Flip]. This ain't a movie, this more like a screenplay. Cause on the real I went to the block each day (for real). The G way, so hit me on my three way. Look if you want to live, you better take it easy. You jump, fly with me, I clip your wings off. You violate me again, I infa beam y'all. This H-Town, the home of the trunk poppers. Oh and I'm on that kush nigga, I'm a funk doctor. I make hits in the streets and in the booth. So keep playin I'll put one on you (YOU). I'm tatted up, cause I love takin pain. I give my artist's a cheat and tell 'em ""keep the change"". I ain't petty player, I buy the whole thang. My work pure since you want to talk blow man. I got that shit that made Len Bias overdose. Yours truly, the King of the Third Coast. [Chorus]. [Chamillionaire]. Yo, it's Koopa baby, uh. Jackers pay attention and don't get the script confused. Cause I promise Black & Decker ain't gon' miss you with the tools. Better duck before you lose, like McDuck or Mr. Scrooge. I ain't givin away a golden cent or nothin to you fools. Clownin on the camera, tryin to get you on the news. Sometimes the cloest ones, the ones who tryin to see you lose. They say that ""Family Matters"" tell Urkel that I'm the truth. Cause I'm a be a ""Family Guy"" 'til Stewie get it misconstrued. Scratchin off the serial, materials get thrown away. For jackers I got that cereal, I'm pourin out the Special K. Don't get blown away, plot and you will bowl away. From no one just with a Cheerio size hole to stay. Homie it ain't no debate, some Pirelli's known to hate. So I had to motivate a set of O's to hold my swangs. Tippin on my rollerblades, head to toe way on them thangs. Tickets just get thrown away like I was supposed to pay. [Chorus]. [Lil' Flip]. Look, aye it's way too late to try to make peace. Just be glad they didn't find your ass on the streets. First they said H-Town wasn't gonna blow. But we proved 'em wrong, even Bun B went gold. I'm Michael Phelps, the way I swim up in your wife. Look I'm the reason her juice box ain't tight. (Who the King of Houston?) , y'all better say me. Cause Def Jam Vendetta is the only way you'll play me. [Chamillionaire]. NBA Live 2006, only way that they'll play me. I was born to be a boss and you just a trainee. In money that we trust, so you can trust in me. Cause I am money, you should see how much I clutched this week. They say that money talks, so you can trust this speech. It's Barack O'Balla baby, let's do lunch, let's feast. Landlord of the H, let's discuss this lease. If you in Texas and you leanin, then adjust your seat, for Pimp C. [Chorus]. [Lil' Flip]. Hey, we too real man. For real, yeah. Too real to be an actor, man. (187, 187, who's next?) 187, who's next?.

Niggaz was throwing rocks at the throne. and I got word of that. The sequel to the Messiah, for what I already murdered that. Niggaz hating on me, but look at 'em the nerve of that. Nigga this ain't this type of beef. you can't take the burger back. Burner back into my pocket, I'm trying to stop it. Unless your mouth keeps leaking, dick back in your socket. How does it feel, to know you wasted your whole lifetime. Living your whole lifetime, just to worry bout mine. Gimmik niggaz was dissing me. he was fake they was missing me. Came to replace and make history, B I made 'em history. You could feel like you real, because that feeling eventually. Gon shrivel up, when reality turns it into misery. And you niggaz is killing me, with your wanna-be-me's. You a artist we bosses, the ones that fund c. d. 's. All your gonna-be wanna-be, gonna punish me please. You got me laughing, I'm asking if niggaz wanna be Steve. Harvey, no you're hardly funny at all. Running the game not at all, homie you running your jaw. We grown folks, kiddy schoolers need to go run up the hall. Niggaz boring just ignore him, and the dummy'll fall. My brother is my descendent, we running a mile a minute.

But whatever you do, don't let the door knob. hit you on the way out. [Chamillionaire]. Ladies and gentlemen, homie must be on heroine. Victory for me, but he thought he would have the narrow win. My aim is to blame, when I load it inside the barrel and. Put the third eye on him, and do a lil' more than stare at him. Poet I know it, I Mr. modern day Shakespeare. I'm a rider survival is what it is, it ain't fear. The absolute truth, is just some'ing some niggaz can't hear. Mike don't live here no mo', he got convicted he ain't here. How the heck you set fiction on the table, put truth aside. What you speaking my nigga. you can't look me into my eyes. The good Lord spoke the truth. and that just got him crucified. Y'all scared of the sharp dagger. you trading your truth for lies. Look me in my eyes, nevermind I ain't trying to spook ya. Voice of the present the past, yep I'm the future. Soon as you speak the truth. all the haters will try to mute ya. But if you the truth, all the traitors will call you Koopa. Martin Luther King Koopa, many of 'em will listen. But if you can't take the heat. then get your hot ass out the kitchen. I heard words from Makevelli, riding was the ambition. So I bomb first on fake niggaz, like I'm in his position. Ay Chamillion you tripping, naw I'm handling bidness. Raise my hand to the man, and my right hand is my witness. I got a fo' to the fizzle, that's sure to damage your fitness. But it ain't really even that serious, to tear you with stitches. P you acting suspicious, you know me better than that. If it was for a false reason, I would never react. But you know me better than rap, niggaz was telling me facts. So you can miss me with publicity. if they telling me that never that. (*cheering*). (*talking*). Thank you-thank you, I appreciate the support. But everyone please take your seats. I'm not done there's more. [Chamillionaire]. In this world of falsifying, where niggaz be claiming they real. Turn around and tell you a lie, bout what he paid on his grill. Same nigga that talk big, bout what he made on his deal. The same to ask me for advice. like they don't pay me Chamill'. Rappers ain't really real, only a few of 'em ball. Pissy colored diamonds yep, I'm one of the few of 'em y'all. Talking bout no piece and chain, and a few lil' cars. Four thousand or five thousand, for what you do as a start. Now keeping money in the vault, is the hardest part of the art. Knowledge got my crew smart, even when my crew was apart. Chamillionaire you did 'em wrong, why don't you get a heart. If I showed it to you, would you see. what it could do in the dark. Whether you like it or not, don't really matter to me. Cause most of the love I normally keep. inside my family tree. So you can gossip. bout what really happened with Hatta and me. Or you can gossip bout how so-and-so. way badder than me. It don't really matter to me, becuase I'm done with it now. Maturity level that I'm at, isn't even fun for a child. So set your mouse pad on the Internet, and punish my style. Or set your Reeboks on the streets of Houston. running me down. It's whatever I've been better, at proving a nigga wrong. Tell Goliath I don't need rocks, to prove a lil' nigga strong. So tell Watts, forgive me I'm grooving I'm in my zone. Property of Mike who, he ain't here that lil' nigga gone. (*cheering*). (*talking*). Ha-ha ok we gon chill out, we gon chill out mayn. We gon try to just keep it moving, you know I'm saying. Focus on the music, give the fans some'ing to ride to. You know I'm saying, ""The Sound of Revenge"" will be. One of the best albums, to come out the South. And I put everything on that ha. let me give a couple shout out's. Shout out to Shahiem Reid, up there at MTV2. I appreciate the love. Flex, Ke'noe, Killa Mike, Big Girl, 'sup Nancy. We gon shake these haters off, know I'm saying ha-ha. Who am I forgetting, James Shepard 'sup my nigga. 'Sup my nig' ha-ha, O. Gizzle 'sup my nig'.

all black everything (freemix) (feat. lupe fiasco),"[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]. You would never know. If you could ever be. If you never try. You would never see. Stayed in Africa. We ain't never leave. So there were no slaves in our history. Were no slave ships, were no misery, call me crazy, or isn't he. See I fell asleep and I had a dream, it was all black everything. [Lupe Fiasco]. Uh, and we ain't get exploited. White man ain't feared so he did not destroy it. We ain't work for free, see they had to employ it. Built it up together so we equally appointed. First 400 years, see we actually enjoyed it. Constitution written by the W. E. B. Du Bois. Were no reconstructions, Civil War got avoided. Little black Sambo grows up to be a lawyer. Extra extra on the news stands. Black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan. Malcolm Little dies as a old man. Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him. Followed by Bill O'Reilly who read from the Quran. President Bush sends condolences from Iran. Where FOX News reports live. That Ahmadinejad wins Mandela peace prize. [Choru]. [Chamillionaire:]. Martin luther had a dream got a movie in my head and it's. So repetative so I think that it's time to tell em it. Who's ahead of it bun b would be the president. Cause all us texas boys id do it bigger than they ever did. Not so competitive nobody would be your nemesis. Ain't no devilish sinners doing what the devil did. A muslim sits at a coffee table with the methadist. Listen to method man talking tell em what the method is. Can do it effordless he would be who your professor is. Mr ice cubes who we use to watch the defacites. Just a brief case wouldn't have ta wear a vest with it. Saving in your cheque and bank account wouldn't be so decilate. And what's a pessimist every person would be gettin chips. Wayne and sean carter would be 2 people you would never diss. To make a living strippers wouldn't have to show there nakedness. They would make 6 figures just to serve a plate of beverages. Lil kim in the lab mixin like a chemist did. Nicki minaj she the potion tell her that she messed with it. No fighting with a record label to get levarage. Gucci mane would be the c. e. o and talk with eliquence. Just like elephants everybodies pockets hella thick. Koopa wonders this but for now well say it's tenative. Reality shows stars always show intelligence. And nobody would have to beef because we all be gettin rich. I know this this type of dream seems like a stretch. But everyone of us would be the best. With plenty of money. Yea everyone of us would see the change. And we would never have to worry bout dealing with stress. Cause really none of us would be depressed. We would do what we wanted. Ya couldn't tell me that that wouldn't be freshh. [Chorus:]. [Lupe Fiasco:]. Uh, and I know it's just a fantasy I cordially invite you to. Ask why can't it be?. Now we can do nothing bout the past. But we can do something about the future that we have. We can make fast or we can make it last. Every woman Queenin' and every man a Kingin'. When those color lines come we can't see between. We just close our eyes 'til it's all black every-THING. [Chorus]"

And you fronter ain't a fronter and he at ya' door. [Chamillionare]. All I feel is pain. All I got is pain. All I got is pain. [Famous]. Like umbrellas better open up. The game shoulda soaked it up. Be tryin bust you cokin up. Over what?. Over what? Shit root of all evil. And I didn't see what it do to all people. We all equal in the eyes of the man. And I see Jenna Six, shit had me like ""Damn! "". The fuck goin' on with the nonsense. I wanna rap about 'bout ice, but what about my conscience? (What about it?). Nonsense fame flow what you wanna. Shoot dice, fuck hoes, smoke marijuana. On the cool my generation is some gonna. so I fall on my knees the last days our partner. [Chorus: Chamillionaire]. All I feel is pain. Yeah, that's what I'm about. You hear it every time that I talk. All I got is pain. I'm going insane I feel it in my veins. All I got is pain. If you wondering (Pain) why I'm not smilin' (Pain). It's because I can't hide it (Feel it, baby). All I got is pain. I'm going insane I feel it in my veins. All I got is pain. [Chamillionaire]. All I got is pain. All I got is pain"

Said ""fuck it, bought another car"". I bought the Phantom just to say it's black. I bought the Phantom just to take a nap. I'm getting head in the backseat.

I'm on that Jizzle, spendin' my money. [Chorus]. [Verse 2: Chamillionaire]. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Know why I'm ballin cause I put in work. Know where the bank is cause you saw me step my foot in first. Moneys the root they told me ballin hard would have me cursed. This benz gon have em droppin dead I feel like it's a hearse. I hit the region I couldn't even see the sofa tell. Ain't a jacuzzi large enough for her to soak her tail. After she finish with her bidness I'm a poke her tail. That's cause she know my dough gon fold just like a poker fail. I mean a stack ya know I'm always gettin crispy cream. The money counters the amount you tryin to get machine. Whip greenish lincoln continental call it listerine. Should drop an album on you hoes let's call it kiss the ring. Uh, he think he ballin cause he hit a lick. The lick he hit is what he had after I took my split. The lick he had what I was gettin in the 7th grade. Had money hid between the head or in a cover page. Talk in english class say he speak no engalish. We talk deniro now romero speakin english fast. If money talks you better show me that bilingual cash. Or met the desert on the seat I call it eagle pass. Uh, they think they doin it like me and paul. Was doin it in '99 but do we see it aww. Naw these losers ain't equavilent at all. I wouldn't let them touch the candy on my vehicle. Yoo. [Chorus]. [Verse 3: Lil Wayne]. These hoes call me Tunechi baby. Niggas think they seeing me, they hallucinating. Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin' like a muthafucker. 12 gauge, bitch, I got a dozen of them. Nigga broke, acting like he got it though. I'm with a Spanish bitch, if she ain't fucking, adios!. So many cars I'm like eenie meenie minie moe. So many colours in the diamonds, Kaleidoscope. Last year I made a hundred million dollars flat. Run in ya house, and get to poppin' at your shower cap. My homies got them firebirds like Pontiac. And if them bitches don't sell, we buy em back. [Chorus]"
ballin' is a habit,"Ballin Is A Habit. . (*talking*). Balling is a habit over here, at Paid In Full. Want you to know that, g'yeah. [Hook - 2x]. Balling is a habit like Jordan, Bird and Magic.

When my car, is changing speed. I'm like Tarzan, swanging through trees. It's so much, ice in my mouth. When I take a deep breath, I get brain freeze. Millionaires wanna hang with me. R&B girls keep singing to me. The FEDs think, I'm exchanging ki's. Everyday new car, I'm exchanging keys. Boys riding in 7-45's, that was cool last year. But I'm V-12 in a 7-60, Kenyon passing me beer. I step in the club cameras flashing, girls wanna take my pic. Which girls am I taking home, I can take my pick. 50/50 in fur coats, so please no finger prints on his mink. I tip the bar tender more money, than I spend on the drinks. Lil' mama keep skipping and wink, she give me glances. I'ma make a move, on them sexual advances. And by the end of the night, I can garuntee I'ma be up in them panties. I ain't never slept in the same room, twice in my house. Frosty the Snowman can build a house, with the ice in my mouth. I got more diamonds than South Africa, flawless ice is immaculate. I'm flipping the game like a spatula, now these girls ex-boyfriends mad at us. [Hook]. [Chamillionaire]. No spending ends, in gentlemen's. Strip clubs, it's just for spinning rims. I want it now, I get it then. Cop it drop it, cop it again. Not him again, not Bennegan's. Treat a slut for what, not fin to spend. For bitter Gin, and dinner when.

When the album drop they'll say Chamillionaire's official. I'm lyin that's not a album cause these verses like a spricture. But back to the topic, told you I never unlock it.

Normally she simple little wobble 'fore she go to sleep. She say her help her relax but nothing help her more than me. (Wooh) Your chick is showing she Naughty By Nature OPP. You might call it Treachy I guess I'm such a ODP. Uh, that's when I knew that it was time to jet. Soon as she just stuttered and start staring at my shiny neck. Told her that tonight your blessed. cause later you'll have time to stretch. I put'cha on the floor and stretch you out like a P-90-X. Yes (yes) I write the script and she just played along. Told ya it was on the best evening that was ever shown. Wake up in the morn' and say she So Far Gone. And I done make it to the Fourth, I only played Trey Songz. [Hook:].

They say your money that we trusting. you would think that I'm crazy. If I let another man get in the bed with my baby. Ben Franklin that's the homie, so I say it's all gravy. That's the only person in the mattress under my lady. And she don't need no toys, they're no need for vibrating. When I lay her in the night, get back to doctor's eye playding. Some live to knock my hustle but they probably die hating. Hustle like it's three of me, give a Minaj a 'muwah' baby"
bet you won't,"I bet you won't. I bet you won't. I bet you, I bet you, I bet you, I bet you. Man these rappers ain't saying nothing. Every verse is a damn lie. Your position is pro voice. My position is anti. Swear they tellin these stories to you. These rappers full of that mantie. Can't stop me they can try. But I'm winning up by that landslide. Y'all worse than that tie tanning. Get a ship but it won't sail. Y'all posting on snitchagram. Why you saying you don't tell. These boys they got no stamps. They don't really touch no mail. I'm still trying to get super poster. Still fill up under her oh well. All talking like he the man. Y'all softer than Peter Pan. So many fish in my fishtank. And my crib she talking about eating in. Call me up sure be to spend. Got money treating pass me your lamb. Play me hoe we won't meet again. And my knuckles probably gonna beat your chin. Get it off for my plan A. Never needed that B row. I ain't never even shed a tear. When anybody ever said peace out. Made a hit with my freestyles. They ain't talking about free now. They always told me that money talks. So I always got it on speed dial. I'm trying to work she trying to play. Treat the bank just like a hotter wave. And I'm showing up just like a holiday. But I'm back to work I'm not trying to stay. My money day is my kind of day. Very large is my kind of pay. Tell avado I'm not the best. I bet he was fond of you cayate. Wonder why I'm ahead of them. Talking down then I ended them. They try to say that they on your side. But switch back and forth just like pendulums. Bought your strap and extended 'em. New cars when they rented them. Our old schools look so cool. That you probably thought we invented them. Steal a heart but I'm not thief. Star snatching is so weak. You ain't gotta thank me for it. Just show respect to my OG. I drop it off in your OD. Veteran but I'm cold beat. They keep saying I don't drop. So might drop another in 4 weeks. Chamilitary go so beast. Freestyle on your beats. Gotta take it out of my 2 hands. And that's the reason it don't leak. 2 businesses out of state. No card that's out of date. I've been stuntin on 'em since '98. If you tryin' to hate then you kinda late. Hit Brazil and take frequent trips. Groupies all on that freaky tip. Say goodnight and then take a flight. When I disappear you can't keep a chip. Let me tell you how deep it get. This is more about keeping it. Take a pocket then strippen it. Then I put the profit down deep in it. Your girl talking about orgies. Rather go get more G's. Duplicate how I rep the state. We need less of them and need more of me. Spit a verse then it's for a free. Tryin to do it before hopefully. No trick or treat in my clickazie. And I'm feeling like it's your boy D. Sip patrone while they copy. Call me up and say papi. Knowing that I might store so they tryna. Block me like we play hockey. Pocket got me like Gretzky. Where the hell is my SB. I use sandboat to that paper. Going go and tell them come catch me. Don't talk about financials. Tell me what your man do. Unless you got your own dough. And you make enough cash to brag to. Hope your rent ain't pass due. Hope your shape is natural. Can't say you're a model. Even if that shit was in your bathroom. Why everybody got to be the same. Every group got to be a game. Every rapper got to be a rapper. And every rapper got to be a lame. Love my jewelry that's cool. She gonna catch a bad flu. But if my wrist ain't sick enough. Then my whip gonna make her hat you. Everything happen for a purpose. Obvious they didn't mean your verses. Every verse that y'all spit is worthless. And they couldn't pay me to give you a purchase. Every verse they say Cham is ripping. Say it's false if they tell you different. I'm still a Jordan grand and a Pippen. Up man your scripts don't have me trippin"

Man you know that you had them warrants you kept ignorin the warnin'. You said that is was annoying like payin wasn’t important. Your T.V. still in the pawn and you tell them its in the storage. When the police pull you over you be given a oscar performance. A ticket u can’t afford it but expire plates on your Taurus. Ur baby momma stay trippn cause none of them kids are supported. You messed up every appointment that’s why u ain’t got employment. And spider webs in ur wallet ur pockets look like they haunted. Always wanted to be famous well u gon get what u wanted.

And you try to hide till the repot man come and shake up them pockets. Im talkin to you cause your rent is due and you ain’t try to drop it. Till the lights turned off in ur crib just like lamps that ain’t got no sockets. They coming to get what you got you tryna say you ain’t got it. You ain’t paid a payment or part of it half of piece of deposit. So I suggest that it's best that you use some reason or logic. Or the bill collecta is comin to came andsee u about it, got it?.

Finna ride by dumpin',. If anybody owe me somethin'. Then i strongly suggest you runnin'. Ya'll better respect the bill collecta. Or you can get chin-checked like the rest of em. Never did joke when it come to the decimal. When it come to gettin dough, come a professional. Fresh and I'm, in it to win it i get it bombin' in the middle. Anything, everything, over 3 digits. These suckas they really think Krayzie be slippin'. But i'm here to tell 'em what i already been through. Money is a mission, gotta have that dolla bill ya'll. Fellas willin nuff to kill ya'll. I might fall, but i get right back up and i still ball. Still raw, still get down with the Buck-Bang. So gimme all my change, bust brains 'cause i gotta maintain. Got just enough game to get me paid. Just enough aim to leave you layin. Out on the pavement, down on the game. Believe me, you'll pay 'cause i got 3 hundred 57 reasons. [Chorus]. Now your in trouble here comes the bill colleta. Now your in trouble here comes the bill colleta. [Operator]. If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. By Jamun*"

Splash, I'ma put some credit on the tab. You see the card that's black and that's the equivalent of cash. I'ma personalise my tags and call my slab the cab. Cause when she's hoppin in, yeah she gon' have to pay for that. Relax, cause I got my speakers to the max. When I speak and start massagin it's like lotion on your back. Every club that I hit is packed, everything I say is fact. So if I said it you can bet that it's gon' always be exact. [Interlude]. Haha, hi hater, I know what you thinkin. Why all the girls gotta slide towards him when he fall off in the club?. That's cause I'm smellin like ten thousand dollar cologne. You like what kind of cologne cost ten thousand dollars?. That's that Wells Fargo Number Nine, take a sniff of success baby. [Hook]. [Verse 2]. Boucin to the boot, lookin for ladies to recruit.

Somewhere loading up bullets into my gat. In a black hawk sittin next to the pilot. Maybe in the college hopping outta my lac. Making curry your girl tellin me ta try that. Sending me a contact, number I'm a dial that. Later on I'm a tap tap it like a high hat. No, I can't be no hoe. Who ya know that il be d before. Whatchu thought that the kid won't gone show.

bullet proof,"[Verse 1]. They be trying to shoot shots, I just watch their gun fail. That just made me stronger, all that hate just came with dumb bells. Ain't that cooper some' else? Got no time for duck tales. Y'all can see the picture, y'all must be looking at thumbnails. Suicide's like bye bye, he don't really ride fly. Pull ‘em curtains off top, voilá, while I. Look at that like mama, everyday I fly high. Never at the crib when I come home it's just a drive by. ""Brat brat"", yeah, that's that, these ain't just no rap snacks. I'm too busy eating while at large? my backpack. Lizard on my snap back, just accept the fact that. I'll keep collecting paper till it looks like I'mma pack rat. Had the shoe box stash when other youngings had a bug jar. I didn't have no Jordans but I made enough for a car. Gave that to my mother, none of my hustle is subpar. Must be out your mind 'cause it's my mind that got us this far. And I'm just. [Hook]. So bullet proof, so bullet proof, so bullet proof. They know they nothing they be trying to criticize all I've done. I see ‘em taking shots one by one. They pull and shoot, I keep pulling through like I'm bullet proof. It seems like everbody's aiming at you when you're number one. But that won't stop me, baby, I'm not done. [Verse 2]. I don't really know how they can find the success. But I know the way I be come and die is the best. See they gon' try their best to turn your mind to a mess. So when you never mind ‘em then it's mind in distress. They gonna try to block yes, that's part of the process. They look for success, but now they see it like the Loch Ness. Paper in my pockets, they can't even buy this. Yeah, we eating real good, but they even can't even digest. Fake is what they want to, they can't handle the truth. So I just get my camp wisdom like Iraq does with the troops. I'm the truth so what's proof? Hope you wear your taboos. They say don't burn no bridges, try to cross me and get cut loose. I'm 100 plus deuce, shadow proof ain't gun proof. But try to get some head they try to strike you through the sun roof. They just want my chair and try to push me out like the goose. Losers giving headache but success can be my masseuse. Let me get my real robe, let ‘em know I fear no. Evil, but that evil tryin' to whisper in my ear though. Wanna make a deal bro, tell me who you kill for. What you need to ask me is to tell you who I live for. ‘Cause I'm just. [Hook]"

can't give u d world,"Can't Give U D World. (featuring 50/50 Twin & Lew Hawk). . [Hook]. She wants me to give up the life, of being a playa. And running the streets with my partnas, but in exchange fa'. Plenty of love and the comfort, but I don't blame her. If I give you the world, would you do me a favor. Promise to deal with the life, of a entertainer. I'm grinding 24/7, so I can't save ya. Maybe one day, I'll put that ring on your finger. I can't give you the world, until I get this paper. [Chamillionaire]. Now we arguing and she curses, saying the money's worthless. Arguments turn to fights, and as soon as she throws that first fist. I'm ready to hurt this girl, look how she turned this. Thang sour, when every kiss use to seem like the first kiss. Now do I desert this partnership, or just work this out. When I know damn well, the problems gonna resurface. Forget the less cause first it's money, cause money turned this. Into real estate purchases, and Gucci purses. I ain't no expert kid, but I'll tell ya I learned this. Entertainment game can, come with permanent curses. Either she telling you, you the father of her kids. Or slamming the do' in your face, like it's none of your biz'. Living this earth is, harder than red dirt is. Plus society gon judge you, on what you worth is. I'm trying to make sure, the finest food touches your lips. So I'm grinding daily for both of us, we deserve this. [Hook]. [50/50 Twin]. I put a ring on your finger, when the time is right. Love can't pay the bills, so I grind all night. Don't come to the block tripping, trying to find a fight. God don't see us through, we gave Christ our life. See you gave me the world, when you gave me a girl. Peep this we made a heaven, so that's heaven on earth. I'm trying to make sure y'all set, before I'm buried in dirt. We done cheated on eachother, causing worry and hurt. But despite of your past, despite of my past. Everybody make mistakes, we both learned from that. You Bonnie I'm Clyde, let's earn this cash. For you if I was in the gang, I would burn the flag. We knew each other for a week, you put up your cards. And brought me out of jail for three week, filled cigars. I was like save your money, but you said hell naw. I explained myself now, must go stack mail girl what. [Hook]. [Paul Wall]. I remember the first time, that I saw your face. I got shivers when I looked in your eyes, but times change. And even though, you'll never be replaced. I let love loose and got wise, but I ain't tripping baby. I use to feel like, we was made for each other. But you was taking up, too much of my time. Cause how can I support a family, if I'ma make you a mother. When I ain't got time to go grind, so get your mind right. I'm feeling like, it wasn't timed right. Cause we started getting involved, right after I hit the limelight. It started seeming like, you want me to choose. But I'm right in the middle of a game, that I can't lose. I had to put our love affair on hold, so I hope you don't think. I'm trying to do you wrong, and leave you out in the cold girl. Me and you, was like best friends. Maybe later on in the future, we'll decide how the story ends girl. [Hook]. [Lew Hawk]. I'm trying my best to give you the world, but you just don't feel it. I'm trying to keep your wrist iced, and your waist Gucci fitted. And I know your friends jealous, when we flossing the scene. Cause you be Prada head to toe, while I'm starched and clean. And a love like this, it's gon cost a little. All I ask in return, is you cool off a little. While I'm stacking this cheddar, making a life for us. Is it really hard to see, I'm doing what's right for us. I'm thinking bubble baths shorty, while we sip champagne. Reminiscing good times, while we play kiss games. And this flow is from the heart, ain't no need for games. And you've been down from the start, and I don't want that to change. Speaking of change baby girl, please remember this. If your ass block my change, then your ass get dismissed. This bout walking papers, no remorse at all. Psyche I love you girl, I just want's to ball. [Hook]"
charlie sheen,"[Intro: Chamillionaire - talking]. Yeah, hold up, uh, Playlist Poison. I mean, is everybody winning? Really?. Say what you feel and mean what you mean. [Chorus 1: Rock D]. Aye, aye, coldest swag that y'all done seen, keep two bad chicks on my team. Usually known for ridin dirty but I'm always ridin clean. Roll me in a pile of green, cut my check, then kiss my ring. All-all-all I do is win, man I'm on my Charlie Sheen. [Verse 1: Chamillionaire]. Man all these boys my little sons, I know I left y'all in poor care. They said I was on my high horse but I guess that meant my Porsche chair (yeah). Checkin into that top floor, how come we don't ever see y'all there? (huh?). Y'all ain't checkin in nowhere, y'all stay logged on the poor square. Poor squares, I don't know where you got your pimp degree. I might be messin with her friend but I'll man up to it admittedly (uh). You take these girls out to eat and they leave from you and visit me (uh). Pimpin is something that I learned but don't use much like calligraphy. I'm visibly, the man, I heard you talkin about it and winning is what you say it is. But you ain't really winning homie, you really just good at sayin it (yeah). And you ain't swimmin in women homie, these women be callin you desert dick (yeah). As soon as they pull that winning on me, I'm a give them this verse then tell 'em quit. I never trick, last time I checked and check my checks, I was gettin plenty. Most people that got opinions, just talk 'cause they ain't gettin any. If you ain't lived it, then just forget it, 'cause it really ain't nothin that you could tell me. Your voice ain't even worth a penny and your convo ain't worth a meal at Denny's. [Chorus 2: Rock D - w/ Chamillionaire in the background]. Aye, aye, coldest swag that y'all done seen, keep two bad chicks on my team. Usually known for ridin dirty but I'm always ridin clean. Roll me in a pile of green, cut my check, then kiss my ring.

All-all-all I do is win, let me tell you what I mean. Cut the check and kiss the ring, make some way for Charlie Sheen. [Verse 2: Killer Mike]. Say I'm on that Carlos Estevez, I'm winning ho. I'm swimming in women that love women, so I'm bi-winning ho. Before you put your judgment on pimpin and say he sinnin. Try wakin up on Egyptian linen with Egyptian women. I'm talkin the hottest goddesses, wake me up with massages. Some say I'm a narcissist, other say I'm misogynist. I, say I'm a rock star, let's take flight in my rocket ship. Young Casanova, passin over, you simps and haters. And you never been about real bread, you ain't a baker. And you don't get rich to have one bitch, I ain't a Quaker. I remain unbought, unbossed, a young Jose-a. I'm Sheenin like my daddy before me, 'cause I'm his son. I could make these execs pay what they weigh, I'm talkin tons. Then I take that bank to Vegas and blow it, I'm havin fun. So, why would I act like a peasant, when I'm a King?. They ask me what's this drug I'm doin, that Charlie Sheen. [Chorus 2: w/ Chamillionaire in the background]. [Break: Chamillionaire]. 'Cause I'm the man, yeah I said I'm the man. You might not like who I am but you know I don't give a damn. (I don't give a damn). 'Cause I'm the man, yeah I said I'm the man (uh). Tryin to put me in a jam but you know you my biggest fan. (You my biggest fan). I'm the man, yeah I said I'm the man (uh). Know I'm 'bout my business, so just trust me and stick to the plan. (Come on). They don't even understand, how we be poppin rubber bands. (Haha, winning). [Verse 3: Chamillionaire]. They say that it ain't no ""I"" in team, I told 'em it ain't no ""I"" in Sheen. And I see way too many eyes (uh), watchin my nuts stop tryin to swing. Illest drug that y'all done seen, ho I'm clean as Irish Springs. They tell me they want that ""Tiger Blood"". Then I'm a bottle it up and supply the fiends (uh). She said she a goddess, she gonna be my side chick. Right after she slide it open, I'm pokin like a Sidekick (uh). Heard my former A&R tryin to get me words to rhyme with. I told him choke on these nuts and I don't know the Heimlich. [Chorus 2: w/ Chamillionaire in the background]"

I'm comin' down swangin' bumpin' grill (grill). Candy over seal, raisin' up my fifth wheel (wheel). And I don't give a damn how these other niggaz feel (feel). Cause I'm a show skill from the land of the trill (trill). For real, I got a ticket to a meal. I used to try to take a quarter flip it to a bill. Yeah, now I take the clip and stick it to the steal (uh huh). Now take diamond chips and stick it to my grill (blawh). Tall tee, small G this is all me (all me). Lyrically to the fifth degree. I spit it so vividly, ya ears can see. I paint a picture as clear as a DVD (watch nigga). Niggaz sell their soul in this industry. Thats why they ceo's wanna discuss me. Thats why these niggaz change and they discust me. Is these niggaz lame or is it just me. I'm a speak my mind til my tounge has no breath. They say I'm possessed, I say I'm so blessed. Haha, Yellow stones on my neck. Stones yellow as a yellow bones tone in the flesh. If the roof on fire no need to second guess. I burn down buildings, like David Coresh. Yes, and if you think you the best. This dude is next, now move to the left (slide over nigga). Niggaz pray and say, I'm loosin' a step. But I'll call the shots just like booin' the reff (I'm holdin' the whistle nigga). Yeah nigga, what you expect. We got our own set, we write our own cheques. The chain look like a choker when it's hangin' round my neck. Cause the chest poked out, like I'm flexin my pecks. When I spit a flow, I show much finesse. I'm best at my worst, worst at best. You could be in the booth all day, I'll behind the desk. You could be out in the open, I'll be behind the vest. A lot of niggaz be talkin' but only half of 'em hard. Soon as they tapped in the jaw, then they be askin' for God. [Chamillionaire]. Yeah, it's a fact the whole city's behind us. It's a fact the whole city's behind us. Northside, Eastside, Westside, Southside (southside). So y'all step to the side, ha"

I'll be damned if I get jacked with a strap, under my blue nit. Don't do nothing foolish, cause I'll completely lose it. Give a nigga a new breathing hole, with a pool stick. I got hoes square rooted, doubles and cubics. They come in groups of two or mo', and they be wanting do it. Got females that do lick, and some that strictly do dick. But if you freaky prove it, I'll go get the cool whip. If you love your shirt so much, that you don't wan' remove it. Then you can get up out my party, you can get excluded.

Left too bad, your homie had already left too. Can't take you home look at your feet, and now she right and left too. Who's next to, let Koopa undress you and sex you. Can't get you pregnant, condom packs go in and get two. We can chop it up like O. G. Ron C, and Mike Watts do. Or treat you like some Southern music, and make sure you get screwed. [Hook.

If you would have listened when I taught you that. Then you mental midgets would have made the stacks. Just admit it, you were born a hater. If you're tryna say that I shouldn't have it. I'm ridin' spokes and if you're not a broke. And not takin' notes then get a basic tablet. Got her sittin' on special fabric. She lookin' like she just left a pageant. She in the whip inspectin' gadgets. While you watchin' us like Inspector Gadget. Don't hold your breath, because I know you're waitin'. The city's somethin' I'm overtakin'.

Your movement look like a *screeeech*. They callin me. Come back to the streets. (Keep sayin my name). They callin me, they callin me. (Keep sayin my name). They callin me. (Keep sayin my name). Come back to the streets. You should worry bout you while you worry bout me. At the top of the charts is where you know that I'll be. I got the streets on lock and I'm insertin my key. Come back to the streets (x2). [Verse 2]. Yea, the life I live is just like a movie. Every corporation, they tryna sue me. Phony people be tryna glue me. Till they side they try stick it to me. Lucky for me I got the tooley. Not black and decker but its black I bet ya. Stay in the streets, do that for pleasure. So much paper they ask to measure. When the ruler or stackin moula. Is speakin to ya don't interrupt. Middle finga up on the ceiling. Somebody gon eff you up. Don't let the black tux fool ya cuz I am not the one. I come out the suit like Clark Kent to make sure your done. Rappers aint real, rappers they fakers and frontas. They caucasian in the winter then turn Jamaican in the summer. Flippin with Pitman and Straw you know they aint just some gunnaz. Personal trainers thatll brang a couple thangs and make you a runner. Gotta like the producers that made this track. The producers who made ya stacks. Some of you losers need ta face the facts. Put up the duece the ace is back. Take out the rappers you think are whack. Put Chamillitary in place of that. Watch how I erase em and take the plaques. Then I unloosen a case of *gunshot*. By Jamun*"

Offer something but I wouldn't let em get a drink free. Frankly, if you ain't me then you should thank me. For having the heat on me and not taking it offa safety. Dopest, pretty focused car verocious. Put your glass up because I think I gotta toast this. Notice if she bad then I'm a poke this. Then I'm a disappeaar like you put pocus after hocus. Yo sis, looking gangsta but I don't chase her. Even if she drunk from sippin gin without a chaser. Take her, and replace her or probably make her. Clean the crib up she gotta sweep it like the lakers"

don't hurt 'em hammer,"I keep it all the way honest with you. I just be spitting a lot of those punch lines because. A lot of people tell me that's what they want to hear. And me, honestly I feel like I grew out of it. I honestly don't even like rap like I used to. You know? It's real easy to spit 160 bars about nothing. Uh, uh, uh. Don't hurt 'em Hammer. Uh, uh, uh. Don't hurt 'em Hammer. [Repeat x8]. Let's get it, let's get it. Don't hurt 'em Hammer. [Hook 1]. Told y'all, not with the gimmicks, I keep it so raw. Hold y'all, under contemporaries, I blow ya nose off. Most y'all, rappers be making me want to dose off. That's why I raised the bar just like the game of pole vault. Hold up, look at the game and appreciate it. Stop hating on all the artists, while albums even get rated. Tell you to be creative, and as soon as you be creative. The same people that say it don't like it, they like ""I hate it"". They make a club song and the minute you do the same. The same people that said it, will say ""You in need of change"". The music is getting lame, the people in it the same. The house, the car, the strip, are the only thing in the frame. [Hook 2]. Told y'all, not with the gimmicks, I keep it so raw. Blow y'all, out of the box with a flow that go off. Money and fame done cost me a bunch of road dogs. Gotta keep that, iron near me but it ain't no golf. Looking it at the TV, I can't believe I'm hearing it. I can't understand ya, it's just like your speaking Arabic. In love with rap, so I made the mistake and married it. Now I'm feeling like, get away from me, you embarrassing. iTunes downloads and ringtones tearing it. Into smithereens, if you loving music then cherish it. Listening to music that's older than what my parents is. So beautiful like a model think her appearance is. [Hook 3]. Told y'all, not with the gimmicks, I keep it so raw. Hold up, listen to Lil Weezy and Hova. Most of, rappers be having funny aromas. Know a, player gon' get it like I'm supposed ta. [Repeat x8]. Let's get it, let's get it. Don't hurt 'em Hammer. I know I ain't gonna be a rapper forever. And not because I think I'ma fall off or anything. It's because, I just don't feel rap I used to man. I remember I used to just wake up in the morning. And I used to look at my pad, and it was empty. And I would fill it up with nothing but lyrics. You know what I'm saying? I know a lot of people talk. Like they don't write down their lyrics and they do it all in their head. But me, hey I take pride in writing down lyrics man. I used to scratch out everything on the paper. And change the whole rap, up until I felt it was perfect. I used to perfect my craft so much and just make each rap. Be the best one that I could possibly make it. And I try so hard to, you know. To get back to that feeling I used to have, but I just can't you know. I look at a piece of paper now and it just doesn't give me that same feeling it used to. No matter how hard I try, people say that the industry will burn you like that. And they say it's mainly because of the pressures in the record industry but. I don't know man, I don't know what it is but I just know. The same feeling I used to get from music, I just don't get anymore like. I remember the feeling I used to get when I heard them live instruments on Snoop Dogg's Gin & Juice. Or you know when 'Pac was going off on everyone in the industry or. Or when Scarface and 2Pac did a song for the first time. Or the first time I heard UGK's One Day. I was like ""Maan"", them boys real. Or even when I was bumping that east coast music. And I heard Canibus say a verse on The Firm album, he was like. ""At a thousand degrees Celsius I make y'all iggans melt. F' my record label, I appear courtesy of myself! "". I was like ""Maan"" hahaha, man that boy killed dat. And I even used to be bumping Wu-Tang Clan. I remember Method Man was like, you know it um. ""I came to bring the pain, hard core from the brain"". I was like ""Man them boy's throwed"". And I can't put the blame on nobody. You know I can't just say I don't like music all music. There's a lot of music I like, but I just don't like it the way I used to. And that goes for all of it, including me. Even when I'm in the studio, and I'm behind the mic. It just ain't the same man, you know. I like to talk man, that's the realest part of everything to me. But I don't get to speak what's on my mind like I am now. Like I do at the awards, you know?. I mean I guess life goes on though. Don't hurt 'em Hammer!"
don't shoot,"(VERSE 1). I know the governments working. Have you never seen them in person. Do you really think that you're the only person. that sees the sites that you're searching.

So bad you'll have to ask for a doctor that's truth. Youngin in the streets trying to move a brick. He don't really care if your crew can spit. He got the hammer on his hop feeling too legit. trappin on fire they like it they copy. And they all they want is Versace Versace. he's after that cream and he's only 16. but his choppy is cocky and stocky as rocky. Don't shoot. (Hook 1). No need to tell me who's popping. Can't you see the drones in the Sky. I'm like do you think that they watching. I really try to keep to myself. but keep getting caught up in all the hype. I hope the verses y'all made for Kendrick. bring our economy back to life, if they do, don't shoot. Really that'd be great, don't shoot. Really that'd be great, don't shoot,. don't shoot, don't shoot cuz missiles only say kaboom. (VERSE 2). He graduated up to moving packs. His homie showed him how to package right. Ironically he's never grabbed a mic. but they be calling everybody rappers right. His family rich but he be acting. like he wanna leave it all to live the ratchet life. You acting like they wanna sacrifice they whole life. cuz you believe the rapper hype. Impressin who Does this even equal Success to you. If it do. Are you a vegetable, are you an idiot or intellectual. I seen many people and many G's. that's did plenty crimes that they would never do. And Your favorite rapper ain't streets. he at a nice hotel or at a festival. Stop watching wcw cuz real life is something like MMA. see they complain about NSA. but they snitching on themselves every day. You got Youfooles Snitgram they got Crimelines. and Face Crooks. Posting pictures from the trap house. to show they hustle harder than an Ace hook. And that's truth. HOOK. C'mon can't you see the Feds watching. Do you think that your call logs. are the only thing that they're clocking. I really try to keep to myself but keep getting caught up. in all the hype. I hope the Feds don't kick down ya door. with them weapons out have y'all sounding. like don't shoot, don't shoot, don't get blown away,. don't shoot, don't get blown away, don't shoot,. don't shoot, don't shoot cuz missiles only say kaboom. (BRIDGE). Hope ya favorite trapper drops a cd that'll save ya. Hope ya favorite rapper isn't still on tour in Asia. Hope your favorite actor turns into the teminator. Better hide right now when they shoot. (VERSE 3). I coulda been the one I coulda been Trayvon. I stay hungry plus I got an appetite. He had a skittles and a snapple right. Well really that's what's made me wanna snap tonight. An angry rapper I'm acting like. You know I'm really ain't the actin' type. I'm really like if that was one of mine. he'd be apologizing in the afterlife. It isn't black or white its its really wack or right. I know the raps I write be sounding so hipocritocal. But the candy's really soaked in a mineral. so you can tell a critic he can choke on a gental. I wasn't taking it from no idividual. kept the convo wit five 0 to minimal. They try to tell him that they know. he a criminal but I'm the one to tell him let em know. you a general. Hard to say they can't stay armed. Wit goerge zimmermans that got their guns. kinda hard to tell em just pray son. When he feeling like he getting preyed on. so I think we need a liaison. They all saw what happened to Trayvon. And if you bomb and then they bomb. Who the hell are we to say they wrong. Don't shoot. (HOOK). Mr President were all watching. Can't you you see they got army guns. and these windy city kids dropping. I really try keep to myself but keep getting caught up. in all the hype. You really think a new law for guns. gonna erase the ones that they got the night that they shoot. Don't shoot don't shoot. Don't shoot don't shoot. Don't shoot because missiles only say kaboom, kaboom. (VERSE 4). Nothing really giving you a New feeling. Nothing's really giving me a new feeling. Wikileaks in the roof we dont need a damn. fix we just need ceiling. Oh kill Oh kill em. Yea I said it but I didn't mean it. I didn't think the gov would try to turn us to the new villains. the other day my mother say. she had a dream that the president. would take us to a World war. I heard somebody else say. when it does happen then hopefully theyll put it up on World star. Murda Zimmerman hopped in his car a served off. Murda crazy how the world will hit you with a curve ball"

e.i,"e.i.. . [Chamillionaire]. All the hoes up in the club get in free before 10. They rather pay 10 to see if the Chamillion's goin in. Fa'sho then. Me and Lester Boy gon' buy out the bar. While ya eyes is on my car, I got my eyes on ya braud. I'm not classy, grab on ya ass when ya pass me. And have the nerve to say I didn't do it when ya asked me. Nasty, call me what you want except broke. 'cause soon as you do, they gon' be like this nigga got jokes. Ha-Ha, have you see where the Chamillionaire stay?. Have you seen what the neon lights up in the trunk say?. Truck stay sittin' low, and the screens in the truck play. I get more green then a vegetarian buffet. I get more bank then a NBA back board. Stack yours while we slam black Cadillac doors. 2 Tellies watchin' Nelly, and 3 Tellies showin' Belly. Big ballin like some meat-balls in a damn deli. Callin' Sam on my celly. When she tellin' me she ready to come braid my hair-my hair like R.Kelly. Could tell niggaz I cut hair, they be like ""So what?"". Bite ya chilli-bowl with my ice-grill and give ya ass a cold-cut. Get it? and even if ya don't then forget it. Just remember when my album hit the stores to go and get it. I'm twistin' my wrist and I'm sparklin' and glistenin'. Shh!, listen and you can hear the ladies just whisperin'. Lookin' like I was up in the North Pole and I was fishin'. Seen some ice water and stuck my whole fist in. Messin' up your vision, when the twinkies be twistin'. I feel pain, when I grip grain but I ain't trippin'. If I'm not hittin' licks with Lil' Yo up in the bricks. Then I'm hoppin' up in the 6, might pop me a lil crist'. I cannot, give you a kiss, leave ya lips and ya tongue frozen. My whole mouth golden, gotta porno star posin'. On the back of my album cover, if I discover. That'll hot girl is not a hot girl, then I'll just shove her. 'cause I'ma guerilla out the gutta, I'm so sick mayne. I pull up on chrome and I watch a nigga lip hang. If Miss Thang, actin' like she really Miss Thang. Won't see me spit game, unless she gotta thick frame. Look mayne, ain't nothin' the Chamillionaire can't get. I'm ballin' like Bill Gates gave me a blank check. My paint wet, might leave a happy-hater upset. Ice on my neck drippin' down my back and got my butt wet. What you thought, the Chamillionaire wasn't throwed or somethin?. I be rollin' on buttons, and got em' sayin' ""He shol' be stuntin'"". Nigga get ya mind correct, the house is the ish. Everybody flash ya wrist and let ya diamond glist"
eatin',"[Intro]. OOh, that's right. OOh, that's right. Ain't no captain saving, can't save 'em, so no need to be playa hating. OOh, that's right. [Verse 1]. So many cars, too many keys, I think I need a whole locker. Said to get to me, she'll sleep with you, I ain't never met a ho like her. From overseas, speak Portuguese, she be speaking English so proper. I pull the cover up off the plate and I swear it's looking like lobster. I'm making orders, not taking orders, I was never good at cooperating. I'm too Kurupt, I Snoop Dogg, I Nate Dogg and I Dr. Dre 'em. That money talk, well what it say? I'll let you know and this is all verbatim. ""Get the hoes to come to your shows, but don't give them dough and try not to date them"". Look in my safe, no dough was missing, she want a cut, get no incision. I'm starting up a new coalition of bosses that don't need no permission. Not just the president, I'm a client. I'm 5' 11"", act like a giant. Hop in the yacht and laid in the sun, the sun got me looking like I'm Hawaiian. Grab passport, let's fast-forward and take a seat in my villa. Got TVs that pop out the wall like Michael Jackson in Thriller. Might do my thang if I let her hang, but she's got to know I can't be with her. I told the girl if she want a Romeo then she better go and find P. Miller. [Hook]. Your Whip stays on big blades, these groupies talking 'bout freaking. These chicks ain't gon' get saved, cause you ain't really no deacon. Live Monday through Friday, like everyday's the weekend. Your car paid and your rent paid, then you can say that you're eating. Look at me, eating, eating. OOh, that's right. Pretty women and nice cars, so every night is a wonderful night. Look at me, eating, eating. OOh, that's right. Grind hard so I shine hard, yeah I'll be a playa for life. Ain't no captain saving, can't save 'em, so no need to be playa hating. OOh, that's right. You got a girl you really love, don't stand there, go cuff her playa. She can't stay here cause the same room ain't something that a sucka shares. We eating good with no tupperwear, play with my paper, I double dare. I give your girl a trip across the world and leave her in Dubai in her underwear. Psych. I would never do your girl like, that. I be tapping on her curves like, smack. If I took her all across the world, she'll probably tell me that she don't want her life, back. And I've never been an undertaker, and plus I ain't tryn'a be the one to take her. So much time spent overseas, the rude girl probably thought I was from Jamaica. Can't take sand to the beach though, my macking game is so lethal. I grip the tool and that wood like I just made a stop at Home Depot. That's yo girl? She's all mine. That's so foul, two free throws. That's my fault, that's my bad. You're all done, finito. And she's showing her anatomy. Wheel of Fortune, She can have the D. Every day got her feeling like a fantasy. Got your girlfriend wishing that her man was me. Ay, feeling like you should have stayed in. Be getting money all day but the money don't exchange hands. Can't see through my Ray Bans. If you're tryn'a play me then you never had a chance. [Hook]. [Outro]. OOh, that's right. OOh, that's right. Ain't no captain saving, can't save 'em, so no need to be playa hating. OOh, that's right. Grind hard so I shine hard, yeah, I'll be a playa for life"
elevate,"[Verse 1]. Well, it's beginning to look a lot like y'all, follow my every step. Take notes on how I rep, what else would you expect?. Oh yes, they say that money talks in these streets. If money talks, then who say the most and who say the least?. Speak, that's if you can and if you can't choke. Ironically, the ones who can't the ones who ain't close. They tell me this how the city really supposed to feel. Tattoo my name in your checkbook, that'll let me know it's real. Listen, hating is a decision. I normally stay in the cut but some people hate the incision. Tell you 'bout that suspicion, I ain't getting commission. And tell you how well and different they do it in my position. Aborted mission, you shoulda coulda woulda did that. If it's 15 minutes of fame, where yo minutes is at?. What have you ever done? What have you ever did?. It's rhetorical, don't answer that, cause you know what it is. [Hook]. When you're moving on up and everybody wanna roll. They say they love me but I can never be sure. So you know, you know. I elevate on these hoes. Elevate on these hoes. They can talk down about me everywhere they go. But they don't say it when they see me in the streets though. So you know, you know. I elevate on these hoes. Elevate on these hoes. [Verse 2]. They'll tell you your fate I said you can't win. What good's a hustle when your mentality caged in?. I pull up on 'em, park it right up on the pavement. Step out and look and be stuck in my own amazement. And that feeling still ain't fulfilling. Millions on top of millions, you gon' become the villain. You see this one-room apartment where we was living?. This why I'm claustrophobic and riding without the ceiling. Guess who calling my number, sitting in her pajamas. Feeling like it's a bummer that I ain't give her the lumber. Tapping that like a drummer, turning her to a cummer. Instead I'm somewhere in winter that's feeling like it's the summer. Hold up, the garage as big as the court. How you learn how to ball and not even get in the sport?. Decorated the grill, made it look like an ESPY. But you can't see the front when you in the rear trying to catch me. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. See I came up on that Scarface and I came up on that 'Kast. That Pimp C and that Bun B the professors of my class. When a major deal had came through, who came up on one last. Same person that taught you how to come up on that cash. They say that flattery's what you get from an imitator. Gave birth to all my haters, I shouldn't have paid for your labor. When you turn to the savior, they never ask for a favor. Watch people that never gave you a favor act like they made ya. But I gotta get mine, get, get in the rotation. Gots to stay trill, never been a imitation. Never stop mine, cause they come with complications. Broke them boys off, caught 'em with intimidation. Look in my eyes, try to tell me what you're facing. Out the north side, it's a legend in the making. Watch where I slide in the elevator though. Elevate on these hoes. Elevate on these hoes"
emotional,"[Hook]. Your man was such a lame, girl, that's how I got close to you. You know it's true, you know it's true. Please don't say no names girl, just do what you're supposed to do. Emotional, emotional girl. You know you got a man girl, he don't even know you. Been with me the whole night, sweating up the whole room. Just do what I say girl, everything will go smooth. And you know that he'll be home soon. Can't never let a groupie get too close to you. They always get a little too emotional. Always get a little too emotional, emotional, emotional. You know that you should do it like you're supposed to do. You know that you should do it like you're supposed to do. You know that you should do it like you're supposed to do. You know you do, you know you do. [Verse 1]. Thought last night would be the end of that. Thought you could tap that then relax. What you thought you could just send it back. And never really knew that she would get attached. Nothing wrong with a little bad behavior. As long as you don't do nothing to agitate you. She just want cake and wanna eat it too. Birthday suit you can have it later. Can't replace her she's permanent. At least she is in her own eyes. Besides you never had much success. When you cut her off the last four times. You know it would be so wise. If you didn't try to tell no lies. Call it lust but she calls it trust. But she popping up, it's like surprise. [Hook]. [Verse 2]. Just stuck in the moment. Laying up in your home and. Time you were supposed to be somewhere else. And I'm realizing who home yet. Got some company on deck. She ain't trying to condone that. She just trying reach out and touch tonight. She ain't trying to have phone sex. Got to see you before the club. Feeling like it's way more than love. You would think that she less than tipsy. But seems to me that she poured enough. Lift it up and then hold it up. Who left lipstick all on that soda cup. She just hope that you noticed love. You know wassup, you know wassup. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. Got caught up in that tangled web. Painted dress and them banging legs. Got caught up in that pretty view. And then realize it became a ledge. Real emotions that came with sex. Plus you stay at that same address. You just had a few steamy nights. And your dirty laundry just made a mess. Clean it up you weren't taught to lose. Pay attention to all the clues. Running through my mind all day. But look at all the mileage she put on your shoes. Wonder where it got all confused. You knew the code but broke all the rules. Awkward moment that quick hit. Type of relationship turned chopped and screwed. You accepted that offer. And trying to say she's no stalker. A mental clip is full of hollow tips. She go'n make you duck and then dodge her. And you kept dodging them calls, huh. Just when you thought that you lost her. She found you quick than OnStar. Now don't try to say I ain't warn ya"
end of a knife,(Hook). They always tell me that im colder than ice. But try ya best to not get caught in the hype. Cuz I could give you back control of your life. Ya Betta handle me wit Caution Caution. You try to mess wit me you gon pay the price. I do my dirt and then im gone in the night. Dont try to tell me that im wrong when im right. Cuz I aint really talkin ya walking into the end of knife. . (VERSE 1). I wasnt really doin much. But chillin in the kitchen. Layin in cut you know playing my position. Watchin the superbowl really thats like tradition. And then thats when I had a vision. What I did to my old girl. Look at it how its dripping of your curls. And if I say any more they probably gone hurl. Ill summarize it by sayin its A cold world a cold world. All I can tell you is I knew id cut her off. you could say it was destined. One day I saw her getting fresh with one of her X men. Thats when I dissappeared and she was definitely stressing. Now shes guessing but I guess that'll teach her a lesson. I been sharp baby and you know your reflection. Will shine like me soon as we make a connection. I'm laughin at whoever told you sex is weapon. Go get some protection it aint gonna help when. She let me get in them guts oops im saying too much. When im stroking its love when im poking its lust. Every time that we touch Its such a beatiful rush. We can turn me to us and together be dangerous. (Hook). They always tell me that im colder than ice. But try ya best to not get caught in the hype. Cuz I could give you back control of your life. Ya Betta handle me wit Caution Caution. You try to mess wit me you gon pay the price. I do my dirt and then im gone in the night. Dont try to tell me that im wrong when im right. Cuz I aint really talkin ya walking into the end of knife. (VERSE 2). I wasnt really doing much. But chillin in the kitchen. Layin in cut you know playing my position. Choppin up w the homie about to make me some fixin's. Lend me your ear its time to listen. Cuz now ive got roommate. A lazy roomate that always showed up at school late. An athlete and his temper too great. Hes normally cool but sometimes. he's such a 2 face and too fake. Pay attention I was on my protein and my oatmeal thing. My eating healthy got me feeling so real thing. Heard a knock another knock then heard the doorbell ring. A beauty queen damn I have a chance to get clean. Look how she walked noticed her pretty skin. Minimal mascara devilish little grin. I didn't know what to say didnt know where to begin. She wasn't here for me and she only came here for him. Was dressed like she recently just got out church. She pulled some purple evidence up out of her purse. Another womans underwear you know what's worse. Is its the same girl I mentioned in the first verse. And then she cursed at my patna yelling bout what she saw. Asking him bout some lingerie that she found in her car. I sitting back watchin and just trying not to get involved. Thats when I heard her say that she was ready to break the law. A tricky satiuation I was currentky facing. The roomate or ya soulmate which side taking. I wasn't saying nothing I watching and waiting. She yelling and pacing and now shes adjacent. To me and I was there standing quietly. He started yelling when she tried to get behind me. Then up his dukes like he thought he was Ali. You swing at me thell have to hook you to an IV. Naw matter fact you better say you know karate. Ya family gonna have to come and get ya body. Before you try me you better find a hobby. Or betta go find a job like Martin said to Tommy. Im not the type that you should ever try to get close to. Matter fact you should run you ever see me approach you. And now this loser talking like he trying to get vocal. Im like dont you have me in here bout to go postal. Ohh say it again then you gon say a prayer. Im gon send you to heaven and you can say it up there. This aint a dare its promise and ill say I swear. I don't care I bet that you wont say I'm scared. . (Hook). They always tell me that im colder than ice. But try ya best to not get caught in the hype. Cuz I could give you back control of your life. Ya Betta handle me wit Caution Caution. You try to mess wit me you gon pay the price. I do my dirt and then im gone in the night. Dont try to tell me that im wrong when im right. Cuz I aint really talkin ya walking into the end of knife. (VERSE 3). I was really doing much. Now I know hes wishing. I wasnt in the cut. He gon need some stitching. I didnt wanna do it. Told you you wouldnt listen. She the one who gave me the permission. I knew that it was evil but it made me feel dope. The way she got me feeling I think we should elope. She reached around my body then she pulled me real close. Then she rubbed me on the face and said its time to get ghost. Your wish is my command you rollin im rolling wit ya. If you say its time to split don't worry I get I picture. She grabbed me by the wrist If I could I would kiss ya. In all the chaos I didnt get to tell you I miss ya. I was thinking bout the cut Like my mind was missing. Sitting in the car You know playing my position. She drove up to a cliff and Wait hold up Wait. She said somebodies going fishing Hold up. But I just ended a life. This how were ending the night. Oh well you wasn't even my type. Wait is the end of the knife

fast lane (freemix) (feat. bad meets evil),"[Royce Da 5'9""]. First verse, uh, I'm on 'til I'm on a island. My life's ridin' on the autobahn on autopilot. Before I touch dirt, I'll kill y'all with kindness. I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse. You've been warned if you've been born or if you can form. Slap up a cop and then snatch 'em outta his uniform. Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on. And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn. Y'all niggas's intellect mad slow, y'all fags know. Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'. Bet you could light your own cigarette with ya asshole. Me and Shady deaded the past. so that basically resurrected my cashflow. I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke. though I ain't wrapped tight. My blood type's the '80s, my '90s was like the Navy. You was like the Bradys, you still fly kites daily. [Eminem]. Catch me in my Mercedes. [Chamillionaire]. wait, let me interrupt you Shady. They thought I couldn't drag the loot, but. Y'all must be crazy. Bullets in my. 380. I keep a bunch like the Bradys. Have everyone dodging shots like Anderson. Cooper out in Haiti. They all be Wolf Blitzer. And I put in a full clip and you stay in the full trip. And you run and the fool flip. I'm MJ, I don't do. Pippen, I'm lyrically too sick. Wait till you're gone. And drop a bomb on your car like a stool pidgeon. I'm with your girl in your auto. I'm letting her work my throttle. I think I just spilled a bottle of Moscato. Inside your Tahoe. Your girl is singing bravado. She think she Nelly Furtado, I keep on telling her. ""Bravo! "" Yeah, that's the Stephanie I know. [Eminem]. Catch me in my Mercedes bumpin' Ice Ice Baby. Screamin' Shady 'til I die, like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy. So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze. And you only live it once. so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady. Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll. danish, let me tell you. What this pretty little dame's name is. cause she's kinda famous. And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this. Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus!. You morons think that I'm a genius. Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum cleanin'. Try them trailer parks, crazy. I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby. And that's back with a capital B with an exclamation mark. Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics. Cause I'mma rip this mystical slick shit. You don't wanna become another victim. or statistic of this shit, cause after. I spit the bullets, I'mma treat these shell. casings like a soccer ball. I'mma kick the ballistics, so get this dick, I'mma live this. [Hook - Chamillionaire]. I'm living life in the fast lane. If y'all didn't know my name then I bet you know now. I don't really give a damn what y'all think. I'm just tryna get this change and make my city so proud. All I know is I'm tryna get it so I get in the ride. Drop the top on my drop and ride through the night. I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal). I'm just tryna do my damn thing (Pedal to the metal). [Chamillionaire]. Hey Royce I'm sorry for stealing. but I had to make an adjustment. That production's so rushed. they give it a Texas concussion. It's like the game of Duck Hunt. when they see the heat that I'm tucking. Soon as they see that I'm squeezing. That's when I see that they're ducking. It ain't no hey or Wassupin. when I throw my fist through your dental. Cause I be charging the month. like the card that got incidentals. I'm a a millitant mind reader. I'm sawin right through your mental. Got a saw I purchased on rental. Got em sawin right through the middle. You little peons get peed on, cd what I'm a skeet on. Your thong is neon as Deion. Gotta dick so big you could ski on. Tip of my penis I'm meanest. Sometimes I think I'm Arenas. I bring my strap in arenas. This metal detectors a genius. [Royce Da 5'9""]. Yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit. At war with a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs. My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins. I made a pact with the Devil that says ""I'll let you take me. You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpes. Jack Kevorkian"". Go back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in. I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down. my tenement, too many now. To send my serenity powers, spin 'em around. enterin' in the vicinity. [Eminem]. Now, was called M&M. but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper. Chewed him up... and spitted him out, girl giddy-up. now get-get down. He's lookin' around this club. and it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now. Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town. Did I s-s-stutter, mothafucka? Fuck them all, he shuts. A whole mothafuckin' Walmart d-d-down. every time he comes a-r-r-round. And he came to the club tonight. with 5'9"" to hold this bitch down. Like a mothafuckin' chick underwater, he tryna d-d-drown. Shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated. just by the way. That you keep lickin' them dick-sucking lips. I'm agitated, aggravated. To the point you don't suck my dick. then you're gonna get decapitated. Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head. then I'm have to take it. [Royce]. And then after takin' that, I'mma catch a case. It's gon' be fascinatin'. It's gon' say. ""The whole rap game passed away"" on top of the affadavit. Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator. To Michael Jackson' activator, meanin' I'm on fire off the top. Might wanna back up the data, runnin' over hip hop. In a verbal tractor trailer, homie this sick. you can normally ask a hater. Don't it make sense, these shell. casings is just like a bag of paper. Drop in the lap of a tax evader, homie they spent. [Eminem]. Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes, what girl. I'm the crack-a-lator, percolator to this party. be my penis ejaculator later. Tell you boyfriend that you just struck paydirt. You rollin' with a player. you won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin'. [Hook - Chamillionaire]. I'm living life in the fast lane. If y'all didn't know my name then I bet you know now. I don't really give a damn what y'all think.

First they look at the piece then they look at the rang. I'm fly as a pelican, Ice on my skeleton. On a sunday morning, I stay sharper than a reverend. Candy on my doors, looking something like gelatin. Syrup in my cup but I ain't talking about medicine. I'm cold as an eskimo, throwed from my head to toe. The white tee fresh but it starts in my denims though. Yeah and if I pull down my fly, I could piss on the sky. Cause nigga I'm that high. I pulled up in heaven up in the candy painted ride.

I'm show ya how to rep the city, correctly run the game. Grip tightly on the grain, turn it left and we call it swang. Let me show ya how to make the baddest ladies scream your name. I'll put that boy J Junior in the future in a body bag. I'm trying to quote that bad body like a boxing bag. Trying to get below the belt and beat it like a boxing jab. Hit it then I quit it like I dropped out of a boxing class. Know how we doing it, we been chopped and screwing it. Coming to get that number one spot you got like Ludacris. We ain't acting groupie-ish, taking a sip out Luda's Cris. We buy our own bottles, grab one and put it to your lips. Hating on your hood, throw your hood up, put it in his face. Repping Texas, got that real estate down in that realest state. Didn't need a bigger place, didn't need a bigger face. On my watch but forgot and went a got them both a place"
from the south (feat. z-ro & lil' flip),"[Hook. From the South. I got the diamonds in my mouth. [Z-Ro]. Hold up a minute, I'm the King of the Ghetto. Holding the rap game, like wood grain can't let go. You niggaz'll never see me, I'm on another level. Stay ready to dig a grave, keep a gun and a shovel. And pouring gas too, if there evidence. Saw me in the rear view, now you wonder where I went. I'ma get you if I owe ya, visit ya residence. Lay the merk game down, and then I'ma hit the fence. Better keep my mouth closed, so they can't see the shining. They think it was Z-Ro, cause all they seen was diamonds. I'm cold as a deep freeze, with bags of ice in it.

Still ride around the city, with none of my niggaz with me. Still ride for H-Town, if don't none of these niggaz feel me. Ain't gotta like me, or have none of these niggaz hit me. I'ma be the MVP, if don't none of these niggaz pick me. A lot of rumors in the streets, ain't none of it really pretty. Getting money, makes all of the drama seem itty-bitty. Pick a click, I don't hang with none of these niggaz really. But I'm glad that the majors. is running up in the city cause I'm. [Hook. From the South. I got the diamonds in my mouth. [Lil' Flip]. Ever since 1999, I had diamonds in my grill. You just rapping that ain't platinum, homie you need to chill. Cause you embarrassing Texas, nigga you ain't trill. Nigga you been on my dick, way befo' you got your deal. These rappers finally get some fame. and think they got it locked. After your album flop, nigga you gon be on Koch.

Cause you fellas ain't shining at all, check me out. On the first and fifteenth, I'm some'ing like a pimp. Even with a suspended license, still finna flip. Ain't no limit to this cash, ain't nothing I can't get. Five deuce Hoover cause, ain't nothing like a Crip. Ride with a Revolve', I don't fuck with clips. These roach ass niggaz, trying to make me bust my chips. But I'm not a bank, I don't even trust my bitch. I'm from the South, and I got diamonds in my mouth. [Hook"

gimmick rappers,"(*talking*). That's what it is, ""The Sound of Revenge"". Summer 2005 nigga, whoo. [Chamillionaire]. Gimmick rappers, can't lie forever. But as long as I'm here, gimmick rappers gon die together. Told lil' mama I love drama, no one tried to tell her. She shoulda left the club, instead of trying to find a fella. The villain's born, dark storms that's my kind of weather. Sending gimmick niggaz to the mall, to go buy umbrellas. Like Eminem was telling them, that they should die it yella. Some of my fans they look like Cham, but say I am better. Picture the though of that, since no one spit a harder rap. I told 'em that I'm Jehova's lil' brother, the God of rap. Don't play me like you a atheist, face it it's more fact. Gimmick rappers have heart attacks, when you tell 'em that God is back. The problem is more than that, like Iraq when the gats in em. You diss me you gon be done, like a snack when the rats get em. After the baptism, the black in the black hit em. No need for that gat, cause fact is the raps kill em. Live your life like a mockery, niggaz will see the prophecy. Stare at a flight of stairs, 'fore you ever think you on top of me. Nigga how could you possibly, think that you could be stopping me. Destiny couldn't stop me, I move and that hoe be watching me. Fans are no longer crying to see, Jay-Z throw up the dynasty. Not big as that nigga Jigga, but nigga tell 'em it's time for me. Rap game is dying to me, I'm the rapper they trying to see. I could bring it back, not only force-ably but violently. Ladies and gentlemen, introducing from Houston. The truth and I'm in the booth, and your truth is a big illusion. What you choosing if you're choosing, to jump into the confusion. You losing and end up choosing, and cruise it into a bruising nigga. (*talking*). I'm peeping out here in these streets, and I see these old. Record labels trying to advance, trying to drop old material. On a nigga, so instead of Controversy Sells we gon switch it up. Summer 2005, ""The Sound of Revenge"". [Chamillionaire]. Then they said on the radio, I ain't beefing with rappers no mo'. But tell 'em to go correct it, cause rappers be acting homo. Came in and screaming duo, I'm leaving and screaming solo. Disrespecting the logo's a no-no, I'll leave you rojo. Hey that's red in Spanish, real niggaz'll never vanish. We rise up and then we ride up on haters, prepare to panic. Put ya teflon on, you better go get it plant it. Rip off your chest piece, to make niggaz remember Janet. Ay log on the net, type in ""the villain"" and search. And realize why gimmick rappers is hurt, cause the truth hurts. And you jerks (you jerks) , is a package of skirts. Put your little advance, back in your purse ha-ha. That nigga say he don't like me, he acting like he a wifey. Ain't held a pistol, acting like he the type that'll snipe me. You don't like me invite me, you don't like me come fight me. And if you can't afford the flight, and you don't like me then write me. I ain't concerned, with any of your concerns. I'm trying to stack, plack on top of plack like gum germs. I got enough tongue twisters, to make the tongue turn. Make the sun burn, I'm so hot I could give it sun burn. So call up, Kay Slay and ask him who is. The trillest to spit it, then call up DJ Whoo-Kid. DJ Drama, Vlad Green, Lantern and Kool-Kid. Tell 'em it's time to switch they playlist up, with the new kid. What's his name, Chamillitary mayne. (*talking*). Yeah, the hardest rap nigga and if you beg to differ. Step to the mic, and spit some'ing sicker nigga. Ha-ha, Chamillitary mayne"

Step back and hit that switch, it's like, there's no blocking my J, dawg. Got diamonds in my [?] chain, celly going ""rang rang"". Look down inside my dough make sure I've got my Kirko Bang Bang. And I ain't talking 'bout car bass. See how fast your heart race. And I keep it ghetto boy, but please don't end up with a scar-face. I twist in that little key, and then start my car up. Before noon, I flip mode, then registers at Starbucks. Don't talk much, I talk math, don't subtract, let's add. Gold Roley and [?] , your accessories [?]. Go count ones, then check twice, just get it right, don't guess though. I hope the money ain't short dawg, cause I never settle for less ho. A big salute to my congregation, we get dollars no [?].

go grind (feat. paul wall),"[Chamillionaire]. Listen. They say rapping's a waste of knowledge. ""Take ya ass to college"". Now they broke ass call us. Tryin to ask for dollars. Sittin behing glass Impala's. High class Impala's. I make two cash deposits everytime I pass the closet. If niggas lookin for the grands. The grands can be spotted. Chamillions the man. He got it in his hand of wallet. Ain't no If's, And's, about it. ""That man's the hottest"". I accedently spent five grand. Cause man, we ballas. We don't shop at Family Dollars. If your ice is fake?. If you ask me for a verse. I make my price inflate. We still ghetto, lookin for some metal mics to break. I'm still hangin around a hood, like a liscense plate. I'm not cappin, cause trust me. You'll know when I'm cappin. When I pull out that gat. And you hear that thang click-clackin. You hear what that boy said?. Don't be a hard head. Save me some left overs im through with some raw bread. [Chorus]. Let's open, the garage and pull, Them cars out (Why?). Show em how boys in the dirty south shiine. (Money is on your mind, chasin them dollar signs. Get off of youe behind and go Grind). Yeaah. there's no time, to sleep - we hustle and grind, all the time. Because money's always on our miind. (Chasin them dollar signs, you sayin you wanna shine?. Then get up off of your behind and go Grind). Yeaah. [Paul Wall]. They say stuntin's a waste of money. ""Man, invest it in stocks"". Now they homeless and out of work. Ever since Enron flopped. Have a hustle for every season. That's the Babeoulous way. Mo money underneath my mattress. Then you have in your safe. When money slow up? Make a different hustle blow up. Alotta cats older then me, but they ain't never grow up. Boys hit a couple of licks, buy some kicks and they quit. I ain't hustlin for a fifth, I'm on the grind to get rich. I ain't gone lie, I got lazy making fifty a week. But when that fifty sunk to ten I woke up out of my sleep. I don't compete with other ballers. I inspire myself. Self-Emplyed, I could write a check. And hire myself. I admire myself, with a set of Slabs, salute. All courtisey of my underground, mass of loot. It don't matter what it cost, just grab some loot. I'll earn it back before your class is through. It's goin down. [Chorus]. Let's open, the garage and pull, Them cars out (Why?). Show em how boys in the dirty south shiine. (Money is on your mind, chasin them dollar signs. Get off of youe behind and go Grind). Yeaah. there's no time, to sleep - we hustle and grind, all the time. Because money's always on our miind. (Chasin them dollar signs, you sayin you wanna shine?. Then get up off of your behind and go Grind). Yeaah. [Chamillionaire]. Listen. They say our album just dropped. And we ain't proved a thing. Look at the Sound Scan scannin. Tell us who's the King. Okay, if we don't hit Top 100 on Billboards. We still gone feel joy, 50 hundreds in Bills boy. We Runnin Houston streets, so you can say we RoadRunners. You better hide your deer, like we was Doe Hunters. Never made doe from a dealer, I'm no dope runna. But I intercept chips like a kick from a slow punta. HUT ONE! HUT TWO! - We comin' through, what it do?. Direspecting that Houston, Texas Underground? What a fool. It's okay if you DeeJay's don't give us Radio play. We tell the streets to go get our CD today, they obey. Underground CD sella, Hundred Thousand or betta. But I'm not in this game to get a Grammy letta or metal. Just tryin to make alot of chedda, Mirror Mirror on the wall. Can you tell us who really ball? ""Chamillion and Paul Wall"". [Chorus X2]. Let's open, the garage and pull, Them cars out (Why?). Show em how boys in the dirty south shiine. (Money is on your mind, chasin them dollar signs. Get off of youe behind and go Grind).

I go hard! ""Y'all need to stop actin like you slow"". I go hard!. Ay, I'll go at anyone of you dudes. that used to hang with the click. Who runnin round. makin the threats about how gangster you get. You put your neck on the line, the YOU takin a slip. Do like a chick that won't let me hit and try to stay off my dick. Or I'ma prove that you don't want it with Mufasa, you got the. Warnin it's about to get ugly as Chewbacca. Bout to make me hot as stew pasta, too salsa. Holla in Espanol, cucaracha, tu caca. You see me sittin in it, you can bet that it ain't rented. See the fo'-five infinite Caucasian white tinted. Eyes lookin squinted, they can't tell me that it didn't. Pop eyes, like the ball, white got it like spinach. Chamillitary Mayne, we in the house like tenants. Oh dog, I'm a menace, oh Lord, I'm a dentist. Y'all sound like gimmicks, y'all sound quite finished. And all y'all hang around a bunch of clowns like Grimace. Meanwhile on the other side of town. Plate full of bullets and another side of rounds. I'm too deep, make a pot of a lotta nouns. Spit a verse and every person that you love about to drown. I'm a shark in a bloody game of Marco Polo. Dart flyin through the air to mark your polo. Haters try to tell me they don't heart my logo. Others love it so they hug it with their heart, no homo. You a bozo and I am no clown, I am the town. When I step into public, you know it's goin down. When I step back in the city you already know, it's goin down. That I be overseas gettin them G's fall out please. you know it's goin down. Lil Wayne's song describe my smallest bank account silly. A millie millie, a millie, a millie millie millie. I'm movin in it like Diddy, your city's my city. They try to throw me the kitty, the kitty's like ""gimme"". Didn't drop for a minute, bootleggers told me they need me. Looks like the whole region is ready to BCD me. Clowns in the H tryna act like they wanna see me. I'm poppin up like a genie, they disappear like Houdini. You busters must have snorted that Whitney, I am sick G. Peew, hot, heat seeking missiles be tryna sick me. Wish he, would try to throw it my way and piss me. Off, here's a thought, I make your history a mystery. [Sound of Twilight Zone theme] ... Twilight zone. I'm worth two thousand more than me with my ice on. I'm a butcher with a weapon baby, I knife songs. Mo' murder murder, mo' murder, like I like Bone. The only way that you could ever be hotter than me. Is if I don't put out no music and that spot'll be free. Always grindin, any time I ever spotted a G. I was on point like a decimal, a dot or a P. E-R-I-O-D, no paper out of my reach. Shakin Uncle Sam, I keep a lotta receipts. And nah Cham. ain't never the one to bring no sand to the beach. I put the moula in my hand. and bring grands to the street, yah. Pullin up in the newest ish, you ain't never knew exist. Baby get inside, darling you can smell the newishness. You can see the platinum, see the clearness. and the bluishness. Lookin at my jewellery tryna figure out who my jeweller is. Underground money never disappears. When your mixtape, flow and skill is sick as his. Know its big business, I be on them businesses. You all be actin immature so now I roll with bigger kids. Ridin on 28's, my rims clear a lotta cones. Ridin through the city mayne I hear a lotta clones. Kill a microphone like I'm Killa Kyleon. Bout to change my rap name, (to what?) Killa Clinaclone. I promised that the mic gon' need a mic toe tag. Its still clear, I'm still here and that's despite you're a fag. I left the underground alone and nobody came and took it. Well guess who's back to take it like good lookin. Uh, look in the garage, your cars ain't sick as ours. I done had the doors ajared on plenty cars. I was gettin large while y'all was chillin hard. So the rappers praise the God, (my lord) like synagogue. Just when they thought it was haters win, I'ma hurt 'em all. Just when they thought it was traitors win, I'ma curve the ball. I'm always right but I act like I never heard of wrong. And I know it all like I'm able to give a nerd a call. Clark Kent but I'm sure I can make the shirt come off. Mixtape Messiah 4, its like I'm (click) cocking a burner y'all. ""Get ya burners, get ya burners, here we come again"". You know who the streets waiting to see... me. ""Get ya burners, get ya burners, here we come again"". Mixtape Messiah part fo', let's go. I try to chase the green face like The Wizard of Oz. Took the yellow brick road, two acquisitive cars. Don't wanna hear nothing real?. You should be skipping my parts. My swagger get any higher, I'll be sitting on Mars. I don't post on blogs or chat about what singers gay. I don't switch green names and change up everything I say. I don't let SoundScan allow a lame the right of way. You could sell ten-million and still be not who I'ma play. Car pearly, white as teeth. I guess that you could say I'm flossin. See me and think of green, like Saint Patrick's Day or Boston. I lead and they follow, these rappers guilty of stalkin. The underground was dead but I'm about to leave the coffin"

I know you gon love, how vivid the picture is I paint ya. You feeling like you a realer nigga than me in your heart, ain't ya. I tried to warn him, but I kept getting the cold shoulder. They thinking they flows colder, too late they got rolled over. You Destiny's Child, now ya feeling it no soldier. My nigga ya no Hova, you really got no flow brah. For pumping that plastic crack, out of my trunk. And I jump in when them majors tell me to jump, let it bump. Yeah I'm valedictorian, nigga I'd never flunk. Ashton Kutcher, pussy ass niggaz get punked ha-ha. I was with the House, but I wasn't feeling the vibe. You could interview me, I ain't got nothing to hide transaction denied. I'm a flame-thrower, why do these suckers get fried. When they ask him bout me, he must of replied.... You gotta love me, nigga I swallow my pride. Them records were dissing me, but I let beef slide. I might let you slide, but watch yourself or we gon have to collide. And that's the last warning, then I'll re-ride. [Hook - 4x]. [Rasaq]. Society said I'm a menace, but it isn't cause I'm O-Dog. It's because my froze jaw, got your vision thoed off. Show you how a pro floss, when it comes to the dentist. Before I finish the sentence, they asking how much did them hoes cost. I spit on Paul Wall, cause you know you so soft. Friendly ass teddy bear, step up and get broke off. You a bopper, why you riding niggaz dicks. How you a ""chick magnet"", you no different from a bitch. Hoe sider dick rider, you a Nawf and Southsider. You a dick-sucker partna, open up your mouth wider. We can go toe to toe, one on one with no gun. Put your head in your glass, till you looking at the sun. You use to read the bible, trying to give a nigga hugs. Only punched me from behind, when you jumped me in the club. Not a scratch not a scar, not a cut not a smudge. Nigga use to go to church, now you wanna be a thug. You went from Gulfbank to 4-4, to 5-9 Southlea. Trying to fit in, so you grill and show your mouthpiece. (*talking*). It's Rasaq boy, you know my brother told me to chill out. But you way too fake for all that boy, you know. I see you by yourself, and you ain't trying to do nothing. You know I'm saying, I see ya in the club and you trying to jump me. Know I'm saying ha-ha, with bout five other dudes with your boys or whatever. You know I'm saying, so the funny thang about that is. This fool is only punching me in the back, like a lil' gal or some'ing. You know I'm saying, and you been shooting too many slugs boy I hear you. You know I'm saying so, you ain't shooting no mo' slugs this way. Without taking no charge back, you feel me ha-ha. Now you wanna be a G, now you wanna sip the bar and blow the dro. And you was a grown man in your 20's, wearing Sponge Bob watches from Burger King. I seen you in the Source man, don't try to front like you wasn't. And all y'all old fans y'all know, this boy is rapping bout Gucci tampons. And diamonds in his bugers, you know I'm saying. And finally you a G, you use to claim the Northside. Now you tal'n bout you on 5-9 of Southlea, no disrespect to Southlea. You know I'm saying, but Paul Wall you a perpetrator, you ain't from there"

Because I just, I, I just don't like, I don't like that shit, know what I mean?. I'm sorry... I need help. [Rocko:]. Ayyee. We ain't goin' steady, we just be fuckin' 'round.

You've been misinformed, sorry if you read me wrong. I told you what you wanted to hear, sorry if I lead you on. Yeah that pussy good, girl I ain't gon' lie. But if you are lookin' for a dude, girl I ain't yo guy. I'm not gon' come over every day, I'm not gon' talk to you. On the phone all the time, you fuckin' stalker you.

Just hit my phone when you wanna play, girl you know I'm ready. We just be fuckin' 'round, girl you know better. You ain't my main squeeze, it ain't like we go together. You just my lil' buddy, we ain't goin' steady. Girl we just be fuckin', we ain't goin' steady. You just my fun girl, and me and you know better. We just be kickin' it, it ain't like we go together. [Chamillionaire:]. Come on. It ain't our anniversary and we ain't celebrating. See me with another girl a just pretend I'm taking. Don't pull out your purse on me cause I ain't never caking. If I gave you anything bet it was never franklins. If I get a hotel suite then this for no vacation. It's cause you all up on me yea it's for fornacation. His and her outfits never we ain't cordinating. Don't blow up my phone daily give your boy some spacing. I don't even wanna kiss or wanna tongue ya. I don't really ever wanna meet ya mother. When I ask if ya'll go down under. Say ok when ya see me like the thunder. Lookin for me like a hunter. Seein me you can kick it like a punter. It was over when ya gave me your number. Cause now I'm unclugging all your pipes like a plunger. Splash, hope ya don't get maad. Wanna make sure it's no deceipt. Can't take it back it's no receipt. If ya ask to move in I'm goin retreat. Girl you should think before you speak. You da main girl I know a freak. Can't see us sittin on no beach. And the reason I'm here is your physique. [Chorus: Rocko]. [Rocko:]. I'll chill for a few; I'll stay for a second. Time is of the essence, no time like the present. Do a lil' score or you could do a lil' chore. We can make a movie, then I'm a keep it movin'. It ain't you baby it's me, me, me, central. After we get through just leave me alone. Aye, she textin' me like crazy, sendin' me them smiley faces. I'm yo Boyfriend #2, just here to Pleasure you. I need a naughty girl, fun girl that like to play. A real party girl, just to cool it with. Whenever you ready to play just hit my phone, I'm ready. But don't be catchin' feelings baby, we ain't goin' steady. [Chorus: Rocko]"

Boppa's steady boppin'. Got a lot of ladies yeah I got a lot of options. Baby all I know is I'm on 4's. And this candy over silver sprayed on all my doors. These brauds steady tellin me my car so throwed. But my patna hopped right out and picked the braud I choose. Beat up in a slab tv screens steady fallin'. Lookin for some chicks and big business to get involved in. Use to be on 4's had them swangas steady crawlin' (4 real). Use to hit that cappa and that classic in new orleans. I took the doo-rag of the braids but I can't see a thang. Sun is out but it look dark in my new set of versace shades. Boys wonderin' and tryin' to count what I done made. Cause my pockets lookin' pudgy and my jordan's lookin' swayed. Darlin' I'm afraid that somethin isnt right. She keeps sayin that I'm cool but she keeps sayin she a dike. How do I persuade the braud to take the pipe. Tell her get off from my swangas or get plumin' in your life. Wanna be's throwin' ones tryin' to show that they makin cash. Lookin' stupid than a mother all though it'll raise ya tabs. Cause the vehicles and jewelry we got is way mo' advanced. There's more colors in a watch than a set of jamaican flags. Pick it all up in bags the promoters like make it fast. Cause here comes another monsoon and these boys is goin' make it last. Y'all hit the club tryin' to act like ya poppin' tags. Hit the club and ya new clothes and you know you goin' take it back. I'm a fly rides owner ain't no need to take a cab. Cause the key ain't nothin' to me I got cars so just take the slab. Say you doin' it bigger it trip us so they can laugh. Cause I done ran threw way mo' numbers than student's can do in math. 40 large in my pocket's is causin' my pants to sag. Still in love with my money like I use to say in the past. Who can do it better is the question they hate to ask. Walk right out ya conversation and hope that it make ya mad

Cause in another life I probably coulda bein a locksmith. Hear boys sayin nah he ain't messin with my chick. Now she shotgun and that's why they call it the cockpit. Then I see you in your lil designer outfit. And look at you what is that velvet nah just ostrich. You fly you even bought you a tie. I walked right past her and didn't even say hi. She turned and watched me walk past and yell bye. I'm wondering what I said to even make her reply. I guess that's how it goes when your dealing with pro's. I'm really ssayin nothin and she know to remove her clothes. Ain't taking none of these hoes you know to papadeuxs. I'm pulling up to the curb and then I'm just popping dows. Get out"

hate it or love it (freestyle),"(*talking*). Ha-ha whoo, Southern Smoke. You're in the presence of the finest. I ain't gotta say it, you know who this is. DJ Smallz (Chamillitary mayn). They pointing at me Smallz, man on fire. I'm not that bad right Smallz, ha-ha let's go. [Chamillionaire]. They could tell I was built to last, by the way I handled my past. Man it's gotta be hard, you giving haters a pass. I know, I should put a foot up your ass. Your realness been revoked, it's time to take off the mask. Yeah, cause I'ma show you how to do the game. Y'all ain't making no sense, like Pootie Tang. You doing what, well gon ahead and do your thang. After that comes the bang, like Coota mayn. Cooler than the cooler man, cause I'm not scary. Real recognize real, nigga I'm very. I ain't gotta chase shows, ain't necessary. Still wanna pay, to get me booked like a library. Dreams of being rich, turned to reality. Mo' money mo' problems, I'm rich and that's nigga's mad at me. If I was still broke, niggaz would see a badder me. Destiny is what it is, and what it had to be. Sipping Hennessey, with nothing to chase. And I fold him, like the stacks of money up in my safe. Use to say that I was rude, putting boys in they place. Back when Note and Flip, was putting diamonds up in they face. I was telling boys, F' you pay me. The whisper in my ear, was saying the same baby. Ok (ok) , you crazy. For thinking I'ma sit here, and let you degrade me. In this story, I was looking like the bad guy. Everybody pointing fingers at me, when I pass by. So I must be the bad one, and that's why. I throw up the middle, when I use to tell they ass hi. But no, no Mr. Rogers here. You gotta love the way I rep, but you ain't gotta cheer. I'm in a Swiss hotel, is there a problem here. Compliment your Cris', you can sip because we're out of beer. Yeah, never cared for the Michelob. Put the bigger karat in my ear, couldn't fit my lobe. Tell my chick to come here, then I flip the strobe. Light cause tonight, is the night where you forget your clothes. After that, it's right back to going after cash. Then it's back to going hard, on the bastard ass. Murk him lyrically, or I can give that ass a pass. You're in the scope, like the staff down with Aftermath. [Hook]. Hate it or love it, ""Sound of Revenge"" gon drop. And I bet every dot, I will silence that talk. Houston's MVP, the ruler of the game is me. Chamillitary nigga, we will see. (*talking*). Hol' up back at it again, it's your host for this evening. Chamillitary nigga, and we letting y'all know right now. This is the only tape, you should be playing.

I could never fall off cause that's just not conveniant. I'm taking flight till I'm on fire looking like the phoenix. All on my penis cause they know I'm bout to do it bigger. Mind reader your's is sayin I wanna do it with ya. I could read a hater palm like I do a scripture. I take a trip to mawi just to snap a poor picture. [Chorus x2: 50 Cent].

here we go,"[Intro]. Here we go again. That's life. Ooh, ooh, ooh... alright. Can't you see that it's raining? (hol' up). Can't you see that it's pouring?. They just wanna see rainfall (hol' up). They just hope that it's storming. I was gonna tell you when it rains it pours. Moder Nature's playing her part. C'mon, I don't have a lot of time to tell you this. But this is where we gon' start, hol' up. [Verse 1]. Teenager from the North side of town. It was a rainy day in Houston now. Wasn't no hoopers out, just people that would loot your house. In a city where they used to smile, you could lose your child. Think back when I heard a rap. I would listen to the words of Chad and Bun B. ""Have you heard of that? "" is what I heard them ask. I never ever heard them laugh. Uncle Ro was a street cat. He was down with a Chi-town producer named Hurt-M-Badd. He did Hail Mary for 2Pac. When he spoke everybody listened to him like you heard the man. I met them out Rap-A-Lot, I was droppin' of my partner Crime. And I was really young at the time, I wasn't even 'sposed to be there. He asked me to come with him cause he knew I could rap some lines. No problem, on the way driving everybody else working on their day job, and. Don't sell weight, no I ain't robbing. I'mma keep going, told 'em that I ain't stopping. Had rhymes I was tryna bust, I guess I said something that was live enough. I had the type of vibe that these guys could trust. And one said you should come out to the Chi with us. Can't do, it took a little while to get cool. This relationship was brand new, but you know I had too. Fast forward three months later, where do you think Cham flew?. Touch down in a windy place, make a move to Chicago. Work for survival, Vice Lords and Disciples. ""Stay gangsta"" was the motto, really, what do I know?. Well, I learned real quick how to not die. Don't wear your ball cap to the wrong side. Matter fact, you don't wanna get the wrong vibe. Don't wear the ball cap if you gon' ride. It's what he told me, and he was OG. And when I listened to him I had did it closely. It was cold so he brought me a coogi. And matter fact he never told me ""you owe me"". Think about it that was cool as hell. And I was try'na rap, tryna do it well. He had that type of hustle that included scales. The type of hustle that could put a dude in jail. I slept on his couch, I had said my prayer. Like, ""why the hell did I move way out here?. ""How did I get this great idea? "". Three months later I disappea"
here we go again,"[Intro]. Here we go again. That's life. Ooh, ooh, ooh... alright. Can't you see that it's raining? (hol' up). Can't you see that it's pouring?. They just wanna see rainfall (hol' up). They just hope that it's storming. They always gonna tell you when it rains it pours. Mother Nature's crying inside. I know I didn't tell you the entire story. But let me finish what happened that night. [Verse 1]. I was chilling with Frank Thomas the baseball player. You know the the one that played for the White Sox. Uncle Ro and Hurt M Badd is how I hooked up with him. Thought he could put us in the right spots. Let me connect the dots. On the Chi block, had two Cartier rings that was iced out. A secretary named Lorraine that was quite hot. Told me to meet him at the studio, 5 O'clock. Try'na get to the studio, picked up in a limo. I recorded a demo, and you know my MO. H-town slow it way down, here I picked up the tempo. Thought it was a Benzo, but he wasn't in a Benzo. I hopped out the car and Frank saw me. In a parking lot in his Ferrari. He opened the door and the leather was looking Godly. Real talk, could've cost a mill. He was back from New York, he had shopped a deal. He met with them talked about my appeal. All the labels were talking but not for real. Well I think you're wise, and at least ya tried. At least we know that they'll see you rise. At least you're floating on decent tires. I'm headed home but don't be surprised. That's where I be if they want me. They pro'lly don't but just call me. Gave me a couple of stacks. Because he knew I was headed right back to the hood, I think it scarred me. Then I got on the plane, headed back to Houston like it's part of the game. Gave the money to my mother and she couldn't complain. Then I headed to the Swishahouse and started a flame. Everything started moving up. After high school we was cool enough. I'm like this ain't got nothin' to do with luck. I watched Slim and Braceface candy blue a truck. The 312 What I got to dial. I called Hurt 'Em Bad like, ""we got a lot to smile. about Hurt, we can make a profit now. I need beats because we're about to put an album out"". That conversation wasn't friendly. Thought he had some beats that he could lend me. But he told me that they have a price tag. And a beat from him would cost 10 G's. That's when my heart turned empty. I wasn't trying to get them free but didn't think that you would rob me. I recorded all them songs for you and never asked you for a dollar. Now you tryna charge me? click*. On the window pane we can all see the rain. Somebody gotta let me know what part of the game is this. Wait, now I got a call from Lorraine, ""Hello? "". What's up, she's no longer working with Frank at all. And told me the reason she made the call. Is to tell what really happened with the major talk. ""They liked you Cham and they said you're raw. They liked your music but hated all the rest of the artist. He told them, nah, you wanna sign him? Gotta pay us all"". I knew that I wasn't ever signed to her. I knew that I wasn't ever signed to Frank. And Frank, he already had a lot of bank. I'm never letting anyone decide my fate. Who knew that I would do what I do?. Who knew that Michael Watts would try to screw what he screw. Who knew that Ron C was good at screwin' it too?. And how can anybody act like they had a clue?. We wasn't sittin' by a stewardess. You wasn't riding on the tour bus, and it was more than a few of us. I couldn't tell you where the jeweler was, but I could tell you where the sewer was, labels were was suing us. Switch back to Chicago, where everybody duck 5-0 and pimps ride fly though. They say ""in God we trust"", but keep a weapon in the Bible. He said ""what it look like Joe? "". He was puffing on a green leaf. In a foreign with the cream seats, matter of fact it was black. He was in the streets knee deep, now he the manager for Chief Keef. Wait, that's Uncle Ro, the one who used to take me to the studio. The one that used to tag everything we drove. We both somehow made some major dough -- woah. Fast-forward [?] with the curry. Could have sold out to the change in a hurry. I wouldn't have an AMG Benz at thirty. I probably would'a never ever made Ridin' Dirty. And now they wanna see my reign fall?. And now they wanna see my name fall?. And now they tell me that I can't ball?. Tell me what, is you a lame dawg?. Don't you realise I made y'all?. Promise I'mma take off. All they do is pretend. They never really care how many times that you win. Can't do it nine times if you ain't doing it ten. Chamillionaire, where have you been?. Here we go again. [Verse 2]. Came from the gutter, but I made it out. The young CEO with major clout. It's like a major bout. They try to tell me that I'm fading out. Until I uppercut, swing and POW!. Bet that erase the doubt. I can hear you haters talking slick. But why'd you pick the Houston 2Pacalypse. Get off my tip. But let me give you all a tip. I never liked yall, I think you all should quit. You not as rich and plus you're the type of prick to send a girl a text message with a topless pic. You talking slick, but really you ain't copped them whips. The only time you shop is when you PhotoShop your dick. I park my whip, I might let you cop a flick. See, I can spit, you rap, but you're not as sick. She's not as thick, your girlfriend is not a chick. Your whole life's a catfish and you do not exist. Haha"
hero,"[Intro:]. I'm ready to get it started. You betta tell em the hardest. You hate on me then you retarded. I'ma get mine regardless. . [Chorus:]. I'm seein the rap the games needin me to come back to the mixtapes and relieve them. Fans geekin and rap sales peakin sayin they need of someone to believe in. I'm seein that they ain't me and wreck Polow beat for no apparent reason. And I think it's huntin season. So I'm cockin back and squeezin. . [Verse 1:]. Look at the fans talkin bout who spit better lines. I don't know what they doin but prepare for mines. I don't just spit a line better than Kevin Federline. You better tell I'm really better than who ever rhyme. Hold up let me out this chair. Hear y'all talkin bout ya hustles ain't no profit there. hear ya talkin bout ya deals but that ain't profit square. Y'all get lil' royalties I get profit share. What up Fifty, what up Buck, what up Lupe, what up Game. What up Jeezy, what up Luda; what up T.I., what up Wayne. Just cuz I say they name don't mean I'm insane. Cuz I'm shoutin out all the artists that make me step up my game. If I say I'm better than 50 his fans gonna complain. If I say I'm better than Wayne his fans will do the same. I don't wanna ruffle feathers so maybe I should explain. Maybe it's M.O.E. ""Me Over Everythang"". I'm better than you know who so better that it's a shame. I'm better than Lil' Mama I'm better Lil' Zane. I'm better than Lil' Blang imbead it in your brain. I'm better than every rapper that rap with a little name. You should be pissed that I'm pissed. I know some of my past records was a hit or miss. Don't try to twist up my ish and twist it into a diss. If you gon' twist up what said then you should twist it this. Lauren London can get kissed on the lips. And Bill O' Reilly and Don Imus can get hit with a fist. Hakeem I'm the dream stop missin the swish. And MTV my name is what ya missed on the list. Wait let me rewind I really don't want them. To think I'm tryin to diss I really just want them. To know I'm not the type that will take Lauren to London. Matter fact Lauren be lucky if I take her to lunch man. It's the King of the Hill from the Land trill. What up Elise can't you see I'm movin in for the kill. Either I could drop one song a year like a skillz. Or we could get off in the streets it's time to pay these bills. Gas prices gettin high and I'm knowin I got a fleet. I'm Skinny than a mutha I'm knowin I gotta eat. So any rapper out here that no that they got a beat. Better never ever allow the instrumental to leak. I'm in the studio everyday and I'm lettin 'em loose. Black and Decker in the trunk it ain't nothin but tools. Wanna run a money marathon it ain't nothin to prove. My closet lookin like a stadium it's nothin but shoes. Jae Millz I ain't forgot about the cover you gave me. I appreciate it G I'm still one of them crazy. Rebels out the Texas and I'm runnin 'em daily. Now I'm back off in the streets like F you pay me. For jackin the Texas swagger Famous hand me the dagger. Nah nevermind cuz these fakers don't even matter. . [Chamillionaire Speaking:]. Mixtape Messiah 4 august 27th. And this just a throw away. I got a drive full of 'em let's go. . [Verse 2:]. Yeah they get offended by words but you can tell it's fear. They say ball 'til you fall the fall is never near. They all say that they ball but who you tellin dear. I manage a whole lotta money like Kenneth Crear. Manage a whole lotta money like Shaka Zulu. You think that I ain't good at Ramen you out ya noodle. Safe sex mayne ya label tryin to prostitute you. I'm on the grind up earlier than the cockadoodle. What up Killer Mike it's grind time mayne. Rap game in my aim I'm like bang bang bang. Only rappers gettin mad the ones who can't maintain. Now the rap is gettin back to the mixtapes mayne. First they tried to hate when I left said I'm history. Came back they tellin me they miss me. Twenty g's for this watch are you sick G. A .com on my arm this is 50. Hataz talkin actin like they some motormouths. And I'ma automatic start and turn ya motor off. Crib Big MTV can't even show the house. Cuz it would take 30 minutes for them to show the couch. F sales (what ya mean?) bank account is great. Wreckin it since '98 and never took a break. Until recently throwin my rob back in the lake. Rap game tried to give me kibbles till I took the stake. Stop barkin baby I'm not starvin. Gettin bucks you crazy I'm millwalkin. Ya concience is talkin about caution. Slit ya wrist (slit) I'm Sharper than Al Sharpton. Koopa, Easy"

Ridin' 84 or the 83, ain't ridin' them,. then they ain't wit me. How y'all pay to get in the club,. and then hate on the person y'all pay to see. Now we got my block live again,. look at these whips we're riding in. Making balling look easy baby,. we don't practice like Iverson. Sliding in on them super pokes. when I'm getting close just guard your face. All the sinners start calling God,. all the rappers start calling Mase.

Telling me it's her birthday, new shoes and her purse suede. You should go and preach to the choir,. I ain't the one that you can persuade. She ain't worry of the hotel,. I wouldn't even get a motel.

I'm just hoping that you try. I'm just hoping you try to try me,. get drag around by your suit tie. You can catch me in a foreign city,. where they don't even know I rap. First album when platinum. so there ain't many places on my map. Going golf in Iraq, going shopping in Dubai. She'll be asking her man for gifts. and give me the gifts the her dude buy. Bought a wallet with a mouse trap,. no rat can get my cheese. Hoodrats get no scraps get throwed back like huaraches. Wanna book me for 5 G's,. read the sign that say stop please. Can't knock me my trunk knockin,. might make your woman look knock knee. Call me but I'm unreachable, too trill to be speaking to. Got lost in my own garage. and they couldn't find me for a week or two. My trunk'll open like peek-a-boo,. neon lights'll be seeping through. Candy blue, all my speakers blue,. but I turned ?em up and my speakers blew. [Hook]. Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up. Hold up, hold up, hold up. That's what they call it.

One four, one dime, you already know which one mine. Tripping like Juicy J, Cee Lo done got me in the booth today. If it come 'tween hoes and dough. I drop off the chick and then scoop the pay. Might as well, I might as well,. passing up dough is a major fail. Take a trip to South Africa,. but can't lead the paper like Dave Chappelle. Realest rapper you'll ever meet,. she want an autograph on her fake breast. Too young or just too dumb,. girl slow it down and take a brake test. My jack is out when my Lac is out,. don't worry 'bout it, I ain't stressed. Hot chocolate on my hallo tips. they might mess around and get a taste test. [Hook]. Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up. Hold up, hold up, hold up. That's what they call it. Soon they see me roll up, roll up. They don't know what to call that. So they call it, call it, call it. Hold up, hold up, hold up.

Somebody get a box ready for these guys. No four door, had the coupe that ride. That eagle right here if you wanna feel fly. No games though, no names spoke. This crack right here, cocaine flow. I don't know what you doing but I'm paid bro. Yeah I pitch that 9 like pedro. Stuck in the car with my nigga I'm ready to ride. We on our way to the top, watch that paper rise. Keep telling everybody what you gonna do. Middle finger like fuck what you going through. All I know is that money that I'm going to. And them gang boys wanna bore you. Like wassup cause I told you. Just money in the pocket, fold you. T-A-Y-L-O-R G-A-N-G Gang. [Chorus]. [Wiz Khalifa:]. First 48, first 48. Took out 50 racks and blew the first 48.

And that's just one show, imagine what my tour gon make?. Police ran up on my tour bus. But hey my niggas more money more problems. More lawyers on the case. Niggas at the Grammys. I was at the crib working. Heard they little diss but I'm just being the big person. Never been trained, still my aim near perfect. Everything I spits murder. [Chorus]"

Situation ain't changed, mayn it's still the same. You trying to get at Puff, you trying to get at Dame. Plastic crack in the trunk, trying to get a name.

Keep on grinding for it, and your money multiply. I, use to scrabble raps up in my pad. No do' just hope, yep that's all I had. And my family, they didn't like it that's why I was mad. Couldn't live up my own dreams, that's why I was bad. Bad yeah, and you could color me bad. But now the screen looking green, and they shoving me that. I hear him scream bout the cream, but it doesn't be fact. Cause it's only a few that's true, and really does it with rap. That's the truth, that y'all would never hear.

house of pain,"[Intro]. Exit the realest road, on the highway. It's my block homie, now you headed my way. Ignore her, like nice cars in the driveway. Walk inside, and let your troubles fly away. Hmmm-hmmm-hmm, I feel your pain. I feel your pain, it's the house of pain. Welcome to the house of pain, aaaaaaaaaah. [Chamillionaire]. Walking that hallway where mom say, she get treated the wrong way. And all day, dude just argue about it all day. And all they, never handle it in a calm way. She throws stuff at him, while he tries to hop out of harm's way. And y'all say, that it ain't no place like home. Which is true, cause home is really like no place I've known. They can't see the light is dark, even with the light bulbs on. But even when the good times day, life goes on. Yeah look in the bathroom, look at this girl throwing up. Naw she's not sick, but she's sick of life cause she knows it sucks. Cause her father's, not around to see her growing up. Her birthday's tomorrow, we know that bastard ain't showing up. Look at him po'ing up, liquor in the kitchen. Daddy got problems, he treat liquor like the prescription. He's broke and he blame mama, cause she can't fix him. Now the neighbors whisp'ring, bout how the family became victims. But don't piss him off, cause you know that he's violent. You know he won't quit, throwing his fist till she's silent. 911, can somebody please dial it. Lord please, could you help me put a end to this riot. [Hook]. Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmmmm-hmm, I feel your pain. I feel your pain-I feel your pain, welcome to the house of pain. [Yung Ro]. Open the door to my home, and you'll see nobody man. And a sign that says, Welcome to Nobody Land. Now if you take a look around, you will see it's so easy. To notice the pain, and my mother's heart bleeding. Trying to make ends meet, ain't no father to help. But besides the bills she needs some love herself. Now she's screaming her son's name, Lil' Ro come home. Thirty minutes passed, she realized Yung Ro gone. He can't deal with the stress, embedded in his brain. So he takes it physically, but tell me who's to blame. Was it the dope or mama fussing, know his daddy was gone. A bad day, or was it just life alone. He's so stressed on the edge, and his palms are flinching. Now the police trying to warn him, bout consequences. But only God can judge me, so nigga fuck your jail. Cause when I'm dead, my niggas can't bond me out of hell. (*talking*). Dear Lord, the house of pain is yours. Sometimes I cried, I complained. Cause it hurt so much, I was confused. But then I realized, when I needed you the most. Is when I'm crying, I'm hurt. Or when I'm struggling, thank you. [Bridge]. When I'm struggling, baby. And I really don't know, what else to do. I just need a little faith, I need praying. Can't call on no one's help, but you. I know the Lord, gon feel my pain. And I trust that, you gon help me through. Cause I know, you feel my pain. Feel my paa-aaaain. [Chamillionaire]. Come inside his brother's in jail, he copes putting drugs in himself. And his mother is well, she's not being a mother cause hell. There's no dinner on the table, he does it himself. With the drugs that he sells, his old man does he need help. Naw-uh look in the living room, there's no surviving. TV images of him, and Osama Bin Loden. They feeding me them images, but I'm really not buying. What them guys in the office saying, quit with the lying. Never ask for the drama, just mash for a dolla. Trying to get a dolla, to buy pampers for his daughter. But then he gotta hear his mama, and baby mama holla. Just cause he ain't got a lot of money, he got nada. Never asked for the drama, just asked for a cama. After the line of zeros, and after the time of. Of patience started buzzing, he blasted your honor. He caught a case, but he was chasing after a dolla"

in love with my money,"[chorus: chamillionaire]. Big swangaz and vouges. Them 20 inches sittin low. We ball 24/7 all that we know. Screens and neon lights gon show. When my trunk unlock pop and show. Ya already know. Paint drippin off the door. Not engaged with no lady, fall in love with em no. You may think i'm crazy never knew this type of love before. I'm love with my foreign, yes i'm married to my dough. I'm in love with my money.... [chamillionaire]. You can catch me squeezing grain. Sittin crooked on d's and swangz. Color changin lizard he's insane. Ya womans missing then he's to blame. Charge it to the game keep the change. Most marriages blossom and die. When its over i'm tellin her bye. But she acts like i'm tellin a lie. While you fallin in love with a she. I rather be dubblin a g. Could you see me in a car that rhymes with rent me and starts with a b. Could you see a bentley. Parked in the crunkest spot in ya hood. Candy coat on top of the hood. And my fist on top of the wood. Sparkling good. Say you ain't after my change i don't believe ya. If a skeezer ask me to feed her. With my visa then i'ma leave her. Koopa don't want ya koopa don't need ya. (but i love you) thats sweet. I rather be slidin' on glass feet. With leather up under my ass cheeks. Its not like i changed over night. Been actin like this since last week. Better ask p; my money stretched like an athelete at a track meet. Seen him last week in a jag jeep. (but they don't even make them yet cuzzin). Ok i'm lyin i don't know what it was. But i swear that boy was sittin on buttons. I know you want a relationship with a baller but no thanks, look. I'd rather be shining my twanks. You must think this is a bank but it ain't. Money increase and never would shrink. Hoes that be dikin even be fightin. When i pull up on 20 inch titans. Cuz i got what them girls be likin. Them uhh.... [chorus]. [paul wall]. Hold on hold up a second mayne. I never mack to a metro dame. You better respect the game. See my gecko chain and correct ya brain. I love my car like it was my girlfriend - i like to carress the grain. Followed the wheel and i got aroused. I swung in the ditch and i wrecked the frame. Broke up with my foreign car and fell in love with a cadillac. The ringling brothers enquired to how my trunk turns flips like an acrobat. I act a rat, cuz i'm from the gutter. Ya girl stutter when i pull up next to ya. You been with the girl 6 months paul wall. Is the reason she won't give sex to ya. Why all that plex in ya. Cuz a german company made my rims. My big body's pregant with twins i'm bout to induce a baby benz. Ya car was fly in the hood but my candy paint just wet ya flame. I'm sittin on 22 inch baby sitters babelous threatin ya name. Forgot to change the diaper so when i crept in the lane i left a stain. Everytime it rains, paint drips it makes a mess and i get the blame. My tv's are the pet i train i can make em roll over and play dead. My car was blue on the freeway. But when i stopped at the light it changed to red. You betta re arrange ya head thinkin i trick my cash to a broad. Go ahead and ask ya broad i got more green than the grass in a yard. And thats so raw it ain't hard for me to get the class to applaud. I shine like a blasting star, glass on a car more blacker than tar. [chorus]3x"
in money we trust (full version),"[bun b]. Now if you got it on yo mind. I can get it off your chest. Take it out yo mouth and i'm gon' take care of the rest. No stress, just do-do, when i'm jumpin' out the 4-door. Smoke 'll hit you like judo when you walk up to the yuko. When i let the top down, sippin lean still ballin'. Tv's in the visors so the screens still fallin'. Niggaz grab hustlin' i ain't finna break my neck. I make some paper off this flow, but i got rich off respect. Ask anybody who know me about my seeds. Westside 9th street, i came up amongst the g's. Crack game in 88, it took over shit i was there. I stood on southern through texas and got my share. And my nina on my waist, dope up in my jaw. One eye for them fiends, one eye for that law. Niggaz crooks as niggaz soft, so my rep is hard as steel. Big bun muthafucka, representin' for the trill. [chorus - chamillionaire]. If you haters you gon' like us. If you like us you gon' hate us. But, one thing you can say is we some serious paper chasers. Cuz, friends turn to haters. And, some turn to traders. But my money never change us (mhum). So in money we trust. (repeat). [chamillionaire]. Wipe the mirror cuz there's a compare of eyes in a colored face. Can they see why he love to chase. Green fetti in a gutta place. He grew up so he love the taste. For diniro's he love disgrace. Denies that he's tellin' a lie lookin' right in his mother's face. Can't reside, in his brother's 'states. But out ridin' on dub's he take. What's hidin' above his waist, and go ride out some other fake. He's claimin' that he's real, but when he's not on that camera. He rather gets something fully colds, like he's copyin' santa. When he's not on that camera, he's talkin' like he cock with his grammar. But he will not cock go pop, at the top of his hammer. Money's the reason why rich people get red-dots on they flannels. While bank-tellers gotta get down on the floor like they banner. Gotta spot in that 'bama, and also gotta spot in that channel. Few people know i gotta spot to stash that knot in atlanta. Don't trust the chick i with, she fine and mixed with another race. But here's the combination to my safe, if i'm sent to another place. [chorus - chamillionaire]. If you haters you gon' like us. If you like us you gon' hate us. But, one thing you can say is we some serious paper chasers. Cuz, friends turn to haters. And, some turn to traders. But my money never change us (mhum). So in money we trust. (repeat). [slim thug]. Alot of brauds say when slim got a lil change he changed. I ain't go lie yeah i changed, but it was for the better mayne. When i was broke ain't have to worry bout gold-diggin' hoes. When i was broke i ain't have to worry bout jackers tryin' to get my dough. Haters bustin' the .44's, cuz i'm stickin' they chick. I got alot of best friends quick, when they heard i was rich. And them niggaz i used to ride with, stack cash get high with. Was the same niggaz on my side, them the same niggaz i'ma die with. Some friends turn foes, and some men turn hoes. But that's how the shit goes, when you ain't broke no more. Money the root of all evil, it could help or hurt people. You can't live without it so it tend to turn good guys evil. Alot of folks love money, more then they love theyself. I rather be dead then broke takin' death chances for wealth. I know niggaz 'll kill you for scrilla and won't think twice to bust. Yo life ain't worth shit to us, (mhum) in money we trust!. [chorus - chamillionaire]. If you haters you gon' like us. If you like us you gon' hate us. But, one thing you can say is we some serious paper chasers. Cuz, friends turn to haters. And, some turn to traders. But my money never change us (mhum). So in money we trust. (repeat)"
in the trunk,"[Intro]. This, is, the-the sound of revenge [repeat 2X]. You in the presence of the finest. Chamillitary mayne! This for the streets. Let's give 'em somethin they can bump (innnn the trunk). At this point you should be turnin your speakers up. Turn your speakers up - Chamillionaire man!. Let it bump, it's a southern thing. Ha ha, Chamillitary mayne! (innnn the trunk). [Verse 1]. I heard somebody say that the South ain't got no lyricists. Well 'bang bang' at the game like everyone down here is pissed. You lookin for the truth then look no further, here it is. Turn it up a notch so they can not say they not hearin this. They say Chamill is sick, click click, here's a clip. 'Bang bang' at the rap game to make your spirits lift. And it seems to me the industry is all on Jigga's dick. Who? You, you, you, and you nigga - pick a click. Universal sent me to bring some realness to the industry. Got here, then I realized that ain't nobody real but me. Okay, a couple niggaz but none of 'em real as me. Tell your favorite rapper he should diss me if he disagree. I bet I'm actin like your favorite rapper isn't me. Tell your second favorite whose the best and show 'em a picture of me. He'd have to take me out to prove that he's as sick as me. So me verse me, the only battle that y'all gonna get to see. I'm plainly sayin what I'm sayin to make these haters mad. Perpetratin hatin ass, see me ridin candy slab. Disbelieve his ass, how many vehicles can he have?. I be losin count myself and I ain't even that bad at math. That's how we do it in Texas, poppin trunk and grippin wood. We reply to threats (how?) Nigga, I wish you would. You can keep on talking, but that's only if you could. Gotta turn my speakers up, can you hear 'em now? (No) Good!. [Chorus]. Ain't runnin from a thang, cause I ain't never been a punk. Drama ain't a thang, cause I can bring it if they want. I'ma let it bang, so they can feel it in the (innnn the trunk). You bout it wit'cha game, decide your rep and throw it up. What you tryin to drank, cause I'ma bout to get you drunk. Keep it pimpin mayne, so they can feel it in the (innnn the trunk). [Verse 2]. This for the street niggaz knowin they gotta pee in a cup. Know your peace officer tossin ya when he see the results. This for the G's, hate is what you see in the scope. Gauge gonna get sprayed like it's Raid when you see him approach. Tell you ahead of time, solo I can handle mine. You ain't too smart but play the part like you a pantomime. But you don't have a nine, I'll show you I hammer mine. Time to make you do the Running Man like it's Hammer Time. Shout out to the west and all my gangstas pack heat up. Actin up and pack enough heat to make you back it up. The hoes back it up, soon as they hear the back of the trunk. Now I'ma stock like New York slang (What you mean?) That's what;s up. Money stack it up when they feel they have enough. Get the chips and add 'em up, then she givin that to us. Don't put all that in cuffs, treat your money like a slut. Niggaz better share, hell yeah, cause I just wanna cut. A hater gettin cut, someone gon' get hurt (hurt). Especially if you met me and was disrespect turf (turf). (Houston, Texas) I'm the worst, ice looking like sherbert. Bouncin off my chest, you're starin at it like a pervert. Mixtape god, don't hate me, go to church first (why?). Might as well since all the rappers wearin church shirts. Better think ahead of time, call yourself a nurse (nurse!). Diss me in your second and you won't get to finish your third verse. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. You in the presence of the finest. The game is full of fakes, all these rappin niggaz front (front). _Controversy Sells_, the industry givin 'em what they want (want). See he ain't gangsta as he say, that's why they dress 'em up. Get a vest, a plastic gun and go pull a publicity stunt. Hoe act like she slow, don't know that I'm rich. And ignore the handles missing from the do's of my whip. But then she saw me on TV and told me pause for a flick. (What you tell her?) You can ""106 & Park"" on my dick (on my dick). Can't speak about Texas and not mention me. Cause the world gon' have to see the truth come out eventually. I'll rip any gimmick rapper out from A to Z. 934-829 to the 2 if you still disagree. We never marry a hoe, what I'ma marry you fo'.

But obviously, your just a groupie (Groupie Love!). [Verse 1:]. See, I got a clue when Young Dro said his girlfriend got a girlfriend. That girlfriend of his girlfriend had Chamillionaire as her man. Then T-Pain said he was sprung,. said he had fell in love with a stripper. I shoulda known that you was the stripper. that was on the pole tuggin on his zipper. Kanye said that you was a gold digger,. You always wanted to be major paid. I turned on my TV and then I seen you kissin on Flava Flav. We was both fans of UGK, we was both dreaming bout ridin blades. While I was dreaming, you was gettin laid on everybodys bed and I was getting played. Yung Joc knew that we was through,. said he knew he didn't stand a chance. You stood still while my song played. and his came on and you did his dance. You kept begging me for romance, I kept telling you that's enough. You turned on my boy Juvenile and then proceeded to back that up. Pitbull said 'Culo!' and I ain't even that good at spanish. But I knew he was talking to you,. I was down with you so I couldn't stand it. Don't try to lie, Don't try to cry, Ain't nothing more for us to talk about. Like Unk told ya take 2-Steps towards the door and just walk it out. [Chorus]. G-R-O-U-P-I-E. Told me that she ain't a freak x2. . G-R-O-U-P-I-E. Told me that she ain't a freak x2.

But obviously, your just a groupie (Groupie Love!). . [Verse 2:]. Gave Bun B a little groupie love,. you gave Pimp C a little groupie love. And then you bumped into the whole Screwed Up Click and gave every member in the group a hug. Even messed with my boy Slim Thug,. he pulled up, you had a heart attack. You tried to mess with Game and 50. but neither one of em called you back. Ask J.R., my car was pushed to the limit on Cool & Dre. Plus Rick Ross was Hustlin' that money outcha like everyday. You knew that I loved you was them three words that I'd never say. Now your business all over the radio and its the penalty that you have to pay. You made the choice to go and be a freak,. even had Akon been smacking that. Her plan was to get ran through by a linebacker or a quarterback. R Kelly didn't have to tell me about your bump-n-grind and your foreplay. I found out and I asked you if this was true, you said no way. Birdman said 'Believe Dat!', T.I.P. was like 'Shawty!'. Then Young Jeezy said 'That's Right!' and Lil' Jon said 'Okay!'. Heard you was messin with Ray J, you did a flick is what they say. I ain't even wanna look at the tape until P.Diddy said Press Play. [Chorus]. G-R-O-U-P-I-E. Told me that she ain't a freak x2. G-R-O-U-P-I-E. Told me that she ain't a freak x2. Baby, You was kinda high maintenance to me.

it's just pain,"I tried to call up God and complain?Then he said ""Why ya calling my name"". It's just pain, pain. It's just pain, pain.. It's just pain, and It's apart of the game. I tried to call up God's name. Then he said ""All ya do is complain"". It's just pain, pain. It's just pain, pain.. It's just pain, and It's apart of the game. . The industry is a robber. My mental be really bothered. Not talking to any callers. Escape the clutches of pover-ty. I'm close to my Mama. Ain't really close to my Father. The more I became a baller. The more I seen him get farther. Cuz I don't trust you enough to let you inside of my mind. And even if I let you in. Couldn't handle what you would find. I done been through serious times. And don't care if you think I'm lyin'. I was grown at the age of 9. Wanna get you out of a bind. I spent my savings to save you. Try to get you up out of jail. Had to sign that lil' paper promising. that you wouldn't jump your bail. But then what you do. Jump your bail. They want you. And want me as well. Then the day it happened to me. Yea I hated it it was hell. And you had to know that I hate it. I hate it I'm irritated. It's loud and it's getting crowded. My space is getting invaded. No nachos but there were some vatos. Who said they don't speak no English. I'm telling them make some room. And he lookin' like what you meanin'. And ain't no such thing as team. When the General wanna take your spot. You the one that's on the bench watchin'. I'm the one that's takin' the shot. And I seen the hate on ya face. At the moment you seen it drop. Even people that's really close. Try to take ya down from the top. What about that lil' fan try to say that I had her baby. Ya baby I ain't even met her. So it ain't even a maybe. Plus her skin was Caucasian. She tryin' to reach me daily. Ya groupie won't be a lady. She obviously tryna play me. It's obvious she was crazy. Only thing she can do. Is go find a stupid rich rapper. Thats out there that she can screw. And Now she feelin' so stupid. In the shows what I said was true. If I plan to sleep with a white girl. I wouldn't go sleep with you. So I keep saying his name. And he say I say it in vain. And he say that the only time that I call. Is when it's some pain. Try to mess with my lil' sis. And I threw some salt in ya game. Cuz I knew you was old enough. To be one of our parents mayne. But a shame on you. You shame. You the only person to blame. When a 25 person gang. Try to jump me and take my chain. I was the only person not wet. By the punches thrown in the rain. And I couldn't hold any grudges. I said I forgive ya mayne. It was true that he had a temper. My Father wasn't being gentle. At night I'd wake up to knocking. My Mama tryna get in the window. Turn on the TV. Tryna act like I'm tryna play the Nintendo. The house done burnt down forever. And no longer sentimental. They livin' and lovin' life. Until his girl had fell off that bike. And he happened to still survive. But the future don't look as bright. I admit that I got mad at ya. And wish that we both could fight. When I knock on them Pearly Gates. Just don't tell me to take a hike"

Cause I'm swearing I'm tearing your whole appearence tell kadava. Most of em get madder cause my money on a ladder. Might not really matter but I'll still turn you into matter. I'm just doing my thing just met a stripper in atlanta. Tried to sit on my lap I had to tell her I ain't santa. Money to gather anything else is looking blurry. I'm sitting on vogues count the spokes I think it's 30. Turn the radio on and they say that they ain't heard me. I'm still countin from ridin and that white n nerdy early. Yea I'm a star can't say I'm not. When I gotta tour bus for a car. Got stacks on deck and I roll with soldiers like ja-bar. While I'm in a jacuzzi watchin your braud take off her bra.

Gave a card that was sayin chamillitary to the teller. Be raining forever are logo should be an umbrella. [Rick Ross:]. Big black nigga, and an icey watch.

keep drivin',"[Verse 1]. Who are you to have any clout, or have any doubt about my potential?. You ain't working for the police, you'll never get to check my credentials. Took a look at my blueprint, tried to copy me like a stencil. But they can only be number two, I hope you fakers run out of pencils. So presidential, like Kennedy in that Continental. Except it's like I switched vehicles and didn't let 'em see what I'm hopping into. When they see you get popular, then they popping up to come pop your mental. They always tell me that money talks, and my conversation ain't confidential. Who said that I can't either, that's something that I can't digest. I'm 'bout to eat like I closed my eyes and this meal in front of me God blessed. Only guilty of being dope, and pleading life is no contest. Cause if you think that they've got it locked, then that lock to me is like Loch Ness. Y'all talking 'bout me way more than me, and what do you think that say 'bout you?. In your mind I keep popping up, my nickname should'a been deja vu. Been here for too long for you to say I'm through, I stay blessed, I ain't even say hatchoo. My city and state will say I'm true, cause I be doing everything I say I do. [Hook]. Hop in the drop, no time to wait. No, I know you see me hustling every day. They know they not, they know they ain't. So, they say how fast I'm going isn't safe. They tell me stop, pump on your brakes. No, I just keep driving, keep driving straight. They tell me stop, pump on your brakes. No, I just keep driving, keep driving straight. [Verse 2]. I've been running this for forever, so listen close if you're new to this. Every day is a motion picture, my calendar is a movie list. Introduce myself as a rapper, then put the guap before groupie chicks. In the coupe and I'm riding like I can't let the top of that roof exist. See I was local, not hot at all, told myself that I gotta ball. Hit the streets with that Houston heat, help you get your mind right with Paul. Every verse is just like the law, I'm the person they Skype a call. Want a verse, they ask what it's worth, I'm like Koopa really don't like it, no. Never sold you no lame gimmick, I never sold you no fake image. Don't disrespect me and you don't you ever put me and them in the same sentence. The same minute they [?] your hustle, I start the engine, get out the way. If you're really hoping my reign fall, then write a rain check, cause it's not today. [Hook]. [Post-Hook]. Keep driving, keep driving, keep driving straight. Keep driving, keep driving, keep driving straight. Money all on my plate, they keep telling me wait. I ain't taking no breaks, I just hop in my ride and drive. I ain't tryin'a be late, I'm just tryin'a be great. I can't tell you my fate, just let me know if you're down to ride. [Outro]. Oh, yeah, yeah, I just hop in my ride and drive"
keep it on the hush (feat. lloyd),"[Chorus: Lloyd]. At the end of the night if you're feelin lonely. Keep me on your mind if you need some grown things. Just tell me the time and you know that I'll be. Rollin up in my ride but nobody's gonna see. So if you're feelin like, you're really lonely. I can hop in my ride, and hit up your street. I got a innocent glide, of lovin only. So just give meet me outside, and I'll be on the creep. But you know we can {keep it on the hush, k-keep it on the hush}. I'ma {keep it on the hush, k-keep it on the hush}. I'ma {keep it on the hush, k-keep it on the hush}. I'ma {keep it on the hush, k-keep it on the hush}. [Chamillionaire]. Yeah... I pull up in the driveway it's like the passenger pick-up. Filled your liver with liquor, your silhouette lookin thicker. You would think she a stripper how she unzippin her zipper. Rubberband full of Benjamins got me tempted to tip her. Never leavin a message for evidence when she phony. Talk is cheap so that action the only thing she can show me. If he catch you he catch you, just tell him that I'm your homie. When you see me in public look past me like you don't know me. Conversation is chasin her, that's as soon as he leave. Disappear when he near then I reappear like a breeze. You get caught in the process won't hear no snitchin from me. I'll zip my lip and I'll lock it and we can throw away the keys, ha ha. [Chorus]. [Chamillionaire]. I hear a hello on the line, and that's when I reply. You let her know that I'm outside waitin. Sittin real low in my ride, you know it on my side. Cause you know how some haters be hatin. Hat's sittin low (low) Caddy's sittin low. She ain't been at home (home) while he lookin fo' her. While she wit her folk (folk) act like I don't know her. You already know (know) she do what I told her - keep it on the hush. Pullin up on them Daytons to give her what she been waitin. Four at four in the mornin she's up and mine for the takin. Three's a crowd but I'm lovin that crowd participation. So bring a friend if you feel her, leave her hung if she hatin. [Chorus]. [Lloyd]. Cause everywhere I go, people wanna know, who you are to me. So I tell them, you and me are good friends, when the reality is. We creepin on the hush, so keep it on the hush. Do whatever just don't tell them about us. Keep it on the hush, we creepin on the hush. Do whatever just don't tell them about us. [Chorus]"

Oh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie. Time to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie. Time to make a, oh yeah, it's time to make a movie. Time to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie. Oh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie. [Twista]. What's up little mama, come and meet me your manager. Be your photographer, you be the one ima take a picture of. You could be on my cinema, then ima get you whatever you want. Then ima do anything to get your love. Hit it from the back and hit it from the front. And ima look in the camera so I could let em know it's up in it. When I'm filmin', I'll be ready, next triple. 'Cause I circle their nipples and every movie you gon be up in it. Pull me out and people be classy and but baby we can surprise me. You can be my porn star, keep the lights on. 'Cause I wanna see it, it's better for shootin'. And how you be lookin' I see you goin' far. I sleep over your kids, you'll be right back. Openin' up your legs now you on the right track. Let me aim the camera down while you wipe that. We can forget about the lips, do you like that?. That, that. I'll be workin' your body like I be working the pictures in the portfolio. I don't know if it was a face, it was a hair, it was an ass, that made me want to put you up in the video. Give it to Twista with the Chamillionaire. Murder in the booth when I smoke a fillionaire?. I'll be the director come gimme a chair. Star quality I'll see you when I'm a trillionaire. [Chorus - Lloyd Chamillionaire]. Girl you hypnotize me, love the way you move it. Sit back like a player while you doin' what you doin'. Whisper in my ear tellin' me how she gon' do me. Oh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie. Ain't no need to be nervous, we can get some room service. I can give it how you want it girl if that's okay. Time to make a movie, movie, time to make a movie. Gotta tell me how you want it, you know ima be up on it from the night till the mornin' girl if that's okay. Time to make a movie, movie, time to make a movie. One, two, three, go. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Oh, she likes me, oh. Let's get it. One, two, three, go. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Oh, she likes me, oh. Let's make a movie. [Chorus - Lloyd Chamillionaire]. Girl you hypnotize me, love the way you move it. Sit back like a player while you doin' what you doin'. Whisper in my ear tellin' me how she gon' do me. Oh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie. Time to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie. Time to make a, oh yeah, it's time to make a movie. Time to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie.

my dream (feat. akon),"[Intro - Akon (Chamillionaire)]. See I remember I was just loner. (I was just a loner, I was just a loner). (But I told them haters) ""Look at me!"". (I dream, you Dream, We all Dream big dreams). (I dream, you Dream, We all Dream big dreams). I'm on top permanently but I stay in the streets (Harmony baby). And I won't stop bringin that heat. It's my dream (I said it's my dream). I said it's my dream... ooh. [Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]. Big as Barack Obama soon as he hit that podium. Always speakin that real these rappers is Nickelodeons. Say he ain't got the streets look at them killers voting him. Periodically charting music be mixed with sodium (chemistry). See they hate him and they love him like he Kobe. And he just be getting money while haters be out there promoting him. Pick a Mixtape Messiah then open it and you'll notice him. Cuz he be talkin trash like he want to be a custodian. The God of mixtapes make sure that your kids blessed. You think that I sweat money the way that the kid dress. Show them I get checks just look at the wrist (Yes!). My jewels the color of urine just give me a piss test. I'm so unsanitary my heater is in a corner. Diamonds always exposed I roll with that Arizona. Heater be hibernating come wake it up if you wanna. Doctor resuscitating to wake you up from a coma (Clear!). Same channel no it sure can't be I'm so HD and you just so ain't me. Album coming soon just like o-k-c money music to my ears DO-RE-MI (Haha). Ridin with no rims I call it t-shirt with no panties on. Threw some rims on it now it got some chrome pajamas on. Pull up to the club no we ain't gonna make it belly storm. It's going to be a 100 percent chance of rain on every arm. Killin the mic you ain't half as dope. I'm the coldest underground need a casket coat. I'm bout to snatch the whole game from you bastards. So I'll probably write my next verse on a ransom note goodbye. [Chorus - Akon (Chamillionaire)]. Yall remember I was just a loner hanging on the corner (Corner). Now take look at me (Look at me). Big bossin steady stackin chips never thought that I would see this shit. Now I'm on top permanently but I stay in the streets. And I won't stop bringin that heat. It's my dream (I said it's my dream). I said it's my dream... ooh. [Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]. Standing up to drama my posture is like a mobster. Frazier to a hater I'll box you like a boxer. Money don't change my thoughts you're an imposter. Thought you passed me but I caught you like I gotcha. Koopa my metaphor is a metaphor. That symbolizes each metaphor like a metal door (Hard!). And yall need to put up a better score. We making A's and we grading you with the letter four. I mean the letter F-O-U-R. Tryin to say you a G?! I'm like Oh-you-are?. Don't be talkin all them lies like I don't know you boy. Don't be talkin all them lies like I can't show you boy (Yea). Put your money up and you can really get beat. Like blacks getting pulled over by Philly police. I just made a Hundred thousand to put in my piece. In what seems like a year but it was really a week. Ain't Lil Troy but I wanted to be a ""baller"". Money on the line let me holler at the caller. Bow to the man forgiveness from the Father. For waking my eye at one of Reverend Run's daughters. Koopa and they respecting it highly. I came in to the game they did their best to deny me. Hungry CEO success is salami. Success was on the sandwich and it was yellin out ""Try me!"". After that Ra-ta-ta-ta murder she wrote. K-Slay and DJ Drama said ""I heard that he dope"". Chamillionaire[dot]com done the fanbase is a cult. L-M-A-O your fanbase is a joke (Haha!). Laugh while I bask stacks of that cash. Every time I wreck so they ask for that crash. See the airbag, the Jag, the lac cash. Try to say that I be preaching well pastor is now mad. I'll make Reverend Run move and that a step to the left. Cuz I'm the best of both me's that's the best and the best. It's the Mixtape God put the rest of them to rest. Press pause for the Gob and confess that your blessed. [Chorus - Akon (Chamillionaire)]. Yall remember I was just a loner hanging on the corner (Corner). Now take look at me (Look at me). Big bossin steady stackin chips never thought that I would see this shit. Now I'm on top permanently but I stay in the streets. And I won't stop bringin that heat. It's my dream (I said it's my dream). I said it's my dream... ooh"
my life,"My life. My life, really feelin hard times. Lookin out my window, holdin my weapon like Malcolm X and. And it seems I'm over-stressin, feelin like hatin is your profession. And I know a couple Texans that got killed for over-reppin. So I never be oversteppin boundaries bounded to my weapon. When they ask me how I'm doin, I just tell 'em ""I'm doin super"". I got a date with Destiny, allow me to introduce ya. Her little sister Fate told me I'm gon' be the future. And legacy's everything to a Martin Luther King Koopa. This recession is so pathetic, got me feelin like I'm athletic. And success tryna get away from me and I ain't tryna let it. When they told that Pimp was gone, my reply was ""I don't get it"". And I'm still havin trouble believin it happened the way they said it. Had to cut some partners off, swear to y'all it ain't my fault. I've been grown since I was seven and I was born to be a boss. But I know there's a bunch of haters tryna see me take a loss. So I be sleepin with one eye open and put cameras in my vault. I've been thinkin and gettin deep and they tryna tell I been preachin. But I know that they can't see how much of the world that I be reachin. So stop reachin, stop leachin, I'ma fade 'em out like bleach and. In the spots where they can't get out to is the spots I visit frequent. Europe to UK and Germany, travellin currently. Made so much in millions that I could cash out in eternity. Accustomed to hittin customs with that duffle full of currency. When God created hustle, looked at the world and he inserted me... Koopa. [Hook: Chamillionaire] {X4}. I'm just livin my life, so cold. In the streets so I'm takin it slow. [Trae]. Uh, yeah. I'll tell you my story, I only speak the truth homie. It a terrible situation, throwed on the curb within the hands of time. But since I'm blistery breathing I guess a nigga livin fine. I live a life that's filled with dramatistic people cryin. And since the hood depend on me, they'll never lose a hand of mine (I gotcha). I'm paralysed when it come to the good times, I'm used to the pain. Feelin like a bum under the bridge, I'm so used to the rain. Anything I do is from the heart so it reflect my name. Forgive me for my sins father, I feel like I'm goin insane. Media criticising me for checking niggas, fuck it, oh well. I just wasn't raised a little pussy disrespected nigga. I'm tryna live on my own by the ways of a gangster. So every time I leave out I pray so I'm prayin for a gangster. It's bad enough the world we livin in all about money. Since we runnin out I choose to believe it ain't nothin funny. I've been stabbed in my back so much I deal with it. I'm tryna kick it with my life before heaven come chill with it. [Hook] {X4}. [Slim Thug]. Last year was a hard one but life goes on. Thinkin bout my nigga Pimp while I write this song. And the list goes on, all my niggas is gone. I'm tired of hearin bad news, scared to pick up my phone. Got a call, my nigga Eddy died from Acres home. Just seen him at my video shoot, now that shit wrong. Kelvo, Arborea, even my girl ShantÂŽ. I just heard word she got stabbed to death today. Dear Lord, I pray that you take away the pain. From their family and their friends, please help us change. Still warm my niggas sleep dog, stessle and stank. My girl Dee Dee, they got me pourin out my drank. It's fucked up, all my friends is dead or in the pen. Seem like soon as your life begin it's beginning to end. I'm frustrated, but you gotta smile, your time is dated. You never know when showin your love might be related, hah. [Hook] {X4}"
my money gets jealous,"Koopa I said I never cheat on my money. Its funny how hoes dont belive me. watch mad-hatter and cat-hatter. but gave it to me becouse I'm greedy. dont be touchin all on my money. cause that make me honey look sleazy. gettin paid is like good sex. becuse my money comes easy. my fat stack be the reason. nappy head hoes wanna trap me. they be like ""dont he look exactly like my son he the pappy"". haters be making my doe unhappy. you should gimme my props. for makin my cash the propa way. instead of comin up pop ya.

""My Money Get Jealous"". you never know me and mad-hatter might. take a flight to nevada right,. near the ring at the tyson fight. but I'm sitting next to evanders wife. never trick and throw this, no. rose pedals, no candle-light. if you want to see a ""G"". dont ask me go ask Vanna White. Koopa spend a grand at night. want a show I demand a price. thats right because I'm hott as a damn can. of Louisiana spice. never bite the hand that writes the checks. or you'll go broke. ugh could you see me grippin oak. or do you wish for me to choke. got to stay on your paper-chase. and get your change. because you dont know how long you'll last in this game. visions of twankies twisting while I'm grippin grain. this girl in the passenger seat.

I'm married to my change. and that will never change, man. [Chorus]. Dont blame us for visions of princess cuts on our fangas(fingers).

n luv wit my money,"(*Talking*). Ha-ha-ha-ha, right now you listening. To the greatest show on earth my nigga. Ha-ha, Chamillitary mayn. [Intro - 2x]. Oh yeah, still in love with my money yeah. If the world was sucka free. It would be just me, and my money next to me. [Hook]. Make that money mayn, watch the jealousy it shows. Watch your homies turn to traitors, your friends'll turn foes. Really can't complain, cause I'm making that do'. Even though I see some haters, just let 'em all know. I'm still in love with my do', (I'm still in love with my do'). I know you hate it (oh yeah), I know you hate it (oh yeah). They hate when you're successful, (they hate when you're successful). I know you hate it (oh yeah), I know you hate it (oh yeah). I'm still in love with my do'. [Chamillionaire]. I'm still squeezing grain, through the drama some things done changed. All my homies got rearranged, nothing changed about me but change. So bring the change but you can leave the laim, Chamillitary nigga see the chain. Pointing fingers like we to blame, cause gimic rappers gotta leave the game. Yes ma'am gotta get grands, eliminate niggaz in the way of my plans. All the real fans staying my fans, realized I was in the way of my damn self. I'm the truth, I got ghetto to ghetto jamming it. Get the respect that Cham can get, then you can say I am the shit. A lot of niggaz be talking big, but they out there lying about they life. But then they'd end up getting exposed, like they weren't lying about it right. Picture me crying about a price, I'm rich ain't crying about a flight. I get respect in every city, that I'm flying up out at night. Now I'm the biggest seller, you can tell I make a profit. Bracelet looking yella, and you'll never ever stop it. Put yellow in the bezel, get your bread up try and cop it. Instead of a vendetta, just do better try and top it. [Hook]. [Chamillionaire]. No mo' swangas and vogues B. I'm on to larger things, (on to larger things mm-hmm). Still the same, but the safe changed. That's just a part of the game, (just a part of the game mm-hmm). You can't complain, cause it comes with fame. You gotta charge it to the game, (gotta charge it to the game mm-hmm). But I'll be damned, if I don't do my thang. And make 'em all feel the pain, (make 'em all feel the pain mm-hmm). Hol' up hold up a second no, they faking and had the do'. They fake as the Phantom Rolls, they claiming to having flows. They claim it don't have it though, they aching and mad to know. They saying that Cham'll blow, they hating and nan a show. Faggots and slamming cabinets, mad at me cause I'm grabbing it. Mad at me cause I'm slabbing it, candy paint it then Davin it. (Damn it then how you handle it), I handle it how I handle it. Mad at me cause I'm having it, while they only imagine it. I'm hearing these rappers talking, but I'm not even a fan of it. Even if the whole planet, and thousand of suckas jamming it. You can speak what you speaking, like I won't speak up and challenge it. Handle up in my hand to get, pointed like I demand respect. You standing on ya own two feet, them haters never caught you. They getting it how you getting it, you still getting it when they start to. They ain't living it how you living it, won't admit it they just gon argue. Cause you getting paid in full, while they still getting paid it costs you. [Hook]. (*talking*). At a time when it's all eyes on me, all I can do is be me. A nigga, that ain't never scared to say what he see. A hundred percent realer, than you will ever be. Ha-ha, Chamillitary mayn"
no snitchin',"(Chorus). This is for my gangstas,real niggas,ballas,trill niggas. North side,South side,chunk ya deuce up. This is for my gangstas,real niggas,ballas,trill niggas. East side,West side,chunk ya deuce up. (Verse 1). Plenty niggas get they head turned red for da bread. Start off with da information,load it up in ya head. Couldnt hold it,so it turned out its sumthin he said. Wut he tell da FEDS (he need someone to call). Your decision was to snitch and they was there to listen. When he told what he know,said they barely was trippin. Less time,now da niggas in a better position. Unless you count the fact that the streets know he was snitchin. He was lookin at a 30 but he only did 10,how your years turn to months,can he tell you dat, and. He aint really gotta answer,just the sweat in his hands. Will he make it out to make it,mmm well it depends. Everybody know the info you was tellin ya friends. Plus the streets know the deals that you made with the pen. Russian Roulette,yep nigga bet the barrel will spin. You hear that,yea nigga thats the sound of revenge. (Hook). Walk down the right road,cuz the streets is so cold. You betta take ya life slow or you'll miss it. Listen to da G-Code,if you know what i kno-oooow,then you'll keep yo mouth closed. We dont tolerate snitches. (Chorus). (Verse 2). If you gon live that crime life,i hope you hold dat 9 tight. You live life like a pussy then dats prolly what you die like. I neva eva loved a sucka,them aint really my type. Rat snakes,yea mayne the game is full of wild-life. Dont wanna do no time right?. You wanna live that high life. Like go withdrawl,have a hundred thousand in ya eye sight. Enter ya crib,see the clouds peepin through ya skylight. You be a copycat,(???),cuz mine right. Thats what he told me but i didnt listen. Doin crime for a dime wasnt my intention. You insane,think his name sumin i will mention. Only snitches need someone to tell. Alota niggas in the game,hustlin doin they thing. Usin codes on the phone with they usual slang. If you know what he know then you wont say a thing. You wouldnt need someone to tell. Careful bout the life you lead,aint smart with ya life,you plead,the streets will ignite ya T,like you aint got the right to breathe. (Cough)To choke on da realness,reality is what the fake dont know how to deal with. Words leak from the teeth,but he'll say seal it. Then go get a undercover brother he can chill with. Find a nigga that be hustlin to make a deal with. But the streets will hold court for him and'll deal with it. (Hook). (Chorus). (Verse 3). This for the G's,street jugglin,move da fire. When you talkin what you talkin it aint through the wire. Police pull you over,now they callin you a liar. You got amnesia,dont even know the dude beside ya. You dont know,you aint sayin,you aint heard what he said. Told you a closed mouth aint gon neva get fed. A open mouth'll get you county instead of the FEDS. Some scared niggas speak up so they'll be less in the red. Niggas cant deal with no 95 so they day-to-day budgeters. Its the hustlers that get put away by the customers.

But make a snitch turn to puff with a flick of the wrist. That aint gon get in arguements,just go get you a clip. And they gon think about the consequences,let em repent. (Hook). (Chorus). (Talking).

ochie wally,"A-Keem drunk gleam. Unlock, pop the scene. Kickers soundin' like my trunk just swallowed a soccer-team. The candy-berry drop. Sittin' outside the Merriot. Is what got ya miss very hot. Tryna give me the hairy spot. My album ain't barely drop. I don't live on a fairy block. A scary block, where niggas get buried and carry glocks. Niggas be frontin' like they brave, cuz scary niggas get shot. Bullets be in the glock, talkin' bout ""ay let me out"". Hold up..If you can prove I ain't the throwedest on the streets. Then stand up, right now go ahead and speak ya peace. Anybody? Okay, unanimous vote. We all agree that every time he touch the mic it get broke. Choke the chord til' it smoke. And don't get Twin pissed. He'll put the heater to ya lips and you'll wish that he missed. I hope you get my drift while I un-twist the Crist'. Lookin' like a poisonous light-bulb bit my wrist. I'm showing so much green, I'm glowin' so picture me. As a iced-out ghetto, statue of liberty. ""Chamillion don't spit for free. That nigga turned down a G. I sent hI'm the deposit, he sent it right back to me"". For the record, Chamillion wreck-it. I wreck it so don't eject it. Disrespect have ya girl at the hotel showin' naked. Get it right dawg correct it. I got this rap game perfected. Detect the women went blind when my necklace reflected. Wood-grain got molested, does this mean I'm peverted?. Ya feelings got hurted, she want me to insert and squirt it. She wanted to make love to my voice, the first time she heard it. Look, don't touch me, to broke hoes I'm allergic. The jury was the verdict. Chamillionaire is guilty. Of being, off the hook, off the heezie-fa-sheezy filty. Bitch, get off the dick, this the Boss Hogg year. Nigga we all floss here, poof-pow disappear. Whoo!"
outro,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top. They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about. When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop. But this the sound of revenge. Yea. On the path to find out who's true. The only person you can really trust is you. And if you feel like you can't even trust you. Then you can always trust you know who. And if you don't know who you know who is. Then I feel so sorry for you. Cause that's really the only person that can judge you. Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do. Shouldn't do and must do. But when you got that glow. Nobody else's words can really budge you. Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin. And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win. Sometime it sound like :gunshot:. Is what it coulda been. When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in. But ya change that meanin up and success is what it is in the end. And instead of worryin about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been. Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it mov-in. Know what I'm sayin?. Well say it again. Keep it mov-in. Know what I'm sayin?. Screw it then. Know what I'm sayin?. If you're waitin for me to fail, your time is runnin out on that clock. I'm runnin to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop. Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got. It's the sound of revenge"
overnight,"[Hook]. Stay chasing payments. Hard times done changed in. I can't be slaving now. Ain't do this overnight. I know you're thinking. This life is really amazing. Ain't do this overnight. Look at all the non-sense I've been through. So called beef with you know who. Did it myself why don't you. Why don't you. Ain't do this overnight. Don't expect help when it all fall through. Everyone will tell you it's all on you. Fight or run what you gonna do. What you gonna. Ain't do this overnight. [Verse 1]. Everybody saying that they want the life. But everybody thinking that it's overnight. They say you want to win but you know the price. Ain't do this overnight. Have a little chick that was known to gripe. Early in the morn I was on the flight. I don't really know if it was wrong or right. But I Ain't do this overnight. Always did it big way before the hype. I'm just trying to live let me roll the dice. Gotta be the boss can I own my life?. Ain't do this overnight. But wanna tell me this shit for show my type. My jewelry looking like I just went on a heist. Garage full of SUV's and motorbikes. See I always realized that it was more to life. Now I'm back to this I'm on rapping trips. Classy chicks that wanna have a kiss. When I was walking in the mailbox etcetera. With the stacking chips that share packet jets. Had a bucket list to get a platinum wrist. Have platinum shift and get a platinum disc. Was a level I ain't even have to hit. You isn't there you ain't even done half of this. And now they tellin me they really want the old school back. But where was you at when the old school act. Got exposed to crack for the local rats who were laughing. When they saw the tires go to flat. Tell my enemies that I was born to win. I bet you never go against the boy again. You a historian go check the facts. I ain't going back, keep your DeLorean. [Hook]. Stay chasing payments. Hard times done changed in. I can't be slaving now. Ain't do this overnight. I know you're thinking. This life is really amazing. Ain't do this overnight. Look at all the non-sense I've been through.

Fight or run what you gonna do. What you gonna. Ain't do this overnight. [Verse 2]. Lost a label then made a label. My partner tried to be Cain and Abel. Y'all see what sipping that Haterade do. Ain't do this overnight. They tried to say, you let money change you. I wasn't never no perfect angel. But you lazy acting like you disabled. Ain't do this overnight. This decision is proving fatal. Time you spent away might decay you. I see myself in that XXL and Source magazine. on that coffee table. 9 to 5, till that job betray you. Playing your moves until day delay you. Most of record companies hate to pay you. But your lawyer gotta get paid to save you. I work the feet I don't work for free. There's no limit you would think purchase me. What works for them just don't work for me. So don't purchase one just go purchase three. Now they say the game is in surgery. They need a doctor so they insert for me. I put on the gloves and insert the needle. Hope I'm executing this perfectly. Now I'm feeling like it's back to the basics. Feel like I'mma make it out the matrix. Don't believe me just watch. Can't see it then you better get LASEK. Make this money but I never let the money make me. Hey money, tell me what you done for me lately. See me and you ain't even cut from the same tree. Same cloth, I'm a boss, let 'em see in HD. [Hook]. Stay chasing payments. Hard times done changed in. I can't be slaving now. Ain't do this overnight. I know you're thinking.

pound cake (freestyle),"(verse 1). Couple investments a few of em made some major sense. Keep ya two pennies especially if you ain't made a cent. I learned the game and been getting publishing ever since. People that ain't made a dollar will say they ain't convinced. When you ride to 7 11 on some handle bars. You can't vision how catchy hooks could take a man to mars. The problem is that y'all only just wanna hang wit stars. Heard lauryn sing and wanted to take the world from nas. I salute but I still demand applause. I've given infinite gifts I still feel like santa clause. Males acting like girls I call it mano pause. This the type of verse. That I bet you that type of man would pause. I can't stop and give the hataz what they ask for. 99 Thousand or more inside the cash drawer. I'm the type to keep a passport on the dashboard. Looking for a south of france shore to make a dash for. Feeling like damon dash been moving that a cappellas. When times is bleek I hit the freeway like its rockefella. It's been a decade get a clue that you could stop me never. You'd have a better chance of trying to stop a hot propeller. On a jet while smoking a cigarette wit gasoline on ya hands. Carosine on ya breath. Oh yes I do it the best get verses then you are blessed. I do it for what it's worth and ill never do it for less. Stress never that I know the album is more than late. Looked quantity in the face and told it you're gonna wait. Send a salute to the people. Who push the culture straight and those who culture hate. I just hope you don't get to procreate. Met with some rappers that industry people over rate. Met with the devil but said I wouldnt negotiate. Lyor made millions jay made millions. And if cham made millions I'm feelin' like I can sure relate. Killa see mr koopa got em quite jealous. People that hang wit mr koopa turn to sky dwellers. I'm from a city where the skinny turn to pie sellers. And if any say they making millis then they lie tellers. Preach the struggle will never cease. Your struggle look like a puddle. My struggle look like a sheesh. I'm visualizing it clear like I'm mr michael artis. It's either jackson or jordan I feel like michael on beats. Coulda been on a beach, instead I turnt to a beast. The clarity of my raps you'd think I created speech. Saw me dirty my cleats all over these houston streets. The hundreds stay in my reach. the money stay on a leash. (*bark) I know you hear them dogs barkin'. That hype beasting is in houston what we call boppin. I make I'm pay for all my words like its a blog auction. And go daddy what she tells me when we blog shopping. I'm the type to make it and give it a fee. And you the type that make it they wouldn't take it for free. They look at you and they like tell me whats in it for me. & wouldn't take ya disc. If you put it under their christmas tree. Me, lets talk about consistency. Consistently make em feel. Like these other rappers ain't sick as me. I'm currently in city they'll never get to see. The only suite that they'll ever see is a pack of swishas g. My og be callin me to say the streets miss me. He know im eatin' but the reason is I eat picky. Like play station they pump fakin' and you'll see quickly. The game switched they'll always end up wit a 360. Albums coming I tell the doubters just wait till then. Shot videos and you know that I'd never waste a lenz. They sleeping on me could hope. That they never wake again. But they gotta be sleep. When you're planning a rude awakening. (verse). Hey yo texas you know the puzzles what I had to solve. Ya prodigy be bringing havoc like I had a mob. Had 3 enemies so them odds what I had to dodge. And now im riding in cars that look like avatars. They ain't never had the soft never had the hard. They try to make it sound deep pretend they have a cause. Pushing them yellow bricks no. That's where you have to pause. Most of em cowardly & lion like the man on oz. They lyin to you falsifying within their little bars. They'd probably try to tell you tommy really had a job. Tell you how they had to starve and how they had rob. Like I went to heaven. And took a blessing from the hand of god. Nah. Sorry I don't don't believe it. don't believe what ya reading. Who the ones that achieved it. not them we did. Irrelevance is as reverent. As the person that said it. And you ain't never did anything don't you ever forget it. That dialogue you can dead it. You borrow your mothers car. And put half a tank of unleaded"
put on for houston,"[Intro:]. Chamillitary Mayne. Mixtape Messiah August 27th. Put that on your calendar. It's Chamilliona-I mean Koopa. A.K.A. Major Pain, Cuz I'ma bring The Majors Pain. Mixtape Mass Of The Underground....Bang. They ask me where Texas at, and I say hold that thought, August 27th I'ma get to that. You need to die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. I've been showing support to all the labels in my city and right now it's all about Chamilli. . [Verse 1:]. Yeah!. When they see me do my magic they say ""what the heck is Koopa on?"". Texas been too quite so the X-Men 'bout to produce a storm. Etither die a hero or the villain is what you become. Hop in in my Batmobile I ch-ch-churp the Koopa 'larm. Salad dressing cuz it's on plenty green and parmesian. In my pockets in my palm I'ma bout to drop a bomb. Thinking of making vegetatian I'm the mixtape farmer John. So much green inside my jeans it's like I've been out mowing lawns. I'm the real the rest is fake, I'm the best the rest is cake. Mixtape god I bless this tape and I put boys in they resting place. People always test the type an they don't never test the face. That's the day I'ma be on TMZ and the day I catch a case. Think that you can take my auto when them hollows not gon' follow. Better dream of bikini wearin ""Genie Out The Bottle"". Some chicks that use to strip ask to wax the Maserato. I say forget the wax just make it quick just like Sorado. Got a spanish chick that loves the chip she the Dorito lady. She ready to Frito-Lay me ""el gusto es mio baby"". I hear some sharks talkin like they gonna D.O.A. me. Go head jump in that water promise there's torpedos waiting. I dropped a lot of verses but I know I'm proud of mines. I see the presidents in front of me I'm Obama-tized. Rappers is politicians, they all be talking lies. Paparazzi like some Nazi pop your posse like some spies. I use to look around me like ""it's proabably you that hate me"". Now I open up my wallet and it start illuminating. Do your damage do it talk your talk and mutilate me. Money talks, me and Ben always communicating. I know your probably thinkin why he talkin all that cash. I write my lyrics in the crib as big as Carlton's dad's. Was happy broke but super rich they be like boy he mad. Every problem I had last year my money brought me all of that. Push foreigns like a chauffeur, stomp all the cock-a-roacha. But back when I was broke-a I sold product like a broker. My next one drop it's over, point out somebody doper. I bet that supersoaker flip that joker like it's poker. Your boy ain't half of me, turn him to a casualty. Humble but I swear I'm not Barack Obama's pastor see. I be talkin trash yeah the mouth is a catastophy. Don't mistake the humbleness for weakness cuz that's blasphemy. . [Chorus:]. I put on some Chamilli on on some Chamilli. I put on some Chamilli on on some Chamilli. I put on East Side. I put on Southside. I put on Westside. I put on Chamillitary Mayne!. I put on some Chamilli on on some Chamilli. I put on some Chamilli on on some Chamilli. I put on East Side. I put on Southside. I put on Westside. I put on Chamillitary Mayne!. . [Verse 2:]. This weapon that stay attached to me is grazing your anatomy. This grey one will make you call a doctor call up ""Grey's Anotomy"". I be pushin cars out the garage like it's a factory. Service with a smile serve a hatin rapper happily. Never miss a penny you can't count your doe exact as me. Push come to shove I'm picking up money just like a vaccum G. Always makin doe, got a bunch of Keiblers after me. Pro at being active like what Puffy use for Ac-a-ne. If you rep that Texas I knooow, that ya feel me. Wanna pop lock and dance then put oooon that ""Get Silly"". Wanna dance 'til ya sweaty put oooon that P. Diddy. Tryna take the mixtape market put oooon that Chamilli, eh"

And she say my bank account got like a hundred thousand commas. Making stacks on top of stacks. And really it couldn't be nothing lesser. If she say she got brain then I guess I'll be her professor. And if you got racks on racks. Then I stack dressers up on dressers. Cause my pockets stay on max. Your pockets must be on compresser. Betcha I'm a money catcher. This is something you can't measure. Stacks ain't human if it was they'd be the fattest heffa ever. Once I put em all together where your jeweller please go tell her, see me rocs be throwin up he must be signed to rocafella. When you pull up in your ride they be that ain't nothin special. When I pull up to valet they say hey look how god has blessed ya. They think it's a submarine tryna figure out the vessel. Call it uncle panamera next to that I got it's nephew. Got a firm verizon celly. Got a chain and it's so heavy. Got a kit under the chevy. Crib like the amex on pelly. I be always fresh as veggie.

I got a So So sickening flow, six-oh-six-fo'-fo'. Tryin to get to my crib, Westside Chicago (there it go). Atlanta where I live, nigga got mo' than one residence. I'm the undertaker, for them dead Presidents. I gave 'em two and a half, I been behind that fence. Threw on an ankle monitor, on parole, then probation seven mo' years. I ain't got no mo' piss for 'em, my fear gone. Strong, 'bout to show 'em how the fuck I come home. Jumpin on e'rything I can get on, spit on. Gettin down and dirty well I'm bound to get my grit on. Bottle hustle hard, 'bout to buy two, three mo' cars. Grand open my club, let me empty out the whole bar. The next stop is Magic (yup) City we stop traffic. Police escort we got it, gone I'm showin out and I'm laughin. Some faces lookin shitty, cause they can't do what we do (never). I'm a make it, make it, rain, for me and you.

Way back in 2004, I told 'em it was a wrap. Now my life ain't my life no more, I told you, nigga, it's a wrap. OOh, you claim you a dog, my nigga, I'm the vet. We can't even talk 'less you got the check, I guess that's why all of these niggas get bent. They said ""Fuck a young nigga, fuck a young nigga"". I know it's some girls in the crowd right now who wanna fuck a young nigga. I roll one and roll another one bigger. Niggas thinkin' they sick, well, I'm sicker. I'm a smoke my weed and I'm a drink my liquor. Better make sure you fuck your girl right 'fore I dick her. Down. [Twista:]. Everybody wanna hate because I'm on, blowin' head back, bottles by the zone. Twista finna get up on the track and spit it the way I do simp-a-ly because I like this song.

Oh, Twista, I see your future, finna shoot ya, I salute you if you could get at the general in my military. Racks and racks and tracks and stacks and gats, I could destroy an entire village when I kill and bury. 'Cause I manipulate your molecular structure, other words, fill 'em up with' holes.

rain,"[Talking]. I was sitting back, and I was thinking man. I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know. Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know. Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man. Nigga take two steps back, you feel me. [Chamillionaire]. They told me that pain was just in the frame, the. irony of that. Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats. Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact. Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat. Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps. To help with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed. Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats. Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat. And that one tire, left a sign of hope. That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda. broke. That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk. That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your. throat. Don't choke, you feeling like giving up. Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living. sucks. God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna. give him trust. Mama telling you pay your ties, and you yell at her. back for what. Wrong: To the path took a ride fast,Right: So the. pastor can ride faster, to get some rims on his truck. I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of. negative bucks. Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will. start to drown. But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back. around damn. [Hook: Billy Cook]. Keep your head up is what they telling me, what it. gotta be. Sorry but the world keeps stressing me, rain drops. round up the memories. It's gonna be alright is what they telling me, don't. let the stress get the best. of me. Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me, till. my heaven gets cloudy bout. a memory. [Scarface]. God knows, how I feel now. On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he. hell bound. It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of. it. Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing. I took the time out, to save a little bread. Now my eyes, got water in em. Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me. I ain't happy here. My mama said, she can't handle him. But still, I'm looking at the bright side. But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a. different color sky. Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may. never come. So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun. End it all, put a stop to the pain. That goes on in my head, everytime it rains. But that was speaking, so you listening to the. thoughts. Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk. I'm confused, by my psychological set backs. In the storm, watching out through the wet cracks. Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places. I've given up so all long faces, let it rain. [Hook]. [Chamillionaire]. Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer. Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on. your nerves. Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the. third. Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't. believing a word. Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as. steel. Not to mention the realest member, of your family is. getting ill. Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real. In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to. kneel. To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama. You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a. plumber. They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you. stronger. You'd have to be a Superman, to lift as much as me. partna. (Could tell you stay strong) you're trying, but help. is just what you doubting. Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to. drying. The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people. lying. They saying they had it worse, but how come they all. keep on smiling. [Hook]. [Billy Cook]. Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I. know. I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x. [Hook]. [singing]. My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah. Stressing me-stressing me, my memories. That's what they telling me. I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me. By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah. [talking]. When it seems like nothing but dark clouds. Are raining in on your bright, sunny day. Remember, the sunlight always comes after the rain. You should be thankful, everyday"
ran out of auto-tune,"Left wing in my crib there's a model room. Right wing there's a room just for Almond Spoons. I sing on this track that's what they assume. Sorry but my engineer ran out of autotune. You rap but I feel that you are a coon. And the other one's that ain't coon are a foons. Try me, and you will fail in the arms of doom. Cause that V-ve-Venom album coming soon. Fifty thousand dollar fresh in my living room. Try to steal it and I bet you won't lit a noon. Put the camera on ya chick like I'm Benny Boom. And then I hit her quick vroom, vroom. Ya girl say she love me cause I'm cool and laid back. Then she wanna do (what?) I said cool and lay back. Perpetrator vision I see through they facts. All these rappers sweeter than some Kool-Aid packs. My Lincoln longer than two Maybachs. My front yard longer than two race tracks. Hearing them but'chu know they goin use they gats. I don't be hanging with none of them dudes, they wack. (they wack). She was speaking in a whisper like Shawday. Well I call her never yes I told her probably. Paparazzi you better do what I say. To me a face like a camera to Kanye. If you late on my team you know docked. If I'm late you goin wait till I move out. Got'cha chick bout to take off her tube-top.

Tell me what you wanna know, and I can lyrically give you a interview. Koopa it's been a minute fool, but the streets of the South say they feeling you. Tell me what you wanna know, and I can lyrically give you a interview. Well one, why do these wanna be ass suckers be on your dick. Cause being fake is in they blood, can't stick with one click so they switch. Two, why the hell these boys keep talking like you gon fail. Cause they think that bar been raised so high, that I can't match them sales. (well can you) yeah nigga just wait and see, you got property you better watch for me. Cause I buy that land that you living on, and sell it right back to you like monopoly. Question three, who producing your album man. Scott Storch, Beat Bullies, Mannie Fresh, Cool & Dre. And the list goes on pimping I'm coming down, hundred miles and I'm gunning. Loud ass speakers growl when they humming, Chamillitary the sound that they summing. One and nothing talking down when I'm not around, got nothing but bad words. You thinking you bad but Cham worse, you couldn't even F' with a damn verse. Plus you must be on that stuff, got em pissing they Pampers. See me pull up on 24's, your hoe horny like antlers. (*talking*). They messing with you my nigga, but I ain't gotta tell you that.

Realest nigga in it, when I'm riding it be tinted. And the trunk looks like it's dented, cause the bass is at it's limit. Them niggaz they be talking, but them niggaz they don't live it. Said it in a sentence, they might say how they distribute. When you see em they be timid, they ain't even independent. They be living with they mama, man these niggaz full of drama. They might smoke some marijuana, but won't get up off they ass. Till I come down in my slab, posted up behind that glass. Texas what it is, light reflection on my wrist. Looking like a section, of the complexion on my chick. I don't need a click, all I need's a extra clip. Let them twenty bullets rip, and twenty niggaz flip. In this verse I'm so legit, I don't care what nigga you with. When you speak talk with a purpose, or don't open up your lip. (*talking*). Boys is out of line, this how we gon do it in 2005. We coming nigga, ha-ha whoa you all listening to the Man on Fire. DJ Smallz/Chamillionaire callabo, you already know. I might be moving too fast for em, so let me slow it up. So they can catch up with me, that's what it is. [Hook]. [Chamillionaire]. Houston been doing it back, since Screwed Up rap wasn't rap. Now Chamillionaire is back, to put that fact on the map. Lil' flicking ass niggaz, fix your act or get slapped. We keep hollows up in them holsters, get a package of blap. You could tell by the way the Texas logo, sit above the brim. I'm quick to tell a chick, to go and get another friend. If her attitude is right, she can have some fun and swim. Or I'll send her back board, like the glass above the rim. Yeah, I gotta keep it in control. New Yorkers say I'm nice, Texas niggaz say I'm thoed. From Blue-Blues to Saigon, to Joe Budden and Southern Flows. Don't matter what I'm sold, the streets saying that I'm cold. Down here the music slowed, po' a fo' in that cola. Fifth wheel falling back, my bumper kit in a coma. Couple friendly ass suckers, getting boulder and boulder. They telling me that they ready to get em, like Pimp C I'm like hol' up-hol' up. (*talking*). Yeah, it's Chamillionaire the Mix Tape Messiah. And right now, I am the Man on Fire. Representing for Houston Texas, invading the air waves. On the official Chamillionaire mix tape. This a Fear Factor Music, slash Southern Smoke. Slash Chamillitary, slash Beat Yo Ass production man. Ha-ha, bout to take it to the next level on this one. Ay Smallz, let's give em another exclusive to brag about man. (you ain't ready, I run these streets)"
"reign fall (feat. scarface, killer mike & bobby moon)","[Intro: Killer Mike (Chamillionaire) ]. (They just want to see the rain falling). All the fallen soldiers. Love ya'll man, miss ya'll. But we can't look back we gotta look ahead. (They just want to see the rain falling. Ain't no cloudy days, in a world so gray). Here we go. [Verse 1: Chamillionaire (Singing) ]. They just want to see the weather falling on my crown. I just hope to never let you down (Rain falling. They just want to see the rain falling. But ain't no cloudy days, in a world so gray). Look up, I can see the weather dropping to the ground. I just hope you never let me drown, drown. (They just want to see the rain falling. But ain't no cloudy days, even headed my way). I'm trying to take a tres, and flip it to a seis. Cause real recognize real then you sure look out of place. They took out all the greats, they want them all replaced. They try to tell me it's curtains, I open all the drapes. Like ""Lord, let the sun shine while your son shine"". Might be a gateway into heaven, but it's one line. And I'm a soldier, loyal is the only way I know. Sincerely yours, the Chamillitary G. I. Joe. See life chose us, but we chose the life we living. We speak with fate then we say those are likely written. Snakes come with the cake, Oh looks like he's bitten. Your life's a gift but I'm like ""Who knows if life's a given? "". Dress casual at birth, at death we wearing suits. Feel like it's a special occasion if you want the truth. They say forgive your enemies but if we never truce. A born sinner so at least I didn't forget my roots. [Hook: Chamillionaire (Bobby Moon) ]. (Falling) Rain falling (Just keep on calling) Rain falling. They just want to see the rain falling. But ain't no cloudy days, in a world so gray. (Falling) Rain falling (Just keep on calling for me). They just want to see the rain falling. But ain't no cloudy days, even headed my way. [Verse 2: Chamillionaire]. We look around and see nobody left to idolize. Cause we just waiting till these newer guys run out of lies. Exaggerated all the rumor talk of our demise. Then we rise up just like ""What's up? "" and they apologize. Surprise, the storm is coming so I wish you luck. Protect yourself. cause if you don't then you might self-destruct. Go 'head and live it up, make sure you live enough. Pour out some liquor for the soldiers that didn't get to duck. 'Sup. [Hook: Chamillionaire (Bobby Moon) ]. (Falling) Rain falling (Just keep on calling) Rain falling. They just want to see the rain falling. But ain't no cloudy days, in a world so gray. (Falling) Rain falling (Just keep on calling for me). They just want to see the rain falling. But ain't no cloudy days, even headed my way. [Verse 3: Scarface]. (Talking). Yeah without you it's moving forward. And all of a sudden you realize. you was going backwards man. Kinda like how my whole life has been. So I'm gonna take some time out and give it to you. Yeah. If there's a heaven up above, show a nigga love. Cause I been struggling in blood,. trying to make it back to where I was. I shed a tear for the lost souls, caught up in the street life. Living fast, die young, ya'll know what them streets like. Ain't nothing new we going through it day to day. Doing bad in the hood, broke as fuck, so it's hard to brave. We hustle harder yet the cops keep calling. And they Glocks keep clicking,. we cannot keep falling, nigga. [Verse 4: Killer Mike]. I started small time, dope game, cocaine. Getting schooled by the OG's of the game, mayne. I got the jewelry and the shit that came with rolling hard. I got jammed with the toaster, and I took a charge. The prosecutor tried to hit me with a sweet deal. I told that bitch to suck a dick like it's a sweet meal. My character hold no resemblance to a damn rat. So I refuse to be used by a pussycat. A nigga judge gave a young nigga 10 years. My baby mama cried 10 times harder tears. 100 nights in the cell I've cried too. My mama died last year, I kinda wish I died too. But I can't, I gotta be here for my baby daughter. Niggas that up doing time for her won't even pay the lawyer. And I'm stressing and depressing on this crazy drama. OG flexin' trying to fuck a nigga baby mama. [Hook: Chamillionaire (Bobby Moon) {Scarface Talking} ]. (Falling) Rain falling (Just keep on calling) Rain falling. They just want to see the rain falling. But ain't no cloudy days, in a world so gray. (Falling) Rain falling (Just keep on calling for me). {Hey, words from the wise, always look ahead}. They just want to see the rain falling {Never look behind}. But ain't no cloudy days, even headed my way. {What happened yesterday is done}. {Make your next move your best move}"
rider,"(*talking*). Yeah, (tell 'em the name) Chamillitary mayn ha-ha. When it seems like haters make up 90 percent of the population. And your name, is always the subject of a hater's conversation. How do you dwal with the situation, most people call it hating. But a rider, can use it as fuel and motivation. Allow me to do a demonstration, (do that then). This the rider's anthem, let's ride let's ride. [Hook]. I'm a riiiii-iiiii-der, I'm a rider. I'm too tough for y'all, and I will never fall. You can talk that talk, but I'ma walk that walk. And I'm riding, that's fa sho. I'm a surviiiii-iiii-vor, true survivor. If I walk out that do', and don't come back no mo'. Let the liquor po', and let the people know. I was a rider, that's fa sho. [Chamillionaire]. We them niggaz getting hated by haters, we them niggaz that done made it outrageous. Stack the money in the streets nothing honey nothing sweet, I'm sick my chips contagious. Animals none of y'all can't cage us, got me feeling like the Heat and the Lakers. Had to switch up my team but what do ya mean, we already traded them traitors. Spend a lifetime surrounded by fakers, in the night time you high cause it's safer. Spend a lifetime to grind and get paper, while all y'all crying I'm flying to Jamaica. Grinding steadily fine and cheddar he, know how to show ya the nine is deadly. Wanna be a pussy nigga fine then let it be, anybody crying that's around it's never me. Realer than the rest when it come to plex, get it off your chest if you so upset. Is that what it gon be if it comes to yes, then I guess that day will become a mess. They messed up when they told me the sky's the limit, cause I'm married to my money nigga I'm committed. If it's gold at the end of the rainbow then my gang go, get up in the vehicles and ride to get it. I'm a nigga that made it up from the bottom, I'm a always get into a lil' drama. Y'all don't know what it means to be a rider, gotta deal with anybody that got a problem. I'ma put supreme in the Impala, I'ma put some cream up in the bomber. Jack it that's it nigga go get a dollar, looking for me I'm busy my nigga holla. [Hook]. [Chamillionaire]. Got the weight on my shoulder like solo flex, do the drama myself that's solo plex. I don't know what you do fo' yo checks, but my part of the do' way mo' they less. I'm gripping wood I know I'm fresh, cause I am that CEO and yes. The mo' I make they more upset, but I'll be damned if a nigga don't show respect. Ask the streets in the South about the kid, and they gon tell ya I be doing my thang. We could do the beef or we could do the peace, as long as you ain't speaking my name. My partna told me you was jocking homie, and my other boy said the same. The result of that when I approached the cat, I gotta hit him with the pain like bang-bang. Physically and mentally, a rider a nigga that'll tell 'em see. I bomb on your ass it was meant to be, because I told y'all niggaz not to mess with me. Do you let the beef slide, and let it die down with all your deciding. In the streets they know Cha-millionaire be riding, Batman my heat riding like Robin. Tell 'em that I got 'em if he's on my team, cause loyalty's something that you're gonna need. Loyalty's something others don't believe, like a ghost that most suckers ain't known to seen. But you know that a rider can notice hating, and use it to fuel all the motivation. Success is something that's fa sho to make em, back down they don't then I'm gonna break em. [Hook]. [Chamillionaire]. If you a rider let me know, (yeah I'm a rider that's fa sho). If you a rider let me know, (yeah I'm a rider that's fa sho). If you a rider let me know, (yeah I'm a rider that's fa sho). Get in the car and let's go, go, go, go - 2x"

ridin' overseas,"[Chamillionaire]. I'm looking in my rearview.... I can see a clearer view of you... (This is the remix!) I see you waiting, I know you hate it.... [Akon - Hook] (Chamillionaire). I see them watching, they waiting,. For an oppurtunity to ride up on me,. Hopin' they don't roll up on me, cuz today I'm ridin' dirty,. And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight!. I see them watching, and waiting,. For an oppurtunity to ride up on me,. Hopin' they don't roll up on me, cuz today I'm ridin' dirty, (Cheah!). And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight! (C'mon!). [Chamillionaire - Verse 1]. I got twenty grand in my pocket and, I'm riding round with my pockets crammed,. You the one that got the contraband, you smokin' that like you in Amsterdam,. Before I know it, I see them sirens, I'm pullin' over, ""Hey, we just ridin'!"",. ""Don't talk back, won't be no violence, just shut up and sit in your seat in silence"",. Now the police is searching who, they searching me and then they searching you,. They smell the breeze and you smell like trees, cuz you hit the blunt, and you hit the purple too,. Now the lie is irreversible, cuz you just told them we was riding clean,. They question you but they ain't question me yet, I'm thinking the police ain't find a thing,. (Yup) Standing on the side of the freeway, wishing they would just hurry up,. And I can see him walkin' up to me like he about put me up in 'em cuffs,. I turn around and I look at you, and you turn away like you feelin' sick,. I'm going to jail for what I didn't commit, I must admit that I hate a snitch.... [Akon - Hook]. I see them watching, they waiting,. For an oppurtunity to ride up on me,. Hopin' they don't roll up on me, cuz today I'm ridin' dirty,. And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight!. I see them watching, and waiting,. For an oppurtunity to ride up on me,. Hopin' they don't roll up on me, cuz today I'm ridin' dirty,. And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight!. [Chamillionaire - Verse 2]. Ever since they heard the song 'Ridin Dirty', the whole world been listening, I'm glad you heard me,. Some cops that representing the badge assure me, every cop ain't bad or tryna scare me,. A year later, after 'White 'n Nerdy', on the grind, still tryin', still flyin' birdies,. That stuff in your cuff still drivin' swervy, ridin' dirty like a vehicle inside the Derby,. A little inspired by UGK, and the rest inspired by the life I'm living,. Seen that Impala, he was drunk and that's when I saw the red lights go get him,. And it's ironic that during the chase, he murdered Chase, and this kid was Christian,. Movin' target went across the street and unfortunately the car didn't miss him,. And now the family is soon to know, that they gone have to do another funeral,. The angels ain't singing to your tune no more, don't move too fast, baby, move it slow.... Cuz one day in here, baby... Next thing you know,. Next thing you know, everything you used to move don't move no mo'!. [Akon - Hook] (Chamillionaire). I see them watching, they waiting,. For an oppurtunity to ride up on me,. Hopin' they don't roll up on me, cuz today I'm ridin' dirty,. And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight!. I see them watching, and waiting,. For an oppurtunity to ride up on me, (This is not a movie, it's real life!). Hopin' they don't roll up on me, cuz today I'm ridin' dirty,. And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight!. [Chamillionaire]. It's real life... It ain't just a song, it's a message..... Nobody ever opens their eyes 'till someone gets killed.... Rest In Peace to Sean Bell..... Chamillitary man!"

Pretty ass vehicle with a neck full of diamonds. But keep too close and I'll blind 'em. I'll show the strip girls what Harlem like. When I'm at Harlem Nights bag the wildest Divas. Make 'em take me shopping in the Galleria. From H-town to H-town we ride out. Burn money, shine and pull 'em rides out. Hit the block post up and grind out.

Put the pedal to the medal I'm wreckless with this. On the I-95, hand full of piff. Got the wild eye's why. I'm takin the risk. You sideline guys beggin' to snitch. Hope the K-9 can't find the bread or the bricks. None of ya'll rappers ain't F'in with this. Ya'll movin' backwards like 7 to 6(uh). Rims goin' and goin'. I stay smokin' the corner. I'm steady blowin' and blowin' that straight Buddha. Sip Crys like Chris brown,Christopher Wallace,. Chris Reeve Christon and Luda. Keep the gat cocked stashed in the stash box. Locked up with padlocks I'm a straight shoota. A future billionaire runnin' with Chamillionaire. I'm outta here homie here come the state troopers. . Chorus2x. . But tell um to try again"

rocky road,"[Chorus]. The Rain Is Fallin' And The Weather Is Cold. Don't Know Which Way To Go, But I Continue To Roll. The Rainfall Is Really Taking A Toll. On My Mind And My Body And On My Spirit And Soul. The Rain's Fallin' But I'm Keeping A Hold. On The Light Cuz I Know That I Could Spin Outta Control. I Know Know, I Know Know, I Know This Is Gonna Be One Rocky Road. [Verse 1]. What part of the voyage is this?. Friendship and business don't mix. Wit anyone else its just business. Wit friends I'm personally pissed. Is this a curse or a gift?. Guess i was blessed wit my wish. Don't tell me that u feel my pain. That I sayin' its best if we switch. You take the fortune and fame. And see if its what u expected. Take the money and change. And be careful where u invest it. Just take the test and don't stress it. You get stopped by a detective. Tryna get in ya personal life. The gotta do yo best to protect it. The answer rests in a message. When I go I'll go in a blaze. But it wont be no captain savin'. Cuz where I'm goin ya saved. Tryna rain down on my parade. Till that umbrella get raised. They thinkin' that they can read me. Then they ain't knowin' my page. Tryin' to keep a smile on my face. Even at times when I engage. In business conversations. Wit people I know are snakes. If life is a piece of cake. Part of the icing is venom. Spent a lifetime tryin to bring me down. But I jus ain't gonna let em. Ya betta tell em. [Chorus].

I'm back and forth and I'm pacing. Bein more patient than patience. Tryin to wait for the good news to show up. But im unfortunately waitin'. Gotta be group participation. If its intercourse that we making. I was unfortunately done. And she was unfortunately fakin'. Cuz the only sexual spark. Is the spark he got for the dough. They say till death do us part. But that part is where she says no. There are too many emotions. Emotions like pins and needles. Actin' like emotions are evil. Like showin love is illegal. I thought that it was a eagle. But I've seen this vulture before. He thinks this is where i stop. 'Cause he sees that im walkin slow. But no I think you should know. That soon as I get where I go. You'll remember the fact that. I had a purpose fa'sho. [Hook]. I Hope You Know Where Your Going. I hope You Know That Today. On The Side Of The Road. You Gon See A Whole Lotta Snakes. When The Bad Weather Comes.

I Know Know, I Know Know, I Know This Is Gonna Be One Rocky Road. [Verse 3 - Devin Da Dude]. This road has many curves. Many bumps and potholes. It can even take you thru a loop if u aint got yo. Shit togetha unpredictable weather could leave ya. Dehydrated frostbitten washed away or eitha. Ran ova by heavy traffic watch where you roam. Cuz its a challenge jus tryna make it home. But still I walk I keep my pace I keep my stride. Would hitchhike, but there's too much pride. I must find a narrow path. So I can walk and laugh out loud. Cry and sing without bein judged by the crowd. Maybe someday I could just fly away but for now. I'll jus beat my feet and get there someway somehow. And mile after mile after mile I'll smile. Keepin my head up even though rain's pourin down. And the road gets rough and the journey is long. I might get tired but I must move on. [Chorus]. The Rain Is Falling And The Weather Is Cold. Don't Know Which Way To Go, But I Continue To Roll. The Rainfall Is Really Taking A Toll. On My Mind And My Body And On My Spirit And Soul. The Rain's Fallin' But I'm Keeping A Hold.

He's inside of you camp as he hides from your eye lids. Than before you realize this. He surprises you by knowing the day that your demise is. I'm an insomniac. Trying to live happy days like that Fonzie cat. They try to put bullets in the army hat. And I'm feeling like you trying to be a copy cat. Wait a sec. let me paint the Picasso.

I'm finna rip the limps off the littlest dolphin. Head to you see quietly. I feel like a movie what you tryna see. I don't know if Scarface, what you trying to be. But I'm lol and that's comedy. Timeless on my grind is. You can search forever but you'll never ever find this. People tell me that I'm mindless. But if I lost my mind, I'm not really tryna find it. Not crazy, I'm more than crazy. But one thing I know is you ain't gonna play me. Take a shot, balling baby 'til the forbes tell you. I made more than Jay-Z. [Chorus:]. I told you a million times. I'll live mine you live your lives. They say it but it's a lie. 'Cause it's not hard to say good bye. Say goodbye. Say goodbye. Say goodbye. Say goodbye. [Verse 3:]. I'm not anyone of them dudes from boyz II men.

she gangsta rage,"(*humming*). [Chamillionaire]. Now she's mo-ving through the club, in her gangsta strut. Her weapon's loaded up, and now she's aiming to bust ow-ow. So gangsta, the way she shoots. You found a thug, I'm down with you. Instead of filling him up with lead, with gun shots to the head. She's at the bar she's getting him drunk, and he taking shots to the head. Now he's laying stiff off in the bed, but no he's not really dead. See that punk drunk and he passed out, while she dash out with his bread. You bum a clot see you done forgot, nigga you dumb you not. Suppose to go buy a mall for a hoe, cause she wanna shop. See ya not suppose to buy a car lot, cause she want a drop. Maybe not go buy a mountain, just cause that hoe wanted a rock. Niggaz better stick to the G-code, speaking to hoes with my teeth froze. I peep hoes like a peephole, cause I'm sneaky I sneak hoes. Like a thief out of the clothes, and they don't even expect it. One minute she's telling her friend I'm cute, until poof she's naked. Yes it's the thick hips and the big tits, and her lipstick and her cleavage. And her weave is weaponry, and security didn't see this. She is dressed to kill, you blind if you think she ain't a. Visual Soprano can't handle her, cause she's gangsta. (*humming*). [Chamillionaire]. She cocks it back and pull and shoot, cause she can see I'm pulling roofs. Off the top of the new drop, but she forgot I'm bulletproof. My chest is a permanent vest, I guess I'm not who you thought. No matter how fine or smart, a girl can not damage my heart. Think you've guessed it right, she's trying to get you for your cream. But it's alright tonight, I've also got a scheme. To hear nice things, like I wan' get between them jeans. And then I'ma send you home, ain't nothing but wedding dreams. See every cent is equivalent to a bullet, so it ain't no. Damn hoe, giving me the shooter run out of my ammo. I'm like Rambo in the cruiser, I maneuver with a Ruger. Cause I'm sitting propped up on the non-stoppers, any jacker with a prover. Excuse her who you talking to sir, nigga I'm talking to you. See that hoe came in the club with me, how could she walk in with you. Nigga I don't know I ain't certain, you ain't gotta be no brain surgeon. If you got game then it ain't working, nigga getting two to the brain curtains. You seen that show t.v. Bachelor, how them ladies react. Well everyday Chamillionaire's life is like, a episode of that. Ha-ha her car break down on a hill, I bet she make you get out and push. Taking that chick to Foot Locker, she never leave without a Swoosh and that's gangsta. (*talking*). [Chamillionaire]. Million tempted by female, them smelling so good. She get in bed he swelling, she tell him he sho' should. Sex and sweat and yelling, them can tell I'm so hood. So I think I'm bout to claim her, I'm bout to tame her. Danger, damage you better believe she ain't ya. Average type of gangsta, excuse me what is your name girl. Danger, she's dressed to kill she's gangsta. Looking like a model, while she's kissing trying to bang ya. Smoking holes in dead bodies, just pulling hoes with their bodies. Full of tattoos matter fact who, running with boo and nails prbably. A drug dealer or a thug nigga, with a couple rocks in his left shoe. Chopping up rocks till he get through, but he trying to get a knot to impress you. Tell me what the hell is his purpose, putting diamonds all on her fist. The reason you doing dirt kiss, money could buy that guy he's worthless. Game tighter than her skirt is, as she leaves him in pieces. Till she eases her cleavage out, and sees it's his weakness. Think, your body's tight the mood is right and if it seems. That you're not in love with my money, more than me. I'll be the king on the throne, you can be my queen. Baby let's get it on, come be on my dream team. (*humming*). [Chamillionaire]. See I'm telling you fellas, she more gangsta than you'll ever be. She get cheddar can get a G, without cocking the desert E'. Never shot been on lock a lot, but it wasn't for felonies. Man fussing and handcuffing, he doesn't wanna let her free. Hispanic, Asian, Caucasian, even my Black queens. Not all of them are after do', though. Eighty percent of them, are only after that green. She wanna slam candy do's, and ride 4's. But, no-no-no-no. Baby I don't think so, I don't think sooo. She wanna slam, candy do's. Tell her I don't think so, I don't think sooo"
she gonna already know,"Haha, hey. (Dada, dada, dada). Do the opposite of lift your top up. Turn your knock up. Let's wake the whole block up. (Dada, dada, dada). (cha, cha, cheah). Chamillitary mayne. [Chorus]. I'm comin down clean, in my slab lookin throwed. They already know it's me, they see them slabs in a row. I'ma paper chaser, so them grands gotta grow. Better recognize a player when I step through the door. I swang and I swing, it swang and it slow. I'ma hit that Harlem Nights and you already know.

silence (freemix) (feat. curren$y & wiz khalifa),"[Chorus: Chamillionaire]. Hmm. I chased that paper it was never fame. Now they done finally let a playa in the game. And when they ask you will you ever change. Noo, you say you know I can't. And then they see you pull up in the range. Now everybodies sayin they the reason mayne. But if you wasn't with me when I came. Noo, this is a private plane. Noo way, noo wayy. Ya can't goo this is a private plane. Noo way, noo wayy. Ya can't goo this is a private plane. [Chamillionaire:]. I've takin losses but it's not right now it's in the past. We watching tv watchin tony make that gangsta cash. Wouldn't let you roll even if you told me you would take my bags. I bein a boss I cut some off just know it ain't the last. They know I'm right they know I might say that I hate to brag. You facing forward while you fly I fly while facing back. Just think about it if you don't get it then I don't think you had. You probably new to this while my stewardess up here making crab. I got a number on the plane but I ain't gave it out. Cause I know you'd probably call wih nothin great to talk about. I pull my laptop out to log into my bank account. She was standing so close you would think that we were makin out. [Curren$y:]. Uh, Yea. As the joint burns, to the point that it's stinging my fingers. Tracks my talk show platform. Part Phil Donahue part Jerry Springer. Momma come when I bring her. She go where I send her. Kept it trill from the beginning. From square 1 maintain square business. Don't concern yourself with my minglin with other bitches. So crafty, mastered the flow Alaska cold. Silent foot assassin approach. High when I stroll. Not even leaving foot prints in the snow. You know. [Chorus]. [Chamillionaire:]. Uh. I'm sitting back above the clouds I'm in my boss chair. She tryin ta tell me that man done bought her 4 pairs. Of shoes for her she say jaceppis I say oh yea. I say that's great I'm straight like unbraided horse hair. You know the reason why they gettin a divorce, yea. You know the reason they ain't having intercourse, yea. I know I think she think I'll get her in the source, well. If money talks these losers must of lost there voice, wheere. Is it, is it cause most of these folks just after fame. Most of these brauds that's on my knob is only after change. I come around I swear I bet that she won't act the same. I disappear go poof I bet that she gon act the same. You probably think Chamillionaire my real name huh. I pull up, pull up then I open up the range door. I never ever come and get her in my main car. They handcuffin I just cut em like a chainsaw. Gangsta. [Chorus]. [Wiz Khalifa:]. And still them clowns imitate him. Ain't even out of town, we feel like we on vacation. Bottles of champagne a lot of sour inspiration. Cabin of my plane rolling j's waiting for takeoff. Put in nothing but hardwork because it pays off, fool. She in the mood for jet infused music. Nothing like the rest of these niggas. R. I. p. when I'm done lay the rest of these niggas. [Chorus]. [Chamillionaire:]. Noo wayy, noo. You can't roll this is a private plane. Noo wayy, noo. You can't roll this is a private plane"

slow loud & bangin,[Hook: Chamillionaire]. Slow loud and bangin'. I turn my speakers up. And then I just start swanging. Sometimes I get behind the wheel. Then I start to steer. Don't know where I'm going but just get me out of here. Slow loud and bangin'. I feel the breeze and it be feelin so amazing. See baby I'm just trying to live. And I got stress for real. So I drop the topper 'cause how will that make me feel. [Verse 1: Chamillionaire]. Drop the top and then you know the drill. Git the strips so I can show the wheels. People say that I'm over thrill. But when they talk about me they promote and steal. They told me real to recognize the real. But if you real then you should know Chamill. If you don't then you should get a coke. Because a coke show that it's the cola feel. Wooden rippen written on my plates. This type of weapon is in normal ways. But I can see you ain't got a clue. So be a good detective and get on the case. You can sit on that couch at home. And not reach success and then call it fate. ‘Cause y'all the type that applies the brakes. But know that I'm the type that ain't trying to wait. [Hook]. Slow loud and bangin'. I turn my speakers up. And then I just start swanging. Sometimes I get behind the wheel. Then I start to steer. Don't know where I'm going but just get me out of here. Slow loud and bangin'. I feel the breeze and it be feelin so amazing. See baby I'm just trying to live. And I got stress for real. So I drop the topper 'cause how will that make me feel. [Verse 2: Chamillionaire]. Money don't make you bullet proof from stress. You can get sued mess around and lose your vest. Get your heart broken and it bruise your chest. Peace won't guarantee the roogie's rest. Your good girl trying to find who to sex. While you try to figure what dude is next. Someday you gotta give bad news to press. But even winners gotta find new success. Meditate ain't a spare to wait. Next stop on the map is a better day. Pretend that the towers was never break. But the past's in the past so just let it chain. The passangers out with your head to lay. When I'm in the road till the getaway. The truth remain with you so be scared to say. When I turn the beat up and I let it play and say. [Hook]. Slow loud and bangin'. I turn my speakers up. And then I just start swanging. Sometimes I get behind the wheel. Then I start to steer. Don't know where I'm going but just get me out of here. Slow loud and bangin'. I feel the breeze and it be feelin so amazing. See baby I'm just trying to live. And I got stress for real. So I drop the topper 'cause how will that make me feel. [Verse 3: Chamillionaire]. Seem like this world so chopped and screw. Good parents don't give proper dues. What the hell happened to Dr. Seuss. And who taught these little kids how to cock and shoot. Turn 13 and get shot for shoes. Turn 15 and get shot in school. Get too upset when I watch the news. So I just hit the strip in the drop topper cruise. Please Lord don't fail me now. This partnership's a cooperation. I'm on the job and know who to bust. And make living longer my occupation. They always told me their money talks. I always loved a good conversation. But they ain't seein' who behind the wheel. So let's drop the top so they not mistaken. [Outro]. Slow loud and bangin'. Amazing. Down against the wheel 'cause it always makes me feel. Down against the wheel 'cause it always makes me feel alright. Slow loud and bangin'. Slow loud and bangin'. Slow loud and bangin'

Now they sayin' ""THAT'S RIGHT"" like Young Jeezy. Ha Ha you better get up in a nigga face. Get up in a nigga face. Rid him of his dinner plates. They aint eatin' like we eatin'. That's why niggaz gotta hate. Delegate a weapon that will leave him wit the Nelly face. Band-aid on it. First aid pass it. Tellin' you they sendin' you a medical that's it. Forget a throwback hardwood classic. Lay you on your back on the hardwood ass kick. Looking for Koopa don't look for me by your lonely. Cause homie. I keep it on me. That's only. To keep the fonies. Layin' off any place. Not my face. Cause niggaz don't want me to make the cake. Pee like the homie. Except for sony. It's the don. Wit the fond's. Nigga fits your grind. I show your green lights pimpin' outfits was mine. And Slim Thugga my boy so I can switch his line. Forget cars tell MTV to pimp your rhymes. SMACK DVD"

Cuz most of these boys just selling out. The rest of these boys just selling hype. Naw get it right they hype beastin' to get accepted.

Cant you see that I'm coming down can't you see me reclinin'. Independent still moving. more than these fraudulents that they signing.

Don't get too comfortable until I want you to. Don't think about dropping something new. Ill have you thought was hungrier. eating lunchables for a month or two. Just have plan b to comfort you You got it hey way to go. For those that talk that aint made the dough. it looks like you got a long way to go. Can't complain about radio and how radio is not playing your. Real music but you ask the real. if they playing y'all and they saying no. Them broke dreams Them hoop dreams was just hope dreams. That's the way that I look at y'all. when y'all talk to me like you know things. Weaklings like dope fiends. That will lie and tell ya they'll go clean. Don't really look like they eating great. but they tellin y'all that that's protein. And them smoke screens. Looking around like who's stopping us. They could never stop destiny. if I make a wish then its not for luck. The minute something get popular. you know hyper beast will start popping up.

somebody gonna get hurt,"[Chorus]. I get that paper, I do it major. I'm stayin sucker-free and, I'm shakin haters (OHH!). I ain't really tryin to hurt nobody (say what?). I ain't really tryin to hurt nobody (say what?). I ain't really tryin to hurt nobody. Is somebody gonna get hurt up in here? Probably. [Chamillionaire].

If I lose I roll another bet to even up. Keep lookin for the dough like I ain't seen enough. Fully equipped the whip, that would be a plus. Hop off the you-know-what and I'ma leave it up. (Tell us what you leavin up) The dough on the Lambo'. Don't try to be a Rambo or be an example. Passport paper, ain't a place that I can't go. Haters gettin sick 'bout to Earl, like Kimbo (ugh!). Go ahead man, smack yourself silly. Rubberbands never fit when I package my scrilly. Overseas but I'm still the man back in my city. Ugh, put the cream on the acne like Diddy (what'chu mean?). Show you how to make 'em put the paper in your face. Let the yellow bones know that it's time to skate. Pillsbury dough sho' make a lot of cake. Time to show all of these suckas how to paper chase. The blueprint for the paper, just rewind it back. Yeah our money cash cars, I be rhymin that. Stay ballin on the base like a Diamondback. While you in the crowd gettin mad because the concert packed. [Chorus]. [Chamillionaire]. Two chicks talkin to me on the 3-way. Breeze blowin in the hair of my breezy. Woodgrain I'ma grab when you see me. Oakland in my hand like it's eBay. Both chicks beggin me to come to see A. No time like I ran out of prepaid. If you don't go and give this hotness to the DJ. You'll need a Doctor and it ain't gonna be Dre. Fans tryin to figure out and try to find who. the last verse of the last hearse applied to. I could tell you a lie and tell you it's not you. But like B on the ScanTron - not true. Cause y'all boys is costumes. I brush 'em off like the canvas in an art room. Bring it on boy, my victory's your doom. Your plan was to 'Samity Sam me but it's gone BOOM!. [Chorus]. [Chamillionaire]. Some people hate to see you spendin the new bucks. You better not show your animosity to us. Hit gon' have the three K's like Klu Klux. So bring 'em to the barber that'll give 'em a crewcut. Yup! That mean minus a couple. Need to be findin your mind instead of findin some trouble. Cause it's obvious you lost when we up out of the huddle. Ready to blitz, yup - I seen you in outer space like a shuttle. Ha ha; one mil', two mil', three, fo' mil'. Stayin hungry like I missed the past fo' meals. Half a mil' still tell a man ""No deal"". Ridin with the type of bananas you don't peel. Yeah, the type of weapon that don't jam. Like most of these rappers in this game that don't man. Plus the homie ridin with me is no fan. Don't bring the drama wit'chu if you ain't bringin no plan. [Chorus]"

Tot'in me a blaster. Send em to the casket.. Send em to the morgue.. Slap me a nigga cause i'm motherf**kin bored.. Chamillionaire, I camoflouge in my surrounding..

Seems like everybody loves me. It feels great,. Seems like everybody loves me,. A round of applause for the cause,. Thank you, thank you,. Ch-chyea!. . [Verse 1:]. Used to treat me like the bad guy from Houston,. In the media, I was like Darth Vader,. People turnin' like turntables,. Stay crossin' over like crossfaders,.

But we makin' more than all of y'all wages,. Motivation, makes hustlas make ya,. So we successful because y'all made us,. Used to not, give a flyin' eff,. When they greated us with that one finga,. Whole world jumped on the tip,. And we hit the switch and sat on swangaz,. In the hood they say y'all famous,. Grindin' hard, so we can ball later,. They be like damn, that boy made it,. If they say I didn't, that's wrong data,. First the braud, would try to say I'm fraud,. See me pull that waud, and that braud changes,. Callin' me, she wanna be on the team,. And now she's mad because I'm ignorin' pagers,. Boys thinkin' that they can serve me,. Y'all actin' like y'all waiters,. Same ones who used to walk pass me,. We was underground, but now we on majors,. Keep speakin', beggin' for a beat,. And I'll tell the streets to give that boy a favor,. Turn 'em purple blue and red, all flavors. I got a message for all haters. . [Chorus:]. Headed to the top,. And there ain't no way to stop it,. And I sho ain't forgot,. When everybody used to judge me,. Now that I got dough in my pockets,.

When I broke the record for the ring tones,. You ever seen a platinum plaque,. That look like that,. Then you seen wrong,. Better sit back and relax,. Because my platinum reign is gonna sing long,. And I don't blame boys for hatin',. Because they wasn't patient,. And they didn't know the plan,. I knew that something had them shakin,. It was gonna bubble like a Coca Cola can,. And I shook it up like a soda can,. My wallet is over flowin' man,. Now my potential is unlimited,. Like the minutes on my Motorola plan,. Accountants and lawyers,. I got big business, managers,. Chamillitary is an interprise,. Is you ready to ride?. Is you a fan or what?. Sound scannin' in Africa,. Sound scannin' in Canada,. We don't play, yeah VMAs,. It can't get any better, can it huh? (can it huh?). And I know it's hard to stay humble,. They really thought I threw a fumble,. I could of caught that through the trees,. While runnin' right into the jungle,. Could of been little Mugsy Bee,. Turn her back into Mutumble,. Would of still been a victory for me,. You win, then they'll say they love you. . [Hook:]. I know you like my style,.

Let's give a cheers, (give 'em cheers!). To everyone who thought I'd disappear,. Thought that every word I said,. Was a subliminal shot to disappear,. Now I'm in a different gear,. No beef, no hate, no dissin' here,. You must of been drunk to doubt me,. You obviously didn't miss a beer,. I used to argue about everything,. With folks that just didn't hear,. Realized, I was wastin' words,. Like whisperin' in a missin' ear,. I say it good and real,. They tellin' me it isn't clear,. My two eyes just didn't tear,. 'Cause weakness is what I didn't feel, (yeah!). It's a better result than last time,. But this grind, it's a different year,. I really should be commended,. For what I've accomplished,. Give a cheer. . [Talking:]. Naw matter fact,. I take that back, (wonderful!). Hold your applause for the sequel,. We haven't gotten to the part where they try to cheat you, (wicked!). Aha. (woo!).

stay schemin (freestyle),"Halleluia to god back but don't twist it invitation. More than just ridin dirty. Is probably the reputation. Don't stress 'cause we gettin blessed. Ain't part of the kind. They could talk to the devil. The hell with the conversation. Most of them just be talking. Talking they hearin speeches. Your opinion if I don't ask to give you peaces. Scriptions is everywhere. That is made in the lightness. And jesus froze all the one. Flood in my jesus pieces. So I ain't dreamin. You ain't even play the game. That you're talking like ... Criticize he would made it. Calling the entertainment. Difference between you skip. 'cause you ain't one getting paid with. And by practice we're talking bout practice. The..touch my roof is what I can do back. The rocks that I've got pumpin. I'm longer than shacks deals with botch ..global. Walking the sex fifth. I keep my ..the testes I'm rapping. Say is loco. People that normally to the best. You got to issue. Normally is a person who came. And approach you. That they hide and I ..why are you vocals. Every that you work for. Every that you have. Every that you got disappear the flash to be honest. I'm..is back in the pass. No matter where I end up. I have more than a little cash. Uh you're self in the eye. Convince you we're realest the...

still countin' my cash,"[Repeat - x2]. Chamillitary Mane... Are you ready?. [Verse 1]. Yeah, yeah. A couple of clowns in the town, run around, they used to be down. But it's build, check what you speaking, watch how you're using your nouns. Can make a million from home, making moves from my lounge. Hard to play captain save her cause them dudes is usually drowned. If you gon' hate, you at least could wait til it get to the chorus. You my promotional team, them boys my biggest supporters. Reside in Houston but they pay me to make a switch like the oilers. Toured a crib like a tourist, my yard look like a forest. Time to get a Thesaurus, they at a loss for words. They can't pronounce what I'm in, they like ""All them cars is yers?"". I got cars with curves, treating all my cars like birds. The fleet is a flock and the engine starts like ""brrr"". Welcome to the place where the music is slowed and choppy. The writers that wrote about me. Said that I wouldn't sell and the major label was gonna drop me. I make money moves and the population is sure to copy. When I need a favour I'ma call Ben Franklin like I know you got me. [Hook]. Haters was hating, they thought that I wouldn't last. But I'm still on the grind, I can see why they mad. Cause I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash). I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash). I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash). I'm still countin' my cash so do the math. They knocking my hustle, they saw me coming up fast. But I'm still getting mine, can't do nothing but laugh. Cause I'm still countin' my cash (uh). I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash). I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash). I'm still countin' my cash so do the math. [Verse 2]. This is for everyone who be acting like a Grammy made me a winner. My hunger did it so do me a favour and make me a dinner. Eating cakes at the lima, they gon' hate when you enter. Pockets swollen, I'm holding up monkey jeans with suspenders. None of these rappers is real, cause if you real then you dodging me. Ain't bumped into one that's even halfway as real from what I can see. I extend middle finger and don't extend an apology. Shows getting me paper, sales getting me property. Guess I'm good at monopoly, taking over the game. Trynna hold so much paper that my arms and shoulders just stain. Ain't smoking or drinking but I'm thinking what being sober will bring. You got a hangover in the morning but I'm hanging over in Spain. Fifty thousand through customs, I know you isn't accustomed. Cause money talks and your pockets look like an end of discussion. So hitting my head on the ceiling from money getting is nothing. I stand on top of my paper and probably get a concussion. I know the.... [Hook]. [Verse 3]. Remember that little apartment, we was laughing at Martin. Now the Martin's the aft and the one we passing is ???. And proper tags with bargains, the card is black what I'm charging. Grind out of this world, I'm chasing ground like a Martian. A hustler that really ball, your purchase is pretty small. Your money is minimal, my crib is a mini mall. And if it ain't really large, my bidness gon' get resolved. I feel like they fake and the boys is fighting for pennies dog. Yeah, I'm a hustler. Yeah, I'm a hustler. Yeah, I'm a hustler. Gotta keep my hustle up. Yeah, I'm a hustler. Yeah, I'm a hustler. Yeah, I'm a hustler. You know that I hustle for the. M-O-N-ey. M-O-N-ey. M-O-N-ey. M-O-N-ey. I ain't even gotta say why (say why baby). She asked me why I'm missing and I (I'm out on the grind). Cause the reason is that I'm on my grind. [Hook]"
stuck in the ghetto,"I got a degree ( Yeah ). But my felony wont let me get a job. (That's what i'm talking). Life is so hard. (Real hard baby). And just today somebody stole my car and the bus don't run my way. (It's messed up man whatcha gonna do?). I think i'll walk the street today. It seems like i'm stuck in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto. (Feel that baby). Sometimes it seems like i'm stuck, i'm in the ghetto. But I've got love for the ghetto, ghetto. (That's real baby). When I go to my friends. Now they opened arms they greet me 'n' let me in. 'What's up Tony baby? Let's go do something, let's go drink something, huh?, its all good. And every day we just dream and sceem and drink out lots of way. (Try to get behind this walls baby). I think I'll fly the sky today. It seems like i'm stuck (stuck baby). in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto. Sometimes it seems (It's real Tony). like i'm stuck, i'm in the ghetto (It's all good mayne).

the morning news,"Chamillitary man. [News Reporter]. Fighting broke out over-night between rival factions along the Israeli - Syrian border. Initial reports claim Israeli jet fighters bombed a guerrilla base,. Killing at least 49 soldiers and 13 civilians, damage to the base is said to be heavy. And the Israeli jets are reported to have made it back to their headquarters safely. An 49 year old unidentified man went berserk last night, opening fire with a 12 gauge shotgun.... [Chamillionaire]. Ring the alarm!. Terror alert, victory!. I stay dropping that bombness, Rosie O'Donnel and Donald Trump stay arguing bout nonsense. Would they treat me as good as Hugh Heffner if I had a mansion full of blonde chicks?. If adultery was a felony, then Clinton would be a convict. Put you in the same position and lets see what you'd really do. They tell me that I sold out if I execute the no snitching rule. Sound like it was a good idea, till a murder happen to you. Dumb-stupid, or stupid-dumb, either one you don't have a clue. Voice perfect for CNN but knew Larry King wouldn't hear it through. Bill O'Reily's an idiot, he ain't the only one with an opinion fool. E-mail this to my publicist so the media is gonna hear it too. You get on TV and get at me, then I'm gonna get on the CD and get at you. Uncle Sam says to pay your taxes, just to learn that I pay for classes. Part time hustle really ain't gonna last, so todays forecast is to make more cash. Its the morning news, news news, let em know the truth, truth, truth. Its the morning news, news news, let em know the truth, truth, truth. Its the morning news. In the strip club ballin', Bill Collecta keep calling. You ain't even tryna pay your bills, he show up and you dogging. White man balling, black man starving, looks like Al Sharpton found another cause to get. involved in. I cant hate to see a black man, and I don't hate to see a black hand. Crawling into that cookie jar cause theres plenty of dough up in that man. When your black and you educated people say ""You ain't black man!"". May be black in your appearance but really whiter than Batman. CEO's are like slave masters and most of them don't even know it. Their employees are like slaves, work the bill but don't even own it. Your money right but your credit ain't, then the bank still wont loan it. If you're on top and ain't paying taxes then I hope you're enjoying your moment. Uncle Sam says to pay your taxes, just to learn that I pay for classes. Part time hustle really ain't gonna last, so todays forecast is to make more cash. Its the morning news, news news, let em know the truth, truth, truth. Its the morning news, news news, let em know the truth, truth, truth. Its the morning news. Hip-hop crunk music, hyphy music, slab music, sound like a nursing rhyme. Get a beat and rap to it, ain't speaking with a purpose, I'm gonna call it crap music. Y'all got your boys getting mad, my bad lets get back to it. Cigarettes are still causing cancer, and chronic smoke'll still get you high. In the streets or in the store, know a couple dollars wont get you by. Truth is a Paris Hilton jail cover story could never flop. For that sexy mug-shot I could get a million dollars a pop. Even Michaels in the media, they like to make examples of people just like you. Get involved and I bet the indite you, goto jail and I bet they don't write you. Yea, you ain't got a college degree then they'll say you're not intelligent. And if your class ain't Upper Class, then your opinion is irrelevant. Uncle Sam says to pay your taxes, just to learn that I pay for classes. Part time hustle really ain't gonna last, so todays forecast is to make more cash. Its the morning news, news news, let em know the truth, truth, truth. Its the morning news, news news, let em know the truth, truth, truth. Its the morning news. The world is crazy, every day I gotta wake up to this nonsense. Silly rappers think I'm worried about a punch-line. I show more purpose than your whole career in one line. Victory"
the real thang,[Verse 1]. I gotta be honest. Bragging was really not the mission. Only way that they'll listen excuse me if you hear a contradiction. Yea I had a chicken. She had gave me a proposition. She was in love till I told her French ain't my type of kissin'. Them execs was dissin when I walked into that Def Jam audition. Should've threw my watch in they face and then said its time to listen. Record label switchin. Grindin cause I didn't have a pot to piss in. Feelin like I was fishin'. It was eatin my food inside the kitchen. Before the second album. Sophomore jinx was just superstition. Who would've known that they would've been right. But I ain't trippin. Tryin to be an artist. While they repaint the composition. I need recognition. Recognize ain't no competition. [Chorus]. They said we wouldn't make it. But now they copying the style that they said would never blow. Lord wasn't no complainin. And now it seems like everywhere I go. Steady crawlin. On them 4s. (still crawlin). On them 4s. (still ballin). On them 4s. Still crawlin on 4s mayne. On them 4s. (still crawlin). On them 4s. (still ballin). On them 4s. You can copy but you'll never ever be the real thing. [Verse 2]. Trying to hit em wit some knowledge. They gon' respond and say its garbage. If I say my cars is. Candy they tell ya he the hardest. Look at how you boys is. Talking bout cars in they garages. They just mirages if you believe em. You retarded. Ima grind regardless. Step in ya castle steal ya crown. Gotta give a pound. KJ and Nancy they still around. And I'm still the deepest. Spend my thesis you still will drown. And that XXL dude that said I would fail. YOU STILL A CLOWN. Cant get a digit or live it how could you even grade me. I'm the one who pay me. Personally give me money daily. Completely crazy. Talk to the streets the streets obey me. Go ahead and hate me. I don't give a 'F' like Weezy baby. The caddillac looking cocky they set a standard to stop me. Swagga jackers that copy I think ya swagger is sloppy. I was just a child in the streets till I let Universal adopt me. But now I feel like I'm the man. If they ever plannin' to drop me. A kitchen drawer wit the flow. Cause I'm sharp as a utensil. Bring any writer I promise I'll break him like a pencil. Any instrumental. Rappers cant keep up wit my mental. Cause they mental's simple. While my mental is monumental. Been had potential. Follow me cause of what I went through. While haters jock me. Copy my image like a stencil. Don't try to jack me. Give a message to those that sent you. I bet the pistol show up in ya face like it's a pimple. [Chorus]. They said we wouldn't make it. But now they copying the style that they said would never blow. Lord wasn't no complainin. And now it seems like everywhere I go. Steady crawlin. On them 4s. (still crawlin). On them 4s. (still ballin). On them 4s. Still crawlin on 4s mayne. On them 4s. (still crawlin). On them 4s. (still ballin). On them 4s. You can copy but you'll never ever be the real thing. [Verse 3]. Should've betted in my chain. That I'm better than the game. I don't mean the rapper I mean every rapper that's in the game. This the little internet nerd that you say that I gotta prove it to. Alicia keys. Keyshia cole. Oh! My dough is beautiful. I throw three thousand in the air just to snap a Polaroid. Chamillinate anybody movin ya so destroyed. Ka-boom!. Say I'm dissin if you don't know the half. I'm digital download with the dough. You do the math. My money move I get statements so I can view my dollars. A one then a zero. Zero be leapin' all the commas. I can poke I promise. Baby look dope as Pocahontas. In the Bahamas. Countin money in my pajamas
the sound of revenge,"[Verse 1]. Yeah, a lightning bolt strikes in the air, yeah, finally it's here. Cause y'all are the judge, the day of judgement finally is near. In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin me of fear. Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin what you feel. Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin to keep it real. Grim reaper that we call Revenge right beside ya in your ear. He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear. Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin you a beer - ha ha ha. Cheers... time for a toast (your heart's beatin, your heart's beatin). To the haters that hate you the most (your heart's beatin). And the friends that pretend to be your folks (your heart's beatin). This is what revenge sounds like (your heart's beatin, your heart's beatin). I hear your heart beatin, keep runnin your mouth, yeah. [Verse 2]. Your mouth runnin ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do. Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it. It sounds like your ready to, cause these rappers are terrible. And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix. This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable. Use the Pro Tools and tell em to edit it, it. Switch to somethin that's better fool, turn it up what you better do. When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this. Somebody call the doctor (you're not breathin, you're not breathin). They ain't gonna be well after this one right here. You're not breathin (you're not breathin, you're not breathin). Just make sure they learn the name (you're not breathin). that's about to be runnin the game (you're not breathin). Tell 'em the name ... Chamillitary mayne. [Verse 3]. Shoulda heard what I was tellin you, I don't do what the jealous do. I don't hate when a nigga make it, cause I'm smarter and better too. You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to. If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you. Y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin. (you're not leavin, you're not leavin). Houston, Texas, I'm here now (you're not leavin, you're not leavin). Anybody gotta problem? (you're not leavin). Speak now or forever hold your peace (you're not leavin). I ain't think so - yeah!. [Verse 4]. The feeling's great cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily. I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby. The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me. In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady. But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived. If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie. They assk me about me and hear a truthful reply. They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes. [Chorus]. Better go take over befo' it rains. Cause I'd hate to say that I told you mayne. I know, I know what you're gonna say... but have it your way. I know these haters is gonna hate. And I see that angry look on your face. Tell 'em _Sound of Revenge_ is on the way... this isn't your day. Lookin for the truth, they ask me where have you been?. (Where have you been? Where have you been?). Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin for them. (Somethin for them, somethin for them). You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind. (Sound in the wind, sound in the wind). You turn around cause you think you hear that sound once again. You hear that? (Yeah what's that?). That's _The Sound of Revenge_ [gunshots]. [Female]. See, I told you. That's what happens when you get on his bad side. Ha ha ha. Chamillitary mayne! ..."
the ultimate vacation,"Get away, Get away (hey). You got to have a passport if you're rollin' with me. We can hit Jamaica or we can chill in France. Roll with a playa, you can bring a friend (ya). You in the presence of some playas, Chamillitary do it big. We could hit hawaii or the caribbean,. We could do it major, chillin on the sand. [Chorus]. You stressin' everyday, 'cause the way you're livin'. See it in your face, ain't no fakin' the feelin'. We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin'. We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin'.

To bring the straw with the umbrella (please bring the umbrella). Hey, we just drinkin', and thinkin',. Of a way that we can make life better. [Verse 1]. Ya! Coconut with the umbrella baby. And the Rhianna Soundin chick is the umbrella lady. It ain't no carpet on the floor like they renovating. Palm trees like my old homeboys, hella shady. Time flies so you know the clock is passin' through. Hit the sand is the only other task to do. You know my fanbase is international. Their fanbase is only within an avenue (Ugh!). Go wherever that you plan. G5 I'll show 'em how to fly like Peter Pan. Get a lobster or anything that she demand. If it isn't then it's somethin' you will never eat again. Step off the yacht if you wanna see the land. I'll take you to the sun if you really need a tan. Water look like oxygen anywhere you stand. 'Cause the ocean so clear you look down and see the sand. [Chorus]. You stressin' everyday, 'cause the way you're livin'. See it in your face, ain't no fakin' the feelin'. We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin'. We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin'.

Listen, if money talks, my paper probly speak Greek. I'm in a different continent like each week. Seein' daylight and they gon probly be sleep. No cell phones, send a telegram to East Beach. Females, it's like ya chick is so hot to me. Can we all chill, i turn maybe into possibly. You know my beach house is what you got to see. Paper and property, walkin' game of Monopoly. My helicopter lands on the boardwalk. Where the residents ain't understandin' your talk. The cliff ends and the salt water pours off. Think what you think, but you'll never have a bored thought. Water so warm that the fishes isn't cold. And the air is so open that the pigeons get exposed. Didn't i remind you to bring your swimmin' clothes. No, i didn't on purpose, now you're swimmin' in your Whoa!. [Hook]. Ay, I got money, got paper,. Ay, I got plenty of cheddar (plenty of cheddar). So we treatin', today like we know it ain't lastin' forever. Hey, now bartender, remember. To bring the straw with the umbrella (please bring the umbrella). Hey, we just drinkin', and thinkin',. Of a way that we can make life better. [Verse 3]. It's all good, long as you don't turn on me like a doorknob. And try to make my flow stop like a cork does. Now we'll be in Hawaii eatin' corn cob. Pinnin' a flower in your hair like a corsage. Said i shouldn't leave, but you know i ain't hear a thing. 10 karat earring blockin' all my hearing. Never go back is exactly what they're fearing. Know plenty Jamaicans so i brought you to the real ting. Rude Boy! Sick wit it and givin' flu. It's like i just appeared here, but i really flew. They say it just to rhyme, this what i really do. Deja-Vu, we'll repeat it when the year is through. [Chorus]. You stressin' everyday, 'cause the way you're livin'. See it in your face, ain't no fakin' the feelin'. We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin'. We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin'. We can go today, and get away for a minute. Party everyday, do your thing to the rhythm. We can get away -ay -ay, get away. We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin'"

I swear to y'all the rap game, really makin' me sick,. The record industry's your home, then I came to evict,. Put some nonsense out and I bet you this one'll stick,. I put real music out and I'm probably gon' catch a brick,. Brick, on top of brick, will build a house,. Tell whoever said that, I'm still filled with doubt,.

think i'm crazy,"Chours. i dont know who you are. but you seem very nice. so will you talk to me. shall i tell u a story. shall i tell you a truth. they think i'm crazy. they don't know our life is near. Verse 1. See, it started off as just a simple conversation I gave her. The name of my record company, she said ""You a sanga"". My name's Chamillionaire and I'm a rap entertainer. Oh, you that guy they talkin about when they be whisperin aint ya. Bring ya name up when they talkin and say money will change ya. I heard a lot about how you can't deal witchya anger. Heard the rumors bout how you always in trouble or danger. Not gonna judge you if it's true so there's no need to explain. Cause ya do have a right to be, ya seem like ya nice ta me. I'm bout to order me another drink, here, would you like a seat?(Yea). I tell the bartender send Hennesey on ice for me. Her drink starts emptyin while she spillin out her life to me. Tellin me about her goasl and how successful she would like to be. Invitin me, into a session of her life and she. Seems so damn innocent, but something isn't right to me. She pulls out a picture phone ""I got pics, would you like to see?"". I'm thinkin she gotta be friendly as hell. Givin her soul to me, it's like an identity sale. We never met is the story that my memory tells. Tellin me tales like she doesn't handle Hennesey well. Gettin into it, gettin intimate, and into detail. See I just met ya and ya showin me ya kids. Who said I had any kids? I didn't bring up no kids. Then who is in this picture?. Man, lemme show you just who it is. Chours. i dont know who you are. but you seem very nice. so will you talk to me. shall i tell u a story. shall i tell you a truth. they think i'm crazy. they don't know our life is near. Verse 2. Um, I don't remember her name, but she looked like a angel. Knew she wasn't from here, I knew that she didn't hanga. Round the same part of the hood, but hey the story gets stranga. Cause this stranger was stranger than I could explain ya. See, said she wasn't married, but the ring on her finger. Told me that she was lyin and just usin the same ah. Game I use on women so I couldn't even blame her. Spittin the game I spit to em when I'm tryin to bang a. I walked into this guy and he told me he used to know you. He told me about the loyalty and the love he used to show you. He said what he said with a passion like it was so true. And took advantage of the fact that the listeners really didn't know you. His picture's in my pocket book, almost got it, I'll show you. Sheee digs in her purse and while she fumbles around. To find that photo I'm like oh no, there's some trouble in town. We turn around and see two officers comin in now. They walk in real suspicious and come and sit down. So close I could see they barrels of they guns to the ground. So close that they could listen to either one of us now (shhhh). We turn back around and then she says ""No need for whisperin"". Then she tells me ""I don't really give a damn who's listenin"". Tried to make it last a long time was my mission. And he kept on trippin and then I got pissed at him. Hit him with my fist and them punches were never missin him. Chours. i dont know who you are. but you seem very nice. so will you talk to me. shall i tell u a story. shall i tell you a truth. they think i'm crazy. they don't know our life is near. Verse 3. Okay, let's get this straight. Your man cheated on you and now. You're talkin to a perfect stranger like it's makin ya proud. And the rest of this conversation she's just tellin me how. Wasn't her boyfriend in the pic, but a familiar smile. She said pictures can be decieving like she knew he was foul. Look closely and you'll see a coward who uses his smile as power. Gleamin smoke screen, couldn't stand it another hour. So she did what she did then she went to go take a shower. What're you sayin? What do you mean?. I couldn't tell you that I'm missin him. I don't understand what you're sayin. How'd you get rid of him?. She dissin him as I ask her what it is she did to him. She stops and I say ""Eh, keep talkin I'm listenin"". I don't wanna tell about the images I'm picturin. Henny spillin and she tell me for real. That the feelin that I was feelin. Was that I wanted to kill him. Somethin is wrong here. And I know just who's the villian. Her voice was gettin louder, the moral is gettin clearer. The officers lookin at us, and I can tell they can hear her. Told me it was protection, reached for it in the stash. The plastic is what she grabbed and she put right on his ass. Busted before the blast, she thought she was free at last. ""Baby I think you crazy. I'm sorry, I'm pressin. for time. I gotta go grind,. times been interestin"". Now I sweatin, I'm stressin, this girl got me guessin. That this conversation is some type of evil confession. She pulls a clearer picture it's my damn best ex-friend. ""How you know him?"". She told me that she was wit em at his house watchin movies. Sundays is when they be chillin. And that's exactly the day that the hospital came to get him. The feelin was the worse feelin she possibly could be feelin. Stood up, and then I yelled out ""Why the hell did you kill him?"". I didn't kill him I have AIDS. She had sex with em. And that's crazy"
this my world,"A different city every night right. And they be going so insane. I repping for my city right, right. So you should be happy that I came. [refrão:]. We believe in, if you see me. I watch the skyline light up every evening. It's like I'm dreaming baby, what I mean is. Most of y'all don't know that. This my World, whoooa. This my World, whoooa. This my World, whoooa. [Chamillionaire:]. I don't worry 'bout paper I past up. I focus on money my hands touch. If that right there don't add up. I gotta let you know your math sucks. You don't ever talk to a calculator. You don't get caught with an ounce of paper. Every convo is about a favour. Had to get a mansion without the neighbours. I ain't meaning no bad shit. When I say they don't have a dime. And I ain't meaning no. Gold watch when I say ""I don't have the time"". My hustle is the reason I'm known to shine. It's like I'm in my own World. Cause these boys out here full of talking. And texting all my old girls. You call that your homegirl. I call that my dome girl. I call that my errr,. I'm not home leave a message after the tone girl. I go to places they rap about. But girls only love you cause the cash you got. See all these hoes is chasing stars. Growing up to be cashtronauts. Can't be mad, I asked for it. Living life in that airport. Y'all ain't even get off the ground. Y'all stuck in that chair-port. I know they wanna see my cash short. But only thing I ask Lord. Is please don't let me run out of nothing. But pages in my passport. [Chorus:]. We believe in, if you see me. I watch the skyline light up every evening. It's like I'm dreaming baby, what I mean is. Most of y'all don't know. This my World, whoooa. This my World, whoooa. This my World, whoooa. [Big K.R.I.T.:]. Been through a lot just to get this far. Whip that car, grip that grain. Ready pipes on the lights. Went from broke to having things. Catching planes out of state. I got dudes to pay, I got move to make. Fuck the fee that they put on me. To keep the lights on and food on their plate. Hit the slab, push it to the max. Expensive taste, I love poppin' tags. Fucking hoes, I live in the lab. Spittin' bars that reflect my past. What you know 'bout sold out shows. The more gun shit everywhere I go. Putting on for the third [?]. Sippin' [?], give a damn, what you think dat my folk. And nothin' else I gave them but hope. I think they could follow dreams of their own. Be successful and ride clean with the chrome. If it ain't pass I'll leave it alone. And who they hate and preach their Lord. Most niggas talk now just because. I'm putting my faith in the man above. About my bread, playa be about your's. Be 'bout our's, stay on course. I make my mark everywhere I go. I speak that trill everytime I flow. I get my own, cause it's all I know. Thats all I show so when I toast to the life I live. I'm taking off like a laser beam. Rather not wake, rather get my cake up. While I'm out here living the dream. This is my world!. [Chorus:]. We believe in, if you see me. I watch the skyline light up every evening. It's like I'm dreaming baby, what I mean is. Most of y'all don't know. This my World, whoooa. This my World, whoooa. This my World, whoooa. [Bridge:]. A different city every night right. And they be going so insane. I repping for my city right, right. So you should be happy that I came. She say she want to spend the night right. And I don't even know her name. (don't even know your name). Just sit and watch me as I fly high. And she wanna be my Lois Lane. [Chamillionaire:]. Fresh off the plane, straight to the Rover. I can't complain, tip for the chauffer. When I hit my room, its over. Floor that I'm on, high as a toca. Funny thing is this girl is sober. But she gon be drunk when she hit the sofa. You stay the night if you acting right. The views that we looking at thats a sight. You really be living that rapper life. It they ain't made it where I'm at than they ain't rapping right. She me and KRIT got dough appetites. You couldn't see us if with a flashing light. You could die, than come back to life. You still couldn't see us in the after life. And you know.... [Chorus]. We believe in, if you see me. I watch the skyline light up every evening. It's like I'm dreaming baby, what I mean is. Most of y'all don't know. This my World, whoooa. This my World, whoooa. This my World, whoooa. (It's like I'm dreaming, It's like I'm dreaming). This my World, whoooa. Dollar to my name, quarter in my jeans. Million dollar vision now I'm living out my dreams. This my World, this my world. I had a dollar to my name, quarter in my jeans. Million dollar vision now I'm living out my dreams. This my World, this my world. This my World, yeah"

Take me forward far, this ain't just my car. This my time machine (take me way back). This my time machine (take me way back). This my time machine (take me way back). Take me far and far, this ain't just my car. This my time machine. [Verse 1 - Big K. R. I. T]. Take me way back Scarface in our tapedeck. Ridin' with my poppa, rockin' a starter and some gray sweats. Gave me game as we roll down the 8th street. Niggas out here flexin', don't be stressing what you can't be. And don't be vouchin', don't believe in what you can't see. Unless it's God, dont be borrowin' cause ain't shit free. You got your family and your friends when you need relief. There'll come a time when I can't be there when you need me. He lean't my seat back (way, way, back). When it come to music yea you need that. Forever in the cut where you be at. Forgive and forget, your anger leave that. Don't be wasting time, Cause time is all you have. Don't be chasing hoes, Boy go chase this cash. I can't say no mo', you'll learn it on your own. I couldn't understand it then. But you know that I'm grown. [Hook]. [Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]. Uh, Uh. Hold up. I just wanna say what's up to the women they discuss. Ain't no rust, you can never say it's lust. This the only dame I trust, Ain't it plush. You can see the painted struts. Got the naked lady just painted up. This ain't no Mercedes cause, bet it make your baby blush. Coats of candy got 'em saying I'm, delicious. Every woman on her knees that's looking up, is not religious. And I feel like Master P had me not taking minor digits. If you ain't about this life then close your pipe and mind your, business. Screw taught us stay authentic and they gon' love your jams. Watts taught us gotta keep on mashin' and we gon' run the land. J prince and Drake are the reasons you had to become a fan. And the only way we ain't gon' win is when we under planned. Throw a prayer up for Japan, I swear the daily news be having me trippin'. Everybody that got a cross hanging off they neck is not a Christian. When the police pull you over they'll say you fit the, description. Bun B that's our O. G. , R. I. P Pimp C feel like I'm with him. When I'm in my time machine. [Hook - Big K. R. I. T]. [Verse 3 - Big K. R. I. T]. Take me way back, fitted with a wave cap. Brushing in the hallway trying to keep these waves flat. Broads come and go rarely would they fuck with me. My brother was a player I was favorite off many streets. Learning who's paying dudes made myself a name. Laughing at these cape crusader's savors 'cause these niggas lame. Hand cuffin', claim they lovin' on a freaky thang. She a bopper I got partnas that done ran a train. We play the game. Even as a youngster knew I'd be a king. Told them non-believers I would never changed. Mississippi is where I'm from and that the shit I claim. It's funny how they flock when they heard you got that knot. Wouldn't bust it open now they dying to set it, out. Down to hit my couch, get off in their mind. Like Im a fall in love, Take ‘em back in time. [Hook - Big K. R. I. T]. [Verse 4 - Chamillionaire]. Hold up mayne. I just had to bring it back. For the day I seen this lac. Cleanish lac, had to spend some g's and stacks. Told me I could keep the tax. C was back, told me that he needed that. Knew that it would be respect. I don't need the check. You can have the keys with that. Ready then I beat it chad. Ghetto yea I guess that I forgot to mention. I'm a legend when ya see me you salute stand at attention. You could hope that I go broke till 40 caddy got me rentin'. But ya prolly never see it like amber rose extensions. I started makin dollars speakin outta pen. That was ninety eight and I still got partners that's still ain't out the pen. Now they sayin obama got osama if they got em damn. I know it's some soldiers in the sky that'll live to see us win. Send a voice sent up to them and bust a shot in the sky if you got your clip in. And chunk the deuce to tila, taquila had them ladies strippin. Can't forget about ballin g why ya'll an me was space age pimpin'. And it's nothin but country tunes that pop music is always missin'. When your in my time machine. [Hook - Big K. R. I. T]"
true,"feat. Lil' Flip. (*talking*). Here lizard-lizard-liazrd, uh. It's the almighty King Koopa, Chamillionaire. The color changing lizard, the Mixtape Messiah. Please stand for the ghetto national anthem, let's go. [Hook - 2x]. Forget what them boys is talking bout, I'm true-I'm true. You riding swangs you gripping grain, I do-I do. You candy red you candy blue, you popping trunk you jamming Screw. Don't know about you, but I'm true-I'm true. [Paul Wall]. Forget what these boys is talking bout, we wipe boys down. In South Park on MLK, on Sunday we clown. From the streets of Antoine, to the Homestead hoods. From Mo City to Studewood, it's all good. I'm riding on platinum grey, with Z-Ro and Trae. Gon let the top down, it's a beautiful day. Haters jealous on the sidelines, running they mouth. Cause I roll with T.I.P., the king of the South. Boys know I'm Paid In Full, so they clocking my dollas. Me, Poppy, Joe and Fox all riding Impalas. I'm breaking bread with Mike Jones, and Slim Thug the Boss. It's Paul Wall, still representing Swishahouse. I'm with my boy Big Kaila, I don't bar no hater. I'm on the grind for paper, I'll holla at ya later. Forget what they talking bout, I'm in love with my wealth. I ain't gotta say I'm true, cause true speak for itself baby. [Hook - 2x]. [Chamillionaire]. They say I'm the greatest of all time, and I say who and they say you. If she's a dime tell her I'm fine, and she'll say true-true. Turn up the bang if you into, something color changing the rims do. Sound like a train cause when I stop, they be like choo-choo-choo. And I'm thugging too homie, the heater kinda like Al Bundy's hand. Believe me everytime you see me, it's gon be in her pants. If I do a crime and you snitch, homie the heater will snitch too. Cause if the police come around, it'll be pointing at you. Somebody give mouth to mouth to this mic, after it melt. Cause the only rapper out rapping me is me, after myself. I hope you internet thugs, that will swear that I ain't the tightest. Have cyber sex with Cita, until you catch a virus. Why is he saying this, to piss boys off. I officially claim myself, the rap King of the South. The say I'm the greatest of all time, and I say who and they say you. And I say naw, give that title to the late great DJ Screw, rest in peace. [Hook - 2x]. [Lil' Flip]. The definition of a pimp is (me), cause I ain't doing shit for (free). I got my own label now, if you ain't heard it's (Clover G's). Now me and Will chasing the scrill, we pulling up on chrome wheels. Nigga, your royalty check looking like my phone bill. Quick to capping picture snapping, paparazzi follow me. Yeah I'm platinum I'll slap him, if he smoke up all my weed. I love to speed on dubs and Spre's, bitches leave the club with me. Snitches mean mugging me, don't make me bust my fucking heat. We popping trunks and smoking blunts, that sticky-ickie (ooh-wee). Last year I did a mill, now I'm bout to do (three). I bring the heat on every track, it's five G's for every bar. Just because I'm in a Porsche box, don't mean I like the spa. That don't mean I like the car, you know I'm down to break your jaw. Just because I burn rubber, that don't mean I like the tar. We ghetto stars in every state, like Pimp and Bun we keep it trill. And if you ain't heard, it's Lil' Flipper and Chamill'. [Hook]"
true religion,"[Intro:]. They say I know you don't do the freestyle thing no more. But since you do it better than somebody else. Well, you know! For show!. You know I gotta keep it' though!. Oh, mix-tape God, go!. I know I'm not God, that's blasphemy. The good is I don't have to be. While I would turn to a beach resort. And kick you all out and live happily. You'll see how rhetoric these rappers be. Like I get out of shore, bus after three. Get Instagram, take pics with guns. Snitch on your cell, you're reach at the'. No stitching ' cause I'm different fan. No Twitter cam, I don't need to mention. They always told me that money talks. That's who I wanted to pay me attention!. I'm young done, never went to prom. Genius kid that wouldn't leave detention. When the teacher said that I'd never blow. I said, 'don't count my pockets till you see my pension! '. I was plotting moves. I was carving scriptures into the desk. That was middle school. So track down the desk and figure out the rest, oh yes!. I must confess, I see you, but I am not impressed!. I see along the side talking cash. They done talking when they see me in flesh. Can't cut your tongue, and cough up the lung. Just' at your hands and then hold your breath. If I want opinions I ask for that. Just stay in your boundaries, don't overstep!. Back on the porch, we sat on the steps. While we all argued about who's the best. And now I sit behind suicides. With AC on I came fresh to death. They ain't stars, these rappers good for like 8 bars. Rappers looking for like 8 balls. Get in the pockets, then take all!. These activist ain't active to me. Ain't standing up for your fake cards. Most of y'all suspecting me. As a pastor that just bought 8 cars. To mix-tape God, you mix-tape frauds. Make sure you hearing this carefully. Even if you know that we was cool before. You ain't got to come and give death to me!. 'let them know you don't have to be. A clown next to clowns cause that's ratchet D. You could rap the motto and own the masons. Wouldn't give a damn about your fashion, G!. You own the brand, you just come to me. What you saw before, you '. You're a grown man, why grown man?. Staring at the logo and reading on some pains. You ain't made a man, you couldn't make the pen. I don't pay for likes, I don't pay for fans. I won't buy your music, cause you're popular. Cause you're acting like you'. I say you're not!. I don't believe you, that's superstition!. You say you're high, I know you're not. Go and prove it to me, go to this mission. Go dodge in hot gasoline. Go pump some gas without even flinching!. If you make it back, then I'll play your raps. I won't tell your family I thought you was missing. Gave you the game, I thought you would listen!. Y'all got t it twisted, like a Jewish Christian. I taught you how to dismay your labels. When they told you about it, they showed some kissing. When you tell the truth, you'll say you was distant. What's being dope got to do with stitching?. Stay true when they'll praise you. And that's what a hell I call true religion!"

victory,"(*talking*). That's what it is, ""The Sound of Revenge"". Summer 2005 nigga, whoooooo. [Chamillionaire]. Gimmick rappers, can't lie forever. But as long as I'm here, gimmick rappers gon die together. Told lil' mama I love drama, no one tried to tell her. She shoulda left the club, instead of trying to find a fella. The villain's born, dark storms that's my kind of weather. Sending gimmick niggaz to the mall, to go buy umbrellas. Like Eminem was telling them, that they should die it yella. Some of my fans they look like Cham, but say I am better. Picture the though of that, since no one spit a harder rap. I told 'em that I'm Jehova's lil' brother, the God of rap. Don't play me like you a atheist, face it it's more fact. Gimmick rappers have heart attacks, when you tell 'em that God is back. The problem is more than that, like Iraq when the gats in em. You diss me you gon be done, like a snack when the rats get em. After the baptism, the black in the black hit em. No need for that gat, cause fact is the raps kill em. Live your life like a mockery, niggaz will see the prophecy. Stare at a flight of stairs, 'fore you ever think you on top of me. Nigga how could you possibly, think that you could be stopping me. Destiny couldn't stop me, I move and that hoe be watching me. Fans are no longer crying to see, Jay-Z throw up the dynasty. Not big as that nigga Jigga, but nigga tell 'em it's time for me. Rap game is dying to me, I'm the rapper they trying to see. I could bring it back, not only force-ably but violently. Ladies and gentlemen, introducing from Houston. The truth and I'm in the booth, and your truth is a big illusion. What you choosing if you're choosing, to jump into the confusion. You losing and end up choosing, and cruise it into a bruising nigga. (*talking*). I'm peeping out here in these streets, and I see these old. Record labels trying to advance, trying to drop old material. On a nigga, so instead of Controversy Sells we gon switch it up. Summer 2005, ""The Sound of Revenge"". [Chamillionaire]. Then they said on the radio, I ain't beefing with rappers no mo'. But tell 'em to go correct it, cause rappers be acting homo. Came in and screaming duo, I'm leaving and screaming solo. Disrespecting the logo's a no-no, I'll leave you rojo. Hey that's red in Spanish, real niggaz'll never vanish. We rise up and then we ride up on haters, prepare to panic. Put ya teflon on, you better go get it plant it. Rip off your chest piece, to make niggaz remember Janet. Ay log on the net, type in ""the villain"" and search. And realize why gimmick rappers is hurt, cause the truth hurts. And you jerks (you jerks), is a package of skirts. Put your little advance, back in your purse ha-ha. That nigga say he don't like me, he acting like he a wifey. Ain't held a pistol, acting like he the type that'll snipe me. You don't like me invite me, you don't like me come fight me. And if you can't afford the flight, and you don't like me then write me. I ain't concerned, with any of your concerns. I'm trying to stack, plack on top of plack like gum germs. I got enough tongue twisters, to make the tongue turn. Make the sun burn, I'm so hot I could give it sun burn. So call up, Kay Slay and ask him who is. The trillest to spit it, then call up DJ Whoo-Kid. DJ Drama, Vlad Green, Lantern and Kool-Kid. Tell 'em it's time to switch they playlist up, with the new kid. What's his name, Chamillitary mayn. (*talking*). Yeah, the hardest rap nigga and if you beg to differ. Step to the mic, and spit some'ing sicker nigga. Ha-ha, Chamillitary mayn"
void in my life,"[Hook]. When I look back at my life, I realize-realize something ain't right. I'm missing you Lord, in my life make it right. I got something to decide, just wanna make-wanna make everything right. Cause there's a huge void, a huge void in my life make it right. [Chamillionaire]. I'm staring up at the Pope, it soak it up while he spoke it. Mesmerized and repeated, like he the author that wrote it. The broads are the ones I love, just don't wanna be the corporate. So waiting for death to approach this, take the time to say no sis. I don't hate ya, for having these little seeds. At 17, best believe they're a beautiful breeze. Of fresh air when their's nothing else, I usually need. Just a smile look at em now, hoping you just believe. And my broad been in place forever, I'm gone but I'm chasing cheddar. Been gone could of kept it going, with a poem or a basic letter. But naw I just hate to tell her, try hard but I didn't let her. The groupies get at you boy, but you're my Cinderella. Look girl we can make it better, but there's a gift and a curse. While you healing a nigga feelings, your's are usually hurt. It ain't amount of cash on Earth, to match what you really worth. Know your turf has been the church, that's where you put in work. And you put in overtime, because you noticed i'm. In more danger than I've been lately, rap is mo' than rhymes. But you still hold me down, I'ma do way mo' this time. Got some time that I need to manage, girl you know that's right. And that's speaken like a true deacon, cause even to see you sleeping. That comfortabally ain't enough for me, anything that you needing. I'll cease anything that squeaks, and cease any sink that leaks. Ain't nothing gon interrupt, your sleep deep into them sheets and peep. [Hook]. [Chamillionaire]. How your father call the police, have your mama put in the jail. When the arguments always started, and ended up in a cell. Hard to it was the thought of this, ring that you use to wear. As I darted out the apartment, and pawned it to get the bail. Argument after argument, drama wasn't getting well. Talking it ain't no harm in it, smart so I didn't tell. God that it was the hardest, yeah life was a living hell. Spent part of it steady dodging it, charging off fended trails. Father say he a Muslim, your mama say she a Christian. The Bible or the Koran, which one would you be picking. When the cards are in your palm, ain't really no use in tripping. Be true to the one you choose, ain't really no use in switching. Yeah they gon have to be mad at us, choice is something I had to trust. Standing up when I had enough, for my blessings not adding up. Take too many things for granted, right after that metal gat'll bust. Somebody's life is missing, that's when the spirit grabbing us. [Hook]. [Chamillionaire]. A religion is what you missing, someone tell me how can it. Make people panic, mention God and all the weak people vanish. Take God your woman and your family, even your own life for granted. Until you slanted on the planet, with your face in the granite. And I won't have it, I don't wanna see my culture divided. So I decided to remind it, there's a choice and provide it. So put your ego to the side, soon as you standing beside it. Raise your right hand, and let the spirit know it's invited. Don't need to fight it, I just wanna make it right before they bury me. Cause the truth is like therapy, plus my conscience is tearing me. Into pieces as death itself was not even fair to me. To the soldiers that passed in the game, we missing you terribly. Thank my family especially, in my mind like telepathy. Staying humble's the recipe, keep my faith and he blessing me. I use the energy left in me, to make sure they respecting me. Walk the steps of my destiny, like I know he protecting me. I'm a leader, believe the people won't get to see less of me. No they won't see the death of me, or no police arresting me. I live life so successfully, and just show em the best of me. On another level mentally, this position was meant for me. [Hook]"
waiting 4 my downfall,"(*talking*). Ha-ha, I know what y'all thinking mayn. Naw, it's not gon happen homie. Y'all already know what it is, Chamillitary mayn. Most hated and most anticipated, in the streets. Know I'm saying yours truely, (Southern Smoke). [Hook]. Keep waiting keep waiting, if you waiting for my downfall. The album's coming, and revenge'll be the sound boy. Haters keep waiting, if you waiting for my downfall. The album's coming, and revenge'll be the sound boy. Keep waiting keep waiting, if you waiting for my downfall. The album's coming, and revenge'll be the sound boy. They pray and pray, for my downfall. You can pray and pray, for my down naw. [Chamillionaire]. If you can bet a big fold, you better bet a big fold. Cause I know my album better, than whoever thinks no. For them Screw Heads, said they like it better when slowed. Get blowed, if you the type that like it better when thoed. Yella thick hoes, with them yellow kit toes. Love the way my necklace looking, like the yellow brick road. So they tip-toe, to my hotel tell me no. Dorothy don't wanna click her feet, then Koopa tell her get home. Wanna stay with Chamill', cause it's real it's not a tail. No imaginary drug scale, or made up client-tail. Whack weak is sorry, then the question asked is who. Could it be it's not me, cause King Koopa is the truth. Ain't gotta be a Sherlock, trying to figure out a clue. Since it's not me, the evidence will probably point at you. Sound of Revenge get it right, I put that life back in your life. Probably drop it now or later, put that life back in it twice. Uh-uh, I'm so cocky it's irritating. But it wouldn't be irritating, to any nigga that isn't hating. This is not a imitation, plexers get a invitation. Chamillitary radio, if youy don't like it switch the station. But you won't cause you do, so just admit it while I bring it. I'm the best rapper, not a punchline that got meanings. Uh niggaz hating, I ain't even really tripping. In the South, when they open that mouth I zip em. But sometimes, I be in a tough position. Cause the track listen'er, might tell you that I'm still dissing. Even when I'm not dissing, but I'm like so what. They can feel the way they feel, as long as they just keep it shut. But what-what, I see the new Source and open it up. And I'm like what hol' up, I don't mean to interrupt. But let me stop myself, before the drama turn to havoc. I get back in the streets, and let these stunting faggots have it. Go back to what you doing, riding dick and tossing salad. While I'm crawling like a crab, and yelling balling is a habit baby. [Hook]"
war at your door (freemix) (feat. yelawolf & trae tha truth),"[Intro:]. I'm coming home, I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming home. Let the rain wash away. All the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits. And they've forgiven my mistakes. I'm coming home, I'm coming home. Tell the wolrd I'm coming home. [Chorus: Chamillionaire]. In this game it seems. that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more. Hit 'em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy. It's like I'm bringing war to your front door. In this game it seems. that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more. Hit 'em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy. It's like I'm bringing war to your front door, front door. [Verse 1: Chamillionaire]. Look how I lyrically assainate a verse then. I can get a hooker shot like ervin. You never bust repping just like you a virgin. Under your girl done hitting a belly like a surgeon. A hundred milli gotta get it brr Birdman. Christina Milian she ain't got her man. And I don't have no dreams either, I'm working. Surfing the earth and tryna stay urban. You see the heater poking out I got the shirt in. All of these rappers getting jerked without the jurgens. The similes and metaphors. that I be serving gone right over their head, hot turbans. I got a business manager and she a persian. Ain't got a deal with Eminem but I am burning. Hot, got a lawyer he's really a diversion. I'm riding dirtier than 30 days with no detergent. Ain't really with the beef but the tweets I get at you. If I ever see you in the streets I'm a slap you. I don't mean LeBron when the Heat coming at you. Cover up and duck like him lay tatoo. All this cake getting flipped like a spatula. Not a act like a chat I'm a natural. Suits tried to take me out the game what did that do. Still here like the name of an ear statue. Bread cheese here funds really high. Work in the strip club and throw my lunch in the sky. Front til you die while I spend a month in Dubai. I'm a guard in the streets alhamdulillah. Test and I bet that you gon' flunk when you try. I don't even gotta use my gun to reply. You get punched in the eye, punched in the eye. What is a tie all you can blood finna fly. [Chorus: Chamillionaire]. In this game it seems. that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more. Hit 'em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy. It's like I'm bringing war to your front door. In this game it seems. that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more. Hit 'em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy. It's like I'm bringing war to your front door, front door. [Verse 2: Yelawolf]. Half of these motherfucking rappers don't know shit. Ain't seen a gansta ain't seen a brick. And they wonder why. when the OG's come around Yelawolf. I get the respect I get. Cause I never walk into another man's house. And tell him what I think about the way he live. I done a little dirt on my own. And I won't throw stones. So I get back what I give. Reach for the tool homeboy go ahead. If you wanna be dead homie be dead. Who am I to be thinkin that I won't pop a trunk. If you feelin like a punk. From the he said she said. Life's not a choice it's a win or lose. So what's it gonna be, him or you?. Did he lie on your bed, did she lie to your head?. Well, it all depends on the truth. See I'm realistic and everyday can't be terrific. I done see one of my boys get ticked off. and put his hands on a dirty AK and lifted it. Up in the air, and then saw him carried him. Into the club, I know he wanted to bury 'em. My crew is laughing, I was scared as fuck. and they thought it was hilarious. [Chorus 2: Chamillionaire]. In this game it seems that I'm lyrically. Reaching a point where it's not fair no more. Hit em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy. It's like I'm bringing war to your front door. In this game it seems that I'm lyrically. Reaching a point where it's not fair no more. Hit em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy. (Yelawolf). It's just another day outside my door. [Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]. Yeah, I'm a let you take a second to introduce you to pain. Where everybody going through it and going insane. The inner struggle but they focused on making they change. Anybody get it away and they making it rain. If it go to me I'll probably be doing the same. If I ever could I'll forever be repping the same game. Rapping on thinking I promise I'll get the same thing. In the back of the maybach outside of somebody name. Getting brain like I was only here to learn something. Fucking with me I guarantee I'm a return some. Raise some drama then show up tryna burn some. I do my dirt and then I never pay it back. I'm dealing with it and never taking it. You can't respect, the city been awake. Never get attacked, got it, I can't hear nobody taking that. Wanna hit the block and wanna thug? dreaming to get away. And to the love I got for the streets, the hood. Call up any nigga who come that. and try to fit in I send them away. Yelawolf go get the whip I got this. I open the gate ain't no way they could stop this. They want it with us, you can tell em about this. Looking for something pretty, you can em it's not this. [Chorus 2]. In this game it seems that I'm lyrically. Reaching a point where it's not fair no more. Hit em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy. It's like I'm bringing war to your front door. [Verse 4: Chamillionaire]. See the barrel shoot in the tank I'm in the cockpit. Bullets that'll jump on your head like it's a moshpit. Even if you're wearing a bulletproof outfit. I got a batman you go and robbin like a sidekick. The rap game really my chick. Topic is whether Chamillionaire is the topic. Put 'em on the line I'm telling you that I got this. Autograph the weapon I'm hitting you with a shot whip. Multi multi million dollar bow tie. still be a clown it's equivalent to cho chi. Go and die know. why he will tell the most lies most likely to get hit with the 4 5. Yo price pow hit 'em with the scorcher. what you know about the Chinese, water torture. Can't run from the lyricism cause it caught ya. Write it when I'm in your nightmare like an author. West craving the world what I'm saving. I got a halla tip that I brought for the occasion. I put it in a weapon that was made by an Asian. My mind is a maze and that means that I'm amazing. Your girl call me papi coming with a posse. Everybody black I'm the opposite of nazi. In the major label they be thinking I'm Gaddafi. I'm taking out anyone who thinkin they can stop me. [Chorus 2]. In this game it seems that I'm lyrically. Reaching a point where it's not fair no more. Hit em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy. It's like I'm bringing war to your front door. [Verse 5: Yelawolf]. Pray on my God, I believe it's too hard. Don't reach for the dogs who believe the facades. Don't reach too far to compete with the dog. Because deep in the heart they wanna? this all. I wish I could be the one to say I warned ya. Don't pay any attention. Man I wanna ignore the haters. But I can't afford to leave them alone. They say Yelawolf ain't never been in the dark. And trailerparks and made their mark. I gotta make it hot cause I was given a pardon. I gotta play the role. Serial killing rap, cause I had a serial code. In every city with a cereal bowl. When I rap, peer in my soul. I'm in the light like a deer in the road. Clear in control, my spirit is old. I'm hearing the Gold I'm hearing the foes, hoes. And it falls like a rock don't mean you hard like one. You want the credit for getting gutter forget it. You ma'fuckers forgot the credit card and run. Street credit won't put bullets in ya gun. But it might put a stray bullet in your son. Daughters, uncles, aunts, friends and nusiance. Become tangled up when it comes undone. [Chorus]. In this game it seems. that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more. Hit 'em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy. It's like I'm bringing war to your front door. In this game it seems. that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more. Hit 'em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy. It's like I'm bringing war to your front door, front door"
warn you,"First of all let me alert you that theres been a change. in plans. Cause now I plan to put the streets into major trans. Told me I couldn't drive a real beef the way that I. had planned. I'm the one who couldn't work, don't disrespect my. achin hands. Feed the streets and feed the fans, you tryin to tell. me that's your stance?. Better not piss the majors off, you better go and make. amends. Ever go against the ? Koopa you wont stand a chance. Soon as you think you ice cold you get hit with a. avalanche. Jump up and down like a monkey, take banana make em. dance. When you do they'll take your back if you aint down. with they demands. Throw a million in the jeans, tell ya that these they. favorite pants. You can put em on for grands and tell em 'keep your. fake advance'. First of all I wanna extend a very humble middle. finger. To those that don't take me serious like I'm Jerry. Springer. I'm not a dreamer went from a schemer to ridin beamer. I open the bag, chips better be in it like it's. keebler. I'm not a diva I slept on the same floor as others. With no covers and split what I had with four. brothers. You don't love us, you handle us like aint no rubbers. Impregnated your pockets so my .44 wanna say-ay-ay. hello to ya. No 50-50, no young ro, and it's no rasaq then what do. you get. No more color changin clique and a bunch of fans that. aint forget. Some of yall was claimin I was the only one in the. game could spit. Now that everybody split, you on the dick you make me. sick. I'm not here to babysit, I'm just here to make the. chips. I'm just gonna make this quick for some ???. I know a couple people I can point the finger at. But everytime you point a finger it's three fingers. pointin back. The average Joe you see will be someone who actin. shady. And it aint no ? you wont forever be my lady. No I aint lazy but sweat that I think I'm crazy. Remember every moment from every person that ever. tried to play me. Before you die your life will flash before your eyes. wow. Well if thats true your life will flash before your. eyes now. Everyone is quite foul I get revenge you like ""how?"". Eye for an eye a bullet burned below your eyebrow. I hear the drummer drummin he told me that death is. comin. Death is comin for you tonight just like a freaky. woman. Aint dimmin down my bright that's shinin now as I. write this. Might I remind you that being smart made me quite. rich. Lifes a ? full of addiction with a cold body. Got complaints, but I am respectin her so highly. How could I let a clue so obvious flow by me. From the jump ? told me that he would be a NO-body. Maybe I'm rehashing my thoughts just to get a. response. They say that bad publicity's publicity that you want. Who wanna jump, ribbit with it I'm the one who. distribit. This crack cause I live it so you gon' get it just how. i give it. And you suckas at the top, we gon' talk in a minute. I'm posted up on the block, bout to get on my pivot. Was never in love with money I thought I was but it. all was lust. They cut the budget but it's ok, we shall adjust. No failure cause success is a must. When I clean up I won't ever forget to wipe down the. dust. So dust your shoulders off and get your favorite. recipe. Get in the kitchen with me we gon' have a special. feast. Everyone that don't know, tryin to tell me whats best. for me. Deep in the game you in the bleachers tryin to. referee. So when they ask for a clue and whats next with me. Commandin control is #2 and the sneak attack will be. #3. Don't say I didn't warn you."

we all done (i'm on one freestyle),"[Intro]. They like where you been man. I'm like you'll find out when you need to know. Poison, coming soon. H-town so throwed. If I said it then you know it's what I mean. I do it all from my home. Cause that's who got me thinking I'm the damn king. I pro'ly hurt a few feelings. Cause y'all be trickin' on ‘em way too easy. See you can feed a few pigeons. That's when you realise them hoes a tease. Live from the Bahamas. I gotta be honest. Working on a classic gotta forgive me for my silence. Swear it felt like college, knowledge that you gave was timeless. Knew that you had good brain, I knew you'd graduate with honours. My P was the finest, bowing like she paying homage. Pulling that ponytail girl what you mix with Pochahontos. Cesa triple zeros, working jumping over commas. You can say that I gave you love but you can't say I gave a promise. Girl no dollars. And girl I'd love to kick it wit' ya but you know I gotta run. And stack some hundreds inbetween my trigger finger and my thumb. It was lovely while it lasted but I think the time has come. Hope you keep your composure when I say that it's over. We all done. Darling, we all done. She said I'm on one. Now that we're all done, done, done. I might not cuff and I might not trick. I might just split cause we don't just fit. Don't come back cause she might be sick. Cause she might be the one that I say I'm not with. When we all done. Now that we're all done, done, done. Loving the way she grip me. Loving the way my grip be. Feeling off in my pockets… and she history. Legends like Snoop and 50. Maybach Coupe like Ricky. Feeling just like my dick be weighing a tonne off in my dickies. Ball like Kenneth Griffey, hit it like Kenneth Griffey. They say stay on your toes, that's why I'm always on my tippies. Watch the people close incase any one of y'all acting shifty. Lipstick on my hollow tip don't let this clique give you a hicky. Posted in between the pillow, laying near in the pyjamas. With the slickest Texas rhymer that's when you know you can find her. Tell the dead I'm out of time, you know that that's a problem I'ma make her say. I know you didn't got her sounding just like Wonda. The 16th I be in Vegas, 26th I be in China. Booked 'til August, I come back and drop a mixtape in my honour. We live from the Bahamas, hope her panties is designer. I had your girl interior decorating her vagina. And girl I'd love to kick it wit' ya but you know I gotta run. And stack some hundreds inbetween my trigger finger and my thumb. It was lovely while it lasted but I think the time has come. Hope you keep your composure when I say that it's over. We all done. Darling, we all done. She said I'm on one. Now that we're all done, done, done. I might not cuff and I might not trick. I might just split cause we don't just fit. Don't come back cause she might be sick. Cause she might be the one that I say I'm not with. She said I'm on one. Now that we're all done, done, done"

I don't even wanna see ya,. The sight of you is givin' me a fever,. Think I need a breather,. Need ya to give me space,. And leave the, past in the past,. And keep walkin' pass,. When they say that we a,. Match made in heaven,. Tell 'em I said that that's a lie,. So disrespectful,. I feel like I've wasted half my life,. That's why I ain't in love,. Try to say I ain't in love,. Then I go right back on my word,. And we end up makin' up, hold up. . [Chorus:]. I try and try to stay in love,. But no matter what I do,. It just ain't enough,.

And I think I spot ya,. Thinkin' I forgot ya,. And I'm movin' on 'cause I think I gotta,. See I end up losin',. Everytime that I try to think I got ya,. 'Cause you always move,. And I want to,. But I ain't gon' even stop ya,. You be all in my pocekts like feed me,. Makin' this type of livin' ain't easy,. I be givin' my all to you,. All you do is be talkin' greasy,. And I know you probably don't believe me,. Everytime that you say that you'd leave me,. I be gettin' impatient,. And waitin', hopin' that you'd make it speedy,. So I figured, I'd tell ya the truth,. 'Cause I knew that it would free me,. Give ya everything that I could,. But you still kept actin' greedy,. You let the world come inside,. You shouldn't had been actin' sleezy,. 'Cause now you pregnant,. With rappers that lie on half their cds. . [Chorus:]. I try and try to stay in love,. But no matter what I do,. It just ain't enough,. It ain't enough,. It ain't enough,.

When I'm no longer around,. Nah, don't even try to start cryin',. After you built me up,. And then tried to break me down,. It's just a matter of time,. Before I had to give you a piece of my mind,. And maybe I could spend the rest of my time,. Havin' peace in mind,. You couldn't even say one thing,. That you know that no one know,. Everytime I see you gossipin' about so and so,. You immitate,. You instigate,. You turn love, into instant hate,. You the reason why I punched my ex-homeboy in the face,. In the streets,. Chasin' the same money I gotta give to my lawyer to win a case,. Tearin' up my rap sheet,. 'Cause now I got a rap sheet that can't get erased. By Jamun*"

Down here all that matters is, how much you real. I'ma give it to you straight like poppin' a pill. Before the south gotta deal, been swangin' big wheels. [Verse 2: Chamillionaire]. Flippin' Benz, bubble-lens, feed ya tank a number 10. If ya pimpin', her and friends, I ain't trippin' get ya ins. If ya been, in the pen', pop this in and lift ya chin. Tat skin, get some ins, and throw some glitter in ya grin. Man, once again, but this dank off in the wind. If you don't smoke, then that's for them, put some drank off in ya chin. Remember back about 10, majors wouldn't let us in. Servin' school is a lifestyle, but they treat it like it's a trend. Man, they like ""Koopa tell me where the hell you been"". Man, I been dealin' with family, and takin' care of Ben. Franklin, ain't the end, I was here when it begin. See if ya ridin' Davin rims, celebrate by lettin' em' spin. I bought some new ones in, to replace the older rims. What type of rims? that depends is it the truck, the bike, or van. Had to hop out, and stop my spinners on the rims. My alarm kept detecting motion pokin' out of them. Man, I'm just sayin', yall know Koopa don't be playin'. I'm just sayin', I be layin' with the flat TV's displayin'. Sometimes I feel like grippin', sometimes I'm tippin'. Niggaz in the streets tryin' to find out if it's written. Haha..Yo, Chamillitary man!"
we'll make it,"Yeah, never had a lot I swear. We all came up from nothing Mayne. Gotta do it for state (for the state). Yeah, anybody got a problem with it. Then we riding Mayne. We say what we wanna say. Of course we do. We wake up when we wanna wake up. We do what we wanna do. I'm not bragging I'm just saying. Somebody said I'm too confident. You're right, I'm the only confident rapper in the world. {Chamillionaire}. Been the man, that's why I'm going in on. any instrumental that'll catch a leak. Took a break to get the business straight. Then I come right back and never miss a beat. It ain't another as sick as me, and anybody that. disagree can go out a helicopter now. and don't try to breath 'til you hit the seat. Most people only call you up. when they want something, like the horny chick. The green ain't what you gonna get. but I'ma hang it up like an ornament. I promise y'all that I ain't have it all. Lord knows I wasn't born as rich. They keep telling me that I should pass the rock. I gotta get some points, it's no more assists. Get crossed over with the cross over. See the cross holder got my charm colder. Like it's October in a dark Rover. Gotta stunt on 'em I'ma car show ya. like I'm John Wall watch 'em all fall. Like a power forward that was non-sober. If you're loyal then I got it all for you. It's Chamillitary let's ball soldier. {Chorus}. Some say they don't like me. Some say I'm amazing (amazing, amazing). Some say I'm too cocky, some tell me I'm jaded. If I'm jaded, then I'm jaded. But I'll make it, hmn!. That's why I go hard go hard go hard for. my whole squad 'til we make it, hmn!. We came up from nothing but we gone live so good. We came up from nothing. see you there when we make it. We'll make it. {Chamillionaire}. They say it all, but don't mean it all. Man what y'all trying to be politicians?. Herman Cain's none of y'all. Gonna make it in the Oval Office, no competition. I got the vision, don't got permission. But that don't mean they'll stop the mission. That don't mean cause they got opinions that. I'll pop a squat like I'm 'bout to listen. If you're fake then we'll see you're fake. Lyrics courtesy of ww. eliterics. com. It ain't really no faking that. You'll never make it in these woods. Hope that you got a safety pack. Everybody want a favor now. I ain't never had faith in that. Don't come to me with your hands out. If you ain't showing up with no cake attached. Cause they got it locked, I'm gone break the latch. But this ain't about what I'm about to get. Rep the Texas; anytime I left. I came back to Texas like Popovitch. Some people tell me I'm cocky. But I just feel like I'm confident. Everybody else is about sloppiness. And I'm opposite so I'm mopping it. {Chorus}. Some say they don't like me. Some say I'm amazing (amazing, amazing). Some say I'm too cocky, some tell me I'm jaded. If I'm jaded, then I'm jaded. But I'll make it, hmn!. That's why I go hard go hard go hard for. my whole squad 'til we make it, hmn!. We came up from nothing but we gone live so good. We came up from nothing. see you there when we make it. We'll make it. {Chamillionaire}. You got all the answers. Go and get the same results. People trying to do evil. but you can't let them boys change your thoughts. To tell the truth I have a few friends. that didn't realize that I cut 'em off. But if you knew me then you should know. that I hate pessimism plus I'm a boss. Take a trip back around the world. It ain't a place where I ain't stood. Never ever claim to be gangsta. but keep it gangsta like they should. They don't even know who they are. This the reason they ain't good. They ain't comfortable in their own styles. Their rhyming patterns are Ace Hood's"
welcome to the hood (freemix),"Attention it's the general and I mean this is silly. Just listen clearly I know everyone who really hear me. Got off the label you can record deal me but can't kill me. And if they get mad about this verse they probably get to me. I get it done my middle name should be done and straight. Hustle outta Maybach is how I meditate. I'm the one who repped the city up in yellow tape. You buy commercials on radio to celebrate. The... wasn't something I could ever take. When you're this sick there's nothing you can medicate. I'm the one Texas rapper that'll get it straight. I say a nickname bet your label never takes. Super fast or super slow bang it down rewind this. New rapper get on and watch how everybody rhymes switch. Y'all fakin' cakin' you can miss me with the kindness. Y'all some puppets that I wasn't tryna ride the pawn with. Nah I don't ride dick when. I turn it up real quick you better duck your head. Really none of y'all is better when it's touching bread. I have a mill and make a mill before I touch my bed. Can't get dropped, gon' get gwopped, don't get got. Don't flip flop, your chick hot, won't live lot. I don't got time, no tick tock. Remember DJs who tried to charge us to play our songs. We got Sirotto... and we made our own. Who think I'm lying, point out the person that say I'm wrong. I will abuse you like children hold up, no any long. Karma keeps eating my checks, I call 'em iChecks. Wait up I got my weight up and ain't touched the Pyrex. Wait up you got your weight up homie, nah uh not yet. T-Pain use autotune, what they do? Auto tune. Jay-Z performin' we just watch them copy all his moves. Monkey see monkey do. They say take each his own. If this who we gon' let get on then all of y'all can keep it grown"
welcome to the south,"[Chorus]. [Chamillionaire]. Welcome to the South. Try to criticize us for how we live. They gon do the same things that we just did. Betta watch your mouth. Try to criticize us for how we spit. Then say you respect the money that we get. Welcome to the south. Watch em criticize everything we did. And expect that us to never even trip. We know them grills and candy paint. So be careful what you say. Cuz we might just throw it right back in your face. Betta watch your mouth. [Verse 1]. [Chamillionaire]. Uh I cross the globe. I hit a hater. Same whispers from state to state. If you didn't say then this aint for you. Don't worry bout it cuz you can't relate. Before you buy me then you criticize me. While you beside me. Lets get it straight. Cuz you remind me of the kid beside me. Same rapper that you say you hate. Wanna criticize then fine. Say the south got simple rhymes. Everytime I travel i'm in the backyard that act just like mine. Same rhyme just different times. I don't think that it changed a lil. Used to show our grills and they be like ew. Nowadays they all say thats ill. I remember when the major label. Wouldn't even come pay a visit. Used to say they had love for us but. They just blowin them suspect kisses. Now you watchin me see you plottin me. Can't act like we ain't suspicious. Shoot the slugs you shoot at us but when you bust your thang it misses, uh. I aint leavin much trippin. Cuz im a man where i'm residing. Im decidin where i'm residing. Should never tolerate domestic violence. I know you'd rather me just relax and sit back in silence. But i'm the owner not just the client. Shit the south is where I stay at. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. [Chamillionaire]. . Don't knock the swagga, dont knock the swagga. Then turn around and be a swagger jacker. You a man and you should be a man. Don't walk around without an Adam's apple. We was lookin at it from a distance. But we wasn't trippin cuz it had to happen. Styrophone cup and a snapla, you actin like you been a fan of rappers. You was hatin or participatin when you saw sub anuba slidin through. You and everybody else that did it, they applauded them and they applauded you. You actin like somebody made ya say it. Took your hand and then applied the glue. Turn around and give the mic to you. And now you end up lookin like a fool. Can't holla ya, some followers. and thats the reason i'm in the lead. The rest of yall are some benchwarmers and gettin mad cuz I'm in the lead. I'm switchin speeds, don't get fatigued. Yall behind in line, yall chasin me. Yall finna see my energy, so get off my back and let a playa breathe. I won't lie and act like i'm the one supportin everything. Like southern rappers ain't never lame. Like some of these boys don't eff up the game. Most of us do our thang. And the rest of em leave my ears in pain. But thats him and he sure aint me. So don't look at us like we all the same. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. [Pimp C]. South side candy rider. Never been a socializer. Flyin high, work grinder, knock ya gal you can't find her. She was sittin on butter. Hundred thousand under her ass. I was workin the wood, circle smokin candy mashin on the gas. I can't be you, I can't do you. I just do me, if you ain't. Been where I been then you can't. Be who I be if you ain't. Seen what I see and you can't see what I see. I put the bricks in the rolla with slabs on that wasn't free. Been a legend in the south since the year '93. Pocket full of stones, menace to society. The heart in the car chrome and folds, not B's. Now everybody pimpin and they all got keys. Nigga please, you work for UPS. They say they smokin dro but all I keep smellin is stress. I roll with the best. 92 million screwin the Lexus. I might not be nothin to you. But i'm the shit in that Texas. Welcome to the South (fading). By Jamun*"
