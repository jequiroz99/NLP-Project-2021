A lost when a bitch don't wanna give you nothing dawg telling you dawg u can make something happen. [Chorus: x2]. My money looking funny nigga just making it barely shit ain't how it use to be nigga ain't. Fronting the package gotta choke me a bitch outta something I gotta have it I'm on my. Dick dawg gotta make something happen. [Verse 1:]. When a nigga money fucked up it's hard for him to think straight. Seem like a nigga life in park when he ain't got cake. First thing that cross a bitch mind shid he gotta take. U can stay broke forever or u can make a shape. Cause when u broke bitch talk to u any kinda way. U on ya dick bitch don't wanna here shit u gotta say. If u ain't built for this street shit den get out the way. Cause when a nigga broke everybody's fucking gravy. U either get money out chere or u fucking hate. U think a nigga gone give u something den keep waiting. U betta suck up yo mufucking pride and chase it. Cause when a nigga broke he ain't pose to have patients. [Chorus: x2]. My money looking funny nigga just making it barely shit ain't how it use to be nigga ain't. Fronting the package gotta choke me a bitch outta something I gotta have it I'm on my. Dick dawg gotta make something happen. [Verse 2:]. I don't kno if god trying to punish me or my luck just bad. I don't kno which one of em it is but I need some fucking cash. I rather be in prison broke then out here without a stash. They say when it rains it purs then how will it last. Before I let it rain on me I'm a let a bitch crash. With all black on chie 5 and ske mask. The streets judge off wat u got not wat u had. I took a lost and it hurt me fucked me up bad. It ain't no feeling in the world like loosing ya last. I ain't got no choice I'm fucked up gotta bounce back. Seems like it take forever to get to get it but u can loose it fast. I rather a mufucka vist me while sitting behind a glass. [Chorus: x2]. My money looking funny nigga just making it barely shit ain't how it use to be nigga ain't. Fronting the package gotta choke me a bitch outta something I gotta have it I'm on my. Dick dawg gotta make something happen. [Verse 3:]. The nigga that invented robbing I bet he was broke. Cause when u fucked up out her it ain't no fucking joke. And all bets off when a nigga money low. A nigga willing to take chances he ain't neva took before. And willing to cross a mufucka for the love of the dough. I can't fault nigga cause I done did that shit before. If u gone take it just be ready to play it how it go. It's every nigga for self this shit cut throat. I bet I past me a nigga for he past me tho. For every nigga balling it's a hundred niggas hunting. I don't kno if he told but these yung niggas thuggin. So why u outta balling it's some niggas riding lucky. [Chorus: x2].

If you ain't got 5, you better not stunt. Hood cut throat, can't even front. Bentley alright, get more attention than the donk. No shirt, pants saggin' with big charm. If it ain't top of the line, I don't want that blunt. Geeked in this trap, come through the front. Jack boys ridin', tryna find what they want. Ball last night, 4 g's what I spun. Before you fuckin' wit me, better take his lunch. 'Cuz, if you get behind me, then i'm gon' punch. 554's under the hood, will run. 'Cuz i'm from the hood, and this is how it done.. [Refrão]"

1 day,"[Intro: Speaking]. Man I hope y'all can excuse me for a little minute man.. Just sitting here thinking about my lil partner who just got killed. It's wild dog, how the mother fucker you love the most,. Seem like them the ones who always die first. Dog I just wish I had the opportunity. To just bring my nigga back for 1 day hommie.. [Chorus:]. Wish I could bring my nigga back for 1 day,. Taking by the daycare to see his son play. Then go to show'em how his baby mom then went astray. And how the fuck niggas that claim. They love him then walked away [x2]. [Verse 1:]. God give me my nigga for 24 hours, so we can ride. And laugh at these pussy ass cowards. Hit the liquor store, park and just talk for hours. Show'em how after a nigga die, how they loose they power. Nigga forget about you dog, after they give you them flowers. O'l tryflin ass baby mom, then got wilder. Now she fucking that nigga you robbed with the pink impala. And like I told you before dog that hoe sour. And you can fuck these hoes dog but don't howl em. Bitch you ain't got shit dog, money arouse them. After a nigga dead and gone they loose they value. Hoe cried at your funeral, and changed right after. [Chorus:]. Wish I could bring my nigga back for 1 day,. Taking by the daycare to see his son play. Then go to show'em how his baby mom then went astray. And how the fuck niggas that claim they love him then walked away [x2]. [Verse 2:]. When you first died niggas set around your momma all day. But since your funeral them niggas ain't went that fucking way. Thought when you die your dog suppose step to the plate. You ain't got to worry, I gotta I'm make sure she straight. Make you question if the love was real or was it fake. Outta sight, outta mind guess it's true what they say. When you was here them was the main niggas in your face. You ain't gotta deal with them fuck niggas, you in a better place. I almost cried when I seen your son the other day. You couldn't deny that one, boy look like you all the way. I thought love was forever, I guess that ain't the case. First you die, then they bury u, then niggas walk away. [Chorus:]. Wish I could bring my nigga back for 1 day,. Taking by the daycare to see his son play. Then go to show'em how his baby mom then went astray. And how the fuck niggas that claim they love him then walked away [x2]. [Verse 3:]. I'm sitting right here hommie, eyes full a tears. Never thought that pain last this many years. One thing I learned from all this shit, life real. Rep your name till I die, hommie that's how I feel. Watched how everything changed, since you got killed. Two days after you died, niggas broke in your crib. Niggas saying your lil cousin, the one who stole your wheel. This shit probably shouldn't fuck with me, but it really is. Motherfuckers showed me what shisty really is. What going to happen after I die, one of my biggest fears. Seeing what my partner then been through, got me scared as hell. I pray the god my life don't end like his. [Chorus:]. Wish I could bring my nigga back for 1 day,. Taking by the daycare to see his son play. Then go to show'em how his baby mom then went astray. And how the fuck niggas that claim they love him then walked away [x2]"

My dog went to court today they gave him fifteen. Cracker banned my lil' nigga he was se'enteen. Young nigga don't even know what all that time mean. Pussy ass crackers done shattered my nigga dreams. They holl'in' mandatory they want him to do the whole thang. Nigga showed up in court on my dog and did his thang. Nigga did my nigga now I got to bust his brain. Nigga woulda did me my dog'd do the same. His lady callin' me cryin' and now I feel her pain. Tired of losin' all my niggas to the chain gang. In thirty minutes a nigga whole life can change. Cracker over sinister niggas when this shit gon' change?. Pussy ass cracker give a nigga a hundred years. Have ya mama leavin' out the courtroom in tears. Crackers don't love to have a nigga breathin' for real. Take a nigga life from him they don't know how it feel. Pussy ass cracker give a nigga a hundred years. Have ya mama leavin' out the courtroom in tears. Crackers don't love to have a nigga breathin' for real. Take a nigga life from him they don't know how it feel. Ain't talked to my dog yet but I know he sick. Next fifteen years of his life behind a fence. Cracker find a nigga guilty and hit him wit' the bench. Gave one of my dogs twenty-seven on his first offense. The time they givin' the nigga for the crime ain't makin' sense. They jacked the number up now it's eighty-five percent. They did that to make you fuck niggas out there snitch. And put conspiracy in the game to railroad the click. And crackers feel like niggas ain't got no common sense. A nigga paper ain't right they banned off the rip. A public defender don't get you shit but a long trip. And judge sentencin innocent niggas without a guilt. How in the fuck can fo' birds get you a life sentence?. But give a cracker seven years for money launderin' millions. Shoot a nigga in the leg they sentence you like you killed 'em. Cracker catch you wit' that iron and throw you under the buildin'. You a nigga that mean you guilty 'til proven innocent. Money talk and bullshit walk a thousand miles. You ain't got a paid lawyer then don't go to trial. Crackers owe each other favors, they'll swap ya out. ""You give us him, we'll give you him"" know what I'm talkin' 'bout. Nigga took thirty years on a cop out. Fuck you get thirty years for breakin' in a bitch house?.

2nd chance,"I went to see my nigga, he doin' seventeen. One of the realist niggas, I done ever seen. Got caught wit' a bird, but his record was clean. Comin' back from Dade, on da Gator wit' speed. He a real soldier, but his partner was greed. Get out when he fourty, went in at twenty-three. How seventeen years worth one key. Some shit cost twenty-grand can get you over ten piece. He ain't wanna hurt nobody, he was just tryna eat. He had a real job, went to work four days a week. Said this his last trip, and he was gettin' out the streets. He a good nigga, second chance all he need. Some niggas make mistakes, off fucked up circumstance. Now they life gone, probably gon' die in the pen. They done gave up on life and put it in God's hands. I thought this was America, what happened to a second chance?. Wish I had one chance, to sentence the Judge kids. And watch 'em beg for they life like my niggas did. Give them a life sentence fo' some shit that wasn't big. 'Fore they get granted they appeal they gotta do ten. Shoe gotta be on the otha foot for you to understand. The scariest shit in the world to be a black man. What my future holds, wish I knew in advance. I approach life everyday just hopin' I win. A lot us already lost, we sittin' in the pen. This shit crazy 'cause God, he forgive sin. But when it come to the system that shit don't bend. I guess it do, dependin' on the color of yo' skin. Some niggas make mistakes, off fucked up circumstance. Now they life gone, probably gon' die in the pen. They done gave up on life and put it in God's hands. I thought this was America, what happened to a second chance?. I thought it was understood, nobody was perfect. So, how can one mistake make yo' life worthless. God made us all, put us here to serve a purpose. Yo life in twelve strangers hands to come back with a verdict. But is that really fair, what if they all was dirty. You mess up one time, and they come back with thirty. But if you ain't got money, yo whole family hurtin'. Then you ain't got a choice, you gotta cop out early. But if you was rich, you wouldn'ta got them thirty. What if the Judge racist, nobody'd overturn it. The system fucked up, because it ain't sturdy. Welcome to America, home of the controversy. Some niggas make mistakes, off fucked up circumstance. Now they life gone, probably gon' die in the pen. They done gave up on life and put it in God's hands. I thought this was America, what happened to a second chance?. by Romero"

With your windows wound up with your shit cocked. Cuz them crackers gon have you on the news at six'o' clock. Slumped over in your shit with a head shot. Cuz if it look sweet niggas tryin off top. The last four days around here a bitch done got shot. And all you see is yellow tape and white chalk. Thats where the doors get kicked, heads get bussed. And run your dick sucker live will get you clapped up. Cuz them hot slugs will fill yo lil ass up. So if you think it look fishy you better buss. Cuz you in a chopper zone and choppers is a must. . [Verse 3:]. The funeral home down here nigga its big business. I aint seen a fight in five years boy niggas spittin. When niggas shoot choppers hard to do too much missin. Niggas gettin up on ya ass now, aint no long distance. You see a nigga bend that corner you better start shippin. Cuz its too late to move when that thang start rippin. Dont take nothin but one of them hot ones to leave yo ass finished. And that lil mouth you got on you gon leave yo azz drippin!"

Never snake me, and get me knocked off. Niggas like hos, love to run they fuckin' mouth. Speak to them in the streets, won't bring them to my house. I don't trust neither bitch, north or the south. Won't be around me tryna scope it out. That SUPAfriendly shit, ain't about. Iono him, keep him from round me. Tryna peep somethin'?. What you tryna see?. Never get that close to find out where I be. I don't know that nigga. Get him from 'round me... [x2]. Stay in my own lane. Mind my own bidness. Hit my own licks. Get my own pennies. Keep these niggas from round me, cause I ain't friendly. You'll never slide up under me and be my co-defendant. Niggas come around, guess what? I stop talkin'. Holla at chu niggas later, grab my shit and start walkin'. Fuck that shit, I done seen too much. It seem niggas scope niggas and gettin' niggas touched. Get in friends wit niggas, turn 'round and set 'em up. Even my own dawg, talk to 'em bout certain stuff. My own friends come around, nigga I hush. Outside of court rooms, nigga I done seen enough. Time to get money, i'm so loyal. 4 deep doin' business, that's a no-no. Cause what a nigga thinkin', you will never know. But do my own time nigga, if I have to go. [x2]. Stay in my own lane. Mind my own bidness. Hit my own licks. Get my own pennies. Keep these niggas from round me, cause I ain't friendly. You'll never slide up under me and be my co-defendant!. Ion fuck wit no nigga, who got alotta friends. Cause you never know, who that nigga want to win. You vibe wit too many niggas, you spread yaself then. And them the type of niggas, know everybody business then. Nigga too friendly, no tellin' who he wit. You niggas fuck wit any nigga, you can't do it big. Guarenteed you will neva slide up under kid. I keep my eyes open, and my fire hid. That's how I stay away, from all the fuck shit. I gotta couple homeboys, but I don't run wit clique. The least a nigga know, the less he can snitch. I run solo, so I don't have to kill a bitch. [x2]. Stay in my own lane. Mind my own bidness. Hit my own licks. Get my own pennies. Keep these niggas from round me, cause I ain't friendly.

Grandma on a kidney machine, she done lost all the weight. My aunty got AIDS, she startin' to lose her faith. My brutha back in prison, second time he gone away. My daddy still smokin' dat shit I can see it in his face. My cousin 16 pregnant from a nigga 38. Tryna stay on my son, make sure he doin what his mama say. Before ya take me God, help me get my family straight. I asked God why he didn't bless me with a silver spoon. Cause if he did I'd never have to be a goon. If he gon' change my family, I hope he change it soon. I'm tired of answerin' my phone hearin' bad news. My grandma on a walker she can barely move. Just to tell me she love me take all her breath to do. She on a kidney machine I kno it's hurtin' her 2. Four times a week gotta get her blood drew. She say the bible and prayer the only thing that get her through. Why my grandma deserve this, god what did she do?. Thought caus' I had a lil money I could buy her a new. She hold the family together, she one I cant loose. [Refrão]. My aunty got AIDS and I'm watchin her suffer. Why she gotta die caus' she was in love with a hustler. Even tho she's dying she say she still love him. I kno if I see him again I'll kill dat muthafucker. Only get 15 minutes to talk to my brutha. Cause he in prison gotta go see him if I wanna hug him. Sum niggas willin to loose their freedom just for thuggin. Caus' he made a mistake gotta be here caus' I love him. Uncle just called me found out his daughter fuckin,. fuckin when they get 14 now like its nothing. In da hood it's happenin' 10 out of a dozen. Dat nigga her daddy age dat is fuckin my lil cousin. [Refrão]. My daddy damn near 50 still livin' with his momma. Can't even have a family reunion caus' it's always drama. Last three months I dun lost both of my uncles. Why my family luck so bad, I sit and wonder. We ain't close like we should and its taken us under. The only time we come together is to have a funeral. Sit around and talk about each other and spread rumors. Know it's some of my fault caus' I don't talk to 'em. For my family to be happy, that's all I want. Help my grandma fight, god I know she don't. To see my mama retire, that's all I want. Hope my brutha get out to see his kids for once.. . by Romero"
feel like fuckin,"[Whispering:]. I feel like fuckin',. I feel like fuckin',. I feel like fuckin'. [Chorus:]. I'm just in one of them moods, I feel like fuckin'. Wanna lay up in somethin' wet, and punish somethin'. I want a nice lil' baby who ain't got on nothin'. I got a taste for some pussy, I feel like fuckin' [x2]. Ate pussy in the shower for the first time last week. I got a confession to make to the world, I'm a freak. I think about wet pussy, all in my sleep. My fantasy is to get caught, fuckin' on the beach. The best pussy you can get is when you gotta sneak. I call my lil' baby a shooter; when she nut, she skeet. If I had my choice of how I'm a die, I'd be in some pussy, beatin'. Bammin' pussy, then leave and cause a nigga cheatin'. My baby sore, cause I done fucked her twice, this evenin'. Said I fuck her so good, it feel like she dreamin'. Got her playin' with herself for no apparent reason. Need some more of that pussy, cause a nigga feenin'. [Chorus]. All this liquor keep me horny than a motherfucker. Just text bay and ask her could I come fuck her. Only yak here, but shit, her ass in trouble. Goin' to beat bay, so that mean no rubber. That's my motherfuckin' best, nigga, that's how I cut her. We been fuckin for a while, that's how we fuck each other. Love diggin' in lil' mama, cause it get gutta. Seem like that pussy go to runnin', soon as you touch her. When I get in that pussy, I'm tryin' to pull a muscle. Ready to come up out these boxers, so I can gon' and fuck her. I can blame it on the liquor, if I wanna suck her. Know I'm ready to fuck bad than a motherfucker. [Chorus]. Can be four in the mornin' or two in the afternoon. Just thinking 'bout that pussy get me in my mood. Knowin' that pussy on it's way, get me in my groove. Nothin' like a bad bitch, who body smooth. Lay her flat on the bed, and look at her in the nude. Then fuck on every inch of the whole room. Money first, then pussy, then food. Around fat pussy, it's hard to keep my cool. Gotta turn my head, so I don't fuckin' drool. I can tell when I want it; feel my boxers move. Yet they pussy get wet, when they want it too. Good pussy the worst thing you can ever lose. [Chorus]. [Whispering:]. I feel like fuckin',. I feel like fuckin',. I feel like fuckin',. I feel like fuckin'"

Indictment money in my pocket and 'Gnac in my system. Need every muhfuckin' day to feel like Christmas. Heard the crackers downtown givin' out big nimbles.

Should be happy 'cause ain't too many of us beat 'em in awhile. Just be careful in these streets 'cause this shit done got wild. A lot of niggas fucked up, so they playin' it foul.

kept it too real,I broke bread wit u nigga showed u where i lived. U talkin nigga but u dont understand wat real is. When it came to yo pussy ass nigga i woulda killed. But it was my fault nigga i kept it too real. We busted choppaz at niggaz layed in bushes together. U had me fooled dawg i thought u was my fukkin nigga. Woulda did a 100 years for u cuz i fuk wit ya. U taught me wat a good heart in these streetz would get a nigga. Not a muthafukkin thing but a sad picture. Hurt me when i found out u had pussy in yo heart nigga. I never thought id say it but muthafuk a friend. Cuz yo dawg be tha one that cross ya in tha end. Tha shit i kno now wish id done knew it bak then. But goin thru it wit a fuk nigga is wat make a man. I treated yo pussy ass betta than i did my own kin. When a nigga locked up or broke thats when they claim they luv u then. I broke bread wit u nigga showed u where i lived. U talkin nigga but u dont understand wat real is. When it came to yo pussy ass nigga i woulda killed. But it was my fault nigga i kept it too real. Wat was mine was yours but wat yours wasnt mine. If a nigga woulda told me u was soft i woulda thought he was lyin. But every nigga gon show his hand in due time. I kept it so muthafukkin real wit u that i was blind. Cuz i was too busy showin luv i aint see tha signs. When u needed me pussy i came thru everytime. Whether u was right or wrong fuk nigga i was ridin. But u envied me nigga in tha bak of yo mind. U wasnt a 100 nigga u was real part time. I broke u off when them fuk niggaz wouldnt give u a dime. Aint owe u shit nigga i just wanted to see u shine. U never gave me shit nigga i had my own grind. I aint need yo choppaz i had my own nine. Im a 100 nigga i done did me and yo time. U cant trust yo own homiez who tha fuk can u trust. I got my broad and my choppa so to me thats enough. I broke bread wit u nigga showed u where i lived. U talkin nigga but u dont understand wat real is. When it came to yo pussy ass nigga i woulda killed. But it was my fault nigga i kept it too real. God aint makin u fuk niggaz like he used to. A nigga believe its hope now before he believe u. And cuz u thug wit a nigga dont mean tha luv tru. It used to matter wat u and yo niggaz done been thru. Nigga be yo dawg one day and turn pussy out tha blue. A fuk nigga gon do wat a fuk nigga gon do. Betta off runnin by yoself if u only knew. Dont mean that nigga a hunter cuz he'll fukkin shoot. And money dont mean u real cuz he got loot. If a nigga heart aint right no tellin wat he'll do. And real niggaz extinct its only a fukkin few. Cuz 99% of these fuk niggaz aint tru. I broke bread wit u nigga showed u where i lived. U talkin nigga but u dont understand wat real is. When it came to yo pussy ass nigga i woulda killed. But it was my fault nigga i kept it too real

Just bought another house, the last one was boring. Ten-thousand square-feet, it feel like you tourin'. These niggas dissin' me, it really ain't important. Take off yo shirt, nigga, I bet yo ribs showin'. You nigga starvin', my money over-flowin'. Jewelry game sick, got all these hos adorin'. Catch me in the club wit' all the 'gnac pourin'. If I ever go to prison, I'ma have plenty stories. Sleep real good, 'cause I ain't got no worries. Stay fresh everyday, jewelry stay glowin'. I got plenty money and all you niggas knowin'. What's in my pocket, dawg, big face hundreds. Just left the mall, bought everything that I wanted. I kinda mad wit' you haters, I'm real disappointed. 'Cause what you didn't tell the people, that I got plenty money. (Okay) I got plenty money, I got plenty money. Next month, guess what, I'm buyin' rappers. 'Cause I'm startin' to feel sorry for you lil' bastards. I'm pretty hot, yo career a disaster. I control you niggas, somethin' like yo master. Sixty-five grand, that's 'round ??. Stay from 'round me if you don't like to smell cheddar. I ain't fuckin' wit that ho 'cause she a dick hacker. Wanna know who I'm fuckin', my money, I just married her. She been good to me, I might 5-karat her. Ran me out the store, I bought too many plasmas. Count so much money, breathe like I got asthma. The old sayin' is, ""The more money, the marrier"". What's in my pocket, dawg, big face hundreds. Just left the mall, bought everything that I wanted. I kinda mad wit' you haters, I'm real disappointed. 'Cause what you didn't tell the people, that I got plenty money. (Okay) I got plenty money, I got plenty money. Ion't know why I bought the Bentley when I had the Mazerati. And what I paid for the ""Goon"" chain, one-fourty. Scared to keep money on me 'cause I will blow it. My strip club name is ""Mr. Will-Throw-It"". Keep fire on deck and I will show it. Fuck wit' me and get wacked and all you niggas know it. Scared to dance in the club 'cause my fire loaded. If you won't use it, guess what, then don't tote it. Mo' money, to most niggas, mean mo' hos. Mo' money, to me, it mean keep goin'. Haters gettin' tired, my money still growin'. Ball all night, catch a flight in the mornin. by Romero"

runnin' my momma crazy,"Hey mama (hey mama)... Know I ain't never tell you this. befo' (I ain't never tell you this befo')... but it really. hurt me knowin' I'm runnin' you crazy (know I'm runnin'. ya crazy)... I wanna talk to ya real quick (wanna talk to ya mama). My momma told me while I run these streets she can't sleep. Her phone ring late at night she think somethin' happened to me. Her nerves so bad right now she can't even watch T.V. She turn her head everytime she see the police. She scared to look 'cause it might be me in the back seat. Whenever she hear about a shootin' her heart skip a beat. She heard the feds was in town her knees got weak. She know I'm at the house the only time she at peace. Her blood pressure through the roof all because of me. Her favorite words is ""dope ain't the only way to eat"". She told me the other day she hope I don't die in these streets. I just pray to God she don't wipe her hands wit' me. I'm a goon to the streets but to my momma I'm still her baby. Raised a street nigga by yaself you a hell of a lady. Shit Im doin' now got nothin' to do wit' how you raised me. Shit killin' me to know I'm runnin' my momma crazy. Goon to the streets but to my momma I'm still her baby. Raised a street nigga by yaself you a hell of a lady. Shit Im doin' now got nothin' to do wit' how you raised me. Shit killin' me to know I'm runnin' my momma crazy. Remember the nights me sittin' up in a cold cell. I'm wakin' ya up out'cha sleep it's me callin' you from jail. You ain't say it but I know inside you mad as hell. You called off from work just to bond me out of jail. I get in trouble I call you seem like it never fail. Can hear you now ""boy you need to sit ya ass down somewhere"". I come and eat I take a shower then I'm out of there. I know I'm stressin' ya at times seem like I don't care. You wrote bad checks for me to have somethin' to wear. You risked ya freedom for me nowadays that's real rare. Everytime I think about the shit I wanna shed a tear. That's why I buy ya somethin' for Father's Day every year. You did the best you could wit' me and I love you for that. Wanted me to stay in school but that ain't where my heart was at. I got exposed to the streets and fell in love wit' stacks. And all the times I hurt you wish I could take it back. When daddy left us you stepped up and took his slack. I know I'm selfish and feelin's is somethin' I know I lack. The shit I'm doin' now I know you raised me better than that. You showed me how to be a man and showed me how to act. Sometimes I wonder how you still proud I'm ya son. After all the stuff I took ya through and all the shit I done. Well like ya told me when God want me how I can't run. Before he take me want you to know how much I love ya mom. Think I'm speakin' for every street nigga 'round the world... I. don't think we sit down long enough sometimes... Just to. realize what we takin' our momma through... It hurt me to know. dog... That I'm runnin' my momma crazy... And it's really. killin' me to know... that I'm helpin' killin' my momma.."

worth goin' fed fo,(Chorus 2X). I got a name in these streets. Plenty money to blow. Got whips 28’s and jewelry to show. And aint a ho I can’t fuck I got ho’s to loan. Just don’t know if this shit worth goin fed fo. (Verse 1). As soon as a nigga get knocked the streets call him dumb. When this shit hit the fan everybody run. I don’t know a nigga yet who did this shit and won. Money mean nothing to ya if you aint got a bond. The streets scared now cuz everybody getting hung. Lawyers sittin back sucking all a nigga fund. Said it aint cool when the rapper got the gun. This shit a game to these crackas and they having fun. The nigga you thought wouldn’t tell will be the first one. It’ll take number one fuck up and a nigga done. Visitation room that aint how I wanna see my son. But I don’t think about none of this shit when im stuntin. (Chorus 2X). I got a name in these streets. Plenty money to blow. Got whips 28’s and jewelry to show. And aint a ho I can’t fuck I got ho’s to loan. Just don’t know if this shit worth goin fed fo. (Verse 2). I don’t know if 25 years worth 2 years of ballin. That’s a big pill to take and I aint trynna swallow it. Fuck round and get jammed and all this shit falling. Take the streets from a nigga then a nigga starving. Tried to let it go the money kept calling. Streets been good to me got a nigga flossing. [ Worth Goin Fed Fo lyrics found on http://www.completealbumlyrics.com ]. Same shit a nigga love be the shit that cost him. Money make niggas hate turn niggas salty. Go to prison now don’t take me from my shawty. Bout time I get out he gon be off in college. Game fucked up now cuz all these niggas talking. I’m a street nigga I aint got too many options. (Chorus 2X). I got a name in these streets. Plenty money to blow. Got whips 28’s and jewelry to show. And aint a ho I can’t fuck I got ho’s to loan. Just don’t know if this shit worth goin fed fo. (Verse 3). Nigga always told me to get in this shit and get out. But he aint tell me bout all the laws and all the drama. You back to square one after a nigga break into your house. It’s hard to come up shit when you gotta keep burnin out. Is cars jewelry and ho’s what it’s all about. I don’t know it lil daddy I just want a nice amount. Just gave my lil cousin eleven years for an ounce. You broke and fuckin wit these ho’s they gon ask you to bounce. And niggas buying shit now they can’t even pronounce. Done fucked up so much money shit can’t even count. Hope I don’t wake up one morning wit them crackas in my house. With guns drawn on me and with enditment papers out. (Chorus 2X). I got a name in these streets. Plenty money to blow. Got whips 28’s and jewelry to show. And aint a ho I can’t fuck I got ho’s to loan. Just don’t know if this shit worth goin fed fo

(Thinking about you). Cumming on me! (Cumming on me baby). Me cumming on you! (Me cumming on you shorty babe). [Verse 1: Plies]. Hoe, dont be cute, tonight I want to get nasty. Let me drop this mayonnaise, baby, in your salad. Slide your hand in my pants if you want to grab it. Bet as soon as you touch it, you call me ""big"" daddy. Want to lick all over you before I let you have it. Hold your legs open for me so I can really pack it. I'm already rock hard, you ain't got to jack me. Bet the tip of this tounge make you really like it. Picture us on the floor with no clothes on. You eating me, I'm eating you, shit we both raw. Let you ride me tonight off your favorite song. Tonight a special night, baby a freak is born. [Chorus: Tank]. You! (You). Thinking about me! (Thinking about me). Sucking on you! (Sucking on you). You sucking on me! (Can you do it for me babe?). Me! (Me). Thinking about you! (Thinking about you). Cumming on me! (Cumming on me baby). Me cumming on you! (Me cumming on you shorty babe). [Verse 2: Plies]. Let me cut a hole right in the middle of your panties. Put a peep-hole right on top your candy. I'ma have you moaning when you grab me. I'm a goon lil' momma but I like it fancy. See, sucking all on you is what gets you all ancy. Seeing how a goon moves, makes you want to chase me. After I rip you tonight you might want to ban me. Your friend wanted me to, thats why she can't stand me. It's your friend in your jeans that got my attention. A real nigga in your life is all you missing. Ain't nobody like me baby, I'm my competition. Baby when you walk out the door in the morning you leave with me. [Chorus: Tank]. You! {You). Thinking about me! (Thinking about me). Sucking on you! (Sucking on you). You sucking on me! (Can you do it for me babe?). Me! (Me). Thinking about you! (Thinking about you). Cumming on me! (Cumming on me baby). Me cumming on you! (Me cumming on you shorty babe). [Verse 3: Plies]. If you want to we could just tease eachother. Get drunk. Get naked and lay under cover. Let me peek at her first before I go any further. Stick my finger in yo mouth before I even touch her. Ain't got to put it in, we could just hunch eachother. See if I could make you nut without even fucking you. Feel me pushing up against you, then go on and rub you. Now you mad you want to fuck, I could tell how you cussing. Just a couple minutes ago, you wasn't fucking nothing. Now you pressing up against me because that pussy gushing. Got you swerving all over, now got you touching. Made a crunk cut, now we sucking and fucking. [Chorus: Tank]. You! {You). Thinking about me! (Thinking about me). Sucking on you! (Sucking on you). You sucking on me! (Can you do it for me babe?). Me! (Me). Thinking about you! (Thinking about you). Cumming on me!
