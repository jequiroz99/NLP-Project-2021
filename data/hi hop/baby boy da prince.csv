the way i live,"This is the way I live. Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels. I stack my money, lay low, and chill. Don't need to work hard that's the way I feel, I feel, I. This is the way I live. Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels. I stack my money, lay low, and chill. Don't need to work hard that's the way I feel, I feel, I. This is the way I live. Six months later now we're big dog status. Name elevated but I still act average. Rockin' shows in Dallas, ball like I play for the Mavericks. West Bank rapper and I'm one of the baddest. French Rivera spot and I am getting in shape man. I think I'm Super M-a-n without a cape man. Ridin' all day hustlin', all for the cake man. I'm a Benjamin stack one inch taller than Great Danes. First they made cheap Ray-Ban like a felon. I'm growin' up now spittin' hotter than Mohellans. I'm a steal every girl ever gon' to fly. I'm a young little dude, stay runnin' from cops. Emerald Row is the place where I got my props. People love me in the hood they don't want me to stop. So uhh, that's the only way I know how to rock. And I'm a stay rappers like won't stop ‘til I drop. This is the way I live. Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels. I stack my money, lay low, and chill. Don't need to work hard that's the way I feel, I feel, I. This is the way I live. Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels. I stack my money, lay low, and chill. Don't need to work hard that's the way I feel, I feel, I. This is the way I live. I I's Baby Boy and I done it again. I'm ridin' fly with D-Wizzle in ‘cedes Benz. Twenty two wanna ride with the ladies then. Red Bull, Grey Goose, now the ladies bent. Now we go and do a thing under a shady tent. And they don't question what I say ‘cause I'm a ladies pimp. See this little one right here this fellow got stripes. And I is represent, my rail room for life. Money in my pocket but I still act trife. While I in the club they say the parlor ain't right. Look I'm--doing great that's the way I feel. Hustlin' hard all day that's the way I live. This is the way I live. Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels. I stack my money, lay low, and chill. Don't need to work hard that's the way I feel, I feel, I. This is the way I live. Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels. I stack my money, lay low, and chill. Don't need to work hard that's the way I feel, I feel, I. This is the way I live. This the two-seat rider with the ketchup inside. Red pepper paint must believe my ish ride. They pause like stop signs when they rollin' up. Cause' when the doors open up, they open UP. I'm Lamboin' it I was stashed, off stage I'm throwin' it. Cause they say I'm like Katrina with money, I blow the shhhh. Real been gravy, three years out of the eighties. Solos, shabo's valley animals played it. Commodores mirages, not the Nike hirages. It cost two hundred and fifty on up to put your foot inside this. Y'all was wearing rocks that was my time to shine. Don't give me viesels y'all thinkin' this McDonalds size. I been fly I I I I I I I I from the crib to the ri I I I I I de. Fifty-Four inch screens twenty-six inches from the ceiling dude. The plasma look like a projector up in the livin' room homie!. This is the way I live. Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels. I stack my money, lay low, and chill. Don't need to work hard that's the way I feel, I feel, I. This is the way I live. Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels. I stack my money, lay low, and chill. Don't need to work hard that's the way I feel, I feel, I. This is the way I live"
