Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces. Betrayal is worse than death in most cases. The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist. Multiple shots to the face, No chasers. Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited. Your man that you grew up with get you indicted. This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go. Found out at the trial they got audio and video. Shit don't always happen how you plan it. Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is. You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas. That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas. You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure. You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more. He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war. Even had a crack spot together, the first floor. Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door. That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour. Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces. He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers. Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains. Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting. Nothing but old pictures of old sixes. Old BM's with the kids, old snitches. Two sides, both wishes. Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches. [Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]. See there's a story in my life. There's a story in my pain. There's a story in my tears, ohh-ohh ohh. There's a story in me. [Verse 3: Meek Mill]. Yeah, for life. Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends. And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends. Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance. Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me. take the stand, damn. Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told. I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile. Knew him since a child, man this game so foul. But niggas made vows to a code I never break. Ridin' in the heavy weight. Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight. Never on time, when I show up I be ready late. Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate. And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full. If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull. We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store. On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for. Hah!. [Bridge: Akon]. My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told). All the success that I'm suffering from. Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I know). My family fucks with me. And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way). That's why I don't trust nobody. And I doubt you'll ever see that day. 'Fore I surrender to you (surrender) , surrender to you. (surrender). Surrender to you, surrender to you. Which I will never do. [Bridge: John Legend & Anthony Hamilton]. Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around. (nobody's around). Cold world (cold world) , cold world (mm, yes it is, yeah). And the ones that you keep close. are the ones will take you down (always take you down). Cold world (coold) , a cold cold world. [Hook: Akon]. 'Fore I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you. (surrender). Surrender to you, surrender to you. 'Fore I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you. (surrender). Surrender to you, surrender to you. Which I will never do. Ohh-ohhohhwhooa. Ohh-ohh (ohh-ohh) ohh-ohh. [Bridge: Anthony Hamilton & John Legend]. See there's a story in my life (Surrender). There's a story in my pain (Surrender). There's a story in my tears (Surrender). There's a story in me. (I won't Surrender, I won't surrender, ohh no no no)"

It's a blooming blessing, hey. Let it flow, it's a pleasure. [Verse 2: Sizzla]. Hours upon hours searching for a better way out. And the evil and ignorant people sending the choppers. Still just gotta look out. Jah is my guide, I know I'm here for a reason. Put my trust in the Most High. And my prayers are so consistent, ah. Who would've thought it would be like this today?. Nothing but prayers lift up your head. Lion in the jungle, I tell ya. He who have been blessed. [Interlude: DJ Khaled & Sizzla]. Welcome to Grateful. Strength is strength, strength is strength.

Don't like me, fuck you again,. wanna fight me well come do it then. Right hand to God on everything. I see the hearts of men and they very lame.

"holy key (feat. kendrick lamar, big sean and betty wright)","[Intro: Big Sean DJ Khaled]. This is, this is. Doing what I gotta do. What up though?. We the best music. I guess I'm on my Don shit. What that mean?. I'mma go. DJ Khaled. [Verse 1: Big Sean]. Straight up, late nights mixed with early days. It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates. Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break. These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man. Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it. Realize the energy you give is what you manifested. So understand we positive as could be. The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats. Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach. Khaled on the jet skiis, preaching what you believe in. Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating. If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan. Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers. You know it's true, bitch I need respect due. Now or later, either way I'mma take it. Just like it's fuckin' taxes. No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch. Lately I been living life in detachment. I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions. We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting. Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion. Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies. Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body. Niggas over stressing, we under investigation. Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist. Beat your ass until you purple. They can't even tell what your race is. Doctor King meet Dr. Dre. Except this doctor lost all his patience. Have you tied up in a basement. With you and your partner facing adjacent. Until you deposit payment or reparations. If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me. It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key (the holy key, the holy key, the holy key...). [Hook: Betty Wright DJ Khaled]. And I'ma celebrate it for a long time. The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine. Surrounded by my angels and we all shine. Holy, holy, holy, holy key. And I'ma celebrate it for a long time. The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine. Surrounded by my angels and we all shine. Holy, holy, holy, holy key. [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]. Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh). Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on). Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings. Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was. I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back. I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that. I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate. Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake. The universe and the heavens work in my DNA. Kendrick said ""Fuck Mother Earth, "" that's PSA. The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit. Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness. Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again. The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in. The big money, the fast cars, my life produced. The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube. So what you look up to?. Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches. Sources with designer thing. Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me. Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed. Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed. Who knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need. Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee. Flesh and poison the point is the reason. You won't die in peace. Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally. I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me. Tape recording my voices and tweak it. Let's play hide and seek. War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least. I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast. I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD. Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need. Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration. But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix. [Hook: Betty Wright DJ Khaled]. And I'ma celebrate it for a long time. The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine. Surrounded by my angels and we all shine. Holy, holy, holy, holy key. And I'ma celebrate it for a long time. The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine. Surrounded by my angels and we all shine. Holy, holy, holy, holy key. [Outro: Betty Wright]. Holy, Holy key, holy"

before the solution,[Beanie Sigel]. All the bullshit stops here let's get this clear. Shoot rear fresh off the top tier. What I'm about to do for you is not fair. I'm not answering questions for you that are not clear. What up to State Prop the crew were they not there. The moment that they heard it the verdict when it was declared. Ya boy had to sit a year. Did they really disappear did Jay really not visit there. Dame and Bean's are they tight as it seems. Or is it all fabricated from that same fabric. That ripped the Roc marriage straight from the scenes. Things ain't what it seems. But in time do tell the truth shall prevail. Until then you dudes bite y'all nails in anticipation. Before I know you hate it why I got you waiting I too am waiting. Gotta see a couple faces when I make them face it. Truth that is that your boy ain't have patience. As a matter of fact it's wearing thin. But I tell you this though when the new year begins. Pussy's ain't got nuts because I'm going all in. . [Chorus]. We are listening. Plead for attention. But it ain't good if you don't wait. It ain't good if you don't wait. I'm the plot in every movie and my theory stays the same. It ain't good if you don't wait. It ain't good if you don't wait. . [Beanie Sigel]. Now let's not get this misconstrued. To say that in this record I don't diss my dudes. Out of respect I couldn't check my once fist tight crew. Never in front of you I couldn't get that rude. And I don't give a fuck but I couldn't get that cruel. It's knowing what I do I could get like oh. You wanna know what I do don't ya. Ya love it if I told you old fuckers won't ya. Uh uh scrap got to pay for this one. I'm sorry younging got to wait on this one. The Solution soon in stores. Date to be posted until then I'm on pause. . [Beanie Sigel]. Well fuck it I don't wanna stop. But you forgot the gunner pop tell me who you wanna rock. It's crew love Rocafella 'til I die. Nigga keep it moving don't get caught up in this drive-by. The breaks over your boy about to take over. If that number one spot open give it here. Give my ground dust off my chair. And y'all nigga's can kiss my ass before I sit it there. Back from the dead fresh off the prison tier. Daddy here to put the kids to bed. By the way the war's on you can't call it off. It's too late plus the boss involved. . [Chorus]

"don't ever play yourself (feat. fat joe, busta rhymes, kent jones, fabolous & jadakiss)","[Intro: DJ Khaled]. DJ Khaled!. [Verse 1: Jadakiss]. Pat them down count the money, let 'em see the work, yeah. That's the definition of a major key alert. Another nigga gotta die, won't be the first, nah. Won't be the last, all we see is cash, yeah. Your real story don't match what you rappin' 'bout (liar). So keep the movies in, stop actin' out. And I ain't talking 'bout no watch or no cars neither. Everything will get copped at Allah's leisure. Was a crack monster, I had the hard fever. Switch from the bald head to the dark Caesar. Used to be the capsules, now they love the plastics. I ain't tryna get caught up in this thug-rap shit (never). Rather be bumper to bumper in drug traffic. Cash on deck whenever the plug ask it. You don't sweat the small things, they become drastic. Next thing is cremation or a casket. Fuck fallin' back, I need all of that. I need my name in the cocaine almanac, Jada. Real dope boy put me in the hall of smack. Went to job interviews, they ain't call us back. Either way I ain't never evil. Why do you think the streets love me? I ain't never leave 'em. Heart stops, but the words are forever breathing. You hatin' cause we the best, find a better reason. [Verse 2: Fabolous]. First thing first don't ever play yourself, ever. Oh another thing, I ain't ever play myself, never. Even when they all changed up, I stayed myself, it's me. Did what worked for me, then bossed up and paid myself. See I'm showin' up a K off, gain a Rollie, a day off. Still got that work, I don't know about no layoffs. Team still ballin' so I guess we in the playoffs (swish). Team full of baddies, all my bitches in a slayoff. See we be in the party wasted, no part of fake shit. Nothin' but love 'round me, Cartier bracelets. I feel like Frank White walkin' into Arty Clay shit. You niggas got fat while everybody starved. My city don't sleep, I ain't ever noddin' off. When you're in the Benz, it piss everybody off. So I ain't stall, I do me, I ain't y'all. This New York nigga let 'em hang, giant balls. Odell Beckham, respect him, you can't check him. Blindside hoes hit me when I don't expect 'em (hey bighead). Then I hit 'em with the curve from the major league. Gotta wait your turn, that's a major key. [Verse 3: Fat Joe]. Mami yellin' I'm the greatest. Back to back with the slow cum. In the lane, I got her so strung, I don't even know her. Every night I meet a new wife. Now ask your wife what this dick like. Balmain Joe, every time you see, a nigga flee. Mr. Officer, I was only grabbin' ID. Mami only listen to Romeo. Wild cowboy, I be speakin' through the yayo. Bout to let the cans go, woah. Fuck your bitch and let your mans know, so. Yeah, now it's the Don in the Don, couple laughs in the Uber. Only drivin' Uber cause I'm franchised in Cuba. This is big money talk and you tied to the sideline. Brian Scalabrine, niggas always tryna high five. Gotta stay away from day driftin', all sauce. Every day Vera Wang, nigga, cloth talk. [Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]. Now I'm takin' over everything like that's my callin'. Wakin' up in pussy like beautiful Sunday mornin'. Now we swimmin' in the money like a line of dolphins. Prepare for killin', now please line up all of the coffins. Think we playin'? Niggas think it's funny?. Pop you in your shit, brotha. Now make room for the money, MOVE!. If you don't move, I'll beat a nigga past painful. Make a fool of yourself, I'll beat you past shameful. I get this bread and shine like an angel. One of the last with bars, you niggas better be grateful. Thank you so much. I Diddy bop and drop on you niggas. I count bread and take it to the top on you niggas. (Mountaintop). Blah blah blah blah, you sound alike, my niggas. Blah, blah, but when I do it, I finesse, I got it locked, my niggas. I give you new brand shit, fuck you gon' do?. And know we love the boom bap, oh yeah we do this too. Yeah, fuck with the realer side, oh you against us, nigga?. You better run and hide, until I'm finished, nigga. Don't play yourself. Play yourself and lay yourself dead in a casket. Pray yourself, end in a basket. Hate yourself. Cause you ain't ask if you could possess you a heater. Or you could be you a leader for the people. You talk a lot, I've seen the truth like Sevyn Streeter. Don't you ever play yourself. [Verse 5: Kent Jones]. I saw a lot of niggas fade out right after I put my tape out. I offered to help you shape up. I see that you'd rather flake out. Sellin' stories on them tracks. That nobody can seem to make out. That's why I keep a good head and shoulders. To keep all the flakes out. Seen a lot of singles chart on and off durin' the climb up. I bet if I had the clippers, they prolly all had a line up. You worried 'bout your followers, so hurt when I follow up. It's the ones with the most pride end up bein' the swallowers. Fuck a beat for a verse when I could do all three. No pop artist but pop is what you rappers do call me. A lot of washed out niggas tryna find hope in. I'm just tryna raise a son like my blinds' open. I know the hood well, but glad I ain't stuck in the streets. I'm pop chartin' but hood niggas got my song on repeat. I'm still loaded with illest ammo up under the seat. I'm playin' hopscotch with all the charts up under my feet. While you do it for the 'Gram, I do it for my Grammy. Fuck a gold trophy, I'm talkin' my mom's mammy. You gotta finish bigger than you start. Don't fall victim to bent stories, you ain't even part of it all. Start from the bottom or oh, please, don't start at all. I build a ship just to survive my own flood, I feel like Noah. Cause all he had was little rocks, an ark, that's all. Road to riches, I'm still in gear while you park your car. Your baby wanna get nailed in the sprinter Lexus. Text back and told her. ""Please be hammered so you can sex us"". My arm strong, if Louisiana then tell her Texas. And if it's not immediate then don't even send a message. FYI I'll be free 'round 2 or 3. And two things you gotta be, New Orleans. I'm an organ donor, I'm alive with no heart in me. So never say my name in vain. Cause bitch there's no arteries. Jones"

My driver's out of this world, you playing bumper cars.. You niggas under cause. You should be unemployed. All you smoke is Reggie, I'm in the tellie, bunch of noise. Who gone tell me that I ain't going, that I ain't flowing?. Young Folarin, you see them puters. That was my influence. [Verse 5 - Vado]. The towers fell. Turn into Ground Zero. Kissing like Reggie Jackson, Nicky Barnes, they hero. As I play Rothstein. Corleone like Rob De Niro. Been through it, but here though. Dope move in the weirdos. Dress pimping the toast like let's win. Your house is on West and 4th pipes and Lex win. While me in a Maserati bricking his best friends. When I die, tell them to turn my coffin to stretch Benz. Rims on it, problems? My man's on. See him, we stomp him out. His mouth, my Timbs' on it. Only smoking a ounce, a mountain, no tens on it. Spins on it, you have no cloud, the Benz on it. What the fiends say?. Few roses, you need spray, on tours, eat straight. Making sure all your feet sprayed. Get the pills through, peel through SRT-8. Trunk on, seats gray, drop tops like release dates. Vado. . by:ludias"

good man (feat. pusha t and jadakiss),"[Intro: Pusha T & DJ Khaled]. Yeah. We the Best Music!. DJ Khaled!. [Verse 1: Pusha T]. Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me. Unless the said party is a rare breed. The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me. At this point now, rap is only therapy. President Push, I'm more Eric B. I ain't no joke, check out my melody. Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me. But two million in large bills is billing me. I was on the wrong side of the law. Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car. Like B. I. G. at the Soul Train Awards. The moral is all greats been driven. G-Wagons are bulletproof. The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth. Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era. The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror. [Interlude: Pusha T]. Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha. Yeah, I know who the fuck I am. [Verse 2: Pusha T]. Yuugh, tell me how you fit in. Was you a street nigga when Nas said It's Written. When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?. I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen. Getting work from Detroit like a piston. We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin. I could spend a year reminiscing. The length of your career, reminiscing. We can't occupy the same space. We ain't even running the same race. When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase. Moynat versus Celine, we ain't the same taste. Therefore, it's no comparison. To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing. I am one Joe blow, you know my narrative. Clear your sinus like Claritin. Push. [Interlude: Jadakiss]. When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?. 'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see. You peasants don't deserve my presence. [Verse 3: Jadakiss]. You portraying other individuals. Me, I'm just weighing my residuals. From where success is the bare minimal. You a rapper, I'm a criminal. I had money before they found y'all. That's why I feel funny around y'all. Lord, bless those praying for my downfall. If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all. Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key. Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D. Had the whole YPD sick of me. Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee. Bet it all or bet it large. Now the coke or the pills or the crack, all these credit cards. I just laughed and I shrug at it. 'Cause the niggas with the money are the drug addicts. Kiss"
grammy family,"[Chorus: Kanye]. Oh it can't Be. G.O.O.D. music my Grammy family. Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry. Now I'm hoppin out the limo or either the Lam B.

Nas done told you come on homie we major. Really Doe told you hoes where we staying. G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playing. Dawg it can't be. G.O.O.D. music the Grammy family.

Ghea uh,uh it's the Cons fool.. word. Oh it can't Be. G.O.O.D. music my Grammy family. Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry. Now I'm hoppin out the limo or either the Lam B. And after music meetings wit evenings with Angie. It's gon' prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me. And we, be in Miami. So when they spot me in Bentley it's gon be a stampede. cuz we be racing Bentleys no different than Grand Prix's. fam please, don't make my man squeeze. And we can take it to the cars and I'll show you the hand speed. I started independent with owners from land speed. But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed. And sense I got my shot like I was call and man b. I hope they lose they spot guarantee a plan B. We'll be waiting in the telli like Jamie and Fancy. prolly paintin they nails in nuthin but they panties. And we'll be up town Jimmy and Camby. headin to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby. They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath. And I know my nigga Ye told you we was the best dressed. I know I got a buzz so plan up the next step. So what ya'll wanna do when it comes to that next check. And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is. So open up them envelopes you know who the winners is. Oh, Oh, Oh, The Grammy Family. [John Legend]. La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La. On Grammy night call it G.O.O.D. family night. Celebrate tonight. Oh it's alright, it's alright... yeah"
"hip hop (feat. nas, scarface & dj premier)","[Intro: DJ Khaled]. This shit's special. This shit's special. DJ Khaled!. [Verse 1: Scarface]. And if I cry two tears for her. That will be the most that I would give to her. She left me stranded in my nightmares. Taking pictures of my memories she right there. Twisting on the blade in my heart, deep. Always on my mind so I can't sleep. She used to tell me she was all mine. Now the only way I see the broad is online. I'm doing drugs trying to feel you. I'm killing me trying to kill you. I built my whole life around you. I thought I found it all when I found her. Shopping sprees on whatever coast. How'd you really feel, I may never know. And as I ride through these streets. With my hand on my heat, eyes red from the sweets, I... Realise, some things never change. Once in love and it's gone you don't look at it the same man. Fuck love, cause she don't live here. I'm soaked in blood but I'm still here. Hip Hop heartbreaks, straight-laced, deep bass,. 808s plus the mixtapes. Got a nigga feeling like I up and left ya. Get away now you all in the lectures. Being studied by the college's professors. Now I regret the day I met ya. I'll be the first one to say it. She ain't the one you want to play with. I fucked Hip Hop. [Verse 2: Nas]. And if I cry two tears for her. That would be the most that I can give to her. I am Joseph, Darryl, Jason, Dr Dre, O'Shea. And a host of those who passed away. Today I'm Drake, I'm Wayne, 2 Chainz. You say you wanna rap, to this bitch you must commit. Then you're a slave to your grave,. you won't get out, you cannot quit. She menstruates weekly, her Vibe covers keep you warm. But the Source to her heart is love, word up, right on. You know how girls are, she love when you licking on her. World Star. Kissing on her belly, trick on her and onyx. Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic. But she's the object of my affections,. God's essence, God bless her. She bought me Bentleys, Breitlings, made some friends resent me. For writing about my life, they thought I should have stayed quiet. She took me to places I would have never saw without her. And she took me from my girl powder. I doubt I'll ever be the same, hallowed be thy name. Give me strength so I don't do this dame like Orenthal James. Brad warned me while driving this auburn Ferrari. Never follow in her games, I fuck around and I'll be sorry. But I tried her, used to ride her, for dollars not the fame. She slowed me down and had me guzzling on cups of lean. She's a middle-aged cougar, showing young'uns the dream. Notice she wasn't breathing for a second then I screamed. ?She's dead!?, and everybody took it out on Nasty. I was just looking out for my music family. Wasn't trying to claim her to myself, she's yours. You can have her she's a muthafucking whore. I fuck Hip Hop. And if I cry two tears for her. That will be the most that I would give to her"
hit 'em up,"[Chorus] (Paul Wall). I'm comin down, I'm actin bad. I'm chunkin dueces and I'm choppin up the slab. I'm comin through, I'm tippin dime. I'm sho a naked and I'm straight actin a clown (x2). (Bun B). I'm a certified D-boy, a real big nutta. A candy car strutta that be sittin' on butta. Comin' straight up out the gutta with the cordaless cutta. Man, what is that? The Chinese choppa that likens Mr. Studda. What a f*cked up predicament (Damn), a scary scenario. Automatics in ya face have you preparin' ya burial. They tracin' tha weapon after you scratch off the serial. Leaves you up like cereal, there it is and there we go. Some bad Didos ridin' off in tha wind and. Ni**a we got all ya soft in ya hands so don't pretend. Like this ain't what it was (was) or we ain't what you say (say). I'll make a high cappa or court fraud light in tha day. Cuz in the middle of the street in height of tha traffic. Watch what you say when we meet cuz they know might get yo ass kicked. End up in a pickle like a Vlasic, UGK ni**a. We cost like a foreign but get respect like a classic muthaf*. [[Chorus]. (Paul Wall). This Paul Wall, baby, Swishahouse spokesperson. Choppin up tha slab, spokes turnin, bobbies searchin. Shoppers splergin, Caked up cuz my pockets swoll. I'm callin plays, pullin broads, I just think and roll. I'm from that lone star, tippin dime dat candy car. Get it shined on 59, Lean and tuck I'll cut some more. Hoes wanna who we are, Fathers wanna know what we get. Hatas wanna talk down a knot, but they just mad cuz they ain't hot. They ain't got the cash that I got,. They don't know what my hood 'bout. They don't know about trunks that pop on Lambo's that blaze tha chop. Countin cash and stackin not, South victory back to Scott. Crawlin like big crocodile, I'm diamond smile and Johnny watch. I'm with my partner, box, you and you and not wit 'cho. Rick boy, yeah that's fo' sho', breakin em off, you already know. Drive slow like Kanye West, and Branyan Wayans, and Manny Mesh. A swishahouse chain on my chest, I keep it fresh, We are the best. [Chorus]"

"holy key (feat. kendrick lamar, big sean and betty wright)","[Intro: Big Sean DJ Khaled]. This is, this is. Doing what I gotta do. What up though?. We the best music. I guess I'm on my Don shit. What that mean?. I'mma go. DJ Khaled. [Verse 1: Big Sean]. Straight up, late nights mixed with early days. It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates. Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break. These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man. Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it. Realize the energy you give is what you manifested. So understand we positive as could be. The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats. Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach. Khaled on the jet skiis, preaching what you believe in. Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating. If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan. Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers. You know it's true, bitch I need respect due. Now or later, either way I'mma take it. Just like it's fuckin' taxes. No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch. Lately I been living life in detachment. I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions. We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting. Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion. Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies. Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body. Niggas over stressing, we under investigation. Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist. Beat your ass until you purple. They can't even tell what your race is. Doctor King meet Dr. Dre. Except this doctor lost all his patience. Have you tied up in a basement. With you and your partner facing adjacent. Until you deposit payment or reparations. If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me. It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key (the holy key, the holy key, the holy key...). [Hook: Betty Wright DJ Khaled]. And I'ma celebrate it for a long time. The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine. Surrounded by my angels and we all shine. Holy, holy, holy, holy key. And I'ma celebrate it for a long time. The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine. Surrounded by my angels and we all shine. Holy, holy, holy, holy key. [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]. Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh). Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on). Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings. Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was. I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back. I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that. I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate. Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake. The universe and the heavens work in my DNA. Kendrick said ""Fuck Mother Earth, "" that's PSA. The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit. Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness. Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again. The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in. The big money, the fast cars, my life produced. The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube. So what you look up to?. Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches. Sources with designer thing. Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me. Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed. Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed. Who knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need. Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee. Flesh and poison the point is the reason. You won't die in peace. Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally. I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me. Tape recording my voices and tweak it. Let's play hide and seek. War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least. I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast. I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD. Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need. Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration. But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix. [Hook: Betty Wright DJ Khaled]. And I'ma celebrate it for a long time. The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine. Surrounded by my angels and we all shine. Holy, holy, holy, holy key. And I'ma celebrate it for a long time. The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine. Surrounded by my angels and we all shine. Holy, holy, holy, holy key. [Outro: Betty Wright]. Holy, Holy key, holy"

I ain't work this hard since I was 18. Apologise if I say. Anything I don't mean. Like what's up with your best friend?. We could all have some fun, believe me. And what's up with these new niggas?. And why they think it all comes so easy. But get it while you here boy. Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy. Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot. With a little more cash than I already got. Trippin off you cause you had your shot. With my skin tanned and my hair long. And my fans who been so patient. Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation. Hate the rumours, hate your bullshit. Hate these fucking allegations. I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking. Watch me take it!. All I care about is money and the city that I'm from. I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done. And I don't really give a f-ck, and my excuse is that I'm young. And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya. I'm on one, yeah. F-ck it, I'm on one yeah. I said I'm on one. F-ck it, I'm on one. Two white cups and I got that drink. Could be purple, it could be pink. Depending on how you mix that shit. Money that we got, never get that shit. Cause I'm on one. I said fuck it I'm on one. I'm burning purple flowers. It's burning my chest. I bury the most cash and burning the rest. Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air. Do ones beneath me recognise the red bottoms I wear. Burner in the belt. Move the kids to the hills (Boss). Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill. Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great. Even though I out on bond I might be facin' 8's. Still running with the same niggas til the death of me. Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully. Ever made love to the woman of your dreams. In a room full of money out in London and she screams. Baby, I could take it there. Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair. So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair. (Khaled). And it's double M G until I get the chair. All I care about is money and the city that I'm from. I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done.

I said fuck it I'm on one. I walk around the club, f-ck everybody. And all my niggas got that Heat I feel like Pat Riley. Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money. You know the feds listening, nigga what money?. I'm a made nigga. I should dust something. You niggas on the bench. Like the bus coming. Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the swishas. I'm focused might aswell say cheese for the pictures. Ohhh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant. You a sell out, but I ain't buying. Chopper dissect a nigga like science. Put an end to the world like the Mayans. This a celebration bitches, Mazel Tov. It's a slim chance I fall, olive oil. Tunechi be the name, don't ask me how I got it. I'm killin' these hoes I swear I'm tryna stop the violence. All I care about is money and the city that I'm from. I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done.

And if the other nigga ain’t really hood. You can easily die. tell who that fake nigga was (Hood). And even though I spit a little rap. Got Niggas in the hood trying to sell the most crack.

I wear it to cherish the kings from which we inherit. My chariot is McLaren. It's all numeric. Talkin' numbers, you incoherent. Don't be embarrassed, I blame your parents for even caring. Or not aborting, ah fuck it, it's not important. My vital organs can't even tell if it's night or morning. Final warning, final warning, final warning. Every morning you'll awake and await mourning. We earn it then we burn it to ash. I call it urn money. My dog caught 40 before he turned 20. Money is earned, the rest is inherited. Hashish come from Marrakech, all my kush is American. Man I feel like a therapist, pistol on me like Maravich. I careless, I'm so perilous with all of this arrogance, goddamn. Money, hoes, that's something that you can't chase. I ain't shit but let you eat from the same plate. If you ungrateful then you ain't great. Me and Khaled come from the same place. Huh, holy land, holy land.

Gotta risk it all, gotta roll the dice. If you wanna taste of my life. [Bridge: Akon (+ B.o.B.)]. My life, my life. (My life, my life). You want a taste of my life?. [Verse 1]. [B.o.B.]. Yeah, they wanna taste that rapper life. But the road of fame usually spoils the appetite. We live the type of dreams you wish for in the afterlife. But all that they can see is velvet ropes and flashing lights. Not everything is lavished life. But in the mirror, all I see is all the nights I had to fight. And so I run it, all I had to sacrifice. But now I got the money, I get everything for half the price. Damn. [Akon]. You know Khaled, everybody wants the good life. Ayo, ayo, ayo, nobody really wanna pay the price. Ayo, ayo, ayo, no pain, no gain, na na na na. This might take a little longer. No pain, no gain, it will only make you stronger. [Hook: Akon]. You already know the story, down this road before.

nas album done (feat. nas),"[Intro: DJ Khaled]. Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic. DJ Khaled!. [Verse 1: Nas]. A divine leader, shine brighter. Bonita mami, meet a line sniffer. Never, poetic rhyme writer, chiefer. Ebony empress getter. Celebrity Apprentice a devil show. Big up to Africa, Mexico. Hennessy, margarita, venison eater. So dear spread 'em here, don't be actin' innocent either. Dome me, relax me, it's only to the nasty. I'm just a phony assassin. A lot of niggas owe me, I'ma tax 'em. A lot of sisters hold me to somethin' holy and Catholic. ‘Cause the rosary and gold flashy. Just an attachment and accessory to my dress code. Now everywhere all I see is Pablo, Esco. Last time I checked I was still breathin'. My neck was still freezin'. Now everybody got an Escobar Season. To every baby on the album cover existin'. This trend I was settin', it came to fruition. I'm assistin' to push the culture forward. To all my ghost supporters, go support us. Like a local black-owned grocery store. ‘Cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood. It's a dub on that, we get government aid. Spend it at they stores, puttin' they kids through college. We need balance. So we can lease and own deeds in our projects. So I'm askin' Gs to go in their pockets. The racial economic inequality, let's try to solve it. [Hook: Nas]. My signature fade with the Bevel blade. That's a major key. I told her she smart and loyal, I like that. That's a major key. Start a label, run it, sign yourself. That's a major key. What Tony had on the table. It's like us, we a major key. [Verse 2: Nas]. Still underestimated, every mistake a lesson. Mercury retrograde, so if that planet spin backwards. Up in the heavens maybe. It's effectin' back on niggas who don't be reppin' lately. I'm playin' chess with babies. Niggas is nursery. Niggas impersonatin', rehearsin' me. Nothin' like me, I'm the first of me. And that's quite certainly. So official, come get this issue, some women crazy. I like a woman to show me wisdom. These hoes easily convinced to pop their pussy. With a loaded pistol. Y'all ain't meant to be played. Says the brother with the signature fade. Still paid, stackin', new stash. Went from hangin' with shooters and clappers. To computer hackers. Check the fashion in Monaco. Gettin' ocean mist on my HSTRY hats. Khaled called me when I was in album mode. So I put it on hold for the Major Key. My album done, niggas, wait and see. [Interlude: DJ Khaled]. Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic. [Hook: Nas]. My signature fade with the Bevel blade. That's a major key. I told her she smart and loyal, I like that. That's a major key. Start a label, run it, sign yourself. That's a major key. What Tony had on the table. It's like us, we a major keyy"
"never surrender (feat. scarface, jadakiss, meek mill, akon, john legend & anthony hamilton)","[Intro: DJ Khaled]. Keep your circle tight. Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no). DJ Khaled!. [Verse 1: Scarface]. Gotta be careful who you trusting. Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling. Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg. All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all. You fuck with dude, he your day one. Almost had it all then the day comes. When they walking through your house with the strap out. Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out. (yeah). Bright lights down the hallways. Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay). They say that every doors got a day coming. It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing. Eyes wide shut like you looking at me. Window pain to the soul say they niggas happy. But the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach. The homie didn't keep it one hundred. The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect. Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that (fuck, that). For money, niggas murder what they close to. (get this nigga). Entire families these mother fuckin' ghost you. Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?. Just prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz. Was it worth what that life was?. Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz. [Bridge: John Legend]. Cuz when you need it the most ain't no one ever around. Cold world, cold world. [Verse 2: Jadakiss]. Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unawareable. He fuck around jump of a building if you dare him to. The greats they done already killed him. who you compare him to. Figure out what he said will take a year or two. Family over everything, skills over politics. He don't need the accolades. as long as you acknowledge it. Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces. Betrayal is worse than death in most cases. The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist. Multiple shots to the face, No chasers. Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited. Your man that you grew up with get you indicted. This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go. Found out at the trial they got audio and video. Shit don't always happen how you plan it. Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is. You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas. That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas. You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure. You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more. He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war. Even had a crack spot together, the first floor. Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door. That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour. Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces. He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers. Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains. Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting. Nothing but old pictures of old sixes. Old BM's with the kids, old snitches. Two sides, both wishes. Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches. [Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]. See there's a story in my life. There's a story in my pain. There's a story in my tears, ohh-ohh ohh. There's a story in me. [Verse 3: Meek Mill]. Yeah, for life. Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends. And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends. Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance. Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me. take the stand, damn. Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told. I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile. Knew him since a child, man this game so foul. But niggas made vows to a code I never break. Ridin' in the heavy weight. Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight. Never on time, when I show up I be ready late. Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate. And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full. If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull. We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store. On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for. Hah!. [Bridge: Akon]. My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told). All the success that I'm suffering from. Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I know). My family fucks with me. And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way). That's why I don't trust nobody. And I doubt you'll ever see that day. 'Fore I surrender to you (surrender) , surrender to you. (surrender). Surrender to you, surrender to you. Which I will never do. [Bridge: John Legend & Anthony Hamilton]. Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around. (nobody's around). Cold world (cold world) , cold world (mm, yes it is, yeah). And the ones that you keep close. are the ones will take you down (always take you down). Cold world (coold) , a cold cold world. [Hook: Akon]. 'Fore I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you. (surrender). Surrender to you, surrender to you. 'Fore I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you. (surrender). Surrender to you, surrender to you. Which I will never do. Ohh-ohhohhwhooa. Ohh-ohh (ohh-ohh) ohh-ohh. [Bridge: Anthony Hamilton & John Legend]. See there's a story in my life (Surrender). There's a story in my pain (Surrender). There's a story in my tears (Surrender). There's a story in me. (I won't Surrender, I won't surrender, ohh no no no)"

With these billions on my mind, it's hard to be cohesive. Gettin' that A-Rod money like I hit the needle. Keep a spanish mamacita like a Fanta liter. And I gave 'em all dope and they pissed off. Got my lil Haiti babies waiting so they can wack ya. I got my Memphis Ten niggas waiting to jack ya. I got some DC niggas waiting to kidnap ya. I got the clappers, finessers and the trappers. Before the rap change, you gotta go dap em. Don't forget to look at niggas when they after ya. [Verse 2: Yo Gotti]. I told Future I can see the future. Told my bitch I love you 'fore I knew you. I know I'm blessed nigga, hallelujah (I'm grateful). And if you diss me then I might shoot ya (brrt). You don't fuck with me, the feeling mutual (fuck you). Half these rap niggas owe they jeweler (fuck 'em). I was selling keys to success. I was coppin' keys outta Texas. New Wraith with the stars in it. New Porsche, condo, living room cars in it. Ace of Spades with the Percocet and bars in it. Young shooters, real soldiers put they heart in it. Let's talk 'bout all this money we make and all these niggas they hatin'. Let's talk 'bout runnin' that bag up fast cause we ain't got no patience. Let's talk 'bout poppin' 'scripts and Xans like we're patients. And them fed's allegations will have you pacin'. Million dollar dope boy, I gotta be grateful. You tryna get that 100 mil', I'ma race you. Dope boy, I ain't never wanna be a rap nigga. Billboard reporter LA Reid just signed a trap nigga. New York Times read Jay Z just signed a trap nigga. Kitchen like it's Thursday, you heard? Might bring it back nigga. You fuckin' the money up if I'm being honest. Gotta be grateful, I never break the promise, I know my plug love me. I know my bitch hate me, I heard my hood salty. I tried to tell 'em it ain't my fault, it's just my blessings called me. But since they hatin' on an nigga I'ma keep ballin'. And I ain't textin' that bitch back because she keep stallin'. If she ain't fuckin first night then she just miss her callin'. Fuck a plea, I'm goin' to trial, poker face, I'm all in. Patek Philippe, AP, 40 mil', I'm all in. Plug hit my line I act like I ain't see 'em callin'. I worked so hard for mine I'm tryna get some free bands. I'm the king of the city, my house Graceland. No respect for rappers, they respect the coke man. That's why your favorite rapper actin' like the dope man nigga"

Y'all rap niggas on some pop shit. I've been ducking paparazzi with a pop bitch. Glock 30. in the cockpit. Sipping dirty, come and sail with the pilot. Nigga, you ain't seen it, I've been fucking up arenas. I'm with double M, the genius. We the motherfucking meanest. And the cleanest in a long time. You pussy niggas hating on me picked the wrong time. Long line for a limp mink draggin', new bandwagon. Blood dripping on me looking like a nigga stabbed him. I be on the money, baking soda in the cabinet. Pyrex, trying to whip a Rollie, making magic. Laughing at you fuck niggas getting madder. If I feel threatened, I'mma go and get a ladder.

Diamond, look like they glowing. 50 stacks, all singles, I make it look like its snowing. Black unmarked cars, gotta peep how they playin'. Treat 'em like jack boys, catch 'em slippin' then slay 'em. Lord forgive me for my sins, that?s my confessions if they put me in this benz. I got possession of a federal offence. I?m talking pressure in my criminal intent. So wear ya vest?s and I?m still gon? stunt. Like it ain't no tomorrow, f-ck ya house note n-gga. Blow that bitch on a bottle. The Ferrari just a front, got the Lambo in the back. Tell you ?we the best forever? DJ Khaled handle that. [T-Pain - Chorus]. [Plies]. I know some n-ggas from my hood that would rob Noriega. I'm talkin' Noriega, n-gga, the real Noriega. If you ain't from the hood, bitch, than stop impersonating us. And tell congress when you see ?em bitch I?m stealin? cable. And leave the D-Boys alone ?cause they motivate us. And why is the half of my whole hood on papers. Some are on house arrest, some are on child support. Some of 'em did they bit, the other half waiting to go to court. Mr Landlord we gon bust your ass with an eviction note. Better have the police with you dog, if you came to repo. I'm talking strip clubs, I'm talking liquor stores. We throw our money round here, but y?all can?. [T-Pain - Chorus]. [Lil Wayne]. Bitch I'm on probation, so my nerves bad. And they say time fly's, well mine?s first class. I landed in the sky, I fell from the streets. I talk a lot of sh-t and practice what I preach. Back from hell, cell 23, tell the warden kiss my ass. Pockets on Monique. Bitch I'm from the murder capital. Hoe, I'm far from practical. Shit happens and since I?m the shit, I'm who it happens to. Young Money, Cash Money, blood bitch, I'm red hot. I don't see nobody, see nobody like a head shot. All that bullshit is for the birds, throw some bread out. Got it sewn up, check the thread count"

Now wear the wrong color and catch a Rodney King beatdown. Kids hit with switches, mamas is qoutin' scriptures. While Ludas gettin head, more gums than baby pictures. Cock my 40 glock and my partna just bought a replica. Now Asains sayin they don't keep no cash in they register (hurry up and buy). We run from red & blue lights to get that green.

Ya'll know what it is, I'm comin to get it & others are blockin. I'm runnin the hood and nothin can top it. You can google it and you can search it. On how a nigga come and unlock it, impossible to stop it. More fire, thunder, pain, I go and heed the villian, he's adrenaline poppin. Need a medical situation because the way I'm fuckin everything until I'm peepin it. Why you tryna do what you already know that I'm the king with it. And, you don't wanna come behind me with it bro. Uggh, I killed this shit I ain't gotta rhyme no more. [Twista:]. Welcome to my hood where poor members of faculty backin me. If you ever try attackin me, that could be when I eat em. Especially when I beat em, when they see a bunch of killas and hustlas on the side of me. I'm an anomoly to em, put em on crutches. We'll sock ya lip first for you touch us, he one that's kickin our brothas. Much as I smoke the duchess and model chicks that cut us. And muthafuckas that love us, their enemies wanna touch us. I'm a spit a flow as if it was a sin, then the gangstas are restin forever. See a solid 4, then I'm a put it on the fin. Then you know to never test, it'll be a category F5.

They knockin packs off, they lettin gats off. Medicate, benefit cards scratch off's. Savin every dime, tryna choke a quarter. And they ain't sellin crack, they sellin coke & water. Smokin or ya snortin, they coppin all the Jordans. Nothins more important, steal em if you can't afford em. I'm gettin to the money, I need another comma. Some of em love the drama, more than they love they mama. [Bun B:]. Welcome to the land of the trill, where everybody walkin with they hand on they steel. And, a model is a supply & demand any will. You went outta line with the wrong man then get killed. When ya damned if you will & damned if you won't. Lotta dudes sayin that they can but they don't. Lotta boys sayin that they g's and they ain't. Mess around, get layed down in the paint. Better do what you say, and say what you do. For I come around ya hood, broad day with the crew. They got them fists, AR's, AK's and them twos. And they will gladiate all day, what it do. R.I.P. to the trillest that did it, to my g's on lockdown.
