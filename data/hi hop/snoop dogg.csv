Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch. Knowin damn well, I'm caught up with my grip. Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger. How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop. Doggy, I'm all the above. I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes. But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it. Cause you know I don't love em. (Verse Four: Warren G). Whoa!. Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhake with my flow. One for the money, two for the bitches. Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches. In my Chevy, six-fo' Red to be exact. With bitches on my side, and bitches on back. So back up bitch cuz i'm strugglin, so get. off your knees and then start jugglin. these motherfuckin nuts in your mouth. It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout. Whoo!. Chorus: (Repeat 4X).

They get down for theirs, bring em right to the back. Hit the gate don't wait and ask the homey Nate. he gotta pit named Tiny mobbin behind him. Now they've got Michael Corleone. Oh, Kurupt he got Lonely the psycho assassin. He likes to smash on, uhh. and ain't no need to reach for heat cos you can't get your blast on. Doggz we keep em, busters we sweep em. and when it's time all my Doggz'll bite your momma. We leave you niggas on stuck in paws. And I'ma dedicate this one to my Doggz. Remember that pit, the one I had named Petey. Uhh, she got killed so I didn't need him. Uhh, it's like that, what about Sweetie?. He got killed too (damn) so I didn't need him. It's a cold thang but it's a cold game. but when you wit a Corleone name it's a cold thang. Cold name, cold game ya got ta get down. cos if you don't then you can't represent the Pound. Now it's like a sport. and if I get caught I'm right back in court. So I gots ta keep it on the DL and don't yeezell. but you know I gots tha pitbulls for seezell. So if you want one, get one, holla at'cha boy quick. cos I'ma be on the lookout for the sell-to-dem pigs. Ask my little homey Technique. I 'came Scarface, Corleone killers, baby boy OG. The homey Tray Deee I give him rock seat. but the rest of the pits they rollin wit me. We're layin low in the cut, holstered up in Chino. Scrappy-Du and the crew called the Gambinos. Ma bark and she'll spark up some shit real quick. Just last week y'know what? She bit the shit out of me. ???? bitch is a trick, I had to get cold feet. to get the bitch up off me. and I can't tame her and I can't blame her. That's why I had to name her the top Dogg gamer. Man, it's a shame-uh nigga got love for y'all. but I got more love for my motherfuckin Doggz. It's just..... Hook:. Me & my Doggz (sick em), me & my Doggz (sick em). (Beware, beware) Me & my Doggz. Verse 2:. Now when it comes to my Doggz they stay fly like geese. but as for me I'm Snoop Dogg I'm soopafly like Priest. I unleash my Doggz then I tilt my brim. I'm bout to trip off Locko cos he go taken my swim. I think cos my CREAMy low, get back to the pound. He gon' be itchin like hell to put the bite on the clown. and when you look with the frown he gon' get like 1-2. and ain't a damn thang that your ass can do. I think it's cos he lost his big homey Don Killer see. who ran the whole yard and gangbanged OP. and leave your ass red and yeah half-head. He's a damn fool, he'll jack you for pants leg. Don't beg you're dead, and don't dare show fear. Young gangsta fucked wit Scrappy and Red tore off his head. and all the kid do was cry like a bitch. His life was a pit and mine's in the shit. Hook:. (Beware, beware). (Sick em) It's just me & my Doggz. I keep my heat in my seat, my killers in my backyard. Just in case you niggas wanna fuck and try to act hard.

10 lil' crips,"[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]. Ten little Crip niggaz runnin outside. All from the turf and they bangin out lives. Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside. Where they don't die they just multiply. So.. don't give them niggaz a reason. To turn it into spray season. Don't give them niggaz a reason. Because they'll turn it into Crip season. [Snoop Dogg]. The gangsta's back, the bank is fat. The gangsta mack, in a gangsta 'llac. Hmm.. fools be like, ""Break off some cheese"". Friends and enemies, aww nigga please. Fuck, you thought who pumped you up. Stop, you stuck too much, pop, drop, you plucked. It's all similar to gettin laaaid. on ya back when the motherfuckin K spraaays. I grind for my shine about my bidness. Lunatic on the shit and I get ignit (ignit). Gonna proceed to squeeze with ease. One of these, they can't believe how I leave 'em. Look into a mind of a nigga that's crazy. Seventeen years old and still a baby. Gangstas real, they pop the pill. You cap back, young motherfucker it's like that. [Chorus]. [Snoop Dogg]. Wake up in the morning lookin funny and shit. Fuck a honey dip.. 'cause I got money to get. Ain't no books, ain't no help, ain't no role to this. Stay focused young homey, that's the code to this. Keep a strap in ya pocket when ya tip through the towns. There's a million motherfuckers tryna get you down. A lot of pain in this game, cocaine is the thang. If ya money right then you might get you a chain. But if ya money is low, there's only one way to go. Jack a rapper at a local rap radio show. So mean, so green, crip back to the block. Then brag to the homies, show 'em what you got. It's a gangsta jack (gangsta jack), in gangsta black (black). And they thought we just gangsta rapped. Yeah nigga, we take your snaps. Your shooby dooby, hooroobies, and your Scooby snacks (It's like that?). It's like that!. [Chorus]. [Snoop Dogg]. It's a whole lot of fillin when you on the Eastside. On the Eastside, nigga we ride. And it's a whole lot of dealin when you on the Eastside. On the Eastside, nigga we ride. And it's a whole lot of stealin when you on the Eastside. On the Eastside, nigga we ride. And it's a whole lot of killin when you on the Eastside. Eastside, yeah nigga we ride. [Chorus]. [Snoop Dogg] {*singing*}. They say it's crazy out here, it ain't no more fun.

a bitch i knew,"Good evening ladies and gentlemen. {*scratched*: ""Let's describe a certain female""}. [Chorus: Snoop]. Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy. It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy. Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy. It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy. Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy. It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy. [Snoop Dogg]. It all goes back, to '85. When I start gettin pussy every day of my life. It really didn't matter what the bitch look like. I remember one night, after the Sugar Ray fight. Wouldn't you believe it, Dogg like a retriever. I went up in this big fat bitch named Treva. She had a best friend with titties named Vanessa. She told me to undress her, yessir. Ain't no pressure, later that semester. She put me down with her homegirl name Tanisha. She was so vicious, lips so luscious. Suck a nigga dick and have it shinin like some dishes. Patricia, Patricia, she love the way I stick her. I take her to the movies and now, she eat the dick up. Big bucks, no whammies. I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy. She lived in the Valley, she couldn't understand me. But she let me dig out, her homegirl named Brandi. Now Brandi was a cute little thick bitch. She moved to the hood from the 2-oh-6. She brought some new tricks, flippin them squirrels. And the pearls, and turnin out the neighborhood little girls. Hmm, and I seen that, so I peep the game. So I put her down, bottom bitch on my team. And we began makin, breakin bitches takin. whatever we want, see she want with the fakin. It's real in the field, no mistakin. And crack the little bitch, yeah she Jamaican. Time and time again she would bring me bud. And let me beat it up, listenin to ""One Love"". Off some jerk chicken, I got mo' bitches. Now I'm fuckin her sister it's gettin real suspicious. But the dick is good, so they won't tell. And now they next door neighbor, Clarissa Bell. She been lookin at me, I think she wanna hit. But I'ma holla back, cause I'm on another bitch. I'm on some other shit, I got a phone call. From the motherfuckin president y'all. He said, ""Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch. and make her suck a dick and not get caught for the fuck of it?"". I called and look here, this what you do. Make the First Lady sell a little pussy for you. I think he got it, cause he left fast. He left his daughters, and a lot of cash. Well what do ya know, D-O-double-G. Major pimpin, out in D.C.. And I'm a young pimp, got a lot of growin left. And you's a young hoe with a lot of hoein left. Always keep a hoe in check, blowin us a train wreck. Yeah I might have to go in depth. See every little hoe I met. They're standouts, you know the ones like Yvette. We fucked in the car, behind a bar. I shot it in her face and it went ""Ahhh"". My homeboy Charles. Went up in his sister, behind the garage. I was menace, I was freaky, I was sick. When y'all was tryin to hump, I was teachin them to suck dick. Always tryin to go up in a hoe. Got caught tryin to fuck in school they asked me what I did it fo'. You know just what I told her?. I love pussy, and this dick is what I showed her. And now they threw me out, now I'm at the pad. I'm at a new school, way cool. New hoes, new script, fresh fish. Walk up in the room and I bust a new bitch. I'm in some new tail, wanna holla back. But for now let me holla back Impala black. She's a 12th grader, in my science class. And I done seen the pussy, yeah boy I'm movin fast. See I was taught by, and I was taught I. better move on somethin fast if I thought I. could claim a dame, or game her brain. Or tame a man, not with the same old game. See on some different stuff, I'm a different cut. It's what I say and do to make the bitch give it up. Oh you wanna brag? I wanna brag too. Now what you gon' do, when they ask you. Is you gon' tell a lie, or you gon' keep it G. Or you gon' hold it all inside or you gon' tell on me?. Shit it's all cool, cause it was all good. It's just another day in Doggy Dogg's neighborhood. You better watch your girl, cause if she on the loose. It's a 90 percent chance she gon' get pimp juice. Now what it do, what it is. Now you livin with that hoe and y'all got fo' kids. Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy. It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy. Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy. It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy. Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy. It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy. {*fades out*}"

because i'm black,"[Hook]. Is it because I'm black?. Somebody tell me, what can I do?. ('Cause their ain't enough bars. To hold the the drama that we've been through). [Verse 1]. Right here, right now, I do declare. That I'm more than a gangster, mack, pimp or a player. I swear I ain't never told on nobody. It started in '82 at a 'hood house party. Half Ded, Lil' Loc and my nephew D. Not knowin' what we do, but this is RTC. Heart sparked, puttin' flags in Tucane Park. I leave the house for school, but I come back after dark. You feel me?. [Hook]. [Verse 2]. More power, more leadership - unifying Bloods and Crips. I used to smoke a pack a day, I used to have to pack a K. Now I've got brothers in suits in my faculty. Pushin' peace in the streets - North, West, South and East. Student of the game, yeah it's time to make a change. So I'm following, no more swine swallowin'. I'm gon' just walk the walk of a righteous man. Try my best to rewrite this plan. As-salamu alaykum, sir. Yeah, that's the plan. [Hook x2]. [Verse 3]. Yeah, I'm down with Obama just to add a little drama. And I'm rollin' with the Nation, but I've been doin' that. Had a talk with my mama, had to let her know that I'mma. Make a change, and she said: ""baby, go ahead and do that"". Farrakhan is a prophet and I know it 'cause he show it. And he told me, so I'm teachin' brothers how to be peace. What's wrong? We too strong, and if we all get along. They could never penetrate us, all they do is motivate us. Haters. [Hook]"
been around tha world,"[Intro - Snoop Dogg]. Yeah, this record for my baby, my baby boo. I know I'm always on the road, I'm always gone. And you say I never make records for you no more. Well this record is from me to you, baby. Yeah, real talk. [Chorus - Tone]. Been around tha world. I've been into many places. Seen some unfamiliar faces. But baby, none of them compare to you. Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone. [Verse One - SD]. I seen everything twice. Been around tha world, I've seen every scene twice. Stopping down in Tokyo, dipping in the rice. I'm a boss at the wind, I cracked every colored dice. I do it big, f**k the rumors. Rich and infamous with the blue and grey Pumas. Gangstas don't die, they just move to Miami. I did all that, I was voted ???. I'm sorta like Sammy. Smoother than Marvin, I need me a Tammy. Sippin Chardinae, making deals with my hands free. Fatherhood, now the actors can't stand me. Cause I own rap, and I'm coming for your day job. Until then, I'm chilling at the day spa. Relax my mind and just chill. Cause without you, none of this is real. Baby, you know I. [Chorus]. [Verse Two - SD]. Yeah, but now I'm back across the water. I'm in Sydney with somebody's daughter. Blowing sticky by the zips, and they can tell. By my rag hanging, nigga, this is Crip, but I'm. chilling. It feels so good to get away. Especially when your name is D-O-double-Gizzee. Coast-to-coast jetting, man, I been doing that. What you do, just start balling? I been around the. track. Hop in Peas with the bosses. 300 for the yacht, the third deck got a office. Docking down in Manico, churching with my folks. Bad luck had me dying when I fell up out that boat. My life is like a movie. But the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me. Then I relax and chill. Cause without you, none of this is real. Baby you know I. [Chorus]. [Outro - SD]. Just for you baby. Yeah, I'm on my way home right now. I'm on my way right now. I'm leaving the studio right now. Soon as I get home tomorrow, I'ma go unplug it. Matter of fact, I ain't even gonna bring it in the. house. See you in a minute..."
betta days,"Celebrate, grab a drink and put a blunt in the sky. Worldwide, nigga it's 1999. Shit out of control, sign of the times. I ain't had this much fun since '79. I was only eight then, hadn't been to the penn. Just a young nigga on the front of a swing. Playin football up in Powly High. Too young to ride but it's still Eastside. Homocides didn't happen much, niggas wasn't rappin much. It's 99 nigga, shit, I know you strappin up. Hell motherfuckin yeah, nigga wanna see the end. So next year we can do it all again. Same dogg channel, same dogg time. Only the strong will survive in 99. So much drama and dillusion, my conclusion is confusing. Drippin on my memories, twisted off my music. Tryin to make my people do things, oh yeah we do's it, we do's it. Here's my number baby girl don't you lose it. It's smoky in this motherfucker while we cruising. And Eastside niggas is the shadiest (shadiest). But them Westside niggas is the craziest (craziest). Summertime on the grind, baby let me shine, let me shine. Roll with this shit, I'm cold with this shit in my prime. Nigga done time and I never dropped a motherfucking dime. Be smart, fresh start is all you need. First thing first, cuz, stop smoking cess weed. You are what you smoke, nigga stop hating. That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating. But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say. But somehow someway, better days ahead, Freddy's dead. And Betty said Eddie's a fed. Sweaty in bed with a nine to his head. And he fuckin with this hoodrat that he met up in dance. Betty gettin mad cause Eddie wanna share. But look at how you livin for a minute then compare. I love confetti, I always stay ready. Keep some killers by my side and some riders by the telli. I'm ready to do now, who now, you now. Eddie wasn't ready when they drew that, booyow. Two down, with just one gun. My nigga, and who said killin wasn't no fun. I sit alone in the zone with a face of stone. Live the life of Al Capone or Don Coroleone. Tragically casulties and fatalities. And all kinds of funny ass niggas coming after me. My grand pappy once sat me on his lap and he said. Sonny get your money 'fore you end up dead. I never really understood what he said. Until my motherfucking dogg took a slug in his head. Cold way nigga gotta learn his lesson. Slow down and go down, shit you know now. Be smart, fresh start is all you need. First things first cuz, stop smokin cess weed. You are what you smoke, my nigga stop hating. That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating. But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say. But somehow someway, you got to make a better way. (Somehow someway). You got to make a better way. (You got to make a better way). You got to make a better way. (You got to make a better way).

Doggystyle is coming and there'll be no more waiting. You might be shooting up close with the Itial ever lose respectin. VERSE 1:(KURUPT). Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind. Thinkin many plots blossoms how amny times?. I'm sedated my (?conscriptiated?) from beginning. Broke in the bombest weed smoke that will make a nigga choke. To my loccs way down in the Valley deep. To my homies in the Pound from L-ong Beach. To my bulls out in Philly coz all they smoke is phillies. Wit' these silly ass bitches out for a niggas riches. Now really really ever slip or trip. A big shout out to my niggas in ??. I spits the vocabulary to sinks MCs like ships. With my nocturnal rhymes and editorial clips. I gotta click that'll hit you like a thousand volts. The homies catchin cases,robberies and assaults. It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that. Listen in,get elevated off the verbal contact. BRIGDE:(DAT NIGGA DAZ). When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop. Gotta get somewhere. When a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop. Gotta get somewhere. VERSE 2:(DAZ,BAD AZZ,*unknown*). My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid. Hurt em in the worst way,put it down for myself. Put em to rest,confess nevertheless. Snatch em a cap and destroy em at my best. For the simple fact that with contact we the block entourage. We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast. And the rest of the jungle,while mistreat. Any MC tryin to fuck with D-A-Z. I represent it to the fullest,it could be a verbal massacre. In '96,with a diff'rent approach I'm shit. I got the flavour and I'm major,bust the ass. Niggas can't stop us and can't fade us. Shady ass niggas can't stand next to ya. When the Tek connects to ya,swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya. I bet'cha I won't let ya escape. Face-to-real on point-to-train-to kill beyond the violated area. When the smoke clears the area,rather we toast. So at home I blaze the zag or the bone. Once again another zone is gone. MCs try to step they get lit and blown. At the end the lights go out so before they do. I'm a L-B-C on through,stayin true. Demanding my respect,respect is what I've given. So respect is what I expect,the money got me driven. To the point of no return so the streets I roam. Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black. .45 calibre Glock,gat,gun or pistol. Whistle and watch all my homeboys come run. Or hear the click,damn that shit that you get hit with. When we bust I let loose,this is pre-meditated dick-up. To all the busters that jealous and hate it but can't fade it. With the every attempt they fail,oh well. Consequences get suffered,I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers. The bill is crisp,(the deal is )the deal is this-. I gotta plot em on a mash for my chips. Get in my way and get stepped on. I'm stompin,steppin with my projectile weapon. Wuz up (?Jex?)so's eject the hum. When I swarm through,who knew about the real deal I conceal?. But still can you feel the topic of the whole situation is trust. No ho is a must!If I bust. My brain constructs to form knowledge to the max. Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs. We wax tracks and smack up MCs who compose the violence. Bringin drama with no parental guidance. Eyes went deceived,somethin up my sleeve to intrigue. And these MCs will be Gs also D-P-Gs and L-B-Cs. When we do the do to you so go call your crew. And who wants to compete with technique. Conflict will be verbal so watch how you speak. And what you say when I display. Sleepless acts as (?bombin ya?),suffer from insomnia. And I'm a gonna be comin for you. So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew. (Watch out nigga!). OUTRO:(SNOOP DOGG). It's the sucker MC barbecue cookout!Cookout!. Watch out now!. Ha-ha yeah wit'cha bad self.Watch out!."

boss' life,"Some of 'em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block. Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop. But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't. That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life. So many niggaz wanna play but still got dues to pay. Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay. But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't. That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life. Now this is for the B's and the C's, and the D's and the H's. And the G's puttin work in overseas. At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed. Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me. Baby this is presidential really. A pocket full of women understanding how I'm living. Show them hoes how you winning. It's the beginning with the pearls you're given. The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon. But everyday like 50 say, it's Many Men. They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends. But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs. Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'ma have to let 'em go. You know how the Dogg roll.. don't get it twisted. 'Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit. A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin pimpish. And it's comin from the Beach where them niggaz is a beast. But I just listen, all that shit is in my past. I'm connected to the purse first nigga.. the ass last. From Long Beach to Venice is the premise. Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish. [Chorus]. See me man, I'm nothin like you. I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to. I'm leanin in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin. Me, I'm ridin by ya on the corner, block slangin. I'm livin that boss' life (life). The hoes come runnin when they see me comin. I'm livin that boss' life (life). You can have anything just don't fuck with my money (my money). This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South. Khaki's and them Tim's and them niggaz with the platinum mouths. Thinkin that they blessed by the actions that be comin out. When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout. But trickin ain't the route (route), that's even if you got it. There's a method to you holdin it when they can't do without it. Just put the key up in it nigga if she 'bout it. You can have her and her partner, fuckin with it for a dolla. If she a balla, she gon' ride with a shot caller. Roll with the Bo$$ Dogg in the back of a blue Impala. And if she follow.. then she gon' swallow. All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow. But I would never bother breakin out Tha Doggfather. 'Less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin diamonds on his collar. I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners. Walkin on the blue carpet with the Doctor (Doctor). [Chorus]"

Motherfuckers yappin', I don't hear 'em. Fuck them suckas, I don't fear 'em. I'm speedin' through traffic. Kush smokin', I'm blasted. With a pocket full of money. [Hook]. [Verse 2]. BMW - bitches, music and weed. I've got the flyest girls, I puff the fire, no seeds. Sucker-ducker, baby, I'm so inspired to be me. That's why I ride low-key, high as a tree. Ridin' 'round buzzin', what it do, cousin?. You ain't gotta like my style, but your boo love me. Pockets fatter than Precious, I am the freshest. Yellow gold on my necklace. Just left the club, homie on the guest list. Kush blowin', 2 AM, that's breakfast. Bumpin' James Brown, it's a man's world. That pinky ring on my hand a couple grand, girl. She love that I'm tatted. My speakers is blastin', flashin'. With a pocket full of money. [Hook]"

So much drama on the ave, the copper just laughed. Man the West is wild, that old hit was wrong. Cause out here, momma don't have, and poppa don't have. As God blessed the child that can go get his own. And we struggle hard suffer long, I'm feelin like this life is a trip. Tryin to keep our hearts pure through the sins. But the race ain't to the swift or the strong, the wise or the rich. But to them they can endure to the end and win. [Stevie Wonder]. When you feel your life's too harr-arrd. Just go have a talk with Go-ood... yeahheyy. [scatting to a harmonica]. Out here the only free psychiatrist, that's known throughout the world.

It's time to research the documents and pull some files. and put it down with this gangsta style. Cause I be seein niggaz bein more aggressive now. after peace treaty meetings and the weapons down. Sport Chucks 'member once it was Nikes and sandals. To me it's unlikely that you're sheisty and skanless. To manage this dramaticness I call my rep. Every step stay on deck keepin bustaz in check. Certified murder guide through the streets of death. Where the sleep ya slip soon as ya weakness met. From that real killer deal get ya steal and mash. Niggaz have done did when the steel'll blast. Pockets filled with cash, fuck a Benz or Jag. Lookin rough in a bucket, tuckin tens and Macs. Dip roam, chip phones, flip (?) and clock. Lick shots and the cops and control your block. Keep it true with the crew from the old to new. Ride providin 'em with guidance like your 'sposed to do. Notice who, participatin all the activity. That's how we livin G, strictly killer tendencies. So death to all my enemies. And to the homies who rest in peace, a dub bag and Hennessy. These weak niggaz killin me. with their proclivity to even proclimate that they as real as me. [Chorus].

Cause with this bullshit I'm not concerned. Me and my brother bounced in the Benz. We driving around our territory again. I pull up at the light like a superstar. An automatic weapon cold sprayed my car. I hit the accellerater scared as shit. I drove one block to find my brother was hit. He wasnt dead but the blood was pouring. And all I could think about was Warren. Later I found it was Dogg and his crew. Now tell mw what the fuck am I suppose to do. [Chours]x8. [Mac Talking]. Yeah so now you see what I'm talkin bout nigga. You see what that love shit do ya. This nigga said he had love nigga and this nigga done shot yo brother. So what the fuck you gone do now. [Snoop]. My brother s out of it but I'm still in it. On top of that I'm in it to win it. I cant believe that Dogg would dis me. That faggot that punk he soft or sissy. I driving around with three of my guys. The war is on and I'm on the rise. We rolled right up to Dogg's favorite hang out. What's cracking Dogg and let the bullets stang out. Someone shot back so we took cover. And all i could about was my brother. Dogg jumped up and began to run. Bustin shots hopping to hit someone. So I just stopped and let off three shot. Two hit that nigga and one hit a cop. I threw down the gun and began to shout. ""Ay y'all all lets break out got 'em dip out. Now as I left there goes the boys in blue. They pointin they guns at my four man crew. They shot down one, they shot down two. Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do. [Chours] x8. [Snoop Talking]. Ya see the moral of the story is this. Love is a motherfucka. And Doggs is a motherfucka. You mix the two up you bound to get some drama. Loves gonna get ya. Naw nigga Doggz gonna get ya you ever try to play me and thats real. Thats real. Thats real."
doin' too much,"[Snoop Dogg]. *inhales*. Aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo Quik check this out dog. You know mothafuckers be doin way way too mothafuckin much. You know? That's real. Just like baby right here, she doin too much. Now if that nigga next to you got a rented car. And he actin like it's his but you know it's not. Say he doin too much, yeah nigga you doin too much. And if that stuck-up bitch got the bar posted-up. She actin like that hair's hers but you know what's up. Say she doin too much, yeah baby you doin too much. I gave my kinfolk the keys to my Suburb. I told em ""Hit the side and slide and get the herb"". But guess who's callin, Pipedream Patty. Made that nigga park my whoride beside the alley. Forget about that nigga though (fuck that nigga). Fuck that nigga yo. But I can't forget about him cuz he taught me everything I know. Oh no Joe, walkin down the wrong lane. Tootin on that cocaine, fuckin wit that wrong thang. Niggas like that (what), get things like they want it (damn). Then fake the funk, doggonnit. Now loc, look at this predicament. You smoked out and can't be trusted, I can't kick it wit. Niggas like you, used to be in my crew. Goddamn, they don't make niggas like they used to. I remember Marley Marl and the Juice Crew. That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce-deuce. Now if you're doin for your family and you can't stand it. Cuz you know these mothafuckers tryin take advantage. Say they doin too much, yeah nigga you doin too much. And if your kinfolk broke and he smoke dope. And he need to catch a mothafuckin different stroke. Say he doin too much, yeah Joey you doin too much. We parlay, parlay everyday DPG style. We might throw a pool party every once in a while. Now in fact we gon' do one this weekend. Let's see how many hoes me and my nigga Rose can weed in. I believe in, sharin the cock. Also, I believe in comparin the cock. Look, don't knock a nigga like me (why?). Cuz she love the way I just beat up the pussy. Not just knee deep, she was totally deep. When she went down on me. She blew a nigga socks off, got a nigga rocks off. Ooh wee, baby you's a freak. Put my homey up on game like a gangsta. But my homey fell in love and he banked her. Ain't that a trip? Now we in a twist. Back in the county wit the red ribbon on his wrist. Now when a nigga hit his girl and she don't hit back. And he get his third strike wit no get back. Say he doin too much, yeah homey you doin too much. And when the homey in the pen, doin a sin. And his girlfriend fuckin wit his best friend. Say she doin too much, hell yeah she doin too much. I'm livin up in the hills, wine sippin wit mills. I'm havin major type of paper, I ain't trippin off bills (still). Show me some respect and accept my coolness. And don't mistake my kindness to mean I'm foolish. Use this as a warning, cuz I'm startin. To figure it's some niggas think I'm soft as Charmin. Pardon me, cuz I ain't mad when you get bent. But I hate when fools mistake me for U.S. ?spray?. Friends and family, gettin after me like repo. Eat, smoke, choke then want me to throw em a c-note. You doin too much when you clutchin on my touch-tone. Callin strays over nigga leadin months gone. Conversate for fo' hours, wastin mo' power. And only get to hit a cold shower. You fakin like you're makin more moves than Simpson. But frontin, pushin buttons, doin nuttin but sin. And when a nigga on yo' phone, runnin up yo' bill. Tryin to tell some hoodrat bitch how he feel. You know he doin too much, yeah nigga you doin too much. And when your baby momma cryin bout she need some milk. And you heard some other nigga did been at her tilt. You know she doin too much, yeah baby you doin too much. That's real."

don't be foolish,"[Snoop Dogg]. Yo dogg, niggas always asking me. ""Is the muthafuckin DPGC still together?"". Niggas gon ask me. ""Dogg ya'll still together, I heard ya'll broke up like the fat boys."". Nigga what, nigga this Dogg Pound for life nigga. We ain't going nowhere nigga. In matter of fact, you actin foolish right now with all that shit you kick. Nigga everywhere I go niggas be actin foolish. And uh, I'm a deal with that shit DPG style. [Kurupt]. I'm a rider, the first local stock pilot. Now what the fuck made you think the DP divided. Moving on up to the top of the map. Because gangsta will be here till the curl comeback. I'm moving down to block D, me and my homies. The Dogg Pound would rock overseas, immense degrees. No bitch niggas in the circle. Beat a nigga in his face till his fuckin eyes turn purple. [Daz Dillinger]. I told myself watch out for my family and health. I got my shit together, got the gauge up shelf. Knowing the rules have chose to hang out with the dummies and fools. Old school Poda Dada that I knew from way back to school. Attitude shitty, kept it raw and gritty. Uncut, me and my dawgs fuckin it up. What up. [Snoop Dogg]. Fuckin it up, fuckin it up for life nigga, Dogg Pound, ya heard. If I hear another nigga talking about what he gon do, to who. To me and my crew, nigga the grey and the blue. You through, you knew you shouldn't have done that. Now how the fuck you figure that we wasn't gon comeback. The D, the P, the G to C. Westcoast's finest and I'm a put that on me. See niggas been rappin but they ain't sayin shit. Nigga shut the fuck up, get off my dick. Chorus. Don't be foolish x2. [Daz]. Hook. You see you don't wanna fuck with us. Knowing how we throw it out, the sucka niggas want to imitate us. Cause all we wanna do is put the G right back in you. Yeah worry about your muthafuckin punk ass crew. And we keeps it gangsta fool, thats gangsta, keep it gangsta fool. [Snoop Dogg]. Trip, we got more dough than rock up, more niggas to lock up. You niggas need to strap up or pack up. See because this world we live in is crazy, and the people they so sick. See why I keeps it gangsta and I ride with the sickest clique. And when it comes to gun play, hell yeah we the quickest biach. [Daz Dillinger]. And oh my momma and my daddy, grandpapa and my granny. Homeboy you can't fuck with this. [Kurupt]. Smooth when we come through. The DP when we come through the gangstas is in the house. And all you muthafuckin niggas and you muthafuckin bitches. Get a muthafuckin dick in your mouth. I'm a gangsta I thought you knew, G'd up, grey and blue. Dippin through on the coop, made you blue. Kurupt and Snoop, Daz in the muthafuckin bomb ass clique. We gangstas nigga, laid back thinkin I tell you how it is in the hood. Where all my homies at, straps in Cadillacs. Hittin switches like e'yday, livin like the G way like e'yday, DPG-C. [Daz]. Hook. [Snoop Dogg]. Chorus x4. Just bullshittin man this dude done told me the Dogg Pound broke up. Wait till I catch that nigga, I'm a beat him down. Wait till I, wait till I catch em. Dogg Pound ain't gon never break up cause that's favorite group. They gon keep on commin out with albums. Wait till I catch this nigga, he lied to me. This did done tell me some stupid bullshit. Wait till I catch that muthafucker. Man don't be foolish and believe that shit. Shit man, don't be foolish. Don't be foolish, nigga. [Snoop Dogg]. Don't be foolish nigga, don't be foolish nigga.."
don't do the crime (aka death row killaz),"[Chorus, Snoop singing]. Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. Yeah. Don't do it. Fell off into a party in the CPT. Niggas looking at me strange. But I'm up on the game. I ain't fucking with them niggas no mo. Shit, I feel the same way ya'll feel. Nigga, fuck Death Row (ha ha). I cut em loose, send em juice. With visine in their cup. Catch em slipping, all my homeys get em stuck. It's the tale of a whale locked in a cell. On the streets he was the heat cause cuz had major mail. Had his homeboys plugged, wearing gold chains. Hanging at the studio, splurging and thangs. Nigga fucking off money, saving them hoes. Fucked off some money of mine. And bought me a white rolls. Living on Wilshire in a penthouse suite. Fucking bad bitches seven days a week. Colder than a motherfucker but now I'm hot. Floss me a brand new suit from Dionne Scott. I guess I'm balling now. Money falling down. I can hear them movie star bitches calling me now. Doggy Dogg come and get with the PG. Mr. Calvin Broadus could you please come and see me. But I ain't tripping, I'm just Dogg Pound Cripping. Talking big shit and in a bulletproof dipping. Make my own beats, so fuck ya'll too. And I'm down with the niggas from the you know who. We get to the point. Blaze the joint. Step into the party and holla at everybody. As long as the gin get mixed with juice. And the five on the crap game gon hit with deuce. Shit niggas gon be niggas so nigga nigga what. Just because I'm having paper don't mean fuck. I once was in the same predicament you was. Thinking to myself ""Damn should I kill cuz?"". But I know deep in my heart. Two wrongs ain't right. And it started from a fist fight. I only got one life to live. I'm trying to see a grandfather with some grandkids. You dig?. I'm trying to live long like my hair. Put the shit down, like Fred Estaire. I want to share my world. But how the fuck can I share it. Everytime I throw you something. You look at mine and compare it. Man, it's a cold shame. But it's a cold game. I ain't make the rules to this game. Look, all I know and all I do. Is try to come through with something new. Banging for you. So whatever you do, you like it or not. Because when your shit play out. I be back on the dope spot. My grandpappy once sat me in his lap and he said. ""Son get your money like that"" (get your money, man). I sit alone in the zone. Face of stone. Live the live of Al Capone. A Don Corleone. Casually casualties, fatalities. And all kind of funny looking niggas coming after me. Funny, it's got me dodging, dipping, slipping, and sliding. Eastside up, Eastsiders cause we riding (eastside up). This is portable something to fuck with your ear. Doggy Dogg will appear to make it sound so clear. I fucks it up, like I always do. And that's a trick. I'm saying some shit. To make the bitches want to suck my dick. See it's an everyday thang. Communicating to ya'll with the Dogg Pound Slang. Back up in the house and we just don't stop. Call ya mama, fuck her fat, call the motherfucking cops. Hit roccs, yeah, you know what? You know what. They told me like this. [Refrain x 2]."

Don't stop being you, don't stop being G. Egotistical, mystical, officially. Shuffle my feet to the beat with my heat in the stash. G in the bag with the C on the flag. (We some real Ogs baby. I was getting money in the 80's daily. Niggas like me don't never quit. And I still go hard on a bitch, ya bitch). You got to tell 'em what it is, don't play with the game. I love it when you call a bitch out of her name. Don't you dare try to save that ho. I know that you like her but you can't wife her. (I'm going on a tour 'round the world. Probably fuck a whole bunch of girls. Probably get a whole bunch of money, sho' can you save some for me?). Nah, but you can come and work for me. [Chorus]. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop at all. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop at all. [Verse 2: Snoop Dogg (Too $hort) ]. Don't stop being real, don't stop that rap. Don't stop showing homies how to shake that trap. I mean I seen so much but I'm still in touch with it. I don't stop 'cause I know y'all gon' fuck with it. (We keep going full speed ahead with this. Niggas ain't did the shit. Niggas ain't real as this. We came through and peeled his bitch so quick). From the 80's with a dope sack in my hand. To the 90's with a Dj and a microphone stand. Can't stop now, I'm in way too steep. Tech savvy with this cavy, come way too deep. Short dawg, Snoop Dogg, this for all my dogs. The ones who real in the streets, the ones who locked in the halls. Hall of fame with this game, legendary to y'all. Another 100 point game, now you can bury the ball. [Chorus]. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop at all. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop at all. [Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]. Don't stop getting lit with the shit I spit. I know you're down with the Dogg, I know you're fucking with this. Don't stop, won't stop, this is all I know. From the uprock to the crack rock in the bowl. Don't stop getting money, bring that shit back. Don't stop, fuck a cop for all the times I was jacked. Can't say much now 'cause I'm moving a crowd. I'm moving real weight, I mean hundreds of thous. Hundreds of pounds, green leaves. I made it out the motherfucking mean streets. And I still go back and touch the youth. I teach 'em how to ball and I teach 'em how to shoot. In the pursuit of my dreams, while recruiting my team. Teach 'em how to rise to the top just like cream. Remain supreme by any means. Badda bang, badda bing. [Chorus]. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop at all. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop at all. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop at all. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop it, don't stop. Don't stop at all"

downtown assassins,"INTRO:(*mobster Corleone talking*). VERSE ONE:(DAT NIGGA DAZ). Yeah. Vision 88 kilos of cocaine smack-dead in your face. The street value of that is what you dream to make. Run an illegal business,racketeerin. Smugglin,doin things from handin a gun,is what they fearin. Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit. Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick. Different locations,spots where it takes place. If you show them my money,your ass is gettin f-laid. There's four major games that run the city of G's. The violators,the Gambinos and the Corleones and me. The violators and Gambinos they run uptown. Me and my cousin Corleone we run downtown. Murder's an everyday thang in the city. Where you gotta plot chips,jag robberies and do in its. Tanadian Nay,the charge of the weapons. Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected. So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot. Buck em till they all drop,circle round the block. Let em have it as soon as they come out. Unload on their ass,commence to takin them out!. INTERLUDE:(DAZ talking). Throughout the streets of Long Beach. The streets was infected with drugs,dope pealers and addicts. Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young. youth behaviour is outrageous with crime. They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements. have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs. from coming into our country, but they can't. The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount. of which they make is more than 700 million dollars. Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion. VERSE TWO:(TRAY DEE). I had no choice or remorse for time for puttin it down. Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town. I been around since the Jumpstreet makin it pop. Young crook keepin hook,nigga,shakin the spot. Had to be a standout not to get ran out. Look for help,you help yourself cos there's no handout. Since the city Long Beach is only G's and hos. You hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes. Trust,bust,be aware and I ain't ya curse. Cos the niggas that I dared to (?agank?) the first. Think I might be deceased 'fore I reach my calling. As long as I'm haulin my heat I'm stallin. I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life. Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes. Don't speak on the creep,mo' fools is listenin. And war story glory ain't worth the riskin. Real niggas still get a mob like respect. If you represent ya set,till ya bite the deck. Who I be?I'm the Dee,nigga check the file. Under G you will see not to sweat my style. I'm takin em out!. INTERLUDE:(Corleone talking some more). VERSE THREE:(SNOOP DOGG). I come through blastin,me as a Downtown Assassin. Mashin,may they rest in peace in they caskets. Shoot em down in front of Hassans. Should've known from the gate,who's the baddest?. In my zone,Don Corleone wanted. For the murder of forty men. Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again. From the U-S-C,I shift ki's,a 120 plane rides. Multiplied by G's,87.3 million in a matter o'months. Big business and big dollars is all that I want. I blaze up to celebrate,new empire to make. Toast till we all die,till we burst and break. From knives to guns,from the rich to the slums. We ran outta dope,I don't think so son. While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park. From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark. From when I pick em off like darts. Stab em in they hearts. Make an example,what I said,ya end up dead. Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs. Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die. All I ever want is to be left alone. Me myself,me my dope,me and my chrome. Got paid by cops and judges,I budge when I buzz. I got the City of Long Beach goin crazy for drugs. OUTRO:(Corleone capping it off)."

No, Snoop can do what he wanna do. (I don't think so...). Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness. [Verse 1]. And there ain't no doubt about it. Regarded as the freshest, by the way that I live. All the songs that I did, and givin' back to the kids. I mean I done been everywhere that you wanna go. And poppin' on a stick like a pogo. My logo, is similar to the bat sign. Way up in the sky, When you wanna get high. Now look up, Now look up, I shook up the game. With the versatility, verbability, toungetwistagility.

freaky tales,"These are the tales, the freaky tales. These are the tales that I tell so well. These are the tales, the freaky tales. These are the tales that I tell so well. I met this girl, her name was Joan. She loved the way I rocked on the microphone. When I met Joan, I took her home. She was just like a doggie all on my bone. I met another girl, her name was Ann. All she wanted was to freak with a man. When I met Ann, I shook her hand. We ended up freakin by a garbage can. The next young freak, I met was Red. I took her to my house and she gave me head. She like blowin dicks, is all she said. We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed. There's another girl, her name is Sherry. You talk about sex and the girl acts scary. I heard she was freakin from my big brother Jerry. Took her to my crib and I popped that cherry. Young and tender, sweet Denise. Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast. I tell you homeboy if you get a piece. She'll only start talkin bout signin a lease. I met a young tender, her name is Lori. An X-Rated movie wouldn't tell her story. She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa. And just like Lori she's a real dick pleaser. My girlfriend's name, was Michelle. Her booty was bigger than the tail on a whale. When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well. Her pussy got hotter than the flames of Hell. I G'd this girl, her name was Tammi. I didn't wanna do it cause the bitch was ?flantly?. She had a best friend, her name was Janet. I pulled her to the side and I spit that game. I had a lot of freaks, in my lifespan. I freaked one night, with this girl named Pam. The very next day, I saw her with her man. One week passed, and I was in her again. I had an old tender, her name's Jeanine. She was thirty-eight and I was only seventeen. She likes to freak, she's just a fiend. It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans. I want a big freak, fat and sloppy. I kick on back, and watch the hoe just mop me. Two tons of fun, Big Mad Magenta. A country broad from Alabama. I met this freak, her name was Beth. Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death. I was tired as Hell, I was drippin sweat. but I was all up in her tryin to hold my breath. Bake, and, shake, ups. I met this freak in Vegas. She she said her name was Don-na.

(I hear ya Dogg). (It's a cold, cold thing!). (It's a cold thing!). (For real, hmm!). I got more niggas tryin to get at me than the President do sometimes. Niggas be tryin to get at me cos I be droppin funky rhymes. What the fuck is goin on? This rap game is made to make money. You niggas is taking the shit outta hand, actin' way too funny. Doin too much, y'know I see it from the get-go. What the fuck's goin on wit you niggas, y'all tryin to play a low pro. And tryin ta be hard and tryin ta be big willies or whatever they call it. I guess it's time for me to act just like an alcoholic. And step to the game, I'm a stumble in like I don't know. And if a nigga say somethin wrong, I'm takin off from the get-go. I ain't givin no room to try to get me first. Cos I done been bombed on before and I'ma tell you, man, that's the worst. Fifth in the world, but I'ma keep my thang together. Cos I'ma keep makin money and hope everything is still together. Havin papers, man, now what y'all niggas doin?. All y'all broke on the corner, drinkin your drink, wanna be doin what I'm. doin. But don't get mad and don't be tryin to play-hate. Cos, uhh, takin trips around state to state. Representin, uhh, what y'all wanna represent. But y'all can't represent it cos y'all got no dollars, no cents. I'm movin on, groovin on and I'm movin. Makin more moves than the average Cuban. Tryin ta get G's across the town, tryin ta make more hits. And tryin ta get my game tight and get at your bitch. Now if she wants to get with this, she gone come holla at a player, do'. Cos she know that Snoop Dogg is got that white Rolls Royce. And she wants to jump in, bring a friend. Cos everything is like alphabet, come on in. Come on in and bring a friend and you can come on back. Cos when you do, we gone be sippin on some Cognac. It's on me, I'm feelin good tonight. Cos I'ma do mines and I'ma keep everything tight. I ain't lettin nothin leak cos if thangs leak, then I'm get caught. And I can't get caught cos you know how they do it about that child support. Shit, bitches is cold on a nigga who ain't got his game tight. Gettin 18-point-5 percent, half your life. Shit, I love my baby boy and all. But I ain't gonna be payin no bitch, no no, no way Dogg. I'm too slick on my toes, I'm too tight. I'm guaranteed to get away from some shit like dat, ain't that right. Cos, uhh, when you play in this game you got to be the real player. You can't be no fake ass nigga talkin about you wanna be the man. Cos if you ain't with the game, the game ain't gonna be wit you. And I can put that on everything including you. Interlude: (Snoop talking). One of every five black males berfore the year 2000 will be detained or. deceased. No justice, no peace. Yeah the truth hurts, we scared to go to church. Look here, but don't cut it, gettin five points. Step back for a second, I'm puttin less than five to this joint. Hmm, if this is the bomb niggas gonna blow up like Atlanta at the Olympics. Niggas be trippin but I'll be pimpin. I don't be trippin off no nigga at all, no bitches. Just tryin to get money, I don't even be trippin off no switches. I used to like low-riders but now I like Eastsiders. I put it down wit me and make a hit maker, y'knowhatI'msayin?. I love the Lakers now cos now they got Shaq O'Neal. It's time to make a million dollars and that's for real. See we gone blow up and show up and throw up nuttin but Dogg Pound. Give it to ya ta put it down and we'll be round to your town. So just sit in your seats and wait til we come through. Until we do just keep smokin grey and blue. Or whatever you do just stay true to what you do. Cos we gone keep doin what the fuck we got to do. Now, follow me now and listen to the instructions. Cos the game's gonna get deep now, niggas is tryin ta creep. Tryin ta get up on game but they don't wanna be down with the PG. All of a sudden everybody wanna dis DP. Now, what we look like?. Makin y'all diss us, that ain't right. I should get upset but I'ma stay composed. Chill for a second, spit at some hos. Drinkin my drink, smokin my dank. Countin my bank, uhh that shit stank. Stanky bank is what I got cos I'ma keep it. And nah this ain't no motherfuckin secret. Interlude: (Snoop talking).

friends,"(feat. Kokane). [Kokane]. Life is much mo' precious. Than you'll think. Like a game'll make yo chips sink. It's so hard. Hard to trust a smile and face. When niggas got intentions already taking yo place. Keep my head up and stand tall. If I stumble, then I'll fall. Will you pick me up at all?. Will you pick me up at all?. I'm a keep it gangsta till my end. Cause some people do pretend. And ain't too many of us that we can call friends. That we can call friends. Ohhhhhhh. [Goldie Loc]. Now all I gotta do is keep my head up. And walk a straight line when fake friends won't mind. But I'm kind-hearted. And don't like being stepped on. If I wasn't real, I wouldn't be in this position. Like that, dogg, I got a whole lot to say. I'm by myself with my rhymes when we kick it all day. Lil' Jay used to say I'd never be nobody. But you know what I never do?. Smoke it off like Gotti. Five million dollar hits puttin in saxophones. Tray Deee & Snoop, we sound good on this microphone. I never threaten nobody to make it happen. Let me show you how we eat a full meal off this rappin'. But if I had a chance to give it back. I'd give it to the ones who helped me do that. Do that, straight from the heart. Eastside till I die. We ain't no contract friends, we doggs for life. [Tray Deee]. It's a trip how we Crip. Suppose the enemies still. With both sides ride causing plenty of tears. Insane's and 20's both from the same city. A bunch of down niggas and it ain't that many. Me, C, and the G can think back to the start. Homies chillin', getting high, shooting craps in the park. And having a heart. To get 'em up if it was beef. Head up like G's, take it out in the street. Hold ya own was the code that I growed to view. So I fucked with and stuck with a chosen few. But Snoop Dogg, you can call me, whatever the case. And homie that ain't nothing that the set could erase. You put me with the homie, Goldie, though we never had spoke. A Insane with a 20, now we hell of a close. And y'all kids, my kids, so we family now. Cause I could never see you doing bad without. And that's real. [Kokane]. Life is much mo' precious. Than you'll think. Like a game'll make yo chips sink. It's so hard. Hard to trust a smile and face. When niggas got intentions already taking yo place. Keep my head up and stand tall.

You better have a spot up in town my nigga. Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga. Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat. Grease strikes you out with no get back. Wishing for a steak eatin on a Kit Kat. And your bitch ain't shit the little homie hit that. Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me. Let's go get a stick nigga dip with me. We can ride on some niggas for nuthin at all. Even if we cool with 'em, fuck 'em let's go get 'em. LBC in this muthafucka cuz. I had to show these niggas what time it was. We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns. We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves. Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip. Or better yet, strapped a clip. To a muthafuckin' nine millimeter for heater. And put the ride down out of G two seater. You need a nigga like me to get your game like that. Young nigga, you could get a smack for that. I'm that nigga who brought the afro back. And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack. Before I came out niggas was wearing slack. I brought the curl back and the golf hat. The black poker sack and this skandelous raps. The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks. I brought snaps to the game nigga. Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga. S-N double O-P fa sho. I do my thang way cut throat on the downlow. Oh once upon a time in the LBC. There lived a OG from the DPG. And all the little kids looked up to him. All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him. But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel. And all they hated on him because he was way to real. I don't know why but he's just so fly. But I gotta end this story by saying goodnight."

We do it Doggystyle, all the while we do it Doggystyle. Yo motherfuckin hoes!!!. He fucked the fleas off a bitch. He shaked the ticks off his dick. And in the booty, he buries his motherfuckin bone.

Will I quit it, I'm comitted til the day I drop. Slangin rocks, sprayin shots, sayin fuck the cops. Locked up in the Chevy and my switches is hot. Gave em pain as I swang on the bitches I sopt. Bandanna on the antenna swangin and ridin. Eastsidin, ghetto life is invitin. [Snoop Dogg]. Me and my brother had to walk to school. I used to get him he downposed for joe cool. A couple of dickies, with some quarter sacks. Damn cuz I can't believe my kinfolk gave me that. Had a nigga lookin G'd up. With the scarf on my head, stealin sheets on my bed. I seen baloney sandwiches without no motherfuckin bread. I stole a pack of chips with the big homie Fred. Now we sippin on some kool aid. I got suspended from school for cussin out the teacher's aid. And now I'm bout to get a whoopin, but you know I'm steady woofin. On the side where they ride the most. Eastside is the beach, westside is the coast.

It remains the same in the year you live in, see. Cos if I pull out some heat, nigga, you'll go kick in. And that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school. When it's time to duel, you get two men. Two heaters, one street, one clock. and when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop. If you're quick on the draw you're gon' see the morgue. but if you're too slow. I catch you on the downlow (Oh no). Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit's real. I ain't no John Wayne, these niggas gangbang. The Four Horsemen, that's the click I'm wit. You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers. Yeah, we're on a mission ta Kansas, slippin thru Texas. We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes. bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg. Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses. The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen. Searchin for this location on the map. The gold rush, baby, got ta have it (I gots ta have it). It feels just like it's 1865. and a trigger look-a-day is how I ride. (Kurupt). On and on and on it's more strange. Time to heat, shootin range. Quick with the heat on their hip. Young Jesse James come to test your aim. I seen you at th e Wild Horny Corral. I hearda ya name. Tha forcify, nigga you ain't never lie. Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride. From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach. My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts. The off-the-rocker roller coaster. On a six-shooter holster. with DPG on every Wanted poster. Let me think about which bank to gank. which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank. I want all the shit you got in stacks. attached to this skirt in the corner. so I snatched the bitch in the back. The Dogg in me feels for the lust. but the hogg in me makes me wanna bust. Back to the drawin down board. Nowadays we drawn down more. To survive thru all the round wards. Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene. or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen. I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it. With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket. Like that cock back. quick to pull my strap. Just to put the Horsemen on the map. (The gold rush). (???? from LBC Crew). Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots. I got the six shots for all the plans and plots. I gots lots o' cash stashed in money bags. Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags. I got stacks so my stacks excell. Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells. I'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse. A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o' course. It ain't no stoppin young Josey. Box all the nosey. Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hos be. Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell. Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele. Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet. Divide between my homies and ride the sunset. (Bad Azz from LBC Crew). Two sacks o' money from the train heist. They ain't even counted it up. just mounted it up. Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster. Pass thru a run-down town whose walls hold my poster. Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat. so I gotta have what I can get. Heard word about the gold rush and headed West. on my white horsey with three straps in my napsack. Giddy up, the next town I rode thru. I had to threaten to blow their city up. Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west. sell us some beads and hail us some weed. He offered me a toke. he didn't have a 20 he had they beads-pipe smoke. I almost choked. Break him for the get, right, I'm off into the sunset. tryin ta reach my destiny fast. It's these two bags o' cash. 44's cocked I ain't makin no mo' stops. till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot. I slid off my boots, counted my loot. Five minutes after the strike of midnight. I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight. (At the gold rush, at the gold rush. at the gold rush, at the gold rush. at the, at the, at the)."

And ain't no question we come steppin' straight to get in your shit. So why you actin' like a bitch? Puttin' your business on wax. When we could scrap or slap a clip, if you wanted to crack. See in the pen we got a name for niggas runnin' they yap. Sale soldiers, roll 'em up with somethin' up in they back. Handles ours, battle scars, Shackles, guards and all. And we the last niggas standin' once they start to fall. Make the call, or fuck it, just kick off the brawl. Cuz I'm ridin' with my doggs, win, lose, or draw. Dogg pound insane, neighborhood twenty gangin' it. And every gangsta that I hang with down to bang. Full time pull mines and I gots to bust. Fuck a pass, when I mash, anybody get touched. So make my name taste just like a dick in your mouth. And watch the way you on my nuts when you spittin' it out. Dogghouse. Repeat Bridge. Chorus 1/4X. [Sylk E. Fine]. You got a muthafuckin' problem with my niggas then you got one with me. It's the S to the Y, the L, just drop three keys. As I flee, to the homie L.T.'s, to make the magic.

Therefore them bitches who talk that shit. Be them bitches that's gettin' they ass beat. [Snoop Dogg]. Now don't come round here fuckin' with us. Cuz on the real homeboy, we'll be fuckin' you up.

Rule number one, you can't trust no ho. Now you can get caught up in the mix real fast. The ho gon' slip away and get away with all your cash. You got to stay upon your toes when it come to hos. I bust a brand new ho in every video. That's on the Pound and the Row when the wind blow. I pass a ho to my kinfolk. and then smoke. She say she was no groupie, coochie lookin juicy. She say she never ate a dick before but she gon' do me. Right before she do me, I blaze up a lupi. then turn on some Snoopy and, uhh, heat up jacuzzi. and later on I might just turn on a movie. so you can regroupie and redo me just for Snoopy. Chorus to fade. Outro: Warren G. There's roaches and shit in this motherfucker in here. I forgot about this."

hoop dreams (he got game),"Man I had a crazy crazy dream dogg.. I had a dream I was in the NBA straight playin basketball.. NBA straight getting my ball on dogg.. Can you imagine?. Snoop Dogg in the NBA?. Imagine that, Hoop Doggy Dogg.. Yea straight ballin.. You know I'm a ball anyway so why not.. Let me get my ball on.. If I could play in the NBA. I would be that six-four all day shootin that trey. I dribbled to the outside and passed it to Shaq. they double teamed on him so he passed it back. Look at the 3 but I don't take the shot. cause I think I'm cold and I aint trying to get hot. I'm feelin bionic, we playing the Sonics. And I'm sticking Gary Payton so you know I'm ball hatin. Bang on Vin Baker cause real Lakers really don't care yea yea. Next stop in the court on Damon toast Stouda and my homeboy J.R. Rider. Minnesota Timberwolves, we cut 'em down. Hakeem Olajuwon and Scottie Pippen, we shut 'em down. The Twin Towers, Dave and Duncan. 20 in the paint fool you get's nothing. On a four game roll sweep, beep beep. We beat the Bulls and we rocked the Heat. And we traded for a few players, some Pacers. Miller and Mullin and now they Lakers. We cant be beat now, we on a 27 game win streak now, bow wow. When it all started from a dream. I'm playin point guard on my favorite team (Lakers). I got the big perm, doing interviews with Chick Herm. At Stu Lance, we do a dance. When it rains poppin shampane. Basketball yes yall thats the game. Two years ago a friend of mine. Ask me to glide from the free throw line. So I took the ball, and as I made the hoop. Everybody jumped up and they said ""Go Snoop"". And my career jumped off into the fast lane. My rookie season I made my first all star game. Double G like George Gervin, thats what the call me cause I'm so ice. Ballin cause that's my life, I balls all day, and I balls all night. They call me Snoop Dogg and everybody know I love to hustle and ball. The season gettin tragic we lost to the Magic. and the word is that Rodman done had it. So I guess it on a young homie, the great number 8, Mr. Koby. Give him the ball dogg he ready. We got to play Charlotte tonight, I'm stickin Eddie. Remember all the good times that we had. Cuz dont trip to long cause tommorow we play the Jazz. Then it on to play the Denver Nuggets. The homeboy Nick they traded, but damn I still love 'em. Keep a picture of 'em on the wall next to Dr. J. Meach, I love basketball. Allen Iverson on the fly boy he hard to stick. C Webb comin through with a quick pick. The NBA Saturday mornings hey or maybe on a Sunday. We in the playoffs so stay off the court. This aint no game, this a sport. And we in it to win it, we ballin, No Limit. Remember this. When I grow up on wanted to be a point guard playing on NBC. With Herb and Suge or Pistol Pete or World B. Free givin dap to me. Givin up my dues with converse shoes. And tellin all the kids to stay in school. This is true and your dreams can come true. if it happen to me, it can happen to you. That's for all the NBA players that dream of being a rapper.. I'm a rapper that dreams of being a NBA player and I'm a baller.. Let's bounce up out of here man.."

Yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all inside this R&G. Rhythm & Gangsta: The Masterpiece. Such a, heavenly experience. Alchemist, break it down for me nephew. Let me preach to 'em one time, chuuch. [Snoop Dogg]. In the beginning. I Love To Give You Light Snoop Dogg as a child I was chosen. Though not knowin the reason while still my eyes opened. Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog. Love was given to all, outside livin the ball. As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message. to reach teachin the masses, I wrote my first passage. It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap. I'm young, livin in the city of jackers and gangbangin. and dope dealin, cold feelin to be a product of niggaz around you. Once you get on top they down you. But the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin. I found myself grindin on the streets quite often. With a blue rag, bangin the dub, fo'-fifth coffin. At the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the Eastside. Where most of the big homies had a glock and flossed the G-ride. Niggaz throwin up hands but it wasn't no peace signs. Never fo' a second did I think to let my light shine. Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messin up. Disrespectin my home, not carin 'bout what moms what sayin. And then I found out that mom wasn't playin. Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn't understand. Get my life right, step it up, nigga be a man. Never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with. Through the stripes still gotta shine my light. I've grown, to comprehend the game; my name is Big Snoop Boss Dogg. Just a block and a phone call away. I've reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist. I'm preachin just what I practice. To each and all, I got a word from the Beach to acros the globe. Man woman young and old. Don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite. Many circumstances Doggy gon' shine my light cause I love you. [singers - repeat in background of Outro w/ ad libs]. (I love, to give you light). [Outro: Minister]. And the people that is locked up, locked down. And the people that's locked dowwwwwn. Also God, should purchase the new, Escalade.

i miss that bitch,"(feat. E. White). [Snoop]. This one right here is dedicated to a lot of famous players out there. That might have been in love before. I know some of you might not think gangstas fall in love (I miss that bitch). But uh, it's true. If you been in love like I been in love before, you know. It's hard to get with somebody once they gone (I miss that bitch). It's hard to replace that special someone. When they just up and you know. Dip dive and so socialize. And what we gon do right here (I miss that bitch). We go'n kick something over this HiTek beat right here. For all the players that lost somebody special. And wonder where she at. E. White kick that shit (I miss that bitch). [E. White]. I got my eyes wide open. The whole time I'm holding on to hope with you on my mind. It's been a while child, I'm getting down with Dogg. I bet my name all around your wall. Perhaps I went to jail. That left us out of touch. Shoulda shot some mail or something. Ain't no telling where she at now. I be God damn. Baby I really wanna see what you got now. I'm all grown up with my shit together. I don't know if I'mma see you ever. I got a woman and shit,but I must admit this. You at the top of my list. Unforgetable. Fuck with them nigga do. I still miss, there aint no getting rid of you. But in the mean time I'mma get with cha. Until I get somebody with your hook up Imma hit ya. [Chorus]. I miss that bitch. She was a pot of gold. Her body was cold. I don't know where you went. Where did you go (I miss that bitch). Shopping around looking around. I'm try to see. Where could you be. How could you do this to me (I miss that bitch). [Snoop]. My momma got mad. I was young when I hooked up with her. One hit and I couldn't stop trippin. A long lasting relationship. Pass you around, and let my niggas take a hit. I used to break you down just to roll you up. You the real, you never will slow me up. And you was always on my mind. Say no more. I still miss you at times. All of a sudden you lost my interest. I packed it up and set about my business. You used to have a hold on me. Sometimes to the point that they said you controlled me. I kept going to jail and all that. Get out, fuck with you again, I'm right back. I guess I had to learn the hard way baby. I'm leaving you alone cause you driving me crazy (I miss that bitch). [Chorus]. Ohhhhh. Mary, mary, mary. Quite contrary. Ohhhhh. Every time I think about that girl. Make a nigga wanna have a wet dream. Release some steam. ohhhhhh, ohhhhhhh, ohhhhhh. I miss that bitch."

i will survive,"[Technic]. By dawn's early light. I shine brighter than the stars in the night. I'm bout ready for a fight. Come through and I've consumed enough juice. To cut loose and throw a mike to the moon. Since I'm the sun. I'll make you one, it's all for fun. I'm torching hot and all the same. From playing war games with Saddam Hussein. Now who's sane? I'm insane. My membrane's on cold grown. The tempature's rising, fry the cells in your dome. It might be on. And if you think so, you know me. It's tech the pony. The Doggfather's little homey. [Snoop Doggy Dogg]. Ain't that something. How I got little homeys now. I remember when I was just a little bow wow. Writing for my rep. Calling fore I step. Now I put niggas in the game just to stay on deck. High profile but my style low pro. Top dogg on the row, Doggystyle CEO. And I blow the best indo. That you know of. So when I'm in your town. Dip down, and show love. You know what? What's up. Shit, I'm feeling good now. You better come and get me before I fall into a freestyle. [Technic]. They say what's a rapper. Well nigga, what's an emcee. If they don't got the skills, then they don't roll with me. Ain't that the truth. I'm bulletproof off the roof. I got a mic and a fix. That'll jack you for your chips. I'm out for rep. But how long will it last. I'm coming up quick, cause broke niggas need cash. At last, I'm at the top so I maintain now. Gotta bang now. Nigga, this Doggystle. [Snoop Doggy Dogg]. All she ever wanted was a small time dub thang. Got my homey caught up in the coke game, dope game. He so sprung, on top of that he young. He's only thirteen years old and the world's so cold. He never took the time out to fall down on his knees. Until he fucked his gee, got some keys. Now they enemies. The niggas he grew up with. They put him in the game. Now they bout to take him out the game. Man, it's a shame, but you know how that shit go. That's life in the fast lane, so that's where I roll Soop. [Soopafly]. I'd rather not get shot. I'd rather sit in the studio and rock spots. Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, we're one big family. It's all DPG (DPG). I got a gee on the best bomb money can buy. I ain't out for no homey's sides, I'm out to survive. Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, one big family. It's all DPG (DPG). [Technic]. Niggas and hoes will try to get you twisted. But I'm unlisted in the books. You base your life on that, you might get your life took. Put me in the game, I'm riding hard till I win. Serve a crew, kill a few niggas till the end. I mean, I'm a fiend for superior green. And all my life I got advice from a superior team. I gotta stay away from the cash see. Don't get blasted. Tell my kids how I lasted. My crew's mafiosos. So my philoso-. Phy is to gee till the day I D-I-E."

imagine,"Imagine. Dr. Dre. Imagine it never happened. Imagine no rappin’. Imagine niggas trapped. Imagining having action. Imagine how these niggas could react. And if we never got this shit crackin’. Imagine life so hard. You can’t imagine. It’s like living in the City of God. You feel me. Imagine life on the yard. Or trying to get that dollar. On some shitty ass job. Imagine Biggie with his son. Or imagine Pac getting called Pop by one. Imagine a mother struggling. Dealing with a system. That don’t give a fuck. About who shot her son. Imagine life where you can’t win. When you get out the ghetto. And go right to the pen. When you get out the pen. You go right to the gin. So if get back to the streets. You go right back in. Imagine Russell still struggling. No Def Jam. Just another nigga hustlin’. And ain’t no rocks on dem fellas. Just rocks on them dealers. Just trying to keep it bubblin. Imagine niggas just stuck. From the east to the west coast. Everybody’s fucked up. I can’t imagine no less. But it don’t take imagination. To know niggas been blessed. With Hip Hop. Snoop. Imagine a world. Where most black men die young. Forced to gang bang. Or sell dope and crack to the young. Yeah, well that’s where we hail from. The slum. Where most folks ain’t welcome. So you dog or you loc. Smoke coke or you sell some. Imagine growing up feeling country. Imagine not understanding. Why you got it the worst. Now try to imagine my tears. Imagine your people being in slavery. For a hundred years. And imagine you never knew it. Imagine how bad since then. That you would have been going through it. Imagine if rap wasn’t out yet. Imagine having all this pain. Built up, with no outlet. Imagine how many lives would be ruined. If it wasn’t for hip hop. Imagine what we’d all be doing. Imagine me sitting on a porch or a stool. Just bullshitting and never being called Snoop. Imagine if the government. Was hoping for good. Imagine if they never put. Dope in the hood. I mean imagine if they let us. Mold the youth. Imagine if these mother fuckers. Just told the truth. Imagine if they wasn’t haters. Imagine what would rap be. If we wasn’t the originators. Now let your imagination run away. Imagine life without hip hop. Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre"

Niggaz watchin Soul Train and I wouldn't turn it back (man fuck y'all). Never caught slippin, always on strap. And now I'm back in the hole with no motherfuckin getback. Sit back and contemplate, and think about baby. And hope she don't get caught up in the world that's so crazy. But while I'm up in Wayside, and she off in college. She gettin a little mo' than a schoolgirl knowledge. Cause gangsta-ass niggaz go to school nowadays. I tried to make you wait, but I can't change yo' ways. She fell in love with the local G.

First step, to collect a nigga's bread and meat. The squares asleep. But all the hogs out on the prowl. Blocks get locked down like they off a child. Time to eat up off the streets full of fiends and hypes. Checking cream off ecstasy to the green and white. Dub sacks, the drugs packed up in kilo bricks. Getcha slang on, bang on, and keep yo chips. Baller had this, cause the savage beast did need to floss. So the hard, Bogard, and we squeezed it soft. Late night, the game tight, went up a notch or two. With fake vice, playin nice, steady watching you. Impossible, the clock when you.. ain't overtiming. The vivrant ways for crimes on the grind and start shining. 9 to 5 is midnight to sunrising. Occupation gangsta committed to thug life. [Kokane]. On a late night... That's the time we gone ride. Nigga, it's do or die. Late night. We ain't checking for names. When the hollow points fly.

Throw 'em in the ocean. Jack the fo' up two times. And young nigga, keep coastin'. Turn on the DVD and watch myself on TV. It's killings after killings but they don't know it's me.

Please believe, that I'm a lil' crazy motherfucker. Turned out by the Spillman's, Gaithen's, and Ruckas. [Kokane]. On a late night... That's the time that we gone move a gang away. Late night. They call me Chef Boyardee, pushin' up some cakes. On a late night... Deeper and deeper. I bang these streets for all so long. Late night. Deeper and deeper.

It ain't nuttin like the street life. Betta be strapped wit yo clip, cuz ain't no fist fight. So I guess I gots ta handle mine. Since I did the crime, I gots ta do my time. Chorus:. Lil' ghetto boy.

Now, I'm 'trolling the dove, sitting on swoll. 27 years old, off on parole, stroll. I'm back up on my feet wit my mind on the money. That I'm making as soon as I touch the street. Things done changed but it's alright. Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right. But it ain't no thing to me. 'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed O.G.. The little homies from the hood wit grip. Are the ones I get wit 'cause I'm down respect trip. Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what'cha wanna do. Didn't know we had a 22. Straight sitting behind his back. I'm grab his pockets and then I heard six caps. I fell to the ground wit blood on my hands. I didn't understand. How a nigga so young could bust a cap. I use to be the same way back. I guess that's what I get (for what). For trying to jack them little homies for they bread. Chorus. Verse Three: Snoop Doggy Dogg. Something for the real OG's to get wit. Some facts, made our made, now you wanna run and play. Like every single day, really doe. You know me, I'm the smooth macadamien, gaming them for my homie. No need to be uncalm if you pack right. And learning just enuff to keep your sack right. Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo'. Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo'. Seven young G's but they serve down. In a jeep ride, east side what they swerve now. Not thinking about what's really going on. Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone. I spent 4 years in the county wit nutting but convicts around me. But now I'm back at the pound. And we expose ways for the youth to survive. Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right. So make all them ends you can make. 'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out. So ain't no need for your mama to trip. 'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clocking your grip. Chorus."

So listen close, to what we say. Because this types of shit happens every-day. I woke up around 10 o'clock in the mornin. I gave myself a strech up, a mornin yawn and. went to the bathroom to wash up. I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup. and said um ""Mirror mirror, on, the wall. Who is the top Dogg of them all?"". There was a rubble dubble, five minutes it lasted. The mirror said, ""You are you conceited bastard"". Well that's true, that's why we never have no beef. So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf. Used Oil of Olay, cuz my skin gets pale. And then I got the file, for my fingernails. I'm true to the style on my behalf. I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath. Clean, dry, was my body and hair. I threw on my brand new Doggy underwear. for all the bitches I might take home. I got the Johnson baby powder and Cool Water cologne. Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks. Threw on my white sox, with my all blue chucks. Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no. I went back in, I forgot my indo. Then I dilly [dally] I ran through an [alley]. I bumped into this smoker named [Sally] from the [Valley]. This was a girl playin hard to get. So I said ""What's wrong?"" cuz she looked upset. She said um. It's all because of you, i'm feelin sad and blue. You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days. I love you so, how much you'll never know. Cause you took your dope away from me. A-huh, a-huh, ahuh. Damn, now what was I to do. She's cryin over me and she was feelin blue. I said, ""Um, don't cry, dry your eye. And here comes your mother with those two little guys"". Her mean mother steps then says to me ""Hi!!"". Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye. Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet. Slammed the child on the hard concrete. The bitch was strong, the kids was gone. Somethin was wrong I said, ""What was goin on?"". I tried to break up, I said, ""Stop it, just leave her!"". She said, ""If I can't smoke none, she can't either!"". She grabbed my closely by my socks. So I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks. But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick. They started cryin on my shoes and grabbin my dick. and sayin..... .

mac bible chapter 211 verse 20-21,"(feat. Mac Minista). [Mac Minista]. There's a scripture in the Mac Bible that says. 'He that trusts a ho, shall surely be broke'. 'Pressure busts a pipe that make water run uphill'. Alotta you niggas talk that shit. But half you niggas ain't real. Will the real niggas stand up and be counted. Or lay down and be mounted. Cuz this game is not a playground, it's a classroom. It's not a holiday, but an educational process. And experience is your greatest teacher. So listen to the gangsta mack preacher. Macks do what they want, bustas do the best that they can. From half of a gangstas start, is a sucka's dream. In the game God said, that he would send a G. With the street ethnics and G-Code. With the gangsta Ten Commandments. And the gangsta Ten Commandments shall read:. 'Thou shall kill a snitch'. 'Thou shall check a bitch'. 'Thou shall charge a ho'. 'Thou shall send a sucker'. 'Thou shall respect the G'. 'Thou shall pack that steel'. 'Thou shall keep it real'. 'Thou shall flex his G's'. 'Thou shall stack his green'. 'Thou shall stay true to his game'. See I'm a gangsta, not a prankster. I don't pull rabbits out of my hat. But I will pull a strap from behind my back. Now how 'bout that!."

miss everything,"(Intro). Guten Tag! Ich liebe dich auch. Ich can't find on sis sing. Oh, mein God, ich love a conna, sing con me. Ich swear to God, dizzy und busted. (Verse). You know my story, I did a lot of ballin'. Been around the world, a lot of girls call it. A lot of pennies fallin' out the air and on the stage. If my label's a book, you couldn't miss a page. But none of that really matter when I cut my eyes and roll. See 'em pass by, I nearly dropped my phone. I'm like Snoopie Bree, cush er'where I go. I couldn't think straight, pimping was all alone. Should have seen her walk like a model do. If this was twitter, I would follow you. Open your (?) let doggy take yo hand. I'm seeing weddin' rings, call Diddy, lets make the plans. She got me high, I don't wanna leave. I see her walk best, but she's something to see. And now I'm on the flame, feelin' so ashamed. I didn't catch her name, I call 'er Miss Everything. (Hook). Tell me, have ya seen her (Seen her). Got something, pretty face and big brown eyes. Smile many ways that the floor gon' struggle (Struggle). Make the ground pile up (?). I keep runnin' the tune at her. But the numbers neva have exchanged. Everytime, every city, Miss Everything. Miss Everything. (Verse). You know my story, I watched a lot of crowd. Sold millions of records, I love my fans so loud. I got a thousand cars and all the perks of being. A real superstar, I live super-far. But none of that really matters when I cut my eyes in Spain. She walked in to me, like you did yo thang. And that Spanish accent, the one I love so much. She look like an angel, one I wanted to touch. I blink my eye for a second and then she disappear. When I see that pretty woman, I felt like Richard Gere. Ball on, ain't neva been one of that watch and pass. Unless we in a room, and I leave and they watch that ass. But baby smth else, somehow I didn't speak. I been here so long, maybe I reached my peak. And now I'm in the plane, fellin' total shame. I didn't catch her name, I call 'er Miss Everything. (Hook). Tell me, have ya seen her (Seen her). Got something, pretty face and big brown eyes. Smile many ways that the floor gon' struggle (Struggle). Make the ground pile up (?).

A lot of gold diggers, Luda' call 'em ""goes"". I don't call 'em back, and that's just how it goes. Most people call me Snoopy, or S to double O. But none of that really matters when I was in Ny. I had a show at the Guard, you know, up at Corse. That's when I seen 'er, from the distance, she smile at (?). Now, everything I learned in the game told me she chose. And I don't miss a beat, this time I gotta speak. She look magnificent, like smth to eat. Ergo, I can't let her go, I made my way through the crowd. Lets get outta here, head off for Lee Child (?). A lot of stars in place, Doggy set the mood. I'm like ""I like yo style"", she's like ""I like yours too"". Before I hit this plane, I gotta know yo name. She smiled as if she came, call me Miss Everything. (Hook). Tell me, have ya seen her (Seen her). Got something, pretty face and big brown eyes. Smile many ways that the floor gon' struggle (Struggle). Make the ground pile up (?). I keep runnin' the tune at her. But the numbers neva have exchanged. Everytime, every city, Miss Everything. Miss Everything"

I don't know black on black, black for black. But blacks take off on blacks. Blacks need to realize and wake up. And see we all one color, all one game. You my sister, you my brother. So you my daddy, or you my mother. I don't know but I know we all realated. And if we stay down there's no way that they can fade it. But that's just a game peice from me to y'all. But if black on black gone continue to brawl. Then black gone fall, then black knah. Y'all better wake up and check out the black Dogg. [Male singer]. So Snoop Dogg speak the real. It don't even make a difference if it got matching sho'real. [Snoop Dogg]. Uh, its like that. then your black, they out for ya stack. And its a fact, when your black, ya can't come back.

my own way (feat. mr.porter),"(Snoop Dogg). Bank accounts, big cars. Living good like a movie star. My mama house ain't in the hood no more. I moved her out to Saint Louis Opispo.

I was once shot, your boy want me now. Went to the station that, nigga straight point me out. So I'mma lay away and spray away. At this time I think it's best to just stay away. (Mr. Porter). They say I am a fool. Cause I like to do my things my own way. I gotta couple strikes against me. One more and I am on my way. I ain't got time to hang around. In the hood like I was used to do. I gotta get my bread, keep my head. It's either go to jail or get this money instead. (Snoop Dogg). Separate, elevate. Concentrate, dominate, innovate. Try to be the flyest me. And every other homie tell a lie to me. I need a deal, I need some stones. I need some beats, Dogg, I need a loan. Help me out, throw me some cash. If I got it, you got it. You ain't got to ask. But on the real - or is it lately?. A lot of homies tried to implicate me. They say I changed; is it the fame?. If I throw it to you then charge it to the game. Money fold: overload.

never leave me alone,"Chorus(Nate):. Never Leave me alone (never leave me alone). Leave me alone (never leave me alone). never leave me alone (Never leave me aloooone). leave me alone (Never leave me alone). Never leave Me alone. Verse 1 (Nate Dogg):. They tell me that temptation..... ooh, is very hard to resist. You tell me that you want me..... I tried to hide my feelings, D-O-G's. ain't supposed to feel like this. You can call it what you want to..... But I don't even know what it is. You've got me singin' in the morning..... you bring me breakfast in my bed. and when it hurts you rub my head. I'll ask you one time only..... baby, won't you be there when it's hectic. When I don't have a hit record (Never leave me alone). Chorus. Verse 2 (Nate Dogg):. I've traveled so many places....I've seen so many faces. There were times I didn't think I'd make it through (alone). I went through so many phases....that got me so many cases. Three strikes you're gonna' then what you gonna do. I guess I'll call my lady....and tell her to kiss my baby. They tell me that crime is all I know how to do. Tell him his daddy's sorry....let him know all about me. There's one more thing I'd really like for you to do. Chorus. Verse 3 (Snoop Dogg). Somebody was naughty when they snitched on me. And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century. I'm mobbin' through the county mainline. back in 9500 just tryin' to handle mine. Spittin' game at the homies about the good ol' days. As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to Chino. I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo. And my nigga Spanky too. It's true that the dirt I did from an O.G. to a snotty nose kid. Got me caught up in the rapture like maze days gone by. And real G's gon cry. But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky. And hope my baby boo ain't fuckin niggas on the outside. But what's the chance it ain't crackin. If I was out and she was in I'd probably be mackin. I can't lie. So I say I would now my girl in a world of playahood. A playa should show a nigga love and look our. But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out. So keep away better yet stay away. And hope I get out one day, OK. But if I don't I guess this is home. My girl is trippin she got a block on the phone"

It's like the lights of midnight. On New Year's Eve. I do believe. On New Year's Eve. We can live forever. 11:59 and not a second later. She's stayin' in the mix like a crossfader. It's about to go down. No elevator. Live for the moment. Love in the air. She got me feeling like. I don't wanna be your player. Real talk. So I don't wanna be unfair. Now watch the apple drop. And celebrate the year. I see you shinin' away. From over there. And all the other girls. No, they don't compare. I whisper something bond to you. All up in your ear. I infiltrate your mind. And then I penetrate her. I get it crackin' baby. Call me the macdaddy lady. [Chorus]. We're having a good day. Let's make it a great night. I'm longing to see you. And tell you so tight.

Grab a glass. Make a toast to the good life. Recorded line, so what?. It will pass the time. Leather seats in the back of a Phantom ride. You stay on my mind so I had to make you mine. Master... for a master mind. My special lady. Only one of a kind. I never seen it comin'. I guess love is blind. New Year's, watching the city come to life. I must say girl. You're looking right. Your hair did, nails did. Dress fitting tight. I think I just might. Says here's the one I like. See we can look forever girl. Let's be... tonight. [Chorus]. We're having a good day. Let's make it a great night. I'm longing to see you. And tell you so tight. My special lady. You're one of a kind. And every time I see you shine. It's like the lights of midnight. On New Year's Eve. And I do believe. On New Year's Eve. We can make it. We can live forever"
nigga 4 life,"[Bad Azz]. We confined to these wordly ways, it's unchanging. The money makes, murder the kids, and gangbangin. The stock market crashed, they watchin my black ass. You pop em for fast cash so we dies over dollars. Get wise hold the knowledge, we rides know the choices. The key to the future, the devil he wanna shoot ya. Fuck em they call us niggs I'm tryin to make a livin. Do some touchin, you know I'm pretty good with the bustin. Trustin nothin you can buy if your money in discretion. We'll beat you and car jacks and leave you wit a concussion. We the gang, we mash and blast and maintain. Still the same, just fuckin wit a brand new thang. Bang, bang, take that, nigga 'fore we skirt out. Aint gotta say shit already put the word out. Ya heard how the thang goes down around us. We playas, so haters can't clown around us. On point, big fat blunts and joints. And get drunk, this cold world, they aint givin a fuck. About you livin let alone you livin it up. Niggas is stuck, I'm tryin to keep my head above water. Not stressed about dyin for a quarter in a shorter. My time get the heart of my rhymes, get a nigga get better with time. And wonderin how I'm goin by, can't help it in the heat of the. Heartless hood, it's all good. CHORUS: Snoop Dogg. You's a nigga when you born, a nigga when you dyin. Nigga quit lyin you's a nigga for life. You's a nigga when you ridin, a nigga when you sidin. Nigga quit tryin you's a nigga for life. You can paint your face and change your nose and buy new clothes. But you know what.... You cant change who the fuck you are. You's a motherfucking nigga for life. [Goldie Loc]. It's all sowed up, in the LBC. Bitches breakin bread when they see the lil ass gee. I keeps my finga on the trigga cuz I'm down for this bangin shit. Quick to do it for the cause bitch I smash for my dogs. So don't get close to my nine. Cuz if you do you in store to see your nigga do the crime. Sirens goin off, niggas bowin down. Now you know about to rip gut fools ready to clown. Nigga fuck you bitches, and you hoes and you sluts. You tricks don't know what the fuck's up. On the eastside we ride, nigga 24 / 9. Tryin to keep my hands on somethin nigga at all times. Ready for war now that my pockets got bigger. You other fools die when I ride for my niggas. Cuss, bust, and fuss and kick up dust. What you laughin at nigga don't get your bitch ass rushed. CHORUS. [Tray Deee]. As a child I was wild as fuck, and down to dump. And kept a sawed off brown to pump. And my reputation never takin time to thank. Role models, holdin bottles, as we ride and drink. Livin right and plottin how to come up off the bottom. Black stockings in our pockets and I pocket profits. Fuck a school, I tuck a tool and start steppin. First lesson, aint no question, you gotta have protection. Sheets on the streets showin niggas defeats. And most beef don't cease 'til the trigga release. Livin hard, givin scars, gettin noise from hustlin. Slangin gangbangin run a game in musslin. Trustin nothin, sayin fuck it is the slogan. Everywhere we go we off the chronic and the potion. >From the ocean to the city to the valley to the bay. Niggas on the mission for the cabbage every day. Cutthroats, gunsmoke, dope and hoes. What controls niggas souls on the streets I roll. Bold letters think the gangs where I bang is at. Saints, Cowboys, Steelers and Raider hats. Though I know we all the same no matter what we claim. If you a nigga you a nigga and that aint gon change. We love Martin Luther King but respected Malcolm. Cuz he didn't give a fuck about the outcome. CHORUS 2X."
no evil,"[Hook]. I'm so fly, like an eagle. Live my life, so illegal. We gon ride, at your peoples. See no evil I, we do or die. [Snoop Dogg]. When we niggaz, ever learn. That time is money, and money gets your ass burned. Learn from the niggaz that done it, before I had a chance. You know the ones, with the Chuck's and the khaki pants. Use to tell me all the time, bang lil' man. Took your advice, now my life is a paradise. Half of it, ghetto fabulous. Established, since 1992. [Hook - 2x]. [Trae]. Make way for the Dirty South representer, who next to be. I'm from the H, where these niggaz'll hide ya under the streets. I remember coming up, from on the corner with thugs. The only love that they had, was lost and scattered with slugs. Never ever getting caught slipping, I'm packing my chrome. Come at me wrong, I'll have these niggaz packing your dome. Asshole By Nature, bitch better give me fifty feet. 'Fore my thugs click up, and hit your block fifty deep. [Yung Redd]. I use to sit back, let them old niggaz hold the spot. 17, when I worked my first dope spot. Now let me teach ya how to stunt, how to hold a glock. 7-1-3, I can't sleep till I see a knot. I'm seeing y'all gangsta, for the time being. You wonder who gon save you, when I'm not screaming. Any time of the day, I'll let that drama play. You can lay low, but I know where your mama stay. [T.C.]. Know how we roll, bitch nigga can't get away. T.C. hit your block, won't see another day. Still in the game, running shop still making moves. Running with Suga Slim, bitch bet pay my dues.

no regrets,"[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]. Hard times and good times... when they're mixed together. It can only make you stronger... even live a little longer. I see the Gs on the corner, holding steel, think they're real. But oh, it's only a short life. Pennies on their eyes 'cause they won't see tomorrow. [Hook]. Sometimes, I wanna run away, but I'm holding on to what I feel. In this life, we don't crush no deals, back in the day. Back in the day when I used to be a mindless kid. Now I'm on that holy bid, no regrets for the things I did. It's the only way, only way, only way. To live with no regrets. You know you'd better live with no regrets. [Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]. You can roll up your problems, smoke 'em like a champion. You can pray for a miracle, and still nothing can happen. I ain't never been sober, and I'm a predictor of the future. But oh, it's only a short life. Pennies on their eyes 'cause they won't see tomorrow. [Hook]. [Verse 3: T. I.]. 15 with kingpin, kilogram dreams - money talks. You ain't talkin' money, G, Well we ain't talkin' 'bout a damn thing. (You know) Whip it 'til it's hard, serve it to the dope fiend. (You know) Or bring me 21-5, get a whole thing. On triple-beams they weigh up. You owe me, homie? Best pay up. Don't make me raise this AK up. You and your homie get sprayed up. My lifestyle wild - he ain't got a clue. Don't let this smile fool you, bruh, this what you'd better do. Give me my R-E-S-P-E-C-T. 'Fore I leave you D-O-A, you won't need no D-O-C. About my D-O-G, I swear to G-O-D.

From the LB....LB. {They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}. [Tray Deee]. What up cuz? You know aint nothin different on mines. When I hit up motherfuckers with that look in my eyes. It's a statement that I'm makin and aint takin no backtalk. I'm blowin niggaz hats off as soon as my gat cough. The last thought you rappin niggaz should think. Is you can never get a scratch with Tray Deee on the beat. On the streets over beef you dont compete with uno - you know. The general a criminal do low. Admit cuz I'm wit it then I spit it and lit it. Niggaz timid in my vision I cause tension and thinkin. By my presence I'm a answer to society's hate. A true rider with the mind - I pushed him outta his way. Fools petty and they ready steady comin with bullshit. A full clip with jewell will hit like a mule kick. A sure hit is all I'm aiming for when I blast. Motherfuckers hit the deck once I go in the dash. [Chorus: Snoop Dogg]. Now is the time. This is the place. To bang back the khakis with the church fat lace. West is the coast, east is the side. Long Beach is the city where them gangstas ride. Money brings power, power brings respect. Disrespect the set I gotsta grab the tech. This is how it goes and thats how it's done. Eastside 2-1 in the land of the fun. [Tray Deee]. Niggaz how ya figure that the game gon' wait. I came home straight from the pen to take your place. Aint no chase this paper comin soon as I post up. And watch the victom's clock and catch him choppin his dough up. Fuck the his host up stripped, gagged and roped up. Take the whole cut and he be sure negotiative. I'm ruthless I shoot crips and bloods alike. Thug for life - come and catch the slug tonight. Insane mental frame feel no shame or pitty. Since the game is shitty I gotsta bang the city. Trippin gangstas so I brang the terroristical heat. Grab strap jacket mack to reach the tinted to peep. This is the beach now any nigga got a rebuttal. Kobe eatin what he speakin once he cant get the muzzle. Struggle hard for my title and intend to hold it. You want it? Then all invitations open. [Chorus]. [Tray Deee]. I take seven old B's put 'em in the street. Then thats seven more busta's who claim they got heat. And then it takes seven more C's before I start to reach. Then thats 2-1 for the set now lets stretch out in the streets. Tray Deee never do it easy fool so dont expect it. Niggas get checked and they sets disrespected. No question I'm all you ever thought that you was. Till you ran across the boss and now you coughin up blood. Shoot first fools curse before they kick up dust. Clip gon' bust then they gonna have to pick loc up. All they talkin cause I'm chalkin whole districts off. Since this loss a purple nigga's piss me off. Conflict with my clique get your bitch ass touched. All my comrads bomb back it's as sick as fuck. 2-1 till I'm done never run from the turf. Check the badge boy we mash on run get it even worse. [Chorus]. [Kokane & {Snoop Dogg}].

You may think I'm outta bounds but I think I'm in. I holla at my folks before I step on in. Spit at my nigga Andy Hilfiger. Slide up in the garden, next to Steve Martin. We settin up shop on the east coast now. Dogghouse nigga, the big bow wow. And we higher than a motherfucker, east side up. Like this and like that motherfucker. Eastdide. So wide you can't get around it. So low you can't get under it, now. So high you can't get over it. I just want to make your day. [Goldie Loc]. Wakin up late off a fucked up day. I was in Dogg sippin, straight DoggHouse crippin. Fuck wit us and get that ass bombed out. Need some smoke, for the homies from the south. This is what it's all about. It's the city of the beach where the gangsters bang. Sam wake that ass up, get fresh, let's do some thangs. Swerve through the eastside Loc, scoop up the homies. Bang them other fools cuz them busters don't know me. It seems like this is my only chance to get rich. Invest in my chips, never chippin off a bitch. Trip, bring that bomb to me. Underwater with cocaine, crackin with P O P. Up, up, up in smoke, you can hit it in a bong. I'm faded like Cheech and Chong. Watch out for the second hand smoke. [Tray Deee]. Yeah, I was born and raised in the ways of a ridah. Representin mines to be a true Eastsidah. Survival of the fittest, how we live this shit. Fuck a bitch, dump a clip, out to get them chips. No restrictions, takin off as soon as friction. Pop, niggas drop once I pops the clip in. Pimp wearin khaki suits and stacy biscuits. And known like Capone to them gangsta bitches. Keep em workin somethin everywhere we go. Either dope or the stroll if the bitch is a hoe. West coast to the fullest but I bang the east. Mad motherfuckers side to that city Long Beach. So throw them gang signs up when you see me ride up. And know for sure I'm bouta throw the eastside up. And if a nigga got beef with that. That's where his ass'll be sleepin at. Point blank."

Straight up, no leaning, I'm right where the chips at. Or even in the hood where the crips at. Joint seem mighty long, red beam on his dome. Point seen money gone. [Hook: Jeremih]. Let's roll out to Miami and get the money. Baby how that sound?. When I'm feelin' high I'm probably on some light skin. When I'm feelin' low I'm sippin' on some brown. Won't you come trips to California?. We can get with it, show you how the shit goes down. Know around the world'll get nasty. And I'mma be right there, as long as where it's. That's where the cash be. [Post-Hook: Jeremih]. Cash be. And I'mma be right there, right where my cash be. Yeah yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's where the cash be. [Interlude: Snoop Dogg & Jeremih]. All right now, I need Passion to the stage. I need Destiny, Maliah, Passion. And I'mma be right there, right where my cash be. I need y'all to the stage, let's go. Yeah yeah. I need y'all on the stage, let's go. Work, work, work. [Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]. In a white ghost sipping holy water. Always been the type to get it close to Porter's. After play, Barry Bonds, out the park. I got hits, what you mean? I throw the tarp. At the wall, off the wall, I feel like Mike. I don't miss, niggas talkin' shit. Say I took his bitch, hit that pussy, it took one night. Hitting that hoe quit, it was just aight. Uhh, not at all. I ain't get to see the wall, I cocked 'em all. Fucked it all, fuck the law, fuck you thought. I ain't change, seen my chain looks like the car. Flash man, flashy this and dancing on me. Dirty dancing, dancing like my double cup. Lemonade to niggas that be talking tough. Say you got money, I just double up. Multiply, fuck addition, fuckin bitches all night. Macauley Culkin, rich and riches. This the life, they walk away, it's so delicious. Up in Dubai, sushi, hella bitches. Aw man wrote a check, 2 commas. Please please, tell em' I need two shots by two o' clock. Plus that adds about $2000, two drops. Pull up with my crew sellin out. [Outro: Jeremih]. I need a girl who will do whatever I want. I need a girl who will do whatever I want"

Thick in the thighs wasn't part of they plan. Not just his bitch, I'm like his main man. Act shifty - your resistance gone swiftly. Bitches mad at a nigga, askin why he kissed me. Stop whinin, just to cry and get the mackin daddy. I don't like it when the angry chick is actin crabby. That's why he bagged me. Ghetto jewel, never loud and trashy. No stressin over chicks - problem? Bet I solve it fastly. [Chorus] - 2X. [Snoop Dogg]. We gangbang on these niggaz like we 'posed to do. and I'll be damned if I let a bitch get close to you. We posted Boo - you, my, one and only. Quick to dump before the homies. Remember when that phony nigga ran up on me at the club?. You filled him up with slugs, that's what I call love. All that pushin and shovin, kissin and huggin. Thuggin, dig it, dug-in. I'm lovin every minute of it Boo. The way you stay true, and always kept your cool. You kept the heater right by your thigh. And when the shit got hectic you was ready to ride. You didn't run out, when I pulled the gun out. That's what I'm talkin bout, no doubt. Ruff Rydin, Eastsidin, to the realest y'know. D-O-double-Gizze, you know how we get busy. [Eve]. Aiyyo, how could I leave a real nigga? A real nigga's all I need. Fake bitches try to take my place, fall to they knees. Don't violate, see my man, he don't like no scrapes. And if I heard you was frontin I hope on the case. Wild one? Maybe, but I'ma protect my baby. Test me fool and by the end you gon' think I'm crazy. That's how I do for my Dogg, keep my (?) strong. Both sides relied on the shit, nigga sing the song. [Chorus] - 2X. [Snoop Dogg].

What's with that in your socks?. Grab this motherfucker in your sight. Look out (look out!) bitch here comes the Ridahman. Now there once was a man who lived in my hood. To some people bad but to me he was good. He wore pindletens and 501 jeans. And the black Chuck Taylors with black yellow strings. He loved makin' poise and smokin' up blunts. And the weed that he be smokin' have you flowin' for months. You could smell the dealer comin' from a mile away. And if he see the kids snoopin' he be down to play. But if a nigga got to trippin' he be down the sprets. That be AK?K-K-K-K-K. But this one time, this one guy. Thought he could come to our town and drive. And go against the ridah but Ridah is the ridah. He hit it with 11 and he knockin' with the rida. He usually wore the shot but he gave the boy an ass. Said if you'll come back nigga, that'll be your ass. But the young nigga laughed, he didn't seem to be scared. But he definitely took a car and got his ass up outta there. And we later found out that the guy's name was Tommy. And Ridahman used to mess with his son's mommy. Ridahman, Ridahman, does whatever a rida can. What's with that in your socks?. And you fuckin' niggas all want Siroc. Ridahman, Ridahman, keep a big getup inside my hand. What's with that in your socks?. Grab this motherfucker in your sight. Look out (look out!) bitch here comes the Ridahman. Now Tommy went home and told his homeboy Ronny. And Ronny told Johnny and Johnny got money. And Lonny was a shooter and his weapon was a Tommy. He didn't care about life, he'll shoot anybody. So they came back to my neighborhood to drive. And found Ridahman and he ran ?em for their lives. Used his rida senses to go behind the mine. What kind of car they drive? So he what (?). And there they go. See him pass a nigga Black Reeker. So he reached into his pocket and pulled out a Desert Eagle. Rida start bussin', I think he hit somethin'. Tommy falls out the car with his whole bullshit. And his homie didn't make it, Ridahman got ?em all. Even Lonny gave the kid a chance to bust the Tommy off. Ridahman goes over to Tommy and then he laughs. And he laughs ?bout the nigga but my gun start blastin'. Yea, how'd you know that I was comin' with my people?. And you even knew the car, how'd you knew it was a Reegle?. Well, besides me being the Ridahman. Your son's mom told me, now okay, bye my man. Ridahman, Ridahman, does whatever a rida can. What's with that in your socks?. And you fuckin' niggas all want Siroc. Ridahman, Ridahman, keep a big getup inside my hand.

santa claus goes straight to the ghetto,"( ) = Santa voice. [ ] = Squeaky kid voice. Intro: Bad A$$. Is that the black Santa Claus? (Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!). I want a Super Nintendo ... yeah, Sega Genesis, yeah,. Street Fighter 2, all these games.... [Mommy! Is that the black Santa Claus?. That is the black Santa Claus! Mommee! Mommee! Mommee!]. Verse 1: Dat Nigga Daz. It's 12.30 AM, Christmas Eve. I'm out with the gangstas and thieves. Celebratin', postin' up with eggnog [head up up] in my cup. [Put Rudolph and Moses] lil' bang-bangin' and coastin'. Down the block but be careful for the heart, because it's posted'. Some stay to this day that Christmas ain't nothing but another day. But, out of respect, I gotta give the Lord his day. Tell me, tell me, where do the homies and bums got to sleep? {Nowhere}. Where do hungry and the needy-greedy's got to eat? {But who cares?}. Life is so crucial and cold, [it's worse] for the children. In this world they hopes and dreams can't afford. The young and old churches and spiritual dreams, seasonal things. Heard throughout the ghetto reaches gangstas and dope-fiends, huh. 'Cause those who ain't able get it now can finally get it. â€˜Cause the ghetto Santa Claus has sprinkled the hood and now we ballin'. Livin' to a new year of better thangs. Celebrate it with some Champagne, ha ha, check it .... Chorus: Nate Dogg. Santa Claus ... is coming straight to the ghetto .... Bridge: Snoop Doggy Dogg. Now on the first day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me. A sack of the krazy glue and told me to smoke it up slowly. Now on the second day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me. A fifth of Hendog and told me to take my mind off that weed. Now by the third day of Christmas, my big homeboy gave to me. A whole lot of everything, and it wasn't nuthin' but game to me. Verse 2: Bad A$$. Back then, you woke up to the sound of â€œI Saw Mama Kissing Santaâ€. Made you remenisce on the old fashion Christmas days. Gifts, miss a fat man jolly with joy. Down ya chimney with toys for lil' girls and boys. Pumped up, I jumped up before the sun peeped in. And hoped to catch a Santa Claus creepin' down my hall. Ran to the window, put my eyes to the sky. To see if I could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy. I sigh, ain't no sign, but everything under this tree in my house is mine. My bike, that, and this plastic nine'll do fine till next year come. I try to see the same thing, they got us brain washed dumb. And when you find, it ain't no Santa, Christmas still mean a lot. 'Cause it's the time to get together and give all you got. You got food, good moods, and what's better than together with your people. When wishers give a toast by the tree, it's Merry Christmas. Chorus. Verse 3: Snoop Doggy Dogg (starts during chorus). (Don't get too close because you might get shot .... Welcome to the ghetto ...). Santa Claus on the ceiling, Jack Frost chillin'. Pinch the Grinch for being a holiday villain. Season's greetings, all the proceedings. Are brought to you by the church house where we'll be eatin'. Chestnuts roastin' on an open fire. Singin' my jingle, where is Kris Kringle. I didn't pop, I ain't even shouted. I even stayed in the house, where the homies tried to sneak me out. And all I want for Christmas is my 6-4 Chevrolet. And a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly. Ain't that somethin'? Nah, ain't that nothin'. How it's Christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin'. Everybody happy, hair still nappy. Gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy. Catch me giving out turkeys at the church-house. Don't try to work me, just stand in the line and everything gon' be fine. Holla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down. Ain't no help from no elves, just Tha Dogg Pound. And we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs. Christmas on the Row, can you dig it? {can you dig it}. Chorus. Verse 4: Tray Deee. Christmas Eve, by the leaves, every 6 with the year. Girls and boys full off joy with the season cheer. Smell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin' baked. To be ate after everything gone off your plate. But wait, not tonight it's straight beans and rice. On the table, are we able to proceed tonight?. I wonder what the morn's bringin' so it's hard to doze off. Three 'o clock in my socks I crack the dope song. Hopin' when I open the door I'll see Santa. Now who the hell is this in this blue bandana. Messin' with the boxes that's up under the three. Look like Santa Claus been crossed to a woman to me. Now I'm comin' to see, the whole picture gettin' clearer. How we have messed; I says best get nearer. Mirror, mirror, please, it's seemed I've be deceived.

When you're great they gonna hate. So what, that's probably why we Cali-fornicate. And shake to a whole nother elevation. Catch me in the hood or your favorite television station. Creatin', a whole nother lane for the generation. I drink Sunkist for the good vibration. Dippin', Rippin', shakin' and bakin'. I know you've been patiently waitin', I'm back y'all. [Chorus]. Snoop Dogg is out. You wanna be there partyin'. All night long. Until the break of dawn. Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh. Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh. [Snoop Dogg]. On your mark, set, party on 3. 4, hit the floor and go for what ya know (hey!). I'm in the party low-key, blowin' an eighth of dro. I'm playful but I don't play. Spinnin' the globe like the strobe. Like the club packed, my flow right the whole night. If I plan to go right, a cold night. in hell before I fail, I'm alright. Man, I'm like a flash of lightnin'. Breath of fresh air, classic debonair. Glass of champagne, hold it in my right hand. Finger roll cold, Dogg the Ice Man. Brazil to Iceland. I shine like a million lights man. The talk of the town, believe it or doubt it. I don't need to shout it, you better read about it. [Chorus]. Snoop Dogg is out. You wanna be there partyin'. All night long. Until the break of dawn. Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh. Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh. [Snoop Dogg]. Now pose like a superstar, walk like a model. I love it when you pop that bottle. I love it 'cause you're not so automatic. I love it when you put it where Dogg can grab it. I got my hands where you'll let me. I love it when you dance, so sexy. I love it when you in that night mood. Slow motion movin' like ain't nothin' like you. I'm feelin' good doin' what I like to. Suited up, pimp stripe, light blue. I let it do what it might do. Fresh and crispy, the rest a mystery. I'm blessed with history. No less than best, catch the rest. Live in the flesh, smooth with the style I choose. Not off the stress, I'm hot off the press. [Chorus]. Snoop Dogg is out. You wanna be there partyin'. All night long. Until the break of dawn. Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh. Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh"

L0Dog you my nigga. If you don't get no bigger. Spanky Loco from the the dub, and Little Man from the I. Dear God why them good niggas have to die. I can't reminisce too long.

But to fine time to leave all that behind. An tryin to spend some time an give you all of mine {what's that} ya see. I ain't hard to get along with, to do a song with a nigga like D.J. Pooh. Dedicate this whole thing, to a girl like you, boo, look here. You know I'm true, just continue to do me like you want me to do you. An, I hope we don't never have to, write another chapter.

Every room at the house is where I smoke my dope, no joke. Got keys to the spot so I can slide by necessary. Mary, Mary, Quite Crip Contrary. Apartment contemporary. Jo Malone candles, very airy.

A lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me. But look here, I work hard for all the things I got. And to hang with a nigga's just an intricate plot. You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes. And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors. But look here dog, a hoe once told me loc. Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke.

Ayyo Snoop (I used to). I used to cook up dope, ride with niggas. Know about the hits, hang with killas. Take the broads down for the jailhouse visits. Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga. Have the card parties where the stakes was high. Go shopping hit the club and then ????????????. Never had a day without no drama. Half the OG's age, but they call me Mama. Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag. Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad. I never thought about my life I swear y'all, for real. Until my best friend Jill got killed and then I. Dropped to my knees and called to the Lord. Please change my ways cause I'm living too hard. And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child. When I'm out here buck wild, damn, I had to slow down. Slow down (slow down), cause I can't take the heat, slow down. (Slow down baby). It's wicked in these streets (Slow down baby). Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down. (Slow down, slow down). It's wicked in these streets. Mia X:. Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut. And started putting all this game on records for my come up. From sun up to sun down, I'm trying to get my money. Hata's ain't gon' stop me cause hatas can't run me. It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul. Every body seemed glad, but now they ?????. Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free. And Feds can't take shit from me, so slow down. Snoop:. I got niggas shot niggas drop niggas for fun. I ????? from these shoulders, I don't need no gun. But it's the nineties, and niggas don't bump by the end of the round. The clown bound to dump, young chump. You don't wanna get caught up in my mix. Cause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch. We don't neva eva, talk no shit.

snoopafella,"Once upon a time, in the L.B.C.. On the Eastside, off of 2-1 Street. There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name. To make it interesting it's me, peep game. I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad. And two step-brothers who treated me bad. I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors. And I was like an errand boy runnin to the stores. My brothers, they used to boast and brag:. ""We've got Fubu, and you've got rags!"". And even worse than that, to make me feel low. They gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows. Girls used to say, ""Snoop, you're so cute. But you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit"". Welllll, one day, up the Avenue. There was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew. He said ah, ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!. The princess is having a royal ball. If you can rap, also dress fresh. You might win a date with the sweet princess"". Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash. I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad. I said, ""Step-dad, may I?"". And before I could finish, ""Hell no!"", he replied (Cinderfella!). My brothers were goin, they were gettin down. Even Pops was goin for a piece of the crown (Cinderfella!). They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted. ""We can and you can't,"" is what they taunted (nana-nana-nah-nah). They all stood there, laughin in my face. And as they walked out they said, ""Clean up this place!"". (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!). And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love. (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!). And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love. (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!). And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love. (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!). And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love. Well I shrugged, I hissed, they all tried to diss. And I'd get them back if I had one wish. Before I could make my thought a phrase. There appeared a man from a puff of haze. He said, ""What's up, Dogg? My name is Herb. I'm your fairy Doggfather, you know it, word!. Now I've came here with the main purpose. Of granting you your fondest wish"". I said, ""Herb, my man, just make me fresh. And I'm sure that I can handle, all the rest"". With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot. And I was jumpin in my body: a slick silk suit. On my feet was some white tube socks. And a fresh pair of Chucks from the Foot-lock. I showed him my sack, and don't you know. With a snap, the sack became some doe-doe. Once again his hands began to flow. Then he changed my skateboard into a six-fo' (damn!). He checked me over, passed me the keys. And said, ""One more thing before you leave.... You must return before the stroke of twelve. Or you'll turn back into your old self"". (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!). And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love. (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!). And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love. I jumped in the low-low and went on my way. I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say. It was after eleven when I rocked the mic. And by the time I left the stage, the people were hyped (well alright!). The princess was starin, while holdin a drank. Reflected from her eyes was gold tank. She waved her hands like, ""Hello! Hi!"". Then gave another gesture like, ""Come here, guy!"". I left the stage, girls came in flocks. The bitch was swingin from the hard knocks. I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock. Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock. No time to waste, I broke out in haste. The princess followed in a futile chase. A quick steady pace is what I kept. Lost one of my Chucks on one of those steps. For the six-fo' I continued my stride. About this time I heard gong five. I was down the block when I heard gong eight. And the princess screamed out, ""Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!"". (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!). And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love. (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!). And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love. I was almost home when my luck ran out. And there went my suit, my doe sack and clout. My fresh low-low, also went too. And there was no denyin that my night was through. The one All-Star, the freshest thing I sported. Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded. Made it to my pad, no time at all. Went to my room, or better yet the far wall. Hid the shoe away, still feelin pleased. Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's. Early the next mornin, when I awoke. I threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat. Slid into the front, my family stared at me. Sayin, ""Wasn't that you? Nah, it couldn't be"". They kept askin me if I did my chores. My butt was saved by a knock at the door. ""Who is it?"", that's what my brothers barked. ""The princess,"" this sweet voice remarked. She said she was lookin for a certain man. Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand. The family ran around with their heads in the air. Bringin her shoes from everywhere. She just shook her head, a nod of relief. And said, ""No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, Chief"". I ran in the room and got my shoe. And said, ""Is this the one you're referring to?"". Well she said, ""Yes, and you're so cute. But where's your doe-doe and slick silk suit?"". I put on the shoe, then there came a flash of light. And I was wearin shit, from just last night. Looked out the window, saw the six-fo'. Yelled to my family, ""I've GOT to go!"". We drove up the Avenue, the princess and I. And in back of me, I heard my family cry.... (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!). And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love. (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!). And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love. (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)."

stoner's anthem,"A friend indeed. Feelin'like cee lo green. Middle finger in the sky. Meditating let it ride rock'a'by baby bye. A friend indeed. More than jimmy 2. More than giving you. No prohibs dude you can have all this. Until i couldn't find no one else that i can give it to. And now that we own. I can put my family in a brand new home. My kids is grown. And i'm still rocking on the microphone. People love me everywhere and i know why. It's not that i'm dope. My style is so fly. James brown sat me down in a chair. And said ""snoopy don't you ever cut your hair"". I was dazed and amazed. That's why i keep my shit in pony tails and even braids. When i was in school i used to get cool grades. When i graduated i used to smoke 2 js. With a fifth of …groups. …. But then i got into… just like them vatos. Posted up 6 1. Yeah, that's the block though. Ride by slow and get yo ass popped on. Me and …. Faith and cherry that's what …. Can't forget tim. Baby dog ain't half dead. Dre lo was a 20′ s crip that showed me a lot of shit. I'm moving along. Went form my camero to a fleetwood brougham. My sack in my back, my strap in my lap. Room to the back. Roaming through my neighborhood. Checking my tracks. As you get old life might get unfold. Can't settle, this might be untold. Twilight zone, live life long. Smoke your bong and hit you a blunt. And buy you a zong. And roll you a j. And put it in the e i. And lets stay way fucked up till we d ie. All in together now, and if you agree. Lighters in the air and repeat after me. I too glow, forever in the day. I love for our soul. Does everybody agree it aint so. Everybody's case, smoke like we smoke. Give a dog a bone. I like trees, the cyprus hill grow. Roll up this shit. Pimp and it's gone. Stoners world wide singing this song. Yeah. Straight stoner's anthem. A lil something to smoke, too. Brought to you by dc powder. And your boy snoop dogg. Be on the look out for that movie. High school. Snoop dogg and wiz khalifa. Ak devin nd mac. And the soundtrack, that's wassup"

I still wear the same pair of khakis least three days. Nappy ass french braids and it aint no thang. Hang with motherfuckers wanted for all types of crimes. Plus them little bitty niggas on they bikes wit nines. On the grind no I rhyme nigga times is hard. Got jugs of water buried all across my yard. One time on my line tryin ta find a cause. Toss a nigga in the street and reach up under my balls. Guns cocked, mug shots, cell blocks and locked down. But I done made it too far to stop now. Results of a banger, to most I'ma danger. No hope for those who come to close to the chamber. Bitches lovin I'ma gangster so fuck it. No matta if I hafta I get at em in a bucket. Tuckin in my shirt and all that shit don't work. First look, say I'ma crook that did dirt for the turf. High talk, high walk, when I stalk the street. Gurantee who try to see me come across the feet. It's a eastside lifestyle, wild and foul. Goin out, puttin it down sayin fuck the trial. Aim is to be famous wit major loot. A gang of juice, in case I gots to bring the troops. And everybody know the eastside the craziest.

tha g in deee,"[Snoop Dogg]. Yeah man, let me holla at my nephew Tray-Deee. Nephew, I can't believe these motherfucking stupid ass bitches man. I done told em time and time and time again. Well I guess they don't hear me. So uh, why don't you let me know. Matter fact let them know how you feel about these motherfucking hoes. [Tray Dee]. I can't explain how I came across the game I got. More likely from parlayin with these things a lot. Be on the gangsters jocks, soon as they spot that you clockin'. These snakes'll plot, and then be all in your pockets. Droppin little hints 'bout they rents and bills. When you tell em you can't help em wanna twist they grills. Like you owe em once you show em that you're interested. When they knowin you be wantin just to hit and dig. I aint got shit to give, but hard dick and conversation. And talkin end, when I commit the penetration. I toss at them, if it was proper we could kick it. When we cross again, but you know aint no commitment. I want ya when I need ya, and that's the procedure. I call you and fall through, strictly at leisure. And only keep ya, until you start to cost me. Then I reverse the game til ya back up off me. Kill em softly. HOOK:. Bitches ain't shit, I said it before, and I say it again, Tray Deee. Bitches ain't shit, they only fuckin with your homies. Cuz they know you got a grip. Bitches ain't shit, I said it before, and I'ma say it again, Tray-Deee. Bitches ain't shit, they only fuckin with your homies. Cuz they know you got a grip. [Tray Deee over Hook]. I done peeped these knucleheads all ?? dogg. These bitches on the gold rush. This aint 1849 quit that pan handling hoe. This '99, you tryin to get yours, but I need all mine. You knowhatimsayin?. [Tray Dee]. I keep the energy caught her eyein me down. Back when she first started hangin around. In Long Beach got real deep on some real G sex. So you got served bitch now what's next. I ride on the side while we slide in my broom. Old goons can't get with the ?foon?. Naw I'm on another level, let's get in your shit. Blowin herb while we swerve and we spend your chips. Drain me and take me to the finest spots. Out the dinin shop and buy me diamond rocks. It's a privilege to get the dick and fuck wit me. Knowin the whole way I roll is in luxury. I'm a major type of player out for ruling the game. Every line I design is for schoolin a dame. When I approach I let 'em know it's all money and sex. But I gotta be blessed before we make 'em connect. [Tray Dee over Hook]. I check a bitch as quick as Goldie the mac. And keep them quarter sacks and holdin my straps. I only want what's in the middle of they laps. And plus I hump before I get 'em for they snaps. (repeat). . [Tray Dee]. I can't conceive spendin cheese just to please a broad. When eventually intentions be to leave 'em all. In the minus, no matter if they the finest. Then recognize the price come with rollin with riders. You can't expect to step up in my company. And we just fuck for free, and you not touchin me. With some fine ass why chance gettin involved. And be callin me a dogg after hittin them draws. I'm out to ball, so keep all emotions in check. And don't be tryin to test what you're sure to regret. Thinkin you gon be sinkin up inside my profits. Bitch you got twist but you needs to stop it. I'm cold on the hold like the frozen snow. For my dough unless we both tryin to make it grow. I think you know, my bank be mo', than us kickin it. What's mine is mine, but what's yours we splittin it. [Tray Deee]. I got three questions for a bitch though. Where mines at, what's takin you so long to kick it in. And how long this gon take you to get me some more hoes. You know...."
tha mac bible,"[Mac Minista]. There's a scripture in the Mac Bible that says. 'He that trusts a ho, shall surely be broke'. 'Pressure busts a pipe that make water run uphill'. Alotta you niggas talk that shit. But half you niggas ain't real. Will the real niggas stand up and be counted. Or lay down and be mounted. Cuz this game is not a playground, it's a classroom. It's not a holiday, but an educational process. And experience is your greatest teacher. So listen to the gangsta mack preacher. Macks do what they want, bustas do the best that they can. From half of a gangstas start, is a sucka's dream. In the game God said, that he would send a G. With the street ethnics and G-Code. With the gangsta Ten Commandments. And the gangsta Ten Commandments shall read:. 'Thou shall kill a snitch'. 'Thou shall check a bitch'. 'Thou shall charge a ho'. 'Thou shall send a sucker'. 'Thou shall respect the G'. 'Thou shall pack that steel'. 'Thou shall keep it real'. 'Thou shall flex his G's'. 'Thou shall stack his green'. 'Thou shall stay true to his game'. See I'm a gangsta, not a prankster. I don't pull rabbits out of my hat. But I will pull a strap from behind my back. Now how 'bout that!."

We up in smoke, making street schemes. Smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams. Break it down, put it in the zig zag. And pull the top back and let the ass drag. Hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch. Executive branch, get a whiff of this. Black car, sack a dank. High school nigga what the fuck you think. I'm passing all my classes with flying colors. And everyday I'm high as a motherfucker. [Chorus]. [Wiz Khalifa:]. Sun roof open, smoking while I'm rolling. My bitches only notice it if it's potent. Bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean. Get in between your legs. Join roaches and ashes all in your bed. You calling her babe, she calling me instead. Cause I put that game all in her hair. She saw the crib, she know that I'm balling. When he ain't have nothing he used to stall em. Now I with the boss dogg, all the bad hoes want him. And my pockets on swole, I'm talking Rick Ross big. And now when we shop we don't care what the cost is. Rolling up good, smoking that bomb shit. Blow a whole OZ, nigga that's boss shit. Now she all fuck her man, rubberbands in my pocket. Getting money, going hard for my profit. Bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings. Young nigga getting bread, why knock it. [Chorus:].

Slid me away just to get me away. I'm just a Long Beach nigga outside of my hood. I'm banging, riding, but doing it good. When I get locked down there ain't hiding and wondering. As soon as I hit the County I'm up in 48 hundred. With the dealers the killers the realist there beastt. The best from the west and the beast from the east. Yeah I'm acting a fool. I'm getting my degree from gladiator school. I chose this life cause I knows this life. Sell a little crack and my flows is tight. I'm clear on my choice and what's cold is.

If you get caught then you don't walk cause you don't talk. And these was the rules squeeze on these fools. I came up in a different era homie. Where the G's is the G's and the little wannabe's really want it. Wanna be like cause the C life make you wanna G like. Now who you wanna be like. That fool on the TV screen. Or the homie on the corner getting major cream. In the Cadillac beating like Battle Cat. A nigga with money don't know how to act. Smoke til your eyes get cataracts. All money nonsense yeah none of that. Quarter sack run it back roll it back lock him up bag him up front him that. If a trick jump the track do you want your money back. Lil bitch was a bunny rat. Watch for the funny hat. Cause it's gonna come. And my granny said it's no fun. She say day turn to night and play turn to fight. Yeah I guess my granny was right.

too black,"(Intro). Do you think it is by accident that everytime. a black leader appears on the horizon. with any kind of cleverness, or charisma he's cut down?. Malcom, Martin, Leadkur, I want you to arm yourself. And I've asked Josh to be your bodyguard. All right Dason. It might be good for Joshua to seal, like he has somethin' to do. So detatched from us, these are only for you. (Snoop Dogg). Damn, cool, good, so good, gotta do wrong. so cold should... gotta do wrong. (Chorus: Snoop Dogg). It seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me. The world is filled with so much jealousy. You don't know who to trust cause you might get shot. (Snoop Dogg). You might get got, and you might not. Make it to see a whole 'nother day, you better. watch your hand and watch how you play. Cause you don't know how the system might get you twisted. if you don't pay attention, and you'll come up missin'. I'ma give it to you - live and direct. Cause I know, a million niggas doin' bad and they check. They game every day but they try to find a way. But somehow, some way, there ain't no pay (uh). It's the same game, from my town to your town. from L.A. to Chi-Town, Baghdad (that's right). To the rebel we deliver the true game. And niggas gettin' upset cause they can't maintain (player haters). Don't get mad cause I was blessed with a gift. To give you people what you need and no more deep shit (that's right). Lit up, get up, sit up, I write it. Then I, put you all in the mood, you invited. So come on down and party with the pound (come on). You ain't never heard a nigga come around and put it down. Just like the Soopa-Doopa, with no Woopers. Guranteed to comin' through the party, see you visual cooper. Take her to my criz-zay, what you dizzy-in'. I ain't gonna discuss this, no more about to bust it. And when I do it, I'm gonna touch it, no discussion. It's Snoop Dogg, I got some languages aimin' for the Russians. and the overseas g's, please. Let me get you one of these with another ill beat (number two). I gots to do ya, like ya never been done. It's Snoop Dogg representin' Funk-2-1. I'm about the gee-ist of 'em all. Can you name a rapper who can fade the dog - hell nah. And if you can - you're lyin' to yourself. And if you lyin', you're dryin' with your cover. And if you dyin, you fuckin' with your death. I'm Snoop Dogg and I'm the top rapper, at the top of the shelf. I leave these suckers in amazement, dazement. And Death Row is still the label that pays me. (Chorus: Snoop Dogg). Seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me. This world is filled with so much jealousy. I don't know who to trust cause. if I trust hey I might, end up shot (end up shot, hmm). (Snoop Dogg). I turn to the left and I turn to the right. I see some motherfuckers 'bout to have a fight (whassup, whasssup?). What should I do? (should I do) Should I watch, uh?. Or should I jump in? Or should I come with the glock?. I knocks on the door, plus ""Oh No"". I gots to avoid the drama and take the slow-mo. type of approach - I'm the team and the coach. I hooks a left turn - no burn, for your concern, you gots to learn. Cause Snoop is on the mic and I'ma give you what you earned. And if you get it, watch me spit it. I'm commited to do it and I'm a still aquitted. Never ever did it, or forget it. This guranteed to keep the party hittin'. And I'ma give you people what you need. And I'ma smoke up on just like a bag of weed. And if you into the mixture and into the rapture. Just sit back and listen cause Snoop Dogg's about to catch ya. Snatch ya and adapt ya with the shit that I got (hmm-hmm). I'm guranteed to rock the party non-stop (that's right). You ain't never heard a rapper who can flip this script. Guranteed to make the hoe's go ahead and get whipped. And when they stop rockin' - they won't. But if you fake the funk (youse a punk), then youse a punk (haha). You gots to keep it real with yourself baby boy (boy). Cause if you don't then you ain't labelled ""The Real McCoy"". I'm Snoop Dogg, yes I'm true indeed. I'm guranteed to light it up and ride it up and side it up. I'm guarnteed to, do my thing. Everybody in the party if ya down to bang - sing. What'cha wanna do, what ya gots to. Cause this is somethin' to rock you. (Chorus: Snoop Dogg). Seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me. This world is filled with so much jealousy. I don't know who to trust cause. if I trust either I might, end up shot or (end up shot, hmm). Seems like, (seems like), seems like, (seems like). I gotta do wrong. Seems like, (seems like, uh), I gotta do wrong"

If I'm hangin it's with DPG. *repeat*. Verse 1: Snoop Doggy Dogg. Some do the things that they do cos they dumb. and some do the things that they do for crumbs. I do mine for me ya see?. Not the big homey double O-G. Scared to do your own work, man that's fast. and that's the reason why I had to shoot you down. because you never should've tried to work my Dogg. and the lil homey wouldn't had no reason to bump. Y'all know the game ain't the same no mo'. Lil G's keep heat so big G's freeze, geez!. Johnny Rockafella went to jail-er. few many times too many and became a teller. They sell a nigga dreams if he want em. but they won't sell you the game to get up on em. Ya tryin ta find em cos you want em, they shook out. Get the book out and when the pitch come, nigga look out. it ain't hard to pump up the lil homies nigga. but it's hard for your bitch ass to get wit us. But it's steel, you put it in their head. that at 13 they better off dead (now they gone). Chorus. Verse 2: Kurupt. Aiyo Snoop, why would niggas get into the bracket. and make a loot, niggas want trip. Spittin like ""you spoke beef from the hood. Show me love nigga or don't show me shit"". Feel the fever, million dollar male like Cole Severs. Made a non-believin man into a believer. Receive a cheque the next day, my homies say. ""it's the way to get paid"", DP's and pay. I don't know why you wanna get on my back? (why?). Trippin cos you know the bomb's at where I'm at. Well if that's the case you shoulda roll. wit the PG instead of losing control (motherfucker). This is how we do, Dogg Pound Gangstas in blue. Me, D-A-Z, N-A-T-E and Snoop. Niggas from Seth be tryin to set you cos you settin your ways. so ask DJ Pooh what pays. Chorus. Verse 3: Snoop Dogg. Just what we need, bangin on wax another trip. What you gon' do nigga, jack the mothership?. You're like a actor wit another script. Predictable as Rambo wit another clip. How many niggas you gon' kill in your verse?. You need to sit down and learn to get down first. cos, uhh, real hoo-bangers are toast-slangers. not part-time FBI singers. Niggas havin bad intentions, sendin BG's on a mission. One move too many, nigga you missin. Listen you fuck wit the cyco-lic-no. loony ass nigga from your H-doubleO-D. Niggas got too flossy from all the sex they tossin. but guess what it cost em, they crossin me. But before I give a nigga a 9. I'd rather give a nigga a mic and write him a rhyme. Chorus x1 1/2."
ups & downs,"(Ad-lib). Every dog has his day. Another thirty nine inch thick classic(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah). Girl, as I sit here thinking to myself. There is no one for you but me, and I mean that.

Ya know my granddaddy use to always say. Ya know he used to say it like this. (CHORUS). There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns. Share with me, fairy tales or make believe. There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns. Share with me, fairy tales or make believe. There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns. Share with me, fairy tales or make believe. (VERSE). What up motherfuckers? This is Snoop Dogg. I'm trying to figure out how the fuck I'm gonna do y'all. Hanging with my homie from the turf, that's Young Q-ball. Giving me the word from the street, here's the scoop y'all. The niggaz from the Eastsidaz split up (split up). And one of 'em tried to fuck yo' shit up (What?). Naw cuz, don't believe that, that's my nigga for life. I'm out with the bullshit, I'm in with the real shit. I'm at the church doing work, spittin'game from the pulpit. Now that's the bidness, and God is my witness. L-B-C-2-1-3 Hell yeah, we in this. It's so relentless, and all my dogs up against the life sentence. I love y'all, like I love no bitch, and that's real shit. Or some CRIP shit, homie dig this. (CHORUS). There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns. Share with me, fairy tales or make believe. There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns. Share with me, fairy tales or make believe. There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns. Share with me, fairy tales or make believe. (VERSE). I used to have a lot broads that I don't fool with. I used to have a lot of homeboys I ain't cool with. A lot people that a nigga used to go to school with. Happy as hell to see the Big Dog doin' it. But what none of them would believe though (What?). That I would be bigger the Kurtis Blow. I guess he was right, these are the breaks. Despite my mistakes and aches, I'm gettin' cake. To realize your fate through faith,(through faith). Cause we all gonna get that day (for what). To see if our lives was straight. And to see if we gonna walk through those Pearly Gates (Yeah?). To see the man upstairs, on some real talk homie. I'm tired of being stuck here. If I could I would fly to the moon (zoom). Y'all probably think I'm trippin' off deeze mushrooms (I know). (CHORUS).

vapors,"Can you feel it, nothing can save ya. For this is the season of catching the vapors. Since I got time, what I'm gonna do. Tell ya how it's spreading throughout my crew. What you want on Nate Dogg. Who sings on my records, 'Never Leave Me Alone'. 'Ain't No Fun', now check it. Back in the days before Nate Dogg would get it. He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam. The type of female wit fly Gucci gear. She wore a big turkish wole wit a weave in her hair. When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess. Talkin about baby please she wrought his service stress. Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer. The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her. But now he wear boots that match with his suits. And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap. And now she stop flautin and won't it speakin. Be comin round the Pound every single weekend. to get his beeper number she be beggin please. Dyin for the day to eat these. She caught the vapors. She caught the vapors. I got a little cousin that's kinda plain. He bring the heeb wit tha beep for the Dogg Pound gang. A mellow type of fellow best laid back. But back in the day he wasn't nuthin like that. I remember when he used to scrap every day. When my auntie would tell him he would never obey. He wore his khakis hangin down wit his starks untied. And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside. Around my neighborhood tha people treated him bad. Said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had. They said he grow up to be nuttin but a gangsta. Or be there in jail or some other shaker. But now he's grown up to be a surprise. D-A-Z got a hit record slangin world wide. Now the same people that didn't like him as a child. Bought the Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle. They caught the vapors. They caught the vapors. I got another homie from tha L-B-C. Known ta yall as D.J. Warren G. He cut grass trasform wit finesse. ......... and all that mess. I remember when we first started to rap. He tried to get this job at Calvin's record shop. He was in it to win it, but the boss front and said. Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted. Now my homie Warren still tried. On and on and on til the like break of dawn. To work at tha V-I-P would be the link. But they looked right past him so my homie straight dip. Now for the year after Regulate. Warren G is havin papers so my homies write straight. He walked into the same record shop as before. And the boss be like Warren welcome to my store. Offerin him a job but nah he don't want it. Damn it feels good to see people love Warren. Cause I remember when at first they wasn't. Now guess what they call sessy bussin. the vapors. They caught vapors. I got to talk bout me now. Last subject of tha story is about Snoop Dogg. I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog. When I was a teenager I tried to be down. And since they wasn't tryin to hear me I made the Dogg Pound. I saw a crew on 2-1 street. and said, 'Can I be down champ?' They said. no, and treated me like a wet food stamp. after gettin rejected, I ain't runnin upset. I said, 'What's a Dogg do to?' Rhymes at rates. When I used to go to parties, they make me wait. What I have to get on the mic to set M-C straight. I ain't never love no hoe since I'm listenin to my music. They acted like I wanted to keep hangin with the juzi. But now things switched from West to East. Short Dogg do ya remember me from 21st street G?. 'We used to see Daz, back in the day'. It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed. You caught the vapors. You caught the vapors. You got the papers."

Cuz, you must was buzzed. When you was bumpin your gums, who you thought I was?. But look, I ain't even trippin right now. It's like that there, bow, wow. So many styles I could flip em like a file.

we rest n cali (feat. goldie loc and bootsy collins),[Snoop Dogg:]. My goodness my gracious shell toe Adidas. with the fat blue laces. Hand full of aces trumped up dump trunk white wall paces. Drink til you drop motherfucker cop. Old English 800 on the block. Way before St. Ide's came to the spot. Niggas used to hang out and do the pop lock. And if we got into some shit we never pop shots. We'd squab scrap whatever it was. And live to talk about it and we get old cause. And keep a pack of zig zags for that good old bud. We do a house party what the fuck is a club. And the ese's they sold most of the drugs. La familia hell and [?]. We get money yeah and we do low ride. Represent it and talk nope no not I. That's the code in every hood that you roam. Fastest way to catch a hot slug in your dome. O. G. the place that I call home. Black Lac like that and it's sitting on chrome. Plaque in back strap in Lac. Antennas wake you up for a rat trying to set a new trap. Swinging the track dripping curl juice on your back. Breaking hearts like Roger and Zapp motherfucker. [Bootsy Collins:]. Back in the day it was cheaper to keep her. Hang out with your friends and smoking the reefer. Pound for pound we were the baddest in town. You just had to get up for the get down. Some say we the next generation. But we lack education. [Goldie Loc:]. [?] drinking mad dog 20 20. Silver satin blue Kool Aid sagging in my Dickies. I got my loccs on sailing through my neighborhood. Catch you slipping on them bricks it ain't all good. Front door kicker Glock spitter. Black and gold flag across my face when I get you. 3 wheeler tipping turning up the Alpine. [?] while I listen to the grapevine. [?] blue Crips all by the front door. East side rip riding gang banging all I know. Heart break hotel hush puppy neck kicker. I grew up on that crazy one five nigga. If you locc from my block then hop something. And I ain't talking bout no peel nigga block hunting. Blue corduroys while I'm talking on my brick phone. 14 years old had to bring the shit home. My uncle Sugar Bear showed me how to bag it up. Look at the block now nigga it's sewed up. I ain't playing with you old grand pubas. Peace out Rolando ran things with no [?]. Now take a picture of this 8 ball sipper. Look down at my shoes blue strings nigga. Goldie Loc will keep this motherfucker crack-a-lackin. The only thing I wanna hear is gang bang rapping. [Bootsy Collins:]. Some say we the next generation. But we lack education. Hanging with the crew of devastation. Yeah but we one nation mama. Tally-ho and away we go. See you next week with a brand new show. When you funk around here ain't nothing consensual. You know I funk so hard you gonna need your parent's credential. Now I'm in the street cause I lost my sheep. But now I know where to find that. Now how cool is cold when you're trying to compete. Standing next to me son you better take a seat. Can't none of you cut throats funk like me. You better check with Snoop Dogg and get your pedigree. Why oh why do I think like that. If I am with the dog you must be a cat. Now tally-ho and away we go. See you next week with a brand new show. I want the bomb I want that O. G. back. There's a party going on in my head. While I think about the blood that we shed. Then party uh when the player play. There's a party going on up in here. Back in the day it was cheaper to keep her. Hang out with your friends and smoking the reefer. Pound for pound we were the baddest in town. You just had to get up for the get down. Some say we the next generation. But we lack education. Hanging with the crew of devastation. Yeah but we one nation mama. Hanging with the Snoopatronics bobba

who got some gangsta shit?,"(Lil' Style). Nine in the mornin, feds at my door (my door). Lou Cortez creakin cross the hardwood floor (right). Dippin thru the alley I made my escape. Didn't even get a chance to grab my Snoop Dogg tape. Man with no music but happy he's free. Bailin fast as I can bail down 19th Street. I got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand. Gold on my knuckle, my pistol's closed in hand. I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta from the LBC. Remotely controlled by the bomb-ity. But just livin in big city is a serious task. Didn't know what the feds wanted, didn't have time to ask. (Snoop Doggy Dogg). We're comin with that G shit, that C shit that makin niggas sick. How does it feel to see a G from your clique?. Wake up, jumped out of bed wit my grin on (why?). Last night's dice game got my win on. About a G and a half is what I come with. but twenty five G's is what I left with. *?Teatley?* was the word I heard. I went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the cone. Gimme the dice so I can break you niggas. I threw a C (C-I-X) so my point was the biggie. Seven-four-four-tre back to back. I sent two fools back to their lizzack. (Kurupt). See now I'm off to the graveyard shift. and I gots ta pay my dues to make my grip. But I chill cos my ho might call. Ain't no thang cos I sleeps all day and slang when night fall. And I takes a quick walk up the block. with my Glock cocke, ready to make a stop where I set up shop. on 59th and 8th Ave where all the homies be hangin. That's where a nigga'll be slangin. I'm makin a cool grip of shit, this ain't me. so I put my chips together and cops a quarter ki. And now the shops on deck. and everything that's mines I protect with a Tek, I don't half step. Now I got ends. and I'm rollin a Lexus, fuck a Benz, and so many new friends. But I could only trust a few. and unawarely I trusted you. But if only G. (Snoop). It's Snoop, homies from the motherfuckin get-go. Devoted and quotin, back in '84. I was thirteen, G was a year older. but I still wadn't afraid to throw him from his shoulders. Gettin good on the hood was the anticipation. and yeah, King Park was the destination. Every nigga that I knew was at the Park that night. even the smokers that be levellin gettin sparked tonight. (Lil' Style). Back on the streets, straight blue and grey. cos I represent like every day. Nigga you can't tell me I don't be on the spot. when I can tell you all the homies that done get shot. From at least about five years ago. when I was in junior high goin to Marshall. The homey use to come up to the school and rock. and leave and have the bitches flockin his jock. Damn them was the days of the past. but since the Pizzound formed we been whippin people's ass. And everybody a blast. and if you don't believe me nigga you can axe the homey Daz. And that's your ass. Fucked around and let Young Swoop take your cash (ha ha). He didn't even run, he walked away (bust). cos I let it sit that day. I wished I was there I would've clowned. but that's why we axed your bitch ass from the Pound. Cos he wouldn't even squad back. Man we can't fuck with no niggas like that. He'll get us all cracked. If the police was behind us, he wouldn't even jump out with the strap. Now that's what I call a beeyatch! (Beeiyitch!). I second the emotion you was dropped the clique (yeah yeah). (Snoop). Some of these nigga are bitches too. And some of these niggas look just like you. So if you've ever been *?toetone?*. go out and get your roll on you punk ass nigga, you'll get stole on. (Dat Nigga Daz). It's 5:30 in the mornin, now I'm yizzawnin. Now as I perceive to get G to a tee. And before I bail to school you know I blaze up a sack. Another day, another dollar for the gangsta mack. Bitch act like you know, show me some sex and affection. and let me dial slow, flossin, tossin a bitch (bitch). Yeah Dogg, one more thing I forgot to mention. Shoot five niggas, shoot ten. Shoot the piece, slip to your fiends. Seven, goddamn it, when it deal. A '64 for the honeys, straight ho for the G. Young Daz, little nigga you can't fuck with me. (Snoop). Now I knew that them niggas couldn't get at you. So what made them niggas try to spit at you. Disrespect a gang that snitch on you. Y'all punk ass niggas, man y'all some bitches too. (Young Swoop). Who got some gangsta gangsta shit? (ha ha). Swoop G, I heard somebody's speakin up on you. Cos when I drop mines there was no more nickels and dimes. just quarters, ounces, half ounces and quota. PC is the season and I don't smoke blunt. It sees the indo with skunk, I might as well get drunk. To smoke some stress, that shit'll put a hole in your chest. I only want another twenty dollar, sure got me fucked up. My hood is gettin hot and niggas is tryin ta plottin. Come up off a young nigga, call his shots. Swoop G ain't the one, I do its to be done (aah). Al-ways have my gun and my G from 2-1. It's Cerritos but you don't hear me though cos you don't really know. about the you-know, I'm Cerritos, silly ho. Swoop G by the fuckin L-B's-C. None of these nigga wanna fuck with these (aah).

X stand behind the mic like Walter Croncite. Yo, keep the spotlight. I'm keeping my buns tight. Lose sight of what you believe. And call it a night. This ain't the light-weight, cake mix shit. That you're used to. Teflon territory you just can't shoot through. You going shoot who? (Who?). Not even on your best day. Rollin' the Wild West way, givin' it up. Leavin' the whole world stuck not givin' a fuck. Laid in the cut now we break through in the rut. Hennesy and Orange Juice baby fill up a cup. Quick to grab Mary Jane by the butt and squeeze. Loosen up, let your hair down, and join the festivities. Overcrowd the house like lockdown facilities. Bitches be quick to give me brains while I post the range. Going up and down my dick like the stock exchange. 1 - (X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound. (X) Won't even say your own name when I come around. (X) Stay on top but remain from the underground. (X) to the Z and we all in the family. (2x). Ever since Xzibit could speak, been on some pimp shit. Approach every woman like a potential mistress. Shine bright, make sure that X stay tight. Cause tonight I might meet my next X wife. Mr. Big Chief Reefa, Xzibit use his dick like a Visa. I run it through and money come out. Runnin' your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your house. Ravel your spouse and have a little fun on the couch. Now you know that it was bound to happen. I came to give you what you lackin'. Whenever you hear them other niggas rappin. Rockin' chains, stadium, paladiums, cracked craniums. My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium. Drop tops sittin' on twenties. Using rappers like crash test dummies. Stackin' real estate and money. It's funny how things change overnight. When you thinking right. I beat the odds like Ike beat on his first wife. Repeat 1. Want an event?. We're hardcore 100%. Making this dick Los Angeles proudly present. The real deal, how does it feel?. No special effects. Yank the chain off of your neck. Demand the respect. Now all your conversations sound strange to me. Seems like everybody around me done changed but me. I stand alone on my own two feet. Stab a track, strangle the beat. Restless no time for sleep. Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Bejamin Gray. It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend. Straight to the chair. (Not these niggas again). Come back, bounce in the spot and slide right in. I ain't trying to see nothing but progress, regardless. Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious. Represent nothing but the hustle and struggle. Hennesy, rock plenty of ice, making a double, now SCREAM. Repeat 1. [Snoop Dogg]. So there you have it. A-B-C D-P-G-C. X to the motherfuckin' Z. Mr. Xuberant, Xtravagant. Xtrodinary, Xciting, X-alotta. X 'em with a little bit of Xtasy. X-ing a bitch out if you tryna test a g. And what's the recipe?. Xcalibur weaponary. And we shoot Xceptionally. That day is hot.

Showed you how to tie a flag on your head. and represent your motherfuckin set 'til you're dead. Bust on the cops while I cuss the Feds. Roll a joint, in the bathtub gettin head.

They cut me loose in nine-deuce I swore to tell the whole truth. Keep it gangbang 100 proof. E'rybody say, ""Ay Snoop"" - did Death Row pay me?. Look here young loc, shit it's all to the gravy. I really can't trip off the past, on the real I had a blast. Tupac, rest in peace and God bless all my enemies. [Chorus: KoKane]. Rain-drops, falling on my head.

I moved out the hood like I should (say what?). And then they had the nerve to call me Hollywood (nigga what?). But I don't give a fuck, if I'm misunderstood. 20 Crip don't slip, yeah it's all to the good. Yeah the homies got twist too, whatchu say?. Oh the homies might get me? They'll get you. Listen here, don't try it, and don't deny it. And don't pay 'em no mind Dogg, man I'm tryin. [Chorus w/ variations]. [Snoop Dogg]. Just when you thought I was gone, I'm back on. Knick-knack-paddy-wack give the Dogg a home. with a gang of pitbulls, rottweilers and doberman pinschers. Bonafied killers. The illest, cap peelers, that you ever wanna meet. Straight up out the ghetto where they pack the heavy metal. I got my hand on the wheel, my foot on the gas pedal. I'm drivin DoggHouse to the next level (woof). and buckin two shots at the devil. Run up on his ass, and blast, like a rebel. Turn up the treble cause I hit you with the bass. Remember my name and remember my face. Remember these words, and remember the taste. And remember, we all gotta leave this place. I'm tryin to stay focused, I'm the loc'est in the game. The Rap Prime Minister, ""Mr. G Thang"". [Chorus Two: KoKane]. Rain-drops, fallin on my head. Fuckin with the wrong folks, messin with my spread. Talkin bout the raindrops, fallin on my head.

you never know,"(Snoop). Got a little something for the summertime. While you on the grind. Getting yours. Hell yeah! I'm getting mine. I take trips and dips just to recline. I blaze up the orange weed. To relax my mind. Spend time with my kids on the weekdays. And I holla at my momma and my. Grandma on the threeway. She say, If you do right. Baby boy I promise you live. A long life. I can't argue. I try hard to. Not blast niggas. I walk past niggas. With my head up to the skedai(sky). Nigga tried to pull a fast one. On Snoop Dogg. To get some shut eye. What I do to him I can't speak. You know the episode. And the code on the street. I keep it all the scriffin' y'all. But real street for y'all. Cause you never know. When you're gonna go, no. (Chorus). You never know where this road's gonna take you. Got to be strong. You got to hold on. Cause you never know, where. This life's gonna lead you. Just Hold on. You never know. (Warren G). >From the killing. The robbing. The squabbing. And jacking. Car jacks to kidnaps. What? Niggas be acting a fool. Trying to set me up at the park. But I'm cool. Act a fool. My daddy said throw them thangs. And stay strong. My momma got sick. So I'ma keep it strong. As long as I got my feet in the game. And make this beats. And bring heat to the game. Fuck the fame. I got a little boy to see through. And him without me. Is like me without you. Keep it true. And stay down for your grips. Homies and licks staying tight. Like this. You never know. (Chorus). (Phats Bossi). You niggas never know. Which man are blasted for. Never know which man to kill. Just to settle the score. It wasn't long ago. I had this partner of mine. Knew him just a short time. But he's stuck in my mind. My nigga lived perfect. Said the streets wasn't worth it. If you don't die rich in the game. Then what's the purpose for this struggle?. We stay piece to puzzle. Invest half the wealth. And pray to god it double. We just in this. Trying to get rich at the interest. Keep it pimping. Stay with niggas that's relentless. Smoke dough. Just because I say so. Money pronto. And niggas never would know. They never know nigga. (Chorus til fades)."
you thought,"--Soopafly--. I had this bitch locked on to me like she was way too clever. Man, Soopafly never ever ever. Fell for the do no and you know I'm. Too swift on my toes and the gifts of hoez. It's too much for me to be givin' to you. Uh, all I'm givin' is some dick in you. Now Sh????, I told the bitch to blaze the weed. Now she blazed it but that ain't all she blew. Hey, I got knocked off on the bar. And my room got knocked off in the car. Gave it to me until I reached my peak. Baby flip talkin' bout lovin' me in the week. I said that's too damn quick, and too damn fast. You've been givin' up too much damn cock and givin up too much ass. Nah nah nah you ain't gettin' me like that. Soopafly ain't even called the bitch back. Ever since she tripped, I went on one. Stepped in the club, Caught me a homerun. Baby was bad and all, she said gimme a call. I wanted to break that bitch like a law. Picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth. Talkin' bout what could pop out and hit the roof. Then she said somethin bout the cost. Man, that same bus stop is where. I dropped that bitch back the fuck off. You can't ride my bird. So I kicked that bitch to the curb. You best to believe. You ain't got no trick up your sleeve that can get with me. You thought you had my grip. But Soopafly never ever slips. You thought you had my cash. Till I turned around and whupped yo' ass. ....like a pimp and that's for real. --Snoop Dogg--. I came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe lookin' too cute. Tryin' to get my shoot on, so I'm a scoot on. Over to the next bitch, say her name is Texas. She fly but she wasn't the sexiest. She had a hoe with her named Bama, short for Alabama. A big bad mama-jamma, now look here. I like big bitches cause they large. And big bitches always take charge. Wanna grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg. Cause you like it tall, go and work it baby doll. Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of. Got alot of cash for a little love. All they wanna do is take you down to the mall. Floss a little dick and get a t-shirt that say miss Snoop Dogg. I don't see a god damn thang. That's stoppin you from buying me that god damn ring. It'd look nice on my finger, I'm a buy you a zinger. Cause you make me feel like a real hip-hop singer. Your homegirl, bring her cause I've been dying to meet her. You know I won't cheat her, don't mistreat her. She only get the dick, I'll never ever eat her. But I'll drop her ass cause you know I don't need her.... It was fun while it lasted. You know what they say, big things come in small packages, baby. You thought you had my grip. But Snoop Dogg never ever slips. You thought you had my cash. Until I turned around and whupped your ass. ....trick beyotch beyotch. --Too $hort--. I said beyyyotch, what are you smokin. A big fat dick comin' from east Oakland. There must be some kind of misunderstanding. Hit the parking lot, bitch I be standing by the Benz. You think a nigga rich, bitch. Gold diggin' tramps tryin' to get with this dick. For all the wrong reasons. Niggas ain't trippin' during pimp season. But you still jumped your fast ass in anyway. If any other nigga picked you up it'd be payday. I rolled to my house with the bitch. (What'd you do $hort) introduced her mouth to my dick. Glad to meet you, make yourself comfortable. You fuckin' with a dog, bitch you ain't fin' to come up, hoe. So you might as well enjoy the ride. And serve this nigga from the eastside. How much for the game that I'm sellin'. Ain't no tellin' like Jack told Helen. I know sex sells but I'm a tell you though. Couldn't spend on shit that ain't valuable. Fucked all night woke up the next mornin'. Told her I'm a pimp but the bitch kept on. Wantin' me to do somethin' for the time she spent. It's funny, cause now she can't find the rent money. You thought you had my grip. But Too $hort never ever slips. You thought you had my cash. Until I turned around and whupped your ass. ....trick beyotch beyotch. ...I got family members, homeboys.... Muthafuckaz I look out way before you.."
