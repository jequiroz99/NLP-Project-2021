We don't need water (let the motherfucker burn). [Chorus]. [Yung Joc]. Ha ha, 5 4 3 2, R-2-D-2. Let me see your robot, a little dance that we do. Pyrite, no left, I'm hype, with no help.

Niggaz run in, kick the do', fuck a do' knock. Gotta make the quarter, I mix it with the soda. I chop the dope and sell it with the Razor Motorola.

[Chorus]. [Yung Joc]. Party like a rockstar, better yet, block bar. Lighter to the ceiling, grab a beer, pop the top boi. I.F. so clear, freezer burn both ears. Elders say ""Oh dear"" when they hear I'm near. Rubber burn first gear, platinum on my first year. Wood on my sheer, put my wood all in her grill. Roof on fire, sound the alarm. We don't need water (let the motherfucker burn). [Chorus]. [Yung Joc]. Ha ha, 5 4 3 2, R-2-D-2. Let me see your robot, a little dance that we do. Pyrite, no left, I'm hype, with no help. On cloud 9 - heart racin like Corvette. I need a material girl in a material world. Give me slim on the backseat of my Imperial girl. Go and show me what you work with, girl that's a perfect fit. Hold up, stop, it hurts when you twist it. [Chorus - to fade]"

Respect game young nigga, tell them haters so long. [Yung Joc]. You can call me Malcolm X, I hustle by any means. Take the blow, break it down, weigh it on triple beams. I'll cook it, I'll whip it, I'll ship it, I'll flip it. I'll rock 'til the motherfuckin feds come knockin. The owner of the hand, I can be the middleman.

This game about to drop, shit I'm 'bout to bless niggaz. I tell 'em no cheating's allowed, eyes on your test nigga. I graduated with honors cause see I was the best nigga. Two plus two don't equal fo' in my world. Seventeen five get your ass thirty-six o's of that girl. Okay class let's settle down (shhh) you better pay attention. Cause I bet the class clown end up in federal detention. And when I say detention I ain't talkin after school. Cause if you're slippin on your pimpin you'll be rockin county blues. Quit trickin on these hoes, man they guaranteed to choose. Stop trigger your re-up or you're guaranteed to lose. Guarantee you slicker with your hustle, do it like the mob do. Learn to talk in code, learn to keep the law up off you. Cause you niggaz keep snitchin, and hoes keep talkin. Either they throw away the ki' or they gon' put you in a coffin. [Chorus One + Chorus Two]. [Yung Joc]. Hahahahahaha. If you made it to this portion of the album. Give yourselves a round of applause man.

Date an international chick now I'm landin them. International suites now I'm stayin in them. International freaks I'm playin with them. I can porco hoes, hit the sand with them. We fuck all night then I abandon them. Take a top model chick to the cabin man. Call me freaky Jason, get to stabbin man. She call a few friends, run a caravan. I call a few friends, I love sharin man. [Chorus]. [Yung Joc]. You see I ball all day up in Amsterdam. Nigga Swiss Miss chick and smoke half a gram. She love takin snapshots on the phone cam. Knockin out a ringtone that's a jam. I see shit that every nigga don't see. I bang Brazil broads under the palm tree. Convinced her to skip town, just her and me. Hit the P and bank exchange my currency. Now my flight leaves at 9, I can't be late. Got a big dollar date somewhere back in the states. M-I-A yo or Cuban bistro. Feel the wind blow, from the seasho'. Six hour flight back to the West coast. Somewhere swank where Tyra Banks gettin close. Or Eva Pickford, I really dig her. I got some nerve to take this picture. [Chorus]. [Yung Joc]. Now you don't have to like what I do. I'ma do me, and you do you. I say that you don't have to like the way I ride. I'm a G, and I gets mine.

Time to change clothes, we Bathing Ape it. This lavish lifestyle, I can't escape it. Leave no paper trail, the feds can't trace it. Blow a couple hundred thou' around the world, let's make it. Now you don't have to like what I do. I'ma do me, and you do you. I say that you don't have to like the way I ride. I'm a G, and I gets mine. [Chorus]"

momma,"[Yung Joc]. Ay you know what, eh-heh. When I started recordin this album. I said I wasn't gonna do a, y'know dear momma type of record but. I felt the need to cause ahhh I wanna express how I feel about my momma. But at the same time I wanted y'all to know that. if I ever found a woman out there that, was anything like my momma. SHIT~! I got to have her. [Chorus: Jazze Pha]. Ain't another girl on this earth, like my momma. But if I find that girl, I'ma make her my woman. If I find another girl, like my momma. I can go unconditional love 'til they take me under. [Yung Joc]. Gyeah; first thing first, where do I start. This feeling that I'm feeling is real it's not a facade. The angel that I call momma was sent by God. Been through thick and thin, better times, even hard. Raisin two boys in the ghetto wasn't easy. Shit was goin wrong but she made it seem peachy. Yeah she worked long hours, whether rain and the freezin. Pulled out the Vicks vapor rub when I was sneezin. When the kid laid her off and the rent was past due. Mom was a O.G., did what she had to. I got kicked out of school, she had to talk to my principal. Yeah she kicked my ass, but her love is unconditional. I love my momma. [Chorus]. [Yung Joc]. Yo, yo. I remember - my first BMX, she showed me how to ride. She used to lick her thumb to wipe the cold out my eyes. Oh yeah I can't forget her cookin how it stick to my ribs. She could take Spam and make a first class meal. When my nigga Steve, me and her both cried. And when I got locked up, she bailed me out every time. Guess I'll never know how she remained so strong. Received Medicaid and food stamps for so long. We was section 8 all the way 'til I was grown. She played both roles, king and queen of the throne. I'm not exaggeratin, not even to the slightest. This came from the heart, so I ain't even have to write it. I love my momma. [Chorus]. [Yung Joc]. I'ma try to stop the music one time. Want y'all to clap with me, c'mon. Now if you love your momma clap yo' hands. If you love your momma clap yo' hands (aww yeah~!). If you love your momma clap yo' hands. If you love your momma clap yo' hands (aww yeah~!). Shorty, I brought you in this world, I'll take you out. You said it when you caught me skippin school, makin out. Momma you stayed down, you never faked it. Stayed by my side when they thought I wouldn't make it. And when I had a son, they said I need a job. That's when you told me son, just follow your heart. And so I did that, I went through all the drama. So I just wanna take this time to say I love you momma. [Chorus]"

Yeah, I got plenty Hoes. Life ain't picture perfect. Yeah ya see the ice. And I dress nice. Make 'em look twice. Life ain't picture perfect. Yeah I'm blowin on some good lime. Skatin on two 85's. Wouldn't believe half the shit thats skatin through a niggas mind. 745 complimented with leather and wood. Chickens on my dick cuz a nigga fresh and smellin good. Jack boys plottin on my stacks on deck. Wanna put the Tec to my chest for the ice on my neck. Oh yeah it's easy to attain it all. Harder to maintain it all. If you want a pierfect picture only god can paint it dog. Niggas in these videos with multi-platinum projects. Can't even get credit cards. And they Momma stay in projects. How is that? Scracth my head. Somethin don't seem right. Ya teeth full of ice. So when ya smile I seen lights. Seems like I'm hatin I'm just statin the facts.

Yeah I'm off in magic city. Trickin them ass and titties. Bitches blowin me kisses makin me wanna hit it. I must admit, got a good chick and she been holdin me down. But I ain't fuckin around cuz there is too much shit goin around. Like the rims on my pickup. Scared to get my dick sucked. Nigga run into the clinic even from a hiccup. Pick up the pieces from the fuckin puzzle. I'm affiliated with niggas who murder, rob and hustle. Plus you think I'm ballin cuz I'm poppin Crys and spendin G's. I'm just tryin to drink away the pain that killed my nigga steve. Nigga please, I ain't shit. Cookies and cream. Feelin like Marvin it make me wanna holla and scream. [Chorus x2]. Now half the shit ya doin already been done. And that's why half my niggas dead, locked up or on the run. That dope money ain't sufficient it don't last all ways. Niggas trap all night in project hallways. All day long niggas front like stars. On them big ass rims that most than they cars. Spent 300 on a outfit a hundred on some nikes. But his baby needs wopes, diapers and pedialite. And you prolly' got a cousin, brother or a friend. And this song sound like it from begging to end. Then again it might be me. And I'm tired of the nonsense. Can't sleep at night cause I got a guilty conscience. [Chorus x2]. [Background:] Cant you see? [over and over until it fades out]"

First album platinum plaques, now watch it glisten. The baddest broads, The fastest cars. I'm sure a lot of niggas wish this life was yours. But since it ain't, y'all niggas said I can't. Y'all laughed about my dance, I walked it out the bank (Ha ha). Now I'ma let it happen cause we ain't gotta start. Haters mad at me cause I'm on my job. I congratulate you, somebody's gotta do it. I'm not mad, I'm used to it. And if you feel the same, then you's a friend of mine. Won't you tell the lames? Don't get out of line. [Chorus]. [Hook]. Play your cards [x17]. Don't get out of line hoe [x6]. [Verse 2]. Call it Hustlenomics, hustle by any means. I got a lot of hustle, a whole lot of schemes. And not enough fingers for me to count on. My stock's way up, call me Dow Jones. I been around the world, in almost every hood. I walk in anywhere, my face card is very good. And they don't play round down in H-Town. Take ya to the bottom, I'm talkin Dade county. I'll take you out west in them low lows. You scared to rep your set, that's a no no. I take you back to the A-Town, head down. Play round, I'll make them boys make you lay it down. [Chorus]. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. I need a bottom bitch, one who pays attention. Respect the grind, respect my intuition. Don't get out of line, Just look and listen. And soon you'll find I'm what you been missing. And the bottom line is I'm on the clock. 24/7, the hustle don't stop. Yeah I'm from the A, that's my stomping grounds. But if you on your job, we stand on common grounds. [Chorus]. [Hook]. [Outro]. Ay, Cool & Dre. Y'all know what it is. Hustle or get hustled, nigga.

Extreme precaution cause its slippery when wet. Baby let me be yo ringtone we'll call it phone sex. [Chorus: male female]. Let me be yo ringtone. You can be my ringtone. Baby let me sing a song. Baby you can sing a song. When I ring.... When you ring.... Yo phone. My phone. [Chorus: female male]. Yes you can be my ringtone. I can be yo ringtone. Baby come & sing a song. Baby ima sing a song.

Got me flow like im on X. I hear ya boy ""she's a beast"". Sweat drip from my Jesus peace. Keep that thang like she's a beast. Dick so good you grit yo teeth. Eat this pussy like a feast on yo knees like you a preist. You & me between the sheets. [Both:]. Damn it 7 days a week. [Chorus: male female]. Let me be yo ringtone. You can be my ringtone. Baby let me sing a song"
show stopper,"hook- group- shannon lead vocal]. We in the car, we ride slow. We doin' things that the girls don't do. The boys stare, we smile back. All my girls in the rainbow cadillacs, yeah.
