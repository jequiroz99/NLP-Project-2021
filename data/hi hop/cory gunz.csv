On the 4th, Wessons go off at your fannies. And I want every cranny, and I'mma be grit. For every Grammy, and I did it with shit, not even Mammy. You hear me?. Had to let that bitch breathe... Fuck it, let's suffocate her cause I waited long enough. I'm on this nigga's heels, I'm just waiting on the cuff. Threw it to him smooth, but it blew it through him rough. Pull out some shit Suge-height, jerk like Puff. Toughs like bluffs, bring the uptight stuff. Fight what? I fuck fights up. Abrupt dice luck cause a nigga Niks scuffed. Corrupt heist bucks cause a nigga life cuffs. And that's how I write stuff, making niggas bite dust. Aiite, what... I'm rapping like M, Jigga, Kool G. A pinch of Fugees, grouped in Nas and his kufi. My group the groupies are like wet bottoms to roofies. You can be the new G, seen first in that v-neck Coogi. When that tech loogie, hacht-pooie. No lock, just pop and drop like Huey. These haties' ladies see me coming on that kaka doodie. To me, you sushi, chewy and tooshie. I'm bad like Boosie. Rap to me is easy as apple-picking is to baboonsies. I baloon his goons and lay them lead with that strap. It'll leave you scrappy, Scoobie. Act the movie, ain't what he shat, but it kept him rolling. My swag is. So overpotent, I rap like I'm overloading. Convulsions doing exploding imploding foes. And reloading foes back. I keep shit going all lax why the fuck they fronting? I'm back. The fuck they wanting with that?. Just keep mine coming in stacks. And repeat your thumb in your ass cuz you fucked yourself. Iller than some are real and I'm trill enough for the South. '88 New Yorker nigga, old school grill in his mouth. No school blocking my route. Pro Tools truck and I'm out. Those rules drop and I'm out. Position her like a stool then we pool drop in her mouth. Militia we ain't playing. MC'ing we ain't banging. Quiet riot what you saying? Green. Ha ha ha ha ha yes on the set like a bet. Who the next guest best the shit I express. Too much to ingest like incest being confessed. Lingo I possess can infest the nest. You manifest, blessed, your chest compressed. Can be digested, following a drive by. Like let's get high, eyes get tested. Lives get hectic, guys' wives get pipe-necked. Besides refreshments, I can't imagine any more than poor misfortune. Forming porking if I'm forking he's an orphan. Dwarfed and morphed into a short and awkward vulture. On the ? kind of raucous. Hit the stork like skip the door bitch it's important. Stripper store, pop a cork for Cory Culkin. Whore a story walking glory talking. For a Maury Povich audience. I'm annoying, I'm employing so I'm enjoying. Employing my shit's a dime on top of another nine. This rock could your mother climb. Shit popped another ?. Gets dropped for some other ? to get flipped for other tops. But bitch, a lot of niggas hella copped my swag. And trying to raise the race green and never clocked my drag"
