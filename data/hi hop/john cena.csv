my time is now,"[Chorus: John Cena]. Your time is up, my time is now. You can't see me, my time is now. It's the franchise, boy I'm shinin now. You can't see me, my time is now!. [John Cena]. In case you forgot or fell off I'm still hot - knock your shell off. My money stack fat plus I can't turn the swell off. The franchise, doin big bid'ness, I live this. It's automatic I win this - oh you hear those horns, you finished. A soldier, and I stay under you fightin. Plus I'm stormin on you chumps like I'm thunder and lightning. Ain't no way you breakin me kid, I'm harder than nails. Plus I keep it on lock, like I'm part of the jail. I'm slaughterin stale, competition, I got the whole block wishin. they could run with my division but they gone fishin -. - with no bait, kid your boy hold weight. I got my soul straight, I brush your mouth like Colgate. In any weather I'm never better your boy's so hot. you'll never catch me in the next man's sweater. If they hate, let 'em hate, I drop ya whole clan. Lay yo' ass DOWN for the three second TAN. [Chorus]. [Tha Trademarc]. Yeah, uhh. It's gon' be what it's gon' be. Five pounds of courage buddy, bass tint pants with a gold T. Uhh - it's a war dance and victory step. A raw stance is a gift, when you insist it's my rep. John Cena, Trademarc, y'all are so-so. And talk about the bread you make but don't know the recipe for dough though. Aimin guns in all your photos, that's a no-no. When this pop, you'll liplock, your big talk's a blatant no-show. See what happens when the ice age melt. You see monetary status is not what matters, but it helps. I rock a timepiece by Benny if any. The same reason y'all could love me is the same reason y'all condemn me. A man's measured by the way that he thinks. Not clothing lines, ice links, leather and minks. I spent 20 plus years seekin knowledge of self. So for now Marc Predka's livin live for wealth. [Chorus] - repeat 2X"

Now they on about shovels in the weight of the ground. What now?. Preachin on the way that they handle thing. Watin patiently to do the 6-foot Same Thing. Now, so I take a second look at my life. I made too many mistakes that I just couldn`t make. right. Should've been more focused than I take things light. When I'm gone this is what ya'll will say I was like. American fool, no not that baddest or cool. Just a big fish caught up in the shallowish pool. Not a big name playa, in fact its true. Never wanted this shit without the kats he knew. He got lucky rode the co-tails of everyones fame. In two weeks aint nobody gon' rememba his name. Fuck It. I'm ready to go, I done made records. Made monetary often that flow.

I been quiet for too long, the truth should be heard. It was a while back, 10:20 in the morn'. Kat should up on my lawn in the rug-ed uniform. Unexpected, theres a knock on my door. I met this fool in the club, I don' see him before. Open to great him, but the second he sees me. His eyes buckle, his voice is uneasy. But it's cool, I didn't even catch it at first. I check his shoulder, homie's rockin a purse. Now I know something's tricky, but I'm already sittin. down. Homie pipes up, you should hear what he's spittin out. Says I've been sleepin wit his wifey. And he ain't the type of kat to take that shit. lightly. I made a move and he told me homie wait. Reached in his purse pulled a chrome 38. He asked me if I'm ready to die. Said he was gonna pull my brains all over the sky. Said he was leavin the country, and he was straight. with the passports. Cocked the hammer, I'm thinkin my last thoughts. I'm in a bad way, nothin could save this.. I close my eyes hopin it's painless. Just waitin for the sound, ready to swallow too. But homie havin trouble with his follow through. By a miracle, I avoid the chalk ground. Homie's confused, he just wanna be talked down. His wife is sleepin through town and he knew it. Picked me outta the crowd but couldn't do it. Just lost it, and as he's walkin away. I realize life is short so I'm markin the day. Now it's full speed ahead, I'll rest when I'm dead. And I could give a Fuck what the next man said. I live how I wanna live. Buy what I wanna buy. Do what I wanna do. Try What I wanna try. Fear nothin, take chances. Not afraid to fail, always makin advances. So when I ride on the Grim Reaper Highway. No regrets bitch, I did it my way. Yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah). What Would You Do If It All Ended Tomorrow?. Time Runnin Out, Ain't No One You Can Borrow.

this is how we roll,"[Chorus: repeat 2X]. Wheels is shinin.. deals we signin.. money's pilin... Low, this is how we roll. [John Cena]. Catch me in the black 'llac truck with the pickup back. The game weak, I'ma pick up slack. Hands high like a stick-up jack, fuck your boring rap. This East to West coast hittin like Warren Sapp. I'm fully focused, I walk with a purpose. Y'all are fuckin clowns, you belong in a circus. This is big bid'ness, we don't stop 'til the money home. Block shakin more buzz than a honeycomb. And I'm a savage in the booth. I'm on some movement shit, about to rally up the youth. Number one seed daddy walkin through the playoffs. You better quit rappin 'fore I start makin layoffs. Fuck a day off, I'm movin heavy for the payoff. You don't ride to this? We don't need you, stay off. Hate on this? I don't care what you said. Y'all can choke on a shit sandwich with no bread. [Chorus]. [Tha Trademarc]. I don't smile as such, buddy, ain't much funny. You touchy girlie rappers claimin that you fuckin gully. I live poor but look rich, I hit raw, you look bitch. You love me, that's why you got your style from me. Most sayin Marc Predka's overconfident. It's only cause they jeally that my profile is prominent. The dominant factor is the money I'm after. Your opinion ain't mean shit buddy - I ain't ask ya. It's gon' be what it's gon' be. It is what it is and was what it was so watch ya wordplay. Trademarc lay you where the buzzards and birds play. I write rhymes 'til ya boy is heard mayne. Cause alls I got, is my voice and word. Sophisticated rapper the dapper lover the don. It's on baby pah yeah word is bond. Cut the check and I'll rock, every word of the song - what now?. [Chorus]. [John Cena]. Yeah, yeah... yeah. I got that velcro flow, I'll make you stick to this. So many zeroes, my monetary is ridiculous. A glass of Chardonnay doesn't whine like you. I'm an Altered Beast with Einstein's IQ. Plus I shine bright too and I ride right through. In a leaned out, old school, skylight blue. I don't think there's a player nice. Keep your Cristal, I'm shoot Jagermeister. Foot to the floor and you ain't you keep the pace. Throw me a whore and call me Kobe cause you know that I'ma beat the case. I buy some land, and never even see the place. Vegeterian chicks, go on givin meat a taste. Throw away money like I hate on loot. Copped your CD it sounds great on mute. Words turn 'em to dust makin MC's disintergrate. My name get traffic like the California interstate, what?. [Chorus].

know the rep,"[Freddie Foxxx a.k.a. Bumpy Knuckles]. Hahahaha.... Y'all know the rep, yeah, listen. My name is Bumpy Knuckles, I write that fuckin flame. And kill for the right price I got a buckin name. My forty caliber too fresh, stuck in aim. We roll like 18 wheelers in the truckin game. I'm nice with mics there's nothin more I like. than to paralyze your left side and leave you all right. I be layin front of your crib with Tec-y all night. Tryin to get them 9 millimeters loaded up tight, listen. I'm like a Cadillac, I write a battle rap. so smooth contest you'll be out of that. Y'all know the beef is stewin, that Bumpy came to ruin. You may be signed but you don't know what the fuck you doin. I make aight hot, I make dope raw. And send you higher than a long Colt four-four. You know the only rap pimp that kept a ho poor. And slam a fool on his back and break the whole floor. [Chorus: Bumpy Knuckles]. A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop. We keep on, once the cops are gone. This is real street spit you best be warned. Tell your favorite MC the mic is on. A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop. We keep on, once the cops are gone. [John Cena]. Yeah, yeah. It's the J daddy, not Hov' or Jam Master. My mic is correct, but y'all know the hands faster. See you bitch rappers I'm attackin the pile. Y'all be cryin foul cause I'm hackin your style. I make sure you and your mans done. When I see y'all both drop, I'm the cat screamin And1. You see me on the team dog you know the game's over. Stones on my wrist, and a chip on my shoulder. Sixteens cashin in on another hot beat. Go cop me a drop with the butterscotch seats. And we better not meet, if we do you gon' see a change. Make sure you whole FACE gettin rearranged. We rollin up in the blacked out truck dog. It's Freddie Foxxx, now you deal with Corrupt Mob. It's gas on the fire, any time a track blaze. Squad known to beef up the Heat, just like the Shaq trade. [Tha Trademarc]. This my 9 to 5, this ain't no hobby cat. Copycat killers bite styles, my rhyme piles is heavy. Give me a beat, man I'll body that. Spittin that heat street raps man they nod to that. What you smilin at? You R&B, man that's hardly rap. You lost the beat, man you bought a map. Matter fact, here's my next rap, borrow that. Been off the street too long, I want my corner back. You ain't a player, you a armchair quarterback. You ride the beat like side streets on a flat. Don't play dumb, I know where you came from. You only seen slugs buddy after the rain come. Keep it subtle, Trademarc got you bitch. like babies suckin tits talkin 'bout mami let's cuddle. It's gon' be what it's gon' be, you duck down. A quiet cat with a violent rap, what now?. [Chorus]"
don't fuck with us,"[John Cena]. We keep it hoppin like the cars with the shocks. We spittin heat on your block. We new to the game, but runnin the spot. Numbin your knot, with basslines that'll make ya neck break. This rook'll take your queen and put ya king in checkmate. Open your mind without makin ya meditate. We real champs; y'all just featherweight. Time to get it straight, I push your wig back. Crew loaded up with extra bread like a Big Mac. Beefin with us? We're leavin you face down. Stompin bitch rappers like I'm straight outta A-Town. Runnin the playground like it was a track meet. Shoes on the whip that be bigger than Shaq's feet. We into big things, bank account's overgrown. All types of cheese - swiss, cheddar, provolone. Guaranteed to burn wax like candles. Track hittin hard to the head like shots of Jack Daniels. [Chorus 2X: John Cena]. Y'all, bitch, crews, don't wanna fuck with us. Y'all bound, to, lose, another one bites the dust. [Tha Trademarc]. It's Trademarc the truth, laid back, aloof. I'm God, as if you needed some proof. You ain't hard I can see it on you, {?}. Fuck a droptop, crop if I'm creepin on you. Click-clack nickelback knickknacks if you got heaters on you. Spittin back live rounders, with five pounders. If we meetin on two, I put a beatin on you. Your sound's tired buddy, that's why I'm sleepin on you. We lean back in the ride, with cream stackin the rawhide. The sound of God slide with a raw vibe. Straight military camel clothes ash brown boots. So sick, I've been handlin flows, since enamel was gold tooth. And branded by low. You cold fuck like eskimo hoes at 7 below. You slow, you be the last to think. My hands seen more fuckin dirt than bathroom sinks. [Chorus]. [John Cena]. I got punks, dumps and switches, dump chumpses bitches. We feed you to the sharks, you can sleep with the fishes. Clean you like dishes but I ain't no busboy. You ain't family, you ain't earnin my trust boy. Seen too many bitches that'll double cross ya. We bring more drama than the Laker roster. Get the click pissed, ain't nobody can save ya. Throw heat without lookin like Fernando Valenzuela. [Tha Trademarc]. Marc Predka's the name, the rest of you lame. I'm ego drivin, seen with different women, every size and frame. I refine my game by fuckin famous bitches. But it's all the same, it's just ex to the next. for sex or brain, misses or Mrs.. Married or not, my game don't stop. It's cars bars bonds and stocks you ain't see my flow. Y'all are small-time suckers like a knee-high hoe. [Chorus]"
"bad, bad man","[John Cena]. Aww, you done did it now. Chaos you shoulda put this one in the vault man!. They not ready - they don't know what's comin man!. Oh we gonna drop this on 'em right here. Y'all ain't ready for this, Y'ALL AIN'T READY FOR NONE OF THIS!. Your boy's a bad man, and we invadin the streets. Make unclever rappers scurred, they be droppin the heat. Shocked the world, now I'm standin alone. I flip fools like them clamshell cellular phones. You can't help but nod your head to the track. Fuck the watered down rap, we be takin it back. Give it to me straight - ain't no chasin it. Check yourself in the mirror - ain't no facin it. Cause you, playin the role and you plannin to fold. This the masterplan, we got the planet on hold. We all over the streets like your favorite sneaker. Breakin up your sound like a drive-through speaker. Everything that I be spittin is strong. After I rock, fast forward through the rest of the song. We the monkeywrench, that's gonna ruin your plan. And don't fuck with John Cena - I'm a BAD, BAD MAN. [Chorus 2X: Bumpy Knuckles]. With the mic in my hands I'm a bad man. Even in a fight with the hands I'm a bad man. Livin in the streets all my life I'm a bad man. I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man. [Tha Trademarc]. We devils - rockin ambient levels. We set loose among hot tunes to instrumentals. And cats got one-liners, I drop several. And I think it's funny you choose, losin progress. or runnin in place; we makin moves, and y'all settle. I rip rappers and take responsibility. for makin future hall-of-famers look third rate. Y'all are lost for words like conversation on your worst first date. and ride beats, creep through side streets. Looseleaf notepads that's where rhymes leak. Punchlines - man, don't even beg. I got knee-slappin tracks, y'all brusin your leg. You a rhyme writer - funny man, that's a joke. You ain't worthy of bein my secretary man that's a quote. I flood tracks like cracks in boats. And pussy rappers choked up with they own lines in they throat. [Chorus]. [Bumpy Knuckles a.k.a. Freddie Foxxx]. TURN UP THE MICROPHONE and see me I'm a beast. MC's and they beats is what I eat, 16 I'll leave you in the street. My rhymes are sicker than gangrene in both feet. It's spreadin up the leg, and headed for the head. Your rhymes are whack your style is proof that the brain corrosion. is fuckin with your chosen flows, I'm nice with mics. My hands'll break your nose like Mikey Tyson. Fightin in his prime, one rhyme. And I shake up the room one time, BOOM! To the jaw. Your face is a coat type raw. And the blood and snot they mix, jelly on the floor. My love is cop them bricks, belly on the floor. I rob you, you soft and you really ain't a problem. I solve you, 357 long nose revolve you. Acid in your face, bad look, dissolve you. I'm a bad, bad man. Yeah, check it out. It's Bumpy Knuckles baby. And I want you to say hello to the BAD, BAD, MAN - C'MON!. [Chorus]"

don't fuck with us,"[John Cena]. We keep it hoppin like the cars with the shocks. We spittin heat on your block. We new to the game, but runnin the spot. Numbin your knot, with basslines that'll make ya neck break. This rook'll take your queen and put ya king in checkmate. Open your mind without makin ya meditate. We real champs; y'all just featherweight. Time to get it straight, I push your wig back. Crew loaded up with extra bread like a Big Mac. Beefin with us? We're leavin you face down. Stompin bitch rappers like I'm straight outta A-Town. Runnin the playground like it was a track meet. Shoes on the whip that be bigger than Shaq's feet. We into big things, bank account's overgrown. All types of cheese - swiss, cheddar, provolone. Guaranteed to burn wax like candles. Track hittin hard to the head like shots of Jack Daniels. [Chorus 2X: John Cena]. Y'all, bitch, crews, don't wanna fuck with us. Y'all bound, to, lose, another one bites the dust. [Tha Trademarc]. It's Trademarc the truth, laid back, aloof. I'm God, as if you needed some proof. You ain't hard I can see it on you, {?}. Fuck a droptop, crop if I'm creepin on you. Click-clack nickelback knickknacks if you got heaters on you. Spittin back live rounders, with five pounders. If we meetin on two, I put a beatin on you. Your sound's tired buddy, that's why I'm sleepin on you. We lean back in the ride, with cream stackin the rawhide. The sound of God slide with a raw vibe. Straight military camel clothes ash brown boots. So sick, I've been handlin flows, since enamel was gold tooth. And branded by low. You cold fuck like eskimo hoes at 7 below. You slow, you be the last to think. My hands seen more fuckin dirt than bathroom sinks. [Chorus]. [John Cena]. I got punks, dumps and switches, dump chumpses bitches. We feed you to the sharks, you can sleep with the fishes. Clean you like dishes but I ain't no busboy. You ain't family, you ain't earnin my trust boy. Seen too many bitches that'll double cross ya. We bring more drama than the Laker roster. Get the click pissed, ain't nobody can save ya. Throw heat without lookin like Fernando Valenzuela. [Tha Trademarc]. Marc Predka's the name, the rest of you lame. I'm ego drivin, seen with different women, every size and frame. I refine my game by fuckin famous bitches. But it's all the same, it's just ex to the next. for sex or brain, misses or Mrs.. Married or not, my game don't stop. It's cars bars bonds and stocks you ain't see my flow. Y'all are small-time suckers like a knee-high hoe. [Chorus]"
flow easy,"First and foremost.... Flow easy, yo. Yo, yo, for the hood (for the hood). Everybody flow easy, ha ha, so easy. Yo, listen. For the corrupt mob, John Cena, Trademarc, listen. I embarass MC's who touch the mic with me. That's why they never holla when it's showtime - gimme. I spit poison like a black snake bit me. Guns up in the E-Class, D's can't get me. My foot is a 13, 12's don't fit me. My heart is cold and hard like Jack Frost bit me. So many new flows old flows start to panic. It's time they got built by the mic mechanic. Y'all heard, I stay in hood streets like curbs. And never forget, where I come from, word. I ain't goin broke, fuck you, I'll cop me a brick. And take it straight to the block, forget rap quick. Don't trip, Bump got a speed zone sign. For suckers who move too fast against mine. I'm pressed, pushin it full speed ahead. You left, bullet in chest, meet the dead, so. [Chorus]. Flow easy, turn up the mic it's time. to flow easy, whenever I spit my rhyme. I flow easy, the underground pound and grime. Flow easy, but yours don't sound like mine. I flow easy, turn up the mic it's time. I flow easy, whenever I spit my rhyme. I flow easy, the underground pound and grime. Flow easy, so yours don't sound like mine I flow easy. [Tha Trademarc]. Philosopher first, rapper second. Manifest the message, lessons involved. It all but hits you, aviate your crew and lift you. So what's the issue? Trademarc has got it locked before he meet you. Greet your mind before we even greet you. Won't mislead you, I ain't trustin people, cause I defeat you. Take it down a notch, slow your roll. Cause we crush spirits, like we stole your soul. I set styles off dog, y'all are fuckin mimics. Man I talk more shit than pro-lifers in abortion clinics. Run my mouth off like high school rumors. Man and grab microphones like pedophiles gropin late bloomers. Flow easy like your first day with white sneakers. You just a face in the crowd like packed bleachers. Huh, you better rock a sleeveless. Freddie Foxxx, Trademarc, John Cena breeze through. Y'all are fuckin divas. [Chorus]. [John Cena]. First and foremost I sure post potential like Carmelo. Turn a hard MC to jello. Make their skin yellow with fear while stayin mellow and clear. Man, we in for one hell of a year, yeah. Curse a fool like the Red Sox, we tighter than headlocks. I'm flowin easy with Freddie Foxxx. Known to hang it low like dreadlocks and y'all are too slow. Like wearing a weight vest and lead socks. I'm a fat kid, you feed me? I'm still hungry. Never let a bitch take a bill from me. Like Jordan in the 4th quarter, I'm still money. Best believe the flow water, we still runny. Make your stomach feel funny, I'm so sick. With 16 bars twice the value of gold brick. Make it known quick that I'm greedy, we got the rats and the cheese B. So believe me. [Chorus]"
if it all ended tomorrow,"What Would You Do If It All Ended Tomorrow?. Time Runnin Out, Ain't No One You Can Borrow. So Many Paths, which one you gonna follow?. What Would You Do If It All Ended Tomorrow?. What Would You Do If It All Ended Tomorrow?. Time Runnin Out, Ain't No One You Can Borrow. So Many Paths, which one you gonna follow?. What Would You Do, What Would You Do?. Uh, this is how it go down. I have the black-pound-silence so it don't make sound. I pile a 150 outta town, aint nobody around. I`m in the back seat breakin it down. My love has been a past week dawg lately I found. Our press made us turn the radio down. But God bless now they talkin bout layin me down. Now they on about shovels in the weight of the ground. What now?. Preachin on the way that they handle thing. Watin patiently to do the 6-foot Same Thing. Now, so I take a second look at my life. I made too many mistakes that I just couldn`t make. right. Should've been more focused than I take things light. When I'm gone this is what ya'll will say I was like. American fool, no not that baddest or cool. Just a big fish caught up in the shallowish pool. Not a big name playa, in fact its true. Never wanted this shit without the kats he knew. He got lucky rode the co-tails of everyones fame. In two weeks aint nobody gon' rememba his name. Fuck It. I'm ready to go, I done made records. Made monetary often that flow. More importantly though, I proved everyone wrong. It`s all over regardless what you say when Im gone. What now?. What Would You Do If It All Ended Tomorrow?. Time Runnin Out, Ain't No One You Can Borrow. So Many Paths, which one you gonna follow?. What Would You Do If It All Ended Tomorrow?. What Would You Do If It All Ended Tomorrow?. Time Runnin Out, Ain't No One You Can Borrow. So Many Paths, which one you gonna follow?. What Would You Do, What Would You Do?. I want ya'll to feel the wound, its the truth in my words. I been quiet for too long, the truth should be heard. It was a while back, 10:20 in the morn'. Kat should up on my lawn in the rug-ed uniform. Unexpected, theres a knock on my door. I met this fool in the club, I don' see him before. Open to great him, but the second he sees me. His eyes buckle, his voice is uneasy. But it's cool, I didn't even catch it at first. I check his shoulder, homie's rockin a purse. Now I know something's tricky, but I'm already sittin. down. Homie pipes up, you should hear what he's spittin out. Says I've been sleepin wit his wifey. And he ain't the type of kat to take that shit. lightly. I made a move and he told me homie wait. Reached in his purse pulled a chrome 38. He asked me if I'm ready to die. Said he was gonna pull my brains all over the sky. Said he was leavin the country, and he was straight. with the passports. Cocked the hammer, I'm thinkin my last thoughts. I'm in a bad way, nothin could save this.. I close my eyes hopin it's painless. Just waitin for the sound, ready to swallow too. But homie havin trouble with his follow through. By a miracle, I avoid the chalk ground. Homie's confused, he just wanna be talked down. His wife is sleepin through town and he knew it. Picked me outta the crowd but couldn't do it. Just lost it, and as he's walkin away. I realize life is short so I'm markin the day. Now it's full speed ahead, I'll rest when I'm dead. And I could give a Fuck what the next man said. I live how I wanna live. Buy what I wanna buy. Do what I wanna do. Try What I wanna try. Fear nothin, take chances. Not afraid to fail, always makin advances. So when I ride on the Grim Reaper Highway. No regrets bitch, I did it my way. Yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah). What Would You Do If It All Ended Tomorrow?. Time Runnin Out, Ain't No One You Can Borrow. So Many Paths, which one you gonna follow?. What Would You Do If It All Ended Tomorrow?. What Would You Do If It All Ended Tomorrow?. Time Runnin Out, Ain't No One You Can Borrow. So Many Paths, which one you gonna follow?. What Would You Do, What Would You Do?"
john cena rap (rock diss),"Rock wanted me to write his song. Tonight but I would never be his mouthpiece. Cause rock's like lebron james. He took his talent straight down to south beach. And for the past few weeks. Rock's been legitimately pissed. If you get stuck singing your song. Tonight rock it's all in the wrist. Could we please have a week where. You don't come out here and choke?. You may be g. I. Joe this summer, right now you're a g. I. Joke. Ever since I opened my mouth about. You you been beggin me to back off. So if rock and dwayne are the same person. I think y'all both are jackoffs. And after april 1st, you won't be making no more movies. You gon' need surgery on your face just. Like you had it on your boobies. Those poppin pecs they had more. Work than a locker room full of divas. I got a gift for rock tonight, I'ma give him a cleveland steamer. Team bring it? He's team lost it and the truth is gettin scary. Cause they weren't chantin ""rocky"". Last week, they were chantin ""tooth fairy"". Keep making fun of this fruity pebble rock. Cause I ain't even close to sick of it. I'm mr. Kung pao chicken. You just miami fried chicken-shit. And no, no, I don't have balls but. I got somethin in their place. I'ma beat yo' ass at wrestlemania. And put my nuts dead in yo' face!"
just another day,"Chorus: John Cena and Trademarc]. This is just another day in the life. Seven flight connectors - past due bill collectors. This is just another day in the life. Mo' money mo' problems - and I ain't got money to solve 'em. This is just another day in the life. Gettin mobbed by fans - man nobody even knows who I am. This is just another day in the life. This is just another day... in my life. [John Cena]. Everybody asking me - what you really like?. Is this really life? Do you really fight?. Do you fear the mic, when there's millions watchin?. Are you super rich now, how much grip you coppin?. You the new kid, now you getting some shine. When every vet sayin that it's not yo' time. My hustle is non-stop and it's not yo' grind. Plus I hear very clear, I'm not so blind. Beef I don't sweat it, sleep I don't get it. I remember your face it's just your name I forget it. These days they melt together as one. I got some plans to do shit that ain't never been done. Take this game into battles that ain't never been won. I ain't gon' walk through life, I think it's better to run. And yeah I'm eatin right if you askin. But the size of my wallet that's reflection of passion. [Chorus]. [Tha Trademarc]. Just another face in the crowd, so to speak. Huh, my electric was cut off last weak. No heat, no food, no money, no girls. And if life's my oyster then I ain't found pearls. Makin moves every day so the ends could meet. No gas money, so I use my legs and feet. Everybody I meet man, they likely saw. that I be in the same clothes from the night before. Shoes so old you can call 'em retros. Man I'm so damn broke, even my wallet echoes. I got a dollar and change; man, I'm under the gun. That buck's the only thing keepin me from bein a bum. That's why I'm writin these words man, so I can get on. So I can realize bein poor was makin me strong. And the only reason I can't rub pennies together. is cause I carry big bills, in genuine leather. [Chorus]. [Cena] Shakin hands with some fans by the thousands. [Marc] My place so poor, looks like public housin. [Cena] Gettin the Porsche when I shoulda got the CL6. [Marc] My ride broke down, I'ma kinda between whips. [Cena] Face on the X-Box, you played the game lately?. [Marc] Man I can't rent, I owe too much in late fees. [Cena] Do I, charter a jet, or fly first class?. [Marc] Do I take a cab? Bus seats hurt my ass. [Cena] Pay my jeweler in cash, he don't take a check. [Marc] The chain I rock, leaves a green mark on my neck. [Cena] Do I get the filet steak or the shrimp & crab mix?. [Marc] Do I get a number 3 or a number 6?. [Cena] Get in the club V.I.P. man they lettin me slide. [Marc] Man they bust me for dress code, I'm still outside. [Cena] Everybody wanna be down, but I ain't got no friends. [Marc] Man nobody's around, I ain't got no friends. [Chorus]"
keep fronting,"[Intro / Chorus: Big L sample]. I shoulda been out, I'm de-de-deadly. when I pu-pu-pull the pin out, keep frontin. I'ma try-try-try ya chin out. I knocked a lot-lot-lot-lot out of men out. Keep frontin, I'ma try-try-try ya chin out. I knocked a lot-lot. I knocked a lot-lot-lot out of men out. Keep frontin, keep frontin, keep frontin, keep frontin. [Bumpy Knuckles talking over sample]. Yo. Right now. I wanna teach all you MC's out there. How to be. Effective. Let's ride. [Freddie Foxxx a.k.a. Bumpy Knuckles]. Do y'all know what time it is when everybody game. is everybody else's hustle and everybody's shame. is somebody else's blame, whatever I became. I did it with hot rhymes and a lung full of flame. I never refrain, from loadin up and takin aim. Like chicks flows are different, I never cum/come the same. My mic will be the dame, written or off the brain. I show up with my chest pumpin hard like Notre Dame. I lose then I regain, hustle is in the vein. I'm drinkin protein shakes to muscle up the brain. In the black Chevy Suburban sippin champagne. with champagne, dick out doin the damn thang. We movin in the fast lane, with them black thangs. On the way to the Bronx, to do the ski-mask thang. I don't know what's so funny cause I ain't laughing. The part is for a dead body, guess who's casting. [Chorus]. [John Cena talking over sample]. Alright bro, I'm hearin you. I'ma see what I can do. See how I can rip it. And be, effective. Follow this. [John Cena]. Cena spittin with the Bump Bump Bump for the Knux. Your whole crew gettin dumped dumped dumped with the chumps. We rollin like Donald Trump Trump Trump with the bucks. Your bitch-ass gettin jump jump jumped cause you suck. Follow me, you stick around round round when it's hot. You claimin that you down down down but you not. You try to offer me a pound pound pound you get got. I can't wait to hear the sound sound sound of you shot. You hearin me, it's time to show show show I got plans. That's all you brought you bettter go go go get your mans. A legal hustle, ain't no no fuckin with grams. Stash the heat cause I can throw throw throw with my hands. I'm tellin you, on screen screen screen with these flicks. Catch me on the scene scene scene with three chicks. I fuck like a fiend fiend fiend with three dicks. Fuck a sixteen teen teen I'm just sick. [Chorus]. [Tha Trademarc over sample]. Yeah, what's good fellas. I'm feelin y'all man. Most these cats. Can't engineer, they career. Yeah, Trademarc, bout to. Bout to show y'all. How to be, effective. [Tha Trademarc]. My camou' colors dog they be beige and brown. That shit was all love 'til you cowards came around. With the same ol' sound that's why your payroll down. That's how the game go now that's why you ain't gain ground. Cause you stuck on then dog, you ain't on now. And that's how it's been baby cause you ain't know how. You move your pen lazy maybe or your beats don't pound. I move quicker than the word on the street go 'round. I write down every lesson that my peeps hold down. You let your heat go blaow if you ain't speak profound. I write sixteens down 'til I hit green now. Makin up slang, ain't know what shit mean now. Trademarc, Marc Predka, jot the real name down. You can catch it on every marquee in town. Sayin Trademarc, ain't nobody like you now. Probably sweatin this track dog, go wipe your brow. [Chorus - 2X]. [Bumpy Knuckles]. You see, that's all it takes. Is for a man to make an effort to be, effective. And if you're not, effective... then you're defective. Hahahaha.."
know the rep,"[Freddie Foxxx a.k.a. Bumpy Knuckles]. Hahahaha.... Y'all know the rep, yeah, listen. My name is Bumpy Knuckles, I write that fuckin flame. And kill for the right price I got a buckin name. My forty caliber too fresh, stuck in aim. We roll like 18 wheelers in the truckin game. I'm nice with mics there's nothin more I like. than to paralyze your left side and leave you all right. I be layin front of your crib with Tec-y all night. Tryin to get them 9 millimeters loaded up tight, listen. I'm like a Cadillac, I write a battle rap. so smooth contest you'll be out of that. Y'all know the beef is stewin, that Bumpy came to ruin. You may be signed but you don't know what the fuck you doin. I make aight hot, I make dope raw. And send you higher than a long Colt four-four. You know the only rap pimp that kept a ho poor. And slam a fool on his back and break the whole floor. [Chorus: Bumpy Knuckles]. A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop. We keep on, once the cops are gone. This is real street spit you best be warned. Tell your favorite MC the mic is on. A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop. We keep on, once the cops are gone. [John Cena]. Yeah, yeah. It's the J daddy, not Hov' or Jam Master. My mic is correct, but y'all know the hands faster. See you bitch rappers I'm attackin the pile. Y'all be cryin foul cause I'm hackin your style. I make sure you and your mans done. When I see y'all both drop, I'm the cat screamin And1. You see me on the team dog you know the game's over. Stones on my wrist, and a chip on my shoulder. Sixteens cashin in on another hot beat. Go cop me a drop with the butterscotch seats. And we better not meet, if we do you gon' see a change. Make sure you whole FACE gettin rearranged. We rollin up in the blacked out truck dog. It's Freddie Foxxx, now you deal with Corrupt Mob. It's gas on the fire, any time a track blaze. Squad known to beef up the Heat, just like the Shaq trade. [Tha Trademarc]. This my 9 to 5, this ain't no hobby cat. Copycat killers bite styles, my rhyme piles is heavy. Give me a beat, man I'll body that. Spittin that heat street raps man they nod to that. What you smilin at? You R&B, man that's hardly rap. You lost the beat, man you bought a map. Matter fact, here's my next rap, borrow that. Been off the street too long, I want my corner back. You ain't a player, you a armchair quarterback. You ride the beat like side streets on a flat. Don't play dumb, I know where you came from. You only seen slugs buddy after the rain come. Keep it subtle, Trademarc got you bitch. like babies suckin tits talkin 'bout mami let's cuddle. It's gon' be what it's gon' be, you duck down. A quiet cat with a violent rap, what now?. [Chorus]"

Yeah, yeah. We came to kick the door down, it's time to hit the floor now. Yo... we got some shit in store now. So; clap your hands while we let the sax blow. Not quite crispy green, but we came to stack dough. We ain't maxed yo, we just try and get this money right. Bills made of Spandex, I still keep my money tight. Never stoppin, all I see is the money like. the kid on the mic is too +Raw+ for your Monday night. If you got in free, or your fuckin cover's paid. Bounce to this motherfucker like you was some Rubbermaid. This ain't that Cristal sippin type shit. It's that bottle breakin, startin riot type shit. So jump up and down 'til ya break the floor. Yo we keep it underground like a basement tour. East coast reppin, stretchin out to L.A.. Not double oh seven but we +Die Another Day+, what. [Chorus]. [Tha Trademarc]. I tear up any track, front to back. Like Roy Jones takin on fifty year-old cats. makin comebacks, where you at, cats spit soft shit. like whispers and gloves, I'm not hearin that. It's all love maybe if you wanna rub baby. Anything but that, step back lady. Trademarc, John Cena, clubbin it up. We got Chaos on the one and two, cuttin it up. I'm all about laid back, don't jock, I hate that. I see through haters games, don't mistake that. I still got love if you buyin our shit. If you claim you hatin us, but you ridin our dicks. Everybody hear the name, Marc Predka. It's gonna ring like an echo for years, I never left ya. All y'all raise your glass to this shit. Cause Trademarc's the head of the class of misfits. [Chorus]. [John Cena]. We steal your top spot, and you not gettin your number back. Chop down competition like I was a lumberjack. Clear out the club floor, we keep 'em comin back. Tough to bring down like an overweight runningback. Yeah - and we blaze 'em baby. Trademarc, John Cena, we amazin baby. Yo we tear up any crew, leave a motherfucker worn. Y'all are just soft like some Cinemax porn. [Tha Trademarc]. I move a crowd like a bomb scare. Grab the mic when we hittin it right, if you want fear. Some say Trademarc, he ain't all there. We old school like when Sonny, was on Cher. Take it back like a Richard Pyror 8-track. And grab a chunk of your change like a state tax. Man please, we want platinum plaques. I want cream, green, cheddar cheese, to grab in stacks. [Chorus]. [scratching Trademarc to fade]. ""Chaos on the one and two, cuttin it up"". ""That's that shit!"". [crowd chanting] ""Ce-na, Ce-na, Ce-na"" [at the end]"
my time is now,"[Chorus: John Cena]. Your time is up, my time is now. You can't see me, my time is now. It's the franchise, boy I'm shinin now. You can't see me, my time is now!. [John Cena]. In case you forgot or fell off I'm still hot - knock your shell off. My money stack fat plus I can't turn the swell off. The franchise, doin big bid'ness, I live this. It's automatic I win this - oh you hear those horns, you finished. A soldier, and I stay under you fightin. Plus I'm stormin on you chumps like I'm thunder and lightning. Ain't no way you breakin me kid, I'm harder than nails. Plus I keep it on lock, like I'm part of the jail. I'm slaughterin stale, competition, I got the whole block wishin. they could run with my division but they gone fishin -. - with no bait, kid your boy hold weight. I got my soul straight, I brush your mouth like Colgate. In any weather I'm never better your boy's so hot. you'll never catch me in the next man's sweater. If they hate, let 'em hate, I drop ya whole clan. Lay yo' ass DOWN for the three second TAN. [Chorus]. [Tha Trademarc]. Yeah, uhh. It's gon' be what it's gon' be. Five pounds of courage buddy, bass tint pants with a gold T. Uhh - it's a war dance and victory step. A raw stance is a gift, when you insist it's my rep. John Cena, Trademarc, y'all are so-so. And talk about the bread you make but don't know the recipe for dough though. Aimin guns in all your photos, that's a no-no. When this pop, you'll liplock, your big talk's a blatant no-show. See what happens when the ice age melt. You see monetary status is not what matters, but it helps. I rock a timepiece by Benny if any. The same reason y'all could love me is the same reason y'all condemn me. A man's measured by the way that he thinks. Not clothing lines, ice links, leather and minks. I spent 20 plus years seekin knowledge of self. So for now Marc Predka's livin live for wealth. [Chorus] - repeat 2X"
right now,"[John Cena]. Yeah. You can't help but feel it. Can't help but feel this one. Uh-huh uh yeah. Excuse me for a minute while I lighten the mood. Just clap with me like the lightning do, yeah. A bit of soul food that you be bitin into. And if you feel me then I'm writin for you, uh-huh. Right now put another coat of wax on the ride. For a minute put the beef and the gats to the side. Cause this track's got a vibe to chill to. Enjoy life for 5 minutes, man it's not gon' kill you. It's okay to be hard and stay true man. But at the end of the day, we all hu-man. This one's for you, the ones that you close to. Show some love, it's what you supposed to. Right now, forget the ends and the Benz. Pop a cold one, man toast it wit'cha real friends. Call your folks, tell 'em you tight now. Cause everything lookin pretty good right now. [Chorus]. Right now baby, we all gon' ride. So place those things on your hips or side. The soul vibe gon' change, give way with fame. But sometimes the moral change or stay the same. Relax baby, right now you here. And sit back baby, with a round of beer. And cheer to those friends who crowded near. For those passed on in spirit they there. It's gon' be what it must, break bread wit'cha crew. If you got kids take the crust. It's all love baby, tell your girl she's strong. And whisper in her ear after dinner it's on. And take it slow baby, cause everything real. When you at family dinner y'all enjoy that meal. Thank God that you healthy and you keepin it tight. And keep your dreams lighthearted when you sleepin at. night. [Chorus]. [John Cena]. Yeah - and right now I'm showin love to my brothers. and my old man. To my girl, ""Let's Get it On"" like the slow jam. To everybody that I'm runnin down the road with. Y'all my family, I know that you know this. Fox, Rock, B's and Chaos. Y'all growin up with me man, true to life players. Grandma or grandpa watchin up above. Trademarc you my heart cousin, nothin but love. [Tha Trademarc]. Thanks momma, for all that you was. You a strongarm lady baby crazy with love. My sister raised me, those are the facts. And taught me how to rebuild when the order collapsed. And right now I'm blessed no stress no less. And thanks hip-hop for givin me back focus, huh. Yeah John, what can I say?. It's all love from day one, you showed me the way. [Chorus]"
running game,"[Chorus 2X: John Cena]. We roll by in the pimp ride (then we). Walk through with the pimp slide (y'all know me). Crew heavy on the thick side. Everybody feelin this, y'all know we serious. [John Cena]. I'll be makin you move so quick you can't see me in slow-mo. Get your throat cut when you step in the dojo. Y'all got no flow, we be makin hits. You like a proctologist, you feelin my shit. Yeah - you all hype like a street team. I spend more time holdin a mic than Mean Gene. Makin beat fiends scream, they be love the click. Roll solo to the party but I leave with ya chick. Cause she know that when I'm flowin it's hot. There's a party in my pants, she be blowin the spot. Buck naked in the old school drop, givin me skull again. She give me free yos, that's why I call her a mulligan. See me on TV, knows everything about me. You can't fuck with me, she can't fuck without me. And if you think she don't be lovin my thangs. That's like sayin you eat at Hooters for the buffalo wings, what?. [Chorus]. [Tha Trademarc]. Fuck record execs, promisin checks. I been cleanin tables now I'm seein labels, these chicks. sayin ""haven't we met,"" man holdin my breath. Feel like the lesser of two evils that I haven't seen yet. I got girls runnin game with a pimp strut. Big butt booty bitches tryin to link up. They walkin toward me, conversation and they body bore me. I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story. Nas said it before, that's raw. If you leavin the club your clothes'll end up on the car floor. Man, I got no time for words after sex. I just kick you to the curb and be laughin next. Cause Trademarc is a clingy chick's nightmare. Even though you took me home, I won't spend the night there. I've had hookers to virgins, on they back. Wild sex all the way to dead lays like necrophiliacs. [Chorus]. [John Cena]. Johnny Cena got the girls, girls but I'm not Jay-Z. I play the field, I never let the field play me. You see my Chevy? You know there's ten chicks aboard. Plus the whip got more switches than the mixer board. I'm stickin your whore, while you flossin your Range. Gave her a dollar, she gave me back a buck and some change. She tried to swallow me whole, I brushed the back of her wig. She called my dick Frank White cause it's +Notoriously B.I.G.+. [Chorus]. Submitted by Lady BéHh"
summer flings,"Yeah we doin things now man. It's just another day in the life y'know. Always tryin to do some big bid'ness. Sometimes when we havin fun. Some shit goes down y'know, you ain't expectin nothin. Then, somethin come out of nothin. It was just another typical day in the summer. Me, Trademarc, Crouch and my little brother. We put the whips out, we cruise up to the strip man. Three wheel motion killin fools like a hit man. We on some chill shit, vibin out. But we still in the mix, fuck hidin out. On the corner of L Street, I locked eyes with her. I ain't steppin man this bitch had guys with her. She came through the crowd and walked over to me. Catchin P off guard, she actin like she knew me. Her name was Shannon, she was canon. She's hangin with Melissa, this big booty chick you couldn't miss her. This chick was like a fitted cap, all over my dome. Said she wanna be down, but I ain't takin her home. That's when she said she live right down the street. She love white chocolate, well I got somethin sweet. [Chorus 2X: female singer]. Saw you walkin down the street and I. heard you say you had somethin sweet for me. Lover.. (somethin sweet) lover.. somethin sweet. [Tha Trademarc]. We run game, {?} Blanson, what's your hon's name. I can take an Eva hot bitch like bum change. Playin hard to get when I step, I'm afraid. I can treat a chick like cheap gas and upgrade. Whatever you need, whatever you want. With Trademarc on your arm, girl what more could you flaunt. There's just something about us, summer fling got you wondering. where I'll be in spring, but that's another thing. I'll be out girl, quicker than tans. If you want somethin stick hurr, stick wit'cha man. I ain't lookin for a lover girl, I'm lookin for sex. I can tell you I got money or I'm pushin a Lex. Whatever gets you hot, that's what I say next. Gettin passed through the crew girl that's a safe bet. I think it's funny how it doesn't take a whole lot. Trademarc's like an open flame, getting girls hot. [Chorus]. [John Cena]. Yo... with these sweet flows, the streets knows. whether we pimped out in streets clothes, we the bomb like deep throws. My speech grows to reach hoes - all over the globe. I got class like a Ric Flair robe. [Tha Trademarc]. Man I'm in and out quick like Jordan in the zone. D takin out a bitch like a pass from Shaq to Kobe. You know me with a extra set of hands. a bitch couldn't hold me man I leave 'em lonely. [John Cena]. If I catch a glimpse of your chick when she smile and fine. I make sure she lose your number, she'd be dialin mine. I ain't about a wife even if she won this right. I'll fuck for seven days but stand for one night. [Tha Trademarc]. Man we decked out John, the strict gutter. I'll have a girl repeatin my name in sex like the bitch stutter. I got moves lookin butter with a tight fade. Forever dipped fresh man like Minot Gray. [Chorus]. Submitted by Lady BéHh"
this is how we roll,"[Chorus: repeat 2X]. Wheels is shinin.. deals we signin.. money's pilin... Low, this is how we roll. [John Cena]. Catch me in the black 'llac truck with the pickup back. The game weak, I'ma pick up slack. Hands high like a stick-up jack, fuck your boring rap. This East to West coast hittin like Warren Sapp. I'm fully focused, I walk with a purpose. Y'all are fuckin clowns, you belong in a circus. This is big bid'ness, we don't stop 'til the money home. Block shakin more buzz than a honeycomb. And I'm a savage in the booth. I'm on some movement shit, about to rally up the youth. Number one seed daddy walkin through the playoffs. You better quit rappin 'fore I start makin layoffs. Fuck a day off, I'm movin heavy for the payoff. You don't ride to this? We don't need you, stay off. Hate on this? I don't care what you said. Y'all can choke on a shit sandwich with no bread. [Chorus]. [Tha Trademarc]. I don't smile as such, buddy, ain't much funny. You touchy girlie rappers claimin that you fuckin gully. I live poor but look rich, I hit raw, you look bitch. You love me, that's why you got your style from me. Most sayin Marc Predka's overconfident. It's only cause they jeally that my profile is prominent. The dominant factor is the money I'm after. Your opinion ain't mean shit buddy - I ain't ask ya. It's gon' be what it's gon' be. It is what it is and was what it was so watch ya wordplay. Trademarc lay you where the buzzards and birds play. I write rhymes 'til ya boy is heard mayne. Cause alls I got, is my voice and word. Sophisticated rapper the dapper lover the don. It's on baby pah yeah word is bond. Cut the check and I'll rock, every word of the song - what now?. [Chorus]. [John Cena]. Yeah, yeah... yeah. I got that velcro flow, I'll make you stick to this. So many zeroes, my monetary is ridiculous. A glass of Chardonnay doesn't whine like you. I'm an Altered Beast with Einstein's IQ. Plus I shine bright too and I ride right through. In a leaned out, old school, skylight blue. I don't think there's a player nice. Keep your Cristal, I'm shoot Jagermeister. Foot to the floor and you ain't you keep the pace. Throw me a whore and call me Kobe cause you know that I'ma beat the case. I buy some land, and never even see the place. Vegeterian chicks, go on givin meat a taste. Throw away money like I hate on loot. Copped your CD it sounds great on mute. Words turn 'em to dust makin MC's disintergrate. My name get traffic like the California interstate, what?. [Chorus].

untouchables,"The Untouchable cat who's style is right,. I could be mistaken for the smooth and silent type,. My violence bites tight like it was vampires teeth,. I'm hammerin G, opponents are beat you put to sleep,. My radical brain will run your terrain,. I'm comin to game,. It's simple and plain,. Your hurtin', there's no numbin the pain,. Warpin' your frame, the complex, with ill techs, still flex, kill specs, on cassette decks... Mic checks and tight reps,. Collect all life bets,. We'll see how bright the lights get,. The illest attack,. I fight with artillery jack,. Then physically smack and verbally hung,. You stumble and fumble,. So I gain possession,. Music moves in cycles,. Natural progression,. Thuganmonics lesson is tought,. And Records are bought,. Analyze for lies and fillers,. Nowadays, Gorillas make skrilla if the markets correct,. All you need is a hook, and a hand to collect,. Lack cred, but respect MC's before me,. Don't blast the backheat but the streets can't ignore me,. Hands nice I rock it wit peace, leave ya hard reps soft,. Just like when Miami left the Big East. . you'll know my stees, yo we raising the bar.. assasinate the mainstream. you'll know my stees,. Trade-Mark n' John Cena, assasinate the mainstream..

we didn't want you to know,"[20 second instrumental to open]. [Chorus: John Cena]. If you don't know by now, we runnin the game. Neck froze, got a mill' on the chain. Show respect to Cen' and Trade. Cut the check, believe we're paid. Y'all waitin for the single to drop. Look down on the charts cause we sittin on top. Everybody else feelin the flow. If you don't know by now (we didn't want you to know). [John Cena]. Get nasty, doin dirt don't put it past me. ""Appetite for Destruction,"" +Axl+ couldn't +Slash+ me. I got hounds that found where your stash be. They play my sound in towns, rats harass me. They know I'm nice, they ain't bettin on you. That's like playin roulette and bettin on blue. Cena gon' blow - you goin no place. Snatch your dame, show her my old face. Still walk tall with a staggered stance. Plus I hold on the club like I was Bagger Vance. Make you breakdance for me, have you doin headspins. Ship you to D.C., covered in Redskins. Catch me in a classic drop low with the wine paint. Plus I'm classic on the flow, every line great. Believe me, yo the speech is tight. I lay you down like when you sleep at night, big business. [Chorus]. [Tha Trademarc]. Y'all are cowards y'all found power and cower. The gunpowder a thousand shots an hour leavin blocks devoured. Have your family prayin for your survival. Bust shots and get cops bent out control like a spiral. Man get the fuck on if you got bangers involved. Man get the fuck on and keep your chambers revolved. Man get the fuck on and get your weight up. Man get the fuck on or you get laid up. Sippin BNB out the sceptre. It's not Trademarc to you dog it's still mister. Sophisticated, and Marc's never stuck up. I know when to shoot my mouth off and when to shut the fuck up. Every rhyme I write, worth writin. Every room I'm in, worth micin. I'm artistic, you must have missed it. When I said every rapper sucks I was bein optimistic. [Chorus]. [Tha Trademarc]. Trademarc's mind is dilated. Highly rated, madly envied, that mean we kindly hated. The nightcrawler brawl and have you missin. when we drag your body out to sea like fishermen. and takin everything that's glistenin. So run your chain or your dame, it's all the same. Just a verb exchanged - you listenin?. Man, I never leak what I think. And never sleep cause you miss the point of life when you blink. [John Cena]. Fuck with the kid I'll leave you laid up in intensive care. This monopoly, I ain't got intent to share. When it's time to do business, I got no friends. A true hustler, burn the candle at both ends. If anybody on the scene doubt. I show 'em so much green, you think I'm farmin fuckin bean sprouts. Wrist iced when I'm cracked ya mold. Cause revenge is a dish that is best served (cold). [Chorus]"
what now,"[Chorus: female singer]. I... will get by. Touch the sky, time to fly, 'til we die. [Tha Trademarc]. For what it's worth I see the purpose of life. I see below the surface and the version that you know and hold is not right. Hahaha, man I oughta just laugh. The only darkness ahead of me's the shadow I cast in my path. (What's that?) That's the weight of my craft. I breathe easy, and let my chest slowly contract. And write rhymes to inform baby not to uplift. If you wanna make it all, you gotta persist (yo put me on). Yeah, all that talk's a waste. Cause I can read a man's thoughts by the way the lines cross his face. Hold five, everything live. And I vibe, ain't nobody thought this day would arrive. But I balance my talents with a hope and a drive. And ride beats dog, that's where my focus derive. And keep notepads and vocab, that's my guide. And if I got legit beef, I don't let it slide - what now. [Chorus]. [John Cena]. My brain is impossible to thinkin philosophical. Hustle in my blood, that's the only thing that's logical. The only thing I gotta do to stay on or stay strong. I ain't stoppin 'til I own the field that y'all play on. Desperado - eyes like a bird of prey. Cold soldier - crack snap your vertebrae. No heater - flow sweeter than Cohiba. Cinnamon dip, spice ride in the cinnamon whip. Quite wide on the benjamin clip. Might slide but we ain't gonna slip - no way. If the meek shall inherit the earth, guess what?. Y'all get the globe if they measure in, lyrical worth. Trademarc flow first, make the mental work. Fuck a verse - I rearrange your dental work. And when it pop off, we not soft. We like the Bentleys; y'all just the Chrysler knockoffs. [Chorus]. [Tha Trademarc]. But that's life, yeah you hearin me right. It's like I had to find the black of night. come back to life with master insight that shine bright - I'm always learnin. My burden, to blow up gifts like this, I must endure the slow burnin. It's sort of strange, my philosophy's changed. I take chances, jump before the water's in range. And never wait for safe answers so if all that remains. is lookin back at my life it never seems like I wasted glances. Man it's all a big game, that's why it doesn't mean a thing. That I get money and fame, it's all the same. if you call me Trademarc or if you know my real name. Marc Predka ain't attached to ego. He's a hero for the average people, a blessing. Who transcends the essence of a poet with a street flow. It's not lip service I don't speak to hear myself talk. And I don't wanna be a teacher; I'm grateful for all I've been taught. [Chorus].
