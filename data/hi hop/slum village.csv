We dedicate this to these people out here gettin bank. Where the oops you loose the money its reali-tay. Never front on a click that you can't evaluate. See I got things out here I need to situate.

Have my room wit the shark wit the big tank. Don't get mad cause I'm doing things you just cain't, cain't, cain't. Chorus. (Jay Dee). My man. You need to get back like the rebate. And bid he need to step up like the home plate. My man. Now what you know about the Great Lakes?. We contemplate on gettin money like a sweepstakes. Sippin dark grapes, party in the dark shade.

Detroit Motor City finest is who we are. This is for my ladies who get out, chill at the bar(repeat). When I was a young boy chillin in my daddys nuts. All I could hear was a rhyme and dope cuts. Growin up thinkin I was nothin, but a glut. Another day, another buck, another slut. All I wanna do is get paid. Oak town dont stop, stop, stop. Chorus(2x)."
giant,"[ Elzhi ]. [ Elzhi ]. The Moment of truth, from the flow in the booth. Is it a classic to blow through the roof. Just ask 'n let me show you the proof. We stronger than ever along with the pressure. Longer then lesser, we bonded together. Like a song belongs with a measure. We pawnded ya treasure, a thing I wont do for the chips. And this be speaking from my heart, so I ain't using my lips. Like a ventriloquist, and as I stand killing this. While this rain, critics wont admit, how I can and still exist. Its a introduction, discussin the info. stuck in my mental window, thats meant to function. Let the people be the judge. We know and expect it, you holdin the record. Way before the needle even budge. The most hated on, and I stayed alone, was rated wrong. And its a headache, like yankin domes with a straightening comb. When our bread brake, articles of. artists who aren't as hard yo'. Partners by fathers, regardless they are a star you know. Soon as it politics, with dollars become a prince. Be honest,if not I promise, I'ma just switch the style of it. With possibly what the game needs,with the same greed. You fakers is with,making a hit like. when you playin we...indeed. [ Chorus 2X - Elzhi T3 ]. We areeeeeeeee. V- Villa, V-Villa. [ T3 ]. They say a nigga fell off when my nigga [ Dilla ] exited. 3 albums later I kill 'em gotta represent. 2 albums back [ Baatin ] had left. Kinda threw me off balance, put a limp in my step. But I pray for my nigga you know its one love. But let me tell you some shit thats kinda fucked up. Besides the tempting, it wasn't the empting. With the bling bling like mista ching a ling. So we didn't get a second single, or a video. So I say fuck 'em get the dick like a pretty ho. I guess we didn't need 'em, thanks for the freedom. And every time we see 'em, we let the finger greet 'em. [ Chorus 'til fade ]"

One, drama 'n I get the gun out the couch, run out the house. With the loaded pistol stuck in his crouch - One. You fuck it up for all of the rest. You n your niggas in the parking lot rollin' the cess. Tryin' to get up in some chickens that all in your shit. They all wit it, and all seem down to get it, except One. She ain't feelin' the crew.

Day a time of alcohol it takes to get by. Is worth more than a mini puff it takes to get high. One, Love was the joint that my cousins used to breakdance to. Before they began to pop and lock with the glock handle. This -one- turn for the worst, my main concern for the earth. 'Cause it seems to get even worse when it turns. Purposely burn an emcee, fricasee his hand holding the mic. So he can't fold it to write. I'm potent as a lightning bolt when it strike. At least - one - feelin' me.

One of the best in the class it's so stupid. One who test it's tragic so don't do it. Group move crowds like they had us do with theme music. Spit like cars when the body releasin' fluid. One, more tragic than ninety-one-one. Also we fearsome. Known as the Slum and that's just one organism. One crew comin' through 'cause we gotta hit 'em. Those dudes too fly like the Continental. Two niggas on the side one up the middle. It's love in the club and it's constant. We drop shit and yell shit at the concerts. [Baatin]. One...two...the whole world is. Tick tock, tick tock. You live by the clock but I move faster. Niggas is sleeping 'cause they thinking that I procrati-nate. One of these days I'm a show you what I'm made of. Soon as I'm done with these silly little rap scrubs. Soon as I'm done making my rap million dollar hits. Soon as I'm done cleaning my soul of this old curse. Soon as I'm one with the universe. I'm done with you little fucks in this little earth. I rule a planet of my own where you don't exist. Everything is One."

reunion,"{Verse 1} Jay Dee. Yo EL and 10 killin 'em, 3 killin nem. You thought we broke up and we were just reassemblin'. Ladies and gentlemen you barewitnessin'. The villa on some classic shit like vans emb-e-lems. It's the gorrila pimps, we bustin denim in the club. That you cant wear ya denim in. Freakin' da rhyme til every line ends with a *din-in-in*. You dont wanna romp and stomp in Timberlands. Shouts to my nigga Killigan. And all of my peeps that rep more D then 12 Eminems. Who let the dogs out and let Dilla in?. Fuck wit this is ya loss Gilligan. Sounds similiar - I'm not feelin 'em. Get the balls like Venus in Wimbeldon. While I'm in them fly whips five-wheelin' 'em. On some Kim and them All About the Benjamins. Still here. {Chorus}. Still here never left just switched the style up. Came through made moves still get the crowd up. Its our time ""D"" time nigga ya times up. Get riled up for the Reunion. {Verse 2} (T3). EL killin nem, Dilla killin nem. Maybe we could hook up again back wit Ten and them. Together again with all forces on some. Fantastic Four or Four Horsemen. Cant do it without ya crew boy. Guess who boy, comin through wit two boy. Nobody but us that rap in a clutch. Passed and switched it up like kids in double dutch. Some couldn't feel our style or feel our flow. Never talked our slang never walked our road. All they know is these niggas is tainted. Don't know about those rovers that candy painted. We've been misquoted, miscon-screwed (construed),. Misunderstood, and over used. So we take this time to set the record straight. Critics get the dic'it we did it anyway. Now you hear our raps wit Dilla and you all on our team. Till you heard Ten was gone was apart of he scheme. See! We still got love where was you at at?. Just cuz a nigga go solo think we turned our backs. Maybe we will reunite on some shit like that. But I gotta set it straight for' you twists the facts nigga. {Chorus}. {Verse 3} (L). Yo Ten kill'n em, 3 kill'n 'em. You thought we broke up and ya you rite we really did. I wrote a verse that I recited it was hot. But I had to rewrite cuz I thought we was united and we not. But though all the love that I got for you. Parna I picked apart ya words and I'm. shocked in them interviews. Of been accused of not caring. When the city threw your furnture out. Its not fair when I'm learnin about. How stress you fell in a article. Forget a rhyme I'm just as real when I talk to you. And you know that we share Kodak moments. I wish we could go back. But don't act like you wasn't bug'n out like a phone tap. Chase'n cars in the street. I saw you throw a part in the sink. Then after hit the bar for a drink. who asked you to slow down?. Even though niggas told me you was gon' clown. But I tried you didn't know I cried. when I saw you wildin at the State Theater. Near the door by the side. Throw y. I heard you on medication. Had a illness you couldn't heal with herbs and meditation. And believe me; Me and T3 kept it low. Don't take this as a dis this is just to. let you kno that I love ya. But watch the company you keep. Swearing niggas don't care, but they. love you in the streets. Get ya mind right nigga..."
s.o.u.l.,"(Verse 1: T3). There I was sittin there lookin, waitin. Waitin for the chance to get to date you. I'm sayin, I'm sick of games, sick of solos. Sure need you around when its all ova. Listen, I'm not sayin this to offend you. But since the day I met you I knew I would bend you, over. Not sayin its about that. Its about us blending like vocals on ill tracks. Classic, like a novel by Stephen King. Always restin by the revel where a social reign. Sex, its the farthest thing from my mind. I'm thinkin how we get together like the starter line. Fiction, to all the ladies that want it real. A breif description on how a nigga might feel. This is, one page out a black book. This is, how it goes when its all good, sista. (Chorus x4). And back, forth and forth, back. (Verse 2: Elzhi). Just keep the sun in my storm clouds. Appreciate you as a man I was born child, young. Lookin for young girls to party with. Make your body shift, shake up your cartilidge, women. I wasn't satisfied with just one. I'll rip your valentine and having time adjusting, its hard. I thought not a soul could change me. You honor roll, I was down with hoes in grade C, level. I guess there is roses in the ghetto. Gotta find them, always meet the dozen not he dimond, coal. Been supportive now my days shorter. When they was longer dealin with the side effects were calmer, mistakes. I tripped over in my early days. Making the skies over few look a pearly gray, dirty. Until you came along and laid it on. I'll stick with you even if my man say its wrong, for real. (Chorus x4). (Verse 3: Baatin). Since its my last joint I guess I gotta put it down. For the queens who fiend for the kings who come around. I wanna extend the jewels to the crown. Behold you are soul that is lost never found. Still a virgin cause you untouched. Fuckin around with low-life niggas, gettin fucked. You need a king to put it down right. I know you want something thats more than just a one night. Stand tall never fall for the less queen. Nieve niggas with tired ass raps stuck in his dreamstate. With his truck and his real estate, fell for the bait. Not knowing he's tryna change what's sealed in his fate. Just a mouse lookin through a crack. Of the gates to a soul never coming back. Cultivaters never laid to realize self. And when its done the queen of queens will complete your wealth. Know thy self. (Chorus x4)."

Plus, you got a man but he ain't quite me. The type of man that try to give you what you need. And, he wanna know where you are where you be. Where you going where you today where you started to be (Damn). If I was him I wouldn't even leave. I would trust you what you say that you are where you been. Say, he the type of nigga that's still cheap. Take his girl on a date and they go to Mickey D's. See, I'm the type that try to style in a jeep.

Spendin your cash flow cause she was so out hoe. Scandal love, cause love full of scandal. Too much chick for that ass she couldn't handle that. Well it's the same tainted love in the music business. People they lose thet brain just to get up in this. Let's be a star for day, everything in life is just ok. People say things they don't really wanna say. Hey but it's ok cause your a star for the day. People a smile at you when they really wanna frown. Well a that's just the way tainted folk get down. Just keep it real and, we'll see. When the situation is tainted love is always free. Love is always free love is always free. [Chorus: Dwele]. Real love, true love, tainted love, real love. True love, tainted love, real love, true love, real. [Verse 3: Elzhi]. You say you love me but is it really real. Would you, fix me green tea if I'm feelin ill. Would you, give me a back rub to sooth after a long day. Dinner by candlelight but your the main entree. And if so I do the same with other treats to give you. Trailin rose pedals from your door to beneath your pillow. With a bucket of champagne on your night stand. Experience with someone who want in they life span, the same. [Outro: Dwele]. Real love, real, real, everybody knows that love's real love. Someone to trust in you for real. Everybody need love that's real. I would never want nothin tainted. Wait a minute what you feel. Faded if your lovin was tainted. True, oh, I know true love is hard to find. Just let it find you for real. If you found love to keep it real. Keep love from being tainted, being tainted. Oooh do you, be, alright. (T3: Just sit y'all, Dwele, on more time y'all come on). If you, be, alright...."
