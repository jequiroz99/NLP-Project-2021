written in the stars (feat. eric turner),"Oh written in the stars. A million miles away. A message to the main. Ooooh. Seasons come and go. But I will never change. And I'm on my way. Lets go. Yeah. You're listening now. They say they aint heard nothing like this in a while. Thats why they play my song on so many different dials. Cause I got more hits than a disciplined child. So When they see me everybody brrrrrap's, brrrrrraps. Man I'm like a young gun fully black barrack. I cried tear drops over the massive attack. I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat. Look at my jacket and hat. So damn berserk. So down to earth. I'm bringing gravity back. Adopted by the major I want my family back. People work hard just to get all their salary taxed. Look im just a writer from the ghetto like malory blackman. Where the hells all the sanity at, damn. I used to be the kid that no one cared about. Thats why you have to keep screaming til they hear you out. Oh written in the stars. A million miles away. A message to the main. Ooooh. Seasons come and go. But I will never change. And I'm on my way. Yeah, I needed a change. When we ate we never took because we needed a change. I needed a break. For a sec I even gave up believing and praying. I even done the legal stuff and was leaded astray. They say money is the root to the evilist ways. But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake. Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed. Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam. Since the day I thought of that cunning plan. One day I had a dream I tried to chase it. But I wasn't going nowhere, running man!. I knew that maybe someday I would understand. Trying to change a tenner to a hundred grand. Everyones a kid that no-one cares about. You just got to keep screaming until they hear you out. Oh written in the stars. A million miles away. A message to the main. Ooooh. Seasons come and go. But I will never change. And I'm on my way. Oh written in the stars. A million miles away. A message to the main. Ooooh. Seasons come and go. But I will never change. And I'm on my way"

not letting go (feat. jess glynne),"Ready for the summer, girl, your hair look killer. See your batty getting bigger but your waist looks slimmer.

Traded in a thousand times to be a millionaire mate. I take off and land in a very private air space. Okay, I'm crazy and insane, crazy and deranged. I'm so far ahead they tryna chase me in a train. Got them other rappers feeling lazy and ashamed. You know you're doing something right when Jay-Z knows your name. And I aint bothered by the fame but I'm addicted to this lifestyle. Girls so starstruck she write her number twice down. All I see is numbers I don't f-cking waste time n-gga. All I do is numbers call me 789!"

Lay down your head, you're not alone. Anywhere you go, I'll follow. We are the children of the sun. That's all you need to know. They try to moonwalker like Michael. Skywalk all over my rivals. Both hands on that Bible. Bitch, I'm next in line for that title. When I had nothing to do, I was idle. Man, I was in the studio with Taio. Now we're cli-cli-clibing high. We ain't on no Kili a man giro. When they pa-pa-panicking. They don't really know what's happening. Now we've got our clothes on a mannequin. We don't want no comparison. I overdosed on extravagance. We went for gold and got platinum. I told my bro to get an ambulance. 'Cause I caught a cold and went spazzed on em. Yeah. How can home be where the heart is. When your shadow even fuck leaves you. When you are in darkness. Still get stop by sergeant Pepper. Looking for that Ziggy Stardust. After a lifetime of regret. I'm just looking for some answers. Yeah.

We are the children of the sun. That's all you need to know. I had an opportunity in my window. Wise words were my kindle. Disturbing London we raised the bar. Whilst your team was stuck in limbo. Like Freddie, Bruno and Ringo. I saw the signs and symbols. With that top down on my yellow ride. Let bitches hate on my bimbo. I'm yards away from that milestone. International dial tone. Put me through Amaro. When you Instagram with your iPhone. From yellow bricks to them brown stone. I ring bells I'm household. Looking all the rappers we outsold. Shh, keep your mouth closed. Yeah. How did I become so jaded. Maybe all these insecurities are making me feel naked. Feel like Harry did in Vegas. Had my privacy invaded. That's a liberty, a pity that epitome of what fame is. Priest up in my parish keep on putting me in their prayers. Swear I'd never sell my soul. My pride and dignity is too major. Yeah. We rarely ever get those second chances. After a lifetime of regret. I'm just looking for some answers. Yeah. Lay down your head, you're not alone. Anywhere you go, I'll follow. We are the children of the sun. That's all you need to know. Lay down your head, you're not alone. Anywhere you go, I'll follow. We are the children of the sun. That's all you need to know. Looking for a light that can outshine the sun. I know one day our time will come. Bought a camera to capture these cinematic nights. Still don't satisfy my appetite for this lavish life. Tell me, doctor, am I fit for all these flashing lights?. Like Michael said, it doesn't matter if you're black or white. Look at the colors that's under the sun above us. All we have is each other. In case you happened to wonder. Let's go. Lay down your head, you're not alone. Anywhere you go, I'll follow. We are the children of the sun. That's all you need to know. Lay down your head, you're not alone. Anywhere you go, I'll follow. We are the children of the sun. That's all you need to know"

f**k it i'm gone (ft. j warner),"Kick back, sippin' a corona by the poolside. Bumpin' Graduation, welcome to the Good Life. F-ckin' with the baddest chicks. Rollin' with the coolest guys. Only three words that I live by: do or die. When everybody making money. Everybody gettin' on. All my niggas sellin' drugs. I'll be happy selling songs. Life came at a price, I put my money on. And did it til it's going going gone ma'f-cka. [Chorus - J. Warner]. I was working never knowing at the graveyard shift. Congratulated me with a paid hardship. Was it hard, did I fall, baby I did. But I got the scars that made me this rich (Yeah). And all I'm doing now is giving you a page of my life (yeah). So you can tell before you hold it. F-ck it, you can do whatever you like. Someone tell 'em I'm gone. Eh, someone tell 'em I'm gone. If you're not down, you'll be missing this life. And if you with me, see you on the other side. Someone tell 'em I'm gone. [Tinie Tempah - Verse 1]. Somewhere on the Cayman Islands. I'mma have Rihanna's listening to Razor light. Feisty Swedish girls suggesting she should take a flight. I made it this far, can't be afraid of heights. Unimportant calls are costing me a pound a minute. The jurisdiction's England but I'm never in it. German Autobahns my life that's why me no limits. I mastered P but I aint with No Limit. Ibiza on pj's, M.I.A for those Heat games. Might have your favourite European DJ at my B'day. We party hard on them weekdays. And then party harder on them weekends. Still tryna sleep with my ex-girl. But she adamant that we be friends. Lyrics courtesy of. And I'm too smart for these dumb bitches. Too young for these grey hairs. Too immature for these fast cars. I push a button, shit change gears. And I'm twisted offa them Martini's. Faded off that Mai Tai. Why the hell should you be sober. when you've been living that high life. [Chorus - J. Warner]. [Verse 2 - Tinie Tempah]. How you supposed to feel when every door is open for you. All your Polish chauffeurs never ever spoken to you. I step on stage, I set the pace. Done a couple girl songs to set the record straight. Ask GQ and Q Mag. I'm too cool for these douchebags. My wardrobe got a bandana on it. Cause my is 2pac. The weeds good, I have 2 drags. Mamma told me don't do that. Old money mentality. For every single bit of this new cash. And this new cash for me and all my niggas. Big money, footballer figures. Now I'm tryna f-ck every girl in the world. Every supermodel and all the singers. We all the rage we're the latest goss'. Bitch, no tequila I call the shots. My bank balance like Tic Tac Toe. Shit loads of noughts and crosses. I work my socks off, you niggas better pull 'em up. I've got the baddest bitches thinking they aint good enough. My accountant saving money while we getting wasted. Told them bitches life is sweet then let 'em taste it. [Chorus]"

illusion,"My neighbour's kid gettin murdered. Bedroom filled with nikey sb's and?. Starin at the ceiling listening to soul father. Tryna make the world pay me daily like Carson. My mom says I need to put on weight like Kelly Clarkson. She said I work like a soldier steady marchin'. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right. Tryna keep it steady like a lezza with ardon. Apartments, guardin' the garden. Money in the jeans, car keys in the cardigan. When I was a kid I wished that I could be in on ya. Every time my father disregarded an argument. Wishing I was sitting on the move. Watching videos, wishing I was living in the shoes. With designer shoes, doing things I didn't wanna do. Wishing I could see the world from a different point of view. [Chorus:]. Leave your baggage at the stairs,. And your worries at the door,. You don't have to think about problems any more,.

So we'll never let a (rich, rich) dude get near us. Cause were up with the stars, somewhere out of space. And on the underground I felt so outta place. I got Tom, Dick and Harry all looking at my face. I know they wanna say 'Safe' but, don't know how to say it. Bad body language, I don't understand it. When they see Patrick, then they turn to gangsters,. Ha ha, and that's a passage from my mantra. I've started reading from a whole different chapter. [Chorus:]. Leave your baggage at the stairs,. And your worries at the door,. You don't have to think about problems any more,. (I can make you believe in anything). Uh, I know that everything's changed,. But I'm under this illusion just so I don't go insane. (I can make you believe in anything). Uh, you ever been to fed up, to get up. Or wish you had a huge shredder for a few letters.

Cause then I know you still feel something for me. But I truly know it's over when I hear you say, it's okay. [Verse 1]. You told me you was down for whatever. I thought you'd be around me forever. She was my New York girl. with some LA ambition and a really good christian. She knocked me down like a featherweight. Tryna fuck around with a heavyweight. How the hell could you say in the middle of the night. we should call it a day?. I'd rather fucking do a bit of prison time. You had the key to every single thing of mine. My house, my car, my mother fucking heart. I guess we didn't agree to the same deal. I guess that she was tired of the same schpeel. And now I'm immediately packing. dialling 911 tryna tell a man (?). So runaway, run along, thought we were fake,. thought we were wrong. We were rogue, cause where men lie the women (?). I can't breathe I fucked up I need a drink, I want a smoke. Cause I'm the cigareete butt of my own jokes. Hands held high because my back against the ropes. Blood is thicker than water, we were thicker than blood. Now I'm feeling for something I can't touch. Feelin' guilty while you were up in the club. I been caught so who am I to judge?. Tryna regain my composure. I guess this is the end of the road huh?. And after 25 times of hearing. ""Please leave a message after the tone"". I know. [Hook - Labrinth]. Girl I been a bad boo. Baby don't you say, it's okay. Did some things behind you. Baby don't you say, it's okay. Why don't you cry now?. Why don't you cry now?. Cause then I know you still feel something for me. But I truly know it's over when I hear you say, it's okay. [Verse 2]. I put the nail in the coffin. Had a finger on the trigger. She said we ever going down she taking everything with her. Took something so good. and made it redder than the colour on the bottom of her slippers. And not a word from your mother. Even though I make you suffer like a suffregette. Busy? I was busy fucking around. with another woman on the cover. Like a Bryan Ferry album. So runaway, run along, from the people of the places. where you belong. Just imagine the gossip in the salon. Made me feel dumb for foolin' around with a blonde. But love kills all things casually. This is something like a Shakespeare tradegy. And even though we ain't happily ever after. I just hope that you're after happily. [Hook - Labrinth]. Girl I been a bad boo. Baby don't you say, it's okay. Did some things behind you. Baby don't you say, it's okay. Why don't you cry now?. Why don't you cry now?. Cause then I know you still feel something for me. But I truly know it's over when I hear you say, it's okay"
just a little (feat. range),"[Chorus]. I don't wanna think about you,. All day long.. I don't wanna dream about you,. Girl I do miss you.. Just a little,. Just a little,. Just a little,. Okay maybe more than just a little bit.. [Verse 1]. Yeah, I'm done confusing you girl,. We both come from two different worlds.. And you don't wanna come around mine,. But what happened that night was the usual drill.. Head over heels, with ya head over heels.. How many times did I say I'm no good,. Girl even your friends know the deal.. So what you phoning me still?. If you don't hear no evil,. Then you won't see no evil,. Girl I don't wanna be no hero.. We had a little fling on the dealo,. And I ain't really sure how I feel. So I'm in a club with a bottle of verclico. And that's why I can't let you beat my ego.. [Chorus]. I don't wanna think about you,. All day long.. I don't wanna dream about you,. Girl I do miss you.. Just a little,. Just a little,. Just a little,. Okay maybe more than just a little bit.. [Verse 2]. Maybe your used to pain,. Love is a losing game.. Why'd I let you feel the flame,. I think I'm falling I refuse to say.. Usually this is never gonna work at all,. First of all it was too personal,. So when you phone me I gotta divert the call. Cause when you take the lead. Your gonna fly the fool but I,. Don't wanna deal with the commotions. I don't do commitments,. I don't do devotion. That's why you sent a letter to me,. That I never opened.. Give me space to breathe. So I can deal with my emotions.. [Chorus]. I don't wanna think about you,. All day long.. I don't wanna dream about you,. Girl I do miss you.. Just a little,. Just a little,. Just a little,. Okay maybe more than just a little bit."
let go (ft. emeli sande),"[Chorus]. If you can see me, then you're probably a little too close. So you think you could love me, well you gotta be stronger than most. Cause my ex didn't like it, didn't like it,. no my friends they don't like it, they don't like it. Somebody remind me. When's the right time, when's the right time to let go. [Verse 1]. Uh, dear whoeva the fuck is listening,. Tell me of the pleasures of being a normal citizen. Cause all these fittins' and Vivians keeping me from fittin' in. Why do I feel safer on stage than in my own living room. My grandma say that if I leave my drink I shouldn't sip again. Ooh this tour has got me feeling tired like I'm itchin'. and uh even though it's physical differences and my silly feelings. that's why I feel so down even at the top of the ?. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. Uh, dear whoeva the fuck is witnessin',. Disturbing London independent black businessman. Based on the work and the effort I'm gunna give this year. Everybody's getting the presents they want for Christmas, yeah. Life is only ninety nine winters. So I'm tryna bond with daddy even though I don't like dinners. Don't be confused by my image, I'm no fuckin' public pin-up. But my heart won't let me say no to a picture. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. Uh, dear whoeva the fuck is, Fuck it, this is discovery hate it or love it. I'm now officially the property of the public since licensing my album. And signing a deal to be published. But none of these songs are written for me, nor am I a puppet. Journalists come for interviews but don't stay on the subject. Yeah, no, yea - are we done yet?. Questions you've asked me hundreds, now can you grant me some rest. Because I'm tired of it, I'm living out my dream, and I'm tired from it. If music needed saving, I'd die for it. Music's where my heart is, I'm alive for it. I promise. [Break]. If I'm never liked my heart might break. Here in the dark, yeah, we'll be safe. I don't care, no looking back. I've never been, never been, this far from home. [Chorus]"

They wanted me to flop so urban never comes back. When under pressure can you handle all that. So the same amount of ice that’s in my rings in my drink. I be filling up my boat, still I pray I never sink. This the realest shit I wrote. Lately I’ve been on a binge. Rocking diamonds in a club can make you feel like a king. Aww yeah!.

looking down the barrel,"CHORUS. Looking in the barrel of a 12 gauge magnum. Who's that standing behind the trigger finger squinting at me. Looking down the barrel of a 12 gauge magnum. I ain't never done nobody no wrong but me. VERSE. Stolen from the wild and released into captivity. So when I'm near the public too long I act fidgety. Act liberties have to take my gat to Liberty. To stop that crazy bitch tryna snap my black dick off me. Conceived cos no one used the condom or the pill. But was welcomed with open arms like the statue that's in Brazil. Mummy knew I'd be expensive so she nearly called me Bill. Daddy thought that the stress would kill him so he nearly called me Will. Weighing in at 7 pounds and 1 ounce this little miracle. Got given a name with way too many syllables. That made my registration in class a tad difficult. And anyone who did telesales a little miserable. Where my dark skin girls at an aboriginals. Where my light skinned girls at the whole of Liverpool. All i ever wanted to do was be individual. Says that black rapper on your stereo ha typical. CHORUS. Looking at a MILF, thinking bout filth. Make that fuckin' O' Neil, then I give her the Shaquile. I got all the top lawyers looking at my deals. One UK tour we probably looking bout a mill. Rocking my fur knowing something got killed. I even gave PETA dough to help me deal with the guilt. Might take Jameela Jamil for a meal. But i still eat fried chicken and i still drink lilt. (for that totally tropical taste). Life on the edge. Life on the ledge. Life through the lens. Life on the net. Life in the press where there's a life there's a death. Sometimes i literally hear God reply to my prayers. If life is a bitch then life is my ex. Who was so overly obsessed by the size of my head. Told me i broke her heart then put my a knife to my chest. Now its real cold on the other side of the bed. Threw me in at the deep end despite of my fears. These journalists can be fuckin' lions tigers and bears. Vincent van Gogh ‘d em gave em a work of art. Now these critics all make me wanna fuckin' slice of my ears. Flight club yeah. Bought me a pair of airs. My nigga told me well done cos them mediums is rare. Yeah looking down the barrel. Shoot but don't let it stain my american apparel"
lost ones (feat. paloma faith),"CHORUS. You're only a man. It's only right you let the tears fall. Know your strong but you can't take it all. You just lost one. You're just a man. Don't be scared to let the angels fly. Just let go cos its your time to cry. You just lost one. You just lost one. Said that we would never break. Said that we never falter. I thought that we were doing great. I thought we'd make it to the altar. Love the critical acclaim. I knew that it'd would catapult ya. Hands on the table where the pepper and the salt are. Only thing missing rocks bigger than Gibraltar hey. Said that if it didn't kill me. Then it would only make us stronger. But in our final hour will we. be wishing we could stay for longer. Maybe it would make us somber. Wanna live and die another day. You better change your name to Pascal Payet. You'll always be the one that got away. And I'm over you and you over me. And you overdue and I'm over seas. ‘cos I called you names and you phoned police. said man are all the same like there's loads of me. We arguing along Dover street. At least try and smile in these photos please. And now you're all alone cup of Ovaltine. Whilst I'm with the one who I'm s'posed to be. CHORUS. You're only a man. It's only right you let the tears fall. Know your strong but you can't take it all. You just lost one. You're just a man. Don't be scared to let the angels fly. Just let go cos its your time to cry. You just lost one. You just lost one. Congratulations on the first. I wonder how we would have turned out. Some relationships fat people some of them never ever work out. I put the stars all around you. I never let you take your purse out. But when everybody turned up. Only one of us was turned down. And girl where you going with that attitude. We both feel the same and its natural. I aint leaving ‘cos I hate you. I'm leaving ‘cos I have to. A half empty glass, two capsules. Guess I'll never ever know the exact truth. If you can hear me this is at you. I would have had her if she had you. CHORUS. You're only a man. It's only right you let the tears fall. Know your strong but you can't take it all. You just lost one. You're just a man. Don't be scared to let the angels fly. Just let go cos its your time to cry. You just lost one. You just lost one. How my s'posed to be majestic. How my s'posed to be mature. When I've been try'na move towards you from the moment I could crawl. I'll still catch you when you fall. And I'll still answer when you call. Guess we didn't understand the language. Of the writing on the wall. Missing posters up of my heart girl. With my love as a reward speeding switching Richards gears. Whilst I'm trying not to stall. Things will never be the same. My back's against the wall cos the looser puts the blame but the winner takes it all"

lover not a fighter (feat. labrinth),"[Labrinth]. Well I'm a lover not a fighter. So I kiss that girl and say goodbye now. Cause I came for kicks not for arguments.

The way I be stealing the spot. When all the shutters is down, bitch. We be still in the shop. I shop for clothes when it's closed. That's why I feel like the boss. In my vintage eBay watch. That's why I feel like the Hoff. Weren't gonna wait for no institute. Not to gimme a job. These critics giving me bollocks. That's why I give em my crotch. These paps are getting too nosey. That's why I give em my snot. Cause I just tripled my cost of living. Steak, salmon, lobster, chicken. That's made in my Boffi kitchen by Rosa da Costa women. Come from Disturbing London, the city of foster children. Grateful what God has given save us from constant sin. In the city of God, I'm from the city of God. Bitch, I've been up in the Shard, I really been at the top. Separate the man from the man dem. Find out who's real and who's not. Can't take the heat?. Then get out the kitchen and gimme the pot. You know what?. Well I'm a lover not a fighter. So I kiss that girl and say goodbye now. Cause I came for kicks not for arguments. No woah oh oh, cause I'm a lover not a fighter. I used to sit on the settee eating a tin of spaghetti. Now women think that I'm sexy. Because I been on the telly. Car like 007, them alloys spin in Pirellis. I'm with a gold digging heffa. I call her Miss Moneypenny. Well is it real? Is it fake? Somebody gimme a break. I grew up on minimum wage and I grew up in an estate. These rappers calling me bruv. And they can't even relate. Are they even ready and willing do anything that it takes?. I saw my teacher from college. She says she thinks that I'm great. I'm gonna give her the D cos she never gimme an A. She's tryna get in my jeans. I'm tryna kick off my Js. Take off my D&Gs and give her my DNA, cause. All these bitches be loving me. Sipping my bubbly. Watching Hangover hungover, be the quickest recovery. Couple bad grades, I did shit in my study leave. And now she wants my name and a kiss on them double Ds. And I love it. [Labrinth]. I've got too much love to burn babe. Ain't got no time to exchange words babe. Things to do people to see. Yeah I guess we all gotta play the game. Well I'm a lover not a fighter.

obsession,"Yeah. Uhh. I think my reflection is relatively jealous of me. That's all, twittering on my apple hoping I don't get hasseled. Before I reach my goal or til people had to be tackled.

Like when I was 7. Helicopters revvin', posh wedding's. One well expensive watch, dots. Everyday, I'm on leggy blondes who put on wedding rings. But after one heavy drink I on anything. So while they make me feel so used for that sued for. Doors racin' through my mind like a new Porsche with the roof off. Every single time a rhyme, it's science I turn quiet into riot, listen to my silence. This is like a curse, this is like a blessin'. I can hear your voice, I can feel your presence.

She used to send me lovely pictures of her lovely (uh). Now they are even bigger and they're bustier. Ha wow. I used to wonder at the stars a lot. Sitting in my dads old barber shop. I used to pull faces when he past the mop. Then he gave me his plate and glass to wash. He made me wanna be the man in charge, the boss.. That's how he got his first grey. But he laughed it off. The moments and memories we keep. Will be forever stored in my micro SD. Back in the day. When I was young. Those were the days. Wish that I could go back. I wanna take you back. To the very moment when you take a snap. Back in the day. To little me. Reminiscing all, all the memories that. Made me happy and they made me sad. All the very moments when you take a snap. Second year of college on the fourth day. That's when I see you standing in the hallway. (Uh) Leonardo Da Vinci portrait. She had a face that I could be looking at all day. Do your shades, small ways. God put a lot of body in a tall frame. I got all fazed. She was pure. I took up literature just to get to know her more. She said she liked immature when she was immature. Shy girl, she could of worked on her image more. (Uh) she made me laugh till my ribs were sore. We were for better for worse. We were for rich for poor. I was tidying my room. When my sister saw. And said T why you still got her picture for. These moments and memories we keep. Will be forever stored in my micro SD. Woo.. Back in the day. When I was young. Those were the days.

someday (place in the sun) (feat. ella eyre),[CHORUS:]. They never have time to give you. They're always on the run. But you keep on working for your place in the sun. When the lights go out in London. Your work has just begun. Someday you will find your place in the sun. Find your place in the sun. Find your place in the sun. [VERSE 1:]. Back to the beginning in fact no we're winning. Thanks to the spectacular raps that I'm scribbling. It's ‘Bac's' that I'm driven in. Plaques in my living room. The stats match the facts man I'm back back back back. Mama look we made it out the flats we was living in. Times I nearly thought I would collapse living in Britian. Smiling in pictures. Flying to fixtures. Never in denial cos the Nile is a river. Rappers on the sly tryna eye my elixir. Jealousy's a crime bet your pride won't resist ya. To get to where I am I cried like I was injured. Bled like a soldier perspired like a sprinter. Brother said T keep an eye out from them rinsers. People that you hang with are trying to lynch ya. Never break down. I'll be there to lift ya. You're perfect how you are so why they trying to fix ya. [CHORUS]. They never have time to give you. They're always on the run. But you keep on working for your place in the sun. When the lights go out in London. Your work has just begun. Someday you will find your place in the sun. [VERSE 2:]. Away from the pain and the sadness. Soon the whole world is gonna understand my language. Everybody's try'na find a method to the madness. Wankers hating on me ‘cos I did it single handed. Whatever will be will be even if you plan it. On the road to success but feeling like I'm stranded. Disturbing London hoe I don't speak no other language. Started with a goal and then I ended with a hat-trick. Selling out arenas think its time to do a new tour. Pennies for the thoughts that I'm about to give you food for. Never show emotion even on a mood board. Sold my bandwagon then I went and bought a two door. Dizzee made me rap and rider made me get my groove on. I just wanna hit a billion views and do a tune Sean. Thinking 'bout life listening to too short. One day they'll have a statue of me in Madame Tussauds. [CHORUS]. They never have time to give you. They're always on the run. But you keep on working for your place in the sun. When the lights go out in London. Your work has just begun. Someday you will find your place in the sun. [BRIDGE:]. For that spot I'ma use Cruella Deville power. Or do a Willow and Jaden and use my Will power. Victory is the sweetest defeat is real sour. Together we can move mountains rebuild towers. A lot of hurt still waiting for God to heal ours. Stand up and rebel again the real cowards. [CHORUS:]. They never have time to give you. They're always on the run (on the run). But you keep on working for your place in the sun. When the lights go out in London (Disturbing London). Your work has just begun (We've just begun). Someday you will find your place in the sun
tears run dry (feat. sway clarke ii),"There's nothing to borrow. There's no more regrets. Your shadows I follow. But it's like no ones there. But my tears run dry. But my tears run dry.

Only old enough to be my mum by a couple of years. Cuddled all of your kids. Soon you'll be cuddling theirs. And we always hear our names when you mumble your prayers.

Read your article and didn't even need to diss you. Cover shoot I hope they put you in a different issue. And tell your girl I said mwah ciao and bisou bisou. She was on my tour bus for a month and didn't even miss you. After the shit we did its crazy if she even kiss you. Here's some aloe vera kleenex if you need a tissue. I think we should live and just let it die. I'll just put on my fucking shades and pretend everything fine. But my tears run dry. But my tears run dry. Oh my fields won't die. When your not there.

till i'm gone (feat wiz khalifa),"[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]. I grew tired of the same, then one night. Packed my things, told the one I love. I'll be back one day. Through the fight, through the pain. Booked a flight, took a plane. Told her not to cry. I'll be back one day. Been dreaming this since I was young. So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone (gone). Til I'm gone (gone). Til I'm gone (gone). [Tinie Tempah]. I buy time in Switzerland. I drive round in Monaco. I shook hands with Royalty. I make songs that monarchs know. Ti Ti Ti La So fa?. Mi Mi Mi Ra Do?. Call me Aloe Blacc cause I Need That Dollar yo. ha ha. Hic-hic-hiccup. Blame it on the liquor. I came through like a stick up. Now I'm ballin' like a kick up. I be cutting off these bitches like an episode of Nip Tuck. And yes I am the best man, I'm so sorry bout the mix up. Come out and play, pour out another bottle. Lets do it all today and worry bout it all tomorrow. I do it for the thrill. You know I love the rush. And once you get me going I can never get enough. [Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]. I grew tired of the same, then one night. Packed my things, told the one I love. I'll be back one day. Through the fight, through the pain. Booked a flight, took a plane. Told her not to cry.

Yeh, yeh, I'm honest I landed in a rocket. With a crown inside my watch and silver B sign on my bonnet. You don't need a thermometer to tell you who's the hottest. Ip dip do muthaf-cker you are not it. Come out and play, pour out another bottle. Lets do it all today and worry bout it all tomorrow. I do it for the thrill. You know I love the rush. And once you get me going I can never get enough. [Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]. I grew tired of the same, then one night. Packed my things, told the one I love. I'll be back one day. Through the fight, through the pain. Booked a flight, took a plane. Told her not to cry. I'll be back one day. [Tinie Tempah - Verse 2]. Ok I'm in it, I'm in it to the finish. I keep them bottles coming like my card aint got no limit. Got some friends that playing football. And some friends that playing cricket. And a mistress that is fine like a f-cking parking ticket. Haha. I said I'm in it, I'm in it til the finish. I keep them bottles coming til there aint nothing in it. I'm like Mario on mushrooms. I'm like Popeye on some spinach. We gon keep it coming till I no speaka no english. Ahh. [Chorus]. I grew tired of the same, then one night. Packed my things, told the one I love. I'll be back one day. Through the fight, through the pain. Booked a flight, took a plane. Told her not to cry. I'll be back one day"

witch doctor (feat. candice pillay),"VERSE. She say she wanna get in on that rapper shit. Popping bottles stuffing money under mattresses. She been on that tour bus since I picked her up at Hammersmith. Her arse so round I thought it had to be a camera trick. Eh, where you going in them Izzy Marants?. Hop on a train come and chill with me and Dizzee in France. Hop on a tplan you can come to any city you want. I got the fame you could be on Nicole Bitchie tomorrow. Couldn't never love a lippy yat. But she got me acting like a pussy for that kitty cat. Reverse cow girl, reverse piggy back. I thought you said your arse was mine, come and gimme that!. Witch doctor woman x 8. VERSE. She said she wanna get in on that rapper shit. She wanna polish the awards up in my cabinet. She a ten, she defy the law of averages. Thought she Catholic but that Rihanna tat in Arabic. Where you runnin' in that pretty Givenchi Dress. I'll intro you to Westwood buy you Vivienne's garms. The alcohol that she ingests just hope her liver ain't harmed. I bring her flowers but she says she want a stickier plant. From trips on a bus now she's on a trip and a buzz. When lighting strikes wonder if God is taking pictures of us. We finally made it on our own through all the hicks and the cups. Maybe some magic came and cured this fucking sickness in us. From not giving a fuck. Now she's in her giving a fuck. I made her feel like Lewis Hamilton was picking her up. Don't even mind the other groupies and the strippers and stuff. No time to waste might as well face it you're addicted to love. 'cause I am sick. What you prescribing. Give me a fix. Sip on a cocktail of lots of shit we shouldn't mix. Yeaah"

written in the stars (feat. eric turner),"Oh written in the stars. A million miles away. A message to the main. Ooooh. Seasons come and go. But I will never change. And I'm on my way. Lets go. Yeah. You're listening now. They say they aint heard nothing like this in a while. Thats why they play my song on so many different dials. Cause I got more hits than a disciplined child. So When they see me everybody brrrrrap's, brrrrrraps. Man I'm like a young gun fully black barrack. I cried tear drops over the massive attack. I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat. Look at my jacket and hat. So damn berserk. So down to earth. I'm bringing gravity back. Adopted by the major I want my family back. People work hard just to get all their salary taxed. Look im just a writer from the ghetto like malory blackman. Where the hells all the sanity at, damn. I used to be the kid that no one cared about. Thats why you have to keep screaming til they hear you out. Oh written in the stars. A million miles away. A message to the main. Ooooh. Seasons come and go. But I will never change. And I'm on my way. Yeah, I needed a change. When we ate we never took because we needed a change. I needed a break. For a sec I even gave up believing and praying. I even done the legal stuff and was leaded astray. They say money is the root to the evilist ways. But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake. Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed. Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam. Since the day I thought of that cunning plan. One day I had a dream I tried to chase it. But I wasn't going nowhere, running man!. I knew that maybe someday I would understand. Trying to change a tenner to a hundred grand. Everyones a kid that no-one cares about. You just got to keep screaming until they hear you out. Oh written in the stars. A million miles away. A message to the main. Ooooh. Seasons come and go. But I will never change. And I'm on my way. Oh written in the stars. A million miles away. A message to the main. Ooooh. Seasons come and go. But I will never change. And I'm on my way"
