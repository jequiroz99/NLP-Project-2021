I rep them five letters forever. Will someone just tell the bartender to mix my drink. While I mix my thoughts my business in pleasure, I'm clever. Long money all around me. I just hope I live long enough, long enough to measure. We should take pictures sippin' Cristal in COOGI sweaters. And I'm still getting better nigga, what's better?.

bang,"[Verse 1: Lil Twist]. I put the kush in the stogey, yeah, I put the Bentley in Drive. I'm pulling out the garage, and thanking God I'm alive. I've been through so much shit, been through trouble and back. I ain't do much time, but dawg I ain't going back. These niggas fake and they phony, the paparazzi wait on me. I left the jail in Givenchy, they should have posted that homie. I'm in the A with Rich Homie, I'm in the A with 2 Chainz. I'm in the A with my brother, it's YMCM Rich Gang. Now tell them niggas line up, I tell them niggas time up. This KTZ gon' stand out, it's clear I don't give a fuck. In my closet I eat you up, my fashion ill - no duh. My whip game insane uh Ferrari Testarossa's. Y'all niggas thought I lost it, I'm awesome. I just took a break to teach a young nigga how to boss it. Like when KG went to Boston. Or when Melo went to the Knicks. And he brought JR Smith and they both started ballin'. Big bro went from serving birds to pelicans in New Orleans. Let me take a break, let me catch my breath. Rolling with the Birdman homie, it's YM over everything. Nigga, I don't need nothing else. It's Lil Twist, nigga, I'm checked in. I fucked homegirl and her best friend. You don't wanna miss out on your blessing. Got the dope dick and I use it as a weapon. I just. [Hook]. Shooter, BANG (x5). . [Verse 2: Euro]. Sometimes I think I'm Michael Jordan, Michael Tyson. Michael Phelps and Michael Jackson. Might just drop my fucking tape and fuck around, it might go platinum. How'd I do that off of freebies? Fill my double cup with ether. Got the same buzz as niggas with an album off of features. See I'm doing it again, got a tool in the timbs, now the rules gotta bend. No tools in the gym but I gotta bring it in. Because niggas wanna flex, but they really slim Jim. Gotta point it at him, him, fuck it and him. All I wanna do is kill kill for the ching ching. Got a best friend and the best friend got a twin. Gotta fit 'em all in, now that's a win win win win. The room's spinning cause I'm faded. Watch how you run up on these businessmen, they're gang related. I said I like the way she dance, she like the way I made it. Fuck me without paying the rent, imagine if I paid it. I owe you one girl, I owe you one's. Money always been the main attraction. Homie told me women always been the main distraction. And I'm too focused, I just hate to get disturbed. I'm busy making millions and she just started laughing. So you know I had to. [Hook]. . [Verse 3: Cory Gunz]. Wanting manners when I don't even want a mask on. War paint like a baboon and my bitch got a red ass on. Young Money Cash Money to the dirt of me. So for certainly I'mma get my blast on. To the face of a fuck nigga trying to fuck with us. Think they can make it if they can run a decathlon. Stay blazing, I mack on, play brave and get back home. With them AK's, crack arms with a straight face, that calm. And I fain gaze and attack on with a straight razor in that palm. Any nigga want it he gotta get it. The Yappa got it rolling and rocking with it. I got a nigga showing and popping, picking and going. Packing a fight, everybody hit the floor, he shot the men and boom. Pall bearers, cold moms, militia all Bishop's, O-Dawg's. You should've drove off, hitting on bitches and poor dogs. Looking the nose off, looking like I'm flicking the stove off. When I'm kicking the stove off, kicking the doors off. Everybody hit the deck, still bodies get thrown off. Say making a remarkable pay. Meeting grandpa at a doc or a bay. Bad bitch, hide the grippers, I may. Fucking killing unbook, come the coppers and spray. Twizzie get the chicken, they plot him hopping the gate. If you get to trippin' then you get shot in the face. You ain't got the bitch in the kitchen popping the safe. Sorry to say, no eye witness, you finish you gotta bang. [Hook]"

induction speech,"[Intro]. This is my Hall of Fame Induction Speech. You're far too kind. Check. [Verse 1]. We went from quarter Juices from the corner to wine glasses. We pass blunts thinking bout the past as the time passes. I went from roaming hallways with a backpack trynna find classes. To ducking off of girls that snuck backstage trynna find passes. Went from Ripped shoes looking through hand-me-downs trying to find my look. And now it's an overlook the water views thanks to my Rhyme book.

I'm reminded, Forgot to text mack that I made it I typed that I made it. He hit me back like check in I told him I appreciate it, like twice. Scoop me up in the ghost and headed to the skatepark. Bumping some old Jigga, The same song I think it played like twice. Under the street lights in Miami thinking damn this is life. With no hype, never dropped a song, I'm just saying I'm nice. Trying to prove Scanty right, the only one that kept saying I'm nice. And all along he believed in me, all along. I'm out to prove wrong whoever said I would do wrong motherfucker. And stunna went from Birdman, to Stunna to Uncle Stunna. And Tune went from Lil Wayne, to Tune to my big brother. Man slim just told me it's my time I gotta call my mother. And tell her. [Hook]. [Refrain]. Yeah, that's some real shit. But I don't think I'm done yet. Check. [Verse 3]. I've waited, days after days, I've grown, age after age. I've ripped page after page, Now I'm running, stage after stage. With a story, coming form nothing to dinner in a house with mad stories. Now every night's trill we leave the club with mad stories. Now bad bitches love me and good girls go bad for me. I'm having a good night, drinking everything that's bad for me. I'm on all of that, all because I can sorta rap. I mean kinda sorta I'm all that.

moment,"[Intro]. They say baby how you do it?. Never question greatness. Never question greatness. Tell 'em never question greatness. I just do it. I'm so high I feel weightless. All my shooters are courageous. And. [Hook]. Ain't a moment 'till I make it. It ain't a monent 'till I make it. Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery. And see lately. All I've been doin' is celebratin'. Don't even know what I'm celebratin'. I know why you ain't celebratin'. cause you ain't sellin' natethin'. I got niggas catchin' cases. while we out here catchin' breaks. And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it. Do yourself a favor, save yourself cause I can't save yah. [Verse 1]. Know you see me in that Rolls Royce. glass house, that nigga. hands down. No givin' up, no layin' down, all red, ant pile. My oldest son just turned five. I said ""Lil nigga, you a man now"". Ride around with that strap out cause that Rolls Royce. glass house. I just got a text that said ""Baby I just cashed out"". Whack weed get ashed out. put Persian rugs in the crack house. All y'all that lashed out, I'll come see what that's 'bout. But you don't need to call the fireman. to put a mothafuckin' match out. I can't remember my last drought. all my niggas' smashmouth. Got pure coke, brand new birds. we get 'em as soon as they hatch, slime. And you know the driveway too big. when you ain't gotta back out. Paper chase like cat mouse, my nigga it. [Hook]. Ain't a moment 'till I make it. It ain't a monent 'till I make it. Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery. And see lately. All I've been doin' is celebratin'. Don't even know what I'm celebratin'. I know why you ain't celebratin'. cause you ain't sellin' natethin'. I got niggas catchin' cases. while we out here catchin' breaks. And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it. Do yourself a favor, save yourself. cause I can't save yah. [Verse 2]. Know you see me cause my roof all in my trunk. Know he dead when the horn honk. Niggas say they kings, they lyin'. boy you talkin' to the card shark. I already made my mark, please don't think I just pop corks. Got these voices in my head screamin', can't believe. they're not hoarse. Bitch I've been a beast since cartoon sheets. It's real on the field, I need new cleats, outgrew these. Catch you while you sleep. turn your sheets to maroon sheets. Them choppers turn your homeboys into amputees. And that's not a good look. momma was a chef, but daddy cooked the work. Said ""I know it stank but it's good"". Look, we treat them triggers like repeat buttons. Leave it all out there, leave nothin'. Like the world a crystal ball, I keep rubbin' it. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. Can't nobody save yah. New Orleans pride and savior. Nigga this that Carter 5. I feel like, feel like I'm on my final caper. Uh, and I'm about to smoke one. pass out, OG kush, hashed out. She only want alcohol and trees. fuck that, you gotta branch out. I camp out by a rat house, wait 'till he turn the lamp out. Still drownin' in the fuckin' money, y'all niggas. look like y'all swam out. In this bitch, gats out in this bitch. She say she can come and help my fat wallet get fit. I told her that's not in this script, I don't see that in the script. I'm smokin', gettin' head, lookin' down tryna read lips. [Hook x2]. Ain't a moment 'till I make it. It ain't a monent 'till I make it. Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery. And see lately. All I've been doin' is celebratin'. Don't even know what I'm celebratin'. I know why you ain't celebratin'. cause you ain't sellin' natethin'. I got niggas catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks. And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it.
