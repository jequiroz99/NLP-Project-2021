alright,"just kick a little somethin' for them cars that be bumpin'. somethin' real smooth. you can just ride to. tell me how you feel. here we go.... The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright. Went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight. I was loced out Kris Kross shirts and khakis. Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac. See the bell rang and I got my dash. Fellin' good cause it was the last day of school and I passed. No moms trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'. To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'. The downtown scene was packed. People screamin' from they ride to my ride and to the Mac. I says ""What I am is what I am is who I be"". And yall should have seen how they was tryin' to get to me. Cool, cause dissin' and no pay. They're the reason why we are who we are to this very day. And all that love keeps me and Chris tight. Long as we give some love back everything's alright.. Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood. And I see the one that used to do the dirt then turned good. Little kids try to be like me with the braids, the shades, some pants,. and some Nikes, G. And yet more letters, and the letters sayin'. ""I'm your number one fan could you write me back man?"". Yesssss...... I try to pass 'em my autograph. I try to do as many as I can. Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood. Ain't nobody dissin' and a nigga thinks he's too good. Cause I'm down like four flat tires. Just a little nappy headed kid from the proj.. Showin' I can do right and not do wrong. Rappers and the Beejees comin' up strong. And we ain't got no love for the side. We only love those who love us back. Right?. Now people seem to think what I do is a blast. Cause I'm always on the road and I'm makin' some cash. But they don't know. Really know. The pressure it is for some kids tryin to make it in this here biz. Early mornin' interviews then we step to school. Step from school. Back to interviews then it's on to other dues. So, warm it up Chris. I said ""Ya warm it up Chris"". That's what I was born to do. Now throw your hands in the air and wave from side-to-side. If the feelin' thatcha feelin' is the feelin' of pride. See, I ain't come out wack I come out right. Unlike those 'mose who tried to pass the mike. It's the Daddy Mac. Big thing. Everything is real but you wanna dis cause a nigga sold a couple mill.. Look here, ya can't say nothin' if ya last in a line. So when you dis it just lets me know I'm on your mind. And it's alright"

I found a spot, jumped out. My girl was hot, no doubt. And that was all I heard these bustas talkin' about. Now I ain't payin' no attention to this high school skit. And I ain't even tryin' to fight over this here dip. I kept walkin', but all they did was follow. Tryin' to flex. Talkin' about ym girls titties. And the jewels around my neck. Now I can feel a confrontation bout to jump on off. And I can see these little bustas. Tryin' to play me for soft. I heard ""stick up, stick up, get down and don't look up.

i missed the bus,"I missed the bus.. I missed the bus... I missed the bus.. I missed the bus... [Verse 1]. I went to bed late but I didn't think late would EFFECT ME. Early came around then late wouldn't LET ME. Wake up - WAKE UP -so I can get dressed. I guess my body was mad 'cause I gave it no rest. And when I finally did awake it was a quarter to 8:00. Jumped in the shower and I know I was late. Stepped out put on my jeans and my uni'. And said to myself if I miss school I'm ruined. But I ran down hill and I RUSHED RUSHED. I ran down the hill TRYIN TO CATCH THE BUS. Now I'm hopin to myself everything is cool. Standin on my block like a fool. But I'm all alone and the bus is gone. if I miss school this weekend I'll be at home. Can somebody come real fast to my rescue. I'm stuck at the crib and I don't know what to do. [Chorus: repeat 2x]. I missed the bus [ohh]. I missed the bus. I missed the bus [ohh]. And that is somethin I will never ever ever do again. [verse 2]. I was up - HE WAS UP - but I laid back down. Thinkin I could chill 'til the time came around. And I did - HE DID - but a little too long. Cause when I woke up yo the bus was gone. I almost broke my neck, tryin to get out the door. And I chased the bus 'til my feet was sore. On the trail - THE TAIL - but I couldn't catch up. I guess it must have been my day for me to have bad luck. Cause I lost my lunch money, book bag busted. Scuffed up my sneakers and I'm really disgusted. And when I got to school it was the same old thing. Stepped in the class and the school bell rang. It was nothin I could do, I tried to explain. But the teacher treated me like I was playin a game. YOU LOSE YOU LOSE - the day was a no win. I learned to never miss my bus again. [Chorus]"
