Don't make me admit. Chose me, class closed. Then we made a hit). Under the redlight, you mean, ain't no stopping here?. She told me that's right. You want all of my attention, no at ease. Told me what you want, I get you on your knees. I got so much work overseas they need the visa. My neck, my wrist, looking flashy like the police. Pills and titties, I swear I was in Ibiza. Taking shots now so I know you aim to please. She getting checks, I keep the telly. Cancel the membership at Follies. I work her out and give her tips. Do Pilates on the dick. I'm getting dough, I'm getting rolls now. She got some buddies, tell 'em roll out. Money, like clothes is hard to fold now. Back to back, that coca sold out. They not stashing when it's cold now. Under the redlight, you mean, ain't no stopping here?. She told me that's right. You want all of my attention, no at ease. Told me what you want, I get you on your knees. I got so much work overseas they need the visa. My neck, my wrist, looking flashy like the police. Pills and titties, I swear I was in Ibiza. Taking shots now so I know you aim to please"

break up to make up,"Yo, why should we break up if we keep makin' up?. I mean, let's just stay together. I know together we make this relationship. A little harder at least on ourselves. We give in, we take from each other so much. That I feel we don't need no one else. We fuss and we fight then the next day we tight. This is crazy girl, you need some help. Girl if you pull up to my window, I'ma take your order. Anythin' you want, girl, you know I get it for ya. Say you wanna be my baby, you know I gotta spoil ya. For the rest of my life, I'm ready to enjoy us. So why the hell we break up if we only make up?. I ain't gonna stop, never gotta front. You're the only one I want girl. So why the hell we break up if we only make up?. We woke with the birds into soft spoken words. That will lead you right into my arms. The perfect equation like mx + b. Equals why we are probably apart. No one on this earth feels like Miss Butterworth. There's someone I'd do anything for. It seems like you're pouring your heart away. But if you pull up to my window, I'ma take your order. Anythin' you want, girl, you know I get it for ya. Say you wanna be my baby, you know I gotta spoil ya. For the rest of my life, I'm ready to enjoy us. So why the hell we break up if we only make up?. I ain't gonna stop, never gotta front. You're the only one I want girl. So why the hell we break up if we only make up?. In the middle of the night, I'll be wonderin' why. Why you ain't right here?. Many days go by, and I ain't gonna lie. I need you right here. My baby after all call me crazy, but you're like a drug. Seems like it's daily we get back in love. Cupid in the sky 'cause girl you know I love you. And I know sometimes we struggle. You are the piece to the puzzle, come here take a ride. So won't ya pull up to my window? I'ma take your order. Anythin' you want, girl, you know I get it for ya. Say you wanna be my baby, you know I gotta spoil ya. For the rest of my life, I'm ready to enjoy us. So why the hell we break up if we only make up?. I ain't gonna stop, never gotta front. You're the only one I want girl. So why the hell we break up if we only make up?"
buh bye,"Yup, Yup. Can’t do it (Can’t do it). She says she love me. Then she loves me not. But she don’t hate me, if I kick her out my spot. Cause darling lately seems, we’ve been growing apart.

How did it all just slip away? (away). Seems so right at the beginning. Now it seems so close to the ending. Like we just friends, I need to breathe again (ohh yeah).

It reminds me of the long nights and the good ol’ love we made (ohh yeah). And now I just can’t forget it, mind stuck with it. [ Jeremih Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ]. Don’t remember the last time I hit it. Breathe again, I need to breathe again (ohh yeah). And when I call yah, the voice mail I get (you reached Toya).

But you don’t hate me, if I kick you out my spot. Cause darling lately, seems we’ve been growing apart. I don’t know how much more I could take this.

Tonight we be takin' off flight with a camera to show out. (Verse 2: Jeremih). I got you in the air, your body in the air. How it feel up here?. You can scream as loud as you want, and loud as you can. And ain't nobody gonna hear. Would you like it better. If I hit the west coast?. Tell me, if you 'bout that life right now. I hope it ain't talk. (Pre-Hook: Jeremih). I can put you in the Mile High Club, what's up?. Let's take a trip. Have you ever read ""The World Is Yours"". On a blimp?. (Bridge: Jeremih). Tell her be free, baby spread your wings. Got your legs in the sky like a plane. Let me guide that, I'm the pilot. Can't nobody see you 30 thousand feet. On your knees in them Prada's. Makin' freaky shit come up out her. (Hook: Jeremih). Get high baby roll one, cloud nine, 'bout to go up. Lovin' the feelin' the turbulence get when we turn up. When we land we can roll out. Show you somethin' you ain't know about. Tonight we be takin' off flight with a camera to show out. (Verso 3: J. Cole). Cole World, I got it, I got it, I got it, listen. You need a nigga that's gon' come over and dig you out. You need a nigga that you know is not gon' run his mouth. You need a nigga when he done probably gon' put you out. You need a nigga that's gon' put it in your mouth. Dick so big it's like a foot is in yo' mouth. And y'ain't babysitting, but my kids all on yo' couch. And oh, you nasty, oh, oh, you nasty. Both graduated so fuck keepin' it classy. Look, they love me in the Chi like Mj. They love me in the Chi like Oprah. No nigga could block, not even Dikembe. Compared to Cole, boy, you're softer than a sofa. And so far my new shit's so fire, nigga, check my profile. Who you know make waves in a low tide?. Deebo'ed yo' bitch, now she both ours. Nigga, little brown liquor in my liver. Pretty brown thang in my bed. Been a long time since I had to ask for head. So god damn don't make me beg. But I will if I need to cause for real, girl, I need you. I could put you on a flight, we could take off tonight. If you scared of heights, shit I got a pill I could feed you. Cole. (Pre-Hook: Jeremih). I can put you in the Mile High Club, what's up?. Let's take a trip. Have you ever read ""The World Is Yours"". On a blimp?"

runaway,"[Verse 1:]. You see the flashy lights. It's like a movie scene. Them stunna shades got you lookin like a beauty queen. Without a throne. American, but international. She got her hair done. Styled in designer jeans. Heels on, and her skin type Maybelline. I can't control. The way you walkin, girl, you got me gone. [Chorus:]. When I see her, my mind goes to places. I just can't focus when she's on the stage. It's the way she switches her hips with her body. Just proves she's truly the life of the party now. Look at her. She got it. Shawty knows she's the shit. You can tell by the look in her eyes. She's like the devil in disguise. When she's on the runway. Walkin down the runway. Sexy down the runway. Take a picture on the runway. [Verse 2:]. The show is sold out. They say she's popular. When she comes out, everybody's watchin her.. She's got the crown. Lookin seductive, but still holds a smile. She's like an angel. I'd say she's heaven sent. From head to toe, lil mama's visual medicine you should see. This shawty's hotter than the third degree. [Chorus]. Wait a minute. Strike a pose. Take a picture (click). And girl I gotta know your name. Is it Mary Jane?. [Chorus]. L.p."
