Hall of game shit made me legendary. I'm fresh just for a reason. Winter time, boo no it's february. But these sweats is from next season. See my catalog's never sandal soft. Like of porn we go matador. For crazy bread we go padded walls. Cop a Swisher Sweet and the pack of drawers. And I'm barely dusting my mantel off. Shit eighth grade bro nigga ran Toros. Baby tell them hoes who the camo boss. Who the same nigga when the camera's off, huh?. She want that Gmb. She want that Gmb. She want that Gm that Gm that Gmb. Yeah, we on top. Nah, we won't quit. Nah, we don't stop. Na-ah, we don't lose"

Large money when we ride to these beats it's like soccer the clits. Do my thing since packers and petes. Burn nigga stay opposite me. No parley with me we move shit but the dolly with me. New sense, new sense pocket's gotta be deep. Got a 40 year old milf and she college in free. You ain't even seen the sky on me or the balance. Still keep the essence but the bitches ain't a challenge. So they come to talk like I run around with dalvin. That fly nigga shit only run around in calvin. It's alright, don't clap for me. It's all good, don't clap for me. It's all love, it's all love. Enough is enough man this shit don't cut a got big time. Playing with a small time budget. Big time moves no money to back it. Back to the point where I'm packing a ratchet. Live by the guns still dodging the casket. Break bad bitches got 'em spot in the plastic. Keep your face down spread eagle on the mattress. A full moon that's exactly what that ass is. Puff puff pass this, strooky with my niggas. Stop the small time grind boy it's time to think bigger. Time to think scrilla' fuck what they say. Tryin' to think fast get paid the same way. It's alright, don't clap for me. It's all good, don't clap for me. It's all love, it's all love"

no superman,"I already know I ain't invincible now. We in these nigga scopes. Mama said the realest ones always got to strip the cope. Fuck all the fame we gon' lead the game with our soul. Jedi minded we ain't never change niggas know. That's how this shit go they build you up to back you down. Though it's wrong nigga chain smoke and black and malls. Four sips from black channel one song from bill gaten. Classics in the catalogue niggas still hating. Not from trees but from cheese nigga still hanging. Lost my heart with my brother but we still kept playing. Life's a catch, 22, put a spark to my blunt. Round my stress in the blue I ain't superman. Super. I ain't superman. Super. I ain't superman. Super. You ain't superman. Super. I ain't superman. Super. I ain't superman. Super. You ain't superman. Super. You ain't superman. We start out like tap holes in mama's tummy.

Eyes hazy blowing on kush crazy. Less tv more books lately home body. Flow galley, dress look crazy. Nigga think I'm from the bush baby. Bars make 'em push daisies. Alpha omega, problem is solution. And your in conclusion. In the start and the finish. In the thuggle war between this art and this business. This why a nigga got to play it smart with decisions. A cold symbolism and his art pay attention. Pegan messages these niggas lost their religion. Make them false prophets the rhyme prophets. They get fate to choose confront them they go off topic. Don't compare me to these prop objects. You wouldn't compare fred segal to hot topic. All braids and beads yea it's called logic. Getting braid from freaks we meet at your college. We using raw knowledge. Narc shoppers all conscience like quarley. Niggas think I'm walley women wanna parlay. When I was down and out ain't nobody wanna calm me. See me on my grind now they all late, but I ain't no superman. Super. I ain't superman. Super. I ain't superman. Super. You ain't superman. Super. I ain't superman. Super. I ain't superman. Super.

truth,"Ayo, swiff, this the type of jam I like. Real talk, you a jedi knight, and with this lead I write. Random thoughts on this red eye flight. Fantasize waking up to some head I like. Such a lovely face. As we campaign over champagne. Might I say such a bubbly taste. Thumbing back to memories, if I could just erase. Hey girl, don't be so thirsty love, pump your brakes. We ain't stopping no time soon, it's bucks to make. If you bet against up, we just up the stakes. When a real nigga show just cuff your date. She keep looking in my eyes like there's love to make. She keep digging in your wallet for some bucks to rake. She keep looking for a ride cause the bus run late. I mean the proof is up front, there ain't much debate. We the livest three niggas in the fucking state. I mean - it ain't much to say. We the pioneers spitting, not pioneer chicken. If I got it then my niggas do - that's the ritual. Taking money fast, fuck the waiting on residuals. Barkleys with the sweats, I can show you how my fit'll do. Two dollar swisher, situation's getting critical. I should've told ya, my yoga broads? With boca. For the verse, we get what niggas get to cook the coke up. Oh the nerve of pretty bitches when they on the gold hunt. I remains I'm shuttlesworth when I put the stroke up. We go strangle 'fore we bojangle. It's pac div, no lie baby, no tangles. If you ain't hip to the game, play a ho's angle. Learn not to fuck with niggas rocking old kangols. This that white tee music, killer, no label. Swiff soul food like he set the whole table. Through the years, I've seen? Business, groupie bitches. Crowds looking at us like ""who's these niggas? "". Real life, it's not a movie nigga. She bad but her pussy's like blue cheese nigga. God forgive me as I kill these niggas. God be with me like ""yo kill these niggas! "". City slickers like billy crystal. With thc crystals and billie jean bitches. Mr. Green with this, listerine and shit. He talk money then I can probably read his lips. He talk funny well then he might can beat the shit. My whole team jump in, he got creamed and shit. Probably need this shit, retweet this shit. Then repeat this shit cause y'all reek of shit, truth"

He taking flicks, looking as hot as a liquid nitrogen. And if he don't wanna king. than I guess you'll have to fight with him. MM, excitement, nobody looks as nice as him. Told him ""drive safe. cause I heard that you just got your license, man. "". I know he real, and you gon' have a great time. You'll be fine, cause your date got waves at the prom. "".

Tryna dodge the cemetery and the over packed jail. I don't sell no crack, I don't stand on no corner. Got my life in order. No wife, no daughter. No house that I own, but the house I call home. Is my mama's with a couch that pulls out when its on. And I still do my thang yo, life ain't a game yo. Still on a search for that gold under the rainbow. Back in high school I used to have a nice game yo. Now I work at a grocery store stocking draino. Dang yo, damn yo. Little black sand boat. My boss is gonna make me flip out, like rambo.

Hem you up, vultures. No sudden moves, they gon say you got explosives. Damn these niggas bogus. I'm dippin in the focus. Got my check, tryna hit the bank for the close it. Young black males always seem to fit the culprit. Make a u-turn, 10-4 and they on it. Have you on the most wanted. Call it all a mix up. When its time to go home, and they shifts up.
