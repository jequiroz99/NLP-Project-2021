coming home (feat. skylar grey),"[Hook: Skylar Grey]. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming home. Let the rain wash away, all the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming. [Intro: Diddy]. I'm back where I belong (yeah). I never felt so strong (I'm back baby). I feel like there's nothing I can't try. And if you feel me put your hands high (put your hands high). If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you. And you, the dreams are for you. [Verse 1]. I hear ""The Tears of a Clown"". I hate that song. I always feel like they're talking to me, when it comes on. Another day, another dawn. Another Keisha, nice to meet ya. Get the math, I'm gone. What am I suposed to do when the club lights come on?. It's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean. What if my twins ask why I ain't marry their mom (why? damn!). How do I respond?. What if my son stares with a face like my own. And says he wants to be like me when he's grown?. Shit! But I ain't finished growing. Another night, the inevitable prolongs. Anothey day, another dawn. Just say Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'. Another lie that I carry on. I need to get back to the place I belong. [Hook: Dirty Money]. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming home. Let the rain wash away, all the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming. [Verse 2]. ""A house is Not a Home,"" I hate this song. Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?. And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it. And you know you would have took the bullet if you saw it. But you felt it and still feel it. And money can't make up for it or conceal it. But you deal with it and you keep ballin'. Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'. Baby, we've been living a sin cause we've been really in love. But when we've been living as friends. So you've been a guest in your own home. It's time to make your house your home. Pick up your phone, come on. [Hook: Dirty Money]. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming home. Let the rain wash away, all the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming. [Verse 3]. ""Ain't No Stopping Us Now,"" I love that song. Whenever it comes on, it makes me feel strong. I thought I told y'all that we won't stop. Til we back cruising through Harlem, Viso blocks. It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy. Drove me away then embraced me. Forgave me for all of my shortcomings. Welcome to my homecoming. Yeah, it's been a long time coming. Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles. Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs. Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you BIG). And here I stand, a better man (a better man) (don't stop). Thank you lord (thank you lord). [Hook: Dirty Money]. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming home. Let the rain wash away, all the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming"
missing you,"Yeah, this right here goes out to everyone who's lost someone that they. truly loved..... Check it out..... Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show. I laced the track, you locked the flow. So far from hangin' on the block for dough. Notorius they got to know that. Life ain't always what it seem to be. Words can't express what you mean to me!. Even though you're gone we still a team. Thru your family I'll fulfill your dreams. In the future can't wait to see if you'll. Open up the gates for me. Reminisce sometime the night they took my friend. Try to black it out, but it plays again. When it's real feelings hard to conceal. Can't imagine all the pain I feel. Give anything to hear half your breath. I know you still livin' your life after death. CHORUS:. Every step I take. Every move I make. Every single day. Everytime I pray. I'll be missing you. Thinking of the day. When you went away. What a life to take. What a bond to break. I'll be missing you. (We miss you, Big....). It's kinda hard wit you not around. Know you in Heaven smilin' down. Watching us while we pray for you. Everyday we pray for you. Till the day we meet again. In my heart is where I keep you friend. Memories give me the strength I need to proceed. Strength I need to believe. My thoughts, Big, I just can't define. Wish I could turn back the hands of time. Us and the six shop for new clothes and kicks. You and me takin' flics. Makin' hits, stages they receive you on. Still can't believe you're gone. Give anything to hear half your breath. I know you still livin' your life after death. CHORUS. Somebody tell me why.... On that morning. When this life is over. I know, I'll see your face. Every night I pray. Every step I take. Every move I make. Every single day. Every night I pray. Every step I take. Every move I make. Every single day. Every night I pray. Every step I take. Every move I make. Every single day. Every night I pray. Every step I take. Every move I make. Every single day. Chorus.

Won't reach out, and ya bet I won't visit. 'til my whole wardrobe is-it, now listen. (Chorus). Make this money, take this money (Let's get it). Ain't no way you can take this from me (Let's get it).

Front but you lookin. Once I throw the hook in proceed to get cookin. with the game when I sewed it. Since you came thought I owed you one. Wide big Lincoln, why's this guy on the side for the stinking?. Watch task force dash forward lookin marveled. It's a big chance, big pants, might guard him. with my man's type proper. Better learn quick, cause my clique don't argue. You ain't my crew, who are you? Beat it. 'fore we take off make sure you all seated. In Billboard read it, believe it. (Chorus). [G-Dep]. Soul Controller, rap Ayatollah. Kids hate me when they older I put cracks by the stroller. I'm registered voter, motherfuck a quota. Give some bakin soda and a quarter. Bet I flow straight up out the water. I'ma wreck the game 'til it say ""out of order"". Put the high score up. Then tear the floor up. On the world tour with your whore out in Europe. Head on the tour bus. Do what them niggaz in the drop thinks cooler. Called up five reporters to thank my supporters. Hittin wives and daughters. Brought 'em neck spray from Estee Lauders. Call Puffy to order. [P-Diddy]. Aiyyo, call me Diddy - I run this city. Send the cops, the D.A. and feds to come get me. Cats wanna leave me for dead you comin with me.

Cause I can, break backs and stacks it's no problem. Make raps and tracks and go Harlem. I get worldwide coverage. Got so many spots I don't even buy luggage, ya love it. Make moves major, hide out in Asia. If your girl keep comin around them I'm a blaze her. I'm the Bad Boy flavor, light blue gators. NOT GUILTY, and I'm filthy, c'mon. (Chorus). [Black Rob (Puffy)]. I be the Eastside Soprano, Rob Marciano. Flow in e'ry channel with the Iverson handle. Forty-five sparks turn your day gray flannel. Snatch the yay of the mantle, then proceed to dismantle. Can't slay Rob. How many niggaz done tried to play Rob, quit they day job. Tired of putting broke niggaz under the wing. If I go to jail again I'm goin under the bing. Act like you gon' pull that thing thing. You the only one that always get stuck for bling bling. I represent ""A"" block in Sing Sing. Almost caught a buck fifty for fuckin a Latin King's queen. Moves for paper, booze no chaser. Bullets out the blazer four-fifth with the laser. Come and get your shit splitted, newspapers said I did it. (He ain't do it) Now let's get it (Let's get it). (Chorus) (x3)."

hold up,"[Diddy]. Aiyyo turn me up in my headphones man. I want this shit motherfuckin blarin. It ain't loud enough man. Oh these muh'fuckers think I'm gon' play with 'em. Oh I ain't gon' play wit'cha - I ain't gon play wit'cha man!. Ha ha ha.. I need y'all to sing children. Sing, I like it when the children sing. I like it when you sing; I like it when they sing man. That lets you know something's comin. Oh it's comin - aww man something's comin. I like this sound of this - something's comin. You can picture like a photograph, envision the image. Of one-two-fifth street and Lenox. The old folks their souls are cold like tenants. Tryin to keep your weight up better eat that spinach. For four twenty-five niggaz lives get diminished. The world serious, I'm tryin to win a pennant. Cops be on patrol through the block every minute. Itchin just to pop somethin, swearin I'm a menace. They disturb me but it's love like tennis. Man, cap to the side and my jersey is vintage. Chicks'll make a nigga dick hard like a Guinness. Damn it's a scam but I handle my business. Tryin to be the man if the Lord be my witness. Do my {?} with the walk sign for my physical fitness. 16's sicker than all signed flows it's ridiculous. Hold up. [Chorus: children sing]. Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up. Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up. Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up. Hold up, hold up hold up hold up hold up. [Diddy]. Easy now I'm seein 'em, mind where you patrol. Fall back young'un, play your lane like a goal. When his majesty speaks, speech defy gravity. Bluetooth nigga but I don't have any cavities. Diddy got it wrapped like cocoons. Pop shit like needles through {?} balloons. I urge you to tell a friend, warn a brother. About my splurges, merges with Warner Brothers. Thugs actin funny cause chicks call me honey. See a 9 figure nigga makin Bugs Bunny money. Eons beyond bling bling. So I chose to get engaged to these sweet 16's. Make a name, let it bang so beautiful. The theme music for crews that move pharmaceuticals. Or, suitable for, a recuitable whore. To service the whole crew when we out on tour. Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up. [Chorus]. [Diddy]. It's like the music will literally stop time. (Hold up hold up hold up). We roll up, 20 deep, cock D swoll up. Get inflicted by my verbal conviction. A Bad Boy but far from a Detroit Piston. You're not focused enough, you're not listenin. You need to slow down, hold up like kickstand. Hop to it, get on your grind music. Across 110th sharp caesar with a lime music. Fine-tuned with the proper soul seasoning. Your live shows are boring you're just not pleasin 'em. Stop teasin 'em you can't rock Palladium. We bring New York back like that West side stadium. Fuck the game and if the fame went away. Still be the hardest workin man in entertainment today. Learn a lesson and that's, no questionin that. No guesswork involved so stop stressin the facts. Hold up. [Chorus]"

Till ya know that i'm gone then say don't die. I take what I find, put a beat to they rhyme. Thought it was over but I crept from behind. Wanna try to stop me from speaking my mind. Almost 2000 and running out of time. Almost to the point when I wanna bust nines. A lot of strange faces, I can only trust mine. Soldiers in position all on the front line.

[Verse 1]. Pissed on the motherfucking White House lawn. I threw a rock, then I ran. Cause I couldn't stand anymore within the grip of the man. Y'all wanna ask me who's sane. These biological gasses are eating my brain. Its a political grab bag to rape mother earth. Thirty seconds after they bagged dad for what he's worth. Thousands will die now so millions can smile later. This ain't the +Rockford Files+ nigga. They stockpile data for satellites. Where you discuss who's style is greater. In this killing pool you playing it cool like Kyle Jada. When ya'll ready to rock like Led Zep and Al Qaeda. With weapons of mass destruction an hour later. What's your identidy today?. You on some John F. Kennedy or Timothy McVeigh?. This Henessy done left me with a remedy to spray. For my identity your life is the penalty to pay. Motherfucker. [Monch] {Crowd}.

Damn you that lost the will to live. Trapped in the game. Just tryin to win (3x). [Verse 2]. Its not a Vietnam song. I know women from desert storm who came back deformed. Missin limbs and disease and they legs is numb. Chemicals twice as strong as agent orange. Its messages in the bass drum. War goin off in your mind. No man is safe from. Its not a Game Boy about the PlayStation. Its +Resident Evil+ when every President's a mason. Robbin y'all fools like ?. And y'all inherited roots and don't know how to retrace them. Place them back. Face them facts. Disgraceful, faceless, tasteless acts. Pharoahe takes teh authorities to court. Peep crime before it happens like +Minority Report+. And I will never be mentally defenseless. Cats be on the block, in the hood in the trenches sayin. [Monch] {Crowd}. [Y'all ready to rock?]. {We ready to rock}. [Y'all ready to roll?]. {We ready to roll}. [Hook 3].

best friend (feat. mario winans),"I've seen a lot of things in my life. A lot of ups and downs. Made a lot of mistakes. No matter what you've always been by my side. You've always been my best friend. You're the love of my life. You're everything to me. You've never left my side. I love you so much. You're my best friend. [Verse 1]. Since the beginning of time, all you did was bless men. Too young to understand but now you my best friend. How could they doubt you, never think about you. Don't they know nothing's possible without you?. Faith without fear, that's how they raised me. Words of man kill but never phase me. Grateful for wisdom that you gave me. But still I'm like: ""Dear God, I wonder, could you save me?"". Too much sinning, gotta be more than plush living. Gotta be more than grabbing nines to buck tin in. Gotta be more than just to lust women. Gotta be more than platinum Rolexes, 600's and crushed linen. Praise your name, I know some of them hate to do. Judgment day, don't they know they can't escape your crew?. I'm just trying to live right and pray you take me through. And with this song, I dedicate to you. My Lord. [Chorus]. Lord, you mean the world to me. Before I was born, you chose me. You always hear me when I'm calling. Even catch me when I'm falling. You're the closest one to me. I surrender all to thee. I want the whole wide world to see. That we've always been and we'll always be. Best friends. [Verse 2]. Sometimes I reminisce and wonder how I made it this far. Because of you, I'm me, so you the real star. Your hindsight, the time's right to get my mind tight. Then give it to you and let it shine bright. My best friend only know how to teach the truth. Plant the seeds of life and let them eat the fruit. Can't you see that He spread love for you. Shed blood for you, cry for, and die for you. Willies with Mac millies know how you get down. We know the drama you bring whenever you hit town. Just remember when you pray, God is love. Gracious, merciful, forgive even the hardest thugs. Life as we know it, it all begins with Him. Life as we know it, it all ends with Him. If I was you I would never try to pretend with Him. He might spazz and blow it, I'm best friends with him. Repeat Chorus. [Verse 3]. Been two and a half years, since my man Big passed. Two and a half years, since my world crashed. I needed help, God gave me the power. Gave me the strength to go face to face with my darkest hour. Looked me in the eyes and ask ""What you doing unhappy?"". ""Don't you know why I'm here?"" and started shooting at me. Back to the wall, is my faith gonna play out. Never wavered once, gave me no way out. Your time to die don't even stress the date. You're coming with me your soul I'm next to take. I told him ""I'm too much blessed with faith"". ""And living for Christ"" and then he said ""Manifest the great"". All of a sudden, what I'm remembering. Ground started to shake, everything trembling. The power of the truth was shooting through my Timberlands. Here was my Lord Jesus Christ, my best friend again, come on. Repeat Chorus. [Said Over Chorus]. You mean everything to me. You've been with me from day one. Even when I thought nobody was there. You were there. You're my best friend. I love you like no other. There is no feeling like this in the world. If you can relate to what I'm feeling. Put your hands in the air for me. Let me see you. Naw, matter of fact, clap your hands for me. Clap your hands, come on. Thank you Jesus. You always hear me when I'm calling. Always catch me when I fall, yeah. I surrender all to thee. I want the whole world to see. That you've always been, you'll always be. My best friend. I love you Jesus. Thank you, forgive me for my tresspasses. As I forgive those who tresspass against me. Thank you!"

coming home (feat. skylar grey),"[Hook: Skylar Grey]. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming home. Let the rain wash away, all the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming. [Intro: Diddy]. I'm back where I belong (yeah). I never felt so strong (I'm back baby). I feel like there's nothing I can't try. And if you feel me put your hands high (put your hands high). If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you. And you, the dreams are for you. [Verse 1]. I hear ""The Tears of a Clown"". I hate that song. I always feel like they're talking to me, when it comes on. Another day, another dawn. Another Keisha, nice to meet ya. Get the math, I'm gone. What am I suposed to do when the club lights come on?. It's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean. What if my twins ask why I ain't marry their mom (why? damn!). How do I respond?. What if my son stares with a face like my own. And says he wants to be like me when he's grown?. Shit! But I ain't finished growing. Another night, the inevitable prolongs. Anothey day, another dawn. Just say Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'. Another lie that I carry on. I need to get back to the place I belong. [Hook: Dirty Money]. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming home. Let the rain wash away, all the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming. [Verse 2]. ""A house is Not a Home,"" I hate this song. Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?. And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it. And you know you would have took the bullet if you saw it. But you felt it and still feel it. And money can't make up for it or conceal it. But you deal with it and you keep ballin'. Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'. Baby, we've been living a sin cause we've been really in love. But when we've been living as friends. So you've been a guest in your own home. It's time to make your house your home. Pick up your phone, come on. [Hook: Dirty Money]. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming home. Let the rain wash away, all the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming. [Verse 3]. ""Ain't No Stopping Us Now,"" I love that song. Whenever it comes on, it makes me feel strong. I thought I told y'all that we won't stop. Til we back cruising through Harlem, Viso blocks. It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy. Drove me away then embraced me. Forgave me for all of my shortcomings. Welcome to my homecoming. Yeah, it's been a long time coming. Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles. Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs. Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you BIG). And here I stand, a better man (a better man) (don't stop). Thank you lord (thank you lord). [Hook: Dirty Money]. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming home. Let the rain wash away, all the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming"

It's a Bently to you, to me it's a blue car. So Branson pass me a jar. Cause these cats done went too far. One phone call send two cars. And still get searched by security guards. I guess that's what I have to do. Take the game international. Now what you call me. [Hook Repeat]. (La La La La La La La La La La La La). C'mon work it out girl.

do you know?,"Then, there are the times in my life. When I feel, trapped. Feel there's, no way out. No escape. To be honest, I don't know where my life is goin. Where I'll end up at. I just don't know. Verse One: Puff Daddy. I looked back and saw the cat focus, took notice. Stayed away from the bogus, til his rise began. Phillies stacked his grand played the brokest. til he seemed hopeless, soon to be the dopest, cat comin. Track stunnin, fame singin, his name ringin. Money starts to pile, honeys start to wild. Top notch drop top make everything he drop hot. He dream, visualize, plot and scheme. Got the cream legally without the beam. Witcha fire eye drive slow, 8-5-0. Jet black tint still, they might know. Who the cat controllin the strings of rap and R&ampB. Trapped inside of a movie starrin me, so far. Chorus: repeat 2X. Do you know where you're. goin to?. Do you like the things that. life is showing you?. Where are you going to?. Do you know?. Verse Two: Puff Daddy. Shorty was brimmin, singin, hangin with cats who move bricks. Heard she do backflips, for niggaz who stack chips. Suck for dough, now she fuck for Bills up in Buffalo. Real G's makin her back swell. Only givin head to those niggaz who rapped well. Owned a black cell, flip it, sippin on Whitman cool mints. Rumors spread, half a G she took, six or more. Two bagged up, four went raw. Back of my mind countin up the big score. Violators from the door, she lookin up from the floor. Sore from all the pain her body couldn't ignore. So far from pure, rotten to the core. Either or, for sure, trapped inside the world of a whore. Chorus. Verse Three: Puff Daddy. Hard to cope with, all these niggaz and dope whips. with cash flow, motherfuckers that gotta flash gold. to bag hoes, they not nice, 600 circle the block twice. In they Roleys they rock ice, to get they hit on. Bitches dyin to get on, suck a dick or get shit on. Don't understand they playin wit it. Players get these bitches open and let they man hit it. Fuck that, you can trust that, if I had a gun. I'd release slugs black and bust back. See how these players love that, to the point where. I can't take it, I'm a playa hater, I can't fake it. I wanna spill myself, to feel the thrill myself. And since I can't be a player, wanna kill myself, trust. Chorus w/ variations. I been on this road for a long time now. At time it seems like the road is never gonna end. On this road there's a lotta, hills and mountains. Peaks and valleys. Even a lot of potholes on this road. It's never smooth, on the road of life. I don't know where I'm going. I just know where I wanna end up at. Chorus w/ variations. Lord can you help me get there?. Please let me get there. *piano interlude, Chorus again*."
do you like it... doo you want it... (feat. jay-z),"Jay-Z]. Picture me ballin' in the drop top, open skies. In something foreign, soarin', 145. The God is calling for my body, let my spirit fly. I want it all, no lie. Picture me pourin' poppin' something imported. Pedal flooring, clutch poppin', boppin' to Lauryn. Now picture me falling. [Puffy]. Never seen, never heard, never happened, never occurred. Now picture me flying 10,000 feet above the sea. Popping bubbly, you'd love to be me. Now picture the servants in the cabin with the sweetest massage. Picture having ice and only wanna speak to God. Picture your dreams being shattered and your cream being lavished. At the same time, tell me what you think matters. Picture all the money that I've gotten off tours. Now picture me plotting for more, picture this nigga"
do you see,"Puff Daddy]. Yo Puff Daddy. Get off me. Ladies & gentlemen. You're about to witness something that you've never witnessed before. Sauce Money's in the house & he brought his man with him. I leave rap in a state of shock. Where to rock, from the figures still. Play the block with my niggas. Ill lush, game 20 pounds, but all my niggas still crush. Still stack chips galore. Chicks want out the ghetto, try to hit you raw. Better know that everything I love - roll back. Cop my first gold plaque, soon as my man blew. Still spittin' the fly, hits you can't do nigga. You ain't gainin', you game in, barely maintainin'. I push fly whips without strainin', my cliques smother. Get tougher, hits rougher, Puff is deep in the streets like Chris Tucker. My wrists cluster, on a mobile. P-Diddy, rap mogul, thought I told you that we don't stop. Thought I told you that when I drop, platinum plaques. I cop, push Bentley's without the tops, nigga. [Chorus] (Puff Daddy). Try to see if you see what I see. Give my game & spit my G. When it's all done, stack, funds, & I'm the one. On top is where I be. Tell me, do you see what I see?. (When I look in your eyes, I see you hatin' inside, so tell me). Do you see what I see?. (I know you're hopin' I'm blind, cause you don't want me to shine). [Sauce Money]. No secret, undefeated, I'm top seeded. Whenever I drop hits, you don't want it, you need it. This a hot joint from Sauce, you feel cheated. Unanimous decision, love the way I freak it. Brooklyn, shogun, beat the 4-1. Niggas want to bite off my flow son. I don't think no one, got that, rock a hot track. Like me, nice to the Sauce? Naw. Spit rounds, it's rough did I mention the thorough?. BK forever representin' my borough. Push fly whips, quick to stack my chips. Too easy for you to understand my hits. When the album drops every pocket hold some. Sauce motherfuckin' forever, I told son. Hypnotic, heard the ? war 'fore I shot it. Better cop it, cause all that fly shit, I got it. (Chorus). [PD]. I took rap by the throat & locked it. P-Diddy fixed all those who tried to stop it. Some of y'all tried to blast off, but couldn't rock it. If my flow ain't like a door, how could you knock it?. [Sauce Money] (PD). As a matter of fact, yo don't you hate that? (hate that). Whenever cats playa hatin' from way back (way back). Mad at you, just because they whack (they whack). And I bought your style, older than 8-track (8-track). [PD]. Only way to react though. Make hot joints & stack dough. Laughin' at your whack flow. Try to catch my G. Just so you can rap like me. Act like me. [SM]. Rap like me. But it seems as though you dreamin' a lot. (PD). I'm the cream of the crop. [SM]. Soon to be seen in the drop. (PD). Blow the spot for the not. [SM]. Control the block, watch his name bubble like a soda pop. (PD). When he drop. (Chorus 4X). [Puffy ad-libs throughout chorus]. Sauce Money. Puff Daddy. Bad Boy forever. B.I.G. forever. Hitmen. Prestige, rock on playboy"
don't stop what you're doing (feat. lil' kim),"Chorus:. Don't you stop it, don't. you stop what you're doing. You don't really wanna stop. Eh eh. Don't you stop it, don't. you stop what you're doing. You don't really wanna stop. Eh eh. Verse One: Puff Daddy. Yeah yeah, uh-huh, check it out, yeah, c'mon. Whether you like it hard or the live guitars. Anything dropped if it's hot it's ours. If it's not it's yours, we on the job. Everybody eatin, everybody involved. You can't stop that like you can't stop rap. Bad Boy stop what's the chance of that?. We don't stop, so check the, mansions and stacks. And we don't have to answer to Jack. No wonder we had this rap shit locked, for eight straight summers. Pull up at the party, eight straight Hummers. Six be the 6th 7th and 8th wonders. Pop corks, we be the toast of New York. And out West, we want y'all to understand. All we wanna do is make you dance. We know the song ain't done wrong when the party is hot. Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?. Chorus. Verse Two: Lil' Kim. When it comes to the cheese, baby girl roll dough. Fuck Domino's, strictly dice. Bet you niggaz won't flow for this ice, notes is the price. Lil sis' walk away with the dough, y'all niggaz still broke. While my pockets on re-up. Y'all niggaz shit on E, what a pi-ty. Ain't it a shame how your man chose me. And you wanna know why, it's mad simple. Even in the winter, still pull a baller wit my jimmies. Drive a Ta-hoe, wit plenty cash flow. He know, anything I touch I blow. And I crush a show, wit my luscious flow. Gotta crew full of niggaz and a Lexus too. All of them hold me down while I'm pressin you. So who stressin who, and even though my nigga gone. Lil' Kim and Puff Daddy keep keepin it on. Chorus. Verse Three: Puff Daddy. Now you can pump this in your jeep, on an off road. Pump this to your blows on the way to the tow. Bang this til you're bein old when you at home. on the six-four, sittin on chrome. Yo we don't stall we ball while you playin the wall. We in the middle of the danceflo', gettin off. Gotta bunch of hot chicks gettin live with us. At the end of the night they gonna slide with us. I could tell y'all the rest but it's ob-vious. To the top now, ride with us, c'mon. We don't stop, we run the game, we don't watch. every single region, we own blocks. Never let up, you tell me, who do it better. Every single I drop, at least two are better. The song ain't the wrong when the party is hot. Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?. Chorus. Everything we make is hot. Thought I told you that. we never stop. Keep risin to the top, yeahhh. Keep risin to the top, yeahhh. (repeat above four lines over another Chorus to fade)"
down the line joint,"Verse One: Puffy. When night falls, that's when it all begins. Be prepared we can allow no loose ends. I highly recommend ya'll bring your arms. This is no false alarm. They want to do us harm. Like I'm nervous, live inside a glass house. They want to bring us down. Then drag us out. It's all about niggas that doubt our reputation. Start'n conflict and don't know what they facing. Want twist us all in there black magic. ? suggest paper of wars and break havoc. Are u ready, don't sleep on them. Ain't petty, you get that ass thrown like infedy. Meet me at the getaway spot in a jiffy. Leave all the does behind that act iffy. We got maneuvers, that's hard to beat. Till the other side retreats. Under six feet beneath. C'mon. Verse Two: Mark Curry. I told u that is a saw I wore. I'm a kill. When the rebel yells song that don't stop till. It's done, see I got guns and I m sick. See how you said meet me here and I came quick. Them same catz on the most wanted list. We can hit them, Then straight disappear in the mist. ?,Won't cease to exist. I shoot to kill and I'll be damned if I miss. A warrior waiting for Armageddon. I get serious as hell when I'm threatened. Intent to get hostile break into a rage of fury. Send them back their apostle's fossils and crazed right. A rude awakening and but now I'm alert. And that's right down my line of work. The whole Brotherhood new verse, gutless cowards with no back. And watch how they all fall flat. Ahh. Chorus:. Niggas gone fall out. The got us up against the wall. Here I call out, let it all out. With or without you I'm for war. Som"

fake thugs dedication,"[Puffy]. Aiyyo. One two, one two. One two, one two. This one right here. Goes out to all the fake thugs out there. Yeah, yeah uh huh. Yo, when you say you thuggin', it doesn't matter. It goes into my mind as just chit-chatter. You may say I have a ego, or just merry free. But none of that tough talk I take seriously. It goes in one ear and right out the other. Heard that fake thug shit? brotha. I don't mean to brag, never never hate. You ain't got the bank that it takes to stop this. Ha, ha, ha, ha sucker, you missed. I put feelings aside, you know who I am. P-U-2-F, keys to the U.S.. And I hate when one attempts to analyze. Franchise, get your hands tied.

Everybody hit the floor when the shit drop. Shit knocked, bitch stop (bitch, stop). We roll, we ball, we all night long. We don't stop, nigga's thought the heat was gone. But I'm back to do it again, leader of rhyme. BAD BOY, we turn it to the scene of the crime. Immaculate fame, you can have that shit. I just wanna 'gaitor slide with the baddest bitch. Models and actresses that swallow bottles. That magnum shit. Get nice as fuck, leave when the lights is up. Tear it down when the mics is up. Lately they say Diddy's gettin' nice as hell. Shit, if I don't write it I recite it well. Locked the flow so tight you gotta know. I'mma tumble 'fore they rock my dough. Motherfuckers. [Redman]. Yo yo yo, yo yo yo, fucka.

I mean I ain't Ghandi of this whole rap gear. But you see honey that I'm rappin with there?. All I need is a minute to get her back to the Leer. Back where it is, less traffic there.

Oh I ain't gon' play wit'cha - I ain't gon play wit'cha man!. Ha ha ha.. I need y'all to sing children. Sing, I like it when the children sing. I like it when you sing; I like it when they sing man. That lets you know something's comin. Oh it's comin - aww man something's comin. I like this sound of this - something's comin. You can picture like a photograph, envision the image. Of one-two-fifth street and Lenox. The old folks their souls are cold like tenants. Tryin to keep your weight up better eat that spinach. For four twenty-five niggaz lives get diminished. The world serious, I'm tryin to win a pennant. Cops be on patrol through the block every minute. Itchin just to pop somethin, swearin I'm a menace. They disturb me but it's love like tennis. Man, cap to the side and my jersey is vintage. Chicks'll make a nigga dick hard like a Guinness. Damn it's a scam but I handle my business. Tryin to be the man if the Lord be my witness. Do my {?} with the walk sign for my physical fitness. 16's sicker than all signed flows it's ridiculous. Hold up. [Chorus: children sing]. Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up. Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up. Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up. Hold up, hold up hold up hold up hold up. [Diddy]. Easy now I'm seein 'em, mind where you patrol. Fall back young'un, play your lane like a goal. When his majesty speaks, speech defy gravity. Bluetooth nigga but I don't have any cavities. Diddy got it wrapped like cocoons. Pop shit like needles through {?} balloons. I urge you to tell a friend, warn a brother. About my splurges, merges with Warner Brothers. Thugs actin funny cause chicks call me honey. See a 9 figure nigga makin Bugs Bunny money. Eons beyond bling bling. So I chose to get engaged to these sweet 16's. Make a name, let it bang so beautiful. The theme music for crews that move pharmaceuticals. Or, suitable for, a recuitable whore. To service the whole crew when we out on tour. Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up. [Chorus]. [Diddy]. It's like the music will literally stop time. (Hold up hold up hold up). We roll up, 20 deep, cock D swoll up. Get inflicted by my verbal conviction. A Bad Boy but far from a Detroit Piston. You're not focused enough, you're not listenin. You need to slow down, hold up like kickstand. Hop to it, get on your grind music. Across 110th sharp caesar with a lime music. Fine-tuned with the proper soul seasoning. Your live shows are boring you're just not pleasin 'em. Stop teasin 'em you can't rock Palladium. We bring New York back like that West side stadium. Fuck the game and if the fame went away. Still be the hardest workin man in entertainment today. Learn a lesson and that's, no questionin that. No guesswork involved so stop stressin the facts. Hold up. [Chorus]"

But never been a nigga this fly holdin it down for this long. Nigga I let y'all eat for this long. Now the King's back on the streets crack. I'ma put it on my son's name.

And if you're creepin', please don't let it show. Oh baby, I don't wanna know. Oh baby. I think about it when I hold you. When looking in your eyes, I can't believe. I don't need to know the truth. Baby, keep it to yourself. Repeat *. Did he touch you better than me. Did he watch you fall asleep. Did you show him all those things. That you used to do to me. If you're better off that way.

i got the power,"Verse One: Demon. My click is in it til it's over, never sober. Bustin over, layin Elaine with the cane and the Rover. Pray to Jehovah, for the nigga with the Ruger. The young Don, the Heron mover. You know my hustle, I bring the fo' pound to the tussle. Motherfuck your pit with no muzzle. So chill cuzo, let me blow for my niggaz. Runnin round, get down like motherfuckin gorillas. Shorty bop the wolop, in the spot with the dollop. Pot full of acid, I got the game mastered. Move dimes, hit twenties addicted to gettin money. It could be a hundred degrees and never look sunny. Black I'm tryin to live, somethin got to give. But everyday's the same old, runnin from po-po. Mom think I'm loco, cause I sell crack and puff cocoa. Yo, it's the style see it's still the same. And when worse comes to worse, I steal the cane. Papi know my face, so he don't expect it. Runnin from the gutter so he gots to accept it. Stripped his ass naked, then I put a slug in him. He just another motherfucker, ain't no love in him. I put a bug in him, never sleep on one who never slept. I take my last breath every time I hit the meth. It's the D to the E, M to the O N. Blowin, steady playin shotgun, throwin. Don't you see the shorty with the baseball cap. Don't make me flip motherfucker with this baseball bat. Best to brace yo' gat, 'fore I brace mine, cause I lace nine. From yo' dome to yo' motherfuckin spine. Chorus: Puff Daddy. I be, that nigga that yo' niggaz can't fuck wit. That nigga that yo' bitches wanna creep wit. That nigga that you can't get along wit. Playa hate but you wanna do a song wit. That nigga that you see in the videos. That nigga with the jewels and the jiggy hoes. That nigga that'll die for his main man. That nigga with the gettin money gameplan. Verse Two: Jadakiss. Haven't you heard that Bad Boys move in silence yet?. When you increase the peace, the mo' wild it get. I'm only sizin you niggaz from the waist up. And I ain't, wettin no parts you can't touch with makeup. Mr. Jacob without the Ladder. It don't matter clap your wake up and do a shakeup. nobody badder, since the, baby finksta. I was in the playpen wai-tin for kids to enter. Shit I even blitz the rich to get chips. Housekeeper disguised with the nine bubble grip. Extra clip in the vacumn if I slip. Room service ring the alarm and get the bomb. Blown the hall pearl wide bill long gone. Plus I got the power to ramshack, you dig that?. Worldwide while you simply thought where you lived at. Chorus. Verse Three: Sheek. You don't really wanna get involved, with the L-O-X car. Tellers, Goodfellas, that's who we are. You can't outsell us, it ain't shit you could tell us. Jealous dog, cause we spread like relish. Bad Boys, and we all eat together. When it go down, then we draw heat together. Since I made the connection with the big man. I done got big plans, to be a little nigga in the big Land. Ghetto star, presidential all gift wrapped. And what you call weight, I know cats who sniff that. Enjoy life, what are you sayin?. If the DA ain't got a nigga payin, papi got him weighin. Anything to do with money you can count J in. Next time we bring it to these faggots we ain't playin. Cream of the crop, and we ain't never gonna stop. Hittin you in your head with that butter from The Lox. Chorus (fades)."

Verse Two: Black Rob (starts rapping during the chorus). Yo since the last altercation I been goin to street. Seein honey at the club ery week and I speak. I'ma rock that ass to sleep before I strike. I ain't know the real deal until last night. How, one of them brothers was locked with bankroll. Used to call my crib to see seventy-four. Kick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the dac. babe bro told him, 'You wanna get money, see Black. when you get home', we never had chance to get up. And wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up. He'd explain how his whole crew was slappin honey. Besides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money. Funny how it's a small world, baby girl. Youse about to get, fucked with no jail. I'ma sit back and watch this cake finish bakin. And plan your extermination, word. Chorus. Verse Three: Puff Daddy.

Nah kill it, I'ma flip the script on you. Same thing you did to me, I'ma do it to you. Who knew she was the female Rambo. Fill one of they chest with four soon as he came in the door. Life is out, snuffed all they mans in. In the end, she had to be the Last Bitch Standin. Not for long the buck the forty-four strong. Just like that she was gone, now it's over. Assumin I'll go back to my everyday life. Of a rich millionaire just rockin the mic. Gotta pause, and think about honey no doubt. and admire how the chick went out. Chorus: repeat to fade."

Didnt 'preciate her so I made her cry for me. Every night she had tears in her eyes for me. Quarter K's, shorty took the whole ride for me. First we were friends then became lovers. You was more than my girl, we were like brothers. All night we would play fight under covers. Now you're gone, can't love you like I really wanna. But everytime I think about your pretty smile. And how we're used to drive the whole city wild. Damn I wish you would've had my child. A pretty little girl wit Diddy's smile. This shit is wild. All dem days that I reminisce. About the way I use to kiss dem pretty lips. But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this. I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss. I love you, yeah. [Chorus: Usher].

is this the end?,"Intro/Chorus: Ginuwine. Momma told me one day it was gonna happen. But she never told me when. She told me it would happen when I was much older. Wish it would have happened then (Is this the end?). Chorus. Verse One: Puff Daddy. Sometimes I be wakin up at high noon. sayin, ""Why me Lord?"" -- folks thinkin I'ma die soon. I just tell em keep seekin, but when they sleepin. I be concealed up in my room, knowin that it could happen. I'm just tryin to maintin, because the future is untold. till the static unfolds that the good die young. Please God let a Bad Boy die old. Do you think I wanna lie cold. Or better yet have many shots come close to the head. Shirt soaked til it's red. The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead. Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest. Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh. It all came down to a test. A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest. Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still. I can't ride with program, fearing no man. Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow. hands. But he's still right behind me. All these heartless fools is steady comin after my P. So many phony niggaz lovin to hate Sean. So many cheddar niggaz comin after my cheese. Is it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin?. Or is it all in confusion? Better yet all an illusion. Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin for bruisin. Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away. I don't wanna conceive takin his either. Dipped into the back and took a breather. Heard steps steady in closin with the bullet skeezer. Gotta do somethin, I ain't scared to go. but yet my heart is steady pumpin for somethin. I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin. Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin. Bodies start jumpin, wreckin my brain not to try and understand. but withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man. Or just to try to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand. But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin. There's dreams to fulfill still. Can't complete em with a still kill. Face to face with enemies still grill. Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed. even though I'm not hopin to go. I wish someone would open the do'. Dismantle then the trigger and his fingers steady choked in the snow. Is this the end?. Chorus. Chorus Two: Ginuwine. Just, can't, let, go (Is this the end?). I, just, don't, know. Wish she woulda zapped it then. Verse Two: Puff Daddy, Twista. Did I just hear a tight jam, now it's on let make my maneuver. Hit the alley source man in a Landcruiser. In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger. Heard shots from a steel bruiser. Teflon in the seat took a pale stress. Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest. What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?. Ran straight into a lightpole, just before I got my life stole. A car came to the rescue. I bailed in and said, ""Bless you. But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?"". I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion. I could never watch a soul die, for shoot a man that be too fly. (But who are you?) The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold. Chi. When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole. on. No protection from one time, only caught for my prime. So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?. Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief. and the smell of sweet news when the beef brew. Motherfuckers steady ballin but steady fallin. right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon. So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper. Prepare my mind for the capture. Thinkin Ginuwine like the bachelor. But why these niggaz wanna make us into crime with the rapture?. Ego for dispersin us, don't even hurt the clutch. Cause he's coldblooded and merciless. Steady bustin shots at both of us, was the strap close to us. Then for survival we both to bust. But Renaults get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin closer. Paranoid like a crackfiend when the gat seen. scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder. Don't wanna die til I get older. Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable. so now my sight is gettin dark a lot. Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot. And try to wait until his ma get hot. I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin. You never know when it's your time to leave. Smokin weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car. but wait, I can't find the keys. Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin close. Is it one of them unholy men?. With a strap ready to boldly sin. Mama told me it was comin, but I wish she woulda told me when. Is this the end?. Chorus 2X. (Chorus Two fades out at the end)."
is this the end? (part two),"[Cheri]. This is a story about two riders. One's from Chicago. And the other is from New York. [Twista]. Now nigga what? You thinkin' there be no repentance?. But I'm coming back with a vengence. Runnin' like a ant since it was intense. Thought it was the end. Wish every motherfucker's in like sentence. Where they been since?. Let me not go deep in the story. But damn it, I feel the fury when I'm rapping. Got me going off in the zone. Hit eleven niggas and bitches at home. Hear the drama how it happen. Back for one minute. You remember I was grazed in the shoulder. When I plays the beholder. Hit the land like a crusier. But in the Range with the Rov'. Still it feelin' strange to a soldier. Me and Puff trapped in the parking lot. I done found the keys so let's crawl on the floor. Got up beside the ride but we still trapped. But I found my strap, I gotta bust that hoe. P., you gotta drive, problem at the angle of the ride. Blast when you crash through the exit. We still alive but the opposition gotta die. When they go then it's on to the next shit. When the car screeched off, I blast my heat off. Thus crackin' our winshield. That stud shoulda been killed. Kept shootin' 'till I seen his bloody body do a windmill. Started catchin' convulsions that we frozen. Ain't nobody here to hold it. Feelin the escape was kinda golden. Now we dozin'. More niggas have rolled in. They started comin' at us with high-tech shit. It's only so much one mac can do. But you know what we got to do. Don't get in the wind. Is it the end or chapter 2. They coming after you. 1 - [Cheri]. Living my life on the run. With these niggas coming after me. Is this the way that it has to be. I can't tell these dreams from reality. Now I'm not afraid to die. So it really don't matter to me. It just might be my destiny. I hope you niggas is ready for me. [Puffy]. Yeah, yeah. Saw my whole empire crumble into pieces. As the trouble increases. Escape is the thesis when the car speed releases. I'm on the run like Jesus. The first chapter was sadness but this one is madness. Killers on our asses, plus I'm in 'suit, winney badges. Red and blue light flashing. Now, let's see who's the fastest. Slide through the street like a real C. Hit the curb swervin', but I'm still swift. Damn it, ain't no brakes. I feel like a enemy of the state. We on the run like Will Smith. Pumpin' some real shit. Since the car won't slow down. I had to crash through a window. Level shook but now we on foot with the showdown. Didn't know what we was in for. Somehow, someway we gotta get the ammunition for the gun play. Now I hear some bullets ricochet, motherfucker's got to getaway. T., let's go this a-way through the ally. Where these niggas can't score me. And max me a building attack me. Headin' straight for Kennedy, they can't catch me. There 20 minutes exactly. Get tickets at the first airline, first flight out. Get set for the hardcore, could you tell where the sky phone. Me and T. on the plane on our way to Chicago. When we landed in O'Hare. A cop yelled out ""Freeze, we sent here to capture you"". Nigga, you know what we got to do. Tell me, is this the end or chapter 2. They comin' after you. Repeat 1. [Twista]. People better get goin' for the big clone. Leave our shit blown. Coming at us with a C gun, gotta get calm. Then I pick up on the jet phone. So I could see if my bitch home (hello). Hope the cop that drop them and took a strap then split. Simply, but we acted quick. Damn, there was a glock. Then we dipped up in the parkin' lot. We saw one Jag' at the Jack-O-V. When we got up on the highway, too smooth. Run away to the hood and we workin' with some new rules. Can't be one who loose. Go to the hideout, make a call for some new tools. And I'm feelin' these fools, we got beef who can die. That want a piece of the pie. But now we got his keys to the shop. And niggas gotta live slow 'till at lesat if they try. [Puffy]. Now we can flip my bitch named Angela. She my weed and my wipe and handler. Branding her with a tattoo with my name on it. Make her feel like I'm the man for her. But she lookin' suspicious. And somebody at the front door. Now she looking scared. Soon as I let out the air saying my bitch. Angie up and shot T. in the leg. [Twista]. Should go through the back door. Feelin' torture and pain. I heard shots in the front. Oh we about to die. Straight Kamakozi and ride. There are two things from the start. You wanna go to war, I'll take you to war. I can't make it that easy to ride for me. And when I saw the enemy, I let it ride. Tell me, is this the end or chapter 3?. They comin' after me. Repeat 1 until fade"

I had to go do a show for the ten with the triple zeros. That's why I never flipped with kilos. Flew up to the bay, then back to Georgia. Had to catch a flight to Tallahassee, Florida.

[Nas] Journey Through the life of some real niggas. [Puffy] Some real niggas, You'll never see what I've seen. [Puffy]. When I sleep I dream of bodies in streams of blood. Naked bitches, dead nigga's ghost, Feds with toast. Knockin' my door down sweat poor down my body. Roast from the heat so I soak my sheets. Wake up shiverin', pull my hoe close to me, she sexy. Every night is different pussy since my girl left me. And I tried to make her stay with me, but I stay busy. And her friends are cut-throats, they deep throat to lay with me. I reminisce how I miss a stare in this space. Resort to the lips of a stripper, sprayin' their face. Lampin' in a mansion, home alone. I hear footsteps, shit I kicks just not lyrics. I hold a fifth, wonderin' if ten shots can stop spirits. If nigga's try to rob me then I won't hear it. Cause it's different from the streets, I'm missin' my hood now. Missin' all the blocks cuz I'm surrounded by woods now. It's supposed to be good now. It's like I'm walkin' tight rope and can't look down. Fire below me. Now the fantasies I have for women are unholy. Success, thousand dollar bottles impress. Models with fat ass and big breasts. Floor seats, Knicks vs. Nets, private jets. Millionaire heir to Antigua, with Ananda, the Mtv diva. Nas, how do we survive all this mess? (I didn't survive). East vs. West the rap game where words became flesh. A whole pound of herb won't desolve my stress. Still I ride to the death, love hip-hop. Cause Afrikabababa was def, a lot of respect. Feel Me? Fuck to the rock Sean John jury. I got the same hands of crap platinum and the crap pyramids. Write about the black experience, sell it to Marimax. Tell me if you feelin' that. 1 - [Lil' Kim & Joe Hooker]. Take a journey through the life of these real niggas. The things that they seen it would thrill niggas. If you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder. Through the rain and the pain and the thunder. By the time that you realized that it's goin' down. You may find yourself going underground. When they see that this life is upon us. We would see that there's no one that we can trust. [Beanie Sigel]. You can never see what I see, motherfucker. Beanie Sigel, the realest nigga from the streets was taught. Stay cased up nigga, stay deep in court. Reminiscin' on that cold cell, deep in thought. Gettin' skinny, couldn't eat, cause the meat was poor. Ya'll niggas couldn't live my life, I've been through it. Streached up in hospital beds, fed fluid. Two bullets hit my leg, one passed through it. Saw the blood and the hole in my calf, looked through it. My life's no joke, I don' played dice with soap. Upstate the case niggas slice your throat. Wear your boxers in the shower when you gaurd your soap. I done seen the biggest nigga's in the yard get broke. I done took blocks through war, took blocks for fall. Took blocks to Wall for box of raw. What you think 33 in the glock is for?. Black fatigues, skullies and binoculars,. C4, block your doors, nigga's can't stop this war. I show you faggots what this Swatz' is for. Hidding spots in the door for the glocks is for. Read the papers, '94 I took the cops to war. Half of ya'll niggas livin' a lie. Only reason you switchin' up your droid is cause you keep gettin' robbed. I looked that nigga in the eyes before I send him to God. Beanie Sigel, desert eagle, the realest nigga alive. Repeat 1. [Nas]. Aiyo, Aiyo, Gansta, Gansta. The Bible has words that Christ wrote, evil men sacrifice goats. I speak all my life under oath. Since a kid, troublesome. Thrownin' shit at little girls jump ropes. Bustin' B-B Guns at stray cats, that was way back. Watched it die, covered in flies. Then I picked up a stick, try to dig in it's eyes. Makin' dirt pies, na, being buggy-eyed shit. And every other nigga that rap, sound like my shit. I wear chrome 45's with ice on the grip. I don't shoot it, I roll with killers and criminals. With heroin habits they picked up from the penile. They let you have it, all I do is give them a smile. Lifestlyes of the realest, you ain't ruthless you bitch. I got a pine box just your size, I know it'll fit. Your whole life's a mistake, stop holdin' the pen. Kill yourself, come back as a man over again. Cause in this lifetime I'm reignin', slay men. Leave your whole body cold. Your nails grow long, you get gray skin. May this nigga rest in peace, Amen. I run with brave men, straight out the housin', we wildin'. Names engraved in the pavement. Brick building, grown ladies jump off the roof. Nigga get paged, then murdered at the phonebooth. New York streets made me nigga, it's crazy nigga. Repeat 1"

Can't slay Rob. How many niggaz done tried to play Rob, quit they day job. Tired of putting broke niggaz under the wing. If I go to jail again I'm goin under the bing. Act like you gon' pull that thing thing. You the only one that always get stuck for bling bling. I represent ""A"" block in Sing Sing. Almost caught a buck fifty for fuckin a Latin King's queen. Moves for paper, booze no chaser. Bullets out the blazer four-fifth with the laser. Come and get your shit splitted, newspapers said I did it. (He ain't do it) Now let's get it (Let's get it).

Cuz I get money and run with the richest men. Knockin' at ya door it's Curry again. Been down since the jump off begin. You know who I am. Don't get it all twisted up. Get the cash to my hands be all blistered up. We can pick it up, we can drop it low. Recognize what it is when I come through the door. Not partyin' and pimpin', I walk wit a limp. Once I took it to the top I ain't fell off since. Stay high stay fly stay cool in the fan. Ain't none of y'all seein' ya man. Get a grip niggas. [Chorus]. [Kokane].

Thinking of the day. When you went away. What a life to take. What a bond to break. I'll be missing you. (We miss you, Big....). It's kinda hard wit you not around. Know you in Heaven smilin' down. Watching us while we pray for you. Everyday we pray for you. Till the day we meet again. In my heart is where I keep you friend. Memories give me the strength I need to proceed. Strength I need to believe. My thoughts, Big, I just can't define. Wish I could turn back the hands of time. Us and the six shop for new clothes and kicks. You and me takin' flics. Makin' hits, stages they receive you on. Still can't believe you're gone. Give anything to hear half your breath. I know you still livin' your life after death. CHORUS. Somebody tell me why....

pain,"There's times in my life where I just. I just wanna run away, I just. I just wish the pain would stop. I don't wanna cry no more. I wish the pain would go away. Start a day, bad hands make it hard to deal. Sometimes I wanna pull it, end it all with a bullet. Hard to live life to the fullest with all this bullshit. Mad as fuck, a nigga had enough. From jump street, saw my father murder massacre slain. One shot took half of his brain, I recapture the pain. Twenty-three years, three when it happened. Twenty-six now, still I can't stop the tears. Then my mood switch, thinkin about this sheisty bitch. Kinda funny cause they fake it when they callin you honey. On your dick when they think a nigga, might be rich. That's when I shit, cause I know you fuck with me for my money. Learned the hard way, ain't no correctin the grief. Baby moms starts sexin, my so-called beef. Don't give a fuck if they Marked me For Death like Steven. or relievin your breathin, long as I'm even 'fore I'm leavin. Pain.... I wish this pain, would go. away. We're talkin about the kind of pain that. I wish this pain, would. go away. just gets all up in your heart, and in your soul. I wish this pain, would. go away. The kind of pain that makes you feel like you can't go on no more. I wish this pain, would. go away. The kind of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone. I can't relate to them cats who hold gats at the gate. Is it my fate, am I that nigga, that they love to hate. Solely, slowly, cause I rock a Roley they want my brain gone. Cause of a fuckin chain on?. Migraine's on, now the pain's warm, I stagger. And I'm hopin I don't know the cat with the dagger. Penetratin my heart, rushed thoughts etched in grief. To the City College deceased may you rest in peace. To the families, I never meant to cause no pain. I know the truth, but if you want, then I shoulder the blame. Overcome at times by uncontrollable flames, and multiple pains. Now it seems like I'm goin insane. For the love of you and hip-hop I expand the news. But before my shit drops, I stand accused. Don't you think I wish we all was rich?. One for all it's pain to see your people when they all can't ball. The pain... I wish this pain, would go. away. I wish this pain, would. go away. I don't wanna give no more pain. I wish this pain, would. go away. I don't wanna receive no more pain. I wish this pain, would. go away. God, please take the pain away. I can still hear the shots that left my man Big layin. on my knees cryin and prayin, then I said. ""God why? Got to know how hard we try. Don't let him die, please don't let my nigga be dead"". But it was too late, California sealed his fate. Gone now, hard to move on now, fuck making songs now. Wish I could die, I could fly. If they don't give a fuck, fuck it why should I?. That's when Big spoke, pulled up in a glistening 3. with platinum wings and said, ""Puff listen to me"". He puts his hands on my head and said ""I live through you. Make hits continuous, this is what we do. I know it might be strenous and times is hard. Just keep the faith cause now we rhyme with God. Plus you owe it to yourself and don't forget the kids"". That's when I opened up my eyes and new Bad Boy lives. I wish this pain, would go. away. I wish this pain, would. go away. One day the pain is gonna stop. I wish this pain, would. go away. One day there's gonna be no more pain. I wish this pain, would. go away. [Notorious B.I.G.]. I'm tellin you man. now don't let these motherfuckers fuck your shit up God. I don't give a fuck WHO it is. Don't let em fuck yo' paper man, please Big. Focus your mind man, do your albums, make them hot joints. man fuck these niggaz man. Fuck these niggaz man. And I'ma tell the same thing to you. When you get your shit done, watch your money, and. hopefully, I pray for you, you be the shit. And soon motherfuckers start screamin your name out. like they screamin all these other, so-called hot niggaz. Never take your eyes off that shit yo. Try to get everything you can out of these motherfuckers yo. Ain't no guarantee they gonna love you next year.... I wish this pain, would go. away. I wish this pain, would. go away. One day the pain is gonna stop. I wish this pain, would. go away. One day there's gonna be no more pain. I wish this pain, would. go away. One day the pain is gonna stop. I wish this pain, would. go away. One day there's gonna be no more pain."

So we can chill (until our living's done). [Diddy - over Foxx]. Can I talk to you for a second?. There's some things I've been meanin to tell you. Some things that have been on my mind. Listen to me baby (let's go). [Jamie] Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby). [Diddy] Boo you know what? (What). [Diddy + (girl)]. The day when I first seen you. You know I didn't stand, but I ain't mean to (yes you did). Back then it wasn't oh so fair. You came through like some good clean air. Skin softer than the softest fabrics. You heard about me (I heard about you). How I ball like the Dallas Mavericks. Sayin, anything you want, you can have it (give it to me). That's Harlem World, I get on my grizzly savage see?. From the first day, we laid eyes on each other. at the office I knew we was gon' be lovers (I remember). Mark hotel under the covers. You said I was cool and not like a lot of them brothers. Who used and abused you and took you for granted. See you a Goddess, that's why you was put on this planet (I love you). Since you got me all sentimental. [Chorus w/ Diddy ad libs]. [Diddy] C'mon, don't stop. [Jamie] Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby). [Diddy]. You're so amazin. All I can see is us now in the sun just grazin. Boo your brown complexion, I never seen a. same color as coffee a teaspoon of creamer. 'Member when I had the Beemer? Remember?. Goin through tough times and knowin the other side was greener. We had a dream, we pursued it. 'Member that conversation, all or nothin before we lose it?. You remember - it's all words like music. Came at a time I needed soothin, soul body and mind. At times I felt violent, you kept me in line. Where-ever I went you wasn't far behind. Girl, we got a bond no one can break. And I'm sayin, I pray to God every night we make it - pray to God. I'm hooked and I don't wanna shake you - c'mon. [Chorus - faded into deep background]. [Diddy talks over Chorus]. Yeah I've been doin a lot of thinkin lately baby, yeah. Now I know I done put you through a lot of shit. I know it's hard fuckin with a nigga like me. Yeah, you get a lot of respect for that shit. Ridin with a nigga. You know.. you might as well.. [Diddy]. Now sit back and reflect, on all our accomplishments. The mansions, the plush apartments and. The big boats and the cases of whole klicko. I don't ever wanna let you go. It's a certain kind of feelin, you know that feelin you get. When your girl right and you know what's what, uhh. You got me on some lay low stuff. You stood by me, all through that J-Lo stuff. Brush your shoulders off girl, go 'head and brush 'em. Without you around, I can't function. We gon' be together 'til the day we die. And when they put us in the ground we'll be side by side. I never had a girl make me feel like you. And every day I wake up, I feel brand new. I live for you and I'll die for you too. I love you girl. [Chorus]. [Jamie Foxx]. Girl, maybe we should think about it. Oh we could be down for life. Have a couple kids and make you my wife, baby. You're beautiful lady. My beautiful, so wonderful. I love you so... Oh we could be down for life. Have a couple kids and make you my wife, baby. You're beautiful lady. Baby let's chill. Baby let's chill. Baby that's real forever [fades out]. . Submitted by B√©h"

The manifester apply the pressure. Tie you up and gag you in your mouth with a piece of polyester. Now fix your fuckin' face up. Empty the chest of drawers before I stretch your jaw. Everybody hit the fuckin' floor. Only the real mother fuckers belong. I hope nigga's don't end the party before we finish the song. (Bitch nigga). You be the last to come and harrass, reflect on the past. When I used to pull spine outcho ass. Live nigga's go stack money, continue to bill shit. Long as I'm in this fucker I'm determined to kill shit. Zap nigga's like cellular flips and swell up your lips. Fuck with so much dick in their ass it's shrinkin' her hen house.

Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you. In good and bad times, we'll always make it through. 'Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you. I could straight lace you, not just appearance. Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits. Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it. You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it. Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer. Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to. Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you. 'Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier. (R. Kelly). (Puffy). Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy. Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void. When you spend time with your woman and listen. It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten. I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth. 'Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself. I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt. And prove to you you're more important than anything else. Worthwhile, special like my first child. When I see your face it's always like the first time. Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet. I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet. Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you. Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to. Let it be known, I told you. And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true. (R. Kelly). (R. Kelly Ii). Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby). Waiting for love like this too long. (You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby). All that you need I can give you.

I'm that feeling when you can't leave. Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive. So it's only you and me. When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong. I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong. Keep you away from harm, my love is protected. I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected. I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare In the moment of despair,. I'm the courage when you're scared. Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you. Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you. Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil. Make love all night, bending bed coils. You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal. This is all for you, cause I simply adore you. (R. Kelly). (Puffy). This one right here goes out to all my sisters"

senorita,"[singing by India]. Sabes bien que fue un enga&ntildeo. lo que me hiciste fue un pecado. asi mismo me enga&ntildeaste. translation:. You know well it was a lie. what you did to me was a sin. that's the way you betrayed me..... Verse One: Puff Daddy. Honey I keep you hot and wet, just flooded with ice. And you can spend all day and chill, all night. Come sleep with the king, peep what I bring. Every few weeks it's a bigger size ring. Carats ain't nuttin when the cabbage ain't nuttin. I got habits like goin to Paris I ain't frontin. You can never need for nuttin, only one pipe. Would you like to go to dinner, wit Jordan and his wife?. Am I moving fast? It could happen real soon. Thousand dollar shoes, dance in ballrooms. You know the dress, that got the party impressed. You'll only wear it one time, cause the world is mine. I try to address it, but you never get the message. You the water in my life and I'm trapped in the desert. I never seen a honey sweeter, won't stop. till I get her cause I need her, my senorita. Chorus: Puff Daddy (singing). Mami ven aqui, I wanna be your. papi chulo can't you see? (mi amor). Baby I need you conmigo. Your style is my steelo te necesito aqui. (te necesito yo a ti, te amo). Baby come to me (2X). Verse Two: Puff Daddy. Her name is Carmen, she live down in Spanish Harlem. And I think I have the key to her secret garden. When I seen her, I used to want to beg her pardon. But I was scared, I ain't really have the heart. And when she walked by, I would panic, even though. I was cool with her pops Lou, the mechanic. Went to school with her brother, that's right. I never could build up the words to express how I loved her. Long hair, pretty face, slim waist. The kind that you marry and take to another place. [India sings again]. and exchange vows, spend thous. Make love in a hot tub, where there's a hot towel. She'll be loyal without being spoiled. You can shuck all you want but she's still gonna ignore you. Makes no sense to say mida. Cause bet she won't turn him around, she's my senorita. Chorus. Verse Three: Puff Daddy. I rock regular clothes, as well as Gucci too. And if you don't believe me, ask Groovy Loo. You're beautiful, so I stay true to you. I think you oughta see things like Bermuda boo. No cooperation, got me walkin around pacin. Patient, waitin for my day of penetration. Your relationships is bullshit, your man is a prick. with a little bit of bricks and a whip baby. Please, I got plenty of V's. What you want the pink C-2, or the yellow 3-2-5. That's when I opened my eyes. I was dreamin, damn it was all a surprise. But it felt real, I hopped up in a wet chill. Yet still gotta keep this one concealed. Even though I never got a chance to meet her. I still need her, cause she's my senorita. Chorus. *Puffy talking over the chorus*. *India sings her part from the beginning again*. Chorus. *woman singing, man talking*."

testimonial (intro),"[Diddy]. I need y'all to hear me out there. Can y'all hear me out there? Uhh. Through blocks and boroughs, cops is plottin. Snakes slither while hustlers chop they product. Foreign cars exotic, got hoes hypnotic. While I cruise through the concrete, blowin my chronic. And I move like a diplomat, hoodie and fitted caps. Dwell in the habitat where cons and killers at. Faced a thousand deaths, cowards'll bow to the feet. of the almighty, a God to the black child. I told moms I would be somethin. I gave myself to the world now it's like you owe me somethin. Listen up, I got a story to tell. It's like I fell out of heaven just to walk through hell. It's what, fueled my fire, ignited my desire. You gave me the bricks and the sand to build the empire. Throw the seal on my forehead, my faith still strong. With all I've been through, you would think my faith gone. But nope, I hold my stance in stone. I move mountains with my will and succeed that's how I keep goin. Won't stop been the motto, feelin rich like I won the lotto. It's almost like seein through the eyes of a crack child. Dodgin crisis, three strike system niggaz trapped in a vice grip. You can't defeat me, I defy all odds and sabotages. I survived Reagan, I survived the first Bush. Thinkin back when my moms gave that first push. Thank God for my life I came through the room. Until the evil of part two, when God gave me a sequel. Rags to royal, momma hand her hands in soil. Pops moved drugs in capsules and foils. I foiled your plans and made you aware. And turned America's dream into a nightmare. Yeah, you feel the vibe muh'fuckers. The first B.I., ""Ready to Die"" muh'fuckers. So ""Who Shot Ya,"" 9 to 5 muh'fuckers. ""Bad Boy for Life,"" is I muh'fuckers. And it's back, better than it ever was. I'm talkin like we was gone but we never was. So I deliver the truth uncut. We produce more hits got the booth fucked up. On top of the statue yellin ""Who want what?"". For the past ten years, the future is us. (C'mon man) Eyes closed like I'm blowin reefer. The preview is over, now enjoy the future. Niggaz. I wanna thank y'all for believin in me for so long. Thank y'all for ridin with a nigga. As we continue on!. You are now listenin to the sounds. Of the world famous... you know my name. You know my name"

The potential to be the first black President. iTunes, download me in every resident. Early, I skip break-fast. Nigga be on his grind like he need new brake pads. We in the hood like black soap and dollar vans. My CD's in 3-D, holograms. The future, y'all need to holla man. The live show's a hard act to follow man. Bronze my likeness, y'all need to follow him. From now to 3000, I'll be a problem man. The future. Always before you. {*""The Fu-The Fu-The-Future-ture-ture-ture-ture...""*}. Always ill. With my demeanor, flip, assemble my own team to. Say fuck FEMA in case there's another Katrina. And you, laughed at the past, said I was a dreamer. But it's, back to the future, sold out arenas. We, take 'em to the cleaners, calm ya nerves. This is the man who provided more jobs for blacks than armed services. (Let's go) Cut them corners, stay ahead of them sharp curvages. Yeah, ya heard of us, hits stay superflous. Man, I extend credit to a vagabond. Run yo' city, and we not talkin marathons. Bang like chitty chitty here to disturb you. New CD, watch it spread like bird flu. America, fall back, you can't stop me. Got a thing for pigeon-toed chicks who walk knock-kneed. Skin-tight jeans we call that botoxied. I'm desensitized baby, you can't shock me. I'm the future. Always before you. {*""The Fu-The Fu-The-Future-ture-ture-ture-ture...""*}. Always ill. I went from, blocks to greater to fortunes rock related. Now my entire crib is voice activated. Television on, Mr. Combs is home. Solar panel rooftop my, kitchen is chrome. Dim the lights to a purple haze then answer the phone. (Hello?) Peep the moon through my retractable dome. What they thought they assassinated was only a clone. We about to venture off into the unknown (let's go). Where sunrays hook off layers of ozone. Chips inserted in the brain, the new cell phone. The future, fuck with me now. I'm Grammy certified the committee can pick me now. And they all green with envy like Bill Bixby. Bow down, kiss the tip of my cane, I paid sixty thou'. You know the suit stay crispy now. Hands to the sky and get ready if you wit me now. The future. Never seen before, never will. Always before you, always ill. I AM!!!"
the saga continues,"[P. Diddy]. Yeah can you hear me? Yeah. There's certain things in life that you can stop. and there's certain things in life that can't be stopped. Let's go... ""And now.. for your.. Bad Bad Boys... Starting at guard.."". [P. Diddy]. Y'all niggaz still talkin?. Oh you got a little name little fame little fortune?. What you have is a portion. Bout the size of the hats in the back of my Porsche and. So you better use caution, knowin I'm the boss and. I'm sittin on pyramids, flossin. I don't really gotta talk son. I can get lost and sit back livin off endorsements. I'm a pro, kid. Why you actin like you don't really know, kid?. Any records I broke it. Through the fame and the stardom, makin my mark on Harlem like Poe did. I said, here's your eviction notice. But you probably already know this. I don't mean to be greedy, but turn on your TV. or pick up your CD, P.D.. [G. Dep]. This is gruesome. Niggaz always grab that mic and salt like they really gon' do some'. What's wrong with you son?. Oh you got a new gun, do you know how to use one?. Then you livin an illusion, livin in a used one. while I'm in the Limited, cruisin. You ain't really got a crew son. You givin them amusement, fuck what your Comic Views meant. Youse a smokehead. I've been doin this since this Pro-Ked. Broke breads with the cokeheads. Been down, still I get around like a nigga with broke legs on a moped. I said; I'm a ""Top Gun"" like Gossett. Run and get your CD and cass-ette. Gossip, lotta niggaz got lip. But they ain't got hot yet 'til they got Dep. [Loon]. Why niggaz lie like that? Know they ain't fly like that. Niggaz get fried like that. And you don't wanna die like that. Have your momma cryin like that. Besides all that, I'm in to get it fryin like that. Still on the block and move pies like that. Never my life dealt with guys that rap. In fact, I leave a nigga with his eyes all sad. Swoll up, y'all niggaz better hold up. Any nigga that roll up, could get fold up. Body get ripped up, and then sewed up. Every nigga I fucked with, niggaz is growed up. We don't play games, get on the stand, and say names. All we do is cock back, and spray planes. Give a fuck if nigga hustle or gangbang. Nigga try to use they muscle and fang fang. [Black Rob]. Keep frontin, I'ma put a crease in your jaw. Might catch me squeezin the four. My nigga I go to war. And if a nigga want the raw you still gotta come in the store. Y'all never had a run-in before, with the likes of an outlaw. Predicate assassin, smashin. Open shit, rig scope, focus it. Give niggaz what they 'posed to get (shit). Oppose the clique, I send five close to six. Hoodfellaz, that'll come close your shit. Niggaz stay with the frozen wrists. Now the smoke colored big Benz with the top broke off. Fix your face, we back on the paper chase. Never left, so I ain't gotta take your place. Fuck the fake bogus niggaz that ain't notice. the breadwinner, three-six-five I stay focused nigga. [P. Diddy]. We'll never stop... We'll never stop... One of the greatest teams that ever lived... It's like in our blood... We gotta be born this way... Bad Boy baby."
thought you said (feat. brandy),"(baby ...baby .. baby). [Brandy:]. Take a good look at me. I done cried from the lies. That hurt so bad inside, I can't even think. Ain't never had nuthin to me. Brinh me down to the core. till I hit the paint. Here to show you a compromise of heart. for I'm fallin apart. till there no remains. what had me thinking ya word was your bond. Don't ya know. Didn't have to call it love if you knew that the situation. you wasn't ready 4. I could see if your feelings have changed but damn you slammed the door. only the one thing you said you put down ya whole life for. I can comprehend the deck of cards you dealt me.. [Brandy:]. How can you turn on me. (how can you how can you). How can you purposely. (how can you how can you). [(chorus) Brandy:]. Lessoned learned house can burn were close to heat. Betcha words dont mean nothing to me. Thought you said thought you said that you loved me. Thought you said thought you said that you need me. Thought you said thought you said you complete me. Thought you said thought you said you were never gonna let it go. Thought you said thought you said wen you held me. Thought you said thought you said when'd you tell me. Thought you said thought you said no one else could replace me. Thought you said thought you said that your never gonna let it go. [Diddy:]. The times that you werent there. The times that you left me here. The times that I needed you. You know my love is true. My passions inside for you. The nights that I cried for you. A man has these feelings too. Same shit that chall go thru. I been here before. Sometimes the pain you ignore. Until its right at your door. And then you just cant no more. Why does love feel this way. Why does it hurt so bad. [Diddy:]. Cant even look me in the face. Why does love hurt this way. [Brandy:]. How can you turn on me. (how can you how can you). How can you purposely. (how can you how can you). [(chorus) Brandy:]. Lessoned learned house can burn were close to heart. Betcha words dont mean nothing to me. Thought you said, thought you said that you loved me. Thought you said thought you said that you need me. Thought you said thought you said you complete me. Thought you said thought you said you were never gonna let it go. Thought you said thought you said when you held me. Thought you said thought you said when'd you tell me. Thought you said thought you said no one else could replace me. Thought you said thought you said that you never gonna let it go. [Diddy:]. The heartache and pain. Sometimes it goes to your brain. Sometimes it makes you insane. Sometimes our joy is our pain. Cuz it tears u apart these affairs of the heart. I think im strong but im not. And when I look in ya eyes you know it kills me inside. But I cant wait for that day that you come back to me girl. After we both go away its just to see if its real. Theres no denying the fact its meant to be. If you let it go and then they come back.. If this is our last dance we need to practice our steps,. The situation I left behind but your hearts what I kept,. You said I did you wrong you did me wrong we was both at fault. And of course you lost me with your alibis and all of your talking. And most important I just question my self. [Brandy:]. The pain is taking over I can't believe. (I need your hand). What happened then compared to now is dreams. (I need your hand). And I know now that you'll - me. [Diddy:]. I cant sleep, I cant breathe, I aint eat in days, stomach pains from arguing. Didn't you cheat on me that's how the problems started. And as far as im concerned we learned our lesson. Well its all in the healing and that process has got me stressin. Im so pressured I'm so physically drained. I aint thinkin straight I loved you more than my own self. Although I couldnt bear the pain of seein my old self. Young wild uncontroled self. I love you grl I dont need no one else. [(chorus) Brandy:]. Lessoned learned house can burn were close to heart. Betcha words dont mean nothing to me. Thought you said, thought you said that you loved me. Thought you said, thought you said that you need me. Thought you said, thought you said complete me. Thought you said, thought you said you were never gonna let it go. Thought you said, thought you said when you held me. Thought you said, thought you said when'd you tell me. Thought you said, thought you said no one else could replace me. Thought you said, thought you said that you never gonna let it go. [Diddy:]. When I look in your eyes you know it kills me inside. [Brandy:]. Didn't you, didn't you, didn't you, didn't you, oo ooo. [Brandy:]. Lesson learned. House can burn. We close to heat. Bet your words dont mean nothing to me. [Diddy:]. These affairs of the heart I think I'm strong but im not. [Brandy:]. Thought you said thought you said that you love me. Thought you said thought you said that you need me. [Diddy:]. Come back to me girl. [Brandy:]. How can you how can you.

That is why I sound the way I sound. And the way I walk the way I walk. The way I talk. I tell 'em watch close, nigga jot notes. If you use my approach, you could dock boats. Yeah, you could get exposed to all that. Girl, you know I'm hard to get a hold or contact. Probably overseas with business owners and all that. Flights to Minnesota with dinner over a contract. See, lame niggas gonna do lame shit. How you flexing when your crew ain't shit. Nigga, you ain't shit. Probably trick on something you ain't hit. Try to do me but the shoe ain't fit, and your jewels ain't lit. So tell them niggas I said break bread off. You know, spray lead off, take heads off. Break law pay feds off. You ain't never meet pop. You got the kittens fed up with your fake set up. I keep niggas on rooftops to watch you. I move by smooth, even keep the new spots supplied too. I slide through back of the Maybach. But I do something 5'2 with a fly do, how you?. I don't know you yet but I'm trying to. I leave your mind blew. If you don't mind trying to climb through. New portals on time yeah I think it's time to. Never slip up, one of the homies get picked up. Sell all the whips and switch the cribs up. Get my dick sucked by mermaids. Black shades Herm√®s. The whole last winter I went through a fur phase. Yeah, that summer '32. Effortless. Bad Boy shit. And we won't stop, 'cause we can't stop. B. I. G. , Brooklyn, yeah. (Bad boy, bad boy, whatcha gon' do?). Puff Daddy, New York, yeah. Bad boy, yeah. Unstoppable (You'll see). Big blunts and grass, Maybach on a dash. 40 carat gold Cartier on a class. Mink coats with shooters in of the Land Cruiser. My maneuvers sparking these lil' rumors. Duffle bags, Percocets, the Rugers. Still the smoothest at roughing up all the jewelers. Danny Glover, up the pistol, pussies undercover. Propositions and proposals, bring 'em on the double. Raising the K's in the days and. Jaylen that brain is amazing. Top tier, egotistical when he arrogant. Skyscraper, kilo up in the cabinet. For bad bitches who snort lines the fourth time. C√Æroc white, blue dot, you should pour mine. East Coast fat boy, he be so braggadocios. Air forces, mansions, and I'm on the ocean. Benefits, free my niggas, I'm talking fish and grits. Immigrants came a long way up out the tenements. Gunshots hereditary, get your daddy buried. With my march, got out of prison February. Cold game, m√©nage √† trois and my gold chain. Bad Boy, Buggatis in all four lanes. The script flip when the spliff lit. Double M cruise ship with a thick bitch. Niggas talkin' it but ain't livin' it. Crystal pops I'm sippin' it, mob hats and lizard shit. 'Gator trunks bitch, rollin' blunts with the williest of the willy. Heckler Koch, M-1's and nine millies. Stories like a motherfucker. Model bitches wondering if I'm a fuck with her. She know, I treat my bitches like Ivana. Dolce and Gabana drippin'. Big poppa never slippin'. H-class diamonds shinin'. Dinner with the wifey winin', dinin'. Smoking cigars in Bogota. With Colombian niggas named Panama. Englique and shit. Games we play life endin'. Bitches bending over with ease. For a pair of Moschino jeans. And Donna Karan tank tops I got your bank stopped. Singles on top, Benjamins under the rest of 'em. Advancin' from duplex to mansion. Stashing keys, hidin' G's overseas. VCR's in my V's. Game elevates, money I make. Into stocks and real estates, bitch. Jet skiing in the Caribbean, white sands. Discussing plans with my mans. Dark blue land, smoke tint chrome rims and system. That leaves my rear views tremblin'. What you gonna do when poppa catch an attitude. Drop to your knees and show gratitude. Kiss my rings it's a Frank White thing I stay potent. Bitches devoted, take my dick and deep throat it. You'll see. You'll see"
we gon' make it,"[Intro]. Baby this is your last dance; you know how you do it. There's no nigga like you and there'll never be another nigga like you. Put your foot on these motherfuckers necks. Do it to 'em daddy, do it to 'em. [Diddy]. As my, Daytons spin lowrider sittin low. Hittin corners so hard you can taste my rims. Hard top six-four, I'm Diddy no tint. I can't hide in New York City. I'm 'bout it in the South, sleep good in the West. Know a chick from Watts with Bad Boy tatted on her breast. I done been there and did it (I done been there and did it). Ten years without gettin sweat inside my Yankee fitted. 1990-Raw I showed you ice. You ain't know who Jacob was so I showed you twice. When it was +All About the Benjamins+ I had two bezels on my arm. Like a Don's supposed to, Sean. Ride with a chaffeur in Gucci loafers. And switch to All Stars without losin focus. These rap niggaz hopeless (hopeless) you can change the locks. but I'ma shine for niggaz that ain't know Big. [Chorus: Jack Knight]. Do, seem, like, my, fu-ture's, here, nowwwww. It feels good to see the sun in the mornin. I'm tired of feelin that the people are talkin. I heard a rumor that things ain't changin. But Lord knows that we gon' make it. Oooooooooooooooooooh. [Diddy - over Chorus]. The world famous. As we proceed. To give you what you need. It's been so long. It's been so real. So magnificent, thank you. [Diddy]. Tell me who shot Big (who shot Big). And take the bullets out of 2Pac's ribs (take 'em out). If I could I would reverse the car, reverse the beef. Put it all in a pot and boil it on a D. Dot beat (hit me baby). Sometimes I get drunk, for stress relief. Other times I put ""Life After Death"" on and peep. We ride (we ride) what's a four door Bentley Coupe. without my nigga on the passenger side?. And still I try (I try) to get money stay fly. Finish the race, holdin my crown high (take that). I fly next to God, my eyes on the prize. Been away a long time but now I'm reenergized. (AS WE PROCEED) The life and times of a mastermind (c'mon). Dedicate every breath to claim my designs (it's mine). And the day I die, let a G4 fly. and dump my ashes over N.Y.. [Chorus]. [Diddy - over Chorus]. Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin name. I told you I was gon' be great ma. I TOLD YOU I WAS GON' BE SOMEBODY!. Ohhh!! Feel so good. Feel so free. Put your fists in the air, AOWWWW!!. [Diddy]. I'm the King of all Kings, I abide by no rules. and do what I do by any means (c'mon). Call him necessary, the great visionary. Born extrordinary, a life legendary. Who else put flows out, that put clothes out. Flee the cold weather, short sleeves with my toes out. Nine-six Big showed me what to do. But deep in my heart, this is ""No Way Out II"" (let's rock). I spend absurd money, private bird money. That Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Bloomberg money (you know what it is). Old habits die hard, the Vanguard award winner. New York torch gripper, O.G. of the floss nigga. I'm seein visions like I did a bag of angel dust. This is life when you black rich and dangerous. I'm with God, I'ma live on forever. Bad Boy for life bitch, nobody does it better (nobody). [Chorus]. [Diddy - over Chorus]. Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin name. I'm in the best shape of my life!. Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin name. YEAH! YOU CREATED THIS MONSTER!. IT'S SO INSPIRATIONAL, IT'S SO REAL. BAD BOY BITCH!. [Outro]. So there y'all have it. Words from a wise, great King. We love it when you speak the truth daddy. Don't ever stop, please. Don't ever stop"
what you gonna do?,"It's a Hell Up in Harlem, fuckit, another day. another dollar, wake up, to the barking from the Rottweilers. Pull the collars, make em sit for the Godfather. Then I holler, to Justin my son, run the water. for the shower, trust fund scholarship sure to give him power. Baby momma call, she pick him up, in about an hour. Now free to go, free to blow, with the calicos. and the navajos, it's just the way this player knows. anything goes, finally caught up with my nigga Sam Sam. Picked me up, in the tan Lex Land. Wanted breakfast down at Pan Pan's, what's your favorite dish?. He ordered cheese eggs and grits, I had the swordfish. What is this? Three niggaz dressed in black. Roleys on they wrist, feathers in they hat. One tapped me on my back, then pointed at my stack. Put my finger on the trigger. then I asked him, ""Whatchu want nigga?"". Chorus: Puff Daddy. Whatchu gonna do when it's your turn to go. Whatchu gonna do when you can't take no mo'. You gonna cry like a bitch or take it nice and slow. Whatchu gonna do when it's your turn to go. (repeat 2X). Verse Two: Puff Daddy. I pray to God that I'm dreamin, I know my family. wouldn't take it, when the doctor said, ""He ain't make it"". Mom Dukes cryin, baby mom full of grief. How she gonna tell her son his daddy is deceased?. Now she got beef with them bitches up the street. All because I used to creep, with her girlfriend Sharese. She knows, I keep the hoes, from nation, to nation. On every radio station, Goodfellas in rotation, uhh. That's why niggaz wanna twist my shit, flip my wig. Attempt to murder me like Tommy Gills. Before they draw, niggaz threw me to the floor. Drill holes in my pocket, Sam launch the rocket. They wanna rip my arms out the socket, fuckin heathens. Love to see a nigga stop breathin. I heard a voice sing out, ""Ain't you Sean Puffy Combs?. Here's your eulogy, meet you at the Crossroads"". G'night Bone. Chorus. Verse Three: Puff Daddy. Nothing but clouds and white suits fill my vision. Watching my life go down, like Christian. Listen hear them bullets rang, shotguns and Mac millis. spraying like a hurricane in this war called the terror game. And deuce deuces can't stand the pain. Little guns ain't got no business in this blizzard. they just kibitz, here's five shots to visit, blaka. Blowin bullet holes sizes of door knockers. Three headed for my chest straight, the other two. came a little late, and just barely missed my face. I'm tryin to find a steady place between two cars. One of us gon' either wind up dead, or behind bars. Shit, I'm just tryin to live, so I can raise my kid. and own the world, bone all the girlie girls. That's when I finally figured out. That's that nigga David Arthur, Sharese baby father. And I didn't even bother to ask no further questions. No more confessions only suggestions. I think Sam set me up, cause them bullets squeezed up. from the rear, and Sam was the only nigga there. Then they all peeled out in the rental, aluminum. Sam in the passenger seat, so I'm assumin them. niggaz didn't even get to peep. Lil' Kim and them, in the backseat, with the heat. Clips they feelin em, to the top, shit ain't sweet. Once the light turns red, nuff said, that's dead. They fled, and they waved, hot lead. If I ain't duck, I'd be on my deathbed. Sucker move, for that they don't get no props. Lil' Kim and them, mad they ain't bust no shots. We in the block, no Land posters just old posters. of gangsta niggaz I see ghosts of gangsta figures. I'm tryin to hold my own when they snatched me out the car. Took me in the saloon and said, ""Puffy, there you are"". Them same cats we chased two blocks had new spots. washin dishes, I guess for goin out like bitches. I smacked em, gave a little speech, to mirth. Happiness, cause me and all my peeps got hurt. That night, I said a little prayer, me and Justin. That's when I heard the bustin, yeah. Chorus."
what you want,"[Intro]. Ladies and gentlemen. We are gathered here today. To join. I see it, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I like this right here. Yeah, yeah. One-Two, One-Two, in the place to be. As you can see. I am the crush groovin'. There's a whole lot of stars be groovin' in here tonight. The record breaking and the record making. Yeah, yeah, turn this up. From the states to over seas. Every city in between I hit the scene. Catch fire like kerosene. Geting paid for more then a decade. We been blazing, y'all wasn't ready for the PD invasion. Caught you off guard, got bitches, got cars. Healin' war scars, puff smoke out of the jar. Catch flights to and fro, nigga who you know?. No one important, just another nigga flossing. Gotta seal, what I'm touching is real. You just a clone wit' a production deal. I sailed the seven seas and kept my head above the water. Sorry I left you, but now I am back for ya. But it's like we never bounced, platinum from word of mouth. Hottest niggas out. Alot better, the shit's too strong. I'm home now, daddy's been gone too long. 1 - [Lil' Kim]. What you niggas want. Wanna talk slick. Wanna do shit, try shit, new shit. Who you fucking wit'. You and your weak clique. Bitch you creep wit' got you in some deep shit. You coppin' pleas now, it ain't a secret. Trying to be niggas you can't even speak with. You can't run, you can't hide. Bad Boy 'till the day we die. Tell they all like Jordan in the fall. On top of the hill like Lauren, Killing 'Em Soft'. What you grillin' me for?. Kept my name good, we from the same hood. Made some change, put the range wit' the stained wood. Now chicks, they keep they eyes on me. Wanna grind on me. Haters plotting so I keep my nine on me. You can't stop 'em when them shells is popping. Look good to the public eye, your streets is watching. At all times, put it all on the line. Without a care dreams of cream turn to nightmares. No one to talk to, don't know who to trust. Got your gun out and don't know who to bust. It get like that though, when you stack that dough. Can't run from it yo, that's when they get close. So put up you guards, keep faith in God. I promise y'all the world'll be ours. Repeat 1. Your games amaze, but alot of ways, many choices. Can't sleep, when I do I hear voices. Speakin' loud and clear, wait 'till you come out this year. So I listen back cause the street is missing that. What a world we live in. So cold I'm shivering, slipping. Gotta work with what I'm given, shit. Bitches is trifling, hands out grabbin'. Niggas hating, scheming and back stabbin'. That's why they hang around you, just to be seen. Type to leave a gun fight wit' a full magazine. No blood, not hit, chamber ain't warm. What part of the game is this? And who's side you on?. Can't be out for wealth and out for self, won't work. Find yourself tucked and surrounded by dirt. In a verse I show the whole earth my work. It got to get better because it can't get no worse. Repeat 1. Repeat 1."

Nah, then you're song. then you're song wasn't working. Ran into this young jawn, I told her come home. She asked for a check I said, could you (working. Now every time she call I don't even pick up. I just hit her with the text like. (Chorus). Don't bother me, I'm working. Don't bother me, I'm working. Yeah put your hands together. Don't bother me, I'm working. Don't bother me, I'm working. Yeah, I ain't finished, I ain't finished. Don't, working. (Verse 2). I do this s**t for B. I. G. So if you don't like me. f**k you in the building, you working. If you see us in the club with C√Æroc by the tub. We ain't had fun, we working. In the Dj booth like an independent group like. Look, this a record we working. Play this s**t a hundred times. If you don't we gon be. in here every single night that you working. Shout out to my people with a job. I hope you don't fall asleep tomorrow when you working. I was macking on this chick. my partner tapped me on the back. I turned around like can't you see me, working. She a waitress or a stripper. I it's past midnight and she tell you she's working. And we hustle before we can play. So even on Memorial Day, my ni**a. (Repeat Chorus). (Outro). If you gon get this money. you gon have to get out and get it man. Ain't nobody gon give it s**t, feel me?. God sent me here to inspire you, you understand?. Ay I ain't about that motherf**king talk. I'm about that walk baby. I gets busy, we get this money over here"
"young g's (feat. jay-z, the notorious b.i.g.)","Intro: Biggie. Uhh, check it out, uhh. *singing* I steps in where the Mo's and the hoes at bay-bee!. Fuck all that pretty shit. Takin it back to the gutter for you motherfuckers. Niggaz know the deal. Niggaz know who the Don is. Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one. Peep game, uhh, what, what. Verse One: Puff Daddy. Out of this world like Mars, when I spit these bars. Come fuck with these stars up in luxury cars. We built them radars to stay free from the cops. Crucial choices to make, like A-C or the drop. Are we gonna stop? Shit man never my squad go broke. Your squad arti-choke. Watch your circle vanish like cigar smoke. Ain't no joke, when your ones don't show. Nigga I know, might say 'Been There Done That' like Dre. Through hard work I earn the vault. Promise God to never look back or I turn to salt. Got nice watches nice cars nice bitches and rings. Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things. Can't relate to motherfuckers, who ain't go no cake. When you all fucked up, and can't get no break. When your fake ass friends, don't help you out when you need it. Be on some real bullshit, politely tell you to beat it. Fuck that, get your own nigga, don't ask me for shit. That's what I did, now they all askin for hits. Nigga it's on for the simple fact I let it be known. We still fly but seperately cause now I, charter my own. Propellers, Goodfellas, leave all them playa haters jealous. Billboard charts should tell us, they can't touch us. Why niggaz bring the ruckus?. Because release day is bigger than Mandela's, motherfuckers. Chorus:. Just some ghetto boys. Living in these ghetto streets. -- these ghetto streets. And everyday they gotta. fight to stay alive. It's just reality. Verse Two: Jay-Z. Yeah, make you a deal, check. These here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't shed. I try to bring you life but motherfuckers want dead. So I travel with the babble, with the chrome, with the lead. Cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flowin through your head. I been rich I been poor I saved and blown bread. Some say I been here before because of the way I zone. Some said, Jigga zone is like the fallin of Rome. Reoccuring, that he thinks like that cause he's observing. Won't be known until I'm gone and niggaz study my bones. Mentally been many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own. In the physical, onee seems, like a lost body. In fact my thoughts don't differ much from that of God body. But it's the odd shottie, that got cats, likening me. to the mob John Gotti, rap dudes bitin me cause. I got it locked like the late Bob Marley. Pardon me y'all, the great Bob Marley. Solemnly we mourn, all the rappers that's gone. Niggaz that got killed in the field and all the babies born. Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order. So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters. You walk em through it, you know, talk em through it. Know these beads is more than music whenever I talk to it. Destined for greatness and y'all knew this, when I doubled the pie. Had a shorty and a girdle comin out of B-W-I (in school). I hated algebra but I loved to multiply. And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi before I die. It's gonna happen whether rappin or clappin have it your way. Cause if that's my dough you're trappin, I'm clappin your way. Chorus. Verse Three: Notorious B.I.G.. Damn it feel good to see people up on it. Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it. My brain is haunted, with mean dreams. Gs's with Bb's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer. than Richie, quickly, niggaz wanna hit me. If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it. My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat. High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit. in my circumfrence, mad bitches, with mad lucci. Bulletproof vestes under they coochie. Spittin my uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggaz represent. Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin bent. And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies. I be smokin trees in Belize when they find me. While you still killin niggaz with punany, like heiny. and Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw you on the floor with the virus. While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke. Got lawyers watchin lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it. Them country niggaz call me Frank White. I'm squirtin off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight. Sunrise open my eyes no surprise. Got my shorty flyin in with keys taped to her thighs. With all the utensils, who hang my china thing. She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rental. The situation ain't accidental... What? From a, from a young G's perspective.. (repeat 2x). Chorus 2x to fade"
