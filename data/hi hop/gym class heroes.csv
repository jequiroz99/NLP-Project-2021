stereo hearts (feat. adam levine),"My heart's a stereo. It beats for you, so listen close. Hear my thoughts in every note oh oh. Make me your radio. Turn me up when you feel low. This melody was meant for you. To sing along to my stereo. If I was just another dusty record on the shelf. Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?. And if I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?. Like with your hands ""look Travie, I can handle that"". Furthermore I apologize for any skipping tracks. It's just this last girl that played me left a couple of cracks. I used to, used to, used to now I'm over that. Cos holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts. If I could only find a note to make you understand. I'd sing it softly in your ears and grab you by the hand. Keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune. And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you. My heart's a stereo. It beats for you, so listen close. Hear my thoughts in every note oh oh. Make me your radio. Turn me up when you feel low. This melody was meant for you. To sing along to my stereo. To my stereo. So sing along to my stereo. If I was an old school 50 pound boombox. Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walked?. Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops. And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop?. And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me. When you have to purchase mad D batteries. I appreciate every mixtape your friends make. You never know, we come and go like on the interstate. I think I finally found a note to make you understand. If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand. Keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune. You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you. My heart's a stereo. It beats for you, so listen close. Hear my thoughts in every note oh oh. Make me your radio. Turn me up when you feel low. This melody was meant for you. To sing along to my stereo. Sing to my stereo. So sing along to my stereo. I only pray you never leave me behind (never leave me). Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find). I'd take your hand and hold it closer to mine. Thought love was dead. But now you're changing my mind (come on). My heart's a stereo. It beats for you, so listen close. Hear my thoughts in every note oh oh. Make me your radio. Turn me up when you feel low. This melody was meant for you. To sing along to my stereo. To my stereo. So sing along to my stereo"
cupid's chokehold (feat. patrick stump),"Ba ba da da. Ba ba da da. Ba ba da da. Ba ba da da. Ba ba da da. Take a look at my girlfriend. She's the only one I got (ba ba da da). Not much of a girlfriend. I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da). It's been some time since we last spoke. This is gonna sound like a bad joke. But momma I fell in love again. It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend. And I know it sounds so old. But cupid got me in a chokehold. And I'm afraid I might give in. Towels on the mat my white flag is wavin'. I mean she even cooks me pancakes. And alka seltzer when my tummy aches. If that ain't love then I don't know what love is. We even got a secret handshake. And she loves the music that my band makes. I know I'm young but if I had to choose her or the sun. I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun. (ba ba da da, ba ba da da). Take a look at my girlfriend. She's the only one I got (ba ba da da). Not much of a girlfriend. I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da). Take a look at my girlfriend. She's the only one I got (ba ba da da). Not much of a girlfriend. I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da). It's been awhile since we talked last and I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast. But dad I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one. Type of girl that will make you way proud of your son. And I know you heard the last song about the girls that didn't last long. But I promise this is on a whole new plane. I can tell by the way she says my name (ba ba da da). I love the way she calls my phone. She even got her very own ringtone. If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (ba ba da da). It's gonna be a long drive home but I know as soon as I arrive home. And I open the door take off my coat and throw my bag on the floor. She'll be back into my arms once more for sure. Take a look at my girlfriend. She's the only one I got (ba ba da da). Not much of a girlfriend. I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da). She's got a smile that would make the most senile. Annoying old man bite his tongue. I'm not done. She's got eyes comparable to sunrise. And it doesn't stop there. Man I swear. She's got porcelain skin of course she's a ten. And now she's even got her own song. But movin' on. She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard. And we can be on the phone for three hours. Not sayin' one word. And I would still cherish every moment. And when I start to build my future she's the main component. Call it dumb call it luck call it love or whatever you call it but. Everywhere I go,I keep her picture in my wallet like you. Take a look at my girlfriend. She's the only one I got (ba ba da da). Not much of a girlfriend. I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da). Take a look at my girlfriend. She's the only one I got (ba ba da da). Not much of a girlfriend. I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)"
the fighter (feat. ryan tedder),"Just waking up in the morning with the beat well. Quite honest with ya I ain't really sleep well. Ya ever feel like your train a thoughts been derailed?.

Six foot five, two hundred and twenty pounds. Hailing from rock bottom, loserville, nothing town. Text book version of the kid going nowhere fast. And now I'm yelling kiss my ass. It's gonna take a couple right hooks a few left jabs. For you to recognize that you really ain't got it bad. Until the referee rings the bell. Until both your eyes start to swell.

ass back home (feat. neon hitch),"[Neon Hitch]. I don't know where you're going. Or when you're coming home. I left the keys under the mat to our front door. For one more chance to hold you close. I don't know where you're going. Just get your ass back home. [Travie McCoy]. We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions. So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing. And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact. When you call and I don't know what city I'm in at. Or what day of the week in the middle of the month. In a year I don't recall. It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke. I told you I wouldn't be long. That was last November, now December's almost gone. I'd apologize but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong. [Neon Hitch]. I don't know where you're going. Or when you're coming home. I left the keys under the mat to our front door. For one more chance to hold you close. I don't know where you're going. Just get your ass back home. [Travie McCoy]. And you've been nothing but amazing. And I never take that for granted. Half of these birds would have flew the coop. But you, you truly understand it. And the fact you stood beside me. Every time you heard some bogusness. You deserve a standing o 'cause they'd a just been over it. Let em talk, let em talk, let em talk, let em talk. Like we don't hear what they saying. Let em walk, let em walk, let em walk, let em walk. We'll just drive by and keep waving. Cause you and I above all that. Just let them wallow in it. Now they all choked up, yuck. Cause they be swallowing it. [Neon Hitch]. I don't know where you're going. Or when you're coming home. I left the keys under the mat to our front door. For one more chance to hold you close. I don't know where you're going. Just get your ass back home. [Travie McCoy]. No one hold me down like you do sweetheart. You keep doing that, I keep doing this. We'll be alright in the end. Trust that. We put the us in trust, baby. Let's go. [Neon Hitch]. I don't care what you're after. As long as I'm the one, no. I don't care why you're leaving. You'll miss me when you're gone. I don't know where you're going. Or when you're coming home. I left the keys under the mat to our front door. For one more chance to hold you close. I don't know where you're going.

7th period: 7 weeks,"My life's these yellow lines, concrete, and parliment butts. Exhaust fumes and rest stops who drive hard for their bucks. Load in, sound check, play show, load out, let's go, next city, oh great, off day. Hangovers, hangups, dialbacks, running make up, apologies and promises. And nobody acknowledges that boys in bands got it so damn bad. But we love like the last cigarette we'll ever have. I'm putting miles on my body, bout due for a tune up in this gas station, food ain't really helping but. I'm loving every minute, every road signs a reminder of exactly why we did it to begin with. This is how it has to be. A kiss for luck, submerge myself. And in 7 weeks resurface. Even if we don't look back again. Tired boys and wired eyes. Exposing imperfections. To the public eye we're perfect. Even if we don't look back again. I like these hotels, passports, random bag checks, day dreams of love affairs that I haven't had yet. Touch down, baggage claim, new town, different dame, same clothes, 7 days, whew, damn I need to change. And it's a lifestyle that I wouldn't recommend. Wild N Out on a level Nic Cannon couldn't comprehend (fuck outta here). We made a lot of friends and even more enemies. Some of which were genuine and others just pretend to be. Soft raving baby, life's lovely. Even when the gray rain cloud's right above me. The girl's textin' me talkin' about gettin' all cuddly. Cause you paint a pretty picture but the frame is so ugly. This is how it has to be. A kiss for luck, submerge myself. And in 7 weeks resurface. Even if we don't look back again. Tired boys and wired eyes. Exposing imperfections. To the public eye we're perfect. Even if we don't look back again. And now it's back in a van with four of my mans. Until we catchin' a tan on the Florida sands. I feel like tourin' this land's made me more of a man. From killa California to the shores of Japan. Good times stayin' up late in Austin. Coast to coast V8 to Chicago. To gettin' up with Johnny Cupcakes in Boston. And smokin' that most great eight in Colorado. Home ain't home no more. I hug the road and kiss the concrete and sometimes I even hear her heartbeat. No matter where we go or where we at. We carry upstate on our back, it's like that. This is how it has to be. A kiss for luck, submerge myself. And in 7 weeks resurface. Even if we don't look back again. Tired boys and wired eyes. Exposing imperfections. To the public eye we're perfect. Even if we don't look back again. This is how it has to be. A kiss for luck, submerge myself. And in 7 weeks resurface. Even if we don't look back again. Tired boys and wired eyes. Exposing imperfections. To the public eye we're perfect. Even if we don't look back again. ""So a lot of you don't realize. There's a whole subculture of boys driving around in vans."". Even if we don't look back again. ""Looking for your daughters, and your lottery tickets. Love it or leave it. I'm like this"". Even if we don't look back again. ""I love my life. Bitches."". Even if we don't look back again. Even if we don't look back again"
nothing boy vs the echo factor,"Now I could sit here and baffle you. With shallow babble. And a bunch of punch lines. You probably won't get. Or even use some big words. That you'd have to look up.

I could waste 32 bars telling you how to live. Knowing damn well I used mtv cribs for the blueprint. I could bore you to death with my past relationships. Or a little ditty bout Jack and Dianne. Or I could go back to childhood. Dig up them skeletons. And spit them at you with a catchy hook. Look, I could strike a nerve with some four letter words. That'll make Richard Pryor proud. Or better yet, I could sing a jingle that'll contort and mingle. Every single solitary letter in the alphabet. (I could tell you whatever you want to hear.

But that probably wouldn't interest you. But why should it. I mean, I've seen a lot of shit in 22 years. But your feet in my shoes isn't something I recall. And I've been known to drink 22 beers. Before a show cuz. otherwise I probably wouldn't have the balls. I could make references to books I never read. For the sake of sounding conscious. But, that's just obnoxious. I could take off these bandages and. Expose these papercuts. And put them in the air. with both my middle fingers up. or talk about myself in third person. like I'm better than you. cuz there's nothing else better to do. I could attack your character from. Eighty different angles. Cleverly explaining exactly how wack you are. But why do that when it's a well known fact. you buying this cd is potentially feeding me. (come on).

I say goodbye too many times these 22 long ones. Here I am wavin' again. ""so long, friend"". I shoulda told her how this town doesn't like. when people leave. So it finds ways to keep 'em. It sews seeds and reaps 'em. And now she's part of that harvest. But different from all the others. Ask her mother how her smile touched souls. And warms cold hearts. Monique, I miss you. I wish I coulda kissed you farewell. And given you that tattoo you always asked for. But when I'm done tappin' bud lite on god's stomach. You got next. I'm done. Y'all take what you want from me.

We left before a minute now we all up in it. Baby boy if you got the big dreams go and get it. Never been the type in tight jeans i won't fit in. When I see them scene girls that they all gonna get in. And I'm living clean now while you all walk in it. No it's me but I don't give a damn if you all don't get it. So fresh and so clean in my Eugene fitted. While I'm laughing at the baby, y'all crying at the clinic. I read a couple blogs and they had my ass livid. But now I got my own, the world gotta live with it. Never played basketball, but I could show you how to pivot. Making moves in that black hatchback Honda Civic. Like I did in highschool, wish that I could relive it. But I can't so let's go on and get the hook and revisit.. (CHORUS). ooo hey, well i'll be damned. I've been around the world and back again. From Japan and Amsterdam,. with a ticket in my hand, singing. catch me if you can, catch. catch me if you can. ooo yeah, well i'll be damned. I've been around the world and back again. From Japan and Amsterdam,. with a ticket in my hand, singing. catch me if you can, catch. catch me if you can. (BRIDGE). Maybe I'm wrong,. But after 26 years I feel I've payed my dues. So when you play this song,. Just know that I live my life the way i choose,. And now I stand here proudly in L.A.. At a sold out crowd. And when no one's around. I refuse, to be as inferior to you. (CHORUS). ooo hey, well i'll be damned. I've been around the world and back again. From Japan and Amsterdam,. with a ticket in my hand, singing. catch me if you can, catch. catch me if you can. ooo yeah, well i'll be damned. I've been around the world and back again. From Japan and Amsterdam,. with a ticket in my hand, singing. catch me if you can, catch. catch me if you can. (repeat). ooo hey, well i'll be damned. I've been around the world and back again. From Japan and Amsterdam,. with a ticket in my hand, singing. catch me if you can, catch. catch me if you can. ooo yeah, well i'll be damned. I've been around the world and back again. From Japan and Amsterdam,. with a ticket in my hand, singing. catch me if you can, catch. catch me if you can. ooooo hey. ha ha ha. yeahhh. ha ha ha"
10th period: biter's block,"GYM CLASS HEROES. ""Biter's Block"". This is not novelty. This is nothing delicate. This is the result of some people’s search for something relevant. Stake claim immediately. Cause hot products cool down. At which point will flock the new sounds. Take fame intravenously. But when nature turns to habit. I’ll be sure to leave the scene and start stacking it. This is nothing fraudulent. This is that sure shot itchy finger lingering behind your target audience. You got em all convinced. But we ain’t buying it buddy. Demand for lies is high. And you’re supplying it. Truth is brutal and consumes you if you let it. Type that in your little away message and set it. [Chorus]. Keep singing songs for me. That I can write in my sleep like I’m counting sheep. Keep singing songs for me. Man you warning me what you ought to be. Keep singing songs for me. Just following the leader with your blah blah blah. Keep singing songs for me. That I can write in my sleep like I’m counting sheep. And this is not a fashion statement. It’s elegant intuition. Far beyond your bed wetter kindergarten compositions. This is a part of me. How can you sleep at night. When what you don’t bite you write half-heartedly. Go join the army. And be the best you can be. Give new meaning to blowing up overseas. Please. We kick them doors down when nobody would let us in. And give you that proverbial taste of your own medicine. We took your formula and relabeled it. And sat patiently and giggled it when you drank it. It’s new poison street cred when just about the same reflesh. Pop bottles and dropped names. And you’ll dismiss it cause it isn’t what you’re used to. But who the fuck died and made you king koopa. [Chorus]. Wow congratulations on your new purchase. I heard you bought a crib on biters block downtown plagiarism’s paradise. You’re not a movement. You’re purely amusement. The poster boy for Xerox and the role model for parasites. You serve no purpose. You’re purely decorative. And bore use to death with your auditory sedatives. Oh they don’t see. No, we don’t sleep. And hog tie your runaway bride with cold feet. We built this city on lock and load logic. And burned it down the same night. So go ahead and put your tears on ice baby. I think we got a winner. And kiss your crucifix your boy’s a certified sinner. [Chorus]"
12th period: scandalous scholastics,"(Did you hear about Travis?). (No, What?). (I heard he’s been hooking up with a teacher!). (NICE!). And I can hear ‘em talking in the hallways. I’m always late for lunch,. Learning dirty little lessons from you. Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school. Now I’m a legend in the locker room (Legendary Baby!). (Ah) I was just a snotty nosed degenerate. With hit pass perfection. Dodgin’ teachers down to give my late ass detention. Hardly a heartthrob but I made due. Using those same “circle yes or no”. Notes I used in grade school. Folded love letters with a tab that read “pull here”. Writin’ back and forth in notebooks for a full year. I used to daydream about Ms. Magnus. The type of fantasies you feel guilty for having. But who hasn’t?. The only difference beside the age. Was the fact I acted on it. And who wouldn’t?. A schoolboy crush met mature woman lust. And they hit it off so well. And I could tell the day she asked me. To stay after class that it was all bad. But I just bit my lip and acted all mad. The bell rang, class dismissed. She door shut and her skirt went up (That’s a Fact!). And I can hear ‘em talking in the hallways (let ‘em keep talking). I’m always late for lunch,. Learning dirty little lessons from you (so sexy). Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school. Now I’m a legend in the locker room (Legendary Baby!). We gave a brand new meaning. To “after-school special”. The second that our lips touched. She kissed my ribs. And counted each one out loud. I tried my hardest not to giggle. But I couldn’t cuz it tickled so much. She pulled my pants to half-mast. I said “hurry Miss Sin. You gonna make me late for math class”. The way she praised my balls was vicious. Now that’s what I like to call sacrilegious. One time became twenty times. Before we knew it. We stopped caring about where we would do it. From the classroom to the bathroom. And when all the students was gone. We’d even do it in the staff room. From F’s to A’s in less than 3 days. Now the underachiever’s the one with the best grades. Made the third floor shake without breakin’ a sweat. Goddamn it felt good to be the teacher’s pet. And I can hear ‘em talking in the hallways (let ‘em keep talking). I’m always late for lunch,. Learning dirty little lessons from you (so sexy). Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school. Now I’m a legend in the locker room (Legendary Baby!). (Ah) Goodness gracious, accusations. Started flyin' through the building. Cruel As School Children. This isn’t how it was supposed to be. Reminiscing don’t stand so close to me. And if it’s mostly my fault for letting this shit happen. But I couldn’t resist a little adolescent bragging. I mean, after all I was only 15. And she was showing me things. My virgin eyes had never seen. Never forget the little meeting she called. But when she saw my reaction. It made her appalled. So basically what you’re sayin' is. If I don’t keep tappin’ that ass. Then you ain’t gonna let me pass. Psshh, Some punishment lady. And as I turned towards the door. I looked back. She had her clothes on the floor. Needless to say I passed with flying colors. But my teacher was my best friends mother (damn). And I can hear ‘em talking in the hallways (let ‘em keep talking). I’m always late for lunch,. Learning dirty little lessons from you (so sexy). Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school. Now I’m a legend in the locker room (Legendary Baby!). And I can hear ‘em talking in the hallways (let ‘em keep talking). I’m always late for lunch,. Learning dirty little lessons from you (so sexy). Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school. Now I’m a legend in the locker room (Legendary Baby!). And I can hear ‘em talking in the hallways (let ‘em keep talking). I’m always late for lunch,. Learning dirty little lessons from you (so sexy). Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school. Now I’m a legend in the locker room (Legendary Baby!). Ahhh!"
13th period: on my own time (write on!),"I wish I could unzip my skin and take it off. Just to take a walk but I can't do it. I don't think I'll make it on my own (on my own). As when I take out my pen. and I wage it all, turn the page and fall. It just comes natural. I'm gonna make it on my own (on my own). [chorus]. I just need time to walk it off,. but I can't do it. I'll write it on my own time. Hey look I made it on my own (on my own). I know she thinks that I don't try, but I realize that I can. do better. Write, write on [4x]. Makin' a mess as I progress. No time to cry about it, do better. Write, write on [2x]. [verse 2]. I wrote the greatest lines at the strangest times. Now it's payin' off, but I still feel lost. Cuz I can't do it. I don't think I'll make it on my own (on my own). So in between now it pacifies. I change my name to free, but she feels safe to me. So I'm livin' dangerously. I'm gonna make it on my own (on my own). [chorus]. I just need time to walk it off,. but I can't do it. I'll write it on my own time. Hey look I made it on my own (on my own). I know she thinks.... But I realize that I can do better. Write, write on [4x]. Makin' a mess as I progress. No time to cry about it, do better. Write, write on [4x]. Write on, write it on your own time (write, write on). Write on, write it on your own time (write, write on)..."
1st period: the queen and i,"I love that how she breathes booze in the mornin'. Man, it's so sexy how she can't remember last night. I made a fatal mistake letting her drink again. Well who the hell am I to tell her how to live her life?. And if you could put dumb in a shotglass. I'm just another lush who's had one too many in me. And we please don't have enough. I see you stand there, settle for anything, anything's better than lettin' her,. 'Cause she could do better than me. She'll come around eventually. 'Cause baby girl's a queen. And a queen is just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves. And she's made me a fiend. I won't be withdrawed 'cause I got nothing to lose. Oh no, man. She's at the bottom of that bottle. She's only one more swallow. From being, you know, so hollow. (Hey! Hey! Hey!). Bravo, she's at the bottom of that bottle. She's only one more swallow. From being, you know, so hollow. I find it funny she can never find her car keys. Immediately after telling me she can't take it. She makes the cutest faces when she screams obscenities. And slurs her words because she's never not inebrieated. And the front page that I'd read. Let the girl go, you know you can do better. It's bad, when the fact that you can't have her. Is the reason you sweat her,. Don't let her take advantage of you. Like the other girls let her. You better cut your losses now buddy.. 'Cause baby girl's a queen. And a queen's a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves. And she's made me a fiend. I won't be withdrawed 'cause I got nothing to lose. Oh no,. She's at the bottom of that bottle. She's only one more swallow. From being, you know, so hollow. (Hey! Hey! Hey!). Bravo, she's at the bottom of that bottle. She's only one more swallow. From being, you know, so hollow. Drown yourself,. It's not worth keeping me. Just put it down right now,. When bow out gracefully. ('Cause baby girl's a queen. The queen's the part with a bunch of fancy moves. And she's made me a fiend. I won't be withdrawed 'cause I got nothing to lose). Oh no,. She's at the bottom of that bottle. She's only one more swallow. From being, you know, so hollow. (Hey! Hey! Hey!). Bravo, she's at the bottom of that bottle. She's only one more swallow. From being, you know, so hollow. (Hey! Hey! Hey!...)"
2nd period: shoot down the stars,"'81 was the year shit hit the fan in a major way. I sat there for an inspiring artist. Almost 20 years after the fact I'm still on my hustle. Diggin' graves for an inspiring artist. Pushing daises up. And never compromise the arts and make a crowd clap. Shit on since the first show. But we turned feces to fertilizer. So when you diss it's just food for the flowers to grow. Sold 15 plus out of backpacks, no trunks. Too young to drive. But live hip hop. And the kids are upstate kids that thought rap was past tense, hence the last name. Got name for playing basements and such and making songs that our friends loved. And when the fish bowl got too small to hold the goldfish. We filled our gills with water and ripped that mother fucker like. So take a step back. And a breath in. Let it out now. Put your chin up. You can do it tiger. You a man now. And in your dream it's time to do the best you can now. So break ourselves down. And build ourselves up in disappointment. How fragile we are. So fragile we are, we just don't show it. Shake up this town. And shoot down the stars for our enjoyment. So sexy we are. So sexy we are, we just don't know it. This is what you wanted right?. How many nights were spent pouring out your guts dummy?. How many punishments endured for fucking up in school?. How many teachers proved wrong by writing songs instead?. My point exactly. But you knew you had a spark, did you?. Something producin' to the dreams your pop's dreams lent you. Stay focused when nothing seemed to make sense. Stealing verses with that cash's clay confidence. Sometimes you stubborn as shit, that's the McCoy in you. You learn to be a man without losing the boy in you. Just do your thing man. So take a step back. And a breath in. Let it out now. Put your chin up. You can do it tiger. You a man now. And in your dream it's time to do the best you can now. So take a step back. And a breath in. Let it out now. Put your chin up. You can do it tiger. You a man now. And in your dream it's time to do the best you can now. So break ourselves down. And build ourselves up in disappointment. How fragile we are. So fragile we are, we just don't show it. Shake up this town. And shoot down the stars for our enjoyment. So sexy we are. So sexy we are, we just don't know it. We break ourselves down. And build ourselves up in disappointment. How fragile we are. So fragile we are, we just don't show it. We shake up this town. And shoot down the stars for our enjoyment. So sexy we are. So sexy we are, we just don't know it. So take a step back. And a breath in. Let it out now. Put your chin up. You can do it tiger. You a man now. And in your dream it's time to do the best you can now. So break ourselves down. And build ourselves up in disappointment. How fragile we are. So fragile we are, we just don't show it. Shake up this town. And shoot down the stars for our enjoyment. So sexy we are. So sexy we are, we just don't know it"
3rd period: new friend request,"I remember when I first laid eyes on you. My man Tom introduced us but I was too shy to say, 'Hi'. When I finally built up enough nerve to drop a line. You made it clear you wasn't just another MySpace mistress. I didn't take it personal. When you ignored my request to be your friend. I spilled my guts and hit send. Waited two weeks for a response and got nothing. Honestly, it only made me want you more. Week four rolled around and I was this close to letting go. But something wouldn't let me even though I hardly knew you. It was plain to see we were meant to lock lips. You knock me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips. I was on this website late night lurking. When I got a message from you that was labeled, 'Urgent!'. You said that you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game. They're all the same trying to get your instant messaging name. But the fact that you hit me back made me smile. You must of saw something you liked. When you were skimming through my profile. You caught me at the most pivotal moment. So now I'm e-mailing my love with a dozen digital roses. Just click approve. It's so simple. Show me some kind of sign. And let me know it's time to make my move. Click approve. Come on girl. Baby I'm one of a kind. And I ain't got time to lose. Click approve. You're killing me here. Show me some kind of sign. And let me know it's time to make my move. Click approve. Come on girl. Baby I'm one of a kind. And I ain't got time to lose. Let's face it, it's a sad situation. When we have to resort to keyboards as a means to making relations. But I don't have the patience, I get straight to the point. So this is me at my most honest. No ego, no gym class status, just Travis. Love it or leave it, but you gotta admit. On a scale of one to awesome, I'm the shit. Just get over it and add me god damn it. I've been waiting too long. I even wrote a song about it. Like to here it' here it go. If I'm being too annoying, let me know. (Just let me know). But it's hard for me to not hate, when I'm on MySpace. I never see my face in your top eight. Approaching six weeks now. It's kinda obvious that your either occupied or playing a game. All my money is on the latter. This is not an 'LOL' matter. Why would you pass up a chance this great'. If there was two forces, and I split them down the middle. I could swing back and forth for three days, rephrase. If I had two horses and I beat them with authority. I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face. But all I got is this Power Book and iChat. Besides I hit you all the time and you never write back. I stay on my feet. (Shit). And be persistent until my name is under who you'd like to meet. Just click approve. It's so simple. Show me some kind of sign. And let me know it's time to make my move. Click approve. Come on girl. Baby I'm one of a kind. And I ain't got time to lose. Click approve. You're killing me here. Show me some kind of sign. And let me know it's time to make my move. Click approve. Come on girl. Baby I'm one of a kind. And I ain't got time to lose. Who cares if we don't know each other's last name'. All I know is that I'm smittin' with your pictures. Wishing you would feel the same. I admit I get a little jealous when other dudes leave you comments. Don't let it gash you up, it's all nonsense. Maybe I've been romancing a thought. Of me and you speaking in tongues. In this mansion I bought but it's all wishful thinking. Just give me some kind of sign. And let me know I'm not freaking you out. And if you lovin' what I'm speaking about than sing something. I check my inbox ten times and ain't nothing. You probably busy doing something sexy. I just hope I'm in your thoughts next time you log in. And if not, ain't no love lost between you and me. I'll be here like your man in fully down as he used to be. So yeah, it's time to sign out my vision's getting blurry. This is madness, XOXO dash Travis. Just click approve. It's so simple. Show me some kind of sign. And let me know it's time to make my move. Click approve. Come on girl. Baby I'm one of a kind. And I ain't got time to lose. Click approve. You're killing me here. Show me some kind of sign. And let me know it's time to make my move. Click approve. Come on girl. Baby I'm one of a kind. And I ain't got time to lose"
4th period: clothes off!,"See here's the thing. We have to take off those clothes. We have to party all night. And we have to take off those clothes. To have a good time. Oh no. Excuse me miss. I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are. I dig the attitude and how you're acting like you own the bar. Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car. Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are. I'm trying to see how your lips feel. Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travee and I'm pretty much a big deal. Oh, you've never heard of me. That sounds absurd to me. The way you stole my attention was flat out burgulary. What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can. Possibly reconvene and play some naked peekaboo. Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through. And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too. Such an angel with a devilish angle. And quite the certified sweet talker. And you're buying every line of it girl. And I don't really blame you. If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too. We have to take off those clothes. We have to party all night. And we have to take off those clothes. To have a good time. Oh no. Now here's another bar, I'm coming for the slow gunners. Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus. Next stop, right around the corner from your momma live. No turning back so you better buckle up. Shit, don't be concerned with mine. I feel like a Speak and Spell way I got you learning my lines. Fine, pull the string, replay that shit. I change my name to ""did he really just say that shit?"". Yep. I'll take a mile if you let me. Six-five, two hundred plus and so sexy. My legs going up for keeping my phone on vibrate. To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me. And I've been tryin to never mind it man. But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn. And you thought you had it sewn up. Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up. We have to take off those clothes. We have to party all night. And we have to take off those clothes. To have a good time. Oh no. Got chicks, all hot chicks. And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks. Slim chicks, round chicks. Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks. Got chicks, all hot chicks. And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks. Slim chicks, round chicks. Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks. Good grief girl, you're giving me goosebumps. Standing there in your underwear and new pumps. It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you. Honestly I could easily replace you. It's not a skam girl. That's how I am girl. Peter Pan, I'm a sucka for smucka's jam girl. It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun. Shut up and kiss me like the antedotes under my tongue. Whoa. We have to take off those clothes. And we have to party all night. And we have to take off those clothes. To have a good time. Oh no. We have to take off those clothes. And we have to party all night. And we have to take off those clothes. To have a good time. Oh no. Got chicks, all hot chicks. And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks. Slim chicks, round chicks.

The world is yours, so play the role.. Blow the dust off this record and put the needle down slow.. Our veins are cold, but we'll never grow old.. Lets have a toast, and raise our drinks..

7th period: 7 weeks,"My life's these yellow lines, concrete, and parliment butts. Exhaust fumes and rest stops who drive hard for their bucks. Load in, sound check, play show, load out, let's go, next city, oh great, off day. Hangovers, hangups, dialbacks, running make up, apologies and promises. And nobody acknowledges that boys in bands got it so damn bad. But we love like the last cigarette we'll ever have. I'm putting miles on my body, bout due for a tune up in this gas station, food ain't really helping but. I'm loving every minute, every road signs a reminder of exactly why we did it to begin with. This is how it has to be. A kiss for luck, submerge myself. And in 7 weeks resurface. Even if we don't look back again. Tired boys and wired eyes. Exposing imperfections. To the public eye we're perfect. Even if we don't look back again. I like these hotels, passports, random bag checks, day dreams of love affairs that I haven't had yet. Touch down, baggage claim, new town, different dame, same clothes, 7 days, whew, damn I need to change. And it's a lifestyle that I wouldn't recommend. Wild N Out on a level Nic Cannon couldn't comprehend (fuck outta here). We made a lot of friends and even more enemies. Some of which were genuine and others just pretend to be. Soft raving baby, life's lovely. Even when the gray rain cloud's right above me. The girl's textin' me talkin' about gettin' all cuddly. Cause you paint a pretty picture but the frame is so ugly. This is how it has to be. A kiss for luck, submerge myself. And in 7 weeks resurface. Even if we don't look back again. Tired boys and wired eyes. Exposing imperfections. To the public eye we're perfect. Even if we don't look back again. And now it's back in a van with four of my mans. Until we catchin' a tan on the Florida sands. I feel like tourin' this land's made me more of a man. From killa California to the shores of Japan. Good times stayin' up late in Austin. Coast to coast V8 to Chicago. To gettin' up with Johnny Cupcakes in Boston. And smokin' that most great eight in Colorado. Home ain't home no more. I hug the road and kiss the concrete and sometimes I even hear her heartbeat. No matter where we go or where we at. We carry upstate on our back, it's like that. This is how it has to be. A kiss for luck, submerge myself. And in 7 weeks resurface. Even if we don't look back again. Tired boys and wired eyes. Exposing imperfections. To the public eye we're perfect. Even if we don't look back again. This is how it has to be. A kiss for luck, submerge myself. And in 7 weeks resurface. Even if we don't look back again. Tired boys and wired eyes. Exposing imperfections. To the public eye we're perfect. Even if we don't look back again. ""So a lot of you don't realize. There's a whole subculture of boys driving around in vans."". Even if we don't look back again. ""Looking for your daughters, and your lottery tickets. Love it or leave it. I'm like this"". Even if we don't look back again. ""I love my life. Bitches."". Even if we don't look back again. Even if we don't look back again"
"8th period: it's ok, but just this once!","We put the ""F-U"" back in fun. Serve it up with a smile. You ain't heard this type of stuff in a while. I want your ears right now. Ante up, buck stops here. Put your hands up, like you plan to volunteer. Ollie ollie Oxy Free. Fresh outta detox. Can't afford the doctor's fee. So floor it towards the weed spot. A whole city waitin' for me to fall. Because I made a pretty penny outta nothin' at all. It's that ""circle, cirle, dot, dot"". Cootie shot shit, you know. Everybody lovin' it, but ain't nobody touchin' it, yeah. Decaydance takin' over this year. I feel like dancin' baby hold my fears (So Sexy). And it's ok to be a little risky (ooooh, Ah the Good Times). Forget work it's all play at the end of the day (ooooh, Ah the Good Times). Just be sure to send the females my way (ooooh, Ah the Good Times). Oh look at how cute, we made a mess on the dance floor. So let me get a soul clap, that's what we got hands for. [Clapping]. That's exactly what I've been trying to tell you, Pete, look at 'em. I know you seen 'em as soon as we came in,. Pick your jaw up man, it's alright we havin' a good time,. Ha! Stupid.... Mission acccomplished. Operation spike punch successful. Now back to tellin' girls im only nineteen, wowzers!. Bob's parents ain't back for another six hours. So it's just enough time to kill the keg that's in the shower. Curse you aquascum, follow the leader. Made today's big fish outta yesterday's bottom feeders.

ass back home (feat. neon hitch),"[Neon Hitch]. I don't know where you're going. Or when you're coming home. I left the keys under the mat to our front door. For one more chance to hold you close. I don't know where you're going. Just get your ass back home. [Travie McCoy]. We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions. So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing. And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact. When you call and I don't know what city I'm in at. Or what day of the week in the middle of the month. In a year I don't recall. It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke. I told you I wouldn't be long. That was last November, now December's almost gone. I'd apologize but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong. [Neon Hitch]. I don't know where you're going. Or when you're coming home. I left the keys under the mat to our front door. For one more chance to hold you close. I don't know where you're going. Just get your ass back home. [Travie McCoy]. And you've been nothing but amazing. And I never take that for granted. Half of these birds would have flew the coop. But you, you truly understand it. And the fact you stood beside me. Every time you heard some bogusness. You deserve a standing o 'cause they'd a just been over it. Let em talk, let em talk, let em talk, let em talk. Like we don't hear what they saying. Let em walk, let em walk, let em walk, let em walk. We'll just drive by and keep waving. Cause you and I above all that. Just let them wallow in it. Now they all choked up, yuck. Cause they be swallowing it. [Neon Hitch]. I don't know where you're going. Or when you're coming home. I left the keys under the mat to our front door. For one more chance to hold you close. I don't know where you're going. Just get your ass back home. [Travie McCoy]. No one hold me down like you do sweetheart. You keep doing that, I keep doing this. We'll be alright in the end. Trust that. We put the us in trust, baby. Let's go. [Neon Hitch]. I don't care what you're after. As long as I'm the one, no. I don't care why you're leaving. You'll miss me when you're gone. I don't know where you're going. Or when you're coming home. I left the keys under the mat to our front door. For one more chance to hold you close. I don't know where you're going. Just get your ass back home. I'm home, baby"

Where were you the other day?. Your car was parked at 38th. But you were. At your mothers place?. Your mother lives on Broadway. I followed you all day. I called but you ignored it. When you kissed him. In the hallway. Call me crazy, call me odd. Call me what you want to. But Karma is a bitch. I pray to God. She always haunts you. You told me it's the truth. But I'm still afraid. I'm not the one. That would jump the gun. If I had proof. I'd take off my shades. And be blinded by the sun. You said you were in love. But the games you played.

It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend. And I know it sounds so old. But cupid got me in a chokehold. And I'm afraid I might give in. Towels on the mat my white flag is wavin'. I mean she even cooks me pancakes. And alka seltzer when my tummy aches. If that ain't love then I don't know what love is. We even got a secret handshake. And she loves the music that my band makes. I know I'm young but if I had to choose her or the sun. I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun. (ba ba da da, ba ba da da). Take a look at my girlfriend. She's the only one I got (ba ba da da).

Type of girl that will make you way proud of your son. And I know you heard the last song about the girls that didn't last long. But I promise this is on a whole new plane. I can tell by the way she says my name (ba ba da da). I love the way she calls my phone. She even got her very own ringtone. If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (ba ba da da). It's gonna be a long drive home but I know as soon as I arrive home. And I open the door take off my coat and throw my bag on the floor. She'll be back into my arms once more for sure. Take a look at my girlfriend. She's the only one I got (ba ba da da). Not much of a girlfriend. I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da). She's got a smile that would make the most senile. Annoying old man bite his tongue. I'm not done. She's got eyes comparable to sunrise. And it doesn't stop there. Man I swear. She's got porcelain skin of course she's a ten. And now she's even got her own song. But movin' on. She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard. And we can be on the phone for three hours. Not sayin' one word. And I would still cherish every moment. And when I start to build my future she's the main component. Call it dumb call it luck call it love or whatever you call it but.

detention: sloppy love jingle pt. 3,"The bombs been detonated. I'm just waitin' for an explosion, I was just waitin' on 2nd and it was time for me to close in on 3rd. With blurred vision and in, precisely placed slurred words we started kissin'. Man listen, it was like a scene from a very bad B movie with a very low budget. But fuck it, I was drunk and I admit I loved it. Every last second, I couldn't kill that thought of us butt ass naked. Tele' surfin' with the fan on, chattin' about the session and, slowly gettin' into some closet skeleton confessions. That's when, she made a offer that I couldn't refuse. And chills went up and down my legs like Samoan tattoos. She said she had a pad that wasn't too far away, and said she'd love if I stayed til the following day. So it was time to exit stage left, I made my rounds, gave my pounds and hugs, gathered my thoughts and took a deep breath. And now we're walkin' to the door but, right before we stepped outside she bought me one more. And now I'm feelin' it, I had my had down my pocket but she's stealing it,. with our fingers in a locket and as we're walkin' down Exchange Street, with. our hearts pitter pattering to the same beat. And then she popped the question like ""Jack, you evah been in love?"" I'm like ""pshhh not that I recall"". Well there was one situation, but I didn't have the patience, or the balls to say it and everytime I tried I just digitally delayed it. And it sounded like something blah blah blah blah, man my speach impetement left my heart vacant without a single resident. The first tenant got evicted the second she settled in, I seen her the other day riding my bike and kept peddlin'. If it wasn't for meddlin' kids would love even exist nope, if it wasn't for alcohal would I even be saying this nope. She probably took offence, I probably started gettin' sober 'cause she started gettin' ugly and I think probably told her. Then my feet got heavy, I started drippin' sweat, knew I was gettin' into something I'd probably regret. Right when I lit the cigerrette I caught a case of the spins, and started wishin' I was still at the bar with my friends. And then it happened, I fell flat on my face. When I awoke I found I was in a very strange place. I must've got my wish granted 'cause I was butt ass naked, but the only downside was that the room was very vacant. Except next to the bed there was this note on the dresser, while I'm tryin' to deal with this hangover head pressure. With a smile I grabbed the note, lit a smoke and sat back, ""Dear whoever, lose my number P.S. the sex was wack"""

drnk txt rmeo,"I usually avoid any kind of confrontation, conversation, moderation,. Lips sealed but my fingers are flying. And hours the hours pass they grow more impatient. My phone is magnetic, especially when I'm sauced up. And I admit that I'm ashamed. But there's Melissa, Theresa and Emily what a toss up. But that's the best part of the game. And I’m really an anonymous aspiring alcoholic drowning the days pain in hops, barley and grain. Thinking of ways to convince one to join me in the company of low-lifes sort doing the same.

I know I want to but I can’t and I shouldn’t. Try to put my phone down, damn, but I couldn’t. Stayed on the phone with him all night long. Text message when I’m gone.

everyday's forecast,"You think you know, but you have no idea. This is the diary of a breathing onomanopia. Now here's another broken link for anyone who thinks my life's together. I rock a raincoat despite the pleasant weather. God's placed a permanent dark cloud above my head. But he was nice enough to loan me a holy umbrella. Well thank ya fella,. How considerate. I'm the illegitimate son of accident-prone degenerates. Today's forecast partly cloudy with a good chance of rain. So I wear my sarcasm badge proudly and. Flash a devilish grin. That'll make the most masculine Men skeptical of his existence. And when the rain begins, I take a seat to retire and admire the spectacle. From a distance. For instance, there was this cat the other day shootin me ice grills. But when I looked, he looked the other way. Now any other day. Wouldn't let this type of shit bother me. Today it was enough to make my lucky charms soggy. So finally I stepped to him. Kindly disrespected him. Looked him dead in the eyes and analyzed how it effected him. He broke down in tears talkin bout how Jesus neglected him. Make this rain go away. Things would be much better. I swear, I swear. If the sun would come out today. Life would be more worthwhile, worthwhile,. And all it took was a sewing needle to deflate my swollen ego. Then pop pop went my God Complex. I never thought 19 yrs after my first breath I'd be in art school surrounded. By corny fucks debating who's more depressed. I'm 21 now, and still can't deal with what's real. But I'll be damned if I give up and settles for pills. Daddy taught me better. Mommy taught me how to crack 40's and jack 6 packs in oversized sweaters. And one time my mother changes. So I'm in the rain waiting. For the flood gates to open. Impersonating my favorite VH1 Behind the Music tragedy. Catastrophe never tasted so acidic before. I'm PH balanced. For the floor? But strong enough to stay a float. And doggy paddle long enough to catch that. Life preserver rope. And then I'll be on a parallel ladder laughin like,. Damn my man, for the love of Pete what happened. And finally I step to you. Kindly disrespect you. Looked you dead in the eyes and analyzed how it affected you. Watch you break down in tears talkin bout how J. Esus neglected you. Misdirected the definition of pitiful. Make this rain go away. Things would be much better. I swear, I swear. If the sun would come out today. Life would be more worthwhile, worthwhile,. Yo, you ever watch a whole day wash away like your. Very last match that got wet the second you struck it. Well go ahead relieve your stress, kick bucket all you want,. A cigarette that never mattered's all you stuck with. You ever watch a whole day wash away like your.

faces in the hall,"I knew this kid named Alberto. Funny style cat. And his girl looked like a turtle. Not Lisa Turtle, just a turtle. High school track. He ran the hurdle. His peers shed tears senior year when he got murdered. Now Alberto was your average A student. Participated in class,. Never came late. And never truant. His family was picture perfect. His older sister was prom queen. His dad a decorated vet from the Vietnam team. His mother was Dear Abby,. An ordinary house wife. Like clockwork, always had dinner on the table at 5. But Alberto had a monster he kept under his bed. Instead of letting it out,. He just got a girlfriend instead. She knew something was funny. Shecould tell by his behavior. Or the way he flamboyantly shook his hand. When he would wave to her. She thought nothing of it. And just shoved it in the closet. Until the day that word dripped out like leaky faucet. Alberto was homosexual. I ain't have nothing against it. But little Ronnie Johnson and all his football player friends did. They'd always pick and nag. Call him ""fag"" and such and such. And couldn't wait to get to gym so they could really bust his nuts. The gym teacher never cared. He'd just join in on the action. He'd make silly gestures. And compared him to Micheal Jackson. Alberto couldn't take it. He'd just stop showing up and whenever he walked them halls. He just felt like throwin' up. And night he would cry and cry and ask ""God why?"". Like ""God, why the fuck'd I have to be born this way?"". God would reply, ""Son, you've gotta show 'em you're more than gay"". Cause he had dreams to be a track star. Until that warm April night. Them gay jokes went way too far. Ronnie begged for his forgiveness. And invited him to a party. Cause his parents went away. And left him plenty of Bacardi. Alberto kindly accepted. He was finally accepted. Except it was all deception. And left them all unprotected. It was a plan Ronnie had scammed. To get him in the right place. Verbally degrade and rearrange his pretty face. The plan would go swiftly. They started calling him sissy. One punch turned into fifty. They beat him till he was dizzy. Now Alberto lie in blood. While his peers look on in fear. He took his last breath. And passed away his senior year. Needless to say. It was one big tragedy. And how was Ronnie gonna explain to his family,. While they were on vacation taking in sights. He got wasted and killed a kid that night. Don't be a slave and behave the way they do,. Just utilize the gifts that God gave you [x4]. I knew this girl named Maria. Bright and talented. With aspirations to be a. Big superstar. What a great idea. Until she fell off and started to listening to her peers. Oh dear!. Now Maria was your typical obnoxious. Analytical head strong rebel. Flippin' off the principal. Single mother home structure. She looked after baby brother. While mom worked two jobs. Just to buy supper. Pops was a struggling musician. Troubled man,. Juggling family and heroin addiction. He overdosed and left a notice of eviction. And a crate of records on the table in the kitchen. And a little angel with a keen sense of sound. Who saw silence in the records she found. And she would stay up late at night. Reciting songs to herself. Under pale moonlight. Righting wrongs that her pops made,. Promised her mom she'd never go that same route. Turns out. Carrie Anne had other plans. Her and her man Ronnie most popular,. Second best to nobody. Homecoming queen versus ugly duckling. And the story ends the same way. Ok, Ronnie's parents went away for a couple of days. And told him ""No Drinking"". What the fuck were they thinking?. Maria was oblivious that her boyfriend had already been invited. So when Carrie Anne asked. She got all excited. Like ""damn now I got something to look forward to"". Or so she thought. Maria kindly accepted,. Except it was all bullshit. Not pay attention,. Carrie Anne hated Maria cause she could sing. So she scored a bag of heroin. But the craziest thing was. Maria never touched drugs, she did that night. And when her man was getting beat. She was nowhere in sight. Now her boyfriend lie in blood. And she had no idea. Alberto passed away and she got hooked her senior year. Needless to say. It was one one big tragedy. And I hate to break it but. It doesn't end happily. A warm day in May,. The sky was so beautiful. Carrie Anne died in a crash leaving the funeral"

"holy horseshit, batman!!","She reached her hand out with a pamphlet and I politely said. ""No, Ma'am"". I mean no disrespect and. I apologize if this fucks up your program. You tell me I'm gonna burn for lying. But the heat can turn water to wine. Well if there's a hell below then we're all gonna' be just fine.. So there I stood six feet in sin, a walking contradiction. but am I wrong for posing questions or am. I just another lost soul searching?. Then she gave me a look so unchristian. And told she'd pray for my children. I said ""If you're so holy you'll probably out-live me but if. I bought a Jesus piece do you think he'd forgive me?"". Maybe I would be a fool to think.. That somewhere in the sky's a place for me.. What good would it be to pray for me?. You won't save me, don't pray for me.. Now I've never been religious,. I'm just a big fan of logistics.. And if it makes sense then I'm all for it.. I even pray if the situation calls for it.. Somebody asked me if I believe in miracles,. I try to answer without sounding satirical.. I'm 3 years past my expiration and yet. I'm still fresher than a newborn. So I guess that's my explanation but it's safe to say. I've never seen a unicorn and I never chase rainbows. But I hear the devil wears designer clothes. So does God have a favourite brand?. and for that matter, is he even a man?. and will I go to hell for even saying that?. only time will tell I'm just relaying facts.. Maybe I would be a fool to think,. That somewhere in the sky's a place for me.. What good would it be to pray for me?. You won't save me, don't pray for me.. {Instrumental}. Maybe I would be a fool to think,. That somewhere in the sky's a place for me.. What good would it be to pray for me?. You won't save me, don't pray for me.. Maybe I would be a fool to think,.

"lazarus, ze gitan","Let's go. My first love was a chick from the sixth in geneva. Had to take the 88 upstate just to see her. My mother never liked her. My father didn't neither. After 22 years he got eager and had to leave her.. Now I'm realizing how much I really need her. But someone said follow my heart and head east for her. That's when I met brooklyn, but brooklyn was a cheater. The second I turned my back. She ain't .... So I started packing what happened. I told her I was leavin her for her older sister manhattan,. Manhattan was into rap so we started chit-chatting. And she was chinese, italian, black and porto-latin. Super high maintenance and way too into fashion. Didn't even tell the piecer from the corner basket. Damn, but back then was back then. Now I heard she went hollywood and began acting. Oh, I've been looking for love. In all the wrong places. Oh somebody take me home. I've been falling in love. With all the wrong faces. Oh somebody take me home. Please take me home. And after manhattan, I was acting silly. Messing with a street body jewel named friendly. But that didn't work out too great. A vegetarian and all she ate was cheesecake. I went to boston more for mary ann. And almost got married man. But she was self-centered always stuck to mary land. I knew a slim thing named virginia. I swear to god her body's smoking but she kept gettin thinner. And I'll never forget my first trissie. In the pins with the carolina twins gettin busy. I know the history but I had to leave early. On the 85 doin 80 friday bright and early. And met gorgeous piece of thin. Who used to stay in atlanta. Accent so thick I couldn't even understand her. And that's when I realized. I damn near ran through the whole I-95. Oh, I've been looking for love. In all the wrong places. Oh somebody take me home. I've been falling in love. With all the wrong faces. Oh somebody take me home. Please take me home. Yeah, then I met miami, she was spanish. Miami te amo, mi chiamo travis. She could tell that I wasn't bilingual. I don't know pogito, but I know un poquito. We can hit south beach and drink mojitos. And maybe you can introduce me to your people. Ha, yo no voi pedra. You're my first love, keep on coming. You no voi payar. I think I finally found where Imma stayin. But never forget the 88. Oh, I've been looking for love. In all the wrong places. Oh somebody take me home. I've been falling in love. With all the wrong faces. Oh somebody take me home. Please take me home"

"like father, like son (papa's song)","Papa was a rolling stone. But I wanna be a cover of the rolling stone. Only if I know that I can do it alone. Only if I know that I can do it alone.. August 6th, 1981 I took my first breath. They said I smiled and cried until it was none left. I guess I knew what I was in for before hand. Miniture grown man ha. Third of three sons. Big bird and squirt guns. Aunt tammy dressed up as a clown when I turned one. Scared the shit out of me but thanks for trying. Sitting in my highchair throwing cake and crying. I remember everything, every single detail, clinging on daddy's leg like don't leave I'll be good. I promise. I'll do anything honest. But he had to go to work and bust his ass for those dollars. Now it all makes sense, back then I wasn't havin it, obsessed with [heatin it?] so young and so adimit. Walking [sir castle] grade school and baseball and I learned that if I worked a little that I could have it all.. All of my friend's had allowances, I had a paper route. And when no one was looking I threw the papers out. I got caught made dad was furious and if your gonna do something do it right, thats what earnest is.. Papa was a rolling stone. But I wanna be a cover of the rolling stone. Only if I know that I can do it alone. Only if I know that I can do it alone.. Papa was a rolling stone working hard while I was home alone. This is some Macaulay Culkin shit so bit. Little man had a plan and had to follow through with it but moms was so inconsiderate. Illiterate? Nope. I read the dictionary daily. Give the gap the rap and set sailing step moms get the poop end of the stick nothing new to me. Don't act like my momma because my dad bought you jewlery. Oh and time [coolery?] I sat back and watched pops play with women like chess, check mate. Six sibilings, three different moms. Can you imagine seeing your paycheck get broken down into fractions. Papa was a pimp, married four time, indicisive, trynna strike a gold mine. Sittin in the truth of sand something like a fortynine up to the point where my chest becomes a cold mine. But when they come and go, I'll be here at the bitter end just letting you know. I never understood temptation I guess we both got a little David Rufus in us. Everybody sing it with us now.. Papa was a rolling stone. But I wanna be a cover of the rolling stone. Only if I know that I can do it alone. Only if I know that I can do it alone.. Papa was a rolling stone. But I wanna be a cover of the rolling stone. Only if I know that I can do it alone. Only if I know that I can do it alone."

live forever (fly with me),"(chorus)I see a window and all i can think about is,. So do you wanna fly with me. Do you wanna fly with me.. I know it sounds crazy but I can't find solid. ground,. So Do you wanna fly with me,. Do you wanna fly with me.. (Verse 1). And i've been staring out this window for the past eleven hours,. thinking of all the opportunities this window has to offer,. from the twenty third floor and a filing cabinet east manhattan and FDR is beautiful as I'm watching all the cars passing.. Then a couple stars twinkle so I started laughing and a couple walked by and they look so happy.. I booked this room at this place called the last resort,. All my bags are packed, I got my jacket and my passport. and a first class ticket to the afterlife, you dig me?. Now is you is or is you aint with me?. And i fully understand if you've got other plans,. But i can't see you hand in hand with another man.. I been on auto-pilot since we last spoke,. And i dont wanna board this flight on a bad note.. I want you to think about it, but either way I'm going And if you really love me, then here's your chance to show it.. (Chorus)I see a window and all i can think about is,. So do you wanna fly with me. Do you wanna fly with me.. I know it sounds crazy but I can't find solid. ground,. So Do you wanna fly with me,. Do you wanna fly with me.. (2x) We'll live forever and maybe we'll write a. novel about our love.. (Verse 2). She looked me dead in the eyes and took me by the hand. Kissed me on my cheek and said,""Baby listen i understand,. You don't have to leave, plus I'm scared of heights,. So just put down your luggage, and just forget this flight.. You and I, you know we been through a lot of things,. But it's no reason to start trippin' and arguing."". She said,""You are my king and i place no one above you,. And i don't have to board a plane for me to show i love you.. And all this talk about the afterlife is kinda creepy. So let's just go lay down and talk, I'm getting kinda sleepy."". I kinda smiled and we both walked to the window,. I pulled the shutters, started staring at the sky.. I wiped a couple tears away, then we looked at each other and i could see the stars twinkle in her eyes.. I told her about the couple that I saw earlier.. She said, ""I'ms sure they were cute but they're no you and I."". (Chorus)I see a window and all i can think about is,. So do you wanna fly with me.

lunch: sloppy love jingle pt. 1,"[Roll Sloppy Love Jingle Sequence 1. Action!]. Bartender!. ""Yeah I hear your wise ass, give me a minute."". I'm trying to get this round over here.. ""What do you think I'm just working for you here?"". Actually, will you, will you send a drink, to the lady at the end of the bar? Yeah that one right there.. ""Here you are man."". Yeah, yeah. It's on me. Tell her it's from Travie.. ""It's from this guy over here."". From the second she shimmied in. I was intrigued by her essence. And my first instincts to make sure that my presence was felt. Simple and plain. I'm probably jumping the train. But all I could see was my name engraved on her belt. Hit the pause button. Damn!. I don't even know this girl. And I'm already practicing my sweet-nothins. But that's a classic trait of a soft-spoken, heart-broken, fellow like my self best believe (pussy). I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve. But that night the Jagermeister had my sleeves rolled up. Wait a minute, hold up. I think she caught me grillin' now I'm spillin' my drink (don't look don't look). I knew our feelings were in sync so now she gave me the wink. The only problem is, I'm not your ordinary, average Romeo. A Cyrano de Bergerac (shut the fuck up). In fact, I remember back in fifth grade. I tried to read the book of love, but sadly. The introduction didn't grab me. So I left it on the shelf and kept moving. Assuming that this planet rotates. I'll just procrastinate until the day I bump into my soulmate. Who would've thunk I would be pissy ass drunk when time came for collision. So I made the decision to just keep my composure (cool cool). Until she started getting closer. And then I felt this weird feeling underneath my left shoulder, and then I. Slipped, tripped, busted my lip and fell in love. The minute that she stepped in the door. The type of girl I'd have to make a couple mix tapes for. To me she equaled MC squared and everything else was mathematics. I never took the time to practice"
make out club,"If I recall correctly. It was the middle of spring. Walkin with my boys. Contiplating what summer will bring. We started talkin about girls. And it was the funniest thing. As I started to remember some of the funniest things. See there was ashley,. She caught my eye the second that she pasted me. I kissed her once. Then she started to harrase me. She called all night long. I had to buy a brand new phone. And let me see. There was mellony. To have a mouth like that should be a felony. Wouldn't believe half the shit that she was tellin me. I mean dirty vocab. She used to talk like she was crunk. And after that was tiffany. The one with the cute cousin. Are you kiddin' me?. She had a man. But that didn't mean shit to me. He tryed to catch us all the time. But I was just to god dam smooth. And I can't forget to mention Carrie. But that situation quickly got scary. Cuz after 2 days she was like lets get married. Can you believe that shit?. I had to pack my bags and move!. They say I gotta change my evil ways. And I'm workin hard at it every day but. No matter what i do. I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to. If love is just a game that people play. And practice make perfect is what they say but. No matter what I do. I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to. I'll always remember Monica. The jewish chick. She'd always give me gifts for Chanukkah. To met her folks she'd try and make me rock a yhomica. But she looked so dam good. She almost made my ass convert. And after that there was Lisa. She had a twin sister, Teresa. I bumped into them at Cam's gettin pizza. The greatest night of my life. Schleps to rock that kill to birds. And there was Erica. She had the stankest breath in North America,. I tryed to slip her tic tacs. But they were scared of her. And when we made out. I always had to plug my nose. And I supose your know the sister. Shoot, I swear by hand and God. I only kissed her. I gotta foot fetish. But she gotta lota blisters. I mean hammer time feet. You think she had walked from Boca Raton. They say I gotta change my evil ways. And I'm workin hard at it every day but. No matter what I do. I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to. If love is just a game that people play. And practice make perfect is what they say but. No matter what I do. I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to. Yo Matt,. Remember Catherine?. She talked so much. I used to make her bring me aspirine. Bla, bla bla bla. I'm doin fine thanks for askin. I even tryed to make a muzzle. But her mouth would just not quite. Oh Shit. Remember Shuana. I hate to bring her up again. I didn't want her. That girl I talked about. In ""that girls a dog"" song. Yea the poster girl from pac sun. Almost made me lose my grip. And oh shit. There was Krystal. The meth head. She used to sniff like a fist full. One time she chased me down thr street with a pistol. She tryed to say I took her stash. She bugged out and tryed to kill my ass. And at last we got Kimmy. She went abroad. Came back. And broke up with me. And so I ripped up all them letter that she sent me. I cryed for like 3 days. Then it was back to my evil ways. They say I gotta change my evil ways. And I'm workin hard at it every day but. No matter what I do. I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to. If love is just a game that people play.

At least till my name's in the same lane as Buzz. You gonna have to respect me for making ""being uncool"" cool. With no capris and sandals, Ray Bans. Skinny pants and flannels. So insecure I'm tugging at my t-shirt. 'Cause I swear the girl behind me staring at my love handles. I just wanna change the channel or delete 'em. Where the fuck is Adam Sandler when you need him. Or Christopher Walken. On my Papercut shit again, thank God for Walkmans. And I gotta thank God often. 'Cause otherwise I'll be like these other guys. This type of scene just ain't my thing. Everybody's too cool for school. And yet somehow I never felt so alone. In a room full of people. So now I'mma seat on this stoop. And I'mma gonna lace up my boots. And keep on walking till I make my way home. Can someone tell me how I got here in the first place?. 'Cause honestly in my opinion this the worst place. I mean I even said hello to a few girls. I feel like Brad Pitt, stuck in cool world. 'Cause everything's so foreign. And all the conversations boring. I mean I'm practically snoring. Could somebody please show me the door, man?. 'Cause I don't think that I can take it. Everybody here is desperate hip like replacements. That's probably why I ain't sayin' shit. Oh what the hell I might as well get wasted. 'Cause I'd rather be sedated than conversate. About whose sneakers are more outrageous. Or whose outfit's the latest. I think I'll blow jokes on you, greatest. This type of scene just ain't my thing. Everybody's too cool for school. And yet somehow I never felt so alone. In a room full of people. So now I'mma seat on this stoop. And I'mma gonna lace up my boots.

Sometimes I think you do it simply cause you're bored. If you really loved me we'd be making love not war. But you'd rather waste the little time we do have. Going back and forth. Are you sorry now? Well too bad!. I can't believe I wasted all this fucking time. Instead of fighting with you I could have been writing rhymes or.... Hanging out with Stitch and watchin' ""Up"" or something. You never tried to meet me halfway. You played these little immature ass ga-ay-aymes. I tried to be the best man I can but. You were too dumb to understand.

And now he's steering it. Oh, dear God... what a disaster. And I probably shoulda done something faster. Wait, you know what? You can kiss my ass. You've been dropped from the label and I'm keepin' your masters. ""Travie you're a bastard!"". Call me what you want to. Whatever makes you feel better, I don't want you. P.S.

But, I'm not a teacher. So go ahead and close your book up. I could tell a fairy tale so convincing. And keep a straight face from beginning. To happy ending. I could waste 32 bars telling you how to live. Knowing damn well I used mtv cribs for the blueprint. I could bore you to death with my past relationships. Or a little ditty bout Jack and Dianne. Or I could go back to childhood. Dig up them skeletons. And spit them at you with a catchy hook. Look, I could strike a nerve with some four letter words. That'll make Richard Pryor proud. Or better yet, I could sing a jingle that'll contort and mingle. Every single solitary letter in the alphabet. (I could tell you whatever you want to hear.

And put them in the air. with both my middle fingers up. or talk about myself in third person. like I'm better than you. cuz there's nothing else better to do. I could attack your character from.

petrified life and the twice told joke (decrepit bricks),"I walk on decrepit bricks. And kick sticks and rusty soda cans. Simply for lack of better stimulation. Motivation comes and goes like gas station patrons. So sedation compensates for unexpected vacations. (Thank you ). That's my pre-gratitude. Post-please leave me alone that's just my rude attitude. No dysfunction flipside, I'm just your ordinary citizen. They're waiting patiently for me to sin again, but then again (shit...). I'm really mommy's little angel,. But that angel on my shoulder got strangled. For trying to tangle with his nemesis he caught him on the wrong day. And got cut like DJs spinning doubles -(let the fucking song play). I'm on my way to the store,. Ignoring the city to purchase a pack of marb reds. With a stack of rolled pennies. I could go for Denny's, and my stomach holds plenty,. But my pockets got holes, I guess the goal is to stay empty.... Quite simply put, me and my pockets share interest. I never fall in love with that pretty green-eyed temptress,. Twice (yeah right). I learned my lesson the first time. I just couldn't keep up with that ever-changing Jordan line of foot apparel. Parallel to many clones, my eye's vision monochromes. With seven shades and twenty tones. Plus I breath artistic, they eating everything I'm feeding them. Put myself in every painting and use my spit as mat medium. And results of my children. We share the same genes,. Cast the same reflection and interpret the same dreams.. Like whoa [x3]. Whoa [x7]. And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose. Feeling like I'm worthless. But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine. Content with the fact that I know this city's mine. And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose. Feeling like I'm worthless. But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine. Content with the fact that I know this city's mine. I walk down dead end streets like I didn't see the sign. Just to turn around and walk back. That's fine and dandy, but what's whack is the fact I'm still walking. ...like... ""thank god for walkmans"". I'm only yawning cause these simply minded. Mortals make me sleepy. So what do I do? I resort to TV. In the seemingly lousy attempt to numb myself. With lackluster images. And insignificant information like ""Willis was really Ty Bridges"". Just to have the upper hand in monotonous conversation,. And for lack of better stimulation. I'm painting portraits of dysfunctional families. With gloomy faces rockin. ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" t-shirts, and you're assuming I'm tasteless?. You misconstrue it but your babies will embrace it. The basic essentials of a very bitter young man. That kicks rusty soda cans. And walks on decrepit bricks. With a permanent pair of headphones. Trying to make these lectures stick. I'll let the protestors picket,. Like they are going to make a difference. And watch them die before they realize that their cause was nonexistent. And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose). Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless). But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine. Content with the fact that I know this city's mine. And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose). Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless). But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine. Content with the fact that I know this city's mine. I walk on shitty city sidewalks stepping on every single crack. Reminiscent of that joke we used to say when we were snotty nose. My purpose got defeated when my mom turned paraplegic,. Plus I failed my civil service exam,. They said I cheated.. :not to mention tainted urine samples and the attention span of a second-grader. More fascinated with building blocks than wasting time stressing his daily lesson. Hence the ridilin I've been gone with the wind like lucky lottery tickets since day one (one). I stepped on the left cause rights wrong (wrong). So what do I do?I resort to friendly games of ping pong and sing a song of sixpence. I'm none the richer, I just kiss her on the lips and keep trucking. And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose). Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless). But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine. Content with the fact that I know this city's mine. And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose). Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless). But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine. Content with the fact that I know this city's mine"

This aint a song for the kids like the last album. Put em to bed go ahead and turn the volume up. A couple meds to ease the pain of the papercuts. The doctor says slow down maybe later buts. 40 milligrams, a 40 and im faded. This world is crazy so I stay medicated. Percaset, adavan, and colonapen. When my social lights are out. They turn them on again. I need em till im bored again. Oxycontin on juice on gin. Equals projectile wild style burner on a porcelain. Pillmatic breezing these down im poundin honey grounds.

so long friend,"Today I wasn't even gonna take a shower. And then I got a call sayin' that. My cousin died in a fire. So I washed myself for what seemed like three hours. Tears in rusty water. I need some of that calgon. Take me away action, immediately. 'fore I start scrubbin' my hands hard repeatedly. I'm stuck somewhere lethargic between reality. In a fuckin' school video. Wake me up. I say goodbye too many times these 22 long ones. Here I am wavin' again. ""so long, friend"". I shoulda told her how this town doesn't like. when people leave. So it finds ways to keep 'em. It sews seeds and reaps 'em. And now she's part of that harvest. But different from all the others. Ask her mother how her smile touched souls. And warms cold hearts. Monique, I miss you. I wish I coulda kissed you farewell. And given you that tattoo you always asked for. But when I'm done tappin' bud lite on god's stomach. You got next. I'm done. Y'all take what you want from me. I'm going to wash my hands. I miss you boo"
solo discotheque,"When I close my eyes that's when she appears. I grab her by the thighs and I pull her near. But to my surprise it's just what I fear. Cause when I turn on the lights.

There's no one there, when I turn on the lights. There is no one there, when I turn on the lights. And just like that she's right back. She'll stay the night as long as I play the right track. She likes the lights low. And when she winds slow. I'm buyin' what she's selling. Ain't no telling where my mind goes. She leaves my mind blow like old speakers. She always comes and goes but I never leave her. She is like my favorite cut or replay. She makes them paper cuts go away. I hope she stays. I am by myself and I am dancing all alone.

And if I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?. Like with your hands ""look Travie, I can handle that"". Furthermore I apologize for any skipping tracks. It's just this last girl that played me left a couple of cracks. I used to, used to, used to now I'm over that. Cos holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts.

This melody was meant for you. To sing along to my stereo. To my stereo. So sing along to my stereo. If I was an old school 50 pound boombox. Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walked?. Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops. And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop?. And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me. When you have to purchase mad D batteries. I appreciate every mixtape your friends make. You never know, we come and go like on the interstate. I think I finally found a note to make you understand. If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand. Keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune. You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you. My heart's a stereo.

What\'s next upon the menu?. Hmm, maybe I should crack a joke. Attack and ask her if she smokes. Cause I can\'t seem to find my matches. And that could break the ice but. I\'m a bad actress with three lighters I acquired the previous night. And there I was do or die. She was approximately five feet away from my frame. So I decided to take a stride, swallow my pride, tellin\' her my name like. Hello miss, my name is Travis. Just a ordinary cat, I\'m into art and fuzzy rabbits, kinda smart with a big heart, you can have it. See you find that funny. I\'d love to buy you a drink but I got bent and spent my money. But would you kindly accept a raincheck. Perhaps some deep chit chat. She didn\'t think twice, nodded her head and said \""I\'m with that\"". By the way do you have some matches?. She\'s like, \""no, but there\'s a lighter right in front of you\"". And now we both giggling. This girl\'s so crazy, got my gullet jiggling. Fiddling with my feelings like an out of tune piano. Like I\'m on ritalin. The way she\'s got my undivided attention dismissin\' any thoughts of lettin\' this one get away"
taxi driver,"I took cutie for a ride in my deathcab. She tipped me with a kiss I dropped her off at the meth lab. Before she left she made a dashboard confessional. And spilled her guts in cursive but whats worse is. I could still see her bright eyes like sunny day real estate. Oh my and in a funny way it irritates. So high but no chance. My little chemical romance left a bad taste in my mouth. But I imposed her like hey mercedes why the long face. Why you cryin? theres no need. Just put on this coheed and fallout. Boy meets girl jimmy eat world. But Schlep eats pills till hes all out. Not once not twice she was thrice times a lady. Mackin on brand new, but I had to. Bounce over to the postal service to. Pick up these pills that take care of my nervousness. And all the way I saw planes that were mistooken for stars. She played games but she took em too far. At the drive in. Watching soft porn and you can tell. By the trail of the dead, that there was somethin in the popcorn. I hop in my cab destination midtown. Just to get up with some kids that like to get down. I'd made my rounds and that was that. In between the frowns and scraps and heart attacks. And I remember I seen her ass in early november. On a thursday takein back sunday for a refund. She shot a wink like no hard feelings. Then she jetted to brazil man them pills had me spun. This is the story of the year right here. This is hot water music. Put ya ramen into it"
the fighter (feat. ryan tedder),"Just waking up in the morning with the beat well. Quite honest with ya I ain't really sleep well. Ya ever feel like your train a thoughts been derailed?. That's when you press on, Lee nails. Half the population's just waitin to see me fail. Yeah right, you're better off trying to freeze hell. Some of us do it for the females. And others do it for the retails. But I do it for the kids, life's tough, time to head on. Everytime you fall it's only making your chin strong. And I be in your quarter like mid, baby, til the end. Or when you hear this song from that big lady. Until the referee rings the bell. Until both your eyes start to swell. Until the crowd goes home. What we gonna do ya'll?. [Ryan Tedder:]. Give em hell, turn their heads. Gonna live life til we're dead. Give me scars, give me pain. Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me. There goes a fighter. There goes a fighter. Here comes a fighter. That's what they'll say to me, say to me. Say to me, this one's a fighter. And if I can last thirty rounds. There's no reason you should ever have your head down. Six foot five, two hundred and twenty pounds. Hailing from rock bottom, loserville, nothing town. Text book version of the kid going nowhere fast. And now I'm yelling kiss my ass. It's gonna take a couple right hooks a few left jabs. For you to recognize that you really ain't got it bad. Until the referee rings the bell. Until both your eyes start to swell.

to bob ross with love,Now who you know leave the scene. Messier than canvas's by Jackson Pollock. Throwing multicolored thoughts at a rapid pace. I make a mess you dissect it and make sense of it. Then get back to me at your earliest convenience. Check my verbal sequence as I texturize these tracks. Seven layers to be exact eliminate the whack. With a firm brush stroke I mc paintily. Lyricists begin crumbling from my scumbling technique. As I tweak your audio and visual keep my drips minimal messages subliminal. Cause me and rap go way back we compliment. So together we enhance one another that's common sense. High intensity catches the eye your jaw drops. Be a real critic not explicit with false props. I keep my darks deep my lights bright I'm very thorough. With my churascurro inspiration spark and a knife. Now watch me rock the spot like ? minus the heroin. And make my face popular like Andy did to Marilyn. Its kinda scary when real art gets left behind. While they take bullshit and start sellin it to blind folks. But I remain humble as long as ? continues spinnin hot shit. On his twin twelve-hundred color wheels of steel. Fuck mass appeal art is art only the real can truly feel it. So open your eyes and listen. Combine your ears with vision. Or do it cause you love it. Or for cash that's your decision. That's your decision. That's your decision. Its like I'm torn between two worlds. A paintbrush and a microphone. A canvas or a beat. CD or LP. Anything goes when my ink pen flows. And God only knows where its gonna bring me next. So I'm inclined to like paint rhymes and spit kaleidoscopes with one eye closed. And I suppose if you chose the path that I chose. You know the cycle ass ho don't front. It goes inspiration and productivity then a sense of self worth and in steps depression. Like back and forth and forth and back. Should I paint a picture or record a track. A gift or a curse I don't know I'm still undecided. But over the years I've found clever ways to hide it. And those that lack the passion I have may despise it. But my momma made me this way I thank her everyday. So tell them kids to keep coloring outside the lines. Until they lose they limitations and they minds is free. Tell them teachers that you want your money back this time. And tell Bob Ross for all the happy little trees. And tell my momma that her baby boy is doing just fine. Although hes running out of patience but his mind is free. And tell my pops that I'll pay his money back sometime. And that his son is two steps away from where he needs to be

yearbook club: boys in bands interlude,"And so it goes.. We mouth your words when your tongues are too paralyzed.. We finish up the peanut butter jelly you get on your ?router? but never eat.. We still pee in bottles. We play at your graduation parties. We have fallen comrades, we just rebuild the team.. Our friends are rich and we love it.. Cause it makes us look wealthy too.. Shit, i still got a sidekick 1 with a crack in the fucking screen man.. We were your favorite ""i'm the first person to know about these guys"" band.. We dance to use me by bill winters in a drunken stupor. Untill ma gets ready to tell us to go the fuck home and kick us out.. We make mistakes. We love we hate. Were not angry anymore though. Still miss you. Still love you. Like a slug hates salt. And we're still your heroes."
za intro,"Hi, have you ever wondered what it would be like to listen to some music?. Well this is your big chance.. You see, music is much like a brochetted butterfly, with a shadowy prominade of effervescence, yet sloos down the bottom of misty moutains of darkness.. Like a flirtatious flounder upon a non-reflecting mirror.. God, what is this opaque window of comfort, that we cannot overcome?. It is a manafestation of love.. It a forest of emtpiness and it is an ocean with no water except where that which fills it.. So as you listen to this masterpiece release yourself from the prison of captivity and let your soul free.. Because only a free soul can be captured by greedy soul theives.. Who will have sold it to Leprechaun gold miners.. But it is only when your soul is taken away, that you can take it back.. And this my friend, does not make any sense whatsoever, or does it, no it does not.. Ladies and Gentlemen I give you The Papercut Chronicles."
