It's my life i'm holding the dice don't intervene. I send a team to smash out your whole plans. No cold hands liquid or hunger to hold grands. From state bids to large cats who lace cribs. It's Firm Biz, y'all know what time it is. Chorus: Dawn Robinson. I'm talking Firm Biz to you baby (Firm Firm Biz). Talking bout the Firm, that is (Firm Firm Biz). I'm talking Firm Biz to you baby (Firm Firm Biz). Talking bout the Firm, that is that is. That is that is Firm Biz!. Verse Two: Nas Escobar. Peep the stee, creepin with AZ. B-12's crazy I ball with the firm's first lady. I brawl with those who hate me. Make me spray I all; hoping for the day I fall. Never that though Black 4 4's for fedz. Like Donnie Brascoe so peep the cappos. Who mack most splash it up with lactose. Pretty thug style, I blow you out slug style. Bent in the Caddy Coupe me and daddy duke. He schooled me on how to stand on my own two. He said son it's all kinda shit you gon' go through. Either you gon' make it or you gon' fall too. Now we headline tours remember me I told you that the world was yours. Married to the Firm laws. Esco bless flows y'all know me. Laced in the Sony Firm be the hottest click to blow G. Chorus. Verse Three: Foxy Brown. My pops uesd to warn me never fall victim to the horny. Keep the pussy tight stay that bitch. If i'm gon' fuck lay that dick. Tony get him for his chips and pray he push a six. Now I got game to make the thuggish niggas scream my name. Hope the panties drop only if I cop. The baby blue drop gotta keep my wrist iced. The baddest bitch yeah the sex is alright. Lace 'em all night going to the crib. Jumping out the range in the iceberg tights. Yeah I know about the five and its one shut eye. 360 wave spinning cat thinkin he Nas. From now 'til the day we shinin keep my diamond. Esco with me in the E reclining top dogs. The illest duo since the Boss name was Hugo. AZ Firm trio stay on the lee low. (Chorus with modifications)."

In the club buying out kris, pour us a little bit. I told y’all that my borough is thorough. I know niggas that’ll clap you up and bury the metal. Same day we still in the hood. So ghetto, Brooklon, holla back get your crook on. Live from the 718 we raise the 8. Everytime papi raise the price of that weight. HOOK. Lemme tell you where I grew up at. Sip mo’ threw up at.

Niggas is outta jail but they still locked up. Them feds taking flicks so we pulling the drops up. BK open up get popped up. You know it’s the borough where cats drive with the box in they trucks.

bk made me,"Guiding, a dream. It's where, we always meet. I'm guiding, a dream. It's where, we alway meet. [Verse One]. Got dreams of ending this bitch, My life is miserable. Make me end this shit, find my ass in critical. No, My nightmares come frequent like they rituals. But my words come swift, divine like the Pennicle. See, that's why I rock my shades, so when I cry. And my eyes are red, I can still hide my pain. Then I step on stage and, crowd is in a rage and. I make the first page and, my mission's complete. But when I step off of stage, it's back to reality. Problems still the same, and life's a fuckin' tragedy. Thoughts still the same and, I still dream of dying and. Taking some hard shit, to make me feel I'm flying and. Wish I was told I was carried as low. In this cold fuckin' world, I wanna fuckin' explode. Guess it's time for me to depart, know it sounds strange. But I served my purpose, and I made my mark. Cause.... [Repeat Hook]. [Verse Two]. As long as the streets know it's a classic. Fluck all y'all envious bastards. I'm thorough when I'm, reppin' my borough nigga. Know tell me who could fuck wit', y'all put y'all money it. I make examples out of bitches, y'all don't really want it. Since Ill Na Na, I've been going through drama. And I get on my knees. And I thank, God for my momma. Since a youngin I been knowin', I be forever flowin'. Back in the lab biatch, back in my zone. No, thou shall not fuck with F to the Izz O. Bullshit aside, I got y'all rappers by a lanslide. Pardon me, I'm not your average, I'm a savage. When it come to this game, I'm as ill as my name. So Gav and Ant brought me back, I was sick of this rap. Sick of the fame, sick of niggas hauling my name. No, I cant quit. I'm as real as they get. Yes, back on the scene. Still reps no press. Cause.... [Repeat Hook]. [Verse 3]. Death before dishonor. Born alone, die alone. My crew think I'm 7, bought a plane so I could fly alone. No security, got the nine through the stallion. Run through Louie, when I wanna get my style on. Body something, get the chair and I'll fry alone. The skylarking, six be moonwalking. No, who keeps a floss game like Fox and Pretty. In Kennedy with twenty Louie's like Akeim and Simmi. No, nobody grinning, don't take it as rude. I was a little too gangsta for the Moulin Rouge. Cause.... [Repeat Hook Until End]"

From the windy city to the streets in Cali. To them streets in Houston. My niggas always boostin'. Some bitches always holla. How they don't spend a dolla. But that's because they ain't got it. Now tell me where's the logic. And if I talk it - I've done did it or about to do it. I'm making anthems, got a million niggas bouncin' to it. Bust your guns!.

See at times I think y'all bitches be confusing me. Like I'm somethin' sweet, shorty I'm still street. You're not on my level, and I won't stoop. And I'm the one that got you, kicked out your own group. Chicks be always thinkin' that I'mma let it ride. I might not kill you but I'll hurt you till your dead inside. Third album and you still wanna test Brown. I'm so hood bitches know how boogie get down. It could be real drama. It's still the Ill Na Na. There ain't a bitch wilda. Any beef? Holla!. They say I'm 730, say I spaz out. FB is ill, she'll wild out. But can y'all feel my pain?. I can't let it slide. How could I smile when I'm hurtin' so bad inside?. They say I'm 730, say I spaz out. FB is ill, she'll wild out. But can y'all feel my pain?. I can't let it slide. How could I smile when I'm hurtin' so bad inside?."

Make me end this shit, find my ass in critical. No, My nightmares come frequent like they rituals. But my words come swift, divine like the Pennicle. See, that's why I rock my shades, so when I cry. And my eyes are red, I can still hide my pain. Then I step on stage and, crowd is in a rage and. I make the first page and, my mission's complete. But when I step off of stage, it's back to reality. Problems still the same, and life's a fuckin' tragedy. Thoughts still the same and, I still dream of dying and. Taking some hard shit, to make me feel I'm flying and. Wish I was told I was carried as low. In this cold fuckin' world, I wanna fuckin' explode. Guess it's time for me to depart, know it sounds strange. But I served my purpose, and I made my mark. Cause.... [Repeat Hook]. [Verse Two]. As long as the streets know it's a classic. Fluck all y'all envious bastards. I'm thorough when I'm, reppin' my borough nigga. Know tell me who could fuck wit', y'all put y'all money it. I make examples out of bitches, y'all don't really want it. Since Ill Na Na, I've been going through drama. And I get on my knees. And I thank, God for my momma. Since a youngin I been knowin', I be forever flowin'. Back in the lab biatch, back in my zone. No, thou shall not fuck with F to the Izz O. Bullshit aside, I got y'all rappers by a lanslide. Pardon me, I'm not your average, I'm a savage. When it come to this game, I'm as ill as my name. So Gav and Ant brought me back, I was sick of this rap. Sick of the fame, sick of niggas hauling my name. No, I cant quit. I'm as real as they get. Yes, back on the scene. Still reps no press. Cause.... [Repeat Hook]. [Verse 3]. Death before dishonor. Born alone, die alone. My crew think I'm 7, bought a plane so I could fly alone. No security, got the nine through the stallion. Run through Louie, when I wanna get my style on. Body something, get the chair and I'll fry alone. The skylarking, six be moonwalking. No, who keeps a floss game like Fox and Pretty. In Kennedy with twenty Louie's like Akeim and Simmi. No, nobody grinning, don't take it as rude. I was a little too gangsta for the Moulin Rouge. Cause.... [Repeat Hook Until End]"

Donâ€™t start no shit tonight. You know them gangsta Brooklyn niggas is quick to fight. But we 'bout our dough - you know how that go. You know Brown come through with the hot ass flow. And go straight at them, quickly go platinum. Still cocky, wrist still rocky. Real chunky niggas still want me. Still touring and shopping in every country. Fox, Pooh and Pretty run this city.

Dropping 12th Ward B's on 'em. Bitch I'm loaded so don't ask me about no motherfucking weed aroma. Yeah I'm Grammy nominated. When the 'Lou says James Brown ain't been this animated.

The same way I ball I could quickly fall. But nah, Iâ€™m still here, till I retire. With them chrome things filling my tires. To my niggas in the slammer, with yâ€™all stiff hammer. Ainâ€™t nothing change, titties still bananas. Still slim, still the prettiest rap broad. No bra, nipples still hard. Yeah La Pearla strings and Belvedere.

broken silence,"[Foxy Brown speaking]. The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?. The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?. When the wicked came against me to eat up my flesh. My enemies and foes, they stumbled and fell. Though an army may encamp against me. My heart shall not fear. Though war may rise against me. In this I will be confident. [Darius]. I will survive. [Chorus]. Take, these broken wings (these broken wings). And let them fly again. And let them live so free (you taught me how to fly, fly). When we hear, the voices sing. The book of love will open up, and let us in. [Foxy Brown]. Feel like I've got this black cloud hangin' over me. It's like this pain is takin' control of me. Every move I make, determines my fate. Feel like I'm dying slow, and that's the shit I hate. The constant pressure, the bullshit rumors. The outcast, I'm the one they love to badge. When the records stop sellin'. And the crowds stop yellin'. All I have is me. Bet you thought I'd die without you. But see how I'm still living. Thought that I would self destruct. But I'm still here, with another one. Even though I felt crumbled, I made it through the rumble. Torn apart, a young woman scorned. Coping with the pain, nearly drove me insane. In the hospital, crying in the pain. All types of medications, flowing through my veins. [Chorus: Darius]. Take, these broken wings (these, broken, wings). And let them fly again. And let them live so free. When we hear, the voices sing (I will learn, I will learn, how to fly). The book of love will open up, and let us in. [Foxy Brown]. Please, understand I'm a human first. And before Foxy Brown, I'm just still Inga. And my family, is my whole life. And I cherish this ring that you put on my finger. We survived through the roughest stones. Sleeping with our baby pit bull on the basement floors. And through it all, you and I felt we could be strong. All through the rough times, through the pains and storms. And, it's like when it rains, it pours. All they see is gray and blue, they don't know you like I do. Five years committed, y'all just don't understand. No career, no fame, meant more than my man. And, to my fans that slept through it all. Through the rise and the fall, I love y'all all. Even when I nearly lost my mind. Some remained loyal, ignored the headlines and. [Chorus: Darius]. Take, these broken wings (take, these broken wings). And let them fly again. And let them live so free (let em fly, let em fly). When we hear, the voices sing (voices sing). The book of love will open up, and let us in. [Foxy Brown]. Story of my legacy, this can't be life. Lord, I feel like I'm fallin'. Praying for strength, I'm losing my mind. And, how can you fly when your wings are broken?. And, how can I smile when my heart is broken?. Through all the pain I've felt, that's the hand I'm dealt. My personal problem, stays in my home. Know I won't discuss them, reporters I don't trust 'em. [Chorus: Darius]. Take, these broken wings (these broken wings). And let them fly again. And let them live so free (I wanna see them fly). When we hear, the voices sing. The book of love will open up, and let us in. Take, these broken wings (take these broken wings). And let them fly again (oohh). And let them live so free (let them live so free, so free). When we hear, the voices sing (yeahh). The book of love will open up, and let us in. [Darius]. Teach me how to fly. (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh). Teach me how to fly. I believe, in the power, of love. (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh). Can't you hear me, don't you hear me?. (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh). I'm calling out to you. Foxy help me sing. (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh). These broken wings. *fades*."
broken silence (intro),"[News Reporters Speaking]. ""Rapper Foxy Brown was arrested today in Raleigh, North Carolina on. misdemeaner charges for an alledged altercation with a hotel employee.. She was arrested and released on a thousand dollar bond but if found. guilty of the charge, she could face up to sixty days in prison."". ""Gun fire erupted today outside a Greenwich Village radio station. The. gunplay allegedly stems from an ungoing feud... both artists claim no. involvement in the incident. No arrests have yet been made in. connection with the shooting."". ""In other news, rap artist Foxy Brown was hospitalized yesterday after. an apparent overdose on a common prescription drug. While the overdose. was allegedly an atempt at her own life, no one from the hospital nor. Foxy's family were available for comment. Stay tuned for more news"". ""Inga Marchand, also known as rapper Foxy Brown, was taken to a local. hospital today, when the Range Rover she was driving spun out of. control at a Brooklyn sidestreet. Although she was not seriously. injured, Marchand was later arrested for driving with a suspended. liscense. This is just another in a long list of offences that have. plagued this Brooklyn rap star."". [Foxy Brown]. Yeah, you know its been a long time since y'all heard my voice. Maybe what, 2, 3, years or somethin. Up and down been high and low. Even been at the point of no return, no hope. Just wanna let my fans know that I'm still here. Y'all holla back. The sound was broken, too many years being political. Its kinda hard to do when everything your seeing is critical. Is all my fault what they said in the news. But its funny how the public seems to get it confused. They act like they aint got nothin better to do. All they want is a statement, the hattin is blatin. But we never paid attention to those who hate us. Til my face was on the cover of all the local papers. But still un-phased, I kept my cool. Plottin, carefully, every step I choose. And my, Cool-whit poin, and my write finery. Everybody wanna know my side of the story. Well here it is, the whole truth, plain and simple. This'll finally explain all the pain I've been through. And in no way shape or form of my provoken violence. Please try to understand my ""Broken Silence""."

Let me explain how I maintain thresholds to pain. I walk across the Sun barefoot lookin for shade. I rearrange your rib cage like a twelve gauge at close range. and change the position of your brain. My hard raps penetrate through your hardhats and all that. nigga, get ya wig peeled back. I scalp you like the indians on horseback. Running Bull will hit you harder than runningback. Stunning man with brave and cunning rap. Swiftly running laps around 48 tracks. Like uncut crack you fiends keep coming back. Heads is flippin like acrobats on gym mats. From wax to analog tapes to digital DAT's. It's critical black, that Canibus is ill like that. In fact perhaps you should quit rap, instead of always. tryin to diss back, cause niggaz keep tellin you that your shit's wack. I rip raps, hardcore raps rushin you to the floor mat. Put you in the figure four, break your thorax. Jump off the top turnbuckle and land on your back. til I hear it snap or crackle, the ref says chill black. You get clapped bringin the wrong raps to combat. Like bringin a paint gun to a shoot out with real gats. Y'all niggaz is wack, rappin over microphone feedback. My intelligence begins where yours peaks at. From Fox Boogie in the see-through brasierre, to Nasty Nas here. My nigga Nature'll explain it further if it's not clear. [Nas and Foxy Brown]. Millionaire look at the sky make sure it's still there. Ice grill stares and my jewelry is in every year. Pierre Cardan back in a Dapper Dan time. Now flex, angle wrecks, Foxy rock Van Klein. [Nas Escobar]. Initiated to the Firm shit, real thugs learn quick. Sit back and feel the ultimate hit. Initiated to the Firm shit, real thugs learn quick. Sit back and feel the ultimate hit. [AZ the Visualiza]. Yo lock in, do the knowledge, follow the doctrine. We clockin, on your airwaves, keepin it rockin. Blaze up, make fire, light your Purple Haze up. Betcha tired, bitch ass niggaz need to be caged up. So raise up fuck the playin, I'm sick of layin. I can picture sprayin off an SK, shells ricochetin. Snatched up, in Supreme Court, eyes half shut. Co-defendant caught a life sentence, seem him crack up. React what, who will, bail two mill'. Nigga cool still bet I'll be home before the news will. Blast fuse and leave purple Frank Matthews. Perhaps you confuse the concept black, cash rules. Incog-ged, another had more deez involved. Known freeze condo seize seven keys dissolved. Daily routine, speakin up for niggaz who sling. Hand to hand on them street corners claimin you king. It's time to lock this, join with us, let your glock spit. Guzzle the toxic, only fake niggaz drop snitch. Get your guns out, it don't take much for me to dumb out. Play one route, lay ya shit down and run South. [Nature]. Here's the cause of this shit, more statistics. Deeper than the laws of physics, Malibu sand ,the gorgeous bitches. Weed from 1-2-5, my whole crew live. A true Desperado, one that never choose sides. and show sympathy, just QB, an entity. Stock exchange, top of the game, watch you mention me. Image is nothin just obey your thirst. I blaze the Purple Haze, sit in a daze, then display your birth. For those concerned or just eager to learn. I speak for The Firm, was told to keep the cheeba to burn. Stashin my riches, past traditions, like Olympics. pass the torch flip shit so y'all could picture my thoughts, I'm driftin. It's type ill wakin up lookin like filth. Twenty years younger same hunger same ice grill. Genetically form grade A pedigree. Born to carve rhymes, a swift tongue helped to set it free. Theoretically peep how we bless this, young and restless. Guns and westins, learnin to connect through lessons. From cool feats to camps, niggaz shoot back. It's a proven fact, nine-seven's mine, y'all niggaz move back. Chorus."

Mentally I'm in my own zone holding my spot. Fox, basically I'm the female Pac. And it's like my life is a thesis. Sometimes I feel like I'm talking Swedish. Y'all niggas don't get it. And me I'm balling, the streets keep calling. Lord take my soul I feel like I'm falling. [Young Gavin]. Don't hate me cause I'm ballin'. Lord take me if I'm fallin'. I think I hear them callin' me.

Ain't No...gold. Total...500,000 sold. Ill Nana...2.8. The Firm...another mil. Then Chyna Doll came, it's pretty much the same. And anything we rap about you see us do.

firm fiasco,"Verse One: Nas Escobar, AZ the Vizuliza. As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be in the Firm. I can remember when I first met Sosa, it was a glorious time. There were wise guys everywhere, we were around. Twenty one, twenty two at the time. Yeah every place we go, every party. People would stop and stare when we walked in. We would give the doorman a hundred dollars just for opening the door. Sosa would give the bartender two hundred dollars just for keeping. The ice cold, yeah we were legends and we still are. Two hundred fallen angels, we balling from every angle. Heavy bag gold, panamania changed angle. Let's tangle, tabernacles. Ill lukiens coming at you, fuck Parus. A billion years B.C., originally black Jews. Cashsews honey now roasted, let's kill the colprate. He owe us shit, toe toe toe with that four four bit. Fuck the hoe shit, mercury back tax ?birth? for me. Personally I existed when Earth was in need, indeed. Human lifeform transformed from light storms, poltrons. Electrons nuetrons, iced long. Nights long, repltilaians I'll see ya'll in the next millenium. What world are we really in, amphibians moved to the Carribean. Underwater force, placed under the court of law. Usually sport Warlaw, my mind stay core raw. Fill of ambiants, love fine carats and cars that launch. Nonchalaunt, usually there are Jimmies up in the palms. Play low style, Guteians change my whole profile. Left the dope pile, bet the guard be around for awhile. Firm Islamic, hit the croner of the Earth just like a comet. Verse Two: AZ the Vizuliza, Nas Escobar. See I like Esco, he knew everybody and everybody knew him. He was the type of guy who routed for the bad guys in the movies. But hey. Die for this Firm, live for this Firm. Niggas learn, never should come before your fam. From ki's to ported grams, these are corners in the blue van. E's upon on us, cause of warrants. While we smoke hash cheese enormous, stack cheese. Travel the world like Taurus, went half with Sosa for four bricks. Down in Camdon, we handlin' to D.C.. Chips on fights with China White's by they tight PP. Wanting PC but all they get is good dick or four clips. For loose lips, by the jungle flise. Suck the pearl tongue juices, off you fly misses. Take her out to the Spark's stakehouse, gentelmen style. Coincidental, family's here. Meet fem fatale, French connection. Persian wet don, let's get this ""F"" on. The Ebony queen, Fox you grab my left arm. Dre made a QB the conton, BK and so on. Family strong ???? Nature, make sure we all get this millionaire's paper. What a sweet site for sour eyes, may we rise. Hope for now on we never cross sides. Veres Three: Foxy Brown. You know what, most hoes would have left these cats a long time ago. I mean if your man gave you a gun to hide, what would ya'll hoes do?. But you know, the shit kinda turned me on. Black Madonna, hoes kill for they popals. Never seen a bitch like this, queen misses. Rock BDS's on the left wrists, trick check this. Respect this, Firm's niggas lie knee deep in this bitch. Wanna need bitch and have my pussy bleed, swear for 'em. Fuck and take the chair for 'em, whoever dare cross us. The thoughts that thoughts across a bitch's minds, pops the nine. Leave 'em resting in peices, while my thorough bitches peep this.

Bitch to hold the cash and G's, stash the guns for 'em. And the icedy E Berkee, breathe the the sun for 'em. Long dick style, swallow the enemies cum for 'em.

Gotta get you home with me tonight. Right here. Verse Three: Foxy Brown. Grabbed me by the hand and led the way. Outside of the club talkin to Valet. Mind started to stray, million miles away. Contemplatin goin back to his crib to par-lay. Jumped in the passenger seat, relaxed my feet. As he threw on Blacksteet casually. And we cruised the metro, on premium petrol. I sized up my thighs and couldn't let go. Ta-Ta's perkin, You're Makin Me High. like Toni, work me, take me I'm hot. I thought for a second and then my mind went. Sex all around the car, isn't it ironic?. Back to Reality, the Soul II Soul. Breathin heavily but still in control. Wants the shy girl role, put my hand on his lef. With sex in his eyes, he turned and then he said. Chorus: Blackstreet. Tonight baby. Ooooooh baby, c'mon c'mon Foxy c'mon. Gotta get you home with me tonight. Whatever you want me to do (uh-oh, uh-oh). Ooooooh baby, do it for you baby. I need it in my life. Gotta get you home with me tonight. Ayyaiiayy, ooooooh baby, gotta get you home tonight. Gotta get you home with me tonight. *etc.*."

Close your eyes as you ride, right out your socks. Double, lose his mind as he grind in the tunnel. Wanna gimme the cash he made off his last bundle. Nasty-girl don't pass me the world. I push to be not the backseat girl. Don't deep throat the C-note she float. Murder she wrote, and keeps the heat close. Firm nigga, we 'posed to be the illest on three coasts.

I ain't playin knockin out at the Williams. I'm sayin, what's the sense in delayin. I'm tryin to run G from the P to the A.M.. I saw your little thing now I'm swayin, Ok'in. (ahh, shit... uh, uh).

Tryin to do my thing y'all, need you on my team. But you aint gon' stop my dream, or block my cream. I liked things better when you called me Ings. A year before Rap City, way before Screen Scene. 'Fore they knew who Foxy was, you probably was. The first to keep it real wit all my secrets concealed. Things got ill the minute I got a deal. And my time got shorter and you was havin a daughter. Had to stop hopscotch, get off my rump. Damn I wish we were still playin jump. Chorus: repeat 2X. If I could take this back I would. If I could rewind the time to when it was all good. I would, take it back to when we said good-bye. If I.... My so-called man thinkin he slick cause I stay on tour. Thought he'd never get caught tryin to play on whores. I cried as my keys was scrapin the car doors. From the trunk, to the hood, by the wheel and the floor. Exposed my vulnerable side, had me open wide. Said you forever keep it real, but you lied. Was the first to feel inside, the Ill Na Na. Had me thirst when you whispered to me, ""How it feel mama?"". Yeah, but don't hurt it, I like the way you work it. No Diggity, don't stop get busy. Blew up your pager, checked your clothes. Duked your house keys, stole your beeper code. What happened to the Mo's and the occasional roses. Massages and the bubble baths, rubbin my toes as. I realize you was just misleadin me. I shoulda known, you left your last chick to be with me. Chorus. Mommy dearest tried to prepare us for a lot ahead. You never heard, preferred to smoke your lye instead. On the one to one combo told me you'd die for bread. That's why I spend these nights, cryin in the bed. You had the deep dish six, your rep was widespread. I tried to intervene you said it was over my head. Said I'd never understand the plight of a black man. Right, but I'm tryin to keep you in my life. V.I.A. satellite, talkin them burn outs. Soon you had me whylin and you turned me out. Taught me bout how to win, the code of the streets. Luxuries and wealth untold it was sweet. And one night you asleep after work was chopped up. Felt somethin strange in my veins, I popped up. One foot in the house shoot flew to the horn. Got the cell operator, I knew you was gone. Chorus 1.5X."

Status Illmatic, whatever raw dealer for real-a. Baby girl, yet it's La Familia. I die in a minute for 'em, so side dipped. The four poin six range rover the feelin' over. From Castilano to Columbo, easy the Genevezy. Firm stay jigged in trash and pass, I swear. You know the lose there, straight cop threes. Can't knock thees and drop threes, we cop cheese. Verse Two: Nature. Peace and diagnosis, properly supply the dosage. Leave them stuck like parol niggaz and breathes the focus. Nigga when I squeeze ya pleads is hopeless, we wet though. I jet from the block, niggaz can spot me like UFO's. Dressed the low, jumped in the Q front for who?. No need to stress it though, smokin' my dope countin' decimals. Recognize this, real thugs respect violence. The 1-9-9-6, some are rather dry snitch. Coruptfully, my whole team recieve ???? to be. Some are spare guns, shootin' fair ones in the public streets. Believe the worst, so it seems the whole team is cursed. We totured, drain the whole heat and squeeze first. Never ending tales, when niggaz fall but some prevail. They fake, callin' us together like four Navy war seals. Must I start pullin' jooks or place my trust in God. Force to cover my face, cameras held the case can solve. Ya faith disolves when hump against the next coming. For now I focus on Nature, bet I win something. Verse Three: Nas Escobar. I die for my niggaz, stick you for pies and lie for my niggaz. Plead guilty and get the chair and fry for my niggaz. It's essential that we all is there like ya mental. We've been through life, cold blood living simple. Though we learned from old dogs that made it, peeped who they played it. We rated and then evaluated, calculated age is weepy. The days that we see chips freely, beyond whips and TVs. Stock bonds, Lou flipped the CDs. Niggaz hate to see you on top, they'd rather be you what not. I keep the dessert evil poncot, spot the Vickidees guy quick. While poppin' shit that leave ya shot quicker than a hop skip. Specialize in fly shit, bs on my breath while niggaz gossip. On the tostic, I'm on some doe or die shit. Verse Forus: Az the Vizuliza. Check my lingo and all the white ice that make my rings glow. I've seen doe, got a dime wife who Sandimingo. Face it it's mathematics, basics far from fake shit. My mind is sacred, my spins shine like a cuban braclet. Egyptian pharoah, roll the coke that used to give me powder. Now I enhale from ???? buckshots through my double barrel. Beneath the town is how it's sounds travels, so what have you?. Keep minds bests, never stopping until they grab you. Used to bust shit down wit' test stocks and trust funds. Cheese and CDs so my seed can so touch some, the foulness. I once provoked is now behind me, it gonna take more than sellin' coke. To now to bind me, you had me thinkin' I got to push leek. To keep from sinking, that can out way life. That keep live niggaz from linkin', I saw it coming. That's why slowed down from from dumbin', most of my crew was runnin'. Can't even afford a summons."

Ill Na Na and Def Jam is backin' it. Feel my words, I'm oh so passionate. They like to hear me talk greasy. Bitches stay shook in my presence, they walk easy. Acting all thirsty, hope they not irk me. Tits are still perky, skin is still hershy. Yes, I'm well known to flip fast. Yes, I still shop on Fifth Ave. We toured out, that's what we all bout.

my life,"[Intro]. (Nigga, uh). Yeah, huh (nigga uh). Why don't ya'll take a look into my life?. See what I see. (Nigga uh, nigga, nigga, nigga uh). At the age of fourteen, introduce to coops. Learnin' how to seduce niggaz takin' they loot. Quickly, got involved with this money lifestyle. The finer things, all kinda things, power, money. Cars and diamond rings, and nice braids, flaunt it. The Gucci boots with the G's on it. A high price for this 'high price' life. While I'm on tour is my man cheatin' just for spite?. And if you only knew I hold my minks at nights with cheap. Or no other hands can hold me right. My girls ain't the same, guess it's cuz the fame. Bitches smile in my face and throw dirt on my name. Mad cuz I made it, now friends intimidated. Hate it that I'm in the same game as them. With mo' fame than them, they know who they are. This life is no joke, got us havin' to broke. You was my sister, who used to dream together. How we could make it real big, do our thing together. Huh, Thelma & Louise together, remember them days?. Them niggas we played? Now we don't even speak. Went our seperate ways, seperate lives. Lost friendship for pride, playin' the game. About to forfeit high price life, I can't afford it. 1 - My life, do ya feel what I feel?. My life, a black girl's ordeal my life. Do ya see what I see?. Have you been where I've been?. Can you go where I go?. My life. Do ya'll know what it feels like?. Do ya'll know what it be like?. Do ya see what I see?. Have you been where I've been?. Can you go where I go?. Daddy's girl, in his wildest dreams. Said he think that lil' Ing will be illest in this rap-thing. Age 4 in my mother's shoes, swore I could sing. And even as a little girl I was doin' my thing. Uh, confused, I ain't asked to be born. Nigga so dumb, shoulda used a condom. Ask mommy every day, when daddy gon' come?. But he never showed up. I would pimp for them, became demented, then men?. Resented them, just the scent of 'em made me earl. 'Specially the baller ones tryin' to buy me with pearls. All I needed was love, all I wanted was love. Lack of love had me fallin' for thugs. The niggas who ain't care, just like Daddy. If he ain't care, why should they?. For this 'high price' life, it's the price I pay. Repeat 1. All my girls cross the world that feel what I feel. Hearts bruised, then been way I been, keep it movin'. Let him do his thing, I'm the one he's lovin'. I'm here to show ya'll, havin' a kid ain't meanin' nuthin'. That ain't keepin' him, 'specially if he in love with another chick. Then you stuck with the 'babymother-shit'. Don't be lovin' niggas more than yaself. Let 'em roam, a dog always finds his way home. Shit, ya'll don't wanna take my place, cashin' cases. Spit in faces, I never seem falsely accused. While some say it's rude. But if I was a dude, they all be amused. But I'm a woman, so I'm a bitch, simple as that. Double-standards, call him a Mack, call me a hoe. Say I'm in it for the dough, but tell me. What tha fuck he in it for?. Wanted it all, now it's all mine. Loneliness, sorrow, confusion and pain. Nightmares, headlines, ""Rapper found slain"". If it wasn't for my moms I'd drown in this pain. Now ya'll see what it's like, ya'll don't wanna be me. Cuz it ain't always what it seem on TV. Shit, but this is my '9 to 5' ya'll. Sometimes I wanna slit my wrist and end my life ya'll. Repeat 1 until fade."

now i lay me down to sleep,"Hey...Yo Gav I'm wide awoke, fam. Fox... [VERSE 1]. Am I the most prolific. Can it be that I'm one of the most gifted. I swear at times I'm so twisted. Outta all the occupations in the world I chose this shit. Momma, tell me, do I have what it takes to be. Irreplacably the best this place will see. And yes I'm hated. And will I go down in history as one of the most underestimated. Lord, speak to me, are these streets the key?. We don't snitch, we been sworn to secrecy. I never claimed I shot guys. I just came in the game to get my name and rep Fox 5. I'm so close yet so far but so far. No stars flow hard like I do. So many years you been lied to. I now provide you with the closest thing to rap's bible. [CHORUS]. (Now I lay me down to sleep) Oh lord. (I pray the lord my soul 2 keep). Yes, so may years you been lied to. I now provide you with the closest thng to rap's bible. (If I should die before I awake) Oh lord. (I pray the lord my soul to take). Fox...I gotta get my rhyme on. And everything I speak my mind on be word to Big. [VERSE 2]. The industry lately's been terrible. I swear the timing's impeccable. Labels is bringin' in thin revenue. I don't mean to toot my own horn bt damn, I'm incredible. See I gots to be...possibly. If not the best, yeah, fuck it the best MC. And I feel they testin' me now. I don't need Kelly or Beyonce to prove I'm Destiny's Child. Thin I'm losin' y'all, confusin' y'all. When I spit all I hear is ""ooh's"" and ""aww's"". And I don't need doubt. See it's just me, Red, Gav, Curtains, Mello & Young Mouse. A small portion of a dyin' breed. It's Fox-5 slash I-N-E but still. So many years you been lied to. I now provide you with the closest thing to rap's bible. [CHORUS]. (Now I lay me down to sleep) Oh lord. (I pray the lord my soul to keep). Yes, so may years you been lied to. I now provide you with the closest thing to rap's bible. (If I should die before I awake) Oh God. (I pray the lord my soul to take). Fox...I gotta get my rhyme on. And everything I speak my mind on be word to Pac. . [VERSE 3]. See, it's the streets that inspire me. This is my proof of what fire be. My songs will please the inquiry. My versatile personal flows written and shittin', it's like diaries. Never tired my job, I confide in God. And almost effortless simply defy the odds. With the best the placin'. Will I be able to succeed and lyrically exceed my expectations. If I gain some fame, I'll remain the same. It's so ill how one bitch changed the game. And I'mma do it a lot faster. I probly have to die before they realize I was the best rapper. Young Fox, I'm a spittin' beast. This rap game's a puzzle, I'm the missin' piece. But...so many years you been lied to. I now provide you with the closest thing to rap's bible. [CHORUS]. (Now I lay me down to sleep) Oh lord. (I pray the lord my soul to keep). Yes, so may years you been lied to. I now provide you with the closest thing to rap's bible. (If I should die before I awake)Oh God. (I pray the lord my soul to take). Fox...I gotta get my rhyme on. And everything I speak my mind on be word to Pac. Lord, this fever is so crazy, man. I mean...everything I speak my mind on be word to Pac, yes. Oh God"

the letter,"[Ron Isley]. *shimmering memories.. up in the studio gettin low*. *listening... it's the realest shit I've ever wrote*. This is a letter. From Inga. To my mother, and my brothers, and my baby. [Foxy Brown]. Dear Mommy, I apologize. I know it's because of me that your life is traumatized (and). it's cause of me that at times you wanna die. But you was always there when your little Na Na cried (and). When the media said Foxy's ill. You was there when this fame almost got me killed. When I was in the hospital, could not be still. Only you knew the reasons why I popped these pills. And to my friends I love them and I know they care. But, time after time, you was always there. When I did the Vibe cover, holdin my crotch. I was wailin, while you prayed for me hopin I'll stop. Sorry for the times I didn't tell the truth. And I'm sorry for the times when I yelled at you. I love you mommy, sorry that's happened. Please pass the letter to Gavin. [Ron Isley]. *shimmering memories.. up in the studio gettin low*. *listening... it's the realest shit I've ever wrote*. This is a letter. From Inga. To my mother, and my brothers, and my baby. Ah yea oh oh oh yea... [Foxy Brown]. Gavin, dang, where do I start. You knew it all, you was there from the start. My cold deed the ear to my heart. Just writing this tears me apart (see). Seemed like yesterday when I signed my deal. Brought the Benz, and put you behind the wheel. I wanted you to know that I did it for us. And I wanted you to know I was committed to us. And of course the long way, we had our disputes. You didn't care for some of the things that I would do. But you still watched my back, complete and the same. You're the one that used to school me, and teach me the game (see). Whether I'm here, or dead in a box. Keep my name alive, you know no bitch is better than Fox. I love you, tell ma I'll never forget her. Let Ant read the rest of the letter. [Ron Isley]. *shimmering memories.. up in the studio gettin low*. *listening... it's the realest shit I've ever wrote*. This is a letter. To my mother, and my brothers, and my baby. Ohhh I love you yeaaah. [Foxy Brown]. Anton, don't let this letter get you down. Dagg, I hope I didn't let you down. I made my mistakes. I was young in the mind. But you gotta admit, I was one of a kind. Remember Miami when you fought my man. Can't imagine how mentally lost I am (*memories*). Never knew life could be so painful. Tell daddy I love him, and I'm still his little angel. I'm all cried out, I feel like I wanna go. Can't take this no more. I want my life like it was before. My life so raw. Love you Ant but I can't write no more. [Ron Isley]. Ohhh come on come back home. Memories, Memories... Ohh I'm so sorry. I want my lover. Yeaaa this is my letter. To my mother,. and my brothers,. and my baby. My my my baby. Please, listen. Listen to me. Oh somebody listen. Listen to me. Come on home. Rarararararara. Memories.... Oh I love my mother. And my brother. But what about my baby. Oh my baby. Listen to me listen. Keep the family. Come back home to me. Oooohhhh... My letter. My letter... Listen....."
