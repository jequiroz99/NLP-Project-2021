Seems like we're arguin' more and it's getting less romantic. Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon. But I'll f**k you right I will, I'll f**k you right I will. I'll f**k you like no one has ever ever made you feel. I mean, this part of our relationship's amazing still. I might just put up with the arguin' and stay for real. You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes. You with all those curves, and me without no brakes. Ooh, I'm willin' to work it out however longer how it takes. You feel like you missed out on those happy days. Well, girl that makes two of us. Our timing is wrong. Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone. Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my Mrs.. And the hardest part about the f**kin' business is minding your own. And every time I try and break it off. We just yell until we're tired, then I break you off. It's useless, all this fighting, let's get past it now. Even when I throw them deuces, you just send ‘er back around. (T.I.). Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan. Ay, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again. I ju' keep on talking but I guess that you ain't listenin'. Rather run around with them nothin'-ass bitches, then. Go on, got me hot, smokin' like the chim-i-ney. We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies. Deep inside, it's killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you. To see her in that two-seater, no, that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo. Ah-ha, didn't you think you would be over me. By now, so you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief. She spoke her peace, I know, capisce, so love must be let go, released. Into the wind, begin again, them deuces I must throw ya, peace. (Kanye West). You know what, yo? You a b**ch. You should have a travel agent, 'cause you a trip. You should make your own toilet tissue, since you the shit. But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch. I hate (???), but I love your mom. Give her a kiss from me, her second son. Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together. You gon' be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever. Girl seducers, they come in deuces. But when I cut ‘em off, they always become a nuisance. Niggas take my old flows, and they take my old swag. He just took my old bitch, and turned it to his new bitch. I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on. What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on. Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth. So when y'all talk 'bout You Know Who, I don't know who you talkin' 'bout. (Fabolous). According to my old b**ch, I be on some new s**t. She was on some old s**t, now I got a new b**ch. Think I give two s**ts? You ain't gon' do s**t. Meet my two fingers, intro, deuces.

Know you gon' (miss me a little when I'm gone). (Fabolous). Drizzy voice. Now I'm ghost, baby, four-door Rizzy-Royce. Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice. I'm 'bout my business, boys, plus I make paper. C'mon, that's old news, yes, the day's paper. Ho, you talkin'? What about?. If it ain't how I kept you studded out, you might as well shut your mouth. You'll never score another me, I shut it out. Act like there's gum in your hair, girl, cut it out. (Andre 3000). The farewell email, from a female. But I'm a player, ain't gon' tell ya all the details. What it entails is hard to say like selling seashells. By the seashore, but she's not a bore. But neither a whore, who needs to know more?. The kind you can't ignore but want to open the door. For, or, run in your favorite store. And leave with all them shoppin' bags and half of it ain't yours. I did things for her, ain't rich, ain't poor. I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her. Well enough to know if this was all that she came for. But enough to know tonight, excited, she came four. Times, to my cousin house to see if I was there. Getcha minds, out the gutter, man, we out here tryna have a good. Time, and here I am all heavy with the word swear. Somebody that's a nerd likely fast-forward, but, shit, they asked for it. It's hard to throw up the deuces, 'cause when you know it's juicy.

Bruh man from the fifth floor. What would you do in the middle of the winter. When the sun goes down and it gets cold?. Growin' up in a house with no stove. No doors, no walls, no windows. And my brother was always fresher. I would go to school in his clothes, when I did go. So that's why now this the type of life that I live for. Comin' up as a youngin', man some nights I would vomit. I would throw up on myself cause I was so sick to my stomach. Now I'm the shit, fix the plumbing. Feel with my y'all, I'm this close. Spent my whole life chasin' shit, where's nabisco?.

With the soul of a soldier. But even still I don't want no parts. And no niggas with no hearts. You cocksuckers need yo guards. I'm throwed off for the most part. A young dog with an old bark. Flow dumb, but I'm so smart. I compose art, call me mozart. My nightlife's like a soap opera. With two chicks like I'm noah's ark. They got nice dresses with no bras with good bodies like ""oh god!"". From a poor child to on top like a mohawk. But I always new I'd go far. Like a gas truck with no bar. So no applause, hold the applause. Just put your hand up if you know the song. [Chris Brown]. If anybody feeling fresh in the building. Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now.

champion,"(Chris Brown:). Some people have to learn. Some people wait their turn. Some people have to fight. Some people give their lives.. (Chipmunk:). They wanna hold you back, tell'em pee off.

If they put you on a pedestal, they can take you off. And there's a higher level than the top. You gotta make more, don't do with what you got. Yeah, so get it in go sunny. Not everybody get a second chance at getting money. Or even getting lucky. So you gotta feel the hunger in your tummy.. (Chris Brown:). I'm always pushing myself to the limit.

Some people give their lives. Some people don't believe. I was born a champion. But I was born a champion. But I was born a champion. (Chipmunk:). No-one wants to help. I guess you're on your own.

Take em and let em go. (Chris Brown:). You made me who I am. From the words you said. Some people have to learn. Some people wait there turn. Some people but not me. I was born a champion.

"deuces (remix) (ft. drake, t.i., kanye west, fabolous and andre 3000)","(Drake). What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed. I'm waitin' in my hotel room. Seems like we're arguin' more and it's getting less romantic. Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon. But I'll f**k you right I will, I'll f**k you right I will. I'll f**k you like no one has ever ever made you feel. I mean, this part of our relationship's amazing still. I might just put up with the arguin' and stay for real. You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes. You with all those curves, and me without no brakes. Ooh, I'm willin' to work it out however longer how it takes. You feel like you missed out on those happy days. Well, girl that makes two of us. Our timing is wrong. Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone. Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my Mrs.. And the hardest part about the f**kin' business is minding your own. And every time I try and break it off. We just yell until we're tired, then I break you off. It's useless, all this fighting, let's get past it now. Even when I throw them deuces, you just send ‘er back around. (T.I.). Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan. Ay, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again. I ju' keep on talking but I guess that you ain't listenin'. Rather run around with them nothin'-ass bitches, then. Go on, got me hot, smokin' like the chim-i-ney. We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies. Deep inside, it's killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you. To see her in that two-seater, no, that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo. Ah-ha, didn't you think you would be over me. By now, so you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief. She spoke her peace, I know, capisce, so love must be let go, released. Into the wind, begin again, them deuces I must throw ya, peace. (Kanye West). You know what, yo? You a b**ch. You should have a travel agent, 'cause you a trip. You should make your own toilet tissue, since you the shit. But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch. I hate (???), but I love your mom. Give her a kiss from me, her second son. Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together. You gon' be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever. Girl seducers, they come in deuces. But when I cut ‘em off, they always become a nuisance. Niggas take my old flows, and they take my old swag. He just took my old bitch, and turned it to his new bitch. I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on. What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on. Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth. So when y'all talk 'bout You Know Who, I don't know who you talkin' 'bout. (Fabolous). According to my old b**ch, I be on some new s**t. She was on some old s**t, now I got a new b**ch. Think I give two s**ts? You ain't gon' do s**t. Meet my two fingers, intro, deuces. If you knew better, you'd do better. Wanna give the middle finger, but I got two better. (Chris Brown). So you gon' diss me even though you know it's wrong?. Know you gon' (miss me a little when I'm gone). (Fabolous). Drizzy voice. Now I'm ghost, baby, four-door Rizzy-Royce. Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice. I'm 'bout my business, boys, plus I make paper. C'mon, that's old news, yes, the day's paper. Ho, you talkin'? What about?. If it ain't how I kept you studded out, you might as well shut your mouth. You'll never score another me, I shut it out. Act like there's gum in your hair, girl, cut it out. (Andre 3000). The farewell email, from a female. But I'm a player, ain't gon' tell ya all the details. What it entails is hard to say like selling seashells. By the seashore, but she's not a bore. But neither a whore, who needs to know more?. The kind you can't ignore but want to open the door. For, or, run in your favorite store. And leave with all them shoppin' bags and half of it ain't yours. I did things for her, ain't rich, ain't poor. I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her. Well enough to know if this was all that she came for. But enough to know tonight, excited, she came four. Times, to my cousin house to see if I was there. Getcha minds, out the gutter, man, we out here tryna have a good. Time, and here I am all heavy with the word swear. Somebody that's a nerd likely fast-forward, but, shit, they asked for it. It's hard to throw up the deuces, 'cause when you know it's juicy. You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses. Chase cabooses 'til the track gone. I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs. (Chris Brown). I'm on some new shit. I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (Deuces). I'm movin' on to somethin' better, better, better. No more tryna make it work (Deuces). You make me wanna say, bye-bye. Say, bye-bye.

We the shit boiiii, so don't step in it.. I'm all about my stripes, like a veteran.. And it's getting too late, I need to take my medicine.. Ok, ok let me go.. Nigga be shining, this soul glow. [?]. Boy, look at all these diamonds,. And my chain so heavy, and my neck be rhyming. [?]. Can't see you, all I see is my shades.. Girl, got her giddy giddy, Frankie Lyeman.. I make her cum like clockwork.. What you call that? Perfect timing.. They call me Hercules.. Just like a slave, she working me.. Know she off that Bonnie, when she smoking and got them purple leaves.. 7-Eleven head, no hands when she slurping me.. Then she swallowed my sword, like a circus freak."

freed up,"When a bitch say she fucked 20 niggas. I respect her more. Instead of running 'round this motherfucker. lying all the time. Talking 'bout some. 5 niggas, 5 niggas you cared about, shit. [Verse 1]. Bitch you lying and girl I'm built honest. Still living for today, tomorrow ain't promised. Holding on to the love cause the hate follows. When you young, getting money, yeah you date models. Let the cork pop off when we shake bottles. You don't need a glass, girl just take swallows. Yeah, young and reckless, I spite her beverage. Self medicated, pills or liquor, what's your preference?. She usually ain't the type to take rejection. She don't know her dad so the hate turned into affection. She only dreamed to be up in my section. Believing any lie they tell her, just to get a necklace. Bitches keep playing games like it's checkers. But bitch this chess and those Dd's gon' be your blessing. I'm looking forward to all them text messages. Talking 'bout how you done. I love when bitches threaten me. [Hook]. I'mma keep it real with you baby. Understand me, don't tell you lies. I feel love is pretty but threatened. Too complicated, never willing to try. When I locked it down, she freed up. Coco and I know she loved the prenup. Now she changing niggas like the seasons. Got it good but I feel distant in my mind. can't help think I'm mastermind. [Verse 2]. She said follow me. she wanna fuck up a nigga's Valentine. Pardon me, only thing growing on me is the dollar signs. Oh baby, I'm only used to your ways. Say you in love and you ain't, try to be honest, you can't. You always tripping on the same minor drugs. I do for the piece of mind and you do when you. 'bout to fuck. I leave, act up and leave you and something trap. out the bando. But I want a nigga call the curtain. choppers fired and it's having the fam over. That's the thing, I love to hate. so I got a whip for my bitch. If you think I'm cuffing, you should forget it. [Hook]. I'mma keep it real with you baby. Understand me, don't tell you lies. I feel love is pretty but threatened. Too complicated, never willing to try. When I locked it down, she freed up. Coco and I know she loved the prenup. Now she changing niggas like the seasons. Got it good but I feel distant in my mind. can't help think I'm mastermind. [Verse 3]. You never wanna hear it, you never wanna be there. You never take me serious, you piece of shit, let's be fair. Know you got it from your mama. the day I met her she said ""Why he here? "". Where the fuck you put your heart at?. Bitches that pulling ain't all that. You on another level, showing off. tryna make me jealous. All the homies that been a problem. nigga bring the weapons. Aks and the fans, disrespecting. They close to my kin, Ohb shit. [Hook]. I'mma keep it real with you baby. Understand me, don't tell you lies. I feel love is pretty but threatened. Too complicated, never willing to try. When I locked it down, she freed up.

And when they push you down,. You got to get back up. And when they push you down,. You got to get back up. [T.I]. Push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup. Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what. Cause when you got the belt and the ring. People with ya poppin bottles, taking pictures look around. As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgement. Surprise, I'm here to show that I'ma rise above this. Ay, what it is world. Yeah it's me again, back before you, at your mercy. Don't bend your knee again, no running from the truth. As much as we pretend, that it aint what it is, than it hits cnn. Apologies to my fans and my closest friends, (I'm sorry). For letting you down, I wont take you down this road again. Most of you now saying whatever, here we go again. Blogs, radio, and television all going in. I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrasment. I gotta say you f-cking haters is hilarious. How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou. Point your finger now with me looking down. Same clown that was twitpic'ing at my wedding. On the same twitter page disrespecting. Wait a second (hold up).

Surprise, I'm here to show that I'ma rise above this. [T.I]. I admit, yeah, I done some dumb sh-t,. Disappointed everybody I know. Try not to hold that against me though. My road to redemption has no gps. So guess the time must be invested for this to be manifested. Yes it's hard living life in the spotlight. Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light. The bible say ""let he without sin cast the stone first"" (stone first). The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first?. Yeah he go to work, never done no drugs or to be fair. He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead. Difference is, my shortcomings hit the media. Thanks to tmz, the ajc and wikipedia. See the stairway to heaven while stepping down jacob's ladder. My good outweigh the bad, god, aint that what really matters, nope. A matter of fact I'm wrong but after that the good I've done in your hood. Should it overshadow that?. Got the world laughing at me for the moment. But it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with. Even if you so legit that you get a house with a dog and a picket fence. The people with you then but when they turn on you remember this. Chorus. Push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup. Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what. Cause when you got the belt and the ring. People with ya poppin bottles, taking pictures look around. As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgement. Surprise, I'm here to show that I'ma rise above this. [Chris Brown]. Hello, out there. Can you hear me. Can you hear me. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Can you (hear you). Hello, out there,. Can you hear me. You gotta get you. You gotta gotta believe in me. Hey. [T.I]. I accept full responsibility for the all the wrong I've done. If y'all thought I were perfect. I apologize for being human man. But never again partner. You can put my life on that. [chorus]. And you can love me, or you can leave me. Before you judge me, just let me be me. And you can love me or either leave me. Before you judge me, see life ain't easy"

holy angel (feat. pusha t),"[Refrão: Chris Brown]. If these walls could speak. I wouldn't have to make believe you're here. Holy angel, just stop the fire that burns in me. I need a saviour cause I'm scared of me. [Verso1: Chris Brown]. I done been through hell and back. I'm seeing demons everyday, calling me Kettle Black. Perfectionists if you're perfect, where your medal at?. My life way going downhill, I had to pedal back. These niggas always wanna talk about the lame shit. If I looked back on my life, I wouldn't change shit. Maybe a couple more cars so I can lane switch. If I put that mic on silence and never sang shit. This my life and this your job dawg. I'm too hot, got me thinking did the clouds fall?. Probably not. Shit just put me back up in the bleachers. Back when all a nigga had was a pair of sneakers. All this stress on my chest, I'm fucking having seizures. Nowadays, having fun is fucking illegal. Walking with your head down, that's not grown man shit. I'm taking over the game until I own that bitch. Yeah nigga in my hood them choppers always busting. Niggas living day to day like tomorrow ain't nothing. Fuck love, that shit get in the way now. She loving every nigga, ass up and face down. Addicted to the game, my young'ns use a. 38, first 48. They gon' throw that shit away. bet they never catch a case. I'm gon' separate myself from all the lames. If I die and float away, you gon' feel my mama pain. Sitting in my room, I'm reminiscing. Shit I ain't have a pot to piss in. Family whipping crack up in the kitchen. All eyes on me so pay attention. Got a problem with the Da should've stayed my ass in Va. Thousand hours some bull. picking trash up off the freeway. I'm the nigga that the kids looking up to. Straight A's now before they say ""Fuck school"". Ha and I don't bite my tongue for no weak nigga. Cause y'all never had to starve for a week nigga. No clothes but 44 to a house hold. Stomach growling but I kept my fucking mouth closed. [Refrão: Chris Brown]. If these walls could speak. I wouldn't have to make believe you're here. Holy angel, just stop the fire that burns in me. I need a saviour cause I'm scared of me. [Verso2: Pusha T]. Came in the game thinkin' music was the way out. To get us off the corners, hit records was the pay out. Hard transitionin' from hustlin' 'til it's grey out. A decade with the devil. lemme show you how this play out. Started as a duo, didn't stay a duo. Things fall apart, Ricky Martin left Menudo. Was a team of us, everything was for the crew though. Never Rosé while my niggas sippin' Nuvo. So, so records bought more dope. Every record label dollar went to more coke. Ghetto rich but still scramblin' like we poor folks. We was all goin' left from what the Lord taught. The pressure, my pride wouldn't let up. The way they took my niggas had us thinkin'. we was set up. All at once so the pain hardly let up. Now this bitch mumblin' 'round the house. about she fed up. Yugh, when it rains, it pours, nigga. Dope boys expect the money, hungry whore nigga. Woo, with my niggas and the feds. Do you think I give a fuck if Def Jam is in the red?. They'll undership your record while they pillow talk in bed. So I never try to talk them motherfuckers off the ledge. ""Jump nigga, "" like Joe Clark said. If you ain't tryna win then you better off dead, gone. [Refrão: Chris Brown]. If these walls could speak. I wouldn't have to make believe you're here. Holy angel, just stop the fire that burns in me. I need a saviour cause I'm scared of me"

Just 'cause we different. Don't mean we distant. And if you kill a man, ain't no way to bring him back. Yeah, you say it's mind over matter. But what we're livin for? What really matters?. Some niggas say the spoon was just on the platter and. Other niggas is doomed just for disaster. All alone sleeping in my bedroom. As wet sheets, mama gonna be dead soon. 'Cause her man beat hear, but he don't realize. She important to this family like a fucking heirloom. Yeah, her nigga still found his way out. Record deal came, her nigga played out. My mama livin good, she takin days out. They sayin', boy all that hard work payed out. Five hundred racks for our show. But ain't gonna never do no 60 minutes interview. 'Cause all you wanna do is twist my words up. And all I wanna do is flip my birds up. Kind of tipsy after ... murder. I'm singing, ass nigga, know you heard of. Me, every day my clique stuntin. Niggas talking down, but I'ma make em put them words up. Out to sale, all I had to say, what else?. Cock suckers low blowing under my belt. Yeah, they hangin from the tip, they trying to get a sip. Don't let em get a grip, I'm pissing onto myself. Nineteen, nigga went through a tragedy. Three years and nigga just found a better me. Yeah, you might find another lover,. But you always started Breezy like the letter b. Nightmares full of haunting. Thinking do I really like this star shit. Because fame ain't freedom in this diamond chain. Only me, they hold you hostage. Now I got a lot of offers telling me. The way they closing, they wanna be my sponsor. But when a nigga fall off, again they gonna be like off em. And they gonna smile up in your face just like, ""awesome, great"". Wait, police, in the tub, can I relate?. I guess that's why this war on drugs is the debate. I'ma keep on livin my life from day to day. Learned from my mistakes"

Know what it is, I'm the man in my city. He only look at your ass and your titties. You don't need makeup, you know that you pretty. You kinda crazy, you know that I get it. Half on a baby, you know that I did it. Guilty as charged, I ain't gonna be innocent. I'm tryna be limitless. I'm tryna fuck up all the hennessy. You know I say ""fuck all my enemies"". I know you on your independent shit. Quality over quantity. Bad bitch right in front of me. Can't lie, baby, honestly. 'cause that pussy remindin' me. And now you up on games, no.

I'm so hinted, angry with all of the world. I couldn't keep friends. Just wishin' you'd come back and see. My difficult times being an adolescent. And like so many just like me without a shoulder to lean. I needed you. When I needed a father figure. I needed you. To stop me from makin' the wrong decisions. At seventeen,. When the cold of the world got my back up against the wall. When temptation was calling me,. Didn't know which way to go. I needed you. I need, I needed you. I needed you. I need, I needed you. At seventeen,. When the cold of the world got my back up against the wall. When temptation was calling me,. Didn't know which way to go. Mama had no financial help. And thoughts of breakin' the law came. Seein' her tryna hold down two jobs. Was tearin' up on me, had a way (had a way). All my friends was gettin' in it. It came time for me to get that dough. Wrong or right. I had to go for what I know. I needed you. When I needed a father figure. I needed you. To stop me from makin' the wrong decisions. At seventeen,. When the cold of the world got my back up against the wall. When temptation was calling me,. Didn't know which way to go. I needed you. I need, I needed you. I needed you. I need, I needed you. At seventeen,. When the cold of the world got my back up against the wall. When temptation was calling me,. Didn't know which way to go. And Lord I pray, give me strength to forgive them. And not hold all the hate I've got. Even though the pains from this was too heavy. And Lord I pray, show my younger brothers. Growin' up without a father. How to turn what they have less into a legacy. And Lord I pray. From the knowledge I ain't get. God, you gave me. When temptation was calling me,. Didn't know which way to go. I needed you. When I needed a father figure. I needed you. To stop me from makin' the wrong decisions. At seventeen,. When the cold of the world got my back up against the wall. When temptation was calling me,. Didn't know which way to go"

remember me (with tyga),"[Chris Brown & Tyga]. Girl, you know we got the time. Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing?. I know you're ready, show that ass. Girl, you looking so bad, getting horny. Watching you do it. Girl, I wanna kiss it. While you kissing your girlfriends. I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory. Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me. [Chris Brown]. Ha, look, I be banging all on that beat. 808, she got the bass when her booty shake. She got her friends with her and they a sight to see. All that ass, don't let it go to waste. All this Hennessy, this liquor, 'bout to penetrate. While I'm pushing Lamborghini's on the interstate. I long-dick her, I'mma go for hours. You minute-made like lemonade. I'm fresh as fuck in these Margielas. I skate past, a nigga better than veterans. Bipolar cold, give me the medicine. My chain too bright, no Thomas Edison. When I pull it out, bitch nervous. Better ride this wave, bitch, surf it. Girl, you better keep them legs open. Only thing you close is these curtains. And she only got time for a nigga if I take her out to eat. A nigga really gotta motivate. Man, that's too much work for the pussy. I don't work for the pussy, nigga really don't communicate. Ha, I'd rather lick it like a dinner plate. I'd rather keep my money in a safe. Ha, bitch, I ain't got time to play. I need it now, not a minute late, ha. [Chris Brown & Tyga]. Girl, you know we got the time. Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing?. I know you're ready, show that ass. Girl, you looking so bad, getting horny. Watching you do it. Girl, I wanna kiss it. While you kissing your girlfriends. I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory. Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me. [Tyga]. Bow your head to a king, nigga. Dreams house, my dreams bigger. Got a deck of cards if my heart switch up. Ace of spades, her eyes lit up. Diamonds glitter in my car, thriller. She pray for me, that's God willing. I'm hard to break, my bars prison. Her new name, Ass-Zilla. She love a nigga and that pussy tight. Come through, fuck you all night. Some foreplay, that's all right. But she rather do number 69. High notes, it's prime time. On a couch, hit it from behind. Hit you with that large stroke. Now she fiending for that good dope, yeah. Ha, that's my bae, she cook and clean, I got it made. Handcuff like she a slave, touch ya. Let ya tongue taste. So high, no ceiling space, numb to it. Can't feel her face. Yeah, she numb to it, can't feel her face. [Chris Brown & Tyga]. Girl, you know we got the time. Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing?. I know you're ready, show that ass. Girl, you looking so bad, getting horny. Watching you do it. Girl, I wanna kiss it. While you kissing your girlfriends. I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory. Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me. [Chris Brown]. Blowing up the line on my cellular. She wanna lock a nigga down, on the regular. Talking crazy to me like she own the dick. But I don't trust her as far as I can throw the bitch, ha. Momma told me to find a keeper. But I switch like designer sneakers. A girl with the finest features. Every nigga wanna talk to her. But I got her first, finders keepers. Violins in the back, is my theme music. Her ass on my mind, I dream booty. Any nigga tryna fuck my bitch. Then it's off with his head, how kings do it. My rings ruby, red bandana. I stay wooping. Got too many cribs, I stay moving. Three Lambos, I stay couping. Ha, but you don't hear me though. Virginia to the Westside. Car foreign, the girl sit on the left side. Smoking weed on the plane, that's the best high. She gotta sign the waiver 'fore I let her fly. Helipad on the boat. Chilling in the South of France, Saint-Tropez, Nice, Monaco. But nothing compare to what's in my pants. Girl, stop playing. [Chris Brown & Tyga]. Girl, you know we got the time. Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing?. I know you're ready, show that ass. Girl, you looking so bad, getting horny. Watching you do it. Girl, I wanna kiss it. While you kissing your girlfriends. I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory. Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me"

seen the light,"(1st Verse). It's been a struggle for me,. Wonderin` why I can't get by with my life,. But now I'm free,. And I done did some right and wrong,. But still I see the light,. And I done been around the sex and drugs,. Hustlin` but mama ain't raise no thug,. And it took a little to see how real it could get,. And how this life wasn't meant for me 'cause I,. Seen a lot of bad things on my block,. But I ain't wonna be a victim of a gunshot,. I can't let nothing? hold me down. (Chorus). See all the things I read about,. Aee all the things I've heard about,. I seen the light. (2nd Verse). It's kinda hard for me,. To stay away from all these girls. And the haters they don't like,. That I'm fulfillin` my dream,. But I'm just tryna do my thing,. My nigga can't I live my life,. I got the world on my shoulders (shoulders),. And I'm only getting` older (older),. But it's like it's getting` colder,. I'm gone make it but I can't take it sometimes,. I came a long way from my block,. And I'm grateful for everything I got,. I didn't let nothing bring me down. (Chorus). Aw man, after all this, who would`ve thought,. Little boy from Tappahannock, Virginia,. You know what I`m sayin`,. would make it all the way to the top.. (Rap). Life is vivid but seen through the eyes of a righteous spirit,. They try to show us the light but we don't like to. hear it,. Mama told me I was bright but despite her lyrics,. A large heard across my sight I had to fight to clear it,. Like a runner a couple of summers I often wondered if it really was winter. And that's when I heard the thunder,.

"the cypher (with ace hood, kevin mccall & tyga - live @ bet hip hop awards 2011)","[Chris Talkin]. Welcome to the cypher!. Myself, K-Mac, Ace Hood and the Tyger. Let's go. [Ace Hood]. Moment of silence for this beat that I'm about to kill. And all you rappers signed a suicidal deal. No hard feelings, pimpin, this what authentic is. Month old denim, 30 grand in it still. Sleeping on me? I put gas in your Nyquil. Getting money while your pockets on the diet pill. Flow knock em cold, out like Benadryl. Colt 14, call it Emit Till. Yeah, billionaire is a state of mind. That's the rolley on, think before these good times. Micheal Corleone back while he was in his prime. That's how I'm feeling while I'm freaking my new Spanish dime. Damn! You can tell I'm on another level. He think he better then I he get the J letter. Yeah jumped and Jacked, be a trend-setter. You lookin at the past, how you doin its a pleasure. [Kevin McCall]. I'm at the top like high note. Killing those 5.0. Jeffrey Dahmer, I'mma slaughter every beat that I'm on. Y'all sleeping on me so I had to turn the lights on. My pockets swollen: I should put some ice on. Shout out to Breezy could've never did this shit alone. Potty traning couldn't never did this shit alone. If we ain't the best to do it, then prove us wrong. So sick on that HIV, I guess that mean I'm full-blown. Of course I'm just speaking metaphorically. Living fantastic, I wonder if its four of me. This is just a sample: if you want more of me. You have to rewind time unless the microphone recording me. K-Mac rhyming on the Maybach. The truth will sit you free so I will testify and say that. Ballin like a preacher, catch me rollin in my Maybach. Shining cause I blew myself up: Arab. [Tyga]. Look at me now, my dogg said that we will be rich one day. But I'm Anthony: I do things the Hardaway. Easy bake fast cake, rearrange her vertebrae. Try it like a murder case. You gon need ice skates, thin ice, ivy. I see her in the winter. Oh you copying my swag? Well you a little late. Prolly make more when I'm gone, Mike J, smooth criminal. Smooth bass, I call it Sade. Why you starin so long? ?. Money talk so I jus walk and let it translate. You ain't fuckin with me I don't fornicate. I jus let her taste test then she let my dick chase. Young money cash money, dollars big face. So when you talkin new rappers don't compare me. Haha, I'mma last king, we don't talk rappers if it ain't YMCMB. [Chris Brown]. Look, said I was down for the count. Lets make em eat their words. And if this beat is sweet I make em bite the curb. This probation got me walkin the straight and narrow. I'm in the club taking shots jus like its double barrel. C'mon live thru what I've been thru. This media so fucked up thats why I don't do no interviews. And I ain't gotta break shit but I bend the rules. I skateboard, kick flip, right in my pool. With 200 model chicks super gettin loose. They jus want a big dick, did I say that? oops. Oh I, oh my where's my manners. Pardon me for this grammar. This Virginia country grammar. Goin nuts like some planters, man my chain feel like an anchor. When I told you to use yo head I ain't want you to be no thinker. Fresher than a muthafucka yea you got yo stank up. Yeaa swallow yo pride, go ahead an drank up. Shame on you. . ClaudinhoBreezy"

Still they've never felt this far. Feel the heat on my skin. Haven't seen the sun ever since. No matter how, no matter when. I can't get close enough, can't get close enough. Reach for the clouds, nothing to spare. Flying like the both of us, the both of us yeah. Whatever we go through, it always leads back to you. Where the heartbeat is marching. The fire mutes the darkness. Home is where the heart is. So home is where she is, she is. Home is where the heart is. So home is where she is. Wouldn't trade this for any other place in the whole world. Wouldn't trade this for any other place in the whole world. Where the heartbeat is marching. The fire mutes the darkness.

I did things for her, ain't rich, ain't poor. I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her. Well enough to know if this was all that she came for. But enough to know tonight, excited, she came four. Times, to my cousin house to see if I was there. Getcha minds, out the gutter, man, we out here tryna have a good. Time, and here I am all heavy with the word swear. Somebody that's a nerd likely fast-forward, but, shit, they asked for it. It's hard to throw up the deuces, 'cause when you know it's juicy.

For any of y'all that didn't know. And I'm never that hard to find because 420 is my zip code. My back then couldn't get dro, cause back then I was this broke. That's why I got so many hustles. Bruh man from the fifth floor. What would you do in the middle of the winter. When the sun goes down and it gets cold?. Growin' up in a house with no stove. No doors, no walls, no windows. And my brother was always fresher. I would go to school in his clothes, when I did go. So that's why now this the type of life that I live for. Comin' up as a youngin', man some nights I would vomit. I would throw up on myself cause I was so sick to my stomach. Now I'm the shit, fix the plumbing. Feel with my y'all, I'm this close. Spent my whole life chasin' shit, where's nabisco?.

You're gon' have to get your reach on. I'm up all the way high, all the way fly. On the ground and I'm off the radar. Bernie madoff money, dawg. Got killers paid off with it all. I got the juice, could you place a call. And we place a call to who place a call. Don't get your part and not too hard. I disregard what you say. Back up the trunk and pass the buck.

And I'm still here with a black whip from the strange clouds. And I'm still here with the same team, nigga stay down. Still here for the east side. Ain't a thing change but the bank account. Hands high when I come 'round. Cause I'm killin this shit nigga, hands down. And I go hard, my passport's like a postcard. Give a fuck if I'm solo, I'll go toe-to-toe with your whole squad. With the soul of a soldier. But even still I don't want no parts. And no niggas with no hearts. You cocksuckers need yo guards. I'm throwed off for the most part. A young dog with an old bark. Flow dumb, but I'm so smart. I compose art, call me mozart. My nightlife's like a soap opera. With two chicks like I'm noah's ark. They got nice dresses with no bras with good bodies like ""oh god!"". From a poor child to on top like a mohawk. But I always new I'd go far. Like a gas truck with no bar. So no applause, hold the applause. Just put your hand up if you know the song. [Chris Brown]. If anybody feeling fresh in the building. Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now. And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them. I know they feeling me now. And if you too fresh in the building. Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now.

champion,"(Chris Brown:). Some people have to learn. Some people wait their turn. Some people have to fight. Some people give their lives.. (Chipmunk:). They wanna hold you back, tell'em pee off.

Not everybody get a second chance at getting money. Or even getting lucky. So you gotta feel the hunger in your tummy.. (Chris Brown:). I'm always pushing myself to the limit.

I used to see my momma getting beat down!. Is that the real definition of me now?. I fell off, back on my feet now. Headed to the sky, can't even see down. Award shows, I poured my heart out.

Take em and let em go. (Chris Brown:). You made me who I am. From the words you said. Some people have to learn. Some people wait there turn. Some people but not me. I was born a champion.

"deuces (remix) (ft. drake, t.i., kanye west, fabolous and andre 3000)","(Drake). What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed. I'm waitin' in my hotel room. Seems like we're arguin' more and it's getting less romantic. Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon. But I'll f**k you right I will, I'll f**k you right I will. I'll f**k you like no one has ever ever made you feel. I mean, this part of our relationship's amazing still. I might just put up with the arguin' and stay for real. You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes. You with all those curves, and me without no brakes. Ooh, I'm willin' to work it out however longer how it takes. You feel like you missed out on those happy days. Well, girl that makes two of us. Our timing is wrong. Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone. Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my Mrs.. And the hardest part about the f**kin' business is minding your own. And every time I try and break it off. We just yell until we're tired, then I break you off. It's useless, all this fighting, let's get past it now. Even when I throw them deuces, you just send ‘er back around. (T.I.). Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan. Ay, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again. I ju' keep on talking but I guess that you ain't listenin'. Rather run around with them nothin'-ass bitches, then. Go on, got me hot, smokin' like the chim-i-ney. We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies. Deep inside, it's killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you. To see her in that two-seater, no, that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo. Ah-ha, didn't you think you would be over me. By now, so you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief. She spoke her peace, I know, capisce, so love must be let go, released. Into the wind, begin again, them deuces I must throw ya, peace. (Kanye West). You know what, yo? You a b**ch. You should have a travel agent, 'cause you a trip. You should make your own toilet tissue, since you the shit. But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch. I hate (???), but I love your mom. Give her a kiss from me, her second son. Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together. You gon' be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever. Girl seducers, they come in deuces. But when I cut ‘em off, they always become a nuisance. Niggas take my old flows, and they take my old swag. He just took my old bitch, and turned it to his new bitch. I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on. What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on. Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth. So when y'all talk 'bout You Know Who, I don't know who you talkin' 'bout. (Fabolous). According to my old b**ch, I be on some new s**t. She was on some old s**t, now I got a new b**ch. Think I give two s**ts? You ain't gon' do s**t. Meet my two fingers, intro, deuces. If you knew better, you'd do better. Wanna give the middle finger, but I got two better. (Chris Brown). So you gon' diss me even though you know it's wrong?. Know you gon' (miss me a little when I'm gone). (Fabolous). Drizzy voice. Now I'm ghost, baby, four-door Rizzy-Royce. Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice. I'm 'bout my business, boys, plus I make paper. C'mon, that's old news, yes, the day's paper. Ho, you talkin'? What about?. If it ain't how I kept you studded out, you might as well shut your mouth. You'll never score another me, I shut it out. Act like there's gum in your hair, girl, cut it out. (Andre 3000). The farewell email, from a female. But I'm a player, ain't gon' tell ya all the details. What it entails is hard to say like selling seashells. By the seashore, but she's not a bore. But neither a whore, who needs to know more?. The kind you can't ignore but want to open the door. For, or, run in your favorite store. And leave with all them shoppin' bags and half of it ain't yours. I did things for her, ain't rich, ain't poor. I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her. Well enough to know if this was all that she came for. But enough to know tonight, excited, she came four. Times, to my cousin house to see if I was there. Getcha minds, out the gutter, man, we out here tryna have a good. Time, and here I am all heavy with the word swear. Somebody that's a nerd likely fast-forward, but, shit, they asked for it. It's hard to throw up the deuces, 'cause when you know it's juicy. You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses. Chase cabooses 'til the track gone. I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs. (Chris Brown). I'm on some new shit. I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (Deuces). I'm movin' on to somethin' better, better, better. No more tryna make it work (Deuces). You make me wanna say, bye-bye. Say, bye-bye. Say, bye-bye, to her (Deuces). You make me wanna say, bye-bye. Say, bye-bye. Say, bye-bye, to her (Deuces)"

Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what. Cause when you got the belt and the ring. People with ya poppin bottles, taking pictures look around. As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgement. Surprise, I'm here to show that I'ma rise above this. Ay, what it is world. Yeah it's me again, back before you, at your mercy. Don't bend your knee again, no running from the truth. As much as we pretend, that it aint what it is, than it hits cnn. Apologies to my fans and my closest friends, (I'm sorry). For letting you down, I wont take you down this road again. Most of you now saying whatever, here we go again. Blogs, radio, and television all going in. I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrasment. I gotta say you f-cking haters is hilarious. How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou. Point your finger now with me looking down. Same clown that was twitpic'ing at my wedding. On the same twitter page disrespecting. Wait a second (hold up). Never mind my imperfections this is fact, remember that. No mistakes too great to recover and bounce back. [Chris Brown]. And when they push you down, you got to get back up.

My road to redemption has no gps. So guess the time must be invested for this to be manifested. Yes it's hard living life in the spotlight. Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light. The bible say ""let he without sin cast the stone first"" (stone first). The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first?. Yeah he go to work, never done no drugs or to be fair. He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead. Difference is, my shortcomings hit the media. Thanks to tmz, the ajc and wikipedia. See the stairway to heaven while stepping down jacob's ladder. My good outweigh the bad, god, aint that what really matters, nope. A matter of fact I'm wrong but after that the good I've done in your hood. Should it overshadow that?. Got the world laughing at me for the moment. But it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with. Even if you so legit that you get a house with a dog and a picket fence. The people with you then but when they turn on you remember this. Chorus. Push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup. Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what. Cause when you got the belt and the ring. People with ya poppin bottles, taking pictures look around. As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgement. Surprise, I'm here to show that I'ma rise above this. [Chris Brown]. Hello, out there. Can you hear me. Can you hear me. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Can you (hear you). Hello, out there,. Can you hear me. You gotta get you. You gotta gotta believe in me. Hey. [T.I]. I accept full responsibility for the all the wrong I've done.

holy angel (feat. pusha t),"[Refrão: Chris Brown]. If these walls could speak. I wouldn't have to make believe you're here. Holy angel, just stop the fire that burns in me. I need a saviour cause I'm scared of me. [Verso1: Chris Brown]. I done been through hell and back. I'm seeing demons everyday, calling me Kettle Black. Perfectionists if you're perfect, where your medal at?. My life way going downhill, I had to pedal back. These niggas always wanna talk about the lame shit. If I looked back on my life, I wouldn't change shit. Maybe a couple more cars so I can lane switch. If I put that mic on silence and never sang shit. This my life and this your job dawg. I'm too hot, got me thinking did the clouds fall?. Probably not. Shit just put me back up in the bleachers. Back when all a nigga had was a pair of sneakers. All this stress on my chest, I'm fucking having seizures. Nowadays, having fun is fucking illegal. Walking with your head down, that's not grown man shit. I'm taking over the game until I own that bitch. Yeah nigga in my hood them choppers always busting. Niggas living day to day like tomorrow ain't nothing. Fuck love, that shit get in the way now. She loving every nigga, ass up and face down. Addicted to the game, my young'ns use a. 38, first 48. They gon' throw that shit away. bet they never catch a case. I'm gon' separate myself from all the lames. If I die and float away, you gon' feel my mama pain. Sitting in my room, I'm reminiscing. Shit I ain't have a pot to piss in. Family whipping crack up in the kitchen. All eyes on me so pay attention. Got a problem with the Da should've stayed my ass in Va. Thousand hours some bull. picking trash up off the freeway. I'm the nigga that the kids looking up to. Straight A's now before they say ""Fuck school"". Ha and I don't bite my tongue for no weak nigga. Cause y'all never had to starve for a week nigga. No clothes but 44 to a house hold. Stomach growling but I kept my fucking mouth closed. [Refrão: Chris Brown]. If these walls could speak. I wouldn't have to make believe you're here. Holy angel, just stop the fire that burns in me. I need a saviour cause I'm scared of me. [Verso2: Pusha T]. Came in the game thinkin' music was the way out. To get us off the corners, hit records was the pay out. Hard transitionin' from hustlin' 'til it's grey out. A decade with the devil. lemme show you how this play out. Started as a duo, didn't stay a duo. Things fall apart, Ricky Martin left Menudo. Was a team of us, everything was for the crew though. Never Rosé while my niggas sippin' Nuvo. So, so records bought more dope. Every record label dollar went to more coke. Ghetto rich but still scramblin' like we poor folks. We was all goin' left from what the Lord taught. The pressure, my pride wouldn't let up. The way they took my niggas had us thinkin'. we was set up. All at once so the pain hardly let up. Now this bitch mumblin' 'round the house. about she fed up. Yugh, when it rains, it pours, nigga. Dope boys expect the money, hungry whore nigga. Woo, with my niggas and the feds. Do you think I give a fuck if Def Jam is in the red?. They'll undership your record while they pillow talk in bed. So I never try to talk them motherfuckers off the ledge. ""Jump nigga, "" like Joe Clark said. If you ain't tryna win then you better off dead, gone. [Refrão: Chris Brown]. If these walls could speak. I wouldn't have to make believe you're here. Holy angel, just stop the fire that burns in me. I need a saviour cause I'm scared of me"

how i feel,"Is how I feel, right?. It's only me, right?. That's right. I was 15 of Virginia nigga with ambition. Young, but I envision fucking them bad bitches. Live my life with no regrets. I try to show respect, but you don't give it. I guess you don't understand when. It might take me a life time to take it back. And it might take you a life time to know the facts, yeah. Just 'cause we different. Don't mean we distant. And if you kill a man, ain't no way to bring him back. Yeah, you say it's mind over matter. But what we're livin for? What really matters?. Some niggas say the spoon was just on the platter and. Other niggas is doomed just for disaster. All alone sleeping in my bedroom. As wet sheets, mama gonna be dead soon. 'Cause her man beat hear, but he don't realize. She important to this family like a fucking heirloom. Yeah, her nigga still found his way out. Record deal came, her nigga played out. My mama livin good, she takin days out. They sayin', boy all that hard work payed out. Five hundred racks for our show. But ain't gonna never do no 60 minutes interview. 'Cause all you wanna do is twist my words up. And all I wanna do is flip my birds up. Kind of tipsy after ... murder. I'm singing, ass nigga, know you heard of. Me, every day my clique stuntin. Niggas talking down, but I'ma make em put them words up. Out to sale, all I had to say, what else?. Cock suckers low blowing under my belt. Yeah, they hangin from the tip, they trying to get a sip. Don't let em get a grip, I'm pissing onto myself. Nineteen, nigga went through a tragedy. Three years and nigga just found a better me. Yeah, you might find another lover,. But you always started Breezy like the letter b. Nightmares full of haunting. Thinking do I really like this star shit. Because fame ain't freedom in this diamond chain. Only me, they hold you hostage. Now I got a lot of offers telling me. The way they closing, they wanna be my sponsor. But when a nigga fall off, again they gonna be like off em. And they gonna smile up in your face just like, ""awesome, great"". Wait, police, in the tub, can I relate?. I guess that's why this war on drugs is the debate. I'ma keep on livin my life from day to day. Learned from my mistakes"

But you just kept me in the dark painting pictures. I know you lying and you sneaking, I'm just stating facts. I'm just that dummy who believed. You 'cause I loved your ass. Not the only nigga who been through that. But I'm the only nigga with receipts and popping tags. I was looking forward to us making love. And waking up for round two. But you ain't stayed long enough, and it's fucking me up. Learning from them hoes that's around you. And now you up on games, no. You don't see me the same, no. The drugs, they can numb the pain. Popping bars, the easy part, but I still hurt the same. Thinking 'bout these bitches when I'm rolling up. I'm just tryna vibe, wanna feel the love. Two bitches like double dutch. Off that purple actavis, I stay with that double cup. I just switched my style up, now she stuck like what the fuck. Started not to care, european real, bought a couple foreigns. Driving outta here, know that molly get me there. Just a couple sips, just 'fore I forget, don't remember shit. Get a lot of pussy, don't fuck with relationships. I'm on my mile high, on that crazy shit. On my brazy shit, don't wanna know who she be fucking with. She tryna break my heart, I know you loving it. You on some other shit and I'm on my own again. I was looking forward to us making love. And waking up for round two. But you ain't stayed long enough, and it's fucking me up. Learning from them hoes that's around you. And now you up on games, no. You don't see me the same, no. The drugs, they can numb the pain. Popping bars, the easy part, but I still hurt the same. Think of ways to navigate. Why you steady throwin shade on my name?. While I'm taking all the blame. We both messed up and going separate ways. You fuckin' them niggas, I'm fuckin' them bitches. All that silly shit won't make a difference. Know what it is, I'm the man in my city. He only look at your ass and your titties. You don't need makeup, you know that you pretty. You kinda crazy, you know that I get it. Half on a baby, you know that I did it. Guilty as charged, I ain't gonna be innocent. I'm tryna be limitless. I'm tryna fuck up all the hennessy. You know I say ""fuck all my enemies"". I know you on your independent shit. Quality over quantity. Bad bitch right in front of me. Can't lie, baby, honestly. 'cause that pussy remindin' me. And now you up on games, no. You don't see me the same, no. The drugs, they can numb the pain. Popping bars, the easy part, but I still hurt the same. Up on games. You don't see me the same, no. Numb the pain, yeah. Bars, the easy part, but I still hurt the same"

seen the light,"(1st Verse). It's been a struggle for me,. Wonderin` why I can't get by with my life,. But now I'm free,. And I done did some right and wrong,. But still I see the light,. And I done been around the sex and drugs,. Hustlin` but mama ain't raise no thug,. And it took a little to see how real it could get,. And how this life wasn't meant for me 'cause I,. Seen a lot of bad things on my block,. But I ain't wonna be a victim of a gunshot,. I can't let nothing? hold me down. (Chorus). See all the things I read about,. Aee all the things I've heard about,. I seen the light. (2nd Verse). It's kinda hard for me,. To stay away from all these girls. And the haters they don't like,. That I'm fulfillin` my dream,. But I'm just tryna do my thing,. My nigga can't I live my life,. I got the world on my shoulders (shoulders),. And I'm only getting` older (older),. But it's like it's getting` colder,. I'm gone make it but I can't take it sometimes,. I came a long way from my block,. And I'm grateful for everything I got,. I didn't let nothing bring me down. (Chorus). Aw man, after all this, who would`ve thought,. Little boy from Tappahannock, Virginia,. You know what I`m sayin`,. would make it all the way to the top.. (Rap). Life is vivid but seen through the eyes of a righteous spirit,. They try to show us the light but we don't like to. hear it,. Mama told me I was bright but despite her lyrics,. A large heard across my sight I had to fight to clear it,. Like a runner a couple of summers I often wondered if it really was winter. And that's when I heard the thunder,. A current was occurin` it was stirrin` up my hunger,. But I couldn't let the shit bury a nigga under,. Use to cry hopin` all of this would pass,. And then I learned to use my tears to water up the. grass,. A part of my swagga but apparently I won,. I took my shades off and now I'm starin` at the sun,. I'm seein` the light, I'm seein the light,. realizing` that it's me in the light,. I read about it (read about it),. Heard about it (heard about it) now I know. I coulda did wrong,. I seen a lot of people hustle,. But I left them things alone,. I almost lost my friend to the struggle,. But I guess that made me strong,. made me strong,. I seen a whole lot of drama,. And it taught me how to fight,. Taught me how to fight,. And I thank God for my mama,. She showed me what was right,. I coulda been in the dark,. But thank God for the light,. (I see the light) I see the light. (End adlibs). All the things I heard about,. I read about it, I read about it, oh,. I see the light, I see the light"

That's why I let it down, tryna get a better view. Genuinely see the way I regularly choose. Whack niggas bitch, I'm up to letting every view. Something from benal they already really knew. Instead of tryna fuck you need to get a better crew. Lights out, switch, I came up real close. Didn't know I back down, I don't wanna let it go. Yea folks, Shawty wanna stand close. When a nigga bang those and I really blow. I didn't really wanna knew it. Then what? He gets a nigga that be blowing like a fluid. And I can damage a nigga, get every time on that, nigga. Get up on, like it's something. We know the thing, we really do it. And ain't nothing really to it. Pull up, stop. How bout a drop top? Then I'm out, I got my glock cocked. It's always you that's over here. You not hop on the microphone black knock. Yall niggas know what it is. And you know the way I put it down for em. That's right, got em loose. And it ain't nothing baby girl, you can see the grap on em. Now yall don't really want to get a better note. Fireworks, nigga I be givin em a show.

Moment of silence for this beat that I'm about to kill. And all you rappers signed a suicidal deal. No hard feelings, pimpin, this what authentic is. Month old denim, 30 grand in it still. Sleeping on me? I put gas in your Nyquil. Getting money while your pockets on the diet pill. Flow knock em cold, out like Benadryl. Colt 14, call it Emit Till. Yeah, billionaire is a state of mind. That's the rolley on, think before these good times. Micheal Corleone back while he was in his prime. That's how I'm feeling while I'm freaking my new Spanish dime. Damn! You can tell I'm on another level. He think he better then I he get the J letter. Yeah jumped and Jacked, be a trend-setter. You lookin at the past, how you doin its a pleasure. [Kevin McCall]. I'm at the top like high note. Killing those 5.0. Jeffrey Dahmer, I'mma slaughter every beat that I'm on. Y'all sleeping on me so I had to turn the lights on. My pockets swollen: I should put some ice on. Shout out to Breezy could've never did this shit alone. Potty traning couldn't never did this shit alone. If we ain't the best to do it, then prove us wrong. So sick on that HIV, I guess that mean I'm full-blown. Of course I'm just speaking metaphorically. Living fantastic, I wonder if its four of me. This is just a sample: if you want more of me. You have to rewind time unless the microphone recording me. K-Mac rhyming on the Maybach. The truth will sit you free so I will testify and say that. Ballin like a preacher, catch me rollin in my Maybach. Shining cause I blew myself up: Arab. [Tyga]. Look at me now, my dogg said that we will be rich one day. But I'm Anthony: I do things the Hardaway. Easy bake fast cake, rearrange her vertebrae. Try it like a murder case. You gon need ice skates, thin ice, ivy. I see her in the winter. Oh you copying my swag? Well you a little late. Prolly make more when I'm gone, Mike J, smooth criminal. Smooth bass, I call it Sade. Why you starin so long? ?. Money talk so I jus walk and let it translate. You ain't fuckin with me I don't fornicate. I jus let her taste test then she let my dick chase. Young money cash money, dollars big face. So when you talkin new rappers don't compare me. Haha, I'mma last king, we don't talk rappers if it ain't YMCMB. [Chris Brown]. Look, said I was down for the count. Lets make em eat their words. And if this beat is sweet I make em bite the curb. This probation got me walkin the straight and narrow. I'm in the club taking shots jus like its double barrel. C'mon live thru what I've been thru. This media so fucked up thats why I don't do no interviews. And I ain't gotta break shit but I bend the rules. I skateboard, kick flip, right in my pool. With 200 model chicks super gettin loose. They jus want a big dick, did I say that? oops. Oh I, oh my where's my manners. Pardon me for this grammar. This Virginia country grammar. Goin nuts like some planters, man my chain feel like an anchor. When I told you to use yo head I ain't want you to be no thinker. Fresher than a muthafucka yea you got yo stank up.

zero,"I thought we were great. You took your love back and ran this off track. I count all the days. 'Til you would come back, how stupid was that. Now you're missing what we used to have. Guess the vodka brought the feeling back. I was caught up in an aftermath. But now, if you really wanna know. Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero. Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero. And I thought you were the one. Then you turned around. Found somebody better. Like I never met ya. Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero. Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. That's how many fucks I give. Wake up with a dime. Get up to no good, better than you could. Go out, free our minds. Like you never would, never understood. Now you're missing what we used to have. You were creeping on my Instagram. I was caught up in an aftermath. But now, if you really wanna know. Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero. Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero. And I thought you were the one. Then you turned around. Found somebody better. Like I never met ya. Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero. Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. That's how many fucks I give. Broke back then but a nigga rich now. Got dollars, got euros, got yens, got pounds. Zeros, zero yeah. Calling me up cause your bank cheque bounced. My new chick one hundred, she got her own. Dinero, zero. You think I'm thinking about your ass?. Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero. Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero. And I thought you were the one. Then you turned around. Found somebody better. Like I never met ya. Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero. Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. That's how many fucks I give. Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. That's how many fucks I give"
