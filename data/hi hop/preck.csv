let dem know,"Yooh, you didn't see that one coming. I let them know. Let them know. Let them know. Let them know. Let them know. Let them know. Let them know. Let them know. Let them know. Let them know that I was not born rich. Let them know that I traveled miles before getting rich. I was born for this since I was in the crib. Don't, don't try to judge me or make your hate speech. You don't know my story, you only know my name, yeah. And all these niggas don't know that I been in the flames. That moment was not my time, God gave me a chance. I saw the angels over me, they were filling my blanks. I thank God for not being hungry. But momma did the monthly shopping. with less than a hundred. Okay, now we have everything we want. But she already swallowed flour to take the edge off hunger. Yeah, to take the edge off hunger. Every time been working hard to make my cash longer. They judge me 'cause can't be a half of me and I know this. They try me, they cheat on me, they are mean, now see me. I see all my niggas, I say hey. I see all my haters, I pray. They already know I don't play. I go to the left and they straight. Them niggas don't know how to say. In front I go and they stay. Fuck off what you think, I don't play. Whatever you think, I don't play. My momma made me rap like this. I started when I was ten years. Singing with my cousin I could feel. That my life was traced for real. I tried to cheat on myself, of course I wouldn't be held. Nobody wanna see me winning. I found myself, my way of living. Slap in the left, slap in the right. how many times my sunrise wasn't bright?. How many times my reaction was fright?. Cut my wings so they don't see me fly. Greatest nigga you don't think I can buy. But I'll stand up and fighting like Ty. Everything goes wrong, know I doing right. Keep calm momma I won't be left behind. Pop you down, you know I will. But making money, you paying bills. You deserve everything that been planted. with my growth you'll be killed. Don't try to make me your friend. 'cause my pain you couldn't feel. I won't deny, that made me stronger. now I'm as tall as a hill, yeah"
