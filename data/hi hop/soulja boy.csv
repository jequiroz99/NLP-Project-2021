I got so many gifts you would swear I stole Christmas. word to the Grinch b-tch my style will switch quick. i knew this all along I was waiting just to hit the kill switch. since day one man your boy been the truth. broke so many records like I’m in the glass booth. like I’m in the glass studio breaking out barriers. back when crime mob was screaming Ellenwood Area. n-gga I aint scared of ya, never ever will be. I’m screaming I’m the best till these rappers kill me. make the people feel me like the blind men do. on your girl head so much like her favourite shampoo. lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com.

I’ma keep spitting til they crown me the best. the rap games a mess, let me clean it up. its a pigsty they going ham give it up. [Verse 3]. flying down the highway a million on the dashboard. you cant start my car up unless you got the password. I’m something like a prophecy spit so properly. when my album drops watch how many rappers copy me. haters opinions are obsolete. don’t make pop music so it ain’t no pop in me. and my brains a b-tch where she at when I need her. ya pack nines, I pack nine kilometers. ya did’nt want beef why would ya start it. cameras flashing like you walking down the red carpet. first you was nameless now imma make you famous. hit you with the stainless and leave your ass brainless. best rapper…. .

I've been stunting so damn hard. Did it for the streets. West side we did it all ones we getting it"
finally,"Ever since I was a baby girl I had a dream. Cinderella theme. Crazy as it seems. Always knew that deep inside. That there would come that day. But I would have to wait. Make so many mistakes. I couldn't comprehend. As I watched it unfold. This classic story told I left it in the cold. Walking through an open door that led me back to you. Each one unlocking more of the truth. I finally stopped tripping on my youth. I finally got lost inside of you. I finally know that I needed to grow. And finally my mate has met my soul. Finally. Now my destiny can begin. Though we will have our differences. Something strange and new is happening. Finally. Now my life doesn't seem so bad. It's the best that I've ever had. Give my love to him finally. I remember the beginning you already knew. I acted like a fool. Just trying to be cool. Fronting like it didn't matter. I just ran away. And on another phase. Was lost in my own space. Found what its like to hurt selfishly. Scared to give of me. Afraid to just believe. I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place. Stumbled through the mess that I have made. Finally got out of my own way. I've finally started living for today. I finally know that I needed to grow. And finally my mate has met my soul"

So I cut tha lights off, then I crouched down ta da ground. Took a look at Arab, said ""nigga don't make a sound! "". Had my pistol in my hand so I knew I had tha power. Heard footsteps gettin louuder and louuder. I ran out tha doe, started bussin with my 9. 6 bullets left tha clip, but 5 on me hit his spine. Now he layin on tha ground, screamin like a hoe. He thought his homeboys was real, but they ran out tha doe. Now he lyin on tha flo, screamin like a lil bitch. When I shot him he dropped his pistol now hee ain't got shit. I told Arab, ""go and take a look around da place."". Den I walked up ta dis nigga, snatched dat mask off his face. After I saw who it was, it's a face I couldn't forget. I can't believe deez niggaz came and tried ta rob me fa my shit. After all I did fa ya'll, this tha fuckin thanks I get. Tried ta take ya out tha hood and tried ta make you niggaz rich. So dey kicked in my doe and tried ta jack me fa my shit. Ya'll niggaz ain't got no heart, thatz some real foul shit. So I sit back taday and I thank inside my head.

Money so long measures. I love my business and I love my pleasure. Live now dies later Internet genius. Self proclaimin he a for the fortunate of fame. He’ll run through the rain. For a meanin to change. Taking over the game. 18 years old wid a drop top phantom. Kidnap the world till they pay my ransom. Deandre way tatted on my face. 4 words 2 say. I deserve a grammy. Ester dean. What do u want from me. Cause I’ve giving u everything. What do u need from me. Are u not happy with anything. Is it not good enough. Am I not good enough. Have I not gave enough.

reppin 4 tha ocean,"My mind's gone, never coming back. So when it's all said and done. I hope they see me like a legend. Let my name.... Crowded room full of conquer minds. On the rise to the top, my only challenge is follow time. Big dreams, big goals, my future's legit. Driven by the fact I want it back and never will quit. That's before the fain, and front us in the pain. But whatever, cause my way I guarantee I'll be the same, ah. Or maybe not, cause money change a lot. And bring my name at the very top. Cause I can't be stopped. Bout to kill this summer, grab a seat, sit back and watch. Transform your whole life like you making.... All a nigga see is green like my name is dot. Plus a want change like my name barac. Always keep my head up like my name was pac. Cause my balls and my words the only thing I got. Niggas wanna envy, and put a nigga down. But every time I feel dead I come back, like kidneys. I want the benjamins, the money, cars and clothes. A private jet that travel all around the fucking globe. Screaming fans, groupie hoes at all my shows. Better life for myself, this what the future holds. And it's not a dream, she my ride or die. She number one in my fucking team. Every single... that we go, always cause a scene. And then at night, she scratch me up like she wolverine. Wise man, understated facts,. Mistakes made when I was young, could never take them back. No need to stress baby girl. You could just relax, cause I told you I was coming back."

And am dooze off the roof seduce twenty off my cake,. Man damn am the shit,man pass me the case,. Yeah,young dre,man call me a boss,. Cortez in this bitch, S.O.D break them off.

I’m headed to the finish line, and aint got no time for u-turns,. Today I realized that I am not perfect,. Everything I did to get here was it really worth it?,. Why wont they just let me be great?,. You fall down seven times you stand up eight,. Realize true happiness lies inside of you. Everyday give ya self a mental shampoo,. The bird sing after the motherfuckin’ storm gone,. If you wanna sing you can sing this song,. Turn my swag on is my theme song ,. its a ninenty-five percent chance that it used to be ya ringtone,. I got swiss in the cheese but I dont yodle,.

But why would you holla back, if a nigga in front of you ain't no harm. He tried to lean, he tried to rock, but he can't do it quite like me. Cause he keep doing the same ole move, constantly. Now watch us kill this dance. Soon as we hit the flo. Bout to get real crazy, don't turn yo head. We bout to start the show. First you bend yo back, and lift yo head. Use yo hands and block yo head. Roll yo arms and show yo swagg. Now break his legs, arms, neck (yea). When we start dancing. What we do? We hurt they feelings. When we start dancing. What we do? We hurt the feelings.
