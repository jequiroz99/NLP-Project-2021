""look guys, jacksons! "". That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by. That's a pretty long third gear in this car. Glidin' on the five. The deer run across, kill the headlights. Pretty fucking. Underneath moon light now. Pretty fucking. Sunrising, sand, comes a morning. Haunting us with the beams. So it ain't as far as it used to be. It begins to blur, we get older (blur!). Summer's not as long as it used to be. Everyday counts like crazy (smoke, hazy). Wanna get soaked?. Wanna film a tape on the speed boat?. We smell of californication. Strike a pose. Everything grows in the congo. Everything grows. Can you call when I call again. [verse 2: frank ocean (kendrick lamar) ]. On comes the evening. Both seeking ends. Peace in my hands worth twice than a friend. And two limbs over shoulder, carry the way. Because I'm stronger, congo is damned (smoke). In comes the morning (smoke). In comes the morning (haze)"

strawberry swing,"[Verso 1]. When we were kids, we handpainted strawberries on a swing. Every moment was so precious, then. I'm still kicking it, I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing. The entire Earth is fighting, all the world is at its end. Just in case, an atom bomb, comes falling on my lawn. I should say and you should hear I've loved. I've loved the good times here, I've loved our good times here. [Verso 2]. Say hello, then say farewell to the places you know. We are all mortals, aren't we? Any moment this could go. Cry, cry, cry, even though that won't change a thing. But you should know, you should hear, that I have loved. I have loved the good times here, and I will miss our good times. [Outro]. Spaceships are lifting off of a dying world. And millions are left behind while the sky burns. There wasn't room for you and I, only you, goodbye, goodbye"

sunday,"I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up. But you not passionate. About half the shit that you into. And I ain't havin' it. And we both know. That I don't mean to offend you. I'm just focused today. And I don't know why it's difficult. To admit that I miss you. And I don't know why we argue. And I just hope that you listen. And if I hurt you I'm sorry. The music makes me dismissive. When I'm awake I'm just driftin'. I'm not complainin'. It's just to say. That I stay pretty busy, lately. And I could be misbehaving. I just hang with my niggas. I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot. I'm faithful. Despite all what's in my face and my pocket. And this is painfully honest. And when I say it I vomit. On cloudy days when I'm salty. I play the hate to the laundry. State to state for the profit. It ain't a stain on me, nigga. My momma raised me a prophet. I play for dollar incentive. And where I'm walking, it's studded. And half-retarded I stumble. To where she park when she visit. I grab the bottle and chug it. I see the car in the distance. I know the dark isn't coming. For the moment, if I could hold it. She, she seems that. All my dreams got dimmer. When I stopped smoking pot. Nightmares got more vivid. When I stopped smoking pot. And loving you is a little different. I don't like you a lot. You see, it seems like. I'm coming back I gotta handle business. Vanish to my sleeper seat. Left you at terminal three. I'll meet you down at baggage claim. In a couple weeks, a fortnight. When you parade my homecoming, don't cry. You know I can't live in any place I visit. To live and die in la. I got my fleetwood mac. I could get high every day. But I'd be sleepy, ocd and paranoid, so. Give me bali beach, no molly please. Palm, no marijuana trees. Yo hickeys on my aorta. And tattoos you could only see. When I'm playing surfboarder. Put whisky in that salt water. I emptied every canteen, just to wear. That straight edge varsity you think's cool. They thought me soft in high school. Thank god I'm jagged. Forgot you don't like it rough. I mean he called me a faggot. I was just calling his bluff. I mean how anal am I gon' be. When I'm aiming my gun. And why's his mug all bloody. That was a three on one?. Standing ovation at staples. I got my grammy's and gold. Polka dots on my brit. I'm not supposed to be stunting. It's all melodic this song. I catch this vibe in my sleep. But I'm just jet-lagged is all, and restless. All my dreams got more vivid. When I stopped smoking pot. Nightmares got more vivid. When I stopped smoking pot. And loving you is a little different. I don't like you a lot. I mean, fuck. I don't know what we're about. What good is west coast. Weather if you're bi-polar?. If I'ma need this sweater. I'd rather be where it's cold. Where it snows. I see how it goes. I put the flowers in bowls. I know they're coming in droves. You'll only miss when it goes. (yeah, I think that's it). When it goes"

It's good times, yeah. She wash my back three times a day. This shower head feels so amazing. We'll both be high, the help don't stare. They just walk by, they must don't care.

Close your eyes for what you can't imagine. We are the xany-gnashing. Caddy-smashing, bratty ass. He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag. And used the shit for batting practice. Adamant and he thrashing. Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed. Panic and patch me up. Pappy done latchkeyed us. Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough. Brash as fuck, breaching all these aqueducts. Don't believe us. Treat us like we can't erupt, yup. Polo sweats and Hermes blankets. Them label hoe's be stealing my shit. And all they clothes revealing they tits. Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch. We party in my living room. Cause father is gone. And he left me this empire. That runs on its own. So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want. All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want. We end our day up on the roof. I say I'll jump, I never do. But when I'm drunk I act a fool. Talking bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits. I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm. She slaps my head. It's good times, yeah. Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall. The market's down like 60 stories. And some don't end the way they should. My silver spoon has fed me good. A million one, a million cash. Close my eyes and feel the crash. [Refrão]. Real love, ain't that something rare. I'm searching for a real love, talking bout real love. Real love yeah. Real love. I'm searching for a real love. Talking bout a real love"

I never let a random mothafucka shoot the B-roll. I never ask advice from him cause what could he know?. Never fuck someone you wouldn't wanna be though. It forever seems like time's up. When we swerve in the Honda. Now forever seems like no time. I mean time flies when you have some. Both nuts weigh two pounds. all on your bitch like futons. My crew saved you crew. like niggas came through with the groupons. Cookin' with the grease down, couple fries and Cholula. Are you slowin' down? Are you holdin' down?. Whoever held you down. Whoever propped you up. Built the structures with you. Swished the buckets with ya. Who was fuckin' with ya?. Really brothers when you needed that?. When you seeing eye is a forced black. Hail Mary on a fourth down. Hands to the sky. [Verse 2]. Yeah, peace to the holy. peace to the people that think they know me. Peace to Moschino, cover your ass, your rectum showing. Peace to the boys that we used to be though. Geto Boy North Face too cold on these hoes. Peace out to Willy B, Bushwick Billy and Face. Piece of steak grillin' in Jesus' name, speakin' his grace. Hands to the sky. [Verse 3]. U-N-I-T-Y. Neptunes and peace signs. Chiraq, Palestine life. Hyper built 1995. You'd think that was airstrikes on outside. I put refugees in my villa. Play kids the Fu-Gee-La. All this space Atlanta. Place order McMansion and two apple pies. I want the Porsche, a Bugatti design. Silicon Valley, new venture is tits up. How do I crop your new bitch out my Vine?. Sick, blew nose, spit foamin' white like frapple, Jackal. El Chapo, defacto. Belle nacho, shell taco, crunch crackle. Green emerald. Pink diamonds like Apple Jack bull"
we all try,"[Verse 1]. I believe Jehovah Jireh. I believe there's heaven, I believe in war. I believe a woman's temple. Gives her the right to choose but baby don't abort. I believe that marriage isn't. Between a man and woman but between love and love. And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith. But you must believe in something, something, something. You gotta believe in something, something, something. [Hook]. I still believe in man. A wise one asked me why. Cause I just don't believe we're wicked. I know that we sin but I do believe we try. We all try, the girls try, the boys try. Women try, men try, you and I try, try, we all try. [Verse 2]. I don't believe in time travel. I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon. I don't believe our lives are simple. And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude. I don't believe my hands are cleanly. Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart. She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith. You must believe in something, something, something. You gotta believe in something, something, something. [Hook]. Try to believe (just try). I do believe I do believe. . . Alexandre Viana. Brasil"
white ferrari (feat. james blake & bon iver),"Bad luck to talk on these rides. Mind on the road, your dilated eyes. Watch the clouds float, white ferrari. Had a good time. 16: How was I supposed to know anything?. I let you out at central. I didn't care to state the plain. Kept my mouth closed. We're both so familiar. White ferrari. Close by me. You will find. You will find me. Is this the slow body. Left when I forgot to speak. So I text to speech, lesser speeds. Texas speed, yes. Based takes it's toll on me. Eventually, eventually, yes. I only eventually, eventually, yes. I care for you still and I will forever. That was my part of the deal, honest. We got so familiar. Spending each day of the year, white ferrari. Good times. In this life, life. In this life, life. One too many years. So taste what I lived on a facelift. Mind over matter is magic. I do magic. If you think about it it's over. In no time the best life. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. I'm sure we're taller in another dimension. You say we're smaller. And not worth the mention. You're tired of movin', your body's achin'. We could vacay, there's places to go. Clearly this isn't all that there is. Can't take what's been given. But we're so okay here, we're doing fine. I'm up and naked. You dream of walls that hold us in prison. It's just a scar. At least that's what they call it. And we're free to fall"
wise man,Wiseman closed his mouth. Madman closed his fist. Younk man shows his age. Judge man named it sin. Bad man don't exist no. No evil man exist. Good man don't exist no. No righteous man exist. Sad man cannot cry in place where man can see. This old man thought it weak. But strong man don't exist. No undying man exists. Weak man don't exist no. Just flesh and blood exists. But your mother would be proud of you. I bet your mother would be proud of you. The beast will crawl this earth. Then fall in the dirt to feed the crows. They'll rip apart his flesh. Til all that's left is glorious bone. So you'll bury your own. Too vain. You saw it unfold. What you know. And you claimed all you could hold. Until death did you apart from the mess you made. I bet your mother would be proud of you. I bet your mother would be proud of you. Primate sharpens tool. To survive and thrive in the jungle. Maybe hearts were made to pum blood. Maybe lungs were made for flood. I won't blunt my blade for cut these chains. Rather let my limbs be drug through mud. You're my brother but your eyes are cold. You're my sister but your womb is bare. I bet your mother would be proud of you. I bet your mother would be proud of you. Bad man don't exist. No evil man exists. I know good man don't exist. No righteous man exists. Strong man don't exist. No undying man exists. Weak man don't exist. No just flesh and blood exists
wither,"Oh where the trees burn down. Place where the fields went down in flames. You could put a hole in the ground. Oh, seasons dance for rain. It takes a mind to wander. Conscience to feel ashamed. There's no place to hide out here. These skies are filled with pain. And both our hands are filthy. Pointing up at the moon. Girl tonight I hold you close. Close enough to prove. Hope a garden grows. Where we dance this afternoon. Hope our children walk by spring. And flowers bloom. Hope they'll get to see my color. Know that I've enjoyed sunshine. Pray they'll get to see me, me wither (flowers). See me wither. Oh and I hope. Know that I've enjoyed the sunshine. (you know it happens all...). Know that I've enjoyed the sunshine. Know it happens all... all the time. Be, be, be. You know it happens all... all the time. All the time. Be, be, be. I'm gone. Be, be, be, be"
