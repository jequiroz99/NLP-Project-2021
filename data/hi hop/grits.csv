My life be like (yeah). [Chorus (over hook)]. It's times like these that make me say. Lord if you see me please come my way. Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray. Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid. Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip). Sometimes I fall I slip. My heartfelt desire be more like you. Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do. [Verse One: Coffee]. I'm on an island by my lonesome stranded. Low key and stayin' candid. Reflect on all the things I try my hand at. Church for the equations to persuasions I'm used to. Finding comfort in the zones of closet bones I get loose to. A mountainous fontaine. Spinnin' and monsoonin', grinnin' it's hign octane. Explosive how I came. Rollin' down hills cause lifes a hastle. Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle. Stay afloat, catch a second wind. Thin. Is the air I breathe. Teary eyed nose runnin' wipe the snot on my sleeve. I'm callin' on the Savior to be all that I need. Please forgive me my behavior had me lost at light speed. [Chorus (over hook)]. It's times like these that make me say. Lord if you see me please come my way. Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray. Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid.

The fear of never fallin' in love. And the tears after losin' the feelings of what you thought love was. Like the dirt still up under the rug (My life be like). Bad characteristics covered in Christs blood. The joy of new birth and the pain of growin' up. The bliss between givin' my all and givin' up. The highs and lows. Paths and roads I chose. In the cold I froze. Tryin' to ease my woes. In this world of sin. Clothes to thin to fend. So to God I send. Words of help to win. In grumblings so deep letters could never express. So the sound of Ooh Aah beneath my breath projects. [Chorus (over hook)]. It's times like these that make me say. Lord if you see me please come my way. Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray. Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid. Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip). Sometimes I fall I slip. My heartfelt desire be more like you. Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do. (Don't be bad). [Verse Three: TobyMac]. My life be like. Ooh Aah Ooh. Dum dum ditty. Here come that boy from the Capital City. Last up on the Grits new ditty. But eight bars or the truth well do (uh). I believe theres a private stunnin. And I believe in the Kindgom Comming. I believe if you seek the truth. You don't need to look far cause it's gonna find you. So why oh why do I trip and stumble?. And ooh aah as commitment crumbles?. I can't believe that I'm here again..... [Chorus (over hook)].

If we really wanted truth. We would give our lives for it. Walk in its direction of light. For God's glory. The saga continues. Cause most hearts are deceived. If we really wanted truth.

Anybody see the passion in my eyes?. this flip life, sorta stuff I observe. is often times triflin, throwin me a curve. Seem a little life been getting a little blurred. Lately my wife's been praying for me, word.. God, know I'm thankful for the blessings I receive. but who wants to give up what they want for what they need. A lotta things are promises, a lot are true indead. Some of ya'll ain't hearin me, let me bring you up to speed. Maybe we'll stop. Maybe the album will flop.

And even at home ain't nobody there?. But somebody's there. But nobody's there. Showing concern for the issues burning. The insecurity. And the fear internally. Poor self image with no real identity. Untapped potential. Unstable mental. Looking to escape from the trap you into. So you puffin puffin til you see the stars. Cuttin cuttin and you hide the scares. Poppin poppin til the pills are gone.

So bust what I'm swingin what I'm swingin when I swing. I rap when I rap cuz I never wanna sing. Go ask the last MC what happened when he said battle. I bust his ass in Cleveland now he's Sleepless in Seattle. Rude bwoy official comin with the ill grammar. Comin back on kids, like Joey Montana. We be the three MC's to make your mind go batty.

Once upon a mah-hah-hacking time. I received the opportuni-ties to represent my first rhymes. To define, lyrical sensations. Black masons blowin up the spot. Just to represent the Nations. Three dimensions, tryclops, Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes. Fat like a burger and fries. Mama-so-mama-saa-mamma-ma-ko-sah. Go back to the country to go check my grandmama. Eeeyah!! Bring it to the table at the meetings. Gathering large receivings delivering intellectual ass beatings. As I carry on with my proceedings. Greetings!! Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings. But before I be face to face with my eternal resting place. I hope you find civilized every soul and every race. Sit dog sit!. Busta Rhymes forever on that ultrasonic shit!"

they all fall down,"Blood curdling truth. Working the word in as proof. Besides mine the guidlines of righteous paths taken. Tremendous speaking, fresh out the kitchen. And never switching from the homegrown. Hole it down like the ozone. This is for the playa playa. Make ya holla holla. The kid with no morals. Sell his mama for a dollar. They all fall down. They all fall down. They all fall down. They all fall. I've compiled this alongside with bone. So you can file this under for the opposing a nihilist. Doubt what you know nothing about reactionary. Belief in the scripture's fulfillment are contrary. To popular belief. Hellbound in a basket. Sucking on their teeth. Wound up in a casket. At close, you froze. Already chose the doors you go trough. The life you chose to lead. Determines the place you go to. *hook*. To the naked, untrained eye. Who can't see time fly by. Revolving on a carousel. Living life like a modern day fairytale.... Slow mo', urgent message gets a no-go. What fo'. Can't nobody tell you. Everything is lovey dovey. Till your plans fall through.... They all fall down -x3-. They all fall. *coffee*. Lay it down flat. The ins and outs of this business. Oral with my morals. Things i say seem pretentious. Show change. I ain't deranged. To be looked upon strange. Like the dames in the verbs joint (shoot, we the factors). You ain't know neah. Rally all my troops in GI Joe gear. Arsenals and weapons abundant. Stop me if I sound redundant. *bonafide*. Sound redundant. Man please appease me. Repeat yourself. Most folks scared of the truth. Living lies. Fooling themselves and everyone surrounding. Deception of perception blind. To what self did deep down. Deep down beyond the black hole. of the soul in control. *hook*. They all fall -x2-. *bonafide*. I was surrounded by the darkness. Of the hearts of mens. Plots for spots to roll rovers. Controlling blocks and lots on top. Where I was charted to be. But failing to see truth. Behind the lies of eyes. Handling G's. They squeeze until my soul was unloaded. Holding to nothing. But folded bills. Concealed like weapons looking to kill. My mind filled. With thrills and pleasures. Life could offer. Walked amongst the dead. Laid to rest in a coffin. Nocturnal destiny. Leading to my eternity. Hourly concerning me. Yet I wasn't yearned. To be all of what. His calling said to be. And bred to be. Actually I thought it was all about me. Took for granted what was handed by the unseen. Invested all my time and effort. Building C. Appealing to my desires. And lustful feelings. Thinking I could make it by the grace of God. Straight disgrace the face of God. *hook*. They all fall -x2-"
ooh ahh,"[Hook]. My life be like. Ooh Aah (yeah), Ooh Ooh. My life be like (yeah). Ooh Aah, Ooh Aah (yeah), Ooh Ooh. Ooh Aah (yeah), Ooh Ooh. My life be like (yeah). Ooh Aah, Ooh Aah (yeah), Ooh Ooh. My life be like (yeah). [Chorus (over hook)]. It's times like these that make me say. Lord if you see me please come my way. Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray. Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid. Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip). Sometimes I fall I slip. My heartfelt desire be more like you. Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do. [Verse One: Coffee]. I'm on an island by my lonesome stranded. Low key and stayin' candid. Reflect on all the things I try my hand at. Church for the equations to persuasions I'm used to. Finding comfort in the zones of closet bones I get loose to. A mountainous fontaine. Spinnin' and monsoonin', grinnin' it's hign octane. Explosive how I came. Rollin' down hills cause lifes a hastle. Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle. Stay afloat, catch a second wind. Thin. Is the air I breathe. Teary eyed nose runnin' wipe the snot on my sleeve. I'm callin' on the Savior to be all that I need. Please forgive me my behavior had me lost at light speed. [Chorus (over hook)]. It's times like these that make me say. Lord if you see me please come my way. Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray. Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid. Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip). Sometimes I fall I slip. My heartfelt desire be more like you. Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do. [Verse Two: Bonifide]. The fear of never fallin' in love. And the tears after losin' the feelings of what you thought love was. Like the dirt still up under the rug (My life be like). Bad characteristics covered in Christs blood. The joy of new birth and the pain of growin' up. The bliss between givin' my all and givin' up. The highs and lows. Paths and roads I chose. In the cold I froze. Tryin' to ease my woes. In this world of sin. Clothes to thin to fend. So to God I send. Words of help to win. In grumblings so deep letters could never express. So the sound of Ooh Aah beneath my breath projects. [Chorus (over hook)]. It's times like these that make me say. Lord if you see me please come my way. Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray. Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid. Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip). Sometimes I fall I slip. My heartfelt desire be more like you. Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do. (Don't be bad). [Verse Three: Tobymac]. My life be like. Ooh Aah Ooh. Dum dum ditty. Here come that boy from the Capital City. Last up on the Grits new ditty. But eight bars or the truth well do (uh). I believe theres a private stunnin. And I believe in the Kindgom Comming. I believe if you seek the truth. You don't need to look far cause it's gonna find you. So why oh why do I trip and stumble?. And ooh aah as commitment crumbles?. I can't believe that I'm here again..... [Chorus (over hook)]. It's times like these that make me say. Lord if you see me please come my way. Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray. Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid. Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip). Sometimes I fall I slip. My heartfelt desire be more like you. Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do. It's times like these that make me say. Lord if you see me please come my way. Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray. Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid. Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip). Sometimes I fall I slip. My heartfelt desire be more like you. Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do. Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip. Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip. My life be like. Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip. Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip. Ma-ma-my life be like. Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip. Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip. My life be like. Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip. Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip. My life be like"
anybody,"Anybody.... Right now my heart is so heavy. I cry tears until I'm empty. I feel so alone, don't you hear me say?. I gotta break these chains. I gotta break these chains. anybody out there, anybody on the landscape. any-anybody? Am I talking to myself?. body-body Anybody. I need to rationalize. Anybody see the passion in my eyes?. this flip life, sorta stuff I observe. is often times triflin, throwin me a curve. Seem a little life been getting a little blurred. Lately my wife's been praying for me, word.. God, know I'm thankful for the blessings I receive. but who wants to give up what they want for what they need. A lotta things are promises, a lot are true indead. Some of ya'll ain't hearin me, let me bring you up to speed. Maybe we'll stop. Maybe the album will flop. Maybe we'll cop nice cribs on the way to the top. Maybe we'll stay right her in the jar remainers. Keep believing with the truth, leading a pack to fall. Right now my heart is so heavy. I cry tears until I'm empty. I feel so alone, don't you hear me say?. I gotta break these chains. I gotta break these chains. Have you ever felt alone like nobody cares?. And even at home ain't nobody there?. But somebody's there. But nobody's there. Showing concern for the issues burning. The insecurity. And the fear internally. Poor self image with no real identity. Untapped potential. Unstable mental. Looking to escape from the trap you into. So you puffin puffin til you see the stars. Cuttin cuttin and you hide the scares. Poppin poppin til the pills are gone. You drink the last drop til you in the zone. ...for the love complex. used and abused. bruised and confused. I'm gonna tell the truth. Ain't no substitute. That's ever gonna fufill the need inside you. Christ died for that. He left and came back. Flowed the powers sin and death alike. You can have life and get more abudant. No more questions, cap the wonderin. Right now my heart is so heavy. I cry tears until I'm empty. I feel so alone, don't you hear me say?. I gotta break these chains. I gotta break these chains. What you wanna know?. Where you tryin to go?. What you tryin to see?. Where you tryin to be?"

Replace it with lies. Use ignorance as excuse. It�s hard to conceive. What the mind can�t comprehend. And harder to believe. What the eyes can't understand. We look to theory, philosophies and thought. For a sure foundation. In a belief we once sought. While the shadow of truth. Cast an image so clear. The closer it gets. We reject it out of fear. If we really wanted truth. We would give our lives for it. Walk in its direction of light. For God's glory. The saga continues. Cause most hearts are deceived. If we really wanted truth. We would live and believe. So the saga continues. Cause most hearts are deceived. If we really wanted truth. We would live and believe in it. Everybody needs something to see. Something to feel.

comin' home,"Bonafied:. was put in the mix 'bout '86 and ever since I ran from. His plan to further mans understanding through. expansion of minds, heart, body, and soul controlled. by the deity of three formed as one. The son of prodigy me Bonafied the MC straight from. the Tenna the center fo my location of operations for. missions completions. Franklin my mental releases dime piece still. Nashville, Knob Hill, where I chill on the real. hittin' home.... Coffee:. Ponder the thoughts all the money spent on useless. things I bought. Afro wigs and Courtney Cox dolls. Framed pictures of Richard Moll Robbins sons. Like Holly, so thick you could drive a trolley through. my folly. Pardon me like Dolly in two halves same as the Red Sea. I glimpse the open hands instead of reprimand that fed. me. Said we can journey to places far off, thinkin' to. myself, "" first I need to drop my car off."". Chorus:. I'm comin' home Daddy. Make sure you keep the gate open. I'm loosened from all the worldly pleasure Daddy. I'm comin home Daddy. Meet me outside greet me with your. arms extended Daddy. I'm comin home.. Coffee:. Take and EPT so phat hope I ain't pregnant. To this nasty world that would be more entertaining. than Cedric. And I would be Dug-less like Fredric by all my peers. Purchase maternity gear at Sears. Succumb to all their jeers and their taunts. Shedding tears for all my wants and desires. Pray to God I'm absent when the world erupts with fire. Kevin Costner dances with flames with a dousing. Richard Pryor. Revelation called it everything is scalded.... Bonafied:. Kickin' up dust who could I trust. Rush like Paula Abdul cruel. This world served me sadness for acting the fool. My mind was a tool used for worldly occupation. Sleepless nights spent with my knees bent. Conversations with the upper case requesting strength. when opposition moved in with plans of ambush and. attack. At my weakest moments wishin' my life could be back. Under His will been left the thrill searchin' for the. path to the gate of my crib where my Daddy live.... Chorus. Coffee:. The smell of seals, a bird, and a monkey, mixed with. the stench of junkies best describes my kind of funky. Spunky spastic, your life can't be recycled so why you. livin' plastic. Your insides are all dirty, why does your outside. looks fantastic. Devil couldn't wait to get his hands on you. Conformed you, turned your gold to Ormolu, now shame. on you. Made a dame of you. You say, ""Whatever"" well the same to you. Splittin' like an atom, I got things to do.. Bonafied:. Do who, you me too?. My desires expired. Dismiss my riches stay in Heavenly clenched fists. Swiss account-type interest. No man's hands can touch. Uncorrupted with the pureness of innocence and such. Mind sets not in agreance with all of my peeps. Absence of scams for yams numbered in heaps knee deep. They cram to understand the faith of this man. Until then when comprehension of sin-free lifestyle lu. child.

don't try this at home,"""You Have Agreed, Not To Try This At Home. Anything Else"". [Proof]. Who am I?. I'm a basterd, I stolen off ya and blast at ya. Smokin' more blacks than the part time wars in Africa. I'll ?? out the martyrs for beef. Rest in piece alot of you reef(?) designing your greef. By snatchin' your brother, smackin' your lover. Paralizing your cousins, smokin' your mother's husbands. A dozen chosen showguns to shotguns. Roll up on you with no guns but still pop one. I bomb like napalm from the curb to your house. And ""Please God"" the last words out ya mouth. No affiliates, just dogs and troops. Most lyin' death than this morgue and roots. All we choose to beef, I bring spatulas. Flip it and throw it back at ya, so bring your gat with ya. Spectacular murder manufacturer, fuck binacular. Only heaters talkin, I'm trappin ya just to flattin ya. Hop in the accura, roll up on the back of ya. Chill out in 5, and then them niggaz act alive. I smoke branches from off the tree tops. I hang with real niggaz, PA's, PK's and Pete Rock. Y'all niggaz with pre-ops, spill blood and Reeboks. Don't discriminate blastin rookies on the e-box(?). Your streetforce envolves just for excitement. Like if you wasnt you never heard of enditement. I sum it up quick so that you can understand me. Fuck you, your crew, your bitch and your whole family. [Bizarre]. Bizarre's a villin, bitch I ain't illin. I'll pull your fucking head off while your ass is winddillin'. Go heads the triggers of the penot scott villian(?). Vericons(?) march, atleast shoot a million. Dirty Dozen the first week? at least a billion. If not, it's back to robbing and stealin'. Bizarre's the illest, the shitty is the worst. A thousand dollars for any nigga that can last longer than a verse. And what's the worst is I don't give a damn. Offer Garth Brooks a stolen grand am. Come to your record label, take all your doe. Take your rap name and have your manager booking you shows. I don't gove a fuck if we don't get along. Bitches know my name without the Slim Shady song, bitch... We in this bitch with DJ Butter. Who gives a fuck?. We in this bitch with Wallstreet and we don't give a fuck about nothing. ""You Have Agreed, Not To Try This At Home. Anything Else?"". [Royce Da 5'9]. Yeah yeah... What's my motherfucking name? Royce Nickle Nine. A messiah of all, much higher than y'all, undeniably raw. Quick to blow the fuck up and reform again. The bomb threat re-occured, re-warn your men. I promise you get toared up and re-torn again. Not one slur or word will be re-born again. As long as the shit cracks and they turn a loop up. I spit it until it's pitch black and burn the roof up. Better step the fuck up for the shit getting spit. Turns to whips getting lit, turns to tick-tick-tick. Niggaz be rapping just for the clubs, just for the love. That hit you had in the club sound like shit in the truck. That's why I love that nigga X, cause he raised my brow. With every rhyme, without having to take my style. It'll be a cold day in hell when these two soldiers lay in hell. Talk to me. [Billy Nix]. Billy Nix, I'm really sick of this silly shit. Rappers, get on the mic, swearing they're really spit. But you really fake, tough guy stop at your thirty-eight. Drop your gloves and get taped, stop with your murder rate. Alot of kids listening to you. Wishing they you, wishing they was in a position with you to piss on their crew. Buttfuck all your sickness, we got the medicine. I'd rather piss on the capital, shit on the president. X-Government, still flowing, still showing. I know where you niggaz come from, know where you niggaz going. We was all raised in the same dangerous cell. Understand I ain't a stranger to hell, I just don't like it. Rappers say the same thing getting retired. So I write something I like and pray that you bite it. Take an old gangsta rapper and make him retire. Take a young conscious rapper and keep him inspired. Black man, where you at man, take a stand. They taking this rap shit like they took our land. Fuck America that's right, you ain't hear me stutter. Wallstreet, Dirty Dozen with DJ Butter"

hittin curves,"V1. Coffee's verse:. Deadlocked in the zone, we prone to dip into the unknown. Quick to flip if one trip, first we break bread, then break heads. Look at all the people runnin' in fear, scared. Unwilling to hear what's said, hide under the shed. We lyin' in the filth, grown men layin' in our own beds. Pull ourselves up by the bootstraps. Hit them curves, dodge the trap. Don't move at a slow pace. Hand us a mic, we move the whole place. This for each and every hood,. Eighteenth Ave, Wedgewood, South side, clean cutz. Tell me who on it, tell me what you know that's good. Baller blockin' ain't an option, that ain't the purpose of my concoction. Releasin' toxins in the abyss, boxin' you in so you don't miss. Me gettin' you rockin', Nashville. Proud I'm in it, been a minute. Gettin' our due, me and my crew. Rep our city, how ‘bout you?. Hittin' curves!. Hook:. Hittin Curves, shorty, baby, ooo hoo. (Dipping in the ride, swerving in the ride). Bridge 1:. That's why we tell them. Swerving we ruling we serving. Hittin them curves and then we. Pushing them verses them curses. They must be broken yeah. Taking them Tennessee corners. And changing lanes cause they. Brought us enough contradiction. So now we change our position yeah, yeah….. V2. Bonafide's verse. I'm in LaVergne letting the Chevy burn rubber every turn. Changing lanes while the body swang heavy to the right. Like my life hit them curves swerve as I discern to turn. Back down the one way truth and the life. I learn lessons every block counting blessings like rocks. As I bubble in the struggle in the Classic Caprice. Releasing pressure like these woofers in the back of my seats. And speaking clearer than these tweeters when I'm over these beats. I check the navigation to see what direction to take. To lead a generation headed for collision with fate. On the darker side in the ride looking through rearviews. In full speed searching for a u turn to save you hittin curves….. BRIDGE 2:. Swerving hittin curves and serving. Pushing the verses for the curses. Must be broken so we focused. Stop sign and the place can't hold us. Taking them Tennessee corners. Changing lanes cause they brought us. Enough contradiction so now. We change our position yeah, yeah…."
hopes and dreams,"Oh hey, the way, my selectable delectable, break you. Off a twang 'cause my thang is respectable. Get in where i fit in, no secrets nothin' hidden. I check their heads bobbin' and throbbin' 'cause its. Written material, milkin' ya'll like cereal, ethereal. Messages, portrayal of my jesus christ i guess it's. Just the way i choose to use my chords to bring the. News. Instead of pain, i realize there's power in the name. Zzzt goes the lightnin'. it's cracklin' it's. Frightnin'. Much needed calling card to prevent from falling hard. Hittin' your head on pavement, you need to peep my. Wavelength. Precautious with the info, now why you livin' sinful?. Your nature's starting to swallow you. Your friends beginning to follow you. The devil's pullin' strings to demolish and abolish. You like fetus', his cohort- the roscoes and cletus'. Riot like carman with the intent of harmin'. Attacks in every area, deadly like malaria. And viruses, i can see the hurt in your iris'. Why was this turmoil aimed at me?. A curse put in reverse, i suspect aptly. Much thought is required in the question you just. Blurted. Take the script called your life, make some changes. And reword it. Take callin' with the bawlin', time is nigh to put. Asunder, scatter blunder. Fresh manna feeds the hunger.. Chorus:. Why you livin' on the chance for hopes and dreams. When you should be takin' life the way that it seems. Nothin' good will manifest, your still intent on being. Blessed. Why you livin' on a chance for hopes and dreams?. Recollections and memoirs of a pre-saved era, although. I waddled in the truth i still dipped in the devil's. Terror. Bad is bad, you could say i had my share of it. Doing nothing drastic, depending on how you stare at. It. Skipping down the road i see the signs ahead and then. Cadaver central opens once the flesh is dead. 'cause it's knowda not yoda don't toy when finding. Paths, then select the narrow 'cause the broad has. Booby traps. For me to fall in and all together miss my callin'. Snares placed strategically, realms changed. Metaphysically. Fools don't know and yet they really don't know, the. Failure to receive the wisdom stumps the inner mans. Growth. It's difficult to understand if you can't fathom the. Wrath i ask you-what if the rapture sweeps past?. In the end is only when you'll feel the strength of. The seven. Sorrow goes out for opposition-armagedon is the place. Where his kingdom will cross the lost and victory goes. Unto those who took the cross. So now i take my stand, subject myself to persecution. Since i've been informed i'm not alarmed by execution. In the public. Relationship with christ none above it, i love it. I'm mesmerized beyond infatuation. To show the love of christ tightens other relations. Waitin' in his midst to catch a glimpse of his glory.. Chorus. Yo change up that beat so they can peep my direction. To blood streams legal syringes of rhyme lectures. Infectious as wounds cleanse internal like prunes. Soon callin' his name some will still see doom. You assume, 'cause you mention him as lord of your. Life. On award shows and albums everything is alright. Who you? i never knew, say you did what for me?. But you can start now, depart now, worker of iniquity. Them shout outs, got you spat out quicker than cobras. Livin' beyond reproach until your sins found you broke. Breathless you choke and gasp. In his name you asked forgiveness of your past and. Aquital for your task. Ask me? you livin' on chances with lucky odds. Got one up, still breathin' frontin' with god. But the time has come don't miss the cue, be false or. True. 'cause them ""freak me baby, thanks to my savior"" days. Are through. Straight up, i'm tired of fakes that be claimin' in. The family. Granted, our mother's one but our fathers are know. Foes. So those who claim relations hope your life is the. Proof. Ain't no playin' with you. Spoke in love but in truth. And intents of being blessed and nothin' good is. Manifesting from your life man-you livin' on a chance. Of hopes and dreams."

life after mental,"I keep comin' at you. Lyrical raptures capture you. Only if your soul is ready. I comin' after you. Bodysnatchin' you and dismantlin' your crew. It's Tennesseeans wit nouns and verbs agreein'. Wit higher being. Sendin' messages. Spreadin' through your chest it's just. Blessings from conception rearrangin' your perception. This planetary lyricist. At least that's what the Source quotes. Resurrectin' hip-hop on a higher plateau. We crept low. Movin' slow with intention to blow. Carry loads of flows for those who doubt and didn't know. And circumstances deep in crime intense seat back in the. Center of my body structure. Ready to rupture. At times I sat back to think again and again. How I broke the golden rule by doing business with friends. My mind traveled paths on a search to be free. Suspicion felt corruption had a piece of Gotee. Success had me stressed like the G-Mo-B. Cee-Lo's verse on ""Thought Process"" was the description of me. But them again I caught the vision that was given within. As a child rockin' mirrors wishin' I was Rakim. On stage. Engagin' state to state. Rampages, airplay, videos, and stretch black limos. The dream that seemed impossible. But now I'm doin' show for thousands. Savin' souls through least. Lacin' spirits concrete. And the belief that I inject on beats. Deplete. God's word that is instilled in me. To the masses 'til I feel my mission here is complete. And it's essential. That this is my life after mental. [Chorus x2]. Mental's over. It's the dawn of a new day. Out with the old. Different messages to relay. Mental's gone. It's time to do it up again. The past is behind. Life after will begin. [Coffee]. Now let's talk. Gather to see who can talk the most noise on an album. You the listeners decide the outcome. How come. It's our second record without Mental... gettin' the recognition it deserved. This Christian industry is gettin' on my nerve. Serves us right for thinkin' they would believe our vision. Give us proper support. But when it got hectic. Mission abort. Poor sports is what they called us. Now that's crazy. All cause we wanted to be pushed. Not ambushed and pulled. Off the shelves for being ourselves. Unlike no one else. But still they made comparisons. How Un-American. Strivin' in the midst of warzones and red tape. They try to hold us back. But it's the black in me that makes me create. Colorful collages hang on the walls of garages. No mirages. What you see is what you get. Ah, that's that hit. Ah shoots you know I'm in cohoots. With the higher power. Sprinkle me with spirital showers. Drinks anyone. Pourin' glasses of Tang. If you're drinkin' from me, the flavor's lemon meringue. I'ma be me despite the shackles of the industry. Bump they last chances. God engineers my circumstances. And hey. I think I like that. He's the one I confine in. Never dealin' shady and lettin' the enemy slide in. This rap game is all I got to maintain. It keeps me sane in my life. After mental. [Chorus x2]"

man's soul,"The more I meditate, I hesitate to even show face. The more I hesitate, I contemplate my life is a waste. My spirit levitates to take a glance at truth of its grace. As my flesh emulates every act of disgrace. So deceptive in perception of its hunger and greed. Maliciously relentless to fulfill whatever it needs. Undisciplined, rebellious, no regard for righteousness. Ever since it tasted death, he desires nothing less. Too many nights I spent in tears, drowning in fear. I’m never making it, through all the time I spend faking it. My soul is proving capability and prone that when alone. Without the father’s consecration flesh manipulates. Constantly, continual battles might end up being goes through. Why do I do the things I know I’m not supposed to. Why don’t I do the things that I know I should do. Who s to blame except me and me alone. I found my enemies home. (Chorus). What could it inhibit a habit. the dark corners lurking. demonic principalities when other evils working. you can’t escape fate, allow what’s in your heart to tailgate. you’re your only cellmate to unlock what locked the jail gate. (2X). Somewhere inside the crevice, I long to face the limits. The premise is death for execution of flesh. past no authority and so control the tree of life. I chose, taking shape of its mold. Indulge in fruit too, whatever you do, I do, we crew. Give it unto a city, evil, not for me, you you. Doom can’t loom if I no longer give it room zoom a zoom. You’re free to explode for miles with a loud boom. Perfect tightly I hold with no attention. To foe toe to toe and low to low, flow to flow I stand firm. Learn to discern, circumstances are changed. Do a dance with death, til my soul’s last breath. When I’m at my hardest. Can salvage my image tarnish. What can make me whole again. The blood of Jesus. Freed a deed. Down the slanted hill I ski high speed. Manage to get bandaged when I got tree. (chorus). What lies in a man’s soul…. I found that evil doesn’t have a face, so let alone a place. It just lingers in the void over an open space. Searching out a victim. To nuzzle up against, take under its wing, and habit, then reign supreme. Think it control, it slowly conquers a man’s soul. Behold real TV, even real is when it takes its toll. Unfold, with those punches, you don’t have to roll. Toss yourself at the cross, and escape the devil. More vibrant than the radiant redhead. W/ flashlights, the fingers, the illuminated words of Christ. Put that on ice for a spell, pray tell, how in the world do you excel in the glory of God, and then rebel. Letting death valley give you a fear falling down. It will only breed your fears when you allow it to hang around. So get down, hit knees where prayers don’t cease. What’s lurking probably shouldn’t even be working"

Naw girl, chill, it ain't even like that. I know them other brother's frontin' on their motives. in fact, I used to be like that a long time ago. Sunday school mack pushin' up on ever sister in tact. At the choir show dipped in silk clothes like a pimp. With gold chains danglin' polo scent stranglin'. A wolf in sheeps clothing in the mold of crooked. preachers usin' pick up lines like, ""Let me touch and. agree wit cha"". On the subject matters in life you found to be your. weaknesses ignorance revealed and I used them as my. strength. On occasions in my game I'd spit the truth to get. closer to you abussin' trust from desires of lust. So watch your back sisters don't be victims fallin'. like prey. Caught in traps when Jack the Ripper crosses. boundaries you lay. If his display is not the essence that of Christ in. your sights. He very well may be seduction your destruction in life. (Reverend Pimp Daddy baby).... Chorus. Coffee:. ( Nothing's real anymore, what's everything fake for?. It makes more doubt engulf the stance we chose to take. Slimy, slithering snakes raise the stakes. RRRRRaaaa, time for GRITS to make the ground quake. ).... Falsehoods, deceptions, wool pulled over eyes. Dazed and hypnotized by facades and lies. Corruption breedin' hounds of Hell, bounds and spell. Disastrous endings you wolf in sheep's pretending. Offending I find your accolades to be gut wrenching. Ripping me inside due to the lifestyle tried. I'm hittin' on all the flimsy-handed, limp-wristed. Complicatin' life from simplistic not lashin' out to. be sadistic. But my Bible totally contradicts your kind of sickness. My Lord destroyed whole cities for your type of. wickedness. You people are getting me stressed with your bessed. dressed contests. Gainin' noteriety in Christian society. Not fly to me. I know what's goin' on opposite of what you try to be. People are talkin' and what you do reflects on all of. us. A hypocrital Citadel is what they callin' all of us.. Chorus"
next,See it's not that you ain't fine. It's just that I ain't interested. Yep you guessed it I'm the result of a love that never lasted cause lust was always present. I was hoping by the way I dressed and ignored your previous attempts that it would be evident that sweet talk leaves a sour taste in my mouth and there's no substance behind the shallowness of your arrogance.. Yo--Coach gives me the impression that you think I would find it a privilege that you extended a compliment my way. All I can say is your affirmations or confirmation's not revelations that I'm the one to be pursued--brother I thought you knew.. Yeah you're fine but good looks and tight gear won't get my time nearly as fast as a man who's got enough insight to see beyond my Coke-bottle figure and enough vision to make me believe without “priority's' not a bed buddy but a soulmate.. Time's a tickin I have no more to waste on little boys or Usher-like confessions. But that Mac-daddy garbage you just recited you're my carnal curse not a spiritual blessing. Fine men before your time taught me this lesson and now I'm the one teaching you how to treat me and those young girls who are following unknown that a fine man makes them no less beautiful or deserving of. Better. More. God's best. No less. I'm sorry about this for sounding rude. Next

Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid. Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip). Sometimes I fall I slip. My heartfelt desire be more like you. Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do. [Verse One: Coffee]. I'm on an island by my lonesome stranded. Low key and stayin' candid. Reflect on all the things I try my hand at. Church for the equations to persuasions I'm used to. Finding comfort in the zones of closet bones I get loose to. A mountainous fontaine. Spinnin' and monsoonin', grinnin' it's hign octane. Explosive how I came. Rollin' down hills cause lifes a hastle. Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle. Stay afloat, catch a second wind. Thin. Is the air I breathe. Teary eyed nose runnin' wipe the snot on my sleeve. I'm callin' on the Savior to be all that I need. Please forgive me my behavior had me lost at light speed. [Chorus (over hook)].

The fear of never fallin' in love. And the tears after losin' the feelings of what you thought love was. Like the dirt still up under the rug (My life be like). Bad characteristics covered in Christs blood. The joy of new birth and the pain of growin' up. The bliss between givin' my all and givin' up. The highs and lows. Paths and roads I chose. In the cold I froze. Tryin' to ease my woes. In this world of sin. Clothes to thin to fend. So to God I send. Words of help to win. In grumblings so deep letters could never express. So the sound of Ooh Aah beneath my breath projects. [Chorus (over hook)]. It's times like these that make me say. Lord if you see me please come my way. Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray. Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid. Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip). Sometimes I fall I slip. My heartfelt desire be more like you.

Last up on the Grits new ditty. But eight bars or the truth well do (uh). I believe theres a private stunnin. And I believe in the Kindgom Comming. I believe if you seek the truth. You don't need to look far cause it's gonna find you. So why oh why do I trip and stumble?. And ooh aah as commitment crumbles?. I can't believe that I'm here again..... [Chorus (over hook)].

I'm Starsky with no Hutches.. Coffee:. The Ave. I travel is congruent to dope. my speech is fluent, wassup?. Uprisin' vocal tone. Mesmerizin' verbs and vowels dig so deep into your bowels. If I skip devotions throughout the day I'm thirstin' like Howell. Stay contained, be a trooper like Isuzu. Prophesied many times of God's plan, ""Let him use you"". In an instance I reached the distance to eternity. devil dreamin' of burnin' me. Dream on demon-ic oppressor. Sit on shoulders like coins on the dresser. The lesser has upgraded to elegance big as elephants. Worldwide universal. antagonist dispersal. Hits front page what more could you ask for?. Chorus. Coffee:. What you know about Hypocrisy?. The leaven of a Pharisee. Stare and see rapture passed you up, too busy watchin' me. Meticulous motions feed ridiculous notions-what's he hiding. Dissecting my articulate potions, commotions abound. Judging the sound while my inner gets beat down to its last compound. Chaotic try to find answers to my questions, oh I got it. Addin' advanced melodic robotics with the deity. meetin' me with promise of never playin' us rock me Amadeus. The educating I'm preachin' the Gospel 'til everyone's relatin'. Your scating on thin ice. I rock once and then twice all by myself on my. own-isn't that nice?. I had to get live. On my own, on my own. Proof that I rock. On my own, on my own. But it's kinda' scary. On my own, on my own. Lord overshadow me.. Chorus"
one two shit,"Intro: Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Busta Rhymes. One two, one two. One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (3X). Yo it's the Q-Tip, you know I get down. Yes I rock to the rhythm of a funky sound. It go. One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (2X). And it's the, Phife Dawg, and I do the same. And when it comes to rippin mics aiyyo it ain't no games. One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (2X). Aiyyo you know it's Busta Rhymes, ev-ery time. Oh yes, I'm comin wicked with the new design. I'm sayin. One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (2X). Verse One: Q-Tip. MC's ain't coming equipped with the rhymes. Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. The time is eternal when you play with the miser. Soul is in my body, and the health make me wiser. The tantalizing wordplay yeah that's the joint. Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point. Brothers need to come, with better, compositions. I write, and recite, to make, good position. In this, rap game here, we en-gineer. Stabbin up the jam yeah son shit's clear. And I be kickin rhymes in my own damn way. Beatin niggaz to the punch like Sugar Ray. Got the cool-ass style, that's cooler than the cool. My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool. Peace to C-Seventy-Three, and C-Seventy-Fo'. Do a little somethin when I'm out on tour. Comin thru like narcotics for the antibiotics. Flappin shorty's stockings to the Space-like Sprockets. What you really need to do is just boogie your ass. It's not gassed, we got to make the good times last. Let the good times roll, cuz we in control. Take you out on your high less you payin a toll. Let the good times roll, let the good times toll. Take you out on your high less you payin a toll. Verse Two: Phife Dawg. Question. Why is that, MC's be wack. And major labels wanna sound like crap. Aiyyo Funk Dat!. Word to life I'm comin rugged. Cuz once you add the hip to the hop kid, it equals out to love. If the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it. Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks Renuse it. Put down the mic kid, cuz you gets no dap. How long did it take for you to see you can't rap. The name is Phife Dawg, and I got nuff style. It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild. So bust what I'm swingin what I'm swingin when I swing. I rap when I rap cuz I never wanna sing. Go ask the last MC what happened when he said battle. I bust his ass in Cleveland now he's Sleepless in Seattle. Rude bwoy official comin with the ill grammar. Comin back on kids, like Joey Montana. We be the three MC's to make your mind go batty. Mad play, on WKRP in Cincinatti. So lord send a hon, if ya kyant send a han sen a man. An if ya kyan sen a man, come yaself. Cuz all deez bitin MC's, lawd dem somethin else. See I kick the styles that'll make ya ass melt. Money on my mind so never mind a trick. New York is the town and the team is the Knicks. World's greatest five footer rippin parties apart. Here comes Shaheed with the big green shark. Never had to rhyme about feelin what with lead. NEVER MIND DAT MON HERE COME DE DREAD. Verse Three: Busta Rhymes. We comin farrrr farrrr farrrr. Busta Rhymes is comin farrrr farrr farr. ya know ya hear me Star!. Bet your bottom dollah. Right after this jam about one million one two niggaz go follow. Whether it be to-day or to-morrow. Niggaz be collaboratin sickening. you beat them like they father. Ohhhhh shit check out what I saying. Ah-hah ah-hah ohhhhh ah-hah ah-hah. You know my niggaz don't be playing. Once upon a mah-hah-hacking time. I received the opportuni-ties to represent my first rhymes. To define, lyrical sensations. Black masons blowin up the spot. Just to represent the Nations. Three dimensions, tryclops, Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes. Fat like a burger and fries. Mama-so-mama-saa-mamma-ma-ko-sah. Go back to the country to go check my grandmama. Eeeyah!! Bring it to the table at the meetings. Gathering large receivings delivering intellectual ass beatings. As I carry on with my proceedings. Greetings!! Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings. But before I be face to face with my eternal resting place. I hope you find civilized every soul and every race. Sit dog sit!. Busta Rhymes forever on that ultrasonic shit!"

Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid. Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip). Sometimes I fall I slip. My heartfelt desire be more like you. Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do. [Verse One: Coffee]. I'm on an island by my lonesome stranded. Low key and stayin' candid. Reflect on all the things I try my hand at. Church for the equations to persuasions I'm used to. Finding comfort in the zones of closet bones I get loose to. A mountainous fontaine. Spinnin' and monsoonin', grinnin' it's hign octane. Explosive how I came. Rollin' down hills cause lifes a hastle. Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle. Stay afloat, catch a second wind. Thin. Is the air I breathe. Teary eyed nose runnin' wipe the snot on my sleeve. I'm callin' on the Savior to be all that I need. Please forgive me my behavior had me lost at light speed. [Chorus (over hook)].

The fear of never fallin' in love. And the tears after losin' the feelings of what you thought love was. Like the dirt still up under the rug (My life be like). Bad characteristics covered in Christs blood. The joy of new birth and the pain of growin' up. The bliss between givin' my all and givin' up. The highs and lows. Paths and roads I chose. In the cold I froze. Tryin' to ease my woes. In this world of sin. Clothes to thin to fend. So to God I send. Words of help to win. In grumblings so deep letters could never express. So the sound of Ooh Aah beneath my breath projects. [Chorus (over hook)]. It's times like these that make me say. Lord if you see me please come my way. Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray. Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid. Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip). Sometimes I fall I slip. My heartfelt desire be more like you. Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do. (Don't be bad). [Verse Three: Tobymac]. My life be like. Ooh Aah Ooh. Dum dum ditty. Here come that boy from the Capital City. Last up on the Grits new ditty. But eight bars or the truth well do (uh). I believe theres a private stunnin. And I believe in the Kindgom Comming. I believe if you seek the truth. You don't need to look far cause it's gonna find you. So why oh why do I trip and stumble?. And ooh aah as commitment crumbles?. I can't believe that I'm here again..... [Chorus (over hook)]. It's times like these that make me say. Lord if you see me please come my way. Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray. Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid.

Warrin' with the enemy, abstaining from his wickedness. Notice, I hassle with, I wrestle with anxiety. Knowing that certain things I can't change about society. So I put this in my diary, which I keep hid' inside of me. I'm silent empty handed. ‘cause that life is not the way that I planned it. Lost my mom and dad left me stranded. So I pained it. Felt abandoned even though my gran' was handed all the hurt. ‘n' felt like I was just a burden. Closed the curtain I was naked. Started smokin' and drinkin', tryin' to maintain restraint. I used to think that maybe Jane would ease the pain.

Make a request – not mine but thy will be done. Attach a conscious to examples that was left by the son. And I pray against the day when strictly fame is what I'm drinked in. And corner stones are built in I no longer put my faith in. That's my greatest fear, if I took that route. To feed the flesh until it's diesel while the spirit fizzles out.

where r u going,"Bonafide:. yo. you wanna know why we do this. we keep speakin these verses. in purpose of breakin curses. with persicutional surface keep tryin to. put us in hearses it seems. even the churches been blinded for recognizin our talent. its part of the plans of God reachin man. understand so many searchin, understand so many hurtin. flirtin with death , and slowly closin the curtain on hope. to find a better way, a brighter light and darker days. strike the spark to start, and burn a bluer blaze. maybe we missed it but um, what if we didnt these drums. maybe the difference is needed for when it sums. so i dedicated my body to be the sacrifice. livin and the beat it copywrite writen to raise dead. and the course read led by be sweat. which is to be the beacon they seakin, when somethin has gotta give. so eternal existance is not a tellital mistant. but a reality of faith, believin in He, recievin through me.
