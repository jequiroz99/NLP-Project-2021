I like the way you do that shorty (uh). Now can you do somethin' for me. [Chorus]. I can't, stand here and watch her dance. She got me comin' outta my pants. And i dont wanna miss my chance, to jump on her. If i could, get her outta here i would. I never seen a girl move that good. And there's something tellin' me i should. Get Low!. [Verse]. Yeah... I'm in the 2006, brand new wagon. Lookin' for a diva to handle a dragon. And even if there's two of um, i'ma move in and bag um. Make sure i'm strapped, keep the Uz and the Magnum. Yeah the gun talk, but i'm talkin' 'bout the condom. They followin' me home with my dog right behind um. Have you ever seen a ass clap on a stallion. Another bad bitch half black and italian. I dont know if she likes me or my medallion. You think i give a fuck, i'm just tryna get a nut. I dont need no-one to build my self-esteem up. Im fresh out the hood, but fuck it its all good. Why you can use me, cuz i'ma use you. For menage-a-twage, you know the usual. And if you do me maybe i'll do you. A favour and walk you outside, rightt. [Chorus]. I can't, stand here and watch her dance. She got me comin' outta my pants. And i dont wanna miss my chance, to jump on her. If i could, get her outta here i would. I never seen a girl move that good. And there's something tellin' me i should. Get Low!. [Verse]. Naa, i aint ever aite pussy before. But im close to the edge if she pushin' me Lord. Her body language is that a nigga stiff as a sword. So she cant be a angel this bitch is a fraud. Head prolly took a nigga on a trip to the morgue. Pussy good enough to drive out the Michigan Ford. As soon as i hit the door she's squeezin' my arm. Hoppin' all on a nigga like Christina Milian. It might take a couple rounds to make me get to calm. But when she does go to sleep she might need a alarm. Cuz i'm gone, she wanna be with a don. But i'm stuck so i'ma keep it about me on a song. Aint nothin' wrong, with a lil' bumpin' and grindin'. Especially if they got somethin' behind um. Im high as hell, pussy drunk when i climb in. How a nigga unfortunate i'm in. [Chorus]. I can't, stand here and watch her dance. She got me comin' outta my pants. And i dont wanna miss my chance, to jump on her. If i could, get her outta here i would. I never seen a girl move that good. And there's something tellin' me i should. Get Low!. [Verse]. Shorty looks like she's datin' a fashion designer. Damn, she musta got that from her momma. You know me somewhere in the back with the Llama. Keeps one of the cats with the drama, i'ma. Get a lil' closer to her, ma look so sweet. She remind me of a lot of broads aint Monique. But a bird nigga tryna holla, they all speak. Do you write up her phone number down, they wont keep. Lemme get her, i have her burnin' Haze all week. Givin' me wop to the music, mine plays on beat. Yeah, i'm so street, i'm so cheap. I'm so fly, but you already know that i. Dunn been all around the world, they dont know that guy. But lil' man gon' talk to, i oppose that i. He just mad that he aint got the kinda clothes i buy. All ride in the U.F.O i drive. [Chorus]. I can't, stand here and watch her dance. She got me comin' outta my pants. And i dont wanna miss my chance, to jump on her. If i could, get her outta here i would. I never seen a girl move that good. And there's something tellin' me i should. Get Low! (low, low, [echoes])"
karma,"[Chorus]. I am the one you denied. Pushed me off everytime I tried. But Im alright. Im able to swallow my pride. And put all the bullshit to the side. If your ready to ride. Im down for a one night stand. Ill accept it any way that I can. Cause I aint yo man. Ill try for what ever its worth. Just remember who played who first. [Lloyd Banks]. I cant keep my eyes off you. I can tell why them other guys lost you. Your kinds rarer then a flying saucer. And thats why I can offer. Similarities in our characters. Havent ya heard the word around town. How I get down. They all whistle. Every bodypart is official. And that ass withchu got my dick hard as a missle. Dont hop on top. Cuz I ride around with a pistol. If they pull us over Ill be out of town with a issue. If you was mine, Id introduce you momma girl. Your style and your boots are Gabana. Im so used to your Prada. I take trips cuz out in Houston its hotter. Throw on that Al Green and use the Impala. Make my jewels on my collar. Ya had me feelin like a fool when I hollad. Tryina squeeze in but you wouldn't bother. And I aint either. Soon as I realize that I ain't neither. She in a rush to get close to me but I aint eager. Shiiiit. [CHORUS]. [Lloyd Banks]. Look I dont mean to bother you. But your sex appeal is remarkable. You make a G wanna walk around in the park witchu. There aint no tellin the kinda things Ima start to do. If I get wrapped up on your ass too fast. I can tell you feel the same cause when I ask you laugh. So Ima leave it at that. Take a hint and put in my math. I imagine your body look twice as good in the bath. And Im buggin. Cuz I can see you right in the hood when I pass. Im never stable cuz business is on my ass. But you can be the one that I visit before I dash. And I admit I been the type to hit and split. But you cant blame me for the females that I been gettin wit. Cuz mosta these broads has had they eyes on my grit. Til they eat this shit and learn to be satisfied with the dick. and If you aint worth it - thats all you get. I aint gonna blame you, Ima blame all you tricks. Cuz. [CHORUS]. [Lloyd Banks]. Its seems like your attitude, only appears when Im mad atchu. And several situations occur and that includes. When Im going too long, ridin through them avenues. As soon as I get home theres rumors and scattered boos. You know my fantasies. Am I feelin things? And can this be?. Your girlfriend tryina sandwich me. My hearts colder than sandwich meat. Cuz I come from the hood where the hammers be. I move fast but I switch pace. And pop a listerine strip in. Before you get all up in the bitch face. Movin your body like this. Gonna make me blow like a bottle of Cris. Man I dunno. No, and how did it twist. Ya got my temperature risin. From your hips and your thighs. And that glare in your eyes'll brighten up the horizon. It comes naturally, I dont bribe em. Its easy as one,two,three and I slide in. [Chorus 2x]."
warrior,"Lloyd Banks - Warrior Lyrics. (Warriors! Come out to Pla-a-a-y!). I'm a warrior!. Aw man I never run never snitch. I'm a grown man dog I ain't no bitch (A warrior!). Don't change cause he's rich. Before I shit on my family I lie in a ditch. Don't fold under pressure. You got a shell waitin in the hole if they test ya (A warrior!). I'll sacrifice it all if he has ta. React and think about it after. Uh, You heard right motherf**ker. My grandmama' daughter ain't raised no sucker. Heart full of pride and a head full of anger. Attitude of a winner infared for the danger. Even the paranoya of a female'll change ya. Waking up every morning laying next to a stranger. I'm on the move, smooth, with one eye out for the snakes. Who can't stand hearin your name all throughout the states. Tune into BET and watchin your video. Pretending to be your friends but the smart ones really no, so. If that's your man warn him. 'Cause there's enough bullets in here to hit every NBA patch on. him. Nigga ride 'til I die the song I sing. You ain't ready for the war I bring. You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing. And I ain't ever scared I'm a warrior!. [Chorus]. Man I never run never snitch. I'm a grown man dog I ain't no bitch (A warrior!). Don't change cause he's rich. Before I shit on my family I lie in a ditch (A warrior!). Don't fold under pressure. You got a shell waitin in the hole if they test ya (A warrior!). I'll sacrifice it all if he has ta. React and think about it after. I'm a warrior!. Goddamn hoe here I go again. The Double L O Y D. Here put on an I.V. Tryin ta try me. The new age I lead. The black C.I.G. Resides beside me. As smooth as an Isley. Sometimes I surprise me. Can't even ID. As low as my eyes be. I roll with the gangstas don't get fly with your mouth. The wrong punchline'll have niggaz inside of your house. Nigga I'm doing good I made it out of the hood. I own Beverly Hills no more bottles or wood. That's a zipper that's sticky. California should whip me. I done made it this far can't be mad if they hit me (shhiit). Nigga ride 'til I die the song I sing. You ain't ready for the war I bring. You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing. And I ain't ever scared I'm a warrior!. [Chorus]. Man I never run never snitch. I'm a grown man dog I ain't no bitch (A warrior!). Don't change cause he's rich. Before I shit on my family I lie in a ditch (A warrior!). Don't fold under pressure. You got a shell waitin in the hole if they test ya (A warrior!). I'll sacrifice it all if he has ta. React and think about it after. I'm a warrior!"

So take off your coat, your hat and funny boots. I can?t tell you they names, i just know they loose. Off a mixture of cranberry and the goose. A lil runnin in thats at least a hundred proof. Shorty eyes wide from the Bentleys and the Coup√© She cant stop starin so she trippin off the stool. And ima playboy i might as well tell her the truth. you tryna menage-twat or hit the booth. I got a big pool in the room with bathing suits. See I can go swim, though I get it in. I?ll show you how to make a million dollaz with a pen. I drink champagne and pop bottles when I spin. I cant complain the top models in the Benz. My wheels is shining, like theres diamonds in the rims. Just give me a day or two im climbin in the friendz. I do what I wanna do cuz.

Nobody will care, theyll forget you in a week. I rather go in there with a swisha with a freak. And get a lapdance while I listen to the beat. Shes puny and petit I can lift her off her feet. If she gives me the spur, you know im fuckin her. Im iced out so she dont see nuthin but a blur. Be careful where you rub dont get nuthin on the fur. They know we got the things so the drama dont occur. You front cuz u drunk, yo ass gettin jumped. Im high off the funk, dro, hash and the skunk. But then the niggaz dump yo ass in the trunk.

"warrior - part. ii (feat. eminem, 50 cent, nate dogg)","(feat. Eminem, 50 Cent, Nate Dogg). [Intro - Eminem]. Remix [echoes]. Lloyd Banks! [echoes]. Ha ha! [echoes]. [Verse 1 - Eminem]. It's like a throne that he dont even own. He wont sit down, given the crown he just throws it around. It's like a joke he's like a king, but he dont rule a thing. He dont want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry. He dont want the fame dont want the lute he's in this for a sport. Runnin suckaz with the competition round the court. He appreciates your support but he aint beggin for it. And you cant love it you can hate it but you cant ignore it. You cant be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short. But you cant fuck with his last joint or the one before it. And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys. And if I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it. [Chorus - Nate Dogg]. This Is The Story Of A Warrior U Kno U Kno It. Tru Warrior Go Ahead Make Some Noise. It aint healthy To Be Makin Niggaz Paranoid. Hit Ur Corner Wit More Weapons I Dont Need My Boyz. Im Doin About 120 On The Fast Lane. Kick Back Just Relax Let Me Do My Thang. Dont Give a Fuck About You Suckas Gotta Maintain. Money Power And Respect In This Rap Game. [Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks]. He's straight outta the neighborhood but Niggaz hate. They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate. Your stomachs ache while he's loungin at the big estate. And he hops in a 100 thousands with a Nigga's gate. House with just a bigger gate , houndin him was a big mistake. He wont surrender he'd rather give up a rib to break. Cuz he horrendous when they wouldnt lend a helpin hand. So he was sittin on green like a Celtic fan. Created a buzz so when you gotta mention his name. When you discuss him the illest playa that's in the game. And he's ridin with Em, 50 cent, Doc and them. G Unit records aint no motherfuckin stoppin them. [Chorus - Nate Dogg]. This Is The Story Of A Warrior U Kno U Kno It. Tru Warrior Go Ahead Make Some Noise. It aint healthy To Be Makin Niggaz Paranoid. Hit Ur Corner Wit More Weapons I Dont Need My Boyz. Im Doin About 120 On The Fast Lane. Kick Back Just Relax Let Me Do My Thang. Dont Give a Fuck About You Suckas Gotta Maintain. Money Power And Respect In This Rap Game. [Verse 3 - 50 Cent]. These niggaz got A Lot of Nothin. So those niggaz from the hood act like we owe em somethin. They talk crazy til we send this nigga in there to fuck em. Ask 'em if theres a problem and they'll say naw its nothin. He's been tryin to help em out, but since they fronted, fuck em. He dont care how they feel theyre makin em love em. He hold it down on his own the kid is really thuggin. He's rich now, he aint change since these Niggaz buggin. He pull a clip everything Niggaz try to buck him. Keep ya pistols on ya hip I show you we aint tuck em. Niggaz say they gon' get at him but they cant touch him. Try to catch em slippin, they creepin and he start bustin. [Chorus - Nate Dogg].

I can give you somethin' you can talk about. I can turn this smile upside down. You ain't no G-Unit fuckin' clown. I can take your girl until I turn her out. The bootey layed all out. I can give you fuckin' somethin' to be mad about. And buy her rings and I back out. With my DNA all in her mouth"
smile,"[50 Cent]. Yeah, this somethin special y'know, somethin epic. Lloyd Banks, you know. Cause a nigga thuggin don't mean he don't. Don't wanna see you smile baby. [Intro: 50 Cent]. Wooo! he wanna be the reason you smile. he wanna be the reason you smi-ile. he wanna be the reason you smile. After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes. [Verse One: Lloyd Banks]. I'm gettin the feelin you wanna take revenge. From the conversations we have and the way it ends. You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends. That's why it's just me in my Mercedes Benz. It all depends, maybe if we make amends. We can start from scratch. Learn to control your temper and relax in fact. We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact. So everytime we seperate, somebody's marchin back. You're amazing in the sack. Eyes slanted like you're Asian, but you're black. God Bless whoever gave you all that. If you seen her from the back. You'd understand why this feel like that. And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows. Her pussy good enough to miss award shows. And I ain't gotta say nothin, she just knows. By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes. Up and down. [Chorus: Lloyd Banks] + (50 Cent). even though I'm not around, and you feelin down. Let the thought of me be ( be the reason you smile). I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown. I wanna bring you joy and be ( be the reason you smile). Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down. I provide by any means to be ( the reason you smile). We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while. I'm just happy I'm around to be ( be the reason you smile). [Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]. The main reason I been lookin at you pitiful. What about the half of this shit I done did to you. Violated and took tip toed into a crib or two. I've come clean to be a bigger individual. Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you. Kinda makes me feel lucky, cause I see niggaz. when you tease 'em with your physical. She wanna rack up her brooms, I ain't got no more room left. Wild drama, section 8 princess. My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed. plus it's hard to communicate. Cause she don't speak-a no english. I been around the world state to state. But now I'm back bustin in your bathroom. Got you laughin in your shower cap, let's get it on. Cause I'm leavin in a hour flat but it don't matter she's mad. Even when I holla back. All I really need your attention for a while. And, I bet you I can make you smile. [Chorus] - 2X."

Booty breast thighs keep ya boy relapsin back. And you deserve way more than that, I?ll just fall back. [Chorus: Jeremih]. I think I love you, don?t let me get in the way (Get in the way). Don?t let me stop you girl, from doin your thing (Doin your thing). ?Cause I don?t deserve you (NO!). I don?t wanna hurt you, play with your mind.

But when you stop, the only thing still spinnin is your hair. Yeah, I'm ridin with that all black snub. Raiders cap back, all black gloves. I'm 80s man, but the boy smack thugs. These record sales equal more back rubs. Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs. His impacts about as raw as crack was. Now all these new artists gettin wrong deals. I'm only 21, sittin on mill's. (Chorus - 50 Cent). We on fire. Up in here, it's burnin hot. We on fire. Shawty take it off if it get to hot, up in this spot. We on fire. Tear the roof off this ma'a'fucker, light the roof on fire.

Niggaz know I'm a G, got it locked got the keys. We move from bundles to D sippin' on Hennessy. Buck rollin' the trees, Banks countin' the cheese. We get the paper then breeze, nigga we overseas. You stuck in the hood, aw that ain't good. Different town, different tour, different telly, different whore. Triple X, wet sex, who's next, latex. Condom, condo, I'm tight my money long though. You lookin' for a drink bitch I ain't what you lookin' fo'. [Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. You already know, my mind is on my dough. A millionaire that won't spend a dollar on a hoe. I'm still in here tryin to get a model out the do'. High blowin bottle after bottle of that dro. Slidin on the road, groupie in my vehicle that I don't even know. And If I wasn't Banks shorty probably wouldn't roll. From the Benz to the lobby from the lobby to the do'. If you ain't with the program ma you gotta go. [Verse 3: Young Buck]. I'm out on bond but the forty still on me. Bouncin 'round like Lil' Jon thinkin 'bout my dead homies. Watch I hit, need a lick, ain't 'gon get me a brick. I keep on losin shootin' dice and I'm sick of this shit. Clientele still poppin' so the junkies keep comin. And my neighbors is watchin' but we still gettin' money. On this block 'till the sun drop I don't have a home. I will not stop, sellin' rocks, thug 'till I'm gone. Got a couple old schools and some iced out jewels. Some G-Unit shoes body full of tatooes. 'Bout to stomp me a bitch, put the pump to his lips. Tell him talk that shit, now y'all wanna trip. I keep it dirty on the East Coast dirty on the West. Just a dirty lil' nigga with a glock and a vest. Banks tell me you don't like 'em and you know what I'm a do nigga. [Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. You already know, my mind is on my dough. A millionaire that won't spend a dollar on a hoe. I'm still in here tryin' to get a model out the do'. High blowin' bottle after bottle of that dro. Slidin' on the road, groupie in my vehicle that I don't even know. And If I wasn't Banks shorty probably wouldn't roll. From the Benz to the lobby from the lobby to the do'. If you ain't with the program ma you gotta go"
we all die someday,"[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. Niggas Know what I'm about out here. I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to. You can run your mouth I don't care. but if you get too close I'm gonna clap you. It's too real out here to be scared. A real nigga is gonna do whatever he has to. A man is the last thing you should fear. it ain't considered a crime unless they catch you. We all die one day. [Obie Trice]. Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna loot. like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook. Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and. let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper. hand. I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga's. moms. shoot up clubs and destroy nigga's vibes. everybody running for their motherfucking lives. Tough club niggas, we leave early, cock back surely. open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city. pave. your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z. O's an animals skirts get mirked. don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt. don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard. trust in guard it cause you're about to catch a bullet. scar. I give a fuck where you from who you be with. keep this a secret right by the nuts. a 4-5 that'll light niggas up and this 4-5 high make. me not give a fuck. [Chorus]. [Lloyd Banks]. But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks. and make my cash stretch longer than giraff necks. poverty will make your ass bet on words. touch niggas in jail make them wanna finish their last. sents'. they say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga. gun. if that's the case then get a bigga one. you don't think I pack the pump cause I'm out of the. hood. that's a stereotype like everyone that's black can. jump. I where a white mink, the fabric is done. got rings that bling like Mike, Byrd, Magic and them. out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from. living lavash, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come. I'm the clouds you won't see me in the trains. I travel first class you don't even got a TV on your. plane. You should be easy on my name, cause I don't going. back and forth. your boss and your captain's soft. [Chorus]. [Eminem]. We gonna bring it to anybody who want it. you want it? you gonna get it. man we gon hit em, chew em up and spit em out. too much venom and if you role with 'em. we gonna fuck you up with 'em. I got too much momentum movin in my direction to lose. my shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in 'em. (BROOM). you know how we do it when we do how we do it when we. come through. G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assasins. ski masks and gloves consider this as a warning. disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just. ask Muggs. but we are fizast, fuck your litte bitch ass up. we are not killers, my vato will have you shot though. drag through the varrio and fucked like Kim Osario. litte sorry hoe ass, go ask B Real. we burn source covers like fuckin Cypress Hill. did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still. shady records you better believe the hype is real. this is no joke, I don't smoke. but I toke enuff second hand to make my fuckin P.O.. choke. I'm an OG, you're fuckin with a GI Joe. Bia Bia, mia meo a vida loco. I'm a psycho, Mariah aint got shit on me. when I retire I'll be spittin baby food on people. a tent sieged on her ranch, huddled up next to her. with Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs. you ever had your cat pealed back or your shit pushed. in. I put my blade in your like a fucking pin cushion. slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Henn dogg. I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog. Nobody told you that I'm loco essay?. I lack every sane chemical in my membrane. I'm slim sha...dy and the ""d"" is for deez nuts. and you can get each one for free so feast up. I pee in a cup for three months, I'm having an E party. for easter please come. [50 Cent]. We gonna bring it to anybody who want it. you want it? you gonna get it. man we gon hit em, chew em up and spit em out. too much venom and if you role with 'em. we gonna fuck you up with 'em. you can do all them push ups to pump up your chest. I got a 12 gauge mossbert to pump up your chest. have you gasping for breath after that shell hit your. vest. fear me like you fear god cause I bring death. Silverback gorrilla in the concrete jungle. I'm the strongest one around you know how I get down. I watch gansta flicks and root for the badguy. and turn it off before it ends cause the badguy die. if you trying to buy guns I'm the nigga to look to. so what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new. you can raise your voice like you fending to touch. something. when I raise my knife shit I'm fending to cut. something. see I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie. if the bitch think I love her the bitch don't know me. (haha Sorry Kim haha). [Chorus]. [Eminem]. Souls Assasins y'all. What up Muggs?. [DJ Muggs]. What up Em?. [Eminem]. We outta here..."

99 lines,[Lloyd Banks:]. Aight nigga. Ya'll ain't safe. [Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]. You'll never find another nigga with a flow like this. I got 99 lines to break a ho down with. A red beam in the club'll make the whole crowd shit. I got the grizzlys on me like Stronoun Swift. 40 blue vest on me cause I took some once. Round here its like that even the shook ones dump. Bandana on my neck in case I do something dumb. Cause a motherfucker will tell the blue where I'm from. When I slide through the spot hos huggin' and stare. Rocks glare. Like I got a lightning bulb in my ear. I got a zip of that Gueedo bud. And the fifth that'll drop a mean old slug. Directly in ya sunroof you'll see no blood. Just a big bright light like you've been hit by Mike. If I see something I like. I'm a get about three. Cause if it ain't about money then it ain't about me. [Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. Nigga you should move the way that we move. Keep ya pistol on you everywhere you ride. The sooner you realize the sooner you'll see. You don't wanna bump into a nigga like me. Maybe you should roll the way that we roll. Keep ya gun on ya everywhere you go. The sooner you realize the sooner you'll see. You don't wanna bump into a nigga like me. [Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]. These niggas all grown up and they still frontin'. Which means every nigga with a tear drop ain't kill something. The system in the trunk got the track and the grill thumpin'. Yayo on my right i'm in the back of the wheel stuntin'. Bitches know i'm only tryin to fuck and they still jumpin'. Niggas know I got the 40 on me and will dump 'em. I'm probably 'gon retire on pay day with two cribs. The same all from the Kay Slays and Whoo Kids. You wanna know I bring AKs where you live. One in ya stomach'll vacate a few ribs. Dog i'm focused so even if I slip off beat i'm right back on before ya notice. Niggas is broke. We pass 'em in the big body Rovers. Rap fiends my sixteens is Coke for ya noses. I don't argue with bitches that only adds me stress. I toss a bitch out the mansion like she Jazzy Jeff. [Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. Maybe you should move the way that we move. Keep ya pistol on ya everywhere you ride. The sooner you realize the sooner you'll see. You don't wanna bump into a nigga like me. Maybe you should roll the way that we roll. Keep ya gun on ya everywhere you go. The sooner you realize the sooner you'll see. You don't wanna bump into a nigga like me

Its like crack to an addict. It aint to hard for me to grab it. Going with this kinda music puts me right back on the block, block. [Banks]. Uh man i think im addicted to the life that i had. So i risk it runnin the street with the heat boy. Three deep in the suv the bigger u blow the less you see. The more u hear a real nigga lost his life right there. Its hard to believe a flippers the reason he\'s not here. Damn and still get killed over somethin that aint his. And jeapordize the well bein of him and his kids. Thats how it is cigs in old cribs dudes that tote pigs. Live with broke ribs or went under the dirt with the worms. The results of the colds pack funeral homes. U know the names cause we tatooin em on. Im gone just cruisin back 2 in the mornin. So fuck rap im comin at you in the song. When you hear the (click clack) point it at you n your gone. [Musiq].

Going with this kinda music puts me right back on the block, block. [Banks]. Ey i got my pockets right my rocks are bright. The drop is blue n the watch is white. Right thats why they watchin me. As far as i can see its all mockery. And im tryna be all i can be. Now that my foots in the door theres no stoppin me. Pure poetry i got a little pac in me. Now internationally they jockin me. Cause my money green n blue like monopoly. Yea i left a name all around the globe. Yet still southside i was brought up by the code (southside). N i was told everything aint gold its cause the glitter. And had to drown the pain with the liquer. The world dont turn unless the money move. The early bird get the worm and the dummys lose. True u hear the struggle and the grind when i talk. I breathe and i bleed new york. [Musiq]. I think i gotta have it. Its keeps pullin me in like a magnet. Going with this kinda music puts me right back on the block, block. Its like crack to an addict. It aint to hard for me to grab it. Going with this kinda music puts me right back on the block, block"

Go ahead try n do me harm soldier. You'll be in a black bag like grass out the lawnmower. And I'll be damn if I co-sign a old snitch. That was gang bangin when jaws was a goldfish. I'm the name they all screamin on the street. For bullyin the bassline and leanin on the beat. I'm well known now so you see me on the creeps. Schemin on a freak fan blade leanin on a jeep. Ain't walkin with the fire. So if you say banks in ya verse then you better be talkin bout Tyra. From PA to LA, Atlanta to Texas, Nashville to Memphis. My buzz is tremendous, I pass through the city slow. But the hit the gas on the silly hoe. Dumps like ass in my video. [Chorus - Lloyd Banks]. Aint no click like the one I'm with.

(A'yo banks let me put some work in, its been a while). A'yo, uno, duexo, troiso, quatreo. My clique eat like the 12 holy apostles. And bust down models in flushed out tahoes. Jewels froze look like we hit the lotto. P89, my clique filled wit hollows. Stun in the club get hit with yellow bottles. Don't speak ma, if your neck don't swallow. Cuz 50 push bentleys and Dre push Diablos. That Eminem money got cash in my eskro. Screws Mcduck say swimmin in my cash flow. Yay rappers cracked man I got the best blow. Best flow, Banks put me in the booth lets go. Think like castro, games in the lasso. Don't jump in the Benz without steps on the petro.

breathe freestyle,"Your boy sick. So move or the germ might touch ya. I'm at the rucker, burning them trees up like Usher. When I teach you how to rap fam. I'm in that black van. Like Air Ones and Canaries the size of Pacman. Who gives a fuck if it's our brawl. Cuz my dog got the windows from the 24-Hour slawg. I'm on the verge of flippin. Lord send me a sign, before I empty this nine, and leave the board drippin. Me and 50 are like Michael and Pippin. Ryu and Ken, whoever you send, I'ma rip em'. I'm added to society, mainly wit my system. Run and put em' in the truck, like a kidnapping victim. I'm papa so they pushin me harder. My associates got interior motives like wishin his father. I figure, I rather play wit these blades before i pass. Build a ballcourt, and go buy Bentleys to go to crash. I'm headed towards my prime. Wit metaphors and mines. And I compliment my momma wit pedacures and wind. I'm nine for nine, the rap Einstein. Pound for pound. I'm Tyson a.k.a Icyin. Message for the record. I ain't sleepin for a second. So even if i make it theres tool under the pillow. I'm brought up, to the V wit a poolish from the window. I'ma smoker, so the brokas won't leave us wit the Indo. I'm always wit a pair, before the crew looks for the bimbo. A dead meats in ur daughter. I'll fuck her and won't support her. I'm matching on the pedal. Smile from ear to ear. Middle finger in the air. Before I catch her eye. Keep rydin behind your tens fuck. Niggas don't know no Denim. They'll rob you for the rhinestones and your pimp cup. They goin off of we say. Niggas is runnin off from my buzz, fatser than Jamaicans in the relay. I'm blowin the cush, driving lazy in the lane. Yelling money ain't a thang. Like Jay-Z and Jermaine. About 80 on the chain. Like Brady wit the aim. I'm the same. Whether the Mercedes or the train. And I may be on a plane. By the end of the night. But it's aight. Tho, I might throw. I'm rich off a Mic Hoe. My stamina's low. X-Rated is my type so. I keep the crib packed in, no telling where it might go. Living room, dining room, bedroom, bathroom. Upstairs, nuts smared all over your Sasoon. Ya on that fly shit. That Southside shit. Thet I'ma sit on these ten million before i die shit. I'm from the block where the heafers be. To doing shows out in Pinkston when they rocking where your peppers see. And being gangsta ain't enough. A lil' nigga that's stuntin will put a killa in a box like Chuck. CHEAH!"

celebrity,"I just touched down, Ferrari to concrete. I ain't even home and they're talking about me. Fuck out my ear if you talking 'bout freedom nigger. Free don't pay the bills Im ballin' all out, b!. You rappers don't know me. Nah I ain't your homie. If your name aint Em, Ferrari or Tony. I like my wheel chromey. My Bentley my Rolly. My Magnum my forty. South Jamaica shawty. These losses I took in the gut yo. The work's still here, I'm just cooking it up slow. Clear my mind, you whippin' the truck load. My Pop dead, but he live through his son though. If rap aint work, I'll be pimpin' on some hoe. Still eating lobster and shrimp in the Bungalow. I'm back like crack over the drumroll. You know, wherever I go the gun go. We on the grind (hey) all the time (hey). Ain't bout to let a nigga come and snatch mine. I keep a nine, you see the shine. I might just let your ass slide this time. While I get this paper, paper. While I get this paper, paper. Cause I'm a celebrity. (I don't need none of y'all). Ghetto celebrity. (Keep your punk-ass awards). I'm a celebrity. (Take your fake smile off). Ghetto celebrity. Aint nothing changed nigger. The media will test ya, popularity is pressure. Porche Panamera. Platinum hammer through the metal. Wreck the booth up, I'm too tough. That inner city grammer. Step your jewels up, they bruised up. I'll sparkle for the camera. Harsh reality's what (?) holding them back from opening. Verbal attack all over these niggas, push the herd to the back. I'm the kind that they pray on, spending half of their day on. Lay on, niggas for days, just shots spray on. My sound system knock and in pound Tupac. 6-4 jumping like the ground too hot. They spot me, they chase a nigga down two blocks. Two shots in the air for niggas that aint here. Two tone, two door, grey top, roof floor. Green guap galore, in and out of new hall. That bright light you saw, was a paparazzi flash. I'm tryna snap a picture through your Maserati glass. We on the grind (hey) all the time (hey). Ain't bout to let a nigga come and snatch mine. I keep a nine, you see the shine. I might just let your ass slide this time. While I get this paper, paper. While I get this paper, paper. Cause I'm a celebrity. (I don't need none of y'all). Ghetto celebrity. (Keep your punk-ass awards). I'm a celebrity. (Take your fake smile off). Ghetto celebrity. Aint nothing changed nigger. ?there are enough insults in my head. To fill up a swear jar. And have it overflowing so dont get me going, don't dare start. You'll never see me again, Amelia Earhart. I'm poppin' a wheelie off to a really unfair start. I'm past grinding for me, guess I just be grounded up. Like ground round or a pound of chuck. Tightly wound as fuck. Till the fire marshalls come shut. Fire marshall ground 'em up. I guess you should just shut the fuck up. And stop fucking around and duck. I aint playing this time, I told you I'm not down for blunts. To say I keep it 100 would probably sound redundant. Like calling a bitch a hoe, or asking a gal to suck. And blowing your dick cock. Is she up to scew and down to fuck. It's a man's World and I'm trapped in a land of smut. With a thousand sluts wrapped with muzzles. Running through a house of muts. Otherwords I'm shutting up everyone one of you bitches mouth's up. And I'm watching my language if I tell you to kiss my fucking butt. And aint shit changed, my shit still dont stink player. My farts may have become staler ever since I became a trailer park celebrity. Maybe my complexion became a little paler. Poster job for white trash, I'm a garbage pale kid sailor. Yeah, see me up all in your bitch means I'ma rape her,. All I got for these hoes is dick duck tape and a stapler so bitch you better look for table scraps to scrape her. I don't subscribe to the news or the free press but homie I get the paper!"

A product of everything that made the apple rott. This apple jacks, way long before the platnium plaques. The pro-tools and the wax. Take a step back before ya catch a contact.

Im on recline while my next CD climb. South Side greedy dine, red wine, DB 9. NYPD grind, why?, it aint a easy grind. A nigga try to get mine ima feed him nine. And its graffiti time, niggas sprayin your mural. For tryin to be a muthafuckin hero. Im fresh, fly and flashy, best guy if you ask me. Jet by on em nasty, nigga you in a taxi. I cant wait. Alot of shit has changed since i came. Yall done came around here fuckin up the game. Therefore i aint servin nuttin but the pain. You playin, im hungier than a mothafucka man.

Shout out to my momma she done made a poster child. So much style I can lend you niggas some. Money longer than the list of shit you've never done. My shawty waist thin but her hips are hella dumb.

It's been three weeks since you've been looking for your friend. The one you let hit it and never called you again. 'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamin's. You act like you ain't hear him then gave him a little trim. To begin, how you think you really gon' pretend. Like you wasn't down then you called him again. Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin‚Äô him. If you did it then, then you‚Äôd probably fuck again. Talking out your neck sayin' you're a Christian. A Muslim sleeping with the gin. Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in. Who you gon' tell when the reprocussions spin. Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend. Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again. You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine. Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem. Baby girl, respect is just a minimum. Niggas fucked up and you still defending them. Now Lauryn is only human. Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament. Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn.. It's silly when girls sell their soul because it's in. Look at where you be in hair weaves like Europeans. Fake nails done by Koreans. Come again. Come again, come again, come again, come again. Guys you know you better watch out. Some girls, some girls are only about. That thing, that thing, that thing. The second verse is dedicated to the men. More concerned with his rims and his Tims than his women. Him and his men come in the club like hooligans. Don't care who they offend popping yang like you got yen. Let's not pretend, they wanna pack pistol by they waist men. Crystal by the case men, still in they mother's basement. The pretty face, men claiming that they big men. Need to take care of their three and four kids then. They facing a court case when the child's support late. Money taking, heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men. The sneaky silent men the punk domestic violence men. The quick to shoot the semen stop acting like boys and be men. How you gon' win when you ain't right within. How you gon' win when you ain't right within. How you gon' win when you ain't right within. Come again. Come again, come again, come again, come again. Girls you know you better watch out. Some guys, some guys are only about. That thing, that thing, that thing. guys you know you better watch out. some girls, some girls are only about. that thing, that thing, that thing"

Looking at the crew, we thought we'd all live forever. You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got. Looking back. Lookin back, Lookin back, Lookin back. You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got. Looking back. Lookin back, Lookin back, Lookin back. Drill teams on Munn street. Remember when Hawthorne and Chancellor had beef. Moving Records was on Central Ave.. I was there at dancing school. South Orange Ave. at Borlin pool. Unaware of what we didn't have. Writing my friends' names on my jeans with a marker. July 4th races outside of Parker. Fireworks at Martin stadium. The Untouchable P.S.P., where all them crazy nigga be. And car thieves got away through Irvington. Hillside brings beef with the cops. Self-Destruction record drops. And everybody's name was Muslim. (Children grow and women produce and). Sensations and '88 attracted kids from out-of-state. And everybody used to do the wop. Jack, Jack,Jack ya body. Nah, the Biz Mark used to amp up the party. I wish those days, they didn't stop. Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been. Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem. You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got. Looking back. Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back. You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got. Looking back. Lookin back, Lookin back, Lookin back. Lookin back,Lookin back,Lookin back. (To end)"
everything is everything,"Everything is everything. What is meant to be, will be. After winter, must come spring. Change, it comes eventually. (2x). I wrote these words for everyone. Who struggles in their youth. Who won't accept deception. Instead of what is truth. It seems we lose the game,. Before we even start to play. Who made these rules? We're so confused. Easily led astray. Let me tell ya that. Everything is everything. Everything is everything. After winter, must come spring. Everything is everything. I philosophy. Possibly speak tongues. Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist. Rap this in fine linen. From the beginning. My practice extending across the atlas. I begat this. Flippin' in the ghetto on a dirty mattress. You can't match this rapper / actress. More powerful than two Cleopatras. Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti. MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti. My rhymes is heavy like the mind of Sister Betty. L. Boogie spars with stars and constellations. Then came down for a little conversation. Adjacent to the king, fear no human being. Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum. Now hear this mixture. Where hip hop meets scripture. Develop a negative into a positive picture. Now, everything is everything. What is meant to be, will be. After winter, must come spring. Change, it comes eventually. Sometimes it seems. We'll touch that dream. But things come slow or not at all. And the ones on top, won't make it stop. So convinced that they might fall. Let's love ourselves then we can't fail. To make a better situation. Tomorrow, our seeds will grow. All we need is dedication. Let me tell ya that,. Everything is everything. Everything is everything. After winter, must come spring. Everything is everything. Everything is everything. What is meant to be, will be. After winter, must come spring. Change, it comes eventually"

I ain't him, matter fact shorty, I ain't them. They ain't me, they ain't been none of the places that I've been. Look girl, I'm tryin' to win (ha), How 'bout you?. You still dreamin' about your dream house? How 'bout two? (two). If you don't get the big picture you can hop out boo. I'm not just seein' eyeball, I'm here to see ya blue. And this ain't about no other females, just me and you. Be real, I'm seein' through. Everything you tryin' to do, so. If you a topic, you don't wanna try to do fo'.

Celebrity bitches is worse than the ones around the way. I'd rather come from the A, she's been around the K. Around the drug--scene, gimme fake pounds and hugs. Congratulations mami, you done found the thug. Bandana, diamond studs, man shuttin' down the club. I hand her the swisher, she knows how to roll the killer. Around my dice games, 'cause it's cee-lo when she flow a.. (cee-lo). I think I found her, I ain't gone jump the gun. Hop the fence, with a couple reasons in my defense. Look I done hardly took a chick to the movies. Let alone plane trips and jacuzzis, you speedin' (speedin'). I need a reason to say them 3 words when I'm leavin'. Believin', ya mine to myself. Man, listen. You must thinkin' I'm lyin' for my health. Okay, it's time to put my attention to someone else. [Chorus]. You lookin' for somebody with some money. That'll fly you 'round the world.

ex-factor,"It could all be so simple. But you'd rather make it hard. Loving you is like a battle. And we both end up with scars. Tell me, who I have to be. To gain some reciprocity. See, no one loves you more than me. And no one ever will. Is this just a silly game. That forces you to act this way. Forces you to scream my name. Then pretend that you can't stay. Tell me, who I have to be. To gain some reciprocity. See, no one loves you more than me. And no one ever will. Hook:. No matter how I think we grow. You always seem to let me know. It ain't workin'. It ain't workin'. And when I try to walk away. You'd hurt yourself to make me stay. This is crazy. This is crazy. I keep letting you back in. How can I explain myself. As painful as this thing has been. I just can't be with no one else. See I know what we got to do. You let go and I'll let go too. 'Cause no one's hurt me more than you. And no one ever will. Repeat Hook. Care for me, care for me. You said you care for me. There for me, there for me. Said you'd be there for me. Cry for me, cry for me. You said you'd die for me. Give to me, give to me. Why won't you live for me. (Repeat)"
final hour,"I treat this like my thesis. Well written topic. Broken down into pieces. I introduce then produce. Words so profuse. It's abuse how I juice up this beat. Like I'm deuce. Two people both equal. Like I'm Gemini. Rather simeon. If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it. You can't stop it. Drop it. Your whole crew's microscopic. Like particles while I make international articles. And on the cover. Don't discuss the baby mother business. I been in this third LP you can't tell me, I witness. First handed I'm candid. You can't stand it. Respect demanded. And get flown around the planet. Rock Hard like granite or steel. People feel Lauryn Hill from New-Ark to Israel. And this is real. So I keep makin' the street's ballads. While you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad. You could get the money. You could get the power. But keep your eyes on the final hour (x2). I'm about to change the focus. From the richest to the brokest. I wrote this opus. To reverse the hypnosis. Whoever's closest. To the line's gonna win it. You gonna fall tryin to ball. While my team win the pennant. I'm about to be in it. For a minute. Then run for senate. Make a slum lord be the tenant. Give his money to kids to spend it. And then amend it. Every law that ever prevented. Our survival since our arrival. Documented in the bible. Like Moses and Aaron. Things gon change, it's apparent. And all the transparent gonna. Be seen through. Let God redeem you. Keep your deen true. You can get the green too. Watch out what you cling to. Observe how a queen do. And I remain calm readin' the 73 Psalm. Cause wit all this on I got the world in palm. You could get the money. You could get the power. But keep your eyes on the final hour(x2). Now I be breakin' bread sippin Manichevitz wine. Pay no mind party like it's 1999. But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine. Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bind. Now I'm a get the mozzarella like a Rockerfeller. Still be in the church of Lalibela. Singing hymns a cappella. Whether posed in Maribella in Couture. Or collectin' residuals from off the Score. I'm makin' sure. I'm with the 144. I've been here before this ain't a battle this is war. Word to Boonie. I make salaat like a Sunni. Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community. Had opportunity went from. Hoodshock to Hood-chic. But it ain't what you cop. It's about what you keep. And even if there are leaks. you can't capsize this ship. Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip. You could get the money. You could get the power. But keep your eyes on the final hour"
forgive them father,"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us. Although them again we will never, never, never trust. Dem noh know weh dem do, dig out yuh yei while dem sticking like glue,. Fling, skin, grin while dem plotting fah you,. True, Ah Who???. Forgive them father for they know not what they do. Forgive them father for they know not what they do. Beware the false motives of others. Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers. And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you, to you. They say all the right things to gain their position. Then use your kindness as their ammunition. To shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do. Forgive them father for they know not what they do. Forgive them father for they know not what they do. Why every Indian wanna be the chief?. Feed a man 'til he's full and he still want beef. Give me grief, try to tief off my piece. Why for you to increase, I must decrease?. If I treat you kindly does it mean that I'm weak?. You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets. I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek. But I try to keep it civilized like Menelik. And other African czars observing stars with war scars. Get yours in this capitalistic system. So many caught or got bought you can't list them. How you gonna idolize the missing?. To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition. Even when they comin' gunnin'. I stand position. L's known the mission since conception. Let's free the people from deception. If you looking for the answers. Then you gotta ask the questions. And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto. Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto. Why black people always be the ones to settle. March through these streets like Soweto. Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus, Jesus and Judas,. Backstabbers do this. Forgive them father for they know not what they do. Forgive them father for they know not what they do. It took me a little while to discover. Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers. Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves. A friend once said, and I found to be true. That everyday people, they lie to God too. So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you. Forgive them father for they know not what they do. Forgive them, forgive them. Forgive them father for they know not what they do. Forgive them, forgive them. Gwan like dem love while dem rip yuh to shreds,. Trample pon yuh heart and lef yuh fi dead,. Dem a yuh fren who yuh depen pon from way back when,. But if yuh gi dem yuh back den yuh mus meet yuh end,. Dem noh know wey dem do,. Dem no know, dem no know, dem no know,. Dem no know, dem no know wey dem do"
freedom time,"[Singing Chorus]. Everybody knows that they're guilty. Everybody knows that they've lied. Everybody knows that they're guilty. Resting on their conscience eating their inside. It's freedom, said it's freedom time now. It's freedom, said it's freedom time now. Time to get free, oh give yourselves up now. It's freedom, said it's freedom time. [First and only verse]. Yo, there's a war in the mind, over territory. For the dominion. Who will dominate the opinion. Skisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion. Conformin' our vision. To the world churches decision. Trapped in a section. Submitted to committee election. Moral infection. Epedemic lies and deception. Insurrection. Of the highest possible order. Destortin' our tape recorders. From here and like under water. Beyond the borders. Fond of sin and disorder. Bound by the strategy. It's systematic deprivaty. Heavy as gravity. Head first in the cavity. Without a bottom. A fate worse than Sodom. What's got 'em. Drunk of the spirits. Truth comes, we can't hear it. When you've been, programmed to fear it. I had a vision. I was fallin' in indescision. Apollin', callin' religion. Some program on television. How can dominant wisdom. Be recognized in the system. Of Anti-Christ, the majority rules. Intelligent fools. PhD's in illusion. Masters of mass confusion. Bachelors in past illusion. Now who you choosin'. The head or the tail. The bloodshed of male. Or confidance in the veil. Conferences of Yale. Discussin' doctrines of Baal. Causin' people to fail. Keepin' the third in jail. His word has nailed. Everything to the tree. Severing all of me from all that I used to be. Formless and void. Totally paranoid. Enjoy darkness as the Lord. Keepin' me from the sword. Blocked from mercy. Bitter than cerasee. Hungry and thirsty. For good meat we would eat. And still, dined at the table of deceit. How incomplete. From confrontation to retreat. We prolong the true enemies defeat. Destitute a necessity. Causin' desperation to get the best of me. Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me. Realizin' the unescapable death of me. No options in the valley of decision. The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision. Inwardly only water can purge the heart. From words, the fiery darts. Thrown by the workers of the arts. Iniquity, shapen in. There's no escapin' when. You're whole philosophy is paper thin. In vanity. The wide road is insanity. Could it be all of humanity?. Picture that. Scripture that. The origin of man's heart is black. How can we show up for. An invisible war. Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore. Achin' in sores. Babylon, the great mystery. Mother of human history. System of social sorcery. Our present condition. Needs serious recognition. Where there's no repentance there can be no remission. And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam. The atom bomb, and Saddam, and Minister Farakkhan. What's goin' on, what's the priority to you. by what authority do we do. the majority hasn't a clue. We majored in curses. Search the chapters, check the verses. Recapture the land. Remove the mark from off of our hands. So we can stand. In agreement with his command. Everything else is damned. Let them with ears understand. Everything else is damned, let them with ears understand. [Singing Chorus]. It's freedom, said it's freedom time now. It's freedom, said it's freedom time now. It's freedom, I'ma be who I am. It's freedom time, said it's freedom time. Everybody knows that they've lied. Everybody knows that they've perpetrated inside. Everybody knows that they‚Äôre guilty, yes. Resting on their conscience eating their insides. Get free, be who you're suppost to be. Freedom, said it's freedom time now. Freedom, said it's freedom time. Freedom, freedom time now"

To be honest half of these artists never gon see that (Nah man). I keep my bad habits away from where I'm gon eat at. Before I sit up for a bitch I'll loose one knee cap (yeah). I paid a visit to father time but he flung me back. Shocked that we reasonable know 'em by all the guns we pack. Live for the dollar and gratefull for every one we stack. Mind of a man with no sleep my thoughts brung feedback. But don't scheme at the rocks on hand. Before ya mama sees her seed in the bag like popcorn man. The Rug's greased up its not gon jam.

Yeah the gun talk, but i'm talkin' 'bout the condom. They followin' me home with my dog right behind um. Have you ever seen a ass clap on a stallion. Another bad bitch half black and italian. I dont know if she likes me or my medallion. You think i give a fuck, i'm just tryna get a nut. I dont need no-one to build my self-esteem up. Im fresh out the hood, but fuck it its all good. Why you can use me, cuz i'ma use you. For menage-a-twage, you know the usual. And if you do me maybe i'll do you. A favour and walk you outside, rightt. [Chorus].

gilmore's,"Yea, Whoooooooooooooooooo. You niggas know what time it is. Its time for that gangsta shit. We aint got shit to live for. Your either headed for the pen or your on your way to Gilmore. In the middle of the real war. Cause a five dollar bill is the shit niggas kill for. I make million out yeah. I dont care about a muthaphuka out there. My heart cold and my wrist rock. You could fuck around and die over Hip Hop. I treat a dollar like a mill, countin every bill. Cuz if i dont watch mine another muthaphuka will. I went double but i still tuck the steel. Im the truth, why the fuck you think 50 cut the deal. Rollin in a bag of D when you cut the seal. When i bling the paint job on a Coupe De Ville. I aint never had a pop. poppa never had a son. Nobody to go get, so i aint never run. They chat behind my back but they quiet when i come. They treat a lil nigga like a giant with a gun. I walk with a swagger like i always had money. Cuz i know, they rather see my black ass bummy. Aint nuthin funny just a whole lotta anger. Mind of a leader, drama of a gangbanger. If a nigga come on property i aint gonna call. There'll be a splatter on ya shirt, and it aint paintball. We aint got shit to live for. Your either headed for the pen or your on your way to Gilmore. In the middle of the real war. Cause a five dollar bill is the shit niggas kill for. I make million out yeah. I dont care about a muthaphuka out there. My heart cold and my wrist rock. You could fuck around and die over Hip Hop. I dont follow no rules im gettin in here with the town. And if i dont, we gonn' burn this muthaphuka down. Im comin thru swingin like they do in H-Town. And i roll down the window and spin ya bitch face around. Im a stunna, hoggin up the lane like the Hummer. Till the wheel run dry like the rain in the summer. Even the broke nigga cant afford to go to sleep. Fuck around and get ya head popped all over the street. And i aint got nuthin for em but the heat. My lil brother want jewelry and Jordans on his feet. Now, they recognize if ya slaughterin the beat. And if it wasnt for rappin, I'd have ya daughter on the street. I been the same since Kane and Slick Rick had it. Now niggas die in the car, my whole whip had it. I worked too hard to let a nigga have it. So i pack the Automatic for the sideline static, Yea!. We aint got shit to live for. Your either headed for the pen or your on your way to Gilmore. In the middle of the real war. Cause a five dollar bill is the shit niggas kill for. I make million out yeah. I dont care about a muthaphuka out there. My heart cold and my wrist rock. You could fuck around and die over Hip Hop"

Currency and cashmere. You drove (?) your way, i told her she can crash here. Yeah i'm counting paper like the cashier. Living like i'm limited, grieving like its my last year. My boy in and out the box, super stupid soldier. Told me if he could do it again he'd do it over. Poverty's king cobra, squeeze ya life out. Cause its the fatalities and casualtes i should wirte 'bout. These rappers ain't iced out, they just fooling. Running round town fakers, zirconian cubic. [chorus]. Only money matters in the game, f-ck the fame. I gotta eat dollar signs, feed my hunger pain. Music like me, don't worry, leave you numb the same. Play me like i'm something sweet. Be apart of summer slayin'. Most hate it most doubt it. Thats what they shout it. I'm on top now, there's nothing they can do about it. They better have ya out. Cause where i'm from, there ain't no way around it. Home sweet home. [pusha t]. I'ma f-cking rap til you blue in the face. You'll probably turn into smurfs with the time that you waste.

Keep flirting with death and get your horny ass clapped. Back for more me, rat tat, kiss the ring, beat respect out them. Bloody heads, turn timbalands to red bottoms. 50 bottles just a start now thats how they do it. Carbon fibre through the spyder playin' rider music. ain't no question of my resume, i gotta prove it.

homicide,"[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. What kind of nigga run his yap with no gat (you). Shake his man hand and stab him in the back (you). Then catch a little case and turn it into a rap (you).

When they lookin for jooks guess who they pickin (you). And if you talk 'bout us guess who they stickin' (you). [Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]. Look I could spot a fraud so don't try and bluff me. Trust me. We run New York longer than Puffy. These rap niggas pretend that they like me. Until they bent out they cycle. My words touch the kids like Michael. Niggas don't understand 'till we be on they vest pass. Or we wire they jaw like the Kanye West crash. We got the wratchets tucked. I'm from the hood where we was cold and it was the winter, niggas. Had to put the plastic up. I'm blowin bubble gum dro. And you a bum on the road. The type of nigga you pay to shovel your snow. Stop thinkin you the Man Of Steel. Cause the cannon will. Take your legs right from under you like bannana peel. Look at my hand on chill. The wheel won't stay still. Your boys smoother than the OJ kill. for real. The Queens know I'm a problem. As well as the Bronx, BK, Long, Staten Island and Harlem. I blew the game open. Came a long way from the train smokin. A nigga switchin' in ya lane smoke him. I keep them lames hopin'. The dames wishin'. My chain glisten. High as hell so I ain't got to feel the plane twistin'. Drunk off the Louey 3. A nigga violate me. You get a gooey tee. Word to Huey P.. You can't go cop chinchilla. With thin scrilla. And I ain't just get hot nigga I been iller. We ain't the same either don't try to play or push me. Difference is I make pussy pay you pay for pussy. Now you ain't really ready for war my side is bigger. I'll put a patch on your eye like a pirate nigga. I'm in a class of my own. Got model ass on my phone. No problem passin 'em on. They swallow fast and I'm gone. B-A-N-K- dollar sign click clack. The young gorilla out the cliques back. [Bridge: Lloyd Banks]. Yeah, theres alot of foul shit going on 'round here. Keep ya guards up cause niggas ain't playin fair. But if you scared of a collision nigga run and hide. Cause if the gunnas ride. It'll be a hom-i-cide. [Lloyd Banks: talking]. Yeah I'm so sorry ha ha The Hunger For More. May 25th The wait is over, fuck all you niggas"

You just wanna use me. You say ""love"" then abuse me. You never thought you'd loose me. But how quickly we forget. That nothin' is for certain. You thought I'd stay here hurtin'. Your guilt trip's just not workin'. Repressin' me to death. Cuz now I'm choosin' life, yo. I take the sacrifice, yo. If everything must go, then go. That's how I choose to live. [Pause]. [Singing rest of Verse 1]. That's how I choose to live.... Hehehehe, awhh. No more compromises. I see past your diguises. Blindin' through mind control. Stealin' my eternal soul. Appealin' through material. To keep me as your slave. [Singing Chorus]. But I get out. Oh, I get out of all your boxes. I get out. Oh, you can't hold me in these chains. I'll get out. Oh, I want out of social bondage. Knowin' my condition. Oh, is the reason I must change. [Singing Verse 2]. See, what you see is what you get. Oh, and you ain't seen nothin' yet. Oh, I don't care if you're upset. I could care less if you're upset. See it don't change the truth. And your hurt feeling's no excuse. To keep me in this box. Psychological locks. Repressin' true expression. Cementin' this repression. Promotin' mass deception. So that no one can be healed. I don't respect your system. I won't protect your system. When you talk I don't listen. Oh, let my Father's will be done. [Singing Chorus]. And just get out. Oh, just get out of all these bondage. Just get out. Oh, you can't hold me in these chains. Just get out. All these traditions killin' freedom. Knowin' my condition. Is the reason I must change. [Singing Verse 3]. I've just accepted what you said. Keepin' me among the dead. The only way to know. Is to walk then learn and grow. But faith is not your speed. Oh, you've had everyone believed. That you're the sole authority. Just follow the majority. Afraid to face reality. The system is a joke. Oh, you'd be smart to save your soul. Oh, and escape this mind control. You spent your life in sacrifice. To a system for the dead. Oh, are you sure.... Where is the passion in this living. Are you sure it's God you servin'. Obligated to a system. Getting less then you're deserving. Who made up these schools, I say. Who made up these rules, I say. Animal conditioning. Oh, just to keep us as a slave. [Singing Chorus]. Oh, just get out. Of this social (?)-----> PURGATORY. Just get out. All these traditions are alive. Just get out. Superstition killing freedom. Knowin' my condition. Is the reason I must die. Just get out. Just get out. Just get out. Let's get out. Let's get out. Knowin' my condition. Is the reason I must die. Just get out"

i used to love him,"As I look at what I've done. The type of life that I've lived. How many things I pray the father will forgive. One situation involved a young man. He was the ocean and I was the sand. He stole my heart like a thief in the night. Dulled my senses blurred my sight. I used to love him but now I don't. I used to love him but now I don't. I chose a road of passion and pain. Sacrificed too much and waited in vain. Gave up my power ceased being queen. Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend. Torn and confused wasted and used. Reached the crossroad which path would I choose. Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated. For something to happen that just wasn't fated. Thought what I wanted was something I needed. When momma said no I just should have heeded. Misled I bled till the poison was gone. And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn. I used to love him but now I don't. I used to love him but now I don't. Father you saved me and showed me that life. Was much more than being some foolish man's wife. Showed me that love was respect and devotion. Greater than planets deeper than oceans. My soul was weary but now it's replenished. Content because that part of my life is finished. I see him sometimes and the look in his eye. Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold. But my heart is gold I took back my soul. And totally let my creator control. The life which was his to begin with. I used to love him but now I don't. (Repeat to end)"

I ain\'t your friend boy, I\'ll fuck your wife man. Look at my left, now look at my right hand. Every time I move it looks like a strike of lightning. My name is Banks, but you can call me Igloo. There\'s white rocks on my neck, and my wrist\'s blue. So don\'t trip, cause you know I got my pistol. You\'ll be surprised of the doors that it gets through. [Lloyd Banks]. Yeah, Louie introduced me to jewelry, now I\'m lovin it. Tell Jacob the shinin\'s so good, them hoes love the shit. Diamond after diamond, and I climbed up out the bottom. So holla if it\'s a problem, I got \'em just like you got \'em. I\'m stylin; they grillin cause my whip can buy a skyscraper. Roll down the windows stick my hand out, \""Hi hater!\"". I\'m on my way to L.A., I\'ll see you guys later. You\'ll be here when I get back; ain\'t got no time to drink that. Now all I do is sit back, hop on the plane and sip \'gnac. Hop in the Range and whip that, came in the game with this crap. You say my name you get smacked, right on your brain with the gat. Know who you playin with Black, then holla back. [Chorus]. [Young Buck]. My name is Buck, but you can call me Icey. I keep spillin Cristal on my white T. Don\'t give a fuck, bitch you ain\'t gotta like me. I pop my trunk and have you runnin in your Nikes. Look what I just bought, this white mink I got it in New York. And this bright link I put it on and walk right out the store. Where\'s my car keys? What am I gon\' drive?. My Phantom got the steering wheel on the wrong side. Pocket full of cash, Ferrari with the drive-out tags. Them hoes followin us, let me stop and get some gas. Liberace, the cops watch me. I\'m ice skatin like a nigga playin hockey ‚Äì holla back. [Chorus]. [8Ball]. Canary yellow princess cut, rocks when I smile. Fat boy kept it gritty since I was a chubby child. Look at me now, hat cocked up, wristwatch rocked up. When I put my hand up to my mouth and hit that sticky stuff. The light, hit the ice, on my eight-ways piece. In the streets, I\'m a G; on the mic, I\'m a beast. Keep a bitch, on her knees, nigga please, I\'m a pimp. Purge first, ask last, I\'m a shark, you a shrimp. Check a deuce, Chevrolet, rims taller than my son. Gun, on the seat with a extra clip cause I ain\'t fin\' to run. in my brand new, shell toe, three stripe, all white. In other words, come my way with that shit you gon\' lose your life. [Chorus]. [Scarface]. What the fuck are they yellin?. Dope man, anybody killa in the hood, fuck the homeboy sellin. I\'ve got a problem with him - if I can\'t touch it. Then he can\'t slang it, and these streets get dangerous. Corny niggaz pull up in cargo vans. Palms sweaty, icky\'s out with they masks all mad. I gave \'em the order, and that\'s all bad. Born into flossin flashin got his mark-ass, smashed. The Iceman is in the buildin chillin. Big game huntin; and this lame\'s, stuntin. Got an addiction that\'s deeper than a prescription. He\'s sleepin I\'m on a mission to beat him in my position. It\'s fucked. [Chorus]. [Lloyd Banks]. They know me \'round here, they call me Iceman. Watch ouuuuut.... They know me \'round here, they call me Iceman. Watch ouuuuut, I\'ll fuck yo\' wife man. They know me \'round here, they call me Iceman. Watch ouuuuut....

What are you, you know, what are you?..."". (Laughter). And I really went through, I mean, I'm serious, I mean I can laugh about it now, but it took a long time for me to understand that, you know, what I am is what I am and I can't be afraid to, you know, to expose that to the public. You know, always-get in trouble trying to make it, tryin' to dress it up, you know what I'm sayin'? Just tired of that, you know. Just tired of that. Tired of frontin', Tired of that... And until I find a group of people that are as passionate about it as I am, I'll just roll alone until such time, you know. It's all good, God is faithful. Y'all still get to hear it, so, you know? 'Cause see that enemy he would tell me, you know ""You don't have the 20 piece band, you can't do nothin'."" I said, ""Yeah, sure... Keep talkin'."" 'Cause somebody's gonna, they gonna see me and they gonna know ""Oh I, there's somethin' that God's been tellin me to do. I can do it, too.

jackpot,"Man, I'm as f-cking these hoes, like I'm crashing these shows. Hundred dollars shoe strings now I'm bucks for these hoes. Look in my eyes and see clouds, I'm puffing these o's. A threesome ain't shit, I need a couple of those. Mister touch it when I want, pal punching with the rounds. Tell your girl we said wassup? you jump all over town.

just another day,"[Lloyd Banks]. Man what the fuck are you lookin for?. Can't a young nigga make money any more. Blow a couple grand in the NBA Store. Rock twenty-four thousand on the NBA floor. Niggaz be on stage bendin over on tour. Leave anti-social with a case of lochjaw. Just cause shorty look good, don't mean that you should go. puttin ice on the bitch like she won the Superbowl. Even the chips are low, for all these so-called old heads. Just ain't the same niggaz I used to know. I got a Houston ho - nah she ain't the sharpest knife. in the drawer but she a damn good booster though. See I could fuck a supermodel with my {?} works. Send her home with a smile and a couple kids on her shirt. I got a year into the game. A 141 rocks layin on my chain, geah!. [Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. Just another day, chillin in the hood. Just another day around the way. I'm tipsy off the Hennessy. We ridin round with the H-K, nigga we don't play. Just another day, chillin in the hood. Just another day around the way. We smoke a quarter pound a day. G-Unit we here to stay, nigga we don't play. [Lloyd Banks]. Nevermind the lames in my era, they all want me dead. And I know, it's all over the way I see bread. Here I go, caught up in some he say/she said. 'Til I go, put a slug in my enemy's head. The Tahoe's, bulletproof so you can't get through. Then follow, your ass and whoever ran with you. And you about as assed-out as two jammed pistols. Bleedin around a bunch of niggaz who can't fix you. So bring yours, cause you know I got mine with me kid. The 8'll make you lose weight like Missy did. The O.G.'s tryin to hide they phony smilin. Reputation always arise in Coney Island. I'm at your local newsstand jerk. While the only XXL you been in as a shirt. And, speakin of shirts, get a new white T. God damn it feels good to be me - nigga!. [Chorus]. [Lloyd Banks]. Now I'm goin, shoppin with a plastic card now. I'm growin, knockin international broads down. They know him, they're not gonna even pat the star down. I'm holdin, a glock so don't even act that hard now. You might bust your gun but your gat's in the car clown. So break your lil' weed up and crack your cigars down. Cause I ain't tryin to start my visits, with the fuckin judge. givin niggaz life like it's parkin tickets. Now I get to go to bed with a model. And the crib is bout as big as it is on the Belvedere bottle. I got all kind of ex' I could ram in they faces. Red and blue pills like the man in The Matrix. You might have spent some paper on your lil' charm but. My piece is bout as heavy as Lil' Jon cup. But, it's never tucked, nigga I don't give a fuck. I'll get bucked 'fore I give somethin up, yup!. [Chorus]. [ad libs]."
just like water,"[Verse 1]. Moving down the streams of my lifetime. Pulls the fascination in my sleeve. Cooling off the fire of my longing. Boiling off my cold within his heat. Melting down the walls of inhibition. Evaporating all of my fears. Baptizing me into complete submission. Dissolving my condition with his tears. [Chorus]. He's just like the water. I ain't felt this way in years. He's just like the water. I ain't felt this way in years. [Verse 2]. Coursing through my senses, he's prevailing. Floating through the space of my design. Drowning me to find my inside sailing. Drinking in the mainstream of his mind. Filling up the cup of my emotions. Spilling over into all I do. If I only I could get lost in his ocean. Surviving on the thought of loving you. [Chorus]. He's just like the water. I ain't felt this way in years. He's just like the water, the water. I ain't felt this way in years. [Verse 3]. Bathing in the fountain of his essence. He causes my expression to remain. Humbled on a mountain by his presence. Washing my intentions with his name. Sealing off the floodgates of his passions. Saving all his liquid for his own. Moisturizing me to satisfaction. In my imagination? No no!. He's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours. Drawing out my nature with his hands. Yearning I'm so thirsty for his power. Burning to be worthy of his land. [Chorus]. He's just like the water. I ain't felt this way in years. He's just like the water. I ain't felt this way in years. [Ad Libs Remainder]. Cleaning me. He's purging me. And moving me around. He's bathing me. And he's claiming me. And moving me around. Around and around and around. And around. Watching me, claiming me. Moving me around. He's purging me. He's been cleaning me. And moving me around. And around"
just want you around,I just want you around. I just want you around. I just want you around. I just want you around. Thought that I had lost you. I can hardly make a sound. When I thought I couldn't hold you. Knew the world had let me down. Should have took the time to tell you. You keep my feet on the ground. I hope that you can hear me. Cause I know its not profound. I just want you around. I just need you around. I just want you around. I just need you around. When I thought I was without you. I got used to being down. It was my fault I used to doubt you. But that aint me next time around. Please believe me when I tell you. Cause all my words are bound. This is my cross now let me bare it. I was lost but now I'm found-found-found. I just want you around. I just need you around. I just want you around. I just need you around. Took this love for granted. Kept my feelings underground. Should have watered what I planted. Should have known what I have found. I'm not used to being lonely. I don't like the way it sounds. You're the only one I know-yeah. Who don't turn my upside-down. I just want you around. I just need you around. I just want you around. I just need you around. Yeah I want you around. I just need you around .......
karma,"[Chorus]. I am the one you denied. Pushed me off everytime I tried. But Im alright. Im able to swallow my pride. And put all the bullshit to the side. If your ready to ride. Im down for a one night stand. Ill accept it any way that I can. Cause I aint yo man. Ill try for what ever its worth. Just remember who played who first. [Lloyd Banks]. I cant keep my eyes off you. I can tell why them other guys lost you. Your kinds rarer then a flying saucer. And thats why I can offer. Similarities in our characters. Havent ya heard the word around town. How I get down. They all whistle. Every bodypart is official. And that ass withchu got my dick hard as a missle. Dont hop on top. Cuz I ride around with a pistol. If they pull us over Ill be out of town with a issue. If you was mine, Id introduce you momma girl. Your style and your boots are Gabana. Im so used to your Prada. I take trips cuz out in Houston its hotter. Throw on that Al Green and use the Impala. Make my jewels on my collar. Ya had me feelin like a fool when I hollad. Tryina squeeze in but you wouldn't bother. And I aint either. Soon as I realize that I ain't neither. She in a rush to get close to me but I aint eager. Shiiiit. [CHORUS]. [Lloyd Banks]. Look I dont mean to bother you. But your sex appeal is remarkable. You make a G wanna walk around in the park witchu. There aint no tellin the kinda things Ima start to do. If I get wrapped up on your ass too fast. I can tell you feel the same cause when I ask you laugh. So Ima leave it at that. Take a hint and put in my math. I imagine your body look twice as good in the bath. And Im buggin. Cuz I can see you right in the hood when I pass. Im never stable cuz business is on my ass. But you can be the one that I visit before I dash. And I admit I been the type to hit and split. But you cant blame me for the females that I been gettin wit. Cuz mosta these broads has had they eyes on my grit. Til they eat this shit and learn to be satisfied with the dick. and If you aint worth it - thats all you get. I aint gonna blame you, Ima blame all you tricks. Cuz. [CHORUS]. [Lloyd Banks]. Its seems like your attitude, only appears when Im mad atchu. And several situations occur and that includes. When Im going too long, ridin through them avenues. As soon as I get home theres rumors and scattered boos. You know my fantasies. Am I feelin things? And can this be?. Your girlfriend tryina sandwich me. My hearts colder than sandwich meat. Cuz I come from the hood where the hammers be. I move fast but I switch pace. And pop a listerine strip in. Before you get all up in the bitch face. Movin your body like this. Gonna make me blow like a bottle of Cris. Man I dunno. No, and how did it twist. Ya got my temperature risin. From your hips and your thighs. And that glare in your eyes'll brighten up the horizon. It comes naturally, I dont bribe em. Its easy as one,two,three and I slide in. [Chorus 2x]."
kill it,"Girl you're something special. I just wan the chance to get to know you better. Wine you and caress you. Spoil and impress you. Put you in my front seat. Take you home and sex you. [chorus]. I used to day dream about the green, now I got it. Fast cars, credit card, louie wallet. The girl I'm with now is hot but you hotter. One look at you and I almost forgot her. She gon wanna kill me, cause I wanna kill it. Shawty let me get it, I'ma spend a weekend in it. Get one impression, swear I gotta kill it. Hour after hour girl, you gon need a minute. [lloyd banks - verse 1]. I'm into steady stuntin in my phantom ghost. Brand new louie, brand new outfit. And my brand new toast. Rep by the love get my cake and eat it. I want both. Im only here for the summer than I'm leaving out the coast. If we get close I'mma have to book another seat. Baby something sweet. Body you would love to keep. Been f-cked to sleep. We can stay up, drink all this rose up. Smoke my weed and kick it. That sex gobbled a day up. For me this girls a lay up. She knows I don't need it. Difference is I want someone I could see me with. Could be our little secret. Not cause I'm ashamed but for all the nosey hoes. Infatuated with fame. P-ssy's my addiction, your's is like cocaine. Girl let me light your life up. Put you on the game. I have you riding bentley, put you off the train. Strike a pose, take aim not to put you out the frame. [chorus]. I used to day dream about the green, now I got it. Fast cars, credit card, louie wallet. The girl I'm with now is hot but you hotter. One look at you and I almost forgot her. She gon wanna kill me, cause I wanna kill it. Shawty let me get it, I'ma spend a weekend in it. Get one impression, swear I gotta kill it. Hour after hour girl, you gon need a minute. [lloyd banks - verse 2]. Ugh, I had a shorty, but after f-cking you, it's over. I'm all wet, momma sitting on a super soaker. Ruin the sofa, I bend her over, bruise her coacha. Hell of a looker, somebody should give you a poster. Shes my holster, careful how you fools approach her. See we're tight now and everyday we're moving closer. When I'm with you is when I'm calm, baby you the bomb. Fat ass, fly sh-t on, christian louboutin. Cruise along beaches, canary island features. Lambourghini, porches, gorgeous chrome sneakers. The gossip won't reach us. We in another world, keep doing that, I won't think bout another girl. Bad b-tches f-ck, come now is all I've done. 1 Million reasons why I aint belong with them. We live with no worries and spend money for fun. Dodge, no flurries, lear jetting to the sun. [chorus]. I used to day dream about the green, now I got it. Fast cars, credit card, louie wallet (my louie wallet). The girl I'm with now is hot but you hotter. One look at you and I almost forgot her. She gon wanna kill me, cause I wanna kill it. Shawty let me get it, I'ma spend a weekend in it. Get one impression, swear I gotta kill it. Hour after hour girl, you gon need a minute. You got it baby. Almost forget her..."
lamborghini lloyd,"You can call me big truck Banks, or Lamborghini Lloyd,. Ferrari F-50 made me one rich boy,. Niggaz ain't sayin nothin just alotta slick noise,. I got silencers for that, them rubber grip toys,. Over twenty hoes that do what I say so,. Fight ova me like them bitches on the Flava Flav show,. I don't smoke 'em up this is major grade dro,. The flows tight like Bathing Ape clothes,. I'm in and out the I city got state to state shows,. Just in case you wonderin if I'ma make the states know,. They tryin to lock a niggas so the kid stay low,. Indictments is the only thing the pigs pray for,. I pop up in the Vanguish the two doo, nigga,. It's green white like a blue nose pit,. The shoes don't fit, I got a few more hits,. That mean brand new houses and U-Haul trips,. And my mama's so proud she could do 4 flips,. If you jeopardize that, you can rest in peace,. When H died I felt it in my chest for weeks,. All I got is my word, my crew my vest and heat,. So what you wanna do, I'm right in fronna you,. I'll make the ambulance pick up every onna you,. Then I'll be back next week yeah I'm comin through,. Makin my way to the dance floor to do my 1 and 2,. What it do, you know me just chillin,. Thinkin bout what Ima do after I sell 5 million,. The elevator stops at a very high buildin,. Let's just say I'm smart, at this playa art,. I heard all the talk but refused to play a part,. In beefin wit a nigga that was on change of heart,. I spun the wheel of fortune got the Vanna White Challenger,. Still on the stage with the hammer like Gallager,. I'm a hood nigga got a hundred goons wild at ya,. That'll take ya head off, smooth as excalaber,. nigga, I ain't ya ordinary I'm betta,. Kevlar sweater'll keep a nigga togetha,. It's still mandatory that we see the chedda,. I'm grimey, I'm greasey a GT or betta,. Whateva, you could put the house on Cris,. That's why ya bitch wanna put her mouth on this."

lost ones,"It's funny how money change a situation. Miscommunication leads to complication. My emancipation don't fit your equation. I was on the humble, you - on every station. Some wan' play young Lauryn like she dumb. But remember not a game new under the sun. Everything you did has already been done. I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston. My ting done made your kingdom wan' run. Now understand L. Boogie's non violent. But if a thing test me, run for mi gun. Can't take a threat to mi newborn son. L's been this way since creation. A groupie call, you fall from temptation. Now you wanna ball over separation. Tarnish my image in your conversation. Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. Now, now how come your talk turn cold. Gained the whole world for the price of your soul. Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control. Now you're all floss, what a sight to behold. Wisdom is better than silver and gold. I was hopeless now I'm on Hope road. Every man want to act like he's exempt. When him need to get down on his knees and repent. Can't slick talk on the day of judgement. Your movement's similar to a serpent. Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?. Consequence is no coincidence. Hypocrites always want to play innocent. Always want to take it to the full out extent. Always want to make it seem like good intent. Never want to face it when it's time for punishment. I know that you don't wanna hear my opinion. But there come many paths and you must choose one. And if you don't change then the rain soon come. See you might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you really lost one. You just lost one, it's so silly how come. When it's all done did you really gain from. What you done done, it's so silly how come. You just lost one. Now don't you understand man universal law. What you throw out comes back to you, star. Never underestimate those who you scar. Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard. You can't hold God's people back that long. The chain of Shatan wasn't made that strong. Trying to pretend like your word is your bond. But until you do right, all you do will go wrong. Now some might mistake this for just a simple song. And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone. Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn. And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn. Now, some might listen and some might shun. And some may think that they've reached perfection. If you look closely you'll see what you've become. Cause you might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you just lost one. You might win some but you really lost one. You just lost one, it's so silly how come. When it's all done did you really gain from. What you done done, it so silly how come. (repeat to end)"
love me in the hood,"It's banks nigga. South side love. They love me in the hood. Cold since my man died, over thats a damn lie. Boy you smoking dust got these niggas by a landslide. Uh I got them niggas by a rocket ship. I hit the afterburner Ike Turner how I drop a bitch. I'm so far ahead I'm already dead. Getting at you from the future thats why I'm used to what you said. Wait until you see the new Superhead. She got the turbo wop, hop karma sutra in the bed. I got ya yard on my card, back to future with the bread. I pull ya card you a fraud, hope they shot you in ya head. Boy your pockets in the red, you fronting and your style phony. Every day a trending topic keep the pound on me. Exotic women, heavy lenin, thats how I'm living. The punch line king, on the run from Robin Givens. Every week a nigga leak a bunch of robbings killings. F-ck a hater make a million let survival feed him. Still stand where I stood, they love me the hood. Them bitches talking about me, thats how you know I'm doing good. Understood I'm good they love me in the hood. Understood I'm good they love me in the hood. I'm in love with money I don't love these hoes. I love to get paper and spend it on these clothes. Do you here me?. Understood I'm good they love me in the hood. Understood I'm good they love me in the hood. Be in here with the weapons on, blink get ya necklace torn. Hef the don, f-cking on ya sister like escaborn. Escalade eyes bloody red like I have been paper sprayed. Sex for exercise bitches screaming like I step on stage. I get busy dough from here to Quebec I'm paid. F-cking since a kid, then grab weed borret soon braids. I know the neighbors hate my guts I be recking them. My seconds make a twirler stay for months fuck the wrestling. Protects ya neck again like Rae and Meth and 'em. I'm excellent you full of estrogen with a freshman's pen. You couldn't cloud my intelligence with elegance. I'll never flinch whip game like they threw the elephants. I'm heaven sent living vicariously through these presidents. Done worked my whole life to get two, I've been spending ever since. Gg kush bags couldn't find a better stench. Fly like D. Wilkins and Kemp shootin the bench. Still stand where I stood, they love me the hood. Them bitches talking about me, thats how you know I'm doing good. Understood I'm good they love me in the hood. Understood I'm good they love me in the hood. I'm in love with money I don't love these hoes. I love to get paper and spend it on these clothes. Do you here me?. Understood I'm good they love me in the hood. Understood I'm good they love me in the hood. Big city to country all the pretty bitches wants me. Tote tags for trying to jump me, gun smoking like a junkie. Frying pan man turn ya head into a gumbie. When I'm hungry ain't a a humble bum, picture a nigga summy. Sunny everywhere shocked they let you in scummy every year. Pick a spot I'm heavy there, liquor poppin everywhere. F-cking dimes or something, my aura got the telly scared. All problems aborted, sons and daughter on your belly smeared. Rapped in fire black attire she's the appetizer. Humming on my trail all day ima clap her after china. Mr. No Good hood is ever acid rhymer. Shorty fly as hell about 11 levels past Cubana. I'm honored, loaded lama niggas hate ya honor. Donna Karen, Sharen, Chanel in my hotel. All the snickering, I'm running through this money till the trip is done. I meet it at the bottom with my niggas son. Still stand where I stood, they love me the hood. Them bitches talking about me, thats how you know I'm doing good. Understood I'm good they love me in the hood. Understood I'm good they love me in the hood. I'm in love with money I don't love these hoes. I love to get paper and spend it on these clothes. Do you here me?. Understood I'm good they love me in the hood. Understood I'm good they love me in the hood"

manifest/ex factor,"Take it down now. I loved hard one but the love wasnt in return. I found out the man i die for he wasnt even concerned. Time will turn you tried to burn like a perm. But my eyes saw the deception but ma' heart couldnt let me learn. For, some little mug was i. Every time he lied he would cry and then id die. My heart must of died a thousand deaths. Compare my self to Tony Braxton thought id never catch my breate. Nothing left you stole the heart beating from my chest. I tried to call the cops that type of thing they cant arrest. Pay supressed will lead to cardiac arrest. I must deserve it cus' he convinced me i was not blessed. But my people would protest told the line of buisness cus' ma s**t was complex. Mornings just a sex i was blessed but couldnt feel it like when i was caressed. I spent nights touching my breast overwhelmed by gods zest. I was god bleesed contimplating destistating mess. And no man has ever worked in paradise, no man has ever worked in paradise, And no man has ever worked in paradise. Where were you when i needed you, when i needed you, when i needed you. Where were you when i needed you, when i needed you, when i needed you. oh do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do"

mr. intentional,"Yeah, yeaaayh, yeah heh, yeah heh, yeah heh.... See the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Can't you tell the way they have to mention. How they've helped you out; you're such a hopeless victim. Please don't do me any favors, Mr. Intentional. All their talk is seasoned to perfection. The road they walk, commanding your affection. They need to be needed, deceived by motivation. An opportunity, to further situation. Why they so important, is without explanation. Please don't patrionize me, Mr. Intentional. Oh, ohhh, ohh ohhh. We give rise to ego by being insecure. The advice that we go desperatly searching for. The subconscious effort to support our paramour. To engage in denial, to admit we're immature. Validating lies, Mr. Intentional. Open up yours eyes, Mr. Intentional. Stuck in a system that seeks to suck your blood. Held emotionally hostage by what everybody does. Counting all the money that you give them just because. Exploiting ignorance in the name of love. Stop before you drop because that's just the way it works. Please don't justify me, Mr. Intentional. Oh one dimensional, Mr. Intentional. Ohhh, oh don't you do me any favors. Ohhh, ohhhh, ohh ohhhh. Wake up you've been sleeping. Take up your bed and walk. Stop blaming other people. Oh it's nobody else's fault. Accept the truth about you. You know that life goes on without you. And your expensive misinventions. Disguising your intentions. Don't worship my hurt feelings, Mr. Intentional. Oh, oh oh oh. See I know you can't help me, Mr. Intentional. The only help I need to live, is unprofessional. The only wealth I have to give, is not material. And if you need much more than that, I'm not available. Please don't entertain me, Mr. Intentional. Oh I dont need your sympthy, Mr. Intentional. Stay away from me, Mr. Intentional. So one dimensional, Mr. Promotional, Mr. Emotional, Mr. Intentional. Ohhh ohhhh, ohhhh"

So take off your coat, your hat and funny boots. I can?t tell you they names, i just know they loose. Off a mixture of cranberry and the goose. A lil runnin in thats at least a hundred proof. Shorty eyes wide from the Bentleys and the Coup√© She cant stop starin so she trippin off the stool. And ima playboy i might as well tell her the truth. you tryna menage-twat or hit the booth. I got a big pool in the room with bathing suits. See I can go swim, though I get it in. I?ll show you how to make a million dollaz with a pen. I drink champagne and pop bottles when I spin. I cant complain the top models in the Benz. My wheels is shining, like theres diamonds in the rims. Just give me a day or two im climbin in the friendz. I do what I wanna do cuz. [Chorus-LLoyd Banks/50 Cent]. This is myyyy house you gonn do what I tell you to do. When you in my house under my roof you follow my rules.

Hey, watch how you speak. Cuz I dont slip or sleep, I got the heat. If you get outta line, youll be in the street. Ambulance man tryna cover up the leak. Nobody will care, theyll forget you in a week. I rather go in there with a swisha with a freak. And get a lapdance while I listen to the beat. Shes puny and petit I can lift her off her feet. If she gives me the spur, you know im fuckin her. Im iced out so she dont see nuthin but a blur. Be careful where you rub dont get nuthin on the fur. They know we got the things so the drama dont occur. You front cuz u drunk, yo ass gettin jumped. Im high off the funk, dro, hash and the skunk. But then the niggaz dump yo ass in the trunk.

not without my glock,"I guess im suppose to be scared, cuz you got toast up in here. Well nigga lets get one thing clear. I dont leave the block without my glock.. Is it because im standing with yo bitch?. Or got all these stones on my wrists?. Dont think your leavin here with this. I dont leave the block, without my glock. Im on another level when it comes to this, cats swung and missed. Strapped under this, Raps hungriest, top soloist, Hopped over this. Cheap imitations try, Couldnt find an ice pop colder bitch. Wires get tap, your rep cant control the snitch. Which means im in the bing if I throw em bricks. I dump karats and ring overflow the wrists. Man, I even bring the thing when I go to piss. Look money aint a thing thought I told them this. Yo ball big as Yao Ming ima soldier miss. Only problem in hip hop is waiting. No when that butter, I make the strip pop like bacon, hatin. So look sloppy so i stop get the rolly fitted. Got a fanbase in the towns that think Kobe did it. Them dickriders on the block and they starvin. Gimme a year i'll be rockin the garden. Theyll still be in the bricks, same bitchh, same sloppy apartment. Bubble gum on the top of your carpet.. Food stains in your clothes. They cant catch him, dude changin his flows. more then his hoes, just got a Range and a Rose. And these hoes didnt always love me I was pissin them off. Cause you got to fuck banks before you get to the boss. Now Ive moved up in rank, ice chips in the cross. To see me blow, is like vice grips on your balls. I guess im suppose to be scared, cuz you got toast up in here. Well nigga lets get one thing clear. I dont leave the block without my glock.. Is it because im standing with yo bitch?. Or got all these stones on my wrists?. Dont think your leavin here with this. I dont leave the block, without my glock. I was destined to swim backwards in cash. Since the day i was smacked in the ass. Give me that blue push in the booth and i'll be back in a flash. First week i'll be platinum and half. Going hard in the Yard. Im still hungry like im back in the draft. Same shitty attitude cadillac and the stash. Its the critically acclaimed, lyrically inclinded. And im easily influenced, keep my name out your rhymes. Nowadays niggas tell, your own boss set you up. Like Avon and Stringerbell. Im from the ghetto like Akon so bring a L. Your worthless, like a weddin ring in a cell. Hell, all day im blowin dope, see the aroma on my coat?. Its stronger then 2nd hand smoke. When i toat, i blow it in the sky for the slaughter. For every mother and daughter that died in that water. For that lil girl playing outside when they caughter her. But was suppose to hit the guys on the corner. I make the heads bop in the streets like speed bumps. Cuz every bar hit ya, hard as an Muhammad Ali punch. My bitch got an ass about as wide as an tree trunk. She hit once, i think about her for 3 months. Dont you know my nigga L pop off wigs?. Leave em in the grass and say hi to their kids. yeaa. I guess im suppose to be scared, cuz you got toast up in here. Well nigga lets get one thing clear. I dont leave the block without my glock.. Is it because im standing with yo bitch?. Or got all these stones on my wrists?. Dont think your leavin here with this. I dont leave the block, without my glock. . Yeah! Lloyd Banks nigga. GangGreen...Ya know the team!. G-UNITTT!!!..Shady...Its over, nothin. else. wins!..."
nothing even matters,Now the skies could fall. Not even if my boss should call. The world it seems so very small. 'Cause nothing even matters at all. Nothing even matters. Nothing even matters at all. Nothing even matters. Nothing even matters at all. See I don't need no alcohol. Your love makes me feel ten feet tall. Without it I'd go through withdrawal. 'Cause nothing even matters at all. Nothing even matters. Nothing even matters at all. Nothing even matters. Nothing even matters at all. These buildings could drift out to sea. Some natural catastrophe. Still there's no place I'd rather be. 'Cause nothing even matters to me. Nothing even matters. Nothing even matters to me. Nothing even matters. Nothing even matters to me. You're part of my identity. I sometimes have the tendency. To look at you religiously. 'Cause nothing even matters to me. Nothing even matters. Nothing even matters to me. Nothing even matters. Nothing even matters to me. Now you won't find me at no store. I have no time for manicures. With you it's never either or. 'Cause nothing even matters no more. Nothing even matters. Nothing it don't matter. Nothing even matters. Nothing even matters no more. Now my team could score. And make it to the Final Four. Just repossess my 4x4. 'Cause nothing even matters no more. Nothing even matters. Nothing even matters no more. Nothing even matters. Nothing even matters no more. To me( till fade out)

oh jerusalem,"Oh Jerusalem Lyrics. Oh Jerusalem yeah, oh Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem.... Realizing that there's no place else to go. And there's nobody I know who can help me. Text book solutions are so improbable. Cuz everybody else is just as empty. Naked as the day that I was born, I tried to hide. Behind education and philosophy. Hopeless explanation to describe a situation. I can't see because the world's on top of me. Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me. From the body of this death. Freeing me from dust, and the superficial trust. Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath. Failing to connect, cuz I'm morally defect. By reason of the God inside my head. Causing me to see, only what pertains to me. Believing I'm alive when I'm still dead. Limited to earth, unable to find out my worth. Cuz I can't see past my own vanity. If I'm not included, then I just have to remove it. From my mind because it has to be insanity. Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me. From the body of this death. Can I even factor, that I've only been an actor. In this staged interpretation of this day. Focused on the shadow, with my back turned to the light. Too intelligent to see it's me in the way. What a paradox, having God trapped in a box. All this time professing to be spiritual. Naturally pretending, that I'm actually defending. God through my fa√ßade, only material. Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness. That thou may be saved from thy deception. How long, shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee, oh Jerusalem. Keeping thee from perfection. Submit to truth, leave the deception of thy youth. So we can walk in the council of authority. Forget the proof, a generation so aloof. Only following the steps of the majority. Trust in the Lord, with all thy heart. And lean not to thine own understanding in all thy ways. Acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes that you can‚Äôt follow him. We judge and condemn, just as ignorant as them. Who religion tells us that we should ignore. Perpetrating we're in covenant with Him. Exposed by the very things that we adore. We grin and shake hands, then lay ambush for the man. Who has a different point of view than us. Infuriated cuz he doesn't understand. Bringing up those things we don't want to discuss. Wise who do evil, we don't know how to do good. Walking on in darkness running from the light, ey. Led to believe, because we live in neighborhoods. Telling us what's going on will be alright. Oh so repressed, so convinced that I was blessed. When I played with my game of Monopoly. Oh to suggest, that my life is still a mess. To reveal the pride I'm hiding is what's stopping me. Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness. That thou may be saved from thy deception. How long, shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee, oh Jerusalem. Keeping them from perfection. Abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bare. Fruit of itself except in the vine. I am the vine, ye are the branches, He that live in me. And I in him, the same bring forth much fruit. But without me, you can do nothing, oh Jerusalem. You're traditions have deceived you. I've chosen you, you haven't chosen me. And whatsoever, you ask in my name he may give to you. But in vain they call my name, teaching doctrines just the same. Justified among themselves. But God knoweth the heart, what man esteems as smart. Is an abomination to Emmanuel. Just repent, turn from selfish motivation. So iniquity will not cause your demise. Make you a new heart and a new spirit for why would He die. Oh Jerusalem, please tell me why. I have no pleasure in the death of Him to die. Says the Lord God whereforth turn yourselves and live. It's not the talkers, but the walkers in His word. Are the only ones the Father will forgive. Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness. That thou may be saved from thy deception. How long, shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee, oh Jerusalem. Providing you no protection. Oh Jerusalem..."
on fire,"(Lloyd Banks Talking). New York City. You are now rockin with the best. Lloyd Banks. G-Unit. (Chorus - 50 Cent). We on fire. Up in here, it's burnin hot. We on fire. Shawty take it off if it get too hot, up in this spot. We on fire. Tear the roof off this ma'a'fucker, light the roof on fire. (Nigga wutchu say?). We gettin loose in this muh'fucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire. (Verse 1 - Lloyd Banks). Naw I aint puttin nuttin' out, I smoke when I wanna. 26 inch chrome spokes on a Hummer. This heat gon' last for the whole summer. Runnin your bitch faster then the Road Runner. Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under. Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder. I'm buyin diamond by the pier. But when you stop, the only thing still spinnin is your hair. Yeah, I'm ridin with that all black snub. Raiders cap back, all black gloves. I'm 80s man, but the boy smack thugs. These record sales equal more back rubs. Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs. His impacts about as raw as crack was. Now all these new artists gettin wrong deals. I'm only 21, sittin on mill's. (Chorus - 50 Cent). We on fire. Up in here, it's burnin hot. We on fire. Shawty take it off if it get to hot, up in this spot. We on fire. Tear the roof off this ma'a'fucker, light the roof on fire. (Nigga what you say?). We gettin loose in this muh'fucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire. (Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks). If you know anythin about me, then you know I'm a baller. If I 'ont hit the first night, I aint gon' call her. I'm tryna play, you tryna have my daughter. But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her. And I don't care 'bout what the next nigga bought her. Cause I ain't puttin no baguettes in her butter. I got a diamond about as clear as water. And I got bread, but I ain't spend' quarters. So cut the games ma, lets go in the back. Matter fact, turn your ass round, back a nigga down. And I ain't biast when I'm ridin through the town. Like 'em small, like 'em tall, like 'em black, like 'em brown. She gotta be able to come when I need her. Tight ass pants, little wife beater. Regular chick or R&B diva. Bitch say somethin, I ain't a mind reader. (Chorus - 50 Cent). We on fire. Up in here, it's burnin hot. We on fire. Shawty take it off if it get to hot, up in this spot. We on fire. Tear the roof off this ma'a'fucker, light the roof on fire. (Nigga what you say?). We get loose in this muh'fucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire"

playboy,"[Intro - DJ Whoo Kid]. Aw man, can I get a raw please. Y'all ready, for the main event.... DAMN, LLOYD, BANKS. [Verse 1 - Lloyd Banks]. Guess who's the man this winter, straight out the land of sinners. The ranger's tan wit spinners, check out the white wheels. Roll wit the damn winners, or you and your man's finished. You and your ram's fitteds, turn off the light switch. Holdin my torch down, even when the force 'round. You let your wife roam, she want a divorce now. You niggaz ain't this gully, playin to paint ya skully. You'll never take this from me, the riders and all the gangstas from me. You shouldnt be a problem, I ain't be a problem. See ya later I read your head, you be a rodman. I know your type, hoppin all over the beach screamin. You call it hypin yourself up, I call it street dreamin. I do it for all of the haters, the playas roll wit the gators. They lookin foward to favors, gossip is all they gave us. You niggaz wasn't quiet, meet the whales and the fishes. You lit the precinct up, playin tattle-tail wit the snitches. Even my momma knows, I got all kinda hoes. They wait outside the shows, stripped after the diner close. Out their designer clothes, without the winer rules. Take off my baby blue mink, and carolina boots. C'mere, take a look inside an entertainer's closet. I never trust a bitch, I blame Lorainna Bobbit. Niggaz stay and pocket, I know you mad at me. But shit ain't peaches 'n' cream, and I ain't Sarah Lee bitch. [Chorus]. Don't ice me, you starin at the wrong one. There's alot of girls here, go and get up on one. We at the bar poppin, bottles till they all gone. If you aint leavin here wit us, you can walk home. Cause someone else will, they know how we ride. If you a playboy, you got one on each side. Keep your mouth closed, we don't let the beef ride. Ride... ride... ride. DAMN, LET'S GO. (Verse 2). I do this for the hood, niggaz stuck in the slammer. I smile cause I'm good, you act tough for the camera. Where I'm from the little kids, they fuckin wit santa. Cause they like 2Pac more, word?, word to my grandma. I figure I might as well leave here wit my glock drawn. Cause they'll take you to jail even when you're not wrong. Dawg you're not this flashy, but you got to blast me. Every rock is classy, nobody on your block can match me. You shouldn't want a fight, unless you wanna fight. For your life in a hospital 100 nights. I know your type, run behind your girlfriend rushin. You call it quality time, I call it handcuffin. I'm on the beach of miami, cellular reachin my family. All weekend wit panties, from Puerto Rican candy. You niggaz wasn't tough, I shoulda snapped some flicks. You wore your pants tight, play pitty-pat wit the chicks. Even my father knows, where the revolver goes. I bring the beef to your front door like dominoes. And my diamonds froze, that means my time froze. We in the club from when its poppin, till when the time its closed. Half of these so-called real niggaz can hardly sing. Naw I ain't pullin over, learnt that from Rodney King. So tell your homey chill, you know I hold it still. Everything ain't jabs and hooks, and you ain't holyfield nigga. [Chorus]. Don't ice me, you starin at the wrong one. There's alot of girls here, go and get up on one. We at the bar poppin, bottles till they all gone. If you aint leavin here wit us, you can walk home. Cause someone else will, they know how we ride. If you a playboy, you got one on each side. Keep your mouth closed, we don't let the beef ride. [Lloyd banks]. Everybody on the left get your hands up. Everybody on the right get your hands up. Everybody up front get your hands up. And everybody out back get your hands up. And if you in here wit a strap get your hands up. NOW PUT 'EM UP, PUT 'EM UP. What? Man fuck what he said.

How beautiful is fruit still in denial of its roots?. My guilty heart behaved so foolishly. This treason from within. That reasons with my sin. Won't be happy til it sees the death of me. Selfishly addicted. To a life that I depicted. Conflicted cuz it's not reality. Oh what's left of me. I beg you desperately. Cause me to agree with what I know is best for me. Please save me from myself. I need You to save me from myself. Please save me from myself so I can heal. The choices that Ive made. Oh have been nothing but mistakes. What a wasted use of space.

I'm gettin the feelin you wanna take revenge. From the conversations we have and the way it ends. You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends. That's why it's just me in my Mercedes Benz. It all depends, maybe if we make amends. We can start from scratch. Learn to control your temper and relax in fact. We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact. So everytime we seperate, somebody's marchin back. You're amazing in the sack. Eyes slanted like you're Asian, but you're black. God Bless whoever gave you all that. If you seen her from the back. You'd understand why this feel like that. And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows. Her pussy good enough to miss award shows. And I ain't gotta say nothin, she just knows. By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes. Up and down. [Chorus: Lloyd Banks] + (50 Cent). even though I'm not around, and you feelin down. Let the thought of me be ( be the reason you smile). I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown. I wanna bring you joy and be ( be the reason you smile). Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down. I provide by any means to be ( the reason you smile). We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while. I'm just happy I'm around to be ( be the reason you smile). [Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]. The main reason I been lookin at you pitiful. What about the half of this shit I done did to you. Violated and took tip toed into a crib or two. I've come clean to be a bigger individual. Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you. Kinda makes me feel lucky, cause I see niggaz. when you tease 'em with your physical. She wanna rack up her brooms, I ain't got no more room left. Wild drama, section 8 princess. My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed. plus it's hard to communicate. Cause she don't speak-a no english. I been around the world state to state. But now I'm back bustin in your bathroom. Got you laughin in your shower cap, let's get it on. Cause I'm leavin in a hour flat but it don't matter she's mad. Even when I holla back. All I really need your attention for a while. And, I bet you I can make you smile. [Chorus] - 2X."

south side story,"Yeh Yeh Yeh. I done learned from mistakes like who‚Äôs my man. N' Who‚Äôs not, like who‚Äôs gon run and who‚Äôs not. Like who‚Äôs gon shoot if you shot. Who gon hold they own, who‚Äôs not. Who gon change glocks. [Chorus x2]. In the street of new york you can‚Äôt trust nobody. Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty. Loyalty comes free and smokin‚Äô weed is my hobby. You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body. [Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]. When I was 10 years old I seen a nigga take 3 in the head. Probably around the same time you use to pee in the bed. I‚Äôd stay awake cause my nightmares was seein‚Äô him dead. The smell of burnt tires peelin after leavin him lead. The killer fled with a fuckin laugh. My heart pumpin on blast. I just stare at him slumped in the grass. Arms movin, fingers shakin, spittin up blood. DNA mixed in the mud, another ditch to be dug. Their I stood stiffer than wood it‚Äôs the homie that use to buy me candy. Now he‚Äôs gone who‚Äôs gonna provide his family. My air bring this shit up n‚Äô runnin I never thought I‚Äôd be that sick. Damn I wasn‚Äôt suppose to see that shit. That‚Äôs when I thought, it was more than 3 shots. It could have been the aimin for me, maybe he circled around the block. I turned around and my pops, he like ‚Äúwhat happened?‚Äù. This nigga rolled up and just started clappin‚Äô, I can still hear him laughin‚Äô. [Chorus x2]. In the street of new york you can‚Äôt trust nobody. Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty. Loyalty comes free and smokin‚Äô weed is my hobby. You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body. [Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]. It was a regular day in southside, sprinklers n‚Äô kids runnin‚Äô. And all of a sudden heads turnin‚Äô, somebody did sumthin. This nigga named, I forgot, fuck it he lived around the block. Regular getting‚Äô money nigga but loved to clown a lot. Walk across the park stuntin‚Äô and frontin‚Äô. Diamonds in his ears, diamond watch on, eatin a bag of popcorn. Walked up behind a shorty and grabbin‚Äô her waist. She pushed him away. So he threw the bag in her face. She felt disrespected , shorty couldn‚Äôt accept it. Called him a pussy told him she‚Äôd be back in a second. But he ain‚Äôt payin no mind called her a bitch about 4 times. Stayed in the park, with no niggas with him and no nine. And then in no time an older nigga from behind. Swung a baseball bat. Left his face all crack. Told him to take all that. Hit him again popped his chain with a frown. And left the clown with a stain on the ground. [Chorus x2]. In the street of new york you can‚Äôt trust nobody. Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty. Loyalty comes free and smokin‚Äô weed is my hobby. You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body. [Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]. Now all my days go by blowin that sicky icky. California made me picky. Chickenheads tryin‚Äô to stick me with a hicky. If we, roll up quickly, stick me, some was tipsy. The location don‚Äôt matter I‚Äôm southside until they hit me. I‚Äôd be dead. If looks can kill, I‚Äôm from the ghetto boys. But I don‚Äôt know scarface or Bushwick Bill, My heart spills. For the kids who ain‚Äôt got nothing and who got to steal, and from my. Cousin I lost, lookd over the steerin wheel. [Chorus x2]. In the street of new york you can‚Äôt trust nobody. Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty. Loyalty comes free and smokin‚Äô weed is my hobby. You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body."

In case somethin goes down (In case somethin goes down). Uh! Yeah don't fall for a big butt and a smile. They set ya up you fuck around have to buck in the crowd. Around my way, ain't sunshine ev'ryday. Niggas'll cross ya, you should hear the slang they say. In a land of attitudes AK's and accidents. Where niggas split blunts eight ways and pack the bitch. Mama spit me out with a spindle and I been mackin since. And I'm stubborn, so I don't lean back and flinch. Your perpetratin, embarrasin the crooks. Plus your frontin they only seen Paris in the books. Whenever you leave the bricks watch the niggas you roll with. Before you know it niggas be shootin up yo' shit. The clubs a fashion show, so niggas go get. And rev up all the broke niggas rockin they old shit. Before the night is done they be another murder. Put your money to the side for another burner. (Stranger) Don't bring 'em 'round if I don't know 'em like that. I feel like it's targets all over my back. Because of these broads that's layin over my lap. A nigga that young ain't 'sposed to live like that. I just saw the dealer and I'm goin right back. Stashin my guns cause I know they might rat. I'm doin my thang (I'm doin my thang) G-Unit's my gang (G-Unit's my gang). Uh! I'm frontin in my G62's the yellow and royal blues. I'm better than all you dudes hot metal for all you fools. The one that niggas admire many study all my moves. And I'm focused, cause I'm a end up bloody if I snooze. You a sucker for love, or maybe I'm a bit different. If you ask me, is your baby mama's a pigeon?. I just bought the mansion and ma dukes pop the ribbon. And I'm out poppin Cris bitch I'll show you how I'm livin. I keep havin them dreams bout niggas gettin the drop on me. Lettin them things fly up and down the block for me. True fear niggas don't feel ya they triflin. But I adapt, cause I used to think just like 'em. As soon as I hit the top I noticed the sudden change. It's probably the Mazaradi, Ferrari, yeah the Range. This is Southside street talk the hood slang. And my product, a open your nose like good Caine. (Stranger) Don't bring 'em 'round if I don't know 'em like that. I feel like it's targets all over my back. Because of these broads that's layin over my lap. A nigga that young ain't 'sposed to live like that. I just saw the dealer and I'm goin right back.

stunt 101,"[Chorus]. [50 Cent]. I'll teach you how to stunt. My wrists stay rocked up. My TV's pop up in a Mercedez benz. I'll teach you how to stunt. Nigga you can't see me. My bently GT got smoke gray rims. I'll teach you how to stunt. My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man. I'll teach you how to stunt. I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya mans. I'll teach you how to stunt. [50 Cent]. Seven series BM, Six series benz. Twenty-four inches, Giovanni rims. All on one wheel when I'm on one of them. Ma, that boy out there actin a fool that's him. They say I've changed man, I'm getting paper, I'm flashy. They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy. My royalty check's the rebirth of Liberace. Stunt so hard, everybody got to watch me. And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold. As long as the VS bling, look at that light show. In the hood they say Fifty man your sneaker look white yo. Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho. Banks is a sure thing, yall niggaz might blow. I'm fittin to drop that, so I suggest you lay low. Buc, he from Cashville, Tenneckee nigga. Getting them ten of keys, save ten for me nigga. [Chorus]. [Lloyd Banks]. I'm sensing a lot of tension now that I'm rappin. But the kids used to look up to you, what happened?. Me on the corner, ??, hand covered with platinum. Different color coupes but I'm in love with the black one. On point, cuz you get R.I.P.'s when slacking. So the stashbox big enough to squeeze the mack in. Yeah, I'm fairly new but I demand some respect. Cuz I already wear your advance on my neck. I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches. Blue yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers. I already figured out what to do with all my features. Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers. When it comes to stuntin' theres nothing you can teach us. We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us. Naww, I ain't here to save the world, just roll up a blunt. Come with me out front, I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO STUNT. [Chorus]. [Young Buc]. Chain so icy, you don't have to like me. In a throwback jersey, with the throwback nikes. I know you probably seen me with Cash Money from back in the. days. The only thing changed is the numbers on the range. I bought me an old school and blew out the brains. The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain. My sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing. And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game. Come on now, we all know gold is getting old. The ice in my teeth keep the crystal cold. G-Unit homie, actin' like yall don't know. Look, I can't even walk through the mall no more. I just pull up, get out, and get all the hoes. They never seen doors lift up on a car before. Don't be mad at me dog, that's all I know. That's how to show these fougaisies how it's supposed to go. [Chorus]"
survival,"So you say you a gangsta, riiight. Are you really a rider, yeeaa. You dont take shit from no one, nooo. And got ya mind on ya muthafuckin dough, lets go. I'll be a South Side nigga till i rot. Even tho i got the yacht in the million dollar bot. Superman armor on the '69 drop. 0ut of every 70 rappers 69 flop. i blowed a buck in the corner, just to get the feel. My head light smooth when i move the steering wheel. I aint runnin from nothing, its top dollar to chill. I pop bottles for real, with pop artists that kill. I move 2 mill, my backyard is a field. I aint tough for the tube, I'll smack yall for real. Go 'head hate on me now, you'll miss a nigga later. Im hood like butterholes and pissy elevators. I went from playin the same block to Bangkok. So i can get money between raindrops. And my piece so heavy i pop a chain a week. And get so much pussy i cant sleep. Poppa was a rolling stone, never came back home now Im on my own. So i had to learn a few things bout survival, Like the ice pick done off the bottom. If you scared dont come 'round here, guns ammunition dont run out here. As soon you get the paper you try it, a nigga try me he wont see tomorrow. I aint even got a liscence yet and got 7 cars, yep. TV the same size as Kevin Garnett. A brand new buzz, Mac 10 and a choppa. White fan base cuz Eminem is my partner. Im a Ferrari and Jag copper, you a glass shopper. I blow marijuana the color of grass hopper. I aint a regular nigga. All the promoters pay 100 more to bring ya boy to Singapore. My dress code got the best hoes jumpin on em. Evisu's and Red Monkey with the monkey on em. Shelves'll leave a niggas food stamps blue. Like a full tube of acid in ya shampoo. We dont tolerate the cock-blockin out the bricks. We got fif's with the cop stoppers in the clips. Watch ya mouth bitch, there's rocks poppin out the wrists. And my outfits, a eyestopper for the chicks. Poppa was a rolling stone, never came back home now Im on my own. So i had to learn a few things bout survival, Like the ice pick done off the bottom. If you scared dont come 'round here, guns ammunition dont run out here. As soon you get the paper you try it, a nigga try me he wont see tomorrow. A nigga throw his hands up at me, i send a dummy harmed. And had money wrong shoot him in his underarm. Pick up a shell, that'll be his lucky charm. I got a chunky arm, Im a fucking Don. I burn big everyday, nothing but the bong. I dont cuddle, as soon as i get the nut im gone. Im in a class all by myself. I'll whoop ya ass all by myself. I got white gold, rose gold, yellow gold, platinum. Young hoes, old hoes, yellow ones and black ones. I been patiently waiting to get on my shit again. So this is for the corner they cornered a nigga in. I wish you would try jump me, I'll wave the gat by ya. And burn ya eyelashes off like a crack lighter. Nigga you stupid ridin by tryna blast me. Cuz my window got the glass from a taxi. Poppa was a rolling stone, never came back home now Im on my own. So i had to learn a few things bout survival, Like the ice pick done off the bottom. If you scared dont come 'round here, guns ammunition dont run out here. As soon you get the paper you try it, a nigga try me he wont see tomorrow"
sweetest thing,"The sweetest thing I've ever known. Was like the kiss on the collarbone. Soft caress of happiness. The way you walk, your style of dress. I wish I didn't get so weak. Ooo, baby, just to hear you speak. Makes me argue just to see. How much you're in love with me. See, like a queen, a queen upon her throne. Chorus. Chorus. It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know,. It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know. I get mad when you walk away (don't walk away). So I tell you leave, when I mean stay. Warm as the sun dipped in black. Fingertips on the small of my back. More valuable than all I own. Like your precious, precious, precious, precious dark skin tone. Chorus. It was the...Ah. I tried to explain. Ah...but baby, it's in vain. Speaking on my mother's phone. The touch that makes me think I'm grown, (you ain't grown). Sweet prince of the ghetto. Your kisses taste like amaretto. Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating. How sad, how sad that all things come to an end. But then again, I'm, I'm not alone. Chorus. Ah...Sometimes watch you in your sleep. Ah... Excuse me if I get to deep (Ha). Fading Chorus"

the miseducation of lauryn hill,"My world it moves so fast today. The past it seems so far away,. And life, squeezes so tight that i can't breathe. And every time i've tried to be. What someone else thought of me. So caught up, i wasnt able to acheive. And deep in my heart. The answer, it was in me. And I made up my mind. To define my own destiny. I look at my environment,. And wonder where the fire went,. What happened to everything we used to be?. I hear so many cry for help,. Searching outside of themselves. Now I know that His strength is within me. And deep in my heart. The answer, it was in me. And I made up my mind. To define my own destiny. And deep in my heart. The answer, it was in me. And I made up my mind. To define my own destiny"

til the end,"*Alarm Clock*. *Gun Shots*. Verse 1:. Nobody dead knew they would die before they woke. Prolly started off a beautiful day with weed smoke. Outta last nights pussy the murder that she wrote. Cold sweatin from a nightmare, mind on a C-note. You leave the door open, tensions of fulfillin your visions. Constantly sidetrack thinkin about whos your man and who isnt. Maybe its necessary maybe your overreactin. Maybe your actual downfalls that hoe that you clappin. Maybe your pillow conversations been controllin your actions. Maybe your homie overheard and never told you what happened. You look behind you when you turn the coner. Cause death is promised and you done seen some niggas go before ya. The threats honest, and with that lingerin in the back of your head. You know its possible that you wont make it back to your bed. The confusion and jealousy and dishonor'll spin ya. But done nothin hurt worse then when that gun powders in ya. Chorus:. If you my nigga, you my nigga til the end. Fuck a bill fuck a bitch fuck a Benz. Lets toast til we die. Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky. If you my nigga, you my nigga til we go. One of the few I would take a bullet for. Lets toast til we die. Roll up the weed and blow the smoke to the sky. Verse 2:. The smell of Marijuana reiks off me. I raise hell before I speak softly callin the next. Put atleast 100 grand on one hand bought em six. Aknowledge the weaknesses that his man taught him to fix. We aint never left the hood so we cam-corder the trips. I done watch the nigga go from BET to the bricks, shit. Her slanted eyes with the chocolate thighs take me. Ima bachelor nigga you aint knockin my lady. Alota these niggas been jockin mine lately. And I hope they catch the long nap and not rock-a-bye baby. When two brothas pushed outta different mama's. Close enough to conflict and put this shit behind us. Your baby boy made the big time. Hoes is watchin and these niggas tryna get mine. Remember back then the lines in your flattop. Hoppin your moms aint the mama on crack rock. Chorus. Verse 3:. I keep my mind on my money and my head to the sky. I never really smile much if you was here youd know why. Its frustration and fire if you look in my eye. The media fuckin me up, right hookin my high. Niggas hated on us for the game took us inside. Then they opened they arms wide took the whoppin and cried. I got a platnium plaque hangin on the wall in my crib. And handsomes one of the things they been callin the kid. They watch you close when you coppin all them VS stones. If you aint tryna get it poppin leave the BS home. I got us a Diddy broad that gives the best dome. And im blowin on some of the finest weed thats grown holmes. You wont know when they gon' dump a slug. But you can tell im gettin money from line out the front the club. My whole click caked up, you cant compare the dough. And if its only one bitch dont even share a hoe. Chorus. whoaaaa whoaaaaa. La La La. *Alarm Clock*."
to zion,"Unsure of what the balance held. I touched my belly overwhelmed. By what I had been chosen to perform. But then an angel came one day. Told me to kneel down and pray. For unto me a man child would be born. Woe this crazy circumstance. I knew his life deserved a chance. But everybody told me to be smart. Look at your career they said,. ""Lauryn, baby use your head"". But instead I chose to use my heart. Now the joy of my world is in Zion. Now the joy of my world is in Zion. How beautiful if nothing more. Than to wait at Zion's door. I've never been in love like this before. Now let me pray to keep you from. The perils that will surely come. See life for you my prince has just begun. And I thank you for choosing me. To come through unto life to be. A beautiful reflection of his grace. See I know that a gift so great. Is only one God could create. And I'm reminded every time I see your face. That the joy of my world is in Zion. Now the joy of my world is in Zion. Now the joy of my world is in Zion. Now the joy of my world is in Zion. Marching, marching, marching to Zion. Marching, marching. Marching, marching, marching to Zion. Beautiful, beautiful Zion. (repeat to end of song). '"

warrior,"Lloyd Banks - Warrior Lyrics. (Warriors! Come out to Pla-a-a-y!). I'm a warrior!. Aw man I never run never snitch. I'm a grown man dog I ain't no bitch (A warrior!). Don't change cause he's rich. Before I shit on my family I lie in a ditch. Don't fold under pressure. You got a shell waitin in the hole if they test ya (A warrior!). I'll sacrifice it all if he has ta. React and think about it after. Uh, You heard right motherf**ker. My grandmama' daughter ain't raised no sucker. Heart full of pride and a head full of anger. Attitude of a winner infared for the danger. Even the paranoya of a female'll change ya. Waking up every morning laying next to a stranger. I'm on the move, smooth, with one eye out for the snakes. Who can't stand hearin your name all throughout the states. Tune into BET and watchin your video. Pretending to be your friends but the smart ones really no, so. If that's your man warn him. 'Cause there's enough bullets in here to hit every NBA patch on. him. Nigga ride 'til I die the song I sing. You ain't ready for the war I bring. You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing. And I ain't ever scared I'm a warrior!. [Chorus]. Man I never run never snitch. I'm a grown man dog I ain't no bitch (A warrior!). Don't change cause he's rich. Before I shit on my family I lie in a ditch (A warrior!). Don't fold under pressure. You got a shell waitin in the hole if they test ya (A warrior!). I'll sacrifice it all if he has ta. React and think about it after. I'm a warrior!. Goddamn hoe here I go again. The Double L O Y D. Here put on an I.V. Tryin ta try me. The new age I lead. The black C.I.G. Resides beside me. As smooth as an Isley. Sometimes I surprise me. Can't even ID. As low as my eyes be. I roll with the gangstas don't get fly with your mouth. The wrong punchline'll have niggaz inside of your house. Nigga I'm doing good I made it out of the hood. I own Beverly Hills no more bottles or wood. That's a zipper that's sticky. California should whip me. I done made it this far can't be mad if they hit me (shhiit). Nigga ride 'til I die the song I sing. You ain't ready for the war I bring. You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing. And I ain't ever scared I'm a warrior!. [Chorus]. Man I never run never snitch. I'm a grown man dog I ain't no bitch (A warrior!). Don't change cause he's rich. Before I shit on my family I lie in a ditch (A warrior!). Don't fold under pressure. You got a shell waitin in the hole if they test ya (A warrior!). I'll sacrifice it all if he has ta.

where i'm at (feat. eminem),"[eminem intro]. Yeah you got me,. I'm up now, it's your loss. Suffered to you. History is like a cord on no-relay. Keeps repeating itself, what else can I say. You wondering why I act this way. Never should have gave you the time of day. I guess you know what time it is now ay. [eminem]. There must of been a gust of wind. Cause you change your mind everytime it blows. And you just changed it a motherf-ckin again. You just said you just wanted some dick 'fore I stuck it in. I wouldn't of been such a prick to you. F-ckin men you say you don't trust em. Why do I hear the sound of toilets flushing. Some sh-t is goin down. You must've just not of been truthful from the start. See for me it'd be nothing to say you never had my heart. But I'd be lyin. F-ckin see why they call this bullsh-t a relationship, ships sink. And you know its love as soon as you fall in it cause shit stinks. And it feels like everytime I f-ckin do I get jynxed. Cupid must've put a curse on me. 6 weeks have went buy and we only spoke twice. I'm sittin in your driveway callin' you from the car. Suffice I think its safe to say you're not at home. I'm callin your cell phone you answer. But I can tell though that your not alone. How was I to know it should of been time to go a long time ago. I kept holdin on. Its comical when I think back now. Why I couldnt get the hint. You feel the draft you were throwin I wasnt catchin' your drift. But theres a cold breeze blowin over me. I'm over you, success is the best revenge to pay you back. And that payment is overdo. I overcame odds to get even. The sober me is shittin on the unsober you. And I hope they play this in every club your go into. I'm hauntin' you bitch everywhere you turn I'm following you. Cause I loved you with every ounce of me. You know its true, its killin you now, yeah. I hope the hoe dies slow in you. Its cause of you now I don't 'em trust at all. F-ck a middle finger up. I'm gonna just keep grabbin my balls, cup em. I'll never fall again, I trip on stairs, I fall up em.

You're actions got me hot as my last rhyme. You're options will either get put out greenwich or as fine. Fine just ain't gon cut it. Drama is what you're in love with. You're one of them b-tches you run with. Lately I'm feeling smothered. You snooped around for dirt to be uncovered. conceited with cover girl motives. I gotta rise above it. You think them models loving me. I'm thinking bout who doesn't, doesn't really matter what you say. Sickness in my stomach,. Told you I was gon be splitting, you don't think I mean it. Meant it, everything I got, f-ck you. Ain't no secret no apologies you keep it. Now that I'm doing my thing and you peep it. The badder times all outweigh the recent. Your energy who needs it. Every rumour you hear you go believe it. Point out the times you've seen it. You stabbed me should linked it. Revenge is mine, I need it, need a way out. It's my f-cking life, let her find a way to stay out. Bet you thought I'd break, ain't that easy. Bet you thought I need you a million times before you need me. Leave me everything that I gave to you. ain't no freebies get your coat and go. The female pinnochio, money hungry, hopeless hoe. You f-cking with my focus so. Go back to that trunk that played the role before. Love is like a cancer when you don't let go (go). I'mma blow fo 'sho. Unnecessary weight makes the boat go slow. I don't need you sinking us. I hope you float, lying through my teeth I hope you don't. (drown, drown). Now the sound of every dope. Bottles pop out while he smoke. Hit me pride that we broke. Let them girls crowding me go. If they got something to show. Let em show me how I love, I'm never lonely. Never even left a scar. You fell hard, I'm laughing. Ha ha ha ha ha. Tyre smoke fancy car. Nothing is what we are. No beginning no tomorrow. Cause I'm moving on, don't worry about me. Cause I'm gon be aight without you, you'll see. There ain't no-one on this. Earth I'd much rather be cause god-dammit. I'm glad that I'm me. [eminem - chorus]. I said if you could be where I'm at (bye bye). You'd wanna be you too. (I'm living without you). If you felt the way I feel.

Yeah nigga hair trigga teflon chest gone G's up. Freeze up and you'll end up in your lawn. It's the protege of 50, inspired by Biggie. Burns more than Ziggy, them lil' niggaz dig me. I been stressed out lately, so I'm smokin' more than ever. Dead smack in the hood good pokin' out my leather. I'm a Good Fella, in a G-Unit hood sweater. If your bitch give me a sign I'm a get her. [Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. You already know, my mind is on my dough. A millionaire that won't spend a dollar on a hoe. I'm still in here tryin' to get a model out the do'. High blowin' bottle after bottle of that dro. Slidin' on the road, groupie in my vehicle that I don't even know. And If I wasn't Banks shorty probably wouldn't roll. From the Benz to the lobby from the lobby to the do'. If you ain't with the program ma you gotta go. [Verse 2: 50 Cent]. 'Cause were always focused we move around with the toasters. Push the rock to the smokers, warnin' do not approach us. We in the club with the pokers, steppin' in Gucci Loafers. Stuntin' in Testerossas, stylin' in front of vultures. Ma quickly to call us, baddest bitches they know us. After the shows they blow us, and do all type of shit fo' us. Now I can speak for me cause me everywhere I be. Niggaz know I'm a G, got it locked got the keys. We move from bundles to D sippin' on Hennessy. Buck rollin' the trees, Banks countin' the cheese. We get the paper then breeze, nigga we overseas. You stuck in the hood, aw that ain't good. Different town, different tour, different telly, different whore. Triple X, wet sex, who's next, latex. Condom, condo, I'm tight my money long though. You lookin' for a drink bitch I ain't what you lookin' fo'. [Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. You already know, my mind is on my dough. A millionaire that won't spend a dollar on a hoe. I'm still in here tryin to get a model out the do'. High blowin bottle after bottle of that dro. Slidin on the road, groupie in my vehicle that I don't even know. And If I wasn't Banks shorty probably wouldn't roll. From the Benz to the lobby from the lobby to the do'. If you ain't with the program ma you gotta go. [Verse 3: Young Buck]. I'm out on bond but the forty still on me. Bouncin 'round like Lil' Jon thinkin 'bout my dead homies. Watch I hit, need a lick, ain't 'gon get me a brick. I keep on losin shootin' dice and I'm sick of this shit. Clientele still poppin' so the junkies keep comin. And my neighbors is watchin' but we still gettin' money. On this block 'till the sun drop I don't have a home. I will not stop, sellin' rocks, thug 'till I'm gone. Got a couple old schools and some iced out jewels. Some G-Unit shoes body full of tatooes. 'Bout to stomp me a bitch, put the pump to his lips. Tell him talk that shit, now y'all wanna trip. I keep it dirty on the East Coast dirty on the West. Just a dirty lil' nigga with a glock and a vest. Banks tell me you don't like 'em and you know what I'm a do nigga. [Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. You already know, my mind is on my dough. A millionaire that won't spend a dollar on a hoe. I'm still in here tryin' to get a model out the do'. High blowin' bottle after bottle of that dro. Slidin' on the road, groupie in my vehicle that I don't even know. And If I wasn't Banks shorty probably wouldn't roll. From the Benz to the lobby from the lobby to the do'. If you ain't with the program ma you gotta go"

The more we became enveloped. we just developed a fellowship through it. It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemesis is su nemesis. Ain't for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images. But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out. When there's beef. you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out. If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it. It usually just evolves into one big brawl. and we all get involved in it. We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit. And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it. And let it go to whoever's holdin'. the most current people on their shoulders. And their soldiers got their backs till it's over. But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody. We came to party, Banks, Ca$his and Mr. Ferrari. So it's Shady Aftermizat back in that ass, you wizzass. Come hizzon what kinda fuzukin' quizition is that. [50 Cent & Eminem]. Who run it?.

Plus I survive everything you got in that chamber. I thrive off of danger, jumpin' in all beef. You keep talking shit now the squad called me. [Lloyd Banks]. Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine. Dappadon Cappa queen mixed in with Cashis creams. Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see. Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin' G. I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static. And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet. Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit. And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?. [50 Cent]. So who run it?. You know, you actin' like you don't know.

Nigga I'm rollin' up, system blowin', hater's glowin' up - frozen up. Range Rover truck color Coconut. I used to be broke ass fuck, 'til I woke 'em up. I'll show you how to stroke a slut, get in her throat and gut. Then it's back to postin' up, wheels pokin' out. Smoke about enough to have you gaspin' and chokin' out.

From here on out it's manslaughter for the masses. And classics courtesy of Mr. Mathers. You bastards heard of me I get the cash. It's the American way I go to bed with the 'K. I got red, blue and white don't even ask about ice. I look like a cop car flashin' his lights. All he want to do is chit chat and make tapes about him.
