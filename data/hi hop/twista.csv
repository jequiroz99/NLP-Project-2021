Girl I see you, in them apple bottom jeans. Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name. Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains. Put you in a chameleon, 0-4 Range.

Switching to freaky, so I'm loving the way that she walk. You looking good girl, you oughta be in pictures. Listen to me, I see your career going sky high. Taking you home to the crib, in the Chi. And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by. Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas. Hustling trying to get, steady screaming my-my-my-my. Walk on the carpet, with the bells that flick in the dark. Kicking it on the couch, at 106 & Park. I can see your beauty, on the big screen. I can see me freaking you, with whip cream.

hope,"[Verse 1]. I wish the way I was livin' could stop. Servin' rocks, knowin' the cops is hot when I'm on the block. And I - wish my brother would've made bail. So I won't have to travel six hours to see him in jail. And I - wish that my grandmother wasn't sick. Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick (I wish). And I - wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer. When the streets get the upper hand understand we lose a brother. And I - wish I could go deep in the zone. And lift the spirits of the world with words within this song (I wish). And I - wish I could teach us all to fly. Take away the pain out your hands and help you hold 'em high. And I - wish God had never gave the men power. To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers (I wish). And I - wish God would've turned they hearts righteous. When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers. But uh - we will never break though they devastate. We shall motivate, and we gotta pray, all we got is faith. Instead of thinkin' about who gon' die today. The Lord is gon' help you feel better so you ain't gotta cry today. Sit at the light so long. And then we gotta move straight forward cause we bite so strong. So when right go wrong. Just say a lil' prayer, get your money man, life goes on... (Let's go). [Chorus]. Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today. Take this music and use it, let it take you away. And be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way. I know it ain't easy but - that's okay. Just be hopeful. [Verse 2]. I wish that you would show some love. Instead of hatin' so much when you see some other people comin' up (I wish). I wish I could teach the world to sing. Write some music and have them trippin' off the joy I bring. Shit - I wish that we can hold hands. Listenin' instead of dissin', lessons from a grown man (I wish). And I - wish the families that lack but got love. Get some stacks, brand new shack, and a 'Llac that's on dubs. And I - wish we could keep achieving wonders. See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder (I wish). You feel me - and I hope all the kids eat. And don't nobody in my family see six feet - ya dig?. I hope the mothers stand strong. You can make it whether you with him or your man's gone (I wish). And I - wish I could give every celly some commissary. And no popo bring the heat on our peace like they did R. Kelly. And I - wish that D.O.C. could scream again. And bullets could reverse and Pac and Biggie breathe again. Shit - and one day they can speak again. I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN. I wish that enemies could talk. And that Super-homie Christopher Reeve could still walk (I wish). I wish that we could walk the path stay doin' the right thing. Hustle hard so them kids maintain up in the game (Let's go). [Chorus]. Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today. Take this music and use it, let it take you away. And be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way. I know it ain't easy but - that's okay. Just be hopeful. [Verse 3]. Wish the earth wasn't so apocaliptic. I try to spread my message to the world the best way that I can give it. We can make it, always so optimistic. If you don't listen, gotta live my life the best way that I can live it. I pray for justice when we go to court. Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war. Why can't we kick it and just 'em on. And in the famous words of Mister King, 'why can't we all just get along?'. Hope we can find a better way to shop in peace. And I - hope we find a better way to cop for keys. And I - wish everybody would just stop and freeze. And ask - why are fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies. You can be wrong if it's you doubtin'. With the faith of a mustard seed, you can move mountains. And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt. Just let it go and keep prayin' on your knees in church (Let's go). [Chorus]. Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today. Take this music and use it, let it take you away. And be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way. I know it ain't easy but - that's okay. Just be hopeful. (Repeat). Na na na na na na na na na. Just be hopeful. (Repeat). Na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na"
get me,"""Here I am.."". ""Here I am.."". ""Here I am.."". ""Oooh, yeah, here I am.."". ""Come and get me!"" {*echoes*}. [Twista]. On a rainy day die early morn', my lethal legacy was born. I see any rapper around, 'bout the fuckin mics I left torn. But they won't give me all my peeps, and there's only one shot to get G's. Get love for my MC's at home, but some of them still hate on me. Look how many years I done repped, hustled through the streets in the cold. It's fire but our first rap as ever, signed the contract a decade ago. Put Chi name on records in the East, put Chi name on records in the West. Put Chi name on records in the South, bitch how you gon' open your mouth?. To the motherfuckin industry, why you hate on me and my city?. Would it be an imbalance of power if y'all let Chi niggaz get cheese?. Or is it us holdin us back? Think hard when you rollin your sack. Whatever the case my Chi nigga, if it's in my means I got yo' back. What the fuck's really goin on, does the magazine know we on?. Don't he already know we established myself as Twista Corleone?. Well I'm holdin my city down, ain't goin nowhere, here I stand. You know where I am if you hate me {""Come and get me!""}. If you want me {""Come and get me!""} Here I am. [Chorus]. ""Here I am.."". ""Oooh, yeah, here I am.."". ""Oooh, yeah, here I am.."". ""Oooh, yeah, here I am.."". ""Come and get me! Come and get me!"". [Twista]. What did I do to deserve, all of this madness around me. Found me in the studio buryin myself and was smokin herb. Tried to kick me to the curb. To the back to the ditch to the dump to the shack but I sprint in the front. in the 'Llac with a fifth and a blunt in the back with a bitch and a pump. And I'm ready to bust at you hoes, ready to dump lames in ditches. Steady makin fakers bleed, L.B. family handle business. Comin into Twista's realm, journey with me through the pain. The hurt just might make you envision drama that could turn you insane. How much of my chaos bring tears, how many threaten my career?. How many threatenin to murder me but bitch you know where I live. Who the fuck do you think I is? Y'all ain't comin at wit no shotties. Why you think you can hurt like these years, yo all of my peeps can you sawed. Think you finna bring out my fears? Tell me why my success make you cry. And why my downfalls make you laugh, but I bet my hydro got you high. Never let hate back me down, stand forth like a man. If you want me {""Come and get me!""}. Wanna kill me? {""Come and get me!""} Here I am. [Chorus]. [Twista]. We got Geo like Neo, of course we as sourcy as Morpheus. or we as sick as some Marcus Aurelius alias atheist. Look it's niggaz who flow be the achiest, I'm just a alias. Now why hate me is maybe is cause I'm controllin this radius. or this world and this whole universe, don't believe let me spit you a verse. Just when you thought you was worse I come wit worse that'll make you disperse. My allies know I'm too cold, my enemies know I spit thangs. My Lords know I bust that thang, my gangstas know how we still reign. My mobsta family steady ride, L.B. family steady click. While us and other crews collide, choose your weapon take a pick. Load up, click-clack, it's on – finna bust, get back, run home. Come at me jokers get whacked with a strap to the back of the dome. Industry niggaz get gone, heard y'all be stickin Big Worm. I show you some shit that'll blow you now slow you down like you siz-urp. The Chi-Town's sacrificial lamb, well here I stand. firm if you hate me {""Come and get me!""}. If you want me {""Come and get me!""} Here I am. [Chorus]"
back 2 school,"[Tung Twista]. back to school lets go back to school. lets go lets go back to school to the oldschool. [chorus 4x]. lets go back to school to the old school. to the times when the single file lines was the rule. to the days that we had to study all the maps. the days we were kiddin not to take the kid naps. the days when we used to have to wear the dunce caps. and the days when we used to bust the oldschool raps. sittin with your buddy studyin for ya test. lookin back so that you see up under betty's dress. couldnt wait for bells to ring so we can go to recess. to kick the battle rhymes just to see who was the best. there were seven emcee's in the 7th grade. i would kick seven rhymes had only seven made. but those seven rhymes we stole. note the way your toning. i gave the class a blast the way i smash my opponents. battlin was serious they've all ducked the fist. because i kick the funky fresh rhymes like fish. try to swing but they miss they miss like this. Rasheeda's on the monkey bars blowin me a kiss. throwin rhymes back and forth on the see saw. just to mess with him because i know that he saw. winkin at Latrice because i know that she saw. several suckas tried to push us down but we saw. these are the days when the tounge used to rule. recess is over lets go back to school. [chorus]. goin back to school like Rodney Dangerfield. to the lunchroom where the cooks arrange a meal. ate the sloppy joe where my friends copy so. we can try to get more than emcees can flow. the fun fun fun funky able fable. i stake the style standin on the stable lunch table. finish up the rhyme so i can pass it to the next. throw em back and forth till we heard the bells flex. left the lunchroom went to the gymnasium. ut time to flow we call it a rap stadium. throwin rhymes back and forth like a symphany. i wanna start a battle so step to him for me. the whylin got sensible because we saw the principal. like grammar school somehow the principal's invicible. shot a couple hoops the rims are called fruit loops. and if you miss we say opps and leave the gym like troops. single file line but we were still at the pool. the day is over tommorrow back to school. [chorus]. after school im home with my mom she's pleased. cuz rappin help me learn there were never F's and D's. cuz when im spellin bees it would help me stand these. didnt worry about freaks on the street sellin keys. rock the streets beats from the mouth no tracks. rhymes be simple bust on how they aint wack. i walk into a battle say what we havin here. back in them days i was called a cavalier. me and baby used to flow the flows like food. me and James Phillips used to rock the high schools. me and Carl Tolta used to rock the neighborhood. Don and Aviator used to show that they were good. me and Johnny Love used to rock the rock parties. and my brother Johnny kicks a dance to fade everybody. me and kingdom rock used to rock the south blocks. an empire of destruction had emcees on their jocks. the past i have stated, they way we used to rule. even though we graduated lets go back to school.

sunshine,"Twista feat. Anthony Hamilton. . [Intro]. When I wake up in the mornin’ love,. And the sunlight hurts my eyes,. Then somethin’ with out warnin’ love,. Bears heavy on my mind. [Twista]. Let’s get them dollars, Let’s get this money. [Verse 1 (Twista)]. I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind,. I got my finger on tha trigga, stayin' on tha grind,. And when I wake up in the mornin', I got's to hit a lick,. Saw the 2000 and 3 Navi, on Sprees wit' a kit,. Soon as my eyes see tha sunshine,. My thoughts is jukin' the block, and dodgin' the one time,. Peep how we movin' the rocks and wit' pounds of dro before I double my shit,. I can serve sixteen ounces for six and get back ninety-six,. A killa for tha skrilla, Nigga, Best not be stalkin',. I got's to get them bigga, figga's, fuck what you talkin',. I represent them nigga's ballin' wit' jewelry full of zickels,. Down to the nigga's chasin' million, their dreams' servin' nickels,. And I know, one day, I'm gon' come up,. And when you see me, don't hate, that I rolled up,. Get paid whether you legit when you slang, or tippin' off 'cane,. Until I take a dip in the Range, I'm flippin' them thangs,. Gotta get that money man. [Chorus (Anthony Hamilton)]. It's a lovely day, just got paid,. Stack it up, be on my way,. It’s Lovely day, lovely day,. Lovely day, lovely day,. It's a lovely day, just got paid,. Stack it up, be on my way,. Lovely day, lovely day,. Lovely day. [Verse 2 (Twista)]. A hustler's definition, is a hustler for scratch,. You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that,. I'm makin' money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks,. And if I ain't sellin' no records, I'm servin' them packs,. I got a, clip full of hollows, money makin's my motto,. Semi-auto and Marlboros in the bottle, 'til I hit the lotto,. Wit' dreams of ownin' a records label, flippin' words,. My nigga flippin' buildin's better than he was flippin' birds,. I got tha, mentality and tha motive I'm on a mission,. For tha money, you can get it too, it's all about yo ambition,. Play yo position, provide the plans, and follow procedures,. In tha six-hundred, blunted, wit' a pocket full of hundred's and Visa's,. Love, when I get that dust, hit 'em up, re-cock then I get back up,. Love, when I get that gig, get a crib, get a car when tha grip stack up,. It's still in the evenin' if I'm sleepin' paper problems,. Soon as I get up it's just another day, another dollar. Gotta get that money man. [Chorus (Anthony Hamilton)]. It's a lovely day, just got paid,. Stack it up, be on my way,. Lovely day, lovely day,. Lovely day, lovely day,. It's a lovely day, just got paid,. Stack it up, be on my way,. Lovely day, lovely day,. Lovely day. [Verse 3 (Twista)]. Got love for the corporate playas that's ballin' rollin' jags,. Got love for the thug nigga's who get' it on tha ave.,. Love for those, who can make a mil and sit back and laugh,. And love for the fine stripper's who get it poppin' ass,. Love for the single parent's that's workin' through the struggle,. Love for those who gotta make a livin' movin' muscle,. Love for those who gotta watch tha hater's rollin' bubbles,. Causin' trouble every time a young brotha try to hustle,. And if I can't, legally make or not. Then I gotta get, right back on the block. And if it no work we do a stick-up and whip-up a concoction,. Might leave yo face down in the dirt because hurtin's not an option. Gotta get that money man. [Chorus (Anthony Hamilton) x2]. It's a lovely day, just got paid,. Stack it up, be on my way,. Lovely day, lovely day,. Lovely day, lovely day,. It's a lovely day, just got paid,. Stack it up, be on my way,. Lovely day, lovely day,. Lovely day. [Outro (Anthony Hamilton)]. When I wake up in the mornin' love,. And the sunlight hurts my eyes,. Somethin' without warnin' love,. Bears heavy on my mind"

dreams,"Twista feat. The Speedknot Mobstaz, Vicky. . [Chorus 2x]. Hey lover, am I the only one. Or are you selling your baby a dream. (Am I who you thinkin' of, who you thinkin' of). Hey lover boy, am I the only one. Or are you selling your baby a dream. (Am I a sucker for love, a sucker for love). [Mayz]. Damn, I'm trippin' 'cause I never really felt like this. To me women used to be only fuck foxes. But it's like with you I cherish every kiss. I know it's a risk but you make me wanna come clean. I wanna make you my queen. Put you in a crib and give you plenty green. To help you fulfill all your childhood dreams. Only for your love I fiend. 'Cause the way you put it on me make me wanna scream. And fuck you in places you ain't never seen. In a private boat as we float down stream. Yeah I already know you done heard this before. But the way you make me feel is real. Playas don't love no hoes but stayin' true like you do. Got me head over heals, so tell me what's the deal, baby. 'Cause you lookin' too fine to not be mine. And I ain't gon' never be satisfied. Unless you're on my side to the end of time. I can tell you think I'm lying. But I swear to you girl this ain't no scheme. You stay on my mind, even in my sleep. You keep a nigga havin' wet dreams, on the real. [Chorus 2x]. [Liffy Stokes]. From the first time I met ya, you was on my mind all night. A Maybelene queen with a body too tight. Wearin' black and white and some brand new Mike's. Draped in ice, attitude nice. You the type of woman that I need in my life. To add a little spice, cookin' nigga steak and rice. I can see ud one day man and wife. Walkin' down the aisle, havin' our first child. Plus our marriage worth while. With a brand new lifestyle, I could walk that mile. But baby I need you right now. In my arms caressin' me. I can see your eyes undressing me. Girl it's destiny and love is the recipe. But this way's got the best of me. On everything, I can guarantee you better things. If you just get rid of ""what's his name"". And let me in your world. So I can show you, baby, that my love is real and not a game. So can a brother come through. So I can show you, boo, just exactly what I mean. It don't matter if you fuck me tonight or next month. Babe, only time can reveal a dream. [Chorus 2x]. [Twista]. Baby I'll drink your bath water about a pint. Think I'm ever gon' give your love away, uh-uh. I ain't sayin' you never lovin' another nice stud but shit. I'm cravin' you every night and we just met on a night. But it seems like I've been knowin' you all my life. Ain't it funny how you be thinkin' you never be true enough, but you the one. A helpless seeks succumb, lovin' you more than everything. But my dollars, (?) and smokin' sticky up through the lungs. I can see you havin' my sons, screamin' your name on my next tape deck. In the city, no hear my pretty go. Quick to break a 54, put you on my video. Young and witty hoe, the only thing I'm feelin' pity for. I don't know what I was frontin' on. But I don't see nothin' wrong, sprung or gone. My every heartbeat's weaker, follow the leader. I promise I won't hurt you baby. Don't feel the heatseaker 'cause we gon' be smokin' on sweet cheeba. Take my boo to the mall and go shopping until we fall. Get you the finest things like diamond rings. Even though my mind is strain, I'm tryin' to change. How we fuck and kiss and the hugging make me bind the pain. No lying, no game, you gon' give me some, hey now, we freakin' up in the cut. 'Cause I just sold you a dream hoe, like a girl did to my homie. Your house was spittin' and we fuckin' the uh. A sucker for love, a sucker for love. [Chorus 2x]. [Conversation Between 2 Girls]"
a fish's place,"After i met you, i met loneliness.. You didn't have any interest in me,. But i was a fool in love, i can't believe it.. I don't want to lose you this easily.. After i met you, i let out tears.. You were already another man's woman,. But i was a fool in love, i can't believe it.. I don't want to forget you just yet.. *i want to be destiny. For us to meet once again.. If i could see you once more,. Then the greed i feel would be letten go.. Please appear in my dreams.. Once in a while, i'll start a conversation.. I hope you don't feel this as a burden.. I'll always love you like i do know,. So remember i'll be waiting for you.. After i met you, i let out tears.. You were already another man's woman,. But i was a fool in love, i can't believe it.. I don't want to forget you just yet.. For eternity i'll be waiting for you..."

And I'mma pull up in the Bentley all white. Step up in the club with nothing but all dykes. Sippin' on some Louis and partyin' all night. Phony-ass people, I don't feel they demeanor. So I hop in the rocket and go and chill over Venus. One of rap's heroes, who came from zero. Makin' something out of nothing, call me Gilbert Arenas. Now I'm fuckin' with divas that rock the stadiums. Blow my brains back 'til my face be numb. I am the shit. It don't make me numb. Rockin' wit a swagger like I got an eight-feet gun. And my flow be colossal cause I spit the impossible. Whether with rhythm no limit to what I can do. See through a prism when I conquer an obstacle. And always get money no matter how illogical. I follow through because, uh"

I'm like transparent glass that can't escape anything.. Mysterious eyes that glanced at me are the ones I like,. even when I laughed foolishly.. I want it to me just you and me,. so I could sing you splendid songs to make you happy.. I'll allure you with my warm sight and. attract you with my low voice comforting like the rain.. If I met you today,. if you approached me first,. I'm going to speak the word that's on the tip of my lips."

burning my face with tears,"When i bury my face with tears. When you throw away the day. I will swallow my tears too. From when (think back to the past how we used to be). I am prepared to beg. I will know in advance. (i look back and i can't forget a single moment, uh!). Do it for me. Truly i need you, but when i called you weren't there. There are no tears, but the day i gave up i cried. **the memories which break in this starlit day throw away your name. It can't be erased, i will erase myself. I don't know (think back to the past how we used to be). The reason i urgently gave up. Love in advance. (i look back and i can't forget a single moment, uh!). Do it for. I will endeavor everyday to try to change things. It wasn't the truth that you could just throw me away without caring. The lingering spreads as cold as ice. The day you left me i cried. ** (repeat). * (repeat)"
bussin no discussin,"[Intro]. Yo Twist!. Shit, niggaz out here been talkin real sideways man. Shit... it's time to show niggaz what's really hood. [Chorus: Twista]. Bussin never discussin. People are runnin niggaz is gunnin. Killers are runnin because it was stunnin. Hearin the ambulance when it be comin in. [Twista]. Roll in the Chevy Malibu I know they dig that. In the secret compartment is where I hid that. Try to avoid wherever I see the pigs at. Forty-fo' and black Calico when I push your shit back. When I'm out of town I go wherever the hood at. Because I know where I can get somethin that's good at. The dopefiends is gon' show me where the kush at. Ain't got no cigarette loaded where the backwood at. Come walkin up and get a pistol in your face hoe. If you want an autograph you better say so. Otherwise everybody gon' have to stay low. Cause I'm about to give this motherfucker a halo~!. [Chorus]. [Twista]. Bodies droppin pistols poppin we bustin our tecs. People scatterin around like it was a bomb threat. Got plenty ammunition, show me where your ones at. So much terrorism they askin me where Saddam at. Like Bush I alarm 'em bomb 'em let fire open out. Go forth catch him open choke him and try to smoke him out. Shit is serious I'ma show you what this dough about. That's what you motherfuckers get for havin an open mouth. [Chorus]. [Twista]. I'm killin new arrivals every time I shoot a rifle. Leave you suicidal cause everything I do is vital. Displayin mo' evil than the preacher that threw the bible. Win a Bentley don't think it's mine 'til I show you the title. In the car breakin up trees, call me a lumberjack. You say you a baller then nigga where the hundreds at?. Get me in the club, it won't be none of that. A 22 on my body like I'm a Dallas Cowboys running back. [Chorus]. [Hook: Twista]. Catch one in yo' leg if you RUN UP. Catch one in yo' body if you RUN UP. Catch one in yo' head if you RUN UP. You can end up dead if you RUN UP. I'ma cop me a Benz when I COME UP. I'ma cop me a Beemer when I COME UP. I'ma shit on the phonies when I COME UP. I'ma hit all the homies when I... [Chorus]. [Twista]. I lay you niggaz out like tomorrow's outfit. You gettin me pissed, you niggaz ain't about shit. Before you get me started I suggest you bounce bitch. I got AR-15's to come up in yo' house with. To tell yo' woman she look good in them killer jeans. Think it's butter I wanna cut her like a guillotine. Need to get at her but right now it's still a dream. I'd like the thong, but right now for the microphone I'm still a fiend. [Chorus]. [Twista]. I'm on the block servin up rock like Johnny Unitas. With killer niggaz we didn't really care if you like us. Vicious, so cold, that I be catchin laryngitis. Still shit that's hotter than any temperature on fahrenheit is. Gotta read celsius just to say you felt me bust. Better be yo' healthiest thinkin you can belt me up. All up in my face talkin 'bout you gon' tell me WHAT. I ain't gon' be the one needin my homies to help me up. [Chorus]. [Hook]. [Chorus]. [Twista]. Now come in with that let me take a lil' hit of the blig. This pussy nigga right here wanna get rid of my nigz. He don't want it cause we got the chrome thing-a-ma-jigs. And I make a nigga quit rappin and go get him a gig. I'm buck when I'm on a mission you better watch how I do. You got what I want so I'm creepin cause I got a rival. I'm thirsty as FUCK~! and money is the water bottle. Thinkin you hard to follow but I'm on you like Polamalu. [Chorus]. [Twista]. With the shotty I'ma bring drama to you quarter leagues. Make that mighty dollar if I gotta transport a ki. Call me Ali Baba cause I'm runnin with 40 thieves. 30-somethin and I be hotter than all the shorties be. 32 shot automatic, yeah I call it magic. Two clips, 34 shots, pall bearers and a casket. A couple of glocks, to kill off any cause of static. Didn't have the calico but you broke cause you thought I had it. [Hook]. [Chorus]"
check that hoe,"""Check That Hoe"". [Twista]. Twista, first time I kicked it off with ""Adrenaline Rush"". Next album I kicked it off with ""They Kill Us All"". This time, I'ma show you how to ""Check That Hoe"". Check it out. Take a look at the way that I came. Hard times, long road, mean streets. Motherfuckers back up off me when they look at the way that I am. Put the bullet in your brain when I ride nigga. Got it out when you entered they don't fuck with the boss. If you disrespectin me I'm reposessin. like you catchin the holy ghost make him die like he touchin the cross. Now you spiritually commited suicide nigga. I got the power to get diamonds and riches and gold. Motherfuckers tried to get it with extortion. But I'm too vicious for blows and I'm checkin these bitches and hoes. Make a shower full of hollow point bullets rain on. For yo' death you got me lookin in my itinerary. If I ain't got scheduled to be dead where the men are buried. I think I can fit you another cemetary. Like a disciple of death I'm bringin pain on. I can see nobody playin me like I'm a punk. I'ma let you know off top if you come at me bogus. And there's more than one of y'all if I gotta stop I'ma dump. You done made me a murderer from the Westside. Haters come at smilin but really they wanna fuck up a nigga hustle. So I just get bubble smokin bubble when I try to just stay out of trouble. But some shit you can't let slide - you gotta check that hoe. [Chorus: Twista]. If a nigga come at you like a lame or big slander your name. Nigga you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe. Fuck that hoe - if a nigga come at you in the club. Talkin 'bout a bitch that you supposed to fuck. Nigga you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe. Fuck that hoe - you and somebody put in half and half. And he come back at you with twenty-five percent; then. you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe. Fuck that hoe - if you get played for a bird and some herb. All you got is your balls and your word. Nigga you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe. Fuck that hoe. [Twista]. I just wanted 'em to see what my CD was like. Hip-Hop is in a state as if it was a baby bein murdered. I just wanna feed in poetry breathin you life. I'm a black revolutionary in hip-hop. I just wanna hit the earth like a meteorite. Now droppin lyrical bombs upon the planet. And just get a little dust and word out on media hype. Fuck the drama I'm just campaignin Chi right. Niggaz feel like they position is better than mine. But I stay on a mission, I'm on the grind. Takin no prisoners I can see 'em gettin mo' cheddar than mine. How I flow make the dough get larger. Take over with an immaculate verbal assault. Just to do it the way I'm doin it, rollin how I'm rollin. Motherfuckers is gon' have to just go in the vault. Shit on niggaz in the oh-six Charger. When it come to titles you know that I'm holdin 'em. I've been down since the days of breakin on linoleum. 'til Kanye preach and ""Jesus Walks"" right up at the podium. Now let me speak about the prophecy of Twista. Just when you thought you worse, I'm bringin you a hearse. I make you feel the heat and cold when I'm tellin the street scroll. I got you feelin the universe through the verse. The way I'm teachin it has got to be a scripture. So look at me like I'm a prophet on top of the game. Puttin money in my pocket for the way a nigga rock it. And I bet if I'ma cock it I'm poppin the thang. And if I ain't strapped then I gotta whup ass. So I take off my pinky ice; if a nigga come at me with some bullshit. or fuck me out of money I steal on him like Winky Wright. Hit you with the left hook fast - you better check that hoe.

chocolate fe's and redbones,"Chocolate Fe's And Redbones"". (feat. Johnny P). [Johnny P ad lib croons for 15 seconds]. [Chorus: Johnny P]. Rollin down the street on some shiny twenty-fo's. Pullin up with chocolate fe's and redbonnnes (la la la la la). Blowin on some 'dro while I spit my money flow. Pullin up with chocolate fe's and redbonnnes (honey no). Rollin down the street on some shiny twenty-fo's. Pullin up with chocolate fe's and redbonnnes (chocolate fe's and redbones). Blowin on some 'dro while I spit my money flow. Pullin up with chocolate fe's and redbonnnes (ohh yeah). [Twista + (Johnny P)]. One two three. You ain't never seen no motherfucker pimp like me. Stay up in the street lookin for honies throwin money in the club. Chubby thug ballin in the white tee. Roll a Swisher up and take it to the head. Havin fantasies of havin me two bitches in the bed. Dark-skinned and light-skinned like Mike, both of 'em lookin right. Spectacular when I get up in them legs. Have you ever seen a light-skinned freak. Butter pecan or vanilla, nipples and her pussy pink. (Hazel-eyed jet black baby hair that'll hurt yo' hearrrrrrt). Have you ever seen a dark-skinned freak. Sexy and chocolate when she droppin in, my African Queen. (When she starts what is she like a Hershey bar). The three of us need to drive up to an exotic place. Where y'all can double up on me, take me to outer space. Or we can keep it ghetto while hang in the hood on the porch. And later on we can fuck in front of the fireplace. But for now I'm only dippin through the block. Expressin to you all of the feelings in my chest. Wishin I could find a couple of girls on what I'm on. So they could help me end my stress, until then I'm just. [Chorus (w/ new ad libs)]. [Twista + (Johnny P)]. Look at lil' red. Talkin jazzy at the mouth, cause she think she the shit. Thinkin everybody around supposed to bow down to her. cause she's bored, but she's still my bitch. Now come take a look at miss black. Always got an attitude, and she stay on the attack. Why you always wanna whup a nigga ass, tellin me I'm bogus. But I love you cause yo' ass so fat. So now I gotta pimp my ride. Custom material, computer, and chrome on the side. Paint job can make you look like butter rollin. but you ain't rollin unless you got some twenty-fo's on the ride. And the do' suicide. Niggaz hatin but the bitches on the dick when the do's go up. Let the enemies see it good. When the homies in the ride and the forks and the fo's go up. ... steady bendin through the block, and I'm tryin to find a ho. (And I'm pullin up with somethin candy painted mayyyne). Everybody call me Twista, representer for the city of the dough. (Standin out on Madisson screamin out ain't it mayyyne). Hit 'em with the one two three. [Chorus (w/ more different ad libs)]. [Johnny P - repeat 2X to fade]. You know I love my chocolate fe's and my redbones. I still love my peanut butter and my caramel girls. I got love for my chocolate fe's and my redbones. I still love my peanut butter and my caramel girls. . by /Snipes_"

crook county (bone crusher mix),"Twista feat. The Speedknot Mobstaz, Newsense. . [Liffy Stokes]. In the Chi, it's kill or be killed, hussle or die. You gotsta take the pie, momma didn't lie. Look in my eyes you see the realness. The nine makes you feel this. The pain that I'm going through 'til I'm sitting on millions. My minds on that paper, wishin' upon a caper. I need to stack now, I will pay for my sins later. When I'm living greater, the mind state of a Westside native. It's sick in the head, dodgin' Feds everyday. See me load the AK, watch 'em run when we spray. Get the fuck up out my way and for pray that this pistol play. 'Cause when I'm heated I'm gunning 'til there's nothing in sight. So cancel Christmas muthafucka, fuck you and your life. [Mayz]. Niggas in my mob is too suave. We ride hundred G cars, in it like the world is ours. Don't disrespect or get your chest split like cigars. In this county of crooks tryin' to avoid jail bars. But it's so hard to make cheese especially. If you ain't got no Ph.D. or connect on phat keys. See mobstability is for niggas with nothing to lose. Going psycho from this drama you go through paying dues. I get a buck in your side tryin' to hussle for a ride. Or hittin' the block to find out one of your guys just died. So don't come to the Chi, it's just risky as hell. 'Cause K-Town niggas'll bomb on that ass like a stealth. [Chorus]. In the county of crooks: gangbangers, killers and slangers. With judges be quick to hang us homies and strangers. No bluffin', we bustin'. Like a kamikaze, watch our bodies come up. War (?) then it's on, now we gon' strap up, what's up. [Repeat Chorus]. [Newsense]. Our county's so crooked, Psycho Drama invented the style. Then damn near everybody took it and passed it around. Now these muthafuckas all look and see 'cause we puttin' it down. And ain't no sooner or later, the world gon' realize they fakin'. Then snatch they tapes of the shelves and break 'em, eliminate 'em. Just as fast as Creator's Way can create shit. Now they all on some hation, just like them nigga. Like ain't nobody done a thing. But we run a reason around these bitches. The more tapes we make the more they all go broke, so fuck 'em. If it ain't no love then it ain't none. If it is, then nigga then say something. 'Cause more of this beats gon' stomp and keep on stompin'. And Drama make that solemn promise. That shorty flyin' all on niggas' business. [Twista]. Come look around Crook County, look around, you found me. I must've been bad to the bone, get the mask and the chrome. This Chi gotta die from a blast to the dome. Nigga, not muthafuckin' Ouija board. I receive my blessings from G's and Lord, nine-millies and source. But the art of war nigga, must've found breathin' bored. Tellin' me to look into your eyes, all I see is a bitch. Tell Krayzie in New Orleans that he bit. Talkin' about you was lovin' my shit. Hit the bud and got sent on that shit odyssey mumblin' r&b. You can keep the apology, you gon' try to dishonor me. Kill the Hoes of the Harmony. Just when you thought it was safe. The Bone niggas 'bout to get slaughtered and raped. I can slow down and audit the tape. Y'all bent and all y'all who thought it was fake. Now watch (?) on the stage, beef and the rage. Die on the first on the month, 'cause it's than the blunt. Why would you compete to be doomed, now you gon' see Eazy-E soon. Feel the boom of the reprecussion, 'cause the reefer's still rushin'. When I reach and start bustin'. I'm a Bone Crusher, crook county or nothin. Ain't no bluffin'. [Chorus (2x)]"

I dont give a fuck about the fact that the hood know you. dont make a nigga have to show you. that Ima die before you make an ass of me stop as if you took a blast. at me and cause tragedy. that was how it was that was how it is and thats the way it has to be. [chorus 2x]. [verse 3]. its like uh, ah, sit back and let the shit just straight marinate. I pull the stage curtain back like norman bates. performin hates smokin on some reefer performin fate. its a constant struggle for us white boys with the shit hittin licks. in the scuffle for us. my nigga lucky made him bleed fear is if to proceed to bust. if he a different type of breed from us. so yall petty niggas need to hush; two straight to you brain means pains. inflicted. even if it aint things to taunt pain like rage till my brain is wicked. aint even lived out a quarter of your lifetime tryin to push product. and aint servin the right kind and aint strivin the right rhymes. but Ima shorten your lifeline. through the pipeline I vocal cold bust em plus them with killers. jaw stealers throw dealers rushin parties bloody body chillers. pretty casket fillers. cuz those niggas got they shit together. we come pay to Creator's Way and dont gotta be but then again whatever.

dirty game,"Twista feat. Speedknot Mobstaz. . Life, pain. [Hook]. It's so hard to survive in this world of pain. I feel like I'm goin' crazy so I'ma shell my brain. My niggaz out here droppin' off over rocks and thangs. Mama never told me life was such a dirty game. [Lifty Stokes]. I hold my glock to my chest, yes my steel is cold. I pray to God to come to rescue me and save my soul. I reminisce on my past life. Ever since I was a young shorty I didn't act right. Live for the street life. Yellin', ""What it be like?"". Nigga we Folks. Money makin' hustlaz from the Westside and it shows. In these past years, shit it's been a hell of 25. Back in '91, I didn't even think I'd be alive. I was sellin' jewelry to rocks, and rocks to weed. Off at the comfort zone G with a fifth of T's and B's. Ready to do whatever, young with a pocket full of cheddar. No thoughts of stackin' just ballin', picture me fallin' nigga never. In this lifetime. But I had to grieve for awhile. Cause a nigga fell off hard but I got my ass back on the grind. And hit the streets like a mad man, goin' against the grain. With dried tears on my face from the pain of this dirty game. [Hook 2x's]. [Todd Nitty]. Fresh out the pen and can't maintain. Wanna go and hit the block, be on the same thang. Tryin' to serve some cain up in this dirty game. Cause you did a lil' bit, think ain't shit changed. You wrong boy, these shorties out here misled. You fuck around and catch a bullet in yo forehead. Ya heard me?. This ain't the 80's where you get a nickel sack and a hoodrat. A 40-ounce of Red Bull and blow yo wig back. Nigga fuck that, this the year 2-G. Where the toughest muthafucka get left 6-feet deep. So don't sleep, cause the scariest nigga'll pull the trigga. Put 2 in 300 pounds, so that makes you a killa. Oh really, could you be that silly. To think you gon' take over a block where I be ?? nigga forget it. Don't make me have to blow yo brains. In this fucked up world, this fucked up life, this fucked up game. [Hook 2x's]. [Twista]. Hey nug, for some reason at night I can't sleep. When I lay down, I keep tossin' and turnin'. There's somethin' wrong but I don't know what's wrong with me. Eyes burnin'. Cause sometimes I burst into tears when ain't nobody home with me. Stress from thoughts of survival just rushed my dome quickly. Y'all better come on get me. Cause I bout to do somethin' so muthafuckin' drastic. Instead of writin' essays like grabbin' SK's. With one of the best ways that I know to feed my family. Cause y'all ain't foolin' me. Y'all people plannin' a way for my people to read my eulogy. I see what y'all bogus ass doin', y'all plannin' on hurtin' me. Used to be crucifyin' or burnin' me. Now you eliminatin' paper currency. Terrorizin' with technology. And that Y2K shit, I don't know why you play with the chosen guys. The wool ain't no longer pulled over my eyes. Gots to get some scratch and I gotta get it soon. We about to be doomed. Do somethin' for the kids before I go to my tomb. Gotta bust this thang and maybe then thangs gon' change. Tryin' to check mine, cause all of it on y'all I can't blame. Maintain, it's a strange game. At times you gotta throw blows for the gold. It's a long road, some of us do shit despite losin' our soul. Got cold flows but it's strange, I still can't get no change. Bout to be insane. Tryin' to pay the bills but still straight causin' pain. It's a dirty game. [Hook 2x's]. Dirty - dirty - dirty game. Dirty game. Such a dirty game"
do wrong,"""Do Wrong"". (feat. Lil' Kim). Man dawg, it's some bad bitches out here that'll (""make you do wrong""). Whoa... go on girl (""make you do wrong""). I know everybody gotta feel this. Yeah you got somebody at home. but this bad motherfucker right here gon' (""make you do wrong""). [Twista]. I could tell when I dropped the top. I nippled off on the block, I was gon' get into some bullshit. That's the reason why I watch for cops. And keep me two baby glocks, both of 'em loaded with a full clip. Still I gotta be on a mission for paper. But later on I'ma be hangin out with everybody. Never knew I shoulda been scared of the hottie. I got up with later on at the R. Kelly party. So I pull up the club in the Coupe. Look at how them jeans huggin the boots. Saw me ippy uppy icy as hell, f'rilla good smell. Have you ever seen a thug in a suit? Jackin bitches up. Socializin with everybody flirtin with girls but got plans to go home. 'Til I felt the way you was backin up on the thang. Gettin down on the flo' I could see the top of the thong. She a (bad muh'fucker) she could bass a deuce. A fine-ass Medusa make your dick turn to stone. Take a look at the thong, get in the zone, took a shot of Patron. And I was gone, she a (bad muh'fucker). Take a look at them hips, and how she lickin them lips. Like she was lickin ice cream. Ballin with a bad bitch that ain't yours on the scene. Listenin to some Al Green might (""make you do wrong""). [Chorus 2X: Twista + {Lil' Kim}]. That's a girl that you shouldn'ta fucked with. But she so seductive, got a nigga head gone. Now you know it ain't right, got a girl at home. But tonight she the type that'll (""make you do wrong""). {This nigga that you shouldn'ta fucked with}. {But he so seductive, had a bitch head gone}. {Now you know it ain't right, got a man at home}. {But tonight he the type that'll} (""make you do wrong""). [Lil' Kim]. I got the champagne and popped the top. And then unlocked the lock, the Queen 'bout to get her bang on. I don't know what I'ma tell my dawg. When he look up and realize that a bitch ain't came home. Shit, he about to be rockin it. Lookin sweeter than chocolate, he got the smell of a Reese's. Break a fella to pieces, it's a hell of a thesis. Adjustin his body with telekenesis. Got on top and then he knocked me off, until he was soft. Got in the car and dropped him off. Tryin to sink down as low as I can up in my seat. Cause I'm rollin in the Hummer and the top was off. My guy sleepin anyway and that's whassup. But I'm paranoid, drivin fast as fuck. Thinkin 'bout what I did, I try to sneak in the crib. Here come my man in the front, askin me what (""make you do wrong""). [Chorus]. [Twista]. I don't know what you talkin 'bout. Baby whyon'tcha go on back to sleep. I was at the police station, when you hangin in the club. wit'cha boys gettin drunk 20 deep it'll (""make you do wrong""). [Lil' Kim]. If you got up with a ho. Shoulda told the bitch use another douche. If you was at the police station, shoulda smelled like heist. But you comin in smellin like puss what'll (""make you do wrong""). [Twista]. Well I couldn't resist. Cause she was thick as hell and so cute. Steady comin at me, she was throwin it all on me. And I couldn't leave, she had a big dookie shoot, it'll (""make you do wrong""). [Lil' Kim]. Well I know what you talkin about. So we can do it like this. I'ma go and ride, you can do what you do. Cause I done met another brother with some bomb-ass .. it'll (""make you do wrong""). [Chorus]. . by /snipes_"

To me women used to be only fuck foxes. But it's like with you I cherish every kiss. I know it's a risk but you make me wanna come clean. I wanna make you my queen. Put you in a crib and give you plenty green. To help you fulfill all your childhood dreams. Only for your love I fiend. 'Cause the way you put it on me make me wanna scream. And fuck you in places you ain't never seen. In a private boat as we float down stream. Yeah I already know you done heard this before. But the way you make me feel is real. Playas don't love no hoes but stayin' true like you do. Got me head over heals, so tell me what's the deal, baby. 'Cause you lookin' too fine to not be mine. And I ain't gon' never be satisfied. Unless you're on my side to the end of time. I can tell you think I'm lying. But I swear to you girl this ain't no scheme. You stay on my mind, even in my sleep. You keep a nigga havin' wet dreams, on the real. [Chorus 2x]. [Liffy Stokes]. From the first time I met ya, you was on my mind all night. A Maybelene queen with a body too tight. Wearin' black and white and some brand new Mike's. Draped in ice, attitude nice. You the type of woman that I need in my life. To add a little spice, cookin' nigga steak and rice. I can see ud one day man and wife. Walkin' down the aisle, havin' our first child. Plus our marriage worth while. With a brand new lifestyle, I could walk that mile. But baby I need you right now. In my arms caressin' me. I can see your eyes undressing me. Girl it's destiny and love is the recipe. But this way's got the best of me. On everything, I can guarantee you better things. If you just get rid of ""what's his name"". And let me in your world. So I can show you, baby, that my love is real and not a game. So can a brother come through. So I can show you, boo, just exactly what I mean. It don't matter if you fuck me tonight or next month. Babe, only time can reveal a dream. [Chorus 2x]. [Twista]. Baby I'll drink your bath water about a pint. Think I'm ever gon' give your love away, uh-uh. I ain't sayin' you never lovin' another nice stud but shit. I'm cravin' you every night and we just met on a night. But it seems like I've been knowin' you all my life. Ain't it funny how you be thinkin' you never be true enough, but you the one. A helpless seeks succumb, lovin' you more than everything. But my dollars, (?) and smokin' sticky up through the lungs. I can see you havin' my sons, screamin' your name on my next tape deck. In the city, no hear my pretty go. Quick to break a 54, put you on my video. Young and witty hoe, the only thing I'm feelin' pity for. I don't know what I was frontin' on. But I don't see nothin' wrong, sprung or gone. My every heartbeat's weaker, follow the leader. I promise I won't hurt you baby. Don't feel the heatseaker 'cause we gon' be smokin' on sweet cheeba. Take my boo to the mall and go shopping until we fall. Get you the finest things like diamond rings. Even though my mind is strain, I'm tryin' to change. How we fuck and kiss and the hugging make me bind the pain. No lying, no game, you gon' give me some, hey now, we freakin' up in the cut. 'Cause I just sold you a dream hoe, like a girl did to my homie. Your house was spittin' and we fuckin' the uh. A sucker for love, a sucker for love. [Chorus 2x]. [Conversation Between 2 Girls]"
drinks,"Twista feat. Highbeam. . Intro]. This is for my ladies,. Sexy like champagne Glass,. You what I'm talking about,. A reflection of a Pena Colada,. Listen up…. [Verse 1]. I know you heard the terms chicks are like cars,. Well I treat bitches like drinks,. When I step in the club and by out tha bar,. So let me quench my thirst wit you and a friend. Instead of the juice and gin,. Why don't I pour out the drink and you hop in,. Glass full of ass for a true mutha fucka,. Wit that that turquoise Coogi on,. You remind me of a blue mutha fucka,. Your friend was sexy when I seen her in prada,. But I think Gina was hotta,. Cause her skin tone was like a Pina colada,. I saw two Japanese chicks that got bodies,. So I ordered them a mi tia and hot saki,. Then I got cocky,. And asked them do they come to this club a lot,. Well ya got a brotha hot,. Hop in my bubble drop,. Can I get a double shot?. Or get wit these two mamacita one wit the karma of margarita,. The other one like two shots of tequila,. And they all fine I really don't know what to think,. As I get bubble and choose and try to figure out,. [Chorus]. What's my favorite drink,. Girl can I sip on you,. Sip on, [4x]. What's my favorite drink,. [Verse 2]. Know not to bring no Neapolitan ass,. I like the one that makes your face drop like a Neapolitan masta,. No telling what these thick bitches would do,. Reminiscent of a big old picture of Bo,. But hit cha like a slow screw,. Dip in a strip a club in LA wit a bankroll,. Where the weather aint cold,. So I can see some hoes slide down a poll,. I met two dancers named Moet and crystal,. I was checkin they style,. We had a session It was wet it was wild,. Then I dug these two twins thick wit Hennessey one was Remy Red,. Wit skinny legs,. Both of them game to give me head,. Wit a little bit absolute vodka fo they homie Tasha,. Tell her to come closa,. So yall three can give me a Sammy Sosa,. If I was mayor I would campaign ass,. Politician wit women swimming around the champagne glass,. Drunk so much I might earl in the sink,. And if you ask me why,. I couldn't figure out,. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. If you would suck my soul,. I shall lick your funky emotions,. Look at that big old donkey you toting,. I wish I could pour some of you in a bishop cup,. And have a toast wit King Boo,. And celebrating the fact that you thick as fuck,. I holla Church cause its pimps in tha party,. Let me sip on ya body,. Get a good buzz of ya like you lemon Bacardi,. Or a long Island havin sex on da beach,. Or in tha Llac sunroof let back wit a tech on tha seat,. Got a red bone I call her strawberry Daiquiri,. Bring her back fo may,. Carry packs fo may,. Had her suck off my facultay,. Got a little mamma name Mimi,. Who remind me of martini and Asti spamanti,. How she move to my cd,. I got a chocolate chick who deep throat,.

emotions,"Twista feat. Johnny P. . [Johnny P] Let me play with your emotions. [Verse One: Twista]. Well a motherfucker could never control me, only squeeze me and hold me. That's what the hoe came up and told me. Now is she bold G? But in my mouth is where the gold be. Cause I be pimpin her like Goldie. Gotta get paid in this age my fingers ain't made. just to be choppin up confetti with, if it's already thick. you better study nigga if you ain't with it you can get it. cause I ain't even on that petty shit. So who the fuck do I competi with?. The rhythm I kick, is like a rhythmly-wicked-arith-a-metic. Pick em up quick and then give em the dick, thinkin I'm innocent. They up in the mall shoppin for me pickin a fit. I got them heffer's nose red. and when we get in the bed, I be leavin em with rose legs. Stuffin that made em wanna pose dead. but you already got em until you get up in them hoes head. I don't mean to sound bogus or nothin. but it's the bomb when I be havin them cuties thinkin. I'm in love with em, when I'm rubbin em. Be gettin pub with em, in a club with em. Smokin dub with em, huggin em, freakin in the tub with em. After gettin paid from her she ain't trippin. cause she know she got what she paid for. She honor my name, I gotta tame, here it go. Now we speakin with the game on ways to make mo'. [Chorus: repeat 2X]. [Johnny P in background:] let me playyyyy, with your emotions. (Let me play with your) emotions hoe. To the rhythm of a hi-hat, take a puff and lie back. Let me stimulate your mind, body and soul, I know you want to try that. Now motherfucker can you buy that.... Tell me baby can you buy that. I got you under my complete control, you know it's worth more than. diamonds and gold, now don't be bogus and deny that. [Verse Two: Twista]. Now how the fuck you gon' act hoe, I saw you creepin out the back do'. What you runnin from a mack fo'? Lay you on your back slow. cause you know I got you with my lasso. Blow your mind like a afroCome and take a glimpse of the stairs. it's the aroma of a pimp in the air, I betcha notice the smell. It's like a lotus when I flow dis, cause my eyes be the lowest. if you didn't notice then you bogus as hell. I'm puttin women under my spell, like I'm up in their brain. pumpin their vein with game for the anatomy that's feminine. They're fillin em up with adrenaline, got em geekin. we're speakin approachin up a pimp like a gentleman. Submission is surrenderin, it ain't no endin if it's on. with a blunt from the bomb side. In the right place, with the right mind and the right line. you can get a lifetime contract. They be wise until they look into your eyes. a shorty freaked when she spotted mine. Took her over to my crib, lay low, hit her off from behind. then she signed on the dotted-line, the hoe was like. ""Oooohh Daddy... why you doin me like this?. I'd do anything to be with you, you got me gone in the head"". Ya mind, I don't mean to make a disaster up. like my Dad to master love. But if a motherfucker breakin you for every penny you earn. then how could you still show the bastard love?. I guess it's cause I'm cold, shit. Thought you was gon' be spendin me I betcha think you sho' did. but game recognize game, now you lame in the brain. Stupid bitch that's what you get for tryin to gold dig, now. [Chorus]. Yeah, this be Hype, the Verbal Tantrum. Kickin it with my man Twista. If you should suck my soul. I should make your funky emotions. Nothin is good unless you play with it. Play with me baby. [Verse Three: Twista]. I know you think it's blasphemy. but won't you give up when she ask for me? After he passed the beat. Since you said I was your Magesty, I had to see. and when you get paid, there is some cash for me, is it a tragedy. that I can get her so gone, the hoe be trippin talkin up her love a lot. But the only love I got, is when I'm grippin like I wanna hug the Glock. or when I rub the twat, or pickin up a dub at spots. Fuck the hoe thugs, the clubs, and the phony perpetrators with dimes. The speed knots match voo-Do or Die, Psycho Drama, Crucial Conflict. Be pimpin with em gators and dons, collect the papers and dolls. Player haters remarks will get smoked to a blunt dust. Sso keep walkin the next time you hear grown folks talkin. motherfuckers betta shut the fuck up, cause we make the women suck up. You insist to be trippin while we be gamin like Don Juan. What up the filet minion, the grey poupon. them hoes are staked to charm, because we make the bomb. Now I don't mean no harm, but either come on in or get on gone. and let me pull my pouch of snuff. In between your thighs, come take a pull and vibe. and let your tongue go coastin low, now. [Chorus]"
from the tip of my tongue,"[ VERSE 1 ]. Droppin a flow like this be breakin the suckers. And rippin the rhythm and showin I'm bringin the feel of my tongue. And be makin em manifest that I be rockin the young. Flowin this style I be singin and bringin. It's breakin the people and go in the mind of a teen. Be makin em hear it and manifest up in him that I'm a star to become. Quick the lyrical style I'ma kick. You better catch the rhythm of it. Cause hip-hop is becomin complicated, never be left hung. Bringin a style like this kinda quick and crisp. A lyrical twist be comin from Chi-Town. I know that hip-hoppers all over will be stung. [ CHORUS ]. (How was the rhyme brung?). Frum the tip of my tung (7X). (How was the rhyme brung?). Frum among the tip of my tung. [ VERSE 2 ]. Rock the style of my second verse like that of my first. Be showin the hip-hop hypes my types of flowin, but not the best of T. From an imagination this was took, a mental crook. Stirring this up like a chef or cook. I hear them say give me the recipe. Breakin this off in the fashion of an erection of an adventurous style. That I'ma use to just confuse and smart people then go dumb. You say me style be wack cause y'all can't manifest what I be sayin. Think I'm a lyrical midget, watch me then say fee-fi-fo-fum. Flowin this like a veteran that I'm incredible is what they be stung by. When I'ma give in a flow of the funk I erect like a wee-wee. Then see me gee, we be DJ Jihad and T.T.. Steppin and then I'ma find a lyrical line that'll flow from me like peepee. Rockin and me stylin, rockin and me stylin, wildin. Them say me tracks be wack, I just sip them like them coco. Loco, a lyrical thing I sling and cling like Sing-Sing, merciless like Ming. Watch me come and stiff in em like a photo. Funky, funky, funky stylin, wildin. I'ma drop in a flow that breaks and takes a lyrical wiz to wax a funky scholar. Flowin a hyper type of song that I sung from the lung. Breakin em up in a snap, I think that I better thank Allah. [ CHORUS ]. [ VERSE 3 ]. Face the lyrical rhythm of this lick I throw in a blister of a body. Breakin em up so quick that I can even bruise hair. Ryhthm will rock blocks and funky track drops. Don't wanna come in the door but when you're hearin this. Do I hear a 'knock-knock who's there'?. Twista breakin em off in a magical rhythmous manifestation of a lyrical racin. Chasin suckers that my funky rhythm elects. Wrote this, quote this, notice how I wreck. My funky hoocus pocus broke his neck. [ CHORUS ]."
front porch,"Twista feat. The Speedknot Mobstaz. . [Danny Boy]. On the porch, on the porch. Smokin reefa. Hmmm yeah. [Liffy Stokes]. I woke up early Saturday morning sick off Rhemy and brews. Wit a hang over from blues. Hurl on my clothes and shoes stomach on wooz. From this killer weed that's so fired it made your nose bleed. I had me so high, my brain was fried movin at slow speed. This thick bitch chose me and was stickin like liquor. She look to tight that bodies right my heart and mind was like ""Dick her"". But wit my body aching from hurl sensation that's got me shaken. I swiftly took the number and passed on ass that was for the taken. I remember wakin up at the flat fucked up in the back. Checkin on my weed and scratch I damn near fell out the lat. I hit the sack to sleep it off woke up woozy and still smoking. Twista's wishes thinking about last night and the bitch that was scopin. Fuck it lets get 'em on I grabbed the phone ""Girl call your friends"". Then I hit Twista and Maze and them bout the bitch in the Benz. Nigga push only cause I see them already been in the block. You know the lit niggas you'll find us in my favorite spot. And that's on. [Chorus 2x]. The front porch smoking reefa. The weed got 'em feelin umm hmm. On the front porch getting deeper. Ghetto love got 'em feelin, umm hmm yeah yeah. [Maze]. In the summer I hit the front porch wit a morning B. Sippin on the duce duce OZ. And I be killin me how many thick fees I see. Getting bubbly waitin for Stokes and T, I spit a little game at three. Tryin to talk up on the shoppin spree. Or a B of that stinky green free. Straight getting, to puff puff pass. and drive up my gas hittin all the hot blocks. Bumpin ""Legit Ballers"" to ""Rock Y'all Spot"". Everybody know the shit 'bout to drop. See from Northbound to Ten Row in it go tryin to get they props. Pollutin the air wit squares, blunts, and tops. Settin up shops for lots comin back nots. Each and everyday of the week. the Mobsta Elites be on somebody porch dumpin heat. Bustin flows in the cipher getting deep. While we cheat something sweet to Legendary beats. 'Till we reached our peak. Scummy aloud attractin crowds to the street. Then it's time to retreat grab something to eat. And head to the late front to get up wit some freaks. Wit a treat under the seat. For the cats who get the sudden urge and wanna try to jack. Cause when your pockets is fat. It seems like all the haters and hood-rats want to attack. And when the park close we hit the liquor store. for a box of Sitches and a fifth of Yak. South on the corner and get a few sacks. Or betta yet the whole pack so we can get back. On the. [Chorus]. [Twista]. One morning I. Woke up next to a choclate fee and a red bone. My dick was hard I started stroking and poking. After toppin I tell them to role the blunt. Cause on the front I hear them niggas steady smoking and jokin. I heard it's gonna be hot outside gotta get up and lay my clothes out. It's gonna be too many hoes out. Before my ladies rolled out I got 'em to clean up the whole house. Then I threw my fit on look in the mirror get on gone. ""Nigga you looking dope because you got a knot"". Ain't no cruising up out the hop. I'm hangin by the spot cause I had to put the Lexus off up in the shop. But it's all to good it's a hood thang. Never too bogus notice the love on the block that nigga coolin. Aiming the radio out the window steady grooving. Tip by the corner store wit the indo steady movin. Niggas who flippin new 98's is steady cruising. Bumpin up the block flossin for the chicks cause they rich. But I ain't leavin off the front with the blunt. Set a switch just to pull in all the thickest btiches. At the crib I can't get caught wit heat. If it's some static I shall chalk and sweep. I go and get the B's up off but chief. ""Come get me if the phone for me I'm at the party across the street"". I'm enjoying the breeze high degreez and no ease. Pockets be full of G's smoking B's hiding the fees. Making no enemies the po P's yellin out ""Freeze"". Serving niggas wit ease staking cheese so nigga please. Tell me 'bout some ghetto love. Homies around smoking Newports 'till the brew drunk short. You can travel the world can't find a place like home. With a crib on the front with a skunk torch. Ain't nothing lie"

From an imagination this was took, a mental crook. Stirring this up like a chef or cook. I hear them say give me the recipe. Breakin this off in the fashion of an erection of an adventurous style. That I'ma use to just confuse and smart people then go dumb. You say me style be wack cause y'all can't manifest what I be sayin. Think I'm a lyrical midget, watch me then say fee-fi-fo-fum. Flowin this like a veteran that I'm incredible is what they be stung by. When I'ma give in a flow of the funk I erect like a wee-wee. Then see me gee, we be DJ Jihad and T.T.. Steppin and then I'ma find a lyrical line that'll flow from me like peepee. Rockin and me stylin, rockin and me stylin, wildin. Them say me tracks be wack, I just sip them like them coco.

I see any rapper around, 'bout the fuckin mics I left torn. But they won't give me all my peeps, and there's only one shot to get G's. Get love for my MC's at home, but some of them still hate on me. Look how many years I done repped, hustled through the streets in the cold. It's fire but our first rap as ever, signed the contract a decade ago. Put Chi name on records in the East, put Chi name on records in the West. Put Chi name on records in the South, bitch how you gon' open your mouth?. To the motherfuckin industry, why you hate on me and my city?. Would it be an imbalance of power if y'all let Chi niggaz get cheese?. Or is it us holdin us back? Think hard when you rollin your sack.

he lay,"Twista feat. Liffy Stokes, Sko. . [Chorus 3x's]. He lay, he lay, he lay, he lay, he lay, he lay, he lay, he lay. In the grave he lay, he lay. In the grave he lay, he lay, he lay. [Sko]. L-E-G-I-T Ballaz. Screamin' stop killin' for dollars. From G-I, from the South to the Westside. From the D-I and where I love, Darkside. I forever got my pride. Forever guide my guys to a better mindstate or phase. To replace all the wicked ideas erased. All the fears about the payroll. What you say Lo about Sko. We representin' the Chi, do or die for real. Niggaz caps gettin' twist off they tops for real. The conflict's in the hearts of many men for real. The convicts in the Pen holdin' plenty steel. Niggaz know they house bigger but they play in the field. Tabasco ain't gon' let it ride though. Let my brother fat folk. I thrill for the kill. Smoke me a ?. Never runnin' from the mill boy I'm runnin' the field. It's the eternal Lord feel cemeteries revealed. Prophecies prophetcized stuff bein' fulfilled. And to another man I'll never kneel. Until I see Allah, fate's comin' from the wheel. And baby girl, you can check it you can dig it here. If yo nigga try to test it, you can bet it he'll. Be in a grave he lay, he lay. In the grave he lay, he lay, he lay. [Chorus 2x's]. [Liffy Stokes]. It's Liffy Stokes with the sticky smoke. Quick to shoot a muthafucka down if he choke. Never see me in yo city broke. In the club spendin' 50 notes. Leave with 50 girls and 50 Folks. And we all tote scopes. Guarded like the Pope cause we got that bomb on the dope. G-stacks in our coat. Niggaz ask, we ain't hoes. Just to afloat with me, I'm livin' lovely. Baby come on and relax with a Folk. All my mackateers know why we ride down. Cliqued-up pick the bitch up bumpin' sounds, hurtin' the whole town. With raw pound all around me ya dig, the sounds off like a live round. 22's on Fleet, peep my shine now. I got a whole fuckin' nation that'll ride out. And put yo lights out in a matter of minutes young nigga. So it's best for you to be closin' yo fuckin' mouth. Before I pull out and bust slugs in yo ass. You lucky yo bitch here, that's why I'm givin' you a pass. Nigga haul ass before I up and blast with no mask. And blow off you bit of mustache with yo tough ass. Shit everybody's bustin' down. My niggaz fallin' off all around. Before I go, I got my 50-rounds. To blaze a nigga before I hit the ground. He lay. [Chorus]. [Sko]. It's really gettin' hot on the block. Niggaz got they glocks, niggaz sellin' they rocks. But my mind prepared to get this muthafuckin' knot. So a nigga ain't scared to put a nigga in the box. If I gotta drop him down in the grave. In the grave he gon' lay-he. Cause this shit don't stop, I shut 'me down everyday. Everyday anyway he, anyway he. If he grown or not, wrong or not. Niggaz better shake the spot and praise Allah. Don't let me see yo face nowhere by the peace Allah. A laundry mat, niggaz better have they glocks cocked off. Ready to blast off and get yo ass popped off. With 10 hot ones when I draw from ?? when I smash off over there. It's blood on the curb over there. And them niggaz that be actin' like nerds over there. And my niggaz that be flippin' plenty birds over there. For them niggaz that be gettin' on my nerves over there. For my brothers that be gettin' plenty dirt over there. For them ?? broads with all that weave in they hair. Who ain't got no walls, pussy like bees in the air. She dropped them draws and then I zoomed outta there. Cause I got my laws, I'ma stay strong to myself. And I thought about y'all, that's why I ball by myself. I don't need no mob to make me feel like myself. I don't need no job, I'll make these G's by myself. I'ma be aight, breakin' my hands to the left. I can see aight, I smell death on yo brea-ea-ea-ea-eath. [Chorus 4x's]"
heartbeat,"Heartbeat"". [Intro: 2X]. Heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat, breathe nigga breathe. [Verse One]. Oh, Twista told you don't make him mad. You won't like me when I'm mad, I'm a motherfucking beast. Try nigga, imma ride nigga, you still alive nigga. Gon' die nigga, gon' drop, cause ain't no room at the top. Walk in the room like I'm 'Pac, bringing you doom when I rock. Its suicide nigga, blood stains nigga, nuts hang nigga. Bust them motherfuckers from my black, mustang nigga. Yes I shot them with the pound, got them with the rounds. Hollow point to lay his motherfucking body on the ground. Now you breathing and shacking cold, hoping that god don't take your soul. With two bitch straps and a vest is just the only way to roll. Now if you don't wanna die, then I suggest you better try. Breathe hard, hold on to your life, fight nigga. [Chorus: 2X]. Can you feel your, heartbeat?. You still got a, heartbeat. They can take away your, heartbeat. Be strong nigga, breathe nigga breathe. Can you feel your, heartbeat?. You still got a, heartbeat. They can take away your, heartbeat. Don't die nigga, breathe nigga breathe. [Verse Two]. A demon in the club, got them leaning in the club. Hit them with the screwed voice, I got her screaming in the club. Pull up on the sista, according to the scripture. I'ma break 'em off again, when I met them off in the twista. Shit, I'm coming with the pistol, when I gotta kill 'em up. Apocalyptic imma get 'em, when I hit 'em up. Fill his body up wit holes, and the terror that will follow. Will have a nigga hit the deck, when I send it up. Put the pipe to your dome, I don't give a fuck about right from wrong. I get in the club, a nigga be feeling so bold. But if a nigga talk shit, I'll go right for the chrome. Then when you come back, come and see me do it worse. I'ma shoot the vehicle up put your body in a hearse. Bring you back alive like the bullets was a curse. Making the drive or put the ride in reverse. Don't wanna die again better get up in the wind. Cuz a nigga kinda handy with the black four fin. Or I gotta hit him wit the millimeter nine or the rhyme. Either way it'll be a flat line. [Chorus: 2X]. [Outro]. You still alive nigga. You still alive nigga. You still alive nigga. Well gon' die nigga. . by /SnipeS_"
higher,"Twista feat. Ludacris, Wildstyle. . [Intro: Twista + (Ludacris)]. Yeah, you know it's about to go down right?. (Yeeah!) Got to let them know who is this? (Ludacris!). And who else nigga? (Twista, wooo, ahhh!). Uh, uh (check it out). [Verse 1: Ludacris]. Sometimes I think that I got to see a little bit of brighter days. Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage. And you could look to the left or the right but I'm trapped on center stage. And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my ways. I still hear a fool and I track them, distract them, and whack them. Jack a nigga for the day to days and I yak them, attack them, and sack them. Get a weapon and I crack his brain cause I'm a hustler, baller, pro. And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes. But I'm a pimp at night, so talk shit and I'm a lift them up off of they toes. With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's. In a two-seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of dro. Smoking, choking, get them open, croaking. It's so potent - I'm hoping to keep on floating. Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high. I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my!. And I can't hide it or keep it hidden, good riddance I'm felling good. I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood. Would, could, and should break a nigga off. They'll see you later, go to the doctor, hold my balls and (cough). You caused some vapors and I caught the throne, brain blown, honey I'm home. Give me the microphone, and fools is like, ""leave me alone!"". [Chorus: Twista]. Throw it up if you get high, get blow, get drunk. If you want what I'm on, come on and kick it. Let's ride, smoke dro, beat the trunk. All the bad ass bitches that want to party. Just shake it, great players get pumped. Me and my thugs, and hustlers in the party. Get money fuck hoes, get crunk. [Verse 2: Twista]. (Look out!) I put a little bit of hash on some motherfucking purple haze. I feel it all over my body, adrenaline with the Bacardi. Got me up and then rippng shit in a rage. In the netti cofetti with a belly, Gucci. Timberland stepping on the petal up in the Cadillac truck. Want to get me for the wood. Better get the whole motherfucking hood to come and give you some back up. We can get into it and if you want to do it. I'm leaking the fluids out of the bodies that want to come at this. If they all get some blood for fucking with thugs that I bury. My adversaries better not want none of Twis'. Represent for my city, anybody that different with me. Got to get him for thinking it's a game. And whether you from my city or not, talk shit. I'ma kill him especially if he say my name. I've been up on him - I handle my business. And I'm a stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat piller. Murder haters that don't feel a. Niggaz claiming they want to bring it, but really don't be killers. Balling out so hard the size of my rims grow to a hellafied sight-scene. When the dough become no bigger, I'm going to drop that 2003 on 19"". [Chorus: Twista]. [Verse 3: Twista]. We balling out of control, I floss on, play on, pimp on. A speed deamon, pedal to the metal when I'm in the zone. Hang on cause here I'm gone. In the motherfucking wind when I'm sippin on Henn'. I got paper, you owe something. And I done came a long way from letting me hold something, to roll something. Find a body, then fill him up with some adrenaline. And then kill him and send him to the cemetery. With a flow for the whole world like a poet,. Check icy cold, your Pop's so hungry, he mends a berry. Shit, and when it come to shipping good. Who that?, who that?, I got the sack open. And the herb got the flow so strong. Hot them on crack, the track is for back-to-back smoking. Never come up with it unwise, and he. nigga you ain't untouchable when I spark the heat. Coming at you like sharks to meat. the blood is softly, I can tell when a mark is hard as we. Come fully loaded cause I'm hard to beat. always screaming where a beat and the dro at?. You know we love that cut up. In the back of the club with purple in the back crying. Twis' and Ludacris get fucked up. [Chorus: Twista]. [Outro: Twista + (Wildstyle)]. Pass me the... Let me smoke my... (Yeeah, this a Wildstyle production. Twista and Ludacris collabo, get it, get it. get it, uh, yeeah)"

holding down the game,"Holding Down The Game"". [Intro]. Chi town balla k town nigga. Runnin through the streets with my hands on the trigga. And on the block smokin weed with hash. When I breeze pass. I'm bout to run through the game like I was steve nash. Naw naw T naw I feel that shit man but we gotta come with some of that. Origianal twista shit you know. Some of that chi town playa shit you know you know that old shit man lets. Kick that shit T. Alright I got ya cause. [Verse 1]. Take a look at my impala. Make 'em take a look at my chevy capris. Now take a look at my platinum bu500 benz rolling through the streets. In the city of the goals. Shit making money is the mission. I'ma glistenin killin off the competition. Steady tipping cause of how I be pimpin hoes. Now I know just how to treat 'em cause I need 'em. I don't really got to beat 'em so we cool. As long as they bring me my money. Got 'em walkin survin ass with a passion. While I'm talkin better never see you laughin. Know I gotta show 'em ain't a damn thing funny. Twista got game. Finna spit it to 'em hard. Get your dame. Put 'em on the boulivard. Now I got 'em in training with my bottom bitch. She can learn a lot a shit. Like how to get it on a stroll. Be in control and shit on the other hoes. And be able to get fedy for her daddy from a lot a tricks. But the thump bumpin speakers in the trunk. Cause a nigga have to cop a little some some. Leavin niggaz bodies slump when I let the thumpa dump. If I ever catch you fukin with the bump bump. Like a diamond I'm flawless. Aint no fucking with rawness. When you enter my vacinity better be cautious. If you into makin money step into my office. Makin hoes close shop. My flow caine got the block hot. Two for tens got me swoopin' through the city in the drop top. Screamin out I just don't give a fuck. I'm the truth in the booth from when you see me coming through with the crew. I make you do what I do. I'm a win for the city. For the chi till I die cause theres just no givin up. [Chorus: repeat 2X]. I'm holdin down the game. What would you be hatin for. I'm a playa from the go with the shit that you've been waitin for. I'm holdion down the game. Show me how you get buck lil momma. You can make a buck the momma. Niggaz out here like to fuck lil momma. [Interlude]. Take a look at my japer. Now come look at the diamonds up in the ears. Now come take a look at the gators. Jumpers and 150 hat crocadile on the bib. And the ice on my charm. Man I'm no joke came up big in the 04. Now as fast I can kill 'em with the slow flow. Specially if I been smokin that hydrogen bomb. Shit man now thats what I'm talking about. Now thats that origianl twist right there man. Man but you know what man lets gon slow it down man. And take it down south houston style cause. [Verse 2]. Chi town balla. K town nigga. Runnin through the street with my hand on the trigga. And on the block smokin weed with hash when I breeze pass. I'm bout to run through this game like I was steve nash. Aint no fuckin with the twista when I toss words. Thats the 22 up against a moss berg. Feel the thump in your trunk from the fatty chacer. Alias auralius nigga call me gladiator. Spittin screw words at a screw pace. 2 times stronger than them bitches call me screw face. You fuckin with a real ass nigga. Stuffin pockets tryin to make 'em bigger. Gotta let you know. [Chorus]. . by /snipes_"
hope,"[Verse 1]. I wish the way I was livin' could stop. Servin' rocks, knowin' the cops is hot when I'm on the block. And I - wish my brother would've made bail. So I won't have to travel six hours to see him in jail. And I - wish that my grandmother wasn't sick. Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick (I wish). And I - wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer. When the streets get the upper hand understand we lose a brother. And I - wish I could go deep in the zone. And lift the spirits of the world with words within this song (I wish). And I - wish I could teach us all to fly. Take away the pain out your hands and help you hold 'em high. And I - wish God had never gave the men power. To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers (I wish). And I - wish God would've turned they hearts righteous. When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers. But uh - we will never break though they devastate. We shall motivate, and we gotta pray, all we got is faith. Instead of thinkin' about who gon' die today. The Lord is gon' help you feel better so you ain't gotta cry today. Sit at the light so long. And then we gotta move straight forward cause we bite so strong. So when right go wrong. Just say a lil' prayer, get your money man, life goes on... (Let's go). [Chorus]. Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today. Take this music and use it, let it take you away. And be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way. I know it ain't easy but - that's okay. Just be hopeful. [Verse 2]. I wish that you would show some love. Instead of hatin' so much when you see some other people comin' up (I wish). I wish I could teach the world to sing. Write some music and have them trippin' off the joy I bring. Shit - I wish that we can hold hands. Listenin' instead of dissin', lessons from a grown man (I wish). And I - wish the families that lack but got love. Get some stacks, brand new shack, and a 'Llac that's on dubs. And I - wish we could keep achieving wonders. See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder (I wish). You feel me - and I hope all the kids eat. And don't nobody in my family see six feet - ya dig?. I hope the mothers stand strong. You can make it whether you with him or your man's gone (I wish). And I - wish I could give every celly some commissary. And no popo bring the heat on our peace like they did R. Kelly. And I - wish that D.O.C. could scream again. And bullets could reverse and Pac and Biggie breathe again. Shit - and one day they can speak again. I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN. I wish that enemies could talk. And that Super-homie Christopher Reeve could still walk (I wish). I wish that we could walk the path stay doin' the right thing. Hustle hard so them kids maintain up in the game (Let's go). [Chorus]. Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today. Take this music and use it, let it take you away. And be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way. I know it ain't easy but - that's okay. Just be hopeful. [Verse 3]. Wish the earth wasn't so apocaliptic. I try to spread my message to the world the best way that I can give it. We can make it, always so optimistic. If you don't listen, gotta live my life the best way that I can live it. I pray for justice when we go to court. Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war. Why can't we kick it and just 'em on. And in the famous words of Mister King, 'why can't we all just get along?'. Hope we can find a better way to shop in peace. And I - hope we find a better way to cop for keys. And I - wish everybody would just stop and freeze. And ask - why are fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies. You can be wrong if it's you doubtin'. With the faith of a mustard seed, you can move mountains. And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt. Just let it go and keep prayin' on your knees in church (Let's go). [Chorus]. Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today. Take this music and use it, let it take you away. And be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way. I know it ain't easy but - that's okay. Just be hopeful. (Repeat). Na na na na na na na na na. Just be hopeful. (Repeat). Na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na"

i'm a woman too!,"Early in the morning, go jogging!. No food after 6 in the evening!. I wanna change now,. I wanna show you my new image. My nails that I grew out for the first time... When I go out, the high heels on my feet... I'll change just for you. Not as a little girl but as a pretty lover. I hate it when you treat me like a little kid. Even if we've known each other for a long time,. Cant you erase the image of me when I was young?. I am a woman too!. When I am next to you, my heart becomes soft and weak. Everyone is like that when they love someone. I really want your heart. Open your eyes widely and look again. Dont search from far away. Your love is me. When you call, we'll give each other pet names~. When you get made, i'll smile and pretend to be cute~. It will be good, it will be new, if you were my lover. I hate it when you treat me like a little kid. Even if we've known each other for a long time,. Cant you erase the image of me when I was young?. I am a woman too!. When I am next to you, my heart becomes soft and weak. Everyone is like that when they love someone. I really want your heart. Open your eyes widely and look again. Dont search from far away. Your love is me. When I am going through hard times,. there is one person that I want to lean on. There is only you to me. Even when I make mistakes, you will always take my side. I love you! As much as the ground to the high skies. Dont make me wait and worry too long. And come back to your empty seat. I wanna tell you,. The long hidden secrets of mine. I will tell you every single one of them everyday. I love you"
i'm okay on my own,"I can play by myself. I dont cry saying that i miss you. Even when we were together. I always babbled to myself. I liked you so much. So i went over to you and borrowed your shoulder. You, who didnt say much, sometimes laughed.. I was kind of uneasy when i saw that you looked someplace else. But i believed.. Thank you.... For letting me tell you that i love you.. Even if we cant see each other anymore. I wont forget one thing.. Even if im alone.. You said this since the beginning. That there was someone in your heart. Even though i knew, i liked you so much. And sometimes i cried.. Im sorry.. it was just for a while. But i tried to have you. But nothing changed. I was the only one that loved. Look, im doing well alone.. Waiting as i am living... Its ok.."

Since you started askin' me questions on gossip about stars. Girl you better be on script on who you with. She's been forcin' Liffy Stokes from the mobsta click. [Mayz]. I'm chillin' at the click, with nums getting numb, I bumps. Tryin' to find a cutie to kickin' with, watch the risin' sun. Here she comes with them big legs, no fat on the back.

As we lay on my waterbed with the mirrors on the ceiling. The wall too, got friends that's all true, I call Cru. Tryin' to fall too, I got tall brew, it's all you. Or like I be, let's shoot up to the club, like two tattoos. VIP, who gets who, no dancing with two left shoes. Do that fool, do that, do that, who that creeps on my hood. Do I see my nigs thuggin' but, dawg, y'all lookin' good. Ballers please, it's a straight playas party, can't fuck with these. Champagne and Henessies for my G's and stuck a piece, and uh. Haters please, no bustin' we up in place. Put 'em in the trunk, the flame. When I'm tryin' to get up with ""what's her name"". The precious tonight I met, let's ride, I feel this like a set. While you're dancing, I'ma kiss off the sweat. That's how you let me get it wet. [Chorus]. [Christopher Williams]. Baby I'm fine, want you to be on my pager.

it feels so good,"[Intro]. This goes out to all riders worldwide. Let that playa ass nigga Twista be your guide as we go on a ride. where playa hatin killers and the hood niggaz thrive. And lame motherfuckers can barely survive. [Verse 1]. One morning I woke up next to a thick bitch. Took a shower dried off brushed the gold teeth like Slick Rick. Tapped on Obsession colonge like Doug E. Fresh in the flesh. Think I'm blessed with the zest after slippin on my slick fit. The high discover me, hit the front porch. Two women butterly lovely in front of me got my head gone. I sent the bitch in the bed home cuz one of them. got chocolate big thighs and the other one was a redbone. Where y'all goin y'all thick as hell. What's your name I wanna get up with y'all tonight shit. I got some homies that lonely never phony we on some hype shit. Call up the buddies you be tight with. We ain't really gon be doin too much though. We just ridin around bumpin sounds trippin out while we flame janes. Tappin the horn at the homies that gangbang. and slang 'caine to maintain to mob's the same thing. Or we can chill at the crib and play spades or kick some ass a bit. Speedpass the clit and get passionate. Grab the buckle and unfasten it. and we can get into some ol' nasty shit. Live if I could decide to try, don't play me bogus. This ain't no spin move and I ain't got no time to lie. Tell your girls we gonna be sliding by. but hit the weed tip first cause my clique got to be riding high. cause it feels so good. [Chorus]. It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good. (When we ridin high). Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes. Straight pimpin with nowhere to go. And it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good. (When we ridin high). Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes. Straight pimpin with nowhere to go. [Verse 2]. Me and my homies hooked up some cowards took up. when niggas we lust smokin some but the flame tight. Trippin off how we survivin the rugged terrain. and try to hang tight getting fucked up on gang night. Used to be gang fights now we gotta try to relax with the scrap. Even we sent Deebo back to back to back. We still be holdin' stacks of packs. Rollin through wit black blacks, blunt reds, ash trays, and crack sacks. Hustlin and chillin's what I'm focusin on. Fiendin through bitch's cribs hopin it's on. If ain't no strokin we strollin along. Rollin the chrome out really trippin. because we take the smoke to the dome. Bumpin the tunes while bigger roles and herringbones. glisten from all the sunlight. Peepin the fe's with their hair done tight. Booty hung right and every night we see at least one fight. Hookin up with my fellow Westside cliques. Now together we mush. but when are we strapped through and rug cutters. Just like the envy and jealousy throughout the other is love brothers. Ridin every one of y'all my muhfuckers. So put the Black Magic on the tires and get the wax off the chrome. We gon' to blaze on till my brain's blown. Hopin to get my thang on. Not matter what block you stay on kick it. Round the world it's the same song. (so the Mobsters just flame on). For scratch we was willin' to squirt some blood. Now we got up on hittin the cuz. From stealin' tips where they're swum the doves. mo' we got up on some bud. Straight hittin' up the block searching for love. Reach up and hit the deep lung then we gone. Smokin delight the body right what the party like. Are you as live as I come roll with meso we can ride the sky. But only if you let me play with you while we ridin' high. cause it feels so good. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. Sittin back cruising through the slow breeze. thinkin how can I get mo' cheese. Bumpin a system costin 4 G's. I stay on my P's for the po-P's. Split the Phillie with my door keys. Scoop a female to the crib good get my boy to bring a blessin through. Sit on the floor playin Tekken 2. Lesson two I'm adressin you. Turn out the lights like the World Class Wreckin' Crew. Bring out the best in you. Confessin true lies about your inner thighs. and where they been hopin maybe you be my lady. What's the potatoes without the gravy. what you feelin on maybe soft with the silicone baby. but can you pay me?. Cause daily we be riding in the dope stroll. while rockin dope flows I'll lose the spot if I choose to stop. We can cruise some blocks and talkin' about. how later on you comin' out your clothes, shoes and socks. Now is that news or not?. Come I step on the gas slow and smoke on this last ""O"". Get a ""B"" and split it now watch me kill it. Tinted windows took a sealin' off in the Astro. on billets take a choke on so I can really feel it. Thinkin' about not having the rich life. but the hood life was still a good life. and that we know always and forever though. for ever more rollin in the ghetto with nowhere to go. and it feels so good. [Chorus 3X]"

kill us all,"[Verse 1]. I feel Like, I feel Like Standing in the midst of a hundred thousand haters,. Dynamite and C-4 strapped around the waist bloody tears. In my eyes hit the switch making sure any mother fucka in tha vicinity. Blow away and die,. Kill'em off with an explosion. Get up bitches,. Kamikaze on you hoes I'm the sacrificial lamb,. Feelin the fury flow out of every follicle in my body. While you decompose Die with a blunt of dro in yo hand,. I'm uppin the itchy fo fuckin wit Twista. If you fuckin wit me come bet fifty cause it wont. Be an issue-Got some nuts to come get me. Then boy you gone get the picture put the flame in my. Swisher Then hollows penetrate thru yo tissue. Fuck yo fit up wit yo blood as I hear the cries. Of yo homies screamin revenge. Got no mercy on them either go to war wit the. Intentions to annialate everything you stand for. Wit the death of myself cause I'm a believer. The blessings of sacrifice the messenger who. Cometh after the Christ next 1 to glisten after ice. Fuckin wit me is a bigger gamble then a pack of dice. I'll murder you and come at you again in the after life. My brother you cant bring harm wit guns I'm. Armed wit bombs fuck all that shit you carry I got. Yo obituary a muthafuckin phenomenon-cause I'mma come. Till they put all of us in a cemetery. . [CHORUS 2x]. Now come and look into the mind of a man you don't really wanna. Fuck wit. (kill'em all [3x]). Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us. Sucide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch. Kill us all [3x]. Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us. [2nd verse Twista]. Go to war like I'm untochable yellin out bloody murder. While I'm bustin you 2 deadly fingers squeezing twin. Triggers steady touchin you screamin like a demon. Like I'm finger fuckin you. Just put my body in a room wit the enemy and I got. A grenade I'mma pull the pin out the sum bitch. Pop 17 sins out the gun clip smoking dro so fire. I was on 10 after 1 bligg. Nigga you have now entered the chainsaw massacre. Takin more blood than a 2000 dracula slip the clip in the. Automatic and get to bustin horrific hollows while you. Prayin to jesus of Nazarus. A 7 day theory like makaveli flowin on a track that's. Scary wit a Mack in the back of the pelle. Spectacular how could you dare me knowing I'm already willing to die. I'm comin back after they bury me. Its time for yo confessions I be the priest. Celebrate and salute the sign of a suicidal soldier. Better become a bible holder as I start to massacre. Men with a verbal recital that's colder. Deaths coming closer as you let kamikazi. Enter yo body careful or you die standin vertical. And anyone that opposes I swear to God I'mma get you. Even if I gotta murder me to murder you. [CHORUS 2X]"
korrupt world,"[hook]. Hold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up. If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up. For the ones who never gave it up,. Take a champagne glass and raise it up. Agony was the feelin' when I saw his blood spilling. Poppin' lip and taking over his tip is why he had to kill him. Now his bodies in chalk and no longer can talk so then a life is lost. Somebody tricked off and the killer was caught. So now his lifes his cost. You might get caught. So to make a move these motherfuckers is petrified. All the best that tried won't even slide. So just bless the rest that died. Is it a test of pride when inside. You grip a trigger but you didn't wanna pull it. Could it be a motherfucker that you notice. On the other side of the bullet. Should it matter now you figure fuck it I'ma waste him. It's just a murda for the nation. But some end up locked up, broke up. For felonies and over overly motherly abrasion. Now in front of me encased in a coffin is a body. With people around sad and froze. Teardrops and rain. But folks didn't really feel the pain until the casket closed. I was drastic chose and the mother threw a frown. Even though the gunner was found. Cause it seems like yesterday when he was running around. Now he under the ground cause they gonna get down in these streets Even. though you pack a piece for heat these niggaz urgin' to bust. The game ain't the same so stay away from the curb. If you out there serving em' up and. [hook (repeat)]. w/ ""make a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt"". Agony was the feelin' when I saw his blood pouring. Tragedy mess a man look in the mirror then I see the stud mourning. As these streets erases others it encase a brother. You had enough heart to waste this brother. But could you face his mother I was faced with other. Type of problems that had held me back. Couldn't tell me jack now I'm gone in my own zone. You ain't gotta tell me that so me trail me back to a time. When a motherfucker 'd lost his will survive. Me and my folks had to hustle and steal for a meal. Eat or had to kill to survive. I remember when you had my back. When the relative passed and my momma cried. When the house caught flames. You collapsed in my arms when you heard that father d' died. I take drama in stride. Even though I had to go through a thing to get myself together. Still suffer but the worst is gone. So it's on till' the roamin' man have his shelter. But if I end up back on the streets again and I had to recieve my fate Smoke. weed at the wake so the pain and hate escapes. To keep the kids straight. Cause you did straight if your seed proceed. As long as they keep learning and keep growing up. Right now we survive in a place that's full of doubt. And about to self-destruct. [hook x2]. Visualize in invisible eyes how I individualize. Critical cries of pitiful skies that rain pain upon the ghetto land. Where the unforgettable dies. Subliminal lies mean a motherfucker never gone make it. If he don't peep it and keep it in check soon. Womb to the tomb death is in the next room. If a nigga ain't realizin' a k's and tech's doom. Let's assume another brother wanna laugh at you. I think he just took a blast at you. You won't have it you killed him. There go the trigger try to kick it but his niggas coming after you Telling. you a stranger must be crazy. To step it to a motherfucker that's dangerous. Cause it's a gang of us throwin' knuckles in the scuffle. If we have two things of bust. It's cocaine to us and my brains to dust. I represent you up there so I try. Long as I leave my enemy bust vacinity crushed. I don't really give a fuck if I die. So why lie my people should be glad to survive in the land of the lost It's a. plan of the boss leaving motherfuckers dying. With their grandmother's hand on the cross. So I take a stand when I talk ran instead of walked. To chalk another victory. How you did the caper hid the paper. Breaking other niggas off is a mystery. With the chemicals and drugs all of these criminals and thugs. Just keep comin' up better watch yourself ain't no love in the streets In a. ghetto of a world that's corrupt. [hook]"
lavish,"""Lavish"". (feat. Pharrell). [ad libs for the first 14 seconds]. [Chorus: Twista + (Pharrell)]. You, you, you want the lavish crib and fancy cars. You want the face, on that Rolex shinin like the stars. Don't worry mayne, you could get it mayne. (If you look in the sky and you don't see your dream). (Man don't feel defeated, cause trust me you can build it). [Twista]. Now hear the words that I flow when I spit. I know shorties that be havin dreams of goin legit. But the hustle quicker so they cop a fo' on the split. Now they got enough money where they can go get a brick. It's on - ain't nuttin gon' stop us now. Gotta look at 24's while they watch us now. Spinners rollin up the block while they pump out noise. But they always get into it with the jump out boys. And why? Take a look at all the people that got dubs. You ain't legitimate, you out here servin them rocks up. I know you want the radio and screens to pop up. But we gotta get the money and try not to get locked up. Know the difference between real and fake. Different work is just like different real estate. Open your mind, you got more than the skill to take. Cause I know. [Chorus]. [Pharrell]. Uh, one time for my niggaz on the corner. With the burners on and with the fresh yams in they tube socks. Uh, two times for my niggaz with they hands in the air. Sayin a prayer cause the game left their dude shot. Yes - I know that puzzle. Niggaz at each other thinkin they will bust you. The bang is the same even if it's muffled. But the moment so loud when a dead man hug you. He's cold in your arms, but you ain't gon' be foldin your arms. You gon' be lowered in your arms. Cryin to open the jar, and to add injury to insult. You're smokin your life away. Look at me, big car big house big jewels. All that came out my backpack. You ain't gon' do it, it ain't gon' work, you ain't gon' prove it. Even though that hurt, I just skated past that. Look - everybody got dreams about ki's. Chains full of ice with S after the V's. Horse on the hood, a grill full with the B's. Dangling your feet in San Turin-y breeze. Make a virtual picture, and spin around. That ain't it, well fuck it nigga we get it down. Never try to grab your ankle nigga we'll kick 'em down. Focus up, we gotta hit it now. Bruh when your cell goes clink, that's when you forfeit. All them dreams, all that divorce it. You ain't even get to see new mansion and Porsche shit. This dedicated to my man up in Norfolk, locked up. [Chorus]. Ha ha... wait [repeat 2X]. My nigga open yo' mind, mind. Aren't you ready to go?. All of my fears inside, side. Let 'em blow like 'dro. [Twista]. Through the wisdom of a prism I see I don't wanna go to prison. I make the decision to get liver. Reminiscin as I take a listen to my nigga 'Pac. While I envision my ""Ambitions Az a Ridah"". Listen to Pharrell spit to the track. Pull up in a burgundy Bentley with a bitch in the back. I get to the paper like a hyper get to the crack. I ain't speculatin homey I just stick to the facts, c'mon. If you wanna get the money and the status and the mob. Better ride when you roll with the crew. Take a listen for the bub hit the bud. When you hear this in the club then you know what to do. Look at the vision of a mack spittin crack on the track. Throw these stacks in the black Cadillac. Get it like Twista and Neptunes, I got your back. And know you. [Chorus]. Ha ha... wait [repeat 2X]. My nigga open yo' mind, mind. Aren't you ready to go?. All of my fears inside, side. Let 'em blow like 'dro. Ha ha... wait [repeat 2X]. Ha ha... wait [repeat 2X to fade]. . . by /snipes_"
legit ballers,"Twista feat. The Speedknot Mobstaz. . [Twista]. Once again, another Trax productions. Rush for the 9-8, mobsta elites. Ain't it a shame how we make ballin' look so sweet. Especially when you ain't gotta hide your shit. You know what I'm sayin', you can just ball for free. Campaignin' your nation, in a legit demonstration. And gotta face incarceration. Eh yo, Liffy Stokes, let 'em know what's happenin'. [Liffy Stokes]. A nigga been hustlin' so long, God knows I've done so much wrong. I was 16 grown and holdin' chrome, servin' blows, we in' zones. My mom didn't understand me ""Boy, you gon' die just like your daddy. from two to the head, dumped in the riverbed. I didn't to hurt you so badly,"" I was young and dumb. Fast life sprung of the money and hoes that it brung. Had a clip full of hollows to bring your momma sorrow. But now regret what I've done. Drama's all in the game whether gang bang or slang. I had to do my thang. When the shots rang, that's when it clicks in my brain. All the shit's the same. My nigga need a change, I had to get off out these streets. To get you out your seat. Flip a Trax beat, hit the crib and puff on a sweet. And let 'em feel something deep. Deep so the realest can feel. How I felt right before I bust that steel. Rappin 'bout my life of skrill. And the everyday struggles of a nigga in the chill. [Chorus 2x]. Come on and take a little trip with a legit balla. Chi shot-callers (Shot up the chrome and let's swang). Tigers all up in the wall. (Some bitches in the back and a pocket full of scratch. take a match and spark up a little bud and get blown away). [Mayz]. This shit I've been tokin' is potent. Got me straight thinkin' about takin' Mary Jane and eloping. Blowin' smoke with the sunroof half-way opened. Countercode with the scope in close range. I guess he gotta aim, and stick a few thangs in the nigga's brain. No face straps (?) thinkin' that he can. Puttin' food on table is an everyday strain. But now I did finally flip my shit legit. And workin' a different angle of the game. Even though my hussle ain't changed. I'm still prayin' my best presence to overcome my pain. Singin' tapes of cain. The roads to riches seems longer than the freight train. And every little stop keep a nigga tryin' to plot. On the paper you done gain until you drain. But I put that on the foe. I'ma flow 'til I got no choice, or better yet no voice. But still by that time I hope to write enough rhymes. To own a fleet real estate with a Rolce Royce. Rollin' deep through this Chi-Town streets. With my mobsta elites on the way to North Riverside Mall. Givin' thanks to the all for givin' me a legit where to ball at. Keepin' shit tight for y'all. [Chorus 2x]. [Twista]. On the bus in disgust will I able to throw rocks in my pocket. Nickel sacks in the other. For po-pos who watch, can't stop, it's hot. But I gotta make a profit for my baby and my mother. Straight up hustler. What's the mental frame of mind. That nigga had to have the roll. Be sold, or be poor up in these city streets. Or with the pistol playin' for you Mr. Reaper. Forgive those, I explode like c-4 so give me 50 feet. Bustin' shots in every directions. a nigga stop a moment from getting made. I done witnessed public aid, people get sprayed, the tip raise. And momma cry, why my bills won't get paid. If I have to I'ma send cheese from blows. Nobody can hurt me or run thugsta greed, GD's or foes. Workin' the spot 'cause we need some clothes. Who ever thought I'd be making money off of my CD's and shows. My crib got gats in the hall, rats steady crawl. Roaches comin' out the cracks in the wall. On the tip, bust it with my back to the wall. Work my way up to an ounce, now I'm back to a ball. Now I fin to spend stacks at the mall. Bend the blocks on barbers hopin' my profits stack a bit taller. Twista AKA ""The Bitch Caller"", bring your money to the mob. Just to be a pimp-shit talker. [Chorus 2x]. [Twista]. If it's on, I gotta ride out with my mobstas, hmm-hmm. It it's on, then I gotta ride out with the mobstas, hmm-hmm. If it's on, I gotta ride out with my mobstas, hmm-hmm. If it's on, I gotta ride out with my mobstas, hmm-hmm. La-da-da, la-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da (Mobstas). La-da-da, la-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da (Mobstas).

This muthafuckin' Chi shit, check it out. [Chorus 1]. The niggas in my mob can't be touched. You best to mob up to come fuckin' with us, oh no. Niggas in my mob bring the heat. You best to mob up fuckin' with the elite, oh no. [Liffy Stokes]. You just a bitch in the sky, I hear cries. 'Cause you can't whistle for your guys. Surprise when you saw this pistols in your eyes. So I peal like mere mortals, bet I shoot bloody portals. To muthafuckas who owe us, niggas die, causin' horrifyin' (?). My passion for blastin' made me an assassin on all enemies that work us. Whose purpose is to serve (?) timbs 'til they high and they hurt us. Murders got us murders, I pull my weed and gun out. Blastin' 'til they run in the house while I got the blunt in my mouth. [Mayz]. We in a rage bustin' rapidly like when I'm on stage. It don't get no rougher than Liffy Stokes, Twista and Mayz. In the blood of your day, then lay flat on your back. Then while he fuckin' your hoe. The mob gon' be straight coppin' you stack. [Twista]. Your mob lacks, I'ma defeat you run three-two on contact. Cogniac, get me strapped with the black gat itchin' to bomb back. Hoes can't get no sleep. Bullets hit your chin for the grief that you bring us. Shots hit his face as he grabs his chest. Then we watch him bleed through his fingers. Now come on, come all, but if all come all fall, fuck all y'all. We road dawgs, then I come gunnin', niggas runnin' like they sold y'all. In the heat of the night, the (?) static we start up. Guards up, while we come strapped they come ready to mob up. [Chorus 2 w/ 1]. If it's static, one of my niggas gon' get two niggas. Two of my niggas gon' get four niggas. Four of my niggas gon' get more niggas. That's more triggers meaning more killers. You muthafuckas better mob up. [Repeat]. [Liffy Stokes]. It's a static, it's automatic, so grab the automatics. And pumps and pull the triggers and make some niggas look acrobatic. I was cold but frantic, the foes have panicked. They got bloods blew out their dome, bet the bullets run rapid. I kept bustin' for the love of hustlin' squeezin' my wesson. Ruger, gang (?) maneuvers, niggas wanna be bruisers but I'm a shooter. Fuck the squad, because when it's said and done. Liffy Stokes will do some poppin'. [Short Skit]. [Liffy Stokes]. Nigga the devil's knockin' at your fuckin' door. With some hot ones and toe. And ready to hit 'em with nothin' less than four. Nigga let me go, I'm 'bout to pop this bitch. You know you know the lick, art of the mobsta click. Fuck the argument, mob elite's runnin' up apartments. Kickin' in doors pistol whippin' hoes be heartless. Searches as the bullets marches between your arches. Make one call and wait and reload the cartridge. [Chorus 2 w/ 1 - (2x)]. [Mayz]. You can't even mess with a mobsta, nigga, is you sick in the head. I torture that ass and have you overdosing on lead. Or maybe I just leave you cut up, drippin' and dead. With your crew skippin' town scared, my lead gon' lead their ass red. Don't get misled, don't mistake me for somebody but a soldier. The elite niggas got more death than AIDS and ebola. Getting old and colder. I be quick to (?) start uppin' but that chip off your muthafuckin' shoulder. [Twista]. Behold the stack folder, gun holder, AKA blunt roller. Mayz if I die for you get your (..?..) and trap holder. To hurt particular niggas comin' with perpendicular figures. Crushin' triggers, y'all niggas better bring back some memos. [Mayz]. It really don't matter if that nigga pack a glock or a gauge. 'Cause whatever the fuck Mayz blaze gon' make him see his last day. Takin' 'em out, my life and makin' sure his cast stays. Jack 'em for his last days, that's how livin' fast pay. Nigga, you know the word on the street. It's the mobsta elite that's servin' the streets to the rockin' these beats. You better have a nice way to greet us than rolling with your guys. And you could still die in a multiple homicide. [Chorus 2 w/ 1 - (2x)]. Let's mob up. [Chorus 1 - (2x)]"
mobstability,"Twista feat. The Speedknot Mobstaz. . [Liffy Stokes]. Nineteen-ninety-muthafuckin'-eight. Mobsta elite's back up in this muthafuck 'em (Bitch). And we airin' out all you playa-hatin-lame-ass niggas. And we on this laid-back track, something smooth. Eh yo, Mayz, whatcha don' do, kick it. [Mayz]. And ride on, niggas get your high on. While we pump this shit to vibe on. The muthafuckin' mobsta elite'll leave you breathless. When we hit you like this. Early in the morning, hop into the Chevy Caprice. I'm hurtin', so I'm thinkin of ways to gettin' paid. Cheddar in a bundle, fifties and hundreds and G stacks. If I could just hit that big lick I could relax. And ease back off of thuggin' and stick to hustlin'. Concentrate on paper and let the shorties do the bustin'. While I motivate on power moves, you live be coward rules. Singing the blues while I pack shit that'll knock you out your shoes. 'Cause I'm a fool playing the game of the streets. Claiming elites, making sure my family eats. We roll and it flees, bunkin' niggas out of their seats. While mobbin' on beats, soon niggas can't back down or retreat. Preventing mine, just doing petty crimes, I'm not petty or nice. Standin' in line, calmly waitin' on my time to shine. 'Cause when I shine, I'ma glisten. As all the heads come up missing. I'ma slide in and assume the position. My mom's stick thick, who the killas and convicts. Bulletproof now, pistol holsters under the arm pits. Ready to go out in the blaze of glory. Standin' firm on the deck makin' the front-page story. [Chorus]. When your mobs' at your side and they're ready to ride, nigga. (Nigga, that's mobstability). And when you go from movin' O's to keys for more cheese. (Fool, that's mobstability). And when it's money over bitches 'cause you're stackin' your riches. (Playa, that's mobstability). Gettin' your mind right for payin' for the year 2G. (Gotsta be mobstability). [Liffy Stokes]. I heard a raw beat, somebody told me the funk did it. But if Trax didn't do it I can't fuck it. 'Cause it's a family thang. You know Chi-Town's the motherland of the wild. The chain of mobsters and gangs. But we're the elite few that just can't be contained. Tippin' only the plane, determine it's about the game. Like a playa stays the same, ain't tryin' to act strange to change. 'Cause the more paper you got, the more you got to slang. And there's more haters to bang 'cause they all want a piece. You got to be slick as grease 'cause they want the playas deceased. Restin' in peace. But my motto's simply too tight for you to threaten my life. With a knife, gun or mic. You don't really wanna fight so just swallow your pride. Before I come inside your crib and kidnap the shorty and bride. Every nigga alive wish he had a psycho status. Will your punks ready to ride so the bitches can come at us. In the city of thugs, police, politicians and drugs. If they ain't passin' the bubble, niggas carry a grudge, but no love. So I don't give a muthafuck if you killin' me. I'm pissin' out headshots, protestin' my mobstability. [Chorus]. [Twista]. If I'm not into nothing, I don't feel right. So I circle the block strapped. Watching the workers while they circle muthafuckas at night. They work to tippin' me 'cause dope fiends ain't wangers. These wanches are skanches, this ain't just how the cracks and hiatus. My crew react tamers than sweat hogs, to protect that (?) bomb. But no teflon, your flesh was tearin', for the love of this heron. I bare arms and I'm quick to snatch cards to those who react hard. Don't judge these, got you robbed, I'ma get more cheddar for my black mob. My legion is broke down into sections to run every regions. Slugs and thugs, rifles for rifles 'cause we walk every season. Having shootin' apartments, cars with hidden compartments for po-pos. Zip polos holding pistolos and mobstas know those. Sooner then booted, looted then zooted, (?) shoes so can I. Automatics but semi, then I, watches your midnight. 'Cause I be handlin' my function when the nine-milliter get to jumpin'. Dumpin' on niggas who claimin' my muthafuckas ain't worth for nothin'. I'm bustin', how's game I peep when I was a shorty. Having big dreams on money, cars and bitches by the time I reach forty. Nation affiliation, dummy paper-chase and willin'. For pay probabilities only seen through mobtability, feelin' me. [Chorus]"

My click been strugglin half a lifetime tryin to get our shit on. got no G's to sit on, even so niggas sell packs to get on. but let me take you to a place. where these niggaz learn to better pain and stress. look a murderer in the face, comin up with a wilder range you're blitzed. 1, 2, 3, and to the 44, the good, the bad, and the ugly sticken you. fleein through the front door, and we gotta do one more. even though dealer watchin me like the lottery. we can still fulfill this westside oddessy mobster prophecy. Well mobbin what can be better than weed, drinks, bitches and loot?. hangin off 20 G's cause you got more money to scoop. lives a hustler by nature, fiend for paper, schemes and capers. constantly eyed by neighbors, who do the Feds favors?. it aint no major dough, what this lady yeya blow. as long as its payin me for my occupation criminal. pullin up on hoes, as the weed smoke blows, the absence of a mobsters presence. is the reason she chose, as the regency rolls, it rolls, the pearl white O's. mobile, shit im a ride high til i die, get killed. smoke like fields, forever dodgin blue shields,. we're blue steel i got full proof escape skills. we're paper chasin leavin trails of shell cases. and chasin to the part of your body. where the bloods wasted, on the life taken. Chicago aint a city its a nation. its all this my foundation within the mobster organization. [Chorus:]. If its gonna be shakin it up, if its gonna be cookin it up. if it aint hustlin and we got some skunk we gonna be smokin it up. (well I'm a payin mobster for life, caught with gold and ice).

[Verse 2:]. Im a fat booty fuckin, love gettin the sucks in and bustin. givin niggers punkin heads for nothin, while bumpin, handle my functions. my pistles pumpin, got hoes jumpin, a mobstas always into somethin. I can feel Killuminati lookin over my shoulder. somethin keeps tellin me to get mine before its over. smokin on plenty of buddahs, the brand to get blessed, with forgiveness. for the last time I'm sent on the survivin quest. from hustlin 24-7 to makin niggas get undressed. The mobster in me got to be obsessed. with lucci and success, so I can care less. if I gotta be lootin and woopin,. I'm sick of beggin niggas for rides. id rather be the one thats scoopin. cause in these last days its day to day hustlin for me, i wont rest here. everyday. fat ass chain and 3 blades,. trippin on that 2 faced, that nigga sweatin dick. while i rock the stage,. like these bitches is just tryin to get paid to give a nigga AIDS. like I can use it for turnin tricks. or either for hittin licks and then rap about the shit. in one the mobster's greastest hits,. and when we come to your town(?)then raise it. finest skunk we just can roll it up and blaze it. [Chorus (2x)]. Im gonna make it through this New World Order if i gotta be rappin and robbin. you cant stop the Speedknot from mobbin and if you try we squabin. we waitin for you to fall off the square so you best keep your head up. when these shots how niggas roll, cause we dont believe in goin head up. On this week 100's, 50's, and dubs, trigger finger itchy with snubs. hit me wit love, black gloves, red eyes (?). t-shirt up on my face, fucked up and ready, I cocked the 380,. got a grip that was steady adrenaline. rushin po-feddy, while lives is rolled with Sisqo. may we rock the tightest flows but tinto up with the clips though. gotta find out what yo pockets hit fo, cause i aint that scummie. mother fuck (?) got no time for rockin,. choppin in the car stoppin with a stack ofpacked money. but you trustin me, then I cup this shit,. snatch all of your luxury, try touchin me. actin tough as shit, my moms is a bust for me. fuckin me or make me hate you,. permanently sedate you, when the bullet penetrate. you its goin straight for your face you, unless we chase you. when we escape through your pockets. by all means neccesary the rest is secondary. comin for back til my flesh is buried, the test is carried for me to survive. and hope we still will be thick, with a trilogy click but now seven. mobstability shit.

motive 4 murder,Twista feat. The Speedknot Mobstaz. . [Liffy Stokes]. the stress of everyday living is slowly corrupting my soul. Im 2 months out the joint on papers walking with 3 years parole. I did 4 and a half a slab and shit a nigga was dying. I'm finally back in the world and its hard but I'm still trying. not to fall and risk my freedom again trying to ball. while waiting for this pussy ass job to call. and it ain't hopping. got me tipping to hear them things popping. cash bags dropping. with plenty of cane for recopping oppurtunity knocking. its what I'm on. I cry when I'm at home cause I'm alone. 24 years and grown with a future unknown. my heart was torn from the pain of being back in the game. but I'd rather die getting my hussle on and live like a lane. so its back to pistols and cane. plotting on licks hitting stains. the mob life runs through my veins. its too late for me to change. these streets got me deranged. strapped up and paranoid. ready to add on situations I can and can't avoid. plus big voices getting hot. they constantly sneaking on blocks. they trying to bring me in unconscious. but them pins got popped. now they got me on the run. cherishing every last breath. but I ain't going back. its freedom or death. that be my motive for murder. [begin CHORUS]. [Liffy Stokes]. now I know you the judge of life and death. I ain't evil or nothing. but somebody done brought me pain and sorrow. so I'ma have to kill something. let me count the ways that I can repent. trying to stay holy and focused. but that evil in his eyes let me know that nigga too bogus. that be my motive for murder. [Twista]. I'ma survive these streets another day. I know the pain in my heart won't go away. these mother fuckers try to murder me. and won't nobdy hurt my family. thats what he gotta die. [end CHORUS]. [Mays]. 9 times out of 10 you can find Mays trying to hit a better lick. if it ain't coming up with the dopest shit. then I'm trying to cop the thickest brick. cause life in the belly of the best. is equal to povertys bottomless pit. where bitch niggas trick. and thirsty mother fuckers beat you out of everything you get. but it seems like everybodys trying to make some type of come up quick. before its too late to get straight. and the most I make is final pick. anywhere they shit like riding slick. with a thick chick slobbing your dick. even if it means fighting these niggas in cases. as long as neither ones thick. cause I swear when I get hit. I go in a crucial rage like a flick. turn straight lunatic. making all these bitches niggas hear their final tick. but that don't mean my minds sick. just cause I'm motivated by a lot of cheese. when trees by the p's. and fuckin fine fee's and 3's with ease. for sho the skilled poets. within in the mask up kill for it. I'll whoop a fiend with a crushed grill. I'll bet his dumb ass'll stil blow it. bullshit ain't nothing. I'm trying to get this first mil in the bank. and drive a bullet-proof hummer tank. so the next haters who try to air me out come up blank. and I'ma have to sacrifice your life. with a wrath thats stronger than christ. and forces of life thats know to do damage to human eyesight. I guess its true. moneys the route of all evil. cause crooked or legal. its all manipulated by the eagle. and be my motive for murder. [CHORUS]. [Twista]. lord knows I was hurt from a judge from the start. how I'ma hide love from this mark. this nigga made my homie die in my arms. had to put a slug in his heart. mother fuck that stuff. it was just a grudge on his part. my boy was young and ambitious. took his dreams and wishes. try to do right but my attitude like blast them bitches. drowning all my sorrows in bottles of yack. and a quarter ounce of dro want a rap. I'm bout to snap. here come the big pay back. looking up on the dresser for the black and gray strap. I'm crying and shit. I was hurt so bad I felt I had to go kill him. even if a slug hit him. I was still hurt enough to aim at myself and die with him. can't control them pains. now its time to throw them thangs. visions of the stud don't stay. empty the clip of am out right. ambulance come around. by the time the hypes. taking of his nikes. I know it sound cold. but this bullet put a hole in my soul. ?never shorties years stole?. he was only 17 years old. and at the funeral I got to watch his mama's tears roll. and I know he used to wild sometimes. carry a 9 but you took away your sunshine. no more reminising on the fun times. balling and coming at bitches with blunt lines. but this nigga ain't going to want mine. for the pain I'ma handle this funk and dismantle this junk. fuck all that. in all black and then pumped. to run up on this nigga. tip up on him then jump. mission to kill armed with a fist full of steel. eyes gleam with the fury. never thought I'd be facing to 2 mothers. in front of a prosecuting team and a jury. how did one murder turn into 2. revenge had me shooting thorugh hate. I couldn't stop. in the mist of the action. is when that little ? got shot. all because of my motive for murder. [CHORUS]

no remorse,"Twista feat. Mayze, Malif, Link, Turtle, Liffy Stokes. . [Liffy Stokes]. I hang wit pullers of automatic triggers and gold diggers. My mob's full of go getters. Go live or die by the cold niggas. Wit drama bringers ear ringers and pistol slingers with itchy fingers. Getting high on inhaling nigga smoke that lingers. Buck wild hostile we verbal barrels threw nostrils. My hollow point apostles turn living flesh into fossils. It's through gospel niggas will wet it vick Malif'll shred it. Beef on these streets only gets the best of you if you let it. [Malif]. Well it's that Westside nigga from K-Town always gonna stay down. Lay pounds on the table, smoking while watchin cable. I'm able to lick the shot from the porch of my block. And when the gun spray stops there's no information for cops. Nigga I'm heartless some say I role wit the forces of darkness. But the closest I burned to death is the reason that I spark this (Spark this what). Dramafied premeditated homicide that coincides with the day you die. Cause G, I'm about to let it ride. [Chorus 2x]. Petty niggas down when the bullets fly,. no remorse your fuckin wit a mobsta. For fuckin wit a mobta. If you got your shit right then run and hide,. cause I got a slip quick clip on the side. For fuckin wit a mobsta. [Turtle]. Fuck the car jack we do a body snatch. Tie niggas up in the trunk wit them rats like a mac for owning scratch. SpeedKnot's unstoppable muderin as many niggas as possible. Makin heaven a hospital, and where I'm from it's highly probable. In a Benny reefa roller street patroller stackin clips for lethal loadin. In the city where secrecy's golden. Live or die in the Chi, we kill demeanors wit inferred beamers. Death is the sinner. whether the Reaper awaits your fate with your soul on his finger. [Mayze]. Nigga you can't retreat. When the Mobstaz greet you with bullets like Robert De Niro on Heat. And makin killin look sweet. See a nigga like Mayze break the safety I hold the clip 'till infinite. To show your definite when I make you cry blood like I broke your virginity. Shit my Mobstaz is straight cheat vs. killers for cash. Quick to stick your ass and flash this 3-80 and rainbow macs. And now you thinking of bringin that bull shit in this direction. Just cause you rap a lot don't mean you can't get a lethal injection. [Link]. Picture Link the mercenary fuckin you like missionary. Position them missile carriers precision 'till them bitches buried. But a mobstaz sip on Sherries snitch niggas sing like canaries. Where we wrong be carrying clone Periyon and Herringbone. We on the streets in territory we chill come and get you chest pealed. Hot steal and banana clips standing on tip you get your flesh filled wit rhinos. Energies feel for my soul they holdin captive. Visions of living strengthy posses me lets make it happen. [Chorus]. [Twista]. Smokin on sweet reef for the beat freak. Cause it's in the heat seaker of the street sweeper. Think I'm lying if you want shit is deadly as slugs. Got you swimming in the blood like sea creatures. Cause you done lit to the land of the lost. where our straps looking as pretty as bitches. But pullin up in a hearse to a church is the curse of these hideous witches. Hittin hoes wit, 44's and four by fours wit the pain of a figure four. Wounds hit you like a hit will blow. Every nigga on this track I'll pull a trigger for. If you test the rock vest, pullin slugs like a lockness. I'm a for show protect my chest. Everything in holes is what I unload and not less. Until meals make progress. Y'all niggas no who y'all be never let me see your face in my spot. While you still be facin your block I'ma be erasing you block. Snappin off like Jason on rocks tastin your knots. Cause when it's pockets for profit. I can't stop it this mob got me. If you ain't gonna pop it don't cock it. Cause if we working you, ready to us carrying clips that's reversible. Takin all our business personal diss wit a verse we all hurtin you. Bull shit aside, (Niggas is knowin I fill another wit holes and not hide). Better role if not ride unless you hoes don't got pride. No remorse when your fuckin wit a SpeedKnot Mobsta.

Fuck what the punks are talkin bout. I wanna get up with that big ballin bitch. plus niggas feelin what I'm on as well. Plus got my mind in the zone. The one that's rocking fresh Pelle Pel's. Sweet tooth'll shine on his bone. Somebody beatin up the block on fresh rider rims. If it's me hell, you can tell by the design on the chrome. Crying on the phone. Hoe thinkin I'm in love with her. cause she took me shoppin and had me tryin on cologne. So I left her on the line with the tone. Got up with this other bitch. Brought no weed cause she fire'n up her own. So hurry with the Phillie bitch, I'm really sick. off of some illa shit. Here go a rusty razor blade, but still it split. and fill it with the killer shit so I can really trip. It's like the bud was tailor made for milli-clips. and mac-10's, I lit the b from the back end. Straight to the chest and it got me sprung. My lungs started collapsing - shit nigga what's happenin?. The sess got me trippin off the drums and guns, ready for action. Duck a swang or either other thang. Try to be tough and bang and scuff and hang. Suffer pain left deranged then youse a bogus m'uhfucker mayn. Since the beat struck a vein, I'm too strange. for m'uhfuckers to compete with. I'm on some infrared heat shit. with a deep clique, what I eat sleep shit. Well if it's a freak bitch, she can suck a sweet dick. til she's seasick; blockin niggas out like an eclipse. When smokin them devils put your hands together. like you know the host. Cause ain't no nigga that can resist the words from the Twist'. Leavin niggas comatose from my overdose. Chorus: Twista. I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it. We overdosin on weed and sendin all y'all off into a thang. Kill off all enemies while makin G's, catch you off on your knees. and snatchin fees now that I'm up in this game. I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it. We overdosin on weed and sendin all y'all off into a thang. Kill off all enemies while makin G's, catch you off on your knees. Niggas rollin me b's just so they can hang. [Twista]. Can you figure out the cause and effect?. Niggas comin on your set. Thugs comin out they drawers with a tec. Victim bleedin from the neck. Shirts is getting wet, shorties yellin threats. Lookin for the one who called for the deck. Now they airin out the hall in the spot. Hitting stomachs leavin niggas pinched up. Bodies balled in a knot. Bullet holes in the wall from a glock. Searchin for the one who called in the shots. Hypes crawlin for rocks. Goin all in the socks of the recently deceased. from what was released. From the chrome beast to the dome piece. Visions in my mind bein increased by inner beef. and some grief, but when I chief on some strong leaf. I'm snappin hard enough to make a nigga try to check his own chief. Violate him but can't annihilate him. Pickin up his own teeth and it's on with the microphone deep. Stimulate him with pistols penetrate him. Nerves still droppin cause adrenaline pumpin is a m'uhfucker. Hit him with the steel bloodsuckers. Murdered the bud, and I was makin sure. every one of you hoe studs suck us. And I bullshit you not if it was full clips, two glocks. you would still die or you'll get too hot. Cause when my fuel kick you'll drop. Hypes is trickin on you. Tell me where he at bitch and you'll get two rocks. (Okay!) Cause when my tool click you'll pop. Can't have this hype nigga stop shit, I'm hazardous. Makin musical miracles like I'm Jesus of Nazerath. Yet disasterous, smokin on half and hash, fuck if it's cancerous. Bust ass (??) cause I mastered this. It's hard to breathe, I'm bustin like an A-bomb. cause I'm in the zone, twenty-two a cold shit up my sleeve. It's hard to stay calm. Thinkin about the bitches that I've been up on. Hittin my enemies and competition up with lethal rolls. that's damagin, flows that's callous and we're leavin. thick ladies frantic and people in the industry panickin. I thought we got in this to get out of pistol handlin. Now it's possible m'uhfuckers could start vanishin. Fuck the Anacin I be toking plenty of stanky for stress. and flowin over notes; them studs thinkin they can get close. I know I got you trippin off the shit. a nigga said off a overdose. Chorus. [Twista]. C'mon and toke on a dub with me; I love cities with parties. that's full of bitches where they let me rub titties. Be able to pack a snub with me; in case we get in some static. and gotta start leakin blood from stud skinnies. So don't ask if it's the bud in me; because for some reason. I smoke on some weed and get too wicked and raw. It can't be nickel or somethin, way it's chokin me. potency'll have me rockin mics. and givin your bitch dick in the jaw, I'm hookin the law. You're lookin in awe, took what you saw. Got the B's pen and pad out the bottom drawer. Then got to bitin and formulatin some shit you called your own. but take it to the rehab cause you got a flaw. To put it simple you ain't cold enough. Trippin out like you can't control the stuff. Lackin rhythm like you known to bust. In a different zone from us. You niggas need to sit the fuck down. get a swisher and roll this up. If you think I'm speakin too bold, whassup?. I ain't even on no hoe shit; plus the mob is so thick. I'm the type of nigga you should wanna get up close to. and take a smoke with. If there's static then check yo' clique; my mind is so sick. I be tweakin with speakin releasin energy to show I know the ropes. Cause when it comes to this rap shit. niggas will choke til I'm ghost. while I breath reefer smoke from my overdose. Try to put me to the test, gimme some budda bless. I'll show you who the best. Release the vocal trilogy... Traxter Aight T god damn slow it up mayn! M'uhfuckers done felt you mayn!. We can go on to some next shit. Twista God damn man you stoppin motherfuckers and shit. Man I'm tryin to get my zone on. Let niggas hear what the fuck I'm doin man. Traxter I mean you done zoned man. Let's go to the next cut baby. Twista Man, fuck that shit."

piece of mind,"Twista feat. Darkside Ballaz. . [chorus]. I thank God that I found my piece of mind one more time. Since I'm dyin' I'd rather go right now than to be waitin' in line. [REPEAT]. [verse 1]. play with mine you'll find that it's the wrong damn move. I was the wrong damn dude. Gino told me do the usual leave him in critical. my brother Bruce told me that he didn't pay dues. you snooze and lose. so what I'd do is make this man take a bath in his shoes. and it was all on the news. see I knew that it would be that me or him gonna bleed. and it wasn't gonna be me. so what I did was popped one up in my chamber and I sent 3. no women no kids. and I'ma shine on this nigga like Mop 'N Glo. you think he stopped and load. he jumped down with the rocks and a bomb on a dope. but he didn't have to be so bold. he rushed the Mob like a blob with the glocks and more. and even called the cops on Sko. he be shitty chi with the diamond in the watch in the coat. the medallion to match with the rope. no cars and the trucks in the cars that he ride. lookin' like a star when he glide. I swear to God when he hear the bullet fall through the sky. he be jackin' like a rabbit tryin' to hide. kinda hard to catch a nigga who be gone in the wind. purple Navigator and a Benz. a new ??, the old niggaz that he used to fuck with. took a fall for strength of a man. [verse 2]. (Sko get it) before I step outside and do my job for Allah. pray to Allah, undo Allah. anythang go wrong I pray to Allah. anythang go right I give my praise to Allah. anythang in sight I'ma bless for Allah. everythang tonight I'ma test for Allah. everythang you write I'ma erase yo bar. if you ridin' tonight you better hop out yo car. cause the moon tonight is traced in 5-star. I feel for ? my sisters at the bar. y'all be aight just keep yo self to yo self. y'all can see aight out on the streets it's double dare. over there it's the end of the road East 99 find my kind. still blind to the times and the signs. on the streets niggaz killin' elites. killin' ??. killin' the chief. 5 stars in the governor. everybody gettin' covered up. wrapped up in some bloody sheets. I came off the deep saw throw my heart. niggaz slangin' a V with the L's on his way all the time. since I'm dyin' then I'd rather go right now. than to be waitin' in line. [chorus]. [verse 3]. I cant seem to get away from all the things in the world that bring me down. and I cant seem to get away from all the pressures. and the pain that I find myself around. but I need a little more time for me to survive. all the dirty things that I did in my life. I can walk by I can try to crawl by I can run. but I cannot hide from my piece of mind. I hit him clean in the middle of his dentures. he was getting carried away because I let him slide. a couple times he went off on an adventure. bloody murderer only to die it the Darkside. and god I like to for killin over some Benjamins. but it wasn't about my money it was bout his pride. he had to run to the van he was defending it. in a line of duty he died for a piece of mind. I never knew I would have to murder the motherfucker. I was the one fighting and piecing and increasing the peace. I could (?) hit me and my brother. we was the reason for a record that cd release. we B.I.B. to the avenue about the trigger time. you can't be alive in the hood when we dirt ride. and motherfuckers got down cause never could. never survive with the goods that god provide. so as I bogus wack him for doing my job. eliminate niggas that hate cause they ruining the mob. I choose got bruise when I toss that guy out in the squad. while they flossing the cars we busting and turn into god. [chorus]"

pray for me,"Twista feat. Todd Nitty. . [Todd Nitty]. Here's the tale of a young black male. raised in these city streets. out here hustling to make ends meet. In a world thats so corrupt. thats ran by greed. money and the power. for me I'm a survivor. I do what I have to and only God can judge me for that. So before you cash your stones down on me. I want you to take a look at yourself in the mirror. And ask somebody to pray for you. Cause that's all I'm asking is to pray for me, understand. I was born around gangstas, hustlers, and killers. Drug dealers with math figures making hella scrilla. In the city of Chi the home of the G's. If ya dont work ya dont eat that's been the code of the streets. As for me I was brought up at an early age. learned how to cook cane started to gang bang. and its a damn shame I chose game. but see I'ma knuckle headed nigga with no one to blame. and I'ma gonna keep on tipping under the street lights. and be wondering which nigga wanna take my life. until then I'm staying two feet in front of you haters.

ratatattat,"[VERSE 1]. Sucker wack vicks, I ratatattat tactics, givin em black kicks. Mufflin up the mic with funky black licks. Tricks, I be rippin em like hocus pocus, focus on the funk, gee. Tung be runnin away like a punk be. Rockin, droppin the funk of the manifestation that'll be dope. Scope the point of being wack? Nope, never & no-no. A dancer like a go-go? Oh no. My lip be sort of kickin sort of funky like a hobo. Sucker, I'm like a hype hip-hop gangster gettin dumb. Instead of shooting guns I shoot the tongue. Style Pacino, I'm gunnin em up controllin your casino. Funky like a wino, rhino-dyno like dino. Comin around the corner cappin sucker ducks who be tryin to wreck mine. But my lyrical tongue is like a Tec-9, wastin em. Look at me spillin juice, loose to chasin em. Cut them like tomatoes, then be tomat-pastin em. Facin em, gun to tongue, let's see who'll win this gang member. I'm droppin em like a leaf in September to November. Froze in December, rock over October, so remember. When I shoot the Tec-9 tongue - timber. Ratatattat. [CHORUS]. Ratatattat. What's the sound of a gat. Ratatattat. What's the sound of a gat. Ratatattat. What's the sound of a gat. Ratatattat. Show em how the Tung smacks. Ratatattat. Show em how the Tung smacks. Ratatattat. Show em how the Tung smacks. Ratatattat. Show em how the Tung smacks. Ratatattat. [VERSE 2]. Prr-prrrr.. buck em down. Sucker ducks, comin to pluck em down. Hope the hip hype hip-hop horn struck em down. Climbin, I'm never rhymin Simple like Simon but I'ma do what Simon said. He told me to put that head to bed. Givin an eyeful, funky rhythm of a tongue will stifle. Trifle cause I pop the tongue like a rifle. Watch the funky words pounce. From my mouth watch 40 bounce. Cappin a sucker duck like a 40 ounce. Some flows are wack, but as for me I cause a catastrophe. Like callin Allah God steppin to me is blasphemy. I shoot the tongue like a machine gun. Know what I mean, son?. A chunky spunky tongue if you ever seen one. Cops, I give em props, they cap men, mostly black men. Mouth will pack, then smack em like a Mack-10. Bop - another head flown like a frisbee, it is me. The clips from my lips could drop a Grizzly. Hear me vick, I pack a kick for the ballistic, animalistic. You didn't know my tongue was this quick. Cops that be cappin thinkin that be spunky. Watch I hit them with the lyric and then I'm cut em up with a funky. Ratatattat. [CHORUS]. [VERSE 3]. Poppin and poppin and poppin the flow of the hip hype hop rhythm. I bust caps like I've been hittin false teeth with raps. Rip your show apart, I know you got no heart to start, I flow art. I got the style that even Humphrey couldn't Bogart. Syllable serum, suckers hear come a style to smack a man. And it be sort of like a smack of Jackie Chan. I pop the funky gun of hip hop, I hop with hips. Droppin battle ships I put the automatic clips up into my lips. Funky like a drunk, I buck em like a hunter. My rifle will make em stifle like Edith Bunker. Suckers I tag em, my rhythm'll rag em, drag em. They felt the funky flow of the formula .44 Magnum. Minimum against the maximum, cracks a maximus. Charge tax and dust, thinkin about waxin us. DJ Jihad will slice em like lard. Check out the funky cut, rocks god be gunnin em up like buckshots. Cappin a brother if he come in a centimeter. Comin to drop the style of Tung and then I bet I'm gonna beat ya. Shootin like mi Uzi, I re-arrange a fella feature. Filimeter, mi funky rhythm is like a 9 millimeter. Ratatattat. [CHORUS]"
razzamatazz / jazzamatazz,"[VERSE 1]. Oh - back again makin the rhythm kick jazz. Used to be wick-wack, now I got funky pizzazz. Idryss'll do my fade-up cause he cuts em like class. And the chicks want me to lick cause I'm too quick, I think I'll pass. Dollars, if I don't fold em, I roll em like a bolo. Other steppin to brothers cause he be God? Oh no. G-o-d, I be not he, it's true, don't call me loco. And my man Eric the Wiz will stir the mini mix up like Coco. Cut like Michael Myers, start up fires, I'm a scar hard. Thinkin I be wimpy, I just simply rip em far apart. Ansaars in New York, I know that you know that you are God. This brother's from Chicago, so I guess I'm a Chigagod. Rhythm is my producer of rhythms on the wax. The posse Lower Level be kickin some funky tracks. Never ask, I ax, I get madder than Max. Diggem smacks, if they try to tax I play em like a sax. [CHORUS]. Rock - me call it what?. (Razzamatazz). Rock - me call it what?. (Jazzamatazz). [VERSE 2]. Styles, I hand em, I brand em like cattlecakes. Better get flows from your bros if a battle takes. I hear a hiss, the tale of a taddle shakes. Backs this breaks givin aches to the rattlesnakes. I get spunky with funky stylin. Rhythms I flow, I kick them wild and. Tryin to get with the styles I'm pilin. For your sob story I better get the violin. Come again - watch a fun one construct. I don't like sissy chickens and I hate a sucker duck. Some label me a sucker because ducks I like t pluck. The only way I be a sucker is if women wanna suck. Always goin broke so I don't dig into my stash. I'm cool as Brian Robbins on the show _Head of the Class_. If you don't get the picture, make the camera go flash. When this rhythm was a baby, doc spanked him on his - jaz. [CHORUS]. [VERSE 3]. Study my culture, soar like a vulture. My teacher Marvin Howard will create my sculpture. I'm kickin Islam, some brothers try to bomb. Facts can harm but I still say Salaam. Sometimes I blush, bust and leave puss. Hush if I must, plus I don't forget to flush. With suckers I fuss, thought I was soft like a slush. Chicagods crush cause they think toys r us. Hip (hip what) hop. This funky hip (hip what) hop. Is funky hip (hip what) hop. This funky hip (hip what) hop. 'll make a drip (drip what) drop. I like to rip (rip what) shop. I always slip (slip what) cops. Reachin the tip (tip what) top. Come in again. Buck-buck, my rhythm be knockin at the do'. Mi stamina rock, mi stamina rock, bloodclot, I do not know. Why they judge me by one rap and say too fast I flow. Even though I kinda thought I said it slow - oh. [CHORUS]"

Cause I'ma step into em like a bathtub. I make em run like waterfalls, use your eyes for pool balls. Then run through rappers like school halls. I'm breakin sucker punks' backs. Facts on wax, when I step, instead of footprints, I leave tire tracks. My rhythm be delicious while. I flow, the skunk of this, funk of this with a dramatically vicious style. I destroy your phoney hip-hopness like the Lochness. Monster, just because I want ta. 1 to 2, I'm comin through. Swig em like a brew, ooh. You think I bit off more than I can chew?.

The relationship's about to be ruined for what you persuin. Steadily tryna see who I'm screwin like I'm fuckin the nation. It's nothin but hatin that the homies be doin. Spittin rumors all up in your ear, tension in the atmosphere. Baby what's the mission here, listen here. You lookin for numbers and fist in hair.

And this is for tha love and the ladies. The fine women that be rollin Mercedes. Getting freaky and. And we be going (weo weo weo weo). [R Kelly:]. Do you want me to slow it down (Kelz).

still feels so good,"[Intro: Girl]. This goes out to all sides worldwide. Let that playa ass nigga Twista be yo guide, as we go on a ride. Hood to hood, chrome, leather, and wood. And it feels so good... [Twista]. One mornin' I... Woke up next to a peanut butter and a caramel chick. Feelin fucked up, flicked out, freaked on. Thinkin' about my new truck with tha' deep dish. Meanin' deep chrome, deep chrome, in the deep dome. After a massage and a ménage, we got in the shower. Let water trickle down the crack of the back of they booty. Got out the tub and went back to the master bedroom. One put on prada, one put on Ludi, I put on gucci. Duty calls, I'm bout to hit the scene and ball. But before I leave I spray on some Issey Miyake. Take my truck up to the wash, put the sparkle back on. Wax on, wax off like Mr. Miyagi. Go to the liquor store so I can get blunts, get Yak. So I can sip some while I split one. Chronicle enter ever pholical of my body. Calmin' down every molecule, makin' sure I don't trip none. Hit one... Hop in tha' ride, come and kick it wit me. So I can take you through tha' so-and-so hundred block. And show you how my people be kickin' it in the windy city. I wanna show you where I hang out at, where we make our scratch. While we sit on leather grippin' wood. Where tha' hustla's got packs and the G's got stacks. And tha' pimps got lacks, rollin' through the hood. And it feels so good... [Chorus: Jazze Pha]. And it feels so good. Turnin' corners with my pinky man. Through my hood. Chokin' on a B and switchin' lanes is understood (understood...). I'm a baller livin' pimpish. Man, leather and wood. Said it feels so good (feels so good...). [Twista]. Now I done seen plenty niggaz flip twenty's, flip twenty one's. Flip twenty two's, flip Jordans, flip two-fours. Mega ballin', new clothes. Momma got a new store, tv screens, hundred-forty spokes. And we fittina' roll, right off madison to the manor in a drop-top Lexus. Sippin' henny rollin' reckless. Feelin' so motherfuckin' good I could roll my vehicle to Texas. And spit it like, this is for the syrup sipper's... Gotta slow it down so you feel it, plus it make the words figure. And spit some screwed shit and do shit so that you understand. When it come to spittin' rapid-fire lyric adrenaline then I be the motherfuckin' man... Get the love, when I hit the club gotta freak in. It's the weekend and the DJ bumpin' ""Tattoo"". Track move like some southern, black blues, or like the Cooper, got cruise. And they got shoes it's packet-proof instead I be the hottest rap... Dude...Ride to this while you peel, yo, hood. You could go around the block or travel the whole world. When you come back it's still yo hood. And it feels so good... [Chorus]. [Twista]. I spit some game wit the intellect. To the media, like I'm in the Encyclopedia Brittanica. Come and take over the world wit' me girl. If you good I might can see if I can be yo manager. Get yo career on track and yo life on point. And I'll show you how yo taxes go... Tactics flow quicker than a hat-trick go, smokin on some fire, galactic dro. I know it's good when you smoke that fire. Puff that herb, get that dirt, hit that lick. Cop yourself a motherfuckin' Bentley car. Cop yourself a motherfuckin' Bentley crib. Pop that ass, throw that dick, twork that thing, bust that nut. Drop that top, turn the base up, put you a chameleon paint on the truck. Get iced up, bumpin' Twista grooves. as I cruise new shoes rollin' smooth up in K-Town. In my city come and feel it ghetto blues. if you snooze you lose don't pay dues for the tre-pound. Take the time to kick wit' yo home girls... And feel yo nugz... Keep on hatin' on the L, big family we gon' steady come up. And I'ma still smoke good, and it feels so good... [Chorus] - repeat 2X. [Outro]. Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some... Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some... Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some... Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some.."
stories,"Twista feat. Fiend, Lifty Stokes, and Oobie. . Yo Fiend, what up man? (Yo, yo). You rollin' with these Legit Ballaz right? (Whomp). Aight, well check it out. Won't you tell these muthafuckaz a lil' bit about where you come from. [Fiend]. Fire arms, sounds of alarms. Consistency in bodily harm. Where I'm from that's the norm. Fiend the ?. Lil' nigga ain't no man of creaton. Once we encounter the killin' spree we on. My defects have G's bet on. Niggaz dollars get they rep on. Speakin' with heat ? could bring death on. Nigga I'm called the killa. Cause every time he get it, it brought chills. Lead that's what made 'em take his ass for real. I done ? survivor. He never wrote the name of his drivers. And wondered that the man can deprive ya. It's there in black ink. With millions in dirty green had to think. Lives depreciated over drinks. Call me twisted. Rope burns to the neck was insisted. And all his hope turned to ""I guess should I risk it?"". [Fiend talkin]. And that's why the law is laid down. You know what I'm sayin'?. From Fiend to N.O. to Chi, Twista. Pimp run it now. [Hook - Fiend (Oobie)]. Now to my hustlaz slangin' cain. I said some survive the game. Some just get they names in the stories to be told. Why the young never make it old. Now to my hustlaz slangin' cain. I said some survive the game. Some just get they names in the stories to be told. Why the young never make it old (Why the young never make it old). [Liffy Stokes]. I live my life drownin' in homicide. Never let the drama slide. We killaz quick to let it ride. Send a nigga beddy-by when I let it fly. Niggaz be yappin' but they scared to die. Talkin' plenty shit till I cap off with the .45. Look into these smoke red eyes, feel me starvin'. Feel me shakin' up that dope in my apartment. And picture me on top of the world and still servin'. Blessin' all my shorties with birds to keep 'em workin'. As long as my hood is tight, my mind is right. Look at the dope line tonight, just doin' aight. For the nugs. Y'all got paper, I got paper so let's find some ass to jug. This struggle for power keeps us all up to no good. With constant heat, we cruise the streets like cops on D's. With the itchy sittin' dead on the seat. For the wicked and weak, tryin' to get down on what we put down. For this grid-ound, that's why we stand firm with these rid-ounds. [Hook]. [Twista]. Never thought that the cries of my people would get louder. When Chief first came home with that glistenin' white powder. But it gave us power. Never thought them ? packs that had us buyin' clothes and pullin' hoes. Would have our new Starter jackets filled with bullet holes. (That's how it goes). And who would have ever thought that when we would rock this shit. That we would end up gettin' our whole block lit. By-standers got hit up. And who would have ever thought that women would be up on silent nights. Lightin' pilot lights. I would be crept on my a mask on silent nights. Now I'm wonderin' and thinkin', how can a man make a sack ??. Flip a new Lac with his work. End up in the back of hearse. Then be packed in the dirt. ? over turf, can you hear the Mack when it burst. He get cracked where it hurts. Feel the automatic when it jerks. Comin' up in the land where the white and blue Dracula's lurk. Is that what it's worth naw, niggaz got the chrome in ? in the whip. Never let the law get the low on the licks. Bet they got a mob and they mob full of tricks. You ain't on yo P's, you gotta be. Fuck a ? strategy, don't be punked like no lame. You just a Bone in the game. Steady baggin' work, hittin' licks, and stackin' cain'. [Hook]"

Get paid whether you legit when you slang, or tippin' off 'cane,. Until I take a dip in the Range, I'm flippin' them thangs,. Gotta get that money man. [Chorus (Anthony Hamilton)]. It's a lovely day, just got paid,. Stack it up, be on my way,. It’s Lovely day, lovely day,. Lovely day, lovely day,. It's a lovely day, just got paid,. Stack it up, be on my way,. Lovely day, lovely day,. Lovely day. [Verse 2 (Twista)]. A hustler's definition, is a hustler for scratch,. You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that,. I'm makin' money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks,. And if I ain't sellin' no records, I'm servin' them packs,. I got a, clip full of hollows, money makin's my motto,. Semi-auto and Marlboros in the bottle, 'til I hit the lotto,. Wit' dreams of ownin' a records label, flippin' words,. My nigga flippin' buildin's better than he was flippin' birds,. I got tha, mentality and tha motive I'm on a mission,. For tha money, you can get it too, it's all about yo ambition,. Play yo position, provide the plans, and follow procedures,. In tha six-hundred, blunted, wit' a pocket full of hundred's and Visa's,. Love, when I get that dust, hit 'em up, re-cock then I get back up,. Love, when I get that gig, get a crib, get a car when tha grip stack up,. It's still in the evenin' if I'm sleepin' paper problems,. Soon as I get up it's just another day, another dollar. Gotta get that money man. [Chorus (Anthony Hamilton)]. It's a lovely day, just got paid,. Stack it up, be on my way,. Lovely day, lovely day,. Lovely day, lovely day,. It's a lovely day, just got paid,. Stack it up, be on my way,. Lovely day, lovely day,. Lovely day. [Verse 3 (Twista)]. Got love for the corporate playas that's ballin' rollin' jags,. Got love for the thug nigga's who get' it on tha ave.,. Love for those, who can make a mil and sit back and laugh,. And love for the fine stripper's who get it poppin' ass,. Love for the single parent's that's workin' through the struggle,. Love for those who gotta make a livin' movin' muscle,. Love for those who gotta watch tha hater's rollin' bubbles,. Causin' trouble every time a young brotha try to hustle,. And if I can't, legally make or not. Then I gotta get, right back on the block. And if it no work we do a stick-up and whip-up a concoction,. Might leave yo face down in the dirt because hurtin's not an option. Gotta get that money man. [Chorus (Anthony Hamilton) x2]. It's a lovely day, just got paid,. Stack it up, be on my way,. Lovely day, lovely day,. Lovely day, lovely day,. It's a lovely day, just got paid,. Stack it up, be on my way,. Lovely day, lovely day,. Lovely day. [Outro (Anthony Hamilton)]. When I wake up in the mornin' love,. And the sunlight hurts my eyes,. Somethin' without warnin' love,. Bears heavy on my mind"
the day after,"""The Day After"". (feat. Syleena Johnson). [explosion, people screaming, glass shatters]. The day after... the day after.... ""Are we on the air? Yes, we are live at the scene. of this tragic accident, where a car has ran into a building.. The person in the car was positively identified as rap star Twista.. Apparently, he went _Kamikaze_.

You're gonna make it - you've gotta fiiiight. [Twista + (S.J.)]. Now it was a war it was like I was in Vietnam. But I kill 'em all, cause _Kamikaze_ was the bomb. Got a strap to my back and I ran in if I was a terrorist. Got 'em all scanned at this President's head everybody be calm. Die for my belief, but got out the rubbish because it. this cup of death, Death was not yet meant for me to drink from it. Thinkin how could I ever survive, I knew I was ready to ride. I even had C4 duct taped to my stomach but uhh. (You got a right to survive). But you gotta have will and always be ready to come off the wall. They gon' be willin to test you and catch you if you talk the talk. But I'ma keep on with the struggle fuck leavin my body in chalk. (You're gonna make it). Look at me now cause I'm standin on top of the globe (say what). Makin big money for spittin my popular flow (say what). Now look at the swagger of a platinum veteran servin 'em medicine. It's not a given to work cause I'm choppin them O's. Can't fuck with the swagger the haters just look at me nigh. I'm stickin them daggers in haters just look at them cry. The shit don't affact us effect us they wanna imagine. they take us lay 'em on the back, I'm makin 'em look at the sky. If I think they cool, I give 'em a dutch. If they break the rules, I give 'em a crutch. If they on the come up and I feel 'em I give 'em some dust. If they talkin shit I'ma bust at 'em and get 'em to hush. Get away clean, go high on the meter, I got the streetsweeper. A creeper believe I get deep as the word of a preacher (and I). Lyrical retriever but good with them heaters. When I'm full of passion and fury like when you listen to Syleena (and I). Went multi-platinum when I stepped on enemy grounds. Now bodies all over the world is fin' to be found. And _Kamikaze_ was successful now c'mon and feel _The Day After_. Twista done blew up and tore the whole industry down. [Syleena Johnson]. You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it. You got a right to survive, ohhh, you're gonna make it. You're gonna make it - you've gotta fiiiight. Ohhhhh yeah yeah yeah, yeahhhhh. You're gonna make it, if you believe it, you can get it.

unsolved mystery,"[Twista]. I know a whole bunch of motherfuckers thats prepared whoop. Leave a body bloody red to scoop. Poppin off lead for loot. Shot the pussy up from head to boot. Just for talkin dramatic when it was static you was scared to shoot. Police prepared to swoop. To catch a nigga on the runway but don't none stay for the white chalk. If aired out your tip whatch your lip niggas pipes talk. I you wasn't seen then you might walk. Even if it ain't the time of day niggas will find a way like locos off of nodos. Cappin when you servin your blows niggas doze hoes. Got the popos posin as hobos. Take a photo of him please. Tell the Chi Town he freeze they don't give a fuck if it was DT's. They be up like the sea breeze on CC's. And they handin out these murders like free cheese. Could you pass me the B please. I got intercate shit to kick even though I campaign with a gang. Bumpin though in different denominations in the nations,. and the nations racin worried bacause I'm slangin the thangs. If you can ahng up at my town up a K Town. if you dissin them then you dissin me. Niggas actin like they glad to die so if you had to try,. if they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me. just a unsolved mystery. [Chorus 2x]. Before I saw his body lyin down. I heard a motherfucker crying now. Have you ever seen a bitch nigga give into mysery. And left an unsolved mystery. Before I saw his body lyin down. I heard a motherfucker crying now. Call the popo the man and mess. Shot up his head and chess. Put to rest now the rest should be history. Before I saw his body lyin down. I heard a motherfucker crying now. Have you ever seen a bitch nigga give into mysery. And left an unsolved mystery. Before I saw his body lyin down. I heard a motherfucker crying now. Niggas actin like they glad to die. So if you had to try. If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me. [2nd vesre]. In a hoopty shorty's will design a spot. So when the get pulled over them people wouldn't find the spot. But if you ain't got it hid you have the flowest. if you can throw it and motherfucker its a nine to knot. Just go back to where your thang lay. Cause lo key niggas they started out in the gang way. But if you wild when your aim spray. Them niggas that you aired out is gonna be comin back the same day. In the middle of a war you ain't on the tip. if you get the guns and clips to keep doin what you doin. Is it the same chiefs that got the same beef. claimin they ain't been doin the bruh be givin it to 'em. Flamboyant niggas must be slow. If your bitch ain't get popped then its a blessin she a lucky hoe. Cause no matter where the fuck he go. In K Town they will dress him in a casket and tuxedo. Cause you can't be actin thug roof. Because of Hennesey and drug use these niggas love juice. Some don't even considered gettin caught. cause when you talk up some shit the gonna be quick and let the slugs loose. These motherfuckers heart is love boo. Especially like them niggas up at Ghostown Windy City snipe. Cause its a pitty when hype. For niggas wanna get witty. For comin too pretty. Get the chilli filled and desipher. To pay the piper and bow to viper. Twice is rough. Now is what I'm kickin hype enough. Cause everytime I puff and write this stuff. I kick a frenzy facin fuckin and fury cause I dont like to bluff. So if we ever get into it and let the static get to me. Lets squash it and make it history. Niggas actin like the glad to die. So if you had to try. If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me. Just an unsolved mystery. [Chorus]. [3rd verse]. Now listen they be kickin hocus pocus. I done said shit to put your motherfucking eyes out of focus. So writing what I wrote is hopeless. If you see our base and you said then you better be ferosheous. And matter fact I hope the dopest. For to try to cope this is hopeless. Cause my lethal rhymes. Is the kind that can beat you blind. And pre-design. I pee through mine. Like I see through lines. Check the brain and see define. The reason I'm gunnin I tried the runnin. Cause I should have let you know. I don't give a fuck you was fronted because you was blunted. West side to the hunters you can't step to hoe. In the state of emergency urgenlty the ambulance will come. And then the law will come demand the gun. But bullshit irrelevence they need evidence. or trippin on elegance they be holdin out they hands for some. If anything they'll hand 'em some. Or get wit him here come the victum he be shot up in his pants and lungs. Cause he actin hard and ran his tongue. Don't mean another nigga he meet in the street gonna be the man to run. Cause a prison is some shit to see. Matter of fact fuck the talkin my lip let me hit the B. Niggas actin like they glad to die. So if you had to try. If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me. Just an unsolved mystery. [Chorus 2x]"

'Cuz like a lamb I was sacrificed for this verbal murder religion. Imprisioned by my hunger to succeed. By the heart I be driven. No shakin, no shiverin, get your shit to bleed. Reciting street literature, shall i spit tha creed. Now who them mothafuckaz talkin 'bout bitin. Go get me the pump-out of my trunk-I'm finna buss. Y'all better run punk. Fuck where you got your style from I be the one. Rippin the track and I'm murderin. I'm in the middle of killin 'em off when the guns dump. With a young pump two to the brain don't even harm me. You fuckin every party, you wont even startle. You' the harder crew of lyrical giants. Turnin mothafuckaz like u to microscopic particles. To hype, to stop it the modules on cruise control. Ride out on these niggas-bitches-ho's. Ain't takin no titles I instantly bruise your soul. Talkin that shit to me- trigger vicious flows. Get to rippin my clothes and start snappin like I'm. Sniffin shit up the nose, and catchin convulsions. Till i'm trembling no surrendering start shootin and. Knockin mothafuckaz out like Benalyn. Reminiscin' on that adrenaline. Oh, now you rememberin. Overdose 'em on poisonous poetry from the west to the wild y'all. Gangbagin like Gotti, rockin tha party. Straight up shockin your body doin it Kami Kaze style y'all. Hook 1:. Cause it's Victory or Death nigga, better stay out the way. When my adrenaline pumpin or you can get a..(click-clock-blast). Die mothafucka die!. Ain't no makin me bleed cause i've got family to feed. It's (repeat). Hook 2:. I would rather die before i cant prosper I'm a mobsta. Won't stop ballin, because it's meant to be,. It's Victory or Death I gotta hustle till i'm gone. (repeat). To all the folks and the lords.. The bloods and the crips and every ward lets roll. You gotta go- for what you know. If it's retaliation get low. When you get to the calico let it flow. Make these niggaz know in the door. Make a mothafucka bleed for what you need. Cuz the familys gotta eat in the last days it's hatred and greed. Luv to the Gov's, B.M.'s, Field marshals, elites and the chief. Soldiers we better take heed and realize. Signs of the times, stand by yo 9,. Watch out for tha haters and write yo' rhymes. But the industry is set up to fuck u so u better be on the grind. Don't be one of the blind gotta stay alert. And put in work cuz time is almost up. Twistas, Hurricanes, and Volcanoes erupt. So we can't stop the struggle,. I'm killin my enemy, breakin 'em off and not givin a fuck.. And I pray to the Lord my soul to keep. When i go to the sky. Thank you from savin me form a torturous life of hell,. But hile I'm here I'm straight legit ballin until I die. Lets better these years, feel the blood sweat and the tears. Organize, I'll sit back and smoke a Philly witcha. Never scared of my peers, I only got federal fears. And I'm known to put it down for my city nigga. And when we get full of this indo. Hydroponics and Chronic lock up ya doors and tha window. Better go and call up your kinfolks. Cause the riders that's down with this mob. Will murder when the wind blow. Don't know what you info. We bring terror in this Apocalyptic era of Armageddon we headin in. And the only way we can survive is if we come hard. And strive to be gods instead of men!. hooks 1&2."
wanna see 'em buss,"The cars are so sick.. mine to make you vomit.. maroon forc field goupin lining on the stomache.. 6 inches on the lift the whole coppy squad,. no story short, i customized every body part..

warm embrace,"It's like I got the 4-4 cocked. On the block in it two door dropped. And my spot is keepin but hot. The pussy-ass cop throw some murder in the lot. My nigga got popped with a bullet that was meant for me. The adapt by T's and B's and the regencies. Fuck what the reason be, I'ma start squeezin these. Them niggas ain't G's, they wanna be thugs. And it ain't shit, these ain't no motherfuckin slugs. The fools and plugged plus ain't no hoes over here. I done dropped more dead bodies than tears. Brought to life momma's worst fears. Pictures of a son dyin from that hot ones flyin. Baby mama's cryin at the funeral. Cause the magnum lit him like a Black & Mild. When I rolled out on his ass on the solo. I caught him up on mo-mo cookin up co-co. I got to tip on the low-low. Bust it there like po-po takin lives with the, oh no. It's a 4-4, mini-missle with a silencer for the whistle. My favorite pistol, cause when I let that bitch ride. I know the homicide is being carried out in official. Niggas steady bumpin guns, but don't want none. Because of these hot ones that explode on contact. A manic that's prepared to die in combat. Besides all that a 4-4 keeps me laced, don't be petty to say. I can see the fear in your face. as I reach my waist for this warm embrace. [Chorus]. I got plenty love for the 4-4. But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it go. Because a nigga straight lovin' your warm embrace. I got plenty love for the 4-5. But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it ride. But still I bust 'cause I survive from your warm embrace. I got plenty love for the nine-mill. And when I pick it up, I don't really wanna kill. But still I bust because I'm needin' your warm embrace. All you muthafuckas better duck and hide. Before I let it ride, the sucka stepped aside. Still I bust because I'm lovin' your warm embrace. [Mayz]. I love the element of surprise when I'm taking these hoes lives. With my customized 4-5. Get enough ammunition to knock off you, your crew and some more guys. You muthafuckas better get wise. Make sure your first shot is sweet, tryin to kill the elite. Cause you ain't gettin no more tries. Hate to make a nubian mother weap, but fuck it. Long as I don't hear the hoe cry. Split a beam between his eyes and make that bitch nigga so wise. No matter what the size of the warm embrace of my forty-five. Make sure the nigga crossed through dies. You don't wanna throw them thangs. Cause when I cocked and aim it's time to think in a split second time. But Mayz ain't new to the game. I use the spark when the shots light up this thunderin crime. But niggas get bucked for dime and it's like you're a magnet for sin. Punk pretend to be your friend til they get close enough to your ends. To do you in, that shit puts me on ten. And make me wanna put the barrel of this solid fiend. Upon under that nigga's chin, plus he talkin big shit about war. Like he don't know my Speedknot Mob gon' win. But I dare one of you niggas to say my name. Cause I put a fuckin bullet into your closest kin. Just to get under your skin like a dirty syringe. Plus I know you can't win with a gun or a pin. So when you see Mayz come in the place you better say your grace. Before I fuck up your face like a can of mace. Before I get disgraced, I'ma catch a case. Maybe you hoes fear the wrath of my warm embrace. [Chorus]. [Twista]. With you my passion, nina squeeze off seventeen, for sure. Hold you ever so tightly, I love you nina and never wanna let you go. Miss Millimeter's makin a mockery of motherfuckers gotsta be ruckus. When I get my clutches upon this hoe. Itchin' to let the barrel blow. Like a sparrow, how it flow, like an arrow, geronimo. Spit 'em up and swallow slow. I reload, clippin' your ass crack, you constantly blast back. Payback from flashback, some bitches know. Bust 'til I see the chrome from the intro. You was fucked from the phasin', deep with the cuts and abrasion. Erupts and amazin', nigga, my nina bucked. Fuck the gazin and enemies get tore up from the blazin. Fool you be burnin' them with your black ass. Murderous hips, hurtin' the grips, ride on personal list. Deposition die for servin' them six. Everyone of 'em with a hit but some are missin' of a jerk to the kick. 'Cause I be working my bitch. Tryin' to pimp her but she a wild and a tame thang. Kick a static on when she gangbang, blast in the fullest moon. Niggas better pull it soon or else suffer hellafied bullet wounds. And even though I stay clubbed with some thugs, why call 'em stug. When it comes to her love, it's none above she drawin blood. Static under the bra 'cause everytime I take a hit at the bud. And give you a hug you gon' pop up a slug. Drinkin' remy on the block, gotta bust the glock. When the henny hit the chest, bustin' smith-n-wess. Fuck the discussion, I'm bustin' 'em all, clutchin' my balls. If I see y'all be laid to rest, let me hit the sess. Loose revolver used to be a problem solver. But the nina made me a baller. No strap could take the place of the black nine. Leave 'em flat lines, feelin' fury, you was born to taste. From my warm embrace. [Chorus]. I got plenty love for the 4-4, 4-4, 4-4. Warm embrace. I got plenty love for the 4-5 (4-5), 4-5 (4-5), 4-5. Warm embrace. I got plenty love for the nine-mill (Nine-mill), nine-mill"

U da one steady trippin wit da sassy mouth. But when get u into da apartment that’s when it get up and sparkin. And that’s when we let all da passion out. Like da way u walk in slow in da room. And smelling sweet as a rose. And looking good in da red thong. Looking thick as hell do it to me well. Got me sprung. And I know I got ya head gone. Either slow or faster girl. When I gone how u trippin is a disaster. When I step up to da tunes of da neptunes u wanna bring drama. And that’s when I gotta ask u girl why. [Chorus]. [2nd Verse - Twista:]. When u were sleep last night. After rubbin u down and making passionate love. I put on a pair of Air Force Ones, six figures of jewelry. And met my guyz at da club.

whitney houston tribute,"What? somebody told me whitney houston died. Can't believe to tell you how quickly tears went through my eyes. She was gettin' better, now it's really just blew aside. I still ain't got over don cornelius' suicide. So, where do I start it? dearly departed. One of heaven's angels for sure, who was really an artist. Lovin' the way that my mama would say she could sing. and the way it was magical. Ain't nobody like you, nobody before you and nobody after you. Could ever come near it, not here in the flesh. but you with us in spirit. So sad to hear it, I'm choking up while I come up with these lyrics. And though she blessed the earth. and it's time to let heaven prosper. I still wish somebody was there to protect her,. (who?) kevin costner (who?) clive davis, (who?) bobby brown. Her mama and her daughter, whitney is where god be now. Such a short time, don't want it to be this way. But if she was here, she would probably say:. ""if I should stay, I would only be in your way"". If you wanna say rest in peace to whitney houston. I had traxter leave 16 bars open on this song... So that you could do so with me. So get your verses ready, hop on the track with me. Pay a tribute to the late great whitney houston"
why,"Twista feat. High Beam. . [Twista]. The New Testament. These are the Street Scriptures for all my riders, niggaz, and hoes. Let me ask you a question:. Why give a bitch fame by sayin' his name?. When all I gotta say is you's a bitch. Yeah, I'm talkin' to you nigga. You ain't no killa, on the riz-illa. So High Beam my nigga, get with 'em. [High Beam]. AHHHHH!!. [Hook]. When I look that fool in his face and tell him he's a lie. Everybody want a cure but nobody wanna die. Put the cash in my face, I might take a try. Money motivated that nigga that threw up my sign. My wife's on my side with a .9 ready to ride. Hold my sixth sense up and ask buddy why. Shit get deep in the cold city of Chi. Could somebody, anybody tell me why-ay. Why-ya-y-yaah. Why-ya-y-yaah these boys they wanna try me-eeeee. Why-ya-y-yaah. Why-ya-y-yaah but these boys don't wanna die-eeeee. Why-ya-y-yaah. Why-ya-y-yaah now bring them boys to the Chi-eeeee. Why-ya-ya-yaah. Why-ya-ya-yaah Ahhhhhhhh. [High Beam]. I'll sacrifice my word and my balls for this here. Straight down to earth with my real niggaz crack 'em beers. Straight up that mean mug muthafucka havin' no fear. What the fuck. You thought I was one of them bitch niggaz standin' right here. Legit Ballaz is the clique I break bread with. Niggaz I bust lead with. In the midst of confrontation, high-speed chasin'. Bend 'em, and bust 'em and stick 'em, I'm runnin' from the FED's shit. This is the New Testament, uh-huh we never dead bitch - NO. [Hook]. [High Beam]. I'll make that damn fool get on his knees and say please. Bitches in the neighborhood spreadin' disease. Hatin' ass niggaz starin' and studyin' me. Cause I'm fresh up out the bank to get my daughter some cheese. But I got somethin' on my side like a lemon to squeeze. Lickin' bout a pack up at you muthafuckaz right at the knees. Probably givin' somethin' to fools cause the man in need. I been deep up in this game for a century. Now I'm makin' major moves and stackin' paper is my motto. Different day, different gear, hoppin' out a different auto. Put it on and I'll be jackin' off louchers like lotto. Showin' love to my niggaz who show me love in Chicago. It's fair but it's square, for the love of the game or they hate it. Many done died, plenty done tried from imitatin' it. Fuck what they say, keep faith in this world you'll make it. Thank him for everythang and every blessin' but don't fake it. [Hook]. [High Beam]. Trapped up in this wild life, thinkin' to myself. Askin' the Lord for forgiveness and thankin' him for my wealth. The block is on low when these slickers ain't plantin' drugs. Saturated with racial hatred result in a slug. That's why I stay high, gone off green. Fuckin' up muthafuckaz lyrically with the Beam. Got you and yo boys losin' yo breath like ??. Never disrespect a Legit Balla when on the scene. Ooh wee I rip shit like velcro. Get off in the studio. Fuck up the punk that step up got the umm next nigga screamin' ""Oh No"". Just when you thought that I was gon' fall I fuck around and ummm. Cock back explode, reload. Hit you with some shit that make you shake and shiver as I deliver. Shots from the 4-0. NO-NO!!. Got the next nigga screamin'"

Sometimes I take it slow, when I let the sex drop. But, most of the time I go qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-qu-quick. When I'm hittin' that shit, and she like it, she like it. But, tonight she said, she didn't want to go too fast. And tonight she said, she want me to take my time. So, I took her down and said 'Do you like that"" and, she said, ""Hell yeah"". Then hit medium from the back. I said it's cool and she said hell yeah. She said ooh baby, just take control baby. As long as u take it slow baby. Then u can hit all night baby. She gave me the green, so I have to go. Start screamin my name when I went low. And everytime I start goin fast. She look at me and said. [Hook: x2]. Yellow light [x4]. Gotta slow it down. [Twista:]. I told her that wanted to beat it up fast. So lil mama let me know when to go. Tonight, she don't want a drill session. She wanna feel it, so she told me to take it slow. I'm so use to mackin pokin to back to back. When I'm attackin it I wanna go get in. She blew the whistle like 'beep', be still. Hold it in now roll it in. She lift up her palms, to hold my face. Because she want me to control my pace. She said she wanna feel it all. Side thru the windows of the wall. Cause the feelin was too cold away. Well I can break it down to 50. Down to 40 down to 30. In the speed u want me to. I can do, for u. Shawty tell me how u want it. Do u want the lambo. I give it to like uh uh uh uh uh. When I do it baby. Or do u want the 64. I give it to u like uh uh.

She wanted in the middle. So gotta. [Hook: x2]. Yellow light [x4]. Gotta slow it down. [Twista:]. Now wid a subtle way to sooth yo soul. Gotta lovin the way I move the pole. Instead of rude and bold. I wanna see what it feel like. When playa break it down into cruise control. And still rule the role. Never stuckin on a one speed dick shift in a stick shift. I am not them dudes. Is not a jack rabbit, when I be tappin it. I wanna, slow it up and give it to her chopped and screwed. Come here shawty and lemme knock them shoes. Feel it sensual when I rock to the groove. Makin hot thang cool,. If u think u butter, show us how to stutter step stop then move. But I get not the order. Narry canary and my flow is like a shoppahorra. Scaryin barry whenever I rock with the r. Kelly in every position for power we slaughter. In petty like veli. I'm gettin money cause I oughta. I tell the girl to slow down lil mama.
