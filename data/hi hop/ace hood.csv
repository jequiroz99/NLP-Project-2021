2-12-12 (thoughts),"Rip Whitney Houston. God bless her soul. I'm just vibin' dog. But for you haters. Nothing's gonna stop me. I swear to god. Nothing's gonna stop me. Andi, Kiko, Renegades. Nothing's gonna stop me. Nothing's gonna stop me. Money talks so what's your conversation?. Counting my blesses, my sweet elaborated. Being broke ain't a joke, that feeling is devastating. Night met 'er so that force never stated. Calculating every dollar bill. Reminiscin', they missin' like someone not a mill. Still trippin', this life I'm livin' the dream still. Look at my niggas loyalty's mad real. That's cuz we got this from the bottom up. Number slidin' in my homie momma truck. We did what we had to do, we ain't give a fuck. Now we the niggas winnin' dog, wuddup?. Ain't it funny how the time fly?. Couple cars and a twenty story high rise. Took a minute but shit connecting like wi fi. It's fuck you to the niggas who sad my carrier died. Shit, I'm livin' quite well. On the beach I'm sippin' wine and cracking laughter tales. With a Spanish mommy give me, I pursue the tails. Ask me do I like it, poppy I'm like hell yea. We da best the fuckin' logo. Just hope you get the picture when you take your photos. Own a couple cars but I need one more though. Felt I'm coming soon, real nigga yellow. True, I'm just rappin' dog aye. Nothing's gonna stop me. I tell 'em: nothing's gonna stop me. Yea, feel good when you comin' from nothin' homie. But I tell 'er: nothing's gonna stop me. Swear to god (nothing's gonna stop me). Starvation. In the studio, watching the Grammy's homie. Pray today they nominate the one and only. Probly cry some tears at the ceremony. Only lord knows when they ready for me. Inspiration runnin' through my blood. Motivated from the fact I made through the mud. Kept my faith although they doubted when I lost my buzz. All over somethin' that I'm winnin' ain't gon show me love. In the street label me underrated. Story for respect my only ultimatum. They ask me who that's why you goin' hard. Cuz I just want my mama off that boulevard. I come from a city where there ain't many stars. And given no pity promised them prison bars. Teachers said I won't amount a shit. Graduated high-school, college never in it. Still I manage through seven figures with common sense. And at the age of 52 my mama finally quit. Fuck it right I never stop. Found a way to motivate the niggas' block. Whitney Houston died yesterday. God bless 'er, hope she end up at them heavy gates. Watching the Grammy's just as they dedicate. In the mean time, let's let this marinate. Yea, I'm just vibin' dog. Oh yea (nothing's gonna stop me). Ain't nothin' gonna stop me man. Nothing's gonna stop me. I write poetry via Martin. Justice will be served my brother. But guess what. Nothing's gonna stop me. Oh yea man (nothing's gonna stop me). God bless. Hood"

body 2 body,"[Chorus - Chris Brown]. Baby, you don't have to try to read my mind. Cause you know I wanna get it in. And tell me why would we just think about. If you wanna feel my body.

No panties on, come up out them leg warmers. Wrap up your hair, leave on your heels. Kissing you while I whisper, shawty how it feels. Let ya mind wonder, oh you're thinking dirty. I was thinking you can rob me, miss kentucky dirty. I dream about it, let's take advantage. My body on your body, hope that you can manage. Gotta moan it, damn-it, feels good. Pulling on her hair to let her know I'm still hood. Damn right, so unreal. This year of the Ace, bet she know the deal. [Chorus - Chris Brown]. Baby, you don't have to try to read my mind.

Very sexy fragrance. Are those your real eyes. Cant tell you're partially asian. But I know your body got me focused, I'm just so sedated. And I guarantee I do you better than your past-n-latest. Body to body, where is the sunny. Bet if I hit your spot, I'll make you tsunami. Change up the sheets, no time to sleep. Asked what she's thinking, she replied that I'm a beast. Yeah she replied that I'm a beast. Got it locked between the sheets and even in the streets. [Chorus - Chris Brown]. Baby, you don't have to try to read my mind. Cause you know I wanna get it in.

back against the wall,"[Chorus]. I got my back against the wall. And it feels like all the times before. The pass till the fall. But today I stand and fight this war. I got my back against the wall. I won't break, I won't break, I won't break. No, no, I won't fall. With my back against the wall. [Verse 1]. Struggle in my eyes, guns in the stash. Heart full of pride, sunny days past. Monogram bags, Louis V. tags. Money rule the world, I swear this shit is sad. But I will get over that, and I will get over this. See they remain to hate, but they'll get over it. And my mama told me. Yes she told me watch them friends you with. Should of listened to her, they manure wasn't worth a shit. But I'm too legit to quit, understand my arrogance. Hit them where it hurts, I'm miss him for shit. Back against the wall, but still I manage to ball. Success is on my line, but still I manage to call. I will never fall, that's my reply to all. He gave me everything, that skies apply to all. Soul of a beast, I'ma get them all. Many days of pumps, but still I'm standing tall. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. Uh, and I'm sick of all you blood suckers. Feel like I'ma lose it in this motherfucker. Tell me where the booth at in this motherfucker. So I can burn this bitch down, fireman sucker. Too many days and sleepless nights. I toss and turn and wonder why. My money thoughts corrupted mind. But I guess that's just how I'm designed. Felt like I'm falling down, niggas timid to me all around. But I still remain a beast. Tell them come fuck with me now, I let you win the fight. While I'ma die for war, pride and my respect. I hope you die for yours, money then the power. Continue doing chores, a back against the wall. I penetrate a pause. I'm never looking back, because the destruction caused. Only know to win, you just check the score. [Chorus]"

And I lost my dog and I felt like this the worst that it could get. Till I lost my daughter, felt like emptyin' out that full clip. And I put it on my mind feel for the hand, I'm just gonna slow sip. Cuz I'm way to stressed and again I'm blessed cuz I'm still here. Lookin' in that mirror I can see a man with no fear. Oh lord, oh lord this world is hell although we livin' in it. Gotta keep my vibe. Oh why? Oh why must I just keep on sinnin'?. Tryin' to keep it real in a world so fake, now can I get a witness?. Got niggers killing over Jordan's, getting life in prison.

Loadin' up my pistol, I just pray that all my sins forgiven. And I know I'm livin' wrong but mama, you just pray for me. Gotta make this money so my family forever eager. That Jesus piece around my neck keep the devil away from me. In an old school cut let's keep that problem with me on the secret. Just hopin' right but the man above before I go to sleepin'. In nothing lesser than a G, that's how they bury me. Have mercy on 'em. If I should die before I wait. Pull me out some liquor when you're at the wake. And I'll be good as long as I know daughter's straight. Realest shit I ever wrote, this has a hostile spread. If I should die before I wait. I'm prayin' next to lord for my soul to take.

gangsta shit,"[Intro]. Now that's some gangster shit. Don't know who you're fucking with. Listen. [Verse 1]. Now I've been known to kill them with the flow. The beats is back off to attack him, kicking down your door. You looking at a pro, smoking them like some indigo. See we are Seminoles, running right through your end zone. I'm coming as soon as they holler, I get them, I got them. They know it's on. No more of the games, you know what the name. I aim to bang the chrome. It's Mister Whatever, about my cheddar if you've never known. Money over bitches, now you can carry on. Some call me arrogant, I'm like a veteran. Big shit nigga, I ain't talking elephants. Now what you know about it?. My niggas they bothered about it. It's We the Best the mod, something like Illuminati. I'm taking the coupe to college, trying to find a model about it. Take them to the crib, now it's time to party. [Chorus]. Uh. Now that's some gangster shit. Not fucking with lames, or fucking with faith. Now that's some gangster shit. You fucking with me, or fucking with you. Now that's some gangster shit. All my niggas about it about. Now that's some gangster shit. Now that's some gangster shit. I'm fucking with real and never fake. Now that's some gangster shit. I'm chasing that dough and never hoes. Now that's some gangster shit. All my niggas about it about. Now that's some gangster shit. [Verse 2]. And now I'm back off in the place to be. Got rid of the nice in me, it's nice to meet my enemy. Don't run up on me though, I give you a overdose. I leave them on the stretcher, I ain't talking cardio. I'm sorry you didn't know, I'm dipping, I'm moving a '64. I'm fucking the baddest hoes, I'm beating the pussy like Baggio. Now cut the music up, and pour me up a cup. And roll you up a blunt, if you getting major bucks. Now welcome to gangster shit, I'm hopping up out of the fancy whip. Them chains around my neck, and every diamond costs a grip. See I'm a superstar, I'm never at the bar. I valet park the car, pockets on that salad bar. Nasty with the flow, you can call it caviar. Uh, now that's some gangster shit. I'm with a gangster clique. And all my niggas toting the clip. [Chorus]"
2-12-12 (thoughts),"Rip Whitney Houston. God bless her soul. I'm just vibin' dog. But for you haters. Nothing's gonna stop me. I swear to god. Nothing's gonna stop me. Andi, Kiko, Renegades. Nothing's gonna stop me. Nothing's gonna stop me. Money talks so what's your conversation?. Counting my blesses, my sweet elaborated. Being broke ain't a joke, that feeling is devastating. Night met 'er so that force never stated. Calculating every dollar bill. Reminiscin', they missin' like someone not a mill. Still trippin', this life I'm livin' the dream still. Look at my niggas loyalty's mad real. That's cuz we got this from the bottom up. Number slidin' in my homie momma truck. We did what we had to do, we ain't give a fuck. Now we the niggas winnin' dog, wuddup?. Ain't it funny how the time fly?. Couple cars and a twenty story high rise. Took a minute but shit connecting like wi fi. It's fuck you to the niggas who sad my carrier died. Shit, I'm livin' quite well. On the beach I'm sippin' wine and cracking laughter tales. With a Spanish mommy give me, I pursue the tails. Ask me do I like it, poppy I'm like hell yea. We da best the fuckin' logo. Just hope you get the picture when you take your photos. Own a couple cars but I need one more though. Felt I'm coming soon, real nigga yellow. True, I'm just rappin' dog aye. Nothing's gonna stop me. I tell 'em: nothing's gonna stop me. Yea, feel good when you comin' from nothin' homie. But I tell 'er: nothing's gonna stop me. Swear to god (nothing's gonna stop me). Starvation. In the studio, watching the Grammy's homie. Pray today they nominate the one and only. Probly cry some tears at the ceremony. Only lord knows when they ready for me. Inspiration runnin' through my blood. Motivated from the fact I made through the mud. Kept my faith although they doubted when I lost my buzz. All over somethin' that I'm winnin' ain't gon show me love. In the street label me underrated. Story for respect my only ultimatum. They ask me who that's why you goin' hard. Cuz I just want my mama off that boulevard. I come from a city where there ain't many stars. And given no pity promised them prison bars. Teachers said I won't amount a shit. Graduated high-school, college never in it. Still I manage through seven figures with common sense. And at the age of 52 my mama finally quit. Fuck it right I never stop. Found a way to motivate the niggas' block. Whitney Houston died yesterday. God bless 'er, hope she end up at them heavy gates. Watching the Grammy's just as they dedicate. In the mean time, let's let this marinate. Yea, I'm just vibin' dog. Oh yea (nothing's gonna stop me). Ain't nothin' gonna stop me man. Nothing's gonna stop me. I write poetry via Martin. Justice will be served my brother. But guess what. Nothing's gonna stop me. Oh yea man (nothing's gonna stop me). God bless. Hood"

back against the wall,"[Chorus]. I got my back against the wall. And it feels like all the times before. The pass till the fall. But today I stand and fight this war. I got my back against the wall. I won't break, I won't break, I won't break. No, no, I won't fall. With my back against the wall. [Verse 1]. Struggle in my eyes, guns in the stash. Heart full of pride, sunny days past. Monogram bags, Louis V. tags. Money rule the world, I swear this shit is sad. But I will get over that, and I will get over this. See they remain to hate, but they'll get over it. And my mama told me. Yes she told me watch them friends you with. Should of listened to her, they manure wasn't worth a shit. But I'm too legit to quit, understand my arrogance. Hit them where it hurts, I'm miss him for shit. Back against the wall, but still I manage to ball. Success is on my line, but still I manage to call. I will never fall, that's my reply to all. He gave me everything, that skies apply to all. Soul of a beast, I'ma get them all. Many days of pumps, but still I'm standing tall. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. Uh, and I'm sick of all you blood suckers. Feel like I'ma lose it in this motherfucker. Tell me where the booth at in this motherfucker. So I can burn this bitch down, fireman sucker. Too many days and sleepless nights. I toss and turn and wonder why. My money thoughts corrupted mind. But I guess that's just how I'm designed. Felt like I'm falling down, niggas timid to me all around. But I still remain a beast. Tell them come fuck with me now, I let you win the fight. While I'ma die for war, pride and my respect. I hope you die for yours, money then the power. Continue doing chores, a back against the wall. I penetrate a pause. I'm never looking back, because the destruction caused. Only know to win, you just check the score. [Chorus]"

And any nigga want to get it, I ain't trippin', I'll send about 50 with a body bag. Zip it up, ship, ship his ass at the bottom of the ocean fast. Then I sit back, laugh, with a pound of that hash, me and Ludacris pass that. You will need a gasmask think you can still bag that. Mmmm haha, Ace Hood, Ace Hood, G's hood homie. And guess who, guess who I'm back with it. Ace Hood motherfucker don't act with it. Ruthless than a motherfucker, tell them other brothers don't try 'cause they know that I'm packin' it. Give me your car, then your keys, then your jeans, then your green. If you sneeze then you comin' up absent. And I roll with a pack of them goons and they only think tools with bodies packed in it. More money I'ma keep on stackin' it. Hundred thousand for the chain, immaculate. New whips I'ma keep plate taggin' it. New swag and a Louis duff bag with it. Ace Hood, that's who, you mad with it. To all you haters and you fake antagonists. I got a hit, what's your name? You can have it!. [Chorus: (Ludacris Ad-Libs)]. I wake up and got 4 or 5 bitches in the bed (in the bed). Smokin' weed, Drinkin' liquor by the keg (by the keg). I was born an O.G. if you ain't heard about me. I put 4 or 5 bullets in your head(in your head) [2x]"

You pussies can't handle a afford it. 4,200 my mortgage. Ballin on niggas like Kobe. Fuck all you haters you bore me. Only the real get a piece of the plate. Reppin my city I'm runnin my state.

'Cause I'm out here livin' this hustlas life. I be workin' all day but no nine to five. And you know we don't play when it's time to grind. That's how it goes. You wanna get that dough. I'm makin' it but I'm still hungry. But whatever it takes I gotta go get this money. [Ace Hood - Verse 1]. When I first jumped in the game I was seven years old. Kept the motto get the money, give a fuck about a ho. Servin' porcelain to people left a brick up in my coat. Always told to eat fast. Never snitchin' was the code. I would never postpone 'cause the money get gone. Never waitin' by the phone gotta get it on your own. Real niggas get paid every second of the day. Hit the mall blow a quote that I can't fit in this phrase. Just know it's two colors in that Def Jam chain. Lil' money wanna scam. Bitch I'm outta your range. Make way. Feed me. Gotta get this money. Smokin' nothin' but the best, yeah the boy so flooded. And I still want money. [Chorus]. [Ace Hood - Verse 2]. See you can slow down. My money keeps comin'. You niggas take breaks. My team keeps runnin'. They bring me back bags. Louis Vuitton somethin'. Don't really know the price. Just know it costs money. And when it comes to money. They know it ain't nothin. Blow one hundred on jewels. Make it back up on a Monday. Why niggas tryna floss?. They ballin' outta budget. Everyday on the grind. Bitch my mind is on the money. Tell 'em roll up the trees. And deliver me the scummy. Forget a nine to five. Overrated me to quit. Now a day since legit. I get it opposite legit. Me and my nigga Kon' so addicted to the chips. He gon' let you know the script. [Chorus]. [Ace Hood - Verse 3]. And whatever it takes. Ace Hood 'bout money. How much for the chain?. I spent 'bout a hundred. See you can dim the lights. But my wrist still sunny. They know I'm on the block. And my fitted in the Glock. Dickies cut with a frame. And a half up in my sock. Gotta get it anyway. And keep it level from the cops. Bitch you never play the grind. First rule off top. I been in it for the dough. You niggas need props. I'm just in it for the guap. Hundred million in the pot. Only know to go get it. So the printer don't stop. Grab fifty hit a lot. And go and dump it on a drop. I'm starvin' like Marvin. And ain't no givin' and bargains, like Target"

Couple stacks in my pocket. What the fuck is a wallet?. Nigga show me what you need oh. Call me the Young Nino. All I see is the C-notes. Triple digits and zeros. Nigga keep it on the D low. While I'm stacking the Fritos. I get the shit by you know. Send it to Puerto Rico. Nigga never move by two though. Tell them that's what it do though. Just bring my money back. Yeah I'm talking Polo. Nigga money to be made. That's money to be made. And if this ain't your shit. Then nigga you ain't getting paid. [Chorus]. [Verse 2 - Ace Hood]. Okay now hundred thousand dollars. That's around my collar. Nigga I should see a doctor. Addicted to them dollars. Nigga holler (Holler) holler (Holler) holler (Holler). Fuck off with you cowards. Just feed me with the money nigga.

As soon as we be done nigga, back onto that cash flow. [Chorus]. [Verse 3 - Ac]. You ain't got to tell me. But now the kush in my Louis V. duffle. Bet a nigga smell me. You little nigga, I'm better nigga. If any nigga tell me, that money ain't here pronto. Then I bet them chopper shells be arriving at his front door. I got to step up on my guns so. I see you from a distance. I'm in love with all this money. I ain't see some for you bitches. I do it because I want to. Clueless because I'm under. Influence of this Goosey but my fooleys make me wonder. Are they really hustling? Look at all these bundles. Are they really human? They eat you like piranhas. Look at my G-shock and you can tell a nigga clocking. I know them hoes watching but it's. [Chorus] X3"

I got the blueprint of how to talk that 45. Surprise, realize I can't be fucked with a no scale. Not the hoes, not the money, the swag. Now my g code, I'ma spray and reload. Hit your toe with a tag,. Niggas hood with it, your ace was good with it. He got that ace, I got the spades. Getaway car, we ready for the way,. Or whatever. I can't be stopped, no ? I'm the next sun. Half of million dollars up and get some. Burn on my waist I'm hollow shelling, come get some. I flip, you ain't murder around,. Yeah, ?nigga with the blood clot, don't get blood shot. Murder ain't shit for me, I love taking mug shots. Love taking bitches from paris down to jamaica. Love sitting on the flow of rihanna watching the lakers. I'm a bad boy ain't seen puff in years though. But I keep some b.I.G. Off in my ear lobes, hood. We are different people, we are. We are different people, we are. We are different people, check. Different aspirations, preach, different aspirations, preach. Different aspirations, preach, different aspirations. Mama was a hustler, daddy was a dead beat. Chance of me out the hood was rarer than some red meat. Pistol on my night stand, now I lay me down to sleep. Now I lay me down to sleep, now I lay me down to sleep. Pistol on my night stand, now I lay me down to sleep."

go live,"[Intro - Ace Hood]. Okay. Camera man we going to do like the thirty six frame, you heard me?. It's movie time homie. Mister Hood. [Chorus - Joe Boom]. I jump up out the Bent', I'm stepping outside. There's cameras everywhere. Yeah I'm about to go live. Louis V. shades, to cover my eyes. The paparazzi flashing, I'm about to go live. About to go live, live, live. About to go live, live, live. You want to be fly? I'm on a G5. And everybody broke, ask me worldwide. [Verse 1 - Ace Hood]. Okay, hello to the money, good morning to the bread. What up to you bitches? Bring me breakfast in the bed. Hit a button on the blinds, watch the curtains roll back. Took a look into the mirror, they not fucking wore of that. Better cut it up a notch, put more diamonds on my chest. Bigger stones in my ears, hundred carats in the Lex'. Put more horses in the 'Rari, nasty as calamari. Rolling out with a Barbie, hiding from paparazzi. Tell them I'm going live, Mister Life-of-the-Party. Keep my jewels in the cooler, maybe I know the mula. Pull up in something European so they can flash. In three, two, one, I'm going live on that ass. [Chorus]. [Verse 2 - Ace Hood]. Now tell them tune in, I'm back at it again. Want to be fly like I grew up in the wind. I'm a bad motherfucker, arrogant as I could be. Fresh up out of Louis, have them wishing they was me. I'm sorry that you not, I'm way too fucking hot. And everywhere I go you better know I'm showing out. Got my diamonds on check, carry cash no checks. Want that Beamer not the Lex', now you know I'm finna flex. It go three, two, one, you either ready or you not. Make it feel like Hollywood, every time I'm stepping out. Custom cameras over here, and you know they over there. Bad bitches in my bed, smell the money in the air. [Chorus]"

hallucinations,Renegade renegade. Feeling like I have been crucified. Haven't been the same since my daughter died. Paranormal flourish is my state of mind. Kind of .. last night I took some pain killers. And I have became friends with the death dealer. Couple minutes later I was stupid now. Slowly .. thinking where I have got this pistol from. Damn I was fucked up. Still wondering if my daddy has abandoned us. Lost my dog when he decide to put them .. up. Left the door .. jam them up hitting pain I feel my cold heart. These niggers ? start have my younger put your .. like is all ?. Choppa stop a nigger like a cross gun. Hallucination my creation. Oh lord I am a mad man screaming. Salvation into the mother land. Never money over bothers man. I don't think they understand. Hit the pain that was so poor is like the lions with a pack roar. Come meet the last of a dyeing breed. Guarantee that is some shit that you have never seen. Black man no college degree still I have. Made a way from my mother to eat. Million dollars a day I made it to peace still. I am assertive to the fucking police. I forever be a free nigger as long as the sky. Is with me I will deal with them nigger. Paranoid only lord knows I think I see people. Phantom only lord know. Hallucination my creation. God bless

i don't give a fuck,"I don't give a fuck. They done push me to the limit the more I live. I might blow up any minute, did it again. Now I'm in the back of the paddy wagon. While this cops bragging about the nigga he's jackin. I see no justice. All I see is niggas dying fast. The sound of a gun blast. Then watch the hurst past. Just another day in the life 'G'. Gotta step lightly cause cops tried to snippe me. The catch, they don't wanna stop at the brother man. But then they'll have an accident and pick up another man. I went to the bank to cash my cheque. I get more respect from the mutha-fuckin' dope man. The Grammy's and the American music shows pimp us like hoes. They got dough but they hate us though. You better keep your mind on the real shit. And fuck trying to get with these crooked ass hypocrites. They way they see it, we was meant to be keep down. Just can't understand why we getting respect now. Mama told me they're be days like this. But I'm pissed cause it stays like this. And now they trying to send me off to Kuwait. Gimme a break. How much shit can a nigga take. I ain't goin' nowhere no how. Better bring your guns pal. Cause this is the day we make 'em pay. Fuck bailin' hate I bail and spray with my A-K. And even if they shoot me down. There'll be another nigga bigger. So step but you better step quick. From the mutha-fuckin' underground. Cause the clocks goin' tick and I'm sick of the bullshit. You're watching the makings of a physco-path. The truth didn't last. Before the wrath and aftermath. Who's that behind the trigger?. Who'd do yah figure!?. A mutha-fuckin night nigga. Ready to buck and rip shit up. I had enough and I don't give a fuck. Niggas!, isn't just the blacks. Also a gang of mutha-fuckas dressed in blue slacks. They say niggas hang in packs and their attitude is shitty. Tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city. They say niggas like to do niggas,. Throw me in the cuffs with just two niggas. A street walkin' nigga and a beat walkin' nigga with a badge. I had to shoot yah and the pass for the blast take his cash. And that's just his luck. And bash his head in dump him at the dead in. Cause a nigga like me. Don't really give a fuck. Walked in the store what's everybody staring at. They act like they never seen a mutha fucker wearing black. Following a nigga and shit. Ain't this a bitch. All I wanted was some chips. I wanna take my business else where. But where?. Cause who in the hell cares. About a black man with a black need. They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend. I wonder if knows that my income is more than. His pension, salary and then some. Your daughter is my number one fan. And your trife ass wife wants a life with a black man. So who's the mac in fact who's the black jack. Sit back and get fat off the fat cat. While he thinks that he's getting over. I bust a move as smooth as casanova. And count another quick meal. I'm getting paid for my traid but it's still real. And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme. AS strong as a fuckin' nine. Mail stacked up niggas wanna act up. Let's put the gats up and throw your backs up. But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot. Usta come but he's done, now we run the block. To my brothers stay strong keep yah heads up. They know we fed up. But we they just don't give a fuck. They just don't give a fuck. I gotta give my fuck offs. Fuck you to the San FranCisco police department.

In the motha f*cker days lord just tell em. Why you had to take my dough. They just wanted this car, they just wanted to bowl. They just wanted to leave frightened by wha he saw. I was off in the room waiting my nigga call. When it’s the last time that we would even talk. I told em to be safe in the my dough. A acouple hours later got an unexpected call. My homie he was crying I knew that it was bad. He told me damn gone, you’re lying at your ass. I call it cell phone but nobody hit em back. They say that he was shot down to make it right. He died on the scene that’s when I hit my knees. Begging the lord please heavenly father please. So listen t the dream tell me how could it be. Probably because of me, my homie wanted to see. Then a couple years ago when I lost my dough. It’s tears till this day it’s tears continue to foe. I love my nigga see the pain still remain. Now you watching from heaven I’m falling nigga.

First they love you then they hate you, it's all in the game. Kinda funny when the Malcolm people know my name. Ain't life such a bitch dog?. Took from me to get a deal not a bitch call.

reminiscing,"Let's take these niggers back to '98. Mama in the kitchen, cookin' up her favorite cake. Daddy gone, never home, he say he gotta stay. Five times I only seen that nigger to this day. And I was blind as a youngun but I learned better. Five kids, visitation, game, never. But ain't trippin', mama did your daddy work?. 23 and got a crib that's seven figures worth. Even as a youngun I had bigger dreams. Maybe another way instead of triple beans. 17 all about that green cream. Break that 9 to 5, I quitted in about a week. That's true story, it was overrated. They don't crack those middle fingers cuz they under payment. Back on the block, not a single dollar. I told her mom that hottest nigger had a brother. They laughed at me, they clown me. They hatin' shit, don't want that bitch around me. So I joined the label, dollars and deals. I stayed around the corner for my missal deal. Stacking that money, switching them wips. Motivated by the dope boy ain't gettin' chips. My vision changed, the struggle came. I see my mama cryin', I can feel her pain. The pills are so behind we can't afford a thing. We can't afford a thing. Couple months I met with Dj Katadim. Saw my killing, got a hundred thousand dollars pimp. Call my mother crying like we outta here. Hard times, kiss my ass. Flew the Louie, pressing thousands in the duffle bag. That was 074, back to 20 12. Paid a set, I get one hitin' thirty well. Not sugar coating shit, you niggas fairytale. They free my niggers locked behind them prison cells. I'm one of just a few who send my niggers mail. Hearing a lot of talk 'bout what you niggas do. I'm everywhere, you never there, I'm like a prostitute. Brought my money, let that pistol brush your testicles. Speaking on my fam you get the medic room. A couple top tens, bitch I'm livin' good. Get house in Miami and that record do it. Make them bitches suck it till they catch the fluid. I just lost my daughter but I'm prayin' through it. Star faish, star faish. Livin' every day like I'm on vacaish. Underrated, they say I is. And Imma give 'em heel over satan feels. Star faish, star faish. Like looking in the eyes of a poor baby. Poor baby, they scared not. Did it for you non-believers case you wonder why. Amen. Love"

Well, you'd better be. Let's slow, slow it down. Remember that time we was out in Puerto Rico?. Told me that you love me, it can never be a sequel. Wish I could've paused our love like Tivo. My homie can't see, told me that's the way to be though. She says that I'm stupid, heck I'm stupid. I ain't gotta ask, she just do it. Said she da best, I say prove it. We gon slow down. Ain't nothing like me you can bet your bottom dollar. Couldn't you see I called, well I never do bother. Heard you in school, you a fan, you scholar. Heard them doing better now the trig gone wild. Celebrity, celebrity. Shoot a star so heavily. But damn, I got other things on my mind. You wanna slow down. Now you wanna tell me slow it down. When I tell you bring them hoes around. Wanna kill it but you can't stop (slow down). Lemme call you after 1 o' clock. Your bad money got sorta fine. I like your body's kinda border line. Tryna put them all single mind. You wanna slow down. Slow it down, slow it down. Slow it down (slow down). Slow it down, slow it down. Slow it down (slow down). Slow it down, slow it down. Slow it down. Okay, I'm cool with a bitch named Sandra Lee. Friends with her twin and they both the beast. Head give me and they Vietnamese. And they love fucking me, they got the similar dream. Money stay the calling, so I fuck 'em and leave. Waste my time and I'm chuckin' the bee. So they beggin' me to just slow down. You read on my eye. Girl, do that same thing every time. Jack when you're around. But I don't know if I, I don't know if I. Could slow it down, slow it down. My nigga Acdc. He has six girls for us that's three a piece, three a piece. What they hittin' for?. He said that we may just wanna be down with the two. I said I'll be on my way. He said they already on juice. Imma ready on that cush. Already on that 80 proof. I buff in my coop. I press a button and lose the roof. But that's broad top. Burn the bread, call it pop tart. And I'm in the mall, the nigga shop a cart. Got a U hog in the parking lot. Now you wanna tell me slow it down. When I tell you bring them hoes around. Wanna kill it but you can't stop (slow down). Lemme call you after 1 o' clock. Your bad money got sorta fine. I like your body's kinda border line. Tryna put them all single mind. You wanna slow down. Slow it down, slow it down. Slow it down (slow down). Slow it down, slow it down. Slow it down (slow down).
