how long,"Yeah uh uh (ouo baby ouo baby). Come on, Yeah. It's been awhile since I lived in a place that I felt was home. Last time was when I was 15 so young. I used to be a problem I wasn't far from home. The ones that know me just don't know I've done wrong. In my life I lived a thousand lie just to keep strong. Different face different attitude each of their own. I used to be suicidal because my dad screwed up. Used to beat me up used to kick me up. When I was 12 I got kicked out it felt like hell. Hell it felt like jail alone with myself. I was just trying hard to make something out of myself. It didn't help being Asian Yo it made me rebel. And all the people who knew me for the past 2 years. Yo none of you had to see these tears. All you know is a man without hates or fears. But yo I hated being kicked out my place you hear. And I'm afraid of turning back to my old self. And I'm afraid of being eaten by my own wealth. It's crazy how nothing in this life can faze me. But when ever my family decides to screw me up (listen). Tell me how long it's been since you and I will get a long. Tell me how long it's been since our house was a happy home. When was the last time you didn't do me wrong. (when was the last time). How long, (how long), how long, (how long). Yo it's been a while since I messed up. But now I'm back to these gutters where I dressed up. I never ever had the best luck. But now it's changing for me. The lords eye have never been a stranger to me. And although I know this life has got it's up and downs. I'm sick of changing back and forth from a smile to frown. I'm sick of changing where a live going from town to town. City to city coast to coast then come back around. I'm sick of fighting with my folk over some bull. I'm sick of cops pulling me out of the school pit. Lord you know I'm trying my best to do what is best. But then again you made me go through these times I get. These times it can be a stress on my life style. And every minute it's hard for me to grab a light smile. And every minute it's hard for me to be a good child. Damn I haven't see my family it's been while. Little sis I know you look up to me but yo. I ain't the best example in life but I am your bro. I ain't the best man in life but I love you so (please be). Promise me that you'll make something good of your self. You know. Tell me how long it's been since you and I will get a long. (how long has it been). Tell me how long it's been since our house was a happy home. When was the last time you didn't do me wrong. (when was the last time). How long, (how long), how long, (how long). Come on. When I look into your eyes I can tell that. That this life we live is half good and it's half bad (yeah). But I know that you can get through all these stormy weather. Whenever you need I will be there (baby yeah). Tell me how long it's been since you and I will get a long. Tell me how long it's been since our house was a happy home. When was the last time you didn't do me wrong (come on). How long, (how long), how long, (how long). Tell me how long it's been since you and I will get a long. (it's been a while). Tell me how long it's been since our house was a happy home. (Since you and I were cool with each other). When was the last time you didn't do me wrong. (when was the last time). How long, (how long), how long, (how long). Tell Me"

how long,"Yeah uh uh (ouo baby ouo baby). Come on, Yeah. It's been awhile since I lived in a place that I felt was home. Last time was when I was 15 so young. I used to be a problem I wasn't far from home. The ones that know me just don't know I've done wrong. In my life I lived a thousand lie just to keep strong. Different face different attitude each of their own. I used to be suicidal because my dad screwed up. Used to beat me up used to kick me up. When I was 12 I got kicked out it felt like hell. Hell it felt like jail alone with myself. I was just trying hard to make something out of myself. It didn't help being Asian Yo it made me rebel. And all the people who knew me for the past 2 years. Yo none of you had to see these tears. All you know is a man without hates or fears. But yo I hated being kicked out my place you hear. And I'm afraid of turning back to my old self. And I'm afraid of being eaten by my own wealth. It's crazy how nothing in this life can faze me. But when ever my family decides to screw me up (listen). Tell me how long it's been since you and I will get a long. Tell me how long it's been since our house was a happy home. When was the last time you didn't do me wrong. (when was the last time). How long, (how long), how long, (how long). Yo it's been a while since I messed up. But now I'm back to these gutters where I dressed up. I never ever had the best luck. But now it's changing for me. The lords eye have never been a stranger to me. And although I know this life has got it's up and downs. I'm sick of changing back and forth from a smile to frown. I'm sick of changing where a live going from town to town. City to city coast to coast then come back around. I'm sick of fighting with my folk over some bull. I'm sick of cops pulling me out of the school pit. Lord you know I'm trying my best to do what is best. But then again you made me go through these times I get. These times it can be a stress on my life style. And every minute it's hard for me to grab a light smile. And every minute it's hard for me to be a good child. Damn I haven't see my family it's been while. Little sis I know you look up to me but yo. I ain't the best example in life but I am your bro. I ain't the best man in life but I love you so (please be). Promise me that you'll make something good of your self. You know. Tell me how long it's been since you and I will get a long. (how long has it been). Tell me how long it's been since our house was a happy home. When was the last time you didn't do me wrong. (when was the last time). How long, (how long), how long, (how long). Come on. When I look into your eyes I can tell that. That this life we live is half good and it's half bad (yeah). But I know that you can get through all these stormy weather. Whenever you need I will be there (baby yeah). Tell me how long it's been since you and I will get a long. Tell me how long it's been since our house was a happy home. When was the last time you didn't do me wrong (come on). How long, (how long), how long, (how long). Tell me how long it's been since you and I will get a long. (it's been a while). Tell me how long it's been since our house was a happy home. (Since you and I were cool with each other). When was the last time you didn't do me wrong. (when was the last time). How long, (how long), how long, (how long). Tell Me"
