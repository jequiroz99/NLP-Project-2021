reminded (feat. adele),"She said if you love me let me know. If you don't then let me go. [Tyga - verse 1]. The memories soon fade, why couldn't they be erased. You hoping it's just a phase, your heart'll heal within days. Some people think it's wrong, being single isn't right. But you hurt the right person you'll be wrong all your life. Inevitable to let you go, separate the sexual. Feelings when I'm close to you, f-cking til' the sky is blue. Morning time, home fries, cooking with your t-shirt on. Panties, bra, damn I eat you good when you take it off. Ha, damn I'm nasty, I mean you make me nasty. Going the extra mile flying just to make me happy. Did it all, too much wasn't enough. Now it's gone but sometimes I sit and hope. [Adele]. I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded. I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited. But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded. I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited. But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. [Tyga - verse 2]. Whatever ever happened to love and being happy. Infatuated with lust, I loved you and now I'm backwards. Time is of the essence, I broke it, took it for granted. Love is like art, heartbroken on the canvas. Painted the perfect picture, you seemed to never get it. Colors prevail and you turn into a f-cking monster. Schizophrenic, nicknames Bonnie and Clyde. Now doctors calling us Mr. and Mrs. Hyde. How do you manage but still do you. Can't compromise, we all equal opportunists. It's when I'm level headed they aiming to take my head off. Birds flock together, tell bitches I'm throwing bread off. Cold, women, fall in love getting splintered?. Strictly plutonic, only thing she want is dinner. I can't fuck with her, get her some tonic, gin, liquor. She might let me lick her, now she miss me sayin. [Adele]. I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded. I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited. But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded. I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited. But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. [Tyga]. Angels in the a.m., sin on my flesh. Girls in the p.m., excuses PMS. They all wanna love em, call em Ms. Next. Spirit of a hustler, I only chase checks. Go home. I ain't tryna do you wrong. I'd rather be alone. Just sittin on the throne"

2 am,"It's 2 Am in the mornin. Pressin my alarm again. Stressin over my mom and friends. Sometimes, I wish I was in a coma. Damn! Wakin up to the cold wind. Sometimes, I wish I was a kid again. Sometimes, I don't even wanna remember it. Cause one time I remembered what I couldn't forget. Damn! My stepdad beatin me again. For a bad grade, he must of had A's. The way he was hurtin me in a bad way. My mom hearin the scream but just turned away. What the fuck, are you people crazy?. I was only a baby, five months when they gave me. To my grandma, who was racist. But I ain't give a fuck, I just faced it. Like mace to the police, I was danger. Feelin like I'm in a manger. Baby Jesus, save me from the anger. She's tryin to get me, into this closet I vanished quickly. Fuck that, I took 50. From her purse bag, told her ""Don't miss me"". I ain't comin back, catch me on another path. I need a bubble bath. Someone, take me in the plastic basket. Sittin on bubble wrap, I'm abandoned. I need a new home, that isn't damaged. A family whom care, to be parents. Errant, my life on the mic. Might wasn't raised too right, so I. Had to decide to turn on the light. Do somethin right, before I'm layin with the mice. Rotten alone on my neighbor's stolen bike. Tryin to think what my afterlife, gon' look like. It gotta look right... it gotta look right.... Back to my bad life. Another day in the fast life got me feelin like I'm on the crack pipe. No lie, just the thought. Of me gettin that type of high, but I'm in the dark. Where the shadows, follow, your every walk. And as I move, I'm feelin like a shopping cart. Gimme this, gimme that son. What'chu mean - ain't you supposed to be my mom?. Why don't you ask God, I worked hard for these two dimes. I care what it's worth - just the fact that it's mine. Check your purse, don't you got. My life savings that you've been savin from birth?. Oh - I forgot you spent that. On your own gift wrap - I ain't get shit last Christmas. But a hug and a family wishlist for next year and shit. Huh! 'Round next year and shit. I'm gonna be on shit you can't even pronounce, in English. I got anger. That's why I paint these songs, visually painting. It's awful ain't it?

black crowns,"All I see is black crowns. King me 'cause this is my time now. So all you other niggas bow down. 'Cause all I see on me is black crowns. Black crowns. Uhh, heavenly father, appoint me to the coronation. I deserve it, brought music for clarification. Envision my past, egypt reincarnated. Negativity hill, over the hump camels waiting. Never gave up, most of my peers forsaken. One make it, we all make it but I delivered that patient. King chronicles, never write it too logical. Fake niggas saying 'what up, fam?' but we ain't biological. Hands down to my mother, she the greatest ever. Since I was the only child, wasn't too much to stress her. Waking up before work, leaving allowance on the dresser. Raising the prince under pressure, no king, no refuge. It's all good, got homies like boyz n the hood. We all good, I mean no matter what circumstances was. Champagne, weed, pills, it do the same. These niggas gassed up, too much butane. Working hard like one day I'll afford the 4-door porsche. Approaching every corner cautious. Too much shopping, niggas calling you a target. Too much flossing, niggas gossiping in your blog shit. I rather put one in the air, congratulate careers. Death defying moments, people that I ain't seen in years. What you running from when you you're your only fear?. Guess my time is here.... Now.... All I see is black crowns. King me 'cause this is my time now. So all you other niggas bow down. 'Cause all I see on me is black crowns. Black crowns. Uhh, fatigue, I'm feeling jaded. She gave me the number but I ain't never saved it. Shit is solid, why these niggas played it?. Drew the right cards, but I ain't get to play it. Determine payrolls, living the lifestyle. You couldn't be in if you was to see it right now. I think I see it right now. They judge me every day, life on trial. Take your money, niggas betting on my downfall. Many all real hoes, bitches gonna call. Five fingers, pledge allegiance to my one god. We'd have been through hell, so heaven ain't far. Two cars sedans, tearing it on the way to the grammys. Guess we nominated, guess they appreciate us. These niggas often imitate us. We just stay creative. All I see is black crowns. King me 'cause this is my time now. So all you other niggas bow down. 'Cause all I see on me is black crowns. Black crowns. One time in the, one time in the air for the.... Two, two, two times in the, two times in the air for the.... Both hands, both hands, both hands in the air for the.... One time, two times, times.... Just wanted to call to let you know how proud I am. Sweetie, this album is amazing. I have never imagined that god would bless you so much. As he is going to continue to bless you. He's already made you the king that you are. Only one to wear the black crown. Well, I just want you to know how much I love you. And how awesome you are. And how I am so, so honored to have a son as yourself. I could never have ask for more, you're just amazing. And I am just so excited for this album. I think this album is definitely your baby. And it's definitely gonna be heard by a lot of people. And a lot of people are going to love it. They're gonna love it, love it, love it. And god's gonna continue to bless you with all the talents that you.... I'm just so proud, I just wanna she'd a tear right now. Ok mommy loves you and you the best thing ever. You are my heart. I love you sweetie, bye bye"

Take a look at your life 'fore you judge mine. Middle finger high, fuck a peace sign. Please give me somethin' to write about. it's been too long. 23 years behind bars, no father, shoulder to lean on. No love lost, just cold found. I just, wanna see wealth and my family smile. Wanna pass a better generation down. Cosigned since a child, let him make his way down. A man who they praise now, gon' kneel down. say a prayer loud. I'm here, niggas actin' like I had invitations. Like a nigga just slept, woke up in a mansion and shit. Like a nigga in the club all night dancin' and shit. Like the Jamie Foxx Show, bitches actin' fancy and shit. Shit, if I could I would, my nigga. Right now I'm just focused, livin' good, my nigga. All that shit on Tv lookin' good, my nigga. Shit, you doin' your thing, as you should, my nigga. As you should, my nigga. Keep doin' your thing. I see you. Just take it day by day. Can't take this shit when you leave. Only thing you leave behind is your bloodline.

careless world,"[Intro]. I awoke from a dream. Filled of a world full of greed and hate. The world was my thoughts, and surroundings. I realized I needed to rise... and become king. My own destiny. [Hook]. Take a look around, tears from they eyes. Knees on the ground, money in the sky. Take a look around, ain't shit nice?. Praying for my life, hope I make it through the night. [Verse 1]. Take a look around, the city on fire. It's all taking place in the middle of my mind. I stand in the middle, cause death right beside. Murdering is simple, get your life simplified. Where the bones lie, rebuild another life. America's pie, put my hand in the pot. I can't get caught in the streets I was taught. Raised off anger, but it wasn't my fault. Nigga, take a look around, it's needles on the ground. Never gave three fucks, and I still don't now. I'm fucking in the house, babysitter on the couch. Thirteen like, ""What this shit coming out?"". Pass me a jimmy, I ain't ready for a child. I hope nobody hears: ""Bitch, why you so loud?"". Turn on the tube, put my head on the cloud. Breathe, inhale, the angles can't help. Tyga. Take a look around. [Hook]. Take a look around, tears from they eyes. Knees on the ground, money in the sky. Take a look around, ain't shit nice?. Praying for my life, hope I make it through the night. Take a look around. [Verse 2]. Take a look around. All night, fighting em for my life. Praying that everything gon be right. (Take a look around). Ain't it nice, truth over the lies?. Young Knights, we kings in the skies. (Take a look around). I ride around in my city. Bitches pictures up in they titties. Man, you fake, all of us know it. I'm original and I show it. Roll one time for everyone down and. T-Two times for the nigga that bounce. Then why you sitting round on some couch shit. My money building, like houses. Feeling like you wise. Truth be told, it's all lies. These the days of out lives. Why you wasting all of your time?. Voices from the skies. Said that evil fall in yo rise. They judge me low to the dirt. Then they celebrate to of my highs. Why you-Why you wanna be fake, I fucking hate you. Why you made cause I ain't take you?. Last day alive, I wouldn't even date you. ""I'll replace you with somebody better"" that you only make up. We just make up, wake up king and queen and rule the world a little later. Later on in that day, tears all in her face. I said I'm going away. She begging me to stay. Took a look in her eyes, then she put my hands on her waist. Said, ‚ÄúDon't leave, we've got a baby on the way‚Äù. Take a look around. All night, fighting em for my life. Praying that everything gon be right. (Take a look around). Ain't it nice, truth over the lies?. Young Knights, we kings in the skies. (Take a look around). I ride around in my city. Bitches pictures up in they titties. Man, you fake, all of us know it. I'm original and I show it. (Take a look around). I ride around in my city. Bitches pictures up in they titties. Man, you fake, all of us know it. I'm original and I show it. (Take a look around). [Outro: Martin Luther King Jr.]. I want you to know tonight. That we, as a people, will get to the promised land. And I'm not worried about anything, I'm not fearing ANY man. My EYES have seen the glory, of the coming of the Lord"

diss song,"[Intro]. I ain't tryna diss you. I just wanna know the issue. Yea. I got some shit on my mind. [Verse 1]. First off, this song, meant to be tooken wrong. Bad intentions and all, don't want the problem resolved. Heard it was you I'm like nah not my dawg. Went to school together Took the bus and all. Back of flashin cars, tryna be a boss. Tryna fit in with the hustlers, they told us run along. Tryna learn to shoot dice, got my bike stolen dawg. You still wanna gang bang, ride deep in cars. Til I see the nigga wrong hat, now it's head off. Picked up a notepad, bet you gon do the same. Looked down the shit I saw now, I don't look at shit the same. Now how am I to blame for you choosin a life in made?. Nigga you a man too, why you mad at me?. Same gravity hold you down, that's embarrassing. Your comments was hilarious, not even congratulations. Told niggas we're related, even when I made it. Had nothing but good things to say about you. Even though you still hate it. I know you think 'cause this fame I'm probably jaded. Ain't get a chance to see yo daughter, tell her happy belated. For me, I don't care if that car lease, you in it you own it. And that's all me, being smart don't mean cheap. You could take a life sitting in the driver's seat. Take your shades off, I'm like. (Remember me?). [Hook]. I ain't tryna diss you. I just wanna know the issue. If you know what you say then say who you are. We ain't gotta take it this far. So go on, make a diss song, this is not a diss song. They just wanted this song, tell em play this song. I ain't tryna diss you. I just wanna know the issue. Listen to this song. [Verse 2]. Lookin at my story, breakin down my glory. Judging my highlights when it's shots like Horry. Always tryin t√¥ take from me, criticize, hate on me. Wanna call me fake cuz you really can't relate t√¥ me. Your remarks, blatantly out of character. You sociopaths couldn't make a dollar in America. On your keyboard cuz I blew up like a keloid. Me boy, why you niggas gotta be a kill joy?. I gave you niggas something to ride to. Gave you niggas something to get fly to. Gave you niggas something to die to. Niggas want the fast life, barely in the drive through. I advise you, do what yo life allow you to. You're a fan nigga? it's cool, I was once too. All that feedback, really don't need that. You like it? Buy it. You don't? don't cop it. Catid, it be great but my eyes lit. Ignorance is bliss so I can't blame yo ignorance. It's irrelevant, I'm relevant. I'm a big event so go ahead and vent. (I'm a big event so go ahead and vent). [Hook]. [Bridge]. Listen to diss song. Listen to diss song. Diss song. If you know what you say then say who you are. We ain't gotta take it this far. I ain't tryna diss you. I ain't tryna diss you. Tell em play this song. I ain't tryna diss you. Make a diss song. Tell em play this song. Diss song. Diss song. [Verse3]. Bill rings, let the birds sing. Had to sacrifice, never knew what pain will bring. This moment of clarity. I do it for my auntie? s nephew, never had a niece. They call it spoken word, don't want it to speak. Don't mix the colors with whites as if it was bleach. Back of the bus, niggas fightin over window seats. Tryna compete, T-Raww? s. Make this idea complete. Ryan just got killed, who is there t√¥ blame?. God rest his soul, tryna protect his gold chain. It's rules to the shit, but just it ain't a game. Give or take, niggas still gon violate. Not up for discussion, nobody cockin and bussin. You tough?. It's always someone tougher sayin fuck me some public law. Bussin, I kept it 1000 to be exact. Went from hood racks t√¥ Maybachs, how hood is that?. Plaques on the wall, wall match the chrome gat. Gat packed, backpack, backpack rapper never was that. Niggas fire arms like they fuckin fist gone. These simple heartbeats, that's a real diss song. (Motherfucker)"
do it all,"[Verse 1]. Looking at the ceiling, thinking why I treat you bad. Ain't no worser feeling than knowing I did it for the laughs. Arguing all I was doing, accusing you -- my bad. Said let's take some time, never mind, rewind... Looking at the ceiling, thinking why I treat you bad. Ain't no worser feeling than knowing I did it for the laughs. Arguing all I was doing, accusing you -- my bad. Said let's take some time, never mind, just playing with your mind. I always thought, play dumb and let the other one love. Why get caught up in a web of trust?. Only love for fun, I'm too young, I thought. All I wanted was a thanks, them Louboutins I bought. But it ain't your fault. Heaven knows you deserve it all. You sent letters to my heart, but I burnt them all. The Bible says before you run, gotta learn to crawl. But I don't wanna waste time if we ain't involved. [Hook]. Aw Aww. We been through it all. I know I broke your heart once before. But I'm done. Aw aww awww. Tell me what's wrong. I know I never listen, but just listen to this song. Aww man. I promise we gon do it til the sun come down. I swear it's going down. I promise we gon do it til the sun come out. Fuck if they don't do it, we gon do it all. [Verse 2]. Now the ceiling fan spinning -- getting dizzy, man. Wondering who she with, maybe should I call?. Don't be desperate, man. This ain't no tag-you're-it, hide-and-seek shit. Reality just kicked in, I lost one and now she's winning. Found another nigga she did. Says he treat her like a queen, but she probably control him. Fuck that, I gotta get her back to where we started. Start over again, this time her heart's in. Honestly, leave us, leave us, let's just talk about it. I know before I wasn't much of a man about it. But this time I realize I can't live without you. Believe when I say it's true. I love you. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. Love make you do it all. Going up and down like a see-saw. Can't be a player forever, dog. It feels so good, but I know it's wrong. Motherfucker, drink what I'm sipping on. Motherfucker, drink what I'm sipping on. Motherfucker, drink what I'm sipping on. A bottle of love, tell me if it's too strong. [Hook]"

echoes (interlude),"The ceiling's falling in, everytime you don't know where you've been. Our love, seventeen to lifetime. The seasons change when we all stay the same. The pain I felt back then won't ever go away. Echoes call me back to the feeling again. Echoes call me back to the feeling again. Echoes call me back to the feeling again. [Tyga]. At this point, I realize love is not an emotion I can neglect. My queen thought I wasn't ready for love. She was right. What did love mean to me? It didn't mean anything. Compassion, affection... I just know I wanna win it back. Can't be a king without love. Love..."
enemies,"[Verse 1: Tyga]. Driving, but my mind in the back. You ride along, but it's quiet cause we argue prior to that. I left my phone, stopped for gas, then some girl named Janet call. Said it really pissed you off and you let it build a wall. Emotions tall, we? re in the mall. And some random girl call didn? t mean to text her back. I ain't trying to lose it all, cause family first and pussy last. The last pussy that I had it was good. But she ain't no trophy to brag. But I should do it anyway, cause we can fall off any day. And you'll be right back to where you was. Yeah, your momma place. And things are safe. Bills are paid and you just lay around, man. You're so spoiled now, only child!. Business as usual, while you yell our business so loud. Bringing these groupie bitches around you. They ain't your friends, they're foul. Swear so they tell addresses in your mail first to say. ""I told you so! "". But first off, ain't they all alone?. Yeah, I told you so, you keep your enemies too close. Not everybody auntie know. We're supposed to be like on the low!. Remember before we've been down this road. Tie your flat on the slope. Came to a stop as soon as I spoke, cause you know. [Hook: Tyga & Kris Stephens]. I wanna tell the world about you, but it's like we're sworn secrecy!. Why do we sacrifice, growing up to fall in love so fast. Hope we don't become enemies!. I put my faith in God, you put your faith in me. Now I'm just trying to keep my sanity!. Why do we sacrifice to fall in love so fast?. Man, I hope we don't be enemies. I'm still seeking. [Verse 2: Tyga]. I ran into my ex like the other day didn't wanna let you know. Cause usually you look the other way. Despise face with hatred, visions of me and her naked. Lies, you can't take it, cheated before, but not much lately!. Lately I've been so into this shit, love is amazing!. Said: 'you was amazing spending your time. All of your time into the days when. But it's one person you relate with. You go wild and lay with!. Never been good with relationships, life difficult. She make it basic. Yeah, when the bass hit I drive slow, your body in my control. It's my control, ain't gotta go no where, just post like field goal!. As the time goes, we'll grow, too. No telling what I might do without you. Cause I got a past and you do too. But I ain't gotta judge what you've been through, cause. . [Hook: Tyga & Kris Stephens]. I wanna tell the world about you, but it's like we're sworn secrecy!. Why do we sacrifice, growing up to fall in love so fast. Hope we don't become enemies!. I put my faith in God, you put your faith in me, now. I'm just trying to keep my sanity!.

Competition, I'm your favourite, knock knock. It's me, motherfucker, you're dead wrong. Turning your doorknob, a heartthrob. Never my title but you bitches getting robbed.

Let God talk. Stand back lil nigga, let God talk. Tryna follow Christ, but this club light super bright. And they pay me cash every single night. Taking models back to the crib. I know you want my life, you don't want my life. Couldn't handle what they write about you. The Superman of height, you can get 'em high. But how far is you willing to climb for your own shine?. Blowing shine, papers let a nigga vibe, letting God talk. I'm like when summer approach. Niggas thinking they're good, but they're more To. I'm known coast to coast, you tryna play God. With the devil's robes. It's only one God, boy, you far from close. Been ready, change cars like winter coats. Niggas bubblegum, Winterfresh, in they Easter clothes. No lint on my Easter clothes.

Fuckin' with the wrong one, you ain't try to double back. Time to find some love for that, lay up and cuddle that. In the club gettin' on, rather chill in bubble bath. parlayin'. And I know I ain't saying much. But you gotta learn to give trust. Even when it's no trust, you gotta find some. Being young on your own it's like the world against ya. I can bet I could preach that. Appreciate what I do for that. It's more what I came from if you cater back. Lemme guide you, get inside you, style you. Is what I'm getting at. It's hard for you. It's too easy if it's all for you.

Gotta fly private cause my niggas got felonies. Used to do Beverly, now we shop overseas. Pop that dick, bitches fit it in their ovaries. Damn, I love it when a bitch got her ass tatted. Said she just got it done, don't pat it. Both hands left cheeks now I'm left handed. Ass so big, can't look at it. Can't look at it, can't look at it. Made me bust fast like I'm trigger happy. She like when I talk shit like Bill O'Reilly. And I give her hard wood, like a cabin. Cabin in the woods. All you niggas actin' scary. Get my collab on, Dr. Romanelli. Shirt off, nigga feelin' like Makaveli. Y'all my niggas goin' HAM. We don't need a deli. Ain't shit you can tell me. Got ‚Äòem pissed off, R. Kelly. Bitches tell me ‚Äúsure‚Äù like Al B.

i'm gone (feat. big sean),"Looking around glass, my future is in the past. I'm re-arranging my life, I'm single and now I laugh. All of the moments we had, beginning and just the end. At the end, stealing friends, heard I was on your hit list. Damn, now I'm driving ferrarris fucking random bitches. People saying I made it but I don't feel too different. Wayne told me ""close your eyes, they'll never see your vision"". So I stay ready to die behind these biggie lenses. Reinventing all the audemars/breguet shit. Just left the hood, word to the 5th dist. Bout to cop a? roof like diddy. And my city color purple nigga, no ceiling. It takes time when you plying on the beat. I kill it, I bet I kill it. Producer witness to see. Bitches stand on their feet, handicap get out your seat. Got that buzz: lil b, sting a bitch: ali. Comparing tighter rappers, but my songs greater. Just compare me to dope dealers and ball players. Cause I'm a dope ass nigga and I ball, player. Never save a ho, can't even get a life saver. We gon fuck out way to the top and fall later. So I'mma fuckin never call her later. Skinny nigga got my weight up. Middle finger to my haters, why you chasing? we erase em. Mufucka I'm gone!. Middle finger to my haters, mufucka why you hating? I'm gone. I ain't really wanna do it but I did it to em, nigga I'm gone. Leave the beat shit alone, leave the bullshit at home, I'm gone. Even though I'm out of here, nigga gotta keep it real, I'm gone. She fuckin with me, these niggas ain't fuckin with me. Got my mind on my money, my money piling up hundreds. You say you did it, I done it. You old nigga, I'm younger. You fold up under pressure. I'm good straight in?. Bitches pecking my wood: wood chuckka chuckka. Never gave 2 fucks: double rubbers. Now your color turn your face to a red gusher. And your girl stick it to me like a car bumper. Never depended on anyone co-dependent. Kept my thoughts to myself, I don't need opinions. No middle mans, in the middle of my sands. Niggas thing they sweet, they can't even pay their incidentals. I'm instrumental, on any instrumental. I ain't pullin teeth, nigga better hide your pillow. To these rappers to the fucking grizzle. Bad to the bone, red zippers, mike jizzle, I'm gone. Middle finger to my haters, mufucka why you hating? I'm gone. I ain't really wanna do it but I did it to em, nigga I'm gone. Leave the beat shit alone, leave the bullshit at home, I'm gone. Even though I'm out of here, nigga gotta keep it real, I'm gone. Finally famous in this.... I say, fuck sleep stayed up. Fuck you, pay up. Always got the paycheck. Never took a pay cut. Payday will be worth all the broke nights I stayed up. So in my cup I'm mixing up whatever dreams are made of. Not too many young g's made of what I am. So I was waiting on a doctor man, patient as I am. I guess a young d-boy made it into a man. With girls half-naked around like we finna land the sand. Red-eyes to rome and they connecting to france. With some bomb-ass pussy, that bitch came straight from iran. My jewelry made in japan, I'm off california drugs. And where I made my money? nigga, all of the above. I could count my inner circle on my hands and my feet. Passing joints long as a branch cause it's family tree. Doing ""kush-ups"" man cause the weed too strong. I'm a g + 1 what's that muthafuck? that's gone"

It neva rains in Southern California. [Verse 1: Tyga]. Fresh off the runway, today gon be a good day. Her first time in L. A. , she heard 'bout Secret Sunday. Party on roof top, convertible drop top. Want the Axel Foley life, talkin Beverly Hills cop. 2 shots, we sip a lot, one shot, that's all you got. She just wanna be on the scene, stuntin in parking lots. First time she feel at home, second time did it wrong. Third time's a charm, now she ready for it all. I place my bets high, no time for actin shy. Startled by the lights on stage, don't close yo eyes. Thinkin rodeo drive, sweets at the lama ties. Oh she fly but it's gon take more and we ain? t tired. Hoping that they gon come, she's saving up her ones. Saying she love to hustle, champagne for fun. A New York stripper, said she left her nigga. La won't tip er, she runnin back to that nigga.

Swiping when I'm overseas, Chanel with the codeces. Berkin make er twerk it, I pop it while she workin. Niggas poppin in bands when she walk out by them curtains. Make yo rainin honest cuz I swear that she deserve it. Nowhere to nothing, nigga money longer than that suburban. Love er but she a stripper, magnum wrapped just like a turban. We just out further here, I'm going deep enough to hurt it. Yea she a squirter, that pussy homicide. And my dick can murder, them legs suicide. And I click on purpose, we fuckin Oceanside.

My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream. [Verse 1: Tyga]. Uh, chandelier ceiling, my couch, don't sit with denim. My marble floors are killing, gold cars are so relentless. 5 girls in the kitchen, they cooking something like chemists. Monumental (?), statues like Egyptians. God cover my soul, need it, can't let it go. I know you get lonely when I ain't home, on the road. I know I ain't perfect, I'm out here working for the throne. I would take you along, but then that college loan you'll owe. Young girls in cheap dresses, tryna impress us. Saying they all different, but I don't show them no effort. Underestimated that (?), then I tested. Had to make investments, honey colored dressed it. I'm blessed it, cross-sign baptism West shit. Shit on anybody with an opinion, you dead wrong. Go against a bull nigga head-on. I'm too strong, eight arms sticking to a bomb. Army stance, ready for war. We use a Andy Warhol to paint the decor. Apologizing for my actions, sometimes I get bored. They say my music knocks, so I hope it open every door. [Hook: Tyga x2]. We all dream one day we kings and queens. We all dream one day we be kings and queens.

We all dream one day we be kings and queens. My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream. My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream. [Verse 3: Nas]. You're in the presence of a majestic, esoteric. Message from the most ghettoest king, worldwide respected. I can say ghettoest cause I come from where metal spit. Praying to God I can slide and slip out the Devil's grip. Won't pop another pill, can't drink another sip. Tryna slow down with this p-ssy, I can't, I love this shit. I seem to love these whips, a white. Maserati's my birthright car, pass it, I need another hit. At night, where they murdered (?). That's the same block Metta World Peace learned to play ball. See I'm born alone, die alone, from the hoods to the private home. College to prison, understand it, knowledge and wisdom. Shout out to baby mothers of niggas who gangbang. Cause he could die any day and you still the same thing. So that make you a queen, surviving anything. Escobar season begins, so let the semis ring. Pimp of the year, I could smack your father. Not only with my hand, but with a black revolver. I been in pressed silk since breast milk. Mets cap on tilt, we some kings, nigga"

light dreams (featuring marsha ambrosius),"Unreal to a close eye,. Can't feel but you heard that I'm close by. It's more vivid the image invented in my mind,. I look around and really I see a fake smile. No time, when the tickets down,. My Rolex style don't mean shit now. It's just another pay cut my mind made up. Unnecessary lay-ups. You can still win n got a rich n star player. Fuck a hater still remain-a-self-made nigga. Live bigger, credit cards no limits. I drop 20 on the luggage took 10 minutes. I don't shop online those are all gimmicks. Only make moves when your hearts in it. B.I.G. said it; so I entertain like Cedric. Standin on the trunk roof top unit city. Batman, spotlight, gotta say you bitches. The jokes on you Jack,. Who the fuck you gon call when your shit towed, by the repo. Can't tell your girl so she the center fold. Now you gettin played like Casio's; uuh. Casino's, C-notes and chips like Frito's. Got a free coat, when Costa Rico. Most hoes only know two words. Like ""gimme those"", still buy em tho. Currently ballin' so I gotta letcha know. Flash thru the tint roll the window. Tilt the brim. What the fuck I did, lemme see your registration. I'm a keep it real kid I'm just hatin. Ain't a opportunity I ain't take close chase. City national bank evolve into shape. Of a dollar then I duplicate,. Motherfucker don't believe let me demonstrate. I dream the motherfucker try to kill me in my sleep. What's the point to steak when niggas want beef. Diss me cus they hungry made a meal that you couldn't eat. You f-cken snakes in the rat race 2 face bitches. That's why I don't fuck with none of ya'll niggas. Cus soon ya'll fell when you fell with em. It's like puttin '87 in a Bentley; nigga don't tempt me. [x2:]. Everything ain't everything. Shit ain't always wat it seems. I put that on everything no sleep having light dreams.

lil homie (feat. pharrell),"[Hook: Pharrell]. Lil Homie, everybody tryna get with you. Lil Homie, stay focused, got shit to do!. [Verse 1: Tyga]. They say what don't break a nigga make a nigga. I woke up out my dream, said I gotta get it. This whole city full of thieves, gotta watch my pivot. Cause on the block, niggas never seen good living. Only lived in jail cells or prison. Drive bys, little homies hit the store for liquor. I gotta steer my life different, where to begin with?. Mama told me go back to school, I said I'm finished. There's only one way a nigga gonna learn:. You gotta take risks and do things the hard way. Stole the hall pass, now I'm running through the hallways. Only thing in my memory from those days. You couldn't save a nigga, even on a Sunday. Monday, new day, shit still the same. Gotta switch the rhythm up like Kwame. When things changed, watch people do the same. As I hear a voice sing:. [Hook]. [Verse 2: Tyga]. Big boy grown, can't leave the streets alone. Wanna be a king, but you're too young for the throne. Why you riding in the car that you can't afford?. Can't move forward in the 4-door chrome. All that cheap talk I never did. My walk is Billie Jean, my shoes are never slip. Notice how close he is, gold his goals that approachin' him. They can't stop the win losing's not an option. First place locked in, get my trophy ready bitch. Turn your back on me only gon' leave you ?. Fuck that bullshit I got common sense. I'm ready for my limelight put my mic in hand. They'll dissolve when the money's gone. So motherfucka don't appear when the money's home. Lil' homie done grew into a big dog. If you barking in my way you gettin' chewed on. [Hook]. [Bridge: Pharrell + Tyga]. See your friends walking up and down your block. Ain't got a penny-nenny-nenny-nenny. Just picture yourself sittin' there on top. A nigga straight winnin-in-in-in-in-in-in. Nigga straight winnin', you see how I did it. Bottom to the top take 'em back to the beginnin'. All my niggas winnin', you see how we did it. Dreamt it now we live it. Now we all winnin', me and my. [Hook]"

love game,"[Hook]. The days go by, we argue all the time. I want to make it right, 'cause that was last night. Baby we gon' be alright, baby we gon' be alright. Yea yea love was the mark, bullets to your heart. I want to move on but my feelings too strong. I don't wanna waste time, I don't wanna waste time. [Verse 1]. Man I know we ain't finished when it's barely beginning. All the time I done put in, I put in but time was ending. So silly chasing a feeling, figured you felt different. But so many, so many girls but I just stay with ya. See love wasn't my intention. Rather play Dominoes. Count money with my niggas, shoot dice. Give me seven, rolling off the gate, I hit it twice. Black Eyed Peas, money baby, it's gon' be a good night. And when I said I love you I fuckin' meant it. And we ain't gotta bring your moms and your sister in it. House too big, they all trying to spend the night. You always inviting them and I don't need to be liking it. At all, and I don't need to say shit. 'Cause I just like to see you happy even when you faking it. So flagrant you foul ass bitch, man I hate you. I hope we can make up in the A.M. [Hook]. 'Cause the days go by, we argue all the time. I want to make it right, 'cause that was last night. Baby we gon' be alright, baby we gon' be alright. Yea yea love was the mark, bullets to your heart. I want to move on but my feelings too strong. I don't wanna waste time, I don't wanna waste time. It's like we're in a love game, love game. Love game, love game. Yea, yea, yea, yea. It's like we're in a love game, love game. Love game, love game. Yea, yea, yea, yea. [Verse 2]. Uhh, for every last king need a queen. If you love me now then forever hold this ring. Hold me down, defend it; hold me down, no witness. You always got so much pride but once you look in my eyes. It's over, you even told me about you when you was younger. How your father abused you, I let you cry on my shoulder. No tissue, just short sleeve, tears see-through. Our lives equal, thinking what you been through. Uhh, yo Genie here. Yea I grant you every wish. Put you in environments, good company success. Already set, you going with the best. I know I lied before but trust me I ain't like your ex. Sex so good, break up then break a sweat. We should stay together, then we fight again. Same old shit, different location. Feeling like my time wasted. [Hook]. 'Cause the days go by, we argue all the time. I want to make it right, 'cause that was last night. Baby we gon' be alright, baby we gon' be alright. Yea yea love was the mark, bullets to your heart. I want to move on but my feelings too strong. I don't wanna waste time, I don't wanna waste time. It's like we're in a love game, love game. Love game, love game. Yea, yea, yea, yea. It's like we're in a love game, love game. Love game, love game. Yea, yea, yea, yea. [Verse 3]. Trying to forget someone that you love. Like trying to remember someone that you never knew. Think about it, I dream about it. My nightmares haunting me, I can't sleep about it. Anxiety, can't breathe, can't live without you. The revival, all these verses is my survival. Standing at the poly and waiting for your arrival. One day but no return. Like Usher say, gotta let it burn. [Outro]. The hardest part of dreaming about someone you love. Is waking up to see that person gone. You know it, it it takes seconds to say hello. It takes forever to say goodbye. Moving on is easy, but what you leave behind. Is what makes it hard‚Ä¶. [By:ludias]"

Got shit to lose, then she with whatever. Always out of town, she my distant lover. Only pull in driveways with tints and better. Gold rims, we ghetto, on the chase for cheddar.

I put rhymes on the beat, T-Rawws on the feet. Don? t hate me? cause I? m where you wanna be. I do mostly what the minimum do. So my girls might be yours times 22. Ride 22 2? s and I chunk up the deuce. Everything great like a nigga Babe Ruth. Translucent roof, but her dress seem through. She just tryna make it, guess you gotta do what you gotta do.

reminded (feat. adele),"She said if you love me let me know. If you don't then let me go. [Tyga - verse 1]. The memories soon fade, why couldn't they be erased. You hoping it's just a phase, your heart'll heal within days. Some people think it's wrong, being single isn't right. But you hurt the right person you'll be wrong all your life. Inevitable to let you go, separate the sexual. Feelings when I'm close to you, f-cking til' the sky is blue. Morning time, home fries, cooking with your t-shirt on. Panties, bra, damn I eat you good when you take it off. Ha, damn I'm nasty, I mean you make me nasty. Going the extra mile flying just to make me happy. Did it all, too much wasn't enough. Now it's gone but sometimes I sit and hope. [Adele]. I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded. I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited. But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded. I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited. But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. [Tyga - verse 2]. Whatever ever happened to love and being happy. Infatuated with lust, I loved you and now I'm backwards. Time is of the essence, I broke it, took it for granted. Love is like art, heartbroken on the canvas. Painted the perfect picture, you seemed to never get it. Colors prevail and you turn into a f-cking monster. Schizophrenic, nicknames Bonnie and Clyde. Now doctors calling us Mr. and Mrs. Hyde. How do you manage but still do you. Can't compromise, we all equal opportunists. It's when I'm level headed they aiming to take my head off. Birds flock together, tell bitches I'm throwing bread off. Cold, women, fall in love getting splintered?. Strictly plutonic, only thing she want is dinner. I can't fuck with her, get her some tonic, gin, liquor. She might let me lick her, now she miss me sayin. [Adele]. I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded. I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited. But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded. I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited. But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. [Tyga]. Angels in the a.m., sin on my flesh. Girls in the p.m., excuses PMS. They all wanna love em, call em Ms. Next. Spirit of a hustler, I only chase checks. Go home. I ain't tryna do you wrong. I'd rather be alone. Just sittin on the throne"

'Bout the size of a Complex magazine. I'm not for sale, I bought your dreams. Leonardo Davinci, the Bentley boost my self-esteem. Bitches cling like the chain. already been doing the same thing. I mean this gold [?]. I'm tryna bob and weave, why you chasing me?. I'm on my victory lap, can't you see?. [Outro]. Temple to the brain from the Tec.
