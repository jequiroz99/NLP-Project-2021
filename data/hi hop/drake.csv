emotionless,You've got me feeling emotions. Higher than the heavens above. You've got me feeling emotions. Higher than the heavens above. Don't link me. Don't hit me when you hear this. And tell me your favorite song. Don't tell me how you knew. It would be like this all along. I know the truth is you won't love me. Until I'm gone. And even then the thing. That comes after is movin' on. I can't even capture the feeling. I had it first. Meeting all my heroes. Like seeing how magic works. The people I looked up. Are to going from bad to worse. Their actions out of character even. When they rehearse. Working in the land of the free. The home and the brave. I gotta bring my brothers. Or else I feel out of place. Breakin' speed records on roads. That these niggas paved. And they don't like. That it's written all on they face. Ion't know how I'ma make it out of here clean. Can't even keep track of who plays. For the other team. Iconic duos rip and split at the seams. Good hearted people are takin' it too extremes. Leavin' me. And limbo to question what I believe. Leavin' me to ask. What's their motive and makin' peace. Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet. Leavin' me to ask is there anybody like me?. You've got me feeling emotions. Higher than the heavens above. Missing out on my years. It's time when I wish I was where I was. Back when I used to wish I was here. Missing out on my days. Scrolling through life and fishing for praise. Opinions from total strangers. Take me out of my ways. I'm tryna see who's there on the other end. Of the shade. Most times it's just somebody's that's underage. That's prolly just alone and afraid. Most times it's just somebody that's underage. That's probably just alone and afraid. And lashin' out so that someone else. Can feel they pain. I always hear people complain. About the place they live. That all the people here fake. And they got nothin' to give. 'cause they been starin'. At somebody else's version of shit. That makes another city. Seem more exciting than it is. I know a girl who's one goal was to visit rome. Then she finally got to rome. And all she did was post pictures. For people at home. 'cause all that mattered was impressin'. Everybody she's known. I know another girl that's cryin' out. For help but her latest caption is. Leave me alone. I know a girl happily married. 'til she puts down her phone. I know a girl that saves pictures. From places that she's flown. To post later. And make it look like she still on the go. Look at the way we live. I wasn't hiding my kid from the world. I was hiding the world from my kid. From empty souls who just wake up. And looked the debate. Until you starin'. At your seat you can never relate. Breakin' news in my life. I don't run to the blogs. The only ones I wanna tell are the ones. I can call. They always ask. Why let the story run if it's false?. You know a wise man once said nothin' at all. I'm exhausted and drained I can't even pretend. All these people takin' miles. When you give 'em an inch. All these followers. But who gon' follow me to the end. I guess I'll make it to the end. And I'ma find out then. You've got me feeling emotions. Higher than the heavens above

To tell me things. Seems like they're just happier than us these days. Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you. I don't know how to be there when you need me.

elevate,"Elevate, elevate. Only obligation is to tell it straight. So much on my plate I gotta delegate. Baka pass a drug test, we gotta celebrate. I'm in better weight. Thinking how I make all this happen. For myself and my family. All this happen for myself and my family. There's no way that this is real. Man, it can't be. Yeah, yeah. If you need me, you can call me. I stay busy making money. You know what is on my mind. All I think about is hunnids. I stay busy working on me, homie. I stay busy with my business, homie. I already hit her when you left her lonely. She is not the type. That likes to take things slowly. Slowly, my mouth is going off. I don't know patience. I got a chance. Then my niggas got it too like it's contagious. See the future when I get wavy (wavy [?] ). But I couldn't picture being champagne. When I would buy that shit. And save it for the right occasion. I couldn't picture changes. When I was with ms. craten. That lady hates me. Couldn't picture wifing braden. When I was pumping gas on road trips. To go from cincinnati on to dayton. I couldn't gage it. I wanna thank god. For working way harder than satan. He's playing favorites"

Imagine how I feel to watch another nigga at the top. You know that if it wasn't you. You would be dissin' you, dawg. Damn, okay, from that perspective. I can see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften it. Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at. But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all. Maybe I keep movin' forward. And they just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all. But when they need a favor, who do they call?. Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems. Askin' what was said and who was involved. Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong. They say the shoe can always fit. No matter whose foot it's on. These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em. Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough. I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em. Cause if I run in the game in these. Man the seams are splittin'. No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air. Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?. They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care. Bein' humble don't work as much as bein' aware. Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'. We already got spring 2015 poppin'. Pnd droppin', Reps-up P droppin'. Majid Jordan droppin', Ob droppin'. Not to mention me droppin'. Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game. Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names. Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up. And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up. Damn, fuck how I was in the past tense. Ask himself, how do we match up now?. Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better. If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal. [Outro: James Blake] x16. Could it be the way that I'll catch up"

Who you with? What you claim?. I was payin' mama's rent when. was I turning 17. Soda dirty like Diana never clean. My ex asked me, ""Where you movin'? "". I said, ""On to better things"". [Hook]. [Verse 2]. I been in the crib with the phones off. I been at the house taking no calls. I done hit the stride got. my shit goin'. In the six cooking with the wrist motion. Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is. I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year. I could never ever let the streets down. Haven't left the condo for a week now. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo. This that Ovo, that Szn, this that new Toronto. I get boxes of free Jordan like I play. for North Carolina. How much I make off the deal. how the fuck should I know?. All my watches always timeless. you can keep the diamonds. Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds. Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu Davinci. I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City. Man, I told my city I'd be gone till. November then November came. Then I came, right back on my worst behav'. 6 God, put both hands together. that's amazin' grace. 6 God, selfish with the love. I need all the praise (woo).

30 for 30 freestyle,"[verse: drake]. Never thought I'd be talking from this perspective. But I'm not really sure what else you expected. When the higher-ups. Have all come together as a collective. With conspiracies to end my run. And send me a message. 40, Did you get the message?. Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it. I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort. But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together. Yeah, not here to fight wars. But niggas wanna talk high scores. Party just dipped off in a white porsche. And I just came from dinner. Where I ate some well done seared scallops. That were to die for. But I got bigger fish to fry. I'm talking bigger shit than you and I. Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losing mine. And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified. Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night. Flying over chattanooga. Out here trying to spread the movement. I just got me the mercedes pullman. You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up google. Back in the city, shit is getting brutal. These kids'll hit your noodle. Then take a girl to the movies. They've been dropping out on both sides. We ain't in it, we just ghost ride. The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines. I thought you wanted yours like I want mine. I guess you just making moves on your own time. But just know it'll be january in no time. And your absence is very concerning. It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning. Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30. Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey. I got a club in the raptors arena. Championships, celebrations during regular seasons. Paternity testing for women that I never slept with. I'm legally obligated if they request it. So much legal action like I'm michael jackson. Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction. Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting. Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum. I just listened to closer to my dreams. Wide eyed and uneducated at 19. I can't rap like that, all young and naive. Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe. Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience. I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it. 4, 000 Square feet just isn't as spacious. You loved me back in the basement. Guess it is what we make it. I'm tired of awkward exchanges. And nigga's crooked ways. Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away. Peyton and eli when niggas. Called me they brother the season start. And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing. Y'all throw the word ""family"". Around too much in discussion. Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming. They knees give out. And they passing to you all of a sudden. Now you the one getting buckets. They put their arm around you. Now you becoming the crutches. Kids got on your number. Cause you the one they look up to. And women that you seen on tv look better in person. And either they wanna fuck you or convince you. That they can to see where it goes from there. But these ain't the girls from brampton. This ain't that local action. The haters just bringing me. And my people closer, actually. What happened to the things you niggas said. Was supposed to happen?. Are we just supposed to ignore the fact. That it never happened?. We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?. Supposed to forget your mistakes. But not forget about you?. My plan was always to make. The product jump off the shelf. And treat the money like secrets. Keep that shit to ourselves. Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios. 6 G-o-d, I think I. Was destined for this shit. When I was 'round keyshia cole and t. I. And young dro was popping off with ain't I. Way before niggas had they hands out. Like they doing macarena. But who am I to complain now. I'm still around, they know"

4pm in calabasas,"[Verse]. Bless up. Yeah. All you self promoters are janky. We established like the Yankees. This whole fucking game thank us. We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'. No limit to where I can take it. And you know me as a Cris bottle sender. Check picker upper. I thought we looked out for one another. Saw us all as brothers in the struggle. Too blessed to be humble. I guess it's different in the city I come from. All the sudden I got people showing. how much they truly resent me. They whole demeanor just spells envy. They tryna tempt me. The higher I get, the less they accept me. Even had the Og's tryna press me. Ha-ha-ha-ha. No way out cause I'm already in it. I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket. Good business can clean millions, I got the vision. I been had it since No Scrubs and No Pigeons. Even back when I wasn't as poppin'. When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road. and I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky. I tried to make the right choices with the world watching. ""Mike never tried to rap like Pac. Pac never tried to sing like Mike"". Those my dad's words to me. when I asked him how to make it in life. And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice. Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child. Can't nobody hold me down, especially not right now. Certain shit just too wild to reconcile. Take that, take that no love in they heart. so they fake that. Dicaprio level the way they play that, damn, what is that. Y'all don't hear no songs then hit my phone. like you did that. You either hit my line like where you been at. It's always on some shit like when can I get a favor. Or where my bitch at, like I'm about to tell you. where she been at. Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped. She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry. Green, White and Red on my body. cause I'm dipped in Ferrari. All she wanna do is get high and listen to Party. She complain I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys. My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari. Look now you got me started. I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley. I got a lot to lose cause in every situation. I'm the bigger artist, always gotta play it smarter. Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup. Cameras pointing every time I look up. That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb shoulder. just to hit the Kush up. Sponsorship dollars is sky high. He be like, ""Drake, will you please stop smoking la la? "". Chubbs, why try, I'm a thug, I'mma die high. Got the Rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday. Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance. Yeah, redoin' the entrance. Kinda like when you drop on some again and again shit. And you still never quite get it. Meantime Drizzy over there, tryna make you. Make you dance to this, yeah I make you dance to this. I rode big body, widebody, Calabasas road winder. Sunshinin', waxed tires. See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave. The rest of you boys I blow Keish right in your face. Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep but I'm awake. For that one night you niggas try to reach inside my safe. Don't push me cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays. These guys move so greasy nowadays. I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it. Save my stories for down the line. I'm too ahead of the curve every time. Just total the hits and see what you find. You Swv cause you weak. and I'm always always on your mind. And we can't stop, make you dance to this. I'mma make you One Dance to this. A-ha-ha-ha-ha. Bod breed bod bwoi"
5am in toronto,"Yeah. This on someold Tommy Campos Dice Rawshit. For my niggas, though. You underestimated greatly. Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me. The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me. So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety. I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards. You probably wouldn't lose a single rapper. Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter. Yeah, that's cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga. Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just being Frank with you. I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with you. Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget. Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it. Damn, this shit could go on a tape. Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break. Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook. That's why every song sound like Drake featuring Drake. Tr8, Y pree? Why is it always me?. Got us watchin' our words like there's wire taps on the team. Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas. Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas. For real. Some nobody started feelin' himself. A couple somebodies started killin' themself. A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf. I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help. I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation. Bad press during the summer over allegations. I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money. That's why I ain't got time for a nigga who's time is comin'. A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement. And I'm the only nigga still known for the music. I swear, fuck them niggas this year. I made Forbes list, nigga. Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous. Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans. But if I stay in the shit, there's a bunch of corpses. And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans. Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings. Eat it like I'm seated at Swiss, Sotto, and Joso's. Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Easy and Cocoa. This shit for Kareem, this shit for Jaevon. This shit for Julius, Milly Mill. Boy we do this shit for real. All them boys in my will. All them boys is my Wills. Anything happen to pop and I got you like Uncle Phil. Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill. If anything happen to papi, might pop a nigga for real. Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase. But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates. My weight up, I refuse to wait up, I started a new race. It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe. Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10. Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again. I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryin' to win here again. A young nigga tryin' to win here again. Man, what's up. Yeah. A young nigga tryin' to win here again. If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in. I got her drinkin' with your boy. I got her fucked up, shorty. Aww yeah"

6pm in new york,"Yeah, oh you gotta love it. Oh you got, oh you gotta love it. I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it. I told 1da send me something and I got it covered. Somehow always rise above it. Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?. The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive. Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor. Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested. Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question. Last night I went to sleep, wanted more. Tried to decide what direction I should go towards. Some nights I wish I could go back in life. Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice. 28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me. Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me. Prolly forever if I stay in my zone. I speak on this generation but can't change it alone. I heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in Vibe. Quite a platform you chose, you shoulda kept it inside. Oh you tried, it's so childish calling my name on the world stage. You need to act your age and not your girl's age. It gets worse by the annual my career's like a how to manual. So I guess it's understandable man. Oh you gotta love it, you gotta love it cheer. I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em. To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention. I remember when it used to be music that did it. But then again times have changed man, who are we kiddin'?. I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with. I'd rather give that 15 to people I fuck with. If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'. We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on. But here we are, yeah. Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence. They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments. Bitches alter my message like we have words. And stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve. Bitter women I'm overtextin' are Pmsing crazy this year. Fuckin' with my image. I've been tryna reach to you so I can save 'em this year. Fuck it I guess I gotta wait til next year. And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot. Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block. Nobody lookin' out for nobody. Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody. Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news. So everybody can tweet about it. And then they start to Rip about it. And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it. Damn, I just had to say my peace about it. Oh you gotta love it. But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public. That's a hotter subject. I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget. I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins. Shout out to Ashley, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America. Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again. That's that comeback flow, comeback flow. Once I start it's apparent. I wanted a girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'. But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions. And fuck all the judgement. Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?. Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too. I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas. Bein' number two is just being the first to lose. My city dictated music, nobody seein' us. Winter here already but somehow I'm heatin' up. Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough. Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up. Yea, boy you rappin' like you seen it all. You rappin' like the throne should be the three of ya'll. ""Best I Ever Had"" seems like a decade ago. Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go. Oh please, take at ease, where's the love and the peace. Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?. I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees. And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves. Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease. I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese. Special order for anybody that's comin' for me. Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze. You see they got me back like it's just 40, Oli, and me. Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free. I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat. Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats. Man, oh you gotta love it. And on top of that it's getting harder to eat. Rappers downgrading houses. Putting cars on the lease. To think labels said they had a problem marketing me. And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe. Oh you gotta love it. And head to toe I'm Prada covered. I know your girl well, just not in public. Blame the city, I'm a product of it. Young nigga from the city. You gotta love it"
8 out of 10,"Too rich for who? y'all just got rich again. Who grips the mic. And likes to kill their friends?. I never been the type make amends. If shit was at a eight we like to. We like to. We like to. Yeah, if shit was at a eight. We like to make it a ten. Wonder sent this in, I'm going up all the way. I don't like to talk. When there's nothing left to say. Drizzy by the drop, the game is in disarray. I'd tell you to hear me out. But we both know end of the day. Your sister is pressin' play. Your trainer is pressin' play. Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey. I gotta breathe in real deep. When I catch a attitude. I got a whole 'nother level. That I can tap into. Max said they only bless. When they attached to you. The only dead beats is the beats. I been rappin' to. And the product is still the best though. It's only good in my city 'cause I said so. Just the 50 estate man. I had to cop a feel like presto, voila, tada. Never a matter of could I or should I. Kiss my son on his forehead. And kiss your ass goodbye. As luck would have it. I'm settled into my role as a good guy. I guess luck is on your side. I guess luck is on your side. All sevens, no sixes. Rest easy get some shut eye. Hold on, hold on. But I-- miss makin' 'em pay. Had a path from will smith crib to the stage. Three foreign shows. But I played staples today. The neighborhood is smoked. Y'all stay safe in this place. Drizzy about to drop, the game is in disarray. I'd tell you to hear me out. But we both know end of the day. Your niggas is pressin' play. Your nanny is pressin' play. Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey. Had to go and hit reset, now we here. I been on top for three sets for three years. I can't be around the niggas you minglin' with. I can't fly. If I can't sit on the wing of this shit. Try to pay it less mind. They been keepin' tabs on me. Like I be payin' next time. I think I sense a little feel. From the other side. White vans parked across the street. Real subtle guys. Yeah, never a matter of could I, should I. Kiss my mom on the forehead. Then kiss your ass goodbye. As luck would have it. I'm settled into my role as a good guy. I guess luck is on your side. I guess luck is on your side. All sevens, no sixes. Rest easy get some shut eye. Hold on, hold on. But I-- (haha). But I can't argue with you. No! you mad!. Look at you! you mad!. You big mad! (hahaha). I'm happy!. Leave me alone!. I been holdin' on to something - money. A lot of money. I don't get paid to argue with you. No! who is you?. You ain't nobody. You mad!"
9,"[Intro: Drake]. Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know. Man when shit gets like this, in the whole city. This shit ain't gonna stop. It's gonna get a lot worse before it gets any better. [Verse 1]. Momma hit my phone and said rap's no good. Better than 'em telling me the check's no good. Now they wanna act like I do no good. Funny cause I really did more than I should. I made a decision last night that I would die for it. Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it. Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it. You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it. And I can't sleep these days unless I take one. If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one. Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it. Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it. They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it. Same way, breads gotta break for it. Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now. And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now. I made a decision last night that I would die for it. [Hook]. (Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six). (Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six). (Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six). (Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six). [Verse 2]. All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand. I'mma start telling niggas ""Get it how you can"". I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend. If I ever lose a bet, we never speak again. I made a decision last night that I'd die for it. Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it. First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it. I only drove it five times, paid 1. 5 for it. Keychain go jangalang, I wanna do major things. Mj in every way, I just don't fade away. Six upside down, it's a nine now. Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now. And I made a decision last night that I would die for it. [Hook]. (Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six). (Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six). (Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six).

9am in dallas,"Yeah uh yeah. These are my one St Thomas flows. Me and my n-ggas and some madonna hoes. That look just like virgins but trust they down to go. Discussin' life and all our common goals. Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll. Look how the champagne diamonds flow. Find dining, pour another another glass when the wine is low. Im in the crib stackin' money from here to the ceilin'. Whatever it is I got is clearly appealin'. These other rappers gettin' at it very you feelin. I hope you feel it in your soul spiritual healin'. Take a look at yourself the mirror's revealin'. If you ain't got it you ain't got it the theory is brilliant. People ask how music is goin' I heard it pays. I just came off makin' 2 million in 30 days. Damn I guess it does what the message was. Sometimes I feel I be spendin' my money just because. But weezy im just out here reppin' us. Till I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessin' us. Yeah, I know these n-ggas miss the mean lyrics. Kush got the room smellin' like teen spirit. I asked kindly if no-one out here would bring there feet up. Until I lose for now I'm the game's single leader. I fly private so no-one tells me to bring my seat up. And book a suite when me and your favorite singer meet up. Who you like, tell me who it is. Imma make sure that that women is the next one on my list. I should call it a night but f-ck it I can't resist. This one is for all my n-ggas from my city tryin to diss. Without a responce from me you really fail to exist. And I love to see you fail that feelin' there is the sh-t. I swear, aghh p-ssy n-gga get your bread up. Enjoy the seat that the steward just forced your ass to let up. Why your scary ass lookin' down pick your head up. No-one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous gettup. With nose plugs in now I can smell a set up. So your just wastin your time your just only makin me better. Yeah I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff. Chasin' cash that's my brother from the surf club. Damn that n-gga always kept it so hood. Back when we would smoke good. At the oakwoods. And have girls fall through like coins in a couch. Now we just f-ckin all the b-tches they warned us about. Scared for the first time everything has clicked. What if I dont really do the numbers they predict. Considerin the fact that im the one that they just picked. To write a chapter in history this sh-t has got me sick. But if I really do it dont expect to get a split. Cause this truly is some sh-t I don't expect you all to get. Im nervous but im about to kill it cause they about to let the realist team in. Throwin up in a huddle n-gga Willie beamin. Were still throwin touchdown passes. And tore his frame glasses. Hopin that someone catch it. People say that oh drake we started to miss it. But they need to be a little more specific man is this what yall want?. And my best chris tucker impression. Ducking your questions. F-ck your suggestions. Money gets all of my love and affection. Cars all black like the cover of essence. I'm allergic to comin in second. But I never sneeze. N-gga YMOE n-gga yeeah. Uh, yeah, this want yall want. Octobers Very Own. Young Money. ATF. Thank me later in this b-tch wasssup. Free Weezy in this b-tch wasup. June 15th in this b-tch wasup. by L. Marques"
a little favour (gq freestyle),"Diamonds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished. No love for these bitches I said this year it's all business. It is a shame that a couple of ‘em are off limits. No offence to my nigga, it's just the industry is small. We all lust for the same women. You know the ones we saw before we came in it. I know he aint trippin'. I know I got a couple things that Lil' Wayne dipped in. Aint ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it. This shit is all about hits and misses. The ones that you f-ck and the ones that you wife up. Don't let them fuck your life up. Half a mill to perform, I can't let them fuck that shit up. Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it's lit up. Jim Moore got me dressing like a leading man. A little favour for a friend when I need a hand. Young Frank, suits cut right always. Just got a couple Warhol's for my hallways. New verses crush the hood like I'm driving into something. Bitches on the kid like I'm Iverson of something. Like a Sixer, since I sold 680 in my first. Drizzy Drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse. Swag!"

buried alive interlude,"[Intro]. If you was in a pine box. I would surely break the lock. I’d jump right in and fall asleep. Cause you are the death of me. [Kendrick Lamar]. Looking in the mirror I'm embarrassed. I’m feeling like a suicidal terrorist. React like an infant whenever you are mentioned. Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis. I’m in the matter of man arm wrestling. Hands I was dealt when I said the music business was all I needed. When I got it I was greeted by an alien. That said last year that she slept with a Canadian. That gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz. Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend. My vice is similar women love when you're my type. And you're winning from everything. That your palm write. Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city. Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel. Live the ambiance all cause the audience,. One day said I would do it. So instead of a verse being read. I'mma go and get some head off the strength of my music. I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat. Capitalize That, and your weave look good with the Indian tracks. Tracking device on your used 5 series. I don’t call back just blame it on your Canadian. The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto, hit me on the cellular. Thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know. Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can’t see us. A white waitress on standby when we need her. A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep. No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah. Felt like the initiation,. A reality living in the matrix. We talk casually about the industry. And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making. Then he said that he was the same age as.. myself. And it didn’t help cause it made me even more rude an impatient. So blame it on Mr. OVOXO, the reason why I’m breathing all the vanity I know. The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life. But I live a double life and need to let her go. The reason why, the highlight was when he said:. You belong to the people when you outside. So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame. And bury yourself alive, then I died"
call on me,"They keep askin'. She's not sure at all, she's not. They want a woman who. I thought of how to say this, but she's not here right now. Spendin' all my days on the inside of. Forgettin' who I was on the outside of. You don't need to switch another program right now. Tryna put the power in my own hands right now. I'm about to ride through the old hood right now. See I got too much pride for my own hood right now. Waitin' on you to give in to me, love. So I can fall through like old times. I'm tired but I invited myself. Those nights when you need someone else to hold on. But you can be the one to take control. When I get to you, already know. . Call on me, call on me. Call on me, Birmingham call on me, call on me. Call on me. Call on me, call on me. Call on me. Call on me, call on me. Birmingham call on me, call on me. Call on me. Cause I'll always be there for you. Birmingham call on me.

Never-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face. Never-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face. Y'all fuckin' hilarious. Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up and scarin' us.

I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from. and you have reason to question your anxieties. and how disillusioned you feel. as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe. you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life. and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this. because I'm confident in you. and I know you can reach your. desired destination and accomplish your goals. much more. quickly without this confrontation. I'm hearing in your tone. these days. When others go low, we go high"

club paradise,"They say that all your old girls got somebody new. I said, damn, really?. Even rose mary? even leanne sealy?. They said, fucking right, they were the first to go. It's nothing personal. It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though. They've been saving up. New niggas came around, they been waking up. With I swear, you don't know this city any more. They might have loved you before. But you're out here doing your thing. They don't know you.... Aaaaaahhh, sure they do, they just not as sincere.

I be with my nigga chubs, he in love with street shit. No wonder why I feel awkward at this fashion week shit. No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss. Along for that ignorant young money miami beef shit. Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun. They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come. I'm never scared, they never real, I never run. When all is said and done, more is always said than done. And I was told once, things will change. By a nigga named tip when my deal came. Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange. Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names. Rochelle, jordan. Thick bitches, they just talked me out of 4 grand. How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?. How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?. Damn, my biggest fear is just losing it all. Remember how I used to feel at the start of it. And now I'm living a mothafucking fairy tale. And still trying to keep me feeling a part of it. Yeah, just lie to my ears. Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear. Lights get low, and that's when I have my brightest ideas. And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home. Tell me, who did I leave behind?. You think it got to me, I can just read your mind. You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now. [uh] but believe I remember it all. My mother is back to who she was years ago. It's like a new page me and her are beginning on. I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand. Cause I get new girls I could use her opinion on. She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth. But I never break the promises I made to myself. And I would never make 'em names from myself. Then change the names that I just gave to myself. Certain rappers would call me to say ""what up, though?"". I used to brag about it to my friends. And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat. And maybe that's all they do is just pretend. Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it. Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it. Yeah, so show me love, show me fucking love. Cause I thought it was all I needed. Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along. And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit. They trip off the amount of people that I brought along. But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit. Need credentials for every one of this toronto kids. I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live. I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did. Listen closely to my shit I swear it's sounding like home. Tell me, who did I leave behind?. You think it got to me, I can just read your mind.

I don't even know. What things are looking like. Inside of your place and how it's decorated. This thing is getting one-sided. I can't even lie to you right now. All she talking bout. Is come and see me for once. Come and see me for once. You don't ever come to me. You don't ever come to me. All she hit me with is. Come and see me for once. Come and see me for once.

We can work it out, no Nintendo. I just hit Alt....Tab. Switchin' in-between two convos. I should just call cabs. And bring em both here to the condo (Yeah). Normally, it ain't a question. We would cross paths like an intersection. But she just too far away for affection. So I pray that we never lose the connection. 'Cause I remember Stacy, she probably hate me. She used to threaten she had a man to replace me. She talked that shit, I just hit the escape key. And then she'd get mad and want to go and erase me. I remember Amy, she used to AIM me. She stayed up late, and used to blame me. She say I'm too wild, she wanna tame me. I told her 'Even Photoshop couldn't change me?. But you-you-you You got me open, girl, why lie?. We ain't even tryin' to settle, so why try?. End the night with a kiss and a bye-bye. No strings attached your love is so WiFi. . Girl girl girl girl girl girl.

diplomatic immunity,"Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em. All that peace and that unity. All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah. 'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down. Opinions over statistics, of course. Gassed off journalistic. Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report. Booked a private room at Wylie's, waiter twistin' the cork. I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course. At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course. Girls huggin' me then askin' me, ""What scent that is, boy? "". I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy. Yeah, who am I? The do or die. The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties. They try to compare us, but. Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I. I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride. All factual, I call the house ""the embassy"". The studio ""the chapel"", I hate to travel. I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural. I knew her way back when Hollywood was international. Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends. Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz. Very presidential, I broke all the codes. for zonin' in my residential. I broke spirits that I never meant to. My body isn't much of a sacred temple. with vodka and wine. And sleep at the opposite times. Promise shit is gettin' outta line. like when you make a stencil. Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil. Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles. Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I. I refuse to comply with regulations. I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence. Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions. Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya. Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license. They tell me ""don't worry, I got your money"" like Osirus. (I'm the Osiris of this shit). Dirty 30, workin' on me. Tired of women that may tag me in pictures. airin' my dirty laundry. Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite. Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo. Calamari rings and tomato. I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo. Wakin' up at 6 Pm like, ""Where does the day go? "". Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin'. retaliation at dinner tables. 2010 was when I lost my halo. 2017 I lost a J. Lo. A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though. I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes. Closed off but I could never stay closed. Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños. Black excellence. but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though. all goodie. That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't. Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy. Protection that God gave me. Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies. I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages. I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around. and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers. Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute. to none of this here. Cover my ears, my security government tier. Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits. Check the guest list. If opps make an appearance at least it's expected. Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace. I'll be in better company with my own reflection. Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace. The Tv playin' Al Jazeera. Inshallah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer. Whenever, wherever. Ovo will always be together like Shakira. I love, I love. I love, I love it. Baby, I"

You just turned 21 like Adele, that's good with me. I put my business on hold, let me turn off the phone. Let's explore the unknown. If you not drinking with me you force me to turn up alone. No peer pressure, I just know you like to get in your zone. You say that you'd rather smoke. Well, let me call up Ob's room and tell 'em roll up a cone. I know he probably got that extra special. I never second guess it. How's Villanova? What classes. you taking next semester?. Man, she like ""fuck the small talk"". I'm not here to discuss extra credits or my professors. No time for funny stories. It's funny how she shows up late. but always comes before me. We both young and misguided. but that's another story, yeah. More rest and sex is all a nigga needs.

do not disturb,"Yeah, stylin' though. Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though. All the things you need, you still want problems though. All the things I know, I still been silent though. Yeah, used to be at Silvercity, Indigo. Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes. I don't want to have to go to funerals. I gotta start sleepin' at the studio. I don't have no time to be no Romeo. All the love I need is at the rodeo. All the love I need is here at Ovo, yeah. All the girls I know are there with E and Tho. Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?. Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes. Last table left in Carbone. callin' plays on the rotary phone. I take a glass of Domina to go with me home. Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome. I need 40, 000 people to see what I'm on. Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves. I was an angry yout when I was writin' Views. Saw a side of myself that I just never knew. I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do. Steady doin' double shifts. 1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click. More blessings because I'm generous. Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us. Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet. She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it. Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it. Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it. Scary whenever I close my eyes at night. Wakin' up to public statements about my private life. I can never sleep 'til morning on all my quiet nights. But you can rest assure that my mind is right. Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days. Never stick around to see shit change. Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'. Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'. Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club Liv. To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' bis'. I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this. Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense. Especially people that want to lecture me. And frame it like they just want the best for me. Or they check for me, whatever splits it up. So there's more for them and there's less for me. They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me. No one's done it successfully. 7am in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me. Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery. Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me. That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency. Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally. Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly. If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me. You overnight celebrity, you one day star. Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity. I am a reflection of all of your insecurities. Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping. Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me. There's real ones around me. I want to make sure they learn from me. I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety. He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency. My life is centered 'round competition and currency. Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery. Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me. I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary. More Life"
doing it wrong (featuring stevie wonder),"When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world. It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl. And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting. And it's all because she don't want things to change. So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you. That's the wrong thing to do. Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you. That's the wrong thing to do. Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you. That's the wrong thing to do. Cause you say you love me, and I'll end up lying. And say I love you too. But I need someone different. You know it, oh ho, you know it. Oh ho, you know it, we both know it. I need someone different. You know it, oh ho, you know it. Oh ho, you know it, we both know it. Something's been missing. You know it, oh ho, she knows it. Oh ho, I know it, we all know it. I need someone different. (Oh ho, oh ho). We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together. But we sure make it feel like we're together. Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else. So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you. That's the wrong thing to do. Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you. That's the wrong thing to do. Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you. That's the wrong thing to do. Cause you say you love me, and I'll end up lying. And say I love you too. But I need someone different. You know it, oh ho, you know it. Oh ho, you know it, we both know it. I need someone different. You know it, oh ho, you know it. Oh ho, you know it, we both know it. Something's been missing. You know it, oh ho, she knows it. Oh ho, I know it, we all know it. I need someone different. (Oh ho, oh ho)"
don't matter to me (feat. michael jackson),"Ayy, wild things you're doin' at night. Trips to wherever feels right. Doin' it all just to feel things. Drinking's enough of a vice. Drugs just aren't suiting you right. You were just fine as a real thing, thing. You, you, you know. That's not the way to get over me. I don't know what you're sayin'. You, you, you know. That's not the way to get over me. All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more. All of a sudden you say that I closed the door. It don't matter to me. It don't matter to me what you say. It don't matter to me. It don't matter to me what you say. I can't recover from our last conversation. You called me weak. And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other. You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you. Just to show you I love you. You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations. Despite what you say. Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer. You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down. Stressin' over somethin' (stressin' over somethin'). You, you, you, you, you know. That's not the way to get over me. I don't know what you're sayin'. You, you, you know. That's not the way to get over me. All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more. All of a sudden you say that I closed the door. It don't matter to me. It don't matter to me what you say. It don't matter to me. It don't matter to me what you say. Girl, your love, you think you broke it. I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart. Girl, your love, you think you broke it. I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart"

You know it's real when your niggas will take the fall for you. All loyal so you keep egging me on. And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you. You ain't hard boiled. Last night I tried some raw oysters. Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit. That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit. That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written. That boy did it on purpose. That boy know that they shittin' on you. And they can't get past you. You should've followed all my moves. You won't realize 'til after. And if I left shit to chance. I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper. No offense cause I don't know that nigga. I'm focused on makin' records and gettin' bigger. Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk. Tell 'em fix my suite up cause I'm comin' home. I heard they talkin' crazy, I was out of town. You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around. But when I'm here, not a sound. That'll make me snap, jot it down. Go in the booth and lay a body down. Know some Somalis that say we got it wallahi. Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby. And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll. Let that man live, they say ""Okay if you say so"". See whatever I say goes. I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco. No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though. I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow. We all do it for the art so I can never hate though. Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer. With a heavy case load. How the game turn into the Drake show?. Dog, what the fuck happen to so and so, where did they go?. They too worried 'bout bitches and fashion. They go missin' in action. And then you never notice they missin'. On some Hunger Games shit I would die for my district. Jennifer Lawrence you can really get it. I mean forreal, girl you know I had to do it for yah. You know I had to do it for yah. You know I had to. Oh wait sidebar, left some beat at the end. So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it. And get your lies off. Draft day, Johnny Manziel.

Tryna fill the shoes, nigga so far these are empty. I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi. Ohh, I never seen the car you claim to drive. Shit I seen it, you just aint inside. And I feel like lately I went from top 5 to remaining 5. My favourite rappers either lost it or they aint alive. And they tryna bring us down me, Weezy and Stunna. We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer. And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass. Then I?ll probably give her my number. Yeah, I throw my dollars up high. And they land on the stage you dance on. We got company coming over. Would it kill you to put some pants on. Dreams money can buy. They told me it's like a high, it wasnt a lie. Yeah, just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga. And fuck whoever hatin? on a nigga. Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me.

duppy freestyle,"I'm in shock. The nerve, the audacity. Okay. So if you rebuke me for workin'. with someone else on a couple of Vs. What do you really think of the nigga. that's makin' your beats?. I've done things for him I thought that he never would need. Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me. I pop style for 30 hours, then let him repeat. Now, you poppin' up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep. I just left from over by y'all puttin' pen to the sheets. Tired of sittin' quiet, and helpin' my enemies eat. Keep gettin' temperature checks. They know that my head overheats. Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve. Must've had your Infrared wrong. now your head in the beam. Y'all are the spittin' image of whatever jealousy breeds. Don't push me when I'm in album mode. You not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes. You send shots, well, I got to challenge those. But I bring Calicos to the Alamo. I could never have a Virgil in my circle. and hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous. I wanna see my brothers flourish to their higher purpose. You niggas leeches and serpents. I think it's good that now the teachers are learnin', yeah. Your brother said, it was your cousin then him, then you. So, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew. Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do. There's no malice in your heart. you're an approachable dude. Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike & Mercedes. But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s. I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded. I think that pretty much resembles. what's been happenin' lately. Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah. And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times. Nigga was at Kroger workin' double time. Y'all actin' like he made the boy. when I was tryna help the guy. Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?. Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs. Whoever supposedly makin' me hits. but then got no hits sound like they need me. My hooks did it, my lyrics did it, my spirit did it. I'm fearless with it, yeah. I really shouldn't have given you none of my time. 'Cause you older than the nigga you runnin' behind. Look, holla at me when you multi-million. I told you keep playin' with my name. and I'ma let it ring on you. Like Virginia Williams. I'm too resilient, get out your feelin's. It's gonna be a cruel summer for you. I told Weezy and Baby, ""I'ma done him for you"". Tell 'Ye, ""We got a invoice comin' to you"". Considerin' that we just sold another 20 for you. To be honest. Duppy"
easy to please (ft. richie sosa),"[Drake]. Yeah, look.... Me and sos? we from two different walks of life. Usually we understand theres a problem we don't talk to vice. The watch is yellowy-green thas sum awkward ice. I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice. I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write. Spyin no talent rappers to get off the mic. And I could pick you up from work when you get off the night. Drop you at the house soon as you get off the pike, man. I flow so cool like autumn nights. When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light. But don't try and tell me that a dolphins white. Mislead drake that is not at all polite. It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes. Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows. Bet I get a co-sign somethin like no time. They'll be trynna sub a nigga in like quizno's. [chorus: sos & drake]. All I need is sum weight, my scale, sum money for bail. A lil booth at the club for the whole cartel. Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on e. And somethin heavy on my waist man I'm easy to please. I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua. The whole atf you kno who we are... My women, my money, and leave me the keys. Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please"
elevate,"Elevate, elevate. Only obligation is to tell it straight. So much on my plate I gotta delegate. Baka pass a drug test, we gotta celebrate. I'm in better weight. Thinking how I make all this happen. For myself and my family. All this happen for myself and my family. There's no way that this is real. Man, it can't be. Yeah, yeah. If you need me, you can call me. I stay busy making money. You know what is on my mind. All I think about is hunnids. I stay busy working on me, homie. I stay busy with my business, homie. I already hit her when you left her lonely. She is not the type. That likes to take things slowly. Slowly, my mouth is going off. I don't know patience. I got a chance. Then my niggas got it too like it's contagious. See the future when I get wavy (wavy [?] ). But I couldn't picture being champagne. When I would buy that shit. And save it for the right occasion. I couldn't picture changes. When I was with ms. craten. That lady hates me. Couldn't picture wifing braden. When I was pumping gas on road trips. To go from cincinnati on to dayton. I couldn't gage it. I wanna thank god. For working way harder than satan. He's playing favorites"
emotionless,You've got me feeling emotions. Higher than the heavens above. You've got me feeling emotions. Higher than the heavens above. Don't link me. Don't hit me when you hear this. And tell me your favorite song. Don't tell me how you knew. It would be like this all along. I know the truth is you won't love me. Until I'm gone. And even then the thing. That comes after is movin' on. I can't even capture the feeling. I had it first. Meeting all my heroes. Like seeing how magic works. The people I looked up. Are to going from bad to worse. Their actions out of character even. When they rehearse. Working in the land of the free. The home and the brave. I gotta bring my brothers. Or else I feel out of place. Breakin' speed records on roads. That these niggas paved. And they don't like. That it's written all on they face. Ion't know how I'ma make it out of here clean. Can't even keep track of who plays. For the other team. Iconic duos rip and split at the seams. Good hearted people are takin' it too extremes. Leavin' me. And limbo to question what I believe. Leavin' me to ask. What's their motive and makin' peace. Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet. Leavin' me to ask is there anybody like me?. You've got me feeling emotions. Higher than the heavens above. Missing out on my years. It's time when I wish I was where I was. Back when I used to wish I was here. Missing out on my days. Scrolling through life and fishing for praise. Opinions from total strangers. Take me out of my ways. I'm tryna see who's there on the other end. Of the shade. Most times it's just somebody's that's underage. That's prolly just alone and afraid. Most times it's just somebody that's underage. That's probably just alone and afraid. And lashin' out so that someone else. Can feel they pain. I always hear people complain. About the place they live. That all the people here fake. And they got nothin' to give. 'cause they been starin'. At somebody else's version of shit. That makes another city. Seem more exciting than it is. I know a girl who's one goal was to visit rome. Then she finally got to rome. And all she did was post pictures. For people at home. 'cause all that mattered was impressin'. Everybody she's known. I know another girl that's cryin' out. For help but her latest caption is. Leave me alone. I know a girl happily married. 'til she puts down her phone. I know a girl that saves pictures. From places that she's flown. To post later. And make it look like she still on the go. Look at the way we live. I wasn't hiding my kid from the world. I was hiding the world from my kid. From empty souls who just wake up. And looked the debate. Until you starin'. At your seat you can never relate. Breakin' news in my life. I don't run to the blogs. The only ones I wanna tell are the ones. I can call. They always ask. Why let the story run if it's false?. You know a wise man once said nothin' at all. I'm exhausted and drained I can't even pretend. All these people takin' miles. When you give 'em an inch. All these followers. But who gon' follow me to the end. I guess I'll make it to the end. And I'ma find out then. You've got me feeling emotions. Higher than the heavens above

Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy. Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney. Selling under 150 you niggas got to be kidding. Is this even still a discussion?. Don't you ever wake up disgusted?. Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin. And people's feelings have changed ever since I became something. Girls that becoming ladies, and my friends are having babies. And babies are dropping dead in my city, this shit is crazy. And I don't know if speaking on it helps.

extra special,"Southern smoke!!!. [speaking]. Yeah. ho!. It's drake. uh uh. ho!. Do that dance. do that dance. [chorus:]. You special girl, don't leave me baby. To find another just like you won't be easy baby. So, at least I know where the ones at. Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back. [verse 1:]. Look I ought to be thankful because for women. I have plenty of love. And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck. Look at 50 you make love, 30 you have sex. Somewhere around the tender age of 20 you fuck. Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score. It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car. Instead these girls taking it raw,. Now they tell you to do whatever you want. because it's safe to explore. Forget, wait till it's right now, wait till it's more. Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour. So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me. To the point that drake compare me to anthony mackie. But once they have my pants and my khakis. I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly. Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame. And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change. [chorus: (x2)].

I want to get straight to the climax. Have you coming all summer like a season pass. I want to turn you out like pitch black. Want to watch you do work while I sit back.

Nails done, hair done, everything d?. Oh you fancy huh. [Drake]. You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile. In the bathroom flat irons and nail files. Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles. In the mall steady racking up the air miles. Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number. You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer. And you don't do it for the man, men never notice. You just do it for yourself you're the f-cking coldest. Intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart. I've always liked my women book and street smart. Long as they got a little class like half days. And the confidence to overlook my past ways. Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in. But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in. And look I really think that nobody does it better. I love the way you put it together. [Chorus]. Oh you fancy huh. Oh you fancy huh. Oh you fancy huh. Oh you fancy huh. Nail done, hair done, every thing done. Nails done, hair done, everything d?. Oh you fancy huh. Oh you fancy huh. You you fancy huh. Oh you fancy huh. [T.I.]. Well aren?t you a breath of fresh air. From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here. They get a baller think that they aint got to pick a career. Guess they plan on sucking somes d-cks until some millions appear. Voila! you do it right he might just buy you a car. Unless you play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar. Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar. I say I?m buying you declining I think thats kinda bizarre. Independant with the demeanor of an RnB singer. Make it rain finger (check). M3 beamer (check). Champagne range. Triple white Caddy. Closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags. Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel. D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and Bebe. Ya ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezies. Who fuck for bottles of Riesing or beaus that beg zeebee. [Chorus]. Oh you fancy huh. Oh you fancy huh. Oh you fancy huh. Oh you fancy huh. Nail done, hair done, every thing done.

Go, go, go, go, go, go. As we proceed.. [Drake]. Uh, 5 and a half in boys. Ass is off the hook. Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot. And when I find it is when I find you. And we can do hte things we never got the time to. Better late than never. But never late is better. They tell me time is money, well we?ll spend it together. I'm down for whatever. You just lead the way. We go to dinner you don?t even look at me to pay. Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me. And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley. How she got it I aint never get to ask. I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash. Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners. The girls that got diplomas. And enough money to loan us a little something extra. Should we ever need it. If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it. [Chorus]. Oh you fancy huh. Oh you fancy huh. Oh you fancy huh. Oh you fancy huh. Nail done, hair done, every thing done. Nails done, hair done, everything d?. Oh you fancy huh. Oh you fancy huh. You you fancy huh. Oh you fancy huh"
fear,"DRAKE - Fear. Drake talking:. This is why i do this shit.. I think they call this, uhm, venting.. Verse 1:. Yea. Look. Uhh.. This is me.. Still the same.. They want the hits.. I play the game.. No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.. It all comes spilling out like i hit a vein.. Watt up lil bra.. Watt up slum ville.. I hope you know that y'all the reason i have fun still.. The fans thinking that we all signed for one meal.. Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.. That ain't how it works.. That ain't that how it goes.. And i been getting high to balance out the lows.. And i could use a writer to balance my flows.. But i never share my thoughts,. This is all a nigga knows.. And every time i try, it opens up my eyes.. These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised.. And i would be performing just as long as i'm alive.. So every word i utter will be mine.. Chorus:. Don't believe the lies.. Look me in my eyes.. Please don't be scared of me.. Please don't be scared of me.. I remember you.. This feeling isn't new.. So please don't be scared of me.. Please don't be scared of me.. . Verse 2:. (Dont Take This The Wrong Way But ugh). I never cried when pac died.. But i probably will when hov does.. And if my tears hold value, then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us.. And i'll be standing in a puddle.. I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.. And i'ma keep it honest.. I am so tired of being subtle.. It's just me, forty, o, and nich standing in a huddle.. Staring at the members of my team.. Who get questioned about they profit from this from million dollar scheme.. Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams.. I hope you tell your family this shit aint what it seems.. But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion.. You know i spend money because spending time is hopeless.. And know i pop bottles cuz i bottle my emotions.. At least i put it all in the open.. Chorus:. Don't believe the lies.. Look me in my eyes.. Please don't be scared of me.. Please don't be scared of me.. I remember you.. This feeling isn't new.. So please don't be scared of me.. Please don't be scared of me.. Oh oh oh oh oh uhh.. Verse 3:. Look.. Fuck all y'all.. We ignore feelins here.. Premature millionaires.. Welcome to my realest year.. Yeah.. I swear that we're making a killin here.. I should be on top of the world just chillen here.. Uh.. But it's funny having fans.. Who find you before anybody ever has the chance, and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.. And realize when you ain't there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same.. Yeah.. And plus things are just so real at home. People think i've changed just as my appilla's grown. And now security follow me everywhere so i'm never actually am alone, i just always feel alone.. I think i'm scared of what the future holds.. I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.. Every girl i meet thinks i'm fucking groupie hoes.. The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.. All my old friends think i got a new crowd.. And people seem to notice every time i do smile.. I guess that mean they come few and far between.. Even though am living out what you would call the dream.. Yeah.. And my uncle aint even messaging me.. And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.. I hope this isn't one of those forever things.. It's funny how money can change everything.. Chorus:. Don't believe the lies.. Look me in my eyes.. Please don't be scared of me.. Please don't be scared of me.. I remember you.. This feeling isn't new.. So please don't be scared of me.. Please don't be scared of me.. Oh oh oh oh oh uhh.. Drake by FPEEZY."

fireworks,"[Drake - Verse 1]. Money just changed everything. I wonder how life without it would go. From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow. Lookin' down from the top and it's crowded below. My fifteen minutes started an hour ago. Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh-t. When I hear talkin, I just don't know what to make of it. Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it. Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit. Yeah, and my dreams who I'm racing with. You can see I'm pacin it so that I'm always chasin it. Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with. I hope that my success never alters our relationship. Yeah, this life is something I would die for. Octobers Own, but it's lookin like July 4th. But I just wish they'd let you try it first. This time I'm really goin off, fireworks. [Alicia Keys - Chorus]. When I go off like July 4th. Feels like a fire, got to go higher. It's your revelation my sweet celebration. Light me like a rocket, cause nothing can stop it. All I see is fireworks,. All I see is fireworks. Every night it's fireworks. Every night it's fireworks. All I see is fireworks. Taking off like fireworks. Taking off like fireworks. [Verse 2]. I got this one girl, you know, in my life. So I say in this song, I say. I'm just such a gentleman. You should give it up for me. Look at how I'm placing al my napkins and my cutlery. I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you f-ck with me. Who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me. Yeh, I kept my wits about me luckilly. What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me. Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me. And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me. But I was curious and I'll never forget it baby. What an experience. You coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious. There was smoke in the air before now it's me cleaning it. That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though. You never see it coming you just get to see it go. Yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first. Now I see it in her eyes. Fireworks!. [Verse 3]. Everything the same but it feels different. My dad called me up knowing that I still listen. And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'. It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it. For real, me and my Realtor we built up a better rapport. Got my mother in a place with some better decor. She searched the entire city I let her explore. And now she's sayin' she's more lonely than ever before. How many of our parents' marriages lasted?. I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted. I'm flying back home for the heritage classic. Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?. Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts. I want to witness love, I've never seen it close. Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first, that's why. I'm really going off. Fireworks!. [Chorus]. Crédito: Nathaly Bruna"

from time (feat. jhene aiko),"[Intro: Jhene Aiko]. What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it. you've been caught up. With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love. You shouldn't have to deal with that. I'd never make you feel like that. Cause. [Hook: Jhene Aiko]. I love me, I love me enough for the both of us. That's why you trust me. I know you been through more than most of us. So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?. Darling you, you give but you cannot take love. [Verse 1]. I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive. Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance. I look around the peers that surround me. these niggas tripping. I like when money makes a difference. but don't make you different. Started realizing a couple places I can take it. I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement. I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation. And influence a generation that's lacking in patience. I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience. Just me and my old man getting back to basics. We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted. When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing. Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas. We might have rolled a white paper. just something to hold us. We even talked about you and our couple of moments. He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups. You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone. Looking like you came from the 70's on your own. My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is. Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?. Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore. I search for something I'm missing and disappear. when I'm bored. But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?. Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah?. [Hook]. I love me, I love me enough for the both of us. That's why you trust me. I know you been through more than most of us. So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?. Darling you, you give but you cannot take love. [Verse 2]. Thinking 'bout Texas. back when Porsche used to work at Treasures. Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage. When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit. A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it. Cause that night I played her three songs. Then we talked about something we disagreed on. Then she started telling me. how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz. Boy was she wrong. that was just negative energy for me to feed off. Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria. Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria. Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music. When I could tell it was. Sincere without trying to prove it. The one that I needed was Kourtney. from Hooters on P Street. I've always been feeling. like she was the piece to complete me. Now she engaged to be married. what's the rush on commitment?. Know we were going through some shit. name a couple that isn't. Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz. Girl I thought we had it all planned out. guess I fucked up the vision. Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions. When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven. It seems like you don't want this love anymore. I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore. But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?. Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?. [Hook]. I love me, I love me enough for the both of us. That's why you trust me. I know you been through more than most of us. So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?. Darling you, you give but you cannot take love. [Outro]. I been a East Side ting, Scarborough ting from time. G, been have up di ting dem from time. G. So I don't know what's wrong with these. lil waste mans out here, y'all need to know yourself"
furthest thing,"[Verse 1]. Somewhere between psychotic and iconic. Somewhere between I want it and I got it. Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted. Somewhere between a mistress and commitment. But I stay down, girl I always stay down. Get down, have her lay down. Promise to break everybody off before I break down. Everyone just wait now. So much on my plate now. People I believed in they don't even show they face now. What they got to say now?. Nothin' they can say now. Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now. What more can I say now?. What more can I say now?. You might feel like nothin' was the same. [Hook] x2. I still been drinkin' on the low. Mobbin' on the low. Fuckin' on the low. Smokin' on the low. I still been plottin' on the low. Schemin' on the low. The furthest thing from perfect. Like everyone I know. [Verse 2]. And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya. Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya. You know that paper my passion. Bittersweet celebrations. I know I can't change what happened. I can't help it. I can't help it. I was young and I was selfish. I made every woman feel like she was mine. and no one else's. And now you hate me. Stop pretendin', stop that frontin'. I can't take it. Girl don't treat me like a stranger. Girl you know I seen ya naked. Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender. Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together. You know I stay remniscin'. And makeup sex is tradition. But you been missin' girl. And you might feel like nothin' was the same. [Hook]. [Bridge]. Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'. Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money. Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin', schemin'. Plottin', schemin', gettin' money. [Verse 3]. This the life for me. My momma told me this was right for me. I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me. I should have Spoons, serve you up. with a fork and knife for me. Your actions make us doubt you. Your lack of effort got me rappin' different. This the shit I wanna go out to. Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'. Naked women swimmin' that's just how I'm livin'. Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'. A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?. I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up. Yours truly the boy. I just build and build more. Y'all niggas build to destroy. Y'all niggas party too much, man I just chill and record. No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before. Yes Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to. This the shit I wanna go out to"

give ya (ft. trey songz),"[Verse 1: Drake]. Check, look. And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you. Do me a favor, tell me what's happenin'. I am drinkin' XO, D is sippin' some Appleton. Usually the things I desire I always apprehend. Back again, return of the mack again. ""Deceiving"" was cool, I'll never record the track again. Even though my ex is fuckin one of my rappa friends. I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally. You can stop frontin' you know you heard of me. Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me... little me. Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be. One of the best decisions you've made. I'm sunnin' them all, I live in the shade. Previously mischievious behavior was the leader of me. You could say I was fresh to some conceited to degree. Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be. But now I need a culprit. I am talkin Long Sands Beach, kinda adult shit. I am talkin all day shoppin sprees in the mall. With friends that I ball with. Hear me: Trey's girl go and get me some Fall shit. Sweetie I am a track's demise, I will kill this song til it actually dies. With military jacket and some pack supplies. I won't say I'm the best til the stats arrive. At all these a-list parties you fratranize. Where you can't wear hats inside only slacks and ties. Bu you don't never act surprised. You just hold it down for your boy til the plaques arrive. And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint. Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint. I gave up a lot to make a progress. I give it to you, and you take it the best. [Chorus:]. When I give ya what I give ya. (You gon like that).

Play me I'll visit ya, lay ya in critical condition. So don't get it twisted nigga. But back to the pimpin nigga. Intercontinental you can catch me laid up. Somethin with a fly face, slim face, big butt. That's why I love what I does. Shot a couple videos, now we got the city froze. Somethin like my wrist be, niggas know how dis shit be. Step to the club, security never frisk me. Buy so much liquor, dey give us a couple sips free. I be on Henessy, straight no cubes. Take me where the women be, I won't lose. Drake take Patron to the face til he wasted. I'm blowin til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix. All me Mister Anderson huh I'm ramblin. But at the same time, I'm spittin a flame rhyme. Baby what's you're name, hey call me the game mind. Most valuable player baby listen it's gametime. We could take a couple shots, break down ya d'z. Take it to the hole, post up on me. Let me feel the arena, I'll be Gilbert Arenas. Somethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya. [Chorus:]. When I give ya what I give ya. (You gon like that). When I give ya what I give ya.

And when I give ya what I give ya. [Verse 3:]. Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay. Fresh up on the scene. Big blunt full of green. Fitted to the back, 'Ginia be on the map. Virginia on the back of the hat while I mack. Ay shawty you phat and I love that. Big stage, and I holla ""where dem thugs at? "". Fellaz hit me and they holla ""where the drugs at? "".

I hate a goofy especially. They always dying to mention me. They got to go, they got to go. They gotta doubt eventually. I cannot give them no empathy. I'mma have [?] when I'm at 70. They cannot fuck with my legacy. I don't know what else is left for me. After this there's no one trying me. My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies. I don't let it get to me. [Hook: Drake]. Done. Look what I've done in my life. I had to count it and count it again. To make sure the money right now. They love to talk. Me, I'm just done in the hype. Me, I'm just done in the hype. Me I'm just done, done, done, done"

Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill. Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great. Even though I out on bond. I might be facin' 8's. Still running with the same niggas til the death of me. Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully. Ever made love to the woman of your dreams.

Tunechi be the name, don't ask me how I got it. I'm killin' these hoes. I swear I'm tryna stop the violence. All I care about is money and the city that I'm from.

is there more,"Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain. Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon. Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest. Only problems I do are math problems with profit. Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics. Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it. Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses. Only rest that I do is ""where the rest of my commas? "". Still I rise, maya angelou vibes. When life comin' at you from all angles and sides. And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside. It really boils down to how you plan to survive. Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em. Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?. Especially when another girl. I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom. And they recognize the bathroom. All hell starts to break loose in my texts. I only tell lies to who I gotta protect. I would rather have you remember me how we met. I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect. But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step. That ain't what I'm 'bout. I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt. If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without. They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without. Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house. My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the south. Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?. Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?. Is there more? yeah. Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice. The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth. Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot. Too many walt disney characters, mouses and goofs. I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?. I'll let you bring a thousand recruits. My peers are a talented group. But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two. Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops. There's still nothin' they could really do. It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due. Whenever it's time to recoup. Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal. In the house playin' d'angelo, ""how does it feel? "". I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die. What you got, time on your hands or time on your side?. Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?. Is there more to life than goin' on trips to dubai?. Yachts on the 4th of july, g5 soarin' the skies. Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties. And all of these fortunate times. And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?. Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?. Like healin' my soul, like family time. Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?. Is there more?. Passion, instant. Sweat beads, feel me (feel me). Cupid's shot me. My heartbeat's racing (my heartbeat's racing). Tempt me, drive me (tempt me). Feels so exciting. Thought of highly (highly). It's yours entirely. I'll be, I'll be more than a lover. More than a woman. More than your lover for you"

I needa know how new nigga you got. Does the same thing I do. For a living but is way less wavy. How you even managin' to keep straight faces. In all the pcitures that I seen lately. Lord knows you still look amazing. That's besides the point I'm making. You're way too opinionated. Have to force it, have to fake it. You have potential, I could've shaped it. You went and caved in. We could've waited. I wasn't rushing. Differences in ages. You're old enough, but you're still a baby. You've shared stories where you did amazin'. Things to be loyal, things to be patient. That was before me, I must've changed it. Shifted your focus, lense lookin' jaded. Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded. Most of these things, I don't wanna say. I wanna be around while you chasin'. You wanna hit me up when you make it. You tryna come back when you famous. (back around, back around). Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side. You wanna get with me, stop"

jodeci (freestyle) (feat. j. cole),"(Verso 1: Drake). Yeah. 26 on my third GQ cover. Your new shit sound like you do covers. On all of my old shit, oh shit. I devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed. Swear you niggas is hopeless. I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they're winning. On some cold shit, 50Ms for a three month road trip. I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them. Drizzy still got some '06 in him. IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on. All this capitol it's like I left the caps lock on. It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game. See I can still talk keys without dishing cane. Pay yourself and owe yourself. Before you come to my city just know yourself. Know where you at. I'm good in every town,. I'mma be there doing shows where you at. The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga. (Verso 2: Drake). Your money is just a little Barney's Co Op for you. to be tryna show out. I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op. We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop. Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best emcee. I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not. I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you. in your sore spot. Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga. I comedy central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas. Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or both nigga. I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas. You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga. I'll hang you with it soon as I teach you the ropes nigga. Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails. And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel. That five star in your city, they know where we at. I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga. (Ponte: J. Cole). Jodeci's back. You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back. I call the front desk for condoms, sayin' they ain't got none. The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga. Jodeci's back. Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back. I paint pictures and flip words. Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back. (Verso 3: J. Cole). Roof top, hoes turnt up. Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up. Wonder where she is, fuck could she be. She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak. Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak. Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me. Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas. Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas. Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain. Feel naked cause I laid out all my glory and my shame. Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame. 'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no. Fuck it 'less you lame niggas and doubters. I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest. Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started. I'm artistic, you niggas is autistic, retarded. Started, hold your applause. Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?. David and Goliath, takin' on the giants. No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours. No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars. Tappin' into '94 Nas. Or that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre. Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy. Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for twelve hours. Just to get their dollar signed. Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'. Trenchcoat flow, bottom line. To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine. Flow dumber than your projections. This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet. Your covers keep complexin' me. Maybe it's too complex for me. But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?. Cause either way, all them niggas is less to me. You legends know that we rap. Bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back"

Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'. Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed. That or it never existed. Whenever they say somethin' bout us, you listen.

I just thought you’d choose somewhere that has somebody that you know. I always up too late I worry bout you there alone. in that place you call your home. warm nights and cold patron. I hope you don’t get known for nothing crazy. cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady. I know they say the first love is the sweetest. but that first cut is the deepest. I tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets. secrets you were telling everybody but me. lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com. don’t be fooled by the money I’m still young and just unlucky. I’m surprised you couldn’t tell. [Drake singing]. I was only trying to get ahead. I was only trying to get ahead. but the spotlight makes you nervous. and your looking for a purpose. I was only trying to get ahead. I was only trying to get ahead. but the spotlight makes you nervous. and your looking for a purpose"
keep the family close,"[Intro]. It's a little chilly out there. How you can stand there is beyond me. [Hook]. All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends. I don't have anymore. How do you not check on me when things go wrong. Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer. Much closer. All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends. I don't have anymore. Guess that's what they say you need family for. Cause I can't depend on you anymore. [Verse 1]. Always saw you for what you could've been. Ever since you met me. Like when Chrysler made that one car. that looked just like the Bently. I always saw you for what you could've been. And even when its business with you its personal again. I knew you before you made ends meet. now were meeting our ends. [Bridge]. And its all because you chose a side. You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me. Guess it wasn't time. And of course you went and chose a side. that wasn't mine. [Verse 2]. You're so predictable I hate people like you. Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you. How you supposed to figure what I'm going through. You can't even figure out what's going on with you. You judge 'fore you met me yeah it figures. I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas. With my dad out in Tennessee it where I belong. Out here in La I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's going on. [Bridge]. And its all because you chose a side. You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me. Guess it wasn't time. And of course you went. and chose a side that wasn't mine. [Verse 3]. You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align. My look is a sure thing cause I'm living right. When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice. But you always had something to say every other time. Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way. I'm fooding and serving them all. like I'm working for minimum wage. Someone up there. must just love testing my patience. Someone up there. must be in need of some entertainment. Forgiveness for your ways. If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya. that's how I was raised. Same way I'm right here still feeling the wave. Same way I'm realized on a day to day. [Hook]. All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends. I don't have anymore. How do you not check on me when things go wrong. Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer. Much closer. All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends. I don't have anymore. Guess that's what they say you need family for. Cause I can't depend on you anymore. Much closer. [Outro]. Anytime people want to start problems. For real are you done. You know who mans are. I'm not afraid no [?] heart man. And I'm not afraid of [?]. And I'm not afraid of no waste neither. So anybody who want it can get it. Its that fact"

light up (feat. jay-z),"[Verse 1: Drake]. Ive been up for 4 days. Getting money both ways. Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold spades. Rolexes, chauffeurs, and low fades. I keep thinking how young can you die from old age. The always tell me no one is working as hard as you. And even though I laugh it off man its probably true. Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying. Im just here making all the music that they party too. But party on, party on, all night n-gga. I got these new rappers nervous prom night n-gga. I grow tired of these f-cking grown man liars. Story tellers, they aint even need a camp fire. Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth. Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot. This sh-t feel like when fredro star was a sunset bar stunting hard in his yellow goose. Ya, and ima mothing f-cking missed target. But a target none the less, and I just started. Was that directed at Muahh?. Cant be, they must be talking to themselves Hov, hands free. Yeah, and im just filling up this daily planner. Getting busy cuz im a star, no spangled banner. Jealous dudes get to talking in their music. And I just say I wrote it for yo girlfriends Kelsey Grammar. Yah, that’s what life becomes when you doing you. Welcome to Hollywood don’t let this town ruin you. And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwing you. Just know that she gon tell another n-gga when she through with you. Don’t get impatient when it takes to long. And drink it all even when it taste too strong yeah. I get her feeling live even if it kills me. Promise to always give you me, the real me. [Chorus]. Who would have thought. I’d be caught in this life?. Let’s celebrate with a toast. And get lost in tonight. And make it all light up. (Hey, Guru, tell hom’ to go to open that Ace right there),. Wait until the sun goes down. We gon’ make this bitch light up. Even when the sun goes down. I’m gon’ make this go. [Verse 2: Jay-Z]. OWWWWWWW, Hov turning heads like OWELSSSSS. Im the man of the hour. Triple entendre don’t even ask me how. Con-Edison Flo I’m connected to a high power. Bright lights will make your whole city light up. A trillion watt light bulb when im in the night club. I just landed in that G-450, caught the mayweather fight cuz his satellite was crispy. Uhh, yall can miss me with the money talk. The smart moneys on Hov, f-ck what the dummys talk. I don’t do to much blogging, I just run the town, I don’t do to much jogging. I aint gotta scar yet, you f-cking round with me and my dogs is far fetched. Drake, heres how they gon come at you. With silly rap feuds trying to distract you. In disguise in the form of a favor. The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors. Uhh, and ive seen it all done it all. That’s why none of these dum dums could done him off. The summers ours, the winter too. Top down in the winter, that’s what winners do. And to these n-ggas im like windows 7. You let em tell it they swear that they invented you. lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com. And since no good deed go unpunished. Im not as cool with n-ggas as I once was. I once was, cool as the fonz was,. but these bright lights turned me to a monster.

look what you've done,"It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with nebby. And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn't ready. And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy. And I sit next to you, and I lecture you 'cause those are deadly. And then you ask shit and we argue about spending money on bullshit. And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it. Now it's ""fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat"". And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that your sorry. You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too. And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two. I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see, it all hurt so bad. But maybe I wouldn't have worked as hard. If you were healthy and it weren't so bad. Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank. Cause leave it up to me, j, and neeks, we're probably. Gonna end up robbing a bank. Then wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long. Gets me a flight to houston in the morning. Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on. He's thinking of signing me, I come home. We make a mixtape with seventeen songs. I almost get a grammy off of that thing. They love your son and that boy gone. You get the operation you dreamed of. And I finally send you to rome. I get to make good on my promise. It all worked out girl, we shoulda known. Cause you deserve it. This shit real, should I pinch you?. After all the things that we been through, I got you. Look what you've done, look what you've done. Look what you've done for me now. You knew that I was gonna be something. We stressed out, and you need some, I got you. Look what you've done, look what you've done. It's like ""06 in your backyard and I'm in love with jade. And I'm still in love, just wasn't that real, so then it doesn't fade. And my father living in memphis now he can't come this way. Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid. Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black american dad story. Know that I'm your sister's kid but. That still don't explain the love that you have for me. I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances. Damn your house feel like the hamptons. For all of my summer romances. I never really had no one like you man this all new, shh. Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it. Had all this fighting going on at the crib. You calm me down when I lose it. Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music. You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far. Talked to me, to you got to me you. You tossed the keys and loaned me your car. Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top. Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested. Just another kid thats goin' through life. So worried that I won't be accepted. But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that. You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back. Checks bounce but we bounce back. I put all the money in your accounts back. And I thank you, I don't know how it'd really be without that. It worked out man. You deserve it. This shit real, should I pinch you?. After all the things that we been through, I got you. Look what you've done, look what you've done. Look what you've done for me now. You knew that I was gonna be something. We stressed out, and you need some, I got you. Look what you've done, look what you've done"
lord knows (feat. rick ross),"It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here. And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?. So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom. And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all. But that's just the result of me paying attention. To all these women that think like men with the same intentions. Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention. Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention. But weezy and stunna are my only role models. Heffer and jordan are my only role models. That's why I walk around with all this gold on. And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems. Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings. All of the little accents that make me a king. I never hear the disses they try and point out to me. But it's whatever if somebody wan' make it a thing. I'm more concerned what niggas thinkin' about christmas in august. Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters. Get some shake a brick in the press. And chef it like mrs. fields they're making the cookie stretch. I know it so well, I know the hustle so well. Stunt like I'm workin' overnighters right by the motel. Drug money, outfit record clean. Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team. Matchin' rollies for real, matchin' rovers for real. Places they say they've been, we've actually going for real. I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rappin'. I'm going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy. Mixtape legend, underground kings. Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things. With my new bitch that's living in palm springs. Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams. They take the greats from the past and compare us. I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era. In a time where it's recreation. To pull all your skeletons out the closet like halloween decorations. I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin' fun at. Never the flow though, they know I run that. Fuck you all, I claim that whenever. I change rap forever, the game back together, yup. Ym, I remain that forever. In the same place my brother wayne that forever. I'm a descendent of either marley or hendrix. I haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished. I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me. I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy. Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy. So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me. Lord knows, lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up. Roll the ?, it's time that somebody paid up. A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up. But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?. Bought a white ghost, now shit is gettin' spooky. Very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies. In this bitch all drinks on the house like snoopy. That's why all the real soldiers salute me. Trill nigga, for real. You know I love this. Yolo, you only live once. I'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie. Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal. I fell in love with the pen, started fucking in ink. The hustle's an art, I paint it what I would think. Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper. Destined for greatness, but got a place in jamaica. Villa on the water with the wonderful views. Only fat nigga in the sauna with jews. Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' carnival cruise. And these niggas talkin like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes. It's the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar. Every by week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car. Murder-cedes benz of that bubble double r. Headlights flickin', lookin' like a fallin' star. Everyday them hammers bang, with va like anime. I run the game but the ladies think I'm running game. Mink coats making women wanna fornicate. Rosay and drake, I'm gettin' cake, nothin' short of great"
lose you,"[Intro: John Taylor & Drake]. I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern. that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live. you have to set your own patterns. your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah). [Verse 1: Drake]. No snow tires, the Range slip-slide. like Trick Daddy and Trina. Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season. Queen Street visions that nobody believed in. If we not on the charts, my Xo niggas eatin'. Fifty-two consecutive weekends. shout out to Weeknd. The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'. Not when everybody out here beefin'. We got it, now we just gotta keep it. America's most wanted, man. I'm still on the run. All these number ones. and we still not the ones. No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun. Went and got diplomas. and we still goin' dumb. Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'. My competition, it's beyond offensive. I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention. Not tryna be fourth and inches. I'm tryna go the distance. Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission. This the remix to ""Ignition, "". hot and fresh out the kitchen. How you forget to fill up with gas. on the road to riches?. Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it. Too late for condolences when it's over with. I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it. Be open with people I need some closure with. Be honest with myself and take ownership. Opinions started to burn. when tables started to turn. I really used to feel like. they loved a nigga at first. Excitin' times, revitalized. Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively. I'm just takin' what God will give me. Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey. Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me. I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky. I wrote the book on world-class finesses. And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts. And never placin' second. And even better knowin' you're first. but then takin' second. Inspirin' and never takin' credit. I know I deserve more, I just never said it. Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah. [Chorus: Drake]. Did I lose you?. Did I? Did I?. Did I lose you?. Did I? Did I?. Did I lose you?. [Verse 2: Drake]. Winnin' is problematic. People like you more. when you workin' towards somethin'. Not when you have it. Way less support from my peers. In recent years as I get established. Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage. Why is my struggle different than others'?. Only child that's takin' care of his mother. As health worsens and bills double. That's not respectable all of a sudden?. I don't get a pat on the back for the come up?. What do you see when you see me?. When did all the things I mean. From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?. Maybe I share it with too many people. Back then it used to just feel like our secret. Back when I would write. And not think about how they receive it. I be tryna manifest the things I needed. And look, now, I mean. it's hard to believe it even for me. But you're mindful of it all. when your mind full of it all. How they go from not wantin' me at all. To wantin' to see me lose it all?. Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'. I'm overcome with emotions. Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober. Jealous ones still envy. and niggas turn king cobra. I could only speak what I know of. Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'. And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'. And puttin' your trust in someone. With the risk of financially sinkin'. All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies. Ego strokin', picture postin'. Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only. But you just had to show me. See, I know, 'cause I study you closely. I know when someone lyin'. I notice people standin' for nothin'. and gettin' tired. I know what we're both thinkin'. even when you're quiet. Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you. [Chorus: Drake]. Did I? Did I?. Did I lose you?. Did I? Did I?. Did I lose you?. [Outro: 600 Breezy]. This is the 6's year. Six hundreds instead of six, Ovo. You know we'll be rockin' our asses out. To my big brother Drizzy. You know what I'm sayin'?. More Life, 6 to the world, gang shit"
lust for life,"Lust For Life. I'm tryin' to do it all tonight,. I got plans,. I got a certain lust for life,. And as it stands,. Everything is going as right,. As it can,.

Uh, She in love,. And as for the pretty light skinned models standin' in the cold ah yea they with us,. Let them girls in for a drink,. And I'm all in they ear,. Saying she should be the one I see,. Every time that I'm here but when am I really even here ?. Black surburban wit' the tent on it,. Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it,. The game got these old hand prints on it,. But I'ma be the one to pour cement on it,. Uh, and start over,. And show up in a Mars yellow tux,. I don't really give a fuck,. And we only getting older,. So what I tend to do is to think of today as the past,. It's funny when you comin' in first but you hope that you last,. You just hope that it last,. that it last,. that it last,. that it last,. that it last. . Throw your ones up in the air,. Throw your ones up in the air for her,. Oh oh, throw your ones up in the air,. Throw your ones up.... . por lucasf."

Damn girl I wanna ride with you. Waved up blowing up blowing up growing up. Had to get it popping with you. (Verso 1). What if I pick you up from your house. We should get out. We haven't talked in a while. We should roll to see where it goes. I saw potential in you from the go. You know that I did. I don't know if you know but I know who you are. You could be big as Madonna. Just get in the car and let's touch the road. Don't make other plans. Say you get up early, you work for the man. Well he'll understand.

make me proud (feat. nicki minaj),"[Drake:]. I like a woman with a future and a past. A lil attitude problem all good, it'll make shit last. Don't make it too easy girl, don't take it too fast. Yeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like that. Only you can do it just like that. And I love it when your hair still wet cause you just took a shower. Running on a treadmill and only eating salad. Sound so smart like you graduated college. Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard. Knowing you, weekend in Miami tryna study by the pool. Couple things due but you always get it done. Might have been a time when I loved her too. But you take that away and you'll always be the one. One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl. Maybe it's just right for the night. You said niggas coming on too strong girl. They want you in their life as a wife. That's why you wanna have no sex, why you wanna protest. Why you wanna fight for your right. Cause you don't love them boys. P-ssy run everything, f-ck that noise. I know things get hard but girl you got it girl. You got it, there you go. Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go. Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine. When all these muthaf-ckas wanna waste your time. It's just amazing girl, and all I can say is. I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you. I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you.

Gotta ro-ro-row, gotta row ya boat. It's Pink Friday records and Ovo. Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest deal. Best legal team so the deals is ill. It's Mac, Opi and a fragrance too. Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue. Cobblestone, good view, lil gravel too. Gotta pay for the entourage travel too. Cause I'm fli-fli-fly, I'm flying high. Ain't got time to talk, just Hi and bye. Baby you can ask me to take a break. I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say. I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away. He asked my sign, I said a Sag'. I'm a star, Sheriff badge. What's the point? If I'm guardin'. Double D up hoes, Dolly Parton. I know things get hard but girl you got it girl. You got it, there you go.

march 14,"Here we go. Yeah. Yesterday morning was crazy. I had to come to terms that its not a maybe. That shit is in stone, sealed and signed. She not my lover like billy jean. But the kid is mine. Sandy used to tell me all it takes it one time. And all it took is one time. Shit, we only met two times, two times. And both times are nothing like the new times. Now it's rough times. I'm out here on front lines. Just making sure I see him sometimes. It's breaking my spirit. Single father, I hate when I hear it. I used to challenge my parents on every album. Now I'm embarrassed to tell them. I ended up as a co-parent. Always promised the family unit. I wanted it to be different. Cause I've been through it. But this is the hardest truth now. Fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories. I tell you now. I don't want you worry about. Who's house you live at. Or who loves you more, or who's not there. Who did what to who for you before you got here. Now, look, I'm too pride to let. That come between you now. Realize I got a thing for two now. I better make it. I promise if I'm not there then I'm dedicated. This the first positive dna we ever celebrated. I can't forget the look on their faces. Got the news in miami. That we all now got ones that we raisin'. Tell jello to bring some [?] rosé. And baka ride south to cheers. To the next generation. But the champagne toast is short lived. I got an empty crib in my empty crib. I only met you one time. Introduced you to saint nick. He must've brought you like twenty gifts. Your mother growing so fast. That they don't even fit. But you know. I still had to get it for my boy, you know. You haven't met your grandfather. That nigga a trip. He probably did stand up. But at the same time he's a stand up. And that's how you gonna be. When it's time to man up. October baby for irony sake, of coure. I got this 11 tatted for somebody. Now it's yours. And believe me, I can't wait to get 100 more. Sorry I'm vintage, tryna cover gorund. They said in two weeks. You're supposed to be in town. Hopefully by the time you hear this. Me and your mother will have come around. Instead of cutting each other down. God willing, I got a good feeling. You got a good spirit. We'll talk more when you hear this. My g. No one to cry on. I'm all alone. No one to cry on. I need shelter from the rain. To ease the pain. I'm changing from boy to a man. No one to cry on. I'm all alone. No one to cry on. I need shelter from the rain. To ease the pain. I'm changing from boy to a man. I'm all alone. No one to cry on. I need shelter from the rain.

Young King, pay me in gold. 40 got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll. These niggas be droppin songs they ain't even cold. Weezy on top and that nigga aint even home, yet!. Yeaah, be very afraid. These other rappers getting bodied and carried away. Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today. And now you bitches that be hatin can catch a bouquet, oww. Yeah, you a star in my eyes,. you and all them white girls party of five. Are we drinking a lil more I can hardly decide. I can't believe we really made it I'm partly surprised, I swear. Damn, this one for the books, man!. I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man!. I'm really tryna make it more than what it is. Cuz everybody dies but not everybody lives!. (Chorus). I wish that I could have this moment for life. For life, for life. Cuz in this moment I just feel so alive. Alive, alive. I wish that I could have this moment for life. (I could have this moment) for life. (I could have this moment) for life. This is my moment and it feels so alive. Alive, alive. (Bridge). This is my moment, I waited all my life. I can tell its time. Drifting away I'm one with the sunsets. I have become alive. (Chorus)"

more than a meme,"Drinks with some old friends. That's when it happens again. I start hearing from the whole fam. That I got clowned on Instagram. Tryna hide my reaction. When I read the funny caption. Feels like I'm in a bad dream. Cause I got turned into another meme, yeah. I just wanna scream. That I'm more than a meme, that's right. I just wanna scream. That I'm more than a meme. Catch me looking with those bedroom eyes. Asking if you're gonna finish those fries. Tryna say you really care about me. But then you put my picture on E. T. (It's not nice). How can I explain to my momma. When you got my beard on Obama. I do not complain, I am not a whiner. But why am I sitting on the Seinfeld diner?. I feel like I'm swimming upstream. Against all of these memes. Why do they attack me?. And then attack my favorite team?. Look, I'm not just a picture, I have feelings too. Like, how would you feel if it happened to you?. If I came after you, did a meme of her. Yeah cause your sketch got cut after dress rehearsal (eighty). What if I found your moment of pain. And used it for my own comedy gain?. Now you know what I mean. That I'm more than a meme. And look, I get that my face is expressive. But some of the memes are a little aggressive. I would just say it's a little excessive. When you go make me the face of Progressive. I know it's not important. But when they catch my face contorted. And the meaning gets distorted. I can only help but feel like crying Jordan. I'm more than a meme. Oh, ladies and gentleman, do I have a treat for you tonight. Rihanna is here tonight, make some noise. Oh I'm so excited to be here tonight. Oh my God, oh my God. Yeah, see Drake ain't a meme, meme, meme, meme, meme. But it nah seem, seem, seem, seem, seem, seem. Another joker getting, getting, getting, getting, getting. I swear we only friend, friend, friend, friend, friends. Alright, Rihanna's incredible ladies and gentleman. Make some noise for her please. I should take it as a sign of self-esteem. It feels like I'm the victim of an internet scheme. It's just hard when it seems. You don't love me for me. You just love me for memes"

I empower girls that don't deserve it. I don't mean to do that shit on purpose. It's just that when I go home. I start forgetting what it is. The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6. (Hook 2). You don't ever come to where I stay at. You just rather stay up in your. New York condo. You don't ever come to where I stay at. If anybody knows, girl you know, I know. Why are we wasting our relationship. on a relationship?. You know how sticky these situation get. You go up higher than me some days. You know what I think we could be some day.

one man show,"[Drake]. Look, I ain't never had a benzo. Nope, I pushed me an Ac wit the tintzo. nosey n-ggas is peakin' in my window. have a hard time looking. I tell you second hand that's a hard grind cooking. cause my pop was in it so deep. if his son wanted in it these dealers. would probably drop percentage. Instead, I drop bars like I'm two months sober. its my time now so them you months over. yeah if I want it I find me a way to get that. I'm trying to get to the point where I can sit back. took a lot of patience and action. I grind so I'm anticipating relaxing. I'm thinking bout replacing the Jacksons on top of the charts. I don't need brothers fillin' space in the back than.. so from the kid with the sun tan flow. the hottest ticket in town to this one man show. [Drake - Chorus]. I think that you know as well as I know. people checkin' for me every where that I go. what you gotta understand that it's me I be. until the motherf-cking day that I D.I.E. (repeated). [Verse 2]. they say im on of the best bet. I can easily make'em admit to bounce back. without knowing exactly where my accounts at. yeah you best believe that I often tenderly pass. what the rest achieve. so they don't like me and throw parties. and yet they never invite me. I can't lie sometime it bother me slightly. either way the true fans yell. I'll pick'em and its obvious so who can tell. and no this aint Blu cantrell. this is like perfection though we both got the light complexion. couple things that I do that well. and the way that I Jack-son you think that Drake new Sam-el. I've been real though, word out in memphis im lable as. Diz-zo. they stay kicking it with me like a field goal. see I'm humble but I live vain. with more deals on the table than a bridge game. [Chorus]. When he says ""Benzo"" he is talking about a. Benz as in the Bentley cars.. And when he says ""Ac"" he is saying he drove an Acura.. Than when he says ""I drop bars like I'm two months sober"".. He is referring it to someone that has stopped drinking. and no longer goes to bars.. Life if someone asks if you have a girlfriend/boyfriend. and you say ""No, I dropped her/him a week ago."". You had the part about the Jacksons right,. He is just saying that he wants to top what the. Jackson 5 have done by himself. He is basically saying that. Micheal Jackson was the reason the Jackson 5 did so well,. So since he is going to try and do it better,. He doesn't need his ""brothers"" in the background. filling in the empty space.. And I think there is a part before verse 2.. I think he says something like. ""They say it isn't a best bet."". But because of the DJ an ""Evil Empire"" you can't hear it.... I hope this has helped you in some way. if you decide to us it or not."

The backpackers are back on the bandwagon. Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day. And I met your baby moms last night. We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!. And I was drinking at the palms last night. And ended up losing everything that I came with. Feel like I've been here before huh?. I still got 10 years to go huh?. This is the only sound you should fear. These kids wear crowns over here. And everything is all right. I know, I know that you don't love me baby. The time to take you away from me. Only over my dead body"

Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment. And, baby, I'll never forget none of that. Girl, I told you I was coming back. Would've came back for you.

redemption,"[Intro]. Yeah, I get it. I get it. Yeah. [Verse 1]. Why would I say all these things. to have you feelin' a way?. Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?. Why do I settle for women. that force me to pick up the pieces?. Why do I want an independent woman. to feel like she needs me?. I lost my way. [Chorus]. I'm searchin' for these words to say to you. Please give me time. Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you. Oh please give me time. Cause I'm searchin' for these words. to say to you right now. Redemption's on your mind when you think about me. Yeah. Redemption's on your mind when you think about me. Yeah. [Verse 2]. Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else. I gave your nickname to someone else. I know you're seein' someone that loves you. And I don't want you to see no one else. I don't want you here with someone else. I don't wanna do this with no one else. I used to know you back when you was young. Your brother brought me through, you saw me. That made me think of you so differently. I miss the feeling of you missing me. But you say you're over and done with me. Aw yeah, yeah, yeah. Aw yeah, yeah, yeah. [Chorus]. Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me. Aw yeah, yeah, yeah. Redemption's on your mind when you think about me. Aw yeah, yeah, yeah. Redemption's on your mind when you think about me. Aw please give me time. Cause I'm searchin' for these words. to say to you right now. [Verse 3]. Say to you. But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah. Say to you. A Mercedes coupe. that you're still drivin' with just me and you. Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?. Act like he's really the one to get through it with you. Took up with Jessica, Kim. you know that I'm bound to see you. And they both say that you're over and done with me. Aw yeah, yeah, yeah. Aw yeah, yeah, yeah. [Chorus]. They say redemption's on your mind. when you think about me. Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah. Redemption's on your mind when you think about me. Aw yeah, yeah, yeah. Redemption's on your mind when you. Aw please give me time. Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say. to you right now. [Verse 4]. Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women. I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it. Relationships slowin' me down. they slow down the vision. Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment. Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me. That mean a lot to me. Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me. This year for Christmas I just want apologies. Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'. Syd had a baby and treated me different. Erica sued me and opened a business. Wonder if they was here. shit could have been different. Wonder what they'd do put in my position. I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?. Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions. I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven. Tryna satisfy everybody. It's like they can't get enough. Until enough is enough. And that is too much. You tip the scale when I weigh my options. West Palm girls are spoiled rotten. Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'. I'll kill somebody if they give you problems. Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'. Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet. I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit. Sell my secrets and get top dollar. Sell my secrets for a Range Rover. Opportunity and temptation. They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation. Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'. Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?. Since take care, I've been caretakin'. At second chances, that ain't how you livin'. Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven. [Outro]. Yeah. I know] (9069799)"

Than that for me to control my issues. I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell. Every title doing numbers like I'm miss adele. Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell. I'm the chosen one. Flowers never pick themselves. No more, no more. Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah. No more, no more. Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah. Niggas want a classic. That's just ten of these. Crime family like the genovese. You don't want drama, kapeesh?. My house is full of supermodels. Just like mohammed hadid. I take this shit too serious. You niggas my comic relief. I find it funny how I keep on talking. And commas increase. I'm standing at the top of where you niggas. Are climbing to reach. I even got my very own initials. Inscribed on my sheets. Subtle reminders are key, gs. Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic. And everyone that wants the worst. For me's asking what happened. Backstabbed so many times. I started walking backwards. Like charlemagne. I see the light and see the darkest patches. Bury me and I'll be born again. I walk in godly form amongst the mortal man. I got some real demons across the border fence. And made a note of the mistakes. We can't afford again. Like I said. Can of worms and I'm the early bird. Niggas want to hang. But I'm too busy doing dirty work. Hit em back and say we'll link back on the 33rd. When I say that they cursing me. It ain't dirty words. Church of pentecost, holy spirit synagogue. I don't know who's protecting me. But we hit it off. Sandra's rose. No wonder they tryna' pick me off. I guess you gotta show these niggas. Who you really are. No more, no more. Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah. No more, no more. Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah"
say something,"This shit was all I know, You and me only. And I did it all for you, Still you were lonely. We coulda worked it out. Uhh, but i guess things change. Its funny how someone else’s success brings pain. When ya no longer involved that person has it all. And you just stuck standing there. But, I’m gonna need you to say something baby. Say something baby, say something baby. I’m gonna need you to say something baby. Say something baby, say something baby. Uhh, i am the topic of conversation, this a celebration. Lets toast to the fact that I moved out my momma basement. To a condo downtown because its all about location. I sit and drink wine and watch californication of life. You shoulda been here to kick it with me. We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50. But now i’m at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy. Killing shit the ever so talented Mr Ripley. How I go from being the man that you argue with. To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hottest shit. I should wanna go back to the one I started with. But I’m addicted to this life its gonna be hard to quit. Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along. You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs. Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen. Cause whats a star when its most important fan is missing?. Chorus:. This shit was all I know, You and me only. And I did it all for you, Still you were lonely. We coulda worked it out. Uhh, but i guess things change. Its funny how someone else’s success brings pain. When ya no longer involved that person has it all. And you just stuck standing there. But, I’m gonna need you to say something baby. Say something baby, say something baby. I’m gonna need you to say something baby. Say something baby, say something baby"

Eat her til she cry, call that ""wine and dine"". Try to check me and I'mma have 'em checkin' pulses. They say chose wisely, thats why I was chosen. Rocking like asphalt, its the cash fault.

And taint all your images of ""Mr. Perfect"". I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer. Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover. This is one I know you hated when you heard it. And it's worse because you know that I deserve it. Take a shot for me. Take a shot for me. Take a shot for me. A shot for me. A shot for me.

How you let me run it down here?. I'm not even from around here. Six, six, six, six, six. Soon as I'm back in the city, they throw a parade. I might get the key to city and give it to Wayne. Or give it to one of the young boys, to carry the wave. So trust me, they'll be out here looking for revenge. All summer sixteen. All summer sixteen. Playing dirty, not clean. Out in front of Four Season. Looking like a damn football team. All repping one thing. Looking for. ""They don't want us to have. a bigger pool than Kanye"""
summers over interlude,"Oh, baby, yeah. Days in the sun. And nights in the rain. Summer is over, simple and plain. Found me some fun that's good for the pain. Already told you, I don't feel the same. I don't feel the same. Anywhere I go. I can't help but show. I don't feel the same. Anywhere I go. I can't help but know. I don't feel the same. Anywhere I go. I can't help but know"
sunflower,"You're, making it feel that everything is alright. You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower. In a world that's crumbling, all around us everyday. You are, all the inspiration that I need to find my way. How long I've been yearning, for the day I find my one true love. Now that you are here my darling, I want you to stay (I want you to stay). You're, making it feel that everything is alright. You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower. You're, making it feel that everything is alright. You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower. Whenever you call me, I'll be there with no delay, my love. Even when I'm miles away girl, my heart will be there (I'll be right there). Any conversation that you want to have, you'll have my ear. You can tell me all your secrets, they'll be safe my dear. You're, making it feel that everything is alright. You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower. You're, making it feel that everything is alright. You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower. [Drake:]. I'm not that good with words, but I'm a try my best. Look, I don't ever wanna make you mad girl. I just wanna have you see you know the things young men are hesitant to have girl. A little you a little me and someone else, good lord that's a winner right there. But we really got a story to tell, it can't finish right there. I used to wonder what my old girl doing right now. Ever since you came into my life. Everytime I think it'd be good to call her. I just think about you and it'd make me think twice, ah yeah. I know we've been through a couple things. You know a couple things, what are we to do. But you make me feel good, you love me for me and you love me for you. Come on. [Chorus:]. You're, making it feel that everything is alright (it's gon be alright). You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower. You're, making it feel that everything is alright. You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower"
survival,"I been waitin' on this yeah. All of this disorder, no addressin'. The crown is broken in pieces. But there's more in my possession. There's a whole lot in my possession. Who do you really love?. Well, that's sure to be in question. My mount rushmore is me. With four different expressions. Who's givin' out this much return on investment?. After my run, man, how is that even a question?. After this summer, man, how is that even a. I've had real philly niggas. Try to write my endin'. Takin' shots with the gold. And talk about shots that we sendin'. I've had scuffles with bad boys. That wasn't pretendin'. I've had too many nights to mention. That's just the beginnin'. I'm pretty sure we got a label. I'm still independent. I fell back a hundred times. When I don't get the credit. Seen this movie a hundred times. I know where it's headed. Realize someone gotta die. When no one'll dead it. Niggas gamblin' with they life. For some content. That's the type of lottery. That could get your top picked. I am a cream of the crop, nigga. You niggas pop mollies, my mollies pop niggas. House on both coasts, but I live on the charts. I'll tee with the stars. And I swim with the sharks. And I see in the dark. Wasn't this cold at the start. Think my soul has been marked. There's a hole in my heart. Yeah, I was about to. Man, I thought about it. It's unsettlin' to talk about it. Free all of my niggas. That they caught with it. Rip my niggas that they caught without it. This just a intro. Let me not get ahead of myself. This is god's plan, young man. You said it yourself. Always got a ace up my sleeve. For whatever was dealt. Daddy got suits like bernie mac. He dresses himself. I stopped askin' myself. And I started feelin' myself. Now I gotta deal with all this drama. And deal with myself. I ain't even have to cut the tie. It severed itself. This just the intro. Let me not get ahead of myself"

You should just sleep on it, you shouldn't doubt me. It would be different without me. What is it without me. Don't go do nothing without me. This is a blessing, mashallah, wallahi. I swear my life stories better than stories they tellin' bout me. They got it twisted. Ride the pipe like a bike, make sure you're going the distance. And if he wasn't with it, then why were you with him?. Maybe you just had to realize. That knowing the difference can make all the difference. She wanna ride me that adanunana. Yeah she keep giving me looks"
take care (feat. rihanna),"Know you've been hurt by someone else. I can tell by the way you carry yourself. If you let me, here's what I'll do. I'll take care of you. I've loved and I've lost. I've asked about you and they've told me things. But my mind didn't change. I still feel the same. A life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed. I've had mine, you've had yours we both know. We know, they don't get you like I will. My only wish is I die real. Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal. And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still. So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case. Big girls all get a little taste. Pushing me away so I give her space. Feeling with a heart that I didn't break. I'll be there for you, I will care for you. I keep thanking you, just don't know. Try to run from that, say you're done with that. On your face girl, it just don't show. When you're ready, just say you're ready. When all the baggage just ain't as heavy. And the parties over, just don't forget me. We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow. Won't ever have to worry. You won't ever have to hide. If you seen all my mistakes. So look me in my eyes. Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do. I'll take care of you. I've loved and I've lost. It's my birthday, I get high if I want to. Can't deny that I want you, but I lie if have to. Cause you don't say you love me. To your friends when they ask you. Even though we both know that you do (you do). One time, been in love one time. You and all your girls in the club one time. All so convinced that you're following your heart. Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes. We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed. I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know. We know. You hate being alone. You ain't the only one. You hate the fact that you bought the dream. And they sold you once. You love your friends but somebody should've told you something. To save you, instead they say. Don't (hahaha) tell me (hahaha). I don't care (hahaha). If you hurt (hahaha). I don't (hahaha) tell you (hahaha). You don't care (hahaha). It feels good (hahaha). Don't (hahaha) tell me (hahaha). I don't care (hahaha). If you hurt (hahaha). I don't (hahaha) tell you (hahaha). You don't care (hahaha). It feels good (hahaha). Know you've been hurt by someone else. I can tell by the way you carry yourself. If you let me, here's what I'll do. I'll take care of you. I've loved and I've lost"
talk up (feat. jay-z),"Ayy, ayy. Lot of 6's in here tonight. Yeah, yeah, ayy. Ten of us, we movin' as one. I'm so proud of who I've become. You might think I've taken some lumps. Only if we talkin' 'bout sums (yeah). Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax. My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts. This's and that's, can't be ignorin' the stats. Based off of that, they gotta run me the max. They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks. They had it set up for real. But they didn't come with the slaps. When I heard the shit I was skippin' through that. If I get it trippin', it's no comin' back. I don't understand, these niggas gotta adapt. You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map. Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent. I promise it fell in my lap. My money is young, my problems are old. I promise I'm bridgin' the gap. You know what I'm sayin'? (woo). Ayy, ayy, yeah. You know what I'm sayin'? (gyeah, gyeah, gyeah, gyeah). Niggas provoke, this shit ain't a joke, man, nobody playin'. He's at the top and he's at the top, but nobody stayin'. These niggas around but they ain't around. You know what I'm sayin'?. Say that they down, when they shit is down. You know what I'm sayin'?. Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?. Ayy, ayy, yeah. You know what I'm sayin'?. Yo, get close enough to hov, smell like a kilo still. First album 26, I ain't need no deal. Already a hood legend, I ain't need no shine. First rollie flooded out, I ain't see no time, woah. Stand-up niggas, we only duckin' indictments. Dope boys, off-white, lookin' like soft white on 'em, heh. You know what I'm sayin'?. We in the buildin', we came for a billion, ain't nobody playin'. Live every word that I'm rappin'. Said I lost 90 bricks and it happened. You probably wouldn't believe everything. That you seein' right now if it wasn't live action. I ain't on the 'gram, they record who I am. God to these dope boys, how you not be a hov fan?. I'm what meech shoulda been. I'm what supreme didn't become. If alpo didn't snitch, niggas'd be like young. I got your president tweetin', I won't even meet with him. Y'all killed x, let zimmerman live, shh, s-streets is done. You know what I'm sayin'?. Ayy, ayy, yeah. You know what I'm sayin'?"
teenage fever,"Your heart is hard to carry after dark. You're to blame for what we could have been. 'Cause look at what we are. Your friends are scared to tell you went too far. Funny that it's always been all about you from the start. I met someone new last night. and we kicked it. And I'm going back there tonight. And you know what's on my mind, this time. Going back there tonight. And you know what's on my mind. If you had my love. And I gave you all my trust. Would you comfort me?. And if somehow you knew. That your love would be untrue. Would you lie to me?. If you had my love. And I gave you all my trust. Would you comfort me?. And if somehow you knew. That your love would be untrue. Would you lie to me?. Out of body. That's just how I feel. when I'm around you, shawty. Last night we didn't say it. But girl, we both thought it. Why second guess? I should have stayed. You say the word, I'm on the way. This shit feels like teenage fever. I'm not scared of it, she ain't either. Why second guess? I should have stayed. 'Cause you know what's on my mind tonight. If you had my love. And I gave you all my trust. Would you comfort me?. And if somehow you knew. That your love would be untrue. Would you lie to me?. If you had my love. And I gave you all my trust. Would you comfort me?. And if somehow you knew. That your love would be untrue. Would you lie to me?. Yeah, slightly took a left turn there. But very much 6am. Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me. More ideas and stuff comin'. Yeah, yeah, fam. I'm wafflin', but man is tired, fam. Jesus Christ"
tell me,"Girl, I hate the fast talking. fast walking, fast fucking, fast loving oh. Wanna move slow. Got a little liquor in my system. always been friends underestimating. how far that that shit go.

What is different about me? Oh. Tell me. What is? What is?. Can't keep you off of me. Nowadays you can't get enough of me. Loving me, loving me, loving me more.

Nowadays you can't get enought of me. Loving me, loving me, loving me more. You loving me, love when you loving me. Oh yeah yeah"
tell me why (rich homie quan feat. drake),"[Drake]. All my niggas so hungry, man they just eat what they kill. I like convertible Bentleys and houses deep in the Hills. I might tell the whole crew come through. My squad gotta roll through come through. Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin'. Because they sure do come true. Then I say: this that fuckin' mob shit. this that fuckin' player shit. This that shake a bottle up. and bust the top and spray the shit. Bitches gettin' dugout like where all the fuckin' players sit. And like you just got traded. Girl you don't know who you're playin' with. Oh yeah, oh yeah, my sound is what up right now. I've been down, but I'm up right now. Nigga been backstrokin' and breaststrokin'. Through that lane that you left open. Man I don't give a fuck right now. Let a nigga swim in the pussy on the low. 'Bout to go drown in the cup right now, holla. [Rich Homie Quan]. I don't know what it was about you. Like blue you left me without a clue. (I pictured the fate, is it true?). Cause I try to make this shit work. (But it seems like is it your feelings. You kept them hatin' bitches all in our business). But I just got one question baby. Tell me why?. [Rich Homie Quan]. Started from the bottom like Drake said. You the type of nigga get robbed wanna play dead. My squad'll kick in your door where that safe at. No Atari, games girl I don't play that. If she broke on that [?] , everything I say I follow up. What you talkin' 'bout? Umm, Polo shirt, my collar up. Drippin' on these hoes. Ain't by myself, it's a lot of us. Made a little money, still ain't got enough. And if you got a nigga dead, put your lighter up. Eyes open, don't say nothin'. Motor geeked up like a razor. You don't know me, you must mistake me. For somebody else. But it's somethin' about you that I fell in love with. Your ex nigga, fuck him. I had to tell her that. [Rich Homie Quan]. Question, baby, tell me why. One question, baby, tell me why"
thank me now,"[Drake - Chorus]. You could thank me now. uh, go ‘head. Thank Me Later yeah I know what I said. but later doesn’t always come so instead. it’s okay,. You could thank me now. uhh, yeah, well alright, here I go. [Verse 1 - Drake]. mahalo from the hardest act to follow. lately I’ve been drinking like there’s a message in a bottle. aloha’s to women with no ties. to men that I know well. that way there are no lies. you could thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas. on the brink of influential. I’m here for you niggas I guess a hit doesn’t add up to a career. for you niggas. I must have been hard to watch,. what a year for you niggas. it’s December 31st and we in Miami just meditating. you got resolutions, we just got reservations. living out a dream, it feels like I stayed up. and we just wanna party (?) straight up. fuck that old sh-t, I’m on new things. O.V.O. clique, Red wing boot gang. yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement. who’d thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic. I could relate to kids going straight to the league. when they recognise that you got what it takes to succeed. and thats around the time that your idols become your rivals. you make friends with Mike but gotta AI him for your survival. damn, I swear sports and music are so synonomous. ’cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us. yeah so on behalf of the demanded. and the entertainment you take for granted. you could thank me now…. and oh my goodness you’re welcome. you’re welcome. at this point me is who I’m trying to save myself from. rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them. cause they think that I can help them get back to where they fell from. but drink up because everyone here is good tonight. except the niggas that I came with, they good for life. yeah, thats how you know it’s going down. in case another chance never comes around…. [Drake - Chorus]. You could thank me now. uh, go ‘head. Thank Me Later yeah I know what I said. but later doesn’t always come so instead. it’s okay,. You could thank me now. uhh, yeah, well alright, here I go. [Drake - Verse 2]. Uhh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming. I think I’m spending all my time with the wrong women. I think I have a chance at love but knowing me I miss it. cause me dedicating my time just isn’t realistic. man the good girls went silent on me. they got a boyfriend or left for college on me. and all the bad ones I used to hit her friends now. that make me wish I had a little less mileage on me. but do I ever come up in discussion over double pump latte’s. and low fat muffin’s, do I?. Or is missing what we had outta the question. I’m probably just the reason that you learned your lesson. I got flows for the Marilyn Monroe’s who’s there before it all. I guess thats how it goes. they hear about your cars or focus on your pro’s. and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul. but those same ones from your area will grow. into women that are ready to get married at hello. because of what they allow. where are they all now. I know there somewhere watching so I’m trying to make them proud. searching for the meaning. you’ll find it next to me. and tell me that I’m the finest I guess we finally get to see. I’m feeling like Nas who am I to disagree. they say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key. it’s probably why I’m in this bitch shining. jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment. I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded. and the bandwagons full you can try and run behind it. I’m sorry poolside drinking. margharita rounds. shout out to my city though I hardly be in town. I’m the black sheep if (?) where’s the crown. and I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down. I’m in the World where things are taken, never given. how long they choose to love you will never be your decision. and I’m aware this could be the last time you listen. so while I’m still in this postion…. [Drake - Chorus]. You could thank me now. uh, go ‘head. Thank Me Later yeah I know what I said. but later doesn’t always come so instead. it’s okay,. You could thank me now. uhh, yeah, well alright, here I go"
that's how you feel,"Yeah, woo. I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways. Way that you lookin' all the time. Time gets to tickin' and it takes a toll. Told you I couldn't really draw the line. Line ringin', sayin' that you told him things. Things that you could've kept inside. Sidetrackin' me when I was good to you. You were somebody I would stand behind. I know you like to drink 'til the sun up. Grind to you come up. Work all winter. Shine all summer. Ride for your brother. Die for your mother. Keep that shit a hunna. I know you wanna. Vaca to a place where you could. Take pictures, post on insta'. Your friends say they miss ya'. But they don't really miss ya'. Rule number one, be a boss ass bitch. Never let a clown nigga try to play you. If he play you, then rule number two. Is fuck his best friends. And make 'em yes men (okay). (wow, that's how you feel?). I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways. Way that you lookin' all the time. Time and it left you with a broken heart. Hardly excuses how you play with my. Mindin' my business and you show up. Up turn over, I should've seen the signs. Signin' me up to do your dirty work. Workin' to try to get you off my mind. I know you like to drink 'til the sun up. Grind to you come up. Work all winter. Shine all summer. Ride for your brother. Die for your mother. Keep that shit a hunna. I know you wanna. Vaca to a place where you could. Take pictures, post on insta'. Your friends say they miss ya'. But they don't really miss ya'. What the fuck, this ain't chanel, nigga?. Custom down?. What the fuck, I ain't smokin' hot?. Bust me down?. You the same clown nigga. That was runnin' me down. Now you all up in my 'cause you wanna be down?. (wow, that's how you feel?)"
the calm,"(Verso 1). I'm just so far gone. October's own. Please leave me alone. Drunk off champagne. Screamin' in the phone. See my house is not a home. Fuck is going on. Where did we go wrong. Where do we belong. Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone. Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on. When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone. Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne. And tell me don't forget them and I promise that I won't. Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known. To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone. Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown. I've done more for this city. then these rappers that have blown. It's only been three years. Look at how I've grown. I'm just in my zone. I call this shit the calm. Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm. Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond. Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long. You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm. Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known. I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne. I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't. (Refrão). You know everything gon' be all right, I promise. I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position. vent to y'all but. 40 Mama always say don't ask permission. Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me. yeah, yeah. (Verso 2). And life is so insane. Look what I became trying to make a name. All my first dates are interrupted by my fame. Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain. They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain. It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain. Women need attention, therefore, women will complain. Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame. Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game. I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwyane. It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing. So I'm lifting all alone try not to get a sprain. Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange. Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed. Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range. And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars. and some change. Damn, and I could only feel his pain. Cause in Memphis Tennessee there's only so much to attain. So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again. He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain. I'm why your girl heart is in a slang. Call me ""Heartbreak Drake"", I'm the hardest one to tame. As a man, I'm just honest; as an artist I'm a king. With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain. Yea, and see, this is the thang. What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain. The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane. Is the single-handed reason I remain me. (Outro). I said I call this shit the calm. But I'm the furthest thing from calm. Swear I'm putting on. And everybody wanna ask. What type of act you putting on, like. Man"
the language,"[Verse 1]. I don't know why they been lying. but yo shit is not that inspiring. Bank account statements just look. like I'm ready for early retirement. Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction. Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist. and it's already platinum. I am the kid with the motor mouth. I am the one that you should worry about. I don't know who you're referring. To, who is this nigga you heard. About?. Someone just talking that bullshit. Someone just gave you the. Run-around. Niggas downplaying the money. but that's what you do when the money down. I don't waste time putting money down. I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash. Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour. and you gotta fly in first class. This has been years in the making, it's all for the city. You know I come right every summer. Cash Money Records forever. I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna. You know it. [Hook]. Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell. I will never understand that but oh. Well. Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you. She just want to smoke and fuck, I said. ""Girl, that's all that we do"". Okay. Now you're talking my language. Now you're talking my language. Now you're. Talking my language. Now you're talking my language. Been ready, it's real. I don't know about you. She just want to smoke and fuck, I said ""Girl, that's. All that we do"". [Verse 2]. I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man. no one's invited. I got to kill off the weak shit. that's got all you niggas excited. I can't even listen, you whylin'. I'd much rather sit here in silence. I send all my money to banks in the islands. and eat with Italians, I do. People are funny. you don't even know about the shit that I been through. I just want some head in a comfortable bed. it could all be so simple. Talking that shit with your back to me. just know it always get back to me. Come get your girl, she been here for three days. and she way too attached to me. Hate when they get too attached to me. I got to get on the bus and get back on the road. Get what I can out the country. And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold. Can't even drive with the top off. Been workin' so hard on the album. I missed the whole summer. I just might bring in some girls from Miami. To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna. You know it. [Hook]. Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell. I will never understand that but oh. Well. Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you. She just want to smoke and fuck, I said. ""Girl, that's all that we do"". Okay. Now you're talking my language. Now you're talking my language. Now you're. Talking my language. Now you're talking my language. Been ready, it's real. I don't know about you. She just want to smoke and fuck, I said ""Girl, that's. All that we do"". [Outro: Birdman]. You understand me?. Showtime, headlines. Big time, sunshine, tote nines. Bust mines, flatline, hard grind. High life, stay fly as jet time. Stunt nigga, every time you see a nigga. Stunt nigga, every time you see a nigga. Stunt nigga, swag on head to feet nigga. Stunt nigga. [Drake]. I might just bring in some girls from Miami. To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna. You know it"
the last hope (feat. kardinal offishall),"Chorus:. I gotta make it out, or move quickly,. Can't allow the past to restrict me,. But this time around they won't skip me,. I am the last hope, don't hesitate. Not even for a second, the hustlers become an obsession,. I'm on the front line, so my weapon, I am the last hope.. Kardinall:. Can you imagine the last breath of christ,. The last breath of christopher wallace on that faithful night. The last step that martin lurther took as a man. I got the power of my world in my hand. The microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye. I was born to provoke those born to die .. I was conceived to beat all odds like las vegas .. T-dot mutherfucker watch the world rape us .. Great test strugglers hustler to us succeed .. Cross water smugglers tussel to burn weed .. It meets that pressure to success in the south.. Niggas watchin what I say magnifin my mouth .. I never take back talk I apply the force .. Hand blistering for many years of holding the torch .. When the skin rebuilds it grows tougher then leather,. So we can keep on hold it forever .. My names kardinall. Chorus:. I gotta make it out, or move quickly,. Can't allow the past to restrict me,. But this time around they won't skip me,. I am the last hope, don't hesitate. Not even for a second, the hustlers become an obsession,. I'm on the front line, so my weapon, I am the last hope.. Drake:. Jealousy is suttin I haven't felt in years. There's nobody around for me to be jealous off. I bet you do is showing my city and no one cheers. Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love and dove .. I'm incredible often unforgettable but when it comes to records. I will eat it if its editable. They say the futures always for-seen. That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream. My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before a dream. I stay avoiding unlucky like 14 .. And people get behind and they fight for em. Cause he won't let no other niggas wright for em. And even when its quite warm the attitude coursing. Through the veins and my city is an ice storm. The name's drake and I don't take it for granted. I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage mang .. Chorus:. I gotta make it out, or move quickly,. Can't allow the past to restrict me,. But this time around they won't skip me,. I am the last hope, don't hesitate. Not even for a second, the hustlers become an obsession,. I'm on the front line, so my weapon, I am the last hope."
the motion (feat. sampha),"(Drake). It's not me and you. It's not me, it's you. The records say you know it. they don't love you like I do. Say you're moving on. well I guess that's just the motion. I guess that's just the motion oh-oh. I guess that's just the motion oh-oh. I guess that's just the motion oh-oh. I guess that's just the motion. I don't have a fuck to give. I've been moving state to state. In my leather and my tims like its 1998. And my dog chubby chub. that's my nigga from the wake. On the east side of the city that's where everybody stay. Seem like everybody calling. cuz they want me on they song. It's like every time I touch it. I could never do no wrong. When they need a favor from your man. they don't leave you alone. But I guess that's just the motion. Then that phone doesn't ring. When they got everything that's the motion oh-oh. I guess that's just the motion oh-oh. I guess that's just the motion yeah. Lookin back on it at least my pride is intact. Cuz we said no strings attached. and I still got tied up in that. Everything that I write is either for her or about her. So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it. The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health. Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else. I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself. Don't even know how to help. But I guess that's just the motion. She'll probably come around, soon as I settle down. That's the motion oh-oh. I guess that's just the motion. I guess that's just the motion. I guess that's just the motion"

the real her,"[Verse 1]. People around you should really have nothing to say. Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way. And the weekends here started it right, even if you only get part of it right. Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight. Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring. If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing. [Bridge]. Houston girls, love the way it goes down. Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down. Vegas girls, love the way it goes down. [Hook]. But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?. Just met her, already feel like I know the real her. You musta done this before, this can't be your first time. We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind. You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find. You musta done this before, this can't be your first time. [Verse 2]. They keep telling me don't save you. If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right. Then who will I complain to?. But the weekend's here, started it right, even if I only get part of it right. Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight. You got your guards up, I do too, there's things we might discover. Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other. [Bridge] + [Hook]. [Verse 3: Lil Wayne]. Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another. So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover. And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover. I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder. About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it. I know what makes her smile, but I won't know what makes her different. Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass. I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last... Tunechi. [Hook]. [Verse 4: Andre 3000]. Shower her with dollar tips. Shawty went and bought a whip. Guarantee the city remember your whole name. You throw the ho a scholarship. All of them ain't all equipped. And this saddens me, I see the pecking order. Quote-unquote ""bad bitches"" work the whole floor. Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner. Like a lab rat nobody want her. Niggas that are married don't wanna go home. We look up to them, they wish they were us. They want some new trim. We lust for some trust. Now the both of us are colorblind. Cause the other side looks greener. Which leaves your turf in the Boise state. Can't see her play or the team, cuz. Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you. And those who say they don't. Souls will later on say to them ""that ain't true"". All of them will have an opinion. But y'all know what you can do with them. But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour. To a place I can stick that in. Well, sitting here sad as hell. Listening to Adele, I feel you baby. Someone like you, more like someone unlike you. Or something that's familiar maybe. And I can tell that she wants a baby. And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy. Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy. Please be careful: bitches got the rabies"
the resistance,"The Resistance Lyrics: Drake. [Intro]. Yesterday when we were getting high. you were invited, you woulda liked it. uh uh nah, I know you all too well. we said that we can kiss the past goodbye. but your weren’t excited. there’s no way to fight it. you can stay shawty but here I go. [Drake - Verse 1]. Should I spend the weekend in Vegas. I’m busy living the moment not taking pictures to save it. I mean how could I forget. my memories never faded I can’t relate to these haters. my enemies never made it. I am… still here with who I started with. the game needed life, I put my heart in it. I blew myself up, I’m on some martyr sh-t. carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship. yeah, I’m 23 with a money tree. growing more too, I just planted 100 seeds. It’s ironic cause my mother was a florist and thats how she met my pops. and now my garden is enormous, it’s happening penny lane. I said its happening Penny Lane. just like you said I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead. uh ahh, thats word to the millions that they putting up. I’m trying to do better than good enough!. lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com. [Chorus]. What am I afraid of. this is what dreams are supposed to made of. the people I don’t have time to hang with. always look at me and say the same sh-t. You promised me you would never change. oh, huh huh. oh, huh huh. oh, huh huh. You promised me you would never change. oh, huh huh. oh, huh huh. [Drake - Verse 2]. Am I wrong for making light of my situation. clap on when 40 got something for me to snap on. NOw that I’m on I dont want to worry about getting back on. I’m just trying to stay on. get my f-cking buffett on. I heard they jsut moved my grandmother to a nursing home. and I’ll be acting like I don’t know how to work a phone. but hit redial you’ll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall. that I barely know at all and. plus this women that I mess with unprotected txt us saying she wish she woulda kept it. the one I’m laying next to just looked over and read it. I couldn’t tell you where the f-ck head is. I’m holding on by a thread its like I’m high right now. the guy right now and you can tell by looking at my eyes right now. that nothing really comes as a surprise right now. cause we having the time of our lives right now. [Chorus]. [Drake - Verse 3]. I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me. the other day Lissa told me she missed the old me. which made me question when I went missing. and when I start treating my friends different. maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the 2 guns in my face during the stick up. maybe cause I girl I f-cking trusted set the whole sh-t up. but a fact I have’nt seen ‘em since they locked big Rich up. I know, the same time, I’m quick to forget. bout to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets. burn it al burn it all, I’m starting it fresh. cause half the itme I got it right I probably guessed. did I just trade free time for camera time. will I blow all of this money baby, hammertime. yeah, I just need some closure, aint no turning back for me. I’m in it till it’s over. [End]"
the ride,"I hate when people say they feel me man, I hate that sh-t.. It'll be a long time before ya'll feel me, if ever.... [Drake]. You won't feel me til everybody say they love you, but it's not love. And your suit is Oxblood and your girl f-ckin' hates you and your friends faded off shots of. What you ordered than forget about the game you on top of. Your famous girlfriend ass gettin' thicker than the plot does. And when you forget it, thats when she pop up. And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up. I get 3 SUV's for ni--as dressed like refugees. And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs. And you do dinners at French Laundry and Napa Valley. Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that sh-t right up your alley. You see a girl and you ask about her. Bitches smiling at ya, it must be happy hour. They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down. It's feeling like you own every place you choosing to be at now. Walking through airport security with your hat down. 'Stead of gettin' a pat down, they just keep on saying that they feel ya ni--a. Yeah,. It's been too long. Been way too long. [Hook - The Weeknd]. I'm faded too long, oooh. Still I'm Faded too long, ooooh. Still I've been faded too long. I been faded too long. The ride. [Drake]. You wont feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself you're in it. And tell the World around you that your paper work is finished. And steal your mothers debit cards so you maintain an image. And ride around in overpriced rental cars that aint tinted. You need a minute, you got it. You know its real when your latest nights are your greatest nights. The sun is up when you get home, thats just a way of life. Apartment 1503, some couches and paintings. When you record with 2 others that want the same things. Yeah, it start to feel better than home feels. And so you up there every night you swear you getting close. That champagne money was for gas and phone bills. But sh-t you bout to spend it on what matters most. . You drop a couple songs and hopes that you can beat a ni--a. And come out every night to let the city see the ni--a. Telling stories that nobody relate to. And even though they hate you they just keep on telling you they feel ya ni--a. [Hook - The Weeknd]. I'm faded too long, oooh. Still I'm Faded too long, ooooh. Still I've been faded too long. I been faded too long. The ride. [Drake]. I haven't been inside terminal 1 and 3 in so long. I'm driving right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on. That runway can be cold especially after summers rolled on. And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs. Performance out the years, got you asking whats good at home. Whats good at home?. The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known. My young ni--as poppin' M's and sippin' dirty jones. Problem children that all be reppin' Octobers Own. Brand new girl, and she still growing. Brand new titties, stitches still showing. Yeah and she just praying that it heals good. I'm bout to f-ck and I'm just praying that it feels good. I really don't know much but sh-t I know a secret. They say more money more problems, my ni--a don't believe it. I mean sure there's some bills and taxes I'm still evading. But I blew 6 million on my self and I feel amazing. Young money maker, season ticket holder. Season switching over. I come through them bitches still scorching as if I didn't notice. You ni--as gettin' older, I see no threat in Yoda. I'm out here messing over the lives of these ni--as. That couldn't f-ck with my freshman flow. Look at that f-cking chip on your nephews shoulder. My sophomore they was all for it, they all saw it. My Juniors and senior will only get meaner. Take Care ni--a. [Hook - The Weeknd]. I'm faded too long, oooh. Still I'm Faded too long, ooooh. Still I've been faded too long. I been faded too long. The ride"
the winner,"[Verse 1]. I’m performin' tonight you know that shit gon be packed. Pay me in advance and make sure that it’s exact. My ex girl’ll probably show up for the simple fact. That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack. But fuck that though, this about me. They say my whole fan base is missing id. But the young trend setting musician I be. Got critics giving up the recognition I de-serve. Never bring yo mrs. By me I’m it I’m it call me Mr. I T. If I get one wish I'mma wish to die free. They say gon head, ball like mrs. ivory, And I do.

Fans see me out and they holla happy belated. It’s about time that you made it. I was bumping yo songs when nobody else played it. When I was up in hot ?? in atlanta steady giving daps. Fetching niggas drinks but I never got to rap?. If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped. But I can’t sign nothing til my lawyer get the fax and. no one decides who the definition of talent is. and mrs. murry look at what my talent did. and what yo business is. Its been a couple years. Guess it’s not about who you know, it’s just how you balance it. It’s always awkward to dummy a nigga artist. And get on someone song when you know you comin the hardest. Its how you start actin when nobody can reach ya. My plan just hatched, happy easter. [Chorus]. I’m doing it big. Look at what I done. Look at where I’m is. It’s only just begun. Cause I was staying home. When they was having fun. So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won. And this is how my speech goes.

Uhh, ok I do it for the love. Bunk bed flow, always one level above. If I’m in ya starting five you will never need a sub. And I’m neva looking down so i always know wassup.. A lot of people sayin fuck me. Problem is they be telling everybody but me. But I always got a Starbucks verse. Being brewed too hot please please double cup me. They never gave me support like chuck t’s. And I never trust a nigga sayin trust me. Nick cannon and will neva did it this ill. So you tell … don’t you dare interrupt me. Thanks to my mother for never giving up. You deserve the world, now gon' live it up. Thanks to uncle steve my hero who always saved us. I could never give back everything you gave us. [Bridge]. And to my dad even though we was apart. I couldn’t leave you out, you forever in my heart. Yeah, and in the name of Evelyn Cher. I’ll forever forgive anybody that never was there. For me, no other woman could ever compare. My angel I hope heaven’s prepared for whenever you there. [Verse 4]. Uhh, I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario coming through ya stereo. Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go. Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go. And this verse deserve a burial. Don’t cry for me this ain’t motha fucking mario. Yeah, and polo isn’t at my session. It’s the anticipation keeping everybody guessing like. [Chorus]. Look at what I done. Look at where I’m is. It’s only just begun. Cause I was staying home. When they was having fun. So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won. And this is how my speech goes. I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit. That’s all I got to say. At the top is where I stay. And tell my haters never go away. Enviada por: Caio Moraes"
these days,"I've been out walking. I don't do too much talking these days. These days. These days I seem to think a lot. About the things that I forgot to do. These days. I've met some women. I wish I had resisted these days. These days. These days I seem to think. About how I have failed. To change all of my ways. These days. Yeah, I had a lover. Don't think I'd risk another. These days. These days. And if I seem to be afraid. Just listen to the life I've made in songs. These days. I've stopped the dreaming. I don't do too much scheming. These days. These days.

too good (feat. rihanna),"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, look. I don't know how to talk to you. I don't know how to ask you if you're okay. My friends always feel the need. To tell me things. Seems like they're just happier than us these days. Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you. I don't know how to be there when you need me. It feels like the only time you see me. Is when you turn your head to the side. and look at me differently. Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience. Last night I got high as the expectations. Last night, I came to a realization. And I hope you can take it. I hope you can take it. I'm too good to you. I'm way too good to you. You take my love for granted. I just don't understand it. No, I'm too good to you. I'm way too good to you. You take my love for granted. I just don't understand it. I don't know how to talk to you. I just know I found myself getting lost with you.

No, I'm too good to you. I'm way too good to you. You take my love for granted. I just don't understand it. Years go by too fast. I can't keep track. How long did we last?. I feel bad for asking. It can't end like this. We gotta take time with this. Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it. Let me see if this is something we can fix. You got somebody other than me. Don't play the victim when you're with me. Free time is costing me more than it seems. Sacrificing things. And I wanna tell you my intentions. I wanna do the things that I mention. I wanna benefit from the friendship. I wanna get the late night message from you, from you. I put my hands around you. Gotta get a handle on you. Gotta get a handle on the fact that. I'm too good to you. I'm way too good to you. You take my love for granted. I just don't understand it. No, I'm too good to you. I'm way too good to you. You take my love for granted.

too much (feat. sampha),"Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much. There's no need for us to rush this through. Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much. This is more than just a new lust for you. Don't think about it. Done sayin' I'm done playin'. Last time was on the outro. Stuck in the house, need to get out more. I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraisin'. Most people in my position get complacent. Come places with star girls, end up on them front pages. I'm quiet but I just ride with it. Moment I stop havin' fun with it, I'll be done with it. I'm the only one that's puttin' shots up. And like a potluck, you need to come with it. Don't run from it, H-Town in the summer time. I keep it 100. Lot of girls in my time there, word to Paul Wall. not one fronted. Birthed there in my first year. man I know that place like I come from it. Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like.

No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'. There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'. Look, I did not sign up for this. My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list. And now he's actin' like ""Oh well, this is life. I guess not, fuck that shit"". Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do. You gotta trust that shit. Heard once that in dire times when. You need a sign. that's when they appear. Guess since my text message didn't resonate. I'll just say it here. Hate the fact. my mom cooped up in her apartment. Tellin' herself. That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit. like that's true shit. All my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round. Started treatin' me like I'm ""him"" now. Like we don't know each other. We ain't grow together, we just friends now. Shit got me feelin' pinned down. Pick the pen up and put the pen down. Writin' to you from a distance like a pen pal. But we've been down. Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much. There's no need for us to rush this through. Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much. This is more than just a new lust for you. Don't give up, on your hopes. Don't you tell me somethin's gone wrong. Wholehearted, wholehearted. You care, you care. Cause I'm such a dreamer.

tuscan leather,"(Verso 1). Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record. Just to off these records, nigga that's a record. I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure. Past the present when you have to mention. This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though. Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go. Heavy airplay all day with no chorus. We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this. for all of my borough niggas. I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga. I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga. Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga. I could go a hour on this beat, nigga. I'm just as famous as my mentor. But that's still the boss, don't get sent for. Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet. you wasn't meant for. Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more. Hot temper, scary outcome. Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one. That always let they mouth run. Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it. Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it. Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smelling like a brick. Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit. Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich. Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup. (Verso 2). Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV. Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me. Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me. I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family. Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'. I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it. I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it. Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me. when I'm trippin'. On a mission tryna shift the culture. Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit. Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'. All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments. Fuck what you think, I'm too busy. that's why you leave a message. Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive. That shit I heard from you lately. really relieved some pressure. Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort. I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless. I don't change like credentials. you know you see the necklace. My life's a completed checklist. I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now. Just give it time. we'll see who's still around a decade from now. That's real. [Verse 3]. How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?. Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento. I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo. The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk. Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow. This for shorty up on Glen Grove. who love when I catch my tempo. I sip the [?] and listen to Cappadonna. The Fresh Prince just had dinner with Tatiana, no lie. All these 90's fantasies on my mind. The difference is that with mine. they all come true in due time. I might come through without security to check if you're fine. That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO. Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself"". You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself. And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help. You know, back on your feet and shit. Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit. How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?. How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?. Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorcese. And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me. now real nigga wassup. How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?. [Outro]. As hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoying yourself?. If we may we'd just like to close off. with something a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all. Are having the same fears. shedding similar tears. and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something. some food for thought"
"two birds, one stone","Yeah. Yeah, more. Yeah. More time with family and friends, more life. More time to get it right. It's only me but I'm seeing. Four shadows in the light. My demons visit me every night. To the most high I'm forever indebted. I know I gotta pay something. I know that day's coming. I put it all in the music. Because if I don't say it here. Then I won't say nothing. Could feel my hand getting tired. From holding the grudges. Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazing. I need to start losing my shit. Just to show you niggas who hatin'. Too reserved like I called ahead. For me and my lady. Free c5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting. Ever since the blue basement. I found god and I lost patience. Between rocks and hard places of all places. Spotted everywhere like dalmation. Cops snoop around cause all my dogs famous. Please welcome the october fall baby. Vaughan road academy. Star player-my mind's not all there. Used to carry a lot of dead weight. Like a pallbearer. People too scared to tell. The truth so it's all dares. Count it, it's all there and we all square. Quick money, I'm in and out. My dad used to use a soap bar. Till it's thinning out. But shit, look at dennis now. All stacy adams and linnen'd out. More blessings for sandy and him, more life. My parents never got it right, but. God bless 'em both, I think we all alike. We all wide awake late at night. Thinking on what to change. If we do get to do it twice. In a another life. Scared to go to sleep now. Cause being awake is. What all my dreams were like. Back when the bar I set for myself. Was out of sight. Tell me how I went and did chin ups. On this shit when I can't see it. Pin ups of meagan good and pam grier. Soul sisters. Inspired my old scriptures. Now that feeling gone like them old pictures. Mixing liquors got us both twisted. Words get so vicious, you just stare at me. While you roll swishers. Girl I love you, but I don't miss you. And no matter what year it is I'm an old 6'er. Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school man. Fuck the rap game, it's all lies. And it's all filthy. 2 Percent of us rich and the rest. Of these niggas all milk it. Got two of my niggas off with a not guilty. Gave back to the city and never said it. If I didn't live it but still they try. To tell you I'm not the realest. Like I'm some privileged kid. That never sat through a prison visit. Or like it was just handed to me tied. With a ribbon. I never worked to get it. But really it's you. With all the drug dealer stories. That's gotta stop though. You made a couple chops. And now you think you chapo. If you ask me though you. Ain't lining the trunk with kilos. You bagging weed watching pacino. With all your niggas. Like ""this what we need to be on. But you never went live. You middle man in this shit. Boy you was never them guys. I can tell cause I look. Most of you dead in your eyes. And you'll be trying to sell that story. For the rest of your lives. Can't show us where the cash is. Me, I don't judge. I'm just going off what the math is. Numbers inflated. They all look at me like. What have you done for me lately?. I like your older shit. But wasn't in love with the latest"". Awe baby, stop debating, I'm just a creative. My numbers out of this world. No wonder they got me feeling so alienated. You were the man on the moon. Now you just go through your phases. Life of the angry and famous. Rap like I know I'm the greatest. Then give you the tropical flavors. Still never been on hiatus. You stay xanned and perked up. So when reality set in. You don't gotta face it. I'm down 200 in vegas. But winning life on a daily basis. It seems like nobody wants. To stay in my good graces. I'm like a real estate agent. Putting you all in your places. Look what happens soon. As you talk to me crazy. Is you crazy?"
u with me?,"[Intro: Dmx]. What these bitches want from a nigga?. [Verse 1]. On some Dmx shit. I group Dm my exes. I told 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever. And I think we just get closer when we're not together. You tell me that I'm confusin'. More Immature than Marques Houston. Cut's too deep for a band-aid solution. We too deep in this thing to never lose me. Lolol I'm glad you find this shit amusin'. Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off. I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras. I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars. That's why she's always correctin' me. when my time is off. And my house is the definition. Of alcohol and weed addiction. You got a different vision. You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen. Without runnin' into one of my niggas. That's not the way we livin'. Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic. These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em. And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people. But every time we speakin'. [Hook]. It's like a lot of games bein' played. How's it goin' down?. If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now. Is you wit' me or what?. Yeah. It's like a lot of games are bein' played. How's it goin' down?. If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now. Is you wit' me or what?. Yeah. [Verse 2]. I wanna know how much time. you spent on them paragraphs. Where you're getting me. All that grey in our conversation history, you. Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things. Playin' mind games, we both doin' the same thing. Slide on a late night. You like to slide on a late night. You send them, all you text without an invite. That's that shit that I don't like. We both slide on a late night. Do things in our off time. We both, yeah. Made some mistakes, pon road. Yeah, how's that for real?. You toyin' with it like Happy Meal. 3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still. While you're typin' make sure to tell me. [Hook]. What type of games are bein' played?. How's it goin' down?. If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now. Is you wit' me or what?. Yeah. What type of games are bein' played?. How's it goin' down?. If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now. Is you wit' me or what?. Yeah. [Verse 3]. Remember you was livin' at the London for a month. Service elevator up to 4201. We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front. Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front. That's for sure though, I made a career of reminiscin'. Time got a funny way of tickin'. things are so much different. I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things. Act like you know it, fuck them stories. fuck the shade that they be throwin'. Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need. And on my way to make this go. A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow. A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow. Tryna give your ass the world. You runnin' your fingers through my curls. You knew me when the kid had waves. But that's enough of that. You could never say I came up. and forgot about your ass. And that's some real shit"
underground kings,"[Drake]. Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water. Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape. Probably shouldn't be drivin', it just got so much harder. Can't even see straight, I can't even see straight. Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots. Live a little, cause ni**as die a lot, and lie a lot. But I'm the truth that's right I fucking said it. The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven. You Girl, you right there, you look like you like this sh*t. How'd I know, how'd I know? Guess me on some psychic sh*t. I can tell lie if you asking me my where-abouts. But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about. Reppin' bitches, reppin' bitches bitches. And reppin' reppin' them bitches until all of us switches. I swear, it's been two years since somebody as me who I was. I'm the greatest man I said def before I knew I was. That's whats important, what really happened before this. When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans. Singing ""walking like a man, finger on the trigger. I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown ni**a, ah"". With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves. I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve. That was back in the days, Acura days. I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways. [Hook]. People always ask how I got my nice things. Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king. I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told. Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately i've been on a roll. And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love it. Ni**a, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it. . Ni**a, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it. Ni**a, do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other ni**as). [Drake]. Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance. Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon' tell me that she don't dance. Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good. Do me like the women from my town would. Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors. Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for. Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back. And rich crust with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack. And these ni**as got them diamonds glowing in they mouth. And they rockin' furs like its snowing in the south. And every pretty girl tell me that's the sh*t that she like. So why am I a classic, this is who I'm trying to be like. So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade. As soon I realize that term-end papers they won't get me paid. If I don't nothing I'mma ball. I'm countin all day like a clock on the wall. Yeah need that, making major changes to the life I'm living. I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisions. That was back in the days, Acura days. I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways. [Hook]. People always ask how I got my nice things. Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king. I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told. Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately i've been on a roll. And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love it. Ni**a, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it. Ni**a, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it. Ni**a, do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other ni**as)"

Just peace happiness and love. I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug. Plus the game is in my pocket, n-gga this is what I does. [Chorus - Drake]. I'm about whatever man... F-ck what they be talking about,. They opinon doesn't count,. We the only thing that matters (oooh). So we do it how we do it. All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it. I be up all night... Whole crews in here. Cause I don't really know who I'mma lose this year (oooh). Man I love my team. Man I love my team... I would die for these n-ggas... [Nicki Minaj]. Yo, Drizzy sayin' get her I'ma get her. I get the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter. I got that kinda… wait wait fixate!. Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?. That was just a keep sake. Bought the president the louie presidential briefcase. Never been a cheapskate. We got the Hawks I aint talking about the (?) state. Man for Petes sake scratch that, sweep stakes. (hahahaha). F-ck I look like hoe. I look like yes and you like no. Im a bad bitch I aint never been a mixed breed.. I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed. M M M6 from a M2. I see a lot of rap b-tches on a menu. But I collect 100 thou at the venue. Lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com. And pop bottles with the team until the death of you. [Chorus]. I'm about whatever man... F-ck what they be talking about,. They opinon doesn't count,. We the only thing that matters (oooh). So we do it how we do it. All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it. I be up all night... Whole crews in here. Cause I don't really know who I'mma lose this year (oooh). Man I love my team. Man I love my team... I would die for these n-ggas... [Nicki Minaj]. I mean we don't even rock them shoes if it ain't got a comma on the price tag. I mean, I mean but then again who looks at the price. [Drake]. Oh yeah we in this b-tch. Oww, oww, oww. [Chorus]. I'm about whatever man... F-ck what they be talking about,. They opinon doesn't count,. We the only thing that matters (oooh). So we do it how we do it. All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it. I be up all night... Whole crews in here. Cause I don't really know who I'mma lose this year (oooh). Man I love my team. Man I love my team... I would die for these n-ggas.."

Have you countin money goin dufflebag-crazy,. Sippin on Pink Floyd an puffin Wayne Brady,. Damn, who's line is it anyways,.

The gangsta recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's,. Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus,. Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on,. I wrote this on my iphone so let me drop this ibomb, I palm. The game like it's a spalding ball and take flight. From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great mike,. Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this gon be a great night,. Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white,. Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right,. Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night,. This that major moment you've been waitin on for too long,. The best that ever did it an doin it on a new song,. Ugk an Young Money too strong. Down in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?. [Chorus:]. It's okay [x6]. You can run an tell your friends that. I'm on [x6]. Best believe I understand.

Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy. When you get to where the fuck I'm at. You gotta remind 'em about where you been. About all of the money that done came and went. About the two cents I ain't never spent. When they say you're too famous to pack a gat. I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from. Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone. Stepping on a swisher roach like a stepping stone. Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone. Boy do I smell beef? Mm pheromones. Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns. Trap pumpin' all night like chevron. Suck a nigga dick for a iphone 6. Fuck my nigga terry for a new blackberry. You can get buried for a ounce of katy perry. I was only five but still remember the drought in '87. Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to. play games with 'em. I ain't got no time. Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence. I'm fuckin' her mind. I got, mind control over deebo. Parmesan my panino. Promethazine over pinot.

views,"[Intro: The Winans]. Question is will I ever leave you?. The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no. Question is will I ever leave you?. The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no. [Verse 1]. Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure. And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham. A lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section. Ovo on me while y'all niggas was playing dress-up. And I know who gon' take the fall with me. They right here on call with me, they all with me. You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted. They been saying it's love, but it isn't love, is it?. Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me. I worked at Jd's connections whenever Jason let me. Ceesay's, I was buying fitteds everyday. Kenny's caravan and trying not to catch a stray. I dropped out right before I graduate. Six credits left, my mama had a saddest day. ""It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait"". And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say. Lately I just feel so out of character. The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance. Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist. I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison. I'm getting straight to the point with it. Need y'all to know. that I never needed none of y'all niggas. Fuck being all buddy buddy with the opposition. It's like a front of the plane, nigga, it's all business. But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute. [Verse 2]. Look, they'd rather run up on me. than towards them goals. My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below. Who you think running this show?. You saw it in me at 20 years old. The lingo start to sound like we talking in code. I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate. You don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made. Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change. Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game. Still drop 40 with liquor in my system. Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance. I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya. Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian. Lamborghini got me feeling like I'm Christian Bale. And I never bare my morals for the ticket sales. Tipping scales, bars heavy like triple Xl. I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself. Running through the 6, storming through the contracts. I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts. They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon. I still got something left to prove since you left me room. Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus. And like it's going in a trunk, I put it all behind us. Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever. I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together. And my life is on display like Truman. They wanna [?] the movements. gotta start to make 'em sooner. My exes made some of my favorite music. I dated women from my favorite movies. Karma's such a thing of beauty. I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it. It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters. I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever. I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you. If I was you, I wouldn't like me either"
we made it freestyle (feat. soulja boy),"(Intro). The only thing I'm seeing I'd like to put an amend on. Perhaps a little more room here for the fixins. Oh, we gon' have a lot of fixins.

Nigga we made it, hey. Damn, we made it. Nigga we made it, hey. We made it, aye. Nigga we made it, hey. We made it. (Drake). She said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office. The head was so good it make sense why you work at the head office. In 2007 I sat in a lobby in Motown and waited. Now I go into the buildin' and go off like ""Nigga we made it! "". When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'. I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments. Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement. It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!. You fly out your lady, I fly out my ladies. Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is. And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous. Imma just hand her a business card and say ""Nigga we made it! "". And she gotta come to the hotel and pop it off for me. Then she gon' text her best friend like ""Girl he got some good dick and money"". Her friend hit her back like ""I know that already, that nigga's amazin'"". Then I send a message to both of they asses like ""Nigga we made it! "". (Interlude). Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down. Seems like motherf*ckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show. Hey. (Refrão). Nigga we made it, hey. We made it. Nigga we made it, hey. Damn, we made it. Nigga we made it, hey. We made it, aye. Nigga we made it, hey. We made it. (Drake). If they with me, just know that they wit' it and 'bout it. If I said it, I meant it, it's no way around it. OVO reps so them [?] next to [?] go crazy. When Baca came home for the holidays, I was like ""N*gga we made it! "". And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it. My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience. My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it. I would just look at you dead in the face and say ""N*gga we made it"". I swear that we made it. But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell yah, I don't need no favors. (Damn, Soulja Boy stunt on them haters). And my resolution for New Years is n*gga we made it. You don't know how long I waited, I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's amazin'. I'm out in the Caymans, rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women we came with. That's ignorant, ain't it? Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the pictures I painted. Then I pick up my brush and I sign at the bottom like ""N*gga we made it"". (Refrão). Nigga we made it, hey. We made it. Nigga we made it, hey. Damn, we made it. Nigga we made it, hey. We made it, aye. Nigga we made it, hey. We made it. (Soulja Boy). Tellin' my partner, and my momma, everything gonna be all good. Nigga we made it! Damn, I'm up in Las Vegas. Damn, I never was supposed to have shit, now my life is lavish. Every night, f*ckin' a bad bitch, nigga we made it!. Coppin' a Lambo, cash, the Bentley, 2 times I crashed. Ha, nigga we made it!. Look at them niggas' faces, them niggas, they hate it. I look a nigga in his face and say ""Nigga we made it! "". Soulja Boy stunt on them haters. And these days I don't need no favors. Nigga we made it!"
we'll be fine,"[Drake]. Yeah, never thoughts of suicide I'm too alive. But I still treat it likes it's do or die. Even though dying isn't in the plans, but neither was making it and here I am. In the presidential do you like your new room?. Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon. Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon, she deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it. That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street. Got a new condo, move it to the beach. Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib. Goddamn man she's beauty and the beast (Lord). Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming. Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing. The fam here, the drink here, the girls here?. Well f*ck let's get it then. [Hook].

You keep talking that ""You was this and you had this and you deserve some f*cking credit how did anyone forget it."". Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line and the line around the corner it's my motherf*cking time. You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now. I wouldn't doubt it because these bitches all about it right now. Let's be real about this sh*t, can I take you home? Or come to where you stay?. Do you live on your own? I heard you got your ways, I never would have known. She said ""your such a dog"" I said ""your such a bone."". I've been everywhere, where you know me from?. These days women give it to me like they owe me one. But they crave attention though they always saying ""Show me something."". But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one. At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that. Then fuck let's get it then. [Hook]. I'm trying to let go of the past. Should we make this one a double?. Ye ain't even gotta ask, Ahh. Because it's hard to say no (say no). Yeah it's hard to say no. Are you down? Are you down? Yeah you all the way down, everytime. Am I down? Am I down? Yea I'm all the way down. We'll be fine.

wednesday night interlude (feat. partynextdoor),"Been a minute since we've slept together. Gotta get myself together. I've been thinkin' about everything. I don't know if it's because I'm lonely.

weston road flows,"[Verse]. One of them ones. Right. Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny. Back when we couldn't buy pizza. cause we were down to pennies. Feel like we go back a century. runnin' the store for centuries. Then bring it back to your brother. man we had to respect it. He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement. He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment. Then he would leave us at the house. and go out on a mission. We probably would've got in less trouble. just goin' with him. Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know. Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show. I'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those. I mean you boys not even coming close. I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration. You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places. Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear. Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care. No tender love and care and no love and affection. I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it. I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson. Feel like they wanted me dead. but couldn't pull it together. Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester. 40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure. A couple nights where it started to feel. like the feelings faded. A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation. Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day. You treat me like I'm born yesterday. you forgot my birthday. You don't be scorin' perfect. you don't be workin' like how we be workin'. You platinum like rappers on Hershey's boy. that shit is worthless. You get the message over and over like it was urgent. And then act like you ain't heard it. when you see me in person. The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in. And did it with a purpose. Used to have secret handshakes. to confirm my friendships. Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension. A lot of people just hit me up. When my name is mentioned. Shout out to Kd we relate we get the same attention. It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder. The most successful rapper 35 and under. I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under. That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded. Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin. She violated, I sent her back where it all started. How quick they are to forget. about their bachelor apartment. Leave it to niggas like you. to show em' light in the darkness. Told my Momma that I found a lady in the east. Came cool when I got signed, upgraded the suite. Don Julio in the freezer they gave us for free. I get you all you can eat. just have some patience with me. You wouldn't tell me you loved me. started seein' Monique. Last time I heard from Monique. T-Minus was makin' beats. I used to hit the corner store to get to [?]. Now the talk of the corner store is that I'm Tbe. The best ever, don't ever question, you know better. But shit ain't always how it seems. when it's sowed together. Yeah, I let that last line breathe, take a second to get it. Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled. Don't get hyped for the moment then start to back peddle. Don't let your new found fame. fool you or cloud up your judgement. To talk loosely, I really do this. Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter. was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit. Drinkin' hypnotic with Glenn Louis I been through it. Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it. To busy face screwin' on waste movements. You had to ride Ttc metro, I had the place boomin'. First take Drake, I rarely have to take two it. And they still take to it. Big Apple had the white hummer parked. right in front of Fluid. And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it. But money can't buy happiness, jelly be talkin' truthful. But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want. Get high when I want. Yeah, that's right"
what if i kissed you,"[Drake]. What if I kissed you right now. how would we explain it. trying to imagine how it might sound. if I just yelled out. What if I kissed you right now. would it bring us any closer. take a weight off our shoulders. take me I’m yours. and I don’t really care who knows it. can you afford to be open with all these emotions. if you were a secret how long could you keep it. lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com. keep it to yourself don’t tell nobody else. not a problem (?). and you just be mine. and you just be mine. and you just be mine (just, just be mine).

But I just, I just tell myself this one thing. [Verse: Drake]. It was worth it. It was all worth it. And by this time I understand that I ain't perfect. There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased. And I was on some shit but they served they purpose. And I got verses. I got verses. My 16s should be arriving in hearses. They get bodied, you see how I murk this. I switch flows much as my girl switch purses. Yeah heartbreak Drake I'll put it on your wife. If I put it in a verse then I put it on my life. Liquor that's over ice and denim that's overpriced. And tryna' make all my goals for the future come overnight. God-god-god-god damn how time soars. I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors. Come over watch a season of Flight of the Concords. And I try to put some lotion all over your contours. But uh, tell me you surfin' let me know you on board. You can't seal up the bottle once all of the Dom's poured. Yes I swear to God girl I put it on Lord. I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Ford's. Ethiopian girl Ethiopian girl. With yo' long curly hair and yo' big ass bootay. Reading all them pro black pro female books. Just let 'em let 'em know that you ain't no groupie. You need a prescription a vision correction. I'm young and successful. I'm living perfection. And mayne if '09 is when I'mma see mine.

It's about us right now, girl, where you going?. It's about us right now, girl, where you going?. I'm with you. It's about us right now, girl, where you going?.

I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave. And its back to L. A. Open the mail, staring at the check. Enough to make you throw up. Man it's gross what I net.

wu-tang forever,"(refrão). I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten. We used to be friends, girl, and even back then. You would look at me with no hesitation. And you'd tell me baby, it's yours. Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours. Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that. Well, made me think about the game, girl. And how I switched it up with a new thang. Young nigga came through on his wu-tang. And nowadays when I ask about who got it. They say it's yours. Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours. Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours. It's yours, that's for sure. (ponte). How you feel about, coming home with a. Nigga for the night?. If you nervous, hit the lights. I know we only fucking out of spite. Cause your man don't do you right. Do you right, I could fuck you so good. Then I hit you with the 9 a. m. In dallas who you like, baby, who you like. (verso 1). Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back. Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map. I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first. It's about who did it right, niggas looking like ""preach"". Open cases on me for a half a million each. I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets. I know, luckily I didn't have to grow there. I would only go there cause there's niggas that I know there. I don't know what's getting into me. I just like the rush. When you see your enemy somewhere in the club. And you realize he just not in a position. To reciprocate your energy. You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be. People like mazin who was a best friend to me. Start to become a distant memory. Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy. And fucking with me mentally, I think it's meant to be. Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys. But you gotta understand when it's yours. They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice. (refrão). I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten. We used to be friends, girl, and even back then. You would look at me with no hesitation. And you'd tell me baby, it's yours. Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours.

you & the 6,"(Verso 1). Having conversations with mama, man my life is a mess. Ain't been returning the texts. so she been reading the press. She got google alerts, them shits go straight to her phone. She worry bout me from home. you know she raised me alone. She said ""I heard you back with you know who"". I told her ""Girl I'm always back with you know who"". And she like ""Who are we kidding"". ""You're only 27 you just being you"". ""You're your fathers child man. thank god you got some me in you"". At least I always, at least I always see it through. At least I'm always being true to what you taught me. Retired teacher but your words still got me evolving. Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving. And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends. And assistants always convinced. that there's always someone better. Like that girl from that gym who trains you. I know you wanna arrange it. you told me she's free thursday. And I'm sure that she's a angel but she don't want this life. The timing ain't right. Maybe one day but even one day with us is a time of a life. We do things that people pay to document. You got the sweetest heart. but I'm not here to give out compliments. or boost nobody confidence momma. I got no friends in this momma. I don't pretend with this momma. I'on joke with this momma. I pull the knife out my back. and cut they throat with it momma. I'm ""Game of Thrones"" with it momma. I'm "" Home Alone"" with it momma. I'm t. I really hate using this tone with you momma. I really hate getting aggressive. on this phone with you momma. I really hate wasting your time. to check a clone or two momma. It's just they cloning me momma. Them niggas wannabes momma. Its like - I'm the one they wanna be momma. I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable momma. I mean I kill em every time they do a song with me momma. I sing a hook they sing along with me momma. What more they want from me momma?. Yeah, this is a crazy life. But you and the six raised me right. ""Don't ever take advice, "" that was great advice. You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life. (Verso 2). Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad. You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window. That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club. Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love. That nigga memphis for real, girl he love you to death. He made mistakes throughout his life. that he still doesn't accept. But he just want our forgiveness. and fuck it look how we living. I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?. At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like. I used to rap on the phone, one of his friends doing life. And now I got me a Grammy. that could be part of the reason. Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in. Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?. Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny shit. could've gone south for me. he looked out for me ma. He never let me do drugs. He let me shoot a gun one summer. but out there everyone does. He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music. Shit that can only be created if you go through it. I used to get teased for being black, and now I'm here and. I'm not black enough. Cause I'm not acting tough. or making stories up bout where I'm actually from. But I just roll with it momma, rolling stone with it momma. Gotta be careful around rolling stones. or anyone that's tryna. throw stones at me momma. I'm not condoning it momma. They will not tear nothing down. I built this home for you momma. Know I don't call enough momma. I just been working with so little time for personal momma. Hard labor let me pay the price. You and the six raised me right that shit saved my life"

You done seen me out, you gets no hello,. And you wonder why? Man you know you know,. Yeah and you should let them boys know too,. Show them n-ggas every single thing I showed you,. I'm here feeling like 50 back in ?02,. And everybody sayin I'm the man (big mike), so true,. Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?. A place with wooden floors and space to put awards,. A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores,. The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore,. Well i got it, i got it,. I wonder if id be happy without it, i doubt it,. I try not to really think about it,. I made it but I'm still playin like I'm bein scouted til I'm outted,. Game top bitch, i hope You're proud of us,. King james sh-t watch me throw the powder up,. This old g got my whole suite cloudin up,. But i bet you i be out of time before I'm out of luck,. They ain't routin' for me, they ain't clappin for me,. I'm only sayin' can somebody just be happy for me,. I really hate to say i told you so,. So i bite my tongue but you know you know,. [hook]. . [drake - verse 2]. Uhh, please make your long story shorter,. This time is for the essence for the king of first quarter,. Numbers do the talkin i have nothing for reporters,. I just hope we make these flights and don?t get held up at the border,. Yeah so you can spare me all the accolades,. I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page,. Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid,. And I'm still spendin money from my actin days,. Damn, life is such a lovely thing,. Feel the perks that a 7 digit budget bring,. Tell your girlfriend that i can pull some f-ckin strings,. So were courtside when lebron get a f-ckin ring,. Yeah, i bet i be there i be there,. You see that ?62 sittin outside? Thats me there,. I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare,. Putting in that overtime i never said it be fair,. I'm always left wishin i could have done it in person,. My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin,. I got new girls but none of they love is for certain,. And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin,. Damn what happened to us?. Life can always change, you have to adjust,. How come when i got a party you stare at me in disgust?. If it is just to have fun you should see that as a plus,. Especially when i come flyin through the door. And kindly ignore the paparazzi outside and tryin to record,. Why has every woman never dined her before?. Am i the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?. The rothschild?s, the cru?s, the ?caias and the opuses [wine brands]. It's always nice when You're out with someone that notices,. My condo got that art gallery openness,. I'm just really hopin that that isn?t what the motive is,. They ain't routin for me, they ain't clappin for me,. I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me,. I really hate to say i told you so,. So i bite my tongue but you know you know. Por NanLopes"
