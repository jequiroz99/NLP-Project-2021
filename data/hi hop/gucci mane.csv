A bunch of elves on the team and I gotta feed em. They carry sawed off pumps so it's hard to feed em. I gift wrap a pipe bomb, bring it to your door. Ring the bell sit back and watch the fucker blow. So how you build the snowman with all this melted snow. Santa clause bringing blocks in from Mexico. I made a hundred thousand dollars and the Texaco. They locked me up and let me out I feel like Plaxico. I'm going in on these suckers call me santa clause. And its a bunch of bad bitches in Santa house. An igloo full of snow and a white stove. I'm in the kitchen cooking dope in a white robe. House full of naked hoes snortin blow. I'm in zone 6 aka the north pole. It's so lonely at the top plus it's real cold. My ears, neck, wrist fist is real froze. A house full of hoes and they cooking blow. I'm in zone 6 aka the north pole"

It's Bankhead Brick Squad out in U.K., these niggaz ain't fuckin with me. Mob up off that run day, SK's, AK's. Throwaways I let that triple up like {?} triple beam we crackin. [Chorus]. [8Ball]. Gucci Mane, Waka Flocka and ya boy big Ball. Hard from the start; I ain't never been no fuckin lame. Here I go with Waka Flocka,. here I go with Gucci Mane. One of a kind - that Memphis 10 runnin through my bloodstream. Ghetto superstar - man them hood bitches love me. Cup full of that ol' purple drank, pullin on some of that stanky dank. Pocket full of Benny Frank and bitch, what the fuck you thank?. 45 hollowheads in my stout, yellow purt{?}. I hope one of these ol' bitch bitch-ass niggaz don't cross that line and get hurt. Money what we came to get, money what we represent. You ain't talkin 'bout shit if you ain't talkin 'bout gettin it. Hard hustle never fold, forever I will be cold. Forever I will be big Ball, mouth full of gold. [Chorus]"

Eight hunnid' got a nigga whole safe on me. And I'm marching with the bands fam, you want me. It's a battle of the bands in the vip. And she say she go to class but she dance at t's. I dare anybody here to put their hands on me?. Put the stick up, kids want to kidnap me. Got a sig on me, are you kidding me?. A little freak lied and tried to put a kid on me. And my own homeboys called the pigs on me. But my faith got stronger and my money grew longer. Sold all my artists now, gucci mane a fucking loner. I'm a part time rapper, I'm a full time owner. Breaking rules and bending corners. Crack your head with a corona. [hook]. Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces. When it all falls apart we pick up the pieces. Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces. Just hit the streets, hit my jeweler and pick up the pieces. Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces. Break a brick down then pick up the pieces.

Bad lil' standing in vip, we run off in luxury. Throwing money ain't nothing to me. I'm just giving these broke ho's something to see. 2pac all eyez on me, 2chainz yeah, feds watching me. To live crew, gucci two times hit one. Too many bitch and I might be. Haters talking don't worry me, all they do is encourage me. I'm a worldwide executive, neighborhood celebrity. Ain't nothing in this world gon' stop me from getting currency. These bad bitches cherish me, lil' niggas look up to me. Put my ap and my rollie on when they bury me. Scared of me, you better be. Tell me who ain't heard of me. I just offed another hundred piece. Bought a watch for eighty g. [hook]. Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces. When it all falls apart we pick up the pieces.

rooftop,Intro. Chorus. Tell me what you wanna do?. What you wanna do?. I got killas on the rooftop all on the rooftop. Who you wanna shoot but I dont wanna go back. You dont wanna do that why you gotta prove that?. What you gotta prove these niggas better move back. Shoes come in two stacks ima take a few back. What you wanna do? im choking on that fruit pack. Why would you woo that?. Crazy color coupe what you wanna do?. Verse. Sippin absolut (eghh). Im walkin from the car line straight to the boost. So my swagger through the roof. I got money too. This what money do. My shoes came from the zoo. My cane came from peru. My car paint pyroon. Piss body say sawoo. My earrings came in blue. We walk in different hues. See me on the news. My lawyer is a jew. In case you wanna sue. I got alot of scoons. Your beef aint nothing new. I pull up in a coupe. Same color as a suit. And I aint got on a suit. I pull up blossom blue. My rim right by the pool. I said look at the view. Tell me what you wanna do. Chorus. Tell me what you wanna do?. What you wanna do?. I got killas on the rooftop all on the rooftop. Who you wanna shoot but I dont wanna go back. You dont wanna do that why you gotta prove that?. What you gotta prove these niggas better move back. Shoes come in two stacks ima take a few back. What you wanna do? im choking on that fruit pack. Why would you woo that?. Crazy color coupe what you wanna do?. Verse. Them bitch detergent riding dirty is you nervous. Conduct yourself one class on me tasha dont disturb me. Describe your body you're like a circus you're unreliable. I want the cash the car all the girls im entitled to. My white grand like them rich white girls back then. Ass banquets like paying texas on a back hand. Gucci mane air train how I fly the hoes in. Would be my good friend till I put my golds in. Now ive crossed the globe boy I stick my nose in. Ten thousand diamond dollar loafers I put my toes in. Fresh boy the post man the books are closed. They might not re-open cause you niggas is hoes. Chorus. Tell me what you wanna do?. What you wanna do?. I got killas on the rooftop all on the rooftop. Who you wanna shoot but I dont wanna go back. You dont wanna do that why you gotta prove that?.

servin,"[Verse 1:]. I use to trap on the corner but that was decades ago. I was high as a cloud and that was seconds ago. I had the game in the lock a couple records ago. And I aint never trust nobody I would check in the door. And if you spend a living molding your necklace will glow. He see me textin the phone and I aint choking the hoe. But he keep talkin bout a gangsta, he put fault in the hoe. I gave my dentist a 50 just for my trophies to show. I look like Pablo Escobar the way Im holding the drow. I feel like Bunklin George. I got so many bills from the plug. I got a suite apartment in the part mit under the rug. And every drank in my frigerator filled up with mud. [Hook:]. I dont know bout nobody else but I dont servin. And as long as these bads come in Im gonna circle. Niggas say they aint getting money but I dont work it. Im runnin with so much dough that Im nervous. If the police tryina pull up on me Im gonna swerve em. You aint never seen so many guns on one person. Dump truck, 2 trucks came on one person. You need to switch up the shit you doin, just aint working. [Verse 2:]. They got me feeling like me, no couple mill in the safe. But when snitched at the end, it was a slap in the face. I need a bitch like Keyshia, shout your mill of the day. And Puggy smoke, what the fuck G minor. put some trust in the J. 13 thousand dollars worth of narcotics. wrapped in some tape. I spent 130 thousand dollars just on my drapes. I got a coke model, supermodel feedin me grapes. And you can keep the money nigga. cause your payment too late. And you aint coming with me nigga. you tryina run in the way. Youre just a spy telling lies, tryina look at our play. You call me country to my face, I hit your ass with this K.

"trick or treat (feat. slim dunkin, wooh the kid & waka flocka)","[Intro]. [car peeling out] [car revs then peels out]. (""Listen to the track bitch!"") It's Gucci. Funky feet (funky feet) funky feet. Pull up with that stupid beat, orange Camaro trick or treat. Stupid geek (tweakin) it's super street. It's a Super Sport nigga, trick or treat. [Gucci Mane]. I flee the broads, stars and cars look like they just broke in the mall. Home girl seen my auto mall and said let's go and have a ball. Hold applause change your drawers, Big Gucci not Santa Clause. Young'uns might just break the law, whole Squad be like ""Damn the law"". If what you seen ain't what you saw, Scary Movie, Saw 3. East Atlanta, whassup Santa, Alabama ride with me. Glock nine on me, hot rod lonely. Gucci ridin double wides, tractor-trailers, ponies. What'chu mean? Bag of beans, same boy from the magazines. Two AK's three magazines, make a stupid horror scene. Orange Ferrari, purple trees, whippin like on gold D's. Pimpin like I'm Goldie, listenin to the oldies. It's Gucci!. [Chorus]. Funky feet (funky feet) funky feet. Pull up with that stupid beat, orange Camaro trick or treat. Stupid geek... it's super street. It's a Super Sport nigga, trick or treat. Look at me, nigga look at me. Pull up in my new Ferrari, pull up and say trick or treat. And after a week, I cop another skreet. A pretty car, nigga, trick or treat. [Wooh Da Kid]. Okay our whip, our feet, ridin down our street. But got the broma{?}er'y T, turn your wife into a freak. Snatch the mighty iron whip, I gotta eat nigga. You lookin sweet nigga {click clack} trick or treat nigga. Trunk on thunder, candy paint mumble. Why your tint so dark? Bitch I'm ridin under. This Brick Squad, nigga what it do. Ye ain't Brick Squad pussy nigga who is you?. Money over e'rythang, even you. If the General call then you better shoot. BLAK BLAK BLAK BLAK BLAK, you know the dump. Wooh Da Kid and Guc' truth gon' pop the trunk. [Chorus]. [Slum Dunkin]. Louis Vuitton, come take a flick. You ain't takin shit, but you can take a click. It's a nightmare when I pop up. Got the top cut wit'cho lady chick. We super geeked, I'm hella high. Her mouth wet but mine stupid dry. I'm movin slow like a zombie. while she woppin me, she boppin me. Got black ice, call me Black Ice, really heavy around my neck. I just blackout, call me Blackout, look and shot at a nigga that flex. Now I'm bustin at him, I'm gunnin at him. He runnin real quick with those funky feet. He dead man, I'm toe taggin. I'm a black bag him in white sheets. I'm a flatline him, it's over with. And he ain't comin back, no heartbeat (ADIOS!). Brick Squad some rude boys. Don't play around, don't fuck with them. I pull up on your block. Let some shots off, you stuck with them. I'm a G-A, N-G, S-T, A. [Chorus]. [Waka Flocka Flame]. All these {?} girls call me wantin to fuck. And Monique {?} the old ladies wanna fuck me. I poke you to death like Chucky. Came up in one year they say I'm lucky, FLOCKA!. Semi little hussy {?} that's a get money getter. All my girls got Waka Flocka on they {?}. Don't need a school girl, need a down-ass slut.

Say Flock can't rap, I don't motherfuckin care. FLOCKA!. [Chorus]"
truth (not a jeezy diss),"Explain [Verse 1]. 80 chains going and ain't took one yet. Ain't nothing retarded 'bout Gucci but this gold Rolex. A ten thousand dollar bounty put on my neck. I hope you didn't pay them cause they didn't have no success. You seen my interview nigga and you got upset. I seen your interview too, you looked oh so stressed. I think the nigga just mad cause I fucked his ex. And I'm a big dog, he got the lil' boy complex. Go dig your partner up nigga, bet he can't say shit. And if you looking for the kid I'll be in Zone 6. I hit a birthday party fresh, you and ya homeboy Tip. I know y'all seen me over there with that black fo' fifth. I bought a Bentley Mulsanne, it look just like Tip's. But I never went platinum, do you catch my drift. I never let a nigga do me like Tip did Flip. This the same shit that got Big and 2Pac killed. [Interlude]. For the record, this is not a diss record. Just the truth. It's Gucci the living legend. Oh, yea I'm a legend. Living legend nigga. Respect that. [Verse 2]. I ain't playing wit ya, I ain't trying to dance wit ya. I ain't using hands, let them rubberbands get ya. It take money to go to war and we can go to war nigga. I ain't no real rapper, I'm a fucking grave digger. I'm a old school fool, don't make me show my age nigga. Grab a Louisville and turn it to a batting cage nigga. I did a song with Keyshia Cole and I know you still miss her. But Puff was fucking her while you was falling in love wit her. Call you to do a song, wouldn't even smoke no bud wit ya. I was screaming so icy and was a neighborhood nigga. This AR is my back up cause I don't need nan nigga. Must didn't hear when Flocka said ""Let them guns blam nigga!"". Used to drive to Birmingham with a lot of grams nigga. I'm just who I am nigga but I ain't sparing nan nigga. I know it's hard for you to sleep knowing you killed your homeboy. You left his son to be a bastard, won't even raise ya own boy. [Outro]"

Baby dancin on me diamonds dancing on me. Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze. What it gonna be. What it ain't gonna be. Don't dare anybody here to put their hands on me. Too many stacks on me too many rights on me. Gotta die on my life as what its gonna be be. Come in to leave throwin money high don't care where it reach. Spend 2 g's a week on haircuts like 4,5,6 sometimes a week. These girls petrified they scared to speak. I'm in the new gt with a georgia peach. Gotta condo right out on the florida beach. I ain't hard to reach so nice to meet. Every night we meet you prolly fight with me. Say its fine with me to spend the night with me. No rules everything alright with me. Now shake baby shake just right for me. Catch ball players in magic city. Show them boys how good my jumper is. Ain't no niggas up in here, makin all pros look like amateurs. I just showed my ass last night i had a blast. My jewelery was so white haters put theirs in the trash. Pulled up in some fans just to make them haters mad. Rims with paper tag paper bag full of cash. What it gonna be. What it ain't gonna be. Too many chains on me too many rings on me. Baby dancin on me diamonds dancing on me. Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze. What it gonna be. What it ain't gonna be. Don't dare anybody here to put their hands on me. Too many stacks on me too many rights on me. Got some killa and some gats and money. What it gonna be. What it ain't gonna be. Too many chains on me too many rings on me. Baby dancin on me diamonds dancing on me. Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze. What it gonna be. What it ain't gonna be. Don't dare anybody here to put their hands on me. Too many stacks on me too many rights on me. Gotta die on my life as what its gonna be be. By: pw"
