i'll find you ft. tori kelly,"Just fight a little longer my friend. It's all worth it in the end. But when you got nobody to turn to. Just hold on and I'll find you. I'll find you. I'll find you. Just hold on and I'll find you. I'm hanging on by a thread. And all I'm clinging to is prayers. And every breath is like a battle. I feel like I ain't come prepared. And death's knocking on the front door. Pain is creeping through the back. Fear is crawling through the windows. Waiting for 'em to attack. They say don't get bitter, get better. I'm working on switching them letters. But tell God. I'mma need a whole lot of hope. keeping it together. I'm smilin' in everyone's face. I'm cryin' whenever they leave the room. They don't know the battle I face. They don't understand what I'm going through. The world tryna play with my soul. I'm just tryna find where to go. I'm tryna remember the way. I'm tryna get back to my home. But I can't do this on my own. That's why I'm just trusting in you. Cuz' I don't know where else to go. And I don't know what else to do. Just fight a little longer my friend. It's all worth it in the end. But when you've got nobody to turn to. Just hold on and I'll find you. Just fight a little longer my friend. It's all worth it in the end. But when you've got nobody to turn to. Just hold on and I'll find you. I'll find you. I'll find you. Just hold on and I'll find you. I'll find you. I'll find you. Just hold on and I'll find you. They say fear haunts. And pain hates. I say pain strengthens. And fear drives faith. And I don't know all of the outcomes. Don't know what happens tomorrow. But when that ocean of doubt comes. Don't let me drown in my sorrow. And don't let me stay at the bottom. I feel like this hole is too deep to climb. I've been looking for a way out. But I'll settle for a peace of mind. Picking up the pieces of my life. and hoping that I put together something right. Tell me all I got is all I need. Tell me you gon' help me stand and fight. The world tryna play with my soul. I'm just tryna find where to go. I'm tryna remember the way. I'm tryna get back to my home. But I can't do this on my own. That's why I'm just trusting in you. Cuz' I don't know where else to go. And I don't know what else to do. No don't let the fear. Make you feel like you can't fight this on your own. You know I, I'll be there for you. no matter where you go. You'll never be alone, noo. Just fight a little longer my friend. It's all worth it in the end. But when you've got nobody to turn to. Just hold on and I'll find you. Just fight a little longer my friend. It's all worth it in the end. But when you've got nobody to turn to. Just hold on and I'll find you. I'll find you. I'll find you. Just hold on and I'll find you. I'll find you. I'll find you. Just hold on and I'll find you"
far away,"Far far away far away far away (You feel so). Far far away far away far away. Hopeless!. I can spell it. I can smell it in the air. Lotta people wonder if you still care. And are you still there. Cause I lost it all. I keep calling your name. But do you hear my call. And are you still involved. Or am I left alone. I wander the streets. Cause I no longer have a home. My brothers all gone. My sisters all gone. My family and my friends. Ain't gonna be here in the morning. You see me here mourning. They say you feel my pain. They say you went through it. Say to die is to gain. But I ain't gain nothing. I lost everybody. Now I'm losing my mind. And my faith is all got in. I'm still holding on. That's why I still pray. Feeling empty inside. I can't make it through the day. I don't know what else to do. I don't know what else to say. I'm talking to you now. But I promise that you feel so far. [Chorus] (x4). Far far away (You feel). Far away (You seem). Far away...so so. Dear hope, been waiting on ya for a while now. Been cut so deep that I ain't sure if I can smile now. Look at this devastation. Look at the pain and sorrow. Somebody fed me lies and promised me a bright tomorrow. I know the God I follow. Is bigger than disaster. Big enough to handle. Any evil that harasses us. But I feel like he passed us. Pain overtook us. Buildings tumbled over head. As the ground shook us. God have you forsook us. Lord you still with me. I know you save souls. I trust you to forgive me. Relief can you hear me. Hey Rest can you get me. Hey Peace can you see me. Hey Love can you heal me. I don't know what to do. I ain't looking for answers. I just need you to hold my hand. Through this cancer. Tell me you never left. Even in the midst of death. Breathe on me I'll do anything to feel your breath. [Chorus] (x4). Far far away (You feel). Far away (You seem). Far away...so so. For God alone, O my soul,. Wait in silence, for my hope is from Him.. He is my only rock and my salvation, my fortress. I shall not be shaken.. On God rests my salvation and my glory. My mighty rock, my refuge is God.. Trust in him at all times, people. Pour out your heart before him,. God is a refuge for us.. Far far away (He's not). Far away (No he's not). Far away (Our God's not). Far far away (He's not). Far away (No he's not). Far away (Our God's not). Far far away (He's not). Far away (No he's not). Far away (Our God's not). Even though He seems"
deja vu,"[Intro]. Yeah, the whole world's gone crazy. People riot in the streets. Killin' unborn babies. Catchin' shots from police. [Verse 1]. Never thought that I would see the day. When I would have to pray for God to hold me down. Cause Lord, I feel like giving up today. I feel like giving up the faith. I swear these people fake, I swear they full of hate. I swear to tell the truth 'til I'm in the grave. Shots-shots fired, everybody quiet. Tryna hear the preacher, he ain't preachin' to the choir. Preachin' to the riots that he got fired. He ain't got no medicare, sippin' liquor in his chair. Blank stare, need a blank check, where your bank at?. Babies had a birthday, they gon' need a rain check. Rich man need a vacation, hop a plane. Broke man need a vacation, Mary Jane. Walk outside and everything is lovely. Butterflies in my stomach from this girl I wanna see. Party in the neighborhood and everybody on the street. They was on that Stevie Wonder now it's Frankie Beverly. I done seen days go crazy, time fly by. Maybe it was yesterday or maybe 65. Peace then war, sworn in, die. All too familiar, more lifetimes. [Hook 1]. One time for the memories, two times for the crew. Three times for the love, y'all. And Four times for the truth. And some days are a nightmare. And some dreams come true. But the Lord's still right there. It's just déjà vu. It's just déjà vu, déjà vu. It's just déjà vu, y'all. It's just déjà vu. It feel like Tribe Called Quest, it feel like De La Soul. It feel all too familiar, it feel like déjà vu. [Verse 2]. I said I love you, hit the door. Got a mission, gotta go. Yeah, it's cold, but I'm gon' pursue that. She said she love me but she know. I'm too old to be waiting for handout, boy you knew that. And if they try to keep me down. Hold my ground 'til they all look around. And they wonder, ""Who that? "". They don't respect my mind, they'll respect my grind. So I told her, ""I got to do that"". Now maybe I was talkin' to my lady. But I think I told my mama same thing. I told her I was all about the action. And then I got Ghostface in my dream. Déjà vu, parlez-vous français? Quoi de neuf?. Everything the same under the sun. that's why we burnin' up. Don't believe astrology, but man, I hated cancer. Breast, lung, throat, blood, prayin' for an answer. Seem like it was yesterday. they came and took your breath away. And I ain't get a chance to tell you. everything I want to say. Now they say your sister got it too. Yeah, they say it's true. Guess it's never finished til it's you. Déjà vu. [Hook 2]. One time for the memories, two times for the crew. Three times for the love, y'all. Four times for the truth. Some days are a nightmare. And some dreams come true. But the Lord's still right there. It's just déjà vu, it's just déjà vu. Déjà vu. It's just déjà vu, y'all. It's just déjà vu. [Outro]. It's just déjà vu, déjà vu. It's just déjà vu, y'all. It's just déjà vu.

boasting,"If this life has anything to gain at all. I count it lost if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you. Can't walk this earth alone. I recognize I am not my own, so before I fall. I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone. With every breath I take, with every heart beat,. Sunrise and the moon lights in the dark street. Every glance, every dance, every note of a song. It's all a gift undeserved that I shouldn't have known. Every day that I lie, every moment I covet. I'm deserving to die, I'm just earning your judgment. Ah, without the cross there's only condemnation. If Jesus wasn't executed there's no celebration. So in times that are good, in times that are bad. For any times that I've had at all I will be glad. And I will boast in the cross, I boast in my pains. I will boast in the sunshine, boast in his reign. What's my life if it's not praising you. Another dollar in my bank account of vain pursuit, I do. not count my life as any value or precious at all. Let me finish my race, let me answer my call. If this life has anything to gain at all. I count it lost if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you. Can't walk this earth alone. I recognize I am not my own, so before I fall. I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone. Tomorrow's never promised, but it is we swear. Think we holding our own, just a fist full of air. God has never been obligated to give us life. If we fought for our rights, we'd be in hell tonight. Mere sinners own nothing but a fierce hand. We never loved Him, we pushed away His pierced hands. I rejected His love, grace, kindness, and mercy. Dying of thirst, yet willing to die thirsty. Eternally worthy, how could I live for less?. Patiently you turn my heart away from selfishness. I volunteer for your sanctifying surgery. I know the spirits purging me of everything that's hurting me. Removed the veil from my darkened eyes. So now every morning I open Your Word and see the sunrise. I hope in nothing, boast in nothing, only in your suffering. I live to show Your glory, dying to tell Your story. If this life has anything to gain at all. I count it lost if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you. Can't walk this earth alone. I recognize I am not my own, so before I fall. I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone. Glory was solely meant for you. Doing what no one else could do. With all I have to give, (With all I have to give). I'll use my life, I'll use my lips (My Lips, Yaaa). I'll only glory in your Word. What gift to me I don't deserve. I'll live in such a way that it reflects to you, my, my Praise. If this life has anything to gain at all. I count it lost if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you. Can't walk this earth alone. I recognize I am not my own, so before I fall. I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone"

will you take me as i am,"[Talking]. Christ through faith. I talked to a cat the other day. And he was like;. ""Man I really wanna come to Christ. But I gotta clean my life up first, get my sins together"". I told em, I used to think that way too. I thought I had to change myself before I could come to Christ. But Christ changed me. Let me tell you my story, it starts like this. [Verse One]. It's 5:46 in the mornin', tossin' and turnin'. Chest burnin', sermons in my head keep reocurrin'. Havin' visions in my head of a kid. Cryin' at the feet of the Father, for all the wrong things that he did. Now I'm sweatin' in my sheets can't sleep. My mind keeps tellin' me I'm six feet deep. Don't remind me, even though I'm still alive I can't tell. The way I'm living my life I feel I'm going to hell. God they telling me I should accept you. That you had to leave the world, cause the world left you. Reason I can't change, like a mystery to me. So I make believe there really is a heaven for a G. Even though they say you loved the world so much, you shed ya blood. God I feel I'm too messed up for love. They tell me come as I am but I smell like smoke. My whole lifes full of sin cause it's all I know. The bible told me that you died for my sins. If I believe in Christ, it'll save me from the end. But I'm scared to ask you, to save me my heart. So evil, I got thoughts, that's full of hatred hurtin' people. I thought at first I had to clean up my life. Now I'm hearin' I just need to cling to the light. I'm ready to do it, but Lord I pray you understand. My life is a mess, will you take me as I am. [Chorus]. Will you take me as I am. I know the way I'm living is wrong. But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone. I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly. But you came down and died for me. Will you take me as I am. I know the way I'm living is wrong. But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone. I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly. But you came down and died for me. Will you take me as I am. [Verse Two]. I'm sick and tired of trying to me the man, my daddy never taught me to be. I'm grown up now, life ain't what I thought it would be. I made many mistakes in my past I can't fix. Now I'm staring at this crusifix tatted on my wrist. Is it true what they telling me, am I just crazy. Did ya bleed on the cross, for my sins to save me. But why would ya die for me. My whole life I've been working for Satan, while He fed lies to me. And now I'm hearing too much, trying to get a true touch. Of a love that can change me, I'm all screwed up. Figure Hell is what I deserve. But your word says we all fall short so I guess we all outta burn. Teach me I wanna learn. How you could save a wretch like me, before death says it's my turn. I think I finally understand. No matter my past, you'll still take me as I am. [Chorus]. [Verse Three]. My father had a few last words to give. I be telling people the reason to live. The reason to die, united with the King in the sky. This life is passing us by, I got no reason to lie. You'll never give the world enough, they'll hunger for more. They figure there ways are nuthin to the wonderous lord. More security than the man that left you. More love than the moms who kept you. He'll always accept you. Be everything your supposed to. Let Christ rule ya heart, mind, body and soul cause He chose you. And if the world don't know you. It don't matter you're Gods child and he'll never disown you. Ya purpose on earth is far from worthless. That's why ya glorified like ya life's been purchased. And it don't matter if the world don't seen us. We still mean the world to Jesus. [Chorus]. [Talking]. Yeah, we're saved by grace through faith. It's not works. Ain't nuthin you can do, ain't nuthin I can do. That could get us this grace salavation that we got man. It's only Christ. So if you feel like you gotta clean yourself up. Before you can come to Him. Forget it. Just come to Him. He'll take you as you are, and he'll change You. From the inside, out"
broken (feat. kari jobe),"I'm just a broken instrument in the hands of the Greatest. So if the notes are off it's 'cause I ain't nuthin' to play with. And you can fault me, but ain't we all off key?. Majoring in the minors like there ain't no errors behind us. Somehow He still makes these melodies with my felonies. I ain't buyin' nothin' they sellin' me what you tellin' me. Broken pieces actin' like we ain't cracked. Man we all messed up and cain't no one escape that. We some broken people. Came from broken homes. Broken hearts inside of a broken soul. Alcoholics to addicts. English, African, Arabs. Ain't no riches to fix it. You still broke when you have it. If you ain't breakin' bad and you still chasin' the habit. It ain't no wonderland so we still chasing the rabbit. Ain't a soul on the planet. That's better than another. And we all need grace in the face of each other. All the pieces on the ground. I shattered all the dreams I thought I found. Can You put me back together?. I need Your grace for my flaws. God I'm broken in this mess I've made. I need You to restore me. From Heaven we all small. Can't nobody buy tickets. You better have will call. That reaper he will call. They hurt just like me. Work just like me. Lust of the flesh the pride of life they flirt with like me. Regardless of our money we all broke together. And if we don't swallow our pride we gon choke together. Tryna hold onto our lives with these clumsy hands. Fell off the wall of purity. Doing that Humpty dance. Forget the king's horses. Forget the king's men. The King is coming to put us back together again. Been fighting since my daddy left. Fighting for approval. Think I don't know tryna get this world to love me is futile. We Tyler Durden won't be the burden of being less. Than what we were made to be like being what they suggest. We are outsiders, outliers. Out cry is loud, the meek inherit the earth. And God opposes the proud. All the pieces on the ground. I shattered all the dreams I thought I found. Can You put me back together?. I need Your grace for my flaws. God I'm broken in this mess I've made. I need You to restore me. Your presence in me. Is all the strength that I need. Your presence in me. Is all the strength that I need. And I'll always be home. And I'll always be home. All the pieces on the ground. I shattered all the dreams I thought I found. Can You put me back together?. I need Your grace for my flaws. God I'm broken in this mess I've made. I need You to restore me. You never left me. You never ran off. You never gave up"

live free,"I know you hear this beat. it sound like somethin' to step with. But morals and your music, you want them separate. Like garnish on the side, somethin' y'all don't mess with. That Christo-centric rap, eclectic. You might like rap that's wild and reckless. A soap box for lots of young and restless. They got ya head bobbin' till ya lose ya necklace. Or better yet bobbin' till it leaves you neckless. You know where death is, where no more breath is. And 3rd graders learn how to leave you chestless. Where God is dissed, dismissed and distant. And far from their hearts cause they hard and wicked. Sin hates God for real. That's why He's rarely talked about. and He don't get the mass appeal. You might see sin blessin' a meal. That it eats while it cheats on the spouse. out seekin' a thrill. Hook. (Jai). I'm free from sin. I win, I win. I'm free, I'm free. And no more chains are holdin' me. I'm free from death. Got power now, me kill the flesh. I'm free, I'm free. I'm gone, I'm gone. (Lecrae). They walk in the church dressed flyer than sea birds. She came to see him, he hopin' to see her. They motives ain't right and they heart ain't either. Over God they choose to feed they fever. And he don't understand that it's Christ who bled for. Every second glance, every turn of his head yo. And she don't really get that Jesus did that. For everytime she fantasize about his six pack. They sure like Al B, to connect like his brows be. And with they bodies spit in God's face so foully. Sin's so bad, it's a liar. It says we on the throne, tells God to retire. It says He ain't enough, and it says we want more. It says He ain't just, it says He ain't Lord. Sin is the laugh at His power, the rape of His mercy. The mock of His patience, it says He ain't worthy. Hook. (Sho Baraka). I been duped and been schemed. Like the Lord was cool with my sinning. Mockin' the cross living unrepented. My sinful ways kept us so distant. We know He's Lord and been king. Let Him run your life like a Simmons. Then you'll start loving His righteousness. And we start looking just like His kids. Hook. Bridge. (Sho Baraka). Live free by His mercy and grace. Live free by His mercy and grace. and tell the world I'm gone. Live free by His patience and peace. Live free by His patience and peace. and tell the flesh I'm gone. Live free by His joy and love. Live free by His joy and love and tell the lust I'm gone. Live free by His truth and just. Live free by His truth and just and tell the hate I'm gone"

Say I won't bring my own bottle of Pellegrino to the movies with me. Say I won't. Look, I'm from an era of fast living and mass terror. Boys cover them cover girls like mascara. I don't need to keep a gun and a mask ever. I still make 'em put their hands up, ask Derek. My role manager damage all of you amateurs. Sneaking up on a tour bus with a demo to hand to us. When I was younger, I just wanted a chain. Now a chain of events has afforded a change. See, I been a rebel since back in the day, I don't follow the people. I follow the leader through valleys and shadows of death and I fearin' no evil. So say I won't do it, say I won't turn the music up and get to it. Won't come down H-Town all the way to their town. In the old school, drop top Buick. And I'm getting, maybe 8 or 9 miles to the gallon. Still feeling like a stallion. I got Andy ridin' shotgun with 30 gold chains on, talking about he Italian. Say I won't go drop a double album, and rap double time on all dub-step. Got no producers, just me rockin' over beatboxin' by Dougie Fresh. Say I won't"

Man forget the bench press today it is a cardio day for your boy, my goodness she bad!. Holla at yo boy!. Uh, I can't lie, I admire beauty like the next man (it's true). I still remember when I used to get my check cashed. Get my hair cut, I hit the streets with my hair gassed. Lookin' out for little mommas with a fat faass. That's what my auntie used to tell me. Girl in my rear view tryna tell me (uh oh). Cause she knew wasn't nothing you could tell me. Always on a trail of another female. Well, well they say my papa was a player. Somebody's honesty is honest in me baby. Somehow in college greek letters made me cuter. All the time online I still couldn't compute it. Uh, I pledge girls then it's on to the next girl. My next girl eventually be my ex girl. But its' funny how it all unfolds. I done finally found a woman I ain't never letting go whoa. Ooh she looking bad (don't do it). I wonder if she got a man (don't do it). I don't see no wedding band (don't do it). I promise you don't wanna go through it (take it from me). You don't want no problems (you don't want no problems). You don't want no problems (you don't want no problems). You don't want no problems (you don't want no problems). Find yourself in the obituary [?]. It ain't nothing like a good woman. If you got you one of those, be good to 'em. Keep it a honey love, everybody want it. But the lies and the lust keep lying next to us, but. I got past, and I'm known to pass it. Up from my passion and I ain't here blastin'. Born a sinner just like any man standing. Couldn't keep standing so God sent a stand-in. If you creepin' when you feel desire creepin'. I know another way to win that don't involve cheating. Don't involve another heart broken into pieces. When a girl call you tell you she saw you on peach st. Meet pretty underscore nice features. Had a couple drinks and have yourself a little peace and. Now you feel like the man in the streets pull 'em to the crib. I see your pants in the street, man.

freedom,"[Verse 1]. They out here prostitutin' kiddos. Fill they pockets with dinero. Pedophiles, pitiful. Sell a child to centerfold. Take they innocence, put in on the internet. Purities tainted, dignities shaken. Enslavin' the soul of all of these babies. And freedom got a price nobody payin'. Makin' money, American dream ain't it, nah!. It's a nightmare, don't fight fair for white here. Benjamin Franklins, killin' we hate for him. Write a song justifyin' the lies we take for him, hold up. They ain't with me, I'm willin' to wait for 'em. Lil' me sat up on the porch, thinkin' dolla bills. Stomach filled from another meal that my momma killed still. I can't keep still. I'd probably steal to keep a couple of Nike checks on the back of my heels. Grab my back on and pills. I need a stack of them bills. They say we slaves to the money. I guess we back in the field. I'ma go pursue my happiness, they told me it was free. But I'm still payin' for it, I'm indebted to this thing. Heard a prophet say the profit, don't focus on makin' change. Just focus on tryna be it and maybe you'll make a gain. Maybe you'll free the slaves, maybe you'll bring a change. The destinations are different but everyone's on the train. [Hook 1: N'Dambi]. Freedom isn't free. But I still, I still believe in my freedom. So my mind can see. Please let me be free, please let me. Freedom. [Verse 2: Lecrae]. I'm out here chasin' this freedom. They out here choppin' my feet off. And if they catch me I'm Toby, but I ain't 'bout to believe it. King Kunta, king of coonin', or Kenan & Kel. Rather rot in a jail cell than be up in hell, well. Well done, is you cookin' or is you hearin' your Father say, ""Well done""?. Is He lookin' at all your honors?. Modestly I'll be honest, I'm hangin' onto that promise. Cause honestly I ain't really been everything that I oughta. Oughta be on my Harriet, bury me next to Honest Abe. Here's lies another man murdered for tryna free the slaves. I gave Chief Keef my number in New York this summer. I told him, ""I could get you free"", I'm on my Nat Turner. Back burner, cookin' up a fat burger. While we shuck and jive to a song about a crack murder. Know we need a change but we threw it on the stage. Got some money and a soul and neither one of us saved. Slaves, get free. [Hook 2: N'Dambi]. Freedom, it isn't free. But I still believe, I still believe in our freedom. So my mind can see. Please let me be free, please let me be free. Freedom. [Outro: N'Dambi]. Freedom, freedom, freedom"
can't do you,"[Verse 1: Lecrae]. Never been no one to waste time. Keep that beat up like a drummer on a bass line. Lil' momma tryna hit me with the waistline. She don't see I got my lady on Facetime.

I can't do you, cause I'm doin' me. Yeah, I know they feel how I'm doin' me. But they gon' get a thrill how I'm doin' me. [Verse 2: E-40]. They call me E-40 but not the Sigma brush. Got my name from drinkin' 40's, used to rush. Cars cookin', cookin' them jelly jars. Yeah you a Jedi charge it up for a hover ride. Now I'm getting microphone profit. Look like I got sandbags in my pocket. Baby on my boots but it's too late. She hungry to her I look like a plate. Let me be straight up. You need to get your weight up. Stop worryin' about the next put your hate up. When my money was low I stayed high. With my chin in the sky, do or die. [Hook: Drew Allen]. Like I'm in the coupe and I'm too gone. Headed to the sky where I'm gon' go. They throwin' shade but it's cool though. I'ma do me and we on the same team. Yeah, watch how I'm doin' me. I can't do you, cause I'm doin' me. Yeah, I know they feel how I'm doin' me. But they gon' get a thrill how I'm doin' me. [Verse 3: Lecrae]. They hopin' I keep it cookin' and keep it poppin'. The studio, the kitchen. We mixin' up the product. Got a lot of haters, couple critics, never stoppin'. Me and God be talkin', He told me not to bother. I got a master plan from the Master. So let 'em talk about me while I'm lookin' crazy dancin'. My clothes don't match and my holes got a pants. Wait, I think I may have man said it backwards. It's cool though, how you do that there?. Actin' like nobody know what you do back there. I hear that hate a mile away, I know it's you back there. I ain't dwellin' on it, I ain't tryna do that there. [Hook: Drew Allen]. Like I'm in the coupe and I'm too gone. Headed to the sky where I'm gon' go. They throwin' shade but it's cool though. I'ma do me and we on the same team. Yeah, watch how I'm doin' me. I can't do you, cause I'm doin' me. Yeah, I know they feel how I'm doin' me. But they gon' get a thrill how I'm doin' me. [Outro: Drew Allen]. I can't do it like you, no, no.

illuminate,"[Hook: Dria & Lecrae]. Open your eyes. You'll see the light that burns inside. Is bright as the sky. It could light up the night. 'Cuz you were born to illuminate. Light em up (x11).

Who's the riders, the crew behind us. Y'all still on that truth or dare, we on true to die. You can crucify us. We gon' fight until our time is over. We can't stop, can't take no photos. Out here rollin', road to glory, homie. Man, they can't stop us, they can't beat us. We undefeated every time we meet up. Put your lighters high so everyone can see ya. When it's heatin' up you know it's winning season. [Hook]. Open your eyes. You'll see the light that burns inside. Is bright as the sky. It could light up the night. 'Cuz you were born to illuminate. Light em up (x11). [Verse 2: Lecrae]. I used to wonder what I live for. Till I found out what I was here for. I found a reason I'm alive for. I'm only here to help the people turn they lights on. Ain't no sense in lookin' back, ain't no sense in lookin' back. Born an original, can't nobody copy that. Ain't nobody stoppin' that. I see your light, your Edison is evident. And you been shinin' ever since. Don't ever flinch, cuz your element is excellence. And everything else is irrelevant. What's your contribution to the world when you stagnant. You feel that mission in your stomach, you sittin' absent. Why you lookin' in the branches for what's found in roots. If you ain't workin' in them trenches, why you buy them boots?. Spotlight, limelight, it ain't light work, it's hard work. The way the lights work is you grind hard in them dark times and let the Light work. High life ain't the highlight since the hustle that's behind it. Get your mind right when you struggle through the dark you shinin' brightest. [Hook]. Open your eyes. You'll see the light that burns inside. Is bright as the sky. It could light up the night. 'Cuz you were born to illuminate. Light em up (x11)"

We should read it twice. before we think that life is just a battle. see we free in christ!. Look dawg! Life is more than church work and football!. What if you were dead and seen that christians overlooked y'all!. This is why we leave the couch. and leave the comforts of our house. to show a die'n world a god they'll probably never read about..

Couple of em thinking they'll be livin in the sky. While I'm here livin man I gotta ask why,. What am here fo I gotta figure out. Waste my Life no I gotta make it count. If Christ is real then what am I gone do about. Everything in Luke 12:15 down to 21. You really gotta go and check it out. Paul said if Christ ain't resurrect then we wasted our. lives. Well that implies that our life's built around Jesus. being alive. Everyday I'm living tryna show the world why. Christ is more than everything you'll ever cry. Better than pretty women and sinning and living to get a minute of. any women and men that you admire. It ain't to lie. We created for. Outta the dust he made us for him. Elects us and he saves us for him. Jesus comes and he raises for him. Magnify the Father why bother with something lesser. He made us so we could bless him. And to the World we confess him. Ressurects him. So i know i got life. Matter fact better then I know I got Christ. If you don't see his ways in my days and nights. You can hit my brakes you can stop my lights. Man I lost my rights.

wish,"[Verse 1:]. Yeah. I wish I never held back. Wish nobody had to sell crack. Then I may have seen my dad a little more. Maybe I can dream a little more. But I still wishing on stars in the sky. Wish a lot of people (was a lie?). And I probably passed on a whole lot of truth. But I know about a whole lot of lies. Man I wish I had me a time machine. I would tell Martin it was all a dream. And I wish like Ray Jay back in 06. Guess it worked 'cause I got my chick. And I wish like [?] did. If I could change the clock. Man I'd change a lot. And I probably wouldn't be so selfish. I woulda gave a lot. Man I'm ashamed of that. I wish I coulda told [?] thank you. Before it got way too late. I wish I woulda worked on my jump shot. But time just fades away. I probably wish too much. I know I play less than I should. I know I did too much. I take it all back if I could. [Hook:]. Wish I had another chance. Maybe I'll do better [x3]. Every time I think about all of my mistakes. I just wanna turn it around. Be like oh oh oh ooh oh. Oh oh oh ooh oh. If I never went there, I would never know. Oh oh oh ooh oh. Oh oh oh ooh oh. Maybe I can turn it around. [Verse 2:]. I wish I didn't do it but I did it. Man it happened last night. Man I wish I would try to act like you ain't never lost your sight. And I don't even do it for the money. Except when I do it for the money. Trying to find yourself and you find yourself doing things in the dark kinda funny. I wish I had ten more wishes. I swear I got ten more visions. And life is a game that I can't stop playing. Baby gimme like ten more minutes. I'm almost finished. I wish I had a little more time. I gotta whole lot of goals I wish I could achieve, I believe Imma lose my mind. Before I get to those. Yeah I miss the goals. But my shot was off. Can't tell what I lost until I count the cost. But I probably missed my calling. Wish I was a little bit taller. Wish I was a baller. Then again every time I get a little money. I be looking at the next man like he smaller. I can't call it. And I wish I didn't go and get high on the one first date. I was all zoned out, paranoid like ""did you hear that noise"". And I know she probably thinking I'm cray (crae). No pun intended. I wish I repented. A little bit quicker. Then again I didn't pull the trigger. I know I said I have no regrets but I sure do wish every chance I get go figure. [Hook]"
anger management,"(hook). I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say. I'm angry, nobody better get in my way. I'm angry, I'm fighting, I'm busting, I'm poppin'. I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me. I'm angry, I'm hating, I'm pushing, I'm shoving. Somebody better get me cos I'm 'bout to do something. I'm angry. (verse 1). Been up all night. Got me feeling weak. No sleep on the first day of a long week. I guess I'm still in school. These people testing me. For disrespecting me I will respond aggressively. A long day short fuse in the worst mood. My temper red hot. I will get these boys blues. Hard livin got me feelin very selfish. Crab in a bucket tryin' crush these other shellfish. Forget the chip upon my shoulder man I carry boulders. I don't know how to control them when they get to rollin'. When people pop off at the mouth I try to keep the cool. But all I wanna do is fix 'em, troubleshoot. Yeah they say I'm wrong. If this carries on. The faith I claim to have. I'll probably never own. Empty waiting pool. Running out of patience. This is anger management get me another agent. (hook). I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say. I'm angry, nobody better get in my way. I'm angry, I'm fighting, I'm bustin, I'm poppin'.

I'm angry every morning before I get up off the bed. This dog keep on barkin I'ma bust em in the head. Uncle keep on trippin if he want to he can get it too. Anybody say another word I'ma act the fool. I hit the dough, push my fitted to the side. Heart full of pride. Anger in my eyes. Been this way since the day I seen my homie die. Now I'm mad at the world and I hate that I'm alive. Really hate to say it cos it's killing me inside. All I wanna be is loved and it's eating me alive. Don't nobody love me man my momma and my daddy don't. My uncle ain't my uncle cos I'm living in a foster home. I say I'm saved but I'm scared of the truth. Cos I read galatians 5 and I didn't see the fruit. I don't know what else to do, I don't know what else to say. So I hit my knees and pray, god take this thing away. (hook). I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say. I'm angry, nobody better get in my way. I'm angry, I'm fighting, I'm bustin, I'm poppin. I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me. I'm angry, I'm hating, I'm pushing, I'm shoving. Somebody better get me cos I'm 'bout to do something. I'm angry. (verse 3). I would die for my respect. But I got no humility. And jesus paid my debt while. I reject him willingly. Man I got some nerve. Holding anger in my heart. The father could have come serve me that beef up a la carte. Not to mention torture, jesus took all my misfortune. I’ve been freed from the law, but I'm serving these court orders. Unforgiveness is my pedigree, you say you’re sorry better be. Better bein' mad at you, than try'na be a better me. Ain't nothin' in my workin' tryna demonstrate his worth. And though he show me plenty grace, I don't extend to other persons. And that anger led to murder, when you pull up on that murder scene. It's jesus nailed upon that cross, yeah the murderer was me"

And baby I'm sorry for all the days I let you down. But I got? something to say, I love you girl"
beautiful feet,"Carlos was born in killa cali. Was walking down an alley and caught a bullet in his head that left him bleeding badly. He lost everything at that moment except his life. He lost his hearing lost his movement and he lost his sight. He laid there in a coma. But man nobody cared. The Gospel preached in his neighborhood? Nobody dared. But los got up out the coma got and was able to hear. A missionary shared the gospel to his open ears. He got saved got trained got discipled. Back to hood. You could find em preaching the bible. He led a homie to Christ from his same hood. Part of Church plant. Come on now ain't his name good. This is blessing but I'm stressing that this is not the norm. We need leaders and belivers to help carry it on. But who would minister in a sinister part of town. I pray if Jesus is calling you that you would be found. Eric used to go to bible study as a kid. He got older and started doing what the hood did. A rival gang caught him slippin tried to take his life. But the jammed up so them beat him nice. He woke up in the hospital singing bible songs. Praise God he had a place to learn the bible from. But then he gets saved and wanna preach Christ they make him change his whole culture and way of life. He gotta get him a bachelors wear a suit and tie. Go to seminary. By then all of his boys will die. Jesus came to invade culture outta nazereth and used a couple fisherman who people saw as hazardous. The feet are beautiful if only they'd go. If ain't nobody in hood preaching how will they know?. Eric is better used taught trues in his context. Somebody please plant a church in his projects.. In Luke 4 16 on down to 21 jesus says he's messiah says hes the chosen one. But more than that he quotes Isaiah. That shows our savior targets oppressed captive blind and the broke I'm saying. Had a heart for the poor had a heart for the low. And 1st John 2:6 is way we should go. In Dueteronomy even tho they under the law. The tithes every third year the poor got em all. I ain't sayin you wrong if you live in burbs. I'm sayin turn your attention to the hood cause we hurting. Man if you ain't burdened please pick up your word an. Tho this world is going down while we here we can serve him. We bring this to the streets because we knew the streets. I pray that more would be burdend to have beautiful feet. You never knew the streets but truth is what you preach. I pray to God you'd be burdened for beautiful feet.. Go, go, go (run with those beautiful feet). Go, go, go. You hold the truth that saves so run and shout it to the world. They can't believe in something they ain't never heard. Go, go, go and run with those beautiful feet"

aliens,"[Chorus]. Aliens! Strangers in Places, foreign in lands that we are in. Call us peculiar, but know that we are. Aliens! Strangers in Places, foreign in lands that we are in. Call us peculiar, but know that we are. Aliens! Aliens! Strangers in Places, foreign in lands that we are in. Call us peculiar, but know that we are Aliens!. [Verse One]. A - A whole notha kind of folks, kinda slow. But we gotta go cause the world's so Ill. L - Livin' the life and livin' it right. And livin' for Christ and that's real in the field. I- Intelligent but irrelavent without Christ. It's nothing but another sin element. E- Eternal Purpose, without it this earth is dead and worthless. N- Never stop giving Him Props. Giving Him praise now until the end of our days. S- Seek Him and please Him and let the people know that they need Him. Aliens! New Creations, new free agents, ain't signed to sin. What the world do, we don't do. Cause we wanna do what the Lord does; Christ within our system. Listen our mission's the Great Commisssion, we come here to represent Him. That's why we call ourself Christianans, Ha, Let me spit another line. For the Plumbline and the Frontline one time on the front lines. keep holdin' it down for all the pilgrims. All over the world representing for the bloodline. [Chorus]. [Tedashii]. I feel like running through the middle of the campus. With the Gammas dropping hammers, waving banners, saying ""JESUS SAVES!"". Bringing together the bretheren in a circle in a cipher. On the corner yellin' ""Pass the Phrase!"". Taking heirs of the Kingdom to the field of mission. So they can spill vision to the children missin'. Telling the men in prison. About the ""Peace be stiller"" ""Mr. Rise & Walk"" and ""Mr. Heal your vision"". Mr. Jesus of Nazareth. Bloodied and beaten and we were the reason for the massacare. For the sin I commit and even when I slip His love is there to grab us up. So as for us, We Hit hoods just like caddilacs. And like James in the Kackalacki. Do things that will make Him Happy. He asks and we do them gladly. We came here as satan's lacky's. Now through Christ I call Him Daddy. He changed us from actin' crappy. Now I'm just a pilgrim passing. I learned that I don't belong. Got new game, new life, new song. Don't fit in? theres nothing wrong, Anti-culture's what I'm on. Royal Priesthood, a chosen one, Rep Him well until He comes. Proposing to people about the propitiation. Pre-paid when Christ died and decided it was done. Preaching to the pushed aside prostitute. Destitute working the block just to feed her son. So if you see us lookin' different dog don't be trippin' just. know that we are ALIENS!. [Chorus]. [Verse Three]. I wish I had a dollar every time I heard em. Holla that I look like seem like talk like them. I blend in til I stand out and shout ""Jesus!"". Man I really wanna be like Him. And it's funny, they love me until I speak the truth. And then they say I'm trying salt they game. I gotta do it, I'm the salt of the earth. I eat, breathe, sleep, think, walk, and talk that man. We are not from this planet, we are not from this earth. C.O.G.'s something distinctive bout the way that we work. I never wanna be discredited for editing the elements. Evident of a heaven sent resident. I just wanna represent. Jesus He the way, the holy King, the priest, and the President. I'mma put it in motion, the world loves sin they boastin'. They put it on like some lotion. If you focused you fall for the hocus pocus. And fall tryna gain ya focus, and I ain't Jokin'. We ain't here to play no games we foreigners in new terrain. Here on mission to represent Him and full of biblical amnuition. We aliens!. [Chorus]"
all i need is you,"(All I need is you). By my side, thick and thin. Highs and lows, don't let go. We gone ride, we gone win. Don't know how, all I know. (All I need is you).

And you know that ain't gone solve nothin'. I mean lord forbid I might fall or somethin'. And I'm all or nothin' cause (all I need is you). To hold me down like bed straps to the psych ward.

How did I fall in this?. No condition that get a mention but you offered this. Unconditional love, I swear I sell it all for this. I'm tryna keep it together, forgive my awkwardness. But umm, often this issue in me often is. Valley of shadows and I know they trying to pick me off in this. But all I need is you. It's funny just how off I get when I ain't ridin' with you.

You slow me down cause. You know me now with my phony smile. And I'm acting like it's all copacetic. It's so pathetic, so juvenile. Know what you do. You keep me cool in the summer. When they be dressin' less. And I be wantin' to show off and stunt. There ain't nothin' to want, you give me all that I need. All I need is you to keep that fire burnin' for me. All I need is you.

anger management,"(hook). I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say. I'm angry, nobody better get in my way. I'm angry, I'm fighting, I'm busting, I'm poppin'. I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me. I'm angry, I'm hating, I'm pushing, I'm shoving. Somebody better get me cos I'm 'bout to do something. I'm angry. (verse 1). Been up all night. Got me feeling weak. No sleep on the first day of a long week. I guess I'm still in school. These people testing me. For disrespecting me I will respond aggressively. A long day short fuse in the worst mood. My temper red hot. I will get these boys blues. Hard livin got me feelin very selfish. Crab in a bucket tryin' crush these other shellfish. Forget the chip upon my shoulder man I carry boulders. I don't know how to control them when they get to rollin'. When people pop off at the mouth I try to keep the cool. But all I wanna do is fix 'em, troubleshoot. Yeah they say I'm wrong. If this carries on. The faith I claim to have. I'll probably never own. Empty waiting pool. Running out of patience. This is anger management get me another agent. (hook). I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say. I'm angry, nobody better get in my way. I'm angry, I'm fighting, I'm bustin, I'm poppin'. I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me. I'm angry, I'm hating, I'm pushing, I'm shoving. Somebody better get me cos I'm 'bout to do something. I'm angry. (verse 2). I'm angry every morning before I get up off the bed. This dog keep on barkin I'ma bust em in the head. Uncle keep on trippin if he want to he can get it too. Anybody say another word I'ma act the fool. I hit the dough, push my fitted to the side. Heart full of pride. Anger in my eyes. Been this way since the day I seen my homie die. Now I'm mad at the world and I hate that I'm alive. Really hate to say it cos it's killing me inside. All I wanna be is loved and it's eating me alive. Don't nobody love me man my momma and my daddy don't. My uncle ain't my uncle cos I'm living in a foster home. I say I'm saved but I'm scared of the truth. Cos I read galatians 5 and I didn't see the fruit. I don't know what else to do, I don't know what else to say. So I hit my knees and pray, god take this thing away. (hook). I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say. I'm angry, nobody better get in my way. I'm angry, I'm fighting, I'm bustin, I'm poppin. I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me. I'm angry, I'm hating, I'm pushing, I'm shoving. Somebody better get me cos I'm 'bout to do something. I'm angry. (verse 3). I would die for my respect. But I got no humility. And jesus paid my debt while. I reject him willingly. Man I got some nerve. Holding anger in my heart. The father could have come serve me that beef up a la carte. Not to mention torture, jesus took all my misfortune. I’ve been freed from the law, but I'm serving these court orders. Unforgiveness is my pedigree, you say you’re sorry better be. Better bein' mad at you, than try'na be a better me. Ain't nothin' in my workin' tryna demonstrate his worth. And though he show me plenty grace, I don't extend to other persons. And that anger led to murder, when you pull up on that murder scene. It's jesus nailed upon that cross, yeah the murderer was me"
anomaly,"I never said he was an outcast. In grade school, I was blastin' my outkast. And now pass on running' to catch a route pass. Give me a pen and a pad I'll try to outlast. All of my idols, america into foreign arts. Before I heard all of these boring bars. Money, money, money, sex, drugs, and some 4nrs. All this killin' but where the bodies at?. All this money but where the bugattis at?. But dig a little deeper and you'll find. Another insecure man sittin' in a two seater. The same little boy that got beat up. With plenty pains in his past you can bring up. Nobody ever told him he could be more. Than he is, but inside he's a leader. I didn't know who was inside me either. Striving to be a captain, hoping I can date a cheerleader. Trying to get a throne on my own so I can put my feet up. Thank God my kingdom was overthrown by the redeemer. Yeah, anomaly. Deviation from the common rule. Somethin' or somebody that's abnormal. And doesn't fit in. I say that's exactly what we are. We are the odd. The outcast. The peculiar. The strangers. And they say you don't fit in. But I say, God exactly God created us to be anomalies. The system didn't plan for this"
background,"Chorus. [C-Lite]. I can play the background.. I can play the background.. Cuz I know sometimes I get in the way.. So won't you take the lead, lead, lead.. So won't you take the lead, lead, lead.. And I can play the background, background.. And you can take the lead.. Verse 1 [Lecrae]. It's evident you run the show so let me back down.. You take the leading role, and I'll play the background.. I know I miss my cues, know I forget my lines. I'm sticking to your script, and I'm reading all your signs.. I don't need my name in lights.. I don't need a starring role.. And why gain the whole wide world, if I'm just gon' loose my soul.. And my ways ain't purified, I'll live according to your Word.. I can't endure this life without your wisdom being heard.. So word to every dancer for a pop star. Cuz we all play the background, but mine's a rock star.. Yeah. So if you need me I'll be stage right.. Prayin' the whole world will start embracing stage fright.. So let me fall back and stop giving my suggestions. Cuz when I follow my obsessions I end up confessing.. That I'm not that impressive, matter fact I'm............. A trail of star dust leading to the superstar.. Chorus.. Verse 2 [Lecrae]. I had a dream that I was captain of my soul.. I was master of my fate, lost control, and then I sank.. So I don't want to take the lead. Cuz I'm prone to make mistakes.. All these folks that follow me gon' end up in the wrong place.. So, just let me shadow you. And just let me trace your lines.. Matter fact just take my pen.. Here, you create my rhymes.. Cuz if I do this by myself I'm scared that I'll succeed.. And no longer trust in You, cuz I only trust in me.. And see, that's how you end up headed to destruction.. Paving a road to nowhere. Pour your life out for nothing.. You pulled my card, I'm bluffing. You know what's in my hand.. Me I just roll to trust you to cause the dice to land.. I'm in control of nothing. Follow you at any cost.. Some call it sovereign will, all I know is you the boss.. And man I'm so at ease. I'm so content.. I play the background like it's an instrument.. Chorus.. Bridge. [Lecrae]. I know I'm safest when I'm in your will and trust your word.. And I know I'm dangerous when I trust myself; my vision blurred.. And I ain't got no time to play life's foolish games.. Got plenty aims but do they really glorify your name.. And its a shame the way I want to do these things for you, yeah.. Don't even cling to you. Take time to sit and glean from you.. And its seems that you are patient in my ignorance.. If ignorance is bliss, its cuz she never heard of this.. Chorus. 2x"

He got older and started doing what the hood did. A rival gang caught him slippin tried to take his life. But the jammed up so them beat him nice. He woke up in the hospital singing bible songs. Praise God he had a place to learn the bible from. But then he gets saved and wanna preach Christ they make him change his whole culture and way of life. He gotta get him a bachelors wear a suit and tie. Go to seminary. By then all of his boys will die. Jesus came to invade culture outta nazereth and used a couple fisherman who people saw as hazardous. The feet are beautiful if only they'd go. If ain't nobody in hood preaching how will they know?. Eric is better used taught trues in his context. Somebody please plant a church in his projects.. In Luke 4 16 on down to 21 jesus says he's messiah says hes the chosen one. But more than that he quotes Isaiah. That shows our savior targets oppressed captive blind and the broke I'm saying. Had a heart for the poor had a heart for the low. And 1st John 2:6 is way we should go. In Dueteronomy even tho they under the law. The tithes every third year the poor got em all. I ain't sayin you wrong if you live in burbs. I'm sayin turn your attention to the hood cause we hurting. Man if you ain't burdened please pick up your word an. Tho this world is going down while we here we can serve him. We bring this to the streets because we knew the streets. I pray that more would be burdend to have beautiful feet. You never knew the streets but truth is what you preach. I pray to God you'd be burdened for beautiful feet.. Go, go, go (run with those beautiful feet). Go, go, go. You hold the truth that saves so run and shout it to the world. They can't believe in something they ain't never heard. Go, go, go and run with those beautiful feet"
blow your high,"Here we go again. Why you blowing them stems I'm bout' to flow again. I know the smoke ain't the only thing going in. I gotta whole lotta truth you can roll'em with. Feel it in your chest, yes, breath. It's what you breathe in never thinkin' that you blessed. You hear it in the back, right, left. Your body feeling right but your soul getting left. You think you gettin' high but you really getting low. The devil got you blind from the weed that you blow. You worshippin' a tree instead of worshippin' the king. When he made everything Romans 1: 23. Chase that high all the way to into the grave. You lost in your low so you're high everyday. And everything you crave only makes you a slave. And Christ is the only way you ever gonna 'scape. If it's one hitta, quitta, get it. In your mind that your time's gon' pass. And if you gon' get it, spit it, lick it. You got one life and it ain't gon' last. You ain't stimulated, you manipulated by a hater. And he hate it when you rehabilitated. If smoke is the evidence, you takin' His benevolent gift. And telling him split while you're in hell in yo hit, so get up. Ohh, you think you high but you really getting low. Yeah, you gon' hate it but I had to let you know. That in the end we all gon' die, can't escape it if you try. I know your lighters up but I'm a blow your high (Eyyy!). I'm a blow your high (Eyyy!) I'm a blow your high. I know you're trying to free your mind. But you just wasting time. And Jesus is alive. [Canon:]. Wait a minute ya'll. Let me take it down a river while they rolling down the hedonism boulevard. Anything that got em' feeling, maybe money or the Lamborghini in the magazine about the sports car. Everybody wanting satisfaction. But there's no regard for The One who has it. And everybody wantin' grabbin'. But you gotta get it from above where they stash it. You can try to get high. You can feel alive. But the reality, your soul dry. You gotta find anybody with a better high. You ain't fillin' half of the $20 bag full of weed that provides it. Gotta make a U-turn cause if you turn. You can see The One who turns. But if we never make that turn. You will never be content with the high you've earned. You will never be happy. Running with the love of kush. For the love of kush, I promise. You can either be a slave to an object. Or rather be a slave to the God who's honest. They ain't never seen a high like I got. But they fallin' in the puddle like a raindrop. Steady running from the top of the balcony. Looking over the Hollywood valleys falling from the rooftop. Ohh, you think you high but you really getting low. Yeah, you gon' hate it but I had to let you know. That in the end we all gon' die, can't escape it if you try. I know your lighters up but I'm a blow your high (Eyyy!). I'm a blow your high (Eyyy!) I'm a blow your high. I know you're trying to free your mind. But you just wasting time. And Jesus is alive. The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. Who by the unrighteousness they suppress the truth. For although they knew God, they did not honor Him or give thanks to Him. They became futal in their thinking. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie. And worshipped and served the creature instead of the creator who is Blessed Forever. Amen"
boasting,"If this life has anything to gain at all. I count it lost if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you. Can't walk this earth alone. I recognize I am not my own, so before I fall. I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone. With every breath I take, with every heart beat,. Sunrise and the moon lights in the dark street. Every glance, every dance, every note of a song. It's all a gift undeserved that I shouldn't have known. Every day that I lie, every moment I covet. I'm deserving to die, I'm just earning your judgment. Ah, without the cross there's only condemnation. If Jesus wasn't executed there's no celebration. So in times that are good, in times that are bad. For any times that I've had at all I will be glad. And I will boast in the cross, I boast in my pains. I will boast in the sunshine, boast in his reign. What's my life if it's not praising you. Another dollar in my bank account of vain pursuit, I do. not count my life as any value or precious at all. Let me finish my race, let me answer my call. If this life has anything to gain at all. I count it lost if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you. Can't walk this earth alone. I recognize I am not my own, so before I fall. I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone. Tomorrow's never promised, but it is we swear. Think we holding our own, just a fist full of air. God has never been obligated to give us life. If we fought for our rights, we'd be in hell tonight. Mere sinners own nothing but a fierce hand. We never loved Him, we pushed away His pierced hands. I rejected His love, grace, kindness, and mercy. Dying of thirst, yet willing to die thirsty. Eternally worthy, how could I live for less?. Patiently you turn my heart away from selfishness. I volunteer for your sanctifying surgery. I know the spirits purging me of everything that's hurting me. Removed the veil from my darkened eyes. So now every morning I open Your Word and see the sunrise. I hope in nothing, boast in nothing, only in your suffering. I live to show Your glory, dying to tell Your story. If this life has anything to gain at all. I count it lost if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you. Can't walk this earth alone. I recognize I am not my own, so before I fall. I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone. Glory was solely meant for you. Doing what no one else could do. With all I have to give, (With all I have to give). I'll use my life, I'll use my lips (My Lips, Yaaa). I'll only glory in your Word. What gift to me I don't deserve. I'll live in such a way that it reflects to you, my, my Praise. If this life has anything to gain at all. I count it lost if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you. Can't walk this earth alone. I recognize I am not my own, so before I fall. I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone"
broken (feat. kari jobe),"I'm just a broken instrument in the hands of the Greatest. So if the notes are off it's 'cause I ain't nuthin' to play with. And you can fault me, but ain't we all off key?. Majoring in the minors like there ain't no errors behind us. Somehow He still makes these melodies with my felonies. I ain't buyin' nothin' they sellin' me what you tellin' me. Broken pieces actin' like we ain't cracked. Man we all messed up and cain't no one escape that. We some broken people. Came from broken homes. Broken hearts inside of a broken soul. Alcoholics to addicts. English, African, Arabs. Ain't no riches to fix it. You still broke when you have it. If you ain't breakin' bad and you still chasin' the habit. It ain't no wonderland so we still chasing the rabbit. Ain't a soul on the planet. That's better than another. And we all need grace in the face of each other. All the pieces on the ground. I shattered all the dreams I thought I found. Can You put me back together?. I need Your grace for my flaws. God I'm broken in this mess I've made. I need You to restore me. From Heaven we all small. Can't nobody buy tickets. You better have will call. That reaper he will call. They hurt just like me. Work just like me. Lust of the flesh the pride of life they flirt with like me. Regardless of our money we all broke together. And if we don't swallow our pride we gon choke together. Tryna hold onto our lives with these clumsy hands. Fell off the wall of purity. Doing that Humpty dance. Forget the king's horses. Forget the king's men. The King is coming to put us back together again. Been fighting since my daddy left. Fighting for approval. Think I don't know tryna get this world to love me is futile. We Tyler Durden won't be the burden of being less. Than what we were made to be like being what they suggest. We are outsiders, outliers. Out cry is loud, the meek inherit the earth. And God opposes the proud. All the pieces on the ground. I shattered all the dreams I thought I found. Can You put me back together?. I need Your grace for my flaws. God I'm broken in this mess I've made. I need You to restore me. Your presence in me. Is all the strength that I need. Your presence in me. Is all the strength that I need. And I'll always be home. And I'll always be home. All the pieces on the ground. I shattered all the dreams I thought I found. Can You put me back together?. I need Your grace for my flaws. God I'm broken in this mess I've made. I need You to restore me. You never left me. You never ran off. You never gave up"

Got my name from drinkin' 40's, used to rush. Cars cookin', cookin' them jelly jars. Yeah you a Jedi charge it up for a hover ride. Now I'm getting microphone profit. Look like I got sandbags in my pocket. Baby on my boots but it's too late. She hungry to her I look like a plate. Let me be straight up. You need to get your weight up. Stop worryin' about the next put your hate up. When my money was low I stayed high. With my chin in the sky, do or die. [Hook: Drew Allen]. Like I'm in the coupe and I'm too gone.

We mixin' up the product. Got a lot of haters, couple critics, never stoppin'. Me and God be talkin', He told me not to bother. I got a master plan from the Master. So let 'em talk about me while I'm lookin' crazy dancin'. My clothes don't match and my holes got a pants. Wait, I think I may have man said it backwards. It's cool though, how you do that there?. Actin' like nobody know what you do back there. I hear that hate a mile away, I know it's you back there. I ain't dwellin' on it, I ain't tryna do that there. [Hook: Drew Allen]. Like I'm in the coupe and I'm too gone. Headed to the sky where I'm gon' go. They throwin' shade but it's cool though. I'ma do me and we on the same team. Yeah, watch how I'm doin' me.

chase that (ambition),"Started with hangin' posters on my bedroom walls.. To battle rappin' for status up in the school halls.. Just call me double sushi, thought I was too raw.. And hip-hop was my home, I had my shoes off.. 6'3 in high school, well skip a hoop dream.. If I don't blow up then maybe I'll try this school thing.. I went to college to do my family a favor,. But I couldn't pick a major cuz I wanted to be Major.. I tried sellin' work, but it didn't work.. So I worked, shopping center clerk, finna go berserk.. Lunch break, see me writin' 16's over Mickey D's,. Skippin' class, makin' beats, over 60 keys.. And I love that even though I'm just chasin',. Selfish ambition couldn't tell your boy nathan.. Watch out all you rappers cuz they finna let 'Crae in,. But I was sleepin' on the Son, like a Days Inn.. And you can have the money, and you can have the fame.. For me I want the glory, I'm livin' for the Name.. See life is just a picture, I see outside the frame.. I'm livin' for a Kingdom that I ain't never seen.. And Imma chase that, Imma Imma chase that.. Found the key to life and best believe that Imma play that.. (Glory) Imma chase that, Imma Imma chase that,. (Glory) Imma chase that, Imma Imma chase that.. I remember chasin' the green, feelin' blue.. Only check I'm countin' is the mic check, 1-2.. All I wanted was the money and the fame and the new,. Somebody on my arm when I walk inside the room.. All I wanted was doom.. The same kind Alexander the Great felt when the earth ran out of room.. He conquered all he could, but yet he's feelin' consumed.. By this neverending quest for glory he couldn't fuel.. Like a typical fool,. (I would go hard) shootin' for the moon,. But there's only one sun (Son), no co-star.. Chasin' glory I shouldn't own,. Instead of living to make His name known,. I'm runnin' after His throne.. I thought bein' on Tv where everybody could see me. Was nothing short of the easiest way I could see to please me.. I'll never be who I used to desperately wanted to be,. I'm too worried 'bout the Lord gettin' credit instead of me.. And you can have the money, and you can have the fame.. For me I want the glory, I'm livin' for the Name.. See life is just a picture, I see outside the frame.. I'm livin' for a Kingdom that I ain't never seen.. And Imma chase that, (Glory) Imma chase that.. Found the key to life and best believe that Imma play that.. (Glory) Imma chase that, Imma Imma chase that,. (Glory) Imma chase that, Imma Imma chase that.. I used to wanna do it big.. When you're only focused on yourself that's small.. And they, they used to tell me as a kid,. That I could do anything that I want, except fall.. And now that I recall, I was chasin' my goals.. And everytime I caught'em they multipled into mo'.. I never even thought about whether the Lord approved,. Call it selfish ambition, I call it, ""I'm makin' moves."". But history repeats itself, evil's what it is.. Cuz Lucifer was cast away for doing what I did.. Created by the God who spoke the earth into existence,. Instead of chasing the Father's glory, he was chasin' his.. He lies to us all, told Adam he could ball.. ""Why you followin' God when you could go get it all?"". I'll tell you what's better, or better yet worse.. Chasin' your own glory by doin' the Lord's work.. So holla if it hurts, but we were made for greater.. Our greatest satisfaction is making His name famous.. So if we're never named among the greatest,. They don't critically acclaim us,. Ain't nothin' to be ashamed of, we gave it up for the Savior.. Imma chase that, Imma Imma chase that.. And the Lord's goodness, you should - you should taste that.. And you ain't livin' 'til you livin' for His name, yeah.. (Glory) Imma chase that, Imma Imma chase that."
church clothes,"R.I.P. to Medgar Evers, R.I.P. to Dr. King. I ain't tryna hate on my own kind. But Al and Jesse don't speak for me. I'm probably gon catch some flack mayne. But I'ma swallow this pill like Pacman. Some of these folks won't tell the truth. Too busy tryna get them racks mayne. Church tryna rob my paychecks. Choir members probably havin gay sex. Pastor manipulatin hurtin women. I wonder which he's gon slay next. Bookstore pimpin them hope books. Like God don't know how broke looks. And tellin me that I'm gon reap a mill. If I sow into these low crooks. Plus I know ol' girl a freak. Now how she singin a solo. I walked in the church wit a snapback. And they tellin me that that's a ""nono""?. That's backwords, and I lack words. For these actors called pastors. All these folks is hypocrites. And that's why I ain't at church. Truthfully I'm just doin me. And I don't wanna face no scrutiny. As long as the church keep wildin' out. I can justify all my foolish deeds. Smokin weed, pourin up. Keep that 'lade up in my cup. Maybe I could change the world. But this porn on my laptop got me stuck. Yeah I know whats right from wrong. But that there ain't gon sell a song. I rather sell my soul than save it. If that's what make my money long. It better not be no real God. With real hope, that heals hearts. That shows me that I ain't livin up. To all the things that He put me here for. It better not be no real church. Real saints, who pray hard. And let me rock my snapback. With the 501s and the J's on. It better not be no real folk. Who don't think that they better than you. Straight or gay, drunk or high. They walk through the cold weather wit chu. Nah we don't wanna see that. Cause that might mean ""life change"". That might mean I'm worth more. Than money, cars, sex, and pipe dreams. Better not be no real Jesus. Real forgiveness, for hurt folks. If God gon take me as I am. I guesss I already got on my Church Clothes"
crossover,"Talking: Yeah, they gon' hate this one. They gon' hate us cause we love Him so much. But it's finna go down dawg. Yeah we gon' represent Him tonight. [Verse One]. You can find me in a church. Focused and alert. No suit and tie, jeans and a t-shirt. I'm into praising God because He made us out of dirt. And plus He gave His life for this world's evil works. So flirt with that. Most of y'all can't jerk with that. Cause it ain't no benefits and no purse with that. Still gotta' live your life on this earth with that. But we live eternally and I can work with that. Holla, yeah I cheated, yeah I lust within. But guess what that's why I trust in Him. See you thinkin' that you ain't that bad. You just lying to yourself playboy you better check your health. While you're all about the cash and ice. Hope you ready for change you just broke the first commandment twice. And I know that you done stole before. If it wasn't a gun it was some gum from the grocery store. It's all sin to God. Man look into God. You guilty, you ain't even a friend to God. Sin gotta' high price it'll cost your life. But God fit that bill on the cross with Christ. [Chorus]. The crossover from death to life. What's the hold up accept the Christ. We flex the Mic to rep for Christ. So we can put your soul at rest tonight. [Verse Two]. Yo. I don't catch the Spirit I'm all filled up. I can't lose it either I'm all sealed up. And you can bet yo life. I'm a rep for Christ. One taste He'll get you right. Folks is thinking they Christian. But when they sinnin'. They don't feel the conviction that the Spirit is givin'. And they keep living life like, ""that's cool with me."". Y'all people ain't fooling me. Try to play me to the left like I'm trying to get deep on them. This is real talk dawg, you better peep somethin'. This ain't that philosophic rap like ‘Harmoynm'. And I ain't talking about the God you heard about from mom and them. Put that blunt out dawg, put down the Heineken. ""man God understands"" What? Come again. I guess you think that God is kinda' like yo momma huh?. Like He ain't even trippin' on your sinnin and your drama. [Chorus]. [Verse Three]. Yo, life's way more then ice and rims. And you don't make enough to pay the price of sin. And God's gon' judge you dawg that's reality. Saying you don't believe is like saying there ain't no gravity. Then running off to go jump a cliff. And when you hit the ground tell me what you get. Hey, why you running from the freedom of the gospel?. You hostile. You're looking like your lucifer's apostle. But God got you. And though we all deserve death He still keep putting breath in your nostrils. But you treat Him like an obstacle. See Him come at your convenience like a stop and go. Waiting for a sweeter deal or a sign or something. Like God ain't come down and die or something. Trust me dawg God wants the best for you. That's why the gospel of Christ is addressed to you. [Chorus]"
cruising,"[Hook 1]. But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', cruisin'. But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', cruisin'. But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', cruisin'. But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', cruisin'. [Verse 1: Lecrae]. I woke up, kinda late. All good, thank God. Hit the shower, hit the closet, hit the mirror, stay fly. Really I'm rockin' some sweats. Oh well, I'm still feelin' blessed. Get fully dressed, walk in the kitchen. She already made me a plate, kinda impressed. And that sun shinin', it's good weather I'm feelin' good. Got the good book, I'ma read up. Put my feet up and then hit the hood. Gotta go cause the jeep got the top off. Throw my real shades on, not my knock-offs. On the street like fifteen minutes and the lights stay green. Boy, the team might win it. Slow down, speed got limits. But I'm cruisin', knee-deep in it. At the car wash, cleaned the Jeep and found a ten dollar bill in between the seats. I gave it to the man on the corner. Had a sign up sayin' he was hungry. Yeah, the world kinda crazy and the folks kinda foolish. But I keep cruisin'. [Hook 2]. But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', cruisin'. But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', 'sin. [Verse 2: Lecrae]. Cruisin', feelin' good, yo. I remember livin' in the hood bro. Death rate high and the funds low. When I used to get by on crumbs bro. Went to the park to get the scoop. Saw the home boys out there shootin' hoop. And my shot kinda rusty but the fade clean. And me and Steph Curry on the same team. Win it like back to back. Nobody really want it after that. Feelin' like a young Doctor J. They can't stop the J, they can't block my pace. It's true that they can't stop the rain of my shot today. And my girl still fine as ever. So when she hit my phone I had to stop the game. Later on, time to eat. Favorite restaurant, open seat. Sunset, the scenery. Told my lady, ""Lean on me"". After that jump in the whip and we in a wind. Tomorrow may not be another win. But until then I'ma keep on moving. Cool it, I'ma keep cruising. [Hook 2]. But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', cruisin'. But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', 'sin. [Bridge] (x2). Windows rolled down but the night's goin' up. If you got the fire you can ride with us. Feelin' real good, I can't get enough. You know how we do it. Yeah, baby we cruisin'. [Hook 1]. But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', cruisin'. But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', 'sin. But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', cruisin'. But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', cruisin'"
deja vu,"[Intro]. Yeah, the whole world's gone crazy. People riot in the streets. Killin' unborn babies. Catchin' shots from police. [Verse 1]. Never thought that I would see the day. When I would have to pray for God to hold me down. Cause Lord, I feel like giving up today. I feel like giving up the faith. I swear these people fake, I swear they full of hate. I swear to tell the truth 'til I'm in the grave. Shots-shots fired, everybody quiet. Tryna hear the preacher, he ain't preachin' to the choir. Preachin' to the riots that he got fired. He ain't got no medicare, sippin' liquor in his chair. Blank stare, need a blank check, where your bank at?. Babies had a birthday, they gon' need a rain check. Rich man need a vacation, hop a plane. Broke man need a vacation, Mary Jane. Walk outside and everything is lovely. Butterflies in my stomach from this girl I wanna see. Party in the neighborhood and everybody on the street. They was on that Stevie Wonder now it's Frankie Beverly. I done seen days go crazy, time fly by. Maybe it was yesterday or maybe 65. Peace then war, sworn in, die. All too familiar, more lifetimes. [Hook 1]. One time for the memories, two times for the crew. Three times for the love, y'all. And Four times for the truth. And some days are a nightmare. And some dreams come true. But the Lord's still right there. It's just déjà vu. It's just déjà vu, déjà vu. It's just déjà vu, y'all. It's just déjà vu. It feel like Tribe Called Quest, it feel like De La Soul. It feel all too familiar, it feel like déjà vu. [Verse 2]. I said I love you, hit the door. Got a mission, gotta go. Yeah, it's cold, but I'm gon' pursue that. She said she love me but she know. I'm too old to be waiting for handout, boy you knew that. And if they try to keep me down. Hold my ground 'til they all look around. And they wonder, ""Who that? "". They don't respect my mind, they'll respect my grind. So I told her, ""I got to do that"". Now maybe I was talkin' to my lady. But I think I told my mama same thing. I told her I was all about the action. And then I got Ghostface in my dream. Déjà vu, parlez-vous français? Quoi de neuf?. Everything the same under the sun. that's why we burnin' up. Don't believe astrology, but man, I hated cancer. Breast, lung, throat, blood, prayin' for an answer. Seem like it was yesterday. they came and took your breath away. And I ain't get a chance to tell you. everything I want to say. Now they say your sister got it too. Yeah, they say it's true. Guess it's never finished til it's you. Déjà vu. [Hook 2]. One time for the memories, two times for the crew. Three times for the love, y'all. Four times for the truth. Some days are a nightmare. And some dreams come true. But the Lord's still right there. It's just déjà vu, it's just déjà vu. Déjà vu. It's just déjà vu, y'all. It's just déjà vu. [Outro]. It's just déjà vu, déjà vu. It's just déjà vu, y'all. It's just déjà vu. And some days are a nightmare. And some dreams come true. But the Lord's still right there. It's just déjà vu"
desperate,"Desperate. [Verse 1: Lecrae]. Woke up this morning too depressed and shamed to leave my bed. Cant stand to see my own reflection so I hang my head. Feel like a disappointment like scum of the earth. I'm so hurt I know you see I cant cover my dirt. My soul's dying hearts weak and I cant even cry. I'm sposed to run to you but WHY I'm such an evil guy. The sun's shining but for me it's the darkest of days. Try to pretend it never happened but the guilt remains. I leave the house it feels like everybody knows I did it. Feel like they reading my mind and know the sin I committed. Through your blood I'm aquitted but my heart doesnt get it. Oh God I'm desperate for help cause I'm grieving your spirit. I couldnt sing in the sunday service, Lord I felt fake. and when they started communion I just made an escape. I'm in need of your grace feels like you hid your face. Lord lead me back to cross and show me my sins erased. [2x Chorus: Cam]. I'm so desperate,. I can't believe I've sinned against you. Create in me a clean heart (I'm so sorry). Your mercy is what I need. [Verse 2: Lecrae]. I'm waste deep in my pity is Satan tryna trick me. And tell me you wont forgive me cause it's startin to get me. Jesus help me quickly I hate the wrong I've done. I know we all fall but I feel like the only one. Feels like I should be shunned I punish myself. I know it's dumb cause by your death all my sin has been dealt. But my sin is been felt I didn't want to it. But what I want to do I don't I swear I'n goin through it. I'm tryne open up my bible need to read your pages. Need you Lord but my guilt has got me feeling so faithless. Help me see where grace is take me back to the basics. Help me find my joy in you and not people and places. My sin is ever before me I turned my back on you. Oh father break and restore me to bring me back to you. My sin is ever before me I turned my back on you. God break and restore me to bring me back to you. . [2x Chorus: Cam]. I'm so desperate,. I can't believe I've sinned against you. Create in me a clean heart (I'm so sorry). Your mercy is what I need. [Verse 3: Lecrae]. Have mercy on me God according to your steady love. Wipe away my transgressions and wash me in your blood. Create in me clean heart renew a right spirit. Don't hide your face from me God your Presence keep me near it. I'm waiting patience on you Lord I know you hear my cry. Restore your Joy in me for you alone I live and die. It's you I glorify cause you don't want my sacrifice. You want me broken and contrite trusting in the Christ. I confess to you my sin and you show me mercy. I turn away from it demonstrating that you are worthy. Over lust, over pride, over all sin. Is my affection for Jesus who died for all them. I was lost now i'm found i was toss to the ground. My sin weighed on me heavy but I am no longer bound. As sure as Christ wear the crown I know that grace will abound. And even when I feel lost I know in you I am found. . [2x Chorus: Cam]. I'm so desperate,. I can't believe I've sinned against you. Create in me a clean heart (I'm so sorry). Your mercy is what I need. Por: Jeferson Munhos"

First of all, I know it ain't a song that's gon change the world. There's no way. It's not a guilt trip, it's a field trip that's gon last more than one day. What you thought, huh?. Faith ain't bout no soft stuff. I heard you just went overseas, now come back home and boss up. Buy a bottle for a fee, dirty water. Bodies floatin' in the sea, dirty water. Blood flowin' from the ground, dirty water, dirty water. Buy a bottle for a fee, dirty water. Bodies floatin' in the sea, dirty water. Blood flowin' from the ground, dirty water. Ain't no filters in this town, dirty water. Worthless, worthless, 400 years we done heard that. My family came here on slave ships. Some herd cattle, some herd blacks. Know some of ya'll done heard that. My kin was treated less than men. That's why we raised to hate each other, cause we hate our skin. Lies you told about yourself that you don't realize. I must be a thief, she locked the doors when I was walking by. They must be whores cuz the master rapes them and leaves. The child. So dead beat daddy was taught to me way before my time. Now we extreme, buying fancy things like gold chains. Just pretty shackles, we still enslaved. Put 'em round your neck, cuz we still hangin'. Hood preacher told 'em they should live as kings. You call him devil, he fightin for self esteem. It's hard to dream when your water ain't clean. Now look at Lucifer's scheme as how to be in a team. Blood in the ocean to these African streams.

don't waste your life,"Don't Waste Your Life. [Intro]. Let's go. Don't waste your life, man. [Verse 1: Lecrae]. I know a lot of people that scared they gone die. Couple of em thinking they'll be livin in the sky. While I'm here livin man I gotta ask why,. What am here fo I gotta figure out. Waste my Life no I gotta make it count. If Christ is real then what am I gone do about. Everything in Luke 12:15 down to 21. You really gotta go and check it out. Paul said if Christ ain't resurrect then we wasted our. lives. Well that implies that our life's built around Jesus. being alive. Everyday I'm living tryna show the world why. Christ is more than everything you'll ever cry. Better than pretty women and sinning and living to get a minute of. any women and men that you admire. It ain't to lie. We created for. Outta the dust he made us for him. Elects us and he saves us for him. Jesus comes and he raises for him. Magnify the Father why bother with something lesser. He made us so we could bless him. And to the World we confess him. Ressurects him. So i know i got life. Matter fact better then I know I got Christ. If you don't see his ways in my days and nights. You can hit my brakes you can stop my lights. Man I lost my rights. Lost my life. Forget the money cars and toss that ice. The cost is Christ. And they could never offer me anything on the planet. That'll cost that price (yeah!). [2x Chorus: Cam].

fall back,"Lies in them songs, lies on the television. No tellin' what lies on the television. Learned sarcasm, sexism, racism. Learned to worship money, cars, learned to hate Christians. All the Christians in the movies so typical. Alcoholic, child molesting, hypocritic, mystical. They say since everybody's doing it, it's normal. But Jesus says be transformed and don't let them conform you. You ain't thin enough, you need a new diet. You need a psychic, everybody does it, you should try it. Spring break, hit the beach, what you supposed to do. Be careful what the media impose on you. You learned how to find peace a TV show. You learned how to ride clean from a video. In 30 seconds a commercial have you mixed up. Call now and we can have your whole life fixed up. Hook:. I know you might've seen it on the TV. You hear on the radio and CD. But you can be deceived pretty easy. Believe me, you might wanna fall back. The enemy is crafty and misleading. That's why I use the Word of God to lead me. And I ain't eatin' everything they feed me. Tryna deceive me, so I gotta fall back. These days if you watch the box you should block your. Mind in these times and them lies that could lock you. They tellin' girls in our world to be hot stuff. And tellin' dudes link with crews on the block tough. Plus I'm feeling like they mock us. They think that God is old school like a box cut. But I'm sure that His flock's tough. And we can judge what is bug. And live pleasing in His sight when the clock's up. I hope we gazing through His lens with eyes. So we can defend what it is when we get they lies. Its on that cash that they fix they mind. Man they always sayin' cheese like its picture time. Tell 'em cool it with the mind games. I'm chasing Christ, I'm renewed in my mind frame. And removed from them tired games. Then say my life it ain't mine man. We must remove the damaged parts like a tire change. Hook. Be a rebel let the Word of God lead you. Satan uses media to tempt you and deceive you. He will lead ya, leach ya, leave ya. So be careful as you navigate through media. Take heed before gravity get the best of you. And you find the concrete bench pressin' you. Use the Word of God to help you filter all that. Before you fall into the trap, you better fall back. (Trip Lee). You know what I call that? I call that maturity. Learnin' how to fall back so you can live in purity. Learnin' how to walk that and sayin' 'You ain't lurin' me. The media is meetin' us with lies but He's curin' me'. I know them guys tryin' to hype you. But cling to the Lord's Word and flee from them vipers. We spittin' aimin' at your heart like snipers. We'd like for you to desire God like Piper"
fanatic,"I'm a F-A-N-A-T-I-C,. Fanatic. I rep Christ till I D-I-E,. Fanatic. I'm not extreme, I'm redeemed with faith. To serve a God whose extremely great. I'm a Fanatic. x2. The world's trying to tidy up, exfoliate they skin. but only Christ can come and exfoliate they sin. And they fate look grim, If they don't take him. As the high priest he is to mediate they sin. The world's got to many Gods, man we choose the one. From hebrews, he rules, he bruised his son. He moves the sun. So if we prayin and our schools call us fools. Cuz our God's too true to shun. Channels two in one. Man it looks insane. Tv make a lot Christians seem dramatically strange. Though we may be looked upon as one and same. We will not turn in shame, we proclaim the name. Christ Jesus, believe us, you ain't gotta recieve us. but we gon' follow our God wherever the bible lead us. And you can call us dramatic, fanatic, emphatic. But hate while you at it, take a look at our mathematics. I'm a F-A-N-A-T-I-C, Fanatic. I rep Christ till I D-I-E, Fanatic. I'm not extreme, I'm redeemed with faith. To serve a God whose extremely great. I'm a Fanatic. x2. What can I do to make it simple, make it plain. Christ came, emptied himself and let out sin hang him. You couldn't blame him for any sin. While they singing many men. The crucifixion was pretty grim. But when we state the fact that God resurrects. We get funny looks from a world that doesn't get. We are not David Koresh or Krishna. Or the people on Tv who glorifying their bishop. From Edwards to Piper, Macaurther to Spurgeon. From Dallas to France, From Cali to Berlin. As Christians all over who getting the word in. We ain't crazy we just understand the truth and we burdened. The world sees us as evangelical Christians. As narrow-minded fanatics with a mythical mission. Labeled extremists for sharing out faith. But thats cool, we can carry the weight of persecution. Cuz earth is losing. And if we yelling the truth. We honored to be the people that our God is using. So keep it moving. Cuz if we yelling the truth. We honored to be the people that our God is using. I'm a F-A-N-A-T-I-C, Fanatic. I rep Christ till I D-I-E, Fanatic. I'm not extreme, I'm redeemed with faith. To serve a God whose extremely great. I'm a Fanatic. x2. They thought Jesus was out of his mind. they laughed and mocked him. Called him a cult leader and they tried to stop him. Pharisees said Christ got his power from Satan. Hatin', on the very one that came to save 'em. Even after he rose, man the world ain't changed. They still rejecting the name, still look at us strange. Still tell us without shame that our faith's insane. and, ""it don't take all that to be a Christian man"". And its hard when you tryin to reach your family and stuff. They say man, ""you too spiritual, you doing to much"". So we show them the love of Christ and live in the light. So they can glorify our God when they look at our life. And we win for sharing the truth and hearts get changed. We win if we're rejected because of his name. We win if seeds get planted and watered and grow. But even if we lost, we still be Fanatical though. I'm a F-A-N-A-T-I-C, Fanatic. I rep Christ till I D-I-E, Fanatic. I'm not extreme, I'm redeemed with faith. To serve a God whose extremely great. I'm a Fanatic. x2. por Mr. Z3r0"
far away,"Far far away far away far away (You feel so). Far far away far away far away. Hopeless!. I can spell it. I can smell it in the air. Lotta people wonder if you still care. And are you still there. Cause I lost it all. I keep calling your name. But do you hear my call. And are you still involved. Or am I left alone. I wander the streets. Cause I no longer have a home. My brothers all gone. My sisters all gone. My family and my friends. Ain't gonna be here in the morning. You see me here mourning. They say you feel my pain. They say you went through it. Say to die is to gain. But I ain't gain nothing. I lost everybody. Now I'm losing my mind. And my faith is all got in. I'm still holding on. That's why I still pray. Feeling empty inside. I can't make it through the day. I don't know what else to do. I don't know what else to say. I'm talking to you now. But I promise that you feel so far. [Chorus] (x4). Far far away (You feel). Far away (You seem). Far away...so so. Dear hope, been waiting on ya for a while now. Been cut so deep that I ain't sure if I can smile now. Look at this devastation. Look at the pain and sorrow. Somebody fed me lies and promised me a bright tomorrow. I know the God I follow. Is bigger than disaster. Big enough to handle. Any evil that harasses us. But I feel like he passed us. Pain overtook us. Buildings tumbled over head. As the ground shook us. God have you forsook us. Lord you still with me. I know you save souls. I trust you to forgive me. Relief can you hear me. Hey Rest can you get me. Hey Peace can you see me. Hey Love can you heal me. I don't know what to do. I ain't looking for answers. I just need you to hold my hand. Through this cancer. Tell me you never left. Even in the midst of death. Breathe on me I'll do anything to feel your breath. [Chorus] (x4). Far far away (You feel). Far away (You seem). Far away...so so. For God alone, O my soul,. Wait in silence, for my hope is from Him.. He is my only rock and my salvation, my fortress. I shall not be shaken.. On God rests my salvation and my glory.

fear,"Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. I will fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. I honestly grow insecure as I get older. Cuz' even when you hot there comes a day when you get colder. Comes a day when you slower, time is taking its toll. 45 on the back of the jersey upon your soul. I'm scared of letting go, I don't know what the future holds. My nightmares are having nightmares. I'm quite scared of what's right and fair. How I fear an eternity. Will I hear well done when he turn to me?. Will I hear you care too much about. All this stuff that really don't matter?. You chase the wind and you don't want it. Got to the top of a 2 foot ladder. What's after I can capture all this mess my heart was after?. Will I end up empty-handed when I stand before my master?. Did I master the mathematics of a passive disaster?. Add in my selfish ambition. All the while, subtracting what matters. I don't know. At late nights, I can't sleep. Will I fall? Will I peep?. Through the curtains, all I see, fingers pointed at me. And they watching, and they watching. And I'm wondering what they thinking? thinking bout'. At late nights, I can't sleep. Counting cash, counting sheep. Through the curtains, all I see fingers pointed right at me. And I'm watching, and I'm watching. And I'm wondering what they thinking? thinking bout'it all. In high school, we tried to act all tough. I remember a couple times, I couldn't back that up. Like when I ran from them vatos, scuffing up my sapatos. Scared of losing my high, I was so embarrased inside. If I could go back in time. I would stand and say something like. I ain't never scared, never scared, never scared. I'm lying, I'm scared of these thoughts in my head. I'm scared of possibly pushing people right over the ledge. When I say I pledge allegiance to the struggle. Then, I turn around and buckle. Under stress and under pressure. Bible on my dresser that can teach my pain a lesson. But I rather not address it. Address that's in depression. I'm scared if I confess it. That you gon' look at me like I'm something less. And I'm such a mess. C'est lui qui a peur d'admettre ses craintes. Et c'est lui qui ne pourra pas les surmonter. On trouve la liberté dans la confession. Et la liberté dans la reconnaissance. And it just so happen, I'm wrestling with my status. I'm trying to see me like He do. Not focusing on this madness. They count on me, count me out. On a count of they fear and doubts. Keep account of my wrongs. Trying to keep me inside they house. Some just keep me around, I wonder what that's about. Yeah! They wanna be politically correct, I suppose. But? I'm comfortable in my skin. While they just pretending they clothes. I'm scared of falling and failing. In front of all of my foes. And I feel some friends are unfaithful. So, I keep my small circle closed. I don't want no handouts or favors, no functional saviors. I'ma tell that truth till it kill me. I'm chilling with my Creator. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus to all of my haters. For the ones that think I forgot him. And the ones who won't let me say. I ain't scared no mo'. Everybody always. They gon have something to say rather you like it or not. Everybody always. They gon' have something to say. Baby, don't take it to heart"

Shinin' armor, don't harm her, arm her with all your honor. And don't mind me that's just wordplay. I ain't playin' with it, that's heresy. That's hairspray, that's shop talk. You stayin' with me?.

freedom,"[Verse 1]. They out here prostitutin' kiddos. Fill they pockets with dinero. Pedophiles, pitiful. Sell a child to centerfold. Take they innocence, put in on the internet. Purities tainted, dignities shaken. Enslavin' the soul of all of these babies. And freedom got a price nobody payin'. Makin' money, American dream ain't it, nah!. It's a nightmare, don't fight fair for white here. Benjamin Franklins, killin' we hate for him. Write a song justifyin' the lies we take for him, hold up. They ain't with me, I'm willin' to wait for 'em. Lil' me sat up on the porch, thinkin' dolla bills. Stomach filled from another meal that my momma killed still. I can't keep still. I'd probably steal to keep a couple of Nike checks on the back of my heels. Grab my back on and pills. I need a stack of them bills. They say we slaves to the money. I guess we back in the field. I'ma go pursue my happiness, they told me it was free. But I'm still payin' for it, I'm indebted to this thing. Heard a prophet say the profit, don't focus on makin' change. Just focus on tryna be it and maybe you'll make a gain. Maybe you'll free the slaves, maybe you'll bring a change. The destinations are different but everyone's on the train. [Hook 1: N'Dambi]. Freedom isn't free. But I still, I still believe in my freedom. So my mind can see. Please let me be free, please let me. Freedom. [Verse 2: Lecrae]. I'm out here chasin' this freedom. They out here choppin' my feet off. And if they catch me I'm Toby, but I ain't 'bout to believe it. King Kunta, king of coonin', or Kenan & Kel. Rather rot in a jail cell than be up in hell, well. Well done, is you cookin' or is you hearin' your Father say, ""Well done""?. Is He lookin' at all your honors?. Modestly I'll be honest, I'm hangin' onto that promise. Cause honestly I ain't really been everything that I oughta. Oughta be on my Harriet, bury me next to Honest Abe. Here's lies another man murdered for tryna free the slaves. I gave Chief Keef my number in New York this summer. I told him, ""I could get you free"", I'm on my Nat Turner. Back burner, cookin' up a fat burger. While we shuck and jive to a song about a crack murder. Know we need a change but we threw it on the stage. Got some money and a soul and neither one of us saved. Slaves, get free. [Hook 2: N'Dambi]. Freedom, it isn't free. But I still believe, I still believe in our freedom. So my mind can see. Please let me be free, please let me be free. Freedom. [Outro: N'Dambi]. Freedom, freedom, freedom"
gangland,"[intro]. We not playin' out here, it's for real. We livin' out here for life, we tryna to get it. Ain't nobody finna take our life. I keep my young homies out here with these things. My big homies keep handlin' me. And we keep it crackin'. My other name should've been jesse james. Cause I stay with my cannon. I didn't have no choice. I was raised right around the corner. From where we standin'. hollow points in it. And all of that, I'm ready. we gang bangin'!. [intro: lecrae]. My cousin *beep* was a killer. He done pulled a lot of triggers. He done made a lot of mamas cry. And if you ask him why he do it he'd just say. ""I'm young and foolish"". Bang on you right before he made them bullets fly. [verse 1: lecrae]. He ain't have no sense of dignity. His daddy was a mystery. He'll probably end up dead or sittin' in a penitentary. And tell the judge he can go to hell for the sentence. And it probably make no sense. If you would listen to the history. The new jim crow or the old one. People out here fightin' for equality and honestly. I think they owe 'em somethin'. Back and forth some. Cleaver got a message for the people. Bunchy with 'em and they tryna stop the evil. And they cliqued up with they fist up. The whole neighborhood feelin'. Like they meant somethin'. Then it was a mix-up, fed's got 'em fixed up. End of the movement, back to the bricks, bruh. And raymond washington about to start the crips up. They gettin' bigger every day and tryna fix stuff. They saw geronimo pratt dodgin' bullets from attacks. Guess they figure, ""we don't really want it this much"". [break 1: lecrae]. You know originally, the gangs were created. To protect everybody in the community. There was lynching and bombing going on. And the gangs were there to protect. What people don't understand is that a lot of the leaders. Died. medgar evers (has been shot). Bunchy carter (has been shot). Fred hampton (has been shot). Mlk (has been shot in memphis tennessee). These youngsters didn't have any direction. No leaders to look up to so they went rogue on 'em. [verse 2: lecrae]. They say that crip stands for community. Revolutionary interparty service. Way before the genocide and the murders. A little after integration was the verdict. When bombs might go off at the sunday service (baow!). They protectin' they community. Then it turn into diplomatic immunity. Then a fight against oppression was the pressin'. Now they keep on losin' battles. And they started losin' unity. Now they beat each other blue-black. Force fed self hate 'till the truth crack. Got they own folks hidin' on the rooftops. They ain't finna take no more, they finna shoot back. (baow!). Now they bond like a family they all bloods. From the concrete jungle to the small hoods. Throwin' signs up, now the crime's up. We was meant to kill oppression now we loadin' 9's up. But never mind us, grind us. Factory done closed, now a lot of people jobless. Now they got the drugs comin' in from nicaragua. Government done turned a blind eye, or they liars. [break 2: lecrae]. It was a perfect storm. I mean, we're talkin' post-segregation. And what are you gonna do?. The factories have closed. And no one's hiring anybody from the urban community. Because of what you look like. And now there's a war going on in nicaragua. And drugs are being imported into your community. Are you gonna to sell drugs. Or are you gonna be homeless?. Cause the government's not paying attention. [verse 3: propaganda]. Huh, man you tell me. What's a reasonable man to say?. There's a high school in alabama. Named after robert e. lee and it's 89 black. You don't see the irony?. What it do to a psyche, it's simple, you don't like me. What I'm 'posed to do now?. Delusional calling that system criminal justice. Where the rich and the guilty are safer. Than the poor and the innocent. Why would we listen?. When american churches scuff they toms. On our brother's dead bodies. As they march to stop gay marriage. We had issues with planned parenthood too. We just cared about black lives outside the womb. Just as much as in. Young man gon' find purpose somehow. And a nation was at least around. And when them vice lords told him. He was of royal decent. And that war on drugs felt much more. Like war on the poor. He figured forget it. So why don't you come stay a while?. Tell us that the son of man walked on egyptian. And eastern soil and wasn't just a western construct. Or master used to control us. But what the master used to free us. And it was a crooked system just like this. That left the king of kings bloodless. Yeah, we are truly a descendant of a king. Only his reign is infinite. And being right is a distant second. To the joy of compassion. Why don't you come stay a while?. Alert312-116 8, 512. 3 Days ago. Ladies & gentleman, classic propaganda. Alert312-116 8, 512. 3 Days ago. So much truth in that first verse. Ww. 16 Hours ago. I think that second verse is being misinterpreted. He's talking about how the violence. That the crips used in their neighborhood. Scared people and spawned the bloods. Someone tell me if I'm hearing reading into that wrong?"

going in,"Yeah, from tryin' to get over to flyin' overseas. I don't understand it all, but I know who oversees. I'm in the sky lookin' down at the Pacific Ocean. Hopin' the Father's arms are open for the broke and hopeless. Touch down, all around is the evidence. His power takes precedence over all of these elements. Blue seas, cool breeze under palm trees. Spirit calms me as I'm readin' through Psalm 3. We don't know much 'bout the place we hope we'll all be. All we, heard about heaven is it's beyond dreams. Set your heart on things above, that's what the Word say. But we don't know a thing about it except for hearsay. Hear-say, clear lay, I play with word for 'em. But with the Word I ain't playin' like a benchwarmer. Revelation 21 and Psalm 11:4. Aye Luke 20:36, gon' get it for 'em. I ain't gotta get myself together 'cause He already fixed me up. And I'm going in, I'm going in. No I don't have to pack no bags, fill up on gas. He's already got my bags, yeah, yeah. And I'm going in. Yeah, I'm going in, I promise ain't nothin' stoppin' me. Biblical prophecy shaping up my theology. And I don't live for the money, give it all away. Hey where I'm goin' I know it can't follow anyway. I'm tryin' to live in the image I was created in. Earth was perfect, He said it'll be that way again. Then, we'll be really dancing with the stars. I might just hang out on the Moon, take a trip to Mars. Ours, will be a new Heaven, new Earth. A new life inherited through a new birth. It's new mountains, new sky, and some new seas. A new body where I can do plenty new things. The deaf hear, and the blind see a new scene. And everyone is in the presence of the true King. No fears, no tears, just cheers. For the Father, Son, and Spirit, you can hear us getting near. I ain't gotta get myself together 'cause He already fixed me up. And I'm going in, I'm going in. No I don't have to pack no bags, fill up on gas. He's already got my bags, yeah, yeah.

As soon as I get home my faith is evans. I know it was Your plan to carry me. Through this World it's cold man, you garried me. I'm dead to the old man, I buried me. The bridegroom now holds hands and marries me. I'm sick of this single life. The weight weighs, over time. I'm sick of regina knights. Sick of just walking blind. Sick of the shingles life. Livin' in the shades when the burden I need is light. The burden you give is light. Ready to move on up, lookin' for Weezy's life. Where I'm livin' is prison, I'm sick of the wheezy life.

"good, bad, ugly","Come on everybody sit down. People wanna act like they are in and out. Well I'm here to wipe off your smile. And tell you what's the word around town. I know you don't wanna hear the truth. I know you hate the fact that I actually have the proof. But I just need you to believe. I'm talking the good, the bad, the ugly. Remember back in '02. When I was in school and actin' a fool. My soul got saved, my debt had been paid. But still I kept running off on my crew. Sex on my brain, and death in my veins. Had a main thing, we stayed up 'til 2 (Smoke!). Waking and thinking we naked, my body was loving it. Soul was hating it, man. Time and time after time, our bodies were close. The girl was so fine. Heard a heart beat that wasn't hers or mine. The miracle of life had started inside. Ignored the warning signs. Supressed that truth I felt inside. I was just having fun with this, I'm too young for this. I'm thinking me, myself, and I. Should I sacrifice this life to keep my vanity and live nice?. And she love and trust me so much that whatever I say, she'd probably oblige. But I was too selfish with my time. Scared my dreams were not gonna serve. So I dropped her off at that clinic. That day, a part of us died. I remember back in the day. I was barely in the first grade. Got teeth missing, watching Tom & Jerry. Tryna go outside so I could play. I was told to watch out for strangers. Keep my eyes out for danger. Folks workin' late, I had a babysitter. I ain't 'bout to sit here and name her. I was almost 8, when she came in late. Woke me up with a game to play. Did a few things that's hard to say. Told me to keep that secret safe. How a young boy supposed to deal. I'm tryna act like it ain't real. Had my innocence just stripped from me. I still don't know how to feel. And I'm wondering how to address it. Can't tell my family, too messy. So I just embrace it, it's hard to face it. I'm too ashamed to confess it. So I kept it in and ain't speak. Can't think, it hit me so deep. So into it, I got promiscuous. And only God can help me get free. But I've been forgiven, my Savior risen. I'm out the prison, I know that. I got the power to say to no to all of my struggles. God will control that. Every time we slip and we fall. Gotta get back up and fight on. We are not defined by our past. The future look bright, I see the light on"
hallelujah,"Gone in the club on the vod-ka-ka. Trying to get lil' momma in the car-ar-ar. I heard a gun pop like ""pa-pa-pa"". Someone hit us with a choppa like ""ra-ta-ta"". An average night for a couple of no goods, up in college but yet we still act like we're so hood. Never makin' it to Church, man we're drinkin' til it hurts, if we could do it tomorrow yeah we sure would. (Mayne!) When you're sittin' in your room and you're feelin' like a fool 'cause you got a couple Std's. (Dayng!) See you're partner's on the news 'cause he thought that he was cool, now they're 'bout to put him 6 feet deep. (Shame!) When I'm really at my lowest and I'm feelin' kinda hopeless everybody gotta hate on me. Shame on me, 'cause the blame's on me but Hallelujah the Lord showed His grace on me. He saved me! Was on my way to hell with a full tank. I don't care what them boys think, 'cause what I'm on is a sure thang. Stackin' they money up like it's Lego's, Tienes hambre para all of the Peso's. Theý'll never be satisfied, man I tried, it's a lie, the only hope you got is turning to Jesús. I'm not here to impress, I'm here to impact. I won't settle for less, got my cross on my back. I was out my mind, my head was screwed up. But Jesus saved me! Hallelujah!. Turn up my level, still a Rebel, screaming Hallelujah. Me and my partners on your block, we holla Hallelujah. Was out my mind, my head was screwed up. But Jesus saved me! Hallelujah!. Hey what you say? Hallelujah! (4x). My soul was empty, my life was foolish. But Jesus saved me! Hallelujah!. Follow me, follow me, I'm a phenomenon, not because of what I do or the music I'm on. Follow with shooters and gettin' caught up in too much, I found the Lord, was the truest, and now I follow the Son. Enemy of the King like Sauron, He shoulda smashed ya boy, I was a moron. Runnin' from the Truth, fulla 40 proof, half-naked looks that I only wanted more of. Knew in my heart I was opposed to You, knew I wasn't doing what I was supposed to do. Made in Your image, but I was more like a menace, and by Your grace I repented, and now I'm close to You. I tell the world but when I tell 'em they don't listen. ""How you rappin'? but you Christian? "" They don't get it so they dissin'. But they shot Pac and they popped Biggie, I pray my killer gets saved when he done with me. First put me on a plane, headed to the rap game, let me tell the whole world how the Lord did it. Go and put me in line with all the worst sinners, only difference is I'm tall and a lil' thinner. But if you ask who's forgiven, see my hand hit the ceiling, I been changed like weather after a cold winter. They can say what they wanna, I ain't scared of these people. Lord is my shepherd, I fear no evil. My soul was empty, my life was foolish. But Jesus saved me! Hallelujah!. Turn up my level, still a Rebel, screaming Hallelujah!. Me and my partners on your block, we holla Hallelujah!. Was out my mind, my head was screwed up. But Jesus saved me! Hallelujah!. Hey what you say? Hallelujah!. My soul was empty, my life was foolish. But Jesus saved me! Hallelujah!"
heaven or hell,"[Verse 1]. They tell me ""'Crae murk the track"". Hurt the rap. Naw dawg, let me pose a question to you. ""Have you heard of my Dad?"". Purchased us back, put man's curse on his back. I worship for that, it's my whole purpose in fact. Purple and black, is how we looked I'm certain of that. And man I cry when I think of how the Curtain was cracked. But He rose in three days, that's a pertinent fact. And since He created to save me, I serve him for that. I read His Word all the time so He stay on my mind. Flesh rise all the time so I stay on the grind. When it's time to go to Heaven I don't pray I'm in line. I'm a hundred percent positive I'm waiting for mine. Ain't no ifs, ands, or buts, whos or whats. You walking away from Christ, man you losing touch. Take away your ? man you doing too much. The world's feet rush into evil, pursuing they lusts. [Chorus]. I hope that ya'll listening well, there's only two places to dwell. [Heaven and Hell]. And if you representing the first, I pray you're representing well. [Heaven and Hell]. I hope that ya'll listening well, there's only two places to dwell. [Heaven and Hell]. And if you representing the first, I pray you're representing well. [Heaven and Hell]. [Verse 2]. Some of ya'll got it twisted. Hell, why risk it?. Life, can be fixed through Christ, I'm a witness. And I don't care about 5 mics or a hit list. I'm getting kinda used to gettin' dissed as a Christian. Let's get one thing straight,. Out the gate, I'm the type of dude to put a slab of truth on your plate. And I don't care if ya heard it twice. I ain't trippin' if you just left church, ya heard of Christ. Let me tell you what was holdin' me. Six hours on the Cross while His Holy Blood flowed for me. What you know about a sacrifice?. When you step off the throne for the same one that snatched your life. Man, let me tell you dawg Christ is real. Without Him you got nothing,. You're living off of life's appeals. Make Him Lord in your life. Cause ya'll in Death Row talking bout ya kinda like that deal... [Chorus]. I hope that ya'll listening well, there's only two places to dwell. [Heaven and Hell]. And if you representing the first, I pray you're representing well. [Heaven and Hell]. I hope that ya'll listening well, there's only two places to dwell. [Heaven and Hell]. And if you representing the first, I pray you're representing well. [Heaven and Hell]. [Verse 3]. Hey yo, I might have to bleed for this. I'm not ashamed of Christ, there's Romans 1:16 for this. And I don't care if I'm blinded dawg. Everytime I trip and fall, I just be reminded dawg. And you call yourself grinding dawg?. You can served more birds than churches. But you still dying dog. I don't care what city you from. Whether from the suburbs or from the slums but Christ still gon' come. And matter of fact, if He come now. You can be a six-eight, heavyweight, but your knees gon' bow. Ain't no telling Him to ease on down. And when the trumpet sound. And *blat* everybody see that ground. I don't care about fame and wealth. Put my God on a shelf? Naw Dawg I'd rather hang myself!. Forgive me if I can't contain myself!. Cause if YOU DIED, and didn't hear the Gospel, than dog I blame MYSELF!. [Chorus]. I hope that ya'll listening well, there's only two places to dwell. [Heaven and Hell]. And if you representing the first, I pray you're representing well. [Heaven and Hell]. I hope that ya'll listening well, there's only two places to dwell. [Heaven and Hell]. And if you representing the first, I pray you're representing well. [Heaven and Hell]"

i did it for you,"I did it for you. I did it for you. I did it for you. That's why I did it yea'll. For all the listeners. Whoever be hearing this. That's why I do what I do. I did it for you. Single mother low income riding the bus. Big momma making a fuss saying in God she trusts.. My uncles 20, I'm 10 taking gulps of gin.. He don't realize that we all are engulfed in sin.. Gang bangers on the corner got me wanna be down. Take a bullet for some city on government ground. By 25 everybody locked or died. To busy playing around never looking ahead. Every funeral, cats get upset and cry. Turn their heads towards the sky trying to ask God why. But they never looked up till then. Every other day they concerned with the world and consumed in sin. Not Christ just heaven they want. They think clean means not trying to sling things out of their trunk. Nobody ever to them heaven was spotless and we all dirty. That's why we need a Holy God to wash us. [Chorus:]. I did it for you. I opened up my life and shared my life. So that you can see we all need Christ. I did it for you. If you can understand my pain. Maybe you can see we all need change. I did it for you. Can view my life my pain my hurt. Man I hope this work. I did it for you. Sense Christ died for sin. I never be the same again. I did it for you. Young dude, I remember coming home after school. Changing channels from videos back to cartoons. Up late talking on the phone under my bed. So momma couldn't hear some of the things I said. And it wasn't all bad but it wasn't all good. Even though momma was doing the best she could. I was a latchkey home alone for hours. Entertaining my sin And my soul devour. Pick up by the cops at the age of 12. And not because my momma didn't raise me well. I was a drug baby big momma dragged me to church. Hated ever minute of it but she prayed it would work. I an't never met my daddy so I feel all empty. Like why he never call or why don't he come get me. And momma under legalistic teachings and lies. So she beat me and she tell me it was to keep me alive. a typical youth I mean A typical youth 16 agnostic and looking for truth. I lived for myself, No one ever told me the plan. God had to bring redemption to a fallible man. Good news really wasn't good news to me. Cause I never new the condemnation due to me. And I wish somebody would of told me then. What it meant to know Christ and to be born again. [Chorus]. They say Mac got saved and X is a Christian. Well I don't really know them but I pray they both listen. It's hard trying to grow up in a sinful land. And you don't have an example of a Godly man. Well hold on; just keep your eyes on Christ. When we enter in the world, man our lives alright. They say heaven has a ghetto but that an't true. And if God has a standard then that an't you and that an't me. That's what I learned late one night when a man named James White changed my life. He told me that Christ paid the price for sin. Every lie I ever told Christ died for them. See, I never knew I offended God I just knew I really wasn't trying to live for God. And my sins all cost me, Yeah pretty costly. I couldn't blame the hood for the death sin bought me. All that I could do was blame myself and realize there was no way I could change myself. So I trusted Christ with my lustful life. And he saved me that's why I am trying to touch the mic. Yeah so if you ask who I am spitting this to, that's right yea'll I did it for you. And if you ask who I have written this to, that's right I did it for you. [Chorus]. I did it for you, I did it for you. So I could show you that his grace is right here for you. I did it for you, I did it for you. So I could show you that his grace is right here for you. I did it for you"

Breakin' cycles, make disciples that's all that I know. Made it out to make a route. Hate about us makin' clout. Racin' 'bout what faith endowed. See amazin' grace, invading spaces. changin' places now. [Hook: Elhae]. I'm livin' like you should wanna know what I know. (I know nothing y'all). Remember this, you will always reap what you sow. Gotta keep it real, hold it down on the low. Never been fearin', nah, nah, nah, nah. So I wouldn't know, I wouldn't know. I wouldn't know, I wouldn't know"
i'll find you ft. tori kelly,"Just fight a little longer my friend. It's all worth it in the end. But when you got nobody to turn to. Just hold on and I'll find you. I'll find you. I'll find you. Just hold on and I'll find you. I'm hanging on by a thread. And all I'm clinging to is prayers. And every breath is like a battle. I feel like I ain't come prepared. And death's knocking on the front door. Pain is creeping through the back. Fear is crawling through the windows. Waiting for 'em to attack. They say don't get bitter, get better. I'm working on switching them letters. But tell God. I'mma need a whole lot of hope. keeping it together. I'm smilin' in everyone's face. I'm cryin' whenever they leave the room. They don't know the battle I face. They don't understand what I'm going through. The world tryna play with my soul. I'm just tryna find where to go. I'm tryna remember the way. I'm tryna get back to my home. But I can't do this on my own. That's why I'm just trusting in you. Cuz' I don't know where else to go. And I don't know what else to do. Just fight a little longer my friend. It's all worth it in the end. But when you've got nobody to turn to. Just hold on and I'll find you. Just fight a little longer my friend. It's all worth it in the end. But when you've got nobody to turn to. Just hold on and I'll find you. I'll find you. I'll find you. Just hold on and I'll find you. I'll find you. I'll find you. Just hold on and I'll find you. They say fear haunts. And pain hates. I say pain strengthens. And fear drives faith. And I don't know all of the outcomes. Don't know what happens tomorrow. But when that ocean of doubt comes. Don't let me drown in my sorrow. And don't let me stay at the bottom. I feel like this hole is too deep to climb. I've been looking for a way out. But I'll settle for a peace of mind. Picking up the pieces of my life. and hoping that I put together something right. Tell me all I got is all I need. Tell me you gon' help me stand and fight. The world tryna play with my soul. I'm just tryna find where to go. I'm tryna remember the way. I'm tryna get back to my home. But I can't do this on my own. That's why I'm just trusting in you. Cuz' I don't know where else to go. And I don't know what else to do. No don't let the fear. Make you feel like you can't fight this on your own. You know I, I'll be there for you. no matter where you go. You'll never be alone, noo. Just fight a little longer my friend. It's all worth it in the end. But when you've got nobody to turn to. Just hold on and I'll find you. Just fight a little longer my friend. It's all worth it in the end. But when you've got nobody to turn to. Just hold on and I'll find you. I'll find you. I'll find you. Just hold on and I'll find you. I'll find you. I'll find you. Just hold on and I'll find you"

And you been shinin' ever since. Don't ever flinch, cuz your element is excellence. And everything else is irrelevant. What's your contribution to the world when you stagnant. You feel that mission in your stomach, you sittin' absent. Why you lookin' in the branches for what's found in roots. If you ain't workin' in them trenches, why you buy them boots?. Spotlight, limelight, it ain't light work, it's hard work. The way the lights work is you grind hard in them dark times and let the Light work. High life ain't the highlight since the hustle that's behind it. Get your mind right when you struggle through the dark you shinin' brightest. [Hook]. Open your eyes. You'll see the light that burns inside. Is bright as the sky. It could light up the night. 'Cuz you were born to illuminate. Light em up (x11)"
indwelling sin,"[Sin:] Aye look what's good fam it's me again. The one you used to call your friend. I know you ain't forgot me?. [Crae:] Oh yeah you always get me caught in sin. [Sin:] Here you go with that again. You act like we ain't cool or sumthin. Let's go smoke a Kool or sumthin. Talk and sip a brew or sumthin. [Crae:]. Naw man I ain't trusting you. Ain't nothing but lust in you. Thanks be to God I obeyed the teaching. I was entrusted to. Cause when you pass by you. just want ya boy to backslide. Have me feeling sick. like I'm coming down off a crack high. [Sin:]. Man that's a flat lie. You act like I'm the bad guy. You know when me. and you get together we have a grand time. Let's take it back. All the way to like the 6th grade. Last thing on your mind back in the day. was trying to live saved. Remember house parties, kissing in the dark?. Man that was innocent fun come on. [Crae:]. Now don't start. See dawg I live by the Spirit so I don't gratify. All them old sinful desires that never satsify. [Sin:]. Aye come on Kill That!. Look me in my face and tell me I'm a lie. You ain't feeling chasing women, getting drunk. and getting high, stacking money. staying fly, living up the playas life. we was having fun now gone try to be religious guy. [Crae:]. Aye Yo man first of all Lower Your Voice!. Who you talkin' to?. Handcuffed in August '02 I got caught with you. Truck flipped over on 35 that was all from you. I'll mess around and lose my life man tryna walk in you. I'm standing on these stages. and got these people believing me. What I look like trying ta gratify this disease in me. [Sin:]. So Now I'm a disease? Man please. I got yo back dawg. I ain't saying drop the Jesus and be a rap star. All I'm saying is when it's you and me let's be real folk. We ain't gotta be selling drugs and tryna kill folk. Maybe just a lil. [Crae:]. What? A lil this, a lil that, a lil. Bet late at night, that's like a lil crack. see you ain't gone lie to me. I see how you be tryna be. Bet tonight becomes addiction to pornography. And that's in no way honoring the God. who's ruling sovereignly. [Sin:] Man you know you miss them old days. [Crae:]. Yeah you right possibly. But after that I sober up and think of Jesus holding up. his skin up on the cross for all them drunken nights. I'm throwing up. Every thought of blowin up is captured. in his flowing blood. I start thinking Philippians 4: 8 when you showing up. [Sin:] You know I ain't gone quit right?. [Crae:]. Yeah I know but I'm dead to you. And one day I'll be present with Jesus. who died and bled from you. Colossians 1: 15 that's the God that I trust in. The Father crushed Him. In doing so he has crushed sin"
invisible,"(With Diamone). Lord it's amazin all of the places that you put us, so amazin, the stages u put us on God we don't want any of that glory Father God make us invisible Father we wanna decrease that u might increase John 3:30 ain't that right Diamone? make us invisible it's been hard though Father God through all of it i promise. Verse 1: I wouldn't trade it for nothin the long nights long flights for nothin. I mean I'm sittin in the airport writin cousin. No I never woulda thought in all my wildest dreams. I'da seen all of the things I seen. I mean I seen Katrina she came through hungry. Took anotha city where desire is from ye. Cuz only 2 yrs back we came 2 share that. Glorious gospel seen em holdin they tears back. Now we got new orleans in our backyard God is good. Cuz a few whoadies got saved since dey been in my hood. And we got 2 show em love wit our time & money. But for me, yea it was more time than money. But if time is money then I must be broke. Cuz i love 2 get it in wit people after the show. We talkin this places and covenants why for the love of it. Me me yeah I'm lovin it we should be lovin it. Chorus (Diamone & Lecrae). Feel the power when ya reach the unreachable (the unreachable Lord). But there's more here than just the physical (just the physical God). The best when ya complete with the impossible. Make me invisible, you're visible. Lord erase me if I ever turned and lived for myself. Cuz your glory's infinitely greater than my personal health. And Lord I know I'm not worthless you give me my worth. But I know I'm not perfect to lolly the earth. And can't nobody do it like the way u do. Usin me and my whole crew to reach the world for you. And it's true they watchin everything that we do. Yeah its true that we're an illustration of you. I look at verse 26 in genesis chapter 1. It says I'm lookin like my daddy the more i follow the son. And the more i follow the son all my days look brighter. Cuz he placed a hope within me got me feelin all excited. Got me feelin like a writer like B on the train (whatup BJ). Standin up and tellin everybody Christ is King (Jesus). If ya see me on the TV or the world wide web. Know that I be givin Christ da cred. I know why some people see me but I don't trip. I pray the Lord will keep me focused on a missional tip. And use this music as a tool to get Christ inside of your dome. I can't just say it on the mic I gotta do it at home. Chorus. Your boy ain't a rap star, I'm nothin like Jay-Z or Game. I got a funny soundin name and I don't wanna be famous. I don't make a lotta change, my heart has been changed. I just wanna know Jesus mayn, to make it plain. It's like I got a message penetratin my soul. It's the wisdom the Father gives regeneratin my soul. I'm sold on being soled that the glory is his. I'm trippin that he would even make me 1 of his kids. Get credit for so much but the credit ain't ours. My God how can I tell em this in sixteen bars. Prepare a phrase tear a page share a stage. But no I could never fully communicate your glory alone. And at home i pray we'd all be some regular dudes. Find a ministry we can share in while speakin these truths. I'm greatful that you know me if you send me i'll go. Lord I'm dyin to serve and I'm livin to know you. Chorus. (Lecrae): You're visible..."
it is what it is,"[Hook]. I'm hearin' screams and they sayin' we sold out. But I'm hearin' screams from the stands cause we sold out, it's so loud. I got one life so I spend time tryna live 'til the next one. If you don't like it, cool. It is what it is, it is what it is. It is what it is, it is what it is. My plate too full to sample that dish. It is what it is, it is what it is. I'm handlin' biz, it is what it is. It is what it is, it is what it is. [Verse 1]. Some like, ""I ain't really feelin' that bruh. I ain't with religious rap, bruh"". Some sayin' it is devil rap. Illuminati-on-another-level rap. Fell flat from heaven went to hell and back, huh?. A lot of radio ain't givin' no play, but it's ok. Cause my day one's been A-1. Before the co-signs and the pros came [uh!]. Where you been, been boy, boy?. You ain't been keepin' up. Church Clothes 1 and 2, then Anomaly. You probably need to turn your speakers up. And now I'm on my third tape. And I just might drop it on a Thursday. So tell the industry and my enemy. That your man wouldn't follow in they rules in the first place. Thirty plus in the residential. In the truck feelin' presidential. With my girl lookin' detrimental. Killin' anything tryna to be a side piece out my mental. Outta your mind. You thinkin' I'm leavin' my baby by marchin' for dimes?. You'll get that curve, you way out of line. Gave her that rock, I'm stayin' with mine. I keep the huddle mad tight, too many players I don't trust now. You wasn't with me on the 4th down, huh?. Then you can miss me when I touchdown. And that's no shade, no shade. It's just those games, I don't play. I'm gettin' wiser with more age. And realizin' some gonna hate. And that's ok. [Hook]. I'm hearin' screams and they sayin' we sold out. But I'm hearin' screams from the stands cause we sold out, it's so loud. I got one life so I spend time tryna live 'til the next one. If you don't like it, cool. It is what it is, it is what it is. It is what it is, it is what it is. My plate too full to sample that dish. It is what it is, it is what it is. I'm handlin' biz, it is what it is. It is what it is, it is what it is. [Verse 2]. Hold up. Let me get a minute from the flexin'. Foreign cars and the million dollar jets. And futuristic clothes, feelin' like a Jetson. Cause keep it trill, it ain't really that impressive. Blessed, but I ain't frontin' with the Grammys or the fame. I'm just stuntin' with my family unashamed. And cats say, ""Crae, you done got it all"". In the gym workin' hard, you should show it off! "". Nah, that ain't never been my forte. ""Pride come before the fall"", what the Word say. And I've been eatin' off the wordplay. Working hard on the lyrics that the world play. Remember where I came from in the first place. It's all a gift, every breath is a birthday. So I spend time tryna find all of these souls lost. Cause it's a wasted time if I got it all and they souls lost. I ain't tryna to ball. If that's what you feel then your goals off. It's a different game tryna get this truth. Put you on and then go off. So, yeah, I may swag at award shows. Get some jet lag from a tour show. Keep a couple abs on my torso. But none of that is gon' matter when the horn blow. I ain't tryna front for them flashin' lights. Man they had us, life is a gift. So if last night was my last night, them I'm good. It is what it is. [Hook]. I'm hearin' screams and they sayin' we sold out. But I'm hearin' screams from the stands cause we sold out, it's so loud. I got one life so I spend time tryna live 'til the next one. If you don't like it, cool. It is what it is, it is what it is. It is what it is, it is what it is. My plate too full to sample that dish. It is what it is, it is what it is. I'm handlin' biz, it is what it is. It is what it is, it is what it is"

Well I just gotta be like,. I just gotta be like you. (Verse 1- Lecrae). Yeah, Uncle Chris, Uncle Keith, Uncle Ricky,. Before the Lord get me I gotta say something quickly. I grew up empty since my daddy wasn't with me shoot,. I wasn't picky I'd take any male figure. You. stepped in at the right time,. It's ‘cuz of you that I write rhymes. You probably never knew that. I loved the way you used to come through come through,. Teach me to do the things that men do. True,. You showed me stuff I probably shouldn't have seen,. But you rebelled and made it out your teens,. and took me under your wings. I wanted hats, I wanted clothes just like you,. Lean to the side when I rolled just like you. And care people didn't like you,. You wanna bang, I wanna bang too. Skyline,pyru. You would've died, I would've died too,. You went to prison, got sick, lost your pops,. Yeah,I cried too. You never know who's right behind you,. Gotta a little son now and he do whatever I do. But it's something deep inside you,. That tell it's gotta be more than doing what other guys do,. They had nobody there to guide you. But I followed your footsteps and this shouldn't surprise you,. You realize you, you, you. Yeah,. (Chorus). I just wanna be like you,. Walk like, talk like, even think like you. The only one I could look to,. You're teaching me to be just like you. Well I just gotta be like,. I just gotta be like you. (Verse 2). Now all I see is money, cars, jewels,. Stars. Womanizers, tough guys, guns, knives, and scars,. Drug pushers, thugs, strippers, fast girls, fast life. Everything I wanted and everything I could ask life. If this ain't living and they lied well,. guess I married an old wives' tale. Wow, fail. I don't know another way to go,. This is the only way they ever showed. I got this emptiness inside that got me fighting for approval because. I missed out on my daddy saying, way to go,. And get that verbal affirmation on know how to treat a woman,. Know how to fix an engine, that keep the running. So now I'm looking at the media and following what they. feed me,. Rap stars, trap stars,. Whoever wants to lead me. Even though they lie they still tell me that they love me,. They say I'm good at bad things at least they. proud of me.. (Chorus). I just wanna be like you,. Walk like, talk like, even think like you. The only one I could look to. You're teaching me to be just like you. Well I just gotta be like,. I just gotta be like you. (Like you). (Verse 3). I was created by God but I ain't wanna be like Him,. I wanna be Him. The Jack Sparrow of my Caribbean. I remember the first created being,. And how he shifted the blame on his dame. On fruit he should't have eaten. And now look at us all out of Eden,. And now look at us all that are eating,. Wearing designer fig leaves by Louis Vuitton. Make believe it But God sees through my foolish pride,. And I'm weak life Adam another victim. Of Lucifers foolish pride. But then in steps Jesus,. All men were created to lead but we need. Somebody to lead us. More than a teacher,. But somebody who buy us back from the darkness,. Say He redeemed us,. Taught us that real leaders follow God,. Finish the work ‘cuz we on our job. Taught us not to rob. But give life love a wife like He loved the Church,. Not seeing how many hearts we can break first. I wanna be like you in every way,. So if I gotta die everyday. Unworthy sacrifice. But the least I can do is give the most to me. Because being just like you is what I'm 'spose to be. You said you came for the lame,. I'm the lamest. I made a mess you say you'll erase it,. I'll take it. You said you came for the lame,. I'm the lamest. I broke my life, but you say you'll replace it,. I'll take it.. (I just gotta be like….)"

live free,"I know you hear this beat. it sound like somethin' to step with. But morals and your music, you want them separate. Like garnish on the side, somethin' y'all don't mess with. That Christo-centric rap, eclectic. You might like rap that's wild and reckless. A soap box for lots of young and restless. They got ya head bobbin' till ya lose ya necklace. Or better yet bobbin' till it leaves you neckless. You know where death is, where no more breath is. And 3rd graders learn how to leave you chestless. Where God is dissed, dismissed and distant. And far from their hearts cause they hard and wicked. Sin hates God for real. That's why He's rarely talked about. and He don't get the mass appeal. You might see sin blessin' a meal. That it eats while it cheats on the spouse. out seekin' a thrill. Hook. (Jai). I'm free from sin. I win, I win. I'm free, I'm free. And no more chains are holdin' me. I'm free from death. Got power now, me kill the flesh. I'm free, I'm free. I'm gone, I'm gone. (Lecrae). They walk in the church dressed flyer than sea birds. She came to see him, he hopin' to see her. They motives ain't right and they heart ain't either. Over God they choose to feed they fever. And he don't understand that it's Christ who bled for. Every second glance, every turn of his head yo. And she don't really get that Jesus did that. For everytime she fantasize about his six pack. They sure like Al B, to connect like his brows be. And with they bodies spit in God's face so foully. Sin's so bad, it's a liar. It says we on the throne, tells God to retire. It says He ain't enough, and it says we want more. It says He ain't just, it says He ain't Lord. Sin is the laugh at His power, the rape of His mercy. The mock of His patience, it says He ain't worthy. Hook. (Sho Baraka). I been duped and been schemed. Like the Lord was cool with my sinning. Mockin' the cross living unrepented. My sinful ways kept us so distant. We know He's Lord and been king. Let Him run your life like a Simmons. Then you'll start loving His righteousness. And we start looking just like His kids. Hook. Bridge. (Sho Baraka). Live free by His mercy and grace. Live free by His mercy and grace. and tell the world I'm gone. Live free by His patience and peace. Live free by His patience and peace. and tell the flesh I'm gone. Live free by His joy and love. Live free by His joy and love and tell the lust I'm gone. Live free by His truth and just. Live free by His truth and just and tell the hate I'm gone"

misconceptions 3,"[Verse 1: John Givez]. Fictitious foolies got me on a sick one. I'm still from Tha Side ready to die for the mission. Or meditate it, then I levitated. Elevated, celebrated. You should celebrate it, this is that embedded greatness. Good, good God. I'm a mad man, mathematics, statics. Stealin' the stars. I'm a bad man, bask into battle. I'm a battered mad hatter with the earth on a platter. Meek and mild 'til I get freakin' wild. It's a misconception messin' with your intellect. I reckon it'll be neck and neck. Before I let the deck eject the message. This is not a warning, this is what you wanted on the table. 'Crae, let 'em know the lil' homie willin' and able. It's Givez. [Verse 2: Jgivens]. Vegas, get active. Flippin' your city like gentrification. all in the ghetto upon a dirty mattress. Word to that sister actress. Nevada gets it crackin'. It's hot and J got a jacket. We'll peddle back if you askin' if love's a long practice. Full metal jacket dually known as a banana clip. when rappin'. That's a loaded magazine of ammunition. Plan out snippets so these magazines don't go bananas. Over loaded clips or flows floatin'. Only showin' sinkin' ships 10 of why he's frozen. Let it go, it's hotter than sprinters in Arizona. Juxtapose 'em to a snowman in Nova Scotia. It's rap's Christopher Nolan. Picture me rollin', pistol emoji, blaow!. This a misconception triple threat. Did Givens flex? Still a Christian? Yep. Don't need acknowledgement. just respect the conglomerate. Double tap it and follow it. They shocked to see us like Donald Trump. up in a taqueria. Watchin' Evita, cryin' over Argentina. Or Maria dominatin' Serena. I'm tryna find a big homie for Slim Jesus. Thesis of a new hope. More hardcore than Star Wars part four rated R. Or Rosa Parks or feet kicked off the bus exitin' starboard. Light saves like a time change. Hands up and down like a sine wave. Gospel be the humble, don't sleep the beast. is a mind frame. [Verse 3: Jackie Hill Perry]. They told me that rap was stacked. Is it tracks, is it facts?. Is it trap, is it rats?. When metaphors. you ready for the medics stored inside it. Is it similes or violence?. Is it sympathy or similar. The sinner's lord's inside 'em. The problem ain't wordplay. I get schizophrenic with sittin', straight jackin' the beat. Blood all on it, hashtag. A dracula scheme, trick or treat. It ain't magic, I'ma vanish when I pass to the team. 32, half that. Grab a 16 and let us shoot. Betty Boop wit the black top. I'm a mascot for tryna tell the truth. Locks all in my head, ain't no chain that I hang from. But He hang from where I came from, that's death. Guess what, I ain't done. I'm rappin'. Beneath it is Jesus reachin' for actors. Living halle', add the 'lujah with the asterisk. Correction, then bury the body under the mattress. Livin' my dream while you sleepin' in different caskets. [Verse 4: Lecrae]. Look, I was created to make a statement. A sentence sent us to earth on this mission. Tryna make a way for my siblings. Brothers and sisters who drinkin'. Out of them cisterns with cracks in 'em. Listen but lack hearin'. Who lookin' but lack vision. Initially made in the Lord's image, dynamic. Nothing lackin', magic couldn't make it happen. Look at us, you hear us rappin'. That ain't complaining but how can they be mad at all?. King dreamed a dream. but we seen scenes that'll make us awe. Change the channel, we channel all of this energy. Pretend to be savages, we ravage our so-called enemies. That look like us. But it look like us ain't gon' make it less we shake it. We can't look back much. Turned around to give a helping hand. I'm like, ""Man, they gon' make it. makin' baking soda boiling inside these pans"". Now they're wondering, is it rap or is it Gospel?. Look all you need to know is I was dead. now I'm not though. Real recognizing real, and if they don't love me like Pac. They better respect how I'm movin'. and that I'm never gon' stop. I hit my pastor on the cell, I said, ""I'm catching hell"". Well, what you think they did to Jesus?. Only time will tell. Can't believe we rap about the faith. and people like the sound. We out here workin' in the streets, you better ask around. Tell them other rappers we don't want it. they can have the crown. They have to lay it down. when you hear that trumpet sound. We know who got the keys to the kingdom. When the King come, crown Him, and your king dumb. if his kingdom ain't bout Him. Say it with your chest, when the bishop is the king. and the knight. The queen get the rest. I'm the only pawn that's on one, back in '01. I was wishin' labels signed me, but now I own one. That ain't braggin', that's just motivation. Get your education, this industry overrated. Satan-saturated. Folk be lyin' to your face, and sayin'. they glad you made it. Turn your back and you can hear 'em hatin'. in they conversation. Ooh, snake face with the same bait. And the same fate, fate, fate. that get your face ate (8) 08 bass. Nah, base like the base plate. How you runnin' home?. You ain't in that zone, they don't let it slide. You ain't safe. Wonder how do we survive in this suicide. do or die jungle?. Let the Spirit lead like He want to. [Outro: Lecrae]. Yeah, Misconceptions 3. Come and mess with we, yeah. Givens, Givez, Jackie, 'Crae, we out"

nuthin' (feat. dimitri mcdowell),"Here we go again in circles. I think I heard it all. We been here before. But we need something more. Something more. Something more. What you say. I can't hear cause you. Ain't talking 'bout nuthin (ain't talking 'bout nuthin). What you talking 'bout. They be talking 'bout the same old thing. Imma have to call a foul in the game. What you talking 'bout. A little money now you all OG. Talking 'bout it's all eyes on me. They ain't talking 'bout nuthin. Let me guess you counting money to the ceiling. Difference 'tween us like at least a couple million. It's foreign cars, pretty girls everywhere you go. Yeah I heard it 30 times on the radio. Lou Vuitton ain't gon' pay you for that bragging. And Donatella prolly never heard your album. Yeah they probably 'bout to label me a hater. But I know these people greater than the songs they created. It's little homies in the hood regurgitating. And everybody watching thinking that you made it. The truth is for a few designer labels and a little bit of paper now you 12 years slaving. Hey but you ain't Lupita. So why you beat up and pushing people to lean on a double cup. And a seizure. It sound like you put your feet up. You still a slave and money can't buy you freedom partna'.

Why the song on in my gym (what they saying now). And the song's stuck in my head (I can't take no more). I still don't know what y'all saying. Lemme lemme lemme do this. Imma be a straight shooter. Aye we was made in His image. Why we so Judas. Talking bread like we at the last supper. Throwing money at these women make it rain in the summer. I ain't advertising brands on the radio. They expensive and I know they ain't gon' pay me for. Telling kids to go in debt, for the 'vette that they'll prolly never get. But I talk about it every song. And every song talking 'bout they selling work on every corner. Don't talk about the laws, taking kids away from mommas. Don't talk about your homie in the trauma cause he shot up. Or what about your young boy messing up the product. They don't talk about the bond money that they ain't have. And everybody snitch on everybody in the jam. They don't talk about the pain, they don't talk about the struggle. How they turn to the Lord when they ran into trouble. Imma talk about it. I don't care if the world try to swallow me. I turn my back to 'em, tell 'em all follow me. I know you gon' label me a hater. But inside you are greater than the songs you creating man. Here we go again in circles. I think I heard it all.

They ain't talking 'bout nuthin. Hey man, the way I see it. I think we were made for more. Than just, ya know, the simple things that we aspire toward. We were made for more than just telling stories about. How much money we can get by selling poison to people. It's time to talk about who we are and who we can be. And we need to build each other up and not put each other down. I feel like we not talking about nothing right now"
outsiders,"I won't stay here another night. If I gotta sacrifice. Who I am on the inside. I'd rather be an outsider. And you can stay if you like. I'll see you on the other side. I wanna live the free life. I'd rather be an outsider. I really can't tell if I'm overdressed or I'm underdressed. If I'm underpaid or just overstressed. If I'm cynical or just over this. Cause I'm tired of tryna get over there. Man it's over there. Party's over. You probably couldn't tell we over here. Cause you hardly sober. Double shots of that ego. They laughin' at us, yeah we know. May be at the bottom but we not forgotten. The directors plotting that sequel. 'Til then we live on the outside. And it might storm and we might die. But I'd rather go with my fist high. Standing outside of your inside. I tried my best to fit in. Looking for a suit to fit in. Standing outside of your prison. Tryna find ways I can get in. Now I realize that I'm free. And I realize that I'm me. And I found out that I'm not alone. 'Cuz there's plenty people like me. That's right plenty people like me. All love me despite me. And all unashamed and all unafraid. To speak out for what we might see. I said there's plenty people like me. All outsiders like me. And all unashamed and all unafraid.

Time to go plus the line is long. I'mma color the outside where lines are drawn. If you wanna exclude me for being the true me. It's Gucci. I already found my home. Homesick. Homeless if I'm honest. 'Cuz my home is somewhere I ain't never been before. I'mma hone this here gift. Even if it doesn't fit in the box. That'll please these folks. Some of y'all gone need these quotes. I ain't tryna eat I'm tryna feed these folks. Martin, Mandella yeah we need these folks. We believe these folks. We could be these folks. But they want me to take an L. Tired of taking losses so they can call me a failure. I failed at being you. But I'm winning at being me. I'm winning at being free. Ain't no competition but me. See I realize that I'm free. And I realize that I'm me. And I found out that I'm not alone. And there's plenty people like me. I said there's plenty people like me. All outsiders like me. All unashamed and all unafraid.

Father, I'm prayin' for a friend he and I are pretty close, and out of all my friends for this one I'm concerned the most. He say he readin' daily but he ain't really learnin'. He been in church but say that he ain't moved by any sermon. His face weak, he ain't prayed in a week, he wake up and just weep with his face in the sink Lord, you gotta help my man, I'm prayin' for him daily, he ain't sinned but it just seem as if he goin' crazy. He say he feelin' trapped, can't even head up the mall coz every lady's half-dressed temptin' him to lust and fall. He keep the Tv off, videos just make him feel that he ain't really nothin' without money, girls and shiny wheels. The other day he told me that he felt less a man coz he ain't have a five-year plan or a piece of land and man it's crazy coz his family think so much of him, plus he got a godly wife who always showin' love for him but he's strugglin', even though he talk to me, I tell him what to do but he don't listen when he oughta' be. I'm scared for him coz there's people that look up to him, he got some younger siblings who been changed by what he's done for them but is it done for him, Lord don't let it be, if he don't wanna talk to you then Father hear from me, is it done for him, Lord don't let it be, if he don't wanna talk to you then Father hear from me.... Yeah, I'm prayin' for you, yeah, I'm prayin' for you. Yeah, I'm prayin' for you, yeah, yeah, I'm prayin' for you.... God, his condition is worsen since we were last conversed and I'm with him now and he ain't doin' well and this I'm certain. He say he tryna' trust you, doesn't wanna disgust you but he was in the mist of sinners and did not discuss you and just today his anxiety's got the best of him, he knows Christ but for hours refuse to rest in Him, he's not the best of men but Lord I know he really loves you and I can't understand why lately he's not thinkin' of you. People trust this dude, you could crush this dude, Father he needs more of you I pray you touch this dude, what can I say to him? I'm determined to pray for him Father empty and brake him I pray you'll just have your way with him, coz there's a change in him and the effects are strong, I pray you open up his heart before the next song and when he gets home, I pray he'll open up the sixty-six book love letter you wrote and soak it up coz he ain't hearin' You and he ain't feelin' me and God I know it's killin' You because it's killin' me and matter of fact there's somethin' else he's concealin' see, the person that I've been prayin' about is really me....

Get Krunk!. If you know you're repping Jesus go ahead and throw it up. [Verse One]. I know this might be a shock but, I'mma blow your spot up. Truthfully in Grace and out of Love, ain't trying to pop stuff. Heard ya pops locked up. Baby sister's knocked up. All your old boys from the block are getting shot up. I feel your pain homey, I got the same story. But since you came to Christ you got to bring His name Glory. No more living in the darkness, no more living heartless. Cause you got that Holy Spirit dwelling inside your carcass. Your life's been changed up, rearranged up. You've been reborn and you don't have to do the same stuff. You live regenerate, you get the benefit of Christ crucified. But you got to live in it, God is preeminent. And forgiveness is unlimited, but stop! and.... [Chorus]. [Verse Two]. From the flats to the drops to the burbs. Calling out to the cats who be dropping the word. Who be representing Christ, Not ashamed to share his life. Catching flack for his props in the world. To the cats that represent Him well while putting the Cross on the move. As they reaching for the cats who. Steppin into hell while they flossing new shoes. Packin gats and flossin new coupes. Making hoodrats doin' the do, acting a fool. But the jigga that figures pullin the trigger. With vigor can make him bigger needs to get in with the Cox Grave Digger. Cause you live a life sin thats the wages of death. If you livin by the gun that's the way into debt. But if you living the life and living it right. Put your fist in the sky with all of your might. Til you way out of breath, chest pumping all hard due to heavy palpitations. Thirsting for the Lord with Heavy salivation. But you ain't fraud you'll pull a sinners card. Cause you love the Lord and His habit of salvation repping like Steven. Getting stoned for the stone you believe in. Or slinging the stone into the dome of the heathen Philistine men. [Chorus]"

Girl in my rear view tryna tell me (uh oh). Cause she knew wasn't nothing you could tell me. Always on a trail of another female. Well, well they say my papa was a player. Somebody's honesty is honest in me baby. Somehow in college greek letters made me cuter. All the time online I still couldn't compute it. Uh, I pledge girls then it's on to the next girl. My next girl eventually be my ex girl. But its' funny how it all unfolds. I done finally found a woman I ain't never letting go whoa. Ooh she looking bad (don't do it). I wonder if she got a man (don't do it). I don't see no wedding band (don't do it). I promise you don't wanna go through it (take it from me). You don't want no problems (you don't want no problems). You don't want no problems (you don't want no problems). You don't want no problems (you don't want no problems). Find yourself in the obituary [?]. It ain't nothing like a good woman. If you got you one of those, be good to 'em. Keep it a honey love, everybody want it. But the lies and the lust keep lying next to us, but. I got past, and I'm known to pass it. Up from my passion and I ain't here blastin'. Born a sinner just like any man standing. Couldn't keep standing so God sent a stand-in. If you creepin' when you feel desire creepin'. I know another way to win that don't involve cheating. Don't involve another heart broken into pieces. When a girl call you tell you she saw you on peach st. Meet pretty underscore nice features. Had a couple drinks and have yourself a little peace and. Now you feel like the man in the streets pull 'em to the crib. I see your pants in the street, man. Baby, why are all my clothes in the street?. Oh, you don't know why your pants is in the street?. Hah, yeah, shiquita told me she seen you on peach st.

Also I'm rockin' the speedo. This that casino, you bet your revenue. Thinking you'll stop me, no never not letting you. You must be high on that medical thinking I won't. But I know better, know that I bet I do, yup! (kill 'em, ooh). Say I won't (why y'all scared to be different?). Say I won't (why y'all scared to be different, huh?). Say I won't (we them outsiders, that's just how we live it). Say I won't (and I bet I will you can). Say I won't. I might do it just to show you. We be like la, la, la, la. Say I won't sell my shoes and take my kids to Chuck E Cheese with the money. Say I won't bring my own bottle of Pellegrino to the movies with me. Say I won't. Look, I'm from an era of fast living and mass terror. Boys cover them cover girls like mascara. I don't need to keep a gun and a mask ever. I still make 'em put their hands up, ask Derek. My road manager damage all of you amateurs. Sneaking up on a tour bus with a demo to hand to us. When I was younger, I just wanted a chain. Now a chain of events has afforded a change. See, I been a rebel since back in the day, I don't follow the people. I follow the leader through valleys and shadows of death and I fearin' no evil. So say I won't do it, say I won't turn the music up and get to it. Won't come down H-Town all the way to their town. In the old school, drop top Buick. And I'm getting, maybe 8 or 9 miles to the gallon. Still feeling like a stallion. I got Andy riding shotgun with 30 gold chains on, talking about he Italian. Say I won't go drop a double album, and rap double time on all dub-step. Got no producers, just me rocking over beatboxing by Dougie Fresh. Say I won't. Say I won't (why y'all scared to be different?). Say I won't (why y'all scared to be different, huh?). Say I won't (we them outsiders, that's just how we live it). Say I won't (and I bet I will you can). Say I won't. I might do it just to show you. We be like la, la, la, la"
send me,"Send me I'll go,. send me I'll go,. send me I'll go,. lemme go lemme go!. (repeat x4). i seen it with my own two,. there's no way i can show you. a perfectly poverty stricken people with no view.. And i bet you can't believe this,. they never heard of jesus.. Heard young butler, lil wayne, and young jeezy.. No one's signing up to go on missions this summa.. Rather sit at home and watch exibit pimp in a humma. while a nine year old is shot down.. No one's screaming 'stop now!'. no bridge illustrations for criminals who on lock down.. People deep in africa. looking for an answer bra'.. In china man,. they're dieing man,. until they know who died for sins.. So look what grace did.. Not for us to stay here. inside our comfort zones. at home in mama's basement.. Get out on the grind y'all.. Ain't no better time doll.. I know y'all read the great commission.. Let me just remind y'all:. make disciples of the nations.. Teach'm to obey the lord.. Have to lead someone to christ before i face the lord.. Send me I'll go,. send me I'll go,. send me I'll go,. lemme go lemme go!. (repeat x4). hey! After, 1,000 years in the west and the churches. get'n bigger daily without understand'n worship. (say what?). Some regenerate but a lot ain't saved.. You walk outside and be surprised cuz the block ain't changed.. And the numbers they be get'n me.. Something just ain't hit'n them.. America ain't christian they practice'n the ritual.. That's why we should be mission though.. Hey, what you think i'm spit'n for?. The united states is die'n. and in the east is looking pitiful.. Some places if they catch you. they'll arrest you.. They'll serve you,. but they still need the word too.. The gospel should be heard too.. We claim we ain't ashamed,. but we ain't hit the block up.. Were in our christian bubble,. while our brotha's get'n locked up.. Lord i wanna stock up,. pack a bag and walk up. in a country where my faith may get me shot up. anywhere i go, whether my city or far abroad,. i just wanna show' christ the risen holy god.. Send me I'll go,. send me I'll go,. send me I'll go,. lemme go lemme go!. (repeat x4). i know they're die'n in the streets over in the middle east.. Some kids sink in piece. others hold'n up a piece.. If the violence doesn't cease,. then at least the deceased. might know jesus as their savior as their bodies hit the streets.. And i know this is a graphic view.. And i pray that it's attack'n you.. Track'n you to act and do. what you see in the back illusion.. Mathew twenty-four and fourteen.. We should read it twice. before we think that life is just a battle. see we free in christ!. Look dawg! Life is more than church work and football!. What if you were dead and seen that christians overlooked y'all!. This is why we leave the couch. and leave the comforts of our house. to show a die'n world a god they'll probably never read about.. The great commission says make disciples of all nations.. Have we even made them in our own nation?. Come on christians!. Missions exist because worship doesn't.. People don't worship the god who made them.. We're ambassadors.. Let's go!. Send me I'll go,. send me I'll go,. send me I'll go,. lemme go lemme go!. (repeat x4)"
sidelines,"[Intro]. One thousand. Biz busy on the boards. I hear 'em cheering from the sidelines. Wait, hold up, I think they hatin'. People told me take my time, right?. Nah, they tired of waitin'. They say ""Crae, you sold your soul, man"". For real? Who bought it?. ""Let the Spirit take control, man"". I don't go nowhere without Him. [Verse 1]. They scared that I'ma cause these babies to stumble. They scared that my integrity is gon' crumble, appreciate the prayers. But all that pressure either gon' make you humble. Or make you hang out on the sidelines, and fear you gon' fumble. Put me in coach, ain't out here flexin' for nobody. I was born to do it, God don't make mistakes and say I'm sorry. He ain't never dropped the ball. I don't never plan to fumble. Catch me runnin' with them lions. Reggie Bushin' in the jungle. Came from nothin'. I remember spendin' summers on the corner with my cousin Shootin' dice and playin' dozens. Me and Bj in that Cutlass, Cd playin' missin' buttons. Up at Lincoln High in Dallas with that Jesus Muzik bumpin'. Now it's Joseph graduation. Turn on that radio and T-Dot on the station. I remember when we used to split the rent up. Ugk was bangin' loud inside his pickup. Wait, let me pick up. Back when promoters wouldn't let me back in. 'Less I pay 'em on a back end, that ain't happenin'. We just pray to God that somehow He would let us crack in. Tore that door off of them hinges. Told us, ""Get it crackin'"". [Hook]. I hear them cheering from the sidelines. People told me take my time, right?. Hear 'em cheerin' from the sidelines. Hold up, I think they hatin'. People told me take my time, right?. They tired of waitin'. [Verse 2]. They braggin' they in the buildin'. Ain't building nothin'. We out here building the children, you know I love 'em, boy. Spit it how I live, feel it in my breath. Walking it like I talk, put it to the test. Gina, get to steppin, we get to startin'. You dream of bein' a king but you watchin' the wrong Martin, Bruh Man. This ain't the fifth floor, it's the penthouse. Either you change your outlook or get out. And life ain't never been a dream, you just oversleepin'. If it wasn't hard work, they probably cheatin'. Give that arrogance some rest. This ain't happen overnight, that's why I do this thing to death. I might do this 'till I'm deaf, dumb and blind. You know I don't need my eyes to see my faith working fine. Never mind me. I ain't worried about how they define me. Long as they can find me they'll never confine me. [Hook]. I hear them cheering from the sidelines. People tell me take my time, right?. I hear 'em cheering from the sidelines. Hold up, I think they hatin'. People tell me take my time, right?. They tired of waitin'"

strung out,"(Hook). How could I love you, when all you ever did was wrong. How could I trust you, you lied to me all along. You strung me out. (Verse 1). I'm going through withdrawals, the shakes and all. You did me dirty, I almost died dawg. I let you play me and plus you gave me. All the filthy things I wanted all my sinful cravings. But I see you, yeah you see through. Somebody opened up my eyes and I don't need you. I gotta leave you before you take my life. I used to date you then I went ahead and made you wife, yeah. You had me feeding for the stuff you offer. You such a scoffer I know you want me in my coffin. But girl you already lost it, your ways are perished. Thank you God for your salvation this is what I cherish. (Hook). How could I love you, when all you ever did was wrong. How could I trust you, you lied to me all along. You strung me out. (Verse 2). I'm out your grip, I'm out your grasp. You had me mesmerized, you had me in your hands. Lust of the eyes, the pride of life. You offered me the world, you made it look so nice. You took me high but left me down and out. I run right back to you thinking that you would help me out. You never satisfy, you only gratify. You're just a bad illusion to every passerby. And I don't want you round, you only bring me down. So glad I quit you, I don't miss you cos you had me bound. So get gone. (Hook). How could I love you, when all you ever did was wrong?. How could I trust you, you lied to me all along?. You strung me out. (Bridge). Do not love the world or the things in the world.. If anybody loves the world, the love of God is not in him.. The world is passing away along with its desires but. Whoever does the will of God lives forever.. I know it hurts sometimes, we gotta go through withdrawal,. It's me that's strung out. (Hook). How could I love you, when all you ever did was wrong?. How could I trust you, you lied to me all along?. You strung me out"
the good life,"We can live it. We can live it. We can live it, that good life. Yeah, so we can live it. Yeah, that good life. That good life. Now, we can live it. Yeah, we can live it. Yeah, good life. What he need god for? he got money to the heavens. Never pulled a 187, but he preach it like a reverend. Never satisfied with second. Except for second home, second car, second woman on his arm, second bottle from the bar. Good life, even though he got it, he don't get it. 'cause he livin' for the moment, but this moment has an endin'. Matter fact it's been a minute, all he see is pretty women. Big lights big names, in a minute that'll change… bang!. Caught up in an all-consuming flame. All alone, still rejecting jesus' name. But even if he could change he would never do it. Grandma told him 'bout the living water, he prefer the sewage. He don't know why he do it, desires just enslave him. Addicted to himself, do whatever just to praise him. Give himself the money, pleasure and treasure that'll rust. When he traded his eternity for 20 years of lust. Where the bottle go pop, models go shop. Everyone knows who you are. But then the lights turn on, curtains fall off. You see it all was false. But that's the good life. Lights, camera, action. Where is the satisfaction?. Good life…. Black diamonds and gold. Livin' highest when you live on the low. I take the narrow route, that speedway's a monsta. It's all good, I go to sleep without a guilty conscience. For that they call me conscious, but I'm very conscious. Of what I'm missin', I ain't trippin' on the girls in vip. Frontin' for each other. They actin' like they somethin' that they not, they undercover. Tryin' to get under covers, but one day they'll discover. They gave parts of theyself away that they'll never recover. A part time lover took a fulltime pay. God please show her mercy, her affliction's here to stay. She just found out she pregnant and the child has been infected (my lord). What's worse thah that, she'll never meet the guy that she rejeceted. The one that can protect her, comfort her to the grave. And resurrect her body to live with jesus who saves. Can't say that god ain't love her, she wanted to be a slave. This is a cruel master leavin' her full of pain. Where the bottle go pop, models go shop. Everyone knows who you are. But then the lights turn on, curtains fall off. You see it all was false. But that's the good life. Lights, camera, action. Where is the satisfaction?. Good life…. Black diamonds and gold. Livin' highest when you live on the low. 50 years from now, he may be full of gray hair, beard long. And even closer to a home that he's never known. Right now his home facin' 25-to life. Sittin' in the county jail, court appointed lawyer like. If this case is tina turner, homie, I am not ike. Got his momma cryin' daily but she prayin' every night. Only 20 but there's plenty that he payin' with his rights. Thought he got a life sentence but he really got life. He done read that bible twice. Been in plenty fights, sleepless nights. But when he trusted christ you could see that change overnight. Knew he'd die in prison but was livin' for another life. Everytime his lights out he closer to the other side. Partners on the outside think he found religion as a. Coping mechanism when he say the lord's risen. Now he lay awake in prison prayin' for his homies in the streets. 'cause truth is, he's free-er than they gon' ever be. Where the bottle go pop, models go shop. Everyone knows who you are. But then the lights turn on, curtains fall off. You see it all was false. But that's the good life. Lights, camera, action. Where is the satisfaction?. Good life…. Black diamonds and gold. Livin' highest when you live on the low. We can live it, that good life. Yeah, so we can live it. Yeah, that good life. That good life. Now, we can live it. Yeah, we can live it. Yeah, we can live it. Yeah, good life"

timepiece,"Lights off. Ain't nobody watching me. I heard about the man in the sky. But he probably fell asleep. Yeah, and you say Audemars, Audemars, Audemars. But still don't know the time that sun comes down from the stars. Yeah, they say that time waits for no man. Nah, hey probably lyin'. Cause time wait on me like a servant all of the time. But I know some people who actually serving time. Committed to this grind, or just committed some crime. Sometimes I wish some more time to think. And all the time in the world is all the time I need. And I know eternity's calling but my mind too busy racing to pay any mind. Spend a whole lot of money on a watch. Ironic cause I got it but I hardly sit and watch the time tick by. I spend time trying to buy it to own time. Never thought that I was only wasting my own time. Who holds time?. They say he'll be coming in no time. Pray I pay attention, cause I'm giving him no time. When the lights off, is anybody watching me?. Heard the man above never slumber, never sleep. On the corners, in the alleys. I see coners and cowards. Scared to question their existence like ain't no final hour. Can we blame the sins of a reverend for all our irreverence?. Does my time spent on earth qualify me for heaven?. Did we tick him off by wasting all these ticks on this clock?. Or is he graciously giving me time to give him my heart?. I'm sure it's the latter, sure that it matters. And I believe I've been given all this time so I could try to redeem it. Or make the most of this stopwatch that I'm racing. You stop the watch you ain't racing. You erasing your minutes, you can't replace 'em. And at the end of your days when eternity's in your face. You'll have one life to offer up and it's service to lay to waste. So my Rollie's telling me to roll out. Make investments with my time while I'm tryna hold out. And fame, money, success be competing for my investments. But I can't take 'em with me when it's time for me to exit"
wait,"That man don't love you like he need to. If he ain't following Christ, he can't lead you. I ain't tryin' to deceive you. I know he look better than most men. But without Christ, looks are no reason for bragging and boasting. You got your heart on him. Now you can't depart from him. You knew from the beginning not to even start on him. Compromising your faith for sex. Hurting yourself and God. Cause you outside of marital context. What's next?. Mami show respect for your body. Instead of getting naked and naughty. Like sex is a hobby. You know what you're supposed to do. Let him loose and cling to the God that wants to get close to you. You've been blessed as a chosen few. Mami, if ain't rollin' wit Christ. Then don't let him roll wit you. Cause you've been blessed as a chosen few. And if ain't rollin' wit God. Then don't let him roll wit you. WAIT!. CHORUS:. I know you're the apple of momma's eye. A star in your daddy's sky. But God knows you living a lie. You giving a guy, everything your husband deserves. It's absurd. Don't follow your feelings, just follow The Word. You wanna be in a relationship. Well, you can give him your all, but how deep can the relations get. If your God's on the sideline. You won't be happy I promise. Until you understand, that God is the lifeline. He ain't pleased with lust. So even if it feels right. Remember, he ain't pleased with us, when we. Let our emotions loose without a ring on the finger. It's only gonna come back to sting ya. Don't let the singers sing you sweet lullabies. Without giving The King's sweet love a try. It ain't none better. Who else you know,that would give up his life. Just to love you forever. WAIT!. CHORUS:. . I know you thought that ya'll could win together. Ya'll been together. But all ya'll do is sin together. You're wasting your own time. You keep deceiving your mind. Saying that this is part of God's design. Knowing he treating you good. Know his ways is nice. But he can't love you like he should. He's not engaged to Christ. And you know this ain't the man for you. But you hold on like God ain't got better plans for you. The whole worlds says 'you should be dating'. God says you should be serving him while your patiently waitin'. Everybody rushin and racin. Huggin' and kissin' and hold hands, all before their days end. Yea, I know it's hard but TRUST. I wouldn't waste my breath on this song if it wasn't a MUST. The same God that made you. The same God that died for your sins and saved you. HE ain't tryin' to play you, WAIT!. CHORUS:. Your ready to go'..wait!. Can't take no more'.wait!. I know it's hard but, God is never late. Don't follow your feelings'wait!. Just follow HIS Will and'..wait!. Girl, serve the Lord and don't anticipate.. WAIT!"
we don't,"[Verse One]. I'm not the standard at all and wouldn't claim to be. But since Christ snatched me up theres been a lot of change in me. I got my world view corrected; I see things eternal. Yeah I've got a whole new perspective. I don't use drugs or sell. I keep acountabilty cause my flesh...yeah it loves to fail. I don't go where I used to go. I got my number changed twice for the girls that I used to know. I don't trip when I pass the cops. cause I'm not making assists; you know trying to pass the rock. I don't live life scared of death. cause when I take my last breath. The next step is there in text. I'm not a legalist and I aint hatin'. but there's things I don't and won't do; yeah I read Galatians. And I keep reading Ephesians if it's Christ we believe in. We should't be confused with the heathens. [Chorus]. You gonna ride with us?. Nah I don't do that there!. You gettin' high with us?. Nah I don't do that there!. You wanna hit a lick (theft)?. Nah I don't that there!. Get a couple chics?. Uh Unh I don't do that there!. [Verse Two]. Man I don't trip of coppin' whips. If it aint a DVD you won't catch me pop in clips.. I aint worried chains or shoes. My God's thinkin' bout whether to change the city sky from Greys to blues. I don't care about the famous names. Cause when Christ comes back a lot of folks will be nameless man. and I aint worried about speakin his name. cause if it wasn't for Christ yeah we'd all be sinkin in flames. I don't even wanna ""change the game"". Your'e favorite rapper got saved last night. Yeah that's the aim. The world wer'e livin in is simply tempting. So I quit consenting to my flesh when it tries to pimp me. Until I die or Christ comes to get me. I aint doing what this world wants to do. Now is ya wit me? (Are you with me?). [Chorus]. [R-Swift]. Yo I'mma keep it short simple and plain. I used to fiend for the pimp game. Til I got with Christ and switched my aim. Flipped my pain to a burden to grab hip-hop, his name and merge it. with His word as the plate then serve it. Cats are like ""who you serve kid?"" It's gotta be HIM. who wiped my sin slate clean like Oxy 10. I rock Christ from PA to Dallas. R-Swift and LeCrae walk in the Spirit til our feet ache with callous. Naw I'm buggin, but for real my point is. with Christ life is pointless; this joint is. For the prisoners trapped on the block where blasted shots cause cats. to drop like temperatures. Without Christ and restoration. your chance of makin it is slimmer than Blacks getting reparations. Jesus Christ man the Ancient of Days. Get with HIM for eternal life and pass the phrase!. [Chorus]"
welcome to america,"Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon from the flight deck. We're cruising at 37, 000 feet and we just passed over the coast We'll be beginning our descent in about 30 minutes. I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you to America. I was made in America. Land of the free, home of the brave. And right up under your nose. You might see a sex slave being traded. And we'll do anything for the money. Boy, a mama might sell her babies. Sell porn, sell pills. Anything to pay the bills. Anything to bring that pay. Gotta scratch that itch. Gotta scratch them ticks. Ain? t rich, but I might be. And Imma shoot these flicks, Imma turn these tricks. Anything for a slight fee. Yeah made in America. Momma told me that I belong here. Had to earn our stripes, had to learn our rights. Had to fight for a home here. But I wouldn't know a thing about that. All I know is drugs and rap. I probably could have been some kinda doctor. Instead of holding guns and crack. I was born in the mainland. Great-Grandpa from a strange land. He was stripped away and given bricks to lay. I guess you could say he a slave here. But I was made in America. So I don? t know a thing about that. All I know is Uncle Sam looking for me working on his corner. So I know I gotta pay tax. Getting paid in America. I was raised in America. And this is all I ever known. If I? m wrong then you better come save me America. Ta na na na muchawa muchawa. Ta na na na muchawa muchawa. Ta na na na muchawa muchawa. Ta na na na muchawa muchawa. Welcome to America (x5). Man I? d die for America. I served my time for America. Got shot-shot back went to war. Got back and ain? t nobody give a jack in America. I could lost my life boy I lost my wife. I can? t even get right in my home land. Cold sweats, whole ticks, paranoia. Looking out for a threat in own land. I was trained in America. How they get up in the planes in America. Flew them right into the buildings. Taking out civilians. People getting killed in America?. And I? m still in America. Though America ain? t feeling me. I went to war for this country. Turn around came home and you drilling me. When y? all free here saying you don? t wanna be here. Boy you probably couldn't breathe here. If I didn? t load a couple magazines here. Y? all just complain in America. I? m jumping out of military planes from America. Aye, I was made in America. Thats why I? m out here saving America. I got a brother in the cemetery now. Cause he wanted y? all safe. And everybody want the freedom but nobody want to hear ""about face! "". We bled for America. To keep y? all fed in America. But what's the point of talking. A lot of y? all don? t really even care America. Ta na na na muchawa muchawa ta na na na. Ta na na na muchawa muchawa ta na na na. Welcome to America (x5). Ta na na na muchawa. Ta na na na muchawa. Ta na na na muchawa ta na na na na. I wish I lived in America. Wanna raise my kids in America. Heard everybody rich. All I gotta do is run, jump, kick. I'm a hit in your area. So please pick me America. I know you probably never loved me. You never hear about me on the news. And you probably never been to my country. I hear you selling education and got clothes that you throw away. Got plenty food in your nation. I could tell cause a lot of y? all are over weight. I already work for y? all. I? m at a sweatshops making these shirts for y? all. Naw, I ain? t gettin money. Go to bed hungry, but I make some exports for y? all. But y? all don? t know a thing about that. You was made in America. I? m trying to find me a ticket where the sky is the limit. Catch a plane to America. It should be plain to America. Y? all blessed and you got it made. Heard y? all don? t play no more, y? all ain? t saved no more. Y? all looking for another way. Well I hope it ain? t true, but I? m packing my suit. Farewell to my mother land. Said bye to my loved ones. Fate here I come, I? m going to another land. I done made it to America. I? m amazed at America. But I couldn? t get approval to stay so they sent me away from America"
who u wit,"Verse 1: You know I'm still on a mission, man, I'm still gon' be spittin 'til I spill my intentions and you got saved and was reppin'. Then you strayed from the message, now you stay half-steppin boy. It's real. Yeah, people still dyin, still cryin on the inside, Satan still lyin. Still tryna show the world how coo you is. Aint' got a clue about whose you is. Get wit' the program, let 'em know, man. It's willing to fear, it's never been a show man. It ain't about hot beats and a flow man. But when you go, tell me where you gon' go man. Is it the world or Christ? The girls and ice. Five minutes of fame or eternal life? Who u wit? Choose correctly. Think who protects me? When I reject him, who accepts me?. Hook: Who u wit? Are you in it to win man? Are you livin' in sin or are you livin' through him man? Who u wit? Can't walk the fence y'all. It's God or the world 'cause the two don't mix y'all. Who u wit? What you need in life? The world can't give it to you. What you need is Christ. Who u wit? If you know who you serve, and you roll with the word, and you so sincerr.. Verse 2: A lot of people live for the moment, they want it, they gotta flaunt it, they worship the money and the fast life. You hear 'em on the radio and see 'em on TV in the sleazy scenes and then they wanna thank Christ. Man, I'm not above that. I see 'em in my backyard. Dudes act hard, but I know they really lack God. They don't know that God is holy. He oppose the proud, but exalt the lowly. That's why I'm rollin' wit' Him. My soul is wit' him. My treasure's are up in Heaven. Yeah, my gold is wit Him. Go wit God or just don't go. You either watered down or you just don't know. And I'ma say this straight so you do, man, it's true what they say. Ain't no maps to Heaven. It's only one way. You heard it all of your life. The word is right. If you ain't servin' Christ, then turn tonight.. Hook. Verse 3: I used to be the dude talkin' 'bout 'Only God can judge me. You can't tell me nothing man. Jesus love me.' But here I go again with the same ol' sin. The same ol' friends. Comin' to the same ol' end. It's like cheatin' on a test that you know you can't pass. Still got to wait for teachers. Rap after class. No point in doin' it. You're ruinin your life. Tryna live it for the world instead of livin' it for Christ. I promise there's no extra love for bein bigger than Fifty, Diddy, and Biggie in the Heavens above. If you really like aborigine act it out. Be Heavens biggest promoter. Try to pack it out. You could win you a crown and be down with the team. And know that the bloodstream of Elohim redeems. It's Jesus. I don't say nothing else y'all. You ain't down with him, you ain't down at all"
will you take me as i am,"[Talking]. Christ through faith. I talked to a cat the other day. And he was like;. ""Man I really wanna come to Christ. But I gotta clean my life up first, get my sins together"". I told em, I used to think that way too. I thought I had to change myself before I could come to Christ. But Christ changed me. Let me tell you my story, it starts like this. [Verse One]. It's 5:46 in the mornin', tossin' and turnin'. Chest burnin', sermons in my head keep reocurrin'. Havin' visions in my head of a kid. Cryin' at the feet of the Father, for all the wrong things that he did. Now I'm sweatin' in my sheets can't sleep. My mind keeps tellin' me I'm six feet deep. Don't remind me, even though I'm still alive I can't tell. The way I'm living my life I feel I'm going to hell. God they telling me I should accept you. That you had to leave the world, cause the world left you. Reason I can't change, like a mystery to me. So I make believe there really is a heaven for a G. Even though they say you loved the world so much, you shed ya blood. God I feel I'm too messed up for love. They tell me come as I am but I smell like smoke. My whole lifes full of sin cause it's all I know. The bible told me that you died for my sins. If I believe in Christ, it'll save me from the end. But I'm scared to ask you, to save me my heart. So evil, I got thoughts, that's full of hatred hurtin' people. I thought at first I had to clean up my life. Now I'm hearin' I just need to cling to the light. I'm ready to do it, but Lord I pray you understand. My life is a mess, will you take me as I am. [Chorus]. Will you take me as I am. I know the way I'm living is wrong. But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone. I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly. But you came down and died for me. Will you take me as I am. I know the way I'm living is wrong. But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone. I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly. But you came down and died for me. Will you take me as I am. [Verse Two]. I'm sick and tired of trying to me the man, my daddy never taught me to be. I'm grown up now, life ain't what I thought it would be. I made many mistakes in my past I can't fix. Now I'm staring at this crusifix tatted on my wrist. Is it true what they telling me, am I just crazy. Did ya bleed on the cross, for my sins to save me. But why would ya die for me. My whole life I've been working for Satan, while He fed lies to me. And now I'm hearing too much, trying to get a true touch. Of a love that can change me, I'm all screwed up. Figure Hell is what I deserve. But your word says we all fall short so I guess we all outta burn. Teach me I wanna learn. How you could save a wretch like me, before death says it's my turn. I think I finally understand. No matter my past, you'll still take me as I am. [Chorus]. [Verse Three]. My father had a few last words to give. I be telling people the reason to live. The reason to die, united with the King in the sky. This life is passing us by, I got no reason to lie. You'll never give the world enough, they'll hunger for more. They figure there ways are nuthin to the wonderous lord. More security than the man that left you. More love than the moms who kept you. He'll always accept you. Be everything your supposed to. Let Christ rule ya heart, mind, body and soul cause He chose you. And if the world don't know you. It don't matter you're Gods child and he'll never disown you. Ya purpose on earth is far from worthless. That's why ya glorified like ya life's been purchased. And it don't matter if the world don't seen us. We still mean the world to Jesus. [Chorus]. [Talking]. Yeah, we're saved by grace through faith. It's not works. Ain't nuthin you can do, ain't nuthin I can do. That could get us this grace salavation that we got man. It's only Christ. So if you feel like you gotta clean yourself up. Before you can come to Him. Forget it. Just come to Him. He'll take you as you are, and he'll change You. From the inside, out"
wish,"[Verse 1:]. Yeah. I wish I never held back. Wish nobody had to sell crack. Then I may have seen my dad a little more. Maybe I can dream a little more. But I still wishing on stars in the sky. Wish a lot of people (was a lie?). And I probably passed on a whole lot of truth. But I know about a whole lot of lies. Man I wish I had me a time machine. I would tell Martin it was all a dream. And I wish like Ray Jay back in 06. Guess it worked 'cause I got my chick. And I wish like [?] did. If I could change the clock. Man I'd change a lot. And I probably wouldn't be so selfish. I woulda gave a lot. Man I'm ashamed of that. I wish I coulda told [?] thank you. Before it got way too late. I wish I woulda worked on my jump shot. But time just fades away. I probably wish too much. I know I play less than I should. I know I did too much. I take it all back if I could. [Hook:]. Wish I had another chance. Maybe I'll do better [x3]. Every time I think about all of my mistakes. I just wanna turn it around. Be like oh oh oh ooh oh. Oh oh oh ooh oh. If I never went there, I would never know. Oh oh oh ooh oh. Oh oh oh ooh oh. Maybe I can turn it around. [Verse 2:]. I wish I didn't do it but I did it. Man it happened last night. Man I wish I would try to act like you ain't never lost your sight. And I don't even do it for the money. Except when I do it for the money. Trying to find yourself and you find yourself doing things in the dark kinda funny. I wish I had ten more wishes. I swear I got ten more visions. And life is a game that I can't stop playing. Baby gimme like ten more minutes. I'm almost finished. I wish I had a little more time. I gotta whole lot of goals I wish I could achieve, I believe Imma lose my mind. Before I get to those. Yeah I miss the goals. But my shot was off. Can't tell what I lost until I count the cost. But I probably missed my calling. Wish I was a little bit taller. Wish I was a baller. Then again every time I get a little money. I be looking at the next man like he smaller. I can't call it. And I wish I didn't go and get high on the one first date. I was all zoned out, paranoid like ""did you hear that noise"". And I know she probably thinking I'm cray (crae). No pun intended. I wish I repented. A little bit quicker. Then again I didn't pull the trigger. I know I said I have no regrets but I sure do wish every chance I get go figure. [Hook]"
