infra-red,"One last thing before i shuffle off the planet,. I will be the one to make you crawl,. So i came down to wish you and unhappy birthday.. Someone call the ambulance..There´s gonna be an accident.. I´m coming up in infrared, there is no running that can hide you,. coz i can see in the dark.. I´m coming up on infrared, forget your running, I will find you.. One moe thing before we start the final face-off,. I will be the one to watch you fall,. So i came down to crash and burn your begger´s banquet.. Someone call the ambulance..There´s gonna be an accident.. I´m coming up in infrared, there is no running that can hide you,. coz i can see in the dark.. I´m coming up on infrared, forget your running, I will find you.. (find you). [Instrumental]. I´m coming up in infrared, there is no running that can hide you,. coz i can see in the dark.. I´m coming up on infrared, forget your running, I will find you.. I´m coming up in infrared, there is no running that can hide you,. coz i can see in the dark.. I´m coming up on infrared, forget your running, I will find you.. I´m coming up in infrared, there is no running that can hide you,. coz i can see in the dark.. I´m coming up on infrared, forget your running, I will find you.. find you.. find you.. find you."
interludio - stupid is as stupid does,"Oh, stupid is as stupid does. What kind of nonesense is this?. We're in a stupid time. Not stupid like stupid fresh. But like a stupid Duh!. We're getting stupider by the nanosecond. But we think we`re so smart 'cause we follow the leader!. But only cause we are so stupidfied-er!. Civilization and evolution can only take us so far,. It's up to the individual to unstupify - his self!. The stupification from mass media lies. And corporate ties. Colaborate to keep us intoxified. But start the dechurchification. As an indication of unstupification. By just asking one goddamm question.. Oh get inside yourself and listen.. The truth will set you free from the mass media apocalypse.. It?s the only antidote to the epidemic. Of the army of stupid is as stupid does."
