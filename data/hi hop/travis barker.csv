"let's go (feat. yelawolf, twista, busta rhymes & lil jon)","[Intro: Lil Jon]. Travis Barker, yeah!. Le-Le-Let's Go!. Lil' Jon, Yelawolf!. Le-Le-Le-Let's Go!. Twista, and my homeboy, Busta Rhymes!. Holla at 'em!. [Verse 1: Busta Rhymes + (Lil Jon)]. Before I. Take another minute just to give everybody a movie. Never seen and hit 'em with another elbow. Let me get up everybody that be moving with The Conglomerate. On your mark, so you ready? (Let's go). Wow! Ok, here we go again you see the way I'm blowin and. I'm like a Mangele the way that I be mangling the beat. they call me Dracula then you see the Fangs going in. Wow! Uh-huh, everybody know that I'mma come and I'mma go. Then I gotta do what I be coming in to do. Embody the beat you know the way we do that at my show. Keys to the ignition and step on the gas (Let's go). And bust a bottle and pour me a shot in my glass (Let's go). Where we at? Where we at? Where we at?. And we back up in the building and we coming with a scorcher. Y'all already know who it is. It's Busta Bust and Travis Barker. Back to the beat, T.B. gotta go. Hit you with the fire trucks. Everybody better know. That we 'bout to let it blow and we gotta get it, yo. Everybody if you really with me. (Let's go). [Hook: Lil Jon] x3. Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. [Verse 2: Twista]. I already spit it to the rhythm of the piano. So now I gotta give the drummer some. Put the T up on the track, I'll be phenomenal. 'Cause when it come to havin' a hit, I'mma make another one. Blink 182 times when you see the Twista with Travis, madness. Kind of like a savage, grab it and murder with the art like blood on the a canvas. And it's kind of impeccable how I can spit it. And then get up in the middle with intricate patterns of a kick drum. Diabolical, the lyrical flow that'll swallow if your theoretical thinking that you can get some. I'mma hit 'em with a Lamborghini flow with the speed of a Bugatti. I'm from another planet when I spit a verse with the weed in my body. And I'mma hurt 'em every time I get up in the booth, sipping on the liquor 182 proof. Now they wanna say they should've never let me loose. Outta the cage, now come and see what I'mma do. It's Twista the Jason of rap on the track and I'll hit you wit the Midwest flow. Even if you ain't ready yet, all I gotta say is ready set. (Let's go). [Hook: Lil Jon] x3. Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. [Verse 3: Yelawolf]. Drive by, hit you with the two piece combo. While I'm hangin' out the window of your Daddy's Lambo. Scrambled eggs, I got scrambled ammo. Leave you on top of the water like a banana boat. Yeah, I'm an animal, everybody's edible. The Yelawolf is headed for your arm and your hand. And your head, I'm a cannibal. Good heavens the man's hoppin' over the fence. Like a fucking antelope. So send him to me in a minute. When you're finished and I'll put it in a vice grip. Put an end to the image. And I'll send it to them via independent fucking with the mic grill. I might split then pull the trigger back in a submarine with sub machine. Loaded in a ocean hot deep, deep enough to leave the submarine imploded. Promenade motherfucker, vamanos,. It's me, and I'm sick of the prognosis. Got more bars than Barney Fife. And I'll put you behind them like howdy Opie. I can make your mamma really proud to know me. And your broke daddy is down to loan me. Give me fifty bucks in penny rolls just to be. In one of my videos. Yeah homie, let's go. [Hook: Lil Jon] x3. Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go"

Right shoulder wearin all white sayin ""Joe chill"". Left shoulder wearin red sayin ""Pay yo' bills"". So that raw metaphor that I, thought of before. I don't remember no more. Cause I just ran out the door to meet a fiend by the store. And I heard, ""So you off tour?"" And I turned, and seen this whore. that I used to fiend for that ain't never let me score. lookin at me like I'm somethin she ain't never ever saw. So a one-hour run somehow turned into 24.

I am a addict's son, plus I'm a addict, son. I am a AK addict, uh, Travis drums. I am the lead dump factor, that's why I got a edge on rappers. I am redrum backwards.

Lookin for a way to get high, I'm still alive. Six million ways to die, still a few more left to try. {?} is Red Bull, pills is hittin, still a slight medic'. We just goin back and forth, feelin like tennis. Standin underneath rain, wanna be sane, friends and family wantin me to change. But it's too late cause my feet is gettin comfy on the flames. Check it! I don't wanna be another nigga with no gold (nah). No fame, success nigga no hope (nah). Sleep on the corner in SoHo, like up is down, there's no dough. Uhh, fuck it, they ain't put me under yet. And think what you wish, I ain't got one regret. [Chorus]. [Crooked I]. My automobile is not a Bentley, he knows that my pocket's empty. The devil's so consequently, he gotta tempt me. Standin on the block you should not offend me. I rock a semi, like Prada Fendi. I don't think the spirit of God is in me. Just wicked whispers of scriptures Satan is narratin. I heard you got a safe in your crib so I'm there waitin. Nobody's safe in your crib, while I'm on that staircase, I'm bare-faced. Possessed by what you possess, I'm hell raising. And I just left somebody's father a quadraplegic. Told him not to move or get shot to Egypt, he did not believe it. He's losin blood and I'm cold-blooded like I'm anemic. I need a doctor, I'm psychotic, maybe I should watch ""The Secret"". Or see a priest and I might just chill. Or will I blow him out of the confession booth, like on ""Righteous Kill"". Kill kill kill - God when I write this will. I hope I seek some forgiveness cause {my life was real}. [Outro]. Devil's got a hold of me. D-d-devil's got a hold of me. Devil's got a hold of me.... Devil's got a hold of me. D-d-d-d-devil's got a hold of me. Devil's got a hold of me..."

Lookin for a way to get high, I'm still alive. Six million ways to die, still a few more left to try. {?} is Red Bull, pills is hittin, still a slight medic'. We just goin back and forth, feelin like tennis. Standin underneath rain, wanna be sane, friends and family wantin me to change. But it's too late cause my feet is gettin comfy on the flames. Check it! I don't wanna be another nigga with no gold (nah). No fame, success nigga no hope (nah). Sleep on the corner in SoHo, like up is down, there's no dough. Uhh, fuck it, they ain't put me under yet. And think what you wish, I ain't got one regret. [Chorus]. [Crooked I]. My automobile is not a Bentley, he knows that my pocket's empty. The devil's so consequently, he gotta tempt me. Standin on the block you should not offend me. I rock a semi, like Prada Fendi. I don't think the spirit of God is in me. Just wicked whispers of scriptures Satan is narratin. I heard you got a safe in your crib so I'm there waitin. Nobody's safe in your crib, while I'm on that staircase, I'm bare-faced. Possessed by what you possess, I'm hell raising. And I just left somebody's father a quadraplegic. Told him not to move or get shot to Egypt, he did not believe it. He's losin blood and I'm cold-blooded like I'm anemic. I need a doctor, I'm psychotic, maybe I should watch ""The Secret"". Or see a priest and I might just chill. Or will I blow him out of the confession booth, like on ""Righteous Kill"". Kill kill kill - God when I write this will. I hope I seek some forgiveness cause {my life was real}. [Outro]. Devil's got a hold of me. D-d-devil's got a hold of me. Devil's got a hold of me.... Devil's got a hold of me. D-d-d-d-devil's got a hold of me. Devil's got a hold of me..."
"don't fuck with me (feat. paul wall, jay rock & kurupt)",[Jay Rock]. Shit shit. I'm just a skinny ass nigga. With word on my shoulders. Hard night as a motherfucker. My daddy was a solider. I'm holy never. Straight forward. Leap with it. Split. Haters all in my vision. I'm trying to start my living. Shots what I'm given. I don't miss when I kill em. Lord won't show me some mercy. Its just business. Gotta get it. In my city better watch it. Devil. Always busy. Stetchin' my mind shit. Smoking toll I'm busy. When I'm speaking my mind. Trying to stay out of prison.

[Paul Wall]. Ain no motherfucker gonna hold my grind. Put the line. Ain't got time. I gotta keep it. While I'm still in my prime. My future looking clearer. Darth vader. Escaping like ya mean. No feel. No deal. Post it up on the top tier. Too many powder breaks. Shaking in the case dear. Skid row. Right back at the spot. Till they drop me in the grave. I can't stop. One way or another. I will be on top. In jail. Knock on wood. I gotta get it outta here. Don't fuck with me. [Chorus]. Trying to get mine when you see me at the crime. Don't fuck with me. If you see me getting high.

And quickly so nigga. Don't fuck with me. [Chorus]. Trying to get mine when you see me at the crime. Don't fuck with me. If you see me getting high. Trying to keep my piece of mind. Don't fuck with me. You don't like what I'm saying. You don't like my appearance. Don't fuck with me. The doctor told my mama that I'm 50-150. Don't fuck with me. Don't fuck with me.

funky shit,"Sitting in the Annotateback (Oh my god). S-Sitting the back (f-f-f-funky shit). [Verse 1]. Peanut butter jelly box, sitting in the carport. 808 crack, and I'm open like a barndoor. Beer bottle cap, put 'em in the floor. Set 'em in the floor, what a metaphor is this?. Kind of like I do a beat with Travis. Eat it up, beat it up, work at the atlas. Where should I go? Put 'em in a cereal bowl. In Alabama, then I holler out ""Cheerio"". Look at that shit, pull the gun back like elastic. And let it go like a mac clip. S-Sipping on the green bottle, like I'm saint Patrick. Got beans in the mattress, magic. Make you want to jump on a fat bitch. Ooo got to have it. (boss) Yelawolf, pick a thing. On a pekingese bitch, go go gadget. (Owh) I'm all the way from the gutter. Flick a cigarette butt from a Chevrolet pickup. Geeked up on 7 Up. Gotta turn the beat up while I run up on it like a cheetah. Wanna ride a beat, right above, that?ll be the day.. Put you up shit creek, paddle it away. Hat to the side. Holler at you homie. What's the matter with you babe?. [Hook:]. Sitting in the back with the bass on boom. Trunk gon shake, and the wheels on zoom. American classic, trashy tunes. L.A. to Alabama, from noon to noon. They saying, (oh my god, that's some funky shit). (Oh my god, that's some funky shit). (Oh my god, that's some funky shit). Oh my god, that's some funky shit. [Verse 2:]. And I'm a Beastie Boy. Airwalks and a bowl cut. Skater when a skater wasn't cool. When it was just, ""so what? Fuck you dude"". Well fuck you too. ? with a backpack. I'll bust your fruit. I'm all about constructing my paper. Kind of like a pocket full of Elmer's Glue. Squeeze the bottle, turn the milk. Churn the butter, get the cheese tomorrow. I got a lock on my profit. No exits, no keys tomorrow. But I got steeze to borrow. Some Famous kicks to match. If I got a bass line, I'll rap. As long as TB got sticks to crack. So hit a drumroll, I'll jump in like a jump rope. Watch. Acapella like an elevator,. operate the fader while I operate a label. then I?m in my fuckin' high tops. Rhythm like a clock, hop scotch. You would've thought, it was written. But it's not. Rag hanging out the back of them jeans. Not a gangbanger but a cracker who sings. And momma don't you worry about a single thing. Really though, cause daddy brought charcoal, and gasoline. And we cooking up tonight, t-bones, pinto beans. [Hook]. Sitting in the back with the bass on boom. Trunk gon shake, and the wheels on zoom. American classic, trashy tunes. L.A. to Alabama, from noon to noon. They saying, (oh my god, that's some funky shit). (Oh my god, that's some funky shit). (Oh my god, that's some funky shit). Oh my god, that's some funky shit. [Verse 3:]. Yeah, why stop now?. Put 'em in the trunk. Let 'em feel the sound. That they don't pop it. Let 'em feel the rhyme till he finds the locket. 808 weighs a ton, so drop it. Watch your feet, while I rock the beat. Going all out, no privacy. I don't walk if I can ride the beat. But wouldn't you though? Don't lie to me. Of course you would, catapult syllables. Got up on my horse in the woods, whoa. Magical, sorcerer goods. Steal from the rich put more in the hood. Natural, born with a wood. Fuck 'em all, I'm right above 'em all. But you could butt talk, if a ? fall. Outrun with a motherfucker with a sluggish crawl. Chug till I can't chug at all. Not a frat boy, I'm a rap boy. In Hollywood, like Aykroyd. But I read my script with a southern drawl. I run home when mother calls. Cause mother's got a switch. Yeah, she's a wolf too. That makes me a son of a bitch. [Hook]. Sitting in the back with the bass on boom. Trunk gon shake, and the wheels on zoom. American classic, trashy tunes. L.A. to Alabama, from noon to noon.

Living in this ghetto with no question. High blood pressure,.. high gas prices searching for a high... Some people turn to the church and search all hope. Looking for that ribbon in the sky.
