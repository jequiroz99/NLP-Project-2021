drink n fight (feat. selva),"So we go round. And round. We set fire to the winter. and we party with the sinners. And the sound so loud. I can feel you right beside me. When my speakers make right by me. And I don't know, if you will go away. And I don't know, if you will go away. We drink, we fight. we party up all night. We fuck. we love and everything's alright. We drink, we fight. we party up all night. We fuck. we love and everything's alright. We drink, we fight. We drink, we fight. We drink, we fight. We drink, we fight. We drink, we drink, we drink. We drink, we drink, we drink. We drink, we drink, we drink. We drink, we fight. We drink, drink, we fight"
