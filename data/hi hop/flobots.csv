panacea for the poison,In my mind I hold the passion panacea for the poison. My bruised and battered body washes up upon the shore sin. Flees from leaking wounds like rate from sinking ships. As I float off to forever with these words upon my lips. No I never asked for nothing and that’s just what I got. As my pride dies before I do as I fall I’m also caught. I wasted many days chasing brightly gleaming streams. As I fold into your presence do I now know what it means. We could get old and talk at the same time when we tell stories. If we let go impossible names rhyme in elegant poetry. But I dabble in everything. It inundates my small town. I refuse the offers extended waiting for God now. I never asked for nothing audible. So when the walls fall down and spin like waterwheels. I’ll pray for something logical. So when we all drown. I can cover bald spots with yarmulkes. Drawn from extradimensional sources like in comic books. Chose your own adventure. I’m obsessing like a drug fiend. Fantasies of actors clandestinely having sex in love scenes. But why not amateurs openly sharing love in sex scenes?. Stand clear while I soak in this treasure trove of a wet dream. I can’t tell what my problem is or even if there is one. Sail the celibacies much sooner than commitment. Escaping minor shake-ups but keep bracing for the big one. To make the choices obvious and save us from decisions. I juggled whimsy in a fire fight. With the inner light of fire flies. Watched dusk go indigo. And blush into a silent night. Birthed an immaculate concept. From a pregnant pause. In the august of my righteousness. Just waiting for the fall. The greater and the small. All for one and one for all. For all those s.o.s’ing we will rise to the call. I’ve bitten the hand that feeds and found myself bleeding. Hereby I’ll only need what I need. But need’ll get me out of my groove. So I move to different tunes. Sunning in warm weather by the light of blistered moons. Thirst statement inundation. Bring the monsoon. Seasoned with the spectacle of people finding tools. Appetite has grown fools. Empire has sown rules. Let’s throw out craving and things with no use. People dropping jewels. Gems cant shine like our light. To air is human. So the sky is our birthright. ------------------. Por Filipe de Menezes =)

anne braden,"From the color of the faces in sunday's songs. To the hatred they raised all the youngsters on. Once upon a time in this country long ago. She knew there was something wrong. Because the song said yellow, red, black, and white. Everyone precious in the path of christ. But what about the daughter of the woman cleaning their house. Wasnt she a child they were singing about. And if jesus loves us black or white skin. Why didn't her white mother invite them in?. When did it become a room for no blacks to step in?. How did she already know not to ask the question. Left lasting impressions. Adolescence's comforts gone. She never thought things would ever change. But she always knew there was something wrong. She always knew there was something wrong. Years later she found herself mississippi-bound. To help stop the legalized lynching. Of mr. willie mcgee. But they couldnt stop it. So they thought that theyd talk to the governor. About what happened. And say were tired of being used. As an excuse to kill black men. But the cops wouldnt let em past and. These women they struck em as uppity. So they hauled em all off to jail. And they called it protective custody. Then from her cell she heard her jailers. Grumbling about outsiders. And when she called him out. And said she was from the south they shouted. Why is a nice southern lady. Making trouble for the governor?. She said, i guess im not your type of lady. And i guess im not your type of southerner.. But before you call me traitor. Well its plainest just to say. I was a child in mississippi. But im ashamed of it today. . Imagine the world that youre standing within. All of your neighbors and family and friends. How would you cope. Facing the fact. The flesh on your hand. Was tainted with sin. She faced it every day. People she saw on a regular basis. People she loved in several cases. People she knew were incredibly racist. It was painful. But she never stopped loving them. Never stopped calling their name. And she never stopped being a southern woman. And she never stopped calling for change. And she saw that her struggle. Was in the tradition. Of ancestors never aware of her. It continues today. The soul of a southerner. Born of the other america"
by the time you get this message,By the time you get this message. I will be behind the wheel. Watching dotted yellow hexagrams stretch into the dark. Left hand surfing on iced tinged winds. Chewing up a cardboard box. Singing at lung top. One stop left ’til I meet you in the concourse. St. Louie encore. Do we have a shot?. Caught. No dwelling on the thought. Of what the hell we haven’t got. So I’m headed from the dot to the spot. Where your plane touches down. For a six hour layover. Don’t say a word. I found it on the map. Calculated it. Just a half a day to get from where you’re not to where you will be. My hair is filthy. I’m drinking coffee. I can barely feel the trace. From the only time you kissed me on the face. Question mark space. I know you’re with me underneath the starscape. Treadmill pick up our pace. Headstart on a jet in a car chase. Is this the part where my heart breaks. One asleep one awake. Back to back ‘cause you wouldn’t turn towards me. Had me battling fractals keeping track of all the chords we created. Sound clash of swords. Back and forth. Couldn’t poke through the sash. Slash through the plasterboard. You packing your passport. Me on a crash course to show you that I have the passion that you asked for. Flooring the gas trying a fast forward fifteen months. I’ll see you once the sun shines through the glass above the dashboard. The stars I see aren’t even there. It’s only light in the air. By the time you get this message I’ll be either on my second flight. Or already all the way to my destination. Ridiculous that I could honestly expect you waiting at the gate when I arrive. A sixteen hour drive. I’ve been feeling so silly going on now several months. As our obsession runs together. And whoever comes to have you I’ll be jealous of. And when above all else you put her I’ll know what it was to feel so needed. Sorta wish that I was more of a romantic and could give you back the utmost. But I’ve never seen it up close. From everything that I can tell there are several possibilities. Maybe we‘re in love really. Maybe it’s too early to really see. Maybe we’re just searching for something to hold onto amidst confusion and fragility. Maybe we’ve lost all sensibility. Will it be come our Splendor in the Grass. When the facts have asserted themselves. And the memories pass into poetry and words that retell. What only then can we be sure that we felt. Guess I prefer to be unhappy. Or weren’t you looking at me when my back became a wall. Searched for your reflection saw exactly what you saw. Two kinds of different skin. Two minds exist within. Trying to just transcend all space and time. And lift their chin and find some sense of purpose. Some sense of hope. Press my cheek against the window surface. We’ve been afloat. But now I’m nervous. Has this been a joke?. We’re landing and it’s time to close the envelope. Maybe I’ll see you at the finish line
combat,I know how to rip a mike different. I grip it like so. Tight like a kryptonite with a bike pole. Sparks from my lips ignite liquid nitro. No telling if it might blow. The environments' gotta be hotter. Than solder beside the iron. Zinc vitamins. Hide'em inside when i'm writing the rhymes. It's hard to keep property guarded. Because of these pirates. I motivate. No debate. We're takin it over. Make no mistake. Youre fake and there's no escape. Cuz you got caught. Frozen waitin for the crosswalk. I can take it to another level. Where the base is above the treble. And your face is in double. Evasiveness doesnt settle it. A place and a space. Where theres nothing to meddle with. Combat to get you to bomb back. Blond black lets get beyond that. Sing songs that attack with strong raps. 321 contact. Sans paddle we swim the long laps. Swans flap to get the pond packed. Want sass kiss my moms ass. Wrong tact convict you en mass. Take it back like linda ronstadt. Or luke sky with a twisted long hat. Ton ton fat subsisting on that. Tom tom hi hat. Insist upon that. Listen to jon rap. This is combat. To get you to bomb back. Two fisted contact to. Get the pond packed. Cause im on some shit that exist beyond that
cracks in the surface,"The water level’s rising. The water level’s rising. Everyone alive sing. Who will turn the tide. Bring about land grabs. Sand bags bring’em out. It’s hard to yell with the Atlantic in your mouth. Cracks in the surface. Cracks in the surface…. Tck tck tck tck…. One becomes two becomes three becomes four. Our soundwaves run your city like parkour. Provokin’ encores but we know you want more. That’s what we’re doing this for. Four becomes three becomes two becomes one. The metamorphosis cannot be undone. We burst forth from the land toward the sun. And transform. The advance has begun. Like Mary J. I’m oBliged. To hollerate and prophesy. Nostradamus on the topics. Often dropped. On open mics. When both sides are vocalized. The crowd spits. The dopest lines. Efforts gain significance. Like overdrives. Of dopamine. Rappers act like they smell like roses. Suffer from chronic halitosis. Their hazardous sadistic recipes are out of focus like a cloud of locusts. Plus their rhymin style is atrocious. We’re supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. With a hand motion. We stand revolting. We’re calling out all Emperors in no clothing. Intelligence quotient. Amassed to challenged oceans. Outlast the isms, ists, ologies and slogans. These narcissists forget to do their exercise. Confused by what success implies. Name drop successive tries. In drive thrus to get extra fries. Emancipating free speech when I run my mouth. Terminal cancer patients say “Hey when’s the C.D. coming out?”. Break it down to the essence of raw. One two check the mic, Stephen’s like, every guy. Walk tall in the hallways. And make note of which ones step aside. Left and right, guess my pride. Of lying is probable pesticide. Infected by the viruses that bedbugs are infested by. Rhyming enigma I keep ‘em guessing. My rhymes are like ribbons when. I wrap the present. Recapture lessons. The ancestors prefaced. In deference to how we. Break it down to the essence. ‘Cause there’re cracks in the surface. Nobody wants to see ‘em. Strategic wargames don’t call ‘em human beings. They call ‘em like they want ‘em for a prop in their battlerap. But Solomon and Math will dap after. Play the track backwards ’cause there’s too much death energy. Let it be a muse sing to your best enemy. Never let it be your task master. Let’s finish things alive with oppression and disaster diminishing"
defend atlantis,"That was as far as the tide came in. I remember the starfish and the wails of the sirens then. We replaced the tridents, embraced Poseidon. And discovered ourselves living on an island. We flow like water across the lost city. Chalk prophecies and washed off graffiti. In continents. Trade off for payoff. And high concepts then lost to K-Os. Many tales radiate from one nexus. Defending a dream of a new directive. A call from the deep sums up a notion. The day when the people bum rushed the ocean. From the beaches they ran to meet the day after. Underneath the waves won’t repeat the same chapter. Knew what they had to do. That which creates life has power to take it right back. Fucking with the icecaps. We’ve gotta push the tide back. We can survive collapse if we don’t get sidetracked. If we visualize living underwater hidden by prisms. Countries fall but people transition if one for all we live in that vision. Hundred dollar bill origami. Balloon inflation new world economy. We float on tsunami to global warming. We need structures to control what’s coming. Corporate monopolies obsolete. The philosophy leaves us lost at sea. But from Marwar to Cochabamba. We are the warriors that won’t get conquered. ‘Cause rising tides drown all villages. Divided fighters succumb to pillage. Rescuers whatever your latitude. It’s time to pioneer a new world attitude. Put local cycles first we’re Global Islanders with nothing left to plunder. (Alert the law alternate nations train in the streets. Act to limit all non-transparent industries so. We must defend Atlantis. Anchor the land and never transform into seas. Assets to liquify all netted toxic indices so. We must defend Atlantis). For centuries human beings have pursued the meaning of Atlantis. Central to their teaching is that it’s existence answers man’s essential questions. Much like the feeding of the 5,000. Even if the facts aren’t accurate the story’s magic is alive. Of utmost importance to convert the impertinent. Atlantis holds the answer to man‘s ills at their most pertinent. Aspersions easily dispersed when I certainly answer. The most diverse aversions when I firstly channel _. Is this all that you hold. For a warriors role. The ground shakes. You claim my country not my soul. I fought I toiled, for the lost in the waves I will not tire. I die no slave. If the seas my grave. I sleep with my city. My people my oath. My shame my city is that. I cannot save my city. From waves that claim you. And curse the gods who can’t explain. Who to blame. At the end of the reign. Heed me. The season passes Atlas. His keeps in the sediment. Failing monumentally. And leaving no monuments to see. Only sea to shining sea. (Assess the loss as new tidal inundations surface. Amidst the legions are now thousands in starfish. We must defend Atlantis. As the land acquiesces no tears in sympathy. Address the legacy and never treat it separately. Access telepathy last as neverending transcendency…). And survival hinged on an attempt by the humble. And the sirens wailed as the empire crumbled…. With nothing left to plunder corporations drowned. Waves clapped like thunder and stormed the gates with sound. Forming a new nation now. As the icecaps melted water levels rose. We raised our hands together and made the levees hold. Heals in the sand we revealed the depths below. The population of starfish exploded from the ocean. Survival we unified to focus on. And the voices were many but we spoke as one. As the tale was retold we multiplied. And swelled across the faultlines to halt the tide. We let the altars die to keep our pulse alive. And from the barren wastelands of naked trash. We stitched together a shelter from fallen nation’s flags. And chose to build a future from an ancient past. The crowns of thorns was worn we put the tritons down. We found new forms of anchors deep inside the ground. The world is an island now"
fight with tools,"Echo echo one-nine. Hear the call through fault lines. Smoke signals old rhymes. Shorted lights in store signs. Spelled in a broken code. Find that it is time to. Breath build bend and refine you. We sky tenants. Give it all but wont give up. Radio soul antennas. Radio to lift spirits. Call sign commando. M.o. is independence. Scream till the walls fall,. Dissolve all the limits. Occupied minds. Unemployed skills. Desolation. Worn out. Torn down. Just for now thrill seekers. Slanging. Test tube babies in beakers. Where gun blasts pump straight from the speakers. The system where the. Poor get poorly paid. To hold the ladder. Where the rich get ricocheted. Into the stratosphere. And in between people are rushin' like vladimir. With metals to make their status clear. Get us out of here. We need heroes. Build them. Don't put your fist up. Fill them. With our hopes and our hearts and our hands. We're the architects of our last stand. There's a war going on for your mind. Those who seek to occupy it will stop at nothing. The battlefield is everywhere. There is no sanctuary. There are no civilians. You have two choices. Surrender or enlist. What kind of person are you. Always the first to argue. Or never down to stick your neck out. Cause it hurts you far too much. To see your rep suffer. Set you up a buffer. Well neither is enough for us cut from a tougher brand of duct tape. The propaganda's stuck on us like sock pajamas. Spread like a virus. Through accepted thoughts and proper manners. But off the cameras. Something's simmering across the land. About to bubble up. And knock the lids off of the pots and pans. We are non stop juggernauts. Stomp ziggurats. Spit manifestos. By terabytes and gigawatts. Shock paradigms. Give sense to a score. Throw thoughts through the sky. Activate twenty more. In these high and dry times. Expectorate on dogma. Pragmatic sycophants. Divide and conquer. We build bridges offer. Hard work and prosper. As hand made heroes brought to you by no sponsors. All free minds to the front. All free minds to the front. We call upon women. We call upon children. We call upon the handicapped. The infirmed. The week of heart. We need your courage. Your dedication. Your passion. Your commitment. Gather up your platinum. Melt it down. Gather up your gold. Melt it down. Gather up your bronze. Your silver. Your aluminum. Melt it down. Melt it down. Melt it down"
good soldier,"[Chorus]. Today, You don't have to be a soldier. Don't have to be a soldier, stand down. It's okay to be as you were. Be as you were again.. Is it a scheme? Is it a Vision?. Is it a dream? Is it a nightmare?. Or is it a competition?. And if it is, what if we don't fight fair?. What's bald in the morning but in the evening has white hairs?. What's the cause of global warming and could it be these things right here?. I've got an idea that might not reach anyone for another light year. Got a hit list and a cloud of witnesses which is pricier. My tears are mightier than my fears. So mighty Earth provides me hurt that I keep buried until I convert it to writing. I was wounded. I was injured. I was made to move to Denver. I was taken through a new adventure. Paint stripped from it's first fixture. I was placed in another picture. I was rushed to a new landscape. And ripped away from family scraped into a politicians mistake. And what's left of talents in chests beneath oceans. Welled up behind eyelids has yet to be salvaged. A world of emotions. A guess that it might be okay. That it could be all right if expressed today. [Chorus]. Am I a woman raised man-machine. Damaging everything I touch by not caring enough. Or too much. Am I far flung fantasy. Setting free enmity. And making friends from enemies. And bridges for the in-between's. For the highwayman on a low road. The tired back with a large load. The trials spanned till I found hope. And I found more. When I slo mo'ed. Enough of the back to face front. Let those in the pack of the race run. I'm needing an evener pace one too hasty. Makes mistakes. Can you carry a song. As strong as your arms can bear. That you keep from harm. And it will be there. When you go wrong. Make a heart from your bond. Your treasure is right here. And what's left of talents in chests beneath oceans. Welled up behind eyelids has yet to be salvaged. A world of emotions. A guess that it might be okay. That it could be all right if expressed today. [Chorus] x2"

happy together,"Imagine me and you.

I look at your number and wonder if I should. call you up. or invest a dime in a message with text that doesn't. belong to me but it would. ease my mind to know if the songs I'm singin are. in a key. you can comprehend. in tune with the thoughts you're pondering. if so we can both stop wondering if and. be together like Donner and Blitzen. but all reindeer games aside. it's like right when you came here, I came alive. it's like everything else was a glipse of you. giving hints and clues of where your name resides. now that I've found you it's changed the vibe. shattered through all the blame fear pain and pride. doesn't matter who calls and inversts a dime. they get a message saying we're staying inside. cause I imagine, you and me could make music easily. could make moves never lose the beat. I can imagine the food that we chose to eat. I see it all like a view from a movie seat. and imagine you and me. never knew that we. were never more than a few degrees. and how good it would prove to be. but the waiting is over I finally found you and.... .

Love's loss under Love's duress. a curse confessing hope. and then reverse the blessing emptiness. this hollow whole wont coalesce. regrets emote from hole in chest. as less remote emotions pull from. gravities growing depths. I have it easy knowing this. together we will never fit. So I'd rather bind my mind with rhymes. than blind my eyes and sever it. . hooks.

if i,If I hadn’t been a quiet introspective kid. If I hadn’t been a nerd wouldn’t have met with him. If we hadn’t observed we be the best of friends. That preferred the spoken word to the toke and binge. If momma hadn’t died when I was young. Would me and sis have been so tight from jump. If dad had not lost his mind to a disease. Would I be up here askin ya’ll to notice me. In the dark times didn’t know where the path went. I was close to the edge like Grand Master Flash said. It was the hands of my friends who held me back. Yes. Without them I’d MJ keep slide’n backwards. Or be a hypocrite like some others have been. If that and the other hadn’t happened. I don’t know that I’d be Brer Rabbit. Askin how many ifs between hero and has-been?. If I had only known that I would be a lamb to the slaughter. now I know. If I hadn’t grown up in the 80’s. Experiencing the various things that made me. Would I still be standing center stage. Trying to innovate new ways to demonstrate. If mommy daddy hadn’t turned off Mork and Mindy. To inform us divorce was pending. Would him and me have spent these 23 years in a frenzy. Moving back and forth with such forceful energy. I remember when I was a little baby. Lying there alone on my pillow casing. Upset already I could feel the aging. The urge to return was debilitating. And maybe I’m still afraid and need to. Cry a little harder for the world of play things. Stop looking back on these silly day dreams. Sing along with me if you feel the same way. If I had known what awaited was unplanned. If I had known the blade was in a loved one’s hand. If I had known of the possible injury. If I had known the altar was meant for me. Now I know nobody can predict events. Now I know there’s cracks in the picket fence. Now I know that something else can exist. Now I know a life can be built from this. If I had known emotions would still remain. If I had known that time wouldn’t heal the pain. If I had known the intent of the injury. If I had known the altar wasn’t meant for me. Now I know there’s treasure hidden in these scars. Now I know there’s presence in an empty yard. Now I know what it took for me to survive. Now I know where to go to become alive
infatuation,You played the field like a tractor. Scoped for greener pastures. But you never have scored. What you've never asked for. Met someone who made me glow. Passion was like crazy whoah. Doted on another though. So of course I let her go. Oh no my adrenal recipe's. Overloaded by phenylethlamine. If it keeps on misdirecting me. Fuck it that's gonna mean vasectomy. And when the liquor pours it's. Set the table get the door. Wrestle naked hit the floor. But I don't seek that shit no more. It's different for me. Try to tell myself a different story. This alphamale recount-the-tale bullshit can just destroy me. ‘Cause what we say is what we seek. What we seek is what we get. What we get is what we give. I can't give you nothing yet. Except. Infatuation. Take these words and turn them into lies. Serve me up with food that does not feed. Satiate my every last desire. Is this the thing I want or the thing I need. He collects clips from magazines. Found them full of hollow points. Mixes Medea with the media. They both consume the young. The same old song gets sung. He wants to hang. So he gets hung. He's chasing father figures. A real son of a gun. I don't cotton to the coffin nails. Caught up quiet don't make bail. Umpteen years for move'n keys. Ironic he's locked up in jail. Outside he is idolized. My sister's class and ask the boys. They wanna just be like him and move more rocks than belts of asteroids. Better strapped and paranoid. Than in the streets without a choice. Peace of mind has been destroyed. But now he's got a louder voice. Idols lie to idle minds. Sayin' I don't mind if I got mine. If all our lies are idealized. Then all our crimes are idolized. It's. If this isn't love why does my heart hurt so bad?. You don't know why. You wanna be the man. You wanna be demanded. By other people's hands so high. You're caught up in its leaves. Make the audience freeze at the thought. But you don't know why. You wanna beat a man. You wanna be demanded. By other people hands so high. You're caught up its sleeves. Make the audience freeze. Like a body in the trees. Now everybody in the club stand still. Like a rubber band filled. With government bills

never had it,I see you sit. And swallow pain. For all of those. Who will not speak. You raise your voice. You fill the stage. Your eyes are wide. You know the weakness. That you've felt. Is not just yours. So many more. You're not alone. The song you sing is not your own. You fill the room with something real. Youve never had it so you hesitate to try and find it. You listen carefully for whispers of what lurks behind it. You play the corners. Never get too close to where it might be. Waiting for you. Never had it. Keep on wanting something more. . Keep hiding the hope and than the pain is not yours. No ones holding a rope gotta pull up on your own.. All the songs have been sung. And all the doors have be closed. Keep on wanting more.. I watch you wander through these halls. You slouch you shrug you shrink away. I call you stop you blink you pause. You wander who. You think the day. Will never end. But when it does. You stay until the building's dark. You're on the bus. The doors are locked. You looked inside. But did not touch. Youve never had it. But you know how to provide it so you. Stand up and call for it. Nervous describing what you go through. You dont wanna get caught up in all the. Things they say to try to provoke you. Dont need anyone to tell you. Keep on wanting something more

one love,"I just wanna say. welcome to the part of the show. where the base drum hits hard and slow. your face becomes aware that Im starting to flow. and it sounds like a song that you already know. you might have heard it at 11th and Fillmore. A sort biggish building with a littlish a billboard but. Whats everybody staying still 4,. 3,2,1 If youre happy, Gillmore. then act like youre knowing it clap. And move like youre in a kayak and youre rowing it. And if you dont wanna clap then snap. Whatever floats your boat just go with it. Cause Im hoping thisll get you open. Its a bit of spoken word a little joking heard hear and there. Lemme clear the air. This is not a competitionLord, hear my prayer. So if anybody listening is feeling scared. We wanna make your spirit aware that. You are not alone. You are not alone. Chorus:. You are (you are) not alone. You dont have to do this on your own. One Love Agape One Love Agape. Solo(w) it can feel like were coming apart. Together were much more than the sum of our parts. One Love Agape One love Agape. . Some of out parts are just about busting. Some of our parts are rusty but these. Lips voice sentiments begun in our hearts and. Heal wounds with the songs that are sung in the dark. So if youre feeling like a Pimp take a moment just to hold it off. My role model will not only brush ya shoulders off. But wash your feet, give his life as the soldiers watch. And forgive his torturers below the cross. So when youre slapped and youre told to fight back. And they taunt you over the phone to incite smack. Get back! Get back in the zone despite that. And rely on the strength that the bonified have. But if you act like you know me like that. Call me cheesy like macaroni I might snap snap. But only like that and get on the microphone and recite raps. CHORUS. You are not alone. You dont have to do this on your own. You wont have to prove yourself to get through this. Dont have to lose yourself to this music. In fact you might find yourself. In a room full of strangers trying to help. In a flashback to the last time you felt. The presence of something divine well, this is. Hip-hop its not just for profit anymore never was. Its too easy to live your life waiting for change to arrive if it ever does. It will come from a source thats infinite, not from a middle man. You cant measure its force but youve got a sense of it, and its bigger than. Hip-hopits larger than life/death.much greater than us/them... Everybody One love/agapeCHORUS"
panacea for the poison,In my mind I hold the passion panacea for the poison. My bruised and battered body washes up upon the shore sin. Flees from leaking wounds like rate from sinking ships. As I float off to forever with these words upon my lips. No I never asked for nothing and that’s just what I got. As my pride dies before I do as I fall I’m also caught. I wasted many days chasing brightly gleaming streams. As I fold into your presence do I now know what it means. We could get old and talk at the same time when we tell stories. If we let go impossible names rhyme in elegant poetry. But I dabble in everything. It inundates my small town. I refuse the offers extended waiting for God now. I never asked for nothing audible. So when the walls fall down and spin like waterwheels. I’ll pray for something logical. So when we all drown. I can cover bald spots with yarmulkes. Drawn from extradimensional sources like in comic books. Chose your own adventure. I’m obsessing like a drug fiend. Fantasies of actors clandestinely having sex in love scenes. But why not amateurs openly sharing love in sex scenes?. Stand clear while I soak in this treasure trove of a wet dream. I can’t tell what my problem is or even if there is one. Sail the celibacies much sooner than commitment. Escaping minor shake-ups but keep bracing for the big one. To make the choices obvious and save us from decisions. I juggled whimsy in a fire fight. With the inner light of fire flies. Watched dusk go indigo. And blush into a silent night. Birthed an immaculate concept. From a pregnant pause. In the august of my righteousness. Just waiting for the fall. The greater and the small. All for one and one for all. For all those s.o.s’ing we will rise to the call. I’ve bitten the hand that feeds and found myself bleeding. Hereby I’ll only need what I need. But need’ll get me out of my groove. So I move to different tunes. Sunning in warm weather by the light of blistered moons. Thirst statement inundation. Bring the monsoon. Seasoned with the spectacle of people finding tools. Appetite has grown fools. Empire has sown rules. Let’s throw out craving and things with no use. People dropping jewels. Gems cant shine like our light. To air is human. So the sky is our birthright. ------------------. Por Filipe de Menezes =)
rise,So much pain we. Dont know how to be but angry. Feel infected like weve got gangrene. Please dont let anybody try to change me. Me. Just me. In the middle of a sea full of faces. Full of faces. Some laugh some salivate. Whats in your alleyway. Recycling bins or bullet cases. Its not equal. Its not fair. Were different people. But were not scared. We aint never scared. To pave a new path. Make a new street. Build a new bridge. Say can you see by the dawns early light. Free slaves running. Songs words werent right. Now a new days coming. The few stay stunning while the many are handsome. Your soul is alive but they want it for ransom. The base drumming is the anthem. We step to the heartbeats of our granddaughters and grandsons. And. Rise together we. Lost hope and found need. Grounded by our surroundings. Did the walls scream universities. Or you and i verse the tees. React automatic and we burst when squeezed. And make 9-11 each emergency. Urgency amber to red like the turning leaves. Oh please let the hurting cease. Don't let apathy police the populace. We will march across. Those stereotypes that were marked for us. The answers obvious. We switch the consonants. Change the sword to words and lift continents. If you believe in redemption. I'm calling to you from another dimension

something grown together,Chorus:. Something grown together. An agreement. Whether or no the weather is hot or freezing. Until the day of bereavement. Something known forever. A convergence. Of lifelines and lifetimes full of wonderings and longings and searchings. Commitment and devotion. An adventure. A kiss to span the oceans when in sickness when healthy tired or injured. Energy and passion. An investment. Entering onto a path intertwined laughing crying and learning lifelong lessons. Verse :. Something grown together. Something grown together. Something grown together. Like branches of a banyan tree. Deeply rooted in family. Giving life to a canopy. Much more than a crush more than a brush with where happenstance is standing. Compatible hearts like raggedy anne and andy. Bump bump. Bump bump. But the beat changes up when he sees her. Takkity takkity taka taka taka taka. Takity takity-. Can't believe the rhythm is so in sync. And that isn't there only strength. They were humming a tune. The sun and the moon. They didn't know what to think. But they were pleased to see these two young souls become mates. To provide light for a song that was sung right in one take. Because there's no need to rehearse when you and your partner get in the zone. And you can't memorize words you've always known. Chorus
stand up,"Stand up. We shall not be moved. Except By a child with no socks and shoes. If you've got more to give then you've got to prove. Put your hands up and I'll copy you. Stand up We shall not be moved. Except by a woman dying from a loss of food. If you've got more to give then you've got to prove. Put your hands up and I'll copy you. We still don't understand thunder and lightning. Flash back to when we didn't fund the dam. Didn't fund the dam levee? No wonder man. Now our whole damn city's torn asunder man. Under water but we still don't understand. We see hurricane spills overrun the land. Through gaps you couldn't fill with a 100 tons of sand. No we still don't understand. We've seen planes in the windows of buildings crumbled in. We've seen flames send the chills through London. And we've sent planes to kill them and some of them were children. But still we crumbling the building. Underfunded but we still don't understand. Under God but we kill like the son of Sam. But if you feel like I feel like about the son of man. We will overcome. So Stand up. We shall not be moved. Except By a child with no socks and shoes. If you've got more to give then you've got to prove. Put your hands up and I'll copy you. Stand up We shall not be moved. Except by a woman dying from a loss of food. If you've got more to give then you've got to prove. Put your hands up and I'll copy you.

Except By a child with no socks and shoes. Except by a woman dying from a loss of food. Except by a freedom fighter bleeding on a cross for you. We shall not be moved. Except by a system thats rotten through. Neglecting the victims and ordering the cops to shoot. High treason now we need to prosecute. So Stand up. We shall not be moved. And we won't fight a war for fossil fuel. Its times like this that you want to plot a coup. Put your hands up and I'll copy you. So Stand up. We shall not be moved. Unless were taking a route we have not pursued. So if you've got a dream and a lot to do. Put your hands up and I'll copy you. I said Put your hands up and I'll copy you. Put your hands up and I'll copy you. if you've got a dream and a lot to do. Put your hands up. Now shake, shake. A Polaroid dream. nightmare negatives develop on the screen. We sit back and wait for the government team. Criticize they but who the fuck are we. The people want peace but the leaders want war. Our neighbors don't speak, peek through the front door. House representatives preach ""stay the course"". Time for a leap of faith. Once More. Put your hands up high if you haven't abandoned. Hope that the pen strokes stronger than the cannon. Balls to the wall, Nose to the grindstone. My interrogation techniques leave your mind blown. So Place your bets lets speak to the enemy. Don't let em pretend that we seek blood. And who's we anyways Kemo Sabe?. Mighty warlord wanna-be street thug. a threat for a threat leaves the whole world terrified. blow for blow never settles the score. word for word is time need clarify. We the people did not want war. So Stand up. We shall not be moved. Except By a child with no socks and shoes. If you've got more to give then you've got to prove. Put your hands up and I'll copy you. Unless were taking a route we have not pursued. So if you've got a dream and a lot to do. Put your hands up and I'll copy you. I said Put your hands up and I'll copy you. Put your hands up and I'll copy you. if you've got a dream and a lot to do. Put your hands up"
super hero,We believed in love when love wasn’t an option. She wanted to give birth. I wanted adoption. After days and days of conversation. We decided to go with fertilization. Then came baby showers and Lamaze classes. 2AM phonecalls 1 Minute contractions. But then they whisked me away like Brigadoon. No domestic partners in the delivery room. But if I was a superhero I would break free. Wouldn’t need anyone to come and save me. And you couldn’t make me feel like I’m crazy. I would see my baby. If I was a superhero I would break free. And I wouldn’t be imprisoned where ever you take me. I would change everyone who’s trying to change me. I would see my baby. Life in an occupied land is hard. We pushed harder. Soon to be a mom. Him to be a father. Boys with guns at the checkpoint in Rafah. Wouldn’t let me pass. When I said “I need a doctor!”. I don’t know the source of the passport errors. Or how four hours produced a miscarriage. But when it come to populations to disparage. Gaza is on the list right below gay marriage. There’s something on my heart. There’s someone on my mind. I never would have thought. That I could be so angry. But please give me the patience. Please give me the patience. ----------------. Por Filipe de Menezes =)
the circle in the square,"[Intro]. Hands in the air. Presidents, prime ministers. They said that we didn't care. But that isn't fair. Hands in the air. Presidents, prime ministers. They said that we didn't care. But we're the circle in the square. [Hook (x4) ]. Up, hands in the air. Presidents, prime ministers. They said that we didn't care. We're the circle in the square. [Verse 1: Jonny 5]. The time is now, our time has come. We show them how, what can't be done. No matter what they say or they don't say. We make a way out of no way. Against the gun, beneath the veil. Yes we can, too big to fail. We are the ones we're waiting for. We save ourselves; Praise the lord. [Brer Rabbit]. We are sly and the family. Stone in calamity. Triumph when thrown to the domes. Of these Goliaths. Planted seeds in silence. And granted meek compliance. And in the spring rain exploded in a riot. Of color and excitement. Wearing no disguises. Declaring to the stars that we trek like enterprises. Of candlelight revivals and how we lift the blindfolds. We end in Revelation, like it was the Bible. [Hook]. Up, hands in the air. Presidents, prime ministers. They said that we didn't care. We're the circle in the square. [Verse 2: Jonny 5]. We are the circle in the squee-are. We beathe air the same as the ones who didn't prepare. Don't be scared. Whatever time it was when you began. The clock is now 11: 55 on the big hand. So you're invited into the circle that we sleep in. Invited to depend on friendships we deepen. To uncover the secrets in the [breath] that we're bleepin. The treasures maps we pretend we do not believe in. Show us how to. Party at the protest, Rally like a rockstar. Yaya, yaya, allahu akbar. Do svidaniya Ego Foster all the people. El pueblo unido, jamas sera vencido. Party at the protest, Rally like a rockstar. Yaya, yaya, allahu akbar. Do svidaniya Ego Foster all the people. El pueblo unido, jamas sera vencido. [Brer Rabbit]. We are the night light bearers for night terrors. We are group dreamers, vision seekers and pall bearers. In aftermath of blight errors, blood type. and marrow to the bone oaths. And beat hope into plow shares. We're balancing the balance beam. Pulling strings from battle scene tapestries. And ravenous advocates for smaller teams. Pop the bubbles of crystal schemes. We are the sleep walkers for stalled dreams. [Hook]. Up, hands in the air. Presidents, prime ministers. They said that we didn't care. We're the circle in the square"
the effect,"It’s the F-L-O-B-O-T-S. What did you expect?. You wanted us to move you right to left. Live and direct…. Butterfly wing flap whole thing change. One look two different book same page. Front on the range but the beat’s contage. Stuck to your feet for 3, 4 days. It’s real too real like film projectors. Bend the letters. To find the nectar. It is effective. It will protect ya. From them spectres. Don’t let ‘em get ya. How’d they escape the rat race?. How’d he make that sound with that bass?. The roof is ablaze so break the glass case. Song so big affect the tax base. Don’t drink the potion. Split the ocean. Holy moses. Pharaoh’s forces. Let my people go with purpose. Turn the tide with forward motion. How does it feel to unglue?. Where do you think we’ve come to?. What does it take to follow through?. Who is it making you move?. Heavens to murgatroyd. The situations purgatory. Brer Rabbit’s stories. Burn categories. The allegory is Adam’s story. On the eve of something glorious. Us against them. Won’t bust the system. But trust the pistons. The engines misspent. Our thrust is intense. Combustive intent. Boom Jonny 5 better yet Juan Cinco. Rhetoric rep for my Colorado lingo. Whatever preterit’s wet by my ink flow. Is spelled out B4 (Bingo!). Get it?. Because I Never Get Outwitted. Bold-faced type all capped like a fitted. Make ya move even if you’re arthritic. Something that you thought I wouldn’t do, I did it!. It’s a quilombo!. With Kenny O on the drum roll. We rocket like Dikembe Mutombo. Djembe to bongo to MPC. We unload and win MVP. So let’s be old fashioned. Put the beat on blast. And leave a lil’ something like a geocache. And if anybody wanna smurf wif me. We can take this to the nursery. Like hickory dickory rhyme so slippery. This emcee that emcee. Wish they could switch currencies like a battery. Disbelieve flattery. Realistically it can just be a smattering. To sit and watch the needle peak with Mario C. Reppin CO and 303. Speak up girl even if it’s what’s they’re against. Do the Hellen Keller and confront male arrogance"
the moon,"Ive been. Traveling the land from gravel into sand. Not knowin where Im going never havin any plans. Anything I wanted had to grab it in advance. Abracadabra theres a rabbit in my hands cause. Ive got the magic stick bust the baddest tricks. Fished for a whale brought a ship up out of it. Whats that I just saw? A platypus? Naw.. Maybe its a rat crawling flat on his paws. or a baby dragon just dragon his claws. It doesnt really matter. because its Saturday,. so look thataway. 30 clock matinee,. lets collaborate. and Ill pay you back soon. with a crazy rap tune.. But for now were just gazing at the moon. Wander and ponder the pale blue yonder. To infinite and beyond the city. Beyond the city we all want to see serenity. But some times youve gotta walk the fence to see. That all sidewalks must end eventually. I lay still like a sea anemone. Brainwaves chill at the bottom of the sea. Sentient entity. Let the spirit enter me. Patient, pervasive, how I was meant to be. A stone worn smooth by the swift currents of chaos. A place to lay a smooth array of lush moss. Im parlaying on my day off. floating way off on my thought balloons and snacking on macaroons. But for now Im just gazing at the moon."

there's a war going on for your mind,"There's a war going on for your mind. Media mavens mount surgical strikes from trapper keeper collages and online magazine racks. Cover girl cutouts throw up pop-up ads. Infecting victims with silicone shrapnel. Worldwide passenger pigeons deploy paratroopers. Now it's raining pornography. Lovers take shelter. Post-production debutantes pursue you in nascar chariots. They construct ransom letters from biblical passages and bleed mascara into holy water supplies. There's a war going on for your mind. Industry insiders slang test tube babies to corporate crackheads. They flash logos and blast ghettos. Their embroidered neckties say \""stop snitchin'\"". Conscious rappers and whistleblowers get stitches made of acupuncture needles and marionette strings. There is a war going on for your mind. Professional wrestlers and vice presidents want you to believe them. The desert sky is their bluescreen. They superimpose explosions. They shout at you. \""pay no attention to the men behind the barbed curtain. Nor the craters beneath the draped flags. Those hoods are there for your protection. And meteors these days are the size of corpses. There's a war going on for your mind. We are the insurgents"
we are winning,"Rival gangsters sit down to plan an after-school program. A religious fanatic posts footage of an interfaith service project. A group of teenage boys watches a video of a father playing catch with his son. An adult film star paints thumbnail portraits of elderly couples, fully clothed and smiling. A record executive records a demo of his apology. A policeman makes reverse 911 calls instructing residents to take to the streets. A patriot reports for duty. She's wearing an orange jumpsuit and holding a picket sign. She's ashamed of her birthplace. But retreat is not an option. . Women and children. Frontline. Logon. Tune in. Stand and be counted. Wounded. Stationed. In the belly of the vulture. Watch your back. Theres no civilians. Women children. Frontline. Listen. Consider this a distant early warning. The fires imminent. Pollution gathering dust particles. Funneling through smokestacks. Airwaves. Bandwidth. Disinformation tube fed. Check the label. Delete the virus. Alert the masses. Butterfly wing crosswinds send black hawks toward hurricane survivors. Roses sprout from empty lots and sidewalk cracks. Pacifist guerrillas move undetected through concrete jungles. New forms are beginning to take shape. Once-occupied minds are activating. People are waking up. The insurgency is alive and well. Rise of the flobots. Portrait of the new american insurgent. Rattle and shake the foundation of the world order. Assembly line consent. Resist. Refuse. Inform. Create. Direct loved ones to the trenches. Suit up. Forge rubble into fortresses. Plaster. Cloth. Aluminum. Broken porcelain. Rusted platinum. Burn bloodstains from decompressed diamonds. Hammer the battlecry into braille-studded armor. We are building up a new world. Do not sit idly by. Do not remain neutral. Do not rely on this broadcast alone. We are only as strong as our signal. There is a war going on for your mind. If you are thinking you are winning. Resistance is victory. Defeat is impossible. Your weapons are already in hand. Reach within you and find the means by which to gain your freedom. Fight with tools. Your fate and that of everyone you know depends on it"
whip$ & chain$,"Strange fruit I roll up in my ford taurus. Emissions I wont pass like Gandalf at Moria. Way out of order. Sedan with four doors. Pull out garage and lost side view mirror. My credit card final fantasy breaks the limit. I just paid just brakes to break my lemon. Wont make enough juice for my pessimism. So I’m not for given ’till my debts forgiven. Skim off the top. Convertible roofs. Thinking spanish. Green sounds like the truth. Got it on lock jaw to the tip o’ the tooth. Way I floss no dental insurance to boot. But my chain hangs low, I could double dutch. Keep my eyes to the floor so don’t stumble much. I shine at night from all the carrots. ‘Cause it’s not who you are but who you’re wearing. Stay sportin lashes from the old massa’s. Clasps on the neck says. “Property of the masses”. And whats under the chassis. The block is gentrified while the governor’s classic. Don’t know who the boss is do I hold the power. Or am I powered like horses. Whip is blowin’ out my back like I’m exhaust-ed. Pipes blowin’ more fire than pentecost. Who killed o?. Why and what’s the reason for?. Who starts homicidal wars?. Rich man poor man either or?. Who shows us what we knead?. Who’s got the bread for the luxuries?. Who told us it’s ingrained?. We who hold these whips and chains. If there’s no lock who needs a key?. When did we stop being free?. I see things vis a vis a sea change. Full fathom five people became remains deep beneath chains. We pay into easing these pains. ‘Cause the history is difficult. Wish the results could be flipped like reciprocals. Allow me to renumerate aloud the typical rude awakenings of the drowsy consumer base. Bass boom will make the crowd sing and syncopate with the views that they’re espousing. Synchronize to the stupid take a thousand. Sinning like every excuse they make is valid. Simon Williams I Wonder Man. Just how did our oil get under their sand?. And how did our homes get onto their land?. And how did our foes get guns in their hands?. Conflict diamonds. Child labor tennis shoes. Genocide energy. Gentrified gin and juice. Slave trade banks. Rape-based internet movies. What’s a simple straight-laced human to do. With a strange fate twist and fame. Except talk shit and name off a list of gains. But do you realize I’d find my lips in flames. If I tried to take pride in these whips and chains. Who holds these. Who holds these. Who holds these traps and circuses. We want it. They own it. So we’re going half-berserk for it. Let’s take it. Let’s take it. Let’s take it back before cassettes. Pepsi cans and packs of percocet. 1910 all the factory workers said. Yes we can demand a weekend. If we can get the man to weaken. So if you’re ready than send a beacon. To be continued and to begin. We can’t be content to steep in the anaesthesia. Invisible hands of phantoms depend on. Ya fantasies have been poisoned. But we’ve got the panacea!"
