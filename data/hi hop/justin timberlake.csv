hallelujah (feat. charlie sexton),"Hallelujah (Hope For Haiti Now). [Justin Timberlake]. I've heard there was a secret chord. That David played and it pleased the Lord.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. [Charlie Sexton]. Your faith was strong but you needed proof. You saw her bathing on the roof. Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you. She tied you to her kitchen chair. She broke your throne, she cut your hair. And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. [Justin Timberlake]. Maybe there's a God above. And all I ever learned from love. Was how to shoot at somebody who out drew you. And it's not a cry that you hear at night. It's not somebody who's seen the light. It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. (By: Clara Mastronicola)"

losing my way,Excuse me. Hi my name is Bob and I work at my job. I make 40 some dollars a day. I used to be the man in my home town. Until I started to lose my way. It all goes back to when I dropped out of school. Havin fun I was living the life. But now I got a problem with that little white rock. See I cant put down the pipe. And it is breaking me down. Watching the world spin 'round. While my dreams fall down. Is anybody out there?. It is breaking me down. No more friends around. And my dreams fall down. Is anybody out there?. Can anybody out there hear me?. Cuz I can't seem to hear myself. Can anybody out there see me?. Cuz I can't seem to see myself. It's gotta be a heaven somewhere. Can you save me from this hell?. Can anybody out there feel me?. Cuz I can't seem to feel myself. Losing my way. Keep losing my way. Keep losing my way. Can you help me find my way?. Losing my way. Keep losing my way. Keep losing my way. Can you help me find my way?. Now you gotta understand. I was a family man. I woulda done anything for my own. But I couldn't get a grip of my new found rich. So I ended up all alone. I remember where I was when I got my first bus. See I thought I was living the life. And the craziest thing is I probably never know. The color of my daughter's eyes. And it is breaking me down. Watching the world spin 'round. While my dreams fall down. Is anybody out there?. It is breaking me down. No more friends around. And my dreams fall down. Is anybody out there?. Can anybody out there hear me?. Cuz I can't seem to hear myself. Can anybody out there see me?. Cuz I can't seem to see myself. It's gotta be a heaven somewhere. Can you save me from this hell?. Can anybody out there feel me?. Cuz I can't seem to feel myself. Losing my way. Keep losing my way. Keep losing my way. Can you help me find my way?. Losing my way. Keep losing my way. Keep losing my way. Can you help me find my way?. Oh my god please forgive me (father hear my prayer). Cuz I know I've done some wrong in this life. If I could do it all again. Have just one more chance. I'd take all those wrongs and make them right. Can anybody out there hear me?. Cuz I can't seem to hear myself. Can anybody out there see me?.

rapture (live at brit awards 2003) (feat. kylie minogue),"Toe to toe dancing very close. Body breathing almost comatose. Wall to wall people hypnotized. And they're stepping lightly.

And you try to run but he's got a gun. And he shoots you dead and he eats your head. And then you're in the man from Mars. You go out at night eating cars. You eat Cadillacs Lincolns too. Mercurys and Subaru. And you don't stop. You keep on eating cars. Then when there's no more cars you go out at night. And eat up bars where the people meet. Face to face. Dance cheek to cheek. One to one. Man to man. Dance toe to toe. Don't move too slow 'cause the man from Mars. is through with cars. He's eating bars. Yeah wall to wall. Door to door. Hall to hall. He's gonna eat 'em all.

"tko (black friday remix) (feat. j. cole, asap rocky, pusha t)","I don't understand it. Tell me how could you be so low?. (And all in thrilling, new, living sound) Dammit babe. [J. Cole]. Blood thicker than water, right. Fuck bitches, they all alike. Stand up nigga. Not the falling type. Heart blacker than a Harlem night. Til I met you, they say the devil wear Prada. But I doubt it cause the Lord did bless you. Damn look at that body. Short bus shorty, cause it sure is special. Cole to the rescue, never save a ho. Hoes like to hide their behavior though. Thought you was a down ass bitch. 'til I found that shit a couple days ago. I was home alone, next thing I know. That long ass verse. From a song called ""Control"" was on. The room got nearer, the tune got clearer. That's when I seen the shit playing on your phone. Girl, what is that, a ringtone. Shit, not you too. Man that hype done got you too. Everybody and their momma gassed. Even my momma asked what I'mma do. Decisions, decisions. In case this is war. Then I load up on all ammunition. If a nigga want problems, my trigger's on auto. I'll make sure that nobody miss him. Now pack up your shit, you don't believe in me. I don't need you, I got me, bitch. Same nigga moved to Nyc, bitch. Got a record deal. And a college degree, bitch. Two gold plaques, I produced all the tracks. And I never ever ever lean on Jay-Z, bitch. And after all that achievement. Real nigga never even went and got his teeth fixed. Now you try to play me, bitch?. You try to fuckin' play me? I ought to knock your ass out. Tko, I don't understand it. Tell me how could you be so low. You've been swinging after the bell. And after all of the whistle blows. Tried to go below the belt. Through my chest, perfect hit to the dome. Dammit babe. This ain't the girl I used to know. No, not anymore, Tko. [A$Ap Rocky]. All hail Pretty Flacko, bitch, celebrate it. Had the game on lock, streets serenaded. Now you lame mothafuckas. Lookin' devastated. Bet you niggas wish you never hated, that's the devil ain't it. Fuck that shit, he rich, fuck that shit, he this. Fuck that shit, he that. He black, he don't like blacks. Fuck that shit, he wack. Fuck that shit he raps. Fuck that shit he spits, fuck that bitch. Fuck that bitch he with, finished talking shit. Get up off my dick. The nonsense is synonymous with comments. From the blogs about. Menages with the gossips and the bosses. Fuck surprises. I'm monogamous and not to mention, in my closet. Is a model chick, grimey gothic fits, trapped inside of it. Besides it I'd deny the shit. Y'all should stop the shit. I'm the shit, not just kinda sick. The doc prescribed my shit. Cock it, click-click, opposite, stop and droppin' shit. 'Fore poppin' shit, from popular. To poppin' picks to poppin' tits. She pop her pussy, pop a Xanny. Popular for compliments. Make it rain, she pop that shit. It boosts her confidence. Was supposed to stop this shit. But spit like I forgot some shit. Forgot the topic, I hope God forgive you. Peep my common sense. Tko, I don't understand it. Tell me how could you be so low. You've been swinging after the bell. And after all of the whistle blows. Tried to go below the belt. Through my chest, perfect hit to the dome. Dammit babe. This ain't the girl I used to know, no, not anymore. Tko. [Pusha T]. Jt this like deja vu right?. All this album of the year talk. Niggas claiming they're the best out. I been hot since the Purple Tape. And this cuban's poking my chest out. They keep calling on King Push, this beach chair. I'm stretched out. My name is my name, bitch. Until I'm gone and it's etched out. I been known to blow a quarter brick on baby. Hairs and a messy bun. If I make her mine, I made her mind. She fall in line and we got some. Memoirs of a millionaire, even better I'm a reallionaire. Alaïa skirt, Fendi work. Dress my baby like build-a-bear. Fuck you know about the type of rollie. Fuck you know about blowin' bands. Bezel on it like a grand circle, diamonds in it. Holdin' hands. A1 since day 1, I sold dope and my name rung. I sold dope where I came from. And it's all dope what I made from it. No lie, know why?. Guy Fish in my bowtie. Jt up in the 3 piece and we magic baby. Like showtime. She ain't know, we ain't know, try to trap her. But she ain't slow. Once she trap you with the Da flow. It's lights out, Tko"

where is the love?,"What's wrong with the world, mama. People livin' like they ain't got no mamas. I think the whole world addicted to the drama. Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma. Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism. But we still got terrorists here livin´. In the USA, the big CIA. The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK. But if you only have love for your own race. Then you only leave space to discriminate. And to discriminate only generates hate. And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah. Badness is what you demonstrate. And that's exactly how a n**** works and operates. N**, you gotta have love just to set it straight. Take control of your mind and meditate. Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all. People killin', people dyin'. Children hurt and you hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preach. And would you turn the other cheek. Father, Father, Father help us. Send us some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love (Love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love. The love, the love. It just ain't the same, always unchanged. New days are strange, is the world insane. If love and peace is so strong. Why are there pieces of love that don't belong. Nations droppin' bombs. Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones. With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young. So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone. So I could ask myself really what is goin´ wrong. In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in. Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends. Not respectin´ each other, deny thy brother. A war is goin´ on but the reason's undercover. The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug. If you never know truth then you never know love. Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know). Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know). Where's the love, y'all. People killin', people dyin'. Children hurt and you hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preach. And would you turn the other cheek. Father, Father, Father help us. Send us some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love (Love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love. The love, the love. I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder. As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder. Most of us only care about money makin'. Selfishness got us followin' our own direction. Wrong information always shown by the media. Negative images is the main criteria. Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria. Kids act like what they see in the cinema. Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity. Whatever happened to the fairness in equality. Instead in spreading love we spreading animosity. Lack of understanding, leading lives away from unity. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down. There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under. Gotta keep my faith alive to lovers bound. People killin', people dyin'. Children hurt and you hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preach. And would you turn the other cheek. Father, Father, Father help us. Send us some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love (Love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love)(Chorus) 3x"
"why, when, how","Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum. Do, do, ooh. You're still captivating even though it's been so long. You used to love me tell me baby what went wrong. 'Cause now you march to the beat of a different song. Try to understand that we needed space. But everywhere I turn, I see your face. I have been waiting for you to come home. 'Cause I don't want to be alone. I still love you. Why did you take away your love?. When did you think to just give up?. How am I supposed to carry on now without you. You are my light. I have changed girl, since I last saw you. When you left, you don't know what you put me through. But my heart's still racing just being next to you. I can't escape the magic in your eyes. Is there a way to make you realize. There's no one more special to my heart. But you want us to be apart. I still love you. Why did you take away your love, baby?. When did you think to just give up, yeah?. How am I supposed to carry on now without you. You were my world. You meant everything to me. You're the air I breathe. The song I sing. You were my queen, I was your king. But if we can try to work it. We'll show the world what love is about. Baby, come on, 'cause I can't take no more. Of this loneliness and emptiness. Why did you take away your love?. (Take away your love). When did you think to just give up?. (Oh). How am I supposed to carry on now without you?. Why did you take away your love?. When did you think to just give up?. How am I supposed to carry on without you?. You are my, you are my light"

Now turn around and let me see just what ya curved like. Go grab your friends and y'all can come to the back. Why don't you take a sip upon this champagne. Relax, take your coat off, and let me get your name. I love that hour-glass shape you got upon that frame. I like the way you talk your game we might be one and the same. Now I know you got a buzz off that alcohol. I got a house that can entertain all of y'all. Maybe later on I'll give you a phone call. I'm 'bout to slide out, but I'll get back at ya. And when I call don't give me the run-around. I ain't gonna have you tryin' to play me like a silly clown. Don't second guess it, girl, there ain't nothin' to think about.

Yeah ya you had me lost since the minute gurl an' pig tails. Like Michael Jackson, ""How you do me this way?"". Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake, yeah. They call me Juicy J straight up out the Three 6 Mafia. Ghetto fab playa on these streets I'm tryin' a holla at ya. Quit playing games girl you got my head spinnin' 'round.

Just thinkin' it all started fussin' wit three guys. Nigga pride in the way. But your pride is the way you can fuck. Around get shot down any day. Niggas die everyday. All little bullshit. Dope money, dice games, ordinary hood shit. Could this be cuz of hip-hop music. Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?. Usually niggas don't know what to do. When they back against the wall.

hallelujah (feat. charlie sexton),"Hallelujah (Hope For Haiti Now). [Justin Timberlake]. I've heard there was a secret chord. That David played and it pleased the Lord. But you don't really care for music do you?. It goes like this – the fourth, the fifth. The minor fall, the major lift. The baffled King composing Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. [Charlie Sexton]. Your faith was strong but you needed proof. You saw her bathing on the roof. Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you. She tied you to her kitchen chair. She broke your throne, she cut your hair. And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. [Justin Timberlake]. Maybe there's a God above. And all I ever learned from love. Was how to shoot at somebody who out drew you. And it's not a cry that you hear at night. It's not somebody who's seen the light. It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. (By: Clara Mastronicola)"

Like, our secret nobody else knows and I like that, you know?. It makes me feel like a woman, it makes me feel sexy. It makes me feel... it makes me feel like I'm his.

losing my way,Excuse me. Hi my name is Bob and I work at my job. I make 40 some dollars a day. I used to be the man in my home town. Until I started to lose my way. It all goes back to when I dropped out of school. Havin fun I was living the life. But now I got a problem with that little white rock. See I cant put down the pipe. And it is breaking me down. Watching the world spin 'round. While my dreams fall down. Is anybody out there?. It is breaking me down. No more friends around. And my dreams fall down. Is anybody out there?. Can anybody out there hear me?. Cuz I can't seem to hear myself. Can anybody out there see me?. Cuz I can't seem to see myself. It's gotta be a heaven somewhere. Can you save me from this hell?. Can anybody out there feel me?. Cuz I can't seem to feel myself. Losing my way. Keep losing my way. Keep losing my way. Can you help me find my way?. Losing my way. Keep losing my way. Keep losing my way. Can you help me find my way?. Now you gotta understand. I was a family man. I woulda done anything for my own. But I couldn't get a grip of my new found rich. So I ended up all alone. I remember where I was when I got my first bus. See I thought I was living the life. And the craziest thing is I probably never know. The color of my daughter's eyes. And it is breaking me down. Watching the world spin 'round. While my dreams fall down. Is anybody out there?. It is breaking me down. No more friends around. And my dreams fall down. Is anybody out there?. Can anybody out there hear me?. Cuz I can't seem to hear myself. Can anybody out there see me?. Cuz I can't seem to see myself. It's gotta be a heaven somewhere. Can you save me from this hell?. Can anybody out there feel me?. Cuz I can't seem to feel myself. Losing my way. Keep losing my way. Keep losing my way. Can you help me find my way?. Losing my way. Keep losing my way. Keep losing my way. Can you help me find my way?. Oh my god please forgive me (father hear my prayer). Cuz I know I've done some wrong in this life. If I could do it all again. Have just one more chance. I'd take all those wrongs and make them right. Can anybody out there hear me?. Cuz I can't seem to hear myself. Can anybody out there see me?.

Mercurys and Subaru. And you don't stop. You keep on eating cars. Then when there's no more cars you go out at night. And eat up bars where the people meet. Face to face. Dance cheek to cheek. One to one. Man to man. Dance toe to toe. Don't move too slow 'cause the man from Mars. is through with cars. He's eating bars. Yeah wall to wall. Door to door. Hall to hall. He's gonna eat 'em all.

I can't believe it's ending this way. Just so confused about it. Feeling the blues about it. I just can't do without ya. Tell me is this fair. Is this the way it's really going down?.

You said that you were moving on now. (on now). Maybe I should do the same. (maybe I should do the same). The funny thing about that is. I was ready to give you my name.

where is the love?,"What's wrong with the world, mama. People livin' like they ain't got no mamas. I think the whole world addicted to the drama. Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma. Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism. But we still got terrorists here livin´. In the USA, the big CIA. The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK. But if you only have love for your own race. Then you only leave space to discriminate. And to discriminate only generates hate. And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah. Badness is what you demonstrate. And that's exactly how a n**** works and operates. N**, you gotta have love just to set it straight. Take control of your mind and meditate. Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all. People killin', people dyin'. Children hurt and you hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preach. And would you turn the other cheek. Father, Father, Father help us. Send us some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love (Love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love. The love, the love. It just ain't the same, always unchanged. New days are strange, is the world insane. If love and peace is so strong. Why are there pieces of love that don't belong. Nations droppin' bombs. Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones. With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young. So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone. So I could ask myself really what is goin´ wrong. In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in. Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends. Not respectin´ each other, deny thy brother. A war is goin´ on but the reason's undercover. The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug. If you never know truth then you never know love. Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know). Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know). Where's the love, y'all. People killin', people dyin'. Children hurt and you hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preach. And would you turn the other cheek. Father, Father, Father help us. Send us some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love (Love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love. The love, the love. I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder. As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder. Most of us only care about money makin'. Selfishness got us followin' our own direction. Wrong information always shown by the media. Negative images is the main criteria. Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria. Kids act like what they see in the cinema. Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity. Whatever happened to the fairness in equality. Instead in spreading love we spreading animosity. Lack of understanding, leading lives away from unity. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down. There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under. Gotta keep my faith alive to lovers bound. People killin', people dyin'. Children hurt and you hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preach. And would you turn the other cheek. Father, Father, Father help us. Send us some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love (Love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love)(Chorus) 3x"

'Cause now you march to the beat of a different song. Try to understand that we needed space. But everywhere I turn, I see your face. I have been waiting for you to come home. 'Cause I don't want to be alone. I still love you. Why did you take away your love?. When did you think to just give up?. How am I supposed to carry on now without you. You are my light. I have changed girl, since I last saw you. When you left, you don't know what you put me through. But my heart's still racing just being next to you. I can't escape the magic in your eyes. Is there a way to make you realize. There's no one more special to my heart. But you want us to be apart. I still love you. Why did you take away your love, baby?. When did you think to just give up, yeah?. How am I supposed to carry on now without you. You were my world. You meant everything to me. You're the air I breathe. The song I sing. You were my queen, I was your king. But if we can try to work it. We'll show the world what love is about. Baby, come on, 'cause I can't take no more. Of this loneliness and emptiness. Why did you take away your love?. (Take away your love). When did you think to just give up?. (Oh). How am I supposed to carry on now without you?. Why did you take away your love?. When did you think to just give up?. How am I supposed to carry on without you?. You are my, you are my light"
