I'm in the hood. [Verse 1: Brisco]. I'm posted on the corner, twisting that good. I got that all black dickie on, i'm keepin it hood. What it is, I'm the Opa-locka goon. Got work in the trap, and the Chevy droppin. soon. See Cash Money rubberbands e'm, bands e'm. Since I got the deal, girls say'n he so handsome. I'm a Dade County, Yorker Boy. I earn stripes, I got soldiers that'll flop you 4 it. Now I'm bouncin with a hood rat. She think I love her, but I use her 4 her food stamps. its the Ghetto, It's whateva, you cook it, I'll shoot it. And don't worry about them smokers, we. keepin it movin (keepin it movin). I know Cubans that knows O's. If I ask for it, they send it by the boat load. Weezy Wee, I think it's a wrap. And If you need me, you know where to find me at. I'm in the hood. [Chorus x2]. [Verse 2: Lil Wayne]. Uptown New Orleans, like always. Cash Money boy, shine like bald heads. Big Bezel make my watch look like a hog head. And all I do is smoke trees, call me log head. I'm butter on the bread like Parkay. And I am all about ""mi"" like ""Do Re. "". I'm in the hood, i'm the hood like Dope, Yay. Nappy ass hair like Buckwheat, Otay. Hollygrove, Eagle St. be my damn hood. Where you can get murdered for free like can goods. I got 12 Barbaros under the lamb hood. I can bring a Kentucky Derby to the damn hood. Sunshine diamonds help me tan good. And I'll let it blow like a band wood. I call Briscoe, I'm on South Beach. 30 mins. later, Opa-locka is where I'll be. [Chorus x2]. [Verse 3: Brisco]. Like Kroger cups, watered juice, pickled eggs, and. pig feet. If you got beef, you know just where to find me. I'm in the hood, or better yet, the projects. Where baby mama's trippin and them goons livin heartless. 3 rules, Get money, don't tell. and if that Welfare check come late, raise hell. I'm a poor boy, I ain't got shit. And I hope they don't tell Baby, I'ma hit me a lick. [Lil Wayne:] Man, I'm so Hollygrove. Stand strong in that water like a Commodor. Black holes in yo' white tee, Dominoes. Me and Briscoe, Cash Money carnivores. I am New Orleans like carnivals. And in the hood, call me Weezy the honorable. These other rappers so ironicle. And if I ain't in the mansion then I'm up in the. Phantom or... [Courus x4]"
