everybody know me,"[Mika Means:]. Attention all club goers and party seekers,. Oooh yeah, it's Mika Means,. In the ATL everybody floss,. Everytime I go out everything costs,. Only money talks on Monday to Sunday. Never only one day,. Then party like a payday,. Excuse me while I make my way to the front line of the club. I just jumped out the truck,. In the velvet room you can find me on stage. With a cd in my hand talking to the DJ,. If I ever lose my cool, gotta take it up top,. Where it's cold and it's gritty,. What's up New York city,. Where they don't give a fuck. Bout your story or your luck. Everybody gotta hustle when you living up north,. [Chorus:]. I make big money, I drive big cars,. Everybody know me,. Everybody know me. Everybody know me,. Everybody know me,. Everybody know me,. I love big things,. I like big bling. Everybody know me,. Everybody know me,. When I wanna get away I MIA,. Club Sobe they know me,. Transport me to long beach,. Hey bay bay,. If I really want a party, hello LA,. Hey dro all day, hey paparazzay,. In the middle of the westside,. I throw it this way,. When I really wanna party, it's St Tropez,. If you thinking what I'm thinking everybody say Ayy,. Everybody say Ohh,. Everybody bring the party from the VIP to the floor,. Spend a little more,. If you ain't making it then fake it then. No matter what the cost is,. Show em who the boss is,. Say.... [Chorus]. [Lil Wayne:]. Uh ummm, everybody know me,. I stop... and let the bullshit go before me,. And since I really ball, they be trying to throw me,. King size bed, bad bitch below me,. Walked up on her like what it do shorty,. She replied shit whatever you can do for me,. I told her I'm me, she said me to,. I told her I'm a three and I make big money,. I made young money,. I got a lot of bitches you can take one from me,. Weezy F and the F is for feature,. Mean like Mika, huh. [Chorus]"
