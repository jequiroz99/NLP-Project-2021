You should've paid just a little more attention. You let our love slip out your sight. In vision you and now its shatteres. No more time for walking backwards. Its time to let it be. I'm gonna keep on moving forward. I found my way through the maze. There's someone better out there for me. How do I love what isn't there?. What we had slipped into thin air.

hood anthem,"Huuhuuhuuhuuhuuhuuhuuhuu [continues to repeat]. [verse 1:]. Somp people don't really know what it means to be hood.. They think ur just a stuffler and ur up to know good.. They think these brothers don't know nothing else but bling and white tees.. And they think that all these women can do is somebody's weave. They think we're hustlers, gangsters, and goons riding by. But be easy with your mouth, cuz u dont know nuthin bout, the life that gets lived, the struggles we deal. its hard some days man, if you feel me then say:. [chorus: x2]. Yes i'm hood. H-o-o-d. Dont speak on it if you dont know what it means. I was raised in the hood. Overcame in the hood. Not ashamed of the hood, cuz the hood is in me.. [bridge:]. Everybody put your hands up and rep the hood. if you wanna you can stand up, i know its good, dont be ashamed of the hood,be in the change in the hood, aint nuthin strange bout the hood itz in everybody. [verse 2:]. No matter what you do they'll never see us no different. no matter what we accomplish __________ we gettin honors for grammys, billboard chart toppers, thought they could stop us but we still got an oscar. they can give it up because we thinkin bout them and thats a wrap. its a movement, baby, and it aint no stoppin that. So imma keep doin me, i hope you keep doin you, we're look out for one another, at the end of the day i'm still hood. [chorus x2]. [bridge]. [verse 3:]. I dont matter if you got some hood in your blood, it don't make you any less, represent it like, what?. It dont matter it makes you more real then the rest. people think its disrespect, but consider it a blessing.. Cuz you grew up on another side. So the world with a different eye, people dont realize, so we learn to appreciate the little things, or the joy life brings, aint nuthin wrong wit bein hood.. [chorus: repeats util song fades out]"
how will i know,"""How Will I Know"". I know there is something that I'm feeling. But I can't quite put it into words. It's got me hopin hopin that you feelin it too. Cause for me it's a first. Does anyone truly understand what real love is about. Don't say I'm too young to know what's real. My heart skips a beat. I can hardly breathe. Every time that he comes near. It's so amazing almost crazy how. I'm thinkin bout you lately. Tell me how in the world did it come to this. It took me by suprise. When you opened my eyes. To hopefully show me what love is. How will I know. Could it be the butterflies I feel whenever I'm with you. How will I know. Or the way I'm at a loss of words I can hardly keep my cool. How will I know. Everyday now stop stop stop I keep thinkin bout you. How will I know I'm in love. How will I know. Could it be the butterflies I feel whenever I'm with you. How will I know.

best of it,"I collected the pieces of a broken heart. Back to the way it poured on, bad memories. I decided to let go. Let go of the whole world. Let bygones be bygones. Cause life's way too sure.

So make the best of it. Even when things don't go your way. Just know you gotta make the best of it. Make the best of it, best of it. Best of it, best of it, best of it.

Open up your heart and see. That it takes too much to hate. Loving comes so easily. Didn't let it go. Cause everybody knows. You only got one life to live. So make the best of it. Oh, life's a funny thing. So make the best of it. Even when things don't go your way. Just know you gotta make the best of it. Make the best of it, best of it. I used to feel. That something's always holding me down. Looking in the mirror. No one else is around. Me, myself and I had to figure it out. What's wrong. Cause I was always standing in my own way. Letting things I can't control. Take a hold of me. Now I'm free, now I'm free. You only got one life to live. So make the best of it. Oh, life's a funny thing. So make the best of it. Even when things don't go your way. Just know you gotta make the best of it. Make the best of it, best of it. You only got one life to live. So make the best of it. Oh, life's a funny thing.

hologram,"You know you can't hold on to a shadow. After the sun's gone down. And you can't touch what's invisible. That's what I am to you now. So tell me how does it feel. My love for you wasn't just an illusion. I wish that you could say the same. You had me filled with so much confusion. I was afraid to let us fade. With you, but I'm better on my own. How do I love what isn't there?. What we had slipped into thin air. My eyes wish for you to be standing here. But God knows it's best you disappear. I can't stop my hands. Reaching out for a hologram. (I'm already gone, I'm already gone). You're reaching out for a hologram. (I'm already gone, I'm already gone). You couldn't love me in 3 dimensions even if you tried. You should've paid just a little more attention. You let our love slip out your sight. In vision you and now its shatteres. No more time for walking backwards. Its time to let it be. I'm gonna keep on moving forward. I found my way through the maze. There's someone better out there for me. How do I love what isn't there?. What we had slipped into thin air. My eyes wish for you to be standing here. But God knows it's best you disappear. I can't stop my hands. Reaching out for a hologram. (I'm already gone, I'm already gone). You're reaching out for a hologram. (I'm already gone, I'm already gone). Everything looks so much clearer. Once the clouds have gone away. And my loves flowing like a river. Have they all been washed away?. With you, I was drowning but now I. I can breathe again. again. To you I'm no longer here. I'm just a hologram. You can't touch me. I'm just a hologram. How do I love what isn't there?. What we had slipped into thin air. My eyes wish for you to be standing here. But God knows it's best you disappear. I can't stop my hands. Reaching out for a hologram. (I'm already gone, I'm already gone). You're reaching out for a hologram. (I'm already gone, I'm already gone)"

hood anthem,"Huuhuuhuuhuuhuuhuuhuuhuu [continues to repeat]. [verse 1:]. Somp people don't really know what it means to be hood.. They think ur just a stuffler and ur up to know good.. They think these brothers don't know nothing else but bling and white tees.. And they think that all these women can do is somebody's weave. They think we're hustlers, gangsters, and goons riding by. But be easy with your mouth, cuz u dont know nuthin bout, the life that gets lived, the struggles we deal. its hard some days man, if you feel me then say:. [chorus: x2]. Yes i'm hood. H-o-o-d. Dont speak on it if you dont know what it means. I was raised in the hood. Overcame in the hood. Not ashamed of the hood, cuz the hood is in me.. [bridge:]. Everybody put your hands up and rep the hood. if you wanna you can stand up, i know its good, dont be ashamed of the hood,be in the change in the hood, aint nuthin strange bout the hood itz in everybody. [verse 2:]. No matter what you do they'll never see us no different. no matter what we accomplish __________ we gettin honors for grammys, billboard chart toppers, thought they could stop us but we still got an oscar. they can give it up because we thinkin bout them and thats a wrap. its a movement, baby, and it aint no stoppin that. So imma keep doin me, i hope you keep doin you, we're look out for one another, at the end of the day i'm still hood. [chorus x2]. [bridge]. [verse 3:]. I dont matter if you got some hood in your blood, it don't make you any less, represent it like, what?. It dont matter it makes you more real then the rest. people think its disrespect, but consider it a blessing.. Cuz you grew up on another side. So the world with a different eye, people dont realize, so we learn to appreciate the little things, or the joy life brings, aint nuthin wrong wit bein hood.. [chorus: repeats util song fades out]"

(Me Myself and I). [Verse 1:]. I know when I first started out, I was scared. Cuz I didn't know what this was about. It kinda felt like the world was changing around me. And suddenly I got famous. Who woulda thought that I could be an idol?. Sharing dreams with kids calling me a role model?. (What a title). Everybody treating me differently. But I'm still the same Ke-Ke from down the street. [Chorus:]. When I think of how far I've come. I wanna shout it out so turn up your volume. I wished upon a shooting star I. Believed my dreams and followed my heart. When I think about where I've been. I never woulda thought this be the life I'd live. So think of me as living proof. That anything could happen when you just believe in you. I'm just a young kid, from the Chi. With a bag full of dreams that are bigger than life. I aint got no limits but the big blue sky. For Me, Myself and I. If you're a young kid, represent. It don't matter where you come from or where you been. So who's reaching for the sky?. Put your hands up high and say Me, Myself and I. [Verse 2:]. You gotta know that nothing is permanant.

music box,"[Verse 1:]. Listen up, turn your box up, gather all around. This one's strictly for the ghetto. Some of y'all recognize, some of y'all won't. Better pay attention and listen close. There was an old lady who lived in my hood that sold freeze pops for a quarter. Had so many kids that I lost count, more sons than she had daughters. And every night before they would fall asleep. They would pray for shelter and food to eat. But the landlord huffed and blew the house down and now they out on the streets. And now she cleans, she mops the tears they drop. The only sound that drowns it out comes from my music box. [Chorus:]. So just let the music play (Play). Don't let it stop (No). It ain't easy growing up in the hood but I got my music box.

Had rubber bands, dimes, and quarters worth a block put him away. Left his wife and kids and a sexist teenage daughter. Couldn't shake the reflections, starved to perfection. I've seen it all before.
