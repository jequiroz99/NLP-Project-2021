the light,"Yeah... Doo-doo-doo, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm... Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo YO... I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this. Gotta be somethin for me to write this. Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute. Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it. Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together. Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever. I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you. I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too. Because of you, feelings I handle with care. Some niggaz recognize the light but they can't handle the glare. You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin shirts. If relationship is effort I will match your work. I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most. They say the end is near, it's important that we close... .. to the most, high. Regardless of what happen on him let's rely. There are times.. when you'll need someone... I will be by your side... There is a light, that shines,. special for you, and me... Yo, yo, check it. It's important, we communicate. and tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch. I never call you my bitch or even my boo. There's so much in a name and so much more in you. Few understand the union of woman and man. And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land. But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write. from an East Coast shine night's moon, you my light. If heaven had a height, you would be that tall. Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all. Let's stick to understandin and we won't fall. For better or worse times, I hope to me you call. So I pray everyday more than anything. friends will stay as we begin to lay. this foundation for a family - love ain't simple. Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually. Granted we known each other for some time. It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine. There are times.. when you'll need someone... I will be by your side, oh darling. There is a light, that shines,. special for you, and me... Yeah.. yo, yo, check it. It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop. and I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop. Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh. Suggestin beats I should rhyme to. At times when I'm lost I try to find you. You know to give me space when it's time to. My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness. Truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence. The time we committed love it was real good. Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good. I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal. it's how I must treat you. As my reflection in light I'ma lead you. And whatever's right, I'ma feed you. Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da. Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace. There are times.. when you'll need someone... I will be by your side... There is a light, that shines,. special for you, and me... (I'll) take my chances.. before they pass... .. pass me by, oh darling... You need to look at the other side... You'll agree..."

i used to love h.e.r.,"(Verse One:). I met this girl, when I was ten years old. And what I loved most she had so much soul. She was old school, when I was just a shorty. Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me on the regular,. Not a church girl she was secular. Not about the money, no studs was mic checkin her. But I respected her, she hit me in the heart. A few New York niggaz, had did her in the park. But she was there for me, and I was there for her. Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her. and just cool out, cool out and listen to her. Sittin on a bone, wishin that I could do her. Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be. Because we related, physically and mentally. And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around. Slim was fresh yo, when she was underground. Original, pure untampered and down sister. Boy I tell ya, I miss her. (Verse Two:). Now periodically I would see. Ol` girl at the clubs, and at the house parties. She didn't have a body but she started gettin thick quick. Did a couple of videos and became afrocentric. Out goes the weave, in goes the braids beads. medallions. She was on that tip about, stoppin the violence. About my people she was teachin me. By not preachin to me but speakin to me. In a method that was leisurely, so easily I approached. She dug my rap, that's how we got close. But then she broke to the West coast, and that was. cool. Cause around the same time, I went away to school. And I'm a man of expandin, so why should I stand in her way. She probably get her money in L.A.. And she did stud, she got big pub but what was foul. She said that the pro-black, was goin out of style. She said, afrocentricity, was of the past. So she got into R&B hip-house bass and jazz. Now black music is black music and it's all good. I wasn't salty, she was with the boys in the hood. Cause that was good for her, she was becomin well. rounded. I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit. Just havin fun, not worried about anyone. And you could tell, by how her titties hung. (Verse Three:). I might've failed to mention that the shit was. creative. But once the man got you well he altered the native. Told her if she got an energetic gimmick. That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy. Now I see her in commercials, she's universal. She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle. Now she be in the burbs lickin rock and dressin hip. And on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city. Talkin about poppin glocks servin rocks and hittin. switches. Now she's a gangsta rollin with gangsta bitches. Always smokin blunts and gettin drunk. Tellin me sad stories, now she only fucks with the. funk. Stressin how hardcore and real she is. She was really the realest, before she got into. showbiz. I did her, not just to say that I did it. But I'm committed, but so many niggaz hit it. That she's just not the same lettin all these groupies do her. I see niggaz slammin her, and takin her to the sewer. But I'ma take her back hopin that the shit stop. Cause who I'm talkin bout y'all is hip-hop"
don't come my way,"(featuring Slick Rick). [Common]. Yeah yeah. You know, Slick, why do he wanna come crib. Acting like he know how the brothers live?. We have to let 'em know. We have to let 'em know. Heeeeere we go. Behold a pair of white horses on the Death Wish course. Been watching MTV, reading articles in The Source. Lost on the other side of the river. Where death approaches the livest nigga. I wonder why this wigga. Would even come around my tilt. With grandmothers cry, uncles get high, and cats get pealed. My guys will deal with him, he got no rhythm. So let the steel hit him, we speaking jail diction. Hoe work and day oppression. Turn up the bass and let the system thump. So my neighbors won't hear the sparks as the lead gets pumped. Its a pre-(?) agreement in the cement jungle. Kill each other over money and white boys for fun. [Female Singer]. Don't come my way. Hawks feel the day. Things don't change, oh no. Don't you come my way. Come my way. See the day, oh no. [Slick Rick]. Little family so a junky living act as. Started smoking crack to fill the void within my black ass. 1999, rolling as some broke cat. These white kids asking questions. about where to buy some coke at. Kinda shock a dude, Ruler turn a sucker to. Show 'em where these cats at, maybe earn a rock or two. Retarded, not knowing the kid hardest trife. Kill 'em, asswipes, I'll have a new start in my life. Till the drug lord knock upon their (?). Disprespected, ""Washed up rapper, what the fuck you want?"". The often asked, I could see others laugh. I got my man he wanna a buy a half a ki off your ass. Scolding 'em, sleeping and sold on 'em. Gimme the cash,. let me flash it through this peephole on 'em (Check it out). He got hyped quick, pursued in the tight crib. Emptied on their asses, including the white kids. [Female Singer]. Don't come my way. Hawks feel the day. Things don't change, oh no. Don't you come my way. Come my way. See the day, oh no. [Common]. Yo, How'd dude go cop a brick when he ain't got the loot. Ricky D, get the heat and 'Treat 'Em Like a Prostitute"". This wigga gots no heart from his Iowa start. [Slick Rick]. And a Section 8 cat, he don't want any part. I put two in there, ruin their, pursuing their souvenir. Nigga, what the fuck is that white behind DOING here?. Won't you say you wanted to slug 'em. ""If your not here for the cable or the (?) ya BUGGIN"". [Common]. Lights flooded the scene, there was blood and si-reens. (sirens). The cops shot the brother, I still hear him scream. Black mans reality, white mans bad dream. Familiar scene from the Ickeys to the Brady Green. Its pissy hallways, broke elevators always (ya know). Ain't no place for our children to play. I try to go out in the summer and be feeling the day. These broke and stupid niggas, yo they still in the way. [Slick Rick]. One of the mightiest slang, and plus the night is young. I got long term money draining ideas from. Since they far, I'll find your brown sweetheart. Just being white your like golden goose around these parts. Hey retard, better hurry in, my name is Father Marion. I'll hold that American Express card your carrying. Put your nose up, don't, shut up, provoking and woke up. First where do you live, how much money your folks got?. [Female Singer]. Don't come my way. Hawks feel the day. Things don't change, oh no. Don't you come my way. Come my way. See the day, oh no. Don't come my way. Hawks feel the day. Things don't change, oh no. Don't you come my way. Come my way. See the day, oh no. [Common]. We let the rhythm go. Common Sense will 'em hit where I hit 'em. Common Sense will spin 'em check it out. I guess I did 'em where they should to be done. Ain't nothing new about the wonder rap son. Closed styles like captions yo its time for some action. Man, I get bread, niggas get me sled. When I come up off their head, it was said. For that, yo, it's like this. Common Sense'll strike this, mic this. Just like some punchlines. How niggas follow me like one time. Everybody love me like the sunshine. Combine, ain't that you never knew of. Niggas say one but I've got two loves. Check it out, now how I do love...."

ghetto dreams (feat. nas),"Ghetto dreams. Ghetto ghetto dreams. Ghetto niggas' dreams. From the hood. [Common]. I want a bitch that look good and cook good. Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood. Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes. Plus she tricking from the dough that her man makes. We got our own handshake, her titties ain't fake. Fucking in the car cause we just can't wait. To get home, early in the morn' getting stoned. Pretty with her eyes low, running by Bible. The type of bitch that Big said he would die for. Is the type that I would rather stay alive for. Tats on her back, looking all tribal. She know shoes like she know survival. Well put together, she weathers the storm. Seen her brother die so forever she's strong. Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform. Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on. Ghetto dreams. Ghetto ghetto dreams. Ghetto niggas' dreams. From the hood. [Common]. I don't even say shit, she can feel it. I toss the realest, toenails acrylic. Ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it. Baby in one arm, the other is a skillet. Fried chicken, macaroni, raised on the back of Stony. Ghetto press, she's my Apolloni[a]. Like trigger had the back of Tony, Montana. Reminded me a me of my, of my mama. Knowing the drama like she know when to joke. Steal a nigga's squares, not wanting me to smoke. I poke my head out of Benzes. Streets that I know who my friends is. In this love for the money, power and clothes. A ghetto housewife watch reality shows. She might get to snapping when the cabinets ain't closed. When the cameras start snapping, she's ready to pose. Ghetto dreams. Ghetto ghetto dreams. Ghetto niggas' dreams. From the hood. [Nas]. I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes. Subject matter be changing too quickly at times. So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story. Call me a pro in the pussy category. Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention. For me, getting women turned from sport to addiction. Powerful women playing the roles of submission. Lawyers on leashes, congress, women inflictin'. Pain onto my game wanted and I'm sadistic. They liked it, they dyked it, devices twisted. 'til I get a nice chick, to get me on some nice shit. Crib raising kids, Labrador behind the white fence. But I'm still single, looking for Cleopatra. African Queen, yo look at me, I'm a bachelor. Y'all niggas in trouble, keep your girls behind closed doors. Cross your fingers, be happy I haven't chose yours. She love glamour, bought her Vera Wang sandals. Valentino bags is my etiquette my man is. Half hood half class, photographers' cameras. Caught us out there, the spotlight, hope she can handle this. She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit. Events having sponsored have some alcohol product. Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms. You live your dream with me when you are just in the projects. Ghetto dreams. Ghetto ghetto dreams. Ghetto niggas' dreams. From the hood"

Yo, just relax, take it easy slow down. I had this, I had this friend of mine. Who just, you know, he was movin too fast, yaknawimsayin?. I told him to slow down, he said the sun don't chill. I said, I said still, I said still, you gotta. Just appreciate life, sit back, don't let it fly right past you. No matter what go on I'm still gettin mine. No matter the year, no matter the place, no matter the time. [Common]. Check it, it's like I'm fightin for freedom, writin for freedom. These record company niggas I don't like when I see em. My ancestors, when I'm writin I see em, and talk wit em. Hopin in the promise land I can walk wit em. Shitted on, so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall wit em. Molest concepts, start rhythm, paid dues, bought wisdom. As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call. Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall. MC's reckless ?I ball? why y'all wanna go and do that?. Must've thought I was solo, the name just ain't the U-Ac. No mo', still together. Like in the ghetto photo wit one nigga in the chair. Holdin liquor in despair, gang signs in the air. I shine in spaces where time is just a glare. Hold the mic like a memory. Niggas say I'm nice wit metaphors but these are similes. Street ministry, my poetry's a penitentiary, track is visitation. Sentences is life, I'm like chief up in this demonstration. Still....

You squirm wit this coughin, whippin cough. Six days of madness and you might throw me off. On this great ball of stress that they call the earth. I'ma show y'all in rhyme just how much shit I been through. And all the place I went to, always played the low. It's like a competition, this mission here I'm tellin you. Slip up and rhyme-ass niggas here is fellin you. Crash courses, slow down you can't learn that quick. Cuz I'm the dead eye, wit the red eye, from Chi to L-I. I thought y'all knew, every year I grew, I'm still growin. And in a year or two I hope my girl'll be showin. A male seed, praise God I name him Moses. I lead people I want him to, that's why I chose this. Now is the glass half-full or half-empty. Common, why they tempt me?. The king of the simply, bore in mic. I always stay on top cuz I give niggas what they like. I know y'all hate that why I feel I owe y'all everyday. If y'all hear it a thousand times, it's gon' be the same way. The 'Dat-Father, go farther, why bother. Now I'm a peaceful man, I don't want no stress. You know I'm still.... ""Still gettin mine, in the"" ""ONE"" ""NINE"" ""NINE"" ""NINE"". *sample cut and played in background 3X*. [Common]. Yo yo, some get Range Rovers, some religion change-over. Angel on my main shoulder tellin me remain sober. Token nigga, game's over ain't no payola in freestyle. In battles, I'm warring/Warren like a G-Child. Searchin for the child in me, this style in me. This release is like the piece that's now in me. They tried to 'sassinate me god, like Martin on the bal-cony. Lyrically I put a hit on em, cuz I'm the style-Nitty. Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty. Tryin to get a chick to kick it wit me till the tilt. Told her my Chamber's like Wilt. Built wit her for a sec, let her know I had respect. Less than a hour she was givin me neck, yo I'm still gettin mine.... ""Still gettin mine, in the"" ""ONE"" ""NINE"" ""NINE"" ""NINE"". *sample cut and played in background 4X*."
testify,"[Common]. She walk into the court her knees buckle. Saying for a man to survive he needn't hustle. Seen and been through struggle her whole life. Made a transition from being his ho to his wife. Stifling, the night upend the ATF bust in. Her daddy was a hustla so she love them. Looked at the jury how can they judge him, she screamed. [sample]. Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away. Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away. Please let me testify. [Common]. Fear in her chest her face in tears, had her mans back he was facing years. In her name though the place was his. They trying to take everything except the kids. But years she been through stumbling fights. While he trying to hustle that white. Up all night wondering if hes alive. Seeing him tried she bubbled inside and screamed. [sample]. Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away. Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away. Please let me testify. [Common]. The judge called for order the court reporter makin her words shorter. His lawyer sat next to him, she could see how the trial was affecting him. It hurt for her eyes to connect with him, using her lies for protecting him. They arrested him for murder, and gun possession. As they read back her confession she screamed. [sample]. Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away. Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away. Please let me testify. [Common]. The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff. Emotional outbursts tears and smeared makeup. He stated, he was guilty on all charges. She's shaking like she took it the hardest. A spin artist, she brought her face up laughing. That's when the prosecutor realized what happened. All that speaking her mind testifying and crying. When this bitch did the crime- the queenpin.... [sample]. Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away. Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away. Please let me testify.

glory (feat. john legend),"One day when the glory comes. It will be ours, it will be ours. One day when the war is won. We will be sure, we will be sure. Oh glory. Hands to the heavens, no man, no weapon. Formed against, yes glory is destined. Every day women and men become legends. Sins that go against our skin become blessings. The movement is a rhythm to us. Freedom is like religion to us. Justice is juxtapositionin' us. Justice for all just ain't specific enough. One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us. Truant livin' livin' in us, resistance is us. That's why rosa sat on the bus. That's why we walk through ferguson with our hands up. When it go down we woman and man up. They say, stay down and we stand up. Shots, we on the grown, the camera panned up. King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up. One day when the glory comes. It will be ours, it will be ours. Oh glory. Now the war is not over, victory isn't won. And we'll fight on to the finish, and when it's all done. We'll cry glory, oh glory. We'll cry glory, oh glory. Selma's now for every man, woman and child. Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd. They marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now. Never look back, we done gone hundreds of miles. From dark roads he rose, to become a hero. Facin' the league of justice, his power was the people. Enemy is lethal, a king became regal. Saw the face of jim crow under a bald eagle. No one can win the war individually. It takes the wisdom of the elders. And young people's energy. Welcome to the story we call victory. The comin' of my Lord, my eyes have seen the glory. One day when the glory comes. It will be ours, it will be ours. Oh glory"

Struggle is my address. Where pain and crack lives. Gunshots coming from sounds of blackness. Given this game with no time to practice. Born on the blacklist. Told I'm a little average. A life with no cabbage. That's no money if you're from where I'm from. Funny,. I just want some of your sun. Dark clouds seem to follow me. Alcohol that my pops swallowed bottle me. No apology. I walk with a boulder on my shoulder. It's a cold war. I'm a colder soldier. I hold the same fight that made martin luther the. King. I ain't usin' it for the right thing.

I'm from a side where we outta control. Rap music and the hood play a fatherly role. My story like yours, yo, gotta be told. Tryin' to make it from a gangsta to a godlier role. And jewish people in cold caves. Hate has no color or age. Flip the page. Now my rage became freedom right. Write dreams in the dark. They far, but I can see em. I believe in heaven more than hell. Blessings more than jail. In the ghetto, let love prevail. With a story to tell. My eyes see the glory of, well,. The world waitin' for me to yell. I have a dream. I am happy. I am I am happy.

the sun god,"Common... Common.... {Common}. Yeah, yeah. Hi-Tek. {Verse One}. Free the rhyme or risk a dig into a deep sound abyss. Unit in the stash the beats and never found the shit. Experience like Hendrix, keep my sound enriched. Cats ask about my stitch, to me they soundin bitch. In my sounds the glitch of hatred, for cats who ain't make it. I'ma give it, as far as you can take it. Tried to take the safe way, told you there's a gateway to skinny. Many can find it but few can climb it. I'm open-minded like a pothead. Doin what I gotta do to keep the spot fed. In the climate, of locked dreads, corn-rows, torn souls. Worn hoes, who been molested by they uncle. I bundle, amongst you cold mother-uckers. The world is bitter, like baby mothers. Look how far El Dorados and wine bottles drug us. Least God and the sun love us, it's the Sun God. {Verse Two}. Everywhere is broken glass. Nephews smokin squares, nieces smokin grass. Try not to say shoot around my daughter she already know to blast. Catchin the future, don't know who threw the past. It's the, year of the snake and the hidden dragon. Niggaz is fake like bitches braggin. Listen to the ocean and the stars, keep my vision in motion. In motion like cars. I'm down to Earth, at times I feel closer to Mars. The world is yours, I'm hopin it's ours. Some say the Gods is crazy, I see God in our babies. Child of the sun, I allowed it to raise me. (.. from a distance) niggaz tried to appraise me. I'm hard to read like graffiti so it don't phase me. My days be spent, behind dream's tent. Through the sun the divine being is sent. It's the Sun God. {Verse Three}. Letters from prison sayin we need a better religion. I'm a rebel that listens from a eighty-seven position. I can't crystalize the mission lies within. Born to die even in death we begin. It's heavy 'jo learnin what we already know. and carry low swing on a chariot slow. Brothers stick though remindin me of revolution. If the drama comes I'ma have to uhh pop his gun. It's the Sun God, yeah"

the believer (feat. john legend),"[john legend]. I believe in the light that shines and will never die. Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive. They will talk about us. Like they talked about the kings before us. They will talk about us. [common]. These are the words of a believer, achiever, leader of the globe. Feeding souls of those in need. I bleed the blood of the struggle. Walking over troubled puddles. Hustles in my chest, no hustle no progress. Extremities of life and it’s process. Birth of a son, death of another. With love I can rest both mothers. And told ‘em, who’s in control is the one thats above us. I walk where money talks and love stutters. Body language of a nation going through changes. The young become dangerous, pain gets spent into anger. Anger gets sent through the chamber. It’s tough when your own look like strangers. We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers. If he could how would ernie barnes paint us. Look at the picture, hard not to blame us. But time forgives and the chi where the young die often. Do they end up in a coffin because we haven’t taught them?. Is it what we talking we really aint walking. Dudes, hustlers pay, how much did it cost ‘em?. Find myself on the same corner that we lost ‘em. Real talking, in they ear like a walkman. Thoughts spin around the corner to the world. When I see them, I see my baby girl. Believe. [john legend]. I believe in the light that shines and will never die. Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive. They will talk about us. Like they talked about the kings before us. They will talk about us. [common]. The lord lives among us. The young uns hunger become a means to get it. By any means necessary, under pressure. Children feeling lesser, with the steel up on the dresser. Killin’ will aggressors, destiny’s children. Survivors, soldiers, in front of buildings they eyes look older. Hard to see blessings in the violent culture. Face against weapons, sirens, holsters. That aint the way that langston hughes wrote us. Soul controllers on the shoulders of moses and noah. We go from being oppressors to oprah. Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas. Today and the way that you can see we determined. Solar keeps burning, shawty’s know to keep learning. Lesson’s in our life, but life stripes that we earning. Took raps advice that christ is returning. Like a thief in the night, I write the beacons of light. For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys. Street kids spark rallies of the conscience conquerors of a contest. That seems beyond us, even through the unseen, I know that god watches. From one king’s dream he was able to barack us. The prophets, nothing can stop us. Believe. [john legend]. I believe in the light that shines and will never die. Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive. They will talk about us. Like they talked about the kings before us. They will talk about us. I know I know I know our dreams won’t turn to dust. They will talk about us. I know I know I know our dreams won’t turn to dust. They will talk about us. I know I know I know our dreams won’t turn to dust. They will talk about us"

I can remember times when for a 40 I had to beg for bucks. Nobody really gave a, so I had to beg for fucks. Now what do niggaz do when they got not food. Skibbidy skap and busta bust a rap. So I pick up the pen and then begin the thoughts to get to pumpin. Hopin like all the people let me talk, let me say somethin. Cause nothin for nothin leaves nothin, I got nuthin to lose. I put, nuttin in my notes, I'm not your host when I got nuttin to use. Dues gettin credited, now I debit my bank account.

I'm the cat, from the alley, from the back, I'ma rally. and tally up points, rollin joints, risin to the tops. Somewhat of a playwright, cause like a stage I got props. My crew's a strange brew, a drink a day'll keep the stink away. We been through AA, but hey, what can I say?. Say say say, what you want, but you'll pay the con-se-quences. Cause Mister Common Sense is (yeah). not gonna take it, so leave you better believe it. Even if your name ain't Ripley, cause Ripley don't know diddley. Hit me one time, two times, for the U-AYYY-C. Heyyyyyy, but anyway. I hit a skid, and I peel out like MC Eiht, damn I kill it. Earn my money the old fashioned way - I steal it. Stop thief in the temple, I hit em with a blow.

Cause Jeffrey where Osborne, and see I'm only human. Doin anything to make a buck, what the fuck I gotta. do what I gotta go (*echoes*)."
just in the nick of rhyme,"The rhyme I pick up, trick up, and like hiccup. (Hiccup!) This is a good place for a stickup. So throw your hands in the air and say hell yeah. I Can Beat Mike Tyson, plus I'm Fresh-er than the Prince of Bel Air. And I Blossom, In Colour is how I'm Living see. some pretend to be afraid of me but they're my Public Ene-ma. Picture this, like a cinema; I'm winnin a contest. I knew you was a loser when you bought your girl's prom dress. I'm just, another one of the nigs, take a swig. I can sing, brothers'll work it out without a gig. The gold mud in my blood, I'm a stud smokin blunts. Not a fuddy dud if rhymes were pecks, I'd be Woody Wood. They're after pestly hoes and that's the hoes I sex and don't collects. Rockin a Rolex, prefer Wrist Ex instead of Solar Flex. but I pump skill, to build what I can build and still feel good. The baddest hoes be sayin, ""Oooh you're real good"". Fella a city dweller, it's poison salmonella. Auntie's name is Stella, style as def/deaf as Helen Keller. Nail a flammer with the Hammer for comin incorrect. not with his grammar or bad mamma jama similar, to Bruce Banner. So don't get me angry, or maybe you won't like me. Kid just in the nick I kick more ass than Bruce Lee's Nike's did. Just in the nick I kick on the geek stick, flick a Bic.

Now I dare ya to try and knock this mic off my shoulder. If I'm sober I won't hold a skunk, but when I'm drunk. I might let her bunk in my bed, heads be sayin I'm a hunk. Like a duck I'm slammin ham MC's MC's I'm servin. Makin the people jump like my man... Julius Erving!!!. Those deserving props are gonna get theirs. Grip, there's something on your lip, oh that's my dick hairs. I'm the biggedy biggedy Bear ya scrub Cub with a demo tape. Tryin to catch me catch your breath before you hyperventilate. for air you gots it, your best bet is to take an aspirin. I bash it, crash it now you know so stop askin.

Peace to Sef and Jeff, Tae ?Deesy Dirty and Don Tanean?. Haste makes waste, so with the case is how my day begins. Hot in quarter vader shops the sports day market pelo. I'm think of my pap, the doctor slapped me in the hostpial with a G-O. Word is bond when I was born, and I took a breath. I never rhyme with busted rhymes and even the blind knew I was def. Respect to Chico ?Waller Al Kadee Roscoe Kalidjusome?. Poo-da, Ba Ba, Luther, the Baby B-Boyz always into some. Time for get me drunk, ?Stu and more my cousin adulay?. Fuck the bitches who dissed us and the hoes who wouldn't give Rash' a. play. I'ma play, and which way, until I get my new props. Peace to Ricki Love the rockin shot to all the beer spots. The marks we used to stick up, the posse gets much thicker. To those who I forgot yo I'ma blame it on the liquor. That's my nigga list, to those who I missed. my ass you can kiss I gotta piss."
soul by the pound,"""Gimme a pound, thank you man"" --> Tim Dog. (repeat 2X, then 4X faster). I'm as bad bad, as Leroy Brown Brown. Yo I'm a pro pro, but not a noun noun. If you got beef beef, then you'll get ground ground. Cut up in soul soul, by the pound pound. I'm going downtown like Julie Brown, I'm the round mound. Not a rebound, but like a hound, I get down down. Never wore a leash but I get loose. Producin somethin fresher than fruits, got more soul than combat boots. Diggin two scoops of raisins for the troops out of some blazers. so amazin like Luther everyday Joe but not Bazooka. I used to be a hooper but now I troop to shoot a free flow. Me go with mi amigo, to see the Man named Chico. The legal alienaeno, I roll the instrumentals. Like Jack I be like Nimble never gentle to a bimbo. Not your sex symbol so save that soft stuff for the Care Bears. The way I freak funk OHHHH the Monkees sayin, ""Hell yeah"". Correction, ""Hell yes""; old folks wanna cuss. on how I walk talk and dress, they say my life's a mess. But I'm straight, are you straight, if you straight, then I'm straight. Rock me tonight, just for old time's sake. Back to our regularly scheduled program, program. I am so damn flam, I slam a slam, BAM, I slam. like Conan the Barbarian, if you talk loud, I'll play librarian. Cause see I want it quiet in here.... I Mark a Markyiana a bunch of funky Uncle Thomases. Play like Christopher Williams cause I gotta keep my promises. to stick to my roots and not dilute cause G this ain't two colors. I'm tired of seein these non rappin dancin motherfuckers. ""Gimme a pound, thank you man"" --> Tim Dog. (repeat 4X). For a record sale a nigga'll sell his soul to go gold. and reach a large scale, sellin for the pale male. and I can't tell, why for a hoe you grow a tail. and stop drinkin ale, the booty probably smell. Ain't no pussy worth a sale at least not for the kid to do a bid. Shit you musta flipped you lid, you was wit you slipped you slid. Got doodoo skids on my paper cause I got rhymes up the ass. If I pass gas, ducks fast or gets trimmed like a mustache. I must ask what's goin on with rap, white kids actin black. It's like McDonald's sellin fatback. Get back to your Mac, that stuff is wack with all these dancetracks. I'm hearin rap from Antrhax, my time the Caravan cracks. You're wack, that's the only thing that's black Scooter. When we was on the streets, you was at home on your computer. I'ma shoot a diss well like a fist to all these wack groups. Rhymes are wack as hell! And they sample wack loops. I'm wonderin how the hell they get a deal I still can't see that far. I feel like Cypress Hill, I could just kill an A&R. or whoever's in Charge, it surely ain't Charles. but you ain't G-in hip-hop, cause it's ours. ""Gimme a pound, thank you man"" --> Tim Dog. (repeat 4X). It's sick you sick I'm sicker, I flick a flea flicker. Think of thatI boa constrictor but the venom I inflicta. is stricter, I stick I stick the stinkin to a stunk. If soda was a forty dog, then I would be like drunk. If if was a fifth I would lift the fifth and a spliff. it's not a myth about our dick width, I'm swift and I shoot the presents. In essence count your blessings I got a Wessun if you riff. I'm a nigga with SOULLLLLLLLLL, my last name should be Smith-sonian. I'm gassin girls heads, just like petroleum. Get em ready to bone me and, then I play custodian. and turn off the lights this is the likes of a. ticketing wallowing high jumping radio rumping brother. Got Seoul like Korea gimme an inch I'll take a liter. A chick is a chick that's how I treat her. never go pop I'm not a two liter. A true leader, don't choose to follow, choose what I swallow. whether water or a beer bottle, of course I play the lotto. Wear em? No, share em? A hoe. I like the girls the girls I share a life with a bro. cause U-A-C is family, much tighter than foundations. that holds up the walls, so you better proceed with caution. ""Gimme a pound, thank you man"". ""Gimme a pound"" (4X)."

I hate it that we, the only race that call our women hoes. Niggaz, be too hard to say ""ho"" at the shows. I rose... like a florist to bring the flavor like a Taurus.

Simple motherfuckers tellin me hard is criminal. Niggaz you thought was hard, you pourin out your liquor for. Years ago, I thought I was hard, in high school fightin.

Yo, just relax, take it easy slow down. I had this, I had this friend of mine. Who just, you know, he was movin too fast, yaknawimsayin?. I told him to slow down, he said the sun don't chill. I said, I said still, I said still, you gotta. Just appreciate life, sit back, don't let it fly right past you. No matter what go on I'm still gettin mine. No matter the year, no matter the place, no matter the time. [Common]. Check it, it's like I'm fightin for freedom, writin for freedom. These record company niggas I don't like when I see em. My ancestors, when I'm writin I see em, and talk wit em. Hopin in the promise land I can walk wit em. Shitted on, so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall wit em. Molest concepts, start rhythm, paid dues, bought wisdom. As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call. Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall. MC's reckless ?I ball? why y'all wanna go and do that?. Must've thought I was solo, the name just ain't the U-Ac. No mo', still together. Like in the ghetto photo wit one nigga in the chair. Holdin liquor in despair, gang signs in the air. I shine in spaces where time is just a glare. Hold the mic like a memory. Niggas say I'm nice wit metaphors but these are similes.

Slip up and rhyme-ass niggas here is fellin you. Crash courses, slow down you can't learn that quick. Cuz I'm the dead eye, wit the red eye, from Chi to L-I. I thought y'all knew, every year I grew, I'm still growin. And in a year or two I hope my girl'll be showin. A male seed, praise God I name him Moses. I lead people I want him to, that's why I chose this. Now is the glass half-full or half-empty. Common, why they tempt me?. The king of the simply, bore in mic. I always stay on top cuz I give niggas what they like. I know y'all hate that why I feel I owe y'all everyday. If y'all hear it a thousand times, it's gon' be the same way. The 'Dat-Father, go farther, why bother. Now I'm a peaceful man, I don't want no stress. You know I'm still.... ""Still gettin mine, in the"" ""ONE"" ""NINE"" ""NINE"" ""NINE"". *sample cut and played in background 3X*. [Common]. Yo yo, some get Range Rovers, some religion change-over. Angel on my main shoulder tellin me remain sober. Token nigga, game's over ain't no payola in freestyle. In battles, I'm warring/Warren like a G-Child. Searchin for the child in me, this style in me. This release is like the piece that's now in me. They tried to 'sassinate me god, like Martin on the bal-cony. Lyrically I put a hit on em, cuz I'm the style-Nitty. Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty. Tryin to get a chick to kick it wit me till the tilt. Told her my Chamber's like Wilt. Built wit her for a sec, let her know I had respect. Less than a hour she was givin me neck, yo I'm still gettin mine.... ""Still gettin mine, in the"" ""ONE"" ""NINE"" ""NINE"" ""NINE"". *sample cut and played in background 4X*."

It was once said by Black Thought that +Things Fall Apart+. Knew I shouldn't have been messin with dude's girl from start. But I pimp from the heart, the art of it made it interestin. Plus me and sister blend before we got intimate. Friend or no friend, my man caught wind. This chick is payin me, it'll either cost me or cost him. Told her she shoulda lost him (when?) a while ago. Cause dude'll drink a pile of Mo' and defile her yo. I ain't here to start on this [nigga] for me to wreck his broad. you could tell what I thought of this [nigga]. Nickname was Smoke, don't know if that was cause of cigarettes. (or what?) or guns he tote, he called shots on the deck. so I wasn't tryin to call his bluff, by his persona. you could see, he think he tough!. If that wasn't enough, old girl had his son. This is Wild like the West I'm like Jesse on the run, uhh. [Jill Scott]. 6 minutes to sunrise. Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (I don't know..). Pressure is mountin.

Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (Do it, do it..). [Common]. I understand that time is runnin out, I'm thinkin of town-skippin. Got a Chevy but the alternator be trippin. I'm hittin rum straight, thinkin of a route to truncate. The streets is watchin, out is one way I put myself in his Nike's. His position is, ""Aight man, somebody bonin my lady"". Probably snap like Rod-man. My plan was to meet at this bar called the Tiki (when?). 'round four, when she was comin she would beep me. I sat deep in the corner, drinkin zombies, becomin one by now. Wonderin if my style would support her and her child. Out the corner of my eye saw this stud I recognized (who?). One of Smoke's guys, to stay out of sight I tried. Told Jill Scott to meet we coulda picked a better spot. On some ""Nobody's Supposed to Be Here"" [shit] like Deborah Cox. Looked at my watch, [shit] I don't even got a watch. Felt for my glock, damnit I don't even got a glock, yo. [Jill Scott]. 4 minutes to sunrise. Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (I don't know..). Pressure is mountin. Oh baby now, how we gon' get through? (I, don't, know). Can't go left and (uh-uh) can't go right and (uh-uh). Don't know, how we made it through the night (c'mon c'mon). 3 minutes to sunrise. Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (Do it, do it..). [Common]. Pressure puh-pressure what? The pressure's cookin. It ain't good lookin, like a black promoter I'm talkin bookin. Not that I'm spooked of dude, I could whup him. But he was on the horn informin the rest of them hoodlums (aight). Usually I wouldn't fight over a woman, old girl had a sun-shine. was messed up, on Smoke's payroll was one-time. My pager went off, it read one line: ""Come get me. from Halsted,"" I'm thinkin this is monkey bar [shit]. Went to the phone quick, called her (what happened?) Her line was busy. Situation number nine, got my mind dizzy. Wondered if this plan was designed to get me. I've been drinkin too strong to be thinkin too long. Like 40 goin North I'm doin 50, headed for the spot. Askin God to be with me, and lately. she has been actin shifty -- (but what?). But then it hit me (hit me) it hit me (hit me). It hit me (hit me) it hit me. [Jill Scott]. 2 minutes to sunrise. Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (I don't know..). Pressure is mountin. Oh baby now, how we gonna get through? (Yo -- I said I, don't, know). Can't go left and (uh-uh) can't go right and (nope). Don't know, how we made it through the night (yo, we got). 1 minute to sunrise. Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (one-one, one.. ha?). 1 minute.. (we got, we got) one, one. 1 minute..

a film called (pimp),"[Common talking]. Yea,Yea,Yea. You know, they call me a pimp, and you know what that mean. I'm a Person that's Making Profit. See I pimp internationally. I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted. I pimp with the truth, that's the only method. [Common]. Seen her on Madison where Vice Lords be Travelin. And Chevy windows be rattlin. and badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts. Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched. Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig. Asked her the name, one way to approach her. See she had game, she needed me to coach her. Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture. The way a righteous pimp is supposed to. [MC Lyte]. As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune. I ain't having it like abortion. Walking with this stick holding his tip. Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp. It was cold as shit, I'm waitin on my ride. Act like I didn't see him I tried. [Common]. Motion denied (pause). I felt the vibe like Roy Ayers. She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators. Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure. That's in tuned with nature, hold Common's hand. I'm a take you to a pimps promise land. Where no man can break ya, break ya, break ya. Chorus: Bilal (singing). Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers,. customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god. Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers,. customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god. [Common]. {hey girl, come on over here, check it out). Make your next move your best move, choose me. [MC Lyte]. How I look working for a nigga in a cuffe'. If I was on a track you couldn't produce me. With them shits on your wrist looking goofy. [Common]. (yea ok). I pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel. You been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level. You used to the same game, cats saying the same thang. Nigga you gone ho underground or ho mainstream. [MC Lyte]. Nigga you must not know of me. I'm the mack here. Ought to have you ho for me (Common: get real now). Pimp yo punk ass. Have you write me poetry. I'm from a land called cash. You too slow for me. [Common]. You know why?. I'm thinking bigger than Bagets. Birds in slick cars. Or have you on the corner trickin in strip bars. If you become mine the world would be ours. Respect the game, and universal laws. [MC Lyte]. What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall. (Common: try it). Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball. I know pimpin ain't easy but damn you barely surviving. We can't ride together cause you ain't driving. (Common: oh it's like that). Chorus. [Common]. (this, this, this really how I look at it check it). You and I together is like Ashford and Simpson. Picture us elbow to elbow at the hustler's convention. [MC Lyte]. Think I'm gone risk my ass then give you the cash (Common: yep). That shit is the past. I got my own stable (Common: where at). I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track. Matter of fact I been looking for a ho that's abstract. [Common]. Girl you getting beside yourself. I'm trying to guide you. Help you see inside yourself. I pimp with vision, I'm a help you see the light. Have you covering your body and have you eating right. [MC Lyte]. (is that right). I'm pimp ho's, pimp pens, (Common: Say what). Pimp rhythms, pimp flows,. Pimp men (Common: and pimp what). Pimp systems. Got stores called big pimpin (Common: Where). Down South. In Texas I ran the best ho house. [Common]. (So). I pimp from Brazil to um, Tokyo. Have Japanese broads sayin 'choushi wa dou' (MC Lyte: Yea right). Bring'em back to the states to turn dates from Europe. Made the dirtiest of hoes seem purer. [MC Lyte]. (HA ha ha ha ha ha ha ha). (Common: Why you laughin). I'm laughin cause you funny. I'm make bitch niggaz like you have my money. I get six hundred off yo skinny ass weekly. You'll get all the right tolls in that dashiki. [Common]. Yo, what ever happened to loyalty. Don't you want to become royalty. On the streets selling ass and oils for me. But you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you. Fuckyou then I'm about to be a preacher. [Common talking and Bilal Singing Background]. Well there you have it ya'll. The story of pimps and hoes ya'll know how it goes. It's been the oldest profession. The whole thing is like a lesson. Ain't no second guessin. Pimps ya'll, hustlers. All that good shit. Yea, yea 2000 and forever. It'll be here. Uh, uh aiight cool."

Figure it out, the mic, I'm rippin it like a ligament. Gimme a light a Bud Light, and shit'll get lit just like a cigarette. I'm a b-boy so don't test me, many rappers don't impress me. You try steppin into my city I'll, Snipe em like Wesley. So you best be on your way, I'm doper than Marion Berry, hey. Wake up everyday and make-up rhymes but I'm not Mary Kay.

I can remember times when for a 40 I had to beg for bucks. Nobody really gave a, so I had to beg for fucks. Now what do niggaz do when they got not food. Skibbidy skap and busta bust a rap. So I pick up the pen and then begin the thoughts to get to pumpin. Hopin like all the people let me talk, let me say somethin. Cause nothin for nothin leaves nothin, I got nuthin to lose. I put, nuttin in my notes, I'm not your host when I got nuttin to use. Dues gettin credited, now I debit my bank account.

Den dere's de man who don't stop. Yo Com, come back with some Sense, UHH. [Common]. Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, here I come, here I come (what?). A-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, here I come, here I come (yeah!). I'm comin around the mountain high as lower than a valley. I'm the cat, from the alley, from the back, I'ma rally. and tally up points, rollin joints, risin to the tops. Somewhat of a playwright, cause like a stage I got props. My crew's a strange brew, a drink a day'll keep the stink away. We been through AA, but hey, what can I say?. Say say say, what you want, but you'll pay the con-se-quences. Cause Mister Common Sense is (yeah). not gonna take it, so leave you better believe it. Even if your name ain't Ripley, cause Ripley don't know diddley. Hit me one time, two times, for the U-AYYY-C. Heyyyyyy, but anyway. I hit a skid, and I peel out like MC Eiht, damn I kill it. Earn my money the old fashioned way - I steal it. Stop thief in the temple, I hit em with a blow. Somebody done stole my beeper but I'ma steal the show. I'm throwin a Heidi Hoe into a bro and tellin her. go for what you know bruh, the people before me go under. Yo we gotta gotta get we gotta get we gotta get. Gotta get, gotta gotta gotta get get over. Somewhere over the rainbow, I'm still the same old same old. Ringin around the collar, borrowin a dollar, check my balls. Dirty drawers, see the kitty suckin titties. Video watchin lush from the city. I'm the extra-terrestrial rappers go home cause they have to. Them marks be callin Ork, come in Ork, Nanu Nanu. The perfect stranger, comin in to a, fuck a new land. Cause Jeffrey where Osborne, and see I'm only human. Doin anything to make a buck, what the fuck I gotta. do what I gotta go (*echoes*)."
a song for assata,"(Common). In the Spirit of God.. In the Spirit of the Ancestors.. In the Spirit of the Black Panthers.. In the Spirit of Assata Shakur.. We make this movement towards freedom. for all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle.. Yeah. yo, check it-. There were lights and sirens, gunshots firin. Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent. Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle. Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh. No room to rest, pain consumed each breath. Shot twice wit her hands up. Police questioned but shot before she answered. One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his. Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her. Comprehension she was beyond, tryna hold on. to life. She thought she'd live with no arm. that's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight. They moved her room to room-she could tell by the light. Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin it bit. Put guns to her head, every word she got hit. ""Who shot the trooper?"" they asked her. Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her. Her mind raced till things got still. Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed. She got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next. Hurt mixed wit anger-survival was a reflex. They lied and denied visits from her lawyer. But she was buildin as they tried to destroy her. If it wasn't for this german nurse they woulda served her worse. I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse. I wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?. All this shit so we could be free, so dig it, y'all.. (Cee-lo vocals). I'm thinkin' of Assata, yes.. Listen to my Love, Assata, yes.. Your Power and Pride is beautiful.. May God bless your Soul.. (Common). It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her. Walkie-talkies cracklin, I see 'em when they takin her. Though she kinda knew,. What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue. Arrived to Middlesex Prison about six inna morning. Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in. a cell, one cot, no window, facing hell.. Put in the basement of a prison wit all males. And the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes. She'd exercise, (paint?,) and begin to read. Two years inna hole. Her soul grew weak. Away from people so long she forgot how to speak. She discovered frredom is a unspoken sound. And a wall is a wall and can be broken down. Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with. One of the brothers she had a child with. The foulness they would feed her, hopin she's lose her seed. Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed. In need of a doctor, from her stomach she's bleed. Out of this situation a girl was conceived. Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution. And lactated to attack hate. Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate. Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates. They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick. And said she robbed places that didn't exist. In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites. Through dark halls of hate she carried the light. I wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?. All of this shit so we could be free.. Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?. All of this shit so we could be free, so dig it, people-. (Cee-Lo). I'm thinkin' of Assata, yeah.. Listen to my Love, Assata, yeah.. Your Power and Pride, so Beautiful.... May God bless your Soul.. Oooh.. (Common). Yo. From North Carolina her grandmother would bring. news that she had had a dream. Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean. What made them real was the action in between. She dreamt that Assata was free in they old house in Queens. The fact that they always came true was the thing. Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldna done. Medical evidence shown she couldna shot the gun. It's time for her to see the sun from the other side. Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side. Time for this Beautiful Woman to become soft again. Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when. She untangled the chains and escaped the pain. How she broke out of prison I could never explain. And even to this day they try to get to her. but she's free with political asylum in Cuba.. (Cee-Lo vocals). I'm thinkin' of Assata, yeah.. Listen to my Love, Assata, yeah.. We're molded from the same mud, Assata.. We share the same Blood, Assata, yeah.. Your Power and Pride, so Beautiful.... May God bless your Soul.. Your Power and Pride, so Beautiful.... May God bless your Soul.. Oooh.. (Assata). Freedom! You askin me about freedom. Askin me about freedom?. I'll be honest with you. I know a whole more about what freedom isn't. than about what it is, cause I've never been free.. I can only share my vision with you of the future, about what freedom is.. Uhh, the way I see it, freedom is-- is the right to grow, is the right to. blossom.. Freedom is -is the right to be yourself, to be who you are,. to be who you wanna be, to do what you wanna do. (fade out)."
all night long,"[Common (with Badu singing in background)]. Yeah.. wanna feel the vi-ah-hi-hibe. Wanna feel the vibe, wanna feel the vi-ibe!. Uhhh.. wanna, what? Yeah. Wanna, what? Uhh, yeah (come on). Every-bod', c'mon, uhh. Yo, yo.. (all night long). [Common]. Durin divine hours, I use mind power to refine. flour/flower girls, and make em feel like black pearls. Get they minds off acryllic nails and the rap world. It's a lot you can find in the lost black girl. Made signs built in lodges, we be in garages. Discussin who we boned and who God is. Pro-black like Craig Hodges with my dashikis in the cleaners. I kick it for the Chevy ridin head to backstreet leaners. [Erykah Badu (with Common)]. Allllll.. (uhh) niiiiiight.. (yea yea, what?)

(let me get a piece Bee) niiiiiight... [Common]. Check it, check it. I was born underwater with three dollars and a cocktail. Tryin to make the Garden of Eden, out of Auckdale and Rockwell. Lock'd in this Grid like a Tupac tale. While her-on rock smells make the cops tail. My third eye is my rail, on this L of thought. With afrocentric stamps I'm mailin thoughts. to my Gods held in court. I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk. I try to Walk Like an Egyptian, but Hieroglyphics fail to talk. I guess the hustlin is the unspoken Gospel. Love that I'm an apostle, feel the holy spirit of Chicago. E Bottom, here's the bottle. I think I, need a cup of a tea, because I'm novel. (come on bay-bayyy) Bust it. [Erykah Badu]. Iahhhhh jus' wanna rock you. Alllllll night looooong. Allllllll (come on bay-bayyy). All night long.. all night long...

The brain-wash, with my vocal tones I rinses. Opportunity and the beat knocks. Women, give me rhythm like beatbox, but it's the year. of completion, I want a Queen to complete Rash'. who's flavored from stacks, to Reeboks. Send blessings to the family of Ice Mike. Shit like that, don't help me write right, but I got site/sight. like a destruction worker, when it's time to build. Get off like Sam Jack' and it's +Time to Kill+. In perseverence I'ma find a meal, and provoke. My Gramps used to trick off big papers at the Riverboat. It go... [Erykah Badu (with Common)]. Allllll.. niiiiiight.. all night.

On and on and on and onnnn. [Common]. Check it. I walk downtown to tempos and never lose the beat. Some people got ignorance confused with bein street. on the, street of desire my body and soul meet. Arguin over thick broads and meals with no meat. Had the cold feet for a second. Mega-niggaz in my box throwin suggestions. Had me checkin myself and double checkin, I popped the +Resurrection+. In the mirror I only heard my reflection. Let me hold mics, while you hold dicks and CD collections. And at MusicLand and Coop's, we can make connections. I meditate with confidence, to not chomp on cents. Outspoken like 30's but yet I guard my lips. Writin niggaz with stripes, I hold posture with. Poppin shit to fat broads, wearin os-trich. Givin em voicemail, tracks are like County. To them I voice-jail/gel, if you believe in Heaven. why is the choice Hell? Why is this choice Hell?. Why is this choice Hell?. [Erykah Badu].

Heyyy, heyyy, what can you say."
any given sunday,"[Guru]. Though the times are getting wicked I'm older. I got a chip on my shoulder. True players always maintaing, I'm different I told ya. Don't want to be just a commodity. I'm smarter G. This is my life, and my soul not just a job to me. It's the truest part of me. Fans now mobbing me. Fake friends acting like I just won the lottery. Back then I guess it was hard to see. The real paradox. What an artist see. It's like that saying. Be careful what you pray for you might get it. Of course it's all about winning and money but how far will we let it. Taken 'em, the holy game can make 'em, then instantaneously break 'em. Rain one day sunshine the next. Haters try and stop my flow sometimes I'm vexed. What's next accounted by the press. Mad stress on my chest. Of course I know that I'm blessed but here's the test. On ""Any Given Sunday"" I got to play my best. Chorus:. Sacrifice don't give up the fight,. everything will be all right on any given Sunday. Guru: The harder they come the hard, yeah the harder they must fall. Depends on you if you win or lose,. you know you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday. Guru: Strive to achieve and die for what you believe. [Jamie Foxx]. On the battlefields left abandoned. One man standing. To me the ball was handed. Taken shots and left stranded,. No defensive they tackle me. Every blow brings back a memory. Learning lessons from my injury. It's killing me. Cause at first they wasn't feeling me. Never given a chance to show my true ability. Too many pressures trying to play me out. Put me positions that's sure to lay me out. No doubt. Chorus:. Sacrifice don't give up the fight,. everything will be all right on any given Sunday. Guru: The harder they come the hard, yeah the harder they must fall. Depends on you if you win or lose,. you know you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday. Guru: Strive to achieve and die in for what you believe. [Common]. Playing on a field of hard times. These struggles are like the yardlines that I gain from. Nowhere is where I came from. From day one, I knew the game and how to play run. But never knew the price of fame would weigh tons. Now I learn from self when pain comes. And walk when they say run. Fame can be as painful as. Death of patron. Young black, gifted. But I'm rapped in myself. Broke many tackles but I'm trapped in myself. See what happens with wealth. At times you can lose yourself. During the sunniest of days many superstars fell. From cotton to football fields. You know how they play brothers. As long as we play well they love us. I know that on Any Given Sunday. This can be taken from me. But it all comes down to is money. I know that on Any Given Sunday. This can be taken from me. But it all comes down to is money y'all. Chorus: (2x). Sacrifice don't give up the fight,. everything will be all right on Any Given Sunday. Guru: The harder they come the hard, yeah the harder they must fall. Depends on you if you win or lose,. you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday. Guru: Strive to achieve and die for what you believe"
aquarius,"[Common]. Yeah!. Yeah!. [Common]. Nigga deep in the rhythm, experience speak. Some keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek. I seeking it with em, i'm dope the streets need me to hit em. With some of that (revolutionary rap). Revolutionary blunted rap. My peoples want hits, I hit it from the back. Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes. My guise pack heat enough to bury June, on my feet. Im getting married soon, walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune. Fumes of a real nigga seep into your room. Or through fifthteens of the your jeep that you boom. Son so many cats, they call me high noon. Offerings to Osun hoping war is over soon. Guard your grill like George Foreman. Time to build, as far as building im the doorman, opening doors. My blood I expose on the floors, tell them the game aint only the score. Hold on to your life as I carry these styles. To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles. You aint supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line. In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed. Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds. Mixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine. In the age of aquaruis.... [Chorus]. [Singing]. The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba). To purify the world (du-ba ba ba). Flying through the night (du ba-ba ba ba). So watch out here he comes (du-du ba ba ba). Aquarius! [echoes]. [Common]. Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks. With raps, all over your head like Tweet. Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth. Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt. Same spot where it's joyous, where the pain is felt. As you build and destroy yo remain yourself. They say im slept on, now im bucking in dreams. And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme. Or the struggle of feinds, I flow over water thats as troubled as teens. For the love of the team, trying to double the dream. Be greatful like the chruch psalm my grandmother sings. Im rubbing my rings across the domes of clones. Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems. While you and your dogs foam at the mouth. Thinking rap is the only way out. The black human genius will never play out. I take you way out, where you never been before. Been it since birth, sent to replish the Eatrh. That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse. I deaded your shit before you finished a verse. From niggas to gods from bitches to earths. From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse. Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse. Holla back, but listen first. We in the age of aquarius.... [Chorus x2]. Aquarius! [x2]."
be,"I want to be as free as the spirits of those who left. I'm talking Malcom, Coltrane, my man Yusef. Through death through conception. New breath and resurrection. For moms, new steps in her direction. In the right way. Told inside is where the fight lay. And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say. Chicago nights stay, stay on the mind. But I write many lives and lay on these lines. Wave the signs of the times. Many say the grind's on the mind. Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wonderin' where I'm. Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized. We got arms but won't reach for the skies. Waiting for the Lord to rise. I look into my daughter's eyes. And realize that I'ma learn through her. The Messiah, might even return through her. If I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her. Furs and a Benz, gramps wantin 'em. Demons and old friends, pops they hauntin' him. The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun. When drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones. Walk like warriors, we were never told to run. Explored the world to return to where my soul begun. Never looking back or too far in front of me. The present is a gift. and I just wanna BE. . . Carol"
"between me, you and liberation","Verse 1 (Common). She rested her head upon my chest. Since liberation in between breaths. Wonder if sex is what she found it in. Peace, found it layin down with men. Wasn't there to judge her,in many ways I loved her. It was more than bodies we shared with each other. We laid under the cover of friends. A place where many lovers begin. I began, to feel her body shake in my hand. Body language, it's so hard tryin to understand. Usually after sex, it's a good feel. Took by silence, emotions stood still. You could feel her tears spill, from her grill. Hurt from before that beginning to build. She told me hold me, stories she assemblin. Tellin it, tryin not to remember it. It was a story of innocence taken. Thought she could redeem, through love makin. When she was 8 she was raped by her father. And tried to escape through multiple sex partners. Felt pitiful she had only learned. To love through the physical, inside it burned. A hard t?, I thought of what this man did. She forgave him, she grew to understand it. Her soul was tied and never really rested. Only knew men through aggression. Said it was a blessin and it happened for a reason by speakin it. She found freedom. Between me and you, between me and you, (repeat). Chorus (Cee-Lo). Sometimes I wish I, ?. S? her, without speaking a word. Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid of no longer. I feel so ?, you helped liberate me, me, me (repeat). Verse 2 (Common). As she laid I watched her breathe. Happy to be here, not affraid to leave. I couldn't concieve her not being here. Death in her face, her not having fear. Less than a year she was diagnosed with it. Memories of that year, so close and vivid. Happiness would only visit, once in a while. To watch an adult, becomin a child. Somehow, I knew she'd make it. The life of one, so early would God take it?. Heard she placed it hope and care. Heard she placed in chemo and lost hair. I stared with my eyes closed. I wondered when the body leaves does the mind go. Watchin Jordan became less important. Seein this disease eat away my aunt's organs. Accordin to doctor's there is no cure. We went through doubt, and cases of insure. Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs. Knew a part of her I could heal with words. But the creator was ?ful. What seemed like the end was the beginning for her. Like that, she didn't want us to remember her. No more medication did she want us to give to her. It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath. Only to be freed through death, between me and you, (repeat). Chorus (Cee-Lo). Verse 3 (Common). He spoke with his eyes tear filled. A lump in his throat as fear build. My whole life it was instilled. This ain't the way that men feel. A feelin he said he wish he could kill. A feelin not even time could heal. This is how real life's supposed to be?. For it to happen to someone close to me?. So far we've come, for him to tell me. As he did, insecurity held me. I felt like he failed me. 'Till his spirit yelled help me. I've known him for like what seemed forever. About goin pro we dreamed together. Never knew it would turn out like this. For so long he tried to fight this. Now there was no way for him to ignore it. His parents found out, and hated him for it. How could I judge him?. Had to accept him if I truely loved him. No longer he said had he hated himself. Through sexuality he liberated himself. Between me and you, between me and you (repeat). Chorus (Cee-Lo). (Through emotion). (Peace). ."
black america again (feat. stevie wonder),"Black America Again (Feat. Stevie Wonder). [Intro]. *Alton Sterling Incident*. [Verse: Common]. Here we go, here, here we go again. Trayvon'll never get to be an older man. Black children, they childhood stole from them. Robbed of our names and our language, stole again. Who stole the soul from black folk?. Same man that stole the lamb from cheap black smoke. And made the whip crackle on our back slow. And made us go through the back door. And rap for black bodies on the slave blocks. Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots. Leaving our own to lay in a box. Black mother's stomachs stay in a knot. We kill each other, it's part of the plot. I wish the hating will stop (war). And the battle with us. I know that black lives matter and they matter to us. These are the things we gotta discuss. The new plantation, mass incarceration. Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids. As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is. Is it a felony or a misdemeanor. Maria Sharapova making more than Serena. It took Viola Davis to say this. The rose of the help and the gangsters. is really all they gave us. We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Corey Bookers. The salt of the Earth to get us off of sugar. And greasy foods, I don't believe the news. Or radio, stereotypes we refuse. Brainwashed in the cycle to spin. We write our own story, black America again. [Sample: James Brown]. You know, you know, you know. One way of solving a lot of problems we got. is to let a person feel like somebody. and a man can't get himself together. until he knows who he is. and be proud of what and who he is. and where he come from, and where he come from. [Outro: Stevie Wonder]. We are rewriting the black American story. We are rewriting the black American story. We are rewriting the black American story. We are rewriting the black American story"
black maybe,"[Hook]. Can't come around. They gon' wanna bring you down. No one knows just what's inside. Doing dope and doing time. Why they messing with your mind. Black maybe.... [Common]. I heard a white man's yes. Is a black maybe. I was delivered in this world. As a crack baby. Hard for me to pay attention. And I act crazy. Gotta get over from the tip. I watch the fat lady sing a song. On how we guerillas in warfare. And I'm the kingest kong. They say we dreamin wrong. Them same strips that them older cats lingered on. Now the walgreens is gone. Hope is killed fiends are born. We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable. Its hard to turn on the hood that made you. To leave We afraid to the same streets that raised you. Can aid you. What other black births came suit. the rage up in harlem and the southside. Brothers is starving with there mouth wide open. Floating across state got the workout plans so they can move weight. The fate of the black man, woman, and child maybe. [Hook] - 2X. Can't come around. They gon' wanna bring you down. No one knows just what's inside. Doing dope and doing time. Why they messing with your mind. Black maybe.... [Common]. He had game since he used to hoop at chattum. Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him. The stones had his back and they'd pat him. He was living a life they couldn't fathom. Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships. Even if he went they knew he'd leave college quick. For the pros the one from the hood that was chose. The black rose that grew in the jungle. But humble stud still had rumble in his blood. Women all around giving him trouble love. You know the love when you up they down. Cause you wrap a ball they round. Your win is their crown. Dudes in the circle he known for years. Shared beers and cheers but chose different careers. when paper and fame came they ain't know how to react. Them same studs shot him in the back. Now that's black...maybe. [Hook] - 2X. Can't come around. They gon' wanna bring you down. No one knows just what's inside. Doing dope and doing time. Why they messing with your mind. Black maybe.... [Common - talking]. When we talk about black maybe. We talk about situations. Of people of color and because you are that color. You endure obstacles and opposition. And not all the time from...from other nationalities. Sometimes it come from your own kind. Or maybe even your own mind. You get judged..you get laughed at..you get looked at wrong. You get sighted for not being strong. The struggle of just being you. The struggle of just being us..black maybe. Black maybe.... [Hook]. Can't come around. They gon' wanna bring you down. No one knows just what's inside. Doing dope and doing time. Why they messing with your mind. Black maybe..."
blows to the temple,"Check it. We can go, toe to toe, with the blows to the temple (NOT). Not the Temple of Doom, so make room. for the Unamerican Caravan (who you down with?). The B-Boys, Immenslope, Twilite Tone, Derrick and then some. I don't get rid of some faces. while marks be lookin hard, and they be beggin bases. They have too many cases, and now they got courage.

blue sky,"Intro:. Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us (x4). (Listen) Why you had to hide away for (x4). [Common]. Aston Martin king, Luther with dreams. The young Denzel the way I move through scenes. I’m like a preacher that once was a fiend. A story of change that came with wings. Pretty as the skyline, the sky is my eyeline. Son of the most so from up high I shine. Suited in Prada, stay mellow like lala. Young, fresh, with dollars, ladies go gaga. I’m the cum-lada, top of the class. Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash. Given what I ask, pure religion and cash. From the windows that open, I’m raising my glass. Daylight beams, night life schemes. This is my inception, I’m writing my dreams. Immortal view of a star doing what I’m born to do. I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through. [Chorus: Makeba]. Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light. Ohh, until high we'll shine at night. Now we in the skies, blue skies. And we going higher, that's right. [Common]. It all started with a dream, I wanted to be Run–D.M.C. The Lord put the blessing upon the MC. O to the M, dreams were spoken to him. That's when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim. Open my eyes, yes sir this is what I'm made for. To go hard in the paint like D. Wade or. D. Rose, from the same streets that we rose. International heroes at world primos. Red carpet magic, taking pictures with the president. Told him for health care, my music is the medicine. My name holds weight, I am never hesitant. Different state resident, this is hood elegance. SLS classic, pursuing my passion. NOVA Fashion, now I'm Oscar party crashing. Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do. I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through. [Chorus]. [Common]. Silhouettes of dreams that we had high, huh. Even now it don't seem so bad ma. Close my eyes to see things in front of me. I'm gone now, imagine what I'm gonna be. Dirty to worthy, now I'm all wordy. My broad up in Paris, looking all purty. Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do. I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through. [Chorus]. [Makeba]. I had these dreams in my head of an endless fear. I could see it from my window. Wouldn't take that long to get me there. Keep running til' I can go. Remember the beautiful things that life could give me. Crazy how I'm the one. Could've been any way, but I'm sitting in the air. With the wheels up staring at the sun. Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light. Ohh, until high we'll shine at night. Now we in the skies, blue skies. And we going higher, that's right"
book of life,"I got so much trouble on my mind. So I take time. Out my day. To pray and I say. Now I lay me down to sleep. Hopin' that I keep. My soul. Peep, I'm gettin' old. And it's a cold cold world. And I ain't even got a bomber. Livin' with my momma. It's the same routine. Keep my room clean. I'm lookin' to do some new things but ain't shit to do. I'm twenty-two - catch. In the prime of my life. I have no time for a wife. I funnel through the tunnel. Disgruntled, tryin' to find me some light. In the rim of darkness. Aiight you sing, I may not be the darkest. Brotha. But I was always told to act my age and not my color. Knowin' that my color was that of the original. So now I sing the new negro spiritual. It goes get up stand up...etc.. It's like how can you understand the pain. When you never had to stand under the rain. When it rains it pours, and it's about to come down hard. Thank God I found you. As I walk down the road of existence. I get resistance. From all angles. I tangle. For cash. Hopin' it'll last. 'Til the end of the week. But all I eat is fast food. And you know how junk food goes right through ya. So I return to the arab. And on the way back. I stop and the liquor store. Grab me a six pack. Knowin' that once I'm done with that I'll be back. To get some more. Once I get started I don't wanna stop. And I can't turn around. Brew - I can't turn it down. Ironically I turn it up. My liver I burn it up (Fat line). It's my life I live it up. The cup I gotta give it up. One day. I'm cruisin' down a one way street and I done passed fun day. Three blocks ago. It itself life is an obstacle. As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible. I want a job but I ain't lookin - how come. I ain't tryin' to degrade myself bein' nobody's Calvin. But I'm a couch bum what makes it bad I had incentive. But I disintegrated. To a state that's stagnated. I procrastinated. I can't recall a day without bein' intoxicated. or blowed. Ain't dealin' with a full deck and any day I could fold. What makes it bad, I wasn't dealt that bad a hand. And I had a plan. But things didn't go through. The way they were supposed to. Thank God I found you. It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder. How I keep from goin' under, I ponder. And try to keep my concentration. In this idiotic nation. They say become I doctor, but I don't have the patients/patience. Adjacent. To that situation. I want an occupation. That I'm into. 'Cause yet if I begin to. Live to my potential. I went to. School for fourteen years and my best teacher was experience. I reminisce and wish. I could go back in time to eighty-nine. When there was just sunshine. But now it's like I'm gettin' older to so much strain and stress. I don't think I'll ever be happpy until I rest. In peace. Of mind. And find. Who I am. But thank God I found you."

chi-city,"[Chorus: repeat 4x]. And ya say Chi-City. (Kanye West) We don't stop, naw, we don't quit. [Verse 1]. I rap with the passion of Christ, nigga cross me. Took it out of space and niggaz thought they lost me. I'm back like a chiroprac' with b-boy survival rap. It ain't ninety-fo' yo we can't go back. The game need a makeover. My man retired, I'ma takeover. Tell these halftime niggaz break's over. I'm raw, hustlas get your baking soda. Too many rape the culture. Leave rappers with careers and they faith over. It's a war goin' on, you can't fake bein' a soldier. In the basement, listening to tapes of Ultra-. Magnetic, to the fact the messiah is black. I'll turn the TV down, we can take it higher than that. I wonder if these whack niggaz realize they whack. And they the reason that my people say they tired of rap. Inspired by black Muslims and Christians. Pushin' cutlasses, dope, and other traditions. In the conditions of the city, the city. The city, the city, the city, the city. Come on. [Chorus] (4x). [Verse 2]. A black figure...in the middle of chaos and gunfire. So many raps about rims, surprised niggaz ain't become tires. On the street you turn cold and then go screech. I tell 'em ""fuck 'em"" like I do to police. The beast is runnin' rampant. I'm in between sheets tryin' to have sex that's tantric. For the ghetto, tryin' to make a get-up stand-up anthem. You spit hot garbage son of Sanford. What you rappin' for to get fame or get rich?. I slap a nigga like you, and tell him ""Rick James bitch!"". With your Hollywood stories, on porches. We polly hood stories about who became rich. And whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch. You didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch. I'm forever puttin' words together. Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons. The name Com' has never been involved wit' run. Unless its DMC, or runnin' these broads to bein' free. I'm harder than the times, you hardly scary. Hopin' God's inside you, God is Halle Barry. They ask me where hip-hop is goin', it's Chicagoan. Poetry's in motion like a picture now showin'. It's the city, the city y'all, the city. Uh, the city y'all, come on. [Chorus] (7x) [while Kanye West sings]. And ya say Chi-City. (scratched together) Common Sense, from the city of wind"

These studs mention me, uhh uhh uhh uhh. As a, intense MC, sent to be the reign. on the industry I came. With penitentiary talk, Coke and a Hennesey walk. My imagery talks, metaphors and similes stalk. Time for war, my artillery caulks the hardest nigga. I'm killin 'em soft. Dealin with golf, gettin blowed on the course. I be dissin magazines, but then buy The Source. Can't explain why the force, is with me. Known to bring a rapper down - like Bobby did Whitney. Sophisticated sissies strut like this is Beat Street in backpacks. Braggin how they don't eat meat and abstract. I backsmack em with they skateboard, flee the crime scene. with a rhyme scheme to escape frauds. Make broads become queens, run things like a rasta sprinter. The way you want the game I rub off like Henner. I remain like a tattoo with natural raps. Copy like a fax that's y'all actual facts. Battle raps is where it began, I'ma end it wherever I land. I done thought of, a master plan, it goes. C to the, cold-blooded (yeah, c'mon). cold-blooded, (ya know) hard-core.

communism,"Intro:. Yo Troy I'ma come on the rhythm. with a little bit of Communism. Yeah, hah. So check it out, yeah. Chick-a chick-a I'm. Chick-a chick-a on. Chick-a chick-a my. my, own shit. Like an entrepeneur, that stepped in maneur. man I'm newer than a Jack I went up the hill with Jill. And Jack chills big bootay. But then the booty up, I told the bitch she better have my money. Or step to the AMG. You know Com Sense, oh yeah him be. That nigga that be making all the bid-by-by-bye sounds. But since then, Common calm down!. I'm on some calm shit watch Com get complicated. Simple motherfuckers say the way that Com communicated. was too complex, I got a complex not to complain. on my brain no complain and so will my community. And I prefer compliments. So I complement at an angle, of ninety degrees. It's the ninties, and music got known for grease. I got a sense of direction and a compass. Come past MC's with compassion, though I heard the screams of. But I ain't shy, so why shall I comfort. Commiserate at the fort with Jeff I'm so ill. But I chilled in my compartment with no company and no meals. Now Com can get the panty, but I want my own company. And Com is on a mission not to work for commission. It's a common market and it's so much competition. but to me, competition is none. To my comp I'm a ton I get amped like Watts in a riot. my compact disc is a commodity, so buy it. Instead of competing with Pete. Com compromised, Com made a promise. Not to commercialize, but compound the soul. without the elements, compelling sense into Communism."
diamonds (feat. big sean),"(Oh) Walk up in the thing, got my campaign poppin'. Champagne poppin', bad thing poppin'. Headed to the door, and ain't a damn thing knockin' (no). Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin'. Campaign poppin', champagne poppin'. I wrote this on my born day, it was a warm day. Niggas gotta eat, we gon' do it gourmet. I'm hearing fuckin' voices, like when porn play. Stay, stay on your grind like foreplay. What more can I say? Diamonds are for the day. That means to shine, you find a way. Stayed on porches, backyards, and gainways. Learned strange ways between [?] and Langley. Champagne ambitions. I pour it out for my man who made his transition. Was about paper, pussy, Prada, ego. Born to fly, call me the bald eagle. Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though. Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin. The hero that came from zero. My bars and my Pr like Puerto Rico. This bra from the Dr said I was frío. that's Ice Cold like Dre, triple three yo. Pino noir style, better with time. I'm gambling with watches getting better with time. So I'mma ride this out for long as God allow me. They say ""time is money"", forever is my salary. I shine tomorrow with what I do today. Yo, get this money, put the diamonds on display. (Oh) Walk up in the thing, got my campaign poppin'. Champagne poppin', bad thing poppin'. Headed to the door, and ain't a damn thing knockin' (no). Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin'. Campaign poppin', champagne poppin'. Hit you with the street sweeper. now you gotta get to moppin' (no). Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay. Tryna get it every way, every day. Tryna get it every way, every day. Tryna get it every way, every day. Bars in alignment, stars in alignment. [?] of consignment, God's in the diamonds. Evolve from the science, power and refinement. Read between the lines, hard to define us. Niggas that's behind us, throwing up signs to signify us. In the benz leaning like we biased. I seen lead fly by us, that shit scary. You can go cold and blow everything you have in a flash. The moment is to live it like your last. Moments that we have never living in the last. My time, man, precious like diamonds. Look through the glass, see what I magnify man. I'mma be shining 'til I die man. I'mma rare diamond that's hard to find man. Climbing to the mountain top, Mlk day. To the streets I speak my piece like an A. K. 47 to 87 to the hundreds. Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted. Dreams reflect clarity, ain't no disparity. Between peace and prosperity, so marry me diamond. Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway. I'm rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day. Way before the ballin' that was back off in the training days. I used to hit the barber chair and say ""I need that fadeaway"". Had a crush on what's her name, the feelings never fade away. Older brother gang bang, banging like an 808. Said you can't take his chain away. Real play you can't take his game away. Slang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller. But you can't take my dame away, devil in a red dress. But she got that angel face. I could teach her how to get it day to day to day to day. The G code is my combination. Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces. Catch me in court, beating all kinds of cases. Weed, money, pussy, liquor, that's my favorite combination. Diamonds"
don't come my way,"(featuring Slick Rick). [Common]. Yeah yeah. You know, Slick, why do he wanna come crib. Acting like he know how the brothers live?. We have to let 'em know. We have to let 'em know. Heeeeere we go. Behold a pair of white horses on the Death Wish course. Been watching MTV, reading articles in The Source. Lost on the other side of the river. Where death approaches the livest nigga. I wonder why this wigga. Would even come around my tilt. With grandmothers cry, uncles get high, and cats get pealed. My guys will deal with him, he got no rhythm. So let the steel hit him, we speaking jail diction. Hoe work and day oppression. Turn up the bass and let the system thump. So my neighbors won't hear the sparks as the lead gets pumped. Its a pre-(?) agreement in the cement jungle. Kill each other over money and white boys for fun. [Female Singer]. Don't come my way. Hawks feel the day. Things don't change, oh no. Don't you come my way. Come my way. See the day, oh no. [Slick Rick]. Little family so a junky living act as. Started smoking crack to fill the void within my black ass. 1999, rolling as some broke cat. These white kids asking questions. about where to buy some coke at. Kinda shock a dude, Ruler turn a sucker to. Show 'em where these cats at, maybe earn a rock or two. Retarded, not knowing the kid hardest trife. Kill 'em, asswipes, I'll have a new start in my life. Till the drug lord knock upon their (?). Disprespected, ""Washed up rapper, what the fuck you want?"". The often asked, I could see others laugh. I got my man he wanna a buy a half a ki off your ass. Scolding 'em, sleeping and sold on 'em. Gimme the cash,. let me flash it through this peephole on 'em (Check it out). He got hyped quick, pursued in the tight crib. Emptied on their asses, including the white kids. [Female Singer]. Don't come my way. Hawks feel the day. Things don't change, oh no. Don't you come my way. Come my way. See the day, oh no. [Common]. Yo, How'd dude go cop a brick when he ain't got the loot. Ricky D, get the heat and 'Treat 'Em Like a Prostitute"". This wigga gots no heart from his Iowa start. [Slick Rick]. And a Section 8 cat, he don't want any part. I put two in there, ruin their, pursuing their souvenir. Nigga, what the fuck is that white behind DOING here?. Won't you say you wanted to slug 'em. ""If your not here for the cable or the (?) ya BUGGIN"". [Common]. Lights flooded the scene, there was blood and si-reens. (sirens). The cops shot the brother, I still hear him scream. Black mans reality, white mans bad dream. Familiar scene from the Ickeys to the Brady Green. Its pissy hallways, broke elevators always (ya know). Ain't no place for our children to play. I try to go out in the summer and be feeling the day. These broke and stupid niggas, yo they still in the way. [Slick Rick]. One of the mightiest slang, and plus the night is young. I got long term money draining ideas from. Since they far, I'll find your brown sweetheart. Just being white your like golden goose around these parts. Hey retard, better hurry in, my name is Father Marion. I'll hold that American Express card your carrying. Put your nose up, don't, shut up, provoking and woke up. First where do you live, how much money your folks got?. [Female Singer]. Don't come my way. Hawks feel the day. Things don't change, oh no. Don't you come my way. Come my way. See the day, oh no. Don't come my way. Hawks feel the day. Things don't change, oh no. Don't you come my way. Come my way. See the day, oh no. [Common]. We let the rhythm go. Common Sense will 'em hit where I hit 'em. Common Sense will spin 'em check it out. I guess I did 'em where they should to be done. Ain't nothing new about the wonder rap son. Closed styles like captions yo its time for some action. Man, I get bread, niggas get me sled. When I come up off their head, it was said. For that, yo, it's like this. Common Sense'll strike this, mic this. Just like some punchlines. How niggas follow me like one time. Everybody love me like the sunshine. Combine, ain't that you never knew of. Niggas say one but I've got two loves. Check it out, now how I do love...."
dooinit,"Ah keep on, chcka chcka chcka (Repeat 6x). Mo'fucker move back, I pursue rap at the pace of a New Jack. Miscellaneous numbers and shoes stack grooves. Rap I deliver for the hungry and underprivileged. Something different from these hollow and grunting niggas. This is business strictly, step to my business is risky. 'Specially when you as bitch as Missy. Back to back LP's that sound the same, I surround the game. With a four-pounded brainstorm. To make niggas dance in the rain, scared to take a chance in the game. Used to breakdance, it's a shame. What money do to a nigga brain. If he lose his soul what did a nigga gain?. ""Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it"". ""C O double M O to the N"" (cut and scratched 4x). My train of thought is that of a hustler, or a nigga with his shirt off. Trying to get his work off to customers. I rap with a chip on my shoulder, squeezing Coronas. See shirts that say ""We gotta get over"". That juggy shit is over, the war is on. I on;y want to be a soldier, I'm holding on, to a culture. Focused like Gordon Parks when it's sorta dark. For niggas that's flooded with ice, my thought's the ark. Performing warming arts with some shit for the heart. Don't fuck with radio, ignoring the charts. I could give a FUCK what you made in a year, nigga, you wack. A soft nigga on a hard track, in this new rap. Generation I ""X"" cats like a Muslim. He fell off cause I pushed him. Let his Bently and his weak crew be his cushion. I catch him on the streets, in front of the bodyguards and rush him. ""Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it"". ""C O double M O to the N"" (cut and scratched 4x). You wasn't saying you was a thug before Pac came. Ten years ago you had a high top trying to be like Kane. Then Snoop released and it became a G thang. Claim sets, your city ain't got gangs. Niggas hate you, they ain't paying you no attention. In a circle of faggots, your name is mentioned. With six degrees, I separate MC's, from a business man that's good. >From a nigga that was raised or just lived in the hood. >From what a nigga says to what's understood. Keep my shit tight like them boys in ""The Wood"". Dick is always hard like the ""Boyz in the Hood"". Peace to Dug Inf, No I, Sean Lett, the whole Chi. At the crib some cats give me the cold eye. I'm a bitch slap the next one. Let him know the world is my section for taking. You got to reduce aggression. ""Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it"". ""C O double M O to the N"" (cut and scratched 4x)."
drivin' me wild (feat. lily allen),"It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down. It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down. It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down. Love's not a mystery, it's everything. She was the type to watch Oprah and The Today Show. Be on the treadmill, uh, like Ok Go. Had the body, un body. That you can't pay for. That means she had some D's on her. But they wadn't fake though. Had a drive, a Drive for Rodeo. She spent pesos on those Lebos. Spent class at the gym, Striptease on the pole. She was so obsessed with her body and clothes. To every party she goes, trying hard to be chose. They say it's hard for a pimp. But extra hard for these hoes. Reading Us or People mag, tryna get these scoops. Chasing an actor for a Bentley Coupe. She recruit a ball player from the Clippers. Then came the pumps off. Thinking she Number One. When she just a Jump Off. Doing all she can for a man and a baby. Driving herself crazy like the astronaut lady. It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down. It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down. It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down. Love's not a mystery, it's everything. He had paper since we was in. We was in High School. Pop was a doc, mom taught at my school. Lock with the rocks, in his ear he kept jewels. One of the Diddy types, the d-d-d-Dame Dash dudes. Pushed the Maserati Sport, reading the Robb Report. Wanted to be Mike, but he was never live in sports. Since golf was in, he was in the driving course. To live the rap life is what he was striving for. Spending cash at the bar to get credit. Drinking Chandon just because Big said. They say Ye is, but dude big-headed. Rocked the fur in the summer, so, somebody'll pet it. He had a fetish for shoes that's athletic. Pathetic on his myspace page, half naked. It's a shame what they do for fame, and to be respected. Joe you coulda got it. If you never woulda stressed it. It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down. It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down. It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down. Love's not a mystery, it's everything. They was one of them couples. People said they was the it. Unbreakable like Bobby & Whit. Or Ryan and Reese, or Kimora and Russ. Relationships can be dead but look live to us. I guess we all been through it, where we try too much. Losing yourself and your line and stuff. Wishing for the diamond cuffs, searching for the ring. Where love is not a thing, it's everything, sing. It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down. It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down. It's this thing now. That's driving me wild. I gotta see what's up. Before it gets me down. Love's not a mystery, it's everything. Gets me down, gets me down, gets me down. Gets me down, gets me down, gets me…. Love's not a mystery, it's everything"
electric wire hustler flower,"feat. Sonny (P.O.D.)). [Common]. Yo!. [Chorus (x8)]. Electric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!. [Common]. Blood and magic dripping from me. True thugs and addicts I grip an entry. Enter this game with tricks and envy. I forget game to remain an emcee. Rooms in this mind that's still empty, only fufilled through prophecy. You stoppin me, you see I'm tryin to catch this plane. You must be slow nigga, catch your brain. It's fresh, but it is some stress and pain. Got hos?, Ho nigga respect the game. I talked to cab drivers about the fast lane. And Islam, masters and shakras? and beyond. Think about the hustle and somehow I see by. But what led it to the concrete, BS be strong. You was at your hardest when you didn't even try. Live like a bitch, to bitch you gonna die. [Chorus (x4)]. Electric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!. [Common]. Mercury and retrograde, I'm trying to get niggas in the ghetto paid. While they watch pornos and Escalades, away from floats and the dope in sex. parades. Somebody screamin in my mind, I'm tryin to find if it's me. Or voices on the master, they desgin to be free. Same revolt, can't be found on TV, or radio, its livin in me. Hey lady, that smoke is bothering me. If I put it in your eye, ashes you would cry. All this rap talk is blowing my high. I just came to chill and build with my guy. I try to walk but I stumble off the humble path. This story of a pimp stick that became a staff. You got it, you gotta know where to aim the Mag. Art and oppinions are made to clash. [Chorus (x4)]. Electric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!. [Common]. Out of body hard to explain, like the pyramids and gods I remain. I know pain, like Kurt Cobain, or A.I. playin hurt the whole game. Dig it to the Earth's brain for worst gain. Focused like young blood on his first chain. I used to write shit to please niggas. Now I write shit to freeze niggas. Whether iced out, or American Pie sliced out. I sit in the room with the lights out. Whether diced out, or with their hair spliced out. I sit alone in the room with the lights out screamin. [Chorus (x8)]. Electric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!."
everywhere,"Chorus:. How did you know I've been waiting for this time to come. And though it tastes like forever. it may not stay long. Everywhere is summer (x4). A shaman since before my birth. And I came down to rock the Earth. My mission condition. I give you you listen. I'm syncing in time in parallel. In binary no 3rd return. I'm planning intention. With all the redemption. Chorus. How did you know I've been waiting for this time to come. And though it tastes like forever. it may not stay long. Everywhere is summer (x4). Common. No pop no pop no pop no pop. We gon do this thang till the sky just drop. Lock in to ya mind away we rock. In a rocket is the 87th astronaut. Top of the soul dove and I got in a hole. At the moment they were sayin. It was outta control. Strap in to your mind. Rhyme season with climb. Youll see in time your season to shine. When the stadium is dark. MCs are defined. Get ready, on your mark put your feet on the line. The race is on to space beyond. You gon get there by doin what you want. Sometimes the most famous feel all alone. So we drift to a place that we call our home. I was known as being spaced and outta my dome. now I know its all Ive known. Chorus. How did you know I've been waiting for this time to come. And though it tastes like forever. it may not stay long. Everywhere is summer (x4)"
faithful,"[sample] Faithful to thee. [Common] We got to be. [sample] Faithful to thee. [Common] I want to be. [sample] Faithful to thee. [Common] Yes, its for the people, God moves, yeah. [Verse 1]. I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred. What if God was a her?. Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her?. In what type of ways would I want her?. Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?. Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly. If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?. The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex. Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check. Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck. Her I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'. Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die. Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her. Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship her. Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful. To be in her presence I try to stay faithful. [Chorus]. [sample] Faithful to thee. [sample] Faithful to thee. [sample] Faithful to thee. [sample] I'd like to be her very best friend. [Verse 2]. He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend. Even if they don't try some ladies test men. And this was a test that was bigger than him. Some believe its the nature that is given to men. He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home. One reason or another couldn't find peace at home. She asked, ""Why do men always have to stray?"". He said, ""I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet"". ""I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'. Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'"". It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say. And what you did in the past you gotta live with today. She asked if they could spend the night together. He thought, and said, ""I'm tryin' to get my life together"". Went home to his lady, these were his confessions. ""Baby you a blessin' and my best friend"". [Chorus]. [Bilal with his voice overlapping] Faithful to thee. [Bilal] Faithful to thee. [John Legend singing]. [John Legend & Bilal] I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be so faithful. [John Legend & Bilal] I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be so faithful. [Repeat 3x]. [Bilal] So. [Bilal] So. [Bilal] So. [John Legend] So. [John Legend] So. [John Legend] So. [John Legend & Bilal] So faithful. [Bilal] So. [Bilal] So. [Bilal] So. [John Legend] So. [John Legend] So. [John Legend & Bilal] That's what I'm gonna do. [John Legend] Faithful to the end. [John Legend] That's what I'm gonna do. [John Legend] Faithful to the end. [John Legend] That's what I'm gonna do. [John Legend] Faithful to the end. [John Legend] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. . . Carol =)"

food for funk,"Common:. What, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Yo, yo yo yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Check it, yo. You say a one for the trouble, two for the time. Come on y'all, let's rock that, uh. (I can feel the funk)(x4). Check it. I come to grips with mics. I come to grips that a lot of mic users is dikes. I come to grips with the likes of Fred Hampton. Cold, so I'm lampin, with no need for spotlight. When I got light like an intersection, you talk. But you came to my town with protection. Election year, had the block hot. I scream ""fuck the world"" for having a baby girl sorta cock block. I write rhymes like I come from the windy city. With my crew, I click like simply, stand midi with reality. Casually, I walk through these war games. Some claim say but then they take on whore names. If that's the way your sex drives, stay in your lane. If you're a man, I can't tell like if the door rang now. Chorus:. Now, to the ladies in the house when you come in the place. It ain't a bunch of niggaz all up in your face. The music is thumpin and you're feelin the bass. What you wanna do girl(wanna shout). To the brothas when you come in a jam, it ain't a bunch of niggaz. It ain't high tech and ain't got free liquor. You jackin his name and stick to make you jones get thicker. What you wanna do man?(let go). Yo, check it. Some niggaz be on the mic, sounding like dikes. Allow me to get on and bust like Spike(uh). Lee, I'm in the majors with no rotation. Through stations of bullshit, I see through like a pager. In the age of Aquarius, various things. Is gonna carry us in intellect and what have you. Street astrologists interpret point stars and half moons. Then end up on garages or walls in bathrooms. Every black moon, a rap tune move me. The rap sun, I rain more than Rudy, that unruly shit is played. It don't stop. It's time to get it, get it made. I got my mind made up like Foxy Brown's face. I know how the underground tastes. I want a crib from the ground up, rooms spin at a round pace. Get down based on true story, through Corey, came close to the teachers. Colder as the Iceman, posted before it start wrinklin. Linkin with cats, who don't react to change in the years. Fulfill prophesies in rooms full of emptiness, now. Chorus:. I can feel the funk(x8). Yo, check it, check it. I came through the corridor, with the aura. Raw Chicago mora, scope the horror. Read between the lines and know the border. Some pop wines for juice, I wait in the water. Waitin for you Big Willie niggaz to have a show at The Crib. We gon get with your glamour, long as we know where it is. Tell you ain't a player by your sweater doused with wack feather. The Crib got the gangsta playa shit patent like black leather. I rap better than you, you, or maybe him. But I am like a tree and every lyric is a timb. Spilled brews and greasy foods got my car smelly. Some be so high, they believe they fly like R. Kelly. But then they fall off, dusted niggaz is gettin sawed off. They fall soft, my mental lift is for me to haul off. I kick ass. Chorus:. (scratching). I can feel the funk(x16)(makes me wanna shout, wanna shout)(x4). (scratching)Wanna shout."
forever begins,"[Verse 1]. Victory won. in a world of Henessey and guns. too young for the marches. but I remember these drums. to start reality. wars and battles. we fought for ours. caught in ghetto tragedy. I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee. and recognize the importance of family. hand me the joint. good music and room to breathe. those that doubt. Com' will soon believe. can't judge the weave. my lady had one. I'm more like a fool. for soul and passion. the price of gas rises. street life is pumpin' fast. lives is. I'm watch crash. and realize that we all survivors. no religion or race. whatever describe us. My guys do dirt do dirt. but never really talk about it. Forever begins. just because I thought about it. [Chorus]:. Living. Once Again. We. Living. Then you go (x4). [Verse 2]. Ashes and snowfalls. I wonder when the roll call for heaven gon' come. forever gon come. It's a cold world. and I can never go numb. look. fear in the eyes. say I never gon run. sooner or later. I know the cheddar gon' come. for now I write the world letters. to better the young. On tree by jury. together we hung. Now we let our chains hang. and gang bang to maintain. (f)ghanastan goin' through the same thing. It trickles down. at each other we aim pain. I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars. Through the while I learned to earn hard. Wach gangstas turn God into Mr. War. no matter how much I eleveate,. I kiss the floor. It was in the ?? when she said Dilla was gone. That's when I knew we'd live forever. through song. [Chorus] x2. Living. Once Again. We. Living. Then you go (x4). [Outro]. Origin. Is forever. well, well well,. we are back in the studio again. look at that. hey I don' need no cue cards. they got the engineers holdin up the cue cards. What that say. Oh they say, just talk, don't sing. son, i bet you and I feeel like you and I've been here forever. 30 years old red eyes,. beholding red eyes. I see my world's tears. Yeah, origin is forever. every peak will have 2 values. hopeful eyes in the comfort. of true protection and admiration of the chime. that's forever. forever is to strive. a place of endearmnet. forever is what I leave. my I-self contribution. Damn, what I gon' leave?. Ok.... I leave my one and only grain of spiritual sand. to universal scales of humanity, all humanity. forvorever is finding a solution to a solution. tsunamis, huirricanes,. following the trails of the African slave ships. war, war, and more war. Floods, Columbine, Global Warming, Earthquakes. Another somebody done me wrong, son. Virginia Tech, there's not a hole but to Heck. we're still, did you place your one grain. of spiritual sand forever?. confusion need a solution. Blend and stir, stir and blend. the part of humanity; sift the ingredients. of acknowledgement, apology, amendment, atone. we gonna work with the four A's here. forever part. Common good is forever. God's memory is forever"
funky for you,"Chorus: Bilal, Jill Scott. Alright.....Okay [4X']. Alright......We'll make it funky for you now. [Common]. I'm a child of the ahh - The 87 ahh. From the streets - Get on a beat and go ahh. I could break it down like whatever ya ahh. On some K-R-S be here forever type unh. You-you-you-you know you shouldn't rhyme like unh. Let them pussy niggas get in your mind like unh. Baby boy you could do it take your time do it..... If you get the chance. To be a man in a b-boy stance and advanced from the go. I'll trace outer space with a unh. The baby-sitter of styles - I've traveled miles with. bitches and....I've traveled miles with...... I've traveled miles with bitches and brew the ritual. of the real unh. Your platinum but real unh's don't feel you. You sampled real unh's and then filtered. I'm built to last - at last I'm free. The Roots and SV be the family tree. SV and the Roots be the family tree. The Roots and SV and the tree is unh. Come on. Chorus;. As long as it's funky....alright..okay [yeah]. As long as it's funky...alright. As long as it's funky...alright...okay. As long as it's funky...funky for you now. I style for the ohhh - wild for the ohhh. Baby girl let's go half on a child for the ohhh. Lick shot's pop lock and blaow for the oohh. Like Ra-I'll move a crowd for the ohhh. You talkin' loud but ain't sayin' ohhh. Trickin' paper on a unh... Captain Save-a-ohhh. I've never been.. the type of nigga... to take.. a broad to the courts. As a shorty I was always into sports. Now I talk to drums and walk in slums and thoughts that's ohhh. Instinct to hustle-divided by the struggle. Plus a couple of scuffle's and up to high shuffle. Even when it sound muffled... I bust through.. narrow gates... with king-sized thoughts that's sparrow shaped. Before I came up I had to elevate. Let a nigga move where he wanna move up to. You don't like how I'm livin... well fuck ohhh. I stuck to what I was on... a star is born on a cusp. Many angel's fell to the dust. Leavin' me to trust... only a ohhh. Leavin' me to trust y'all only a ohhh. Leavin' me to trust in a - ahh ohhh ohhh ohhh. ohhh. Yo. Chorus: repeat 4X. As long as it's funky [yeah]. alright..okay. Let your.. imagination.. dance to the... Dance to the.. dance to the hey. Like nobody's watchin in a b-boy stance to the hey. I'm funky like Africans in France to the hey. Yo hey.. kick in the bass you... Chasin paper like a bitch in a race. Spit on or death, I still ain't picked up the ace. The hundred.. styles I run with thick in the race. So let's ohhh.. yeah unh hunh. Chorus."
g.o.d,"Common:. After bein' 25, you know, just trying to survive in the world. Bout to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows?. Anyway, just when you start gettin that little age and experience to you. You start thinkin about stuff...tryin to make the right moves. So bust it out, this is what I was thinkin, check it. Yo, the education of the Lon-chicka-Lonnie Lynn. Began, began with time. Bein my bloodline is one with the divine. In time brotha, you will discover the light. Some say that God is Black and the Devil's White. Well, the Devil is wrong and God is what's right. I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear. The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear. As a child, given religion with no answer to why. Just told believe in Jesus cuz for me he did die. Curiosity killed the catechism. Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to. And became a slave to master self. A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health. My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons. Koran and the Bible, to me they all vital. And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys. You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief. But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em. And use religion as an emblem. When it should be a natural way of life. Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right. That's who got you doin right and got you this far. Whether you say ""in Jesus name"" or Hum do Allah. Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you. You let that show towards others in the things you do. Cuz when the trumpets blowin, 24 elders surround the throne. Only 144,000 gon get home. Only 144,000 gon get home. Only 144,000 gon get it baby. Chorus Cee-Lo:. I've lived and I've learned. I have taken and I've earned. I have laughed, I've cried. I have failed and I have tried. Sunshine, pouring rain. found joy through all my pain. I just wanna be happy with being me. Cee-Lo:. Let me voice my concern. So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title. That their actions didn't earn. Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence. Subconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince. I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place. Cuz it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know. Who you are in the first place. So I try to find the clue in you. But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do. Why're we bein' lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden. Damn, somethin' in me wanna know who I am. So I began my search, my journey started in church. It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief. Hustlin was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets. Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with. And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school. It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only. Science and math are universal. Takin elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran. Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites. Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White. Some leads were granted with insight. and it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand. He still created with the imperfection of man. So, with followin' I disagree. By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but. I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind. That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas. You gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity. But one side you gonna have to choose. Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse. So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession. become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and. Can't follow your lesson. If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown. If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own. If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own. If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own. Well, I've lived and I've learned. I've taken and I've earned. I have laughed, I have cried. I failed and I have tried. Sunshine, pourin rain. I found joy through my pain. Just wanna be happy...bein me. Bein me."

Layin in some heaven, need a little company. Let's go into a heaven, time to get some Geto Heaven. Geto.... [Verse 1]. Searchin for a love, throughout the ghetto. Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow. I got my third, eye on the sparrow. Want my peoples straight and rock sweet apparrel. The mother of my child, we not together. Baby it's your back, I got forever. As the weather, talks to us. Him rockin the Holy Spirit walks through us. The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide. A thug is a lost man in disguise. The rise and fall, of a nation, even when the buildings tumble. I still stand tall, I walk through the valley, wit a life preserver. Feelin at times, that I might just murder. Yo but that aint what I was sent for. I want folks to say his life it meant more. Than any car, any rock, or any broad. He found Geto Heaven in himself and God. [D'Angelo]. Geto Heaven.... Standin in some Geto Heaven. Geto Heaven.... Standin in some Geto Heaven. Geto.... [Verse 2]. Love, your happiness don't begin wit a man. Strong woman, why should you depend on a man. I understand you want a man that's resourceful. If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you. Talkin to a friend, about what love is. Her man didn't love her, cuz he didn't love his. Hugged her from afar, said what I felt. You never find a man, till you find yourself. Time helps mistakes, you can learn from. Cuz one man fucked up men you shouldn't turn from. You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too. At the destination, a king will annoint you. Goin through the storm, many bodies stay warm. That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more. Than anything you could cop in a store. For you to grow he had to go so what you stoppin him for. Not even I could ignore bein alone it's hard. Find heaven in yourself and God. [D'Angelo]. I know I love my baby. My baby loves me. I'm layin in some heaven, need a little company, yeah.

This music is so much bigger than me. As far as happy, yo it's like a trigger to me. Dealin with crab rappers, and groupie broads. Record execs, at times it do be hard. But to choose words, and be heard across waters. Doin something you like to support daughters. Keepin your guys who collectin court orders. Conveyin messages that the ancestors brought us. Thought of things to say to become the end thing for the day. Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it. Music is a gift that is sacred. I hope you didn't use it hopin you could grow to it. Whether servin or a surgeon, you gon go through it. Can't imagine goin through it, without soul music. It's like Donnie ?half? helped me see Lonnie's ?fath?. On my behalf, let's take whole steps to a ?ho tep?. And show depth, as we make people nod. Find heaven in this music and God. Find heaven in this music and God. Find heaven in this music and God.

gettin' down at the amphitheater,"""Ga-ga-gangbusters!!"". [Dove]. Hey give it Boogie like the BX, sex regular booger bitches. get the backseat, G-bumps'll make you buy tapes. Ex-cape the fire tonight, switch like Jekyll and Hyde. and shit, wreckin we live and shit. This swamp water style'll keep em dirty and wet. I bet mills on the rhyme skills, we walk away set. Rich like topsoil, connect coin with currency. Places that I couldn't pronounce, and then bounce. Illegal ain't illegal if it's less than an ounce. Keep it come in T. La Rock amounts, see +It's Yours+. Study scrolls that includes the clause. Get your dirty paws out my bowl, your hustle's too old to deal. with the shuffle, you exhaust me like a muffle. Get zapped and zipped in the duffle. Came to the set splashed, no Roley on the wrist. To Hell with a guest list, we all up in this!. A two dollar somethin got your eyes on him. But yo she pinchin my ass so we go, limb for limb. Lights studio dim, it's EXACT tonight. So we can drop the Rap Delight, on one!. Just dance, you know you gots the feelin. Just dance, ah come on and get down. and just dance, you know you gots the feelin. Just dance, ah come on and get down. and just dance, you know you gots the feelin. Just dance, ah come on and get down. and just dance, you know you gots the feelin. Just dance, ah come on and get down. ""Just get on down.."". [Common]. Underground under pressure, my style is the child. of a lesser, God, I Master like Farad. Persona in between the El Rook'n, and El DeBarge. Metaphorically massage, verbal hajj. I take over breaks and chop loops. Glorifyin, one-eighty hat cats can rock in my troops. Wisdom like a tooth, mock new shits I knock loose. Datin game Thursday's I spot juice, Plug like Pos'nus. Before you get a style, let's get a style. My style pans the crowd back and forth. You were soft as the tracks you rappin off, I pop shit. You tried to laugh it off, actin like you had to cough. and didn't hear it, my spirit sustains in the same pattern. emcee, familiar sample period; spottin where you sampled. your rhyme scheme from -- I ain't clearin it. I drop science and experiment -- contractually. came to terms of endearment with my label. Want to pick out a day to smack wack niggaz, I contact niggaz. like P.O.'s, you spit background lyrics, I rip Lee flows. Wipin your nose like you need blows. Claimin it's a allergy, I react allergic to cats. or is it how they word it. If you had weight it must have been some pussy you served with. Thoughts fermented, I rode rhythms and words tinted. Many lip profess, I'm verb centered. Just dance, you know you gots the feelin. Just dance, ah come on and get down. and just dance, you know you gots the feelin. Just dance, ah come on and get down. and just dance, you know you gots the feelin. Just dance, ah come on and get down. and just dance, you know you gots the feelin. Just dance, ah come on and get down. ""Just get on down.."". [Pos]. It's like rip y'all, add it on to lip. Wonder Why's upon this, just to flex my strength. I was the one who killed wackness so I had to do a bid. of twelve years on the mic, before parole with Tommy 'Kid'. Infinite landscaper, green paper maker. Leap far from home with chrome rims and trims. Man these people still takin rappin for a joke. The pimp, I rock it one-double-oh percent. Some of you MC's should be called CM's, Carbon Monoxide. on the mic exposin your polluted bloodtype. Y'all niggaz need a visit from the Brain Fairy. Walk around dead, like your physical's buried. Wrote the rhymes durin a earthquake, cause your style's. shaky as SHIT! Just need to come clean and admit. that yo' quick draw fails the test, and mine was flawless. My DJ gave the scratch, yours was clawless. Your crew couldn't even measure to mine. That's why yo' bitches is busted, and mines is fine. Performin with an upper design, so back on off the plank.

ghetto dreams (feat. nas),"Ghetto dreams. Ghetto ghetto dreams. Ghetto niggas' dreams. From the hood. [Common]. I want a bitch that look good and cook good. Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood. Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes. Plus she tricking from the dough that her man makes. We got our own handshake, her titties ain't fake. Fucking in the car cause we just can't wait. To get home, early in the morn' getting stoned. Pretty with her eyes low, running by Bible. The type of bitch that Big said he would die for. Is the type that I would rather stay alive for. Tats on her back, looking all tribal. She know shoes like she know survival. Well put together, she weathers the storm. Seen her brother die so forever she's strong. Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform. Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on. Ghetto dreams. Ghetto ghetto dreams. Ghetto niggas' dreams. From the hood. [Common]. I don't even say shit, she can feel it. I toss the realest, toenails acrylic. Ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it. Baby in one arm, the other is a skillet. Fried chicken, macaroni, raised on the back of Stony. Ghetto press, she's my Apolloni[a]. Like trigger had the back of Tony, Montana. Reminded me a me of my, of my mama. Knowing the drama like she know when to joke. Steal a nigga's squares, not wanting me to smoke. I poke my head out of Benzes. Streets that I know who my friends is. In this love for the money, power and clothes. A ghetto housewife watch reality shows. She might get to snapping when the cabinets ain't closed. When the cameras start snapping, she's ready to pose. Ghetto dreams. Ghetto ghetto dreams. Ghetto niggas' dreams. From the hood. [Nas]. I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes. Subject matter be changing too quickly at times. So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story. Call me a pro in the pussy category. Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention. For me, getting women turned from sport to addiction. Powerful women playing the roles of submission. Lawyers on leashes, congress, women inflictin'. Pain onto my game wanted and I'm sadistic. They liked it, they dyked it, devices twisted. 'til I get a nice chick, to get me on some nice shit. Crib raising kids, Labrador behind the white fence. But I'm still single, looking for Cleopatra. African Queen, yo look at me, I'm a bachelor. Y'all niggas in trouble, keep your girls behind closed doors. Cross your fingers, be happy I haven't chose yours. She love glamour, bought her Vera Wang sandals. Valentino bags is my etiquette my man is. Half hood half class, photographers' cameras. Caught us out there, the spotlight, hope she can handle this. She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit. Events having sponsored have some alcohol product. Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms. You live your dream with me when you are just in the projects. Ghetto dreams. Ghetto ghetto dreams. Ghetto niggas' dreams. From the hood"
gladiator,"Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. [Chorus]. Nothing you can do (4X). [Intro]. They say he's a radical, he don't fit the game. A heart full of glory and a fist of pain. A couple of battle scars but shit's the same. Are you not entertained. So all the onlookers and the bystanders. Wait til intermission, run buy your camera. Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum. And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium. [Verse 1]. I was told by a wise old to come from the heart. Though I might've did The Light, I don't run from the dark. The dark knight to spark mics, and start fights. The warrior archetype like Kimbo Slice. It's strength in the beard, am I loved or feared. A beast amongst boys like Paul I'm revered. Vroof, vroof vroof vroof vroof Vroof vroof well. Like Jacob Jewel, I keep clientele. You frail on the mic like you might break a nail. I might smoke a joint but I won't take the L. I knew a fat girl who broke the scale. Still touched down cause I was off Artell. Had dreams of breaking Mike Vick out of jail. Took the underground rail to the end that failed. I rebel, NYSL. Here to leave a trail like Nelson Mandela. [Chorus]. [Common]. My words is the sword, my skill is the shield. My life is the style I stay dressed to kill. A legend like Will Smith with the steel. I could save the world when shit get for real. Skinny George Foreman, all in your grill. My rhyme style is blind, it's all in the feel. Touch it and watch the blood fall with the steel. The weak raps you wrote you could call that your will. My drive VROOM is how I stay the livest. Your guys got you gassed, my flow is a hybrid. Crashed I survived it, gashes over eyelids. You easy to take out cause you hot garbage. I'm amped like wattage, the truth nigga honest. Any moment opponents drop out like college. Kneel and pay homage to the rap Ziggy Stardust. Stadium hands in the air fists balled up. [Chorus]. [Common]. Feet in the dirt, blood on the shirt. Scars over bars, symbols of the work. Tight clothes the armor, center of the drama. Defeat your whole army like this is Sparta. So don't violate or you'll get violated. Some of you model bitches is so overrated. Don't mean to underrate it but damn it I made it. In the water I waded on the corner I painted. Draw blood like we related. MCs get de-decapitated. Syncopated is the style that I fight with, write with. Mr. Excitement, change your face up like a white chick. Then light shit up like a dread with the herbs. Get sex in the city and head in the burbs. These are the words of a radical. The crowd applaud, I'm bowed, I'm proud. To be the gladiator. [Chorus]"
glory (feat. john legend),"One day when the glory comes. It will be ours, it will be ours. One day when the war is won. We will be sure, we will be sure. Oh glory. Hands to the heavens, no man, no weapon. Formed against, yes glory is destined. Every day women and men become legends. Sins that go against our skin become blessings. The movement is a rhythm to us. Freedom is like religion to us. Justice is juxtapositionin' us. Justice for all just ain't specific enough. One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us. Truant livin' livin' in us, resistance is us. That's why rosa sat on the bus. That's why we walk through ferguson with our hands up. When it go down we woman and man up. They say, stay down and we stand up. Shots, we on the grown, the camera panned up. King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up. One day when the glory comes. It will be ours, it will be ours. Oh glory. Now the war is not over, victory isn't won. And we'll fight on to the finish, and when it's all done. We'll cry glory, oh glory. We'll cry glory, oh glory. Selma's now for every man, woman and child. Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd. They marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now. Never look back, we done gone hundreds of miles. From dark roads he rose, to become a hero. Facin' the league of justice, his power was the people. Enemy is lethal, a king became regal. Saw the face of jim crow under a bald eagle. No one can win the war individually. It takes the wisdom of the elders. And young people's energy. Welcome to the story we call victory. The comin' of my Lord, my eyes have seen the glory. One day when the glory comes. It will be ours, it will be ours. Oh glory"

I appear in clouds on some heaven to earth shit. Fake niggaz drown the deeper the verse gets. Deep as a skinny girl's cunt - I surface with the purpose. to let y'all niggaz know the demo. Voice is a instrument that's monumental. You couldn't fuck with the style if you was a nympho. Raised in the temple of Chi, taught to look into the eye. I identify with dobbs and weaves, and niggaz makin moves. that bob and weave, and niggaz with jobs on the side sell weed. I feed off the hunger that a bum or abandoned child gets. freaky, like Marv Albert, in outfits, by Chaka Givens. I lecture how I got God but don't got religion. Got a clip for these niggaz on the net, sellin my shit. Let's just say you Ramone and I'm Spit. In a habitat of Cadillacs and battle raps. and people that travel at the speed of need. Never agree with the ways of the world. Cats say anything - like they say to they girl. How you bringin it when you sit indian style?. Niggaz know me as Com it's time hear me go wild. with HOT SHIT, yeah... HOT SHIT, yeah, one two... Came to bring it boy. (You say you got guns, then bring that shit.

Old men see visions young men dream dreams. I rock the planet - recognize - I'm the C.R.E.A.M.. Com Rules Everything and everything is. How yo' man pullin yo' weight - he ain't carryin his. Scary the biz is like ""The Blair Witch Project"". Experiment in rooms on some bare bitch project. State senators, life twirls, most sell out. - like a dread with a white girl. You want me to cypher with you and the Gods?. I just did a show - I'm pursuin these broads. Everyone I ain't tryin to fuck. Wanna feel female presence and conversation a touch. You'll get split like a date that's dutch scuffed and scraped up. Taped up for tryin to say what - ever you was about to say. You rap like a nigga that's about to spray. Get a mouth shot, for openin your mouth to say. feel my heat in the night - it leaves you without the day. What I write is a passage for niggaz to travel through. Before defeatin me - Joe, you better battle you. I tap into my own zone like it's my home phone. Turn the cell off and let my dome roam. Shame I gotta do white labels to keep my life stable. I write fatal bringin niggaz to life. A wise man came in the thick of the night. He said BRING THAT SHIT when you pick up the mic. I said, ""What shit?"". He said HOT SHIT, hot shit, hot shit. (You say you got guns, then bring that shit) uhhh. (You say you got ones, then bring that shit. cause you need a lot more ones and guns for this) uhh.

Much disrespect goes out to you. And your parents, too, for havin you. Haven't you been introduced to a douche. I guess you said fuck footloose, and got pussyloose. No juice, you shoulda dried up, like a prune-a. Mister mechanic this place needs a tune up. For the pink cadillac cause it's block is off. And have more use, than a public park. for recreation, givin up the body is a hobby. I'm tellin Santa Claus you been naughty (sing it). Hoe hoe hoe, Merry Christmas. Aiyyo JuJu, I just had to diss dis. [Chorus]. Heidi Heidi Hoe, huh, the Heidi Hoe. All the niggaz know, yo the Heidi Hoe, c'mon. The Heidi Hoe, hah the Heidi Hoe.

high expectations,"Yo, yo, check it. Unattached and calm, sundaes and pills I palm. with intentions to make it to the league. Intrigued by two-letter cars, SE's and GS'ses. On the court niggaz I leave like messages. Plagued by this ball-player exorcist. It's sort of foul how the world be reffin us. Kenny is our Moses in this five-on-five Exodus. For the game of life, full courts ain't preppin us. Schools want me, but the ghost of Mango haunts me. Plus they wanna crib me, way out in the country. I'm city like street lights and some games that be fights. Never worked on my left so it's hard to be right. Either rich poor or Mike is who I wanna be like. Story of many black males that I refuse to rewrite. Yo, brothers opinions is Bias-ed, like Len. that I'll end up like Ben, Wilson, still some pretend to be friends. Beneath the grin I see the ?gin spoke up and assure a?. More so than my soul, my jump shot is purer. People play juror, I witness the fall of legends. Once was the joint now they restin got a God given present. My gallant talent is like a magic. trick turned by a chick with a bad habit. Opportunity to move I grab it. Me and my moms have static, now I wreak Hennesey and havoc. Man to man talks with Kenny, send me to a zone. Been on my own for so long, my vocal tone's grown. Competition gets blown like speakers. when I cross her like Jesus out of bleachers, broads and beepers. Yeah I boogey it's all good, but it could be better. Want to stay eighteen forever. But now I stay on point like Rod in this Strickland. If Brooklyn courts was the canvas, then I would be the big man. From thoughts that pennies bring, I assemble teams like the Kenny. Kings. Think fast over breaks, dialect I'm dribbling. Remembering, night posters of Moses and the Supreme Court. Realizing, that rap and life are team sports. I follow deep thoughts. Moves never perceived thought lyrical Johnny Cochran. cause of the way I free thought. The system make a nigga think to make it that he need sports. or either to the tip he gotta resort. my seed'll be taught to start his own. In the, George Carter zone. Don't wanna be a dope MC living in his momma's home. Or speaking to my fans in a starving artist tone. Unknown zones I roam with mind architechter. Spark the lecture, emphasizing to let God direct ya."
hungry,"[Common]. Yo, niggaz don't want none of this. Niggaz know they can't fuck with this. Turn this shit up just a little more. I walk the night in rhymin armor, bomb a nigga like a winter coat. Have him on Death Row searchin for an Interscope. Yet I sparkle like Irene Cara. Symbolize dope, like sirens do terror. Mariel just had a baby someone else decapitated. Flashbacks of past raps make me so glad I made it. Players is gettin traded. I drop a gem off, them who's style is jaded. My juice is grated. Shit is so bangin niggaz say it's gang related. On philosopher's rink of thought, I've skated with precision. Crews is gettin split like decisions. Com will let it ride in collision. Vision like Coleco or tele, I battle stars in stellar.... Regions, my thought scheme was my like my offspring. Now, it's teethin. My reason of rhyme applies to season and time. Season of mind, body and regions divine. In mom's cookouts, I'm leavin the swine. Verbal vegeterian, squashed beef with Ice Cube. Came in this rap life nude. Now I'm fully clothed with flows. You tricks can't hide behind expensive cars and clothes. Old niggaz I expose like Luke does hoes in videos. With classic material, imperial and rugged like. Got mag, but my slugs a mic. You fake like a smile, like a hug, I'm tight. Skip ladies, this is rip a muthafucka night. Oracle arouse, niggaz don't even run for cover right. Downtown interracial lovers hold hands. I breathe heavy like an old man, with a cold can of Old Style. Hold a Stone Isle profile. Mix between Malcolm X and Sef when I go wild. Hold mics like a second nut until the second comin. Hummin comin towards you with power like forwards do. Hip hop, you my bitch and like a Ford, I'm Explorin you. So, wack niggaz be cool, with them, I stay cordial. Flowin room temperature, cats is presumed miniature. Like golf. Soft like Tiger Woods. And real nigga angles I've stood with ways that's geometric. Don't need to rob banks with dike broads to Set it. I levitate to the occasion, lounge like a lyricist. Rhyme wise, you a rest haven. You sat by the door spooked like I was Wes Craven. You need to do more deletin and less savin. A praise in hell, raisin heaven. Like the bill on my pager leavens. What you should have known from day one. You will on day seven. ""Hungry hip hop junkie in the city"" (*scratched 3X*)."
i am music,"feat. Jill Scott. [Chorus: Jill Scott]. Can you speak your words of bedtime. I was just saying to myself the other day. Most of believing the magician. But you're bewitching. Because of this I must say. I (I). I (oh I). I. Appreciate what you give to me. Yeah (I). I (oh I). I. Appreciate what you give to me. [Verse 1: Common]. People say I got soul look at all the records I hold. The lives I've affected, connect and control. With me in your basement, your mama got blown. I provide the vibe to keep the strippers on poles. Through me the black experience is glorious told. From a school that's old bold, so I rock gold. And platinum, so cats I hold notes and cash for them. On streets I rap for them, in ghettos I blast for them. Mash with them, at the party and all. Peep the universal language that's embodying all. Put the Billie Holiday, Bob Marley in y'all. Y'all feel most high when I be in y'all. System, with the rhythm I up jump the boogie. Shame I rely on record labels to push me. Since the bush, I been y'all way to escape. Through eight-tracks wax CDs and tapes. I am music. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. You can feel me all over alive, I help culture survive, I opened the eyes of. many. Styles y'all wrote in the skies, with your lows and highs, open your mind to. hear me. . . . CLICK ABOVE TO VISIT OUR SPONSORS. . In the streets I beat cops and obsolete. On every station it's hot you can't stop my heat. I taught J and Dre how to rock the beat. On what's going on today yo, I gots to speak. I take the stand, yo you could feel me bam. Whether in Larry Graham or Steely Dan. Live I be killing it man. For how long I survived yo I'm realer than man. Got a soft side but I'm still a man. For me women cry and children dance, I'm trying to eat. I could'a got a mil and ran. But like Sly for the fam still I stand. I am music. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. I been here since the beginning. Beginning of time yo beginning of time. Deep in the mind of the ancient ones. Everybody love me like they do the sun. I shine at times yo at times I'm dark. You can't categorize me, my mind's a art. Inside my heart, it ain't about climbing charts. I'm the one you roll with when your ride is smart. The change that came, the change that comes. I change with chords and I kick it with drums. Get blow with horns and did it on the one. Riffed for guitars, for the Lord I sung. Spun around the world at parties and weddings. Wherever I go I create the setting. You know me from lessons or your pops collections. Whether whole or half stepping I'm a blessing. Yo I am music. [Chorus 2X]."
i got a right ta,"[Common]. Yeah! Hah! Yeah, we got, come on. Y'all cats know the abstract nigga with the attitude. Pass the booze, and let's build on it. I'm rolling in a Cadillac with the grill fronted. I ain't even smoke no mo' but I feel blunted. Yo I'm tokin on the freedom. Stepping to the A.M., cats be tokin in the P.M.. Tell the players I'm the G.M.. Told my team let me get my plays straight, I'ma feed them. They need me like I need them. See the streets is bleedin. Had to meet with my mind and ? to be defined and. Stay on my climb. I'm grind - ing, 'til I get blue balls. Everyday, same shit new star. Don't make me act like where I come from because he grew tall. There's a place that to run from it if you neu - tral. Hustlers and vogues, customers and smokes. I kiss the sky feeling high off the stuff that I wrote. [Chorus (x2)]. I want to ride in my car, smoke my weed. Keep my head high, let the chrome spin. I got the right to feel hood. I got the right to feel high. I got the right to feel hood. I got the right to feel high. [Common]. I'm the only cat in hip hop that can go into a thrift shop. Connect, get up to the ghetto and get props. If you gonna get that kick-a-box. Make sure that ? not. If you gonna get that glock don't be scared to big shot. Hip Hop is changin, y'all want me to stay the same?. Sorta like Barkley on how I see the game. I recognize game like a scout. Ayo, I'm bound to wreck your lady as I turn your lady out. I ain't about that. Messing with no other man's women. Because of jealousy then a man go under. Understand a man and his mental. Listening to Joan Mitchell. With the fan and the window. Can it be so simple then?. I rock Rockports, you rock Timberlands. I want a Rover, but I'm thinking long range. I ain't switch over, I just made my own lane. [Chorus]. [Common]. Like a pimp to a hoe I connect to the track. I feel it in my neck and my back. A thug came to me, said it changed his life. Said the love of his life, he used to bang to the light. I'm trying to do better. I ain't claiming Mister Right. I'm a grown man, I'm too old to fist-fight. I stay on point like trick dice. Tweeking like the sound man who need to switch mike. Sounding bitch like. I know the block is hot, but we just can't get ice. When our children's children sit nice?. I sing the song to make the fiend's strong. King Kong ain't got shit on me. I train days to rip emcees, I'm peaking. But I still gotta get that cheese. You on some monkey ball damn chimpanzees. Mobbin through the Chi-Town to feel the breeze yo. [Chorus]."
i have a dream (ft. will.i.am),"I am happy. I am I am happy. I got a dream. [one day]. We gonna work it out oh oh. We gonna work it out oh oh. We gonna work it out. I got a dream. We gonna work it out oh oh. We gonna work it out oh oh. We gonna work it out. I got a dream. [that one day]. That one day. All of the people and myself. Are gonna find a better way. My dream is to be free. My dream is to be. My dream my dream is to be. My dream is to be. My dream is to be free. In search for brighter days. I ride through the maze of the madness. Struggle is my address. Where pain and crack lives. Gunshots coming from sounds of blackness. Given this game with no time to practice. Born on the blacklist. Told I'm a little average. A life with no cabbage. That's no money if you're from where I'm from. Funny,. I just want some of your sun. Dark clouds seem to follow me. Alcohol that my pops swallowed bottle me. No apology. I walk with a boulder on my shoulder. It's a cold war. I'm a colder soldier. I hold the same fight that made martin luther the. King. I ain't usin' it for the right thing. In-between lean and the fiends. Hustle and the schemes. I put together pieces of a dream. I still have one. I am happy. I am I am happy. I got a dream. [one day]. We gonna work it out oh oh. We gonna work it out oh oh. We gonna work it out. I got a dream. We gonna work it out oh oh. We gonna work it out oh oh. We gonna work it out. I got a dream. [that one day]. That one day. I'ma look deeper than myself. Are gonna find a better way. My dream is to be free. My dream is to be. My dream my dream is to be. My dream is to be. My dream is to be free. The world see me lookin' in the mirror. Images of me gettin' much clearer. Dear self,. I wrote a letter just to better my soul. If I don't express it,. Then forever I hold inside. I'm from a side where we outta control. Rap music and the hood play a fatherly role. My story like yours, yo, gotta be told. Tryin' to make it from a gangsta to a godlier role. And jewish people in cold caves. Hate has no color or age. Flip the page. Now my rage became freedom right. Write dreams in the dark. They far, but I can see em. I believe in heaven more than hell. Blessings more than jail. In the ghetto, let love prevail. With a story to tell. My eyes see the glory of, well,. The world waitin' for me to yell. I have a dream. I am happy. I am I am happy. I got a dream. [one day]. We gonna work it out oh oh. We gonna work it out oh oh. We gonna work it out. I got a dream. We gonna work it out oh oh. We gonna work it out oh oh. We gonna work it out. I got a dream. [that one day]. That one day. All of the people and myself. Are gonna find a better way. My dream is to be free. My dream is to be. My dream my dream is to be. My dream is to be. My dream is to be free"
i used to love h.e.r.,"(Verse One:). I met this girl, when I was ten years old. And what I loved most she had so much soul. She was old school, when I was just a shorty. Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me on the regular,. Not a church girl she was secular. Not about the money, no studs was mic checkin her. But I respected her, she hit me in the heart. A few New York niggaz, had did her in the park. But she was there for me, and I was there for her. Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her. and just cool out, cool out and listen to her. Sittin on a bone, wishin that I could do her. Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be. Because we related, physically and mentally. And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around. Slim was fresh yo, when she was underground. Original, pure untampered and down sister. Boy I tell ya, I miss her. (Verse Two:). Now periodically I would see. Ol` girl at the clubs, and at the house parties. She didn't have a body but she started gettin thick quick. Did a couple of videos and became afrocentric. Out goes the weave, in goes the braids beads. medallions. She was on that tip about, stoppin the violence. About my people she was teachin me. By not preachin to me but speakin to me. In a method that was leisurely, so easily I approached. She dug my rap, that's how we got close. But then she broke to the West coast, and that was. cool. Cause around the same time, I went away to school. And I'm a man of expandin, so why should I stand in her way. She probably get her money in L.A.. And she did stud, she got big pub but what was foul. She said that the pro-black, was goin out of style. She said, afrocentricity, was of the past. So she got into R&B hip-house bass and jazz. Now black music is black music and it's all good. I wasn't salty, she was with the boys in the hood. Cause that was good for her, she was becomin well. rounded. I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit. Just havin fun, not worried about anyone. And you could tell, by how her titties hung. (Verse Three:). I might've failed to mention that the shit was. creative. But once the man got you well he altered the native. Told her if she got an energetic gimmick. That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy. Now I see her in commercials, she's universal. She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle. Now she be in the burbs lickin rock and dressin hip. And on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city. Talkin about poppin glocks servin rocks and hittin. switches. Now she's a gangsta rollin with gangsta bitches. Always smokin blunts and gettin drunk. Tellin me sad stories, now she only fucks with the. funk. Stressin how hardcore and real she is. She was really the realest, before she got into. showbiz. I did her, not just to say that I did it. But I'm committed, but so many niggaz hit it. That she's just not the same lettin all these groupies do her. I see niggaz slammin her, and takin her to the sewer. But I'ma take her back hopin that the shit stop. Cause who I'm talkin bout y'all is hip-hop"
i want you (feat. will i am),"(Will.i.am). Once the love was strong. Now it's long, long gone. Cause the pain, came down like a storm. i remained holding on. Cause I want you, cause I want you. I want you, I want you. (Common). I been thinkin bout. I been thinkin bout. I been thinkin bout u lately. Thoughts take me to when we were close. Addicted 2 your love, feel i need another dose. I know it's a feeling. That should be long gone. Things seem to come up. When I hear our song. Golden brown girl, it seem so long. Since i heard your voice. Where did the king go wrong?. Emotions that that they linger on. I guess cause i never knew a love so strong. So many hotgirls. I need your warm. The taste of your mouth. Girl i need your warm. Good food and love. I need your warm. This here was made before we were born. A dreamer, so i'ma keep dreamin on. It's kinda like the breakup of jen and vince vaughn. (Will.i.am). Once the love was strong. Now it's long, long gone. Cause the pain, came down like a storm. i remained holding on. Cause I want you, cause I want you. I want you, I want you. (Common). They say you don't know know know. What you got. Til' what u got is gone. Yeah i like such and such yo alot. But the feelings not as strong. We were like 2 birds. That were able to fly. I try to pick the right words to say to the sky. Somedays i would try but wasn't able to cry. I never been good at sayin goodbye. I take a deep breath when the times is hard. When i reminisce over u, my god. I spent many years tryna be the heartthrob. I guess it's only right that i got my heart robbed. The scent of a room that reminds me of u. A hint of perfume it remind me of u. Take a look at the moon it remind me of u. Hope the stars and the gods. Align me and you. (Will.i.am). Once the love was strong. Now it's long, long gone. Cause the pain, came down like a storm. i remained holding on. Cause I want you, cause I want you. I want you, I want you. Cause I want you, cause I want you. I want you, I want you. (Common). We do what we do. And we do what we live. I luv this way. Cause i got it as a kid. Wit so much to give from it. I never hid. The love that i wrote on the mirror it got smeared. My friends say it was a change for the better. But i say, girl u changed my forever. Relationships they can be as strange as the weather. Rain or sun. We can sang this together. (Will.i.am). Cause I want you, cause I want you. I want you, I want you. Cause I want you, cause I want you. I want you, I want you"
i've been thinking,"[Featuring Sean Lett]. Intro: Common. Yeah, one two, bless. Yeah yeah, check it. I got my mellow Sean Lett. He gonna get down for y'all Chicago style. Eighty-seven, you know the bidness, check it. Chorus: Common, Sean Lett. After eight years of my life, of smoking and drinking. The world keeps spinning, so lately I've been thinking. After eight years of my life, of smoking and drinking. The world keeps spinning, so lately I've been thinking. Verse One: Common. Nearest to the go gothic, a cash flow prophet. Methods of gettin scratch and talkin slick I've adopted. Palms in the lock with stunts whose hearts be game. Hoes in the stable, none do I claim. Niggaz with nothin to shoot for, at they only aim. Gramps in the choir singin it's gonna rain. in the midst of precipitation, I make the power. manipulations, so my offspring'll be straight for generations. Got connections in the nation. To incarceration, to general population. More lyrics than Jason, look me in the face when you speak to me. You got a tattoo? Bitch youse a freak to me. Seeking the, good sess material. Asking when's my next video. Bitch get a job and get your ass in somebody's university. Enroll your youngun in a nursery. And cleam him up, comb his hair, cover yourself. You want a man to love you you ain't loving yourself. I'm discovering wealth watches wisdom in ways. To make it in the last days, now bring it on. Chorus. Verse Two: Sean Lett. I feel blessed I survived two decades in this world. Then Ninety slid in naked now I got a baby girl. Ain't this a bitch, myself still a child. I want to hang on eighty-seven corners act wild on Stoney Isle. Better school her, so presence is your seed in society. Parks of envy jealous niggaz crack fiends yes indeed. I won't misleed and you can best believe. I'm just a blink away shorty anytime that you need. See I know right now, you're just too young to understand. Asking questions, why pops and moms don't be holding hands. Don't you worry about it yet, in due time we'll explain. Why having you, created just an everlasting shame. Bringing joy witcha smiles, tripping when you first walked. Knowing somebody's child is gettin outlined in chalk. Just relieved it ain't you, I got much love for you boo. Cause it ain't nuthin that these skanless niggaz in these streets. won't do. Stop me if I'm lying, see my race is steady dying. Short methods to making cream, bullets sprays and shatters dreams. See basically, Chi-town's game-related and designed. Niggaz store up theirs and down opposite signs. Chorus. Outro: Sean Lett, Common. It's like that y'all (yeah yeah). Common Sense and dirty mizer on the set y'all. Sean Lett. We gonna get down like that. My man Eddie C on the board. We coming through y'all for eighty-seventh street. Seventy-first and everybody in South show. We coming through for niggaz on the West side. Down in the ickies, all up and down state. We gonna keep it straight like that. We straight out for gold. You call it Chi-town it's still our town. Holding it down like this with that eighty-seven sound. We talking about rocking niggaz state to state nationwide. On the real it's like that. Straight up South side is where we loaf. Shit be real around these parts, I'm serious. YouknowhatI'msayin? Hear me. You know what? We out though."
in my own world (check the method),"[Featuring No I.D.]. (""Yeah yeah, now check the method"" - Extra P from ATCQ's _Keep It. Rollin_). * cut and scratched 4X by Mista Sinister. Verse One: No I.D.. No time to get all excited, just write it. from the inside let the pen slide, and spread. the ink on the papyrus, come understand this (what?). Paint the canvas, givin you my vision. To mold you, compose you. Get a picture of the scene, then get an exposure. Words out my cipher, the life of my circle. Train tracks aside of me, Cabrini to Idabi, don't lie to me. You want me in your needle. Squirt me in your vein, maintain on the couch. I excite your brain till I'm out of your system. Be digger not a nigger or a niggerole I figure you're. the winner of the bread, precede your thoughts. 'fore they come into your head (yo kid kinda nice!). From the word, I speak, unique, clear and concise. Heads I'm boring, soaring to a new height of flight. And then fight the night. With a light to gain sight make your competition say AIGHT. No I.D. from the city with a bridge on thirty-first. Makin all butt crews disperse. Chorus: repeat 4X. [No I.D.] I'm in my own world (""Yeah yeah, now check the method""). Verse Two: Common. [No I.D.] (""Check the method"") I'm in my own world. I say pay attention boy, I say UHH looka here. I want you to see me when you do you look and fear. I dilate pupils it's cornea than a retina. My Book of Life you felt it, because of the texture. When I'm bubbly I call the ex ta, see if she still love me. I'm advanced like a copy studs be on my sac to dub me. CHEAP ASS NIGGAZ! Go and purchase it. I ain't do all this work for shit. my style's my child I gave birth to it. Like an immaculate conception, clean I came. Went through label pains, didn't give shorty a name. I put, bros before hoes that's the way love and life goes. It's a Jungle out there but I'm never Fever-in for them white hoes. I love black thighs, you sisters better realize. The real hair and real eyes get real guys. So before you makeup your face, you better make up your mind. I hope you wake up in time for the revolution, or you gon be like. ""I can't believe it! I got shot!"". Bowe/bo so I lick one, not for Riddick. But I got the Rid, for my dick. And the crab MC's that be all over it. Huh, what good is the Rid without the comb?. I'm the street pick peace to Nick, Tim, Mark and Sekendall. I remember me and Deion tried to get into Mendal. I didn't have No I.D., they wouldn't let me in. Now them same gumps be askin me to get them in. I be like, ""You don't know me... fool"". And color it purple, cause he ain't in my circle. Now I'm talkin square biz to you and I'm out. I'm in my own world."
inhale,"*scratches* Inhale. (Verse 1). I breathe deep. like an old man in a deep sleep. or an Indian peace pipe. Identity be. the beginning, the end, the first, the last. Breathe into infinity. A verse that lasts. Got a chick in the south that be cursin' fast. When it was she tried a nigga nurse it last (?). The hunger of a homeless. Microphonus. Played the game - it got a bonus. Man is the plan. The master like Tiger. So much is the drive. I am the definition of a rider. Daughter's name means survivor. From a tribe-a. Colliders. Just one word can't describe her. A scribe of the streets. And a good life that we all wanna reach. I'm hotter than a beach. Flow is so deep. Even underwater. I can inhale to bring the world in order. *scratches* Inhale"
invocation,"Common:. Envisioning the hereafter, listenin to Steve Wonder. On a Quest for Love like the Proceed drummer. I strike like lightning and don't need thunder. Inhale imagination and breathe wonder. That's your lady, I used to run up in her and G weed from her. It's a cold world and niggaz need summer. At times my going forward seems like retreat. As I be writin rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats. Growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets. There's a thin line between war and peace, whores and jeeps. Ignore MCs like beeps, scribblin freedom on pages. My third eye is like pink eye, seemin contagious. Redeemin the ancients with ace this rhyme jargon. I feel Mexican, hip hop is my garden. Don't give a fuck where you chartin, certain shit I can't honor. It ain't that you sellin, it's your karma. Rappers I monitor like a chaperone, you large and haven't grown. Poetically perform fly-bys, another rapper gone. The stage becomes a catacomb, I rap like a mummy. Not for the money, I could have sampled Diana Ross a long time ago. My mind of flow is like motor key 20. Youngblood said he had dimes, I prayed that he see twenty. Hollerin at the brothers, either you gon be a thug or a man. Flip drugs and get land, I can see my man Rashad. As he described how the bucks hit him. And said slugs was still stuck in him, when it rained, it fucked wit. him. This bucket interrupt wisdom and asked when my album was comin. I said it's here. It's here(echoed)."
it's your world,"""It's Your World"". (feat. 'POPS'). [Verse 1]. Night Blows, Stoves don't work, Hoes at work. A warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt. Wish I was free as Che was,I spend a day buzzed. Trippin on heights, wishin for nights in different flavors. The age of Kane and Big Daddy,shown by the caddies. Uncles named Larry, that never really grabbed me. My mother gave birth but she really never had me. Left to the hood to play daddy. Raised by niggaz named Butch through the bay bay. With waists so they weigh they status on the streets. License plates that say they, motto This is Chicago in the hay day. Similiar to Good Times, I guess that I was Jay Jay. A skinny nigga, young girls with penny figures. So many niggaz, stacked upon each other. It's the black upon each other that we love so much. Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch. Used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much. Rather have some thick broads then the dutch to clutch. Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years. My college career got downed with a couple of beers. Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans. Same nigga, same block, same shit they own. Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome. In my defense, yo I had to hit that zone. Man to man, I'm good workin with my hands. My generation never understood workin for the man. And, of bein broke I ain't a fan. Now I stand in the same spot, as my old man. My life I planned not to be on this corner. I still wanna see California. But this is my world. [Chorus Repeated Overlapping:]. ""It's your world"". [Common] Yeah. [Verse 2]. Life and death law around us. Four pounds and pounds a verb from out of towners. It's hard to stay grounded. We stay high, thats why old folks down us. Lost, nobody found us, the force that sorrounds us. Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us. We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures. Removed from earth, only to return through birth. Knew this girl sellin her body, wish she knew what it was worth.. Between God and trash, lookin in every car that pass. With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggaz she was breastfed. She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread. In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads. Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads. Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt. She was cold turk, growin up she got to know hurt. very well in a world where self hate is overt. Her step-father that he was ike, so her mother he striked. she got to like like minded niggaz, who liked crimes and figures. Doin white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her. In the ass, it used to be thicker. Life is fast, some choose to be quicker. I remember in high school she had a passion to sing. Now she see herself in a casket in dreams. These are the children of crack and rap, blacks done lack. Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream. On our jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme. In the Chi, we even rootin for a garbage team. This queen never seen herself on this Corner. She still wanna see California. But this is her world. [Chorus repeated several times]. [Kids stating their dreams]. ['POPS']. Be, be here, be there, be that, be this. Be greatful for life, be greatful to life. Be gleeful everyday, for bein the best swimmer among 500,000. Be-nign, be you, be mom's mean pie, be little black sambo With bad hair. Be aware of what a lynch is, Be, be boundless energy. Be a four star ghetto general, be no one except I. Be a strong academic student, be an A student in sociology. Be food for thought to the growin mind, be the author of your own horoscope. Be invited, be long-living, be forgiving, be not forgetful. Be a proud run, only to return to fight another day. Be peaceful if possible, but justice in ways (?). Be high when you low, be on time but knowin to go. Be cautious of the road to college, takin a detour through vietnam or the middle east. Be absent of wars at any past or present fought amongst themselves. Be visual of foreclosure over your shoulder while beggin. A nation built on free labor for reperation, Be a cartopogropher. Be a map maker, be able to find afro-american man. search thoroughly it may be close to black man. Be ammended 5/5ths, be ammended 5/5ths human. Be the owner of more land than is set aside for wild life. Be cupid, to world government. Be found among the truth, lost tribe. Be at full strength when walking through the valley. Be not foolish as tender 18 of the mountain tops. Be a brilliant soul, sparklin in the galaxy while walkin on earth. Be loved by God as much as God loved Ghandi and Martin Luther King. Be that last one of 144,000, be the resident of that twelfth house. Be....eternal!"

Name'll be in sentences wit the word ""remember"". Wrote a letter to '88, let's get back, love me tender. The letter came back three days later, return to sender. Damn!. ""Like they used to say"". ""Hot damn hoe here we go again"" [MC Lyte] ""Like they used to say"". ""I want it like that, I got it like that, I have it like that"" [Kool Keith]. ""Like they used to say"". ""You gots to chill"" [PMD] ""Like they used to say"". ""Boyz in the hood are always hard"" [Eazy E] ""Like they used to say"". ""One for all and all"" [Brand Nubian] ""Like they used to say"".

love is,"""Love Is..."". Yeah, yeah. [Chorus]. How beautiful love can be. On the streets love is hard to see. It's a place I got to be. Loving you is loving me. How beautiful love can be. On the streets love is hard to see. Gotta reach that frequency. Loving you is loving me. [Verse 1]. Yeah, you know what love is. Even found it on the ground where the thugs live. My man had to dig deep to find his. Couldn't sleep 'cause on the real he had five kids. Live nig's, real niggaz express and taste it. At crap games, black dames and big faces. Cases in court, fam' showin' love and support. You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport. As men we were taught to hold it in. That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men. If love is a place I'ma go again. At least now, now I know to go within. At time it can take ya for a spin. Heartbreak hotel then you're home again. I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend. Like a story that he don't want to end. Yo. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. It's all love where we come from. In the hood love we was told to run from. That same hood where the guns sung. We holla love, hopin' it would come one. Crack got so many lives undone. From lack of love many hide some run. I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of actin' in plays. Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze. Tryin' to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave. Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave. Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave. Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?. Everybody loves sun, why do I attract shade?. Heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays. Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand. What it is to be loved by a man. Uh. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. Some say that I'm a dreamer 'cause I talk about it often. Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin. We walk and stand in, fall in it. With the right companion we all in it. Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits. In the game of life, it's the scrimage. Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days. A letter to the people, love always. Yeah. [Chorus]"

I'll F your head up, like the L.A. 4, when I flow for cash I got for. broke. like Mel for Moore. Why should a male with a B8 get more then me?.

making a name for ourselves,"Canibus:. Yeah, yeah. Me and my man Com Sense. Rallyin troops like Joseph Stalin. Where you at yo?. Common:. I'm bout to make the name Com Sense a name you fear. Y'all niggaz is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared. Canibus:. And I'ma make the name Canibus a name you fear. Y'all niggaz is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared. Canibus and Common:. That's double for niggaz who ain't mathematically aware. (Rakim from ""My Melody""(To catch another sucka duck MC out there). Common:. I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight. I hold mics while you hold spite. Like a broken hearted bitch. Don't give no fuck who yo team or who you startin with. Cameoed or charted with, I house niggaz like apartments with. Mic mechanisms, I dissect a rhythm. Move crowds with kinetic wisdom. It's like a Malcolm X-orcisim, fuck the rhythm, I hit him. I want him got not get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him. Canibus:. I'm creatin the ultimate verses with perfect lines. Puttin together them whether my rhyme one threat at a time. So you niggaz need to stop testin me. Cuz you know you can't ""F"" with me. Steppin to me with insuperior weaponry. Exposin yourself to the verbal radiations. Sayin you can defeat me is nothin but speculation. Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels. Niggaz be diggin my styles like fossils and pterodactyls. Who wanna battle?. I'm bad to the bone marrow. The Earth got one sun but I walk with three shadows. With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard. Niggaz couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage. MCs will compete with lyrics and beats get crushed. I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch. What!. (scratching). Common, steppin to me is like going to the county being a neutron. Common, I ain't scared of no nigga. Common:. I persue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair. Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs. On knots, I landed, players get played like Hamlet. Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life. I write twice and drop singles in record pools. Niggaz I'm dunkin like when cops mingle. Fuck hip hop jingles, rhymin big words and not sayin shit. The click that you came in with accent your flavor wit. Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggaz off all fours. I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for. Far more advanced than a rapper who's career. You could only take a glance, couldn't make the transition. >From B-boy to C-note stance. I stand in a circumference, the humbleness. But in the Chi, bumbleless. Was thinkin as a weakness were poetrys in motion. Like a bitch, I'm the main feature. Amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers. I make my living off of singles like Latifah. In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses. You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence. I'm cold with numb intentions. (scratching)Fuck with Canibus(x4). Canibus:. Yo, the Canibus is an animal with a mechanical mandible. Comin to damage you, spittin understandable slang at you. I be the all seeing lyrical, hammerhead sharp peripheral. With 360 degree visual. When the signal was given, MCs get biten with venom. >From a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em. My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em. My face don't belong in The Source. It belongs on the shroud of turan, for certain. I grab mics and murder shit. It's wickeder than Satan worshippers going to Catholic church services. You heard of this. The lyrical verbalist, trash herbalist. The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless. Rap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps. Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas. And I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last. I'll turn your ass into the artist formerly known as, you gay ass fag. I'll blow you to ashes with tactics. Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard. So phat to be a rap star, takin pictures at music seminars. People know who you are. Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me. Because they saw me, up in The Source chillin on page 40. Put this in your CD-ROM. www dot Canibus dot com. You can find me on the internet talkin to chicks. That was sweatin me off the Music Makes Me High remix. I be talkin mad trash tryin to get 'em to laugh. See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass. Bring it bag to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave.. Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab. You know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2. Beast from the East part 2, comin to see you. Common:. It's time I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear. Y'all niggaz is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared. Canibus:. Now that I made the name Canibus a name you fear. You still scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared. Common and Canibus:. That's double for niggaz who ain't mathematically aware. (To catch another sucka duck MC out there). Common:. Since I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear. Y'all niggaz is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared. Canibus:. And since I made the name Canibus a name you fear. You stay scared, I'm still your worst nightmare squared. Common and Canibus:. That's double for niggaz who ain't mathematically aware. (To catch another sucka duck MC out there)."
misunderstood,"Baby, you understand me now. If sometimes you see that I'm mad. No one can always be an angel. When everything goes wrong you see some bad. Well I'm just a soul whose intentions are good. Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood. [Common]. Yeah, uh (Misunderstood). We do this, for the people that walk that path. Tryna get to their dream, yeah, uh (oh). He stood on the corner with the rest of them. Though he knew that this corner wasn't the best of him. Hard streets and a life that crested him. Dirt police domestic beefs that's festerin. He knew the President wadn't addressin him. Though dead presidents was undressin him. Two kids from hot sex no protection and. People don't see how AIDS is affectin 'em. It get hard to get the get the God question in. Can't find a job so you robbin and hustlin. He killed marks and sold dope for cousin 'em. Can't believe they would be the ones bucking him. He on the ground he could feel God touching him. He heard the sound of his moms sayin trust in him. At heaven's gate, saying please Lord let me in. Or send me back to tell my people to be better men. [Chorus]. Misunderstood. 'Cause we are - Misunderstood. Misunderstood, Don't let me be misunderstood. I'm just human, oh. [Common]. Uh, yeah. She dancin she dance she dance for them. Her body move but her mind was manic'n. Thinkin I don't know where they hands have been. Relationships with men have been so damagin. She thought back to when she was at Howard and. Dreams of doing scenes with Terrence Howard and. Broadway plays and dancin with Alv and them. The ones that make it always ain't the talented. Some dreams get lost never to be found again. At first strippin seemed so empowerin. Most every girl wanna do it now and then. But bein meat every day is devourin. Cats puttin paper where she put powder and. Life would break her, now she powderin. She was high when she fell down and then. Crowd surrounding and, heart was poundin and. She fell into a deep sleep the siren sounded and. Seen bright lights in the midst of clouds and then. Talked to God, feeling like his child again. Said Lord let me live so I can make you proud again. [Chorus]. Misunderstood. 'Cause we are - Misunderstood. Misunderstood, Don't let me be misunderstood. I'm just human, oh. The life we lead, will always lead us. And we pray that he, will never leave us. It's the price we pay, I guess that's the reason. Why my grandma sang, we all need Jesus [2x]. Misunderstood, don't let me be, misunderstood. Misunderstood, don't let me be, misunderstood. I'm just human"
my city,"[Featuring Mylik Yusef]. This the city of Chicago. The state of confusion. The style I'm using is free. Or at least it would be if my mind was. Peep I'm behind cause. I didn't handle my function while in high school. Although I was cool. The hood I live in ain't that proper. Cause a cop a stop ya. And have you at a hundred and eleventh before you can say not guilty. I'm not filthy. Nor am I rich. Ain't that a bitch. Like life is. Not your wife is. See that your better halve. Do your math. And peep that two halves make a whole. And all I have to hold. Is my self pride. So these streets I strive. Like a Black Panther. Asking can the. situation get much worst. All I do is try to appeal to the masses. As the phrase keep it real passes. The teeth of too many phoney individuals. Snakes, that smooth like criminals. They create chemicals. That the Earth hate. Doing their damndest to decrease my birth rate. I'd settle for lesser knowing I'm worth wait. Or at least my weight in precious gems. So I'm steadily steadly steadly. Trying to lose my religion, like R E M. Created in His own image so are we him?. And through all this crises. Shid(Shit) I wonder where Christ is. Well he damn sure not in K town or the wild hundreds. Where they broadcast G.D. till the world blow-up. And Stone run it. Hunted by police for display in state vile cages. Come out to make minimum wages. And with a desiese that are contagious. It is fucking outrages. The amounts of Black and Brown they lock up. But the Most High encourages me to put the glock up. And Stock up on do for self knowledge. A brother couldn't afford to go to collage. So I had to learn form the school of hard knock. On the hard blocks of the Chi. Even I, think about moving out to River Oaks. As my liver soaks. In mad Hennesy. Cause I got a bad tendency. To do a lot of drinking. Now I do a lot of thinking. Blinking, was your third eye. When you heard I. was one of the chosen one. Industry doors keep closing. (sing) Watch the closing doors. Niggas want a record deal. But can they deal with a record?. Cause once they get rich. They tend to switch. Like a sissy. Please miss me. With all that bullshit you popping. This knowledge I'm gonna keep dropping. Even if you had one of them red octagon. Motherfuckers say Mylik how you make your living?. I say by breathing oxygen."

The music oh ah, can you feel the music, the music. [Common]. Yo check it yo. In this never-ending battle to please. Niggas, magazine writers, MC's. Who request hot shit, I freeze. And tell em where I was rose, we always said cold. Hold your Horses and ya Carriages, this never-went-gold nigga. Rocks shows care-less. You not gon' respect self, at least respect the heritage. Affect the lives, the spread of wealth and the merit is. I realize what I portray day to day, I gotta carry this. And beats, rhymes and life is where the marriage is. Had Dreams of Fuckin R&B broads, it came true. Journalist I wreck, shared the same view. Picked up a fallen angel on the path that I MC. Familiar voice, come to find out the angel was me. Some say ""You changin, Rashid"". Times are, we still close. I rhyme far, away away away. From what you accustomed to hearin everyday, uh-ah. You know the dope-choppin, gun-poppin, homies dyin. I'm amongst it, save the war stories for Private Ryan, INI. Chorus. [Common]. Yo check it yo. Women cry, children laugh, men dance. I refuse to lose self and try to win fans over. Weight on my shoulder fluctuates like Oprah's. My refrigerator poetry's magnetic like ultra. You couldn't hang if you was a poster. Posin like a bitch for exposure. It's rumors of gay MC's, just don't come around me wit it. You still rockin hickies, don't let me find out he did it. Got My Eyes on the Tiger, Eyes on the Prize. Eyes on the thighs of Mary J. Blige, imagin on how good the cat must be. Stop eatin meat, lost weight, but I still rap husky. My verse depth is that of a baby's first step. Or the old lady who died and the nurse wept. I flow like cursive writing, invitin you and yours to my openess. Shows allow me to cop Range/range like a vocalist. But man does not live on bread alone. What good is a Range/range when it's time to head home?. Chorus 2x. [Common] *during chorus on the second time*. We be that, we be that. Afrodisiac, disiac. We be that, we be that. Afrodisiac, disiac. We be that, we be that. Afrodisiac, disiac. We be that, we be that. Afrodisiac, disiac. We be that, we be that. Afrodisiac, disiac. We be that, we be that. Afrodisiac, disiac yeah."
new wave,"(feat. Laetitia Sadier). Yeah! The war zone. Who you fighting for?. [Verse 1: Common]. It's funk to rhythm and punk to rock. loud like shot that come from a glock. Pick up your mind, run from the spot. Revolution jumping in the parking lot. Shit is so hot that the sun watch. Children by the window with the gun cocked. they could get robbed and stop the luck (?). Monkeys dance around for MTV spots. I lock into a..... rock into a rhythm of street and ancient wisdom. Experiment in stereo loud so crank the system. For the humble on the path I paint a vision. How far will a nigga go just for attention. And to be remembered, you forgot the mission. Listen!. [Chorus: Laetitia Sadier]. All traces of life. in our gats we carry. that's used to dress humanity. ([Common:] it's a New Wave, Come on!). [Sung in French]. All traces of life. in our gats we carry. that's used to dress humanity. ([Common:] it's a New Wave, Dig it!). [Sung in French]. This life is precious. it's goddamn? marvelous. before it ever ends. ([Common:] it's a New Wave, Come on!). This life is precious. it's goddamn? marvelous. before it ever ends. ([Common:] Come on! Come on!). [Verse 2: Common]. I lay terror in this era like Che Guevera. for the people to make or wait it's better. in a room called real I stay forever. Everyday I lose something I gain forever. Meditate on how I can change the weather. My brainstorm for some it's like (?) umbrella. where bullets and lies both spray together. My mind scream like Al Green ""Let's Stay Together"". How could a nigga be so scared of change. That's what you hustle for, for the currency exchange. Ya'll rich, we could beef curry in the game. out your mouth, ain't nobody hurrying my name. You seen what happened when the Com go BANG. Wouldn't have a shot, even at a gun range. Seen hype become fame against the grain become main-stream. It all seems mundane in the scope of thangs. [Chorus]. [Verse 3: Common]. From a land of shit talk, boy stars and pitch forks. didn't really see white until I went North. Getting bent on backyards, wishing in the air for a black god. Where people fix cars and clap hard. and look to the stars for rap jobs. I walk through the black fog with reflectors on my boots. smelling war near, I'm connected with the troops. that master anger and ain't afraid to shoot. through poured liquor fallen angels they salute (Whew! Whew!). Feel the wind blow. A new wave- people with their hair trimmed low. It's two ways living in this world of techno. This age can't really save the ghetto. I pause for the rebels who rock heavy metals. and tell them that they're pharoh so let go. Come on!. [Chorus]."
next time,"I'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close. Squeeze you tight, the next time that I see you. I'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart. And I hope I die. The next time that I see you. A cloudy day in the chi. I was downtown getting my license. Money ain't a thang but hey, fame is priceless. Waiting in line, yeah that's one of my vices. This lady recognized me and moved me through the line quick. To number one, said sign this for her son. I drew my name with a bible and a gun. One of her coworkers had a cousin in rap. Can't knock his hustle, but I be doing him like skinny pete. In the back, they was playin' light jazz. Spotted this woman with light plus she had a bright ass. I was checking her out trying to act like I ain't checking her out. She could see that I was checking her out. On some roy ayers, we was vibing a bit. Told her my next album gonna be live with the hits. She did a skit on how she don't be dating rappers. Said I got my sag card baby I'm an actor. And after the laughter I said, ""naw for real"". She said, ""naw for real, forreal? "". Some days it's the sun, some days it's the rain. Some chicks you forget, some stay in your brain. Somehow in my mind this broad still remain. Three days later, I'm about to get on the plane. In the security lane, the thing kept beeping. It's probably these hard raps that I be keeping. Speaking of the goddess, I picked up my metal objects. You know how you can bring to life what's in your conscience. Slim with the pompous attitude from the dmv. Happened to have a beautiful ass in front of me. Yup, I'm looking and she sort of took it in. That awkward moment of ""damn, damn, that's him again"". I start telling her how beautiful her thoughts are. A man walked up, she said ""this is walter"". I looked at a little walter as he stuck out his hand. Said since borrow a dollar, he been a fan. Said he met me at a show about four years ago. I'm thinking goof troop, I don't remember that shit. I told him that I didn't so I ended that quick. On the ice cube tip, like stay off my dick. And tell your chick to come here. Yeah, I gotta word I want to give to her ear. And it goes like. I can't be lusting another man's woman too long. I picked up my pride to the gate, I moved on. With the nike airs on, stepping into first class. Wondering why these flight attendants don't be having no ass. One asked if I wanted a drink. I laid back and just said naw I wanted to think. About how and why old girl was affecting me. Opened my eyes her and dude was right next to me. Was this destiny like the jackson five?. I was shocked inside, but I reacted live. Told her every time I think of her she actualize. I said fate baby ain't something to rationalize. Seen passion in her eyes as my words hit her. She said walter wasn't her nigga, he just work with her. We dipped to the bathroom so she could try my love. Now she's a member of the mile high club"
nuthin' to do,"Intro:. Check it on the one, you Com is gonna come (X3). And check it out, ha.. Verse 1:. My raps do laps around tracks to the days. The idiot vibin', I'm the comma comma Chamelion. I use to pop the willy on my blue and gray sting ray. It had maxed, I was with bitches that had coochie. Bassum wasn't rollin' Starters, looking harder than niggas. Hoes wore clothes, that exposed their figures. Ain't 7 steps in the jam, next the police come. Heist there would be one, numbers I would get at least one. We come to the get together with whatever. You wouldn't know how deep it was, we all did shit together. Eat up all your vittles, drink your brew and then step to. The next cue, let's do it again y'all. That was when mad was tall and phat was cold. The days of Old Chicage and Fun Town and shorties we run round. Play strike outs till sun down, but the shit ain't as fun now. And the city is all run down, we troop down to Jew Town. Talking cat down on some gear, have enough for a Polish incom fair. I stare, at what use to be Bubbles and think about who use to cop our. liquior. (Who?) Our neighborhood father figure. Hook:. I'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but ah,. ""Niggas be rollin'"" - Ol' Dirty Bastard from Protect Ya Neck. Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a hoe while I. ""Niggas be rollin'"". Gotta make a stop take a leak and get some chops cause um. ""Niggas be rollin'"". We gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause um. ""Niggas be rollin'"". Verse 2:. I got more rhymes then the Manor got folks had style. Since I went to McDowl, wearin' boats. And penny loafers know I had the nickel in mines. We use to hoop in my yard but now I dribble the rhyme. It's like rain drops couldn't make our game stop. Skeeter will hit from the SAME spot. Torla tore my shit down, get down, put your body in motion. Only the strong survive, but on the 6 or the 5. Live as hot as sex use to be at the Racket. Wrong club with music by Andre Hatchet. Or either Beat Box Ferris at them country club parties. Would be hot as hell and house stud would get ""Find a body!"". Sawyers I would go there, hip hop clubs were so rare. I like the music anyways and it was always hoes there. Was said to have the best chicks but mostly High Park and V hoes. Is who I mess with, the best shit was troopin' to the loop. With your posisions held class crooked ass but still go the division. (I remember that) Over Yamela's crib while his old girl was at work. Bust a smoothie on the spread, but sill have some on your shirt. Hook. Verse 3:. I tuned into BMX and taped Farly on the tonemaster. I took the 6 instead of the 28 to get home faster. Then HBK was the only station that would fuck with rap. You was on the shore by yourself castin' stay up your act. What you could make of it, you was a gump they was takin' shit. Either fight or break for it, we go to the lake and get full. My drink there was Boons and Red Bull. I remember swimming in Avenlon, and being in a pool. I thought I was cool, with my ""members only"" and a bold fade. Wall to wall greens to get the sport gray and palmade. And soft breasts, as we got older we would star crush and bang fags. Go to Marshals and change tags, I snagged nuff niggas. And games are off the wall, in softball, Piggy one I would call. When I first got my three way callin', I caught Marsh tryin' to lie. Home of the original gangbangers, and ain't nobody shot. Hook."

play your cards right,"Yeah... ohhh... (3x). Bilal - Chorus. Ohhh.... Everything’s gone be alright. If you play your cards right. Everything’s gone be alright.... Common. It’s do or die, your looking through the eye of a revolver. I revolve around the world, a problem solver. Alter your ego, and the way your walkin’. Talk to people, still I stay regal. Read through the bullshit. Sometime to make peace, you need a full clip. Roll dice with niggas who got bricks at a good price. Talk shit, give good advice, rollin’ through the ’hood right. It’s the good life, like T.I. said. Gettin’ it, how could I not be fed. Get bread, get dough, get fed, get mo’. In the old school Lincoln, thinking I sit low. Let problems burn slow away. I yearn for the day that it won’t go gray. Remember we were kings, back in the day. Still can be, depending on the cards you play. Bilal - Chorus 2x. If you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right). Everything... gone be alright (well... alright (3x)). Common. I ain’t playin’ with a full deck. The government won’t let me get a full check. I’m taxin’ marks, I got more heart than clubs. The black spade, givin’ ’em darker love. Make ’em strip, like poker poker mag in his face. You tried to smoke my ace, you know the stakes. It’s high like the ace is. Get your squad face down like cards, before they get a facelift. You get robbed, better yet jacked for diamonds. Leave you victimless, like Jack in ""Shining"". Blocked your bluff, now your respect is stolen. Took your chips, led my guys in Texas Hold ’Em. Rolled the strips of Vegas, with money boss players. Stacey Adams of different flavors, we major. Gangstas and hustles, living moviestar life. Dealt a bad hand, but I played my cards right. Bilal - Chorus 2x. If you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right). Everything... gone be alright (well... alright (3x)). Bilal - Chorus 2x. Ohh.... If you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right). Everything’s... gone be alright (well... alright (3x)). Yeah... Ohhh.... Everything’s gone be alright, if you play your cards right. Everything’s gone be alright..."
pops rap iii...all my children,"Hey, hey old bean and you to baby sweetness. Yeah, this is Pops, and I'm back in the studio. And I didn't have to break in this time. I'm back as a special guest by special request. And I want to thank my son for loaning me this microphone once again. They may have to wrestle to get it back. You know, as a result of my son common touring the world. Pops has acquired a wonderful extended family from around the globe. He has returned with positive messages to my earlobes. From all my children From Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Japan. And of course in the motherland. Even in the orient, they know what I meant. Nanaan, tanaan, tinaan, hanchinaan. So I didn't come in here to give any shouts out. I came to give praise and honor and to identify my children. Who've been saying and doing the right things. You know they sat on those nines of 1999. And kept them from turning upside down. And teaching the babies to love, to be able to give love. And to enter the new century with their own prophecy. The century of amends. You see I deal with the premise that all children are ours. And that we all travel the same path. It's just that we don't get there at the same time. See you next lifetime, see you next lifetime. And to my children running around here. Talking about how nice is they ice. That they've already paid for twice. What karat is they gold. That was yours before you were done in the hole. Or that crew from 1629, buy some land. Think agriculture, beat that neighborhood. Which you claim you love so dear. Are you mankind or what kind of a man?. See, Pops is straight out of the garden. From when the world was starting brand new. Hip-hop, hip-hop, the language of the underground railroad. In it's purest form. Yeah true hip-hop is just like the underground railroad. If the message is not for you. It can sit on your nose and your brain remain froze. So when you see me traveling on a spiritual high. I'm flying high with Cee-Lo. Or maybe watching my long's heart dancing to a De La flow. Everybody knows there's no fruit on the tree without the roots. And Black Star said we are what we are. The Knowledge Of Self Determination and my little homie KG. Up there in Minnesota milking 10, 000 lakes. Keep the heat on em', we got to be kind to the growing mind. So if your heart is real. You will hear Big Will and Ms. Lauryn Hill. If your love is true, you will hear Baduism. And you can't go right until you go left. And get some ingredients from the music chef Jazzy Jeff. Children, I've traveled this globe, north to south, east to west. And whenever my soul appears lost. I turn to the musical stylings of a Tribe Called Quest. Okay, we ready to get out of here. We ready to take it home now. Just so everybody knows. When Pops get ready to say something good. I mean when it's time for me to lay it on the wood. And it ain't no time for no shecky, shecky. That's when I call on a black girl named Betty. Y'all looking for the only truth and it doesn't even exist. I just come to give love and peace and honor to all my children.

puppy chow,"This is a U-A rhyme, dedicate to the ca-nine. Tch-a-ch-tchk, c'mere boy, I said it's play-time. It's time to play with the mind of a slimmie. I don't wanna be a freak, but it's the dog in me. I don't pretend to be the open door roses type. I open the door for myself, and I close it right. in your face, now you wanna taste my food, what?. You got your own food, get a attitude. You get left, call the ref if you think it's foul. I ain't tryin to hear that, so have a Coke and a smile. Cause after awhile, I'ma wanna get BUCKwild. And now months laters, I'ma say it ain't my child. I'm sterile girl, we ain't never did nothin. Cause only you and I know that the Common Sense is bluffin. Little Miss Muffett, that's how the ball bounces. Sorry you gotta bounce the ball eight pounds and two ounces. That's how I'm livin, just like a rottweiler. When I was a shorty, I was a lot wilder. But then I got milder, and settled down with a harem. and when I can't bear em, I share em. You see it's like no, pass it off, pass pass the puss. I ain't a nerd, but WE'VE GOT BUSH. So cut the bush brat, and let's move it like a U-Haul. Forget the grindin shit, I ain't tryin to get the blueball. Brrrrrrrrap bump me child, I'm speakin upon the nitty gritty. I'm a dog -- HERE KITTY KITTY. ... Zippidy-doo-dah, a zippidy-zippidy-day. Unzip your zipper baby, and come my way. I'm Jack the Ripper, na-nah not Jack Tripper. Cause Three is not Company when your other two friends are thicker. So come one friend, come two friend, come all. United we stand, divide your legs so I can fall. in your bowl of cherries, Kerrie is so very. thick thicker than the Dick Tom and Harry. Tom and Jerry (WHAT?) A Woody Woodpecker. You need body work, I work that body, I'm a bodywrecker. Intersector, I'm the nectar plus the plum. I manage to take advantage, cause some of these hoes are so dumb. If you got some, just an eensy BIT of game. then it's safe to say it's that bet you can get a dame. I shoot, aim the same game, yo obedientally. Tell em that I get the drawers come off immediately. Here comes a nut slut, and we can do the Beat Street strut. and be that I'm a mutt -- so what?. No but if's or maybe baby, look who's talkin to. It's true when I'm drunk I might bone anything that's walkin. down the street, watchin ladies. Nobody's watchin you, because you got a baby. I ain't tryin to be a stepfather so I don't bother. Word to mommy dearest, I look farther. Down the road, to a road not taken. I'm tired of all these same bitches, I need to take care. a new flower, so Joe can take a shower. and get wet, and then jet. like ahhhh, seven-forty-seven. I tell the girls my number 7-7-7-ninety-three-eleven. Then I'm steppin, so when they call me, you'll hear. ""Is Common there?"" Uh-uh, sorry. you got the wrong number, if you wonder I'm the lumberjack. Choppin down the cherry tree and never comin back. It's like that and it'll be like that. Because a dog is a woman's best friend black."
raw (how you like it),"La la la la la. La la la la la. [Verse 1]. Bow! Bow!. I came through the door with the raw Martin Margiela superstar status. Everything stellar, with some bad bitches and some ex-drug sellers. Niggas already jealous, we in this joint like Bob Marley and The Wailers. She already wanna pick, bitch don’t be so over zealous. Go to the bar to get around like a propeller. The bar maid’s name is Stella. I’m so appalled like McCartney, would you record me. Am I really mad? Hardly, I’m here to party. One of y’all to give me body like Lati-fah. Niggas in the corner smoking that ree-fa. Seen a girl she had bottom like a speak-er. Wanna put some hands on her like a preach-er. Hmmmm! Well let me take my time. She ordered Bacardi, getting twisted in the limelight. Seen that ass cause I got hindsight. She was lit shining bright in a fit that was tight. ‘Bout to get that invite to a night over Egypt. She said “You rap?” Yea mummy. I’m Tutankhamun kicking it, spending this rap money. [Hook] x2. Feels so good. I wanna touch somebody. So let’s go, go. Wanna feel you close, keep touching. [Bridge] x4. La la la la la, how you like it. [Verse 2]. She was all couture, in a Tom Ford. Security guard let me in cause I’m lord. Of finesse, the under, the rings, the dress. Code is to always stay fresh. Aware of a chest cause I stay abreast. She was extra cold, I’m here to de-congest. This nigga next to us was slopped and made a mess. Knocking over bar stools, I hoped that he carpooled. I’m locked into my mood, Long as dude don’t disturb my groove. I won’t have to take it back to high school. Rewind! No need to take me back in time. Keep my mind on the grind and the great feline. Cause what’s in front of me is this behind. Up north she’s thick, down south she’s fine. Tuned in to what I’m doing. I’m so unassuming when I’m pursuing. The ladies, the ladies, a soldier of love like Sade. So in love to this lady when this nigga tried to play me. Saw me talking to slim and started acting shady. Dude got foul like crack in the 80s. Uh, uh, uh! You don’t wanna test this yo. You never know who got a check up in the disco. “You Hollywood.” Nah nigga, I’m Chicago. So I cracked his head with a motherfucking bottle. [Hook] x2. Feels so good. I wanna touch somebody. So let’s go, go. Wanna feel you close, keep touching. [Bridge] x4. La la la la la, how you like it"
real nigga quotes,"Common:. One two, one two, one two. Yo, I be the Big Illinois, here to build and destroy. I come on your deck, on your set. On your strip, through your burrough. Rippin any muthafucka that steps towards me. Yeah, I got power like floors be. Yo, check it out y'all. Real nigga quotes I tote, got some shit on the free but. This some shit that I wrote, legendary like the goat. Who got game?. Giving a quarter rest while I make these quarter notes. My album, niggaz was expectin, now my water broke. Before it, I was sorta broke. Get the paper for the funnies, sports and the horoscope. On a curry goat, like flu stokes order coke. You sharp with your rings and chain but you short a rope. At the end of the road trip still, I'ma hold shit down like syndrome. Rappers are like Fox Brown tryin to get home. Rarely get your touchdown, I'm in the end zone. You can't honor what I'm on, then bitch nigga, get gone. >From the wind storm, I've been told the street folklore. Body language spoke raw, don't talk to broads that are spoke for. That provokes war, stand out like cold sores. You claim that you hard but you wholecore. George Bush and CIA, you movin old or. Write like mention for publishin but you sold yours. chorus: Dug Infinite. Com got rhymes, Dug make beats. Style complete, plus unique, the shit be sweet. (on the real)You know the shit be real(x5). (down on the real to real). Common:. Chicka-chicka-M-chicka-C-chicka-M and my. People call me Com and collective with prospective. I draw crowds, go off like car alarm sounds. Bomb like 'Nam sounds, tell yo bitch to calm down. Unless you want to get me skull askin me to take my hat off. On ill raps, I spit as if I had a bad cough. This Craig nigga stole a style and ain't take the tag off. Playin yourself, you can't come with it, so you jack off. More heart than an artery, jones in my bones. To see thugs in harmony, it's gonna be some drama. If you try to sit Com down, this ain't comedy. Shit is real like a station property, crew is formin colonies. Commonly, I hear these rats thinkin they mahogany. On every rap hook, soundin like a dog to me. In a reservoir, I flow and go. On and on, like Erykah or etcetera. Designated not to make hits but hit home. Out of proportion, hit makers get blown. (scratching)(on the real). chorus: Dug Infinite. Common:. R and B studs kill me with they hardcore ballads. Love songs is violent, them niggaz whole style is silent. I hate to Staple the singers together, but in my head. It's been ringin forever...and a day if you grew up on Marvin Gaye. Where all you singers booty this and freak me baby, it gets me. MCs be insecure, like them little hoe niggaz Immature. Wearin bobs, if I got a show in your town, I'm there with mob. Bukein niggaz and pullin broads is the apparent job. (scratching)(on the real). chorus(x2). (don't front)(echoed)."
real people,"""Real People"". [Intro]. Yeah, yeah, you know how me and 'Ye do. [Verse 1]. Real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin'. Often it's beef this city never does. People walk and talk in they sleep. Cold sweats and wet dreams. On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep. Black souls raw and they deep. Hypes tryna talk with no teeth. Shorties sayin' ball or retreat. A lesson we all speak at one point or another. Whatchu expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother. Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region. Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'. We want decent homes. So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep em on. It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on. I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong. Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn. Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs. For the real people. [Verse 2]. I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie. Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me. They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi. The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi. We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs. We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge. They say the dope game is sour. Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours. Come to your crib and devour all that you work for. Must be more than paper these niggaz hurt for. Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays. Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality. Heard that it's drama at home. Can a dude break free and still get honored at home. I was told by a chief it's the games nature. When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya. It's real people. [Verse 3]. Black men walking wit white girls on they arms. I be mad at em as if I know they moms. Told to go beyond the surface, a person's a person. When we lessen our women our condition seems to worsen. The weary cursin' the sky. Talkin' to themselves givin' the version of why help and hurt in they eye. I live across from it, some of it I do be in. I be showin' niggaz lives. Like UPN. It's real people. Yeah.. For you and yours. Good music. Forever. Yeah. Rock on. We keep on. Uh.. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. The real..."
remaning me of (sef),"[Common]. Yeah, yeah, what, yeah. Reminding me of Sef, what?. Fat fat thick booty, what?. You say jack that big booty, yo. He say OOH OH. I heard the boy he said OOH OH. The party people he said OOH OH. Uhh uh uh uhh yo yo yo. Check it, check it. Driftin on a memory, brought forth. from a fifth of Hennesey, as in times. of eighty-nine they envision me. Warm days and the cold beer chemistry. Eventually broken up by responsibilities and such. Sometimes this era mentally I reconstruct. High school I came out it. Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted. Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit. My niggaz be fuckin girls that she hang out with. Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'. Arguin over if he said, ""Dumb bitch"". Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin the sun twist. Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit. Afterparties in Wendy's parkin lot, unfamiliar faces got marked a lot. Showin off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box. That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped. Chorus: Chantay Savage. It's remind-ing... mmm whooahhh yeahhh. It's remind-ing... heyyeahhahh, uh-huh. [Common]. Check it. Before these minds got ahold to some drugs. and start thinkin they thugs. We'd be at the Bismarck, and the Racquetball club. Plugged with Gucci promotion so we got in free. Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beatin. Saved my day, dancin on speakers. Flames snatched I was born this way. 87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin. Over gossip, Kenwood bras was pourin. Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models. and started coach out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas. Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD. I would quote, stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke. behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny. It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji. Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew. I'da go through it or, take it, we was bound to. Travellin like Vice Lords, down to the taste. Not wantin to bring my lady around crew cause they would snake. House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up. at em' I did the Hooper dance with my thumbs up. Chorus. [Common]. There go the break. To get the break go, it go OOH OH. Yeah, it go OOH OH. You heard the people they go oh oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh. Yo, check it, check it. Nowadays niggaz is fake, like that party at McCormick Place. I don't draw with em, cause they was born to trace. At times I contemplate movin to a warmer place. Then the Lake and skyline, give me a warm embrace. remindin me of the pointed parties Moe used to mace. Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin Twilight Tone tapes. Come home late callin broads hang up on they mother. If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at then we would fight each other. Get a room at the Dunes havin bakeouts. We'd eat, at Giadonno's and break out. Then everybody thought that they could spend. High rollers had the MCM blazer blend. Girbauds and Guess jeans we was takin in. Cranes and freight trains we was breakin in. Tim a be basin Mike down at I.I.T.. Rememberin numbers depended on how high I'd be. It's a Deja-Brew, when I see bottles of Gill. My man Sef passed I feel hollow but still. Chorus."
reminding me,"[Featuring Chantay Savage]. [Common]. Yeah, yeah, what, yeah. Reminding me of Sef, what?. Fat fat thick booty, what?. You say jack that big booty, yo. He say OOH OH. I heard the boy he said OOH OH. The party people he said OOH OH. Uhh uh uh uhh yo yo yo. Check it, check it. Driftin on a memory, brought forth. from a fifth of Hennesey, as in times. of eighty-nine they envision me. Warm days and the cold beer chemistry. Eventually broken up by responsibilities and such. Sometimes this era mentally I reconstruct. High school I came out it. Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted. Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit. My niggaz be fuckin girls that she hang out with. Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'. Arguin over if he said, ""Dumb bitch"". Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin the sun twist. Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit. Afterparties in Wendy's parkin lot, unfamiliar faces got marked a lot. Showin off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box. That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped. Chorus: Chantay Savage. It's remind-ing... mmm whooahhh yeahhh. It's remind-ing... heyyeahhahh, uh-huh. [Common]. Check it.

resurrection,"Verse One:. I stagger in the gathering possessed by a patter-in. That be scatterin. Over the globe will my vocals be travellin. Unravellin my abdomen it's slime that's babblin. Grammatics that are masculine. I grab them in, verbally badgerin broads. I wish that Madelline, was back on Video LP. I went against all odds and got a even steven. Proceed to read and not believin everything I'm readin. But my brain was bleedin, needin feedin, and exercise. I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize. I analyze where I rest my eyes. And chastise the best of guys with punchlines. I'm Nestle when it's Crunch-time. For your mind like one time. If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine. cause I deliver like the Sun-Times. Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine. I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I unswine. Eatin beef sometimes I try to cut back on that shit. This rap shit is truly outta control. My style is too developed to be arrested. It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole. They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell. I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail. A misdemeanor fell on his knee for the jury. I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me. Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints. They relinquished since, cause I was guilty in a sense. Verse Two:. I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light. I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight. Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe. Imaginations in flight. I send light, like Ben's kite I've been bright. Get open like on gym nights. And in fights I send rights. Don't hook with skins my friends like. I spend nights up in dykes. In spite I've been indicted as a freak of all trades. I got it made. I bathe in basslines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums. Come from a tribe of bums. Hooked on negro and mums. Had to halt with the, malt liquor. Cause off the malt liquor I fought niggaz. Now my speech is lost quicker. Cruisin Southside streets with no heat and no sticker. U Ak got my back and we don't get no thicker. U Ak got my back and we don't get no thicker. U Ak got my back and we don't now check it. I'm a hoe but not a hoe nigga, ain't scared of no nigga. But it's my turn to go I gotta go. And I'm gone with the storm."
resurrection '95,"ntro:. Yeah I'ma get this one off for Eighty-Seven Street. South side of Chicago, Chicago everywhere check it. It's like c'mon y'all, get live get down. Common Sense is in your town. I said c'mon y'all, get live get down. Common sense is in your town. Verse One:. I stagger in the gathering possessed by a patter-in. That be scatterin. Over the globe will my vocals be travellin. Unravellin my abdomen it's slime that's babblin. Grammatics that are masculine. I grab them in, verbally badgerin broads. I wish that Madelline, was back on Video LP. Raps I make up like blacks do excuses. I feel like Noah, hookin my mellows up on deuces. If a broad ain't got a mind or job or crib she useless. Acoustic basslines embrace rhymes while I chase mines. They say signs of the end is near. I wonder can I walk a righteous path holdin a beer. Got more verses than a Kramer, go off like a pager. Skills uglier than Craig Mack in your ear I'm the flavor. My old bird said some of my songs sound like noise. Don't watch the Bulls as much, they got too many white boys. A million black men walkin, towards one direction. For sure, the cream of the planets... resurrection. Verse Two:. A prophet, raised among black disciples and Vice Lords. Who don't give a fuck about mic cords and nice swords. get up, together black risk your cup. I'm wishin for a change, my man want his change in a cup. Yessir, I'm in the Mix-a-Lot. Bitches put em on the glass while I'm puttin stickers on they ass. I rule everything around me like cash. On the rocks of reality, dreams get smashed. In jams I M*A*S*H like Alan Alda. Niggaz nod, they say hey as if I was Little Walter. Eighty-Seven strip walker taught the code of the area. by staying, within the barrier. Exposed to stony stimuli, with that I identify. Brothers went through my rotate solidify the realness. Skull-caps, Murf Puffy jacket, Lug boots on. Steppin to me is like goin to the county being a Neutron. Verse Three:. I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike. When in dim light. I use insight to enlight. Device up in da skin tight. Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe. Imaginations in flight. I send light, like Ben's kite I've been bright. Get open like on gym nights. And in fights I send rights. Don't hook with skins my friends like. I spend nights up in dykes. I've been indicted as a freak of all trades. I got it made. I bathe in basslines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums. Come from a tribe of bums. Hooked on negro and mums. Had to halt with the, malt liquor. Cause off the malt liquor I fought niggaz. Now my speech and thoughts quicker. Cruisin Southside streets with no heat and no sticker. U Ak got my back and we don't get no thicker. Eighty-Seven got my back and we don't get no thicker. Chicago got my back and we don't now check it. I'm a ho but not a ho nigga. Ain't scared of no nigga. But it's my turn to go I gotta go. And I'm gone with the storm."
retrospect for life,"Yo, we gotta start respectin life more y'all. You look at your brother man you gotta see yourself. Gotta see the God within him. Brothers gettin changed real quick over nothin. We losin too many of ours. Gotta recreate y'all. Yo, check it. Knowin you the best part of life, do I have the right to take yours. Cause I created you, irresponsibly. Subconciously knowin the act I was a part of. The start of somethin, I'm not ready to bring into the world. Had myself believin I was sterile. I look into mother's stomach, wonder if you are a boy or a girl. Turnin this woman's womb into a tomb. But she and I agree, a seed we don't need. You would've been much more than a mouth to feed. But someone, I woulda fed this information I read. to someone, my life for you I woulda had to leave. Instead I lead you to death. I'm sorry for takin your first breath, first step, and first cry. But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially. Havin a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me. Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family. I don't wanna, go through the drama of havin a baby's momma. Weekend visits and buyin J's ain't gon' make me a father. For a while bearing a child is somethin I never wanted to do. For me to live forever I can only do that through you. Nerve I got to talk about them niggaz with a gun. Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son. I could have sacrificed goin out. To think my homies who did it I used to joke about, from now on. I'ma use self control instead of birth control. Cause $315 ain't worth your soul. $315 ain't worth your soul. $315 ain't worth it. [Lauryn Hill (two layers of vocals, same words)]. I, never dreamed you'd leave, in summer. You said you would be here when it rained. [Common] Yo. Why didn't you stay. Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself. You had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt. But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are. Through our trials and tribulations, child's elimination. An intergration of thoughts I feel about the situation. Back and forth my feelings was pacin. Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it. But even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it. Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust. Bustin, more than the sweat in somebody you trust. Or is it that we don't trust each other enough. And believe, havin this child'll make us have to stay together. Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better. Thinkin we all in love cause we can spend a day together. We talkin spendin the rest of our lives. It's too many black women that can say they mothers. but can't say that they wives. I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding. But I want our Parenthood to come from Planning. It's so much in my life that's undone. We gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one. If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from. But I'm walkin, findin myself in my God. So I can, discipline my son with my writin. Not have a judge tellin me how and when to raise my seed. Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame. I had a book of Afrikan names, case our minds changed. You say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy. So quit smokin the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy. [Lauryn Hill]. I, never dreamed you'd leave in summer. You said you would be here when it rained. You said you would be here when it rained. Ohh I, never dreamed you'd leave in summer. Now the situation's made things change. Things change. Why, didn't you stay. Why didn't you stay.... I, never dreamed you'd leave, in summer. In summer. You said you would be here when, it rained. When it rained, it rained. Ohhhohh I, never dreamed, you'd leave in summer. You said you wouldn't leave. Now the situation's made things change. Things change, why didn't you stay?. Stay, stay stay stay stay stay stay. Mmmmm, stayyy. Uh-uh. Ohh why didn't you stay..."

soul by the pound,"""Gimme a pound, thank you man"" --> Tim Dog. (repeat 2X, then 4X faster). I'm as bad bad, as Leroy Brown Brown. Yo I'm a pro pro, but not a noun noun. If you got beef beef, then you'll get ground ground. Cut up in soul soul, by the pound pound. I'm going downtown like Julie Brown, I'm the round mound. Not a rebound, but like a hound, I get down down. Never wore a leash but I get loose. Producin somethin fresher than fruits, got more soul than combat boots. Diggin two scoops of raisins for the troops out of some blazers. so amazin like Luther everyday Joe but not Bazooka. I used to be a hooper but now I troop to shoot a free flow. Me go with mi amigo, to see the Man named Chico. The legal alienaeno, I roll the instrumentals. Like Jack I be like Nimble never gentle to a bimbo. Not your sex symbol so save that soft stuff for the Care Bears. The way I freak funk OHHHH the Monkees sayin, ""Hell yeah"". Correction, ""Hell yes""; old folks wanna cuss. on how I walk talk and dress, they say my life's a mess. But I'm straight, are you straight, if you straight, then I'm straight. Rock me tonight, just for old time's sake. Back to our regularly scheduled program, program. I am so damn flam, I slam a slam, BAM, I slam. like Conan the Barbarian, if you talk loud, I'll play librarian. Cause see I want it quiet in here.... I Mark a Markyiana a bunch of funky Uncle Thomases. Play like Christopher Williams cause I gotta keep my promises. to stick to my roots and not dilute cause G this ain't two colors. I'm tired of seein these non rappin dancin motherfuckers. ""Gimme a pound, thank you man"" --> Tim Dog. (repeat 4X). For a record sale a nigga'll sell his soul to go gold. and reach a large scale, sellin for the pale male. and I can't tell, why for a hoe you grow a tail. and stop drinkin ale, the booty probably smell. Ain't no pussy worth a sale at least not for the kid to do a bid. Shit you musta flipped you lid, you was wit you slipped you slid. Got doodoo skids on my paper cause I got rhymes up the ass. If I pass gas, ducks fast or gets trimmed like a mustache. I must ask what's goin on with rap, white kids actin black. It's like McDonald's sellin fatback. Get back to your Mac, that stuff is wack with all these dancetracks. I'm hearin rap from Antrhax, my time the Caravan cracks. You're wack, that's the only thing that's black Scooter. When we was on the streets, you was at home on your computer. I'ma shoot a diss well like a fist to all these wack groups. Rhymes are wack as hell! And they sample wack loops. I'm wonderin how the hell they get a deal I still can't see that far. I feel like Cypress Hill, I could just kill an A&R. or whoever's in Charge, it surely ain't Charles. but you ain't G-in hip-hop, cause it's ours. ""Gimme a pound, thank you man"" --> Tim Dog. (repeat 4X). It's sick you sick I'm sicker, I flick a flea flicker. Think of thatI boa constrictor but the venom I inflicta. is stricter, I stick I stick the stinkin to a stunk. If soda was a forty dog, then I would be like drunk. If if was a fifth I would lift the fifth and a spliff. it's not a myth about our dick width, I'm swift and I shoot the presents. In essence count your blessings I got a Wessun if you riff. I'm a nigga with SOULLLLLLLLLL, my last name should be Smith-sonian. I'm gassin girls heads, just like petroleum. Get em ready to bone me and, then I play custodian. and turn off the lights this is the likes of a. ticketing wallowing high jumping radio rumping brother. Got Seoul like Korea gimme an inch I'll take a liter. A chick is a chick that's how I treat her. never go pop I'm not a two liter. A true leader, don't choose to follow, choose what I swallow. whether water or a beer bottle, of course I play the lotto. Wear em? No, share em? A hoe. I like the girls the girls I share a life with a bro. cause U-A-C is family, much tighter than foundations. that holds up the walls, so you better proceed with caution. ""Gimme a pound, thank you man"". ""Gimme a pound"" (4X)."
soul power,"[Intro]. Yeah, for the world!. Keep going so you can(yo you can rock on). We keep going so you can (yo you can rock on). We keep going so you can (yo you can rock on). We keep going. [Verse 1]. Nigga breath can tell by how you rap you don't believe. Ain't hungry no mo' so off me you feed. I hustle at a speed between greed and need. On the streets where intuition and weed are breed. Shoot the gift and viff, at the myths uplift. My rhyme the clip its like the boom bip to tip(q). In gangways where cats that rhyme the same way. Spending nites over Egypt to learn a brave day. Paint a picture of the ghetto like JJ. You the Ray J Of this rap world. I travel the globe with a black girl name Becky. Grand like Auto Theft 3. Style so developed the law cant arrest me. You walk with blood on your shirt. Like Jesse Jackson trying to test the reaction of the people. See thru trying to out act Don Cheadle. I speak to original Hebrew s you know how we do. And bleed thru the needle with truth. That needs no preview to proof its in the people. And how they react still in the business of smacking. Rappers is wack you had a dope track I guess opposites. attract my mind state is black. Black like bernie mack no cowards soul power in the words we rap. [Verse 2]. Picks with fist, thick grease, dark nipples. My guy buy ice I search for the dark crystal. Racing for paper these broads is starter pistols. I spit thru gang wars and strange doors. Out the sky flames pour the beats claims war. I see niggaz with flags who they waving them for?. I'm the nigga that you put the chain on the door for. The nigga that you started changing the laws for. Orator of hard-core and more. My raps the portal for the blue collar. Than made a hit and came up on a few dollars. I'd rather listen to silence then you holla. Borrowed your persona from the late that made dear mama. My realness is my armor that I wear up in this boy. For truth your a decoy. Common Sense is like the future of the Bee-boy. I fall down and get up like Don McClerken. Hit puss and listen to it whistle while I'm trerkin. Break it down like herb. The nympho of info I'm fucking what you heard. You ain't ready for war your stuck in the reserves. I mastered my high so I'm bucking at the birds. I been wanted to fly so now I do it with the words. For those in the fast-lane I show you how to merge. Get your own you see its like home grown herb black economics. The people we serve with Soul Power."
southside,"La, la, la, la, la – and e'rybody say. La, la, la, la, la – I know you, I know you.... I know you're thinking, thinking that it must be. I'm a raw flow cause it never get rusty. I aint gotta say it, man dawg trust me. Bust somebody head, T.L.C. where was we?. Still rock the prada 'fore that, rock the Starter. Niggas out in Georgetown, and Magic way harder. Thinking back to the projects, and they way they tore 'em all up. Like when I do a project, and come back and tear the mall up. [Chorus]. We coming from the... South (side), South (side). South (side), South (side). South (side), South (side). South (side), Side of the Chi. The broads, the cars, the half moon, the stars. I'm like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars. Burn cd's with no regard for the stars. Come to the grip with conflict, diamonds and the arts. Back in '94 they call me Chi-town's Nas. Now them niggas know I'm one of Chi-town's gods. We even yo, you're still talking no cause. A conscious nigga with mac like Steven Jobs. [Chorus]. We coming from the... South (side), South (side). South (side), South (side). South (side), South (side). South (side), Side of the Chi. Your fly is open, McFly. The crowd is open I think I know why. I'm back from the future seen it with my own eyes. And yep, I'm still the future of the Chi. Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon. I knew that I couldn't cop a coup with no coupons. Look at that neutron on his green like two dimes. People asking him, “Do you have any grey poupon?”. [Chorus]. We coming from the... South (side), South (side). South (side), South (side). South (side), South (side). South (side), Side of the Chi. You in the building but the buildings falling. You wouldn't be ballin' if your name is Baldwin. My mind get flooded I think about New Orleans. Back in school, ya'll niggas you should call in August. Summer sun it goes down but I'm still revolving. Southside 'bout to walk it out, I still get crawling. If rap was Harlem, I be James Baldwin. With money in the bank like G. Rap, we're calling. [Chorus]. We coming from the... South (side), South (side). South (side), South (side). South (side), South (side). South (side), Side of the Chi. With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera. Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas. Can't wait till they say, “Yeah, he ran up at the Oscars.”. Poppa, I heard his life is like a movie. Like when Em' played him and Mekhi played a rasta. Mexican don't love it like it was for La Raza. But this is for the mobsters, Holla. We some true chi-town legends, accept no imposters. [Chorus]. We coming from the... South (side), South (side). South (side), South (side). South (side), South (side). South (side), Side of the Chi. Uh, the un-American idol, tower like the Eiffel. Lean wit it, rock wit it, back like the disciples. Know when to use a bible, and when to use a rifle. You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle. Caught a case of robbery, and 'Beat It' like Michael. Your career is a typo, mine was written like a haiku. I write to 'Do the Right Thing' like Spike do. Do crime fixed is crucial and trauma is psycho. [Chorus]. We coming from the... South (side), South (side). South (side), South (side). South (side), South (side). South (side), Side of the Chi. La, la, la, la, la, la, la-la. La, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la. We're coming from the...Hey!. *scratches*.. spice it up (la, la , la..).

speak my piece,"Ye, that's my nigga from back in the day. All that whoop-de-wah-whop, man, fuck what they say!. Played the lotto for my gran' with a bottle in hand. Lay it down for the world, for Chicago I stand, and. I'm iller than most, sick with it, feelin' the dose. In a butter soft leather but I'm still with the toast. Toast to brawls, you know, the millions is close. Feel the ghost of Notorious, tell me who the naughty is. She get live like an audience. I do what I do, no need to state the obvious. Poli' with girls with bodies like uh, poli' in hotel lobbies. Light a J, it's just me and Marley, look at the poster. Do what I supposed to for the culture.

And go to L. A. to get hay. In the middle of the barn with a princess I lay. Yo, this time of shit happens every-hmm, once in a while. You know I won't front with the style. Bring life to the party like a woman and child. From the land of the humble and proud, summers is wild. Ah! Made the unmadeable! Ah! Go to parties I'm paid to go!. Me and Cuzzo talked the hustle. About doing good business like Rick and Russell. You I know I guzzle red wine till it's bed time. On my paper like headlines, she want the head shine. Er'time, my time, the streets is watchin' like a Rollie. Do it for the hometown and the homies, uh. I just, speak my piece, keep my peace. Cubans with the Jesus piece, with my peeps. Packing, my piece, Jesus. Packing, my piece, Jesus"

stay schemin' (drake diss),"My motto is: chicago, bitch. Everybody know you sweet, what the problem is. Don't play dumb, i'm the one that acknowledged it. Son of a bitch, i imagine what your father is. She said, ""how you make your opponent. The rapper of the moment?"" his style, he don't own it. Acting all hard when he hardly like that. You gon' mess around and make me catch a body like that. Don't do it. Because every song you make, joe, is really ho music. I heard you said you wasn't a bitch because you sing. You a bitch because you cling like a bitch that's eighteen. Can't say my name or rap about a nigga's wife. You so black and white, trying to live a nigga's life. I'm taking too long with this amateur guy. You ain't wet nobody, nigga, you canada dry. Soft nigga. make no mistake, i'm talking to drake. It's the remix. rick ross, common, and that ho ass nigga. No, man-to-man, don't hide behind them other niggas. Nah, this man-to-man. you can't run behind them man. This is some real man shit right here. Say my name, say my name. If no one is around you. If you ain't running game. Say my name, say my name. You acting kinda shady. Why the sudden change?. Say my name, say my name. If no one is around you. If you ain't running game. Say my name, say my name. You acting kinda shady. Better say my name"
stolen moments pt. i,"Common:. Down da-down-da-down-down-down, what(x3). Down-da-down, check it, check it. There was a Hardy boy mystery I was tryin to solve. Can't understand who the fuck was involved. Back from a show I had came, hopped off the plane. In my mind home was pictured and rest was the frame. My God came and grabbed in something less than a Caddy. Go buy them gas and food was less than a cabby. As we approach my tilt, paranoia in my bones had built. By the lock on the door, a hole was drilled. I opened it to the kitchen floor my heart nailed. In my shit, somebody had broke in like a mitt. My mind started swingin and who I thought the glove fit. As usual, niggaz is suspects. Who did I tell I was going out of town. Not too many people, I guess the word got around. The people upstairs should have been disturbed by the sound. Must have came during the day when at work, they was found. At the mount I stand folded than tie. Askin who done it. Fuck Hitchcock, I got the fifth cocked. About to go wild hunted. Whoever did it had the nerve to chill and get blunted. And left a roach in the ash tray, I had cleaned out the last day. Before I left, this thief decided to play chef. With the beef in the fridge to cook chicken breast. I'm kickin what shit was left all around the house. Thinkin whoever came in on me is out. chorus. It's a frantic situation. It's a frantic situation, yes it is. (What can I do?). It's a frantic situation. It's a frantic situation, hear me now. (What can I do?). It's a frantic situation. It's a frantic situation, yes it is. (What can I do?). It's a frantic situation. It's a frantic situation, hear me y'all. (What can I do?)."
stolen moments pt. ii,"Black Thought:. It's a frantic situation(x7). Common:. Extra salty cuz whoever beat me, got me for this 31-inch. And this Alpha Bailey jacket I had just bought me. Out of snappin, my God tried to talk me. But what could get me half way calm was this Donny Hathaway song. The tape that it was on I had wanted while I was gone. But forgot to pack it, in fact it was in that jacket. This demo, it's time to track it and lay it down. Either it's somebody I know or somebody I stay around. Day before I broke out, niggaz was over my crib gettin smoked out. No tellin who had the place scoped out. Donnie brought over some niggaz I didn't know. I'm askin, who are you, they said I'm with the Mo. If it was them, soon I will collide with them. And they better not be rockin no new Iversons. Then it could have been this hype that usually shovel my snow. If I'm out of town or not, by my car, he would know. Now, it might have been this stripper I met at Pinkhouse party. Thick, but my furniture wasn't worth her body. What if it was this nigga I let sleep in my crib. To have the set of keys but that I wasn't tryin to believe. But I could have put it past him or those other bastards. It would be assed backwards for me to ask if they did it. Cuz whoever did ain't gon admit it. The blunted dirty dishes is my only exhibit. Wondering if I should give it a rest and through the wind. It might surface. Cuz tellin Allah, Joe is worthless(uh). chorus(x2): Black Thought. Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are(x3). Wherever you are, whoever you are. Check it out."
stolen moments pt. iii,"[Featuring Q-Tip]. Q-Tip:. Hey , hey, hey, hey,. Hey, who dat? Hey, who dat?. Hey, who dat? Check it, what. Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are(x2). Hey sucka nigga, hey sucka nigga. Whoever you are, whoever you are. Common:. Fuck waitin under my skin, the situation is scrapin. Somewhat like the girl X-ratin. It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation. Knowing your Rockports, somebody may be lacin. Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation. Without somebody breakin in my demonstration. For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net. It certain things about this I ain't figure yet. Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys. Because his job had been stopped smokin weed. Thursdays is off days, he usually watch his seed. For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need. The stripper broad, my TV and couch, she couldn't carry it. Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with. She was vegeterian and she wouldn't have cooked chicken. I confronted her with it, to her story, she was stickin. The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this hype. Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bike. Chances of him breakin in, chillin and eatin. Are about as slim as he is. Though I knew where he lived. In his house with three kids, one I was cool with. As we roll, I told the guy, turn on the music. Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect. The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck. (Excerpt from a movie). Just tell me why. Don't lie to me man, just tell me why. It's the money, alright?. Just tell me why. It's the fuckin money, alright?. (fighting). Reynoldo, shoot that piece of shit. Q-Tip:. Know what I'm sayin. Word up. It ain't sweet when you do that shit(x7)."
sum shit i wrote,"Marks I erase like racism, I'm as large as a bigot. Groove is my escapism, when I'm bubbly I just kick it. What I need from you is understanding that I'm standing. On my own two, down with my own crew. Toe cancer, I'm bad to the bone too, I'm prone to snap off. When I'm off that Cognac I can't hold back like a massouse. I get loose like a screw turned from left right to tight. When it's time for some action I get Red's ""Tonight's Da Night"". An eye for an eye, a life for his wife. Dissected I'm on some hi-tech shit computers want to bite. Your style is Pascal, mine is Basic and just instinct. I'm with the fam and ran scams, me and Murray got up on big links. And if knowledge is the key, goddammit I'm the locksmith. Started a missionary way on my life, the mic I rust like bostage. I switch styles like a channel with controls that are remote. Engage in a page, and with words I elope. Walking down the aisles with styles I freak the viles. Anti-Nazi when I rocks like a Z-28. At any rate, brothers gain interest because I loaned them microphones. They couldn't house the shit so they had to rent to own. It's like that, coming from the go rapper. I wanna bone Jada Pinkett and that hoe Patra. So keep on, and you don't, now come on. Ah keep on, and you don't. Sometime when I'm alone in my room I stare at the wall. And in the back of my mind I hear a wack-ass rhyme. And I catch Alz-rhymers, then forget it, I get charged. Like a nigga in position with the stolen card the credit. Fuck flipping the script, the rap scene I'm trying to edit. My mellows call me ""Never"", they be like ""Never's going to get it"". Never's too much, I'm much too, I do justice to poetics. That's why cats be like ""Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!"". Other studs come through to see what I am up to. They be on the dick of crew that be giving us sweet and buying us fruit. Like Kareem I got the hook up, brothers look out because they look. Rest in peace to ?Heavena?, washing tons of rappers like Booker. Tee told me ""You gotta get out of the crib, get into the world"". How you going to come off with the style that's thourough?. It's like that, keep on, ha ha. It's like that, keep on. My foundation is in black block of niggas that rock they hat cock. I'm real like a fight with my rap, rappers I slapbox. Back I got my rap, now get your glock out the black face. Got tall flavor with fat taste, the rat race is a rat race. Just cause you got Adidas with the fat laces and the fro don't make you hip-hop. You sorry excuse for funk rap. Why is there so many cranks trying to rhyme, yo funk that. The real shit's starting to come back. The Go is where I'm from and where I'm at, jack. I started eating cat when I was 10. Before dinner I was getting big dog like Glen Robinson. I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind. But comes a time when you gotta get off of that booty. The facts of life I didn't learn from watching Tootie. But living in the big city but I still like Tootie cause she got big titties. My style is steep, I write rhymes on the incline. Splat guts plus fat nuts and lay up like a crib line. I'm slamming, jamming on the one. I'm a bad man, you're just a good son, come on."
take it ez,"Verse One:. I'm {easy} easy, easy like Sunday morning. I can kick a stupid nervous joint when I'm yawning. Ahhh, Common's comin with that old oh excuse me. Elizabeth, this is a big one, I mean a dewe-dewe. Doogie, Howser, cause see I'm like Bowser. Kickin it with the sha-na-na-na, the t-shirt, and the. trousers, how's the, Family Ties?. I'm left with the gift, open it up, SUPRISE!. Big bat, filet-o-fish, quarter pounder french fries. Icy Coke, milkshake, sundaies and apple pies. And a cup? Nah, that's enough of that. I'm like an indian giver, yo, give me that back. Comin again hip-pop-pop-pop bring it back selector. We be the thoroughbred, so use your head, play the Trifecta. Common infector, smug MC, heads up!. Ya better duck cause muck-a-luck, it's me. [Now what's your name] Common. Come in again... Common. [How would you do it] Common. [Now how was she] Common, check it out!. Common is coming soon to a theater near you. To the U-A-C crew, nuff respect due. Do I do, where I do, when I do. I do do do, yo I do it on the ease. Verse Two:. I be kickin it with the doubly-dope rhymer. I'm trippin-and-dippin-and-slippin with the rhyme like Sli-mer. [Who ya gonna call?] Ghostbuster. I'm pee-wee we stole, and I'm just a. Hustler, I tried to scheme for a sec. But the record got wreck, tried to write a bad check. So I checked myself, before self got buck. wild, tried to live how I had to fluctuate. To a snake, and metriculate, yo I had to elevate. You can tell it's great, cause I'm state. of 87, the South side of Chicago. Five-oh-one come follow me yo, everywhere that I go. And I know I ain't did nuthin [hell naw]. The district think I be just a lil trick kid frontin. U Ak got my back if there's any contact. In the back is a track from Immenslope soul cat. And it's phat, sorta like Oprah before she lost weight. I put my rhymes in good hands, hey like All State. And I'm all in a state of ease, utopia. I'm the Spiderman, givin bug MC's arachnaphobia. Holy-molia, it's totally awesome. The survey say, I gets moe skins than Richard Dawson. But I won't catch mono or no type of disease. Cause when I flex, for sex, I do it on the ease. Verse Three:. A lop bop a woo bop, a lop bam boogie. I'm a Dr. Pepper, wouldn't you like to be a Pepper. two-steppin through, yodel-le-hee-hoo!. Oui oui mon cheri, a como tale vouz?. [Contraire mon frere] OK, to the death. Is it true that I'm dope? {Yeahhhh!}. Yippedy yes y'all, here we go a loopedy loop de loo. A hubbeda hula hoop, a hubbeda alley oop to Coop. I gots the Magic, but I'm not a Laker. I'm shakin-and-bakin-and-takin, cause I'm the back-board. break her arm and feather, whippin the wonder when she activates. Hold up! My jaws are in my crack, [aight] pass the tape. Time to activate, and ejaculate. This is the beauty of where I'm in a state. I meant to say demonstrate. I'm in a state, where I've had too much eight, ball. In the corner pocket, count em, buck it. A chicken, a finger-lickin with a finger-bone. C'mon I'm on a roll, stippedy stutter-roll. Owah-owah-owah-owah Ayatoll. of Khomein, my domain is infinite. Ya got trouble, well you need to get some dick. and to the hip-hop shop, the future shock. When we started kickin on the one two, and ya don't stop. But the buck stops here buckaroo. Ya got your instructions, now you know what to do. Take it easy."
tekzilla,"(featuring Hi-Tek). [Common]. On the streets on the side. I look a man in his face eye to eye. And wonder why. I don't wanna die. I hope you don't wanna die. So why bring it my way?. ""Common Sense in a ghetto in Chicago"". [Common]. Yo Tekzilla. You know I ain't the type to play killa. But this day still arrives in my mind like a flight on down. Thursday night had plans to be out. Till the night served daylight. But it ain't happen. Rappin' to myself cause there wasn't noone to rap to. This feeling came to me like somebody lookin' at you. There was these cats who me and my crew boxed against. Gotta - spotted the glock now the nigga's got some confidence. Cause I'm Common Sense and I rap consciousness. He was prop to dis mad cause my guy used to knock his bitch. I could sense he was tryin' to bring it. But I wasn't ready to receive it. In fact I made him leave it. Before he could achieve it. As we rolled through the streets of cottage grove. And reach the stoplight. Behind me, he flashed lights bright, sorta cop-like. I'm thinkin' Tupac-like cause he got out the car. I was taught only to fight in defense or the in will of Allah. And ain't no talking when it's time to spar. So before he popped some shit I did ??I act my shit is solo??. Back his lady trying to hold him like big pun. I stowed 'em and told 'em. I ain't'a shoot I just punch a lot. Between blows this nig' tried to up his glock. His brother watched spooked like a daddy on teenage love. He got 'buked til my tape I got sing like a dove. Got his dome into her. My fist brought back the one hand. Tried to pop it musta been a nine cause the gun jammed. Unplanned I disarm this trick nigga. Pistol-whipped his ass, his lady's I was palmin' it. Hollered '87 reign dominant. Needed a fight that night. Me and my woman had a argument. ""I guess I should tell you a little something about myself"". ""I bang with the big boys, those who obey"". [Common]. Hey now why you gotta hold yo' thang?. Scared to shoot, scared to shoot. Shoot for the revolut-. yo. Peace y'all Common Sense and Hi Tek. Traveling the world it's just a day in the life. Of real niggas."

testify,"[Common]. She walk into the court her knees buckle. Saying for a man to survive he needn't hustle. Seen and been through struggle her whole life. Made a transition from being his ho to his wife. Stifling, the night upend the ATF bust in. Her daddy was a hustla so she love them. Looked at the jury how can they judge him, she screamed. [sample]. Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away. Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away. Please let me testify. [Common]. Fear in her chest her face in tears, had her mans back he was facing years. In her name though the place was his. They trying to take everything except the kids.

Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away. Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away. Please let me testify. [Common]. The judge called for order the court reporter makin her words shorter. His lawyer sat next to him, she could see how the trial was affecting him. It hurt for her eyes to connect with him, using her lies for protecting him. They arrested him for murder, and gun possession. As they read back her confession she screamed. [sample]. Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away. Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away. Please let me testify. [Common].

the 6th sense,"The revolution will not be televised. The revolution is here. Yeah, it's Common Sense, with DJ Premier. We gonna help y'all see clear. It's real hip-hop music, from the soul, y'all. Yeah, check it, yo. The perseverence of a rebel I drop heavier levels. It's unseen or heard, a king with words. Can't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred. Dark spots in my mind where the scene occured. Some say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep. Through me, Muhammed will forever speak. Greet brothers with handshakes in ghetto landscapes. Where a man is determined by how much a man make. Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats. With cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear. Under the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped. Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap. Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back. You tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that. (Chorus:) (Scratched by DJ Premier with variations). ""This is rap for real, something you feel"". ""And you know, yes you know"". ""Rap for the black people"". ""Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy"". In front of two-inch glass and Arabs I order fries. Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes. I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies. Immortilized by the realness I bring to it. If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music. My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it. My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it. Through my shell, never knew what the divine would. bring to it. I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions. More than money saved, I wanna save children. Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity. A complex man drawn off of simplicity. Reality is frisking me. This industry will make you lose intensity. The Common Sense in me remembers the basement. I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake. shit. (Chorus). Somedays I take the L to gel with the real world. Got on at 87th, stopped by this little girl. She recited raps, I forgot where they was from. In 'em, she was saying how she made brothers cum. I start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected. How many dead folks this art resurrected. How many nations this culture connected. Who am I to judge one's perspective?. Though some of that shit y'all pop true it, I ain't relating. If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating. I just want to innovate and stimulate minds. Travel the world and penetrate the times. Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom. Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em. For now I appreciate this moment in time. Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's. like. (Chorus til fade)"
the believer (feat. john legend),"[john legend]. I believe in the light that shines and will never die. Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive. They will talk about us. Like they talked about the kings before us. They will talk about us. [common]. These are the words of a believer, achiever, leader of the globe. Feeding souls of those in need. I bleed the blood of the struggle. Walking over troubled puddles. Hustles in my chest, no hustle no progress. Extremities of life and it’s process. Birth of a son, death of another. With love I can rest both mothers. And told ‘em, who’s in control is the one thats above us. I walk where money talks and love stutters. Body language of a nation going through changes. The young become dangerous, pain gets spent into anger. Anger gets sent through the chamber. It’s tough when your own look like strangers. We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers. If he could how would ernie barnes paint us. Look at the picture, hard not to blame us. But time forgives and the chi where the young die often. Do they end up in a coffin because we haven’t taught them?. Is it what we talking we really aint walking. Dudes, hustlers pay, how much did it cost ‘em?. Find myself on the same corner that we lost ‘em. Real talking, in they ear like a walkman. Thoughts spin around the corner to the world. When I see them, I see my baby girl. Believe. [john legend]. I believe in the light that shines and will never die. Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive. They will talk about us. Like they talked about the kings before us. They will talk about us. [common]. The lord lives among us. The young uns hunger become a means to get it. By any means necessary, under pressure. Children feeling lesser, with the steel up on the dresser. Killin’ will aggressors, destiny’s children. Survivors, soldiers, in front of buildings they eyes look older. Hard to see blessings in the violent culture. Face against weapons, sirens, holsters. That aint the way that langston hughes wrote us. Soul controllers on the shoulders of moses and noah. We go from being oppressors to oprah. Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas. Today and the way that you can see we determined. Solar keeps burning, shawty’s know to keep learning. Lesson’s in our life, but life stripes that we earning. Took raps advice that christ is returning. Like a thief in the night, I write the beacons of light. For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys. Street kids spark rallies of the conscience conquerors of a contest. That seems beyond us, even through the unseen, I know that god watches. From one king’s dream he was able to barack us. The prophets, nothing can stop us. Believe. [john legend]. I believe in the light that shines and will never die. Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive. They will talk about us. Like they talked about the kings before us. They will talk about us. I know I know I know our dreams won’t turn to dust. They will talk about us. I know I know I know our dreams won’t turn to dust. They will talk about us. I know I know I know our dreams won’t turn to dust. They will talk about us"
the bitch in yoo,"(Yeah, for your nation.... for your nation...). Verse One:. A bitch nigga wit an attitude named Cube. Step to Com wit a feud. Now what the fuck I look like dissing a whole coast. You ain't made shit dope since AmeriKKKa's Most. Wanted to cease from the Midwest to the East. On the dick of the East for your 1st release. Your lease is up at the crib, house niggaz get evicted. And videos wit white boys talking you get Wicked. Natural Born Killa, nigga you natural born God. Look, read listen, got the nerve to say you rob. Hyprocrite, I'm filling out your Death Certificate. Slanging bean pies and St Ide's in the same sentence. Shoulda repented, on the 16th of October. Get some beats besides George Clinton to rock over. Rap career is over, better off acting. What trouble I see, you're managing WC and Wack 10. You backed in to a four corner hustla. Lying on your dick, said you was fuckin her. Use Higher Learning, don't take my words out of text. Went from gangsta to Islam to the dick of Das EFX. It'll take the Nation of Millions to Hold Me Back. From giving you mouth shots or hit wit the pipe Ralph got. When sucker ain't around, it's your Friday, it was good. I wasn't salty, she was wit the Boyz N the Hood. Chorus:. I see the bitch in you when you don't speak your mind. The bitch in you, looking me in my eyes lyin. I see the bitch in you, simply hard, you find. The bitch in you but yo it's coming out. Verse Two:. Up on this rap shit, Cube, I'm calling out. I break in and smack niggaz that's in the Slaughterhouse. This ain't no East coast, West coast, none of the above. I'm from Chi, I went to Cali, niggaz gave me love. There's a thin line between the fake and the real. Grafted ass nigga, I see through your Glass Shield. Had skills once upon a time on this project, yo. I'm a have ta wreck a Ho'shea. I heard a ho say you her favorite rapper. (So what) so I had to slap her, ugn. And violate you, a Muslim drinking brew. Your nigga ain't no Mack 10, he's a 22. I seen you, you ain't say shit to ATL. Cube, I like that diamond charm, I might cuff it, then sell. It out, like you sold Kam and Threat. A year ago, you wasn't talking shit about the West. Guess you knew you're shit was done plus the one got you cable. Hoo Bangin, you ain't banging shit but the table. And the Circle Madd, ain't got no choice but to fight. Ain't none of y'all muthafukas got a chance on the mic. Anytime you come out, yo, I'm a talk about you. Until you let that bitch in you, walk up out you. Any last words before I hit the switch. From the immortal words of one, a bitch is a bitch. Chorus."
the corner,"Verse 1:(Common). Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's. Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes. Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose. To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows. In they socks and they soles, niggaz holdin' they rolls. Corners leave souls opened and closed, hopin' for mo'. We know where to go, niggaz rollin' in droves. They shoot the wrong way, cuz they ain't know and they goes. The streets ain't safe cuz they ain't knowing the code. By the foes I was told, either focus or fold. Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors. So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls. Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll. Down the roads where cars get broken and stole. These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove. The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove. On the corners. Hook:. (Kanye West). I wish I could give you this feelin'. I wish I could give this feelin'. On the corners niggaz rob or kill. And dyin' just to make a livin', huh?. (Spoken: Lost Prophets). We overstated, we underrated, we educated. The corner was our time when time stood still and. Gators and snakeskins and. Yellow and pink and. ? profiles ??. Verse 2: (Common). Street lights and deep nights, cats tryin' to eat right. Ridin' no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes. So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right. Desires of street life, cars and weed types. Its hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like. The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like. Game that is deep, we speak and believe hype. Banged in the streets has cop left for deep life (?). Its steep life, coming up where niggaz is sheep-like. Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like. G's with three strikes, seeds that need light. Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife. The corner, where struggle and greed fight. We write songs about wrong cuz its hard to see right. Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light. Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites. The corner. Hook:. (Kanye West). I wish I could give you this feelin'. I wish I could give this feelin'. On the corners niggaz rob or kill. And dyin' just to make a livin', huh?. (Spoken: Lost Prophets). The corner was our magic, our music, our politics. Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries. Broke out on different corners. Power to the people. Black power. Black is beautiful. Verse 3: (Common). Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers. As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists. The dirt isn't just fertile, its people workin' and earnin' this. The curb getters go where the cats flow and the current is. Its so hot that niggaz burn to live. The furnace is, whether money movin', the determined live. We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers. Its so black packed with action that's affirmative. The corners. Hook:. (Kanye West). I wish I could give you this feelin'. I wish I could give this feelin'. On the corners niggaz rob or kill. And dyin' just to make a livin', huh?. (Spoken: Lost Prophets). The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge. Our Taj Mahal, our monument. Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love. Down on the corner. Enviado por ""Sekef"""
the food,"""The Food"". (feat. Kanye West). [Dave Chappelle]. Tonight's musical guest. Two of Chicago's Finest emcees!. Give it up for Common and Kanye West!. ""It's Common Sense!"". [Intro - Common]. Yeah! ""Common Sense!"" - [scratched]. It's Common Sense! With Kanye West!. On the Dave Chappelle Show!. Everybody gotta eat right?. It's the food baby!. [Chorus - Kanye West]. I walked in the crib, got two kids. And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!). So I had to did, what I had to did. Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!). I'm up all night, getting my money right. Until the blue and white (po po! po po! po po!). Now the money coming slow, but a least a - know. Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!). [Verse - Common]. You love to hear the story, again and again. About these young brothers, from the City of Wind. Like juice and gin, in the city we blend. Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims. Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed. Heartless females that wanna ride in em. Felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim. Pimp minds collide wit em, a system that tries victims. We living in, my man in the fast lane pivoting. On the block white is selling like Eminem. On the block it ""Jump Off"" like Kim and them. On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then. Shorties get the game but no instructions to assembling. Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dimming them. Call my man cuzo, like I'm kin to him. He trying to stay straight, the streets is bending him. [Chorus]. [Verse - Common]. It's all good in the hood, like raps and gems. Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims. Whether on ball courts, attires of all sorts. We never fall short, wit us it's Our Force like And 1's. Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for. Cats is colder than four below, wit self I go toe to toe. Wondering if it's for the art or for the doe. Though I know to grow a - gotta learn to let go. Though I know the doe I got to bring back to the ghetto. Arrows on Terot cards pointing to the grind. Po' livin in more prisons, pointing to my mind, shine the light up. Clench my fists tight, holding the right up. Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter. Situations, and jobs get tighter. My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon!. [Chorus]. [Bridge - Kanye West]. I - I know I could make it right. If I could just swallow my pride. But I can't run away or put my - away. You can't front on me. I - no I can't let it ride. No no not tonight. See I can't run away or put my - away. You can't front on me. [applause]"
the game,"[Chorus]. It's only right that I address this.. Gotta be in it to win it.. I never come lame type chillin in the game.. Now get busy. [Verse One]. Raised by game. Where niggas ain't fazed by fame.. Come to the crib, get banged, they take your chain.. Stay in your lane. Broke back ain't the way of the game.. My brainstorm is like I stay in the ring.. My favorite was Kane, now I'm dope with weight in the game. You was hot but can't stay in the rain.. Ghetto pain and windows crack.. The fist is like a symbol for black. Can tell the real by how the interact. In the middle of whack my soul stick to a track. Kickback records get kicked to the back. I want big cribs and my man Ronnie to get his. Child in a good school and know what her gift is. It's global warming, the world is shifting. Watching Sweet Sixteen, Bithin-ass rich kids. You know, I know I gotta go the distance. Whether yoga or doja, we all get lifted in the game.. [Chorus]. It's only right that I address this.. Gotta be in it to win it.. I never come lame type chillin in the game.. Now get busy. [Verse Two]. I never kissed that ass of the masters. I'm the black molasses. Thick and I last. Pass these rat bastards. They try to box me in like gaseous clay. Hey I'm like Muhammad when he fasted. Opposing the fascist. Got cuts and got gashes, scratches over third eyelashes. Punchlines are like jab pits to rappers. Whose careers now ashes. It's too many slashes in their name. Came in the game. From weak lines to clothing lines to an actress. I seen em dashing smash hits. I yell run nigga run. While I cook up classics. The weak hearted, become Babylon puppets. Making it hard for real hustlas. Touch the sky now and then, with a lady friend. Give thanks to the most that's how the day begins in the game.. [Chorus]. It's only right that I address this.. Gotta be in it to win it.. I never come lame type chillin in the game.. Now get busy. [Verse Three]. I just wanna be like Akeelah, an achiever. from the streets of the Chi where some get high for leisure. Selling weed out of cleaners. From rocks to barber shops and beamers. Chicks with blond weaves and strong legs like Serena. The demeanor of the Ghetto, to never stay settled. Aldermen and corrupt men play Pharaoh. Good bring business to the hood like heralds. Find your own, walking by themselves in the street. The young die of cancer. I stopped eating meat. Greet the gods on 87th street like peace. Even though it's , got em facing the east. The game ain't tasting as sweet. Cats flow is still, and his compliance with beats. My radio station is deep , so eff em. Progression, counting paper and blessings in the game. [Chorus]. It's only right that I address this.. Gotta be in it to win it.. I never come lame type chillin in the game.. Now get busy"

the light,"Yeah... Doo-doo-doo, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm... Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo YO... I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this. Gotta be somethin for me to write this. Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute. Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it. Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together. Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever. I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you. I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too. Because of you, feelings I handle with care. Some niggaz recognize the light but they can't handle the glare. You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin shirts. If relationship is effort I will match your work. I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most. They say the end is near, it's important that we close... .. to the most, high. Regardless of what happen on him let's rely. There are times.. when you'll need someone... I will be by your side... There is a light, that shines,. special for you, and me... Yo, yo, check it. It's important, we communicate. and tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch. I never call you my bitch or even my boo. There's so much in a name and so much more in you. Few understand the union of woman and man. And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land. But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write. from an East Coast shine night's moon, you my light. If heaven had a height, you would be that tall. Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all. Let's stick to understandin and we won't fall. For better or worse times, I hope to me you call. So I pray everyday more than anything. friends will stay as we begin to lay. this foundation for a family - love ain't simple. Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually. Granted we known each other for some time. It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine. There are times.. when you'll need someone... I will be by your side, oh darling. There is a light, that shines,. special for you, and me... Yeah.. yo, yo, check it. It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop. and I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop. Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh. Suggestin beats I should rhyme to. At times when I'm lost I try to find you. You know to give me space when it's time to. My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness. Truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence. The time we committed love it was real good. Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good. I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal. it's how I must treat you. As my reflection in light I'ma lead you. And whatever's right, I'ma feed you. Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da. Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace. There are times.. when you'll need someone... I will be by your side... There is a light, that shines,. special for you, and me... (I'll) take my chances.. before they pass... .. pass me by, oh darling... You need to look at the other side... You'll agree..."

Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times were harder. Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr. Why white folks focus on dogs and yoga. While people on the low end tryin to ball and get over. Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers. From the bounce to the ounce, its all our culture. Everyday we hustlin, tryna get them custom rims. Law we ain't trustin them, thick broads we lust in them. Sick and tired of bunchin it, I look on the bus at them.

the remedy,"The Remedy. Common Featuring Q-Tip. Yo, we all got different things that we got to deal with. We always are. trying. to put the blame on something else rather than sometimes looking at. ourselves, recognizing a lot of the stuff that happens, sometimes it has to do. with other things...but if we look within ourselves, we could prevent a lot of. this nonsense sometimes, y'know. It's about. relating back to the essence y'know what I'm sayin', where it all stems from.. I'm-a do my. thing over this drum, like a native tongue.. Verse one Q-Tip:. Do what you will, if you feel that your steeze is real. complicated with the skills over reel to reel. brown skin is what i feel, my mind and body's appeal. is to the no-frill mills, who hear the beats to chill. constantly, I'm hearing Black Americans just sneering. Looking for a leader who can fill us up with ether. Hitting us up with great emotional chat. about the fact. that the black. is constantly held back. Like 50 tracks back in a relay race. and the white team's ahead. so let's keep up the pace. And I be needing something that could feed my logical taste. At the end of the race is there a paradise place?. Yo, we can't get involved in what the next man is doing. Material gain we put too much in persuing. ""Yo duke, I need this dope so we can step to this party"". But we can all mardi grati. Minus that shit in our body. ""What that got to do with that"". 'Cause kid that's the essence,. your physical presence. embodies every lesson. You can't run the Rolls Royce if the engine is busted.. Can't even life the knife to cut the mustard.. What we need to do first. Now listen to this verse. Let's concentrate on our spiritual plate.. Recognize your existence in this vast blue space. From a tiny cloud of blood. To the human beings with taste, sight, touch, smell. and sound. Let's deem it profound!. And prioritize this cause it was Allah's wish. ""Allah? I'm God"". ""No I ddon't believe that. That's a mystery"". ""If God is so good why does shit be happening to me?"". There's divinity within. because we come from the divine. A force that's not seen But yo we feel it every time. When the wind blows, and the earth turns,. and the rain drops, and the babies cry. and the birds fly, and the grounds quake,. and the stars gleam, yo. So many things are evidence of its existence. What we need to do is link it with persistence,. hear me out, yo. Once we recognize that, we can move ahead. Native Tongues, Common Sense yo he's Hip-Hop bred.... Common:. From the spiritual world my former life has developed. First person I lost close to me was Stella. Some of my mellows. Lost their mothers and their brothers. For them I feel empathy. But I ain't pouring out fuckin' Hennessee. I pour my heart out when I see Dot out on the deck. Knowing two weeks ago he slapped-boxed with death. I hear of niggas dying in the wind and on the news. But when it's somebody you know it hits you. and emotions get bruised. I ain't been in your shoes,. I won't judge you for knocking. Because the spirit of the ghetto says ""You Gotta!"". They snatch you again from rock flippin'. Give back into the neighborhood, you better start kickin'. Stickin' stores. On the strip. I'm tired of Arabs giving me my change back. Devil bomb my yesterday. My tomorrow he never gave back. I lay back, looking at the ceiling. Wondering what can I do. So my homie won't have to be dealing. Not cause you serving and I'm rapping I'm better. Just different pieces to the puzzle of black life. That we gotta put together, to better ourselves. cause families we gotta raise. No matter how long the money. Shorter become the days. Men become like women. and no difference in the season. If you got popped five times. You breathing for a reason. Let's put this five, ten year come-up plan in progression. Before we count our papers. Count our blessings."
the sun god,"Common... Common.... {Common}. Yeah, yeah. Hi-Tek. {Verse One}. Free the rhyme or risk a dig into a deep sound abyss. Unit in the stash the beats and never found the shit. Experience like Hendrix, keep my sound enriched. Cats ask about my stitch, to me they soundin bitch. In my sounds the glitch of hatred, for cats who ain't make it. I'ma give it, as far as you can take it. Tried to take the safe way, told you there's a gateway to skinny. Many can find it but few can climb it. I'm open-minded like a pothead. Doin what I gotta do to keep the spot fed. In the climate, of locked dreads, corn-rows, torn souls. Worn hoes, who been molested by they uncle. I bundle, amongst you cold mother-uckers. The world is bitter, like baby mothers. Look how far El Dorados and wine bottles drug us. Least God and the sun love us, it's the Sun God. {Verse Two}. Everywhere is broken glass. Nephews smokin squares, nieces smokin grass. Try not to say shoot around my daughter she already know to blast. Catchin the future, don't know who threw the past. It's the, year of the snake and the hidden dragon. Niggaz is fake like bitches braggin. Listen to the ocean and the stars, keep my vision in motion. In motion like cars. I'm down to Earth, at times I feel closer to Mars. The world is yours, I'm hopin it's ours. Some say the Gods is crazy, I see God in our babies. Child of the sun, I allowed it to raise me. (.. from a distance) niggaz tried to appraise me. I'm hard to read like graffiti so it don't phase me. My days be spent, behind dream's tent. Through the sun the divine being is sent. It's the Sun God. {Verse Three}. Letters from prison sayin we need a better religion. I'm a rebel that listens from a eighty-seven position. I can't crystalize the mission lies within. Born to die even in death we begin. It's heavy 'jo learnin what we already know. and carry low swing on a chariot slow. Brothers stick though remindin me of revolution. If the drama comes I'ma have to uhh pop his gun. It's the Sun God, yeah"
thelonious,"Ha, yeah, yeah. Uhh, yeah, yeah, play at your own risk. Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit. Ha, yeah, yeah, play at your own risk. Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit. It's the Thelonious, super microphonist. You know us, this rap shit we 'bout to own it. You know it, these minimes try to clone us. I got a bonus for the bitch that run up on us. I got a bonus for your bitch that run up on us. It's the Thelonious, super microphonist. Uhh, no time to sleep cuz if you sleep you don't eat. Gotta hold heat, just to make ends meet. Niggas livin on the street while other niggas feast. Aight wit you it aint aight wit me. Right, gotta make money all my life. Gotta stay fuckin bitches many types. Yeah you know what I'm talkin 'bout. Yup, stay turnin these bitches out. Dick em down also dick em out. Throw somethin down whenever my dick's out. They know me so they restructure and reroute. They know me from Washington to down south. All the way to London to my nigga Common house. Right, it's like a game we never play out, out, out, out.... Nigga no doubt, nigga get live or get knocked the fuck out. Word up, just be about what you about dogg. Knowhatimsayin, just play at your own risk. Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit. It's the Thelonious, super microphonist. You know us, this rap shit we 'bout to own it. You know it, cuz you can feel it in your throat. Say it. I'm 'bout to let my mind float. (Com, say it). Get your third eye poked. Fuck game, I assemble dope.... Ness, a nigga that's fresh as the 'fess. Studied this rap shit, no need to mic test. You can feel it in your chest. Your B I, feel it in her breasts. Plus you, rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced. We lick off lyrics in the streets and real niggas hear us. Dreamin when I wrote this, box me if I go too wild. Still doin this shit like dude in wild style. Invitin wack niggas to dinner. I ""Trick Daddy"" emcees and I don't know, ""Nann Nigga"". Who can take it where I take it. You better go into God like Mase did. Leavin crowds complacent. I move em above clouds whether on some ?surface the earth? shit. Or thug style you can feel it in your body. Yeah y'all you can feel it in your body. Like if a 12 gauge shottie shell hit your body. You don't want no one to find your ass a hobby. Carbon copy, niggas tryin to clone us. You know us, Thelonious, super microphone. You know this, rap shit we 'bout to own it dun, for real. Ay, it's like a ritual. You been invited let the ?? stimulate the place. With the grace, nevertheless, I stress. Let the music put a smile on your face. As for the ritual, when it comes to spiritual excellence. You know I always leave you with the taste. I know you like it hard to the core. That's what you ask for ???????. Hurtin like a ?? in that ass, like a ritual. Conversation with the most high makes me wanna cry. I wonder why, you wanna get to paradise. But that itty bitty part of you don't wanna die. So pay attention to my word, cuz it's the truth. Meditation ease the mind, and brings the youth. It's like a verse you could never read out of a book. Darken the line and your mind like a fish hook. Word is birth, yo I do it till the break of day. Pay attention to your art, never go astray. Word is bond. Yo we do it and we don't quit. Sucka nigga you don't want it, it's Thelonious. Ownin this rap shit, super microphonist, and we known to spit. I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did. I'm raw dude, more juice than Sunkiss. You want this, so MJ kept sayin the rhyme flawless. Shit fly like MJ in his prime, ""Off The Wall"" wit mines. I'm grabbin my balls when I rhyme, nine nines bustin plus. Ball all the time, now stay on your mind like great sex. You aint on my mind I'm thinkin 'bout paychecks. Niggas large like an Adex Avirex jacket. Yo the gods they bust like latex sex packets. Emcees they don't rhyme and ball, they lyin' to y'all. They dyin' to ball, the rhyme we do all the time. We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines. Me and my mans is somethin like the Source Sports. We gettin money a long time and y'all short. My niggas bounce and full rise and y'alls fall. You funny doo, cuz really you think you can do me. When you roll a 500 that's really a 320. Should of let somebody else hook it. Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it. I'm from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate. That's how they play, don't let it be a holiday. Thelonious niggas, if you testin us we get you laid back. Show you the definition of a pay back."
they say,"""They Say"". (feat. John Legend, Kanye West). [Chorus: John Legend]. They say ""What's happenin'?"". We say the facts and if, they lie.... We comin' back for them. They might say... but they don't know!. (They say, They say...). They don't knowwwww. [Verse 1: Common]. They say a nigga lost his mind. But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme. The thin line between love and hatred. I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life. They say life is what you make it. So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it. As high as the stakes get when paper get low. I be tellin Derick, ""Tell Kara get us a show"". Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low. The richest man aint necessarily the nigga wit dough. They say ""You ripped"" ""Wow..."" Yea, that's what they say. My niggaz couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray. Paintin a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine. They say ""Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes"". I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye. They never could say - tell 'em, J. [Chorus]. [Verse 2: Kanye West]. Ahh... The sweet taste of victory. Go head and breath it in like antihistamine. I know they sayin ""Damn, Yay snapped wit this beat!"". Fuck you expect? I've got a history. Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!. Haters back down, gotta be that steel!. I know they cant wait till ya outta ya deal!. Look how they did D'Angelo ask em how do it feel!. My best friends worry bout me. Cause they know when you famous/fame-ass. And you had made cash the media aims at us and you be up so high. if you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash. But God don't ever give me nothin I cant handle. So please don't ever give me records I cant sample. So I could vacate where it aint no channels. but it's quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals. They say because of the fame and stardom. I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum. I guess it's messin with my health then. And this verse so crazy when I finish. I'm just gon check myself in - again. [Chorus]. [Kanye West:] ""Uh!"" (hey!). [Verse 3: Common]. They say ""Dude think he righteous"". I write just to free minds, from Stoney to Rikers. Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is. On my paper, whether its weed or Isis. They say ""life is a game,"" so I play hard. Writin for my life cause I'm scared of a day job. They say ""Sef kept the hood together"". I tell the young, ""We can't play the hood forever"". Play my cards right, they say I went to left. They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F. Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights. Now I claim ""King"" like Don, or Frank White. They say my life is comparable to Christ's. The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice. They say ""The crochet pants and the sweater was wack"". Seen ""The Corner"", now they say ""That nigga's back,"" uh.... [Chorus]"

I can be fly for free, you want some flyer to read. then buy from me. I got the flame like U-I-C but I be, U-A-C. Some of the realest illest chillest cats you may see. in your life if you get one. Rappers are like jobs to me (why?) because they get done. Here it comes I'm as Able as Cain to get raw. That's why the DJ's mix me, I'm gonna bust dickses. not da bomb so save all your threats. I'm good to go and also I'm Rets. Rhymes I wrecks affects the roughnecks. down to the preps in the Polos, the studs with pros. hoes who wheeze, the bald-headed to the dreaded. To folks with butters, high rollers and rollers. Players with plat studs with stocking caps I be rocking raps. til I collapse. Niggaz play my tape about as much as they do craps. I'm on point, I celo, I see high. Hi C, I'm free at last. I'ma free man, free as the world be. and like an early bird, I'm special. But you ain't that special, as that investor.

I ain't shoot nobody I ain't shank nobody. I ain't kill nobody, it wasn't us it was THEM!. The Warriors, I'm a warrior and still don't have to show no gun.

But some say my talk don't make no Sense. I'm tryin to make the Dollars, my momma told me. to go to school and be a scholar, but school ain't for me. So don't even go there, I'm comin out of nowhere, to go where. probably in about seven years, I won't have no hair. But not only am I the Hair Club President, I'm also a client. I come off like a toupee, I still have to pay 2Pc Dark. A Raider that never Lost the Ark/arc, on the shot. but now when I shoot rock, I be all out of breath. My boy Adefo wanted to be a chef. But he went down South, and fell in love call me love. cause love is gonna getcha I'ma getcha. I'm like B.J. my Arm is Strong and I Stretch ya. Styles from East to West, all across the country.

time travelin' (a tribute to fela),"[Vinia Mojica]. *Singing in Spanish*. [Common]. What what, we do this time. Rock rock..... Yes, let this music travel through you. Talk about feelings, yeah yo. Yo wassup world?. Yo what's happening?. It's the C-double-O and I'm back again. Take this back and then, tell a friend. Spaces and places you been, time travelin *echoes*. Time travelin *echoes*. Yo, I was a piano player in my last lifetime. Now I write rhymes, sip white wine and let my light shine. Out the dark space, with the world on my mind like Scarface. though my sex drive like a car chase. More than a uhh, it's the piece of mind I chase. Stakes are high, like my uncle is. We both got problems, he never confronted his. Under the bridge I wrote, some shit to stay afloat. And paint a picture, raw like the first coat. Send my old man a note to keep his phone on. My little cuz'll know cheap tricks are homegrown. Travel to a place sweeter than home, listenin to Nina Simone. Repeat this psalm, to the sky I'm keepin my palms. Facin the east, actions macin the beast. Embracin the streets, my god caught a case cuz he beat. His lady down, it's two-thou. That ain't the way we lay it down. Souls get, found and lost at the roads they cross. Many paid dues, but few knew the costs. I ran through the Moss like Randy. Touchindown wit God, close friends, and family. Recognize the voice in the wilderness. Com Sense, '92 and I'm still in this. Time travelin, took my time in hand. My rhyme learn and plan. Jealousy, money and pride can burn a man. Some walk but never learn to stand. Still, afraid to expand what they feel. I'm dealin wit, wakes, marriages. ATM's, Ericsson's. Loud niggas that whisper carelessness. If we livin in Revelation. Why should the people of the sun have to run?. Come to Esau in a year, he'll have freedom. He ask why I hadn't been to see him. Really, I ain't have a good reason. He said, ""Rah, give back what you receivin"". In a race against time, I was caught. In the same game as you, but long live the sport. It's time travelin. It's the C-double-O and I'm back again. Take this back and then, tell a friend. Spaces and places you been. Time travelin *fades out* time travelin..... Time travelin *echoes*. Time travelin *echoes*. Yeah, yo wassup world, yo what's happening?. It's the C-double-O and I'm back again. Take this back and then, tell a friend. Spaces and places you been. Time travelin *echoes*."

[*both*] But you still gotta get your Two Scoops!. [Common]. Around and round and upside down and upside down we go. WHOAHHHHH! I'ma sneak in the front row. Not Jethro, I'm not a Jethro, on skid row. I don't wear Monie's hat, but I was a Monkey +in the Middle+. Hey diddle diddle, you can Kibble a Bit. I take a squat, and booty MC's be sayin OOOOHHH SHIT!. Yo, I turn Bucktown into Fucktown. You're just a field goal kid, and I'm a touchdown. With the next point to the next joint, so tell Spike about it. I'm all that, that your bitch be writin home about it. Shout it out, praise the Lord, hallelujah!. This could be love, but umm, don't let em fool ya. Cause when I do ya, come down come down after me come. Yeah sorry Sugar Plums but umm, I gotta run. Run Jesse Run, keep hope alive. I'm down with the b-boys, FUCK the Jackson 5. You jive-ass turkey, a-pit-apitta-a-aperk be. You can get ill, but don't, HURT ME, HURT ME. Or urk me, cause see I'll outsmart you like the Urkel. B-boys at the school of hard knocks, in a circle. Pass the sess blunt, yeah stud, you ain't know?. I wanna go bang, I said, bang-o, bang-oh bang-oh. or bojangle jingle jangle on the jaw. Hip-hip, hooray, oh now you wanna be all lovable?. Don't push or pull, or you'll see, I'ma wreck it out. MC's be checkin in but they don't be checkin out. I leave em out on the canvas. So click your heels twice and take your ass back to KANSAS..."

watermelon,"I express like an interstate. Hyper when I venilate. My rap pieces penetate and infiltrate your mental state. Just to reitterate. That I innovate. Bonin' broads when they men-estruate. I speand a great time with the rhyme. More than I did any female. I derailed your train of thought. Because your brain was caught. On some other man's thinking. Now your third eye is blinking. My rhymes be kicking like a brother's breath be stinking. I get funky for sure while you're *sniff* unsure. If you got beef, chief, then let that shit unthaw. This track was a broad. I'd be bonin the shit out of it. Bang, bang, bang then see what I can get out of her. probably some scratch clothes and some J's. I got six thousand ways to rhyme. Choose one. I stand out like a nigga on a hockey team. I got goals, and I can like a pop machine. I come clean. Like a fiend in Chi I'm down with rehab. My stutter styles crazy. Cause that's right, we bad, we bad. Pryor to Richard I was that crazy nigga. Cause I kick ass. And when i wreck other rappers be like whiplash!. Verse Two:. It's like I come I come to the party in a b-boy stance. I rock on the mic and make the gils want to dance. It's like I come I come to the party in a b-boy stance. I rock on the mic and make the gils want to dance. Me without a lyric, is like a nigga without a beeper. I'm a blow this shit out, cuz I'm the joint like reefer. If Barry White was in the mob. I still would be deeper. Cause i had lyrics back when i used to run with Keyvin. MC's step to me, butt-ass naked like ""What's up?"". I said, ""You know you done fucked up. Now I'm sayin, ""You know you done fucked up"". Everybody that here be say I'm Jams like the NBA. Cause I'm on fire. If I was a Michelan I wouldn't tire. It's funny how time flies. Well I'm as fly as time. I don't believe in role models. But if I do, then I'm mine. I make brothers say ""True"". They be you and be like fiction. I want 'spect and dead presidents. Like Richard Nixon. I'm a coach not a player. Not a gay mc, I'm straighter. My style is similiar to AIDS. You can f with it now. But catch you later. You can't touch this, cuz this is what I'm feelin bro. I'm the man, you need me I'll be on the fifth flo'. Just chillin. Even if it's played out it's not the word to play so peace. I'm out to Dirty Burgers I'ma give my change to Reese."
what a world,"What do you see when look at me and I'm just standing there?. Shit, that make the world all work, that's what in my blood. And I won't stop until I drop 'cause my life's just burning out. So walk, keep climbing, won't look down until I reach the top. What a world, what a world. What a world, what a world. What a world, what a world. What a world, what a world. A little boy from Chicago had dreams to be a star. And make a way and get some pay and drive a fancy car. Though his mama used to say to him, ""Hey boy, just go school"". But whether it was old or new in school he broke the rules. What do you see when look at me and I'm just standing there?. Shit, that make the world all work, that's what in my blood. And I won't stop until I drop 'cause my life's just burning out. So walk, keep climbing, won't look down until I reach the top. What a world, what a world. What a world, what a world. What a world, what a world. What a world, what a world. Now his whole life he told his boys, ""Hey y'all, I'm going to rap"". So when he got a rap contract, it wasn't no turning back. Now his mama she would say to him. ""You need to get, get back in school"". And all the trash that the peoples say he was using it for fuel. What do you see when look at me and I'm just standing there?. Shit, that make the world all work, that's what in my blood. And I won't stop until I drop 'cause my life's just burning out. So walk, keep climbing, won't look down until I reach the top. What a world, what a world. What a world, what a world. What a world, what a world. What a world, what a world. And the story goes on and on, it goes on and on and on. They say, ""Hey boy, you rap real good but ain't making no hit songs"". So he'd tell himself, yo, yo, yo self you gotta do it the way you do. And make this music from your soul and make it fresh and new. What do you see when look at me and I'm just standing there?. Shit, that make the world all work, that's what in my blood. And I won't stop until I drop 'cause my life's just burning out. So walk, keep climbing, won't look down until I reach the top. What a world, what a world. What a world, what a world. What a world, what a world. What a world, what a world. Then the game, it started to change. They say music just ain't the same. Though he remained the song he is sang. Just keep your drive, stay in your lane. Inch by inch the people came. They started to know his name and say you do your thang. Now the whole, whole world singing his song. From Chicago a star it born, wow. What do you see when look at me and I'm just standing there?. Shit, that make the world all work, that's what in my blood. And I won't stop until I drop 'cause my life's just burning out. So walk, keep climbing, won't look down until I reach the top. What a world, what a world. What a world, what a world. What a world, what a world. What a world, what a world"
yelling away,"(featuring Zap Mama & Talib Kweli). [Talib]. Ok, its the emcee extraordinaire Talib Kweli. Chillin on Soundbombing 3, with my peoples. From the East, Cypha Soundz, from West, Mr. Choc. This is how we do it, I got y'all back, y'all got mine. Let's do this- no more music motherfuckers. [laughing]. [Zap Mama- Chorus]. Yelling, yelling, yelling away. Going, going, going away. And fly, away. [Talib]. Yo, fly in it. Blue skies the limit, the skies infinite. It reflect in the eyes of those who try to send spies in it. Capture the sun if they could, but they go blind by it. Look in the sky and I see Africa's eyes in it. The land is dry like the cry in'finite. The tear we shed grow to fruit til the eye replenish. The industry wanna try to give my rhyme a sentence. Behind bars with my rhymes diminished, they tryna end us. But all them clowns do is give my mind a senate. To watch my people's enemy die in my presence. Fly away on the highest adventure out on the line. And enter the gate of Zion, need to decide who sent em'. I went through the jungle (yeah). Stalking like a black panther, rap's answer to that cancer. Choking the life out the hood. They won't let a man emancipate his people. This refreshing like the spray of the bay in Puerto Rico. [Chorus] x2. [Zap Mama]. All the things, you desire. Earth...wind...water, fire. These elements hammer nice together. See, you can find it there. Find it there. [Chorus] x2. [Common]. Yo, I came into this world as the naked truth. A little baby girl, trying to make it through. Through this earth, wind, fire and water. That I'm someone's daughter. Cadence of divine order. Sorta sent to let the people know their times spent. It's precious and we can't keep our minds bent. On just the pleasures of sex, drugs, wine, bread. In essence, we one with the environment. Though I've been here, less than a year. Being so close to god, I guess I haven't learned the fear. When I heard nature telling me, time to come home. Told my mind this is the path for you to walk, not to run on. Understand the night, to reach a higher day. Follow yourself so you can fly away (fly away). Fly away dawg, fly away dawg, fly away dawg, fly away dawg. [Zap Mama]. You are feeling, the stress. But in life, you're truly blessed. Go...for...nothing less. Spread your wings and fly away. Fly away. [Chorus] x4. [Zap Mama]. Go...for...nothing less (x3)."
