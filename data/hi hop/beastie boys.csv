We're thrashing hotels like it's going out of style. Getting paid along the way cause it's worth your while. Four on the floor - Adrock's out the door.

But the sweat is getting wet around the ring around your collar. But like a dream i'm flowing without no stopping. Sweeter than a cherry pie with ready whip topping. Goin' from mic to mic kickin' it wall to wall. Well i'll be calling out you people like a casting call. Ah well it's wack when you're jacked in the back of a ride. With your know with your flow when you're out getting by. Believe me what you see is what you get. And you see me i'm coming off as you can bet. Well i think i'm losing my mind this time. This time i'm losing my mind that's right. I said i think i'm losing my mind this time. This time i'm losing my mind. ""yeah you can't front on that"". But little do you know about something that i talk. About i'm tired of driving it's due time that i walk haa. About but in the meantime, i'm wise to the demise. I've got eyes in the back of my head so i realize. Ah well i'm dr. Spock i'm here to rock y'all. I want you off the wall if you're playing the wall.

You've got the rhyme and reason but got no cause. But if you're hot to trot you think you're slicker than grease. I've got news for you crews you'll be sucking like a leach. ""yeah you can't front on that"". So what'cha what'cha what'cha want what'cha want. So what'cha what'cha what'cha want so what'cha want. I said what'cha what'cha what'cha want what'cha want.

alive,"I have never been more ready in my entire life to do this right now. It’s all been leading up to this moment. All right now, right here. My whole life. We’ve got rhyme selection in a wide array. J’ai des bonbons pour vous, mangez. The party people scream “Oui oui c’est vrai!”. ‘cause I got a remote for my bidet. A.D.R.O.C.K.. I use the microphone like Picasso used clay. Down with freckles from around the bay. Peace to Bambaataa and Jazzy Jay. I rock on the mic from here to Bombay. I give it my best to say come what may. ‘Cause everybody’s got their dues to pay. I’m looking sideways like my man Pele. Getting’ on like Ali Boom ba yay. So fed up with racism today. Time to speak up and not turn away. Make the sun shine when it’s cloudy and gray. Dip dip dive, so-socialize. Open up your ears and clean out your eyes. If you learn to love you’re in for a surprise. It could be nice to be alive. I’m talking doody rhymes to a brand new height. I shine on the mic like UltraBite. Created a monster with these rhymes I write. Goatee metal rap please say goodnight. Now here’s a little song that you might not like. My DJ’s name is Mix Master Mike. It’s a real pity that you people gotta bite. But I can understand ‘cause he sounds so nice. Reading you the news ‘cause I’m Country Mike. Use a microphone like Shazaam uses tights. Try to keep clear of that hate and spite. So I keep my mind still like the still of night. Now who in the world do you want to fight. It’s against the system that we should unite. Homophobics ain’t alright. If you learn to love then you might love life. Dip dip dive, so-socialize. Open up your ears and clean out your eyes. If you learn to love you’re in for a surprise. It could be nice to be alive. Brining back that old New York Rap. Now you can shuffle numbers but facts is facts. So many billionaires while so many lack. So before the poor decides to react. Come on party people and share up your stack. Now, I’m a break it down to the brass tacks. Do the Biz Mark dance and the cabbage patch. You try to turn the key but you broke the latch. Sneak into my files for some rhymes to snatch. I’d like to have a say on the income tax. Don’t want to help build bombs and that’s the fact. No money for health care so what’s the catch. The man got you locked with no key to the latch. Mike and Adam have got my back. You bring the mic and we’ll bring the rap. Turn on the P.A. and rock your shack. Don’t smoke Cheeba, can’t stand crack. Dip dip dive, so-socialize. Open up your ears and clean out your eyes. If you learn to love you’re in for a surprise. It could be nice to be alive."
deal with it,Rob and Steal from the Health Food Store. The ideas you shout that are so hardcore. Screaming at the phone man collecting the change. Ideas discovered then rearranged. .

I won't live life being mad holding a grudge. It's not my place - sitting back playing judge. Not enough time to always stay mad. May as well be glad to Deal With It. Deal With It.

slow and low,"(chorus) Let it flow - let yourself go. Slow and low - that is the tempo. . It's never old school - all brand new. So everybody catch - the bugaloo flu. Not like a fever - not like a cold. The beats are clear - the rhymes are bold. So don't see a doctor or see a nurse. Just listen to the music - first things first. First of all - get off the wall. It's time to party so have a ball. Because we slowed it on down - so get the hell up. Like a volcano I'll erupt. We got determination - bass and highs. White Castle fries only come in one size. What you see is what you get. And you ain't seen - nothing yet. . (repeat chorus). . I do not sing - but I make a Def song. You could live your whole life - and I hope you live long. On the Gong Show we won't get gonged. We're the Beastie Boys - not Cheech and Chong. Strong as an ox - fresh out the box. The crowd is so live - they're coming in flocks. And when we go on - the crowd goes off. It's all hard rock - there's nothing soft. (repeat chorus). We don't only rock the house but we'll house we rock. We don't stroll but we roll straight to the top. M.C.A., Adrock, Mike D. makes three. And we can do it like this in the place to be. When I'm recorded - you'll be rewarded. I know my song is Def 'cause you all applauded. Not P.C.P. or L.S.D. - just me Mike D. in the place to be. This is not free - you must pay a fee. Cash on delivery like a C.O.D.. (repeat chorus). The beat is slow in order to dance. I wanna hear I dos and no I can't. First you move your legs - and then your arms. It's not fast and nervous - this dance is calm. It's truly stable and you ought to be able. To dance to the record when it's on the turntable. (repeat chorus)."

rhymin' and stealin',"Because mutiny on the bounty's what we're all about. I'm gonna board your ship and turn it on out. No soft sucker with a parrot on his shoulder. 'Cause I'm bad gettin' bolder - cold getting colder. Terrorizing suckers on the seven seas. And if you've got beef - you'll get capped in the knees. We got sixteen men on a dead man's chest. And I shot those suckers and I'll shoot the rest. . (chorus) Most illingest b-boy - I got that feeling. Cause I am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin'. . Snatching gold chains - vicking pieces of eight. I got your money and your honey and the fly name plate. We got wenches on the benches - and bitties with titties. Housing all girlies from city to city. One for all and all for one. Taking out M.C.'s with a big shotgun. All for one and one for all. Because the Beastie Boys have gone A.W.O.L.. Friggin' in the riggin' and cuttin' your throat. Big biting suckers getting thrown in the moat. We got maidens and wenches - man they're on the ace. Captain Bly is gonna die when we break his face. . (repeat chorus). . Ali Baba and the forty thieves. . Torching and crakin' and rhymin' and stealin'. Robbin' and raping - busting two in the ceiling. I'm wheeling' - I'm dealin' - I'm drinking, not thinking. Never cower, never shower - and I'm always stinking. Yo ho ho and a pint of Brass Monkey. And when my girlie shakes her hips - she sure gets funky. Skirt chasing, free basing - killing every village. We drink and rob and rhyme and pillage. . (repeat chorus). . I've been drinking my rum - a Def son of a gun. I fought the law and I cold won. Black Beard's weak - Moby Dick's on the tick. 'Cause I pull out my jammy and squeeze off six. My pistol is loaded - I shot Betty Crocker. Deliver Colonel Sanders down to Davey Jones' locker. Rhymin' and stealin' in a drunken state. And I'll be rockin' my rhymes all the way to Hell's gate. .

Causing all kinds of hysteria. My beats is sick like malaria. But don't worry I'll take care of ya. Me and Adam Adam and Mario C. When we're in the studio it's the place to be. To all beings everywhere be happy and free. With Mix Master Mike we're making history. Three MC's and one DJ. We be getting down with no delay. Mix Master Mike what you got to say."

an open letter to nyc,"Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten. From the Battery to the top of Manhattan. Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin. Black, White, New York you make it happen. Brownstones, water towers, trees, skyscrapers. Writers, prize fighters and Wall Street traders. We come together on the subway cars. Diversity unified, whoever you are. We're doing fine on the One and Nine line. On the L we're doin' swell. On the number Ten bus we fight and fuss. 'Cause we're thorough in the boroughs and that's a must. I remember when the Duece was all porno flicks. Running home after school to play PIX * 1. At lunch I'd go to Blimpies down on Montague Street. And hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet. Dear New York I hope you're doing well. I know a lot's happen and you've been through hell. So, we give thanks for providing a home. Through your gates at Ellis Island we passed in droves. Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten. From the Battery to the top of Manhattan. Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin. Black, White, New York you make it happen. The L.I.E. the B.Q.E. Hippies at the band shell with the L.S.D.. Get my BVD's from VIM. You know I'm reppin' Manhattan the best I can. Stopped off at Bleeker Bob's got thrown out. Sneakin' in at 4:00 am after going out. You didn't rob me in the park at Dianna Ross. But everybody started looting when the light went off. From the South South Bronx on out to Queens Bridge. From Hollis Queens right down to Bay Ridge. From Castle Hill to the Lower East Side. From 1010 WINS to Live At Five. Dear New York this is a love letter. To you and how you brought us together. We can't say enough about all you do. 'Cause in the city were ourselves and electric too. Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten. From the Battery to the top of Manhattan. Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin. Black, White, New York you make it happen. Shout out the South Bronx where my mom hails from. Right next to High Bridge across from Harlem. To the Grand Concourse where my mom and dad met. Before they moved on down to the Upper West. I see you're still strong after all that's gone on. Life long we dedicate this song. Just a little something to show some respect. To the city that blends and mends and tests. Since 911 we're still livin'. And lovin' life we've been given. Ain't nothing gonna take that away from us. Were lookin' pretty and gritty 'cause in the city we trust. Dear New York I know a lot has changed. 2 towers down but you're still in the game. Home to many rejecting know one. Accepting peoples of all places, wherever they're from. Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten. From the Battery to the top of Manhattan. Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin. Black, White, New York you make it happen"

You missed two classes and no homework. But your teacher preaches class. like you're some kind of jerk. [Refrain]. You gotta fight for your right to party. [Verse 2]. Your pop caught you smoking, and he said: ""No way!"". That hypocrite smokes two packs a day. Man, living at home is such a drag. Now your mom threw away your best porno mag. (Busted!). [Refrain]. You gotta fight for your right to party. You gotta fight. [Verse 3]. Don't step out of this house. if that's the clothes you're gonna wear. I'll kick you out of my home. if you don't cut that hair. Your mom busted in and said, ""What's that noise?"". Aw, Mom, you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys. [Refrain]. You gotta fight for your right to party. You gotta fight for your right to party.

3 minute rule,"Now here we go dropping science dropping it all over. Like bumping around the town like when you're driving a Range Rover. Expanding the horizons and expanding the parameters. Expanding the rhymes of sucker M.C. amateurs. Naugels, Isaac Newton Scientific E.Z.. Ben Franklin with the kite getting over with the key. Rock shocking the mic as many times times the times tables. Rock well to tell dispel all of the old fables. I've been dropping the new science and kicking the new knowledge. An M.C. to a degree that you can't get in college. The dregs of the earth and the eggs that I eat. I've got pegs through my hands and one through my feet. Shea Stadium the radium E M D squared. Got kicked out of the Palladium you think that I cared. It's the sound of science. Public service announcement time and money for girls covered with honey. You lie and aspire to be as cunning. Reeling and rockin' and rollin' B size D cup. Order the quarter deluxe why don't you wake up. My mind is kinda flowin like an oil projector. Had to get up to get the Jimmy protector. Went berserk and worked and exploded. She woke up in the morning and her face was coated. Buddy you study the man on the mic. D. do what you like. Drunk a skunk am I from the celebration. To peep that freak unique penetration. I figured out who makes the crack. It's the suckers with the badges and the blue jackets. A professor of science cause I keep droppin' it. I smell weak cause you keep poppin' it. People always asking what's the phenomenon. Yo what's up know what's going on. No one really knows what I'm talking about. Yeah that's right my name's Yauch. Ponce De Leon constantly on. The fountain of youth not Robotron. Peace is a word I've heard before. So move and move and move upon the dance floor. I'm gonna die gonna die one day. Cause I'm goin and goin and goin this way. Not like a roach or a piece of toast. I'm going out first class not going out coach. Rock my Adidas never rock Fila. *I do not sniff the coke I only smoke sinsemilla*. With my nose I knows and with my scopes I scope. What I live I write and that is strictly rope. I've got science for any occasion. Postulating theorems formulating equations. Cheech wizard in a snow blizzard. Eating chicken gizzards with a girl named Lizzy. Dropping science like when Galileo dropped his orange."

We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way. Your rhyme technique, it is antique. To all my heads Qu'est-ce-que tu fabriques?. Que cosa fai? Come sta e?. Ho fato molte telefonate. Oops gotcha clutch like Plazza. Sneak between the sheets so hide like matzoh. Holler back challah bread... next. We are the crew who put the crew in Cruex. I can see that Def Jam doesn't recognize me. I'm Mike D the one who put the satin in your panties. Time to count MC's in this place to be. Not five, not four, not two, just three. We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way. Round-house kick the mic out your hand. Drunken mantis, my name brand. So if you're slick with the tricks and the slight of hand.

alive,"I have never been more ready in my entire life to do this right now. It’s all been leading up to this moment. All right now, right here. My whole life. We’ve got rhyme selection in a wide array. J’ai des bonbons pour vous, mangez. The party people scream “Oui oui c’est vrai!”. ‘cause I got a remote for my bidet. A.D.R.O.C.K.. I use the microphone like Picasso used clay. Down with freckles from around the bay. Peace to Bambaataa and Jazzy Jay. I rock on the mic from here to Bombay. I give it my best to say come what may. ‘Cause everybody’s got their dues to pay. I’m looking sideways like my man Pele. Getting’ on like Ali Boom ba yay. So fed up with racism today. Time to speak up and not turn away. Make the sun shine when it’s cloudy and gray. Dip dip dive, so-socialize. Open up your ears and clean out your eyes. If you learn to love you’re in for a surprise. It could be nice to be alive. I’m talking doody rhymes to a brand new height. I shine on the mic like UltraBite. Created a monster with these rhymes I write. Goatee metal rap please say goodnight. Now here’s a little song that you might not like. My DJ’s name is Mix Master Mike. It’s a real pity that you people gotta bite. But I can understand ‘cause he sounds so nice. Reading you the news ‘cause I’m Country Mike. Use a microphone like Shazaam uses tights. Try to keep clear of that hate and spite. So I keep my mind still like the still of night. Now who in the world do you want to fight. It’s against the system that we should unite. Homophobics ain’t alright. If you learn to love then you might love life. Dip dip dive, so-socialize. Open up your ears and clean out your eyes. If you learn to love you’re in for a surprise. It could be nice to be alive. Brining back that old New York Rap. Now you can shuffle numbers but facts is facts. So many billionaires while so many lack. So before the poor decides to react. Come on party people and share up your stack. Now, I’m a break it down to the brass tacks. Do the Biz Mark dance and the cabbage patch. You try to turn the key but you broke the latch. Sneak into my files for some rhymes to snatch. I’d like to have a say on the income tax. Don’t want to help build bombs and that’s the fact. No money for health care so what’s the catch. The man got you locked with no key to the latch. Mike and Adam have got my back. You bring the mic and we’ll bring the rap. Turn on the P.A. and rock your shack. Don’t smoke Cheeba, can’t stand crack. Dip dip dive, so-socialize. Open up your ears and clean out your eyes. If you learn to love you’re in for a surprise. It could be nice to be alive."

b-boy bouillabaisse - a year and a day,"M.C. for what I AM and do. the A is for Adam and the lyrics; true. so as pray and hope and the message is sent. and I AM living in the dreams that I have dreamt. because I'm down with the three the unstoppable three. me and Adam and D. were born to M.C.. and my body and soul and mind are pure. not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure. just lyrics from I to you recited. arrested, bailed but cuffed and indicted. enter the arena as I take center stage. the lights set low and the night has come of age. take the microphone in hand as that I am a professional. speak my knowledge to the crowd and the ed. is special. for I AM a bard but not the last one. I'm my own king and this is my castle. dwell in realms of now but vidi those of the past. seen a glimpse from ahead and I don't think it's gonna last. and you can bet your ass. I drop the L. when I'm skiing. I'm smoking and peaking. I put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend. can't stop the mindfuck when it's rolling along. can't stop the smooth runnin's when the shit's running strong. broke my bindings the lion with wings. preaching his word in the B. Boy sing. I AM one with myself as I turn to The. I prefer the dreams to reality. I prefer my life don't need no other man's wife. don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife. but it's good to have turn to be a king for a day. or for a week or for a year or for a year in a day. come what may. I'm fishing with my boat and I'm fishing for trout. mix the Bass Ale with the Guiness Stout. fishing for a line inside my brain. and looking out at the world through my window pane. every day has many colors cuz the glass is stained. everything has changed but remains the same. so once again the mirror raised and I see myself as clear as day. and I AM going to the limits of my ultimate destiny. feeling as though Somebody were testing me. He who sees the end from the beginning of time. looking forward through all the ages is, was and always shall be. check the prophetic sections of the pages. He goes by the name of Disco Dave."
b-boy bouillabaisse - dropping names,He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost. She's slippin through his fingers as she's movin' out to the coast. If your world was all black and if your world was all white. Then you wouldn't get much color out of life now right. Nicknamed Shamrock my name is not Shamus. Girlies on the tippy cause my homie is famous. My name is not O'Houigheighi Norisit Brian. If I said that I was weak you know I'd be lyin'. Suckers try to bite they try to pursue it. *If you explain to a musician. he'll tell that he knows it but he just can't do it*.
b-boy bouillabaisse - get on the mic,Get on the mic Mike let's be real and don't cloud the issue. The rhymes are rope an M.C. you must listen to. People say that they been missin' me and missin' you. Get on the mic and let's show them like we used to. You say fuck that I say fuck this. The king Ad-Whammy has never been limp Dick Butkus. One half science and the other half soul. His name's Mike D. not Fat Morton Jelly Roll. M.C. Busy Le Disco fooled around in Fresno. Got over on your girl cause you know she never says no. Well Mike D. is a special individual. Pulling out knots pulling in residuals. Go to the movies get the Rolos the cholos riding slow and low. Mike on the mic and bust with the solo. Mike my stromy don't be so selfish. Get on the mic cause you know you eat shellfish
b-boy bouillabaisse - hello brooklyn,New York New York it's a hell of a town. The Bronx is up and I'm Brooklyn down. They don't know my name they only know my initials. Building bombs in the attic for elected officials. I quit my job I cut my hair. I cut my boss cause I don't care. You tried to get slick you bust a little chuckle. You're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle. Cause being as fly as me is something you never thought of. You'll be sticking up old ladies with the hand gun or the sawed-off. Like a buffalo soldier I'm broader than Broadway. Keep keepin' on I don't care what they say. I play my stereo loud it disturbs my neighbors. I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor. I am the holder of the 3-pack Bonanza. If you open the book then you will get your hand slapped. I am the keeper of the 3-pack Bonanza. If you ask a question you will get the answer. Her breast I saw I reached I felt. M.O.N.E.Y. the belt. I stay at home just like a hermit. I got the jammy but I don't got the permit. Yes you got a boyfriend and indeed his name is Slick Nick. that is why Annabelle you're caught with the shrimpy limp dick trick. I ride around town cause my ride is fly. I shot a man in Brooklyn *just to watch him die*.
b-boy bouillabaisse - lay it on me,Chinese eyes and Chinese suits. Smokin' much Buddha and smokin' much boots. More updated on the hip-hop lingo. My favorite New York Knick was Hawthorne Wingo. Met a girl at a party and I gave her my card. You know that it said Napoleon Bonaparte. Peepin' out the colors I be buggin' on Cezanne. They call me Mike D Joe Blow the Lover Man. Your face turns red as your glass of wine. You spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time. Girl you should be with me you should drop that bum. Cause I got more flavor than Fruit Striped Gum. With that big round butt of yours. I'd like to butter your muffin I'm not bluffin'. Serve you on a platter like Thanksgiving stuffin'.
b-boy bouillabaisse - mike on the mic,I met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle. I laid the bait and then she took the tackle. Had too much to drink at the Red Lobster. Now the room is spinning around like the blades of a helicopter. I never met a girl that was too finicky. If the press has their way then they're going to finish me. You might know this but you've never been this see. If I ate spinach then I'd be called Spinach D. I shed light like cats shed fur. Ride around town like Raymond Burr. I'm so high that they call me Your Highness. If you don't know me then pardon my shyness. I live in the Village wherever I go I walk to. Keepin' my friends around so I have someone to talk to. I play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it. It's a trip it's got a funky beat and I can bug out to it.
b-boy bouillabaisse - stop that train,It's 4:00 a.m. I've got the Dr. Hfuhruhurr Ale. I've got nothing to lose so I'm pissin' on the third rail. Groggy eyed and fried I'm headed for the station. D-Train ride Coney Island vacation. Dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1 train. They'll be kicking out windows high on cocaine. Jump the turnstyle I lost my last token. Riding between the cars pissing smoking. Also finger popping. Two bums fucking I seen them rocking. Head for the last car fluorescent light blackout. Policeman told my homeboy put that crack out. You know you light up when the lights go down. Read the New York Post Fulton St. downtown. Same faces every day but you don't know their names. Party people going placed on the D-Train. French trench coat wing tip going to work. Pulling a train like Captain Kirk. Pick pocket gangsters paying their debts. Caught a bullet in the lung from Bernie Goetz. Overworked and underpaid staring at the floor. Prostitutes spandex caught in the ding dong doors. Stuck between the stations it seems like an eternity. Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity. $50.00 fine for disturbing the peace. The neck tortoise the Lees creased. Hot cup of coffee and the donuts are Dunkin. Friday night and Jamaica Queens funkin. Elevated platform never gonna conform. Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm. Bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes. Over the loud speaker about the hard times. Sat across from a man readin El Diario. Riding the train down from El Barrio. Went from the station straight to Orange Julius. Bought a hot dog from my man George Drakoulias.

bodhisattva vow,"As I Develop The Awakening Mind I Praise The Buddha As They Shine. I Bow Before You As I Travel My Path To Join Your Ranks,. I Make My Full Time Task.

For Without Them There Would Be No Place To Learn What I'm Seeing. There's Nothing Here That's Not Been Said Before. But I Put It Down Now So I'll Be Sure. To Solidify My Own Views And I'll Be Glad If It Helps. Anyone Else Out Too. . If Others Disrespect Me Or Give Me Flack. I'll Stop And Think Before I React. Knowing That They're Going Through Insecure Stages. I'll Take The Opportunity To Exercise Patience. I'll See It As A Chance To Help The Other Person. Nip It In The Bud Before It Can Worsen. A Change For Me To Be Strong And Sure. As I Think On The Buddhas Who Have Come Before. As I Praise And Respect The Good They've Done. Knowing Only Love Can Conquer In Every Situation. We Need Other People In Order To Create. The Circumstances For The Learning That We're Here To Generate. Situations That Bring Up Our Deepest Fears. So We Can Work To Release Them Until They're Cleared. Therefore, It Only Makes Sense. To Thank Our Enemies Despite Their Intent. . The Bodhisattva Path Is One Of Power And Strength. A Strength From Within To Go The Length. Seeing Others Are As Important As Myself. I Strive For A Happiness Of Mental Wealth. With The Interconnectedness That We Share As One. Every Action That We Take Affects Everyone. So In Deciding For What A Situation Calls. There Is A Path For The Good For All. I Try To Make My Every Action For That Highest Good. With The Altruistic Wish To Achive Buddhahood. So I Pledge Here Before Everyone Who's Listening. To Try To Make My Every Action For The Good Of All Beings. For The Rest Of My Lifetimes And Even Beyond. I Vow To Do My Best To Do No Harm. And In Times Of Doubt I Can Think On The Dharma."

car thief,Some static started in the pool hall. In a motherfucker's face with the cue ball. Then I met this girl she tried to gank me. So I smacked her in the pocket with M.C. Plank Bee. Me and my crew out breaking windows. The bingo the lotto you know I'll never win those. Possession is half the law. I had my routines before all y'all. Your whole life is coming apart at the seams. You ain't nothing but a car thief biting routines. I'm a city slicker I ain't no townie. Right now I wish I had another hash brownie. Like Ricky always said you've got to toke and pass. Or Mookie's gonna kick your fuckin' ass. You try to take what isn't yours like a God damn rat. *See personally I wouldn't want to go out like that*. I'm a writer a poet a genius I know it. I don't buy cheeba I grow it. *I'm a farmer* people always trying to get next to me. But I'm down with Jalil Donkey and Ecstasy. Smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer. Because I had to deal with a money hungry miser. Had a caine filled Kool with my man Rush Rush. Saw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush. You be doing nose candy on the Bowie Coke Mirror. My girl asked for some but I pretended not to hear her. You can't deny me you always want to try me. You're just gonna get your ass kicked. Homeboy throw in the towel. Your girl got dicked by Ricky Powell. The Godfather of Soul is in the belly of the beast. For smoking that dust at St. Anthony's Feast. Sometimes you've got to let someone trip on their own shoelace before you tell them to tie their shoe. All the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters. Sitting in the White House pulling their peters. Buy me cheeba from the cop down the street. The only cop with a rope chain walking the beat. Like a sneaky pouch time bomb tickin'. Like the beat to my rhyme just kickin'. Space cake cookies I discover who I am. I'm a dusted old bummy Hurdy Gurdy Man. Five-O caught me now I'm going to the mountains. Said good-bye to my girl my lawyers and accountants. My mind is kinda rhymin and I think I oughta think. So I'm rockin all the rhymes and I'll have another drink. So the lights are flashing my mind is spinning. I feel like it is always the beginning. Of another rhyme I'm rapping M.C.'ing I rock. You ain't nothing but a car thief who must be stopped.

Now you wanna get back when you had your shine. But you run, you can run but it will catch up. Can't stop, won't stop, no compromise. It's a house of cards built out of lies.

eggman,I looked out the window and seen his bald head. I ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg. Scoped him with my scopes he had no hair. Launched that shot and he was caught out there. Saw the convertible driving by. Loaded up the slingshot and let one fly. He went for his to find he didn't have one. Put him in check correct with my egg gun. The egg a symbol of life. Go inside your house and bust out your wife. Pulled out the jammy he thought it was a joke. The trigger I pulled his face the yoke. Reached in his pocket took all his cash. Left my man standing with an egg moustache. Suckers they come a dime a dozen. And when I say dozen you know what I'm talking about. Humpty Dumpty was a big fat egg. He was playing the wall and then he broke his leg. Tossed it out the window three minutes hot. Hit the Rastaman he said *bloodclot*. Which came first the chicken or the egg. I egged the chicken then I ate his leg. Riding the trains in between cars. When I pull out the station *you're gonna get yours*. Drive by eggings plaguing L.A.. *Yo they just got my little cousin ese*. Sometimes hard boiled sometimes runny. It comes from a chicken not a bunny dummy. People laugh it's no joke. My name's Yauch and I'm throwing the yoke. *Now they got me in a cell* but I don't care. It was then that I caught catching people out there. We all dressed in black we snuck up around the back. We began to attack the eggs did crack on Haze's back. Sam I am down with the program. Green eggs and ham Yosemite Sam. Come Halloween you know I come strapped. I throw it at a sucker K-pap. You made the mistake you judge a man by his race. You go through life with egg on your face. You woke up in the morning with a peculiar feeling. You looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling. Families puck rocks the businessman. I'll dog anybody with an egg in my hand. Not like the crack that you put in a pipe. But crack on your forehead here's a towel now wipe.
electrify,Words comin forth like water from the tap. Clap tracks line the spaces places papers people stack. Back track through the minutes when the thoughts went insane. I pulled the picture off the cover and blew out the mind games. People say this is the playlist of the void non-bound. But I can say this is the plainness of the peace I've found. It's not the sorrow or the pity that we hope to dismantle. It's the cast of past dice lighting both ends of the candles. Scandelescent in the means I have dreamed on the schemes. Reunited in the times of such picturesque scenes. Can I get a witness to testify. Open your eyes realize electrify. So I plan and I scam and write it off on my taxes. It's times like these I'll just go with the decisions of the masses. And to the crowds who've come before with their profit massing ways. To the greed that fucked it up and brought it down to today. With pain I stand sane and remain holding strong. Whilst all around me those who clowned me are now drowning by the throngs. It's illogical the actions that are typically displayed. A set back ain't all that much problem to invade. So I will glow like a lantern on a new moon night. I'll fight violence with these hands that weren't built to fight. But like a furnace burning coal my goals are bound to burn in flames. Whether achieved or dismantled by the agendas displayed. Can I get a witness to testify?. Open your eyes realize electrify.

flowin' prose,"I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros. I'm scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know. But beyond the concepts and emotions that rise. To the interconnectedness that underlies. The lies upon lies have lost their meaning. The plies upon plies of consciousness that is being. Over and over I fall I learned to walk from a crawl. It's not sad it's just the way and the purpose of it all. Now every word that you heard that I said that you felt. Was put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt. I steal feels from reels but I pay my respects. Paying compliments and disses and deciphering affects. Words are water as I court her, as she is pristine. Words and mics fall to dust and all that's left is the feelings. I give in and I win I try to never complain. Intentions venture to center and then they set the stage. But I'll remain sane making gain without pain. Staining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain. And keep it positive as painstaking as it is. I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live. So like a cloud carries rain I'm gonna carry my rhyme. Coming like thunder with lightening timing. No hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans. Ferment time like wine no ploys or scams. Like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas. Ideas coming to me in answer to my pleas. Woke up this morning right out of a dream. Reached for my pen and pad because my mind was on a rhyme scheme. What can I do with these bones and flesh?. With these animated thoughts in a world repressed?. I'm going down like the rhythms on the winds of change. I'm keeping calm under pressure like a deep-sea range. I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros. I'm like Toucan Sam when I follow my nose. I'm giving shouts to Gandhi, Gravy and King. His Holiness and all enlightened beings. I'll be the one who screams it on the microphone. I'll be the one who brings it inside your home. But the words ain't mine I just pass em along. For Betty Williams and her friends I sing this song. And more ink from my pen and more tears from my eyes. And more crimes are committed as I say these lines."

here's a little something for ya,"[Intro]. Yes, yes, yes. [Ad-Rock]. Ill out the gate, I set it off. I suppose you're exposed, so get lost. You break off, cut all connections. Join the sucker emcee witness protection. [Mike D]. Muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-MIKE D!. Slip off my lows in the place to be. Always on time so I never botch. The tick to the tock of the Mike D watch. [MCA]. Now here's a little somethin for ya!. I'ma grab a little and store yah. Do some balancin for yah. And if you feelin chilly I'ma get you a shawl. [Chorus]. Get ready, get set (get set - get set). Place your bet (your bet - your bet). What you get (you get - you get). Cause I ain't done yet, done yet, done yet. Get ready, get set (get set - get set). Place your bet (your bet - your bet). What you get (you get - you get). Here's a little somethin for ya!. [Mike D]. Honest Mike, what? Honest Mike D. Don't really get in the press like Z. Cause I speak my conscience, and speak my mind. Don't trip and flip, and then I stop to find. [MCA]. Queens up front, Brooklyn's in the back. Laugh and crack guns while squads smokin crack. The odds are stacked, for those who lack. Been a lucky motherfucker when it comes to that. [Ad-Rock]. I, slow roast, I'm steady tappin. Oh yes, I guess I'm the toast of Manhattan. In Miami, I'm sleazy with John Salley. Shout to Andre, Lee on tally. [Chorus]. [Interlude]. This shit is crazy. This shit is cra-zyyyy! (DING). [MCA]. Dr. Karl to proceed, a/k/a Jewish. Dr. Bombay is the ladies choice. Step on stage so we smoke and dry moist. Every time I bring it twoice as noice. [Ad-Rock]. Now he's a breddern, take an Excedrin. Aldermen check your rhymers to be hedrin. I'm undefined, I'm gettin much finer. Steady loungin in my La-Z-Boy recliner. [Mike D]. Bruisin and jabbin, amped up on coffee. Like kids goin wild at the sight of Mr. Softee. I smash around the corner (GASP) and sneakin up. When you're breathin down your neck (GASP) just keepin up. [Chorus]"
hey ladies,Hey ladies in the place I'm callin' out to ya. There never was a city kid truer and bluer. There's more to me than you'll ever know. And I've got more hits than Sadaharu Oh. Ton Thumb Tom Cushman or Tom Foolery. Date women on T.V. with the help of Chuck Woolery. Words are flowing out just like the Grand Canyon. And I'm always out looking for a female companion. I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib. I took off her moccasins and put on my bib. I'm wheelin' and dealin' I make a little bit of stealing. I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peeling. Your body's on time and your mind is appealing. Staring at the cracks up there upon the ceiling. Some such nonsense is the bass that I'm throwing. Talking to a girl telling her I'm all knowing. She's talking to the kid to the who. I'm telling here every lie that you know that I never did. Me in the corner with a good looking daughter. I dropped my drawers and it was welcome back Kotter. We were cutting up the rug she started cutting up the carpet. In my apartment I begged her please stop it. The gift of gab is the gift that I have. And that girl ain't nothing but the blue plate crab. Special at Woodman's in Essex Mass. Educated no stupid yes. And when I say stupid I mean stupid fresh. I'm not James at 15 or Chachi in charge. I'm Adam and I'm adamant about living large. With the white sassoons and the looks that kill. Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville. I met a little cutie she was all hopped up on zootie. I liked the little cutie but I kicked her in the bootie. Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around. You be listening to my records' a number one sound. Step to the rhythm step step to the ride. I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside. Tune in tune on to my tune that's live. Ladies flock like fish to my line. She's got a gold tooth you know she's hardcore. She'll show you a good time then she'll show you the door. Break up with your girl it ended in tears. Vincent Van Gogh and mail that ear. I call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinking. The phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinking. She said come on over it was me that she missed. I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed. Your old lady left you and you went girls (x3) insane. You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 train. Take my advice at any price a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak. Sucking down pints till I didn't know. Woke up in the morning at the Won Ton Ho. Cause I announce I like girls that bounce. With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce. Girls with curls and big long locks. And beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks. Walking high and mighty like she's #1 and. *She thinks she's the passionate one*.
"hey, fuck you","Which of you schnooks took my rhyme book?. Look give it back you're wicky wack. With your ticky tack calls didn't touch you at all. I didn't touch your hand man you know its all ball. You sold a few records but don't get slick. 'Cause you used a corked bat to get those hits. You've been in the game, your career is long. But when you break it down you've only got 2 songs. MC's are like clay pigeons and I'm shootn' skeet. I just yell pull and MMM drops the beat. You people call yourselves MC's but you're garbage men. Takin' out the trash when you pull out the pen. And if you don't like then hey fuck you!. I read about you up on page 6. They was trashin' your ass it's sad you're getting dissed. Now talk about your face now don't get pissed. But I suggest you see a dermatologist. I keep that hot sauce hot not mild and weak. It's gonna burn your mouth until you wet your beak. I've got billions and billions of rhymes to flex. 'Cause I've got more rhymes than Carl Sagan's got turtlenecks. Your rhymes are fake like a Canal Street watch. You're hearing me and you're like ""oh my god its Sasquatch!"". I'm walkin' on water while you're stepping in shit. So put your sewer boots on before your ass gets lit. And if you don't like then hey fuck you!. So put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself. Sucker MC's it's me they're resenting. In the animal kingdom they call it presenting. With the dipsy doodle the kit and caboodle. The truth is brutal your grandma's kugel. Kings County is my stomping ground. The Albee Square Mall, Brooklyn, Downtown. So don't ask me to wine and dine ya. I'm from Brooklyn you're from Regina. You're like Foghorn Leghorn, Yosemite Sam. You're just yellin' and wildin' wondering who I am. With those lies you're telling you look like Toucan Sam. But my style's impregnable like the Hoover Dam. And if you don't like then hey fuck you!. . Por: Leonardo Henrique - Léo"
high plains drifter,They can't catch me never gonna find me. They're never gonna know that I'm the High Plains Drifter. Pulled over to the river to take a rest. Pulled out a pair of pliers and pulled the bullet out of my chest. Fear and loathing across the country listening to my 8 track. Reached behind the seat and grabbed a Kool from the pack. Long distance from my girl and I'm talking on the cellular. She said that she was sorry and I said yeah the hell you were. Check my rear view mirror check the gold tooth display. Check the odometer and I was on my way. Cause I'm a high plains drifter the best that you can get. A strapped shoplifter a pirate on cassette. Bust a Travis Bickle when I feel that I'm getting pushed. Don't step to me or you're gonna get mushed. Doing 120 plowing over mail boxes. Radar detector to tell me where the cops is. Spend another night at the Motel 6. It's five dollars extra get the porno flicks. Concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter. I'm a kleptomaniac K-Mart shoplifter. Cash flow getting low so I had to pull a job. I found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob. Left the car outside with the engine still revvin'. Time to get busy at 7-Eleven. Went inside to make my withdrawal. I would've took what he had had had I had to take it all. Knucklehead deli tried to gyp me on the price. So I clocked him off the turban with the bag of ice. Mellow like Jell-O cool like lemonade. Made my getaway and I thought that I had it made. I feel like Steve McQueen a former movie star. Look in my rearview mirror seen a police car. Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap. I couldn't help but notice I was caught in a speed trap. Dirty Mary Crazy Larry on the run from Dirty Harry. Stash the cash in the dash but my gun I did carry. I'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night. I got my alibi straight and I pulled over to the right. Cop knocked on my window and said Boy where's the fire. you've got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire. *Outta the car longhair* your goose is cooked. Read me my rights fingerprinted and booked. Makin' like a D.T. driving a Gran Fury. Wherever I hang my hat's my home and my past is kind of blurry. Every dog will have its day and mine will be in front of a jury. I'm the High Plains Drifter and I'm never in a hurry. Read me my rights as if I didn't know this. Threw me in the tank with the drunk called Otis. With his five o' clock shadow he smelled of 3-day old beer. My man turned to me and said why are you here?. I said I'm charming and dashing I'm rental car bashing. Phony paper passing at Nix Check Cashing. Went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn House of D.. He said you behave son or we'll throw away the key. Harry Houdini'd out the cuffs I kicked the screw in the knee. Took the bailiff's wallet and went straight to O.T.B.. I had a good feeling easy come easy go. I bet on one horse to win and your mother to show. And sure enough that nag came in. Brought my ticket to the window and collected my win. Broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger. Hot wired hot wheeled and *Suzy is a headbanger*.
hold it now - hit it!,"Now I chill real ill when I start to chill. When I fill my pocket with another dollar bill. Sipping pints of ale out the window sill. When I get my fill I'm chilly chill. Now I just got home because I'm out all day. What's the time? - it's time to buy ale. Peter eater - parking meter all of the time. If I run out of ale - it's Thunderbird wine. Miller drinking - chicken eating - dress so fly. I got friends in high places that are keeping me high. Dow with Mike D. and it ain't no hassle. Got the ladies of the eighties from here to White Castle. (chorus) Hold it now - hit it!. M.C. - Adam Yauch in the place to be. And all the girls are on me cause I'm down with Mike D.. I'm down with Mike D. and it ain't no baloney. For real, not phony - ""O.E."" and Rice-a-Roni. I come out at night 'cause I sleep all day. And I'm the King Adrock and he's M.C.A.. Well I'm cruising, I'm bruising - I'm never ever losing. I'm in my car - I'm going far and dust is what I'm using. Around the way is where I'm from. And I'm from Manhattan and I'm not a bum. Because you're pud-slapping, ball-flapping - got that juice. My name's Mike D. and I can do that Jerry Lewis. (repeat chorus). Hip-hop, body rockin' - doing the do. Beer drinking, breath stinking, sniffing glue. Belly flipping, always illing, busting caps. My name's Mike D. and I write my own snaps. I'm a peep-show seeking on the forty-deuce. I'm a killer at large and I'm on the loose. Pistol packing, Monkey drinking, no money bum. I come from Brooklyn 'cause that's where I'm from. Cheap-skate, perpetrating - money hungry jerk. Everyday I drink a ""O.E."" and I don't go to work. You drippy nose knuckle-head - you're wet behind the ears. You like men - and we like beer.. (repeat chorus). King of the Ave. with the Def female. You're rhyming and stealin' with the freshest ale. Cooling at the crib watching my TV. Ed Norton - Ted Knight - and Mr. Ed. Pump it up homeboy - just don't stop. Chef Boy-ar-dee cooling on the pot. I take no slack cause I got the knack. And I'm never dusting out cause I torch that crack. The King Adrock - that is my name. And you're drinking Moet - we got the champagne. A quarter dropping - going shopping buying wigs. Surgeon general cut professor - D.J. Thigs. (repeat chorus)."

i don't know,What's pleasing to the eye. In the delusion of my sight. Is not what I find when I reach into the light. I have lost my mind. I'm walking through time. Deluded as the next guy. Pretending and hoping to find. That distant peace of mind. I don't know. Who does know. There is no. Where to go. It's not so simple as I try to wish. But then again what is?. There is no other worthy quest. So on I go.
i want some,I give to this world 'till I've got nothing to give to. I give thanks to this world for the life that I've lived through. Stress gets in the way of the shit that we're doing. We'll bum rush the door if you don't let the whole crew in. . I want some. . Give me the chance and I will show you what I'm feeling. My mind's caught up in the Shit the man's dealing. looking Ahead the next level we're gonna take it to. I guess I should be happy it's a day that we made it through. . I want some.
in a world gone mad,"[CHORUS]. In a world gone mad it's hard to think right. So much violence hate and spite. Murder going on all day and night. Due time we fight the non-violent fight. Mirrors, smokescreens and lies. It's not the politicians but their actions I despise. You and Saddam should kick it like back in the day. With the cocaine and Courvoisier. But you build more bombs as you get more bold. As your mid-life crisis war unfolds. All you want to do is take control. Now put that axis of evil bullshit on hold. Citizen rule number 2080. Politicians are shady. So people watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack. I don't doubt it look at how they act. [CHORUS]. In a world gone mad it's hard to think right. So much violence hate and spite. Murder going on all day and night. Due time we fight the non-violent fight. First the 'War On Terror' now war on Iraq. We're reaching a point where we can't turn back. Let's lose the guns and let's lose the bombs. And stop the corporate contributions that their built upon. Well I'll be sleeping on your speeches 'til I start to snore. 'Cause I won't carry guns for an oil war. As-Salamu alaikum, wa alaikum assalam. Peace to the Middle East peace to Islam. Now don't get us wrong 'cause we love America. But that's no reason to get hysterica. They're layin' on the syrup thick. We ain't waffles we ain't havin' it. [CHORUS]. In a world gone mad it's hard to think right. So much violence hate and spite. Murder going on all day and night. Due time we fight the non-violent fight. Now how many people must get killed?. For oil families pockets to get filled?. How many oil families get killed?. Not a damn one so what's the deal?. It's time to lead the way and de-escalate. Lose the weapons of mass destruction and the hate. Say ooh ah what's the White House doin'?. Oh no! Say, what in tarnation have they got brewing?!. Well I'm not pro Bush and I'm not pro Saddam. We need these fools to remain calm. George Bush you're looking like Zoolander. Trying to play tough for the camera. What am I on crazy pills? We've got to stop it. Get your hand out my grandma's pocket. We need health care more than going to war. You think it's democracy they're fighting for?. [CHORUS]. In a world gone mad it's hard to think right. So much violence hate and spite. Murder going on all day and night."

intergalactic,Intergalactic Planetary Planetary Intergalactic Another Dimension. Don't you tell me to smile. You stick around I'll make it worth your while. Got numbers beyond what you can dial. Maybe it's because I'm so versatile. Style profile I said. It always brings me back when I hear Ooh Child. From the Hudson River out to the Nile. I run the marathon 'til the very last mile. If you battle me I will revile. People always say my style is wild. You've got gall you've got guile. To step to me I'm a rapophile. If you want to battle you're in denial.

Beastie Boys known to let the beat drop. When I wrote graffiti my name was Slop. If my rap's soup my beats is stock. Step from the tables as I start to chop. I'm a lumber jack Dj Adrock.

it takes time to build,"If you don't like the news then press eject. Baby Davis getting older can't take a rain check. It's time to let'em know what we expect. Stop building SUV's strung out on OPEC. Hold up wait up you know we come correct. You wanna change things up, well hey just get set. It's easier to sit back than stick out your neck. It's easier to break things than build it correct. We've got a president we didn't elect. The Kyoto treaty he decided to neglect. And still the US just wants to flex. Keep doin' that wop we gonna break our necks. It takes a second to wreck it. It takes time to build. You gots to chill. Hate filled people wanna keep us in check. Tearin' down each other is what they expect. If you want love well hey that's a bet. We've got to give before we can get. Waiting like a batter who is on deck. When it's time to wreck shop then shop I'll wreck. So let's calibrate and check our specs. We need a little shift on over towards the left. I don't really know but I suspect. I think it's due time that we inspect. How they get their information and their facts are checked. Another press conference someone's talking out their neck. It takes a second to wreck it. It takes time to build. You gots to chill. So step up to the window and place your bets. Is the US gonna keep breaking necks. Maybe it's time that we impeach Tex. And the military muscle that he wants to flex. By the time Bush is done what will be left. Selling votes like E-pills at the discotheque. Environmental destruction and the national dept. But plenty of dollars left in the fat war chest. What the real deal why you can't connect. Why you hating people that you never met. Didn't your mama teach you to show some respect?. Why not open your mind for a sec?. It takes a second to wreck it. It takes time to build. You gots to chill"

johnny ryall,Johnny Ryall is the bum on my stoop. I gave him fifty cents to buy some soup. He knows the time with the fresh Gucci watch. He's even more over than the mayor Ed Koch. Washing windows on the Bowery at a quarter to four. 'Cause he ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more. Living on borrowed time and borrowed money. Sleepin' on the street there ain't a damn thing funny. Hand me down food and hand me down clothes. A rockabilly past of which nobody knows. Makes his home all over the place. He goes to sleep by falling down on his face. Sometimes known as the leader of the homeless. Sometimes drunk and he's always phoneless. Sleepin' on the street in a cardboard box. He's better off drinkin' than smokin' the rocks. Johnny Ryall. He drinks where he lies. He's covered with flies. He's got the hand me down Pumas and the tie dyes. Go upstate and get your head together. Thunderbird is the word and you're light as a feather. Detox at the flop house no booze allowed. Remember the good old days with the rockabilly crowd. Memphis is where he's from. He lives in the street but he's no bum. A rockabilly star from the days of old. He used to have teeth all filled with gold. A platinum voice but only gold records. On the bass was boots on the drums was checkers. Luis Vuitton with the Gucci guitar. Johnny Ryall. *Who do you think you are*. Johnny Ryall. Donald Trump Donald Tramp living in the Men's Shelter. Wonder Bread bag shoes and singing Helter Skelter. He asks for a dollar you know what it's for. Bottle after bottle he'll always need more. He's no less important than you working class stiffs. Drinks a lot of liquor but he don't drink piss. Paid his dues playing the blues. He claims that he wrote the Blue Suede Shoes. Elvis shaved his head when he went into the army. *That's right y'all his name is*. Johnny. Johnny Ryall.
just a test,"Like a flag at half mast as frames click fast. Not a thing will last as past is past. Like stacks of thoughts that got played and worn. Used over and over till they were tired and torn. Like a broken clock that can't tell time. Like a thick ass book that's filled with wack rhymes. Like a scorching blaze that burned the sand. Like a band that planned and planned and planned. And flew down like a raven in the dark of night. And snatched up the worm helpless to fight. And brought it back to the nest singing microphone check. One two one two this is just a test. Like sand in one hand You can't hold for long. Like scheming on a plan that goes all wrong. Like fudge and caramel they're not the same. And it's a shame all you talk is game. You act like a diamond waiting to be set. In a gold ring, as if, I bet. As time goes by in this give and take. As long as I learn I will make mistakes. What do I want? What do I need?. Why do I want it? What's in it for me?. It's the imagery of technology. Is what you get is what you see. Don't worry your mind. When you give it your best. One two one two this is just a test."

Gonna tell you motherfuckers why you ain't shit. 'Cause suckers like you just make me strong. When you're popping that bullshit all day long. I'm gonna bust my shoes I'm gonna bust my socks. I'm gonna spread my word from standing on this box. This drive-thru world it just ain't right. Gonna run to Joe and Tony's and get my hair cut nice. Well come on y'all and let's work it out. I'm trying to get up so don't you get me down. Life I love you now give me a pound. Up from the frying pan into the fire. Look within and try to admire. What's going on. .

live wire,I know where you got to be going but you don't know why. I see things I ought not to know but I can't help life. You never knew my heart for you was monster size. You're a live wire. You're a live wire. Let me know if you want to check out for the all time high. My man told me long hellos and short good byes. But you are something else I love you please don't die. You're a live wire. You're a live wire
long burn the fire,"This is it y'all, some nasty shits for ya. Jump out the window onto a parade balloon. My style is iller than the goblins in ""Troll 2"". 'Cause I'm the type of Mc with the most pizzazz. You're stealing my book like I was Grandmaster Caz. Got rhymes about antihistamines and analgesics. Rhyme about expectorants, y'all don't see it. Soothsayer, not a player, rhyme sayer extreme. Burn like fire when I step on the scene. I've got shark's teeth so I can bite your head. I've got tiger's claws that'll scratch you dead. I've got wings like a dragon when I'm flying above. Shoot venom from my eyes when it's time to get rough. So step back and check yourself. This Mc's got weapons that'll ruin your health. So if you're feeling strong, then reach for yours. My book is my shield and my mic. is my sword, sword, sword.... Long burn the fire. The truth shall set you free. Now it's Adrock rappin', I'm back again. Like a Big Mac attack on your gut. and that's wack, my friend. I'm a maxer relaxer and I'm chillin'. I take that shit serious like Jerome to grillin'. I burn you to a crisp, sucker, back up off the toaster. I make you sick like at Kenny Rogers Roaster. See this rap thing is all about the braggadocio. I check my rear view, Mcs ain't gettin' closer. People think I'm slow '. cause I'm just I'm underchallenged. See me, you're like, ""Man, that's remarkable talent"". Live round the clock like Disco Donut. I'm like a tailor 'cause I got the thing sewn up. Or a proctologist, I move asses. Got so much heat that I fog your mom's glasses. Proof is in the pudding and the pudding's in my pants. You heard me rap and now watch me dance. Long burn the fire. The truth shall set you free. Save the date for when they hoist our number to the rafters. Above the haters, you can hear our laughter. Like Willis Reed or Elton John. We done been in the game and our game's still on. It's not Tic Tac Toe or Operation. Just holding it down like the gravitation. To all the heads that said, ""No can do"". Adrock's in the bath filled with chocolate fondue. Straight up nuts like my name is Mike Bazzini. Bonafide household name like Sergio Tacchini. ""Wasn't we here back on Raising Hell?"". Running wild like rats in the Taco Bell. On the mic I spit, the match it's lit. Mike Dino, the Jewish Brad Pitt. Making music for librarians to burly jocks. The rapper Mike D, known for my curly locks"
looking down the barrel of a gun,Rolling down the hill snowballing getting bigger. An explosion in the chamber the hammer from the trigger. I seen him get stabbed I watched the blood spill out. He had more cuts than my man Chuck Chillout. 24 is my age 22 is my gauge. Writing rhymes on a page going off in a rage. Out on a mission a stolen car mission. Had a little problem with the transmission. 3 on the tree in the middle of the night. I have this steak on my head cause I got into a fist fight. Life comes in phases take the good with the bad. You bought those coins on the street and you got had. It's all high spirit you know you gotta hear it. Don't touch the mic baby don't come near it. It's gonna get you it's gonna get you. It's gonna get you girl it's gonna get you. Looking down the barrel of a gun. Son of a gun son of a bitch. Getting paid getting rich. Ultra violence running through my head. Fuzzy navel y'all making me see red. Rapid fire Louie like Rambo got bullets. I'm a gonna die harder like my kid Bruce Willis Drummond. I love girlies waxing and milking. Got more excuses than my man Dave Scilkin. Predetermined destiny is who I am. You got your finger on the trigger like the Son of Sam I am. Like Clockwork Orange going off on the town. I've got posse bonanza to beat your ass down. I'm mad at my desk and I'm writing all curse words. Expressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words. You're a headless chicken chasin' a sucker free basin. Looking for a fist to put your face in. Get hip don't slip knuckle heads. Racism is schism on the serious tip.
make some noise,"You gotta fight for your right to party. You gotta fight for your right to party. ""Let's get some more beer, eh boys?. Man, there were so many hot chicks at that party!. Yeah....

You wish, jerkies. Tell it, who?. Oh what the f*ck is wrong with you?. Here we go, fellas"". Yeah. Get up. Yeeeah. uhh. Yes, here we go again give you more nothing lesser. Back on the mic is the anti-depresser. Adrock, no pressure, yes we need this. The best is yet to come and yes believe this. Lego my ego while I flex my ego. Step off my seko dessed up tuxedo. Sipping coffee playing keno in the casino. Want a lucky number? Ask mike dino!. I burn the competition like flame thrower. My rymhes like age like wine as I get older. I'm getting bolder competition is waning. I got the feeling and I'm single laning. We got a party on the left, a party on the right. We gonna party for the muther fucking right to fight. Make some noise if you're with me. Make some noise if you're with me. Armed as erection popular election. Getting paid every year like tax collection. Hear my perfection rotary connection. Taking mcs down by lethal rap injection. I'm like an ornithologist when I get pissed. You must've drank a fizzy lifting drink and you got lifted. And sifted. I'm just wiff and when I catch mcs it's time for wing clipping. I fly like a hawk or better yet an eagle, a seagull. I sniff suckers out like a beagle. My ego is off and running and gone. Cause I'm about the best and if you diss than that's wrong. We got a party. We got a party on the left a party on the right. We gonna party for the muther fucking right to fight. Make some noise if you're with me. Make some noise if you're with me. Pass me the scalple I'll make an incision. I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching. Put it in formaldehyde and put it in the shelf. And you can show it to your friends and say that's my old self. Can do me nothing, can't tell me nada. Don't quote me now because I'm doing the lambada. The forbidden dance here's my chance. To make romance in my b-boy stance. Parler romancing into the financing. Opened up a restaurant with ted danson. The roaches check in but they never check out. I set the record straight no doubt. We got a. We got a party on the left a party on the right. We gonna party for the muther fucking right to fight. Make some noise if you're with me. Make some noise if you're with me (a party on the left, a party on the right). Make some noise if you're with me (party for the muther fucking right to fight). Make some noise if you're with me"

namaste,A butterfly floats on the breeze of a sun lit day. As I feel this reality gently fade away. Riding on a thought to see where it's from. Gliding through a memory of a time yet to come. Smoke paints the air. Swirling images through my mind. Like a whirlpool spin beginning to unwind. And I stand at the edge cautiously awaiting. As time slips by. Carefully navigating by the stars in the sky. And I sit. And I think to myself. And on the horizon the sun light begins to climb. And it seems like it's been so long since he shined. But I'm sure it was only yesterday. . A cold chill of fear cut through me. I felt my heart contract. To my mind I brought the image of light. And I expanded out of it. My fear was just a shadow. And then I voice spoke in my head. And she said dark is not the opposite of light. It's the absence of light. And I thought to myself. She knows what she's talking about. And for a moment I know. What it was all about..

Always in a rush to hit that switch. . Nervous Assistant. . You wanna something you wanna something. You wanna something - my dick. Running around nothing found moving too damn quick. You know where to find me anytime. I can't take it I've lost my mind. Proud to say no I'm not son. I I I I got one. . Nervous Assistant. Too much action right by me. Like Buddy Rich try me. Need a brain that's stress resistant. Or else I'll be .... the Nervous Assistant.

no sleep 'till brooklyn,"(chorus) No sleep 'til - Brooklyn. . Foot on the pedal - never ever false metal. Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle. My job's ain't a job - it's a damn good time. City to city - I'm running my rhymes. On location - touring around the nation. Beastie Boys always on vacation. Itchy trigger finger but a stable turntable. I do what I do best because I'm illing and able. Ain't no faking - your money I'm taking. Going coast to coast - watching all the girlies shaking. While you're at the job working nine to five. The Beastie Boys at the Garden - cold kickin' it live. . (bridge) No sleep 'til -. . Another place - another train. Another bottle in the brain. Another girl - another fight. Another drive all night. Our manager's crazy - he always smokes dust. He's got his own room at the back of the bus. Tour around the world - you rock around the clock. Plane to hotel - girls on the jock. We're thrashing hotels like it's going out of style. Getting paid along the way cause it's worth your while. Four on the floor - Adrock's out the door. M.C.A.'s in the back because he's skeezin' with a whore. We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack. With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back. . (repeat bridge). . (repeat chorus). . Ain't seen the light since we started this band. M.C.A. - get on the mic my man. Born and bred Brooklyn - U.S.A.. They all me Adam Yauch - but I'm M.C.A.. Like a lemon to a lime - a lime to a lemon. I sip the def ale with all the fly women. Got limos, arena, TV shows. Autograph pictures and classy hos. Step off homes - get out of my way. Taxing little girlies form here to L.A.. Waking up before I get to sleep. Cause I'll be rocking this party eight days a week. . (repeat chorus)."

I told them I liked ribbons and pink's my. favorite color and all they had to say was. this: Thank you for time we will call you in a. week or so, but only if you have done good. So I waited patiently for five days. and then I got a little mad but I. did not care that much. A few days later the phone rang. ""Your in my movie"" said the guy.. ""Yes I said, ""I love you lots I hope. you do the same to me"". So I went on and filmed the movie. and became very famous"

paul revere,"Here's a little story I gots to tell,. about three bad brothers you know so well.. It started way back in history with Adrock, MCA and me, Mike D.. I been had a little horsey named Paul Revere.. Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer.. Ridin' cross the land, kickin' up sand.. Sheriff Posse is on my tail cuz I'm in demand.. One lonely Beastie I be,. all by myself without nobody.. The sun is beatin' down on my baseball hat.. The air is gettin' hot, the beer is gettin' flat.. Lookin' for a girl, I ran into a guy.. His name is MCA, I said ""howdy"", he said ""hi."". He told a little story that sounded well rehearsed.. Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst.. The brew was in my hand, and he was on my tip.. His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip.. He said ""Can I get some?"". I said ""You can't get none."". I had a chance to run,. but he pulled out his shotgun.. Quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead.. He put the gun to my head and this is what he said:. ""My name is MCA, I got a license to kill.. I think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill.. So what do we have here?. And outlaw and his beer.. I run this land, you understand, I've made myself clear."". We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin.. As if this story's over, but it's ready to begin.. ""I've got the gun, you've got the brew.. You've got two choices of what you can do.. It's not a tough descision as you can see.. I can blow you away or you can ride with me."". I said, ""I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border.. The Sheriff is after me for what I did to his daughter.. I did it like this, I did it like that.. I did it with the whiffle ball bat.. So I'm on the run, the cop's got my gun.. Right about now it's time to have some fun.. The King Adrock, that is my name,. and I know the fly spot where they got the champagne."". We rode for six hours then we hit the spot.. The beat was-a-bumpin' and the girlies was hot.. This dude was starin' like he knows who we are,. so we took the empty spot next to him at the bar.. MCA said ""Yo, you know this kid?"". I said I didn't but I know he did.. The kid said, ""Get ready, cuz this ain't funny.. My name is Mike D and I'm about to get money."". He pulled out the jammey, aimed it at the sky.. He yelled, ""Stick 'em up!"" And let two fly.. Hands went up and people hit the floor.. He wasted two kids that ran for the door.. ""I'm Mike D and I get respect.. Your cash and your jewelery is what I expect."". MCA what with it, and he's my ace,. so I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face.. The piano player's out, the music stopped.. This boy had beef, and he got dropped.. Mike D grabbed the money, MCA snatched the gold.. I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold.."
picture this,Something on the windowsill. Caught her eye and held her still. The cars pass by outside. Nowhere left to hide. Picture this now crystal clear. Nothing left to hold her here. And creeping up meanwhile. Traces of a smile. Eyes open wide to see if I could fly.
posse in effect,"Yes, yes, y'all - you don't stop. You keep it on - and shockin' the place. Well I'm M.C.A. - I got nothing to prove. Pay attention - my intention is to bust a move. I drink quarts and cans and bottles and sixes. Between the turntables keep the vodka and the mixes. I'm Mike D. - I got the deuces wild. A list of girlies numbers that I've dialed. I do the Smurf, the Popeye, and the Jerry Lewis. I like Bullwinkle but I don't like Moose. I'm schoolin' in the boys' room - coolin' by the locker. All the girls in class know that I'm the cool rocker. Punk in the hall - man I should of oughtta hit him. Had the fresh rhymes and the kid cold bite 'em. Smokin' in the boys room is what I do best. While you were at a party - your girlfriend fessed. I keep a pistol in my pocket so you better be cautious. Fly around the world - but it makes me nauseous. Mike D.'s day off everyday of the week. I got to the party - and I did the freak. I got a girl in the Castle and one in the pagoda. You know I got rhymes like Abe Vigoda. I'm a Def Manhattan killer - a rhyme driller. A mike in my hand and a mouth full of Miller. I got a hat not a visor - I drink Budweiser. The turntables - up on the drum riser. The needle's in the groove and the vinyl's on the platter. I know that I'm fly man there's no need to flatter. I travel around the globe - it's keeping girlies dizzy. My name's Mike D. - now watch me get busy y'all. You're a fake wearin' sucker whose gold got rusted. 4Cheaper than a hot do with no mustard. You tried to steal my fresh and you got cold busted. Because your crew's all soft and I'm disgusted. I'm from downtown the city of Manhattan. I got a lotta girlies and not one's cattin'. My posse's in effect and we're doin' the do. And we got more rhymes than your damn crew. Caught you poppin' that weak and you must of been dusted. Stuck you head in the toilet and stone cold flushed it. Word.."
professor booty,"Well, I got more bounce to the fuckin' bump. And then you want to know. Why it's cause I'm motherfuckin' truckin'. I'm in the pocket just like Grady Tate. I got supplies of beats so you don't have to wait. 'Cause I'm the master blaster. Drinking up the shasta. My voice sounds sweet 'cause it has to. So light a match to my ass 'cause I'm blown up. I'd like to thank the people for just showin' up. But now I want y'all to move it. Put your point on the floor and just prove it. And I'm smurfin not rehearsin' gettin' live y'all. A little puffy so you know what I'm doin' right. 'Cause that's the kind of frame of mind I'm in. I got a feelin' that's back again. So don't touch me 'cause I'm electric. And if you touch me you'll get shocked!. . You've got the boomin' system. But it's blasting out doo-doo. You think it's chocolate milk. But it's watered down yoo-hoo. I've been through many times. In which I thought I might lose it. The only thing that saved me. Has always been music. We've got our own studio the son of the G. It's no question life's been good to me. 'Cause life ain't nothing but a good groove. A good mix tape to put you in the right mood. This one goes out to my man the Groove Merchant. Coming through with beats. For which I've been searching. Like two sealed copies of expansions. I'm like Tom Vu with yachts and mansions. The logo I sport is the face of the monkey. Union made Ben Davis quality it's no junk see. My chrome is shining just like an icicle. I ride around town on my low-rider bicycle.. . So many wack M.C.'s. You get the T.V. bozack. Ain't even gonna call out your names. 'Cause you're so wack. But one big oaf whose faker than plastic. A dictionary definition of the word spastic. You should have never started something. That you couldn't finish. 'Cause writin' rhymes to me. Is like Popeye to spinach. I'm bad ass move your fat ass. 'Cause you're wack son. Dancin' around like you think you're Janet Jackson. Thought you could walk on me. To get some ground to walk on. I'll put the rug out under your ass. As I talk on. I'll take you out like a sniper on a roof. Like an M.C. at the fever in the D.J. booth. With your headphones strapped. You're rockin' rewind pause. Tryin' to figure out what you can do to go for yours. But liek the pencil to the paper I got more to come. One after another you can all get some. So you getter take your time. And meditate on your rhyme. 'Cause your shit'll be stinking. When I go for mine. And that's right y'all don't get uptight y'all. You can't say shit. Because you're biting what I write y'all. And that's wrong y'all over the long haul. You can't cut the mustard. When you're fronting it all"
putting shame in your game,"Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot. Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got. We keep the party movin to the broad day light. g.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright. Transhypnotic robotic can't stop it. No limits to this style you know you can't lock it. First you mock it, rock it and then you stock it. But I've got the styles that are always in the pocket. Like a bird floating down on a New York breeze. Every thought in the mind is a planted seed. So watch the mind or the thoughts will stack. Before you know it they're boomeranging on back. I'm the king of boogle there is none higher. I get 11 points off the word quagmire. Fools can't see me and that's how it is. And that's how I like it cause that's my biz. Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot. Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got. We keep the party movin to the broad day light. g.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright. Time's an illusion as the moments race by. Too fast to really grasp though we may try. Deny, till we die, ooh my my. These thoughts that mislead and then multiply. Second by second and minute by minute. It's like lotto you gotta be in it to win it. Shakin mind breakin on their own demise. Lies tax to the max and they'll be feelin those vibes. So tell me what you need that you have got. Fiending on power will make your blood clot. It starts with the greed and then goes all wrong. That's why we can't all just get along. We're all connected like a Leggo set. One equaling one together like a croquette. Whether we have or have not yet met. It ain't no thing and it ain't no sweat. Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot. Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got. We keep the party movin to the broad day light. g.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright. You're caught in a panic and it's rattled your brain. The selfish ways just can't maintain. But these are the breaks when you try and come fake. Don't come with the rhymes that you just half baked. I'm the Benihana chef on the SP12. I chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf. You be like hello nasty where you been. It's time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon. I jumped outside the house with my Walkman on. I get so hyped when I hear this song. It's gonna keep me happy like all day long. So go and talk shit cause it just makes me strong. Don't grease my palm with your filthy cash. Multinationals spreading like a rash. I might stick around or I might be a fad. But I won't sell my songs for no TV ad.

railroad blues,"""All Aboard, Track 17, All Aboard'"". YEEEHAAW. Now this song is dedicated,. To all the hard workin' pioneers of this country. Setting out discovering the West. Bringin' a railroad to where no man has ever been before.. Johnny he worked on a railroad. A poundin' on iron and steel. Workin' his way out West now. The only sure things his next meal. America was young. But she was a growin'. Layin' tracks across the prairie. Not knowing where they're going. His mother didn't wanna' leave him. But now he's in the West. She said please don't go. But he said if I don't I'll never rest. It wasn't always easy. Some of the boys died. Johnny wrote her letters. But received no replies. Johnny he worked on a railroad. A poundin' on iron and steel. Workin' his way out West now. The only sure things his next meal. Johhny reached San Francisco. Tired and broke without a dime. Started panning for gold. Just a hopin' he would find. The gold wasn't a rushin'. But Johnny kept on minin'. Trying to send his mama something. With the letters he was signing. Then one day Johnny finally got a reply. When he opened mama's letter. He began to cry. She's a writin' from her deathbed. And this is what she said. Please don't be mad at me son,. 'Ccause tomorrow I'll be dead. Johnny he worked on a railroad. A poundin' on iron and steel. Workin' his way out West now. The only sure things his next meal"
remote control,"Things get hectic quick. From the satellite dish to your joy stick. It's the night of the living cable box. Wires coming up from around the block. Remote control to change the station. But that won't change your situation. Have you seen what I mean. I'm the little gnome that's in your dreams. So I say this rhyme built by design. To take you beyond space and time. Said who is the man making diamonds out of coal. The man pushing buttons on remote control. Until your back's up against the wall. You never know yourself that much at all. So you've got to share your love with a friend. That's all that you've got left in the end. Living in this city of pure confusion. People mislead by their own illusion. All this action, no satisfaction. We're all linked together like a chain reaction. Play or fold, love is bold. What is the future that will unfold?. Some like it hot, others like it cold. But we all want to hold the remote control. Things get hectic quick. All of the sudden I'm in the thick. Too much drama all around. Distractions booming in sensuround. Like a rainy day's Earth won't sit still. Sliding on down a hill. Sometimes life seems to stall. So never be ungrateful y'all. So I got a little something for your pay per view. Like Don King I've got the crazy hair do. We've got cameras on Mars on space patrol. Controlled on Earth by remote control."
resolution time,"Actin' like the last generation on earth. You're gonna fuck up a place for new birth. You're cutting the last of the forests on the planet. Only a few hundred years since Columbus landed. Well it's due time that we look and pay attention. As the windows who knows show the knowledge with us. 'Cause it's the one that we prayed for, from on the earth. I give the wisdom to folks, you know whole worth. In these great times we still neglect. When they invent this land, don't give the due respect. 'Cause the FBI and the CIA. The whole federal government, the FDA. Well, the system doesn't work and it must be changed. And there's more people in the pen everyday. So I visualize resolution. Yo, everyday is in a state of evolution. Evolution time. Evolution time. Revolution time. Revolution time. Revelation time. Revelation time. Resolution time. Resolution. We come a long way with the peace in the East. But on the home front, they're wild in the streets. As it gets got hear a changing in same. And this is the Millennium still felt today. I hear the same stories time after time. The stories of fear, through violent crimes. Committed by hatred by satient beings. Who shall loose by kindness and it's plain to see. Now we don't have to stand for this oppression any longer. If we stand together, there's nothing stronger. We must interconnect it as though we sure have won. If we want to avoid planetary destruction. So I work and I work because the hate in my mind. Has assumed the truth and I know I'll find. And I visualize resolution. See it all as a state of constant evolution. Evolution time. Evolution time. Revolution time. Revolution time. Revelation time. Revelation time. Resolution time. Resolution. The world leaders were terrified of loosing their pride. Their spoiled children tellin' little wack lies. Vanishing numbers of unimaginable destruction. Sure as we boast they're at their last production. Threatening and challenging nature against nation. Walkin' down the road of total annihilation. Sprouting threats is insecure. Guns are for the fighting and they're immature. And it all stems from self-important police. Thinking that we're better than our fellow human beings. So I wanna empower the limit I can. And pass it along so we can do pass the pan. Some times I sit and I watch my mind. Watchin' my thoughts as they reel and wind. And stop and visualize resolution. For everyday is in a state of evolution. Evolution time. Evolution time. Revolution time. Revolution time. Revelation time. Revelation time. Resolution time. Resolution"

'Cause Downtown Brooklyn Is Where I Was Born. but When The Snow Is Falling, Then I'm Gone. You Might Think That I'm A Fanatic. A Phone Call From Utah And I'm Throwing A Panic. But We Kick It From The Root When We Break It On Down. Jimmy Smith Is My Man, I Want To Give Him A Pound. (Chorus). Ad Rock Don't Stop, Get On The Mic With The Tic And The Toc. I'll Fill You With The Fuckin' Rim Like Brim. I'm Walking Down Your Block And You Say That's Him. There Goes The Guy With The Funky Sound. The Beastie Boys You Know We Come To Get Down. Because I've Got The Flow Where I Grab My Dick. And Say Oh My God, That's The Funky Shit. So I'm Going To Pass The Mic And Cause A Panic. The Original Nasal Kid Is Doing Damage. Every Morning I Took The Train To High Street Station. Doing Homework On The Train, What A Fucked Up situation. On The Way Back Up Hearing Battle Tapes. Through The Underground, Underneath The Sky Scrapes. Like Harlem World Battles On The Zulu Beat Show. It's Kool Moe D Vs. Busy Bee There's One You Should Know. Enough Of That, I Just Want To Give Some Respect Due. M.C.A. Grab The Mic And The Ma Bell Will Connect You. Bob Marley Was A Prophet For The Freedom Fight. ""If Dancin' Prays To The Lord Then I Shall Feel Alright"". It Feels To Play A Little Music. Tears Running Down My Face 'Cause I Love To Do It. And No One Can Stop This Flow From Flowing On. A Flow Master In Disaster With A Sound That's Gone. I'll Give A Little Shout Out To My Dad And Mom. For Bringing Me Into This World And So On. (Chorus)."

shadrach,Riddle me this brother can you handle it. Your style to my style you can't hold a candle to it. Equinox symmetry and the balance is right. Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night. It's not how you play the game it's how you win it. I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic. For those about to rock we salute you. The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to. I once was lost but now I'm found. The music washes over and you're one with the sound. Who shall inherit the earth the meek shall. I think I'm starting to peak now Al. From S.S. Decontrol and the man upstairs I hope that he cares. If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire. We're just 3 M.C.'s and we're on the go. SHADRACH MESACH ABEDNAGO. Only 24 hours in a day. Only 12 notes a man can play. Music for all and not just one people. And now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel. More Adidas sneakers that a plumber got pliers. Got more suites that Jacoby & Meyers. If not for my vices my bugged out desires. My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires. So I'm out pickin' pockets at the Atlantic Antic. And nobody wants to hear you cause your rhymes are so frantic. I mix business with pleasure way too much. I mean wine and women and song and such. I don't get blue I gotta mean red streak. You don't pay the band your friends and that's weak. Get even like Steven like pulling a Rambo. SHADRACH MESACH ABEDNAGO. Steal from the rich and I'm out robbing banks. Give to the poor and I always give thanks. Got more stories that J.D. Salinger. I hold the title and you are the challenger. I've got money like Charles Dickens. Got the girlies in the Couple like the Colonel's got the chickens. Always go out dapper like Harry S. Truman. I'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Newman. *Never gonna let them say that I don't love you*. My noggin is hoggin all kinds of thoughts. Adam Yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin of course. Smoke the holy chalice got my own religion. Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians. Jerry Lee Swaggert or Jerry Lee Falwell. You love Mario Andretti cause he always drives his car well. Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born. And we love the hot butter on what the popcorn. Sippin on wine and mackin. Rockin on the stage with all the hands clappin. Ride the wave of fate it don't ride me. *Being very proud to be an M.C.*. And the man upstairs I hope that he cares. If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire. Amps and crossovers under my rear hood. The bass is bumpin from the back of my Fleetwood Brougham D'Elegance. They tell us what to do hell no. SHADRACH MESACH ABEDNAGO.
shake your rump,"Now Randy listen I rock a house party at the drop of a hat. I beat a biter down with an aluminum bat. a lot of people they be Jonesin' just to hear me rock the mic. they'll be staring at the radio staying up all night. so like a pimp I'm pimpin'. I got a boat to eat shrimp in. Nothing wrong with my leg just B-boy limpin'. Got arrested at the Mardi Gras for jumping on a float. My man MCA's got a beard like a billy goat. oowah oowah is my disco call. MCA hu-huh I'm gettin' rope y'all. Routines I bust rhymes I write. And I'll be busting routines and rhymes all night. Like eating burgers or chicken or you'll be picking your nose. I'm on time, homie, that's how it goes. You heard my style I think you missed the point. It's the joint. Mike D with your bad self running things. Yeah. What's that with your bad breath onion rings. I'm Mike D and I'm back from the dead. Chillin' at the beaches down at Club Med. Make another record 'cause the people they want more of this. Suckers they be saying they can take out Adam Horovitz. Hurricane you got clout. Other DJ's he'll take your head out. A puppet on a string I'm paid to sing or rhyme. Or do my thing I'm. In a lava lamp inside the brain hotel. I might be peakin' or freakin' I rock well. The Patty Duke the wrench and then I bust the tango. Got more rhymes than Jamaicans got Lingo. I got the peg leg at the end of my stump. Shake your rump. Never been dumped 'cause I'm the most mackinest. Never been jumped 'cause I'm known the most packinest. Yeah we've got beef chief. We're knocking out teeth chief. And if you don't believe us you should question your belief Keith. Like Sam the butcher bringing Alice the meat. Like Fred Flintstone driving around with bald feet. Should I have another sip no skip it. In the back of the ride and bust with the whippet. Rope a dope dookies all around the neck. *Whoo ha got them all in check*. Running from the law the press and the parents. *Is your name Michael Diamond?*. No mine's Clarence. From downtown Manhattan the village. My style was wild and you know that it still is. Disco bag schlepping and you're doing the bump. Shake your rump."

Everybody get down huh. Everybody get down huh. Everybody get down huh. Huh huh huh huh, Shazam!. On the court I go by the name Praying Mantis. Got the edge and I've got the advantage. If you could see things from my vantage. Point then you could better understand this. I'm in the lab all day I scrabble all night. I got a bedazzler so my outfit's tight. When it comes to panache I can't be beat. I got the most style from below 14th street. Internationally known as the Keebler Elf. Can't keep a catalog up on the shelf. I splash on beats like sauce on spaghetti. Putting MC's out of business like they're Crazy Eddie. Everybody get down huh. Everybody get down huh. Everybody get down huh. Huh huh huh huh, Shazam!. I know you're sitting pretty in the Hampty Hamps. Posing like you're rolling with that camp. In layman's terms let me break it down. You're flipping and flopping just like a flounder. I'm a hip hop scholar while you're left back. So Jeckle and Rush go back to Lefrac. I'm a simple man like Chance Gardner. Working 9 to 5 Dolly Parton. Got rhymes for jerks that's bringing on drama. Which rhyme you want first? The one about your mama?. Goodness gracious golly gee. Shazam! Freeeeeeak out with the genie!. Everybody get down huh. Everybody get down huh. Everybody get down huh. Huh huh huh huh, Shazam!. Freak out with the genie...."
she's crafty,"Well this girl came up to me - she says she's new in town. But the crew been said they seen her around. I thought they were right but I didn't wanna know. The girlie was Def and she wanted to go. I think her name is Lucy but they all call Loose. I think I thought I seen her on eighth and forty-deuce. The next think she said, ""My place or yours?. Let's kick some bass behind closed doors!"". We got into the cab - the cab driver said. He recognized my girlie from the back of her head. He said a little something about tip to base. So I made him stop the cab to get out of the place. I shouldn't have looked back man I'll always regret it. Something's going on and I'll probably never get it. She was crying like a baby - stupid dumb. It's just too bad that girl's a bum. . (chorus) She's crafty - she's gets around. She's crafty - she's always down. She's crafty - she's got a gripe. She's crafty - and she's just my type. She's crafty. . I spent my last dollar to by a Sabrett. When I seen this girl I could never forget. Now I like nothing better than a pretty girl smile. And I haven't seen a smile that pretty in a while. The girl came up to me she said she loved the show. Asked her to come home and she couldn't say, ""No!"". We got the crib - there's Adam and D.. We didn't say a word - they just stared at me. I said, ""I don't know her just met her tonight."". And Adrock started hiding everything in sight. D. pulled me over said, ""Hid your gold,. The girl is crafty like ice is cold!"". The girl is crafty - she knows all the moves. I started playing records - she knew all the grooves. He thought she was a thief - and D. was right. But I just figured she'd spend the night. When I woke up late in the afternoon. She had taken all the things from inside his room. I found myself sleeping in the middle of the floor. She had taken the bed and the chest of drawers. The mirror, the TV, the guitar cord. My remote control and my old skateboard. She robbed us blind - she took all we owned. And the boys blamed me for bringing her home. . (repeat chorus)."
she's on it,There's no confusion in her conclusion. She wants to waste my time and that's no delusion. Her final decision is perfection and precision. She's grade A class number one in her division. 'Cause she's on it. And she's on it. She acts like a nag I don't know how it started. Even when I'm chillin' she acts retarded. It's gets annoying so high on the tip. If a pirate had a Def Jam shirt she'd be hard on his ship. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. Cold chillin' in the spot and she won't stop. She'll do what's best just to reach the top. She studies real hard all night she'll cram. In school she majors in advanced Def Jam. 'Cause she's on it. And she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cuase she's on it. She's cold in the winter and cool like ice. Sometimes she gets loose sometimes she gets nice. Hear heart starts beatin' her hands get clammy. 'Cause she used to be stucked up now she's on my jammy. 'Cause she's on it. And she's on it. Her bedroom eyes they start to twitch. But she won't front 'cause she's got that itch. She'd drop to her knees if I'd only say please. Instead of counting sheep cold counting Beasties. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. And she's on it

slow and low,"(chorus) Let it flow - let yourself go. Slow and low - that is the tempo. . It's never old school - all brand new. So everybody catch - the bugaloo flu. Not like a fever - not like a cold. The beats are clear - the rhymes are bold. So don't see a doctor or see a nurse. Just listen to the music - first things first. First of all - get off the wall.

On the Gong Show we won't get gonged. We're the Beastie Boys - not Cheech and Chong. Strong as an ox - fresh out the box. The crowd is so live - they're coming in flocks. And when we go on - the crowd goes off. It's all hard rock - there's nothing soft. (repeat chorus). We don't only rock the house but we'll house we rock. We don't stroll but we roll straight to the top. M.C.A., Adrock, Mike D. makes three. And we can do it like this in the place to be. When I'm recorded - you'll be rewarded.

So I reached in the Miller cooler - grabbed a cool Bud. Slow riding, gun hidin' on the go. I'm fly like an eagle and I drink Old Crow. I'm the king of the classroom - coolin' in the back. My teacher had beef so I gave her a smack. She chased me out of class 0 she was strapped with a ruler. Went to the bathroom - rolled myself a wooler. With bottle in hand at the microphone stand. A. yo homeboy - what you drinkin' man. . I got money - I got juice. I got to the party and I got loose. I got rhythm - I got rhymes. I got the girlies with the Def behinds. I got ill - I got busted.

But little do you know about something that i talk. About i'm tired of driving it's due time that i walk haa. About but in the meantime, i'm wise to the demise. I've got eyes in the back of my head so i realize. Ah well i'm dr. Spock i'm here to rock y'all. I want you off the wall if you're playing the wall.

Expanding the rhymes of sucker M.C. amateurs. Naugels, Isaac Newton Scientific E.Z.. Ben Franklin with the kite getting over with the key. Rock shocking the mic as many times times the times tables. Rock well to tell dispel all of the old fables. I've been dropping the new science and kicking the new knowledge. An M.C. to a degree that you can't get in college. The dregs of the earth and the eggs that I eat. I've got pegs through my hands and one through my feet. Shea Stadium the radium E M D squared. Got kicked out of the Palladium you think that I cared. It's the sound of science. Public service announcement time and money for girls covered with honey. You lie and aspire to be as cunning. Reeling and rockin' and rollin' B size D cup. Order the quarter deluxe why don't you wake up. My mind is kinda flowin like an oil projector. Had to get up to get the Jimmy protector. Went berserk and worked and exploded. She woke up in the morning and her face was coated. Buddy you study the man on the mic. D. do what you like. Drunk a skunk am I from the celebration. To peep that freak unique penetration. I figured out who makes the crack. It's the suckers with the badges and the blue jackets. A professor of science cause I keep droppin' it. I smell weak cause you keep poppin' it. People always asking what's the phenomenon. Yo what's up know what's going on. No one really knows what I'm talking about. Yeah that's right my name's Yauch. Ponce De Leon constantly on. The fountain of youth not Robotron. Peace is a word I've heard before. So move and move and move upon the dance floor. I'm gonna die gonna die one day. Cause I'm goin and goin and goin this way. Not like a roach or a piece of toast. I'm going out first class not going out coach. Rock my Adidas never rock Fila. *I do not sniff the coke I only smoke sinsemilla*. With my nose I knows and with my scopes I scope. What I live I write and that is strictly rope. I've got science for any occasion. Postulating theorems formulating equations. Cheech wizard in a snow blizzard. Eating chicken gizzards with a girl named Lizzy. Dropping science like when Galileo dropped his orange."

stand together,"I don't see things quite the same as I used to. As I live my life I've got just me to be true to. And when I find that I don't know about. Just what to do. I turn and look within to see what I should do. Now I'm not sure what it takes to be hip. A lot of people making music that to be ain't shit. So I ask creation. For rhymes for this jam. Gimme lickle solo and I'll take the mic stand. . Love vibe. As the earth spins into brand new day. I see the light on the horizons's not fading away. Gonna shine from within like a bright white sun. No need to hide and no place to run. Got the vibrations of the music. Bringing light to your mind. So you can move and groove. And feel the beat of the time. Sense the power in the air as it starts to move. You get a real good feeling that you just can't lose. . Contemplation time, intuition time. Evolution time, resolution time. . Free your mind it's time for good times. And let yourself move it's a time to shine. Spread your wings in the sky, feelin' good inside. Breaking fool with no need to hide. I got the music cuttin' throught me. Takin' control of my soul. I can't hold back I've got to let go. . Stand together people come together now. It's about time we've got to get together y'all."

But freeze feel the breeze if ya sneeze than you're shot. Now ya gotta run what'cha got. Chorus"
super disco breakin',"Well, it's. 50 cups of coffee and you know it's on. I move the crowd to the break of break of dawn. Can't rock the house without the party people. Cause when we're gettin down we are all equal. There's no better or worse between you and me. But I rock the mic so viciously. Like pins and needles and words that sting. At the blink of an eye I will do my thing. Like a needle in the cartridge when the record spins. Like diggin down deep in the record bins. Everybody gettin down make no mistake. Nothing sounds quite like an 8 0 8. Money Makin Money Money Makin Manhattan. Super Disco Disco Breakin'. Sometimes I like to brag sometimes I'm soft spoken. When I'm in Holland I eat the pannenkoeken. I got the spice you bring the sauce. You can kiss my ass you funky boss. Now that you got what you want, you want more. I'll be with the hammer and the nail at your door. With these funky beats I be goin' head huntin'. Shouts to my peeps let me know if you feel something. I can give you all you need. A little beat for the rhythm and some words to read. Let me tell you now that's my favorite shit. And when I got a new rhyme I just say it. So Money Makin Money Money Makin Manhattan. Super Disco Disco Breakin'."

Timing like a clock when I'rock the hip hop. Top notch is my stock on the soap box. I've got more rhymes than I'v got grey hairs. And that's alot because I've got my share. I've got a hole in my head and there's no one. To fix it. Got to straighten my thoughts, I'm thinking too. Much sick shit. Everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes,. Takes.

tadlock's glasses,"Now it's suffice to say that I'm nicer. Nice in the cut and, yes, I'm the slicer. Or should I say I'm the filleter. I hate the game, I hate the player. But don't get discombobulated and upset. Because trust me, we ain't even begun yet. Mike D's got it locked and we rock it nonstop. Adrock's got it locked and we rock it nonstop.

When I'm on the mic I feel good to go. Like a snow day for school with hot cocoa. So don't speak what I heard, just say what I know. And my zodiac sign is Scorpio. Look what the cat dragged in. The creme de la creme without the skin. So take a rest and mind your own biz. And that's it that's all that's all there is. Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you. That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you. One for Brooklyn, two for Manhattan. Let's go to work, get those hands clappin'. Make you bounce, rock, roll and skate. Don't underrate how I operate. It ain't what you say, it's what you mean. Intention leads to action, that is my theme. So pay attention now as I begin to recap. Puttin' words and ideas stacked back to back. Some rhymes go flat, well mine go fizz. I got no time for the drama 'cause stress is for kids. 'Cause when you're dead and buried well you got no biz.

Well I'm a freaky streaker like Winnie the Pooh. T-shirt and no pants and I dance the bugaloo. Like George Whipple on New York One. Got a hairy ass and that's no fun. I'm in the rhyme zone a different time zone. And on the microphone you know that I'm at home. It's time we looked past all our differences. An' that's it that's all that's all there is. Come on.

the move,Hello... It's times like this when I just can't stop. Can't wind your body without the body rock. Got schemes schematics blue prints on file. You gotta have dreams to make it all worthwhile. So as I take my time and realign. I wonder what it is I hope to find. I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast. But I'm intercontinental when I eat french toast. Adrock with the New Addition Edition. Gettin on down for the year 2000. A slight distraction can get you paid. And when it comes to that type shit I paved the way. BBoys to the early morn. BGirls be rockin on and on. BGirls to the break of dawn. BBoys be rockin on and on. Dogs love me cause I'm crazy sniffable. I bet you never knew I got the ill peripheral. In your home I'm cloned I'm on your headphones. I love it when you spazz out all alone. Cause I'm that fool that broke the key. I'm unlockable so don't check me. Got weight on my shoulders and things on my mind. The sky is falling and I'm falling behind. So I synthesize sounds as I patch my brain. Insane mind games move quick like flames. So now I wonder how sometimes you never know. Who be rockin y'all in stereo in stereo in stereo in stereo. No time like the present to work shit out. That's what I'm going on and on and on about. Not fakin just makin beats in the dungeon. Keep that shit funky cause the odor is pungent. No shame in my game just par for the path. I try to hone my craft because at hands the task. But I find I'm not playing with a full deck. I'm up to my neck like Toulouse Lautrec. All I wanna know is when is checkout time. So I could be in heaven with the rhythm rock rhyme. And when I'm with my man Shadi rock at the gates. We'll be rockin rhythms over disco breaks. BBoys to the early morn. BGirls be rockin on and on. BGirls to the break of dawn. BBoys be rockin on and on.

When it comes to keep it real I keep it really wrong. At the risk of sounding crass I would like to mention. That I am well aware of your wack intentions. To usurp my prose you so and so. It's my primary bone of contention. I tell you everybody I've had it. With all these people with static. I'll go insane if it don't rain. Sucker MC's are problematic. I love it when you hit those switches. A curve ball's what my pitch is. So here we here we come. Like dum ditty dum. I keep all five boroughs in stitches. The sound sounds sweeter through the echolex. It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex. Until you feel no pain inside your brain. All your worries are soothed by the sound effects. Read it in the Post and the Daily News. Listen everybody let's show improve. Don't let me begin about heroin. Living six feet deep just ain't the move. We're giving you soul power. I like it sweet and sour. When it comes to rhymes and beat designs. I'm at the control tower. Tell me what makes you so afraid. Of all those people you say you hate. Just give it one time for your mind.
the new style,"And on the cool check in. Center stage on the mic. And we're puttin' it on wax. It's the new style. Four and three and two and one (What up!). And when I'm on the mic - the suckers run (Word!). Down with Adrock and Mike D. and you ain't. And I got more juice than Picasso got paint. Got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick. I'm not surprised you're on my dick. B-E-A-S-T-I-E, what up Mike D.. Ah yeah, that's me. I got franks and pork and beans. Always bust the new routines. I get it - I got it, I know it's good. The rhymes I write - you wish you would I'm never in training - my voice is not straining. People always biting and I'm sick of complaining. So I went into the locker room during classes. Bust into your locker and I smashed your glasses. You're from Secausus - I'm from Manhattan. You're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin'. (bridge) There it is - kick it!!!. Father to many - married to none. And in case you're unaware I carry a gun. Stepped into the party - the place was over packed. Saw the kid that dissed my homey and shot him in the back. I had to get a beeper 'cause my phone is tapped. You better keep your mouth shut 'cause I'm fully strapped. I got money in the bank - I can still get high. That's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly. I've got money and juice - twin sisters in my bed. Their father had envy so I shot him in the head. If I played guitar I'd be Jimmy Page. The girlie's I like are underage (Check it!). Girls with boyfriends are the kind I like. I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike. Your father - he's jealous 'cause I'm making that green. I've got the girlie's numbers from the places I been. (repeat bridge). You wanna know why - because I'm. October 31st - that is my date of birth. I got to the party and I did the Smurf. Taxing all females from coast to coast. And when I get my fill I'm chilly most. We rag-tag girlies back at the hotel. And then we all switch places when I ring the bell. I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best. But I'm fly at Fat Burger when I way out west. K-I-N-G-A-D whammy. All the fly ladies are on my jammy. Went to the prom - wore the fly blue rental. Got six girlies in my Lincoln Continental. Met this girl at the party and she started to flirt. I told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt. Spent some bank - I got a high powered jumbo. Rolled up a wooly and I watched Colombo. Let me clear my throat - Kick it over here baby pop. And let all the fly skimmies, feel the beat...drop. Coolin' on the corner on a hot summer day. Just me, my posse and M.C.A.. A lot of beer - a lot of girls - and a lot of cursing. Twenty-two automatic on my person. Got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger. My posse's gettin' big - and my posse's gettin' bigger. Some voices got treble - some voices got bass. We got the kind of voices that are in your face. Like the bun to the burger - like the burger to the bun. Like the cherry to the apple - to the peach to the plum. I'm the king of the Ave. - and I'm the king of the block. I'm M.C.A. - and I'm the King Adrock. I'm Mike D. - I got all the fly juice. On the checkin' at the party on the forty deuce. Walking down the block with the fresh fly threads. Beastie Boys fly the biggest heads."

You're insecure born in the junkyard with the junk. You've gone wet look crazy and messed with your head. You fucked around and wound up with the bald skin head. You're all mixed up like pasta primavera. Why'd you throw that chair at Geraldo Rivera. Cause one man's ceiling is another man's floor. So get that money out of your ass you whore. I brought her upstairs onto the roof. I dogged your wife and she is a doofus. Clean B cleaning the G spot you know that we've got. Dolemite's house and you have not. Look out my window look over the city. With two black eyes your girl ain't that pretty. Why you wanna beat that brat with a bat. Why you wanna beat your girl like that. Living in the rat race smoking rat weed. You reap what you sow when you plant the seed. Bum cheese on rye with ham and prosciutto. Got more Louie than Phil Rizzuto.

Your sister gave a class A peach-o treat. Her clothes got thinner, I showed her my winner. Beastie beef is now served for dinner. Your sister's def. Later on I came around the way. But sis MCA said he got some play. There had to be a reason for the news I learned. Time to get on it cause it's Mike D.'s turn. Nobody was home, I didn't see the car. She took me downstairs and we crashed the bar. We was chillin in the basement, drinkin' Red Wipple. After a while my head between pink nipples. Grabbin at your sis cause I can't resist. I start to dive, pummel her rumble fish. When I got through, next thing she knew. On her thighs was a beastie tattoo. Your sister's def. That's it, AdRock is pissed. If you leave me in the room with your sister, I'm takin her clit. You can bet if she gets wet. The King AdRock will make her sweat. I throw her down, then take her underwear. Then search 'em so I can eat the pubic hairs. Even in her dream scene, she starts to scream. It's the AdRock inches, and you know what I mean. We had her in the week, your sisters cheap.

I do what I do best because I'm illing and able. Ain't no faking - your money I'm taking. Going coast to coast - watching all the girlies shaking. While you're at the job working nine to five. The Beastie Boys at the Garden - cold kickin' it live. . (bridge) No sleep 'til -. . Another place - another train. Another bottle in the brain. Another girl - another fight. Another drive all night. Our manager's crazy - he always smokes dust. He's got his own room at the back of the bus. Tour around the world - you rock around the clock. Plane to hotel - girls on the jock. We're thrashing hotels like it's going out of style. Getting paid along the way cause it's worth your while. Four on the floor - Adrock's out the door. M.C.A.'s in the back because he's skeezin' with a whore. We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack. With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back. . (repeat bridge). . (repeat chorus). . Ain't seen the light since we started this band. M.C.A. - get on the mic my man. Born and bred Brooklyn - U.S.A.. They all me Adam Yauch - but I'm M.C.A.. Like a lemon to a lime - a lime to a lemon. I sip the def ale with all the fly women. Got limos, arena, TV shows. Autograph pictures and classy hos. Step off homes - get out of my way. Taxing little girlies form here to L.A.. Waking up before I get to sleep. Cause I'll be rocking this party eight days a week. . (repeat chorus)."
so what'cha want,"To mario c. You just running on track. Well just plug me in just like i was eddie harris. You're eating crazy cheese like you would think i'm from paris huhaa. You know i get fly you think i get high. You know that i'm gone and i'ma' tell you all why. So tell me who are you dissin' maybe i'm missin'. The reason that you're smilin' or wildin' so listen. In my head i just want to take 'em down. Imagination set loose and i'm gonna' shake 'em down. Let it flow like a mud slide. When i get on i like to ride and glide. I've got depth of perception in my text y'all. I get props at my mention 'cause i vex y'all. So what'cha what'cha what'cha want what'cha want. You're so funny with my money that you flaunt you flaunt. I said where'd you get your information from huh. You think that you can front when revelation comes. ""yeah you can't front on that"". Well they call me mike d the ever loving man. I'm like spoonie gee well i'm the metropolitician. You scream and you holler about my chevy impala. But the sweat is getting wet around the ring around your collar. But like a dream i'm flowing without no stopping. Sweeter than a cherry pie with ready whip topping. Goin' from mic to mic kickin' it wall to wall. Well i'll be calling out you people like a casting call. Ah well it's wack when you're jacked in the back of a ride. With your know with your flow when you're out getting by. Believe me what you see is what you get. And you see me i'm coming off as you can bet. Well i think i'm losing my mind this time. This time i'm losing my mind that's right. I said i think i'm losing my mind this time. This time i'm losing my mind. ""yeah you can't front on that"". But little do you know about something that i talk. About i'm tired of driving it's due time that i walk haa. About but in the meantime, i'm wise to the demise. I've got eyes in the back of my head so i realize. Ah well i'm dr. Spock i'm here to rock y'all. I want you off the wall if you're playing the wall. I said what'cha what'cha what'cha want what'cha want. I said what'cha what'cha what'cha want what'cha want. Y'all suckers write me checks and then they bounce. So i reach into my pocket for the fresh amount. See i'm the long leaner victor the cleaner. I'm the illest motherfucker from here to gardena. Well i'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce. You've got the rhyme and reason but got no cause. But if you're hot to trot you think you're slicker than grease. I've got news for you crews you'll be sucking like a leach. ""yeah you can't front on that"". So what'cha what'cha what'cha want what'cha want. So what'cha what'cha what'cha want so what'cha want. I said what'cha what'cha what'cha want what'cha want. I said what'cha what'cha what'cha want so what'cha want"
alive,"I have never been more ready in my entire life to do this right now. It’s all been leading up to this moment. All right now, right here. My whole life. We’ve got rhyme selection in a wide array. J’ai des bonbons pour vous, mangez. The party people scream “Oui oui c’est vrai!”. ‘cause I got a remote for my bidet. A.D.R.O.C.K.. I use the microphone like Picasso used clay. Down with freckles from around the bay. Peace to Bambaataa and Jazzy Jay. I rock on the mic from here to Bombay. I give it my best to say come what may. ‘Cause everybody’s got their dues to pay. I’m looking sideways like my man Pele. Getting’ on like Ali Boom ba yay. So fed up with racism today. Time to speak up and not turn away. Make the sun shine when it’s cloudy and gray. Dip dip dive, so-socialize. Open up your ears and clean out your eyes. If you learn to love you’re in for a surprise. It could be nice to be alive. I’m talking doody rhymes to a brand new height. I shine on the mic like UltraBite. Created a monster with these rhymes I write. Goatee metal rap please say goodnight. Now here’s a little song that you might not like. My DJ’s name is Mix Master Mike. It’s a real pity that you people gotta bite. But I can understand ‘cause he sounds so nice. Reading you the news ‘cause I’m Country Mike. Use a microphone like Shazaam uses tights. Try to keep clear of that hate and spite. So I keep my mind still like the still of night. Now who in the world do you want to fight. It’s against the system that we should unite. Homophobics ain’t alright. If you learn to love then you might love life. Dip dip dive, so-socialize. Open up your ears and clean out your eyes. If you learn to love you’re in for a surprise. It could be nice to be alive. Brining back that old New York Rap. Now you can shuffle numbers but facts is facts. So many billionaires while so many lack. So before the poor decides to react. Come on party people and share up your stack. Now, I’m a break it down to the brass tacks. Do the Biz Mark dance and the cabbage patch. You try to turn the key but you broke the latch. Sneak into my files for some rhymes to snatch. I’d like to have a say on the income tax. Don’t want to help build bombs and that’s the fact. No money for health care so what’s the catch. The man got you locked with no key to the latch. Mike and Adam have got my back. You bring the mic and we’ll bring the rap. Turn on the P.A. and rock your shack. Don’t smoke Cheeba, can’t stand crack. Dip dip dive, so-socialize. Open up your ears and clean out your eyes. If you learn to love you’re in for a surprise. It could be nice to be alive."
deal with it,Rob and Steal from the Health Food Store. The ideas you shout that are so hardcore. Screaming at the phone man collecting the change. Ideas discovered then rearranged. . I won't say that life's a bitch and then you die. Because I do my best to enjoy mine. You can't bring me down to a world of self pitty [sic]. Lot's of ways to deal with it. Deal with it. . You do unto others like they're pieces of shit. A rightous [sic] man who's flipping the script. There's plenty of room for everyone at the table. Check yourself before you check the label. . I won't live life being mad holding a grudge. It's not my place - sitting back playing judge. Not enough time to always stay mad. May as well be glad to Deal With It. Deal With It.

slow and low,"(chorus) Let it flow - let yourself go. Slow and low - that is the tempo. . It's never old school - all brand new. So everybody catch - the bugaloo flu. Not like a fever - not like a cold. The beats are clear - the rhymes are bold. So don't see a doctor or see a nurse. Just listen to the music - first things first. First of all - get off the wall. It's time to party so have a ball. Because we slowed it on down - so get the hell up. Like a volcano I'll erupt. We got determination - bass and highs. White Castle fries only come in one size. What you see is what you get. And you ain't seen - nothing yet. . (repeat chorus). . I do not sing - but I make a Def song. You could live your whole life - and I hope you live long. On the Gong Show we won't get gonged. We're the Beastie Boys - not Cheech and Chong. Strong as an ox - fresh out the box. The crowd is so live - they're coming in flocks. And when we go on - the crowd goes off. It's all hard rock - there's nothing soft. (repeat chorus). We don't only rock the house but we'll house we rock. We don't stroll but we roll straight to the top. M.C.A., Adrock, Mike D. makes three. And we can do it like this in the place to be. When I'm recorded - you'll be rewarded. I know my song is Def 'cause you all applauded. Not P.C.P. or L.S.D. - just me Mike D. in the place to be. This is not free - you must pay a fee. Cash on delivery like a C.O.D.. (repeat chorus). The beat is slow in order to dance. I wanna hear I dos and no I can't. First you move your legs - and then your arms. It's not fast and nervous - this dance is calm. It's truly stable and you ought to be able. To dance to the record when it's on the turntable. (repeat chorus)."
and me,Once again I'm all wrapped up in me. My best friend's my own worst enemy. Electricity and gravity. Oh my god now take a look at me. My life line's run by AT&T. They got their wires all up in me. Is push and pull the way it's got to be. Once again I'm all wrapped up in me and me.
rhymin' and stealin',"Because mutiny on the bounty's what we're all about. I'm gonna board your ship and turn it on out. No soft sucker with a parrot on his shoulder. 'Cause I'm bad gettin' bolder - cold getting colder. Terrorizing suckers on the seven seas. And if you've got beef - you'll get capped in the knees. We got sixteen men on a dead man's chest. And I shot those suckers and I'll shoot the rest. . (chorus) Most illingest b-boy - I got that feeling. Cause I am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin'. . Snatching gold chains - vicking pieces of eight. I got your money and your honey and the fly name plate. We got wenches on the benches - and bitties with titties. Housing all girlies from city to city. One for all and all for one. Taking out M.C.'s with a big shotgun. All for one and one for all. Because the Beastie Boys have gone A.W.O.L.. Friggin' in the riggin' and cuttin' your throat. Big biting suckers getting thrown in the moat. We got maidens and wenches - man they're on the ace. Captain Bly is gonna die when we break his face. . (repeat chorus). . Ali Baba and the forty thieves. . Torching and crakin' and rhymin' and stealin'. Robbin' and raping - busting two in the ceiling. I'm wheeling' - I'm dealin' - I'm drinking, not thinking. Never cower, never shower - and I'm always stinking. Yo ho ho and a pint of Brass Monkey. And when my girlie shakes her hips - she sure gets funky. Skirt chasing, free basing - killing every village. We drink and rob and rhyme and pillage. . (repeat chorus). . I've been drinking my rum - a Def son of a gun. I fought the law and I cold won. Black Beard's weak - Moby Dick's on the tick. 'Cause I pull out my jammy and squeeze off six. My pistol is loaded - I shot Betty Crocker. Deliver Colonel Sanders down to Davey Jones' locker. Rhymin' and stealin' in a drunken state. And I'll be rockin' my rhymes all the way to Hell's gate. . (repeat chorus)."

an open letter to nyc,"Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten. From the Battery to the top of Manhattan. Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin. Black, White, New York you make it happen. Brownstones, water towers, trees, skyscrapers. Writers, prize fighters and Wall Street traders. We come together on the subway cars. Diversity unified, whoever you are. We're doing fine on the One and Nine line. On the L we're doin' swell. On the number Ten bus we fight and fuss. 'Cause we're thorough in the boroughs and that's a must. I remember when the Duece was all porno flicks. Running home after school to play PIX * 1. At lunch I'd go to Blimpies down on Montague Street. And hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet. Dear New York I hope you're doing well. I know a lot's happen and you've been through hell. So, we give thanks for providing a home. Through your gates at Ellis Island we passed in droves. Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten. From the Battery to the top of Manhattan. Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin. Black, White, New York you make it happen. The L.I.E. the B.Q.E. Hippies at the band shell with the L.S.D.. Get my BVD's from VIM. You know I'm reppin' Manhattan the best I can. Stopped off at Bleeker Bob's got thrown out. Sneakin' in at 4:00 am after going out. You didn't rob me in the park at Dianna Ross. But everybody started looting when the light went off. From the South South Bronx on out to Queens Bridge. From Hollis Queens right down to Bay Ridge. From Castle Hill to the Lower East Side. From 1010 WINS to Live At Five. Dear New York this is a love letter. To you and how you brought us together. We can't say enough about all you do. 'Cause in the city were ourselves and electric too. Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten. From the Battery to the top of Manhattan. Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin. Black, White, New York you make it happen. Shout out the South Bronx where my mom hails from. Right next to High Bridge across from Harlem. To the Grand Concourse where my mom and dad met. Before they moved on down to the Upper West. I see you're still strong after all that's gone on. Life long we dedicate this song. Just a little something to show some respect. To the city that blends and mends and tests. Since 911 we're still livin'. And lovin' life we've been given. Ain't nothing gonna take that away from us. Were lookin' pretty and gritty 'cause in the city we trust. Dear New York I know a lot has changed. 2 towers down but you're still in the game. Home to many rejecting know one. Accepting peoples of all places, wherever they're from. Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten. From the Battery to the top of Manhattan. Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin. Black, White, New York you make it happen"

(you gotta) fight for your right (to party!),"Kick it!. [Verse 1]. You wake up late for school, man, you don't wanna go. You ask your mom please,. but she still says no. You missed two classes and no homework. But your teacher preaches class. like you're some kind of jerk. [Refrain]. You gotta fight for your right to party. [Verse 2]. Your pop caught you smoking, and he said: ""No way!"". That hypocrite smokes two packs a day. Man, living at home is such a drag. Now your mom threw away your best porno mag. (Busted!). [Refrain]. You gotta fight for your right to party. You gotta fight. [Verse 3]. Don't step out of this house. if that's the clothes you're gonna wear. I'll kick you out of my home. if you don't cut that hair. Your mom busted in and said, ""What's that noise?"". Aw, Mom, you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys. [Refrain]. You gotta fight for your right to party. You gotta fight for your right to party. [Outro]. Parrrrrrty. Parrrrrrty. Yeah!"
3 minute rule,"Now here we go dropping science dropping it all over. Like bumping around the town like when you're driving a Range Rover. Expanding the horizons and expanding the parameters. Expanding the rhymes of sucker M.C. amateurs. Naugels, Isaac Newton Scientific E.Z.. Ben Franklin with the kite getting over with the key. Rock shocking the mic as many times times the times tables. Rock well to tell dispel all of the old fables. I've been dropping the new science and kicking the new knowledge. An M.C. to a degree that you can't get in college. The dregs of the earth and the eggs that I eat. I've got pegs through my hands and one through my feet. Shea Stadium the radium E M D squared. Got kicked out of the Palladium you think that I cared. It's the sound of science. Public service announcement time and money for girls covered with honey. You lie and aspire to be as cunning. Reeling and rockin' and rollin' B size D cup. Order the quarter deluxe why don't you wake up. My mind is kinda flowin like an oil projector. Had to get up to get the Jimmy protector. Went berserk and worked and exploded. She woke up in the morning and her face was coated. Buddy you study the man on the mic. D. do what you like. Drunk a skunk am I from the celebration. To peep that freak unique penetration. I figured out who makes the crack. It's the suckers with the badges and the blue jackets. A professor of science cause I keep droppin' it. I smell weak cause you keep poppin' it. People always asking what's the phenomenon. Yo what's up know what's going on. No one really knows what I'm talking about. Yeah that's right my name's Yauch. Ponce De Leon constantly on. The fountain of youth not Robotron. Peace is a word I've heard before. So move and move and move upon the dance floor. I'm gonna die gonna die one day. Cause I'm goin and goin and goin this way. Not like a roach or a piece of toast. I'm going out first class not going out coach. Rock my Adidas never rock Fila. *I do not sniff the coke I only smoke sinsemilla*. With my nose I knows and with my scopes I scope. What I live I write and that is strictly rope. I've got science for any occasion. Postulating theorems formulating equations. Cheech wizard in a snow blizzard. Eating chicken gizzards with a girl named Lizzy. Dropping science like when Galileo dropped his orange."
3 the hard way,"Fresh dressed 'cause I shop at Models. Deep in Brooklyn I ride the elevated trains. Used to ride the D to beat the morning bell. At Edward R. Morrow out on Ave L.

You try to vex reject but you should respect. Or we'll have JC send you out a FedEx * 1. So don't start to flex up in the discotheque. Or we'll make you extinct tyrannosaurus rex. We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way. Your rhyme technique, it is antique. To all my heads Qu'est-ce-que tu fabriques?. Que cosa fai? Come sta e?. Ho fato molte telefonate. Oops gotcha clutch like Plazza. Sneak between the sheets so hide like matzoh. Holler back challah bread... next. We are the crew who put the crew in Cruex. I can see that Def Jam doesn't recognize me. I'm Mike D the one who put the satin in your panties. Time to count MC's in this place to be. Not five, not four, not two, just three. We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way. Round-house kick the mic out your hand. Drunken mantis, my name brand. So if you're slick with the tricks and the slight of hand. I'm hip top the shit that you're trying to scam. Gnip Gnop I got shit to pop. I'm an exceptional professional that just don't stop. So pack up your bag and your mic and don't wait. E.T. phone home now get the fuck out my face. You know we shake'em bake'em then we take'em. Treat MCs like leaves go out and rake'em. If you sell our CDs on Canal before we make'em.

alive,"I have never been more ready in my entire life to do this right now. It’s all been leading up to this moment. All right now, right here. My whole life. We’ve got rhyme selection in a wide array. J’ai des bonbons pour vous, mangez. The party people scream “Oui oui c’est vrai!”. ‘cause I got a remote for my bidet. A.D.R.O.C.K.. I use the microphone like Picasso used clay. Down with freckles from around the bay. Peace to Bambaataa and Jazzy Jay. I rock on the mic from here to Bombay. I give it my best to say come what may. ‘Cause everybody’s got their dues to pay. I’m looking sideways like my man Pele. Getting’ on like Ali Boom ba yay. So fed up with racism today. Time to speak up and not turn away. Make the sun shine when it’s cloudy and gray. Dip dip dive, so-socialize. Open up your ears and clean out your eyes. If you learn to love you’re in for a surprise. It could be nice to be alive. I’m talking doody rhymes to a brand new height. I shine on the mic like UltraBite. Created a monster with these rhymes I write. Goatee metal rap please say goodnight. Now here’s a little song that you might not like. My DJ’s name is Mix Master Mike. It’s a real pity that you people gotta bite. But I can understand ‘cause he sounds so nice. Reading you the news ‘cause I’m Country Mike. Use a microphone like Shazaam uses tights. Try to keep clear of that hate and spite. So I keep my mind still like the still of night. Now who in the world do you want to fight. It’s against the system that we should unite. Homophobics ain’t alright. If you learn to love then you might love life. Dip dip dive, so-socialize. Open up your ears and clean out your eyes. If you learn to love you’re in for a surprise. It could be nice to be alive. Brining back that old New York Rap. Now you can shuffle numbers but facts is facts. So many billionaires while so many lack. So before the poor decides to react. Come on party people and share up your stack. Now, I’m a break it down to the brass tacks. Do the Biz Mark dance and the cabbage patch. You try to turn the key but you broke the latch. Sneak into my files for some rhymes to snatch. I’d like to have a say on the income tax. Don’t want to help build bombs and that’s the fact. No money for health care so what’s the catch. The man got you locked with no key to the latch. Mike and Adam have got my back. You bring the mic and we’ll bring the rap. Turn on the P.A. and rock your shack. Don’t smoke Cheeba, can’t stand crack. Dip dip dive, so-socialize. Open up your ears and clean out your eyes. If you learn to love you’re in for a surprise. It could be nice to be alive."

an open letter to nyc,"Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten. From the Battery to the top of Manhattan. Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin. Black, White, New York you make it happen. Brownstones, water towers, trees, skyscrapers. Writers, prize fighters and Wall Street traders. We come together on the subway cars. Diversity unified, whoever you are. We're doing fine on the One and Nine line. On the L we're doin' swell. On the number Ten bus we fight and fuss. 'Cause we're thorough in the boroughs and that's a must. I remember when the Duece was all porno flicks. Running home after school to play PIX * 1. At lunch I'd go to Blimpies down on Montague Street. And hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet. Dear New York I hope you're doing well. I know a lot's happen and you've been through hell. So, we give thanks for providing a home. Through your gates at Ellis Island we passed in droves. Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten. From the Battery to the top of Manhattan. Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin. Black, White, New York you make it happen. The L.I.E. the B.Q.E. Hippies at the band shell with the L.S.D.. Get my BVD's from VIM. You know I'm reppin' Manhattan the best I can. Stopped off at Bleeker Bob's got thrown out. Sneakin' in at 4:00 am after going out. You didn't rob me in the park at Dianna Ross. But everybody started looting when the light went off. From the South South Bronx on out to Queens Bridge. From Hollis Queens right down to Bay Ridge. From Castle Hill to the Lower East Side. From 1010 WINS to Live At Five. Dear New York this is a love letter. To you and how you brought us together. We can't say enough about all you do. 'Cause in the city were ourselves and electric too. Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten. From the Battery to the top of Manhattan. Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin. Black, White, New York you make it happen. Shout out the South Bronx where my mom hails from. Right next to High Bridge across from Harlem. To the Grand Concourse where my mom and dad met. Before they moved on down to the Upper West. I see you're still strong after all that's gone on. Life long we dedicate this song. Just a little something to show some respect. To the city that blends and mends and tests. Since 911 we're still livin'. And lovin' life we've been given. Ain't nothing gonna take that away from us. Were lookin' pretty and gritty 'cause in the city we trust. Dear New York I know a lot has changed. 2 towers down but you're still in the game. Home to many rejecting know one. Accepting peoples of all places, wherever they're from. Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten. From the Battery to the top of Manhattan. Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin. Black, White, New York you make it happen"
and me,Once again I'm all wrapped up in me. My best friend's my own worst enemy. Electricity and gravity. Oh my god now take a look at me. My life line's run by AT&T. They got their wires all up in me. Is push and pull the way it's got to be. Once again I'm all wrapped up in me and me.

b-boy bouillabaisse - a year and a day,"M.C. for what I AM and do. the A is for Adam and the lyrics; true. so as pray and hope and the message is sent. and I AM living in the dreams that I have dreamt. because I'm down with the three the unstoppable three. me and Adam and D. were born to M.C.. and my body and soul and mind are pure. not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure. just lyrics from I to you recited. arrested, bailed but cuffed and indicted. enter the arena as I take center stage. the lights set low and the night has come of age. take the microphone in hand as that I am a professional. speak my knowledge to the crowd and the ed. is special. for I AM a bard but not the last one. I'm my own king and this is my castle. dwell in realms of now but vidi those of the past. seen a glimpse from ahead and I don't think it's gonna last. and you can bet your ass. I drop the L. when I'm skiing. I'm smoking and peaking. I put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend. can't stop the mindfuck when it's rolling along. can't stop the smooth runnin's when the shit's running strong. broke my bindings the lion with wings. preaching his word in the B. Boy sing. I AM one with myself as I turn to The. I prefer the dreams to reality. I prefer my life don't need no other man's wife. don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife. but it's good to have turn to be a king for a day. or for a week or for a year or for a year in a day. come what may. I'm fishing with my boat and I'm fishing for trout. mix the Bass Ale with the Guiness Stout. fishing for a line inside my brain. and looking out at the world through my window pane. every day has many colors cuz the glass is stained. everything has changed but remains the same. so once again the mirror raised and I see myself as clear as day. and I AM going to the limits of my ultimate destiny. feeling as though Somebody were testing me. He who sees the end from the beginning of time. looking forward through all the ages is, was and always shall be. check the prophetic sections of the pages. He goes by the name of Disco Dave."
b-boy bouillabaisse - dropping names,He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost. She's slippin through his fingers as she's movin' out to the coast. If your world was all black and if your world was all white. Then you wouldn't get much color out of life now right. Nicknamed Shamrock my name is not Shamus. Girlies on the tippy cause my homie is famous. My name is not O'Houigheighi Norisit Brian. If I said that I was weak you know I'd be lyin'.

Pulling out knots pulling in residuals. Go to the movies get the Rolos the cholos riding slow and low. Mike on the mic and bust with the solo. Mike my stromy don't be so selfish. Get on the mic cause you know you eat shellfish
b-boy bouillabaisse - hello brooklyn,New York New York it's a hell of a town. The Bronx is up and I'm Brooklyn down. They don't know my name they only know my initials. Building bombs in the attic for elected officials. I quit my job I cut my hair. I cut my boss cause I don't care. You tried to get slick you bust a little chuckle. You're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle. Cause being as fly as me is something you never thought of. You'll be sticking up old ladies with the hand gun or the sawed-off. Like a buffalo soldier I'm broader than Broadway. Keep keepin' on I don't care what they say. I play my stereo loud it disturbs my neighbors. I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor. I am the holder of the 3-pack Bonanza. If you open the book then you will get your hand slapped. I am the keeper of the 3-pack Bonanza. If you ask a question you will get the answer. Her breast I saw I reached I felt. M.O.N.E.Y. the belt. I stay at home just like a hermit. I got the jammy but I don't got the permit. Yes you got a boyfriend and indeed his name is Slick Nick. that is why Annabelle you're caught with the shrimpy limp dick trick. I ride around town cause my ride is fly. I shot a man in Brooklyn *just to watch him die*.
b-boy bouillabaisse - lay it on me,Chinese eyes and Chinese suits. Smokin' much Buddha and smokin' much boots. More updated on the hip-hop lingo. My favorite New York Knick was Hawthorne Wingo. Met a girl at a party and I gave her my card. You know that it said Napoleon Bonaparte. Peepin' out the colors I be buggin' on Cezanne. They call me Mike D Joe Blow the Lover Man. Your face turns red as your glass of wine. You spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time. Girl you should be with me you should drop that bum. Cause I got more flavor than Fruit Striped Gum. With that big round butt of yours. I'd like to butter your muffin I'm not bluffin'. Serve you on a platter like Thanksgiving stuffin'.
b-boy bouillabaisse - mike on the mic,I met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle. I laid the bait and then she took the tackle. Had too much to drink at the Red Lobster. Now the room is spinning around like the blades of a helicopter. I never met a girl that was too finicky. If the press has their way then they're going to finish me. You might know this but you've never been this see. If I ate spinach then I'd be called Spinach D. I shed light like cats shed fur. Ride around town like Raymond Burr. I'm so high that they call me Your Highness. If you don't know me then pardon my shyness. I live in the Village wherever I go I walk to. Keepin' my friends around so I have someone to talk to. I play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it. It's a trip it's got a funky beat and I can bug out to it.
b-boy bouillabaisse - stop that train,It's 4:00 a.m. I've got the Dr. Hfuhruhurr Ale. I've got nothing to lose so I'm pissin' on the third rail. Groggy eyed and fried I'm headed for the station. D-Train ride Coney Island vacation. Dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1 train. They'll be kicking out windows high on cocaine. Jump the turnstyle I lost my last token. Riding between the cars pissing smoking. Also finger popping. Two bums fucking I seen them rocking. Head for the last car fluorescent light blackout. Policeman told my homeboy put that crack out. You know you light up when the lights go down. Read the New York Post Fulton St. downtown. Same faces every day but you don't know their names. Party people going placed on the D-Train. French trench coat wing tip going to work. Pulling a train like Captain Kirk. Pick pocket gangsters paying their debts. Caught a bullet in the lung from Bernie Goetz. Overworked and underpaid staring at the floor. Prostitutes spandex caught in the ding dong doors. Stuck between the stations it seems like an eternity. Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity. $50.00 fine for disturbing the peace. The neck tortoise the Lees creased. Hot cup of coffee and the donuts are Dunkin. Friday night and Jamaica Queens funkin. Elevated platform never gonna conform. Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm. Bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes. Over the loud speaker about the hard times. Sat across from a man readin El Diario. Riding the train down from El Barrio. Went from the station straight to Orange Julius. Bought a hot dog from my man George Drakoulias.

bodhisattva vow,"As I Develop The Awakening Mind I Praise The Buddha As They Shine. I Bow Before You As I Travel My Path To Join Your Ranks,. I Make My Full Time Task. For The Sake Of All Beings I Seek. The Enlighted Mind That I Know I'll Reap. Respect To Shantideva And All The Others. Who Brought Down The Darma For Sisters And Brothers. I Give Thanks For This World As A Place To Learn. And For This Human Body That I'm Glad To Have Earned. And My Deepest Thanks To All Sentient Beings. For Without Them There Would Be No Place To Learn What I'm Seeing. There's Nothing Here That's Not Been Said Before. But I Put It Down Now So I'll Be Sure. To Solidify My Own Views And I'll Be Glad If It Helps. Anyone Else Out Too. . If Others Disrespect Me Or Give Me Flack. I'll Stop And Think Before I React. Knowing That They're Going Through Insecure Stages. I'll Take The Opportunity To Exercise Patience. I'll See It As A Chance To Help The Other Person. Nip It In The Bud Before It Can Worsen. A Change For Me To Be Strong And Sure. As I Think On The Buddhas Who Have Come Before. As I Praise And Respect The Good They've Done. Knowing Only Love Can Conquer In Every Situation. We Need Other People In Order To Create. The Circumstances For The Learning That We're Here To Generate. Situations That Bring Up Our Deepest Fears. So We Can Work To Release Them Until They're Cleared. Therefore, It Only Makes Sense. To Thank Our Enemies Despite Their Intent. . The Bodhisattva Path Is One Of Power And Strength. A Strength From Within To Go The Length. Seeing Others Are As Important As Myself. I Strive For A Happiness Of Mental Wealth. With The Interconnectedness That We Share As One. Every Action That We Take Affects Everyone. So In Deciding For What A Situation Calls. There Is A Path For The Good For All. I Try To Make My Every Action For That Highest Good. With The Altruistic Wish To Achive Buddhahood. So I Pledge Here Before Everyone Who's Listening. To Try To Make My Every Action For The Good Of All Beings. For The Rest Of My Lifetimes And Even Beyond. I Vow To Do My Best To Do No Harm. And In Times Of Doubt I Can Think On The Dharma."
body movin',"Body movin, body movin,. A1 sound, sound so soothing. Body movin, body movin,. We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin. Let me get some action from the back section.

Tell me party people is that so wrong. The ship is docking, inter-lockin. And up-rockin electro-shocking. We're getting down computer action. Do the robotic satisfaction.

Came out rapping when I was born. Mom said rock it 'til the break of dawn. Puttin bodies in motion cause I got the notion. Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion. The sound of the music makin you insane. You can't explain to people this type of mind frame. Like a bottle of Chateau Neuf Du Pap. I'm fine like wine when I start to rap.

MCA where have you been. Packed like sardines in the tin. So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins. Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim. Adrock light up the place. And if you pull my card you pull the ace. And if you ask me turn up the bass. And if you play defender I could be your hyper space. Body movin, body movin,. A1 sound, sound so soothing. Body movin, body movin,. We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin. Body movin'"

Me and the crew, we're drinking Brass Monkey. This girl walked by she gave me the eye. I reached in the locker grabbed the Spanish Fly. I put it with the Monkey mixed it in the cup. Went over to the girl, ""Yo baby, what's up?"". I offered her a sip, the girl she gave me lip. It did begin the stuff wore in and now she's on my tip. Brass Monkey, that funky Monkey.

car thief,Some static started in the pool hall. In a motherfucker's face with the cue ball. Then I met this girl she tried to gank me. So I smacked her in the pocket with M.C. Plank Bee. Me and my crew out breaking windows. The bingo the lotto you know I'll never win those. Possession is half the law. I had my routines before all y'all. Your whole life is coming apart at the seams. You ain't nothing but a car thief biting routines. I'm a city slicker I ain't no townie. Right now I wish I had another hash brownie. Like Ricky always said you've got to toke and pass. Or Mookie's gonna kick your fuckin' ass. You try to take what isn't yours like a God damn rat. *See personally I wouldn't want to go out like that*. I'm a writer a poet a genius I know it. I don't buy cheeba I grow it. *I'm a farmer* people always trying to get next to me. But I'm down with Jalil Donkey and Ecstasy. Smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer. Because I had to deal with a money hungry miser. Had a caine filled Kool with my man Rush Rush. Saw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush. You be doing nose candy on the Bowie Coke Mirror. My girl asked for some but I pretended not to hear her. You can't deny me you always want to try me. You're just gonna get your ass kicked. Homeboy throw in the towel. Your girl got dicked by Ricky Powell. The Godfather of Soul is in the belly of the beast. For smoking that dust at St. Anthony's Feast. Sometimes you've got to let someone trip on their own shoelace before you tell them to tie their shoe. All the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters. Sitting in the White House pulling their peters. Buy me cheeba from the cop down the street. The only cop with a rope chain walking the beat. Like a sneaky pouch time bomb tickin'. Like the beat to my rhyme just kickin'. Space cake cookies I discover who I am. I'm a dusted old bummy Hurdy Gurdy Man. Five-O caught me now I'm going to the mountains. Said good-bye to my girl my lawyers and accountants. My mind is kinda rhymin and I think I oughta think. So I'm rockin all the rhymes and I'll have another drink. So the lights are flashing my mind is spinning. I feel like it is always the beginning. Of another rhyme I'm rapping M.C.'ing I rock. You ain't nothing but a car thief who must be stopped.

Don't play no game that I can't win. (Danger). Don't play no game that I can't win. Don't play no game that I can't win. Keep the competition in check. You draft your plans at your drafting desk. You try to play to win but now you lost. Like clams with no tartar sauce. Scheming in the attic, thought you had it. So dramatic, I got the stats, mathematics. Automatic, systematic. She's super bad now, whatcha, watcha want now?. I know the danger of a man. (That's danger). Who's been to hell and back again. (Danger). Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been. (That's danger). Don't play no game that I can't win. (Danger). Don't play no game that I can't win. (Danger). Don't play no game that I can't win. (Danger). Don't play no game that I can't win. (Danger). Don't play no game that I can't win. (That's danger). Don't play no game that I can't win. (Danger, danger). Don't play no game that I can't win. (That's danger). I know the danger of a man. (That's danger). Who's been to hell and back again. (Danger). I know the danger of a man. (That's danger). Who's been to hell and back again. (Danger). Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been.

Been nice and all that, c'mon and I'm a keep goin' yup. Bound to make money off the shit that I'm growing. Like that y'all and you don't quit. Keep it on y'all rock the sure shit. I put the pen to the paper and I went off. I'm dropping knowledge and wisdom like a mad head dog. Step into the function 'cause I'm representing. Lyrics on the brain and they sit fermenting. I try to go and learn the give and the go. Free up my mind let loose with the lyric flow. Trying to get Frank get back, get back, right. Trying to stay positive and feeling alright. It's like that y'all and ya don't quit. ""Keep goin' on and on and on and on and on"". So pass the pen and then pass the pad. Like DJ Run there was nothin' ever like the. The sex rhyme kid is back in the panic. Gonna drop the ball on my damn mechanic whoo. Fuckin' up my Nova, naw fuckin' up my life, shit. Fuckin' with my world, cause he's fuckin' with the pipe, aw damn. Like the saying goes, you gotta call and duke it off. Ask Juanito, he'll tell you all about it. Gettin' blind in the mind, two hits and a cough. Put my pager on vibrate, and jerk myself off,. Weight on my shoulders and now I'm stressin'. Gotta get back and count my blessings. Stuck on my cellular, I can't get off. This ride is in motion and I can't get let off. Get my penis double clepped and my balls rotated what... Realized I was trying to get my brain notated. It's like that y'all and ya don't quit. It's like that y'all and ya don't quit. It's like that y'all and ya don't quit. It's like that y'all and ya don't quit"

eggman,I looked out the window and seen his bald head. I ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg. Scoped him with my scopes he had no hair. Launched that shot and he was caught out there. Saw the convertible driving by. Loaded up the slingshot and let one fly. He went for his to find he didn't have one. Put him in check correct with my egg gun. The egg a symbol of life. Go inside your house and bust out your wife. Pulled out the jammy he thought it was a joke. The trigger I pulled his face the yoke. Reached in his pocket took all his cash. Left my man standing with an egg moustache. Suckers they come a dime a dozen. And when I say dozen you know what I'm talking about. Humpty Dumpty was a big fat egg. He was playing the wall and then he broke his leg. Tossed it out the window three minutes hot. Hit the Rastaman he said *bloodclot*. Which came first the chicken or the egg. I egged the chicken then I ate his leg. Riding the trains in between cars. When I pull out the station *you're gonna get yours*. Drive by eggings plaguing L.A.. *Yo they just got my little cousin ese*. Sometimes hard boiled sometimes runny. It comes from a chicken not a bunny dummy. People laugh it's no joke. My name's Yauch and I'm throwing the yoke. *Now they got me in a cell* but I don't care. It was then that I caught catching people out there. We all dressed in black we snuck up around the back. We began to attack the eggs did crack on Haze's back. Sam I am down with the program. Green eggs and ham Yosemite Sam. Come Halloween you know I come strapped. I throw it at a sucker K-pap. You made the mistake you judge a man by his race. You go through life with egg on your face. You woke up in the morning with a peculiar feeling. You looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling. Families puck rocks the businessman. I'll dog anybody with an egg in my hand. Not like the crack that you put in a pipe. But crack on your forehead here's a towel now wipe.
electrify,Words comin forth like water from the tap. Clap tracks line the spaces places papers people stack. Back track through the minutes when the thoughts went insane. I pulled the picture off the cover and blew out the mind games. People say this is the playlist of the void non-bound. But I can say this is the plainness of the peace I've found. It's not the sorrow or the pity that we hope to dismantle. It's the cast of past dice lighting both ends of the candles. Scandelescent in the means I have dreamed on the schemes. Reunited in the times of such picturesque scenes. Can I get a witness to testify. Open your eyes realize electrify. So I plan and I scam and write it off on my taxes. It's times like these I'll just go with the decisions of the masses. And to the crowds who've come before with their profit massing ways. To the greed that fucked it up and brought it down to today. With pain I stand sane and remain holding strong. Whilst all around me those who clowned me are now drowning by the throngs. It's illogical the actions that are typically displayed. A set back ain't all that much problem to invade. So I will glow like a lantern on a new moon night. I'll fight violence with these hands that weren't built to fight. But like a furnace burning coal my goals are bound to burn in flames. Whether achieved or dismantled by the agendas displayed. Can I get a witness to testify?. Open your eyes realize electrify.

flowin' prose,"I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros. I'm scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know. But beyond the concepts and emotions that rise. To the interconnectedness that underlies. The lies upon lies have lost their meaning. The plies upon plies of consciousness that is being. Over and over I fall I learned to walk from a crawl. It's not sad it's just the way and the purpose of it all. Now every word that you heard that I said that you felt. Was put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt. I steal feels from reels but I pay my respects. Paying compliments and disses and deciphering affects. Words are water as I court her, as she is pristine. Words and mics fall to dust and all that's left is the feelings. I give in and I win I try to never complain. Intentions venture to center and then they set the stage. But I'll remain sane making gain without pain. Staining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain. And keep it positive as painstaking as it is. I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live. So like a cloud carries rain I'm gonna carry my rhyme. Coming like thunder with lightening timing. No hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans. Ferment time like wine no ploys or scams. Like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas. Ideas coming to me in answer to my pleas. Woke up this morning right out of a dream. Reached for my pen and pad because my mind was on a rhyme scheme. What can I do with these bones and flesh?. With these animated thoughts in a world repressed?. I'm going down like the rhythms on the winds of change. I'm keeping calm under pressure like a deep-sea range. I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros. I'm like Toucan Sam when I follow my nose. I'm giving shouts to Gandhi, Gravy and King. His Holiness and all enlightened beings. I'll be the one who screams it on the microphone. I'll be the one who brings it inside your home. But the words ain't mine I just pass em along. For Betty Williams and her friends I sing this song. And more ink from my pen and more tears from my eyes. And more crimes are committed as I say these lines."

And I can always make them smile. From White Castle to the Nile. Back in the day. There was this girl who ran away. She liked my home-piece M.C.A.. He said he would not give her play. I asked him, ""Please?"" - he said, ""You may."". Her pants were tight and that's ok. If she would dance - I would D.J.. We took a walk down to the bay. I hope she'll say, ""Hey me and you should hit the hay!"". I asked her out - she said, ""No way!"". I should have probably guessed they're gay. So I broke north with no delay. I heard she moved real far away. That was two years ago this May. I saw her just the other day. Jockin' Mike D. to my dismay. Girls - to do the dishes. Girls - to clean up my room.

hey ladies,Hey ladies in the place I'm callin' out to ya. There never was a city kid truer and bluer. There's more to me than you'll ever know. And I've got more hits than Sadaharu Oh. Ton Thumb Tom Cushman or Tom Foolery. Date women on T.V. with the help of Chuck Woolery. Words are flowing out just like the Grand Canyon. And I'm always out looking for a female companion. I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib. I took off her moccasins and put on my bib. I'm wheelin' and dealin' I make a little bit of stealing. I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peeling. Your body's on time and your mind is appealing. Staring at the cracks up there upon the ceiling. Some such nonsense is the bass that I'm throwing. Talking to a girl telling her I'm all knowing. She's talking to the kid to the who. I'm telling here every lie that you know that I never did. Me in the corner with a good looking daughter. I dropped my drawers and it was welcome back Kotter. We were cutting up the rug she started cutting up the carpet. In my apartment I begged her please stop it. The gift of gab is the gift that I have. And that girl ain't nothing but the blue plate crab. Special at Woodman's in Essex Mass. Educated no stupid yes. And when I say stupid I mean stupid fresh. I'm not James at 15 or Chachi in charge. I'm Adam and I'm adamant about living large. With the white sassoons and the looks that kill. Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville. I met a little cutie she was all hopped up on zootie. I liked the little cutie but I kicked her in the bootie. Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around. You be listening to my records' a number one sound. Step to the rhythm step step to the ride. I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside. Tune in tune on to my tune that's live. Ladies flock like fish to my line. She's got a gold tooth you know she's hardcore. She'll show you a good time then she'll show you the door. Break up with your girl it ended in tears. Vincent Van Gogh and mail that ear. I call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinking. The phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinking. She said come on over it was me that she missed. I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed. Your old lady left you and you went girls (x3) insane. You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 train. Take my advice at any price a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak. Sucking down pints till I didn't know. Woke up in the morning at the Won Ton Ho. Cause I announce I like girls that bounce. With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce. Girls with curls and big long locks. And beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks. Walking high and mighty like she's #1 and. *She thinks she's the passionate one*.

You're hearing me and you're like ""oh my god its Sasquatch!"". I'm walkin' on water while you're stepping in shit. So put your sewer boots on before your ass gets lit. And if you don't like then hey fuck you!. So put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself. Sucker MC's it's me they're resenting. In the animal kingdom they call it presenting. With the dipsy doodle the kit and caboodle. The truth is brutal your grandma's kugel. Kings County is my stomping ground. The Albee Square Mall, Brooklyn, Downtown. So don't ask me to wine and dine ya. I'm from Brooklyn you're from Regina. You're like Foghorn Leghorn, Yosemite Sam. You're just yellin' and wildin' wondering who I am. With those lies you're telling you look like Toucan Sam. But my style's impregnable like the Hoover Dam. And if you don't like then hey fuck you!. . Por: Leonardo Henrique - Léo"
high plains drifter,They can't catch me never gonna find me. They're never gonna know that I'm the High Plains Drifter. Pulled over to the river to take a rest. Pulled out a pair of pliers and pulled the bullet out of my chest. Fear and loathing across the country listening to my 8 track. Reached behind the seat and grabbed a Kool from the pack. Long distance from my girl and I'm talking on the cellular. She said that she was sorry and I said yeah the hell you were. Check my rear view mirror check the gold tooth display. Check the odometer and I was on my way. Cause I'm a high plains drifter the best that you can get. A strapped shoplifter a pirate on cassette. Bust a Travis Bickle when I feel that I'm getting pushed. Don't step to me or you're gonna get mushed. Doing 120 plowing over mail boxes. Radar detector to tell me where the cops is. Spend another night at the Motel 6. It's five dollars extra get the porno flicks. Concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter. I'm a kleptomaniac K-Mart shoplifter. Cash flow getting low so I had to pull a job. I found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob. Left the car outside with the engine still revvin'. Time to get busy at 7-Eleven. Went inside to make my withdrawal. I would've took what he had had had I had to take it all. Knucklehead deli tried to gyp me on the price. So I clocked him off the turban with the bag of ice. Mellow like Jell-O cool like lemonade. Made my getaway and I thought that I had it made. I feel like Steve McQueen a former movie star. Look in my rearview mirror seen a police car. Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap. I couldn't help but notice I was caught in a speed trap. Dirty Mary Crazy Larry on the run from Dirty Harry. Stash the cash in the dash but my gun I did carry. I'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night. I got my alibi straight and I pulled over to the right. Cop knocked on my window and said Boy where's the fire. you've got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire. *Outta the car longhair* your goose is cooked. Read me my rights fingerprinted and booked. Makin' like a D.T. driving a Gran Fury. Wherever I hang my hat's my home and my past is kind of blurry. Every dog will have its day and mine will be in front of a jury. I'm the High Plains Drifter and I'm never in a hurry. Read me my rights as if I didn't know this. Threw me in the tank with the drunk called Otis. With his five o' clock shadow he smelled of 3-day old beer. My man turned to me and said why are you here?. I said I'm charming and dashing I'm rental car bashing. Phony paper passing at Nix Check Cashing. Went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn House of D.. He said you behave son or we'll throw away the key. Harry Houdini'd out the cuffs I kicked the screw in the knee. Took the bailiff's wallet and went straight to O.T.B.. I had a good feeling easy come easy go. I bet on one horse to win and your mother to show. And sure enough that nag came in. Brought my ticket to the window and collected my win. Broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger. Hot wired hot wheeled and *Suzy is a headbanger*.
hold it now - hit it!,"Now I chill real ill when I start to chill. When I fill my pocket with another dollar bill. Sipping pints of ale out the window sill. When I get my fill I'm chilly chill. Now I just got home because I'm out all day. What's the time? - it's time to buy ale. Peter eater - parking meter all of the time. If I run out of ale - it's Thunderbird wine. Miller drinking - chicken eating - dress so fly. I got friends in high places that are keeping me high. Dow with Mike D. and it ain't no hassle. Got the ladies of the eighties from here to White Castle. (chorus) Hold it now - hit it!. M.C. - Adam Yauch in the place to be. And all the girls are on me cause I'm down with Mike D.. I'm down with Mike D. and it ain't no baloney. For real, not phony - ""O.E."" and Rice-a-Roni. I come out at night 'cause I sleep all day. And I'm the King Adrock and he's M.C.A.. Well I'm cruising, I'm bruising - I'm never ever losing. I'm in my car - I'm going far and dust is what I'm using. Around the way is where I'm from. And I'm from Manhattan and I'm not a bum. Because you're pud-slapping, ball-flapping - got that juice. My name's Mike D. and I can do that Jerry Lewis. (repeat chorus). Hip-hop, body rockin' - doing the do. Beer drinking, breath stinking, sniffing glue. Belly flipping, always illing, busting caps. My name's Mike D. and I write my own snaps. I'm a peep-show seeking on the forty-deuce. I'm a killer at large and I'm on the loose. Pistol packing, Monkey drinking, no money bum. I come from Brooklyn 'cause that's where I'm from. Cheap-skate, perpetrating - money hungry jerk. Everyday I drink a ""O.E."" and I don't go to work. You drippy nose knuckle-head - you're wet behind the ears. You like men - and we like beer.. (repeat chorus). King of the Ave. with the Def female. You're rhyming and stealin' with the freshest ale. Cooling at the crib watching my TV. Ed Norton - Ted Knight - and Mr. Ed. Pump it up homeboy - just don't stop. Chef Boy-ar-dee cooling on the pot. I take no slack cause I got the knack. And I'm never dusting out cause I torch that crack. The King Adrock - that is my name. And you're drinking Moet - we got the champagne. A quarter dropping - going shopping buying wigs. Surgeon general cut professor - D.J. Thigs. (repeat chorus)."

i don't know,What's pleasing to the eye. In the delusion of my sight. Is not what I find when I reach into the light. I have lost my mind. I'm walking through time. Deluded as the next guy. Pretending and hoping to find. That distant peace of mind. I don't know. Who does know. There is no. Where to go. It's not so simple as I try to wish. But then again what is?. There is no other worthy quest. So on I go.
i want some,I give to this world 'till I've got nothing to give to. I give thanks to this world for the life that I've lived through. Stress gets in the way of the shit that we're doing. We'll bum rush the door if you don't let the whole crew in. . I want some. . Give me the chance and I will show you what I'm feeling. My mind's caught up in the Shit the man's dealing. looking Ahead the next level we're gonna take it to. I guess I should be happy it's a day that we made it through. . I want some.
in a world gone mad,"[CHORUS]. In a world gone mad it's hard to think right. So much violence hate and spite. Murder going on all day and night. Due time we fight the non-violent fight. Mirrors, smokescreens and lies. It's not the politicians but their actions I despise. You and Saddam should kick it like back in the day. With the cocaine and Courvoisier. But you build more bombs as you get more bold. As your mid-life crisis war unfolds. All you want to do is take control. Now put that axis of evil bullshit on hold. Citizen rule number 2080. Politicians are shady. So people watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack. I don't doubt it look at how they act. [CHORUS]. In a world gone mad it's hard to think right. So much violence hate and spite. Murder going on all day and night. Due time we fight the non-violent fight. First the 'War On Terror' now war on Iraq. We're reaching a point where we can't turn back. Let's lose the guns and let's lose the bombs. And stop the corporate contributions that their built upon. Well I'll be sleeping on your speeches 'til I start to snore. 'Cause I won't carry guns for an oil war. As-Salamu alaikum, wa alaikum assalam. Peace to the Middle East peace to Islam. Now don't get us wrong 'cause we love America. But that's no reason to get hysterica. They're layin' on the syrup thick. We ain't waffles we ain't havin' it. [CHORUS]. In a world gone mad it's hard to think right. So much violence hate and spite. Murder going on all day and night. Due time we fight the non-violent fight. Now how many people must get killed?. For oil families pockets to get filled?. How many oil families get killed?. Not a damn one so what's the deal?. It's time to lead the way and de-escalate. Lose the weapons of mass destruction and the hate. Say ooh ah what's the White House doin'?. Oh no! Say, what in tarnation have they got brewing?!. Well I'm not pro Bush and I'm not pro Saddam. We need these fools to remain calm. George Bush you're looking like Zoolander. Trying to play tough for the camera. What am I on crazy pills? We've got to stop it. Get your hand out my grandma's pocket. We need health care more than going to war. You think it's democracy they're fighting for?. [CHORUS]. In a world gone mad it's hard to think right. So much violence hate and spite. Murder going on all day and night."

intergalactic,Intergalactic Planetary Planetary Intergalactic Another Dimension. Don't you tell me to smile. You stick around I'll make it worth your while. Got numbers beyond what you can dial. Maybe it's because I'm so versatile. Style profile I said. It always brings me back when I hear Ooh Child. From the Hudson River out to the Nile. I run the marathon 'til the very last mile. If you battle me I will revile. People always say my style is wild. You've got gall you've got guile. To step to me I'm a rapophile. If you want to battle you're in denial. Coming from Uranus to check my style. Go ahead put my rhymes on trial. Cast you off into exile. Intergalactic planetary. Planetary intergalactic. Jazz and Awol that's our team. Step inside the party disrupt the whole scene. When it comes to beats well I'm a fiend. I like my sugar with coffee and cream. Got to keep it going keep it going full steam. Too sweet to be sour too nice to be mean. On the tough guy style I'm not too keen. To try to change the world I will plot and scheme. Mario C likes to keep it clean. Gonna shine like a sunbeam. Keep on rapping cause that's my dream. Got an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes. When it comes to envy y'all is green. Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine. Another dimension new galaxy.

Beastie Boys known to let the beat drop. When I wrote graffiti my name was Slop. If my rap's soup my beats is stock. Step from the tables as I start to chop. I'm a lumber jack Dj Adrock.

it takes time to build,"If you don't like the news then press eject. Baby Davis getting older can't take a rain check. It's time to let'em know what we expect. Stop building SUV's strung out on OPEC. Hold up wait up you know we come correct. You wanna change things up, well hey just get set. It's easier to sit back than stick out your neck. It's easier to break things than build it correct. We've got a president we didn't elect. The Kyoto treaty he decided to neglect. And still the US just wants to flex. Keep doin' that wop we gonna break our necks. It takes a second to wreck it. It takes time to build. You gots to chill. Hate filled people wanna keep us in check. Tearin' down each other is what they expect. If you want love well hey that's a bet. We've got to give before we can get. Waiting like a batter who is on deck. When it's time to wreck shop then shop I'll wreck. So let's calibrate and check our specs. We need a little shift on over towards the left. I don't really know but I suspect. I think it's due time that we inspect. How they get their information and their facts are checked. Another press conference someone's talking out their neck. It takes a second to wreck it. It takes time to build. You gots to chill. So step up to the window and place your bets. Is the US gonna keep breaking necks. Maybe it's time that we impeach Tex. And the military muscle that he wants to flex. By the time Bush is done what will be left. Selling votes like E-pills at the discotheque. Environmental destruction and the national dept. But plenty of dollars left in the fat war chest. What the real deal why you can't connect. Why you hating people that you never met. Didn't your mama teach you to show some respect?. Why not open your mind for a sec?. It takes a second to wreck it. It takes time to build. You gots to chill"

johnny ryall,Johnny Ryall is the bum on my stoop. I gave him fifty cents to buy some soup. He knows the time with the fresh Gucci watch. He's even more over than the mayor Ed Koch. Washing windows on the Bowery at a quarter to four. 'Cause he ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more. Living on borrowed time and borrowed money. Sleepin' on the street there ain't a damn thing funny. Hand me down food and hand me down clothes. A rockabilly past of which nobody knows. Makes his home all over the place. He goes to sleep by falling down on his face. Sometimes known as the leader of the homeless. Sometimes drunk and he's always phoneless. Sleepin' on the street in a cardboard box. He's better off drinkin' than smokin' the rocks. Johnny Ryall. He drinks where he lies. He's covered with flies. He's got the hand me down Pumas and the tie dyes. Go upstate and get your head together. Thunderbird is the word and you're light as a feather. Detox at the flop house no booze allowed. Remember the good old days with the rockabilly crowd. Memphis is where he's from. He lives in the street but he's no bum. A rockabilly star from the days of old. He used to have teeth all filled with gold. A platinum voice but only gold records. On the bass was boots on the drums was checkers. Luis Vuitton with the Gucci guitar. Johnny Ryall. *Who do you think you are*. Johnny Ryall. Donald Trump Donald Tramp living in the Men's Shelter. Wonder Bread bag shoes and singing Helter Skelter. He asks for a dollar you know what it's for. Bottle after bottle he'll always need more. He's no less important than you working class stiffs. Drinks a lot of liquor but he don't drink piss. Paid his dues playing the blues. He claims that he wrote the Blue Suede Shoes. Elvis shaved his head when he went into the army. *That's right y'all his name is*. Johnny. Johnny Ryall.
just a test,"Like a flag at half mast as frames click fast. Not a thing will last as past is past. Like stacks of thoughts that got played and worn. Used over and over till they were tired and torn. Like a broken clock that can't tell time. Like a thick ass book that's filled with wack rhymes. Like a scorching blaze that burned the sand. Like a band that planned and planned and planned. And flew down like a raven in the dark of night. And snatched up the worm helpless to fight. And brought it back to the nest singing microphone check. One two one two this is just a test. Like sand in one hand You can't hold for long. Like scheming on a plan that goes all wrong. Like fudge and caramel they're not the same. And it's a shame all you talk is game. You act like a diamond waiting to be set. In a gold ring, as if, I bet. As time goes by in this give and take. As long as I learn I will make mistakes. What do I want? What do I need?. Why do I want it? What's in it for me?. It's the imagery of technology. Is what you get is what you see. Don't worry your mind. When you give it your best. One two one two this is just a test."

""Wasn't we here back on Raising Hell?"". Running wild like rats in the Taco Bell. On the mic I spit, the match it's lit. Mike Dino, the Jewish Brad Pitt. Making music for librarians to burly jocks.

looking down the barrel of a gun,Rolling down the hill snowballing getting bigger. An explosion in the chamber the hammer from the trigger. I seen him get stabbed I watched the blood spill out. He had more cuts than my man Chuck Chillout. 24 is my age 22 is my gauge. Writing rhymes on a page going off in a rage. Out on a mission a stolen car mission. Had a little problem with the transmission. 3 on the tree in the middle of the night. I have this steak on my head cause I got into a fist fight. Life comes in phases take the good with the bad. You bought those coins on the street and you got had. It's all high spirit you know you gotta hear it. Don't touch the mic baby don't come near it. It's gonna get you it's gonna get you. It's gonna get you girl it's gonna get you. Looking down the barrel of a gun. Son of a gun son of a bitch. Getting paid getting rich. Ultra violence running through my head. Fuzzy navel y'all making me see red. Rapid fire Louie like Rambo got bullets. I'm a gonna die harder like my kid Bruce Willis Drummond. I love girlies waxing and milking. Got more excuses than my man Dave Scilkin. Predetermined destiny is who I am. You got your finger on the trigger like the Son of Sam I am. Like Clockwork Orange going off on the town. I've got posse bonanza to beat your ass down. I'm mad at my desk and I'm writing all curse words. Expressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words. You're a headless chicken chasin' a sucker free basin. Looking for a fist to put your face in. Get hip don't slip knuckle heads. Racism is schism on the serious tip.

Make some noise if you're with me. Make some noise if you're with me. Pass me the scalple I'll make an incision. I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching. Put it in formaldehyde and put it in the shelf. And you can show it to your friends and say that's my old self. Can do me nothing, can't tell me nada. Don't quote me now because I'm doing the lambada. The forbidden dance here's my chance. To make romance in my b-boy stance. Parler romancing into the financing. Opened up a restaurant with ted danson. The roaches check in but they never check out. I set the record straight no doubt. We got a. We got a party on the left a party on the right. We gonna party for the muther fucking right to fight. Make some noise if you're with me. Make some noise if you're with me (a party on the left, a party on the right). Make some noise if you're with me (party for the muther fucking right to fight). Make some noise if you're with me"

namaste,A butterfly floats on the breeze of a sun lit day. As I feel this reality gently fade away. Riding on a thought to see where it's from. Gliding through a memory of a time yet to come. Smoke paints the air. Swirling images through my mind. Like a whirlpool spin beginning to unwind. And I stand at the edge cautiously awaiting. As time slips by. Carefully navigating by the stars in the sky. And I sit. And I think to myself. And on the horizon the sun light begins to climb. And it seems like it's been so long since he shined. But I'm sure it was only yesterday. . A cold chill of fear cut through me. I felt my heart contract. To my mind I brought the image of light. And I expanded out of it. My fear was just a shadow. And then I voice spoke in my head. And she said dark is not the opposite of light. It's the absence of light. And I thought to myself. She knows what she's talking about. And for a moment I know. What it was all about..

Always in a rush to hit that switch. . Nervous Assistant. . You wanna something you wanna something. You wanna something - my dick. Running around nothing found moving too damn quick. You know where to find me anytime. I can't take it I've lost my mind. Proud to say no I'm not son. I I I I got one. . Nervous Assistant. Too much action right by me. Like Buddy Rich try me. Need a brain that's stress resistant. Or else I'll be .... the Nervous Assistant.

no sleep 'till brooklyn,"(chorus) No sleep 'til - Brooklyn. . Foot on the pedal - never ever false metal. Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle. My job's ain't a job - it's a damn good time. City to city - I'm running my rhymes. On location - touring around the nation. Beastie Boys always on vacation. Itchy trigger finger but a stable turntable. I do what I do best because I'm illing and able. Ain't no faking - your money I'm taking. Going coast to coast - watching all the girlies shaking. While you're at the job working nine to five. The Beastie Boys at the Garden - cold kickin' it live. . (bridge) No sleep 'til -. . Another place - another train. Another bottle in the brain. Another girl - another fight. Another drive all night. Our manager's crazy - he always smokes dust. He's got his own room at the back of the bus. Tour around the world - you rock around the clock. Plane to hotel - girls on the jock. We're thrashing hotels like it's going out of style. Getting paid along the way cause it's worth your while. Four on the floor - Adrock's out the door. M.C.A.'s in the back because he's skeezin' with a whore. We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack. With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back. . (repeat bridge). . (repeat chorus). . Ain't seen the light since we started this band. M.C.A. - get on the mic my man. Born and bred Brooklyn - U.S.A.. They all me Adam Yauch - but I'm M.C.A.. Like a lemon to a lime - a lime to a lemon. I sip the def ale with all the fly women. Got limos, arena, TV shows. Autograph pictures and classy hos. Step off homes - get out of my way. Taxing little girlies form here to L.A.. Waking up before I get to sleep. Cause I'll be rocking this party eight days a week. . (repeat chorus)."

I told them I liked ribbons and pink's my. favorite color and all they had to say was. this: Thank you for time we will call you in a. week or so, but only if you have done good. So I waited patiently for five days. and then I got a little mad but I. did not care that much. A few days later the phone rang. ""Your in my movie"" said the guy.. ""Yes I said, ""I love you lots I hope. you do the same to me"". So I went on and filmed the movie. and became very famous"

paul revere,"Here's a little story I gots to tell,. about three bad brothers you know so well.. It started way back in history with Adrock, MCA and me, Mike D.. I been had a little horsey named Paul Revere.. Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer.. Ridin' cross the land, kickin' up sand.. Sheriff Posse is on my tail cuz I'm in demand.. One lonely Beastie I be,. all by myself without nobody.. The sun is beatin' down on my baseball hat.. The air is gettin' hot, the beer is gettin' flat.. Lookin' for a girl, I ran into a guy.. His name is MCA, I said ""howdy"", he said ""hi."". He told a little story that sounded well rehearsed.. Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst.. The brew was in my hand, and he was on my tip.. His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip.. He said ""Can I get some?"". I said ""You can't get none."". I had a chance to run,. but he pulled out his shotgun.. Quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead.. He put the gun to my head and this is what he said:. ""My name is MCA, I got a license to kill.. I think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill.. So what do we have here?. And outlaw and his beer.. I run this land, you understand, I've made myself clear."". We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin.. As if this story's over, but it's ready to begin.. ""I've got the gun, you've got the brew.. You've got two choices of what you can do.. It's not a tough descision as you can see.. I can blow you away or you can ride with me."". I said, ""I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border.. The Sheriff is after me for what I did to his daughter.. I did it like this, I did it like that.. I did it with the whiffle ball bat.. So I'm on the run, the cop's got my gun.. Right about now it's time to have some fun.. The King Adrock, that is my name,. and I know the fly spot where they got the champagne."". We rode for six hours then we hit the spot.. The beat was-a-bumpin' and the girlies was hot.. This dude was starin' like he knows who we are,. so we took the empty spot next to him at the bar.. MCA said ""Yo, you know this kid?"". I said I didn't but I know he did.. The kid said, ""Get ready, cuz this ain't funny.. My name is Mike D and I'm about to get money."". He pulled out the jammey, aimed it at the sky.. He yelled, ""Stick 'em up!"" And let two fly.. Hands went up and people hit the floor.. He wasted two kids that ran for the door.. ""I'm Mike D and I get respect.. Your cash and your jewelery is what I expect."". MCA what with it, and he's my ace,. so I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face.. The piano player's out, the music stopped.. This boy had beef, and he got dropped.. Mike D grabbed the money, MCA snatched the gold.. I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold.."
picture this,Something on the windowsill. Caught her eye and held her still. The cars pass by outside. Nowhere left to hide. Picture this now crystal clear. Nothing left to hold her here. And creeping up meanwhile. Traces of a smile. Eyes open wide to see if I could fly.
posse in effect,"Yes, yes, y'all - you don't stop. You keep it on - and shockin' the place. Well I'm M.C.A. - I got nothing to prove. Pay attention - my intention is to bust a move. I drink quarts and cans and bottles and sixes. Between the turntables keep the vodka and the mixes. I'm Mike D. - I got the deuces wild. A list of girlies numbers that I've dialed. I do the Smurf, the Popeye, and the Jerry Lewis. I like Bullwinkle but I don't like Moose. I'm schoolin' in the boys' room - coolin' by the locker. All the girls in class know that I'm the cool rocker. Punk in the hall - man I should of oughtta hit him. Had the fresh rhymes and the kid cold bite 'em. Smokin' in the boys room is what I do best. While you were at a party - your girlfriend fessed. I keep a pistol in my pocket so you better be cautious. Fly around the world - but it makes me nauseous. Mike D.'s day off everyday of the week. I got to the party - and I did the freak. I got a girl in the Castle and one in the pagoda. You know I got rhymes like Abe Vigoda. I'm a Def Manhattan killer - a rhyme driller. A mike in my hand and a mouth full of Miller. I got a hat not a visor - I drink Budweiser. The turntables - up on the drum riser. The needle's in the groove and the vinyl's on the platter. I know that I'm fly man there's no need to flatter. I travel around the globe - it's keeping girlies dizzy. My name's Mike D. - now watch me get busy y'all. You're a fake wearin' sucker whose gold got rusted. 4Cheaper than a hot do with no mustard. You tried to steal my fresh and you got cold busted. Because your crew's all soft and I'm disgusted. I'm from downtown the city of Manhattan. I got a lotta girlies and not one's cattin'. My posse's in effect and we're doin' the do. And we got more rhymes than your damn crew. Caught you poppin' that weak and you must of been dusted. Stuck you head in the toilet and stone cold flushed it. Word.."
professor booty,"Well, I got more bounce to the fuckin' bump. And then you want to know. Why it's cause I'm motherfuckin' truckin'. I'm in the pocket just like Grady Tate. I got supplies of beats so you don't have to wait. 'Cause I'm the master blaster. Drinking up the shasta. My voice sounds sweet 'cause it has to. So light a match to my ass 'cause I'm blown up. I'd like to thank the people for just showin' up. But now I want y'all to move it. Put your point on the floor and just prove it. And I'm smurfin not rehearsin' gettin' live y'all. A little puffy so you know what I'm doin' right. 'Cause that's the kind of frame of mind I'm in. I got a feelin' that's back again. So don't touch me 'cause I'm electric. And if you touch me you'll get shocked!. . You've got the boomin' system. But it's blasting out doo-doo. You think it's chocolate milk. But it's watered down yoo-hoo. I've been through many times. In which I thought I might lose it. The only thing that saved me. Has always been music. We've got our own studio the son of the G. It's no question life's been good to me. 'Cause life ain't nothing but a good groove. A good mix tape to put you in the right mood. This one goes out to my man the Groove Merchant. Coming through with beats. For which I've been searching. Like two sealed copies of expansions. I'm like Tom Vu with yachts and mansions. The logo I sport is the face of the monkey. Union made Ben Davis quality it's no junk see. My chrome is shining just like an icicle. I ride around town on my low-rider bicycle.. . So many wack M.C.'s. You get the T.V. bozack. Ain't even gonna call out your names. 'Cause you're so wack. But one big oaf whose faker than plastic. A dictionary definition of the word spastic. You should have never started something. That you couldn't finish. 'Cause writin' rhymes to me. Is like Popeye to spinach. I'm bad ass move your fat ass. 'Cause you're wack son. Dancin' around like you think you're Janet Jackson. Thought you could walk on me. To get some ground to walk on. I'll put the rug out under your ass. As I talk on. I'll take you out like a sniper on a roof. Like an M.C. at the fever in the D.J. booth. With your headphones strapped. You're rockin' rewind pause. Tryin' to figure out what you can do to go for yours. But liek the pencil to the paper I got more to come. One after another you can all get some. So you getter take your time. And meditate on your rhyme. 'Cause your shit'll be stinking. When I go for mine. And that's right y'all don't get uptight y'all. You can't say shit. Because you're biting what I write y'all. And that's wrong y'all over the long haul. You can't cut the mustard. When you're fronting it all"
putting shame in your game,"Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot. Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got. We keep the party movin to the broad day light. g.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright. Transhypnotic robotic can't stop it. No limits to this style you know you can't lock it. First you mock it, rock it and then you stock it. But I've got the styles that are always in the pocket. Like a bird floating down on a New York breeze. Every thought in the mind is a planted seed. So watch the mind or the thoughts will stack. Before you know it they're boomeranging on back. I'm the king of boogle there is none higher. I get 11 points off the word quagmire. Fools can't see me and that's how it is. And that's how I like it cause that's my biz. Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot. Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got. We keep the party movin to the broad day light. g.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright. Time's an illusion as the moments race by. Too fast to really grasp though we may try. Deny, till we die, ooh my my. These thoughts that mislead and then multiply. Second by second and minute by minute. It's like lotto you gotta be in it to win it. Shakin mind breakin on their own demise. Lies tax to the max and they'll be feelin those vibes. So tell me what you need that you have got. Fiending on power will make your blood clot. It starts with the greed and then goes all wrong. That's why we can't all just get along. We're all connected like a Leggo set. One equaling one together like a croquette. Whether we have or have not yet met. It ain't no thing and it ain't no sweat. Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot. Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got. We keep the party movin to the broad day light. g.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright. You're caught in a panic and it's rattled your brain. The selfish ways just can't maintain. But these are the breaks when you try and come fake. Don't come with the rhymes that you just half baked. I'm the Benihana chef on the SP12. I chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf. You be like hello nasty where you been. It's time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon. I jumped outside the house with my Walkman on. I get so hyped when I hear this song. It's gonna keep me happy like all day long. So go and talk shit cause it just makes me strong. Don't grease my palm with your filthy cash. Multinationals spreading like a rash. I might stick around or I might be a fad. But I won't sell my songs for no TV ad. Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot. Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got. We keep the party movin to the broad day light. g.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright."
railroad blues,"""All Aboard, Track 17, All Aboard'"". YEEEHAAW. Now this song is dedicated,. To all the hard workin' pioneers of this country. Setting out discovering the West. Bringin' a railroad to where no man has ever been before.. Johnny he worked on a railroad. A poundin' on iron and steel. Workin' his way out West now. The only sure things his next meal. America was young. But she was a growin'. Layin' tracks across the prairie. Not knowing where they're going. His mother didn't wanna' leave him. But now he's in the West. She said please don't go. But he said if I don't I'll never rest. It wasn't always easy. Some of the boys died. Johnny wrote her letters. But received no replies. Johnny he worked on a railroad. A poundin' on iron and steel. Workin' his way out West now. The only sure things his next meal. Johhny reached San Francisco. Tired and broke without a dime. Started panning for gold. Just a hopin' he would find. The gold wasn't a rushin'. But Johnny kept on minin'. Trying to send his mama something. With the letters he was signing. Then one day Johnny finally got a reply. When he opened mama's letter. He began to cry. She's a writin' from her deathbed. And this is what she said. Please don't be mad at me son,. 'Ccause tomorrow I'll be dead. Johnny he worked on a railroad. A poundin' on iron and steel. Workin' his way out West now. The only sure things his next meal"
remote control,"Things get hectic quick. From the satellite dish to your joy stick. It's the night of the living cable box. Wires coming up from around the block. Remote control to change the station. But that won't change your situation. Have you seen what I mean. I'm the little gnome that's in your dreams. So I say this rhyme built by design. To take you beyond space and time. Said who is the man making diamonds out of coal. The man pushing buttons on remote control. Until your back's up against the wall. You never know yourself that much at all. So you've got to share your love with a friend. That's all that you've got left in the end. Living in this city of pure confusion. People mislead by their own illusion. All this action, no satisfaction. We're all linked together like a chain reaction. Play or fold, love is bold. What is the future that will unfold?. Some like it hot, others like it cold. But we all want to hold the remote control. Things get hectic quick. All of the sudden I'm in the thick. Too much drama all around. Distractions booming in sensuround. Like a rainy day's Earth won't sit still. Sliding on down a hill. Sometimes life seems to stall. So never be ungrateful y'all. So I got a little something for your pay per view. Like Don King I've got the crazy hair do. We've got cameras on Mars on space patrol. Controlled on Earth by remote control."
resolution time,"Actin' like the last generation on earth. You're gonna fuck up a place for new birth. You're cutting the last of the forests on the planet. Only a few hundred years since Columbus landed. Well it's due time that we look and pay attention. As the windows who knows show the knowledge with us. 'Cause it's the one that we prayed for, from on the earth. I give the wisdom to folks, you know whole worth. In these great times we still neglect. When they invent this land, don't give the due respect. 'Cause the FBI and the CIA. The whole federal government, the FDA. Well, the system doesn't work and it must be changed. And there's more people in the pen everyday. So I visualize resolution. Yo, everyday is in a state of evolution. Evolution time. Evolution time. Revolution time. Revolution time. Revelation time. Revelation time. Resolution time. Resolution. We come a long way with the peace in the East. But on the home front, they're wild in the streets. As it gets got hear a changing in same. And this is the Millennium still felt today. I hear the same stories time after time. The stories of fear, through violent crimes. Committed by hatred by satient beings. Who shall loose by kindness and it's plain to see. Now we don't have to stand for this oppression any longer. If we stand together, there's nothing stronger. We must interconnect it as though we sure have won. If we want to avoid planetary destruction. So I work and I work because the hate in my mind. Has assumed the truth and I know I'll find. And I visualize resolution. See it all as a state of constant evolution. Evolution time. Evolution time. Revolution time. Revolution time. Revelation time. Revelation time. Resolution time. Resolution. The world leaders were terrified of loosing their pride. Their spoiled children tellin' little wack lies. Vanishing numbers of unimaginable destruction. Sure as we boast they're at their last production. Threatening and challenging nature against nation. Walkin' down the road of total annihilation. Sprouting threats is insecure. Guns are for the fighting and they're immature. And it all stems from self-important police. Thinking that we're better than our fellow human beings. So I wanna empower the limit I can. And pass it along so we can do pass the pan. Some times I sit and I watch my mind. Watchin' my thoughts as they reel and wind. And stop and visualize resolution. For everyday is in a state of evolution. Evolution time. Evolution time. Revolution time. Revolution time. Revelation time. Revelation time. Resolution time. Resolution"

shadrach,Riddle me this brother can you handle it. Your style to my style you can't hold a candle to it. Equinox symmetry and the balance is right. Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night. It's not how you play the game it's how you win it. I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic. For those about to rock we salute you. The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to. I once was lost but now I'm found. The music washes over and you're one with the sound. Who shall inherit the earth the meek shall. I think I'm starting to peak now Al. From S.S. Decontrol and the man upstairs I hope that he cares. If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire. We're just 3 M.C.'s and we're on the go. SHADRACH MESACH ABEDNAGO. Only 24 hours in a day. Only 12 notes a man can play. Music for all and not just one people. And now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel. More Adidas sneakers that a plumber got pliers. Got more suites that Jacoby & Meyers. If not for my vices my bugged out desires. My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires. So I'm out pickin' pockets at the Atlantic Antic. And nobody wants to hear you cause your rhymes are so frantic. I mix business with pleasure way too much. I mean wine and women and song and such. I don't get blue I gotta mean red streak. You don't pay the band your friends and that's weak. Get even like Steven like pulling a Rambo. SHADRACH MESACH ABEDNAGO. Steal from the rich and I'm out robbing banks. Give to the poor and I always give thanks. Got more stories that J.D. Salinger. I hold the title and you are the challenger. I've got money like Charles Dickens. Got the girlies in the Couple like the Colonel's got the chickens. Always go out dapper like Harry S. Truman. I'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Newman. *Never gonna let them say that I don't love you*. My noggin is hoggin all kinds of thoughts. Adam Yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin of course. Smoke the holy chalice got my own religion. Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians. Jerry Lee Swaggert or Jerry Lee Falwell. You love Mario Andretti cause he always drives his car well. Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born. And we love the hot butter on what the popcorn. Sippin on wine and mackin. Rockin on the stage with all the hands clappin. Ride the wave of fate it don't ride me. *Being very proud to be an M.C.*. And the man upstairs I hope that he cares. If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire. Amps and crossovers under my rear hood. The bass is bumpin from the back of my Fleetwood Brougham D'Elegance. They tell us what to do hell no. SHADRACH MESACH ABEDNAGO.
shake your rump,"Now Randy listen I rock a house party at the drop of a hat. I beat a biter down with an aluminum bat. a lot of people they be Jonesin' just to hear me rock the mic. they'll be staring at the radio staying up all night. so like a pimp I'm pimpin'. I got a boat to eat shrimp in. Nothing wrong with my leg just B-boy limpin'. Got arrested at the Mardi Gras for jumping on a float. My man MCA's got a beard like a billy goat. oowah oowah is my disco call. MCA hu-huh I'm gettin' rope y'all. Routines I bust rhymes I write. And I'll be busting routines and rhymes all night. Like eating burgers or chicken or you'll be picking your nose. I'm on time, homie, that's how it goes. You heard my style I think you missed the point. It's the joint. Mike D with your bad self running things. Yeah. What's that with your bad breath onion rings. I'm Mike D and I'm back from the dead. Chillin' at the beaches down at Club Med. Make another record 'cause the people they want more of this. Suckers they be saying they can take out Adam Horovitz. Hurricane you got clout. Other DJ's he'll take your head out. A puppet on a string I'm paid to sing or rhyme. Or do my thing I'm. In a lava lamp inside the brain hotel. I might be peakin' or freakin' I rock well. The Patty Duke the wrench and then I bust the tango. Got more rhymes than Jamaicans got Lingo. I got the peg leg at the end of my stump. Shake your rump. Never been dumped 'cause I'm the most mackinest. Never been jumped 'cause I'm known the most packinest. Yeah we've got beef chief. We're knocking out teeth chief. And if you don't believe us you should question your belief Keith. Like Sam the butcher bringing Alice the meat. Like Fred Flintstone driving around with bald feet. Should I have another sip no skip it. In the back of the ride and bust with the whippet. Rope a dope dookies all around the neck. *Whoo ha got them all in check*. Running from the law the press and the parents. *Is your name Michael Diamond?*. No mine's Clarence. From downtown Manhattan the village. My style was wild and you know that it still is. Disco bag schlepping and you're doing the bump. Shake your rump."

You be like ""oh yeah Adam, real mature"". I'd like a lettuce, tomato and Munster on rye. All this cheese is gonna make me cry. Gorgonzola, Provolone. Don't even get me started on this microphone. Blowin' up like my name is Joe Bazooka. I'm a super-dooper MC party pooper. On a track so slick it'll make you feel all queasy. Make you do like Fred Sanford with ""I'm comin' Wheezy!"". Everybody get down huh. Everybody get down huh. Everybody get down huh. Huh huh huh huh, Shazam!. On the court I go by the name Praying Mantis. Got the edge and I've got the advantage. If you could see things from my vantage. Point then you could better understand this. I'm in the lab all day I scrabble all night. I got a bedazzler so my outfit's tight. When it comes to panache I can't be beat. I got the most style from below 14th street. Internationally known as the Keebler Elf. Can't keep a catalog up on the shelf. I splash on beats like sauce on spaghetti. Putting MC's out of business like they're Crazy Eddie. Everybody get down huh. Everybody get down huh. Everybody get down huh. Huh huh huh huh, Shazam!. I know you're sitting pretty in the Hampty Hamps. Posing like you're rolling with that camp. In layman's terms let me break it down. You're flipping and flopping just like a flounder. I'm a hip hop scholar while you're left back. So Jeckle and Rush go back to Lefrac. I'm a simple man like Chance Gardner. Working 9 to 5 Dolly Parton. Got rhymes for jerks that's bringing on drama. Which rhyme you want first? The one about your mama?. Goodness gracious golly gee. Shazam! Freeeeeeak out with the genie!. Everybody get down huh. Everybody get down huh. Everybody get down huh. Huh huh huh huh, Shazam!. Freak out with the genie...."
she's crafty,"Well this girl came up to me - she says she's new in town. But the crew been said they seen her around. I thought they were right but I didn't wanna know. The girlie was Def and she wanted to go. I think her name is Lucy but they all call Loose. I think I thought I seen her on eighth and forty-deuce. The next think she said, ""My place or yours?. Let's kick some bass behind closed doors!"". We got into the cab - the cab driver said. He recognized my girlie from the back of her head. He said a little something about tip to base. So I made him stop the cab to get out of the place. I shouldn't have looked back man I'll always regret it. Something's going on and I'll probably never get it. She was crying like a baby - stupid dumb. It's just too bad that girl's a bum. . (chorus) She's crafty - she's gets around. She's crafty - she's always down. She's crafty - she's got a gripe. She's crafty - and she's just my type. She's crafty. . I spent my last dollar to by a Sabrett. When I seen this girl I could never forget. Now I like nothing better than a pretty girl smile. And I haven't seen a smile that pretty in a while. The girl came up to me she said she loved the show. Asked her to come home and she couldn't say, ""No!"". We got the crib - there's Adam and D.. We didn't say a word - they just stared at me. I said, ""I don't know her just met her tonight."". And Adrock started hiding everything in sight. D. pulled me over said, ""Hid your gold,. The girl is crafty like ice is cold!"". The girl is crafty - she knows all the moves. I started playing records - she knew all the grooves. He thought she was a thief - and D. was right. But I just figured she'd spend the night. When I woke up late in the afternoon. She had taken all the things from inside his room. I found myself sleeping in the middle of the floor. She had taken the bed and the chest of drawers. The mirror, the TV, the guitar cord. My remote control and my old skateboard. She robbed us blind - she took all we owned. And the boys blamed me for bringing her home. . (repeat chorus)."
she's on it,There's no confusion in her conclusion. She wants to waste my time and that's no delusion. Her final decision is perfection and precision. She's grade A class number one in her division. 'Cause she's on it. And she's on it. She acts like a nag I don't know how it started. Even when I'm chillin' she acts retarded. It's gets annoying so high on the tip. If a pirate had a Def Jam shirt she'd be hard on his ship. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. Cold chillin' in the spot and she won't stop. She'll do what's best just to reach the top. She studies real hard all night she'll cram. In school she majors in advanced Def Jam. 'Cause she's on it. And she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cuase she's on it. She's cold in the winter and cool like ice. Sometimes she gets loose sometimes she gets nice. Hear heart starts beatin' her hands get clammy. 'Cause she used to be stucked up now she's on my jammy. 'Cause she's on it. And she's on it. Her bedroom eyes they start to twitch. But she won't front 'cause she's got that itch. She'd drop to her knees if I'd only say please. Instead of counting sheep cold counting Beasties. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. And she's on it

slow and low,"(chorus) Let it flow - let yourself go. Slow and low - that is the tempo. . It's never old school - all brand new. So everybody catch - the bugaloo flu. Not like a fever - not like a cold. The beats are clear - the rhymes are bold. So don't see a doctor or see a nurse. Just listen to the music - first things first. First of all - get off the wall. It's time to party so have a ball. Because we slowed it on down - so get the hell up. Like a volcano I'll erupt. We got determination - bass and highs. White Castle fries only come in one size. What you see is what you get. And you ain't seen - nothing yet. . (repeat chorus). . I do not sing - but I make a Def song. You could live your whole life - and I hope you live long. On the Gong Show we won't get gonged. We're the Beastie Boys - not Cheech and Chong. Strong as an ox - fresh out the box. The crowd is so live - they're coming in flocks. And when we go on - the crowd goes off. It's all hard rock - there's nothing soft. (repeat chorus). We don't only rock the house but we'll house we rock. We don't stroll but we roll straight to the top. M.C.A., Adrock, Mike D. makes three. And we can do it like this in the place to be. When I'm recorded - you'll be rewarded. I know my song is Def 'cause you all applauded. Not P.C.P. or L.S.D. - just me Mike D. in the place to be. This is not free - you must pay a fee. Cash on delivery like a C.O.D.. (repeat chorus). The beat is slow in order to dance. I wanna hear I dos and no I can't. First you move your legs - and then your arms. It's not fast and nervous - this dance is calm. It's truly stable and you ought to be able. To dance to the record when it's on the turntable. (repeat chorus)."
slow ride,"They got a committee to get me off the block. 'Cause I say my rhymes loud and I say 'em nonstop. Because being bad news is what we're all about. We went to White Castle and we got thrown out. I got my boy Mike D. - I got the King Adrock I got the jammy with the ammo inside my sock. I shot homeboy but the bullet was a dud. So I reached in the Miller cooler - grabbed a cool Bud. Slow riding, gun hidin' on the go. I'm fly like an eagle and I drink Old Crow. I'm the king of the classroom - coolin' in the back. My teacher had beef so I gave her a smack. She chased me out of class 0 she was strapped with a ruler. Went to the bathroom - rolled myself a wooler. With bottle in hand at the microphone stand. A. yo homeboy - what you drinkin' man. . I got money - I got juice. I got to the party and I got loose. I got rhythm - I got rhymes. I got the girlies with the Def behinds. I got ill - I got busted. I got dust and I got dusted. I got gold - I got funky. I got the new dance - they call the Brass Monkey. . Because I'm hard hittin' - always biten - cool as hell. I got trees on my mirror so my car won't smell. Sittin' around the house - gettin' high and watchin' tube. Eating Colonel's chicken - drinkin' Heineken brew. I'm a gangster, I'm a prankster - I'm the king of the Ave.. I'm hated, confrontated for the juice that I have. All the fly ladies are making a fuss. But I can't pay attention - 'cause I'm on that dust."

But the sweat is getting wet around the ring around your collar. But like a dream i'm flowing without no stopping. Sweeter than a cherry pie with ready whip topping. Goin' from mic to mic kickin' it wall to wall. Well i'll be calling out you people like a casting call. Ah well it's wack when you're jacked in the back of a ride. With your know with your flow when you're out getting by. Believe me what you see is what you get. And you see me i'm coming off as you can bet. Well i think i'm losing my mind this time. This time i'm losing my mind that's right. I said i think i'm losing my mind this time. This time i'm losing my mind. ""yeah you can't front on that"". But little do you know about something that i talk. About i'm tired of driving it's due time that i walk haa. About but in the meantime, i'm wise to the demise. I've got eyes in the back of my head so i realize. Ah well i'm dr. Spock i'm here to rock y'all. I want you off the wall if you're playing the wall. I said what'cha what'cha what'cha want what'cha want. I said what'cha what'cha what'cha want what'cha want. Y'all suckers write me checks and then they bounce. So i reach into my pocket for the fresh amount. See i'm the long leaner victor the cleaner. I'm the illest motherfucker from here to gardena. Well i'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce. You've got the rhyme and reason but got no cause. But if you're hot to trot you think you're slicker than grease. I've got news for you crews you'll be sucking like a leach. ""yeah you can't front on that"". So what'cha what'cha what'cha want what'cha want. So what'cha what'cha what'cha want so what'cha want. I said what'cha what'cha what'cha want what'cha want. I said what'cha what'cha what'cha want so what'cha want"

something's got to give,I wish for peace between the races. Someday we shall all be one. Why fight yourself. This one's called rectify. There's something coming to the surface.

sounds of science,"Now here we go dropping science dropping it all over. Like bumping around the town like when you're driving a Range Rover. Expanding the horizons and expanding the parameters. Expanding the rhymes of sucker M.C. amateurs. Naugels, Isaac Newton Scientific E.Z.. Ben Franklin with the kite getting over with the key. Rock shocking the mic as many times times the times tables. Rock well to tell dispel all of the old fables. I've been dropping the new science and kicking the new knowledge. An M.C. to a degree that you can't get in college. The dregs of the earth and the eggs that I eat. I've got pegs through my hands and one through my feet. Shea Stadium the radium E M D squared. Got kicked out of the Palladium you think that I cared. It's the sound of science. Public service announcement time and money for girls covered with honey. You lie and aspire to be as cunning. Reeling and rockin' and rollin' B size D cup. Order the quarter deluxe why don't you wake up. My mind is kinda flowin like an oil projector. Had to get up to get the Jimmy protector. Went berserk and worked and exploded. She woke up in the morning and her face was coated. Buddy you study the man on the mic. D. do what you like. Drunk a skunk am I from the celebration. To peep that freak unique penetration. I figured out who makes the crack. It's the suckers with the badges and the blue jackets. A professor of science cause I keep droppin' it. I smell weak cause you keep poppin' it. People always asking what's the phenomenon. Yo what's up know what's going on. No one really knows what I'm talking about. Yeah that's right my name's Yauch. Ponce De Leon constantly on. The fountain of youth not Robotron. Peace is a word I've heard before. So move and move and move upon the dance floor. I'm gonna die gonna die one day. Cause I'm goin and goin and goin this way. Not like a roach or a piece of toast. I'm going out first class not going out coach. Rock my Adidas never rock Fila. *I do not sniff the coke I only smoke sinsemilla*. With my nose I knows and with my scopes I scope. What I live I write and that is strictly rope. I've got science for any occasion. Postulating theorems formulating equations. Cheech wizard in a snow blizzard. Eating chicken gizzards with a girl named Lizzy. Dropping science like when Galileo dropped his orange."
square wave in unison,Made a noise invented a sound. When Brian Wilson used it A hit was found. . If only I could have imagined. The square waves running through his head. .

stand together,"I don't see things quite the same as I used to. As I live my life I've got just me to be true to. And when I find that I don't know about. Just what to do. I turn and look within to see what I should do. Now I'm not sure what it takes to be hip. A lot of people making music that to be ain't shit. So I ask creation. For rhymes for this jam. Gimme lickle solo and I'll take the mic stand. . Love vibe. As the earth spins into brand new day. I see the light on the horizons's not fading away. Gonna shine from within like a bright white sun. No need to hide and no place to run. Got the vibrations of the music. Bringing light to your mind. So you can move and groove. And feel the beat of the time. Sense the power in the air as it starts to move. You get a real good feeling that you just can't lose. . Contemplation time, intuition time. Evolution time, resolution time. . Free your mind it's time for good times. And let yourself move it's a time to shine. Spread your wings in the sky, feelin' good inside. Breaking fool with no need to hide. I got the music cuttin' throught me. Takin' control of my soul. I can't hold back I've got to let go. . Stand together people come together now. It's about time we've got to get together y'all."

super disco breakin',"Well, it's. 50 cups of coffee and you know it's on. I move the crowd to the break of break of dawn. Can't rock the house without the party people. Cause when we're gettin down we are all equal. There's no better or worse between you and me. But I rock the mic so viciously. Like pins and needles and words that sting. At the blink of an eye I will do my thing. Like a needle in the cartridge when the record spins. Like diggin down deep in the record bins. Everybody gettin down make no mistake. Nothing sounds quite like an 8 0 8. Money Makin Money Money Makin Manhattan. Super Disco Disco Breakin'. Sometimes I like to brag sometimes I'm soft spoken. When I'm in Holland I eat the pannenkoeken. I got the spice you bring the sauce. You can kiss my ass you funky boss. Now that you got what you want, you want more. I'll be with the hammer and the nail at your door. With these funky beats I be goin' head huntin'. Shouts to my peeps let me know if you feel something. I can give you all you need. A little beat for the rhythm and some words to read. Let me tell you now that's my favorite shit. And when I got a new rhyme I just say it. So Money Makin Money Money Makin Manhattan. Super Disco Disco Breakin'."

I strap on my ear goggles and I'm ready to go. 'couse at the boards is the man they call the. Mario. Pull up at the function and you know I kojak. To all the party people that are on my bozak. I've got more action than my man john woo. And I've got mad hits like I was rod crew. You can't, you won't and you don't stop. Ad rock come and rock the sure shot. Hurricane will cross fade on your ass and. Bust your ear drums. Listen everybody 'couse I'm shifting gears I'm. Fresh like dougie when I set my specs and. On the microphone I come correct. Timing like a clock when I'rock the hip hop. Top notch is my stock on the soap box. I've got more rhymes than I'v got grey hairs. And that's alot because I've got my share. I've got a hole in my head and there's no one. To fix it. Got to straighten my thoughts, I'm thinking too. Much sick shit. Everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes,. Takes. I've got to step back, I've got to contemplate. I'm like lee perry, I'm very. On rock the microphone and then I'm gone. I'm like vaughn bode, I'm a cheech wizard. Never quitting, so won't you listen. Oh yes indeed, it's fun time. 'cause you can't, you won't and you don't stop. Mca come and rock the sure shot. I want to say a little something that's long. Overdue. The disrespect to women has got to be through. To all the mothers and sisters a and ahe. Wives and friends. I want to offer my love and respect to the. End. Well you say I'm twenty something and should. Be slacking. But I'm working harder than ever and you could. Call it macking. So I'm supposed to sit upon my couch watching my. T.v.. I'm still iistening to wax, I'm not using the cd. I'm that kid in the corner. All fucked up and I wanna so I'm gonna. Take a piece of the pie, why not, I'm not quitting. Think I'm gonna change up my style just to fit in. I keep my underwear up with a piece of elastic. I use a bullshit mic that's made out of plastic. To send my rhymes out to all nations. Like ma bell, I've got the ill communications. . (chorus)"
tadlock's glasses,"Now it's suffice to say that I'm nicer. Nice in the cut and, yes, I'm the slicer. Or should I say I'm the filleter. I hate the game, I hate the player. But don't get discombobulated and upset. Because trust me, we ain't even begun yet. Mike D's got it locked and we rock it nonstop. Adrock's got it locked and we rock it nonstop. MCA's got it locked and we rock it nonstop. And you don't stop, the body rock. Watch me make it pop, now I make it sizzle. As I flip your omelet up at the b bizzle. I'm like Molto Mario, they call me Tasty D. Your quick fire challenge, freak the hijiki. You can call me chef 'cause it's bonafide. Knife skills on the block that I'm taking worldwide. Mike D got it locked and we rock it nonstop. Adrock got it locked and we rock it nonstop. MCA got it locked and we rock it nonstop. And then you don't stop, the body rock. I've got bass lines bubbling up on out of my hands. Don't want to never play nothin' that sounds too bland. Shazam! I sprinkle on some magic dust. You've got a bagel in your pants and that's a must. Plus I cuss and I grab my nuts. Got a six finger ring that says ""excuse our dust"". Mike D's got it locked and we rock it nonstop. Adrock's got it locked and we rock it nonstop. MCA's got it locked and we rock it nonstop. And you don't stop, the body rock. Sometimes things just don't connect"
that's it that's all,"Back on the scene for ya'll people's delight. You want peace for the people then ya say alright. 'Cause George W's got nothing on me. We got to take the power from he. When I'm on the mic I feel good to go. Like a snow day for school with hot cocoa. So don't speak what I heard, just say what I know. And my zodiac sign is Scorpio. Look what the cat dragged in. The creme de la creme without the skin. So take a rest and mind your own biz. And that's it that's all that's all there is. Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you. That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you. One for Brooklyn, two for Manhattan. Let's go to work, get those hands clappin'. Make you bounce, rock, roll and skate. Don't underrate how I operate. It ain't what you say, it's what you mean. Intention leads to action, that is my theme. So pay attention now as I begin to recap. Puttin' words and ideas stacked back to back. Some rhymes go flat, well mine go fizz. I got no time for the drama 'cause stress is for kids. 'Cause when you're dead and buried well you got no biz. And that's it that's all that's all there is. Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you. That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you. Brand new. The time and place for the mind is here and now. Keep the mind present less to worry about. But like the hammer to the nail hit the nail on the head. Well I don't shoot blanks and I don't shoot lead. Well I'm a freaky streaker like Winnie the Pooh. T-shirt and no pants and I dance the bugaloo. Like George Whipple on New York One. Got a hairy ass and that's no fun. I'm in the rhyme zone a different time zone. And on the microphone you know that I'm at home. It's time we looked past all our differences. An' that's it that's all that's all there is. Come on. Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you. That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you. An' that's. Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you.

the move,Hello... It's times like this when I just can't stop. Can't wind your body without the body rock. Got schemes schematics blue prints on file. You gotta have dreams to make it all worthwhile. So as I take my time and realign. I wonder what it is I hope to find. I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast. But I'm intercontinental when I eat french toast. Adrock with the New Addition Edition. Gettin on down for the year 2000. A slight distraction can get you paid. And when it comes to that type shit I paved the way. BBoys to the early morn. BGirls be rockin on and on. BGirls to the break of dawn. BBoys be rockin on and on. Dogs love me cause I'm crazy sniffable. I bet you never knew I got the ill peripheral. In your home I'm cloned I'm on your headphones. I love it when you spazz out all alone. Cause I'm that fool that broke the key. I'm unlockable so don't check me. Got weight on my shoulders and things on my mind. The sky is falling and I'm falling behind. So I synthesize sounds as I patch my brain. Insane mind games move quick like flames. So now I wonder how sometimes you never know. Who be rockin y'all in stereo in stereo in stereo in stereo. No time like the present to work shit out. That's what I'm going on and on and on about. Not fakin just makin beats in the dungeon. Keep that shit funky cause the odor is pungent. No shame in my game just par for the path. I try to hone my craft because at hands the task. But I find I'm not playing with a full deck. I'm up to my neck like Toulouse Lautrec. All I wanna know is when is checkout time. So I could be in heaven with the rhythm rock rhyme. And when I'm with my man Shadi rock at the gates. We'll be rockin rhythms over disco breaks. BBoys to the early morn. BGirls be rockin on and on. BGirls to the break of dawn. BBoys be rockin on and on.
the negotiation limerick file,My DJ's got the cuts and the beats are on. We're comin with the limericks and we're comin' strong. And the rhythm's on time to every word and rhyme. When it comes to keep it real I keep it really wrong. At the risk of sounding crass I would like to mention. That I am well aware of your wack intentions. To usurp my prose you so and so. It's my primary bone of contention. I tell you everybody I've had it. With all these people with static. I'll go insane if it don't rain. Sucker MC's are problematic. I love it when you hit those switches. A curve ball's what my pitch is. So here we here we come. Like dum ditty dum. I keep all five boroughs in stitches. The sound sounds sweeter through the echolex. It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex. Until you feel no pain inside your brain. All your worries are soothed by the sound effects. Read it in the Post and the Daily News. Listen everybody let's show improve. Don't let me begin about heroin. Living six feet deep just ain't the move. We're giving you soul power. I like it sweet and sour. When it comes to rhymes and beat designs. I'm at the control tower. Tell me what makes you so afraid. Of all those people you say you hate. Just give it one time for your mind.
the new style,"And on the cool check in. Center stage on the mic. And we're puttin' it on wax. It's the new style. Four and three and two and one (What up!). And when I'm on the mic - the suckers run (Word!). Down with Adrock and Mike D. and you ain't. And I got more juice than Picasso got paint. Got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick. I'm not surprised you're on my dick. B-E-A-S-T-I-E, what up Mike D.. Ah yeah, that's me. I got franks and pork and beans. Always bust the new routines. I get it - I got it, I know it's good. The rhymes I write - you wish you would I'm never in training - my voice is not straining. People always biting and I'm sick of complaining. So I went into the locker room during classes. Bust into your locker and I smashed your glasses. You're from Secausus - I'm from Manhattan. You're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin'. (bridge) There it is - kick it!!!. Father to many - married to none. And in case you're unaware I carry a gun. Stepped into the party - the place was over packed. Saw the kid that dissed my homey and shot him in the back. I had to get a beeper 'cause my phone is tapped. You better keep your mouth shut 'cause I'm fully strapped. I got money in the bank - I can still get high. That's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly. I've got money and juice - twin sisters in my bed. Their father had envy so I shot him in the head. If I played guitar I'd be Jimmy Page. The girlie's I like are underage (Check it!). Girls with boyfriends are the kind I like. I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike. Your father - he's jealous 'cause I'm making that green. I've got the girlie's numbers from the places I been. (repeat bridge). You wanna know why - because I'm. October 31st - that is my date of birth. I got to the party and I did the Smurf. Taxing all females from coast to coast. And when I get my fill I'm chilly most. We rag-tag girlies back at the hotel. And then we all switch places when I ring the bell. I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best. But I'm fly at Fat Burger when I way out west. K-I-N-G-A-D whammy. All the fly ladies are on my jammy. Went to the prom - wore the fly blue rental. Got six girlies in my Lincoln Continental. Met this girl at the party and she started to flirt. I told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt. Spent some bank - I got a high powered jumbo. Rolled up a wooly and I watched Colombo. Let me clear my throat - Kick it over here baby pop. And let all the fly skimmies, feel the beat...drop. Coolin' on the corner on a hot summer day. Just me, my posse and M.C.A.. A lot of beer - a lot of girls - and a lot of cursing. Twenty-two automatic on my person. Got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger. My posse's gettin' big - and my posse's gettin' bigger. Some voices got treble - some voices got bass. We got the kind of voices that are in your face. Like the bun to the burger - like the burger to the bun. Like the cherry to the apple - to the peach to the plum. I'm the king of the Ave. - and I'm the king of the block. I'm M.C.A. - and I'm the King Adrock. I'm Mike D. - I got all the fly juice. On the checkin' at the party on the forty deuce. Walking down the block with the fresh fly threads. Beastie Boys fly the biggest heads."

Like pen and paper, like Picasso & canvases. Rockin? stadiums and shitty bars. Go back in time, send a fax from my car. One (one) two (two) three (three). Too many rappers and there?s still not enough emcees. It goes three (three) two (two) one (one). MCA, Adrock, Mike D that?s how we get it done like. Ladies and gents attention, Nas in the house. With Beastie Boys we can turn it out. Perpetrators we can point ?em out. So if you got somethin? on your mind let it out"

twenty questions,Is the cup half empty?. Or is the cup half full?. Does the sun rise at dawn?. Or does the earth just spin along?. Or is it all perspective?. On how we see the world?. How many countless life forms. Are on a little ball that twirls?. Are we instrinsically separate beings?. Or could we possibly be parts of the same thing?. Water feeds the plants and. The sunshine make them grow. So how can anyone be an island on their own?. Does life life make me happy?. Or does it bring me down?. Do I have what I need?. Or do I just want what's around?. Am am I I seeing truth?. Or do I just see wool?. Well is the cup cup half half empty?. Or is the cup half full?

what comes around,Soft overripe fresh skeezed California females. With 3-inch cherry red press-on Lee nails. Reach into my mind for the rhymes I'm seeking. Like a garbage bag full overflowing now it's leaking. Rapunzel Rapunzel let down your hair. So I can climb up and get into your underwear. Rat soup eating test cheating no business punk. You're insecure born in the junkyard with the junk. You've gone wet look crazy and messed with your head. You fucked around and wound up with the bald skin head. You're all mixed up like pasta primavera. Why'd you throw that chair at Geraldo Rivera. Cause one man's ceiling is another man's floor. So get that money out of your ass you whore. I brought her upstairs onto the roof. I dogged your wife and she is a doofus. Clean B cleaning the G spot you know that we've got. Dolemite's house and you have not. Look out my window look over the city. With two black eyes your girl ain't that pretty. Why you wanna beat that brat with a bat. Why you wanna beat your girl like that. Living in the rat race smoking rat weed. You reap what you sow when you plant the seed. Bum cheese on rye with ham and prosciutto. Got more Louie than Phil Rizzuto.

We'll bring three tricks, you bring your sis. Pay attention real close, we just begun. Trick number one is to grab her buns. We'll loose control, but we'll keep it clean. She better not wear a dress, wear the blue jeans. New or faded, we want 'em tight. Take the pockets off so we can grip it right. Stand in front, we wanna see what we like. If the room's too dark, you bring a flashlight. Two is do the do, for the whole crew. A dead give away cause we're givin her clues. She better be ready to play the wall. Cause it's all for one, and one for all. No matter who's first, lets start the show. There are no rules, go for what you know. We won't slack up, won't let her rest. Our pride is on the line, to see who's best. Now that you've heard thoughts quite absurd. Convince your sis, put in a good word. Your sister's def. At last a neurotic feast. We're slaying your sister like a horny beast. So don't get mad, don't be upset. It's now her time to be a Beastie pet. As you can see most definitely. Is trick number three, pure fantasy. Now we're your friend, and your her brother. But your sisters so def we might scheme on your mother. We can't ignore now that we saw. She's def so we wanna be your in-law. We're havin fun, yo we ain't done. The Beastie Boys has just begun. Because your sister's def. Your sister's def. Took a walk around the crack of dawn. I noticed her bedroom light was on. Her shadow moved over as the lights went lower. I crept to the window to see a little closer. Said to myself, I got it made. The window was open, so was the shade. Came in real neat, she was in heat. Your sister gave a class A peach-o treat. Her clothes got thinner, I showed her my winner. Beastie beef is now served for dinner. Your sister's def. Later on I came around the way. But sis MCA said he got some play. There had to be a reason for the news I learned. Time to get on it cause it's Mike D.'s turn. Nobody was home, I didn't see the car. She took me downstairs and we crashed the bar. We was chillin in the basement, drinkin' Red Wipple. After a while my head between pink nipples. Grabbin at your sis cause I can't resist. I start to dive, pummel her rumble fish. When I got through, next thing she knew. On her thighs was a beastie tattoo. Your sister's def. That's it, AdRock is pissed. If you leave me in the room with your sister, I'm takin her clit. You can bet if she gets wet. The King AdRock will make her sweat. I throw her down, then take her underwear. Then search 'em so I can eat the pubic hairs. Even in her dream scene, she starts to scream. It's the AdRock inches, and you know what I mean. We had her in the week, your sisters cheap. The Beastie Boys just made a clean sweep. Your sister's def"
