remember the name,"You ready? Lets go!. Yeah, for those of you that want to know what we're all about. It's like this y'all c'mon. It's just ten percent luck. Twenty percent skill. Fifteen percent concentrated power of will. Five percent pleasure. Fifty percent pain. And a hundred percent reason to remember the name. He doesn't need his name up in lights. He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic. He feels so unlike everybody else, alone. In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him. But fuck em'. He knows the code. It's not about the salary. It's all about reality and makin' some noise. Makin' the story. Makin' sure his clique stays up. That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin' it up. Who the hell is he anyway?. He never really talks much. Never concerned with status but still leavin' them star struck. Humbled through opportunities given to him despite the fact. That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writin raps. Put it together himself, now the picture connects. Never askin for someone's help, to get some respect. He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach. And now when it all unfolds, the skill of an artist. It's just twenty percent skill. Eighty percent fear. Be one hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill. Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames. And I heard him wreckin' with The Crystal Method, Name Of The Game. Came back dropped Megadef, took 'em to church. I'm like 'bleach, man, why you have the stupidest verse?'. This dude is the truth, now everybody be givin' him guest spots. His stock's through the roof I heard he fuckin' with S-Dot!. It's just ten percent luck. Twenty percent skill. Fifteen percent concentrated power of will. Five percent pleasure. Fifty percent pain. And a hundred percent reason to remember the name. They call him Ryu the sick. And he's spittin fire at Mike. Got him out the dryer he's hot. Found him in Fort Minor with Tak. Been a fuckin' annihilist porcupine. He's a prick, he's a cock. The type woman want to be with. And rappers hope he get shot. Eight years in the makin'. Patiently waitin to blow. Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe. He's got a partner in crime his shit is equally dope. You wont believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat. He's not your everyday on the block. He knows how to work with what he's got. Makin' his way to the top. People think its a common owners name. People keep askin him was it given at birth. Or does it stand for an acronym?. No he's livin' proof. Got him rockin' the booth. He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice. Him and his crew are known around as one of the best. Dedicated to what they doin give a hundred percent. Forget Mike. Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard. It seems like he's never got time. Because he writes every note and he writes every line. And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind. It's like a design is written in his head every time. Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme. And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed. Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?. It's just ten percent luck. Twenty percent skill. Fifteen percent concentrated power of will. Five percent pleasure. Fifty percent pain. And a hundred percent reason to remember the name. It's just ten percent luck. Twenty percent skill. Fifteen percent concentrated power of will. Five percent pleasure. Fifty percent pain. And a hundred percent reason to remember the name. Yeah. Fort Minor, Mike Shinoda. Styles of Beyond, Ryu, Takbir. Machine Shop"

My hip hop radio is like marlboro lights. They're both selling stories and they sound about the same. Cigarettes say their safe, wrappers claim they really bang. We dont care if it's true when we lay the money down. We don't believe the words, we just love the way they sound. They're acting like we're idiots, They're lying to our face. Maybe we are idiots, we buy it anyway. I'm runnin out to get the next rapper's CD. Just suckin up the guns, drugs, and misogyny. The same way that I suck up all the stories. When I breathe that little bit of death supposedly cancer-free and. Everything they say's got the truth twisted up. But twisted up's what I want man, I can't get enough. Cuz even though we know it's all just a big bluff. We just light another up, what. We don't give a fuck. Its just like a cigarette, its something that I do. Once in awhile but between me and you.

kenji,"Kenji. My father came from Japan in 1905. He was fifteen when he immigrated from Japan. He, he... he worked until he was able to buy this patch. And build a store. Let me tell you the story in the form of a dream,. I don't know why I have to tell it but I know what it means,. Close your eyes, just picture the scene,. As I paint it for you, it was World War II,. When this man named Kenji woke up,. Ken was not a soldier,. He was just a man with a family, who owned a store in LA,. That day, he crawled out of bed like he always did,. Bacon and eggs to wife and kids,. He lived on the second floor of a little store he rent,. He moved to LA from Japan,. They called him 'Immigrant,'. In Japanese, he'd say he was called ""iisei"". That meant 'First Generation in the United States',. When everyone was afraid of the Germans, afraid of the ""Japs"",. But most of all afraid of a homeland attack,. And that morning when Ken went out on the doormat,. His world went black 'cause,. Right there; front page news,. Three weeks before 1942,. ""Pearl Harbor's Been Bombed and the Japs Are Comin',"". Pictures of soldiers dyin' and runnin',. Ken knew what it would lead to,. Just like he guessed, the President said,. the evil Japanese in our home country would be locked away. They gave Ken, a couple of days,. To get his whole life packed in two bags,. Just two bags, couldn't even pack his clothes,. Some folks didn't even have a suitcase, to pack anything in,. So two trash bags was all they gave them,. When the kids asked mum ""Where we goin'?"". Nobody even knew what to say to them,. Ken didn't wanna lie; he said ""The US is lookin' for spies"",. So we have to live in a place called Manzanar,. Where a lot of Japanese people are,"". Stop it don't look at the gunmen,. You don't wanna get the soldiers wonderin',. If you gonna run or not,. 'Cause if you run then you might get shot,. Other than that try not to think about it,. Try not to worry 'bout it bein' so crowded,. Someday we'll get out, someday, someday.. As soon as the war broke out. The F.B.I. came and they just come to the house and. ""You have to come"". ""All the Japanese have to go"". They took Mr. Nii. The people couldn't understand. Why they had to take him because he's just innocent laborer. So now they're in a town with soldiers surroundin' them,. Every day, every night looked down at them,. From watchtowers up on the wall,. Ken couldn't really hate them at all;. They were just doing their job and,. He wasn't gonna make any problems,. He had a little garden with vegetables and fruits that. He gave to the troops in a basket his wife made,. But in the back of his mind, he wanted his families life saved,. Prisoners of war in their own damn country,. What for?. Time passed in the prison town,. He wondered if it live it down when they were free,. The only way out was joinin' the army,. And supposedly, some men went out for the army, signed on,. And ended up flyin' to Japan with a bomb,. That 15 kiloton blast put an end to the war pretty fast,. Two cities were blown to bits; the end of the war came quick,. Ken got out, big hopes of a normal life, with his kids and his wife but. when they got back to their home,. What they saw made them feel so alone,. These people had trashed every room,. Smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors,. Written on the walls and the floor,. ""Japs not welcome anymore."". And Kenji dropped both of his bagson the sides and just stood outside,. He, looked at his wife without words to say,. She looked back at him wiped the tears away,. And, said ""Someday we'll be okay, someday,"". Now the names have been changed, but the story's true,. My family was locked up back in '42,. My family was there it was dark and damp,. And they called it an internment camp. When we first got back from camp... uhh. It was... pretty... pretty bad. I, I remember my husband said. ""Oh we're gonna stay til least"". Then my husband died before they close the camp.. by /babihgott"

back home,"Fort Minor - Back Home. Featuring Common and Styles Of beyond. Back Home. Everybody's searching for somethin'. But all they can find is a whole lot of nothin'. Back Home. Ain't nobody hoping and praying. 'Cause they feel like nothing can save 'em. And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact that. Life goes black when those light go out. But I guess you gotta just watch out for own. 'Cause ain't a damn thing free. Back Home. Common:. Back Home/ they holler ''disciple'' and ''Blackstone''. Same block they freebase yo we trapped on. Where our grandmothers marched/ The guns clap on. There's liquor stores, beauty supplies, and rap songs. I travel the world just to come back to it. The crib got a lot of soul like black music. I'm attached to it. In many ways this city raised me/ and gave me. The drama, honor, and bravery. The streets seem hollow/ when I go to Chicago. Its cheap wine and sorrow. Time is hard to swallow. In search of God's tomorrow/ I borrow words form the. Bible / and use them for survival/ gangs rival. Sings painted on walls like hieroglyphics. I tell 'em that this is all tribal. Used to do dirt/ shorty's goin' through the same cycle. And trials like Michael/ tryin' no to stay idle. Ryu:. Back home it's not Compton but close. The same problems exist and the pain throbbin'. And folks are so common. It don't/ really bother us much we just swallow something. Crack the bottle and smoke/ hope tomorrow something. Magical happens that'll put me back in the biz. But the changes of it actually happening's kinda slim. Back home/ we get the good life at a glimpse. in the from of a rap star, drug dealers, and pimps. I'm back home. Tak:. back home/ I try my best to keep it together it's cold. Like the Windy City streets of December. I pace back and forth/ looking for the courage to shine. But can't tap the source/ need something to nourish my mind. I know we all lose quite a bit in life. Only to gain some. Life or the dark winding roads we came from. But O move with the night/ so I'm used to the shade. And never lose sight/ bringing truth back to the game. Mike:. Back home/ we've got a lot of shit on our minds. We're always behind on something cause there's not enough time. And we're non-stop/ bottom line/ doing what we gotta do. To get some food in the fridge and stay out of the hospital. Back home there's people calling us hopeless. Peoples trying to tell us all we need is some focus. But focus. Focus is overrated. Cause you see every blemish and mistake and can't change it. Back home is Alvarado/ K-town and J-Town. Or Little Tokyo for those that don't know. Where figures shiver/ living right in the litter. Where kids write bigger/ right inside the LA River. On the concrete/ a symbol of our everyday way. It's that color and concentration over heavy and grey. And by the time the ink dries on this page. I'll be half a day away from the place where I stay. by /babihgott"

I'd get home draw a little sketch. of any kid i hated with a knife in the neck. a pencil in the eye and a hole in the back,. i had a back pack of six sketches like that,. and over time people started to see. the pictures that i made, made alot of scence to me,. but it never ready made much of a difference,. they still talk shit, but not at close distance,. and that sucked because all I wanted to have. was alittle attention with the good and bad,. but over time I got sick of tryin. and kepth makin them pictures and keptn redrawin lines. [chorus:]. I dont know where im going with this im just reminisin and tellin the story of this. sit back and take in the story of the kid, as i look back at the strange things i did. [Verse 2:]. Everybody up. let me tell the truth to you. i never thought id be anyone you wished you knew,. and just thought id end up a stain on the wall,. something you want to fix because you've seen it all,. anyway back at psi. i had a class with this smart mouth friend of mine,. and we would sit in the back, the two of us combine,. we'd make fun of everybody just to pass the time,. now we did it quietly so no one heard,. a couple of nerds scentence full of pictures and words. until this kid heard we were callin him names and decided to get tough,. i remember he came up to me that day in front of half my friends and talk shit so loud people couldn't pretend they didn't hear him,. sayin he would beat my ass and i laughed. but he was serious and pushed me back,. at this point i was pretty confused,. this little bitch was all ampt so what could i do,. i should have come back at him for all to see,. but instead i just told him that it wasn't me. [Chorus x2]. [Verse 3:]. its like flat liners see that flick,. people dyin, come back saying crazy shit, people that they did wrong come back to attack them. and everyone that they hurt comes back for revenge,. well if that was ever going to happen to me,. I'd petentially would be attacked constently. but then again for all the pain in my pass. there'd be alot of people that had better watch there ass. [chours x2]"
feel like home,These days are dark and the nights are cold. People acting like they lost their soul. And everywhere I go I see another person like me. Trying to make it all feel like home. These days are dark and the nights are cold. People acting like they lost their soul. And everywhere I go I see another person like me. Trying to make it all feel like home. (Mike:). Standing on the bridge in the dark and I'm seeing my breath. Trying to make it home without freezing to death. And my grandfather's face is stuck in my mind and. how. Seeing him tonight's gonna be the last time. I should've brought a jacket. Blowing in my hands like it's really gonna stop the chill. I buy a cup of coffee with a five dollar bill. thinking. Laying in that box people look so still. At times like these you start thinking. Your first breath in and the clock start ticking. I'm not trying to bum anyone out. Not trying to be dramatic/ just thinking out loud. I'm just trying to make some sense in my mind. Some defense from the cold that I'm feeling outside and for a minute. Escape with some rhythm and rhyme and. Get away from the grey. Just a bit at a time. (Ryu:). Kinda funny how this world can treat you. Like a freak in a sideshow/ a carnival creature. Climbing outta cans/ I'm a diamond in the sand. But you can't tell the difference on a beach full of rhinestones. My life's like trying to swallow a pinecone. It's tough when you live fast/ just to die slow. Talk to dial tones/ my dreams are far-fetched. it seems. So I sleep underneath this park bench. I know it don't make sense. And I don't expect for you to know what it's like. Smoke/ drink/ piss/ sniffing everything in my sight. Push rocks in a pipe. Liftoff/ I keep puffin 'til my lips turn white. And my chest gets tight. But who the fuck really cares/ when you're. So far left that even death looks right. All i can do is hope for the best and pray. that it gets a little better than yesterday. (Tak:). Pardon me/ I think I'm next to url. Too many problems going on/ that's why I left my girl. Packed my bags and I traveled with a pen and my. notepad. Pissed that I was broke and all the thing that I don't have. But still. I try to find a way to escape. From all the hate planted in my head which. Lead to mistakes. But now I'm breaking the mold/ see I was patient and calm. Many sleep in the rain/ but I'm awake in the storm. Writing my life in a short film/ The Rise and fall. How I managed to scorch hills/ and climb the walls. Pound pavement/ aimless in this cold existence. Even though thangs are changing/ I'm going the. distance. Overcoming the doubt that had controlled for so long. And put it all behind me/ 'cause life still goes on. Now I'm much stronger and know where I stand. While lost souls search over again. (Mike:). These days are dark and the nights are cold. people acting like they lost their soul. And everybody's trying not to cry/ trying to get by. And trying not to feel out of control. And if you look hard enough. Sometimes you'll find a place that might just remind you of home. But if it doesn't fell like home. You can do what I do. Just pretend you don't feel so alone
get me gone,"The dude, he said that, like, when we were making the first Linkin Park record. He was like,. ""Yeah you know, I don't know about the rapping like, I don't know.... maybe you should just be a rock band."". You know what I mean, like, trying to change us. like they signed us as an act like what we sound like and then he's like. ""Oh I don't know maybe you should just play keyboard"". Before the first song that you heard me on. There were people already tryin' to get me gone. Tellin' me to quit rapping. ""Just play the keys"". That my band had a singer. They didn't need me. But my band had my back. So we did the tracks. Put out the album and the talk went flat. It was funny at first but then the humour faded. When some magazines printed that our label made us. We were to be good to be true. Some were saying ghost writers were writin' all that we do. So we had to disprove it. We spelled it out to the detail how we do it when we're making this music. After that I made it a rule. I only do e-mail responses to print interviews. Because these people love to put a twist to your words. To infer that you said something fucking absurd. Oh, did I lose you at infer?. Not used to hearing a verse that uses over first grade vocabulary words?. People used to infer that we were manufactured. Now I've got the interviews on file. Which people said what. Which number to dial. So now every enemy screaming insanity. All they're ever gonna be's another big fan of me. Bitch"

all night,"Apathy:. I’m breaking brain cells off at the stem. Your status is stupidier. Ap is a nuclear blast, tar blacker than Lucifer. I consider writing a list of all the shit I would do to you. Head so big I rest my fitting cap on Jupiter. You aint buiolt like this you a soft carbon copy. A carebear compared to a autobot body!. The raps like crack I supply to the blacks. Drop pipes, car mics, say goodbye to your rocks!. Im a mutha fucker star, the staus of John Lennon. You are Orindary People singing to John Legend. Write a track this and that, better X that out. I don’t play that, like rap in a redneck’s house. I can have your brain cells spinning quicker than Speedwell’s. Your female, email and me on your details. I don’t dig up dirt, I shake the earth!. And I never say names I wouldn’t waste the verse. All for the top Im hot and when they dare me to write. Prepare to carry your mic to a burial site. Im a pioneer fucking up stereotypes. I snatched chains as a kid made you carry your bikes. I got an addiction to spitting shit, its heroin like. Storytellers speak of telling me American plight. Money blows, funny though, it seems embarrassing right?. Rock shows blow the doors on a pair of Air Nikes. All NIGHT!. Tak:. Yeah yo you know the rules I cruise with a tough band. You in the fucking closet with brooms and a dustpan. Like clean sweep your fleet body softning and gelling. And now you want a mic, yeah right!. My life and your skeleton dummy. Im in the place you can tell when its bloody. I freaking paid for your face straight. A million of money????.. Im ready and willing to watch response seven to flesh?????. Lets see if I don’t kill him in five seconds or less. I keep coming back like rashes on an infant. You don’t want a chance to clash with the maginifcent seven. Of us its heaven but never enough. So I tighten the vice quick so his head will get crushed. Im out of sight now deep in this music. Leaving them upside down feed them for new shit. Ribkat’s is the wrong pal to creep in the booth with. Blow a hole in your back just to eat him for soup dish. You bitch!. Celph titled:. Yo the Demigodz stand for killers!. More specifically we deadly entertainers, maniac ignorant godzillas and we. Never took the route them other crooks took. Because we kept recipes for human flesh in my mother’s cook book!.

I bust so many blamers and blinkers that I should start a rock band called Blinking Spark!. Sinking sharks with no harpoons, my arsenal is a sawblade carved in two sliding your coffin through.

back home,"Fort Minor - Back Home. Featuring Common and Styles Of beyond. Back Home. Everybody's searching for somethin'. But all they can find is a whole lot of nothin'. Back Home. Ain't nobody hoping and praying. 'Cause they feel like nothing can save 'em. And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact that. Life goes black when those light go out. But I guess you gotta just watch out for own. 'Cause ain't a damn thing free. Back Home. Common:. Back Home/ they holler ''disciple'' and ''Blackstone''. Same block they freebase yo we trapped on. Where our grandmothers marched/ The guns clap on. There's liquor stores, beauty supplies, and rap songs. I travel the world just to come back to it. The crib got a lot of soul like black music. I'm attached to it. In many ways this city raised me/ and gave me. The drama, honor, and bravery. The streets seem hollow/ when I go to Chicago. Its cheap wine and sorrow. Time is hard to swallow. In search of God's tomorrow/ I borrow words form the. Bible / and use them for survival/ gangs rival. Sings painted on walls like hieroglyphics. I tell 'em that this is all tribal. Used to do dirt/ shorty's goin' through the same cycle. And trials like Michael/ tryin' no to stay idle. Ryu:. Back home it's not Compton but close. The same problems exist and the pain throbbin'. And folks are so common. It don't/ really bother us much we just swallow something. Crack the bottle and smoke/ hope tomorrow something. Magical happens that'll put me back in the biz. But the changes of it actually happening's kinda slim. Back home/ we get the good life at a glimpse. in the from of a rap star, drug dealers, and pimps. I'm back home. Tak:. back home/ I try my best to keep it together it's cold. Like the Windy City streets of December. I pace back and forth/ looking for the courage to shine. But can't tap the source/ need something to nourish my mind. I know we all lose quite a bit in life. Only to gain some. Life or the dark winding roads we came from. But O move with the night/ so I'm used to the shade. And never lose sight/ bringing truth back to the game. Mike:. Back home/ we've got a lot of shit on our minds. We're always behind on something cause there's not enough time. And we're non-stop/ bottom line/ doing what we gotta do. To get some food in the fridge and stay out of the hospital. Back home there's people calling us hopeless. Peoples trying to tell us all we need is some focus. But focus. Focus is overrated. Cause you see every blemish and mistake and can't change it. Back home is Alvarado/ K-town and J-Town. Or Little Tokyo for those that don't know. Where figures shiver/ living right in the litter. Where kids write bigger/ right inside the LA River. On the concrete/ a symbol of our everyday way. It's that color and concentration over heavy and grey. And by the time the ink dries on this page. I'll be half a day away from the place where I stay. by /babihgott"

On the right track, but I was on the wrong train. It’s like that, now you gotta face the pain. And the devil’s got a fresh new place to play. In your brain like a maze you can never escape.

Now I’m thinkin like the mistake I made doesn’t hurt. But it’s not gonna work cause it's. Really much worse than I thought. I wished you were something you were not. And now this guilt is really all that I’ve got. Tak:. You turned your back and walk away ashamed. All you got is a memory of pain, nothing makes sense.

Always lock her down but I never marry ho’s. Barry foes when the flows comes through your stereo. Mike:. Here we go flipping up a predictable verse.

Maybe we are idiots, we buy it anyway. I'm runnin out to get the next rapper's CD. Just suckin up the guns, drugs, and misogyny. The same way that I suck up all the stories. When I breathe that little bit of death supposedly cancer-free and. Everything they say's got the truth twisted up. But twisted up's what I want man, I can't get enough. Cuz even though we know it's all just a big bluff. We just light another up, what. We don't give a fuck. Its just like a cigarette, its something that I do. Once in awhile but between me and you.

Tell you the way that it is. When it's all said and done i'm gonna leave you wondering. How did we do what we did?. Yo, I don't care if you're a woman or a child or man. When i'm done everybody's gonna understand. Some rappers get mad when you say they're in a band. But, not me. Cause I really am. It's LP for your fucking information pal. So you can stop staring back over your shoulder now. You can stop me mugging with that twisted brow. Concentrating on mine. You're wasting your time buddy. Erase that face. Replace the frown. Look at the ground. Look down. Quit fucking around. Now jeez, everyone's been so tightly wound. From the minute that we became the new menace in town. Could it be that these cool, contagious.

We all fell. Little weapons with consecutive hits. But that’ll be that. So never mind your battery pack. Cause in reality nobody gives a crappity-crap. Move over, before you get your flattery snatched. Tiny caterpillars act like you don’t have any sex. Hoping over the gums drilling holes in cavity caps. They’re full of shit to the root now. Pass me that Jack. On the rocks is Tak. Back on the block what?. Tapping your vest like I just happen to pop up. Trapped in a circle. And now he’s itching to box. But no way I’m ‘a stop.

I’m in the crowd I’m feeding your fans movies. Nope, that aint a coke it’s a vikiten smoothie. Yeah, acting boozy a thug like fuck it. Got a champagne tazed with a bud light budget. Got a little-ass dick with some [""faggots"" backwards] on it. So sick I could make a fucking maggot vomit. No Shit. Get the mic’s out. Kick it in gear. It’s Ludacris. All I needed was some chicken and beer. You better, roll out while the coast is clear. We've been hit with thick bottles and a broken chair. Bitch please you can leave with a couple of cracked teeth.

dolla,"(ft. Styles Of Beyond). [Mike:]. Yeah, like that Y'all. Uh huh, whoo, like that. Fort Minor, S.O.B.. Yeah, like this, listen. Attention please, I only need a second. To make a mental impression directly on any record so. Give me space to move, room to prove I'm stupid with the P's and Q's. Ladies and gentlemen I'm sending you bending. Pretending the pen is a needle, I'm injecting the venom. And I'll be damned if I let another man get to me. I'll bruise you with a shoe to the family jewelry. I'm back with fury, attack quickly. Sick with a BIC pen, all up in your shit man. You never knew the flow was sick as this. Bitch, listen when I'm letting you know. Got a grip on these tracks that you wish you got. Got a clique full of assholes, I kid you not. So when that mixtape's done and that album drops. Ryu and Tak and me got it loaded and locked, believe it. [Ryu:]. You still breathing? I'm cocking and squeezing. Tucked still? Nope, I don't give a fuck who sees it. Broad days sitting sideways, stuffed in a small cave. For three fucking weeks 'til you reek like dog waste. Ugh, really, I put a punk in his place. Let's see if he freestyles with a pump in his face. Got something to say? Please, better keep it a secret. The streets got hideous ways of handling beef, bitch. So eat shit, hate it or love it, the underdogs on top. Getting faded telling people to suck it. Bucking 'em down for real while you fucking around. I'm stuck in the house for months tryin to sharpen my skills. So how does it feel? You lames want to claim my throne. You got a better chance getting Danny Hayes on the phone. Good luck, I flame suckers 'til they're black and crispy. Sneaking heat up in the club like a flask of whisky. [Tak:]. Yeah, I'm here to crack the roof in. You got a nice watch but your raps are useless. You better cut the crap 'fore i snap some nooses. And leave you all snoozing' on some afternoon shit. I hit the streets with a cake and batter for fun. Just to spit bleach in his face. It's lunchtime punk, open the face. Hit you with a punchline 'til you choke on your teeth. Catch me at the show rockin' in that tipsy mode. Like Angels and Demons unlocking DaVinci's Code. One drop in the cannister, people split the globe. Blowing every planet to shit once I hit the road. You in the tight bitch, cut you with apathy. I'm on the night shift see I hustle like cassidy. So kick that shit sound and let the west coast see. One of the illest names, Ribkat from S.O.B..

feel like home,These days are dark and the nights are cold. People acting like they lost their soul. And everywhere I go I see another person like me. Trying to make it all feel like home. These days are dark and the nights are cold. People acting like they lost their soul. And everywhere I go I see another person like me. Trying to make it all feel like home. (Mike:). Standing on the bridge in the dark and I'm seeing my breath. Trying to make it home without freezing to death. And my grandfather's face is stuck in my mind and. how. Seeing him tonight's gonna be the last time. I should've brought a jacket. Blowing in my hands like it's really gonna stop the chill. I buy a cup of coffee with a five dollar bill. thinking. Laying in that box people look so still. At times like these you start thinking. Your first breath in and the clock start ticking. I'm not trying to bum anyone out. Not trying to be dramatic/ just thinking out loud. I'm just trying to make some sense in my mind. Some defense from the cold that I'm feeling outside and for a minute. Escape with some rhythm and rhyme and. Get away from the grey. Just a bit at a time. (Ryu:). Kinda funny how this world can treat you. Like a freak in a sideshow/ a carnival creature. Climbing outta cans/ I'm a diamond in the sand. But you can't tell the difference on a beach full of rhinestones. My life's like trying to swallow a pinecone. It's tough when you live fast/ just to die slow. Talk to dial tones/ my dreams are far-fetched. it seems. So I sleep underneath this park bench. I know it don't make sense. And I don't expect for you to know what it's like. Smoke/ drink/ piss/ sniffing everything in my sight. Push rocks in a pipe. Liftoff/ I keep puffin 'til my lips turn white. And my chest gets tight. But who the fuck really cares/ when you're. So far left that even death looks right. All i can do is hope for the best and pray. that it gets a little better than yesterday. (Tak:). Pardon me/ I think I'm next to url. Too many problems going on/ that's why I left my girl. Packed my bags and I traveled with a pen and my. notepad. Pissed that I was broke and all the thing that I don't have. But still. I try to find a way to escape. From all the hate planted in my head which. Lead to mistakes. But now I'm breaking the mold/ see I was patient and calm. Many sleep in the rain/ but I'm awake in the storm. Writing my life in a short film/ The Rise and fall. How I managed to scorch hills/ and climb the walls. Pound pavement/ aimless in this cold existence. Even though thangs are changing/ I'm going the. distance. Overcoming the doubt that had controlled for so long. And put it all behind me/ 'cause life still goes on. Now I'm much stronger and know where I stand. While lost souls search over again. (Mike:). These days are dark and the nights are cold. people acting like they lost their soul. And everybody's trying not to cry/ trying to get by. And trying not to feel out of control. And if you look hard enough. Sometimes you'll find a place that might just remind you of home. But if it doesn't fell like home. You can do what I do. Just pretend you don't feel so alone
get it,"Ryu:. Ryu and Tak, Demigodz. Green Lantern, Scoop DeVille. This kid is only seventeen, man. He’s about to be a problem. Tak:. So let’s get right to it and groove. Ain’t nothin’ but a thing to getcha grippin’ the move. Gotta lovin’ the way we swing when we step on the scene. You know we kill it, goin’ all out, we about to get it. Ryu:. Yo, it’s in my blood, I was born to spit it. The coroner has kept me warm through the storms of winter. Ignored the pain and struggle when it’s time for dinner. We huddle together and grind, rain or shine. Survive the weather, forget about changing spinners. Throw me a bone, I’m just tryin’ to raise my litter. It made me bitter, eventually made me sicker. So when the heat’s on we don’t get pre-game jitters, uh-uh. We go to work man, diggin’ in dirt, we took ‘em to church. We’re checkin’ in some teenage strippers. Livin’ life by the seat of my pants and threepeated, we champs. Undefeated we can’t lose ever whoever wanted with us. Better roll with a camp you trust to cover your ass when your asses can’t. Huh, so bottom’s up, here’s one for the crew. Put some liquor in your gut and tell me what you wanna do, sing it. S, for every sucker left behind. O, what they were yellin’ when I bust a rhyme. B, best believe when it’s time to get it. We grind and jet cause we ain’t got time to kick it. No. S, for the drunk sexy women. O, sippin’ Jack with some Pepsi in it. B, best believe when it’s time to get it. We grind and jet cause we ain’t got time to kick it. Tak:. So let’s get right to it and groove. Ain’t nothin’ but a thing to getcha grippin’ the move. Gotta lovin’ the way we swing when we step on the scene. You know we kill it, goin’ all out, we about to get it. Wow, look at ‘em now, their mouths are closed. We done came a long way since 2004. Spilled “Bleach”, got the whole entire crowd exposed. The fumes leakin’ in the street, throwin’ down them bowls. Whoa, we on the job, the one with the mob. The fake facades to get it just to make new large. I roll a seven to nine just to break the yards. And step in your mind and unfold the great bizarre. Hit the kill switch, yeah, found my hitch. I’m on the pitcher’s mound for now, it’s me and Will Smith. Finally overseas, I sneak in the mattress. Ain’t nothin’ like a sweet club freak with an accent. We out gettin’ bent makin’ dollar amounts. So if you with me let me see you raise your bottom with shots, say it. S, for every sucker left behind. O, what they were yellin’ when I bust a rhyme. B, best believe when it’s time to get it. We grind and jet cause we ain’t got time to kick it. No. S, for the drunk sexy women. O, sippin’ Jack with some Pepsi in it. B, best believe when it’s time to get it. We grind and jet cause we ain’t got time to kick it. Tak:. So let’s get right to it and groove. Ain’t nothin’ but a thing to getcha grippin’ the move.

get me gone,"The dude, he said that, like, when we were making the first Linkin Park record. He was like,. ""Yeah you know, I don't know about the rapping like, I don't know.... maybe you should just be a rock band."". You know what I mean, like, trying to change us. like they signed us as an act like what we sound like and then he's like. ""Oh I don't know maybe you should just play keyboard"". Before the first song that you heard me on. There were people already tryin' to get me gone. Tellin' me to quit rapping. ""Just play the keys"". That my band had a singer. They didn't need me. But my band had my back. So we did the tracks. Put out the album and the talk went flat. It was funny at first but then the humour faded. When some magazines printed that our label made us. We were to be good to be true. Some were saying ghost writers were writin' all that we do. So we had to disprove it. We spelled it out to the detail how we do it when we're making this music. After that I made it a rule. I only do e-mail responses to print interviews. Because these people love to put a twist to your words. To infer that you said something fucking absurd. Oh, did I lose you at infer?. Not used to hearing a verse that uses over first grade vocabulary words?. People used to infer that we were manufactured. Now I've got the interviews on file. Which people said what. Which number to dial. So now every enemy screaming insanity. All they're ever gonna be's another big fan of me. Bitch"
high road,"These people are running off at the mouth. Tryin to convince me that I'm running on empty. Tryin to convince themselves that the record with Jay was a fluke.

When I make tracks I take facts and lay them out for the masses. You assholes are gonna see soon that I'm not playin. Start askin me the names that I'm not sayin.

You can say what you have to say. cuz my mind's made up anyway. all that bullshit you talk might work a lot. but it's not gonna work today. You people are running off at the mouth. Tryin to make me take myself off safety. Tryin to make my friends turn their backs on the team we built. buildin up some mistaken information. and I cant take this. lemme spell it out plain for you. angry groups complain about the things we do. im not changing direction, I'm stepping my game up. Maintainin my name, the same way I came up. You're gonna see that I'm not playin. start asking the names that I'm not sayin. but im tryin not to mention the names of people who wanna siphon attention. You like the hype but pretendin you're part of the picture wont pass. You're like a high school dropout, no class. You can say what you want about me. keep talkin while i'm walkin away bitch. You can say what you have to say. cuz my mind's made up anyway. I'm taking the high road going above you. this is the last time that I'm gonna trust you. You can say what you have to say. cuz my mind's made up anyway. all that bullshit you talk might work a lot. but it's not gonna work today. Why does it always have to be. Somebody's always watching me. All I really need is some room to breathe. Is anybody out there listening?. Cuz I cant stand to keep this in. All I really want, I'll say it again. You can say what you have to say. cuz my mind's made up anyway. I'm taking the high road going above you. this is the last time that I'm gonna trust you.

kenji,"Kenji. My father came from Japan in 1905. He was fifteen when he immigrated from Japan. He, he... he worked until he was able to buy this patch. And build a store. Let me tell you the story in the form of a dream,. I don't know why I have to tell it but I know what it means,. Close your eyes, just picture the scene,. As I paint it for you, it was World War II,. When this man named Kenji woke up,. Ken was not a soldier,. He was just a man with a family, who owned a store in LA,. That day, he crawled out of bed like he always did,. Bacon and eggs to wife and kids,. He lived on the second floor of a little store he rent,. He moved to LA from Japan,. They called him 'Immigrant,'. In Japanese, he'd say he was called ""iisei"". That meant 'First Generation in the United States',. When everyone was afraid of the Germans, afraid of the ""Japs"",. But most of all afraid of a homeland attack,. And that morning when Ken went out on the doormat,. His world went black 'cause,. Right there; front page news,. Three weeks before 1942,. ""Pearl Harbor's Been Bombed and the Japs Are Comin',"". Pictures of soldiers dyin' and runnin',. Ken knew what it would lead to,. Just like he guessed, the President said,. the evil Japanese in our home country would be locked away. They gave Ken, a couple of days,. To get his whole life packed in two bags,. Just two bags, couldn't even pack his clothes,. Some folks didn't even have a suitcase, to pack anything in,. So two trash bags was all they gave them,. When the kids asked mum ""Where we goin'?"". Nobody even knew what to say to them,. Ken didn't wanna lie; he said ""The US is lookin' for spies"",. So we have to live in a place called Manzanar,. Where a lot of Japanese people are,"". Stop it don't look at the gunmen,. You don't wanna get the soldiers wonderin',. If you gonna run or not,. 'Cause if you run then you might get shot,. Other than that try not to think about it,. Try not to worry 'bout it bein' so crowded,. Someday we'll get out, someday, someday.. As soon as the war broke out. The F.B.I. came and they just come to the house and. ""You have to come"". ""All the Japanese have to go"". They took Mr. Nii. The people couldn't understand. Why they had to take him because he's just innocent laborer. So now they're in a town with soldiers surroundin' them,. Every day, every night looked down at them,. From watchtowers up on the wall,. Ken couldn't really hate them at all;. They were just doing their job and,. He wasn't gonna make any problems,. He had a little garden with vegetables and fruits that. He gave to the troops in a basket his wife made,. But in the back of his mind, he wanted his families life saved,. Prisoners of war in their own damn country,. What for?. Time passed in the prison town,. He wondered if it live it down when they were free,. The only way out was joinin' the army,. And supposedly, some men went out for the army, signed on,. And ended up flyin' to Japan with a bomb,. That 15 kiloton blast put an end to the war pretty fast,. Two cities were blown to bits; the end of the war came quick,. Ken got out, big hopes of a normal life, with his kids and his wife but. when they got back to their home,. What they saw made them feel so alone,. These people had trashed every room,. Smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors,. Written on the walls and the floor,. ""Japs not welcome anymore."". And Kenji dropped both of his bagson the sides and just stood outside,. He, looked at his wife without words to say,. She looked back at him wiped the tears away,. And, said ""Someday we'll be okay, someday,"". Now the names have been changed, but the story's true,. My family was locked up back in '42,. My family was there it was dark and damp,. And they called it an internment camp. When we first got back from camp... uhh. It was... pretty... pretty bad. I, I remember my husband said. ""Oh we're gonna stay til least"". Then my husband died before they close the camp.. by /babihgott"
move on,"This is not a story that you've heard or you know. Everyone in black from the head to the toe. And I'm sitting in the back in the very last row. Hearing everyone ask why I had to go. Ladies and gentlemen we're gathered here today. To talk about the end in a friend gone away. Talking about pretending they don't know what to say. And they're tripping over words but they're talking anyway. Mingling and singing all these really sad songs. Talking of what I did right and forgetting all my wrongs. Saying how they'll miss me so much now that I'm gone. Man this is depressing. Let's move on. Let's move on. Come back to life like the light of the dawn. It's like a tightrope just move right along. Don't look down and don't step wrong. We don't have time so just move on. Friends from my past wiping tears on their sleeve. In between people that were never close to me. And as I turn my back on everyone to leave. I know that I'll be back to see them all eventually. I've gotta go away just to try something new. Cause what I'm used to isn't all that I can do. Just a change of scenery, just another view. Take it back to the beginning. Take it back to the roots. Let's move on. Come back to life like the light of the dawn. It's like a tightrope just move right along. Don't look down and don't step wrong. We don't have time so just move on. Come back to life like the light of the dawn. It's like a tightrope just move right along. Don't look down and don't step wrong. We don't have time so just move on. Just move on. Just move-"

red to black,"I had a friend named Victor and. The two of us used to hang every single day. And it seemed like overnight that his whole life just changed. I know when his mom and dad broke up it didn't make sense. But I know that his dad was a drunk and he gambled away the rent. Pretty soon Victor was seeing red, pissed off,. But instead he'd drink every night until he passed out and then he'd do it all again. The whole time he was smiling on the outside to cover the pain,. But on the inside all he was just trying to get away. He's dying to get away, let the pain of yesterday go slipping through the cracks. Yo, funny how things change color then fade to another shade when you. Had it made that was all good but now look, just another day.. It was so fresh, it was so clean never saw it go 1-2-3, lights out which way to turn. Can't get a grip, all alone in the big white house. Everything gets worse and you just curse till your head bursts. And it hurts so bad and she left, make yourself should've thought of that one first. No family, no kids, can't accept what you did.. Now you wanna wait, but you can't because the past comes back again. Slippin' through the cracks, sip a little Jack. Could've been half dead. What about rent? Why does every cent gotta be a bet? When's it gonna end?. Oh my God we don't got a penny left.. My mom's gotta find a way to get a job, out of debt, out of Dodge,. Out of breath, out of this big problem. My pop's wanna get away from the pain and the better place in his brain. But the medication he takes makes him wasted so sick. If he's gonna think the good Lord would come take him. I'm shaking him, wake up you son of a bitch.. He's dying to get away,. Let the pain of yesterday go slipping through the cracks. Hiding himself away,. Watching all the memories fade away from red to black. He's dying to get away,. let the pain of yesterday go slipping through the cracks. Hiding himself away,. Watching all the memories fade away from red to black. Slipping through the cracks,. Slipping through the cracks,. Slipping through the cracks."
remember the name,"You ready? Lets go!. Yeah, for those of you that want to know what we're all about. It's like this y'all c'mon. It's just ten percent luck. Twenty percent skill. Fifteen percent concentrated power of will. Five percent pleasure. Fifty percent pain. And a hundred percent reason to remember the name. He doesn't need his name up in lights. He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic. He feels so unlike everybody else, alone. In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him. But fuck em'. He knows the code. It's not about the salary. It's all about reality and makin' some noise. Makin' the story. Makin' sure his clique stays up. That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin' it up. Who the hell is he anyway?. He never really talks much. Never concerned with status but still leavin' them star struck. Humbled through opportunities given to him despite the fact. That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writin raps. Put it together himself, now the picture connects. Never askin for someone's help, to get some respect. He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach. And now when it all unfolds, the skill of an artist. It's just twenty percent skill. Eighty percent fear. Be one hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill. Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames. And I heard him wreckin' with The Crystal Method, Name Of The Game. Came back dropped Megadef, took 'em to church. I'm like 'bleach, man, why you have the stupidest verse?'. This dude is the truth, now everybody be givin' him guest spots. His stock's through the roof I heard he fuckin' with S-Dot!. It's just ten percent luck. Twenty percent skill. Fifteen percent concentrated power of will. Five percent pleasure. Fifty percent pain. And a hundred percent reason to remember the name. They call him Ryu the sick. And he's spittin fire at Mike. Got him out the dryer he's hot. Found him in Fort Minor with Tak. Been a fuckin' annihilist porcupine. He's a prick, he's a cock. The type woman want to be with. And rappers hope he get shot. Eight years in the makin'. Patiently waitin to blow. Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe. He's got a partner in crime his shit is equally dope. You wont believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat. He's not your everyday on the block. He knows how to work with what he's got. Makin' his way to the top. People think its a common owners name. People keep askin him was it given at birth. Or does it stand for an acronym?. No he's livin' proof. Got him rockin' the booth. He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice. Him and his crew are known around as one of the best. Dedicated to what they doin give a hundred percent. Forget Mike. Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard. It seems like he's never got time. Because he writes every note and he writes every line. And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind. It's like a design is written in his head every time. Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme. And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed. Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?. It's just ten percent luck. Twenty percent skill. Fifteen percent concentrated power of will. Five percent pleasure. Fifty percent pain. And a hundred percent reason to remember the name. It's just ten percent luck. Twenty percent skill. Fifteen percent concentrated power of will. Five percent pleasure. Fifty percent pain. And a hundred percent reason to remember the name. Yeah. Fort Minor, Mike Shinoda. Styles of Beyond, Ryu, Takbir. Machine Shop"

Ante up and Im in. Im like Black Jack Johnson and MOP. Drinking handfuls of Jack Daniels (You’ll see). Cause when we hop into the Jeep to try out the CD. You’ll want a low rider bucking bronco to Scoop’s beat now. My name’s Mike (mike), remember it well. More rock than raising hell. Rougher then Roc Deville. Ryu and Tak will tell you whats really the deal. If you want it come get us at the end of this twelve. Celph Titled:. Yea yea yea, you know the fuckin drill. Keeping it Godzilla up in the mother fuckin Home Depot. This is Celph Titled, the lame mile killer. This SOB, this is Demigodz, this is M Shinoda the cobra holder. And this is your brain on crack mother fucka!. Mike:. Perfect…the guy is a genius"

slip out the back,"Slip Out The Back. You know me. I used to get caught up in everyday life. Trying to make it through my day so I could sleep at night. Trying to figure my way through the maze of rights and wrongs. But like you used to say. Nothing feels like it's really worth it. Forget perfect. I'm trying not to be worthless. Since I last saw you I've been looking for a purpose. Well, I met this kid who thought like I did. He had a weird way of looking at it. This is what he said. Slip out the back before they know you were there. And at the worst you'll see nobody cares. Cuz you don't wanna be around when it all goes down. Even heroes know when to be scared. Slip out the back before they know you were there. And at the worst you'll see nobody cares. Cuz you don't wanna be around when it all goes down. Even heroes know when to be scared. Now. I don't remember where I met him or remember his name. But he walked funny like he was just too big for his frame. Just over five foot but he weighed a buck-fifty. And what he said seemed so right. It stuck with me. Listen. It's like poker. You can play your best. But you gotta know when to fold your cards and take a rest. And know when to hold your cards. Hold your breath. And hope that nobody else is stacking the deck. Because. I don't need to tell you that life isn't fair. It doesn't care. It arbitrarily cuts off your air. And like you I want someone to say its okay. In the truest part of our hearts everybody's afraid. We're just underappreciated and overwhelmed. Fighting so hard to hide our fear that we're scaring ourselves. You understand what I'm saying cuz you always did. But it's different in the words of a cowardly kid. Who said slip out the back before they know you were there. At the worst you'll see nobody cares. Cuz you don't wanna be around when it all goes down. Even heroes know when to be scared. Slip out the back before they know you were there. At the worst you'll see nobody cares. Cuz you don't wanna be around when it all goes down. Even heroes know when to be scared. And I'm no hero. You remember how it was. You know. All I ever did was worry. Feeling out of control. To the point where everything is going end over end. I'm spinning around in circles again. This is where you come in. All of this to explain to you why. I had to separate myself away from yesterday's life. Please remember. This isn't how I hoped it would be. But I had to protect you from me. That's why I slipped out the back before you knew I was there. I know you felt unprepared. But every single time I was around I'd just bring you down. And I could tell that it was time to be scared. That's why I slipped out the back before you knew I was there. And I know the way I left. It wasn't fair. I didn't wanna be around just to bring you down. I'm not a hero but don't think I didn't care"

spraypaint and ink pens,"Fort Minor, Minor. Fort Minor, Minor, Minor.... [Chorus]. Uh, spraypaint and ink pens. I use to write in every color I think in. To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in. Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I.... Yes, ladies and gentlemen. We have a special guest for you this evening. Ghost, you ready?. Yo, I verbally paint pictures, I'm the hood's best storyteller. This about a young boy dealing with the older fellas. Promised him the lives you see on TV. He ran packs across town like rhyme CD's. And big chains, new clothes, Nikes and Reeboks. Stacking too much loot to squeeze in a shoe box. Saving, he promised his mom a crib in Atlanta. And his pops got killed through debt, he was a dealer. So he staged jazz, fox jump off the suit cases. No more cross-town, now he's crossing them states and. Seeing new faces, not knowing who to trust. So when the door kicked open they scream ""This is a bust"". ""Is it a set up?"", it seems funny, a scuffle broke out. He got hit, dropped the cases spitting blood out of his mouth. He walked four blocks to die trying to survive. And now all that's left is his mom screaming ""God Why?"". [Chorus]. Uh, spraypaint and ink pens. I use to write in every color I think in. To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in. Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I.... Yeah, yeah, let me begin by saying ""Shut the fuck up!"". Let my begin by saying I don't think this man knew what he had in store. He opened the door and found the bag under the floor. Not a peep, always working a lot, get the flame, aim, pop. Open the box and take off out the back of the pawn shop. Scoping the lot, hoping the cops hadn't seen the plates on his car. He felt like he been hustling so hard like a demon he pumped a cold heart. Play it cool like Humphrey Bogart, put the rings on his chain attached by both parts. He did the drop, one ring in a bag, envelope, all the money he had. Left the money and the ring in a slow exhale. Two weeks went by, got a box in the mail. In the box was a bullet made of gold. Melted down from the ring, recast with two rings and a band. And he stared at it sitting in the palm of his hand. And sat down next to a picture that sat on the nightstand. It was his wife in the picture on his side. With the ring on the finger on the week that she died. As he looked in the reflection, at those eyes so red. He put the bullet in a gun and put it right in his head like that. [Chorus]. Uh, spraypaint and ink pens. I use to write in every color I think in. To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in. Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I.... Uh, yeah, uh. Fiasco!. You know he didn't have enough power in his thrusters to muster Warp 5. Plus if he pushed it, the fuel cells could rupture then they would die. Then the galaxy would suffer but he knew he had to try. But he couldn't risk it, put the cure in the escape pod and kissed it. And told her goodbye, she started to cry, but he knew if he could distract 'em. He could buy her some time and she could make it out alive. Turn the suit around and got prepared for the stand off. Space mind had blew one of the hands off. Damaged laser cannons and he got the system jammed. And he faced the whole fleet, blood seeping through his teeth. The final saga in the seven planet wars. Unsheethed the sword and then he charged forward. His eyes flashed behind the cracked cockpit glass. He let out a laugh and then all she heard was a blast like. [Chorus]. Uh, spraypaint and ink pens. I use to write in every color I think in. To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in. Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I.... Yeah, ladies and gentlemen. This has been a Fort Minor production. Ghostface! Fiasco!. Uh, spraypaint and ink pens. It's an expression coming out of a simple can of paint. Look, it's the easiest way for the average kid to paint things using himself as the meaning of it. You gonna get into the gallery there soon, man. Why? I'm not gonna be famous one day. Why do you always say that?. Cause it's true"

At the drop of the defense, I let loose the venom. Sendin', I try to verbal heat up in ‘em. The ending will come, grab your family and run. Apocalyptic rhyme pattern taking shots from the sun.

strange things,"[Verse 1:]. Everybody up. Let me introduce to you,. a man that herd of who you thought you knew,. give me a couple of seconds just to prove to you,. you never did, but let me give you a chance too,. I use to swear everybody had it in for me. people only wanted to talk to spit on me. so I'd paint pictures, draw alittle bit. and every time I'd was pissed off at some kid. I'd get home draw a little sketch. of any kid i hated with a knife in the neck. a pencil in the eye and a hole in the back,. i had a back pack of six sketches like that,. and over time people started to see. the pictures that i made, made alot of scence to me,. but it never ready made much of a difference,. they still talk shit, but not at close distance,. and that sucked because all I wanted to have. was alittle attention with the good and bad,. but over time I got sick of tryin. and kepth makin them pictures and keptn redrawin lines. [chorus:]. I dont know where im going with this im just reminisin and tellin the story of this. sit back and take in the story of the kid, as i look back at the strange things i did. [Verse 2:]. Everybody up. let me tell the truth to you. i never thought id be anyone you wished you knew,. and just thought id end up a stain on the wall,. something you want to fix because you've seen it all,. anyway back at psi. i had a class with this smart mouth friend of mine,. and we would sit in the back, the two of us combine,. we'd make fun of everybody just to pass the time,. now we did it quietly so no one heard,. a couple of nerds scentence full of pictures and words. until this kid heard we were callin him names and decided to get tough,. i remember he came up to me that day in front of half my friends and talk shit so loud people couldn't pretend they didn't hear him,. sayin he would beat my ass and i laughed. but he was serious and pushed me back,. at this point i was pretty confused,. this little bitch was all ampt so what could i do,. i should have come back at him for all to see,. but instead i just told him that it wasn't me. [Chorus x2]. [Verse 3:]. its like flat liners see that flick,. people dyin, come back saying crazy shit, people that they did wrong come back to attack them. and everyone that they hurt comes back for revenge,. well if that was ever going to happen to me,. I'd petentially would be attacked constently. but then again for all the pain in my pass. there'd be alot of people that had better watch there ass. [chours x2]"
the battle,"Celph:. These hungry rappers battle for a buck and some change. There really be kids starving. give a fuck if it change. Shok rap. Not that. You get signed you might blow up. Realisa ""Party In Iraq"". You might blow up. I see you trying to think a few lines you might get at me with. Slap happy with babies who're born with crack in they cribs. Too much to cram under your oversized fitted. And the public system failed you. Eighter you're ignorator.... . (postado por Këikö)"
the hard way,Come with me let me walk you through the world that I currently stay in. You can take a look around and tell me if I'm mistaken. You can meet and talk to everybody that I live with. Maybe you can tell me why everybody's so distant. Is it me or maybe when I look around daily. I don't even know the people I can put my trust in lately. People that I used to hang with now they're acting so diferent. I'm still the same person why doesn't anybody listen. Can somebody please just explain to me. What happened to the way that we aways said we'd be. Right now I don't know why I pushed through the pain that I got through. And I'm losing hope. Deafening voices that frequency inside my head. That says I'm going at it the hard way. I focus get everything inside out of my brain. That claims I'm going at it the hard way. Come with me let me walk you through the world that I currently live in. Not a things is forgotten not a things forgiven. Nobody can hold their own underneath the weight but. Nobody can take the blame for their own mistakes so. What do you do when somebody lets you down. And you wanna say something but you can't cause they're not around. Inside you think they know the extent of the pain. But they won't even admit that they were the one to blame. Can somebody please just explain to me. What happened to the way that we aways said we'd be. 'Cause right now I don't know why I pushed through the pain that I got through. And I'm losing hope. Gimme one reason not to

Uh oh whatere you yell when you see that door close. Imma bail through the back (fo sho). Straight to the bar so i can act (a fool). I figure you guys would get a little surprised. Youy eyes wide when its me and Mike Shinod. Im just plain old Sixx John from the Nam- District. This is not supposed. I still talk with awkaward speech. Im like a dog that's off his leash.

Seventeen pages in the little magazine i keep. [Mike:]. We got this place rockin' beat knockin non stopping. If ya'll are with it let me hear it now (yeah) yo.

tools of the trade,"[Mike]. I can make a loop out of anything work. I’m just surprised you guys didn’t think of this shit first... But fuck it!. You can’t touch yours truly. You can hardly follow me. Much less move me, so. When I’m pumping the track. You punks in the back better jump when I ask you bastards. [Ryu]. Yeah, you got it backwards and misconstrued. See I roll like the rat pack groups included. In the backpack with the gas mask in Munich. 20 deep in a hatchback puffing Cubans. [Mike]. You wanna rap get the lab track qued let’s do this. But not on this track. You can’t afford it stupid!. [Tak]. Somebody call for the doc quick. He’s still on the street top. He gotta freaking stain on my high top Reebok’s. Snatched off the velcro and choked him with it. My headphones rub my neck where I coach you chickens (baaaacock!). Machineshop packs lots of tunes. Like Paul Wall mixed tapes leave you chopped and screwed. The mess too wild?. The yes boys popping their Gats (yaps?). Yeah, can you hear me now?. Good get off my sac. [Celph]. Yo, MC am I. People call me Celph. I got the key to every young bitches chastity belt. You clicking even pussy. Better yet they beaver. I’m gonna leave it to ya heavy. With this nine millameta. [Girlie Ryu (some would say sexy voice)]. Yo I see you chillin’ in that cherry beemer. Have you ever met a man with canary fever?. I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout a piss colored diamond either, word. I’m eatin’ birds outta sittin’ on your finger. You can teach 'em how to speak. Say “Polly want a cracker?”. Take 'em to the beach. Play volleyball after. A little snack.. champagne and pasta... We don’t gotta run fast girl. I know you got asthma. [Tak]. Yeah, sippin’ on jack and diamonds. Blowing smoke rings. Chillin’ with the pack of Heina’s. Your hands to the sky. Get a crunk for fun. I’m so goddamn high. I could punch the sun. [British Mike]. Oy... honestly I doesn’t even matter if I use this voice. It’d still fuck up you and your boys. So piss off mate. See? I do what I want. Cause your whole bloody lots. Just a bunch of cunts. [Ryu]. See right now Celph Titled supposed to be in the booth. [Tak]. But he’s stuck inside a toilet getting ready to puke. [Mike]. And he drank a bunch of sisco, vodka, and rum. [Tak]. So Cheapshot’s gonna drop Celph’s verse. Here it comes. [Celph Titled]. Find me in the sandwich. Gonna roll with the stutter. Rolling with a cutter. Abuse your mother. On a road trip to Barbados with their hoes. I’m a hoodrat with a Winnebago. I make dough. On the block where the bullies where raised to partier. You in Idaho grazing pastures getting busy. I don’t hold acts unless for something get busy. On the ground I like the bear. And I stay my grizzly. [Ryu in the background]. Stay the fuck in the bathroom homie!"
welcome,"Yeah. Welcome. Yeah it's been a long minute. Let me break it down now. If ya'll still with it. First time I did it, yeah I'll admit it. I kinda hit it and quit it and left ya'll hanging. Singing, kinda off key with a passion. Asking, can I give you back that action?. Yeah I'm a blast in a hashtag fashion. And spell it out for you like a mass closed caption. Get a closed casket, fade to black. This is my spot that I'm taking back. Get at me punk I was made for that. Ya'll don't really even know what you're aiming at. So far back what'cha waving at?. Ya'll can't see the stage that I'm playing at. And ya'll hating that. But that's why I do it. So tell me where the motherfucking haters at. Cause. I don't need their blessing now. I don't need their invitation. Ain't no way to shut me down. Or to take this path I've taken. And maybe I've been left out. But never let this be mistaken. They can keep their blessing now. Forget me now. Cause I was never welcome. Yeah it's been a long road. Never really know how it'd all unfold. I'm just trying hard not to sell my soul. When the rest want guns. And a mouth full of gold. I don't hate 'em, I still love 'em. That's not me, I'm not judging. Not below 'em, not above 'em but. Disrespect me?. Well then fuck 'em. This is that house I'm living in. Ya'll just passing thru visiting. I draw these lines, ya'll fill 'em in. I'm a grown ass man, ya'll are children. No competition I'm killing them. I'm taking 'bout him and him and him. Let's take it out for another spin again. And I don't give a fuck if I win again. Cause. I don't need their blessing now. I don't need their invitation. Ain't no way to shut me down. Or to take this path I've taken. And maybe I've been left out. But never let this be mistaken. They can keep their blessing now. Forget me now. Cause I was never welcome. No (I was never welcome). No, no. No, no, no (I was never welcome). No. No (I was never welcome). No, no. I don't need their blessing now. I don't need their invitation. Ain't no way to shut me down. Or to take this path I've taken. And maybe I've been left out. But never let this be mistaken. They can keep their blessing now. Forget me now. Cause I was never welcome. I was never welcome (no). I was never welcome (no, no). I was never welcome. I was never welcome (no)"
