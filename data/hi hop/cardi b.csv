get up 10,"Look, they gave a bitch two options: strippin' or lose. Used to dance in a club right across from my school. I said ""dance"" not ""fuck"", don't get it confused. Had to set the record straight. 'cause bitches love to assume. Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get at Sue's. Lord only knows how I got in them shoes. I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels. A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food. Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool. Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news. I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views. Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs. Get money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right. Never been no fraud in my mothafuckin' life. Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right. Stunt on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite. Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory. I ain't tellin' ya to do it, I'm just tellin' my story. I don't hang with these bitches. 'cause these bitches be corny. And I got enough bras, ya ain't gotta support me. I went from rag to riches, went from Wic to lit, nigga. Only person in my fam to see six figures. The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders. When you gotta make sure that everybody straight. Bitches stab you in your back. while they smilin' in your face. Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case. I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas. Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas. Said ""I was just tryna chill and make bangers"" (bangers). Tell all these old bitches they in danger (stop). The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (brrt). That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer. You gon' run up on who and do what? (who?). I think y'all got your story screwed up (yeah).

I smack you and the bitch that you act like (yeah). I started gettin' money, bitches upset (cash). They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight. Nails done, hair lit, keep them both laced (laced). Come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face (shine). Headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case. Ain't no bitches spittin' like this since '08. I don't trust no nigga, I don't fear no bitch (fear no bitch). Whole life been through some fucked up shit (fucked up). They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this. When you seen what I've seen, you end up like this (woo). I walked into the label, ""where the check at? "". (where the check?). Cardi B on the charts, ain't expect that. Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? (where?). I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at. They say, I'm too ratchet, they say, I act wild. (I act wild, wild). I'm tryna whip the foreign like a bad ass child. (bad ass child, skrrt). They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now. (try that now). Cardi B, know it's me. Hear that ""blap"" sound (Blap!). Man, I said we gon' win. Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten. Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win. Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten. Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win. Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten. Yeah, but I get up ten. Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten. Bitch (woo).
