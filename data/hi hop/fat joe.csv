I promise to never stray I'm honored everyday. To have a woman like you in the life of Jose (Hey). [Chorus]. [Verse 2: Armageddon]. Yea how I'm supposed to start this.

Touring making dollars assuming that you know that I love you or regardless. I feel its time I showed, you bless you with this ring, now that's. Something to hold you down till a nigga come back. Me and my lady got history this worth she deserves. More then this cold world is giving me to share with her word. And I don't care about nothing else except my girl (my girl). Not myself no one else just my girl (my girl). You bring life to my world you give me strength to go on. And face life even when it seems all holes gone. Labeled my wife but you truly exceed the title. You my future my happiness my heart my idol. I promise girl, that. [Chorus]. [Talking: Fat Joe]. Haha. This is going out to you, you and you and you.

I promise to stay true and give you all of me. Whether he's locked down or on the grind. Or whether is out of work or at work on time. You need to trust that man and respect that man. And you get what you feel you deserve from that man, and. [Tony Sunshine]. Cuz I need somebody who will stand by me. Through the good times and bad times who will always.... always be my girl"

Nigga we from the Bronx, New York... shit happens,. Kids clappin'; love to spark the place,. Half the niggas on the block got a scar on they face,. It's a cold world, and this is ice,. Half a mil' for the charm, nigga this is life.. Got the family in front building on Trinity Ave.. 10 years billed legit they still figure me bad.. As a young, I was too much to cope with.. Why then, mo'fuckers nick-name me, cause I could coat shit.. Cause they caught the big Don on robbery, extorsion or grand larceny.... I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle,. This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble.. Came out the gate, no I didn't flow yo shit.. Fat nigga with shorty and the logo kicks.. [Chorus]. See my niggas don't dance,. See we just pull up the pants and,. Do the Roc-a-way.. Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.. I said my niggas don't dance,. See we just pull up the pants and,. Do the Roc-a-way..

And I just bought a bike so I can ride til' I die,. With a matchin' jacket,. Bout' to cop me a mansion,. My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'.. We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies,. So nevermind how we got here with the burlies and hoodies.. Listen we don't pay admission,. And bouncers don't check us,. And we walk around the metal detectors.. And there really ain't a need for a Vip section in the middle of the dance floor,. The regulars check it, said it?!. Like my necklace, started relaxin' now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction.. See, money ain't a thing nigga, we still the same nigga, flows just changed nigga.. And now we 'bout to change the game nigga.. [Chorus]. See my niggas don't dance,. See we just pull up the pants and,. Do the Roc-a-way.. Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back..

Gucci sweater now,. In that G4 we fly through,. Heny wether now,. See niggas get tight, when you worth some millions.. That's why I sport the cincilla to hurt they feelin's.. Your can find Joe Crack at all type of shit,. Out at Vegas front roll out on all the fights and shit,. If I visited Compton, they'd prolly squeel.. Cause have the rappers there blow like derek foreal.. If you cross the line damn right, I'm gon' hurt you,. These faggot niggas even made gang size commercials.. Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up,. B2k crip walkin' like that's what's up.. Can't keep tellin' me about all this rucker,. Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the rucker,. Not even Pee-Wee Herman could imagine this,. My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship.. [Chorus]. See my niggas don't dance,. See we just pull up the pants and,. Do the Roc-a-way.... Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.. I said my niggas don't dance,. See we just pull up the pants and,. Do the Roc-a-way.... Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back"

flow joe,"[Fat Joe]. Ahhhhhhh yeah!. Da Fat Gangsta. Chorus: repeat 2X. You gotta flow Joe, you gotta flow Joe. You gotta gotta gotta gotta let em know Joe. [Fat Joe]. Bust it, check it, watch how I wreck it. Niggaz watch your back, shit is gettin hectic. I catch vibes like Count Basie, sucker won't face me. I'm so much flavor you can taste me. I'm underground like a gutter. You never catch me - stutter, everybody knows that I'm butter. I'm not the man with sensitivity. The name is Fat Joe, the label's Relativity, huh. I chop a rapper like a meat cleaver. I'm burnin hot, people think I have a fever, check it. If niggaz wanna front, then come widdit. If you're havin second thoughts, well then forget it, see. I dig in my crates, I don't per-pa-trates. I got shit sewn, like Billy Bathgate. Beware like Cocoa, yo I'm not a slow boat. Got so much dough I va-cate in Acapulco. Crazy as they come I'm not the one, we can do this. with the hands, or take it to the guns... You know I can flow, the name is Fat Joe. I can flow, I can flow, I can flow. Chorus. [Fat Joe]. Yeah, yeah. Everybody knows Fat Joe's in town. Nuff respect for the Boogie Down. I'm livin in the Bronx on an Ave called Trinity. My name rings bells, within the vicinity. Peace to the money makers always plottin mono. Together we gettin dough, just like Lucky Luciano. People always tell me, yo you're dope Joe. But I'm not a car, so I don't get gassed like Amoco. Never ate the paint, no I'm not a sucker. Never liked ? so to Hell with the ?rucker?. Always on my own never sweatin nobody. Warm up a crowd like a bottle of Bacardi. I can kick it this way, I can kick it thattaway. I kick a funky style, from New York to Pasquetaway. Suckers best scram. Now in ninety-three it's all about the Fat Man. Peace to Finesse, Showbiz and A.G.. Gizmo, Little Hec', and Kool Micskit (say what?). My crew from Uptown. And if you mess around, then you'll catch a beatdown. See I got this in a smash. If a rapper steps up, he'll get smoked. like a blunt full of hash. My style of rap is legendary. Fuck with the man, then you'll end up in the cemetary. And that's word to Ma Duke. I never fake moves, I'll go out like a troop. So act like you know, the name is Fat Joe. I can flow, I can flow, I can flow. Chorus. [Fat Joe]. Yeah. See I rip the mic if you put me to a test. Troop it gets so bad, I make you wanna wear a vest. Cause I'm too hot to handle. Knockin niggaz out like ?Livingston Bramble?. Rappers come heavy, but yo I weigh a ton. I won't lose weight cause I'm not on the run. I'm on point like a sniper, hyper than the hyper. On the DL, overlooked by C-Cypher. Never get caught, I'm on top with my game. Flip a fat ride, there's no need for a train. Rappers come close, but they just can't make it. When it comes to the funk, you know I won't fake it. Peace to Serge, and my right hand Flex. And when I grab the mic nobody wants to rock next. The name is Fat Joe, cause Joe is livin Fat. Niggaz gettin jealous cause I got a contract. But I don't sweat it, I know the style is raw. You can't compare me to a cornball. And you know I kick game like a hottie. Now in ninety-three, they should free John Gotti. If you step, battle and I'm gonna mash your toes. You know I got the flow."
gangsta,"[Intro: Fat Joe]. Ollie ollie oxen free!. Like one, two, three. Red light, green light, one, two, three. Yo I pop six boxes, play some scalezes. Pitch the ball I'ma smack that shit. Yeah, ohhhhhh, going.. going. Yeah yeah what up son?. Yo I got this twenty two nigga play me like... Nah, I ain't got no bullets. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Top two for five, three for five, we rollin!. [Fat Joe]. Now I'm in too deep. Only sixteen already hold a name in the street. Makin the fifth scream, rockin older niggas to sleep. Make a fiend strip naked cuz he owed for a week. Now the Squad's getting recognized, supplyin connects with pies. Pumpin pounds of weight, nigga like exercise. Joe been over quarter five dope and homicide. Long before Charlie got knocked, until Madonna died. Young and not givin a fuck. There ain't a nigga I ain't hit when I buck and left 'em shit outta luck. I'ma gangsta like my daddy was, hittin number spots. Sendin me to my room while he was puffin pot. Still I use to peak from the door, couldn't believe what I saw. Stacks of money on the bed and the floor. It wasn't long til I did what he did. I was an innocent kid and got exposed to the life that he lived. I went from grams into O's, pounds to bricks. On the strip pimpin hoes on some goldie shit. I'ma gangsta by destiny, OG's selected me. I earned my spot, my whole team elected me. [Chorus: children singing]. Gangsta, gangsta. I wanna be a gangsta. My daddy was a gangsta. Gangsta, gangsta. I wanna be a gangsta. My daddy was a gangsta. [Fat Joe]. Yeah, unh, yo, unh. Here goes this chick doing ten in the bing. But 'less we rhyme time we see her do it again. She started out fuckin dudes that resembled her father. Mom knew shoulda schooled her but the bitch didn't bother. You couldn't blame her cuz she got it from her. She was a rider from jump, her pop's died in the hands of a chump. Now she's mad at the world, no more daddy's little girl. Now she's rockin bandanas, no more Shirley Temple girl. Now she be runnin wit some scramblers that be down in Alabama. Packin twin hammers, screamin ""Life doesn't matter"". It's a vicious cycle, her game is pretending to like you. Thinkin you getting head but she's just duckin so they can snipe you. Movin from state to state, runnin everything from guns to trains. and pushing packs from eight to eight. You know I can't say her name but she was a looker. Pretty thing, such a shame how this life has took her. Now she's raising hell in the cell, no more his are hollering. You might suffer the same fate if you repeat the following... Sell drugs, use drugs, get caught up in the mix. End up locked up or dead in a casket, that's it."

Live for the minute or be out for the day. Hop the metal while lookin hot in stilettos. Gotta rock with a bezzle on the trigger finger. Boss bitch of the ghetto, my Spanish Trina. Talk shit to a nigga with the 'blama beamed up. When I see her gotta handle my bui-nah. I gotta give her one of these in the back of the team truck. [Hook]. [Rick Ross:]. 305 in my yayo.

Freak that girl like you tryna have a baby cuz. Everybody's out to fuck tonight. The fine women, they out to fuck tonight. My niggas, they down to fuck tonight. Ladies, fellas, the won't stop players. [Fat Joe]. Came through the door, seen it before. Hands touchin' the ceiling, booty streakin' the floor. You ever felt good to the point you so sure that. All the attention in the club is yours. Got your hair done up, shades Christian Dior. Leave us, trade a little happy on your Vickey draws. Gettin' your dance on hard, who could wish for more. And your crew's all but know it's a horse. Got the Don all warm and it ain't the Hen'. Feelin' like the Don woman, you could wrestle her chin. Shorty, come a little closer while the record spin. I wanna freak a little longer, can they play it again. [Repeat 1]. Yo, got my mind on my money, money on my mind. And to let you know, you just as good as gold. It's like we got our own little private party goin' on. And the scene just changed into shores of San Juan. It's so intimate, we so into it. Such a tender thing, but fuck I'm innocent. Grindin' so hard you gotta know what I'm thinkin'. Laughin' cuz I'mma kidnap you for the weekend. Now we at the pad about to crack a case. Playin' the couch like Ceasar's, she feedin' me grapes. Not for nuttin' hon, the sex is great. But you know you got to go, I got checks to chase... next. [Repeat 1]. [Ginuwine]. If you're wit' it grab your friends, follow Joe and me. Cuz it's on, it's on. Went in and got the Cris' and a pound of weed. It's on, it's on. [Fat Joe]. Now mami, let's get serious, cuz by the looks of it. It seems your sexuality is just a little curious. You got a friend, we could gather then split. If not, I got a girl for every girl I get. There's a drop in the lot and it whip so fast. We hit the swiss hotel before you finish your glass. And you know you wanna be where the cake is at. Where the pockets just like calories, extra fat. Mami, your body like Malery on Natural Born Killer. She like, they got money but ya'll are more realer. She wanna roll wit' us, pretty much to crit' us. No beatin' around the bush, just beatin' it 'till you bit us"
livin' fat,"Yeah!. Check it out, check-a-check-a, check it out. Would you believe that Fat Joe would flip a style like this?. I can't get played, cause I roll with Baby Chris, nevertheless. niggaz be tryin to front the role. When everybody knows, I'm gonna go gold. at least, kickin the funky styles that you wanna hear. Joe is bigger and better, so have no fear. I'll be rippin the mic, clockin dough, stickin the hoes. After every single show, you know (know). One of the best to grab the mic so don't try to front. Ain't nuttin here yours, so what the fuck you want?. When I step on stage, I'm second to none. Makin MC's run, without the use of a gun, yeah. Talkin about the way I rock a party. Niggaz must be thinkin that I'm high, or drunk on Bacardi. I be hippin and hoppin, rockin and shockin, the whole rap scene. I'm mean, my favorite color is green. I guess that's why they call it the blues. Your money you lose, cause you choose to disrespect and neglect. the skills of the Fat one, but I'm all that son.

While I be rippin the microphone and all my records are hits. The name is Fat Joe, I'm on the down low. I chill with Lord Finesse, you know I got the flow. I be freakin the funk, not fakin the funk, you're facin a punk, yeah. Fuck around and you'll be layin in ?v-ducts?. I got props, believe it or not.

Brooklyn in the house and Uptown is too. I gotta be sayin peace, to the Boogie the Bronx crew. Pete, Sap, Brim, Vayo Mack, Gizmo, Nicer, B.G., my main man Crack. So now you know the flav, and you know the time. Brothers always be tellin me, ""Joe why don't you kick a Fat rhyme"". So I don't front on my peeps. Kick a verse or two, then be out, and peace G.

But I keep drivin in my jet black Beamer. I'm not a daydreamer, but I'm known as a scheamer. I'm dead-ass, when it comes to this. And if you fuck around, your moms'll reminisce. Thinkin of the good times she spent with her son. Somebody shoulda told you that I wasn't the one. Yes I'm known to get nuff respect. and if you face Fat Joe, well then you face your death. Now in ninety-three, it's time to take a stand. And you know how I'm livin, I'm a bad, bad, man. Niggaz know the flav. ""I'm a bad, bad, man!"" (cut and scratched 2X). Check it.

Cause here I am and I'm ready to blast *gunshot*. The cops must have missed, takin me for a bitch. Because they tried to gas me, and make me turn snitch. But I'm not the one for peace.

And if she died her tombstone would read. The world's greatest mother. August nineteenth she birthed me. I came out. Put her through hell but still in all she couldn't help but smile. I resemble my mama to be truthful. And I ain't got to describe her. You know she beautiful. Shit, I always love my mama. Blow holes through a Nigga if he touch my mama. You did whatever it took to keep the supper hot. And I remember when you worked at the number spot. Once the cops caught you I skipped school. Yeah I guess the cops was cool. They let me feed you. I cryed for hours till they finally freed you. Drop to my knees and screamed Mama we need you. Then you went back to school and got a job that's legal. Maria. [Chorus]. Yeah Mami, I love you so much. For this pain, this love, you've been through so much,. And I thank you for everything you done for us. You've been a survivor and we love you so much. I had to dedicate this song to you Mami. I had to tell the world how much I love you. [2nd Verse]. Ay yo, yo yo. I never forget the night that changed out life. A neighbor was screaming Maria come out side. Something's wrong with your son I think he's getting high. Then you replied not my son he don't be getting high. Then you bathed him and tucked him to sleep. Yeah I knew from that day life wouldn't be sweet. He got in trouble with the law. Then you bailed him out. I got in trouble with the law then you bailed me out. It was one July the fourth. They tried to take me out. Shot me right in front of my mother. By Tracy's house. Now its time to change my life I think Rap's the answer. Same day I got signed you was diagnosed with Cancer. Doctor said it'd be a miracle if you survived. Then you looked in my eyes and said. Joey I don't want to die. I pray to god that he show us a sign. Now its fourteen years later and you still alive. Thank you God. [Chorus]. [3rd Verse]. God I thank you so much. My Mother has so much to see. So much to do. She's had such a painful life. Many nights I argue with you in my prayers but I know you're the boss. You kept her alive for a reason. Mama I'm a ride for you. I swear. Yo, I bet you proud of your son. He's a rap star now. Took you out of them projects and bought you that house. Got you that housekeeper to manicure the grounds. And I bought you that car that breaks the barrier of sound. You take care of Joey and I love you for that. And you raising John John and we love you for that. I guess Lisa was an Angel. God wanted her back. Damn I really miss my sister. Guess she's better where she's at. Mammy I love you. I want the world to know I love you. And every chance I get I'm a kiss you and hug you. Life wasn't easy everyday is a struggle. But like my niggaz from Chi town say. It's all bubbles. [Chorus]. Hoping my real mo'fuckers know. This be the realest shit I ever wrote. It's that shit right here. Took me like ten years to do. You know I cried doing this song. Man, so much pain. Mami you such a good woman. You a classy woman. I know you a private person. You don't want the world to know all your business. But I had to let them know how strong you are. I love you so much. This song is also dedicated to little Maria. One of my best friends on earth. Get your shit together girl I love you too. Juju what's up, you my nephew I love you for life. It's Crack bitch"

born in the ghetto,"Yeah,. It's time, baby. It's time to speak the truth, maturity. Huh, niggas gotta evolve to let niggas know the real. Ya call yourself real, ya gotta start speaking about the real. This is Joe Crack The Don, and this is what i'm bringin' to you. uh, yo. nowadays, I'm flirtin with uncertain death. Lord I gotta be dying,. coz after all this crying, how much more hurtin's left?. When will the pain stop?. This depression and anxiety. is gonna make me show another side of me. My niggas ride with me coz I'm the truth. There's benefits to rolling with this clique,. don't nobody fuck with you. Still they label me a tyrant and a backstabber. but study the facts of Crack, the shit don't add up. I'm bringin opportunity to my community. Probably the only rapper that cares. but still you out to ruin me. Who you foolin B? I'm for unity. Latins and Blacks, could you fathom the strength. we have of the two are attached. Born together, roaded in life. These uncle charm polititions ain't holdin us right. How could the same nigga be 20 years in office. when it's clear the only thing that's rising is unemployment,. abortion, little kids having kids. the school system is failing us, now ain't that some shit?. While the rich keep gettin richer, the poor keep dying young,. I can't hide it no more, the time has come. (chorus). I was born in the ghetto,. trembling, try'na stay alive. Coz when you're born in the ghetto,. No-one seems to hear you cry. Brown skin, you know I love my bro-o-own skin. Everyday I'm confronted with racism. These motherfuckin coppers. wanna bag us and have us shackled up in state prisons. After all the taxes I pay,. you would think when they stop us. they would have something nicer to say. than ""GET THE FUCK OUT THE CAR!. WHERE THE DRUGS AT?. ALL THE JEWELRY YOU'RE WEARING,. WHERE THE FUCKIN GUNS AT?"". Once they search the car clean and find nothin,. the same crooked cops try to act like they know us or something. Laughin, tellin jokes by the thousands. 2 seconds ago they tried to send us to the mountains. Leave my son without a father, my wife without a husband. the more I think about it, man it's just disgusting. Stii=ll, we live amongst them, everybody wants out. That's why we rap like we got silver spoons in our mouth. Like we ain't grow up on welfare. Nigga don't even go there, you probably wore Pro-Plares!. We need to educate the youth,. tell the seeds the truth. Too much to share, the bare minimum will exceed the proof. (chorus). I was born in the ghetto,. trembling, try'na stay alive. Coz when you're born in the ghetto,. No-one seems to hear you cry. Ooh, yeah. So much pain. Tryin hard to stay alive, stay alive. Out in these streets, oooh. Man sometimes in can get so tough. Oh yes, yes it can. Yes it can, yeah. It can get so hard, so hard, so hard. . ."

Let a shot go Nigga. Squeeze and Pop. Let 'em feel it when the baseline drops. And all bitches throw your hands up. You in the club with your girls. Call your man up. Cause you ain't comin' home Mami. Breathe and stop. Exhale when the baseline drop. [1st Verse]. Ay yo its murder on the streets. Killa capitol. I'm blasting you. For the love of this doe.

Call it a killers exhibition. Let the body hang. A real work of art. Show your heart. I'll blow your smarts. Yeah It's the ghetto god. Rep the Bronx till I'm gone. Was sent to prison. You know me homey the chromey's itchin'. Leave you holy if you rollin' with some bad intentions. Fit the pussy. Then again you know that. And we don't ever see them in the hood. And they all rats. Joey don't give a fuck. Tell my nigga hold that. Usually found in the kitchen. Where the stove at. Got that weed, got that coke. Get them dope sacks. My little man pitchin'. Yeah we call him Sandy Cossacks. [Chorus]. [2nd Verse]. Lord of war. You need a hammer. I'll sell you guns. Sell coke to Pablo. Sell grammar to pun. Stop searching niggaz. I am the one. Pepper spray gangsta's. Show you how the iron is slung. Now I could play like Kanye and let me chest hairs show. Put on them Kool Moe Dee glasses. But that just ain't Joe. Play shots and then I switch up the flow. Like what the blood clot, Boomba clot. You ain't fuckin wit Joe. Now Mamma love me. Her friend hates me. Jealous cause they boyfriends ain't me. We getting at baby love. Yeah we pain free. Ain't nobody's pockets certain, here. We paid G's. Now listen up. You in love with a stripper. I fuck her and dis her. I give her that mayo. You come and you kiss her. Nigga, Crack been a G ever since. Sit back and watch the money get bricks. Mo' fucker. [Chorus]"

Always been no peace so I never like to ball in. But I maintain and keep a grip on the mic. And say a punchline that'll get the crowd hyped, RIGHT. I never could determine who's the best. It was either KRS or that nigga Lord Finesse. But now I maintain that's with my own career. Joe gettin gold dough or somethin wrong in here. Cause everybody knows I got the skills to pay the bills. Plus I got the flow cause you know +The *Hit is Real+. What? Top notch, I give you nuttin but the raw talent. But don't fake jax and make me have to get violent. You wouldn't like it when I flip the script. Cause when I flip the script, my glock can have an empty clip. Yeah, straight from the Ave of Trinity. I hate it when a juvenile tries to prove his masculinity. I got the whole vicinity locked down. Police hate it, look what they done to Tupac now. You make me wanna blast or somethin. But for now I keep infiltratin these crews that be frontin. And all these other MC's be hatin it. Because the Bronx keeps creatin it, rock on.

Ninety-three, was the year that I debuted it. Representin, for all my niggaz gettin booted. Now who is the number one +Boricua on the Set+?. When in San Fran' I go check Sway and Tech. Otherwise I live the real live back in the BX. Known for transformin on rappers like I'm Jesus. You didn't know I order hits and what not?. Don't make me have to let the dogs loose. and hear the two-per shot, BOO-YA. Ain't it funny how nobody really cares. One minute you're here, the next minute you're under there. Word to Christ, I put out your lights. Every stripe's precise, K.O.'s in all fights. Fatal like Joe with this murderous flow. The Bronx keeps creatin it, you know how that go, peace. ""Bronx keeps creating it.."" -> KRS-One {cut and scratched}. [Fat Joe] The bigger nigga from the Bronx, Fat Joe, yeah!."
bronx tale,"Intro: KRS-One. Music please. Yes, welcome to Jealous One's Envy. We'd like to thank you in advance for purchasing this product. It is a Relativity Records product, artist Fat Joe. My name is KRS-One. And of course we're gonna bring THE noise. Cause we can never be toys. Verse One: KRS-One, Fat Joe. Yes I am the ultimate, uttering ultimatum's for the fun of it. It appears to me you don't know who you fuckin with. You can't see this with bifocals cause you're local. Can't hang with my vocals, better you fuck with Sonny Bono. Or Yoko Ono, but KRS oh NO NO. You might think you a ROTC but I don't give a fuck though. I'm rolling hard like God for the squad black. Packin them poppers bitch, where that money be at?. Aiyyo I be the show stopper, as I shine like gold. Other rappers dull like copper, the certified fake nigga dropper. Which borough, is the thorough. I know, do you know, let me know I'm sayin though. The coke connector, sweating leather with reflectors. Don't get caught up in my sector, or I'ma haveta inject ya. with a slab of this lyrical dope shit. Fake MC's and wannabe's best to quote this. Fat Joe the true and living will prevail. Kingpin like Sonny up in Bronx Tale. Will I fail? I doubt it. I'm the nigga catchin bodies, while other niggaz fantasize about it. True indeed, behind my back MC's claim they can serve me. In my face they screaming ""We're not worthy!"". Youse a has been, actually you ain't been. I be touring, while you be home taping. So what punk, you could battle in a second. Frankly the bottom line, is where's your hit record. You claim I'm jocking, claim I'm on your dick, where's your witnesses?. If I'm on your dick my name has got to be syphillis. Chorus:. ""If you're feeling lucky duck, then press your luck"" - Jeru. ""Up up up and away cuz I don't play clown"" - Kool G Rap. ""If you're feeling lucky duck, then press your luck"" - Jeru. ""Buck buck buck take that witcha on the way down"" - Kool G Rap. Verse Two: Fat Joe. As we proceed to lock it down, don't get it fucked up. We be the kings of the Boogie Down. All we do is spark izm and get cash. Tortuing MC's like that warden up in Alcatraz (bo! bo! bo! bo!). It's Fat Joe, yo you know my steelo. Get so much love, I'm payin sixteen on a kilo. Sendin niggaz outta town, still got control of the Boogie Down. Now how the fuck you sound? (Yeahhh). Ain't no army that could harm me or bomb me. c'mon G you clowns ain't got a fucking thing on me. I'm flashy like white linen (tell em). Your rap is under pressure like two outs tied score in the ninth inning. I'm down with Kris and ain't no stopping me. I'm out for Bronx and Monopoly with chicks on top of me. It's My Philosophy, but for now it's in the corridor. Slappin caps like a ball hittin hard to my laborator. These motherfuckers don't want it. (Word to mother Joe, these niggaz don't want it!). Chorus. Verse Three: KRS-One. Merrrcy, you wanna serve me but you ain't worthy. My style is too curvy, what you tellin me. But your flimsy ass will go home after the battle and find I'm your boss. With KRS-One up in your memory. I know your kind, you rap write. You're Mr. John Gotti the Don, but you're just another bwotty mon. Telecro bwotty mon, how you collect. Rap magazine dating back to, Tougher than Leather. The only reason you got, such an extensive rap collection. Cuz most of your rap mags are all stuck together. Watch what you sayin, watch what you say. When your skull gets cracked, whatcha gonna say crackhead?. Your file is dead, kneel to the rap God in bed. Fore I slap you way Back in the Dayz like Ahmad. Don't get me fed up, or vexed up, cuz you'll get set up. My crew don't let up, I be dead up in this piece (tell em). Recognize it's BlastMaster KRS-One."
bust at you,"(feat. Scarface, Baby). [Talking]. Excuse me while I sing to you. I'm being real and that's the thing to do. I'm just living and loving. Smoking and fucking (Yeah uh). Out here on the grind, yeah (Alchemist this beat is stupid dope fresh). If I can't get no love then I can touch you. (Shit is fly, throw back ya heard me). [Chorus]. I'd rather touch you, yeah. (We ridin' on these niggas come on). 'Stead I'd rather bust at you (Yeah, Terror Squad). I'd rather touch you, yeah (It's goin' down my niggas). (Stunna, Face, Joe Crack the Don). 'Stead I'd rather bust at you. [Fat Joe]. You motherfuckers must be crazy. I been doin' this shit since the eighties. Run up in yo crib, snatch ya baby baby-baby. It's the kid still holdin' the crown. Now that they give it I'm holdin' a pound. And I'm lookin' for some bustas who be actin' like them niggas do dirt. Come to find out they ain't put in no work. An now my feelings is hurt. Cause they decided that they wanted to murk. But I'ma chase 'em to the end of the Earth. Cause I'm a motherfuckin' rider. You can see the pain in my face. Got no problem exchangin' the hate. They got me fightin' a case. And if I blow will I face a fifteen. And I'll probably do it all in the pen. But yo I'm livin' with it. Death before dishonor for my niggas that ride. A thousand deaths if ya sellin' ya pride ha ha ha. Death before dishonor for my niggas that ride. A thousand deaths if ya sellin' ya pride. You motherfuckers need to know that. [Chorus]. I'd rather touch you, yeah. 'Stead I'd rather bust at you. I'd rather touch you, yeah. 'Stead I'd rather bust at you. [Baby]. Hey Joe. We gon' ball like dogs but keep it gangsta nigga. I'm a guerilla on the streets but it's time for the fun time. Out of line, I bust with my tech nine. Choose ya loose, I give ya the blues. Ol' pussy ass nigga with his pussy ass crews. It's the murder man mack, I stash in the Lac. I bought my bricks from these dro back stacks. It's the Birdman baby come and holla at me later. Duck ass niggas, we deal with 'em later. First you, go to the mall and you ball like a dog. And we drop the car, then holla at ya boy. Tell them pussy ass niggas, break bread with the boy. Joe, they breakin' bread with the boy. Tell Big Pun nigga, Stunna ride for the boy. Win or lose I ride for my boy. It's the B-M gangsta, the D-Boy Click. We mash on bustas and we flip these bricks nigga. [Chorus]. I'd rather touch you, yeah. 'Stead I'd rather bust at you. I'd rather touch you, yeah. 'Stead I'd rather bust at you. [Scarface]. Niggas tell me money talk. But bullshit is walkin' out on four feet. That's why I'm ridin' on ya whole street. I'll be a nigga till it's said and done. I'm from a section where ya fight till ya die cause ya never run. I keep my forty cal cocked cause these niggas on my block bang. Right up the street from where the cops hang. And in my head I hear Pac sang. And then them rushin' memories make me cry till I can't stop man. Tell my mama I'm a killer if I happen to die. That's how I lived, ain't no sense in me lyin'. My whole life's filled with danger. Never been a stranger to homicide. My neighborhood's full of gangstas and drive-bys. And niggas fightin' for position. The demon has risen from out of prison. Now I'm losin' my religion. That's how I'm feeling when I'm fuckin' with you. Cause I don't fuck with you, now I'm bustin' at you. So fuck you dude. [Chorus]. I'd rather touch you, yeah (Terror Squad, Facemob uh). 'Stead I'd rather bust at you (Cash Money Millionaires uh come on). I'd rather touch you, yeah (My tech, my mack). 'Stead I'd rather bust at you (Lick my uzi straight like that). I'd rather touch you, yeah (My tech, my mack). 'Stead I'd rather bust at you (Lick my uzi straight like that). [Scarface talking]. Dedicated to my homeboy Pac. Love daddy. Facemob in the house. Fat Joe and it don't stop."
c2g,"Its the illness going on. Yo Shatek hit me. Y-Young. Youngn' Restless. Joe Crack. Strong Armin', T.S. Patterson, B-X. Hold UP!. [Chorus]. Boy, look what you done started now. Ain't no stopping this or calming it down. Don't let me catch one of you fools out of pound. Heart is cold, be in war from the motherfucking cradle to the grave. Man, look what you done started now. Ain't no stopping this or calming it down. Don't let me catch one of you fools out of pound. Heart is cold, be in war from the motherfucking cradle to the grave. [Verse 1]. Cowards en traced all this anger and hatred. Gon' make me damage abrasion my attitude is very impatient. Nigga crossed me, first thing I wanna do is erase him. Yea he used to be my dog, but fuck a relation. Once he get money and fame, everybody starts aging. Shit ain't no longer the same, your own niggaz be hatin'. Can't see another brother succeed. So you backstab 'em just to see how long he'll bleed. But I'm a strong man, pops always told me never fear no man. That's why I'm scarred up on both hands. And never love a bitch, hell naw I can't trust a bitch. Fuck 'em and leave 'em, that's the way you thug a bitch. It's how a nigga was raised, with a heart full of rage. And I'm just too stuck in my ways (You hear me?). Its how a nigga was raised, with a heart full of rage. And I'm just too stuck in my ways (So fuck y'all). [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. Dog I came here to prove your wackness. Bunch of useless bastards always frontin', moving backwards. This is hardcore, ain't no acoustic classic. Nigga swift for anything reserving using a ratchet. Competition stand 'em in line, cause without permission. I'm handling mine, occupation scramble and grind. Stop your facing, shank you with knives. You're missing a born soldier, operation declined. I'm like a optician, with a vision to shine. A hundred steps ahead of y'all, ain't no getting behind. Say what I choose 'cause I done payed my dues. Came from an error of pain and terror, alot of rainy weather. I learned to survive through the hatred and lies. That's why from far away, I can spot a snake in disguise. And believe me dog we ain't scared, hope you came prepared. Straight Strong-Armin, nigga we don't play fair. [Chorus]. [Verse 3 - Fat Joe]. B-X, T.S. Ya heard me?. Youngn' Rest. Uh, yo, yo. Gear up, you need to fear us. One false move and get paw-pierced up. Drinking like one high loop, man I bang you in the club. Drain the henny out your stomach and replace it with blood. You wish us to hell 'cause we too real. Selling two mills and still ain't afraid to pull steal. Ready Rock ain't concerned with y'all. I'm too big too strong for y'all. And I came too long for y'all, ya heard Pun. Takes years to earn a pair of Terror Squad balls. Heard you niggaz want it with us, a fatal mistake. Been blazing the game since niggaz fourth-aides. Crack is king, man the city is mine. And I ain't got no problem with bidding with +Shyne+. Here's the real deal homie, stakes is high. Look at the mirror man I bet you hate your life (Mu'fucker).

crush tonight,"(feat. Ginuwine). [1 - Ginuwine]. Baby, if you wit' it, just clap yo' hands. Stop playin' girl, back that ass up and. Spend that cash dog, drink the Henny and. Freak that girl like you tryna have a baby cuz. Everybody's out to fuck tonight. The fine women, they out to fuck tonight. My niggas, they down to fuck tonight. Ladies, fellas, the won't stop players. [Fat Joe]. Came through the door, seen it before. Hands touchin' the ceiling, booty streakin' the floor. You ever felt good to the point you so sure that. All the attention in the club is yours. Got your hair done up, shades Christian Dior. Leave us, trade a little happy on your Vickey draws. Gettin' your dance on hard, who could wish for more. And your crew's all but know it's a horse. Got the Don all warm and it ain't the Hen'. Feelin' like the Don woman, you could wrestle her chin. Shorty, come a little closer while the record spin. I wanna freak a little longer, can they play it again. [Repeat 1]. Yo, got my mind on my money, money on my mind. And to let you know, you just as good as gold. It's like we got our own little private party goin' on. And the scene just changed into shores of San Juan. It's so intimate, we so into it. Such a tender thing, but fuck I'm innocent. Grindin' so hard you gotta know what I'm thinkin'. Laughin' cuz I'mma kidnap you for the weekend. Now we at the pad about to crack a case. Playin' the couch like Ceasar's, she feedin' me grapes. Not for nuttin' hon, the sex is great. But you know you got to go, I got checks to chase... next. [Repeat 1]. [Ginuwine]. If you're wit' it grab your friends, follow Joe and me. Cuz it's on, it's on. Went in and got the Cris' and a pound of weed. It's on, it's on. [Fat Joe]. Now mami, let's get serious, cuz by the looks of it. It seems your sexuality is just a little curious. You got a friend, we could gather then split. If not, I got a girl for every girl I get. There's a drop in the lot and it whip so fast. We hit the swiss hotel before you finish your glass. And you know you wanna be where the cake is at. Where the pockets just like calories, extra fat. Mami, your body like Malery on Natural Born Killer. She like, they got money but ya'll are more realer. She wanna roll wit' us, pretty much to crit' us. No beatin' around the bush, just beatin' it 'till you bit us"
da fat gangsta,"[Fat Joe]. Yeah.. uh-huh... Chill.. hah, yeah... C'mon... I'm comin rougher than the roughest motherfucker could get. Playin Russian Roulette, never lost a bet yet. Bluffin, ain't my style, niggaz ain't sayin nothin. Cause I'm buckwild without frontin. Raw to the core, I grew up poor. Once I hit the door, I began to explore. Curiosity killed my cat, but not me. because I learned how to kill with agility. I grew up in the South Bronx, punch you in your mouth punk. I know these streets like Fred Sanford knows junk. In the trunk of a car lays a body. Head decapitated, bust him with my shotty. Stabbed the mug, to make sure, he wasn't comin back. Now police, can picture that, with a Kodak.. huh!. They can't stop me with a homicide investigation. Cause if they do my crew is hittin up the station. Your best bet, is to let me jet. Cause I bring war, like a vet, when I'm upset.. huh!. I'm not the one you wanna play out in a program. Yo, you better tell them who the hell I am. ""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Yeah! (2X). ""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Tell em who the hell I am. ""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"". [Fat Joe]. Now on the hip-hop tip, I'm no joke. Get live at a jam, and leave a system broke when I spoke. MC's froze, but I never said freeze. Hopin I don't hit em like a fucked up disease. Fall up in the club, Mr. Hype for a night. Choke a rapper with a cord, hang him from the lights.. huh!. Now you do wanna mess around with the Fat Man. cause you see my face in every newsstand. Every other magazine from Billboard to Spin. Pick it up and read Fat Joe strikes again. How true, I'm not about weed and brew. I'm just another papichulo like the rest of my crew. So give me the microphone. This jam is dedicated to my main man Tone. Cause he flips, and I flip, and we flip the script. And you know, you don't wanna get your ass WHIPPED. Party over here, another in the hospital. Lincoln, Memorial, notice that's how I sent you, hah. I was the one who played the shoot 'em up games. Here's another patient, and yo what's my name?. ""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Yeah! (2X). ""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Tell em who the hell I am. ""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"". [Fat Joe]. So I cruise around in the B-M. or in the Benz, hurtin enemies and makin new friends. They shake my hand, smile in my face. The nine's in my waist, so there won't be a chase. That's it, the situation is blown out of proportion. When you leave, you must use caution. Look over your shoulder, even on your block. When I come to visit, you know you're in shock. So don't say who is it, act like you know. Kickin down doors is the Gangsta Fat Joe. And I got no time for games. My name is goin down in the gangsta hall of fame. ""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Yeah!. ""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Tell em who the hell I am. ""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"". [Fat Joe]. Yeah.. Fat Joe Da Gangsta. Representin in ninety-three. Peace to my man Diamond D. Peace out to my man Ski."

You stuck being in jacks on the blocks witcha paps (Yeah). And the Squad to hard niggaz gotta fall back (Tell 'em). Damn papi, you're shit is icey now (Uh-huh). In the Bronx witcha Benz rims pokin out (Ten mil). You got the niggaz in the pen straight loc'in out. But when the don is on nigga close ya mouth. [Fat Joe]. Yeah, yo. You wouldn't understand my story of life I live. Most niggaz that really know me got life as bids. The trife as kids, this ain't no Scarface shit. These niggaz really will kill you, your wife, and kids. I walked through many blocks niggaz couldn't stand on. Had shit locked before I had a glock to even put my hands on. Before I had the dough to put my fams on. Before I had rocks sealed in pink tops, tryna get a gram off. A wild adolescent, raised by the street. Mesmorized by the dealers and the places they eat. And when they blazed the heat, I was the shorty to take the handoff. Run upstairs, tryna sneak the gat past grandmoms. This is how it should be done... my life.... Is identical to none, son tryed to duplicate but I knew he was fake. Cuz everytime I walked by he turned blue in the face. I'm like heavy on the leg when I pop. All my change is like heavy on the weight when I cop. It's just the way it's done. Niggaz tell me they respect the way I blaze them guns. On hold it down for the Bronx in the name of Pun. [Chorus]. [Fat Joe]. Yeah uh, my name ring bells like a P.O.. Put the pressure on a nigga like I'm right atcha do'. With the muzzle out, nigga can't shoke with my dough. I'm at his mothers house. Beat up his pops, put the pistol in his brother's mouth. Wave bricks, whips... jerked a few coke and next play the strip. with chrome knowin that they won't forget. And on the weekends we shut down clubs. You know them crazy Peurto Ricans always fuckin it up!. If I can't afford it, I'ma extort it. If I can't cut it, I'ma bake it. Strip you niggaz butt-naked, I'm a thoroughbred. Carry guns and pump heroin. Never went O.T. I'm too light for Maryland. I'd rather play the streets of New York. Where the fiends are guarunteed to keep the meat on my fork. I'm just a hustler - feds put the tap. on our phones in hopes of cuffin us. Then wonder why we livin life so illustrious."

dopeman,"Trying to cut the top off the Porsche. Put a bitch in the front. Better yet hundred sticks for the niggas that front. I got a steel in them packs, got em right in the trunk. Shoot the snap back off your muthaf-ckin head if you want. I got a guardian angel, yeaf she stay in the hood. And she pop up whenever I touch the grain on the wood. I got a bitch from Atlanta, she remind me of Pebbles. Got a hell of an ass, this redbone is a devil. She call me Marty Mcfly, Nike Back To The Future. 10 racks on my feet, but that’s something I’m used to. I put my team on the map, you other niggas is fake. Worse than Oregon, you switch a different jersey a day. I’m in the beach somewhere foreign, I’m in your bitch while you snoring. A million cash off the tour, then I’m back in the morning. I’m f-ckin sick of you niggas, I’m about to throw up a million. Doctor oz in the kitchen: cook a perfect prescription. Go prez, go prez, rolling in Bugatti. I got that Ringo Starr. I’m slingin’ Paul Mccartney. Bitch I’m in the kitchen with that Arm & Hammer. Whipping George Harrison, John Lennon. Dopeman! Dopeman!. Dopeman bitch, I’m the dopeman. Bitch I’m in the kitchen with that Arm & Hammer. Whipping George Harrison, John Lennon. Of course I could get em. But do you know what to do with em?. 60 for the brick even if you cop a few of ‘em. Talking about that diesel: the root of all evil. You could use your nostrils, or you could use a needle. I need a hundred more, and I want it pure. Cause when somebody die off it. Then they want it more!. The hustlers we surrounded by niggas that hold the hammers. Oxys got generic, they switched it to old. When you give em a 9 or better they go bananas. Make a million dollars a month: that’s what the plan was. Now to catch the morning shift. Cause they need that morning sniff. Thousand bundles finished by 11, then I’m blowing spliffs. Show you how to get right, crib right, whip right. Ten dollars a bag, but it’s 20 after midnight. Pill man, weed man, stove man, coke man. You know who I am muthaf-cka: I’m the dopeman. Cut the man off the middle, I want it all off the top. Bout to yacht me a nigga, run him off of the block. I’m taking all of the profit, purchasing more of the product. Invest in killers and dealers to take my company public. I got a thing for them strippers. Got a pole in the mansion. White ho, Marilyn Manson. This for all of my niggas doing time up in prison. For getting caught with the burner, you know a rider’s ambition. I’m ’bout to gamble with life, take a trip out to Vegas. I’m ’bout a Zionist mic praying the Lord to forsake us. Remember times I was broke, how it run in your pocket. Spend my money on dope, then I tripled my profit. Now I’m a multi-millionaire, head off in the Lear. Take bitches on the private, than set off in the air. “What you say nigga?”. “I said I’ll suck yo dick!”"
envy,"Yo This is going out to all my peeps locked down. Charlie Rock, LD. All my peeps who passed away, yeah. Verse 1:. I remember when we used to chill on a hill. When Forest Projects, used to be Godsville. Brothers was wilin, others was cool. Some hit the island, some smoked fools. Me I chose the life of crime since day one. 13 years old, already trying to cop a gun. I never understood why my pops would beat me. No matter what I did, yo he'd still mistreat me. That's why I never listened to a thing he said. And I wasn't just mad when I used to wish him dead. Instead, me and Ma Dukes kept tight. Promised that one day everything would be alright. 14 Years old, cutting mad classes. Puffing on a bone, breaking car glasses. Nothing but dreams of cream on my mind. Shook motherfuckers on the block droppin dime. Everybody knew Joey Crack represented. And if I told then I'd take your life. Hey Yo, I meant it. That's the way it goes. When you deal with the real fake jacks. And get your cap peeled. CHORUS:. Hey Joey, let's just get this money. Brothas just be wilin. Hey Joey, you can't trust nobody. Brothas they been triflin. Verse 2:. Yeah Momma never said life would be so hard. sometimes i find myself alone just praying to god. Hoping that today won't be the last. I mean, Just the other day this kid I knew got blasted. (Say Word) Word, it wasn't over no cash.. It was over some broad who liked to auction off the ass. He was a cool kid, although we lost him big. If he was a real nigga, then he wouldn't have got did. Life's trife, and then you die. Nobody dies of old age, but in the hands of another guy. That's why I keeps an alibi. Juliani wants to see a brother fry. So I maintain to keep my mind peace focused. Keep the gat there in case a nigga wanna smoke this. Times are difficult on the streets of New York. It's kinda hard trying to hope for and not get caught. Blue eyes is on my back with intentions of arresting me. But they won't get the best of me. Cause riches are my destiny. CHORUS. Verse 3:. No one expected me to blow like this. What was once hand me downs. Is now the best of ??atanovich??. Yukon Jeeps creepin through the streets. Catching the eye of every big booty cheek freak. Daten rims so shiny you can see your reflection. Green plush interior, under the seat. The heat for protection. Momma look at me now. Got a house in Long Isle for my spouse and my child. D.E.L. condos for first impression hoes. No more holes in my gibros. Strictly denim and clothes. Airwaves blasting my latest single. All up in the Mecca Club. Making Lucci while I mingle. Jingle jewels in the face of past enemies. Eat your heart out son, you never was a friend to me. CHORUS. Big Joe, South Bronx."

Blow out your tweeters, have dinner with world leaders. Terror Squad so much they be cats with dark caesars. Fast cars and millimeters, gold cards and Visa's. Givin nonbelievers ways to fly with Jesus. Here's my thesis, enterprise break the block to pieces. Hustler and hard pool shark like Jack Gleason. The only reason I came back was for the platinum. With raps, ten times more deadly than saccharin. MC's be actin, I think somebody needs to slap em. Run up on em attack em, and ask em what's his passion. My love is rockin shows at the highest extremity. This star from Trinity got your mom sayin she's feelin me. Who's dealin ki's, that's peace, get your cheese, ?. Pump this masterpiece at the loudest degree. Chorus: Fat Joe, Armageddon (repeat 2X). Let me find out (find out) niggaz is noddin out. Take some time out (time out) you wondered my whereabouts.

I've been down since the days of Flash. when it was fun and laughs, before hip-hop was based on cash. Let's blaze a sack and concentrate on coke inflation. You know the biggest asses in United Nations. Fuck the Federation, general population is hibernatin. But bear witness to information that'll rock this nation. I'm not God, but indeed, my mind's relatin. Better act now, before your life is wasted. cause time is racin. Chorus 2X. [Armageddon]. Yeah, now do you hip-hop. take Don Cartagena, as your lawfully wedded husband. Now by the power invested in me, by me. I pronounce you husband and wife. [Fat Joe]. Joey Crack, a.k.a. Kaiser Soze.

flow joe,"[Fat Joe]. Ahhhhhhh yeah!. Da Fat Gangsta. Chorus: repeat 2X. You gotta flow Joe, you gotta flow Joe. You gotta gotta gotta gotta let em know Joe. [Fat Joe]. Bust it, check it, watch how I wreck it. Niggaz watch your back, shit is gettin hectic. I catch vibes like Count Basie, sucker won't face me. I'm so much flavor you can taste me. I'm underground like a gutter. You never catch me - stutter, everybody knows that I'm butter. I'm not the man with sensitivity. The name is Fat Joe, the label's Relativity, huh. I chop a rapper like a meat cleaver. I'm burnin hot, people think I have a fever, check it. If niggaz wanna front, then come widdit. If you're havin second thoughts, well then forget it, see. I dig in my crates, I don't per-pa-trates. I got shit sewn, like Billy Bathgate. Beware like Cocoa, yo I'm not a slow boat. Got so much dough I va-cate in Acapulco. Crazy as they come I'm not the one, we can do this. with the hands, or take it to the guns... You know I can flow, the name is Fat Joe. I can flow, I can flow, I can flow. Chorus. [Fat Joe]. Yeah, yeah. Everybody knows Fat Joe's in town. Nuff respect for the Boogie Down. I'm livin in the Bronx on an Ave called Trinity. My name rings bells, within the vicinity. Peace to the money makers always plottin mono. Together we gettin dough, just like Lucky Luciano. People always tell me, yo you're dope Joe. But I'm not a car, so I don't get gassed like Amoco. Never ate the paint, no I'm not a sucker. Never liked ? so to Hell with the ?rucker?. Always on my own never sweatin nobody. Warm up a crowd like a bottle of Bacardi. I can kick it this way, I can kick it thattaway. I kick a funky style, from New York to Pasquetaway. Suckers best scram. Now in ninety-three it's all about the Fat Man. Peace to Finesse, Showbiz and A.G.. Gizmo, Little Hec', and Kool Micskit (say what?). My crew from Uptown. And if you mess around, then you'll catch a beatdown. See I got this in a smash. If a rapper steps up, he'll get smoked. like a blunt full of hash. My style of rap is legendary. Fuck with the man, then you'll end up in the cemetary. And that's word to Ma Duke. I never fake moves, I'll go out like a troop. So act like you know, the name is Fat Joe. I can flow, I can flow, I can flow. Chorus. [Fat Joe]. Yeah. See I rip the mic if you put me to a test. Troop it gets so bad, I make you wanna wear a vest. Cause I'm too hot to handle. Knockin niggaz out like ?Livingston Bramble?. Rappers come heavy, but yo I weigh a ton. I won't lose weight cause I'm not on the run. I'm on point like a sniper, hyper than the hyper. On the DL, overlooked by C-Cypher. Never get caught, I'm on top with my game. Flip a fat ride, there's no need for a train. Rappers come close, but they just can't make it. When it comes to the funk, you know I won't fake it. Peace to Serge, and my right hand Flex. And when I grab the mic nobody wants to rock next. The name is Fat Joe, cause Joe is livin Fat. Niggaz gettin jealous cause I got a contract. But I don't sweat it, I know the style is raw. You can't compare me to a cornball. And you know I kick game like a hottie. Now in ninety-three, they should free John Gotti. If you step, battle and I'm gonna mash your toes. You know I got the flow."

Now lets take it back to the Vibe Awards. Where that nigga disrespected and snuff your boss. Ready to go, all I heard G-G-G Unit!. Fifty niggas ran and they didn't even do shit.

Yeah, ohhhhhh, going.. going. Yeah yeah what up son?. Yo I got this twenty two nigga play me like... Nah, I ain't got no bullets. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Top two for five, three for five, we rollin!. [Fat Joe]. Now I'm in too deep. Only sixteen already hold a name in the street. Makin the fifth scream, rockin older niggas to sleep. Make a fiend strip naked cuz he owed for a week. Now the Squad's getting recognized, supplyin connects with pies. Pumpin pounds of weight, nigga like exercise. Joe been over quarter five dope and homicide. Long before Charlie got knocked, until Madonna died. Young and not givin a fuck. There ain't a nigga I ain't hit when I buck and left 'em shit outta luck. I'ma gangsta like my daddy was, hittin number spots. Sendin me to my room while he was puffin pot. Still I use to peak from the door, couldn't believe what I saw. Stacks of money on the bed and the floor. It wasn't long til I did what he did. I was an innocent kid and got exposed to the life that he lived. I went from grams into O's, pounds to bricks. On the strip pimpin hoes on some goldie shit. I'ma gangsta by destiny, OG's selected me. I earned my spot, my whole team elected me. [Chorus: children singing]. Gangsta, gangsta. I wanna be a gangsta. My daddy was a gangsta. Gangsta, gangsta. I wanna be a gangsta. My daddy was a gangsta. [Fat Joe]. Yeah, unh, yo, unh. Here goes this chick doing ten in the bing. But 'less we rhyme time we see her do it again. She started out fuckin dudes that resembled her father. Mom knew shoulda schooled her but the bitch didn't bother. You couldn't blame her cuz she got it from her. She was a rider from jump, her pop's died in the hands of a chump. Now she's mad at the world, no more daddy's little girl. Now she's rockin bandanas, no more Shirley Temple girl. Now she be runnin wit some scramblers that be down in Alabama. Packin twin hammers, screamin ""Life doesn't matter"". It's a vicious cycle, her game is pretending to like you. Thinkin you getting head but she's just duckin so they can snipe you. Movin from state to state, runnin everything from guns to trains. and pushing packs from eight to eight. You know I can't say her name but she was a looker. Pretty thing, such a shame how this life has took her. Now she's raising hell in the cell, no more his are hollering. You might suffer the same fate if you repeat the following... Sell drugs, use drugs, get caught up in the mix. End up locked up or dead in a casket, that's it."

john blaze,"Verse One: Nas. My stripes show like regiments, military intelligence. Murder game, I leave no evidence -- credentials. Go ask my pre-school, even talk to my old principal. He'd tell you how you I used to pack a No. 2 pencil. Stabbin students, grabbin teachers, Catholics, preachers. In the school staircase, cuttin class, passin my reefer. In my own class, operation return, they tried to say. I was incompetent, not able to learn. The table turned now, got my own label to earn. Like that nigga said in _Dead Presidents_, money to burn. Queensbridge, pay homage, respect Nas is the vet. Acknowledge the rep, polish baguettes, niggaz is dissin that. I'm just the best, puttin all violence to rest. between Latin Kings the blood _los sangres_, blood in Spanish. So many thugs vanish, unite the system. to fight with inner street wisdom, to help teach a prison. Verse Two: Big Punisher. My crew puff lye, anyone test the Pun must die. Just give me one try -- 'Now you know you done fucked up right?'. Hah, you ain't got no wins in my casa. Que te pasa, you ain't even in my clasa. I hate a actor that plays a rapper. I'm Terror Squad beta kappa everybody's favorite rapper. Grand imperial college material insane criminal. The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral. I reign subliminal inside your visual. Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical. I'll appear in your dreams, like Freddie do, no kidding you. Even if I stuttered I would still sh-sh-sh-shit on you. Soon as I chitter chatter you shitter shatter, I'm the kid. out of Bronx, that'll stomp you to death like it didn't matter. I'm even better than before, iller metaphors. Killers bet it all on Pun, cause one verse, dead em all. Chorus: scratches by DJ Spinbad. J-J-J-John Blaze. Ja-Ja-ah-John Bla-Blaze. J-Ja-J-Ja, John Blaze. ""Johnny Blaze ain't a damn thing changed!"" --> Method Man. Verse Three: Jadakiss. Aiyyo my attitude is subject to change, I mess around. and spit twelve at the driver's side door of your Range. Six hit you, the other six, up in your dame. Mafia style, leave you with your watch and your chains. Take heed that, not only can I flow I can aim. cause y'all misdemeanor niggaz can't stand the reign. Better believe that, whenever I see y'all I'ma test ya. Only cause I know that faggots respect pressure. Hardcore, like shit you get, kicked out the yard for. 'Kiss ain't the cops, but I lock niggaz up. You could meet me in my cell I soak and sock niggaz up. Far as the flow go, you could let your dough show. Put your money on the table, we could battle on cable. Y'all hot dog niggaz get nathans. Fuck around with Jason, that shorty from The Lox, John Blazin. Verse Four: Raekwon. My son cool out (what) don't beef yo, throw the tool out. Let's run these niggaz, kidnap they work, make em move out. Crushed hash, hands is like glass, keep the heat. in the dash, did some dirt for some work, caught a gash. The flicker blocker, wicked sneaker rocker footwear. Strike me out God, stackin up joints, rack em like Footlocker. This is raw, raw like fuck kid, represent. Here to Crenshaw, hold my words stronger than a Benz stall. Relentless, the anthology consolidated. with the quickness, dress up in the wig and blouse, killer sickness. Lex, imagination large, gold cards. Beat the bogus squad brains that connect put on the Older God. Specialist, iciclist, Woolridge collar. Feelin the rich, work for every dollar don't snitch, that's why. broke niggaz who got heart God, sign em up. Start the wind up, we John Blazin, Don up in the line up. Chorus. Verse Five: Fat Joe. It's simple mathematics, you gotta love us. Cause Joey Crack plus gat equals a lotta dead motherfuckers. Just when you thought I was done, I recruited Pun. Terror Squad Enterprise, undisputed Dunn. I'm from the slums where it's worse, bust with guns til it hurts. for fuckin with my funds on the first. And go to church like a mobster. Discuss your death over shrimp and lobster, with my Cuban partners. Lucas with the cartridge, twenty shot. Run up on any block, disrespect any cop. Used to run many spots, now I own shops. Gortex with the lot, five sixty-four bills a pop. I'm hot, who wanna get burned?. I fire one in your knot and watch your whole fuckin head turn. You best learn to parlay, I've had a hard day. Fuck around with the Don and get John Blazed. Chorus 2X."

Better gather them young'ns and hope you make it through. [Chorus] 2x. The Don is the King of New York..."

Nigga we from the Bronx, New York... shit happens,. Kids clappin'; love to spark the place,. Half the niggas on the block got a scar on they face,. It's a cold world, and this is ice,. Half a mil' for the charm, nigga this is life.. Got the family in front building on Trinity Ave.. 10 years billed legit they still figure me bad.. As a young, I was too much to cope with.. Why then, mo'fuckers nick-name me, cause I could coat shit.. Cause they caught the big Don on robbery, extorsion or grand larceny.... I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle,. This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble.. Came out the gate, no I didn't flow yo shit.. Fat nigga with shorty and the logo kicks.. [Chorus]. See my niggas don't dance,. See we just pull up the pants and,. Do the Roc-a-way.. Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.. I said my niggas don't dance,. See we just pull up the pants and,. Do the Roc-a-way..

And I just bought a bike so I can ride til' I die,. With a matchin' jacket,. Bout' to cop me a mansion,. My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'.. We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies,. So nevermind how we got here with the burlies and hoodies.. Listen we don't pay admission,. And bouncers don't check us,. And we walk around the metal detectors.. And there really ain't a need for a Vip section in the middle of the dance floor,. The regulars check it, said it?!. Like my necklace, started relaxin' now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction.. See, money ain't a thing nigga, we still the same nigga, flows just changed nigga.. And now we 'bout to change the game nigga.. [Chorus]. See my niggas don't dance,. See we just pull up the pants and,. Do the Roc-a-way.. Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back..

Gucci sweater now,. In that G4 we fly through,. Heny wether now,. See niggas get tight, when you worth some millions.. That's why I sport the cincilla to hurt they feelin's.. Your can find Joe Crack at all type of shit,. Out at Vegas front roll out on all the fights and shit,. If I visited Compton, they'd prolly squeel.. Cause have the rappers there blow like derek foreal.. If you cross the line damn right, I'm gon' hurt you,. These faggot niggas even made gang size commercials.. Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up,. B2k crip walkin' like that's what's up.. Can't keep tellin' me about all this rucker,. Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the rucker,. Not even Pee-Wee Herman could imagine this,. My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship.. [Chorus]. See my niggas don't dance,. See we just pull up the pants and,. Do the Roc-a-way.... Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back..

life goes on,"[Intro - Fat Joe talking]. Yeah, uh, yeah, Loyalty, haha. She was sixteen maybe seventeen, uh. Who you gonna trust?. And Life Goes On (2002). The timin ain't me, it's like, please goin through wrong. Speak the truth, haha, speak the truth, yeah, yo, yo. [Fat Joe]. She was only sixteen, when I met her I was playin the corner. Had to scream one of her niggas, like get up off her. She was a diamond in the rough, real neighborhood jewel. You would never see her out, 'less she comin from school. At first we started out like sisters and brothers. 'Till we finally let it out, and started kissin and huggin. And your moms always dissin me, tryin to get rid a me. I guess she figured out, I had taken your virginity. She was right, sexin all day. When they wouldn't let me in, we be playin the hallway. Talkin all day, bout the stupidest shit. Like if we got rich, what would we do with our chips?. And who was our favorite rappers, it was Nas at the time. We would memorize every single bar of his rhymes. Summertime, kids is playin in the park. I might just ride by, let 'em sprinkle the truck. And Life Goes On. [Chorus]. She was sixteen, maybe seventeen. I was eighteen, nineteen maybe a little bit more. (was she a little more), haha ... Yeah, huh, but Life Goes On. She was sixteen, maybe seventeen. I was eighteen, nineteen maybe a little bit more. hahahaha, yeah, yeah, woof, uh, yo. But Life Goes On. [Fat Joe]. This shit got deeper, you was havin my seed. I couldn't wait to see this little nigga look like me. Sure enough a little fat guy named D'Ryan. Kept us up all night, always bitchin and cryin. I was still slingin fast, the ""Flow Joe"" came out. Things changed, wasn't the same, wanted to hang out. The groupies was chasin me, rudely awakened me. No longer safe for me, this new world is takin me. You deserve much more than to be mistreated. I was a fucked up nigga, but at least I admit it. Just to be cool, I helped you through school. So you can have your own career, and don't depend on no fool. Life seems crazy when you look back. I pray to God, that you hook up with a good cat. We can't look at, who's right or who's wrong. But I thought I'd let you know through this song. That Life Goes On. [Chorus - w/ variations]. [Fat Joe]. So I moved on to the next phase a my life. I finally met the women I would make my wife. It was love at the first sight, in the worst way. Shorty kept holdin out, had me thirsty, mercy. Mi shari amor, whisper in my ear. Tell me baby girl is it me that you adore. Used to stay up all night, just bumpin and grindin. Makin plans for the future, how to hustle my rhyme in. Used to drive cross state for like a G a show. A well known famous rapper, but my pocket's is broke. But we kept grindin. Slowly but surely, kept climbin. Pun broke in the doors, now we headlinin. I'm lettin everybody know your my sweetest possession. How you kept me real strong through the deepest depression. Paid no mind to your friends, cause their words is trife. I hold you down for the rest of your life. Cause Life Goes On. [Chorus - 4X, - w/ variations, until fade]. [After song is over, there is a skit of a man being questioned]. [Man w/ questions:] Look just shut the fuck up, Joe told us what happened. [Twistin:] Told us what, what happened. [Man:] You're trying to act like you don't know what's going on, but I know. you know what happened that night. [T:] I was drinking Cristal on the right hand side (yeah). Hennessey on the left hand side. Macho gave it to me, I don't remember after that so, aw. [Man:] You think your a tough guy right (tough guy). Your not, your a pussy, cause your afraid if you rat on Fat Joe. [T:] Aw, sorry, sorry, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up. [Man:] Maybe we should put him in a cell and lock him up, until he fucking talks. [T:] Rat on Fat Joe, what do you mean?. There is no rat on Fat Joe, you disarespect him right now, that's not good. [Man:] Your fucking busted man, just tell us this shit. Your fucking baby momma told us. [T:] Fuck it, listen to me, I don't snitch, I'm Twistin alright."

Maybe that\'s why four\'s the God\'s perfect number. And you\'re all my angels. Victoria\'s Secret insatiable, that\'s {?}. C\'mon, get it together.

You get your nails painted proper. Pull out the black Amex, I\'ll take you shoppin. But when it\'s time to go I disappear like Hoffa. I see you next time when I decide to pop up, I\'m gone. [Chorus].

To have a woman like you in the life of Jose (Hey). [Chorus]. [Verse 2: Armageddon]. Yea how I'm supposed to start this. First and first you my queen goddess. My moon my earth the wisdom to a nigga's knowledge. I swear to god it amazes me how you stay in college. And still manage to raise my baby boy when I'm gone and. Touring making dollars assuming that I love you or regardless. I feel its time I showed you bless you with this ring, now that's. Something to hold you down till a nigga come back. Me and my lady got history this worth she deserves. More then this cold world is giving me to share with her word. And I don't care about nothing else except my girl (my girl). Not myself no one else just my girl (my girl). You bring life to my world you give me strength to go on. And face life even when it seems all holes gone.

And you get what you feel you deserve from that man, and. [Tony Sunshine]. Cuz I need somebody who will stand by me. Through the good times and bad times who will always.... always be my girl."

misery needs company,"intro: [police sirens]. [Noreaga and Fat Joe talking]. [Fat Joe]. Yo, yo, one's for the cash, two's for my facilty. three's for all the M-3's. Racin across the Tapenze. ?Matchin C's? followed by the white Lincoln. drivin like I ain't thinkin. Wit my hats and lights blinkin, let the lah sink in. On the way to home BASE,. first clown in my face is gettin thrown out the place. We rush shit, untouchable Don shit, that's nothin new. Sets with stone arms just to muscle you, enough of you. That had a bad case of Joe, some even had to go. Gangsta walk and nines, at times I be the last to know. We laugh and joke, while we bag in the coke. My A done make the worst things out the cast of Different Strokes. I'm addicted to street life, although it doesn't seem right. Many criticize but yo we all go to eat right?. And who's to say that I'm to blame(blame). we only pawns in this game(game). Decision: grow cocaine. I don't want no cure for this, you switch, I pour the Cris. And just, stay rich, and reminisce, while I count my chips. Chorus. [Noreaga]. Yo you scared to death, misery need company. Crab slackers, niggas actin like they mad rappers. Even wit a record deal, our guns still peal. Break a piece of your brain, wipe the stain. Throw the Range off, police-iano. Watch for hondo, they lookin at our poster now, playin us closer now. The funds follow us, what, these bitches swallow us. And you wonder why you can't find us. [Fat Joe]. I ?ton and tender? wit millionaires, gave a million stares. Made a million scared, my beats don' knocked. For what seemed like a million years, yea. This illegal life I can't avoid, I take the feds everywhere I go. That's why I'm paranoid, but still I choose to ignore the fact. I got the flawless Acs wit gats to get that enormous stack. Joey Crack, the mack without the hat. And all our hoes dine and ride in the back seat of my Cadillac. I bet you hate it cuz we paid and floss, nigga we laid and lost. T.S.'ll make the baddest crews take a loss. Break your balls like Bahondo, call me Don Joe. Coke slash sweaty rock, niggas drop a dime dough. Booked the nine o'clock, flight to Alando. So-called killers turned snitches like Rivono. That nigga Gauno up in M-C, is bein friendly. Everytime I see his wife and kids the shit tempts me. My heart is empty, never feelin remorse. I got a sniper one killed in the cross ready to kill your boss. Chorus. [Noreaga]. Yo, yo Jose Luis, smoke lah like the reverand. Look in the skies, clouds look like coke 'n heaven. Like whoever sittin on pies two, gettin high too. mad fly too, a thug too. Yo we praise those, however you make your pesos. Keep the shit tight just like, Jose Canseco's. Batting stance, a majorly we glance,. and gotta yell ""What, What!"". Cuz thug niggas don't dance yo. I told niggas, that you did it for show,. but niggas thought you was ill yo. Even your hoe, yo for real youngblood I'm really afraid so. Your colors got revealed and now you buy dough. Impost-o's, locos, morenos, go-golos, boriquas, platin-o's. My niggas rollin those, fontos and hydros. You know how that goes, DE's light it up though. We stay smokin it, tone-locin it,. me and Fat Joe still provoking it. Chorus. (ha ha, mad rappers, stain off, range off, watch out. polic-iano's, pabolos."

That's a whole lotta bread, you know it had to be Joe. Cathedral ceilings in the crib, got sinners in it. I had bitches eating pussy like it's dinner in it.

Man these funny style bitches, I be laughing at them. Hoes be grabbing his dick, I be grabbing his gun. Walking out the court, thumbs up, Jon Gotti. On my '93 Biggie shit, bullshit and party.

murder rap,"[Fat Joe]. Uh-oh, uh-oh... Let's get it over with.. Yo sound boy turn the levels up. Let's get it over with, UH!. Terror Squad up in this motherfucker. Where my real niggaz at?. My Bronx niggaz, my (?) niggaz. I see you Lil' Hat! Uh, Ahaha!. It's time to take it to these niggaz right here. Yeah.. yo.. yo... Who wanna spaz out? Crunchtime, blow ya abs out. Leave you in the fetal position, witcha ass out. Ready to mash out any crew actin like. they the true facts of life, frontin through the camera lights. Despite, we hold it down regardless. I got Def Jam suckin me like, ""I wish you was my artist"". For starters, who's the largest cat?. Get a hundred grand from my most garbage rap. Now how hard is that? Everything we spit be hot. Whether it's live on Flex or in front of the chicken spot. Grimed out, we really live whatchu rhyme 'bout. See me posted up in the Tunnel, with my shines out. Ice cold like Alaska when I pass ya. Got girls shakin, losin they breath, as if they catchin asthma. Headed to the bar to pop some bottles. Now we in the car headed home to rock some models. All I hear in the background is Gucci and Prada. But I'm tryna gas these bitches to screw me for nada. We the best that done it, confess you fronted. Anybody wanna test how much straps, you want it?. [Hook - Fat Joe]. Aiyyo the gangsta's back. Stop it right where you at. Let a real nigga rock real murderer rap. Tell them thug niggaz, listen to that. Gotchu feelin it hard like Joe the God's really bringin it back!. [Fat Joe]. I'm from my days and legends, since age eleven. I was the cause of dope fiends catchin AIDS infections. Most of us are dead, but the rest is locked. Runnin in the rec room and check me out on the box. A CEO could get optioned tryna change the channel. It's like tryna take the flesh outta the mouth of hungry cannibals. Joe the God, the flow is hard. Known for packin two dozen birds like Noah's Ark. I'm the realest of 'em, make you feel the pressure. Catch you at a club, smack you up, steal ya leather. You niggaz soften me, beat you out of the mix. Tough talk, tough walk, but you cry like a bitch. I see you downin the Cris', I'm not hatin, I'm just aggrevated. I ask myself every day, how these faggots made it?. Fuck around with the Don and get decapitated. I'm sick of hearin 'em (?) for all the cats that made it. [Hook - Fat Joe]. [Hook 2 - Armageddon]. Aiyyo the kid is back. Leave it right where you at. Let a real nigga hold that, you probably won't clap. Tell them thug niggaz, move it on back. I'm feelin tight and I'm hot. Ready to pop the crack right through your back. [Armageddon]. That's how Kenny rocks, I'm more advanced than how your learnin. I'm like the force of space balance and planets while they churnin. Poppin rosary beads, piss on ya candle while it's burnin. Rush ya widows crib and pop ya... bodies.... Now I know you can feel the heat I generate. Imagine when I penetrate ya stomach, and make ya body's center bake. We can argue for days, whether it's faster to drop five shots. in ya astronaut before you cloud the stash box. Splash ya brains on ya birds' laps. Swerve you on the curb, crash the Range, and push the front skirt back. And murk after that, blurtin curse words. Yo I popped that nigga's son one before we catch the first. I'ma kill any murderer, leave a nigga burpin up. Blood, chokin on chunks of his lung interior. Every verse that I spit's a personal riff. I meet a ill key frontin, I'm a murder you shit. Niggaz play me while distrubin the Bricks. I'm like the feelin of the first time they ever held a bird in they grip. Motivator thug, scrape 'em, shoot the bolts in his butt. Energizin 'em up, make 'em wanna open 'em up. Actin like I can't happen till I smack him in his Adam's apple. Death to rappin, I don't wanna battle. I'd rather rush your studio session and shatter the booth. Clap at ya face, give the mic feedback the goof. [Hook]."

say word,"[Fat Joe]. Yeah, don't get it fucked up. This shit is realer than you think. Goin out to all them niggaz gettin cream. Drivin them beemers, them NSX's, them Lexus. All up in the clubs, buyin out the bars and shit. Uhh, money man in the house. Yeah, uhh... Sparks are flashin from oowops blastin. A face gets bashed in for street crews clashin. Forever be forever great. It's the same shit tomorrow, eulogies of sorrow. Nonstop dramas, chumps think they hard smokin ?. It's all for steel my son, light as a tongue. The connections I got, I can lamp while you get done. Remember that, I dismember cats that act. A plain and simple fact is I react on impact. I'm plenty versatile, wild. Have you screamin like your head short a few vials. No more slabs and dollar cabs. Strictly Lexus Coupes with my troops feel the Alpine blast. Extra dark tints, for sticky events. Suspense makes the lead dispense. A baby oil massage when I'm feelin intense. Fly mami's with ki's taped to their bo-ties. Transportin through a airport securities. In cahoots with the San Juan authorities. Hated by majorities, loved by minorities. Uhh, the top dog, ??. Hazardous to your health like smog. Chorus: Fat Joe (repeat 2X). (Say word) Word! Fuck what you heard. Shit is realer than you think, you niggaz must be slow. (Say word) Word! You best to act like you know. It's that real nigga shit from Fat Joe. [Fat Joe]. Business chatter's over shrimp and lobster platters. at Jimmy's Cafe, a glass of Peirier. Chick go for celly book a room at the Holiday. Inn, so I can get her and a friend. Menage a trois livin the life of a star. Overweight overpaid, pockets bustin out the seams. While you suckers havin limousine dreams. I got you all sized up, niggaz wise up. A Fat Beat truck'll be pickin all you guys up. Word to mother, shit is realer than you think. Hit my lady with diamond rings, gold links and minks. A nickel-plated trey-deuce, pearl handle is pink. So there's no muggin, all you niggaz must be buggin. The mac in the trunk's what I'm luggin. (Say word) GEYEAH, save it for the hook. Terror Squad's everywhere you look. Niggaz is vexed from all the hoes I took. From Trinity Ave all the ways down the Brook. Chorus 1.5X. [Fat Joe]. Yeah, goin out to my nigga Big Frank. 1-7-0 Joe. Notorious One, yeah. Uncle Dan got my back. Charlie Rock L.D., up in Auburn, doin your time. Swear to God when you come home you'll be on nigga."
she's my mama,"You know one man's treasure is another man's trash (speak on it). And you know the man who sleeps on the floor can't fall the fuck off the. bed Nigga. Pop your collar to this. It's grills mania, ya heard me. Owww. [Chorus:]. She's my Mammy. She's my baby. I love you so much. You driving me crazy. Wanna be down. Jump in the car. Rollin wit me. I'll make you a star. [Verse 1:]. Now she was only sixteen I had to nurture that. Give her some growth. Waited till I touch the cat. Told she going have to work if she going get ahead. Then she drove me berserk when she game me some head. She told me that she learnt that from the porno flicks. I said Mami stop talking. Just suck on this dick. I ain't say her name yet so let's say she nothing. Now watch me turn this nothing into something. Get it. Mami, Get in that kitchen. This is free base. Just cook it till its hard then cut it in eighths. Take the trip cross town to see True. Just get the money don't listen. That Nigga think he cute. See all this money we got we going shopping. Louis Vitton & Pucci. We get it poppin. We hit the club on some clico shit. See the respect that you get from just being my bitch. Look see 'em they sick. They wan be in your shoes. That's the game that I hit her wit to leave her confused. I'm just using her for paper. She want a man. I'm bout to see my other bitch but. She understands. [Chorus x2]. [Verse 2:]. Ay Yo. I met her at the Rucker Park. Watchin' the stars play. I knew she was a terror. She was watchin' the squad play. I knew she had her own. She was pushin' the bubble X. Type of eye candy that you see in the Double X. Fat Ass, Long Hair. Short like Nia Long. I knew she was a victim from the start. My G is strong. And then she said she ain't felt this good in ten summers. Gave me credit card and debit card with pin numbers. I'm lookin' at receipts. She spent G's on the kid. I'm pushin' her V. Even got keys to the crib. If I needed to bag up. I bought G's to the crib. I got knocked - What she did. Put up the deed to the crib. Now she got a new gig at Chase Manhattan. Look my niggaz is wit Ma. Let's make it happen. So I burst through the door bout a quarter to four. Told every nosey bitch. Get the fuck on the floor. Then she opened up the bag. And started to fill 'em all. Making sure that she left the marked money in the drawer. Told security if you move. This goin' be your last night. I'm working with this Mack ten. You workin' with a flash light. I'm walking backwards. Nobody moved word to mother. Tryin' not look - cause I don't want to blow her cover. That's when this bitch winks and blew a kiss at me. I don't believe this bitch took all them risks for me. That why. [Chorus x2]"
"shit is real, pt. iii","[Intro: Fat Joe]. Slow motion baby, unh. Tell you what I see through these eyes. All we do is speak the truth. Shit is realla then real. Shit is realla then real. My true niggas walk wit me, yeah. They ride wit me, cook pies wit me, ya heard?. [Fat Joe]. Lord I keep hollering, I hope you listening. How come I'm still stressed and even though the squad's glistening?. Why you had to take Pun, someone so young. Had so much more to live for, as real as they come. Dead man can't talk that's why your hearing one side of the story. But did they tell you how he provided for forty. family members, grandmas to shorties. Even my seeds ate off the big homie. How could you deceive your kids like that?. Make 'em believe they dad wasn't worth jack. Listen to the facts as The Don pours his heart on this track. How could I jus stand there and not react?. And I'm jus about sick of all you side line niggas. You know, do anything for the lime light niggas. I'm defending your honor, my brother from anotha momma. I never thought I'd see the day they tried to send you byna. [Chorus: Fat Joe]. Shit is realla then you think, man you must not know. It takes a lot to walk a day in the life of Fat Joe. The place I'm from, MTV don't wanna film. Jus a simple dice game will get a muthafucka killed. The ghetto ain't a place that you wanna take lightly. Same cat that'll spill you, will end up with your wifey. I've seen it all that's why I've picked up the pen. To keep your boy from serving life in the pen, ya heard?. [Fat Joe]. Fuck, the flu season, nowadays it's sue season. Can't even go to the clubs and show my people love. Cuz soon as shit pop off niggas knuckle love. Niggas accusing me of fuckin 'em up!. I'm like ""hold up, ain't they supposed to be dogs?"". Part time live niggas dabbeling drugs. See a rapper think of a lucrative deal. But youse a bitch if you choosing to squeel. It's more than obvious you don't know a thing about honor. But what goes around comes around, you'll soon learn about comma. As for me I stay being the realest. Admired by politicans, street thugs and killers. I keep feeding the street but the street feed back. Is that police tryna see Joe back in green slacks. But never dat, see I keep long money. and if you looking for dat you'll never see a cent from me. [Chorus]. [Fat Joe]. Yo, unh, I stay grinding, everybody counted me out. Now I'm rewinding in my summer beach house. If I'm not in the studio I'm out on tour. Busting my ass to make my fans future secure. Nowadays everybody want somethin for nothin. All of a sudden niggas talkin like ""Joey be frontin"". The hood screaming Crack done changed, he don't holla. I know now Big, Mo Money Mo Problems. Jealousy's a muthafucka. Who'd a thought the same niggas you be feeding be the muthafuckaz coming for ya. I'm not stressin, I was born a warrior. Plus I'm too big, too strong, too wise for ya. When it's all said and done I follow my dreams. Could have ended up dead or in jail given the scheme of things. To let chu know I'm the reason you still walkin. If I said something it was me, not the liquor talkin."
shorty gotta fat ass,"Well it's Friday night, I'm in a club with a crew just maxing. Cuties and booties and yo I'm ready for action. Cause Fat Joe doesn't go to clubs for his health. It's too many skins, so every man for himself. I got me a Sex on the Beach from the bar. I know this girl was looking at me from afar. Plus she with a crew, they all got it going on. She came over and asked me if my name was John. I said, ""Yeah, John Doe, so what's it to you?"". She said ""Sorry yo, I just thought I knew you"". She walked away dissed because I had dropped the bomb. I felt bad so I reached out and snatched her arm. I pulled her back, gave her my apologies. She accepts it, but now she starts to follow me. Watching where I'm going, seeing who I know. Once she saw the Gucci, she said ""Oh, that's Fat Joe"". I could hear the conversation, Shorty was digging me. No way she was igging me, ayo she was big on me. Throughout the night she remained in my eyesight. My man Black Caese was telling me ""Yo she's fly, right?"". No that the jam is over there's no need to front. Cause she's leaving out the club and I'm right behind her. Now we in the deli butt naked catching wreck at last. Cause shorty gotta fat ass. Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x). She got a big fat.... Driving in my Five on the live side of town. One of those days I just wanna ride around. With three deep, me Diamond D, and Peep. (Who's Peep?) That's my man that be whipping the white jeeps. So bust it, I hit Fordham road in the town. Cause I'm riffing in the front fool, Luther Vandross. Never too much, and what did I see?. Honeygrip had a little too much for me. Diamond said ""Damn!"" Peep said ""I know her!"". Yeah right, whatever, I'm still pulling over. Hey mamita, Spanish I'm assuming. A Spanish caught wreck and that ass was booming. I couldn't see her face cause she wouldn't turn around. Peep is out the window staring Five-O down (Bo bo bo!). Chill with that, cause I wanna stop and chat. Like a diplomat, yo you're fucking up my rep. She wouldn't turn around so I reached for her pelvis. She turned around, ugly hound dog, and I felt this (God damn!). Money grip was ugly, I had to find out at last. But shorty had a fat ass. Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x). She got a big fat.... No need to be ill come all out my face. But the name is Fat Joe and in love I got good taste. Big butts come a dime a dozen in New York. I couldn't help but notice when I watch you walk. You got the booming system and I don't mean sound. I want to smack it up, flip it, and rub it down. I know girls try to say I'm living foul. But you know you can't trust a big but and a smile. I'm not concerned with the niggas in your past. But straight up and down, shorty gotta fat ass. Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x). She got a biiiiiig.... Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x)."

still real,"[Fat Joe]. It's so depressing, uh... Be the realest shit I ever wrote (Money and cars bitches). Shit Is Real Part 2.. (drugs) modern day.. (society yaknow?). See what it's like to walk in my shoes. It ain't all fun and games (ya heard?). Yo yo. I'm sick and tired of stressin, every days a different lesson. I'm free-fallin tryna leave this deep depression.

To get where I'm going to. Stay where I stay. Blaze who I blazed. Pay dues how I payed. To get where I'm going to. [Fat Joe]. Uh, yo, the South Bronx, nine years later. Ain't nuttin changed, niggaz still playa haters. T.S. the best that's done it, forever live and never front it. Reminisce of when I used to hold heat and tell niggaz ""run it"". Now we flooded with jewels, hundreds of dudes. Crowd the Coliseum to hear they favorite tunes. Then at the time of our prime we caught a sick one. The angels came down, took my twin Big Pun. Shit were unbalanced throughout the whole world. All I could do was try to provide for his seeds and his old girl. Hope your listenin, tell Ton' that we still missin him. I'm like a prisoner in jail with no visitors. [Chorus] 2x. [Fat Joe]. Yeah, uh, aiyyo the third verse is dedicated to you. Even though you switched teams, I'm praying for you. We used to stay up all night countin dollar for dollar. You was my son's godfather, where the fuck is your honor?. Can't even rap the shit we did together. You'd probably have me shackled locked down doin bids forever. You broke the first code. I'd like to twist ya wifey till it roasts gold. Snitch nigga, turned state to sold ya soul. How could a nigga that was clappin in the streets. start yappin to the deez, like what I rightly should believe?. Like ever verse is a charge, for every hurt there's a scar. I never once tried to hurt cha'll. I'm just tryna do me, sell a few CD's. Buy land in Miami and cop a new B come on!. [Joe talking]. Motherfuckers think it's sweet. Think a nigga got money and a nigga don't feel pain. You ain't never feel my pain. You don't know what the fuck I'm goin through. Niggaz lookin at me like, ""He got it made"". Like I ain't lose Pun, my grandfather a week later. My aunt a month later. Like my fuckin sister ain't in a coma right now!. You motherfuckers don't know pain!. Let's get one thing clear; money'll never buy you happiness. My true niggaz walk with me now!."
story to tell,"Crack. [Chorus]. For every shell that fell. There's a story to tell. They say you hustler then you going to hell. Nah, I know God love's me. Yeah, I know that he fucks with me. Can a gangster go to heaven. Let me in. I call it survival you call it a sin. Damn. I got a story to tell. Yeah, I got a story to tell. [1st Verse]. Yeah I'm right here. Gun in my right palm. Nigga tried and trap me and cage me like my san. Oh shit this mic on. I'm speaking my thoughts Nigga. You catch a hundred if you speaking in court. I'm feeling like Michael. Just before the verdict. Sweat on my forehead. I'm anxious and nervous. These streets ull eat you if you let em. Cop ull beat you. You pumping diesel then them Jack boys ull beat you. I try and listen more and speak less. Cause all that Barber shop talking ull put a Nigga to deep rest. You on the corner and I'm flying buy. Some foreign exotic mo' fucker. You know we flying buy. Oh you got nine lives. I got a pine box. You might as well hop your ass in it cause my iron popped. And I ain't lying Ac. Yeah I'm lying hard. Run up on anybody that's supplying my block. [Chorus]. [2nd Verse]. I know this Nigga named Shaheim. An old school cat. Did Football numbers. And never once rat. Now he back on the block got em slinging them packs. And his rep's kind of crazy. Known for slinging them Macks. Got a baby with Sandra. Names him K-Sacks. Cause that's where he did his first bid way back. Now this Nigga Sha' got like a memory lapse. Basically you give him work and he ain't payin' back. Now with some connects you could away with that. But he must of fucked wit the wrong Columbian cats. Now these niggaz comin' strapped they want they money back. And you can't tell the difference cause some of them look black. Now Sha on the block thinkin' life's a joke. And his Mama just had a dream that he might get smoked. But he don't give a fuck he been through the best wars. Knife to knife. The yard to mess halls. And these niggaz here have something else in mine. Like a hundred shots fired at a pretzel less spine. Uh huh, you guessed it. Just a matter of time. Another soldier down he got hit with a nine. Dang. [Chorus]. [3rd Verse]. Nah I ain't a rapper. Motha fuck rap. They snitched on Kim. How lame is that. This game ain't shit. But snakes and rats. Fighting each other for loose change and scraps. My Nigga kicked you right on your back when you down. No life preservers. They wanna see you drown. Pull the trigger myself. They don't want know help. Now the only Nigga tell on myself is myself. Money Power Respect. You heard the Lox. Half these niggaz in here deserve to get popped. I think we another fuckin Biggy and Pac. So you Mo' fuckers could have another million man march. [Chorus].

success,"Yeah. This joint right here is goin out to everybody gettin money. I mean the real CREAM. All up and down the East and West coast. Check it *echoes*. Chorus: repeat 2X. Hustlin is the key to success. Money is the key to sex. The life is gettin cash, drinkin Mo', gettin blessed. The games people play. The names people slay. It's just another ordinary day. One's for the cash, two's for every blunt's ash. Three's for all the 40 brews goin to cruise the bowel. Four's for the drugs, sex, and power. I be the top dolla scala, rockin gold collars. While you tryin to sip the juice, I'm takin swallows. Step into my zone and get blown, ? internationally known. Yeah, in case you haven't heard the rep. Have an appetite for beef and get, hand fed led. Rapid-fire echoes through your, vicinity. Why you messin with this nigga from Trinity?. For every shell that fell, there's a story to tell. But it's a fine line between grapevines and pines. Knahmean? There's no room for snitches and loud bitches. But it's always room for riches and deep ditches. That's how it be in this everlasting game. Declaring war on cocks, and leavin chumps slain. So maintain, and put the frontin to a rest. Or today'll be the grand openin of your chest. Success, triple beam, knahmean?. Dolla dolla bill. Chorus. The streets are full of vengeance, and it's expensive. If you don't organize your words right in your sentence. Twelve gauge holes take souls and lives are lost. Who said an arm and a leg was a high cost to toss?. Things are done different, in my zip code. Hollow tips implode, dum-dums explode. Now your crew is screamin like they see demons when I reload. You can't comprehend, act like you want it for clarity. I'm pushin wigs, handin out jigs like charity. You best to get your groove on, or get moved on. Or play the hot steppa, and die with your shoes on. I collects ass and cash. While my crew consumes liquor and hash, and keep the stash. Whether, hustlin or dustin we get busy with ours. T.S., T.A.T., respect for miles. The Bronx is the turf, South is the area. Bring ten, bring twenty, the more guns the merrier. Nobody's bad as me, no cops nabbin me. Front if you dare and I'll change your whole anatomy. For real... uh!. Chorus (repeat to fade)."
take a look at my life,"[Intro: Fat Joe]. Whooo.. friendly day in the neighborhood. Birds is chirpin (Hi neighbor!). Niggas walkin they dogs, ha ha, watering they flowers. That's my neighborhood..

Yes I'm Puerto Rican and I speak it so that you know. Stomp.. yeah that's the idea. Leave that nigga leakin from ear ta ear. Listen here young bruh, man ya end is near. They probaly, find your body at the end of the pier. Niggas must be crazy to mistakin me for folk lore. I put the eighty to your baby man I told y'all. Fuckin wit crack's like fuckin wit Crack. What? Pull out the pipe or push your weight back. Look, ya hate that, look we stay straped. From Crook from way back done took the game back. Ya shook, remain fact top of the world, stop knockin the girl. She in the drop with already rock lock and the pearl. Fish Scale ta Heron, live well from here on. Half a mil in ya grill, of course we bare all. Niggas thinkin that this rap is just words. I pull up in they curb, pull a Desert Bird. and clear the block in no time. Get off my dick, stop focus shit and getcha own shine, muhh'fucka. [Chorus: Fat Joe]. Take a look at my life, and you can see that. I'm from the Bronx where it's known to hear the heat clap. Y'all need a nigga like me to point cha fingers at.

My Lifestyle the shit, really had the streets buggin. Oh no he ain't come back like that. Not Crack with a platinum plaque, yo!. It's the thirteenth al spinna. Niggas use to doubt now we even made Craig Common look like a winner. Me and Diddy skippin out on bills. Just copped the house on a hill, now how that feel?. Fuck, alot of y'all niggas, you been shittin since the first song. Now we rip it down spring break with no shirt on. Ass all out, just swoonin the crowd. Same damn mean bitches wanna move in my house. You see us back to back in 'em snow white trucks. Chain hanging off the rim, you not giving a fuck. You must not be reading it right. Ice so bright, we don't need headlights at night. Yo, crack niggas, ask niggas how I smack niggas. with the mac flast cuz I am what I rap, nigga. TS throw in your hands, make 'em pack nigga. To never let another crew move his back nigga, what!. [Chorus]. [Outro: DJ Kay Slay]. Yeah, DJ Kay Slay a.k.a. Slap ya favorite DJ. The black Fat Joe of the motherfuckin game.

temptation pt. 1,"Temptation Pt. 1. (Beat Novacane!). [Chorus 2X: Fat Joe]. Lord forgive me temptation to kill. But I gotta give these crackheads the definition of real. Motherfucker die - don\'t look in my eye. Take this wit\'cha nigga, tell the devil I sent ya. [Fat Joe]. Yup! Death ain\'t sweet man. But it\'s a fact that one day ya breath gon\' cease. Some niggaz get cremated, others rest in peace. You can get shot tomorrow if you test these streets. Go against Crack - hehehe - that\'s a problem. I\'m a driveby, stabbin, napalm kinda problem. Choose one, the AK or revolver. I\'ll leave your body leakin layin on the carpet. Yeah, this nigga don\'t care. Have your head spinnin like that chick Linda Blair. I\'m the Exorcist, niggaz don\'t know when they exit is. But I keep a K that cause a mass exo-dus. You don\'t want no problems, problems. Fuckin with these frauders {?}. I had the ambulance racin the street. Have your poor momma raisin the sheets, muh\'fucker. [Chorus]. [Fat Joe]. Let me tell you \'bout myself, you can find me alone. On the streets of the Bronx, that\'s the county I own. Well at least that\'s the one I\'m claimin. You know a muh\'fucker that\'s realer then name him. Damn near a decade done passed and we still on top. My nigga Pun died, niggaz thought the shit gon\' stop. I\'m not concerned with the rumors and the small talk. Thought a nigga learned when he caught it and he walked off. Shoulda put the burn to a nigga so he\'d slow down. Niggaz won\'t be thinkin, that\'s it rap, when it go down. In L.A. we got Bloods and Crips, in Chi-Town the Kings. Got other mob bosses kissin my ring. Don\'t confuse me wit\'cha favorite MC. Difference is this mans\'ll kill him as a favor for me. Until then it\'s just.... [Chorus]. [Fat Joe]. Yo - wake up in a cold sweat. 5:15 in the mornin, hear my phone ring. It\'s my nigga Ant speedin, slow down dog. You actin like the po-po chasin ya, be easy. He tellin me, \""Crack where the fuck is you at?\"". I\'m at the hotel Radisson, hour ago. I did a show out in Patterson, took the bitch home. Nigga you know she was the baddest one, as was the Fattest one. This nigga Ant yell, \""Crack what\'s her name?\"". Carmen, why you stallin, why the fuck you callin. He said, \""Joe they tryin to set you up. Put you six feet deep tryin to wet you up. You know that nigga Pablo from... Ave. Now he push pounds of blow, niggaz swear he bad\"".

Niggaz is talkin in the hood again, hood again. Yeah niggaz wanna act live. I got that 9 that kill more than just time. They say they can\'t stand him, but just yesterday. I was chillin on the block in the Phantom. And ain\'t nobody smirk my way - nope - keep speakin that hot shit. and you can get merked today, check me out. There\'s some rumbling on the blocks, struggle on the streets. That\'s why I had to leave that bitch bloody in them sheets. Go \'head and think Crack just rap. Fuck around I\'m gon\' really have to clap these cats. I hear \'em talking that. [Chorus]. [Interlude: Fat Joe]. If I don\'t know you boy I\'m lettin \'em go. I tried tell you boy I\'m lettin \'em go. Your momma warned you boy that I ain\'t no joke. I tried tell you boy I\'m lettin \'em go. If I don\'t know you boy I\'m lettin \'em go.

I know he big but this here 9 gon\' stop him. I\'m in the streets everyday in these projects. I ain\'t scared nigga, man I\'m dyin to get it poppin. [Chorus + Interlude]. [Fat Joe]. Pussies loose these days, gotta tighten \'em up. Think they comin of age \'til you lighten \'em up. Momma screamin cause you lyin in dust, I ain\'t lyin. Who the fuck you think supplyin the drugs?. I\'m your boss that\'s boss, pretty much I bought you that Porsche. And pretty much I\'m \'bout to auction you off. to the highest clapper, get your head spun backwards you bastards. For thinkin Terror Squad just rappers, we\'ll blast ya. You lil\' niggaz ain\'t even in my lane. Who you know nicknamed after \'caine?. Yeah I\'m goin to hell, but I\'m sendin you first. Muh\'fuckers think they tough \'til them canisters burst. I know you hear my niggaz. [Chorus + Interlude]"
terror squadians,"[Fat Joe]. Terror Squad. Ungh. Now why you wanna go and fuck with them? Platinum. status, motherfuckers. Eat a dick!. Now who's the underated pro, they scared to play on the radio?. Who lives the lyrics, all my real niggas already know. Flow for flow, no crew can step to us. And blow for blow, I'm pretty sure that you heard the rumors. I give tumors to niggas and comas to bitches. No one's against us, roll with the riches. and float with the fishes. The revolution has started thats why I'm undercarded. My Squad will turn to the most feared into the dearly departed. As hard as they come, they all fall like the Great Wall. Make no mistake, I take you straight to the state morgue. Swarmin informers like cops at drug corners. Feds got the bugs on us, tryin to lay the law on us. They want us in jails, with bails too high to bond, but am I the Don?. Shit, I'll be out by the morn', word bond. My game is on lock, till you bawl cop. And its never ever gonna stop. [Prospect]. Yo, yo, I play the game with caution. Sun changes, gave power creative activities. bring fame and fortune. Why can't you live this? All day hands on bitches. With financial ventures, enhance the riches. Gotta hold the cake, my grandmoms had dreams. but it seems I couldn't graduate or go to Drake. It hurts at nights I gots to reimburse the vice. Niggaz is worse than shiest for the merchandise. My words precise, cause if not I wouldn't speak it. I rock shit everyday of the week, especially the weekends. Outside, these pretty clothes I live, but with the titty-ho. Knock a nigga out, for the shit he stole. We already degraded, me and my family the most hated. Bitch were barely both made it. See the thinly related, to everything in the street. I'm sellin coke, crack, and dope, plus swingin the heat. Chorus: Triple Seis. We got drug dealers and bug niggas, who love killin. Slugs killin, ya touch feelin, just for the thrillin. We bust feelins, dump bodies in crushed buildings. Terror Squad's everywhere, it's just us illin. I thought you knew you had.... Drug dealers and bug niggas, who love killin. Slugs killin, ya touch feelin, just for the thrillin. We bust feelins, dump bodies in crushed buildings. Terror Squad's everywhere, it's just us illin. (And it don't stop!). [Cuban Link]. I got rubies on my Uzi's and gems on my Mack 10's. Diamonds on my nines and golden bullets just to match them. Platinum magnums with silver clips, real begets. Shit, I'm gonna milk this bitch till I'm filthy rich. Filled with chips from the floor to the ceiling. Just flossin and chillin in a Porsche full-a-women. I'm one in a million, get on the deal already. My skills are sharper than a steel Maschetti. Realer than the military. Killin every track I'm on, Link and Joey Crack the Don. Flippin in my Cuban Caddy, wit the hazards on. [Triple Seis]. So, come on if you gon' ride with us, live niggas. Hop with us, quick to try to triple five figures. [Big Punisher]. Your style is unoffic', niggaz like you stay on my wanted list. Pun and Prince, we're walkin on kings, like a son-of-a-bitch. Fuckin with this is hazardous to amateur battlers. Average niggas get lost in the course of embarassment. Of course you dont have a chance, I'm the boss in your emminence. Get tossed in the ambulance with the force of an avalanche. I'll torture your fragile ass with rhetorical paragraphs. For all of you that'll laugh at a historical aftermath!. I come equipped, my tongue and lips are like a hundred clips. Look behind you, I'll blind you like when the sun eclipse. Ain't no second chances, I glance at niggas. make em wet they pants. The chances are slim if Twinz done swing the rest of the ransome. The best and the champion, that means I'm far beyond. Dionne read my palm, told me to get on and put my army on. Come along, follow the Don, my motto and song. Live for tomorrow, cause today's almost already gone. Lets get on, split your belly with the Maschetti, long. Tears your arms of your shoulders, and tell you to, hold on. I know it's wrong, but it feels so right. I used to bust steel all night, but now I gotta deal, alright. Chorus *2X*. [Armageddon]. Fuck a Toe to Toe, give me a forty-four and a foe to blow. To make it more dramatic, I quote Jehovah holding the scroll. Open your skull, show you shit you ain't supposed to know. Break the world in half and spit the ocean from coast to coast. (Just to let you know) That I'm zone coasted. And play the visuals from the top of my verse back in slow-motion. Assassinate the Pope with no emotions. So why should I hesitate to crush a campaign like I wasn't votin?. My brain floatin away, above you niggas like I make time pause. Checkin my Rollie watch my diamond Roman digits. Golden riches, better hold em bitches. Cause we robbin niggas way before. the translation of Holy Scriptures. I was Armageddon before the motion picture. The last nigga to drop his verse and have the globe shiftin. My Squad's hard and far from Puritans. Robbin and killin men like we proud to be Americans."
the crack attack,"Yea, uhh. ""I bet you thought I left you hangin"". Yea yea, yeah. ""I bet you thought I left you hangin"". Terror Squad again.. long overdue baby. ""I-I-I bet you thought I left you hangin"". Don Cartagena, bring you the best in hardcore hip-hop. ""J-J-Joe Crack returns bangin"". Yea, uhh. Yo it's the Don of rap, sippin Cognac, hit you on the back. with the Mac (CLAK CLAK) slip you into cardiac. It's the art of rap at the illest form. from a killer's point of view, who thrives off the area jealous ones. You could tell it's on from my introduction. Hibernate the junction with killin somethin when you was barely dumpin. You ain't even nuttin to worry about. I flurried your mouth, with about thirty right in front of your house. Then I'm hurryin out in the expedition, professional hit men. The vestibule shit from the credible disses. Federals is listenin to my conversations, tapin all the songs I'm makin. Shakin down every ounce of my congregation. John Blazin, raisin the stakes, changin your fate. Tied up in my basement with a gauge in your face. Make no mistake, that's how I do my thing. Blow out a lot of brains, I'm sayin, it's not a game. ""Take these words home and think it through. Or the next rhyme I write might be about you"" -- Mobb Deep. (repeat 4X). Uhh, uhh, yea. Joe Crack takin a L and make Tone roll over in his grave, never that. T.S. got his dreams and discourage the brave, remember that. I been bustin guns since the infamous days of leather hats. Varsity sweaters with big letters black. Pushin the illest whips down fifty-fifth. where killers riff, without havin to split Phillies and sniff. And Willies who shift jobs from Chili willin to leave you stiff. Fulfillin my biggest wish, in this illegal shit. Quarter Maris stay slugger with karats, never offered marriage. When my corpse is carried my moms'll get all my cabbage. Terror Squad is savage, draped in the finest of fabrics. Floss like it's a habit, eight shot up in my Louis baggage. You knew we knew we had you, lay half your crew in gravel. Caught you slippin with your Boo and started shootin at you. Out of captivity, left Relativity. Now we on the Big-ger Beat, Terror Squad trilogy, what?. ""Take these words home and think it through. Or the next rhyme I write might be about you"" -- Mobb Deep."

the hidden hand,"[Fat Joe]. Yea, time to educate the youth (Speak on it God). Cause if we won't, then who will? (True). Terror Squad style, yo. (Speak on it God). Yo, I was a wild adolescent, blessed with the foul essence. Messin around with the wrong crowd, I learned my lesson. Stressin all the things that I have not. I pray to God I get my Uncle out the crack spot. I hear mad shots, homicide come and play Matlock. but never crack the case cause the defendant's a bad cop. You feel me fam? The devil's got a plan. That's why Farrakhan formed a Million Man up in Washington. The Hidden Hand even planned this man. Have me goin hand to hand, killin my own clan. But now I understand and see the big picture. Fuck cryin about the struggle, I teach you how to get richer. [Cuban Link]. Shit is a hassle in this rotten apple, kids robbin coppin capsules. Rockin tattoos, boppin with ankles locked in shackles. Got the cops joggin at you, spittin rounds of clips, they down wit it. New clowns'll make you feel as if the Bill of Rights is counterfeit. Now it's been written that all men are equal, but then it's legal. when they beat us and treat us as if we're different people. We go for delf, fuck the cop's health. I'd rather drop shelf and let off shots until my Glock melts. Cause God dealt us a helpless hand, they made us sell this land. so the palest man could build a selfish plan. You know we can't trust the government, cause Uncle Sam is smugglin. drugs for us to hustle all the stuff for him. Even McGruff is in it, gettin a percentage. Takin advantage, punishin just blacks and hispanics. [Big Punisher]. My heart is cold as ice, so I know I'm sheist, Big Pun was the kid. that no one liked, my whole life, is one big roll of the dice. Payin a price twice as expensive as white kids. Destined for Riker's not knowin my existance was priceless. IT'S LIKE THIS, my soul was lifeless, I earned stripes. fightin the nicest in the crisis I slice em in half and make em dash. like hyphens, invitin any rapper to Clash With the Titan. The writing's like fighting cause rappers be biting like Tyson. I'm hypein the crowd, keepin em Loud like my label. I'm proud I'm able to lift from the bowels of the ghetto. I found me a little sanity inside a career and a family. No more wars and renderin tears to insanity. So keep the salary and tear the mic, cause I love it. There's my life, you judge it, fuck it Seis, I don't want it. [Triple Seis]. I'm a Dominican, stranded in New York like Filligan. Don't wanna get locked up in the pen again. But here they come, the faggots and cuffs, searchin for guns. Turnin they ride on the side of the curb to see who runs. They authorize the beast to walk the streets holdin heat. Four deep, we puff production, my cheek, you know my steez. Fuck the police, usin ""probable cause"" to break laws. Behind the badge you try to cover up your racial war. I got somethin for you boys in blue. The system poisoned you, blew your cover, now what you supposed to do?. I never let the faggot pull the trig first. It won't be no American flag over my hearse. What's worse, you know they disperse for bucks. So take caution in the streets cause our protection sucks. [Armaggedon]. This dude, he had the darkest pads. Who dressed up in the heart of brash. Forever talkin trash. How he stacked niggaz to almanac. Gunshots to corner four police informants. Stood like he modeled the latest fashions, sidewalk sideshow performance. He raised the pull of grace, a razor blew his face. Force calm the ?sere? plus a pack of the ?dunga dun? laced with toothpaste. Life ain't to be gambled son, you could get trampled. by people that act more like animals than mammals high off enamel. That's what his poppa said whose locked for droppin Akmed. in the candy store robbery probably to get his veins fed. He ain't listen, he became a braindead cocaine head. Older Mexicans knew, they killed him eatin ?bagualitos?. But hey little kids, don't follow these dopes. [Prospect]. What? Uh-huh, yea I can dig that. They call me Prospect, I just came back from ?. Had this track on pause, now I'm back on course. It's lost on the Ave, tryin to take my life from the past. Get this legal cash, ? without dad. Kinda sad how he got dragged down to negativity. Only if he had one love, trust for liberty. this world would be a better place, get what it takes. in a race to racism replace the snake in em. Bad ones, want to spend lives and discriminate. I'm tryin to keep this positive vibe, and from that. I generate to the top, like Puffy won't stop. I'm mature now, with one knot, from tryin to get locked. And to the shorties on the block, tryin to twist 40 tops. Get your act together, do some carpentry with a Black n Decker. And stop speedin like a Kawasaki. From my life, to your life, I'm touchin everybody Twinz watch me. Everything we speak is the truth. From Prospect to Munroe, here in a hot second. The whole world run know, everything we speak is the truth. Terror Squad. ."

See I just didn't give a fuck - and if you had a C-skin. a leather bomber, you was gettin stuck (word!). That was the way it was. One day I went to visit my aunt, and stuck up my cuz. See shit was fucked up back then. No matter what the fuck I did I never had no ends. And my moms was on walfare. Aiyyo I knew I had a father, but the nigga was never there. So what the fuck was I to do. I'm sick and tired of bein the bummiest nigga out the crew. I gotta get mine, I gotta get cash. I see an old man, I'm gonna rob him with the quick-fast. Give me your motherfuckin loot, papi. I'm gonna get paid, and can't a damn thing stop me. See, I'm tired of this poor shit. And who the cops? Well they can suck my motherfuckin dick. Cause all them niggaz ever do is harass. That's why I get glad when I hear somebody smoked that ass (*gunshot*). Just to let ya know how I feel. Word em up, the fuckin shit is real. Hey yo, it's real. Chorus: (*cuts ""Down on the reel to reel""*). Aiyyo the shit is real. Aiyyo it's real. Word up, the shit is real. [Fat Joe]. Now I'm sixteen and there's a brand new scene. I'm makin mad loot, gettin paid off the dope fiends (word). Keep the shit in check, in order. and my main man Tone was fuckin everybody else's daughter. See everybody knew in town. that Joe and Tone had shit locked down. And a nigga wouldn't test me. It seems like every other day the fuckin cops arrest me (yea!). But the shit will never stick. I make one phone call and be out like quick. Cause Uncle Dan had my back. And now niggaz gettin jealous cause they know I'm livin fat. Talkin shit around the way and on the block. But never in my face, cause they knew I packed a glock. And my crew is mad deep. A bunch of crazy Puerto Ricans, so aiyyo don't sleep (word!). And all you bitch ass niggaz know the deal. Check it out, the fuckin shit is real. Hey yo, it's real. Chorus: (*cuts ""Down on the reel to reel""*). Aiyyo it's real. The fuckin shit is real. Yeah.. aiyyo it's real. [Fat Joe]. Check it out. Let me let ya know why I made this song (why?). Brothers can't deal with the real, word is bond. I'm sick and tired of these fake ass niggaz. sayin that they catchin bodies when they never pulled a trigga. I know your style, I've seen it before. You wear an army suit, now you think you're hardcore. Drinkin on your 40's, smokin on your blunts. Can't afford a chain so you wear gold fronts, yeah. You're fakin the funk, kid. And you'll be gettin it up the ass if you ever did a fuckin bid. It's time to separate the real from the phony. The name is Fat Joe, punk, act like you know me. I come equipped with the ruff shit. Nowadays I can't believe the bull rappers come up with. And all ya bitch-ass niggaz know the deal. Check it out, the fuckin shit is real. Hey yo, it's real.

the wild life,"[Fat Joe]. Yeah, uh, dat gangsta shit!. Shout to my homies out west. The hoo-bangers!. Mack Deezy for Sheezy. All my niggas in the Bronx. Holdin them corners down. Ya heard? Get it right!. [Verse 1: Fat Joe]. Joe cracks back, been a long time comin. No mean to disrespect but a lot of y'alls frontin. Shook niggas, me and the Squad done took niggas. Flex drop bombs but you seem to overlook niggas. We the nicest in the game, even lifers know the name. Throwin blows like Tyson when he rained. Fuck the ice in the range, I'm tryin to get stocked. Generate mil's so I can buy back my old block. It's like the rap games far from the crack game. Niggas is mad lane(How come?)They act tame. You can tell from my scars life is hard. Shot down in broad day life in front of my Mom's. And the feds never give up, they tryin to kill us. I'm stressed drinkin VSOP tearin my liver. Livin my life like I don't care. I'm out to take the throne. My mom's in the window hopin I'ma make it home. The streets is funny peeps'll kill you. over piece of money, 'specially if you sleepin. And don't keep it gully, I'm from the Bronx. Home of niggas that'll stomp you senseless. Dont resent this, I'm knowin that you comprehend this. Its the wild life, niggas done lost they mind. Its the wild life, everybody wanna floss and shine. But could you blame them?. Niggas is brought up with anger. Pops in jail, Moms get tossed up on stangers. [Prospect]. Yo it's the wild life. Where peeps takin life for keeps. Yo it's the wild life. We all brawlin, fight to eat. The enemies and the D's lurk through N.Y.C. Some of them on they back lookin up like ""Yo, why me?"". [Verse 2: Prospect]. I never really had a pops. But who the fucks to blame. He did 13, and wonder why the steets my name. And heat's my game, cause I'm the type. To leak your frame, give you a slap. With the cast, you can meet my pain. Defeat I bring, to the nicest rapper you know. I aint a killer but I still might clap at you though. You for real here, niggas be followin with steps. I made my own moves, so the tokers, could swallow they breath. Acknowledge the best, and do what I did. Like I'm blessed, 7 days in a coma. This is life after death. I'm in it to win, ya heard?. From beginning to end, you could get shot. even though you once considered a friend. Sometimes my minds driven to win. Tryin to scare society. But cant slip again cuz my lil' man relyin me. Everyday I put through a test. But still progress. I'm tryin to climb hills. And tryin to make me kill for less. Yo its the wild life. Where peeps takin life for keeps. Yo its the wild life. We all brawlin, fight to eat. The enemies and the deeds lurk through N.Y.C. Some of them on they back lookin up. Like ""Yo, why me?"". [Xzibit]. Yo its the wildlife. Straight kidnappin and carjackin. Yo its the wildlife. Nigga fuck scrappin, we all packin. I'ma smash on anybody disrespectin the turf. Sraight to the dirt. We niggas known for puttin in work. [Verse 3: Xzibit]. I make it all go down right. In front of your face. Another life goes to waste. For names sake of the paper chaser. It aint safe here, the bright lights cablide you. Mix sedica, swollow you whole. They cant find you. Worst thing is walkin these streets. I need clarity, peace and prosperity. Is never gon' see, so niggas with beef. Niggas bumpin they gums and teeth. Straight to the police. Tryin to plant us six feet deep. But I aint goin for that. My shit clap through your starter cap. Pull your socks back, we aint runnin from nothin. Comin from nothin, makes you struggle harder for somethin. Shit is disgusting, you can even trust who you fuckin. The wild life! Colder the nights. You niggas aint nice, put yo money where yo mouth is. And roll the dice, puffin canibus and tiva. With the Don Cartagena, believe a nigga. When I say, dont make me have to spray ya. Yo its the wildlife. Straight kidnappin and carjackin. Yo its the wildlife. Nigga fuck scrappin, we all packin. I'ma smash on anybody disrespectin the turf. Sraight to the dirt."
thicker than blood,"[Fat Joe]. I don't give a fuck about you duke. The truth is you be talkin shit with no proof. Still pussy after all that loot. Smack you right in front of your troops. You know how we do, pakinamac in the back of the coup. You loose, that's why you gon get it. Me and my squad is known to set it. Front guard and get ahead of this. It's pathematic how you run the streets. I bring guns to beef, while you send your son to speech. We a hundred deep and stay bustin the heat. Puttin niggas to sleep, in six feet sweaps. Joe the Don, ready for war when it's on. Come on, tell me who can hold it down this long. I'm strong that my name will live on when I'm gone. Word bond, I conquer shit like Genghis Khan. You been warned by the Terror Squadrans, ghetto sergeant. Next time I see that ass in carter the'll be no pardon. [Chorus x2: Armageddon]. Terror Squad pop, ain't nothin thicker than blood. I sware to God all my thugs die quicker than love. But life flex again, I'll be back livin it up. And If drop, you don't stop, keep lickin ya slugs. [Prospect]. Aiyo, it started off since 1979. A young nigga that was born and destined to shine. I've been thru ups and downs, cash tellin cracks. Bustin rounds, I saw buyers get hit up in crossfires. Bosses retire, expired by hitmans for hire. Wines strictly for bitches, suckin dicks to get higher. In this world the more that you lust. Fake ones that do fake shit, only a dummy you trust. How can I have love walkin on this earth with dust. Hence the birth it was bug, I fiend search for the drugs. And being punched supply the guns, when we curse you with slugs. But fuck it, everything ain't goin to work for you cuz. I got to make these pesos in case lobes, niggas ya make fold. Like envelopes and take notes. Had an ash runnin the dash like JJ Stokes. When the gun smoke, I quote another Murder He Wrote. It's thug emotions that I'm lettin off my chest. Turn of the leader, tress and jess be the best like T.S.. I'm in for life, ready to fight, my twins is hype. Better get it right, or get dented on sight. [Chorus x2]. [Armageddon]. I'm just tryin to figure what right,. kinda hard to pull a trigger polite. Scriptures of right can't discribe how I'm sick in this life. Pick up a mic and end it all in a session. Blow my brains out, and let the kid sour the rezin. I told ya niggas my brain was way above ya heads. Niggas be slumpin dead, so snappin they spines. Tryin to see what I fed, peep what I read in the eyes of my rival. It might surprise, but jealously sometimes is the only way for survival. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a piece of shit. Street fires increased a bit, I might body a nigga for at least a nick. Quipin the forty power, 24 hours of Armageddon. The fly terrorist, chapter of sporty cowards. Holy sours, clense my sins thru repentence. A center of attention when the name of my enemy is mentioned. A nigga inchin, must be but stinkin how my squad run. Cuz I ain't dyin till my fam straight, sware on my godson. [Chorus x2]"
think about it,"[1st Verse]. New York. Yeah we G'ed up. Act up. Clap the back of your knees up. Packin' the Mack in the back of the Beemer. Taxin' your cash and you asking to ease up. I want to rock now. Comply or get shot down. I know. You goin hire some cops now. Coca. Sun down to sun up. Kily Cartel use to be a runner. D Boy. Stamp bricks with smiley faces. Show you how to turn that powder to a hundred acres. Let's get it. Thank god for making crack raw. Now how you want it. The window or the chainsaw. Crack. Yeah I'm nice with the knife game. Ice pick change your life with one strife man. Too much rappin and we don't rat. We do it for them trap stars serving them packs. And e'er nigga know from way back to Houston. Joes a go when push comes to shootin'. The four four will loose more then just a tooth man. A hundred shots will rip your top like where the fuck the roof went. [Chorus]. I think he said something. Bring 'em back to me. I let the chopper groove. And let the Mack boogie. You better think about it. Boy you better think about it. You better think about. Boy you better think about it. I got no papers on all them guns. So when I pull 'em out your ass best run. Crack. You better think about. Boy you better think about it. You better think about. Boy you better think about it. [2nd Verse]. This ain't for the niggaz hob nobbing in closets. This is for them niggaz that suppling their projects. Man catch beef say my nigga I got this. Right in broad day twist a nigga then pop shit. I ain't playin'. I got big guns. My niggaz barely speak English. They'll lift son. The strip is mine. Naw, you ain't eatin' here. I run this shit. At least in some recent years. And y'all know who rep the streets most. Terror squad we put the E in East coast. So be easy like T I said. Or them things ull pop up like a Chia pet. Or Chi Ali or any given clapper. Exorcist style get your shit spun backwards. Them pistols ull go your brain go's splatter. A minute ago you said you'd get at us. Now why you have to go talk like that. Get ya body outlined with the chalk like that. I guess he must a thought I'd a fought them cats. The oldest rule in the books. you should have brought them gats. [Chorus]"
triplets,"*phone conversation*. [Fat Joe]. Since day one, niggaz died at the Don. cause I was anon, now Terror Squad is a thousand beyond. Not only strong but we loyal and royally treated. Quadripalegic any squad that wanna squab when I'm heated. Not even God can believe it, the way we regulate. and levitate, heavyweight niggaz like they was featherweight. Every day I do the same thang. It's the paid game, to amputate more body parts than gangrene. [Big Punisher]. Yo this a man's game, it's a shame how niggaz truly mock me. But who can stop me, from breakin niggaz off like Fujiyaki?. My crew's probably the only niggaz that really live the lyrics. Niggaz really fear us, they must of heard we really killers. We're Philly fillers and 40 guzzlers with millimeters. and army cutters Willie niggaz that laundry dollars. I'm Nostradamus predictin the future, my position is crucial. with a known friction obsession addicition to shoot ya *BLAM*. [Fat Joe]. Hey yo I'm better off dead than givin the feds the satisfaction. Subtractin my freedom have me missin in action. [Big Punisher]. A fraction of y'all, raw like Colt to the jaw. The rest of y'all, fear war, and couldn't follow out the protocol. [Fat Joe]. Joe the God is like the angel of death, strangle your neck. That's why Don Cartagena's the name your respect. [Big Punisher]. I bring the pain to your chest, that'll make you question your threshold. Flex like you been forced, still ""bless you"" like a chest cold. We destined to explode, that's why I stay on flip mode. Your dick rode me long enough Dunn, now you can let go. Chorus: Big Punisher. Every man in this world has a destiny. Can't no other rapper in this game get the best of me; unless you just. def dumb and blind you know the pedigree. Better get ready because I'm dead in the middle of little Italy. [Fat Joe]. Uh, uh, uh, yo!. Somebody hold me back, Joey Crack's about to load the gat. and blow this track to the stars like the zodiac. Hold me back this max n better, out for the ass n cheddar. But fast cash don't last forever. [Big Punisher]. I asked the felons, if I don't stay wrapped in leathers. and hats with feathers, I got all the ostriches actin jealous. Track the trailers in chrome black Cateras. Two hundred inch Mickey Thompson's, flown back from Paris. [Prospect]. Dat dats the illest, these body tracks make a rap killings. Others is trying to stack billions out in crack buildings. My destiny was to shine, ? to climb. Especially in time, with the recipe in mind. From the jump start, they ain't have to pump hard in this. I was a part of this, and marvelous stats, it wasn't hard to miss. And yo, I had to burn cats like arsonists and still continue. Whose on my menu? A record deal they couldn't lend you. I had to burn my glock and earn my spot. The time flew by, had to turn my clock. and start with a new resume, not really that bitch named Des'ree. She ain't really my dream there's a better way -- what?. Prospect'll have to collect dough. Dialin 905 to L-A-X with somethin I was tryin to drive. A life that's trife for what I wore in the fuckin ?. A thug in pain, I swear to my little cousin's grave. Chorus 1X. [Big Punisher]. Every man in this world has a destiny. Can't no other rapper in this game get the best of me; unless you just. def dumb and blind you know the pedigree. Better get ready because I'm dead in a minute if you're ?."

Did my eyes decieve me. Was she suckin' three pee-pee's. Caught it all on tape so I could watch it late on T.V.. Couldn't wait to beep me. Started in the car shorty caught the quick train from the Trinity stars. Big Joe'll railroad. Any frail hoe. Have a bitch scream and yell throwin' elbows. Now who the hell knows. Why these girls fuck for cell phones. Turnin' tricks for material shit. Now bust it, You wanna hit it gotta pay top dollar. These chics is hott rodders. Wit grips like Rottwilers. But why bother. Picture me payin' a fee. I'll just play like Akinyle and fuck these hoes for free. (Chorus). Verse 3-Charli Baltimore. Picture B-More on the floor on all fours. mind must've lost yours. never been tossed. Tour thats what I do for ones. Not whore baby thats what I do for fun. Now I dread that I gave you head.

Fat Joe, bringin forth the illest motherfuckers. in this whole rap game. Hey yo Armageddon, let these motherfuckers know. [Armageddon]. You look, I look, you invite it, I took. I forever wearin it, you know stone cold crook. What's truth, what's lie? Who's people, who spy?. It's life and death, choose live or die. Ultimates who made em why do we even exist?. When we die is there heaven or is it total blackness?. For any touch there's a feeling. Touch and y'all felt. We can exchange shots, until our chambers melt. There's mad tension in the air (mad tension in the air). over one man's stare, you wanna dare, yo Crack. Eject the Czech from the glove compartment. Lay out the lead spray, and flame him up like arson. It's dangerous business. Opposites, these strangers be bendin opposites. So put your face in mine, best brace your spine. Cause opposites may attract, but they don't combine. My impact so fat, you feel your vertabrates grind. Now delayed second thoughts run through your mind. When my slugs connect, and strike your major arteries. When my fists connect, they causin major injuries. What you know Junior? You not evil. [Fat Joe].

My skills {undecipherable} puffin boom in Hell. I doom the world like I was God and throw my gun away. Then snatch the moon out the sky, and blow the sun away. Me and my brothers play hardball. Strictly hardcore, lyrics til I'm finished breakin God's laws. My job's raw but I gotta do it - I'm feelin high then buddhaed. so you might get shot and lose a lot of fluid. The spot I blew it at an early age, ever since the curly braids. I would earn a wage with the thirty gauge. There's dirty ways to get paid if you got the balls. Just load the glock and cause the hardest cop to drop his drawers. Don't stop or pause, let the shotty go up his butt. to finish up, punchin body blows and uppercuts. [Fat Joe]. The South Bronx is the wrong place to visit. I don't know an MC who has enough balls to diss it. Whether rain or shine, we be bustin out nines. Hey yo Keith Nut, hit em with that ill type rhyme. [Keith Nut]. Yo, I cause damage, rap's redhanded bandit. Well I'll be god damnit, I kick ass like I'm yo' parents. Prepare for the slaughter when my brain is out of order. Got kicked out my church cause I got caught fuckin my preacher's daughter. Menace like Dennis on the M.I.C.. You best run son, I'm sendin emcees up shit's creek. So don't sleep, cause I creep, on New York streets. like I'm a big fat dick, wack emcees is ass-cheeks. Yo, I'm that nigga that'll kidnap yo' kids. Take em home, fuck em good, then send em back to you in bandages. You lose, cause I got, the ill street, and still keep. the toast close, and rep-a, resent-a, the East coast. So watch your back black, Bronx niggaz don't play. If you ever fake jax, I'll slit yo' throat like O.J.. [Fat Joe]. Yeah, that's my motherfuckin crew. Straight out the South Bronx. The livest motherfuckin corners of the Bronx. Keepin in realer, my motherfuckin nigga Keith Nut. Armageddon the Reddin. My nigga Big Dog Punisher. Straight out the Full Eclipse Camp. All you motherfuckers know the times, yeah. Watch your motherfuckin back. Blow out the back of your domepiece."

I earn my respect then quiet as kept. Yeah, guard your grill if you try to catch wreck. Smack the back of your neck, and take your YouthCore check. I make more dough than Gregory Peck. Never have to raise a fist, I keep my stunts in check. I play a nigga out, like a Las Vegas dealer. Living in the light, just like Karen Wheeler. So back up, and take a good look, because you should look. at what a good cook, can do without a fuckin cookbook. I don't sniff coke, and I don't smoke coolies. Even Italians say I'm one cool moolie. But niggaz call me JoJo. I'm quick to stick a chick, cause I kick the Willie BoBo. on the Northside, on the Southside, on the Westside. You can't budge me nigga, even the best tried. to pull a fast one, but you know what happened to the last one?. (What?) He got his motherfuckin ass done. (Yeah!) So step up, front, I'm not a bitch-ass chump. Chicks by the clicks, cause my pockets got the mumps. See I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with. Don't try to play yourself, cause you'll be stuck with. a motherfuckin ice pick right through the cheek. I'm leavin crab niggaz, layin in the street. I won't 'fess, walk around with a vest. Knockin niggaz off, cause I could care less. You want a fair one, FORGET IT. And your girlfriend, yo I let my man hit it. So save the bluff, you know you ain't tough (yeah).
