everythang's corrupt,"(Intro: x2). Everythangs corrupt, everythangs fucked up. Everythangs by the bout' to buck me shit out of luck. Verse 1:. Go to school, the teacher wanna fuck the students. Go to church, my preacher turned to prostitution. The prosecution never read my files. That evil ass judge fell asleep at my trial. This shit is wild, chickens get as sick as the cows. Birds fallin out the sky, fish dyin' in piles. Its fishy, politicians smell like my bowels. Talkin' that shit, really crampin' my styles. I got many, now I'm pinchin' pennies no doubt. I sqeezed Lincoln so hard, a fuckin' booger came out. Its a shame, I used to be on top of my game. They took the shirt off my back and replaced it with chains. I met Mr. Lee Harvey, from the tea party. He used to hate Obama til' he felt hurricane Charley. Lookin' for his FEMA check, it's gone with the wind. When em' dicks is in, you know the fix is in. (Hook: x2). For my birthday, buy me a politician. It's a shame that you got to dish yo' children. Everythangs corrupt, everythangs fucked up. Everythangs by the bout' to buck me shit out of luck. Verse 2:. Everythang's a scam, beat the next man. That's capitalism, they'll just build a new prison. For you slick ass niggas' that's tryin' to beat the system. Put you on the front line if you ain't re-enlisting. It's hot in hell's kitchen, get ready for the lynching. Brain-wash media, and puppet politician. Keep you out of position, out of commission. By medicine or food, that's not a decision. The 99 percent, is man tryin' to vent. Police grab my fuckin' arm, then they got bent. Now it's in a splint, I can't pay my rent. The interest on my credit card I ain't made a dent. The U.S mint, I heard they bout' to print. But it's fucked up cause' I won't see a cent. I'm sick of gettin' ignored, this wall I can't afford. I'm going to the pent, free room, free ward. (Hook x2). Outro:. It's wall of confusion, my niggas' they losin'. I know what ya' doin', they drug abusin'. My bitches be choosin', my music be oozin'. The thugs be cruzin', they love what ya' doin'. It's wall of confusion, my niggas' they losin'. I know what ya' doin', they drug abusin'. My bitches be choosin', my music be oozin'. The thugs be cruzin'"
it was a good day,"Just waking up in the morning gotta thank God. I don't know but today seems kinda odd. No barking from the dogs, no smog. And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog. I got my grub on, but didn't pig out. Finally got a call from a girl wanna dig out. Hooked it up on later as I hit the do'. Thinking will i live, another twenty-fo'. I gotta go cause I got me a drop top. And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop. Had to stop at a red light. Looking in my mirror not a jacker in sight. And everything is alright. I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night. Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all. Which court, are y'all playin basketball?. Get me on the court and I'm trouble. Last week fucked around and got a triple double. Freaking brothers everyway like M.J.. I can't believe, today was a good day. Drove to the pad and hit the showers. Didn't even get no static from the cowards. Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me. Saw the police and they rolled right past me. No flexin, didn't even look in a niggaz direction. as I ran the intersection. Went to $hort Dog's house, they was watchin Yo! MTV. Raps. What's the haps on the craps. Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em. Roll em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break em. With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven. Seven even back do' Joe I picked up the cash flow. Then we played bones, and I'm yellin domino. and now i am yelling dominoes. Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.. Today was a good day. Left my niggaz house paid. Picked up a girl been tryin to fuck since the twelve. grade. It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic. The Lakers beat the Supersonics I felt on the big. fat. fanny. Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny. And my dick runs deep so deep so deep. put her ass to sleep Woke her up around one. she didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun. Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting. Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel. motion. I was glad everything had worked out. Dropped her ass off, then I chirped out. Today was like one of those fly dreams. Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams. No helicopter looking for a murder. Two in the morning got the fat burger. Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp. And it read Ice Cube's a pimp. Drunk as hell but no throwing up. Half way home and my pager still blowing up. Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.. I got to say it was a good day.. (Ice Cube). Hey wait, wait a minute fool. Stop the shit. What the fuck am I thinking about?"

Rips are rippin', dogs are barkin'. Guppies all move over, let the shark in. Blood in the water, cuz in the water. Need to get out, nigga, was it a slaughter?. Fuckin' wit'chy'all niggas, tear in your drawers. This fire water put hair on your balls. This is a rebel without a pause. With three hoes like Santa Clause. Know all the pimp codes and the bylaws. Got enough paper, I could buy y'all. At the Bayou, I could buy you. Walkin' 'round here with a slave IQ. Better get smart or it's déjà vu. Back in the dark, nigga, chained to the ark, nigga, fuck.

Hatin' on shit ain't a revolution. Change this shit, fuck the lootin'. West side riders, I'm recruitin'. God is a teacher, I'm the student. Don't bite the apple, I'm rebootin'.

It's Mardi Gras every time I'm with my players. Alcohol all in the air. I run this shit, I am the mayor. You a crazy bitch, Princess Leia. Don't'cha know my truth is a dare?. It's the cyclops with the eye drops. Fuck these thots and Goldilocks. Bitches wanna go and drink all a nigga porridge. Don't ask me for a piece of pizza. Fold my arms and say, ""Bye Felicia"". Why the fuck you messin' with the creature?. Might wake up and fuckin' eat ya. Can hardly see ya 'cause of my shine. I'm legally blind. I'm outta my mind. Study my rhyme, I got the equation for any occasion. Black, white, brown, red, purple, or Asian. My fire water keep folks ablazin'. I got some shit that'll burn your stomach. Make you vomit, the dogs atomic. Please don't try to mix this with chronic. Niggas won't believe that you seen a comet, no. Fire water. I got that fire water. The shit I spit will get you lit.

Taking these halls and fillin 'em up. Some powder cake shit that's about to erupt. Ay y'all, I'm about to be stuck. Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?. In the hood, don't press your luck. Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up. [Chorus]. [Outro]. Every hood's the same [3X]. Every hood's the same [2X]. Stop trippin on it. Every hood's the same [3X].

fuck tha police,"[MC Ren as Court Officer]. Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect. Judge Dre presiding. In the case of N.W.A. vs. the Police Department;. prosecuting attourneys are: MC Ren, Ice Cube,. and Eazy-motherfuckin-E. [Dr. Dre as The Judge]. Order, order, order. Ice Cube, take the motherfuckin stand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth. and nothin but the truth so help your black ass?. [Ice Cube as Witness]. You god damn right!. [Dr. Dre]. Well won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?. [Ice Cube]. Fuck the police comin straight from the underground. A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown. And not the other color so police think. they have the authority to kill a minority. Fuck that shit, cause I ain't the one. for a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun. to be beatin on, and thrown in jail. We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell. Fuckin with me cause I'm a teenager. with a little bit of gold and a pager. Searchin my car, lookin for the product. Thinkin every nigga is sellin narcotics. You'd rather see, me in the pen. than me and Lorenzo rollin in a Benz-o. Beat a police out of shape. and when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape. To tape off the scene of the slaughter. Still gettin swoll off bread and water. I don't know if they fags or what. Search a nigga down, and grabbin his nuts. And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none. But don't let it be a black and a white one. Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top. Black police showin out for the white cop. Ice Cube will swarm. on ANY motherfucker in a blue uniform. Just cause I'm from, the CPT. Ounk police are afraid of me!. HUH, a young nigga on the warpath. And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath. of cops, dyin in L.A.. Yo Dre, I got somethin to say. {Fuck the police 4X}. [Cop] Pull your god damn ass over right now. [NWA] Aww shit, now what the fuck you pullin me over for?. [Cop] Cause I feel like it!. Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up. [NWA] Man, fuck this shit. [Cop] Aight smartass, I'm takin your black ass to jail!. [Dr. Dre]. MC Ren, will you please give your testimony. to the jury about this fucked up incident?. [MC Ren]. Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority. because the niggaz on the street is a majority. A gang, is with whoever I'm steppin. and the motherfuckin weapon is kept in. a stash box, for the so-called law. Wishin Ren was a nigga that they never saw. Lights start flashin behind me. But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me. But that shit don't work, I just laugh. because it gives em a hint, not to step in my path. For police, I'm sayin, ""Fuck you punk!"". Readin my rights and shit, it's all junk. Pullin out a silly club, so you stand. with a fake-assed badge and a gun in your hand. But take off the gun so you can see what's up. And we'll go at it punk, and I'ma fuck you up!. Make you think I'ma kick your ass. but drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast. I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime. But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time. Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me. or any asshole, that threatens me. I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope. Takin out a cop or two, they can't cope with me. The motherfuckin villian that's mad. With potential, to get bad as fuck. So I'ma turn it around. Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound. {*BOOM, BOOM*} Yeah, somethin like that. but it all depends on the size of the gat. Takin out a police, would make my day. But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say. {Fuck the police 4X*}. [Cop] {*knocking on the door*}. [NWA] Yeah man, what you need?. [Cop] Police, open now. [NWA] Aww shit. [Cop] We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest. [Cop] Get down and put your hands up where I can see 'em. (Move motherfucker, move now!). [NWA] What the fuck did I do, man what did I do?. [Cop] Just shut the fuck up. and get your motherfuckin ass on the floor. (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!). [NWA] But I didn't do shit. [Cop] Man just shut the fuck up!. [Dr. Dre]. Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand. and tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?. [Eazy-E]. I'm tired of the motherfuckin jackin. Sweatin my gang, while I'm chillin in the shack, and. shinin the light in my face, and for what?. Maybe it's because I kick so much butt. I kick ass -- or maybe cause I blast. on a stupid-assed nigga when I'm playin with the trigger. of any Uzi or an AK. Cause the police always got somethin stupid to say. They put out my picture with silence. Cause my identity by itself causes violence. The E with the criminal behavior. Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor. Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?. A sucker in a uniform waitin to get shot. by me, or another nigga. And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger. (MC Ren: Size ain't shit, he's from the old school fool). And as you all know, E's here to rule. Whenever I'm rollin, keep lookin in the mirror. And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a. dumb motherfucker with a gun. And if I'm rollin off the 8, he'll be the one. that I take out, and then get away. While I'm drivin off laughin this is what I'll say. {*""Fuck the police"" -> cut and scratched 4X*}. The verdict. [Dre] The jury has found you guilty of bein a redneck,. white bread, chickenshit motherfucker. [Cop] But wait, that's a lie! That's a god damn lie!. [Dre] Get him out of here!. [Cop] I want justice!.

I know the streets will shed tears for me. The end. All I get is motherfuckin' love in these streets. To most of these tricks I'm a motherfuckin' treat. What's beef? I ain't got no beef. See all that bitchin'? It taste like chicken. And all these chickens? They get plucked. And nobody wants to see the volcano erupt. I'm down with Daz 'cause everythang is Kurupt. I'm celebrated every time I pull up. You hella hated, every time you look up. I'm elevated to rapper's deluxe. They love me, dawg, 'cause I'm one of a kind. This is God's plan, homie, it ain't mine. See, this ain't about dyin', it's all about shinin'. It's all about climbin' a hill full of diamonds. I know that you feel it, I know that you felt it. 'Cause a nigga gon' live 'til a nigga can't help it. When the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone. I know the streets will shed tears for me. (They love me, dawg). When my story is over and my song is done. (They love me, dawg). I know the streets will shed tears for me. The end. Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters. All I got is mother fuckers tellin' me I'm the greatest. All I got is those fly ass suits and gators. Nobody servin' Cube but maids and waiters. Nobody tryin' to take my life. All these bitches tryna do is replace my wife. But you hoes ain't cold enough to fuck with Ice. Like Kim she'll run circles 'round you bitches twice. Now, it might get funky but it won't get ugly. Niggas might not like me but they still love me. Niggas might talk shit, they whisper and huddle. 'Cause they know my rebuttal might leave a puddle. Now the streets is talkin' until they see me walkin' up the block, then all the bullshit stop. Anything I do, don't take it personal 'cause when a nigga gone, that shit ain't reversible. When the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone. I know the streets will shed tears for me. (They love me, dawg). When my story is over and my song is done. (They love me, dawg). I know the streets will shed tears for me. The end. I'm the bastard that spit the acid. Fuck a funeral home and a casket. Fuck a funeral song and a procession. Keep God on your dome and count your blessings. Keep the hood in your heart but Heaven on your mind. Shake 'em up and roll seven every time. Pick 'em up, yup, stick 'em up. Every time you see me got a different color cup. This ain't about dyin', it's all about livin'. It's all about makin' everyday Thanksgivin'. It's all about givin', about stayin' driven. It ain't about you, it's about these children. So when a nigga die, stop cryin' and ventin'. Will somebody in here bump George Clinton?. Will somebody in here hug my fam?. Don't worry about me, you know where I am. When the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone. I know the streets will shed tears for me. (They love me, dawg). When my story is over and my song is done. (They love me, dawg). I know the streets will shed tears for me. The end"

Hittin all night long. Just like me on the black and white ivory. Gettin six on artillery, you don't want to see a G. Break yo' ass like dishes. Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes. Runnin from Lennox, up at Venice. They wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace. But that ain't poppin, ain't no stoppin. Fo'-hoppin, ass droppin, Coupe Deville. My truth can, ill - fool I got skills. So, back on up 'fore I check that chin. Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'. You gets no love and I thought you knew it. Fool, you know how we do it. Comin from the West Side. West Side, comin from the West Side. [Ice Cube]. Chillin with the homies, smellin the bud. Double parked and I'm talkin to Dub. about who got a plan, who got a plot. whom got got, and who got shot. Cause everybody knows that he got the info. Crazy Toones hangin out the window. Fool I got them bomb-ass tapes. Da Lench Mob, _planet of the Apes_. I'm down with Eiht, and _watts Up_. Kam is solo, they got nuts. When Ice Cube write a sentence. I want ""The Bomb,"" just like George Clinton. S-K-D is down to catch a body. Put on _knee Deep_, we'll turn out your party. You gets no love and I thought you knew it. Fool, you know how we do it. You know how we do it. [Ice Cube]. Jack B. Nimble, and Jack B. Quick. if you wanna jack me on a lick, cause. I'm that fool from South Central. You think you stuck yourself, with a number 2 pencil. That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass. With ""Mo' Bounce to the Ounce"" in the dash. Mash up, Ve-nice, headed for the West. Everything is great, slow down for the dip. On a 100 and 8th and keep mashin. Don't drink and drive to keep the fo' from crashin. Stashin a glock and I thought you knew it. You know how we do it. Comin from the West Side, West Side. Nuttin but a West Side. It's hittin on the West Side"
get off my dick and tell yo bitch to come here (remix),"[Flavor Flav] Stay off his dick!. Nigga, some don't think I can flow, so here we go. to a new track, to show the wack, that I can throw. styles that show up, I blow up and blast here. Niggaz still trippin off the shit I said last year. About a bitch is a bitch is a hoe is a slut. And I don't like niggaz on my nuts!. So I dedicate this one to the groupie. And the Charlie, all on my Snoopy. Brothers keep askin, ""Ice Cube yo when will you bust"". They surround me and make a big fuss. Now I was taught, back on my block. That you don't ride on nobody's jock. for anything they do, FUCK him and his crew. Unless, you were gettin paid too!. I'm not saying this to diss each and every fan. Women you can ride, man be a man!. Shake my hand, and make it a FIRM shake. Say, ""Whattup Ice Cube?"" and then break. Cause if you're hangin there I'ma tell you loud and clear. Get off my my dick nigga, and tell your bitch to come here. * cut n scratch of Flavor Flav saying ""stay off his dick"". and Ice Cube saying ""all on my Snoopy"" *. * cut n scratch of Flavor Flav saying ""yo yo check this out"". and Ice Cube saying ""I'ma tell you loud and clear"" *. [Ice Cube]. Motherfucker, back up off me. I'm not signin no autographs, I'm not givin no free t-shirts. And I'm not HAVIN none of this bullshit you're talkin. YouknowhatI'msayin?. (""Get off my dick nigga, and tell your bitch to come here""). I step into the club, to rub-a-dub. It seems like all the little hoes fall in love. with my money, cause yo about a year ago. I was just your ordinary average everyday crazy ass bro. But you know, I just can't be equal. Cause they know, I know a lot of famous people. But to a one-night stand, there's no sequel. Here's the pickle, pretend it's a popsicle. See for a fat booty, I do damage. They think I'm a star, so I take advantage. It's just another Ice Cube groupie test. She's a hoe cause they knew her at the front desk. Told her to meet me, at the room 110. And the bitch showed up, with her boyfriend. I let him in, all he could do was grin. He had a camera, a t-shirt, a pad and pen. He said, ""Yo Ice Cube, can you sign this?"". I only did it cause his bitch was the finest. She blew me a kiss and gave a bitter frown. Like - how can we get rid of this clown?. Me and her sat down, he got a little jealous. Cause his punk ass sat in the middle of us. And he asked me question after question. It felt like a motherfuckin interview session. Then his girl got up, I heard the do' shut. And he was still there, swingin from my nuts. I said, ""Get the FUCK out!"" and made it loud and clear. Get off my dick nigga, and tell your bitch to come here. I see me about ten mark ass motherfuckers fans. knock on the door, talkin about whassup?. Yo man, it was about a hundred and twenty dicks man. Niggaz start, niggaz comin out of hotel rooms. without no bitches!. They can get gaffled like they in a motherfuckin raffle. Punk ass. [Ice Cube]. Yo, I respect the respectable. If your girl is all on my dick, check the hoe. Say, ""Yeah that nigga he can rap fly. But you know, stars are up in the sky"". Cause all I got is hard dick, and bubblegum. Just ran out my last stick is where I'm comin from. I'm not tellin you to diss Mr. Ice Cube. Cause you know, I'm the one that can show and prove. Now groupie girls, I just make em wait. But the groupie boys, I can't tolerate. I hate it so much, I'ma start givin stitches. to the niggaz that's starin like bitches. Cause I'm not a fairy, a Mary or a faggot. Gimme the eye, I'll fly, and tag it. Now you see? Jockin ain't healthy. Cause you think that I'm young and I'm wealthy?. With juice, so I see you try to run behind. But I'ma tell you punk, you gets none of mine. Cause I was taught, see a fool, use a fool. by the niggaz who terrorized the old school. So don't try me or buy me a beer."

I find a good piece o' pussy, I go up in it. So if you're at a show in the front row. I'm a call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho. You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to. But that shows me, slut, you're composed to. a crazy muthafucker from tha street. Attitude legit cause I'm tearin up shit. MC Ren controls the automatic. For any dumb muthafucker that starts static. Not the right hand cause I'm the hand itself. every time I pull a AK off the shelf. The security is maximum and that's a law. R-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw. See, coz I'm the motherfuckin villain. The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin. that's takin place without a clue. And once you're on the scope, your ass is through.

Ruthless! Never seen like a shadow in the dark. except when I unload, see I'll get over the hesitation. and hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration. Give a little gust of wind and I'm jettin. But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin. So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!. You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker!.

24 wit an l,"*Originally appeared as a B-side to Cube's ""Check Yo Self"" single. 24 with an L, 24 years old and I got life in this motherfucker.... 24 with an L as I bail through the concrete, shit is kinda deep. Deep, deeper than Atlantis, you got to know who the man is. L.A. better known as Pelican's Bay. The ghetto bird's got the word from the stool pigeon. A bird in the hand can't beat a chicken. There ain't no warden (shit). Just broken glass fucking up my Jordans. Twice upon the time in the projects. I done got jacked for my Rolex. But I keep going, let it pass. Cause the swap meet got a sale on ski masks. And my little homie Kevin. Been carjacking since '87 (really doe). L.A. is like a jail cell. And I got 24 with an L. ""Get in that cell, nigger"" (Repeat 8x). Now, I made a little money, good. But I still want to live in the hood. But buying new fly shit. Is just like inviting ants to a picnic. There's just too many sets. And now I'm getting those kidnap threats. But who wanna get wet?. Cause I'll soak ya, you think I'm fat like Oprah. All I got is a little piece of nothing. And now you want to jack all the sudden. Rahter have me face down on the floor. Instead of that devil you work for. Motherfucking coward. And clowning my man cause he wants to go to Howard. Now I got a strap when I bail. Through the hood, 24 with an L. ""Get in that cell, nigger"" (Repeat 8x). 24 years, but see I got life. Sorry Mike, it does matter if you're black or white. Cause I'm up against the black and white. They spread my legs and grab my nuts tight. Niggas keep hitting me up. And bitches try to get a drop of nut. Asking me to dick this. So they can blow up, throw up from the morning sickness. Keep my shoulder on the wall like the county. Cause you buster-ass niggas can't clown me. South of pee go, that's where we go. Deep in a Regal, Desert Eagle. Sitting on my lap like a bitch with a gat. Westside's on the map. So if you want to scrap or even drop shells. 24 with an L."
a bird in the hand,"(Big Bird: Sesame Street). Hey look at this! I was cleaning out my nest. and I found a book of my old poetry. (Ice Cube). Fresh out of school cause I was a high school grad. gots to get a job cuz I was a high school dad. Wish I got paid like I was rappin' to the nation. but thats not likely, so here's my application. Pass it to the man at AT&T. Cuz when I was in school I got the a. e. e.. But there's no s. e. for this youngsta. I didn't have no money so now I have to hunch the. Back like a slave, thats what be happenin. but whitey says there's no room for the African. Always knew that I would boycott, jeez. but welcome to McDonalds can I take your order please. Gotta sell ya food that might give you cancer. cuz my baby doesn't take no for an answer. Now I pay taxes that you never give me back. what about diapers, bottles, and similac. Do I gotta go sell me a whole lotta crack. for decent shelter and clothes on my back?. Or should I just wait for help from Bush. or Jesse Jackson, and operation Push. If you ask me the whole thing needs a douch. a masengel what the hell cracker sale in the neighborhood. To the whorehouse bitches,. Miss porker, little joe or Todd Bridges. Or anybody that he know. so I got me a bird, better known as a kilo. Now everybody know I went from po' to a nigga that got dough. So now you put the feds against me. cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency. I'm never givin' love again. Cuz blacks are too fuckin broke to be republican. Now I remember I used to be cool. till I stopped fillin' out my W-2. Now senators are gettin' hired. and your plan against the ghetto backfired. So now you got a pep talk. but sorry, this is our only room to walk. Cause we don't want a drug push. But a bird in the hand is worth more than the bush. tell the politicians, the hustlers: live and let live (yeah)."

a gangsta's fairytale,"Intro: Little Russ, Ice Cube. [story-teller] Once upon a time, in the black part of the city. [young kid] Yo G, yo G you better get out of here man, 5-0. [door swings shut, car peels out]. [Russ] Yo Ice Cube, man. [Cube] What up man?. [Russ] Why you.... [Cube] What up?. [Russ] Yo Ice Cube man, why you always kickin the shit about the bitches. and the niggaz? Why don't you kick some shit about the kids, man? The. fuckin kids?!. [Cube] Word. Verse One: Ice Cube. Little boys and girls, they all love me. Come sit on the lap of I-C-E. And let me tell ya a story or two. About a punk-ass nigga I knew. Named Jack, he wasn't that nimble, wasn't that quick. Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick. Ran up the street cause he was piping hot. Met a bitch named Jill on the bus stop. Dropped a line or two, and he had the hoe. At that type of shit he's a pro. So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil nap. Dumb bitch, gave him the claps. Then he had to go see Dr. Bombay. Got a shot in the ass, and he was on his way. To make some money, why not?. Down on Sesame Street, the dope spot. There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe. Sold dope out the front, but in back, marijuana grew. For the man that was really important. Who lived down the street in a Air Jordan. Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes. Drove a 500 sittin on Lorenzoes. He broke out, Little Bo Peep, smoked out. Saw, her and her friends sellin sheepskins. [Little Bo Peep] Yo yo I got them sheepskins. Yo, my empty sheepskins. Yo baby, what's up with that?. Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock. Cinderella ain't home must be givin up the cock. I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course. Had a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin her dwarfs. Saw a fight over colors, too. Red Riding Hood, and Little Boy Blue. A bad influence? Yo I don't know. But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go. . Interlude: Little Russ. Yeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it. This is Little Russ in the house. Rock that shit homey, rock that shit!. [Well, you know the rest]. Verse Two: Ice Cube. Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. With a joint, drinkin some 8-ball. Three little pigs in a Coup de Ville. Lookin for, the wolf to kill. They're fucked up and they want revenge. Them and Humpty used to be friends. Now they're enemies cause he's a traitor. Pulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him. Cinderella hoeing for the fellas. And Mister Rogers is gettin mighty jealous. Of the cash that the pigs were makin. Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon. Cause Mister Rogers found out quick. That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits. They said that the motherfuckin wolf was next. So Mister Rogers better watch his step. So he let the wolf know. We're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho. Cause Cinderella is much too fast. Before twelve, givin up ass. Double barrels all loaded and cocked. As soon as they show, they gonna get popped. They bailed down Sesame Street and caught em. Little Boy Blue is up front givin orders. Little did they know Cinderella was a fink. She called the cops and got thrown in the clink. A bad influence? Yo, I don't know. But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the stories should go. Outro: Little Russ, Ice Cube. [Cube] Aiyyo man was that dope enough for you?. [Russ] Yeah you aight, you in the house. We outta here, seeeee-yaaaaa. [Cube] Yeah you better go home before I whoop your little bad ass. [Barney Rubble] Some bedtime story huh?. [Bugs Bunny] It's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't wanna live here"
a history of violence (insert),Blacks who ventured across the unmarked border. Were often attacked. By teenage members of the new gang. Called the spook hunters. One of a handful of white gangs active in this time. It was only natural for l. a. 's newest residents. To respond unkind. As white attacks started to increase. In the mid 1940's and late 1940's. Blacks started to organize their clubs. Really as a defensive mechanism. And the boss men or the business men. And the snyder boys and all these. Clubs in south l. a. really were just sorta defending. Themselves against. White violence that was coming from huntington park. And southgate. The demise of the black panthers in los angeles. Is said to be another. Blow to a generation of black teenagers. That witnessed many of it's role models. Assasinated throughout the 1960's. What I'm sayin in so many words. They shoulda let the panthers. Went on because there probably. Would never have been no crips and no bloods

On my way, to MLK. That the county hospital jack. Where niggaz die over a little scratch. Still sittin in the trauma center. In my back is where the bullet entered. Yo nurse I'm gettin kind of warm.

One hour done passed. Done watched two episodes of M*A*S*H. And when I'm almost through. They call my name and put me on ICU. Halfway dead. No respect and handcuffed to the bed. Now the trauma starts. Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart. So I begin the ass kissin. Just to get looked at by an overworked physician. Got the chills, but my temperatures 103. Only got a band-aid and an IV. That's when I start cussin. Police steady askin me who did the bustin. Why oh why can't I get help. Cause I'm black, I gots to go for self.

cave bitch,"Intro: Dr. Khalid Muhammed. Give me a black goddess sister I can't resist her. No stringy haired, blonde. hair, blue eyed, pale skinned buttermilk complexion. Grafted, recessive,. depressive, ironing board backside straight up and straight down. No. frills, no thrills, Miss six o'clock, subject to have the itch, mutanoid,. caucazoid, white cave bitch.... Verse One: Ice Cube. Ease back white bitch, I don't play that. Just because I got on my L.A. hat. Stalkin' walking in my big black boots. Is my jingle, now you want Mandingo. Big, black and handsome. I should hold your devil ass for ransome. Sorta like Patty Herst, but I'll burst first bitch. And you know what's worse. I'm coming from the land where the choppers roam. So phuck you bitch and your Coppertone. Stringy hair - no derrier - frontin' and fakin' with your silicone pair. Do I wanna phuck? Not hardly. That's kinda like Barbie phuckin' Bob Marley. It ain't gonna happen, I keep rappin'. Muthaphuck Teniell, but see I'm the Captain of this ship. And I'm true to the game. Y'all all look the same. Standin' by my backstage door, hopin' that'll switch. Spread out you little cave bitch. Verse Two: Ice Cube. Why everytime we get famous. You wanna play us like Andy and Amos?. The devil sent you to try and tame us. But you can't tame me, with no bitch named Amy. Lookin' for the dark meat. But ho, I ain't tryin' to go out like Barkely. Cuz everytime I turn on the TV. I see several brothers with she-devils. Smilin' cuz you out on a date. But sooner or later, the bitch'll yell rape. Soon as daddy found out you a jigaboo. He'll kill like he did Emmitt Till. Yah, he tried to kick bass. But the bitch probably threw it in his face. Sargent Bale ain't nothin' but a trick. Nasty as hell, stanky little cave bitch. . Verse Three:. Now don't think that I hate you. Cuz I won't date you, bitch I gotta stay true. You can be a fan, but don't expand. And try to get my dick in your hand. You better run to the minute man. Pale as snow, so act like y'know. Cuz if I slap it, flip it, and rub it like that. Yeah, it gotta be black. Plus yo ass too flat. I need a butt big enough that can clap. Rat-a-tat-tat. You can't get mine ho. I'd rather phuck an albino. Atleast I know, she's comin' from the Nubian. And not the Ku Klux Klan that you be in. And I don't give a fuck if your family is rich."

He's got nuts and plus the Don touch. and split the fine dutch, Starsky call Hutch. He's laid, with some sluts, up in some guts. Just back, in the cut, he thinks he's King Tut.

We'll pop those thangs if we have to. Give them thugs in the hood something to clap to. [Verse 1]. 8 in the morning, feds at my door. Fresh P Miller Jumpoff cross the marble floor. Out the back door, I try to make my escape. I almost dead but a dead nigga almost caught him a case. Either something good bout to happen or I just got bad luck. I need your help cause something just ain't adding up. I got two ferraris and I got one bently. I also got two chargers with another one in it. They like \""Shocker used to sell dope, that's a given\"". I'm from the projects, man tell me who isn't. I used to travel like I ain't have no pivot. Most ain't gonna understand that only real ballers gonna get it. I don't know how y'all can do shit for love nigga, not me. If money ain't involved, then I ain't involve nothing I free. I gotta make sure I eat, and I sleep well. Even if I stop, the world will keep going like sprewells. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. I don't care if you sliding down poles or you stuck in college. But you gotcha 9 to 5, just do what you gotta. See, a real nigga like myself, you can holla. I understand your pain, I'm addicted to dollas. So ma, nigga love some power. But I don't fuck with bustas, I'm allergic to cowards. I'm a real nigga so I can relate with ya. Do it for yourself, don't depend on these fake niggaz. Usually the boy shocker go for self. Ma if you real, I don't mind giving you some help. If the top is good and your middle is nice. Then I promise you I won't leave you in the middle of the night. I probably stick around longer, wait til the morning. Whenever I leave, if I leave, you gonna hate that I'm gone. Cause I put it on you like boots in a flood. Know you used to the scrubs. But ma you need to come chill with a thug. [Chorus]"

cold places,"[Chorus]. To all my people goin through it on a daily basis. And it seem like the world is full of cold places. Keep yo' head up, fuck what they said cause. you can do it and the man will get you through it. I believe that, homey I believe that. If I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back. [Ice Cube]. They say ""Gangster, gangster! Tell me how you do it. How you get through it and them other niggaz blew it"". I keep my eye on the prize then pursue it. Chase it like a cheetah chuck it out and subdue it. So self-educate, nigga don't hate. Cause the game I got, is Madden oh-eight. Fuck with Cube, I'm better than YouTube. Fuck with them dudes them niggaz is new school. The game don't change just the players. The rhymes don't change just the fuckin rhymesayers. (Hahahaha!) They make it up as they go along. But I'm goin on 25 years strong. The shit I say might get you through the day. Or change your whole life, in a major way. The shit they say, might catch you a case. The shit I say, feel like your birthday. [Chorus]. [Ice Cube]. You know what? Momma said it'd be days like this. Straight hell on earth, but come up out the abyss. She said ""Don't let 'em see you crawl, don't let 'em see you fall. All they wanna do is laugh when you tear your drawers"". It's a cold world nigga bring a bomber jacket. If it's another hustle out there I'ma crack it. Fuck the new dance I'ma learn how to eat. Get my mind right, stay up out these fuckin streets. They keep callin me. They keep callin, all the lil' homies keep fallin. In them same traps niggaz cain't figure out. In the fast lane boy but the bridge is out. Make my blood boil, get yo' life spoiled. Get you in the system, get you in the soil. And your funeral was sponsored by Unocal. Saw you UVN, nigga digital. [Chorus]. [Ice Cube]. I know, it's fucked up how they do us. Pretend they really care, but then they Jerry Lewis. Take that money that was allocated to us. Put us in some fucked up trailers then sue us. Watchin Katrina, is worser than Ike & Tina. See New Orleans get bitchslapped by FEMA. Louisiana got racist-ass politics. Free the Jena Six (NIGGA FREE THE JENA SIX~!). Your honor, Osama, Obama. Even, yo' momma, ain't fuckin with my comments. They want us to quit, forget. And not give a shit about these sick-ass politics. A lunatic is in the White House. Make me wanna go do a lick right now. But they'll make a nigga bow down. in the penitentiary, a billion dollar industry. [Chorus]. [Ice Cube]. I believe that, homey I believe that. If I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back"
color blind,"* SEND ALL CORRECTIONS TO mrmaj@juno.com. Ice Cube:. Here's another day at the stoplight. I'm lookin in my mirror so I can see who can see me. South Central is puttin Ice Cube to the test. With four brothas in the SS. I can't go around and can't back up. So I gotta peep game layin in the cut. Is this a jack or a kidnap?. Since I'm never ever slippin I fully strapped. I grab my gat out the glove. Now, do these fools got a problem with me?. Or do they got love?. So when the light turns green, I don't bone out. I wanna see what these black men are all about. Cuz if it's my time, I'm just short. If not, I'm pluggin they Super Sport. First they get behind my ride.... Then they switch lanes to the left side. I'm scopin out the one smokin indo. Comin up fast, rollin down his window. He threw up a sign, I put away my nine. Fool, cuz I'm color blind. Threat:. Killa Cali, the state where they kill. Over colors cuz brothas don't know the deal. And they'll cap you, not if they have to. But if they want to, first they might confront you. But every nigga on my block can't stop. And he won't and he don't stop. Not to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang. And rookies ain't the only ones that drop. Some say the little locs are gettin a little too loc'ed. And when it comes to dust, they kick up the most. Say the wrong word. then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird. Bust a u-turn, come back and get served nigga. For the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get. But wearin the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split. It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me. Cuz I slang these thangs like a G. It's on, is anybody killin for the summertime. I gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind. KAM:. I'm fresh outta county on bail. And no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail. For some gang related activity. Cuz everyday, different fools try to get with me. For no more than a color, or territory. Can't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story. So what's left, the judge goes deaf. When you try to tell your side. And you ain't blue eyed. Boy you better duck cuz the book is comin'. And just hand your car keys over to your woman. Because it aint no sunshine where you headed. And the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it. But now, I got time to think. Because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink. And I ain't even shed a tear. Cuz believe it or not, they got more love for me here. Now picture that, but on a black and white photograph. Cuz brothas, you don't know the half. On the streets I was damn near outta my mind. But ever since I've been down. I'm colorblind. WC:. Now here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine. I was told to peel a cap on the other side. Yo, young and dumb, full of come up, a baby loc. I gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke. Coolio:. Stable and able but I'm not ready and willin. Cuz I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killin. Grabbed the A.K. and jumped in the G ride. Started up the bucket and headed for the other side. WC:. Yo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip. Hit the 5 dollar stick and I I put in my clip. Coolio:. So, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost. I had my mind set on sendin niggaz to Harrison Ross. WC:. Caught one from the back and I looked in eyes. Thinkin should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive. Yo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by another side. Coolio:. I ain't contributin to genocide (why?). Cuz I'm colorblind. King Tee:. Niggaz in the hood ain't changed. And I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang. Cuz, I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn. Every which way I get burned baby. Lou wears blue, Big Fred wears red. Put 'em together and we color 'em dead. Dead, dyin, gettin smoked like part of the fun. They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral. J-Dee(Lench Mob):. I understand how all my homeboys feel. Cuz I was shot and to this day, I pack my steel. Cuz I was born in a certain territory. Where you don't talk only the streets tell stories. With blue and red bandanas on the street. And if you slippin, you'll be six feet deep. Cuz me and T-bone, we pay it no mind."
crack baby?,"[Chorus]. Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?. Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?. Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?. Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?. [Ice Cube]. Let me tell y'all, the definition of shady. It's a nigga like you that think it's all gravy. Do some dumb shit, dumber than join the Navy. What yo' broke ass doin' with a hundred babies?. Strap it on please, you're spreadin' STD's. throughout the hood, you's a walkin' disease. You took the bad ones, and you turned 'em into sad ones. Bitch you dumb too, fuckin' with the last ones. You's a crazy nigga goin' in and out of there. Like you love it, but nigga I'm outta here. When they crack the door, boy I ain't comin' back. I'm tryin' to figure out, why you keep runnin' back?. [Chorus]. Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?. Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?. Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?. Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?. [Ice Cube]. Sick with it, bipolar, crazy as the Ayatollah. Went in to buy a soda, now we shootin' at the rollers. He looked at me like ""Cube, I thought you was a soldier"". I am nigga, but not for a Coca-Cola. Jumped out my car when his head hit the tar. It bust like a jar but he still wanted to spar. They jumped out, and hit his ass with the taser. Fifty thousand volts turned him into Joe Frazier. Beat they ass, took they badge, took they guns and they cash. Came by the bar, nigga rollin' in they squad car. Blue and red lights flashin' like a superstar. I just shook my head and wondered who the fuck you are. [Chorus]. Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?. Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?. Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?. Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?. [Ice Cube]. You've got to be a crack baby, turn into a grown-up. Sharp as a bowling ball, brain like a donut. My daddy told me that the early bird get the worm. He told me that the early dope fiend get the sherm. Three AM, see you ridin' on that bicycle. Old motherfucker, what you doin' on that tricycle?. You's a cold motherfucker like a icicle. With your grandmama purse tryin' to buy a nickel. I should kick ya ass just because she can't do it. Cause all you do is talk shit and you drink fluid. You say ""Yeah man, you better get used to it"". They say God is perfect, and I say he blew it. [Chorus]. Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?. Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?. Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?. Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?. Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?. Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?. Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?. Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?"

dead homiez,"Verse One:. Up early in the morning, dressed in black. Don't ask why? 'Cause I'm down in a suit and tie. They killed a homie that I went to school with(Damn!). I tell ya life ain't shit to fool with. I still hear the screams of his mother. While my nigga laid dead in the gutter(Shit!). And it's getting to my temple. Why is that the only time black folks get to ride in a limo?. It makes me so mad I want to get my sawed-in. And have some bodies hauled in. But no, I pay my respects and I'm through(whaddup Cube?). Hug my crew, and maybe shed a tear or two. And I wanna get blitz. Grab my 40 ounce and then I reminisce. About a brother who had to be the one and only. So I dedicate this to my dead homiez.... Verse Two:. Another homie got murdered on a shakedown{three gun shots}. And his mother is at the funeral, havin' a nervous breakdown. Two shots hit him in the face when they blasted{two gun shots}. A framed picture and a closed casket. A single file line about 50 cars long. All drivin' slow with they lights on. He got a lot of flowers and a big wreath. What good is that when you're six feet deep?. I look at that shit and gotta think to myself. And thank God for my health. 'Cause nobody really ever know. When it's gonna be they family on the front row. So I take everything slow, go with the flow. And shut my motherfuckin' mouth if I don't know(Word!). 'Cause that's what Pops told me. But I wish he could have said it...to my dead homiez. Verse Three:. I remember we painted our names on the wall for fun. Now it's ""Rest in Peace"" after every one. Except me, but I ain't the one to front. Seems like I'm viewin' a body after every month. Plus, I knew him when he was yea big. Pour beer on the curb before I take a swig. But somethin' ain't right. When it's a tragedy, that's the only time that the family's tight. Lovin' each other in a caring mood. There's lots of people and lots of food. They say ""Be Strong"" and you're tryin'. But how strong can you be when you see your Pops cryin'?. So that's why Ice Cube's dressed up. Because the city is so fuckin' messed up. And everybody is so phony"

doing dumb shit,"<O'Shea! O'Shea!. Get your ass in here, boy. You hear me calling you?. O'Shea!>. When I was young I used to hang with the seventh graders. Little bad motherfucker playing Space Invaders. Fucking with the girls in the fourth grade. Either feeling on they butts or pulling on they braids. Walking with the schoolhouse bully. By doing that, I had a lot of pull, G. Cheating on tests, making a mess. Cussing like a sailor at recess. It must a been a half moon. Cause you'll catch me running out the little girls' bathroom. Chewing on Good and Plenties. Got my gamble on at lunch pitching pennies. Yo I was living like the class clown. Pulling all the hokes, making all the jokes man. When you young it's hard to see. That it's wrong throwing rocks at the RTD. Popping out your window with a BB gun. Better yet knocking on your door and run. Playing hide-and-go-get-it for a little stank. Even though I was still shooting blanks. As soon as the dark hit. I was stealing candy out the corner market. Until I got my ass whipped. Cause I was ten years old, doing dumb shit. Thirteen, that's how old I was. When my jimmy started getting a little peach fuzz. And I was looking at any butt and ass. Me and my homies started cutting class. Going up to the high school. Looking for any bitch I could lie to. Tell em I was older than I really was. Smoked my first joint and got really buzzed. That's what a mack's made of. But when I got my first piece of pussy I fell in love. Hard as a rock the long way. And then I put the rubber on the wrong way. But I still gotta have it. Overexcited and fucking like a jackrabbit. Goddamn I was hot. A virgin but I still knew how to lay pipe. Even though the hoe worked me. I still knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque. Then the shit got strange money. I started shaking and jimmy felt funny. Then the nut came gushing. I jumped up got dressed and start pushing. Cause I thought the bitch broke my dick. Cause I was still young doing dumb shit. At 17 got my first Volkswagon. And mastered the life-long art of dragging. To the women in college. Hung out with the OG's and got some street knowledge. Breaking in cars and all that. Hitting punk fools with a baseball bat. Fucking at a real fast rate. Til they said that I might not graduate. Then I said fuck the dumb shit. Cause Pops'll fuck me up quick. If things continued. So I start rapping about shit I been through. And I got real good. Now I look at all the kids in the neighborhood. Trying to be baby macks. Doing shit that I did seven years back. Going through a stage. But before they can grow up they on the front page. And they mommas is having a fit."

You saw how big her ass was. Got her on the dancefloor. And she started dancin like a ho. Jimmy got stiff, she ain't have a ride home. So you gave the bitch a lift. She didn't wanna trouble you. But hopped her big ass in your BMW. Hopped to her house and started kissin. And Jimmy just wouldn't listen. Cos you got real horny. And that ain't cool at four in the morning. Started undressing the ho. Got to the drawers and the ho said ""No!. ""Not on the first date. ""It's gettin kinda late, could you come back at eight?"". You said ""Yeah!"" cos you thought you met a wholesome ho. But nigga, she know you rollin in some dough. And you'll regret and somethin 'bout a bitch you just met. Don't trust em!. Interlude:.

So you can seduce the G. Bust a nut and make an excuse to leave. You got her worked out cos you the man. But the bitch got diff'rent plans. She said ""Take off your clothes, jump in the bed"". While she powder her nose. You get butt naked, cos you ready to wreck it!. Cos you's a motherfuckin punk, next thing you know. The door flies open with a blast. With four niggas in ski masks. Pointin a gun at the pimp. You're scared as a motherfucker and Jimmy done went limp. They beat you down just a taste. Take ya to your house and make ya open up the safe. Drove you far, tied up in the trunk of your own fuckin car. Take you out and pop the cap. I told you the bitch was a trap. Don't trust em!."

endangered species (tales from the darkside),"Peace. haha don’t make me laugh!. All I hear is muthafucker’s talkin’ sucotash. Livin’ large, tellin’ me to get out the gang. I’m a nigga, gotta live by the trigger. How the fuck do you figure?. That I can say peace and the gunshots won’t cease. Every cop killin’ goes ignored. They just send another nigga to the morgue. A point scored- they could give a fuck about us. They rather catch us with guns and white powder. If I was old, they’d probably be a friend of me. Since I’m young, they consider me the enemy. They kill ten of me to get the job correct. To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck. Cuz I’m the one with the trunk of funk. And ’fuck tha police’ in the tape deck. You should listen to me cuz there’s more to see. Call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities. The other color don’t know you can run but not hide. These are tales from the darkside.... Verse two:. You wanna free africa, I stare at yuh. Cuz we ain’t got it too good in america. I can’t fuck with them overseas. My homeboy died over a key of cocaine. It was plain and simple. The 9mm went pop to the temple. pop pop pop was the sound I put the bitch down. And ran to the schoolyard bathroom. Looked in the trash can yo it had room. So I ducked my ass in it for a minute. Covered with sweat I had the layback. Mad as fuck, thinkin’ about the payback. Tonite the crew gonna have a little fun. I went home and cocked the barrel of my shotgun. It’s gettin’ critical - I start the five point o. There they go - drive real slow. I yelled out ’ice cube sucka’. Shot gun hit - and murder mutahfuckers. I told you last album, when I got a sawed off, bodies are hard off. Its a shame, that niggas die young. But to the light side it don’t matter none. It’ll be a drive by homicide. But to me it’s just another tale from the darkside.... Verse three: chuck d. Standing in the middle of war. The middle we flex. When we die, they won’t make check. Ebony can’t see to the darkside. The term they apply to us is a nigga. Call it what you want, cuz I’m comin’ from the coroner. Same applies with a phd. Who’z black - don’t wanna role - sells his soul. Watch his head go rollin’. Who the fuck are they foolin’?. Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes. Matches the color of the one on my face as they wonder what’s under my waist. [standin on the verge] of them gettin’ brown. Thats a fact got a fear on their bozack. Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide. Yet cube, they can’t fuck with the darkside!"

everythang's corrupt,"(Intro: x2). Everythangs corrupt, everythangs fucked up. Everythangs by the bout' to buck me shit out of luck. Verse 1:. Go to school, the teacher wanna fuck the students. Go to church, my preacher turned to prostitution. The prosecution never read my files. That evil ass judge fell asleep at my trial. This shit is wild, chickens get as sick as the cows. Birds fallin out the sky, fish dyin' in piles. Its fishy, politicians smell like my bowels. Talkin' that shit, really crampin' my styles. I got many, now I'm pinchin' pennies no doubt. I sqeezed Lincoln so hard, a fuckin' booger came out. Its a shame, I used to be on top of my game. They took the shirt off my back and replaced it with chains. I met Mr. Lee Harvey, from the tea party. He used to hate Obama til' he felt hurricane Charley. Lookin' for his FEMA check, it's gone with the wind. When em' dicks is in, you know the fix is in. (Hook: x2). For my birthday, buy me a politician. It's a shame that you got to dish yo' children. Everythangs corrupt, everythangs fucked up. Everythangs by the bout' to buck me shit out of luck. Verse 2:. Everythang's a scam, beat the next man. That's capitalism, they'll just build a new prison. For you slick ass niggas' that's tryin' to beat the system. Put you on the front line if you ain't re-enlisting. It's hot in hell's kitchen, get ready for the lynching. Brain-wash media, and puppet politician. Keep you out of position, out of commission. By medicine or food, that's not a decision. The 99 percent, is man tryin' to vent. Police grab my fuckin' arm, then they got bent. Now it's in a splint, I can't pay my rent. The interest on my credit card I ain't made a dent. The U.S mint, I heard they bout' to print. But it's fucked up cause' I won't see a cent. I'm sick of gettin' ignored, this wall I can't afford. I'm going to the pent, free room, free ward. (Hook x2). Outro:. It's wall of confusion, my niggas' they losin'. I know what ya' doin', they drug abusin'. My bitches be choosin', my music be oozin'. The thugs be cruzin', they love what ya' doin'. It's wall of confusion, my niggas' they losin'. I know what ya' doin', they drug abusin'. My bitches be choosin', my music be oozin'.

extradition,"(Ice Cube Talking). Dear Mama, If some people came by the house lookin for me. I'm innocent of anything they say I done. Now I don't know when I'll be able to write you again. But I will be back to California to see you. Your son, Ice-mutherfucking-Cube.. [Hook]. Keep my hand on my gun cos they got me on the run. I swear I didn't do what they say I done (x2). [Verse 1]. Ghetto destroyer, paranoia, I need a lawyer. This bitch named Netoia, say they lookin for ya. Got to get the fuck out of here (yeah right). This bitch dimmed the lights (nigga, spend the night). Bust a quick nut, got to fuck up and gat on. Cos this the same street I got shot on. So God bless Don Polla, double-s. I gotta holla cos I'm smokin on double breath. Freakin, niggaz be leakin, information. Got the feds seekin, incarceration. Niggaz say my name popped up. Bitch hop up. Nigga close the shop up. They try to stop em. My cash flow leave me asshole neck it. Gone in sixty seconds, burn all records. Nigga gettin skinny eating dinnies. Count my pennies, only got a bag fulla twenties. [Chorus]. Listen, these feds fishin for this extradition. I'm on a mission, fuck em, fight em, dine em, ditch em. I gotta kick rocks, can't pick locks. Or spend the rest of my life in a shit-?bath. [Verse 2]. It's so hard to get a room without a credit card. It's so hard not to let em know where you are. Tried to get a rent a car. But he laughed when I showed him cash. Had to mash 'fore he called the feds on my ass. Went to Vegas for the weekend. Met a hoe down freakin. Hey bitch, why you sneakin?. Grabbed the paper out her hand. Am I the man on the front page? (Fuck). Same height, same age (click-click). Rap gauge, put it down the G-way. Got my hostage suckin sausage on the freeway. She say ""Let's hear the circle K"". Ran inside and made the niggaz all pay. It's like I hit the Lotto outside Colorado. Brought it there for his wallet and my bottle. That's my motto and I gotta warn ya. before I'm through, I'm going back to California. (Hook). (Chorus). [Verse 3]. My boys Utah to Illinois. Set the poise, so I can infiltrate. All fifty states. Can't wait till I'm back on my feet. Switch and shake this bitch in her sleep. Low key you feds can't see me. I'm up in D.C. with strike number three. Clownin, made a little stock to get a little cock. Now I got niggaz bangin and lootin rock. I'm going back to Cali where it's bound with my strikes. Don't give a fuck who's on the ?marin or the mic. I should've known when I seen that motherfucker in the lobby. looking like he wanna rob me (Fuck). Federal, don't like no black hetero, sexual, intellectual. Tried to turn me into a vegetable. An I'm 'a sue all black and blue. When I come to- hand cuff (Fuck y'all). Big grey bus, scandalous. Cos they can't stand us. They get excited and I try to fight it (mama). I'm going back to Cali to show, extradited. (Hook). (Chorus). (Ice Cube talking). Hey mama, when y'all send pictures you can't send a polaroid. Got to be the regular pictures. An' they got us in here puttin' in computer chips or something. I don't know. Like they playin with us, it's like a game. It ain't nuttin' but a game to them mama."
fat cat,"[Chorus 1]. Countin money, eatin rats, gettin pussy all day. All I do is lean back, still makin green sacks. [Chorus 1 (4X) for the first 30 seconds]. [Chorus 2: repeat ""That's all I do!"" 4X over]. All I do is lean back, still makin greenbacks. Still makin green, still still makin greenbacks. All I do is lean back, still makin greenbacks. Haters get mad cause I'm still makin greenbacks. I'm a fat cat, look at me, stomach like a Volkswagen. Still I can handle my, business got these hoes braggin. Ice Cube put it down (bitch I am the dragon). I am a fuckin clown (yo look how I'm actin). They wanna throw me out - but they bet' not touch me. Is this nigga fuckin crazy, or is he just lucky?. Actin like he own the place, y'all niggaz best to rendezvous. This nigga ain't no pussy y'all, this kind of cat all he came to do is. [Chorus 1 (2X) + Chorus 2]. People wanna know how I make that money. Momma Ice Cube didn't raise no dummy. This fat cat don't chase no mice. Hoodrats think they can live off Ice. Enemies think I'm finicky, nigga be. walkin 'round here like a Kennedy. Tend to be, movin like a centipede. Y'all muh'fuckers still just Little League. Now I know when the haters get mad, I'm doin my job. Some niggaz can't dunk 'til you throw them a lob. Better go find, another one to rob. You just a role player this my squad. You get Lenched, this my Mob. Ain't that I, you a facade. All in the alley, lookin through the trash. I'm a fat cat, lookin through the glass. [Chorus 1 (2X) + Chorus 2]"
fire water,"A lot of people wonder how they gon' die. How'm I gon' die?. Will it be a bullet wound?. Will they die at the hands of the police?. Here's how I think I'ma go.

I'm a animal, my splif's flammable. This is Hannibal, I'm a cannibal. It's understandable you think I'm studio. But when we leave the studio, nigga, you's the hoe. Niggas lose your hoe, like usual. Bitch is beautiful, what she with you for?. When Hiawatha drank my fire water said sayonara to his lonely daughter. Fire starter, mister arson. South Central Compton next to Carson. Rips are rippin', dogs are barkin'. Guppies all move over, let the shark in. Blood in the water, cuz in the water. Need to get out, nigga, was it a slaughter?. Fuckin' wit'chy'all niggas, tear in your drawers. This fire water put hair on your balls. This is a rebel without a pause. With three hoes like Santa Clause. Know all the pimp codes and the bylaws. Got enough paper, I could buy y'all. At the Bayou, I could buy you. Walkin' 'round here with a slave IQ. Better get smart or it's déjà vu. Back in the dark, nigga, chained to the ark, nigga, fuck. Fire water. I got that fire water. The shit I spit will get you lit. I got that fire water. The shit I spit will get you lit. I got that fire water. Too much salt, too much sugar. Too much smoke and too much liquor. The good life, I'ma die of the good life. I'ma die of the good life. How I do it is lighter fluid. Think you fly? Put a spider to it. Come down heavy, Isaac Newton. While y'all talkin', I be shootin'. Most of these artists be prostitutin'. Gangsta shit, I wrote The Constitution. Bitch ass nigga, what's your contribution?. Hatin' on shit ain't a revolution. Change this shit, fuck the lootin'. West side riders, I'm recruitin'. God is a teacher, I'm the student. Don't bite the apple, I'm rebootin'. Back to the pen and pad. Back to the pen and paper. Niggas wanna catch the vapors but they on respirators. Always on elevators. Always dressed like the Raiders. Always on my way to Vegas. [Chorus]. Fire water. I got that fire water. The shit I spit will get you lit. I got that fire water. The shit I spit will get you lit. I got that fire water. Too much salt, too much sugar. Too much smoke and too much liquor. The good life, I'ma die of the good life. I'ma die of the good life. My best wares? Louis chest hairs. Who wanna ball with the California bears?. It's Mardi Gras every time I'm with my players. Alcohol all in the air. I run this shit, I am the mayor. You a crazy bitch, Princess Leia. Don't'cha know my truth is a dare?. It's the cyclops with the eye drops. Fuck these thots and Goldilocks. Bitches wanna go and drink all a nigga porridge. Don't ask me for a piece of pizza. Fold my arms and say, ""Bye Felicia"". Why the fuck you messin' with the creature?. Might wake up and fuckin' eat ya. Can hardly see ya 'cause of my shine. I'm legally blind. I'm outta my mind. Study my rhyme, I got the equation for any occasion. Black, white, brown, red, purple, or Asian. My fire water keep folks ablazin'. I got some shit that'll burn your stomach. Make you vomit, the dogs atomic. Please don't try to mix this with chronic. Niggas won't believe that you seen a comet, no. Fire water. I got that fire water. The shit I spit will get you lit.

forgive me,"(Silkk Talking). Dear God, I know I'm wrong sometimes but. Who are they to judge me. Cause umm...he who don't sin should cast the first stone. [Chorus]. Dear God, Forgive me for my sins. Cause all I wanted to do in this world was to win. To all my soldiers in the grave or the pen. All my soldiers, thats blowing with the wind, life is hard. Dear God, Forgive me for my sins. Cause all I wanted to do in this world was to win. To all my soldiers in the grave or the pen. All my soldiers, thats blowing with the wind, life is hard. I ain't got time to worry about who hate me or love me. Why would I care how a nigga feel when only god can judge me. I know I deserve 5 mics for how hard I strive. But I'm cool cause I really only need one mic like Nas. and I ain't got time to worry about whether my foes is mad. Got bigger problems, should the color of my cars or clothes be black. If you really wanna understand me, then just come with me. Then you really understand why I keep the gun with me. Only way to make money, if you slung rocks. Rap was the hot shit, you had to have a jumpshot. Look, I try but my shots was off. I stay fly, stay driving something new on the block, y'all. It don't take a rocket scientist if you can add. I never had a job figuring out you do the math. Tell my nigga I had a fight with, I never told you I was starving. What's the rush, I figure I could just tell you tomorrow. But tomorrow never came, well it came but you wasn't around. I know God took you but I know you still looking down. You know I do this for the ones that ain't got no choice. I speak the truth for the ones who ain't got a voice, let's go. [Chorus]"

fuck tha police,"[MC Ren as Court Officer]. Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect. Judge Dre presiding. In the case of N.W.A. vs. the Police Department;. prosecuting attourneys are: MC Ren, Ice Cube,. and Eazy-motherfuckin-E. [Dr. Dre as The Judge]. Order, order, order. Ice Cube, take the motherfuckin stand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth. and nothin but the truth so help your black ass?. [Ice Cube as Witness]. You god damn right!. [Dr. Dre]. Well won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?. [Ice Cube]. Fuck the police comin straight from the underground. A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown. And not the other color so police think. they have the authority to kill a minority. Fuck that shit, cause I ain't the one. for a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun. to be beatin on, and thrown in jail. We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell. Fuckin with me cause I'm a teenager. with a little bit of gold and a pager. Searchin my car, lookin for the product. Thinkin every nigga is sellin narcotics. You'd rather see, me in the pen. than me and Lorenzo rollin in a Benz-o. Beat a police out of shape. and when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape. To tape off the scene of the slaughter. Still gettin swoll off bread and water. I don't know if they fags or what. Search a nigga down, and grabbin his nuts. And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none. But don't let it be a black and a white one. Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top. Black police showin out for the white cop. Ice Cube will swarm. on ANY motherfucker in a blue uniform. Just cause I'm from, the CPT. Ounk police are afraid of me!. HUH, a young nigga on the warpath. And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath. of cops, dyin in L.A.. Yo Dre, I got somethin to say. {Fuck the police 4X}. [Cop] Pull your god damn ass over right now. [NWA] Aww shit, now what the fuck you pullin me over for?. [Cop] Cause I feel like it!. Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up. [NWA] Man, fuck this shit. [Cop] Aight smartass, I'm takin your black ass to jail!. [Dr. Dre]. MC Ren, will you please give your testimony. to the jury about this fucked up incident?. [MC Ren]. Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority. because the niggaz on the street is a majority. A gang, is with whoever I'm steppin. and the motherfuckin weapon is kept in. a stash box, for the so-called law. Wishin Ren was a nigga that they never saw. Lights start flashin behind me. But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me. But that shit don't work, I just laugh. because it gives em a hint, not to step in my path. For police, I'm sayin, ""Fuck you punk!"". Readin my rights and shit, it's all junk. Pullin out a silly club, so you stand. with a fake-assed badge and a gun in your hand. But take off the gun so you can see what's up. And we'll go at it punk, and I'ma fuck you up!. Make you think I'ma kick your ass. but drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast. I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime. But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time. Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me. or any asshole, that threatens me. I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope. Takin out a cop or two, they can't cope with me. The motherfuckin villian that's mad. With potential, to get bad as fuck. So I'ma turn it around. Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound. {*BOOM, BOOM*} Yeah, somethin like that. but it all depends on the size of the gat. Takin out a police, would make my day. But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say. {Fuck the police 4X*}. [Cop] {*knocking on the door*}. [NWA] Yeah man, what you need?. [Cop] Police, open now. [NWA] Aww shit. [Cop] We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest. [Cop] Get down and put your hands up where I can see 'em. (Move motherfucker, move now!). [NWA] What the fuck did I do, man what did I do?. [Cop] Just shut the fuck up. and get your motherfuckin ass on the floor. (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!). [NWA] But I didn't do shit. [Cop] Man just shut the fuck up!. [Dr. Dre]. Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand. and tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?. [Eazy-E]. I'm tired of the motherfuckin jackin. Sweatin my gang, while I'm chillin in the shack, and. shinin the light in my face, and for what?. Maybe it's because I kick so much butt. I kick ass -- or maybe cause I blast. on a stupid-assed nigga when I'm playin with the trigger. of any Uzi or an AK. Cause the police always got somethin stupid to say. They put out my picture with silence. Cause my identity by itself causes violence. The E with the criminal behavior. Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor. Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?. A sucker in a uniform waitin to get shot. by me, or another nigga. And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger. (MC Ren: Size ain't shit, he's from the old school fool). And as you all know, E's here to rule. Whenever I'm rollin, keep lookin in the mirror. And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a. dumb motherfucker with a gun. And if I'm rollin off the 8, he'll be the one. that I take out, and then get away. While I'm drivin off laughin this is what I'll say. {*""Fuck the police"" -> cut and scratched 4X*}. The verdict. [Dre] The jury has found you guilty of bein a redneck,. white bread, chickenshit motherfucker. [Cop] But wait, that's a lie! That's a god damn lie!. [Dre] Get him out of here!. [Cop] I want justice!. [Dre] Get him the fuck out my face!. [Cop] I want justice!. [Dre] Out, RIGHT NOW!. [Cop] FUCK YOU, YOU BLACK MOTHER-FUCKERRRRRRRRRRRRS!. Fuck the police! 3X)"

Niggaz on the playground wanna know what's happenin. You left em hangin man, what the fuck?. Verse One: Ice Cube. Little Boy Blue is outta Folsome. Now them three little pigs gotta roast him. Drivin down Sesame Street and I bet. That little motherfucker's out fuckin Smurfette. Ain't saw the wolf yet, but it's no doubt. They'll catch his ass slippin at his grandma house. They got the Mac-10 pointed out the coop. Cause they gotta follow they nose like Fruit Loops. Peeped out Little Miss Muffet on her tuffet eatin grits. She saw the Mac-10 and the bitch had the shits. Ran into her house, called up her crew. Cause Red Riding Hood wants to kill Little Boy Blue. And the wolf too, what is Mister Rogers doing?. Moved out his Jordan, bought him a Ewing. Him, Little Boy Blue and the wolf in the cellar. Planning on gettin Cinderella. Cause Cinderella still works for the pigs. Through with the dwarfs, fuckin Bebe's kids. Now Snow White got the horny ass fever. Fuckin the Beauty's Beast like Jungle Fever. Now the word's on the street. When the crews meet. You better make some fuckin room. Cause it's on with the pigs and them other nigs. When the cow jump over the moon, everybody jump. Verse Two. Now Little Boy Blue is up front. WIth the nine millimeter, ready for the hunt. Little Red Riding Hood caught his ass slippin. Drew down on the boy cause the bitch is steady trippin. About to get loose with the deuce deuce. That's when the boy said, ""What about the gang truce?"". The little hoe had no words. The wolf came around and the bitch got served. Three little pigs bought wigs. Dressed like sheep, Cinderella is Little Bo Peep. Tryin to creep, on the crew. The wolf, the Rogers, the Blue, they through. Cause the pigs did the buck buck bang, ping. Now you hear the fat lady sing. Cinderella, ran like a bitch. To the pay phone cause the bitch is still a snitch. Now the pigs are caught by the pigs and taken. In the pen to get fried like bacon. You still can't trust no hoe. And Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the stories, should go. . Outro: Little Russ. Yeah Cube, man that shit was dope nigga. You all that and a bowl of grits. Nigga that shit was on props, nigga!. Yeah that's how you kick that shit for the ninety-deuce, nigga. What's happenin nigga?!. Yeah nigga that's Gangsta Fairytale part 2 nigga."

She's a hoe cause they knew her at the front desk. Told her to meet me, at the room 110. And the bitch showed up, with her boyfriend. I let him in, all he could do was grin. He had a camera, a t-shirt, a pad and pen. He said, ""Yo Ice Cube, can you sign this?"". I only did it cause his bitch was the finest. She blew me a kiss and gave a bitter frown. Like - how can we get rid of this clown?. Me and her sat down, he got a little jealous. Cause his punk ass sat in the middle of us. And he asked me question after question. It felt like a motherfuckin interview session. Then his girl got up, I heard the do' shut. And he was still there, swingin from my nuts. I said, ""Get the FUCK out!"" and made it loud and clear. Get off my dick nigga, and tell your bitch to come here. I see me about ten mark ass motherfuckers fans. knock on the door, talkin about whassup?. Yo man, it was about a hundred and twenty dicks man.

Long Beach, bust a U, here come the cops Wish I had a genie with about three wishes. Metal flake green on D's I look suspicious You know that I'm running. Shit, I hear it humming Fuck, I see it coming. Is it a bird? Yup Is it a plane? No. I hit me a right on El Segundo Wanted to holla, had to ditch the Impala. Let's see if they would folla Me, hit a fence, hit a fence, and another. met me a baby pitbull and his mother Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window. I wish it was my ten-four had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third. cuz I'm getting chased by the ghetto bird. ""Just put his hat, ehrrr, he combed his hair and then put his hat back. on.

Park The 735 and I'm bailin. Went to my homegirl's house and got a hug man, She helped me run like Harriet Tubman. Looked out the window by the black bed I saw the pigs and the four on a flatbed. Then the light from the bird hit me in the face I close the blinds cause I didn't wanna catch a case. All that night, I heard the bird circle while I was eating fish and watching Urkel. She said I could sleep on the couch By two A.M. I was digging her out. Fuck the ghetto bird. ""Which way is he going now?"" ""Ok, now..now he's..he's actually southbound..on a service street... and, uh...Gee whiz, uh, I'm gonna get my maps out here and figure. out which service srteet he suddelny turned off on.

Are you from the westside is it so?. i said hell yea and who wanta to know (me). in slow mo fo' fo' slugs face down in the mud. puddle full of blood left for dead. the pain starts to spread now I can't feel my legs.

I said I can't move my legs he said don't try to. now this ain't the end my friend but you'll probably. never walk again.

Dependin on that to keep my ass alive. I don't got bows but my arm's about a one-six.

Fool I'm a Vet. (Chorus)(2X). [Mack 10]. Fool I'm a vet you can bet that. I could dance underwater and not get wet (check it). [Mr. Short Khop].

And if you decide to call rape, we got the little hooker on tape, now:. tell the fuckin' slut to please hurry up,. and wear that dress that's tight on her butt,. so I can finger-fuck on the way to the bed,. been in so many rooms, she got a dot on her forehead.. Face turnin' red from grabbin' them ankles.. Fuck and get up is how I do them stank-hoes.. You should hear how she sounds with a cock in her,. boots get knocked from here to Czechoslovakia.. Two on top, one on the bottom;. first nigga got the boots, man, you shoulda shot 'im.. Cuz after I got 'em it was over. Now niggas get lucky like a four-leaf clover.. On daddy's little girl..

gotta be insanity,"[Ice Cube]. Uhh, gotta get it...uhhh....hmmm....get it, get it. --baby--. (verse one) {:21}. Stab thru the neighborhood, these spinin'. Weez winin', scrap with the John Lennon. Head rests, TV's in 'em. Best in the nation, on this playstation. The Don Daata, gotta get you hotter. Been a buck naked nigga smokin' water. On a friday, the get high day. Blowin' at a hot date, findin' Shade. Black and bicantay, with ass everwhere, how you do that there?. A sight to behold, break the mold. Just tryin' to get some before the world explode. I see you tryin' to get caught. Well shake what your mama gave ya, plus what you bought. We fuck and we fought, we laugh and we cry. Told the truth and we lie. (chorus) {:57}. You be good to me, i'll be good to you. Anything you want, anything you do. I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you. Give it all I got, and to keep it hot. (verse two) {1:15}. Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?. Explain it to your family. It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me--. You know you ain't right standin' at the light. Think it's chocolate with that shit too tight. And if I fuck around and get you in the car with me. Motherfuckers would think I had a star with me. Now see the haterism increase. They hate when you got a dime piece. And I got one shotgun, and I might catch a hot one. When i'm lookin' for love and niggas got none, uhh. If you let me handcuff your wrist. Bonnie and Clyde ain't got shit on this. Cuz Bonnie and Clyde had to take a risk. But most of my money see it's all legit --baby--. It's all about your state of mind. Now what would you do if I handed you a tech nine?. Are you feelin' me?. Would you stay down like Hillary?. Even if you thought about killin' me?. (chorus) {2:02}. You be good to me, i'll be good to you. Anything you want, anything you do. I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you. Give it all I got, and to keep it hot. (verse three) {2:19}. Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?. Explain it to your family. It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me--. Are you the type of girl that would call them folks. Have your man leave the house in chains and ropes. Don't need the kind of girl that'll have me in court. On lawsuits lyin' about demestic abuse. Have a bitch like Judge Judy cussin' me out. Garnish my cheques, reposses my lex. Cuz I come from a place in southern Californi. Where hoes rake niggas for tons of alimoni. But fuck the world don't aks me for shit. Unless you my boo, and i'm fuckin' you. The rest of these broads ain't knowin'. That i'm a have you bumpin' Lauryn, in somethin' foreign. Come thru blow the horn. Stick your wrists out the window. And wave to your kinfolks. Let 'em know who you with. And to your crazy ass daddy, let him know who to get. (chorus) {3:06}. You be good to me, i'll be good to you. Anything you want, anything you do. I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you. Give it all I got, and to keep it hot. Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?. Explain it to your family. It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me--."
greed,"Now, if the greenbacks don't stack large on my side of the yard. I ain't fuckin with it. This cake has got to be all icing baby.

We be stackin chips, packin clips, mackin chicks. Laugh at tits, slappin dick, in yo' bitch (bitch!). Makin hoes, take these clothes, from these sto's. Walkin slow, there go the po', now here we go. Parking lot to the spot, Marriott. Cause what I got to make a knot, is very hot. Who's at the do', go and check, I got the Tec. Tell him that you soakin wet, until he jet. Now lift up your fuckin dress, where's the rest. Bitch can hide a treasure chest, in her breasts. Uh-huh strip search, whip skirts. Uh-huh shit hurts, but it works bitch. You can jerk niggaz but you can't jerk me. Hoe I only tell you once that this dick ain't free. I'm talkin greed. *Chorus*. Greed, give me everything that I need. How you gon' deal with the niggaz that I feed. (repeat 2X). We smokin weed, you and me. Lookin for that currency. (repeat 2X). Now bitch niggaz don't mean shit, from where I sit. Magnificent blow your back out, if you act out. Eighteen deep when the plane soar. The bitch threw her tits asked my click who we pay for. Penetrate the clouds, loud, and obnoxious. Surround the airport with feds and helicopters. Escorted, detained and deported. Scared of the ly-rics, and when they bitches hear us. We the clear-est, you can fear us. Smile on the day of your dissapear-ance, smoke in mirr-ors. Break em all, pull over and jump out. Cause I can take em all, all bustas shake em all. I'm at the mall, buyin shit, like hot dog on a stick. These bitches all on the dick. Ice Cube ain't a lick (nope) make me bleed. And now you got to deal with the niggaz that I feed, greed. Uhh uhh uhh *pigs squeal*. (Give me more, give me more) Greed, Greed. When you get your hands on it, wanna fawn it. Wanna dance on it, everybody want it. (repeat 2X).

No. Niggaz hit me I'ma turn into The Crow *caw caw* and take a shit. on everything counterfeit, the Don Mega. Blade Runner, in a beige Hummer all summer. It'd take about twelve honkeys, to convict. the nigga makin you sick, ask the 12 Monkeys. Up in Detroit holdin weed court, all through the South. Picked up a ounce in Shreveport. My lead give head tunnels (boom!). to any motherfucker disgruntled exit wound, look like a funnel. Worldwide, international jet set. My niggaz love fuckin bitches that they just met. Get it wet, and you can do anything. When I'm in Paris niggaz french-kiss the pinky ring. *Chorus*. Yeah, Ice Cube, trillionaire. I own a mansion and a yacht, haha. We do it like it should be does. Yeah, Westside niggaz is very greedy, uhh. Death Row is very greedy. Sic-Wid-It records is very greedy. Dangerous Music greedy greedy greedy. Ruthless Records greedy, Suave House, greedy.

growin' up,"[Ice Cube]. Ha ha, that's my shit. Turn it up [echoes]. Uhh, yeah. I hear a beat like this, and think about growin up. House parties, with gangbangers showin up. Represent your hood, everybody throw it up. They say Cube get on the mic, nigga blow it up. I used to lyrical, political. But now you want it sugarcoated like cereal. First I met Dre, then I met Yella (yessir). Dr. Dre made me rap acapella. Me and Jinx did a show at Dudo's {?}. With K-Dee, I think it was two shows. Then Dre introduced me to E. Cruisin down the street in his red Jeep. He said, yo niggaz we should flip it like this. Cause them _Boyz N the Hood_ like the gangsta shit. I put the pen to the pad, young nigga was raw. And told the world how we felt about the law. It was real. [Chorus 2X: samples + (Cube)]. I see the happiness (all day every day). I see the pain. Where am I (growin up in the hood). Back down memory lane. [Ice Cube]. Oh shit, it's N.W.A.!. Them niggaz on tour and they comin our way. Lil' Eminem is still tucked away. In that trailer park, just bumpin our tape. Jerry Heller tried to make his escape. I had to bounce, while other niggaz got raped. Same niggaz turned around and said fuck me. No FUCK YOU cause I'm down with Chuck D. And I'm 'bout to do a movie up, a classic. When I hit the screen, nigga it was magic. Never thought I'd see Eazy in a casket. Thanks for everythang, that's on everythang. I learned a lot of game from you. I like your son, he got his name from you. I tell him everythang that he need to know. If he ask my advice, I won't think twice homey. [Chorus]. [Ice Cube]. From _Boyz N the Hood_, to _XXX 2_. Everybody wanna know my next move. Fans all around say ""We love you Cube!"". I wanna take time to say I love you too. I love all my fans cause they know I'm a man. And not a little boy or some fuckin play toy. A lot of niggaz say I grew up on you. And let me know if anybody fuck wit'chu. Cause you talk a lot of shit about the red, black &. blue. And how they treat a nigga called Katrina, did you see. her. White folks worry 'bout them fuckin misdemeanor. While black people dyin in that God damn arena. Just because I'm actin nigga never stop rappin. It's in my blood homey, I'ma keep the party crackin. Money keep stackin 'til they put me in a casket. Who you think you fuckin wit? Here's another classic. [Chorus 2x]"
heaven,"Verse One:. Listen to the preacherman. But are you talkin' to me. I can't hear you with a mouth full of pig's feet. If I should need the swine flesh. Your body is a mess, but you're blessed. With a father, son, spirit and the holy ghost. But my whole neigborhood is comatose. Lookin' for survival. The devil made you a slave and he gave you a bible. 400 years gettin' our ass kicked. By so-called christians and catholics. But I watch 'em burn in a fire. See I'm a g, that's why I ain't in your choir. Cause I see, cause I know. The church ain't nothin' but a fashion show. Get the devil to a 187. And they won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven. Verse Two:. You're waitin' for the devil to come from the ground. Clown, take a look around. Just look at the cross that the priest is holdin'. A beast in sheep's clothing. But I'm rollin' with that knowledge of self. Cause heaven ain't just wealth. So mister preacher, if I couldn't pay my tithe. Do I have to wait outside?. White man, please take another look. Cause we couldn't be readin' out of the same book. Cause youse a crook and I'm a brother. King James had sex with his mother. Is that your edition? Is that your religion?. Black man, you gotta make a desicion. Cause God is comin' on day number seven. And he won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven. Verse Three:. The same white man that threw me in the slammer. He bombed the church in Alabama. So if I cock the hammer, God won't mind. If I have to kill the human swine. Cause God is a killer from the start. Why you think Noah had to build his ark. And God is a man from his feet to his hair. That's why you say 'amen' after each and every prayer. I just stare at the church man. Spendin' more money on the church band. But Elijah's got a plan. Got the white man screamin': 'Damn that Farrakhan!'. Cause one day these babies are uprise. Much more than bowties and bean pies. Kickin' knowledge at 7-11."

You ain't nothin' to play with, nigga I beat the basics. Cock and spray shit, quick to leave a nigga faceless. Playin' Superman, we get a brave nigga sprayed quick. Niggas can't fade this, music for the ages. Because we get it in like Young Crush. She be payin' big fishin'. In the water bitch you in the deep end. Boy I pull you deep in, underneath the deep end. Nigga have you sinkin', when I hear you creepin', hear you sayin'. [Chorus]. Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come. Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come. Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come. Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come. Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero. Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero. Don't tryin' to be a hero, you nothin' but a zero. A nigga for the people, where ever they go we go.

hey you,"(Silkk Talking). Yeah yeah hold up, hold up, hold up. I don't think this nigga understand. I'ma take this back to the old silkk, nigga.

Nigga, Whatchu looking at?. Keep muggin and frontin. Gonna get your face pushed back. You don't want me looking. You shouldn't bring her up in here. You don't want no problem. You shouldn't be looking over here. You don't want me looking. You shouldn't bring her up in here. You don't want no problem. You shouldn't be looking over here. [Verse 1]. Even his own boy is like, \""Nah, don't fuck with Slim\"". Anybody else could spit, \""Please, don't fuck with him\"". They know once I go there, it be hard for me to come back. Put you in a place where it be hard for you to come back. I keep it straight gangsta look, I ain't talk money. If I bust nigga, he don't die, he survive, he gonna walk funny. Look, let's box, let's talk about that. You don't wanna be gangsta, You don't talk about gats. But if you got gangsta, and I ain't talking bout a rat. So when I put something on your mind, I ain't talking bout a hat. These jealous niggaz can't stand me, they hate me. If I ever clap a nigga, It wouldnt't be to give 'em a standing ovation. Niggaz mad cause my wrist stay frozen. I'm straight cause I done seen more weight than Gold Gym. Everybody is strict, respecting no slim. But he must not so somebody in this bitch should've told him. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. Like one nigga, two nigga, three nigga, four. When I pull this thang out, everybody better get low. Or if not, then their clothes shake like a barber. Whoever who still standing, lay 'em down like carpet. These fake dudes, always wanna talk hood. He ain't real, He ain't gangsta, He just really talk good. And that get chu put up on a stretcher. For pullin it out, trying to mob like you was Claudia Shepard. See my motto is \""I won't pull it out unless I use it\"". So if you heard I pulled it out, no doubt you heard I used it. Niggaz step to me, then you know that he stupid. Cause a real nigga live this whodi, this just not music. [Chorus]. I know this bitch ain't looking at me. Hey you, Yeah You. Bitch, Whatchu looking at?. Hey you, Yeah You. Bitch, Whatchu looking at?. YEAH YOU"

Passing me a flyer talkin' 'bout the Messiah. she wanna take me higher. Keep your rhetoric in the heavens. look and see a bro' with a fro like Michael Evans. Done spent 6 years in the college. always telling me to question the knowledge. Sittin' in the black hole with the black stroll. and not even one cave bitch in our click. Sayin' fuck Professor Fitz. I come from the land of the Bloods and the Crips (What's up nigga). Don't like scholarships because they hurt me. nothin' but a slave to the university.

He's about to erupt and turn red. start hangin' with the muthafuckin' skinheads. 'Cause he can't deal with the overkill. college ain't nothin' but niggerville. and he regret that his school is filled. with niggers jews and wetbacks. Plus chinks now he drinks. hour after hour screaming white power. Motherfucker want me to call him sire. he wanna take me higher. Chorus. Shit he wanna take me higher. Shit wait until they get a load of me. Shit shit shit. Verse 3:. A girl gets date raped just like that. at a frat now she chase the cat. Feminist saying women is God's gift. do you need a lift can I take a sniff. Do I sound sexist cause I'm chasin'. after Deja she from Texas?. Down to kick the asses of the fascists. who wanna put me in the oven and burn me to ashes. but I'm not burnin' the world keeps turnin'. and nobody learnin'. 'Cause college is full of shit. teachin' me to memorize nothin' but the lies. Chillin' at a rally for peace. the beast from white power up in the tower. with the M-1 gun and a scope on dope. thinkin' he's the great white hope. Motherfucker levels off. he wanna see me 6 feet deep shoveled off. Cause Columbus University is nothing but a empire. who wanna take me higher. Chorus:. Shit they wanna take me higher. Wait until they get a load of me. Shit they wanna take me higher. They wanna take me higher. Unh damn they wanna take me higher. Damn wait until they get a load of me. Damn unh they wanna take me they wanna take me."

I don't know what else I can do. to keep my ass up out of jail. I wanna be like Tiger Woods,. swing that club, make you sick. (I wanna be like Pacman Jones). (I wanna be like Michael Vick). (I wanna be like Barry Bonds). (I wanna be like O.J. Simpson). Leave this field, leave this prison,. tell you motherfuckers where to kiss 'em. I wanna be all broke up, movin' all old and slow.

I'd rather have my ass kissed up in Bloomingdale. You can go be a pimp, you can go be a hoe. But you only gon' get paid off what you know. If you don't know shit, then you can't work for me. Cause you read your first book in the penitentiary. [Chorus - X2]. If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality. How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?. If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality. How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?"

horny lil' devil,"Intro:. You are the prince of darkness. Arch enemy, father of evil. Hell born, demonic, savage, fierce, viscious, wild. Tameless, barbaric, uncontrollabe, obstinate beast. Verse one:. Horny little devil, you gotta back up. Horny little devil, you can’t bust a nut. Lookin at my girlfriend’s black skin. You wanna jump in, but she don’t like white men. So don’t throw that work you fuckin jerk. Or get your punk devil ass hurt motherfucker. She ain’t with the pale face. Cause y’all fuck at a snail’s pace. And you might get sprayed with mace. By the ebony. So when she’s doing her job you better let her be. Don’t try to pinch the gluterus. Thinkin that you about to knock out the uterus. Cause she’ll tell you to kiss her ass quick. And where I’m from, devils get their ass kicked. Mr. sexual harrasment. Asking for a blow while the answer is fuck no. Looks like you wanna terminate. But that’s when I go psycho like norman bates. I wanna kill the devil for talkin shit. Cause he can’t get a taste of the chocolate. African breast; cause white bitches got no butt and no chest. Black women have bodies like goddesses. Sorta like venus, but put away your penis. Cause the devil is a savage motherfucker. That’s why I’m lighter than the average brother. Cause you raped our women and we felt it. But it’ll never happen again if I can help it (me neither). Cause nobody in my neighborhood has caught jungle fever yet. So horny little devil, you better listen. Before your ass comes up missin. And it’s like that. Verse two:. Now you wanna get me. Horny little must be a f-a-g. Tryin to fuck me out my land and my manhood. Got broke eating spam and canned goods. Locking down on my neighborhoods. Treat me less than a man cause right now you got the upper hand. But my ass is a virgin. You mignt have fucked the indians. But you can’t surgeon me. And when I’m on top I wont be fuckin ya. I’d rather put a buck in ya. Cause I hate the devil with a passion. And when I see the whites of his eyes I start blastin. Dig a hole and throw his ass in. And I won’t be happy til I’m down to my last ten. Get his fuckin pitchfork. Tie him up, and then feed the bitch pork. Little devil wanna fuck me out my pay. But horny little devil true niggaz aren’t gay. And you can’t play with my yo-yo. And definitely can’t play with me you fuckin homo. Cause we’ll blow your head off. And turn that white sheet into a red cloth. Plus when they’re all dead. I can quit that jheri juice and get a bald head. Then let it nap up. Go down to the corner store and beat the jap up. Clean all the crap up. Out my city. Now the whole block look shitty. Put his dick on a wood block. Swing swing swing, and chop chop chop. Now who’s the next to nut. Color me badd, but you can’t sex me up. So don’t even try to put a dick in a die. Because this is what why in 1991 i’ma get my gun. Put an end to the devil, so get a fucking shovel. (repeat chorus). ---------------------------------------------. [Fornecido por TzSF7]"

how to survive in south central,"""And now, the wonderous world of.."". ""Hey, come to Los Angeles!. You and your family can have peace and tranquility.. Enjoy the refinement.."". ""Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?"". ""Hello, my name is Elaine --. and I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles"". [Ice Cube]. How to survive in South Central (what you do?). A place where bustin a cap is fundamental. No, you can't find the shit in a handbook. Take a close look, at a rap crook. Rule number one: get yourself a gun. A nine in your ass'll be fine. Keep it in your glove comparment. cause jackers (yo) they love to start shit. Now if you're white you can trust the police. but if you're black they ain't nothin but beasts. Watch out for the kill. Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel. and don't get smart. Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson. on stayin alive. In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive. ""Hi this is Elaine again.. Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles,. or is somebody taking your things? Have you witneesed a driveby?. Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready. to witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police,. so you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again."". ""This is Los Angeles."" ""This is Los Angeles."". [Ice Cube]. Rule number two: don't trust nobody. especially a bitch, with a hooker's body. cause it ain't nuttin but a trap. And females'll get jacked and kidnapped. You'll wind up dead. Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red. cause most niggaz get got. in either L.A., Compton or Watts. Pissed-off black human beings. So I think you better skip the sight-seeing. And if you're nuttin but a mark. make sure that you're in before dark. But if you need some affection mate. Make sure the bitch ain't a section eight. cause if so that's a monkey-wrench hoe. and you won't survive in South Central. ""Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be.. You realize that it's fucked up!. It ain't nothin like the shit you saw on TV.. Palm trees and blonde bitches?. I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on;. punk motherfucker!"". And you need your ass straight smoked. Yo I wanna say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill. Sir Jinx, aiyyo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is. So show these motherfuckers what's happenin. Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central. God damnit!. [Ice Cube]. Rule number three: don't get caught up. Cause niggaz are doing anything that's thought up. And they got a vice. on everything from dope, to stolen merchandise. We discern. cause South Central L.A., is one big yearn. Waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease. and start slangin ki's. to an undercover or the wrong brother. And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker. So don't take your life for granted. cause it's the craziest place on the planet. In L.A. heroes don't fly through the sky of stars. they live behind bars. So everybody's doin a little dirt. And it's the youngsters puttin in the most work. So be alert and stay calm. as you enter, the concrete Vietnam. You say, the strong survive. Shit, the strong even die, in South Central. Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass,. you tramp-ass hoes? You better watch out.. And for you so called baller-ass niggaz,. you know what time it is. South Central ain't no joke.. Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers.. Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god damnit.. You'll sho' get got, just like that.. This ain't no joke motherfuckers.. Now I wanna send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer,. puttin his two cents in..."
i ain't the one,"Intro: girl, Ice Cube. [Ice Cube, do you think you could give me some money to get. my hair done?] How short's your hair right now?. [Well you know I get it done every week, and I need my nails. done too] Look, I'ma tell you like this. Verse One:. I ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt. See I'm from the street, so I know what's up. On these silly games that's played by the women. I'm only happy when I'm goin up in em. But you know, I'm a menace to society. But girls in biker shorts are so fly to me. So I step to em, with aggression. Listen to the kid, and learn a lesson today. See they think we narrow minded. Cause they got a cute face, and big-behinded. So I walk over and say ""How ya doin?"". See I'm only down for screwin, but you know. ya gotta play it off cool. Cause if they catch you slippin, you'll get schooled. And they'll get you for your money, son. Next thing you know you're gettin their hair and they nails done. Fool, and they'll let you show em off. But when it comes to sex, they got a bad cough. Or a headache, it's all give and no take. Run out of money, and watch your heart break. They'll drop you like a bad habit. cause a brother with money yo, they gotta have it. Messin with me though, they gets none. You can't juice Ice Cube girl, cause I ain't the one. Interlude One:. [Girrrrrl, you got to get these brothers for all the money. you can honey. Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't. do nothin for me but get out of my face.]. [I know what you mean girl, it ain't nothin right jumpin off. unless he got dollars]. Verse Two:. Sometimes I used to wonder. How the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number. He's gettin juiced for his ducats. I tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket. And won't think nuttin of it. She can ride or walk, either leave it or love it. I show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say. I'm a ruthless N-I double-G A. Cause I'm gamin on a female that's gamin on me. You know I spell girl with a B. A brother like me is only out for one thing. I think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no. flowers to your doorstep, when we goin out. Cause you'll take it for granted, no doubt. And after the date, I'ma want to do the wild thing. You want lobster huh? I'm thinking Burger King. And when I take you, you get frustrated. You can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it. But you see, I don't go nuts. Over girls like you with the BIG ol butts. It start comin out the pocket, to knock it. But when the damage is done.... You can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl. For the simple fact that, I ain't the one. Interlude Two:. [I don't care how they look if they got money,. we can hook up but they ain't gettin none.]. [Yeah I just make em think they gonna get some,. play up they mind a lil bit, and get that money.]. [Oh Ice Cube, can I have some money pleeeease?]. Verse Three:. Give you money why bother. Cause you know I'm lookin nothin like your father. Girl, I can't be played or ganked. Ganked means getting took for your bank. Or your gold or your money or something. Nine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing. They get mad when I put it in perspective. But let's see if my knowledge is effective. To the brothas man they robbing you blind. Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind. Keep your money to yourself homie. and if you got enough game. You'll get her name and her number. Without going under.

The baby came out and said ""Run-DMC"". (Ice Cube). I knew this girl who looked just like you. Light brown and a fly hair-do. I wanted to do her, screw her. So I stepped to her. On-key bitch had more ass than a donkey. I said you're the type of girl that I can't pass over. Give me one chance and I'll bend your ass over. Just call me the plumber at the end of the night. Cause a nigga like me'll lay plenty of pipe. She didn't get offended it was splendid to me. Cause mister nice guy is what I pretended to be. I guess I just wine her and dine her. And by the end of the night I'll be behind her. Waxing that ass like Rain Dance. On the bumper get the pussy then I dump her. Took her to the Comfort Inn. Tucked her in. Pulled out the third leg pumped it in. She said will you call me. Yeah I'll call you a bitch or a hoe after I ball ya. Naw I'm just playin but it's still the same."

[Hook]. It takes a nation of niggas to hold us back (x3). It takes a nation of niggas and streets of crack"
it was a good day,"Just waking up in the morning gotta thank God. I don't know but today seems kinda odd. No barking from the dogs, no smog. And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog. I got my grub on, but didn't pig out. Finally got a call from a girl wanna dig out. Hooked it up on later as I hit the do'. Thinking will i live, another twenty-fo'. I gotta go cause I got me a drop top. And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop. Had to stop at a red light. Looking in my mirror not a jacker in sight. And everything is alright. I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night. Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all. Which court, are y'all playin basketball?. Get me on the court and I'm trouble. Last week fucked around and got a triple double. Freaking brothers everyway like M.J.. I can't believe, today was a good day. Drove to the pad and hit the showers. Didn't even get no static from the cowards. Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me. Saw the police and they rolled right past me. No flexin, didn't even look in a niggaz direction. as I ran the intersection. Went to $hort Dog's house, they was watchin Yo! MTV. Raps. What's the haps on the craps. Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em. Roll em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break em. With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven. Seven even back do' Joe I picked up the cash flow. Then we played bones, and I'm yellin domino. and now i am yelling dominoes. Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.. Today was a good day. Left my niggaz house paid. Picked up a girl been tryin to fuck since the twelve. grade. It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic. The Lakers beat the Supersonics I felt on the big. fat. fanny. Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny. And my dick runs deep so deep so deep. put her ass to sleep Woke her up around one. she didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun. Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting. Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel. motion. I was glad everything had worked out. Dropped her ass off, then I chirped out. Today was like one of those fly dreams. Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams. No helicopter looking for a murder. Two in the morning got the fat burger. Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp. And it read Ice Cube's a pimp. Drunk as hell but no throwing up. Half way home and my pager still blowing up. Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.. I got to say it was a good day.. (Ice Cube). Hey wait, wait a minute fool. Stop the shit. What the fuck am I thinking about?"
it's a man's world,"(Ice Cube). Women they're good for nothing no maybe one thing. To serve needs to my ding-a-ling. I'm a man who loves the one-night stand. Cause after I do ya. Huh I never knew ya. Cause to kick it man it gives me the fits. They wanna lay with they nose under your armpits. Ice Cube won't wait so give it up cow. After we do it you can go home now. I'm a brother with a big long.... (Yo-Yo). First of all let me tell you my name it's Yo-Yo. When down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no. Yo-Yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in. Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in. No, Yo-Yo's not a hoe or a whore. And if that's what you're here for. Exit through the door. There's more. To see of me but you're blind so. Women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0. (Ice Cube). Ay what up buttercupper Miss Yo-Yo. I know you like to rap and like to flow so. But when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world. Stay down and play the playground you little girl. (Yo-Yo). What you're saying I don't consider it as rapping. Cause you're on rewind and I'm the new what's-happening. It never fails I'll always get respect. And you lose so take a rain check. (Ice Cube). Hell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second. If it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant. And barefoot complaining that your back is aching. Shaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon. (Yo-Yo). Well you're mistaken. It's not going that far. I make brothers like you play the back yard. You used to flow with the title but I took it. Bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it. (Ice Cube). Damn it look it. Cause you're talking a lot of bull. (Yo-Yo). Well I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull. (Ice Cube). This is a man's world thank you very much. (Yo-Yo). But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch. <Break>. (Ice Cube). Ah Miss Yo-Yo so what gives. I hear females always talkin about women's lib. Well get your own crib. And stay there. Instead of having more babies for the welfare. Cause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger. The name is Ice Cube you know that I ain't the nigga. For you to look at when your hair get nappy. So take a piece of the pole and be happy. (Yo-Yo). Hell no because to me you're not a thriller. You come in the room with your three-inch killer. Thinking you can do damage to my backbone. Leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown. I'm a put it like this my man. Without us your hand would be your best friend. So give us credit like you know you should. If I don't look good you don't look good. (Ice Cube). I doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant. (Yo-Yo). But you don't know how funky that I can get. (Ice Cube). This is a man's world thank you very much. (Yo-Yo). But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch. <Break>. (Ice Cube). Man women I put a lot of fear in em. Cause I had it up to here with em. Drink a beer with em. No way cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day. Yeah if you know what I mean baby. (Yo-Yo-). Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe. If you was more of a man instead of faking it. Women deserve the credit when they're making it. (Ice Cube). Yeah so what's the problem. (Yo-Yo). Well I think we solved it. I know they know the best male from who's doggin it. (Ice Cube). Yeah I admit you can flow. (Yo-Yo). Well that's true. (Ice Cube). But you see I'm a pro with the bank too. (Yo-Yo). Yeah I can see you got it good. (Ice Cube). Oh that I know. (Yo-Yo). But you see you're not better than Yo-Yo. The brand-new intelligent black lady. (Ice Cube). You're kinda dope but you still can't fade me. (Yo-Yo). So what up then. (Ice Cube). Girl what you tryin to do. (Yo-Yo). To prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through. (Ice Cube). This is a man's world thank you very much. (Yo-Yo). But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch. (Ice Cube)"

I'm a champion, I do what can't be done,. In the real league nerd, not the fantasy one. Throw your hands up, you can cheer for your boy,. When I hit the stage get an ear full of noise,. When I bring the noise from here to Illinois,. Motherfuckers love when I do what it does,. A allstar, superstar entertainer,. World class, first ?ballot? hall-of-famer,.

Don't let your motherfucking talent go to waste,. Don't catch a case cause these people got a place,. To throw your life away and take you right out the waste,. Throw your hands up, you got to man up,. I had to show the world, what I was made of,. What you say Blood, I was a ?slad? 'cause,. Now I'm V.I.P., up in Vegas,. I'm up in Nike-town, so how you like me now,. See the whole industry had to bite my style,. [Chorus]. See my head is so big they call me 'jack in the box',. I knew we would win so I'm bagging a lot,.

man vs machine,"[Intro]. Yo, we in a fight for our lives. We in a fight for our lives. And the trick thing about it. I don't know if we can win. And what's sad? i don't thing we WANNA win. Can you help me? a n-gga need a job. I'm desperate, for some corn on the cob. I'm helpless, will i have to steal and rob?. No black? dinner so i got to ask bob. Bob got a job but it's done by a robot. No lunch breaks so it could do a whole lot. More than a human being and it's European,. Ran by a Korean, American,. So there I am, surrounded by aluminum. There's no way you can run,. There's no way you can be,. It's just and me, versus modern day machinery. [Chorus]. It's man vs machine baby. My head's in the guillotine baby. It might take it off clean baby. Automated dreams it was man vs machine baby (2x). I'm a fly caught in the web. A fish stuck in the internet. Don't they know i'm a deathly catch?. Eat this meat, every bite so full of stress. So what can I say to you?. I'm highly relatable and biodegradable. I thought we was unfadeable. Slaves to machinery, is that the way to go?. I don't need you to f**** 24/7. I guess that computer love. I don't need you to love. Human contact ain't what it used to was. [Chorus]. It's man vs machine baby. My head's in the guillotine baby. It might take it off clean baby. Automated dreams it was man vs machine baby (2x). The whole world is automated. It need to be investigated. When people are eliminated. What we supposed to do when its time to feed all the babies? (2x)"

Sit your ass back and comprehend,. as I let you know about man's best friend.. Now remember, it used to be a dog like Lassie,. but now in '91 it's a gun if you ask me.. Just like a jimmy hat's used for protection,. I use my nine when suckers start to flex it.. 'Cause if you run up and try to play mine,. I rather have a AK than a fucking K9.. 'Cause if you shot your gun and my dog tries to fetch ya,. me and the dog's going out on a stretcher.. And I ain't with that, so I gotta get that. big black gat, aim and I hit that.. Forget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the (??),. nowadays, a gat is man's best friend.. man's best friend. Verse two:. Here is the reason why Ice Cube's packed,. just in case the little punks try to jack.. I can't put a motherfucking pitbull under a coat,. and a small on my back.. So I gotta take my beret off, and I betcha. It'll probably work a 100 percent better.. 'Cause it'll keep me out of danger,. with sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber.. So this goes to all y'all intruders,. beware of the owner, 'cause the owner is a shooter.. I don't just wanna give your ass rabies,. I rather have your ass pushing up daisies.. And I can't do that with Benji,. Rin Tin Tin, or Spotch McKinsey. Forget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the (??),. nowadays, a gat is man's best friend.. ""Just don't let me see you shoot no dogs"". ""Hey, I got shots fired here, send me another unit"". ""The profile of a typical American gun owner is this:. over thirty, white, male, middle class"" --> Peter Jennings."

Verbally call the Maniac and his attack dogs. Signing contracts with automatic jack clause. Mack 10:. I get full of their shit and take flight on these niggas. 'Bout to show these so-called.

Just put the car in drive, we can go ride- get this money. Determined as the Energized Bunny, make a left. Underground parking, guns start sparkin'. ATF enemies all around start chargin'. Tryin' to fuck up my new suit and my weekend. Ask me what you want, you bitch! I ain't speakin'. Mack 10:. Shit, I gives a fuck what the next nigga think.

Now, I can blow your brains out, punk and act the fuckin' fool. Or you can hand your guns over, and let everything be cool. But know this: I won't hesitate to peel your wig back. I'm off that wet-bomb and the whole fifty yak. It's Mack the Maniac, nigga. Chorus. Verse 3. Ice Cube:. What's the plan? Everything thought out. Everything bought out, like Bill Gates. My niggas love steel weights. I'm still great, after 12 muthafuckin' years. I (?) your ass after 12 muthafuckin' beers. I act kind to my peers and everybody that listen. They know when the Brainiac's missin'. The big fish, hanging with the chicken hawk. Got all the haters, claimin' that they wanna talk. Mack 10:. You argue wit 'em and negotiate, and I really wanna kill 'em. I'm tired of the bullshit, man I really wanna peel 'em. Dog, I knew they were scareless. 'Cause my brother Snoop told us. So fuck the money and the dope that they punk-ass owe us. Now when I see 'em, it ain't no question it's all the way on. But I'mma wait in front of they momma house. For that one nigga to get home. And when I gun, watch his body jump. And it's all going to amaze me. To see his own self. Layin' there with his own brains on the pavement. Chorus. Outro: Mack 10.

They want to give me ten in the pen cause I'm smelling like Hen. My skin is my sin. My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N (""Burning our black skin"") (Repeat 2x). [Ice Cube]. I Get Around like Tupac, just bought a new glock. And I want what you got. So please give it up so I can live it up. Just like the rich but I still eat grits. I don't know karate. But I can still beat the dog shit out of Nazis. You claim you want to put in work. Plotting to blow up a church. See you devils are all the same. You'll gun down a congregation in Jesus' name. Using me as a scapegoat, well cracker don't sleep. Far from a goat, more like a black sheep. Lamb of God, and it's odd. That Allah is a man that don't need a tan. And you can't stand when I talk like that. And why do black men have to walk like that?. Cause we swing low like a chariot. And now I got Harriet all on my dick. Cause my shoe size is much bigger than a motherfucking 10. My skin is my sin. My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N (""Burning our black skin"") (Repeat 2x). [W.C.]. Who's that janky-ass nigga with last?. Standing like a G pissing on America's flag. Dub C, the nigga from Westside. Westide Maad Circle bailing with a double barrel. Cause uh, my skin is my sin. And all I need is knowledge of self and ammunition is my best friend. When it's time to roll nigga, we ain't calling on Jesus. I'm calling Mad Dog for the 9 millimeters. Cause I give the song with those peckerwoods to the fullest. And a bitch by the name of America's on it. The same bitch that jacked my forefathers. And the Indians took my motherfucking religion. Place a holy Bible in my hand, but for what?. Like Jim Kelly said, ""You try to set me up?"" Shit.... I'm too slick for your lies in disguise. When will you devils open your eyes and realize?. Like Pepsi, niggas got a new generation. And we don't want your American education. Ain't no brain washing this way. Fuck America, Tom Meztger, and KKK. And to the cracker named J.B. Stoner. Don't let me catch you on no corners. I see you on TV talking more shit. But just like your punk-ass anscestors, you's a bitch. You's a bitch if I ever saw one. Grand Wizard bring your ass on Imperial so we can get physical. And watch God show and prove. Not only mentally but physically the black man rules. So run devil run, you's to best start running. Because the niggas are coming, oh, the niggas are coming. And ain't no way you gon' win. Cause I come from a tribe of O.G.'s and my skin is my sin."
my summer vacation,"[airline attendant]. This is the final boarding call for flight 1259. departing from Los Angeles, final destination to St. Louis. Thank you. [Ice Cube]. Damn G, the spot's gettin hot. So how the fuck am I supposed to make a knot?. Police looking at niggaz through a microscope. In L.A. everybody and they momma sell dope. They trying to stop it. So what the fuck can I do to make a profit?. Catch a flight to St. Louis. That's cool, cause nobody knew us. We stepped off the plane. Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers. Rented a car at wholesale. Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel. Unpacked and I grab the three-eighty. Cause where we stayin, niggaz look shady. But they can't fade South Central. Cause bustin a cap is fundamental. Checkin out every block close. Seein which one will clock the most. Yeah this is the one no doubt. Bust a U Bone, and let's clear these niggaz out. Ay ay man, whassup nigga?. Yo, well this Lench Mob nigga!. *gun shots*. Now clearin em out meant casualties. Still had the L.A. mentality. Bust a cap, and out of there in a hurry. Wouldn't you know, a driveby in Missouri. Them fools got popped. Took their corner next day, set up shop. And it's better than slangin in the Valley. Triple the profit makin more than I did in Cali. Breakin off rocks like Barney Rubble. Cause them mark-ass niggaz don't want trouble. And we ain't on edge when we do work. Police don't recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts. Getting bitches and they can't stand a. Nineteen-ninety-one Tony Montana. Now the shit's like a war. of gang violence, where it was never seen before. Punks whirl when the gat bust. Four jheri curl niggaz kickin up dust. And some of them are even lookin up to us. Wearing our colors and talkin that gang fuss. Giving up much love. Dyin for a street, that they ain't even heard of. But other motherfuckers want to stand strong. So you know the phrase, once again it's on. [TV announcer]. Top of the news tonight, gangs from South Central. Los Angeles which are known for their driveby shootings. have migrated into East St. Louis. leaving three dead and two others injured. No arrests have been made. Police say this is a nationwide trend. with similar incidents occuring in Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma. (female voice repeating in background:. ""If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere""). [Ice Cube]. BOOM, my homie got shot he's a goner black. St. Louis niggaz want they corner back. Shooting in snowy weather. It's illegal business, niggaz still can't stick together. Fuckin police got the four-one-one. that L.A. ain't all, surf and sun. But we ain't thinkin, bout the boys. Feudin, like the Hatfields and McCoys. Now the shit's gettin tricky. Cause now they lookin for the colors and the khakis. Damn, the spot's gettin hot from the battle. About to pack up and start slangin in Seattle. But the NARCs, raid about six in the morning. Try to catch a nigga while he's yawnin. Put his glock to my chest as I paused. Went to jail in my motherfuckin drawers. Tryin to give me, fifty-seven years. Face'll be full of those tattooed tears. It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck. And the public defender ain't givin a fuck. The fool must be sparkin. Talkin about a double life plea bargain. You got to deal with the Crips and Bloods by hand G. Plus the Black Guerilla family. And the white pride don't like Northside. And it's a riot if any more niggaz die. No parole or probation. Now this is a young man's summer vacation. No chance for rehabilitation. Cause look at the motherfuckin years that I'm facin. I'ma end it like this cause you know what's up."

non believers,"To all the non-believers (Non-believers, non-believers, non-believers). (Non-believers, non-believers, non-believers, non-believers). I make a non-believer say, ""Oh my God"". Ain't nothin' too incredible for the Wizard of Oz. Ain't nothin' too regretable for me to lose no sleep. These the cards I was dealt, bitch, read 'em and weep. It's that West side rollin, pussies get swollen. Knockin' niggas down in the pen, I'm bowlin'. Controllin' everything I'm holdin'. I made a promise to myself. I'ma keep it gangsta always even in the hallways of corporate America, break down the barrier. Self-made, Koolaid, fuck what you say. Fuck what he say, pimpin' ain't easy. Don Mega put a dagger in your swagger. Rollin' zones, tell Mick Jagger. Fuck the chit-chatter. I got a bladder full of red cup liquor, yes, my nigga.

In my hood he like Treyvon, try me. I'm walkin' home with my Skittles. The neighborhood watch first house to get riddled. Bust, leave bullets in your pillow. You fuckin' hero, don't make that bitch a widow. This gon' hurt just a little. White people, stop sayin' ""ghetto"". It's like the pot callin' the kettle. Damn, you the reason why we ghetto. We got some non-believers out there. Make believers outta non-believers. Make believers out the overseers. Make 'em bow down when they need us. They got to bow down when they need us.

Her brother walked in he's into gangbangin. cause he walked up and said ""what set you claimin"". I don't bang I write the good rhymes. The whole scenery reminded me of Good Times. I hate to feel bad but I'm in a rut. by a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up. Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth. and fired up the sess it was sess no doubt.

Some niggaz gettin' nuts outa carafel cups (punk). Fool you on master's woe. But won't even think about, sucking Bob Doe (punk). Asshole from the Senate. How can you relate to a project tennant?.

rollin' wit the lench mob,"You can't fuck with the criminal rapping over gangsta shit. First I load the clip and then I make the hit. I know some y'all can't fade this. Lench Mob niggas are the craziest. So you and your boys are ass-out. When I'm rollin in a seven-deuce glass house. The Mob ain't nothing but a menace. When we get the motherfucking dog in us. Playing them old beats. I'm pouring out some of my beer for my homies. Ready to peel your cap. You can't believe ""Faces of Death"" on wax. Some say the Mob ain't positive. Man fuck that shit cause I gots to live. How I live and you could either give a fuck punk. Yo or get your ass bucked. Some rappers are heaven-sent. But Self-Destruction don't pay the fucking rent. So you can either sell dope or get your ass a job. I'd rather roll it wit the Lench Mob. To be down with the Mob is simple. Mind your own you want a spot find your own. And take mine if you're badder than the strong man. I do the right thing I do the wrong thing. Do anything cause I ain't faking the scene. It's all about how much bacon you bring. And if you see something from the gat I will stuff it. Yo you ain't seen nothing. Cause if you testify you're living blind. Cause in the city you live and let die. Rolling with the fools One Time can't beat. On my knees in the street interlock my hands and feet. He said ""I know you"" I said ""you might. My name is Ice Cube I did a song you didn't like"". So he soaked me up like Bounty. Had to do a week in the county. A piece of cake it was just like a party. Cause in the county you know everybody. No I didn't kill or steal or rob. Locked up for what cause I'm rollin wit the Lench Mob. If you know a female that's rollin with the Lench Mob. Watch your step cause the gat is kept. In the purse like my homegirl Yo-Yo. You gotta be down and you can't be a hoe no. Cause if you are I'll be the first one to bust you out. After my crew I'll be the first one to rush you out. Get the picture or bitch. You'll get the eighty-six. If she wanna try and mix. Business and pleasure make up your own mind. You gotta be a hoe on your own time. Don't sleep cause even on a solo creep. Yo the Mob is still deep. And we'll play ya just like a nit-wit. You thought you got with the crew you can't get with. So get the noose ready for the lynching. Now 235 is what I'm benching. But nowadays it's still not enough. I got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush. Give me the gat, step back, and watch me do the job."

Ice Cube, true MC, write everything I say, even back in the day. Imma spit it, how I feel it, fuck a gimmick. You can keep your catchy lines, imma 'bout to write a rhyme. If you got backpack, tryin act black. Think you know the culture, you'z a fuckin vulture. You never a approached the mic. You dress like a dike, sayin what you don't like. Who deserves five mics, who deserves two. But the nigga wit two still can serve you. This West Coast, flow is different in the East. But in ain't no different in the streets. Chorus:. I'm spittin pollaseeds. I crack'em one by one cause I dont want to be greedy. Cause the salt might make it so. I'm spittin pollaseeds. I crack'em one by one cause I dont want to be greedy. Cause, these niggas is salty. Will make you choke ohh oh. You miggas got me fucked up. Ice Cube:. I'm spittin pollaseeds on the portch, with the torch. In case these niggas come around to see the porche. When I branish, motherfuckers vanish. They don't understand like a nigga speak in spanish. No comprende, me no speak no englehh. Here a fuck(smack)Now yo ass feelin' tingle. Now you doin shit like Darrel Stingleeh. Dont get stung by the motherfuckin sting ray. Keep it movin niggas, y'all better king me. Put your rap careers up on e-bay. Crazy toons is the motherfuckin dj. Baby drop to your knees, he deserves a BJ. I got a big brother, nicknamed CJ. When you see him in the hood take it eazy. If you a breezehh, take him to the heezehh. Do him like Halley Barry did Michael Eleehh. Chorus. WC:. I ain't playin. I got pulled over by the police. And I had some pollaseeds in my hand.

I won't pretend, or act like I'm knowin you. But check it out I understand what you goin through. [Chorus: sung from samples]. But remember, brothers and sisters. You can still, stand, tall. Just be thankful.... For what you got. [Ice Cube]. I know what y'all motherfuckers thinking, heh heh. Here comes another rapper with a song about hope. All you wanna hear is a song about dope. And how a nigga got mo' money than the Pope. But he'll never tell you when he drop the soap. No~! Ice Cube is here to drop you a note. Cause some of our folk used to hang from ropes. And some of our people used to hang from trees. Now the only thing hangin muh'fucker is DEEZ. So, get your mind right, and I'ma rhyme right. Fuck the limelight, and a blind dyke. I'm the sunlight, too bright to look. When it's all said and done I should write the book. You too cool for school, too old to know?. Get your ass off the grassroots and let 'em grow. I understand, it ain't no love lost. But little kids, it ain't no Santa Claus. [Chorus]. [Ice Cube]. Yeah, f'real. I was born in the mud but I came out clean. That's 'til the government tried to intervene. Tried to lock me up when I was only 19. Don't never ever ever let 'em kill your dream. I make shit raw that piss off the law. If you want some fake shit turn this off. If you want some realness I know you can feel this. Maybe we can heal this just like an illness. Black on black, I got'cho back. People don't think that we know how to act. Just because our neighborhood is filled with crack. And the CIA, won't take it back. Never on top, always on the bottom. Never put your trust in Hillary Rodham. Cause I can tell you now it's gon' turn out rotten. Keep on pushin, get 'em 'til we got 'em. [Chorus]. [Ice Cube]. Stand up, f'real.... Raise your hand if you sick of this bullshit. Heh, in the belly of the evil empire [fades]"

Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at. Lench Mob ain't nuttin but tramps. But hoes lickin us like stamps. One fool brought the music for the yams. But Ice Cube had more amps, get in bitch. Cause I had the jam on. And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon. Give me the nappy and make me happy. The hoe said 'Pappy could you slap me. on the ass hard and fast. and could please try not to leave a gash?'. I said yeah, but I don't play sex. When I'm putting on the latex. Slipped on the condom. Fucked around and dropped the bomb son. And it came out sort of like confetti."

Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off. You too, boy, if ya fuck with me. The police are gonna hafta come and get me. Off yo ass, that's how I'm goin out. For the punk motherfuckers that's showin out. Niggaz start to mumble, they wanna rumble. Mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo. Goin off on a motherfucker like that. with a gat that's pointed at yo ass. So give it up smooth. Ain't no tellin when I'm down for a jack move. Here's a murder rap to keep yo dancin. with a crime record like Charles Manson. AK-47 is the tool. Don't make me act the motherfuckin fool. Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe. I'm knockin niggaz out tha box, daily. yo weekly, monthly and yearly. until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly. that I'm down with the capital C-P-T. Boy you can't fuck with me. So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck. Coz Ice Cube is crazy as fuck. As I leave, believe I'm stompin. but when I come back, boy, I'm comin straight outta Compton. Refrão:. [City of Compton, City of Compton]. [Eazy E] Yo Ren. [MC Ren] Whassup?. [Eazy E] Tell em where you from!. Verso 2: MC Ren. Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga. More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger. I'm a bad motherfucker and you know this. But the pussy ass niggaz don't show this. But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps. If not from the records, from jackin the crops. Just like burglary, the definition is 'jackin'. And when illegally armed it's called 'packin'. Shoot a motherfucker in a minute. I find a good piece o' pussy, I go up in it. So if you're at a show in the front row. I'm a call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho. You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to. But that shows me, slut, you're composed to. a crazy muthafucker from tha street. Attitude legit cause I'm tearin up shit. MC Ren controls the automatic. For any dumb muthafucker that starts static. Not the right hand cause I'm the hand itself. every time I pull a AK off the shelf. The security is maximum and that's a law. R-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw. See, coz I'm the motherfuckin villain. The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin. that's takin place without a clue. And once you're on the scope, your ass is through. Look, you might take it as a trip. but a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip. Straight outta Compton.... Refrão:. [City of Compton, City of Compton]. [Dr. Dre] Eazy is his name and the boy is comin.... Verse Three: Eazy-E. ...straight outta Compton. is a brotha that'll smother yo' mother. and make ya sister think I love her. Dangerous motherfucker raises hell. And if I ever get caught I make bail. See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem. I see a motherfuckin cop I don't dodge him. But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while. And when I see a punk pass, I smile. To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showin a nigga drivin. but don't know where the fuck he's going, just rollin. lookin for the one they call Eazy. But here's a flash, they never seize me. Ruthless! Never seen like a shadow in the dark. except when I unload, see I'll get over the hesitation. and hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration. Give a little gust of wind and I'm jettin. But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin. So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!. You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker!. This is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever fuck with me. You'll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother. word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton. Refrão:. [City of Compton, City of Compton]. [Damn that shit was dope!]"
streets shed tears,"Ooh, ooh, ooh. When the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone. I know the streets will shed tears for me. When my story is over and my song is done. I know the streets will shed tears for me. The end. All I get is motherfuckin' love in these streets. To most of these tricks I'm a motherfuckin' treat. What's beef? I ain't got no beef. See all that bitchin'? It taste like chicken. And all these chickens? They get plucked. And nobody wants to see the volcano erupt. I'm down with Daz 'cause everythang is Kurupt. I'm celebrated every time I pull up. You hella hated, every time you look up. I'm elevated to rapper's deluxe. They love me, dawg, 'cause I'm one of a kind. This is God's plan, homie, it ain't mine. See, this ain't about dyin', it's all about shinin'. It's all about climbin' a hill full of diamonds. I know that you feel it, I know that you felt it. 'Cause a nigga gon' live 'til a nigga can't help it. When the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone. I know the streets will shed tears for me. (They love me, dawg). When my story is over and my song is done. (They love me, dawg). I know the streets will shed tears for me. The end. Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters. All I got is mother fuckers tellin' me I'm the greatest. All I got is those fly ass suits and gators. Nobody servin' Cube but maids and waiters. Nobody tryin' to take my life. All these bitches tryna do is replace my wife. But you hoes ain't cold enough to fuck with Ice. Like Kim she'll run circles 'round you bitches twice. Now, it might get funky but it won't get ugly. Niggas might not like me but they still love me. Niggas might talk shit, they whisper and huddle. 'Cause they know my rebuttal might leave a puddle. Now the streets is talkin' until they see me walkin' up the block, then all the bullshit stop. Anything I do, don't take it personal 'cause when a nigga gone, that shit ain't reversible. When the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone. I know the streets will shed tears for me. (They love me, dawg). When my story is over and my song is done. (They love me, dawg). I know the streets will shed tears for me. The end. I'm the bastard that spit the acid. Fuck a funeral home and a casket. Fuck a funeral song and a procession. Keep God on your dome and count your blessings. Keep the hood in your heart but Heaven on your mind. Shake 'em up and roll seven every time. Pick 'em up, yup, stick 'em up. Every time you see me got a different color cup. This ain't about dyin', it's all about livin'. It's all about makin' everyday Thanksgivin'. It's all about givin', about stayin' driven. It ain't about you, it's about these children. So when a nigga die, stop cryin' and ventin'. Will somebody in here bump George Clinton?. Will somebody in here hug my fam?. Don't worry about me, you know where I am. When the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone. I know the streets will shed tears for me. (They love me, dawg). When my story is over and my song is done. (They love me, dawg). I know the streets will shed tears for me. The end"

take me away,"Ice Cube - Take Me Away (feat. Butch Cassidy). [Intro]. Hahaha, Today was a good day. Know what? Sometimes I just get on my knees. You know what I mean?. And pray to the Man with the master plan. To swoop on down on that mothership. Scoop a nigga up. [Verse 1]. Lord have mercy, my people so thirsty. Come feed 'em, either Jesus or Mohammad. All we get is vomit, come like a comet. Put it in my brain Lord, put it in my stomach. Only you can do it, Imma learn from it. Do what I gotta do, try not to plum it. America used to shoot like reptiles. Don't worry tomorrow, let's get this right now. They wanna run us in the ground. Educate yourself, before they dumb you down. Get your money boy, the legal way. Beat 'em with they own bullshit if you may. Now rich white men they got the world f*cked up. Why should I give a f*ck about a styrofoam cup. Environmental saying, but if I go green. You know what I mean b*tch. [Chorus]. Take me away from these people [x4]. [Verse 2]. Ice Cube for President, let's just do it for the hell of it. See how I run the government. Make money irrelevant. I might tell a chick, it's illegal to resell of it. Secret service don't know where the hell I went. Sorry ya'll, I had to f*ck a super delicate. Dream ticket, Ice Cube and Obama. American dream, Ice Cube and yo mama. The Terminator, are you Sarah Conner?. Arnold Swarchznegger, can kill who he wanna. In California, they strap you to a jurny. And murder your ass, in front of your atourney. Do you really wanna take this journey?. And scared of none of ya'll, muthaf*ckas like bernie. Mad step back, I got the mac 11. Unlike Obama, Imma have to back my Reveron. [Chorus]. Take me away from these people [x4]. [Verse 3]. Now the Lord is my sheppard. My flow is respected, world wide. In the west I got to rep it. So please check it, cause my style is infected. With the virus, Ice Cube's the ocyeros. I bailed through, they wanna put up in bail view. 'Cause my point of view is not red, white and blue. It's black and blue residue. I know what crack can do, to a whole f*ckin' avenue. Spit on it, and they'll get mad at you. You know I do this bullshit for your gratitude. Imma Nigga Witta Attitude. Imma do what I gotta do, just to change my latitude. In the system, rollin' with my diamonds glicnin. And niggas listenin', from your local prison. Imma prism, your only vision is a rainbow in the sky. When I spit the ism. [Chorus]. Take me away from the people [x4]. :::::::::::::::::::::::By Gb®:::::::::::::::::::::::"
tales from the darkside,"Verse One: Ice Cube. Peace. Haha don't make me laugh!. All I hear is muthafucker's talkin' sucotash. Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang. I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigger. How the fuck do you figure?. That I can say peace and the gunshots won't cease. Every cop killin' goes ignored. They just send another nigga to the morgue. A point scored- they could give a fuck about us. They rather catch us with guns and white powder. If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me. Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy. They kill ten of me to get the job correct. To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck. Cuz I'm the one with the trunk of funk. And 'Fuck tha Police' in the tape deck. You should listen to me cuz there's more to see. Call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities. The other color don't know you can run but not hide. These are tales from the darkside.... Verse Two:. You wanna free Africa, I stare at yuh. Cuz we ain't got it too good in America. I can't fuck with them overseas. My homeboy died over a key of cocaine. It was plain and simple. The 9mm went <pop> to the temple. <pop pop pop> was the sound I put the bitch down. And ran to the schoolyard bathroom. Looked in the trash can yo it had room. So I ducked my ass in it for a minute. Covered with sweat I had the layback. Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback. Tonite the crew gonna have a little fun. I went home and cocked the barrel of my shotgun. It's gettin' critical - I start the five point o. There they go - drive real slow. I yelled out 'Ice Cube sucka'. Shot gun hit - and murder mutahfuckers. I told you last album, when I got a sawed off, bodies are hard off. Its a shame, that niggas die young. But to the light side it don't matter none. It'll be a drive by homicide. But to me its just another tale from the darkside.... . Verse Three: Chuck D. Standing in the middle of war. The middle we flex. When we die, they won't make check. Ebony can't see to the darkside. The term they apply to us is a nigga. Call it what you want, cuz I'm comin' from the coroner. Same applies with a PhD. Who'z black - don't wanna role - sells his soul. Watch his head go rollin'. Who the fuck are they foolin'?. Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes. Matches the color of the one on my face as they wonder whats under my waist. [Standin on the verge] of them gettin' brown. thats a fact got a fear on their bozack. Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide."
thank god,"[Intro]. I do Gangsta Rap. They want to blame the world problems on Gangsta Rap. It's our fault;. Coz motherfuckers are dieing in Iraq. It's our fault;.

Thank God that The Gangsta's back (Crazy remix style). [Verse 3]. When will they realise, they'll never stop me. They call me arrogant. They call me cocky. Just because, I wont let them chop me.

But I come up foul then they get knocked out, word. To the brother that rolls the herb. Everybody getting knocked to the curb like that. Jinx got the gat, and it's a fact. He'll kick a funky beat to peel your cap. Now who's the mack?. Who's the hoe?. Who's the trick?. I got many, many styles won't you take a pick. But don't be alarmed. When I trip and stumble and fumble. And drop the (rewind). Drop the bomb. (Break). I'm solo, you ask how I'm living. Still dropping more shit than a pigeon. With the L, the E, the N, the C, the H,. The M, the O, the B, the great. Lyrics that make the beat swing and I gotcha. It's the hip-hopper that don't like coppers. And if you try to upset the pot son. You get kicked in the chest like a shotgun. I make the beats, I make the breaks. I make the rhymes that make you shake. Make you find. Ice Cube never caught in the middle. I make shit to kick you in the ass a little. And still never hesitate to stutter step. Or bust a repitition on the mic. Still dissing all the hype. From left to right. How many left to fight?."

Niggas plotted, to have me knotted up in basements. till these cocksuckers see what they're faced with. Their fantasies of a life stress-free. Full of orgies, in the Florida Keys. But this bullshit is so thick, it's like mountains. Sick of threatenin all my lawyers and accountants. The decibals, gold diggers goin for the testicles. Soon they realise, I don't invest in hoes. Sometimes it's like hell on earth. When everybody tryin to get your ass for all your worth. It's the curse. (The curse, the curse) Do the math baby. (The curse, the curse) Do the math baby. (The curse, the curse) Do the math baby. (The curse, the curse) Do the math. When you hot, they think you got more than you got. When you not, motherfuckers callin you a flop.

And like I said, it's the curse of money. They start laughin at your jokes when they ain't that funny (Ha ha ha). See this ass kissin yes man.

Make me wanna start scrappin and look at me to make it happen. What the fuck was they doin before Mack 10 was rappin ?!? Tell me. (What the fuck?) how can I remain a man of seven figures. when I'm rushed by gold diggers everytime I get bigger? (Ch-ching). Like David Banner, when I tweak I turn green.

And they love my shitty drawers, what you smokin?. Think you got the balls, nigga I'm a Trojan. Catchin all that just like a prophylac'. Don't reproduce, that bullshit is whack. Flavor Flav with a white bitch that is whack. Got to put the nigga back in my Cadillac. Take him to the hood, where it's action packed. Let him know that the target's still on his back.

When they get you in them lonely dark places. Concrete slave ships, never move. Where niggaz like us get used like a mule. Don't let 'em catch you, arrest you. Strip and undress you, throw you in a cesspool. You wanna know the crime of the century. A ghetto elementary, a mental penitentiary. Black man, you never been friend of me. Boy you kin to me, why we enemies?. The ghe-tto is a trap. Fuck where you from, nigga look where you at. Where you wanna be? Point it out on a map. Don't be scared to leave homey, we can come back. If you wanna come back to this bullshit. Most of it comin straight out the pulpit. We got to change our ways in the hood. Understand that it's AIDS in the hood.... The nigga trap...

Soul Train done lost they soul. Just call it train cause the bitches look like hoes. I see a lotta others damn. It almost look like the Bandstand. You ask me did I like Arsenio. About as much as the bicentennial. I don't give a fuck about dissing these fools cause they all scared of. the Ice Cube. And what I say what I portray and all that. And ain't even seen the gat. I don't wanna see no dancing. I'm sick of that shit listen to the hit. Cause yo if I look and see another brother. On the video tryin to out-dance each other. I'm a tell T-Bone to pass the bottle. And don't give me that shit about role model. It ain't wise to chastise and preach. Just open the eyes of each. Cause laws are made to be broken up. What niggas need to do is start loc-ing up. And build mold and fold theyself into shape."

the product,"I was told, cause I didn't witness the whole act. In and out was the movement of the bozack. It was hot and sweaty and lots of pushin. Then the nut came gushin. And it was hell tryin to bail to the ovary. With nuttin but the Lord lookin over me. I was white with a tail. But when I reached the finish line, young black male!. One cell made two, and two cells made fo'. and so on, so now I'm a embryo. Then I got a hunch. that I'ma be on lockdown, for nine months. Chillin, with my mother to guide me. And nuttin but a stomach to hide me. from all that worry and bullshit. Nine months later, I elbow pull and kick. cause my time is up and I don't care. With one big push, I'm outta there. June 15th, it's just my luck. In 1969, a nigga is the product. ""Ghetto ass nigga, you ain't shit,. and you ain't gon' never be shit!"". I learned how to walk and talk and all that. They put me in school, but it don't matter. Cause I'm sittin in history. Learnin bout a sucker, who didn't give a fuck about me. They try to shape us. But I know Uncle Sam is a motherfuckin rapist. So I stopped payin attention. Ice Cube, headed, straight to detention. Fuck that shit, I roam the hallways. I'm sent home and I don't got all A's. A high school dropout. My father had beef so I tried to knock pops out. But I got tossed, he's the boss. I'm out of there and mad cause I lost. Now bein on my own is a factor. So I become, the neighborhood jacker. Gimme your car, run your jewels. Makin a livin robbin fools. And if I let my nine rang out. You know, it'll make your brains hang out. So what's your fate?. Am I the nigga you love, or the one you love to hate?. The wrong answer is said, the nigga fled. I pump lead, now he's in a puddle of red. And if you got a buck, you're shit out of luck. Stuck up by the motherfuckin product. ""Uh-uh motherfucker you gots to get a job. if you wanna stay in my motherfuckin house"". ""Many young men reject the traditional values. that are important to their parents.. Church, school and family. have been replaced by street, turf, and gang."". Twenty-one now, and paid in full. Feelin bad, from all the shit I pulled. on people back in the day. Plus, I got a little baby on the way. So I'm tryin to go straight. I'm with my baby's momma, out on a date. Til the punk ass cops ran my plate. Now I'm on a bus upstate. ""Oh, the young nigga done caught a case!"". ""Sittin in the mess hall, sayin my grace"" -> LL Cool J. Sent to a concrete hoe-house. Where all the products go, no doubt. Yo momma, I gotta do eleven. Livin in a five by seven. Dear baby, your man's gettin worn out. of seein young boys gettin they assholes torn out. And then he got shanked with a spoon. And he was 'sposed to get out soon. Is it my fault, he was caught in production. Where a young black life means nothin. Just because, I didn't want to learn your grammar. you say I'm better off in the slammer. And it's drivin me batty. Cause my little boy, is missin daddy. I'm ashamed, but the fact is. I wish pops let me off on the mattress. Or should I just hang from the top bunk. But that's goin out like a punk. My life is FUCKED!. But it ain't my fault, cause I'm the motherfuckin product. ""He ain't shit"". ."

Tie his feet with some weight, throw his ass in a lake. And then set up a date, between me and his mate. Tell her lobster and steak, and bitch don't be late. Oh the pussy was great, I'm still sealin your fate. Cause you can't imitate, the nigga you love to hate. Chorus. Can I grin, show my fin, I'm down with mack 10. Dub-C, K-Dee, and Kausion. It don't stop, niggaz get to bowin a lot. When we enter the spot, look all the niggaz we got. Worldwide, nigga take a look outside. Got a brother named Clyde, he's like Jekyll and Hyde. Ice Cube is the lick, Westside is the click. (Can't get enough of this gangsta shit). You wanna check our cajones we got the feds up on us. We gotta roll on Daytonas because we know that they want us. And if they catch us in rap, it's a reasonable doubt. My niggaz pointin me out, my momma scream and she shout. But we got enough green, from our triple beam. To hire the prosecution, and the dream team. This world ain't nuttin but a dollar sign (ching ching). I'm a partner in crime, the world is mine. Chorus.

Thinkin will I live, another twenty-for. I gotta go cause I got me a drop top. And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop. Had to stop, at a red light. Lookin in my mirror and not a jacker in sight. And everything is alright. I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night. Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all. Which park, are y'all playin basketball?. Get me on the court and I'm trouble. Last week fucked around and got a triple double. Freakin niggas everyway like M.J.. I can't believe, today was a good day. That's right... Creep to the pad and hit the showers. Didn't even get no static from the cowards. Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me.

Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny. And my jimmy runs deep, so deep. So deep put her butt to sleep. Woke her up around one. She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun. Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin. Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion. I was glad everything had worked out. Dropped her butt off and then chirped out. Today was like one of those fly dreams. Didn't even see a berry flashin those high beams. No helicopter lookin for the murder. Two in the mornin got the Fatburger. Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp. And it read, ""Ice Cube's a pimp"". Drunk as hell but no throwin up. Half way home and my pager still blowin up. Today I didn't even have to use my A.K..

See I'm kind of greedy, cause all my heroes. got zeroes in back of a one. Here's my gun, about to get paid at last. But now I'm gettin covered, in dirt and grass, kick it. [Ice-T]. The madder I get, the higher the debt, the deeper you get. The thicker the sweat. Cause I'm a nigga with fat clout. But ya in, but ya gotta get back out. No easy job, for some suckers is out to rob. Crosshair on your dome and your mind's blown. You wanna go home... ain't that a bitch?. Cube, dig the ditch (yep). Chorus. [Ice-T]. I got a full time job of takin suckers out. Breakin em off, yea word, I love revokin clout. Test me, stress me, who could the best be?. The teflon nine go through vests G. But when you're greedy you don't care about life itself. You're chasin extreme wealth. You can't be trusted cause trust ain't in the fuckin game. Scandalous is your fuckin name. [Ice Cube]. I'm the motherfucker you're stuck wit. Ice Cube -- ""Wronnnnnnng nigga to FUCK WIT!"". I'm rich, pitchin a bitch about gettin mo'. The big fish, swimmin in big dough. The G backstabber, I got ta have a. Lexus Coupe, when I troop. with the ski mask, gotta get the cash."
true to the game,"<Ay, yeah you, motherfucker. You know who I'm talking to. Yeah, you that motherfucker that betrayed your homeboys and you ain't. shit. Yeah, you about to get your motherfucking ghetto pass revoked,. motherfucker. Punk-ass mark, bitch-made. Punk-ass trick in a basket. You got caught up in the mix...>. It's the nigga ya love to hate with a new song. So what really goes on. Nothing but a come-up, but ain't that a bitch. They hate to see a young nigga rich. But I refuse to switch even though. Cause I can't move to the snow. Cause soon as y'all get some dough. Ya wanna put a white bitch on your elbow. Moving out your neighborhood. But I walk through the ghetto and the flavor's good. Little kids jumping on me. But you, you wanna be white and corny. Living way out. ""Nigger go home"" spray-painted on your house. Trying to be White or a Jew. But ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?. Get the hell out. Stop being an Uncle Tom, you little sell-out. House nigga scum. Give something back to the place where you made it from. Before you end up broke. Fuck around and get your ghetto pass revoked. I ain't saying no names, you know who you are. You little punk, be true to the game. BREAK. <Yeah, motherfucker. Yeah, you thought we forgot, huh?. Yeah, get a little money and moves out the neighborhood and shit. But you still ain't shit...>. When you first start rhyming. It started off slow and then you start climbing. But it wasn't fast enough I guess. So you gave your other style a test. You was hardcore hip-hop. Now look at yourself, boy you done flip-flopped. Giving our music away to the mainstream. Don't you know they ain't down with the team. They just sent they boss over. Put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over. On MTV but they don't care. They'll have a new nigga next year. You out in the cold. No more white fans and no more soul. And you might have a heart attack. When you find out the black folks don't want you back. And you know what's worse?. You was just like the nigga in the first verse. Stop selling out your race. And wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face. Niggas always gotta show they teeth. Now I'm a be brief. Be true to the game. BREAK. <Yeah motherfucker. I see you got your fancy cars and shit. But you know what?. You still ain't shit. That's right, I caught you slipping. You know I could've gat you. Yeah, but I didn't even trip...>. A message to the oreo cookie. Find a mirror and take a look, G. Do you like what you see?. But you're quick to point the finger at me. You wanna be the big fish, you little guppy. Black man can't be no yuppie. You put on your suit and tie and your big clothes. You don't associate with the Negroes. You wanna be just like Jack. But Jack is calling you a nigga behind your back. So back off genius. I don't need you to correct my broken English. You know that's right. You ain't white. So stop holding your ass tight. Cause you can't pass. So why you keep trying to pass?. With your black ass. Mister Big. But in reality, you're shorter than a midge. You only got yourself to blame. Get a grip, oreo and be true to the game. <And Ice Cube practices what he preaches. He continues to live in South Central Los Angeles. And he puts his money into projects that improve the neighborhood...>."
turn off the radio,"Turn on the radio take a listen. What you're missing. Personally I'm sick of the ass-kissing. What I'm kicking to you won't get rotation. Nowhere in the nation. Program directors and DJ's ignored me. Cause I simply said fuck Top Forty. And top thirty top twenty and top ten. Until you put more hip-hop in. Then I might grin but don't pretend that you're down with the C. And go and dis me in a magazine. How could you figure the brother could dig ya. DJ face down in the river. No it's not a threat but a promise. I'm as. Crazy as they come see. Mama didn't love me. All I got is my nine. And to calm the savage beast here's the Alpine. <Turn off that bullshit!. Turn off that motherfucking radio!. Turn off that bullshit!. Turn off that motherfucking radio!. Turn off that bullshit!. Play the music motherfucker put the music on. Damn!>. Tune in to the radio listen for a minute. Yo G stick a fucking tape in it. Cause all the radio do is gangle. That R&B love triangle. If you're out there kicking it with the brothers. You don't care about lovers. You wanna hear a young nigga on the mic. Going buck wild. Throwing and flowing and showing new styles. That's where I'm coming from. Reality that's what they're running from. So if you're down with Ice Cube let me know that you know. Yo turn off the radio. <You know what? You know what?. Basically those black guys and those rap guys. They don't know what the fuck they're doing. I hate those fuckers. I hate em. Especially that one guy. The AmeriKKKa's most wanted. Ice Cube--I hate that fucker. Get him off the air, get him off, get him off. Get that rap shit out of here!>."
u ain't gonna take my life,"* Originally appeared as a B-side to Cube's ""Wicked"" single. Mr. Dirty Harry, you look really scary. With your .357, officer Kevin. Spent 11 years on the force trying to get mine. Head got the flat top, boots got the spit shine. Don't give a fuck about my neighborhood. Just wanna do your eight hours, then hit the showers. Shoot a brother down adn you don't send flowers. Goddamn sherrif, can't wait to tarriff. A chunk of a nigga ass, but watch a nigga blast. And get away nigga fast. You ain't gonna have me face down no more. You ain't gonna have a chance to clown no more. To the boys in blue, I got kids too. Ain't going out like a jigaboo, no no no. On my way to the store. You see me in a Range Rover, now you gotta pull me over. But where oh where is the ticket?. You got your hand on your gun cause you're wicked. You don't like the face of the original man. But you gotta treat me like an individual man. Talk right and I'll talk right back. Show some goddamn respect to the black. Cause I gotta get back to my wife. But I'm sorry, you ain't gonna take my life. Just because you got a badge. Did you think Ice Cube was gonna wave the white flag?. Cracker please, you can yell freeze. I'd rather die standing up than die on my knees. You think you can do anything you want to do. To my crew when you come through, man fuck you. Shooting up South Central. Catch your ass slipping at a rent show. Could have popped you off, one dead cop. But I know you got a wife and a dog named Spot. I show a little mercy cause I'm civilized. Looking through a nigga's eyes at a much bigger prize. But when I saw Rodney it got me so hot. Made me wanna go out and pop me a cop. Cause every time you see me sagging. Here comes the Grand Dragon, in the motherfucking patty wagon. Try to play me like a trick. Sometimes you act like a dick, Mr. Nightstick. Back then, I used to throw my Mack-10. But nowadays you got the black skin. Back then you don't like the voice of a nigga named Ice. But you ain't gonna take my life. You man let's get an understanding. I know that your job is demanding. But I only got me one life to live. You only got about six shots to give. And I got a big AK with a 50-round clip. So why should we trip?. You ain't gonna punk me, so what you trying for?. Ain't no job worth dying for, is it?. Might pay a visit to Petey Wheatstraw. When you stop me on the shore, officer of the law. And if I did something wrong, you can lock me up. Never never never gonna sock me up. So next time you have the urge, all of the sudden. To fuck with a nigga for nothing. Think about me, a brother that's 23. I got a son and a J-O-B. So before you pull your gun, you'd better think twice."
until we rich,"[Krayzie Bone]. Nigga the mission's to get what you don't got. The struggle it don't stop, until we drop. [Ice Cube]. Krayzie Bone and Ice Cube...

We's the hitters, that make the ultimate hits. Kinda floss-ey, kinda boss-ey. It's gotta be done my way, do what the {fuck} I say. Top of the pyramid, homey what I tell you. If you leave this Westside umbrella you hit the cellar. Bring me my slippers, black robe, and my globe. and I could rule the world with my eyes closed. (with my eyes closed..). Chorus: Krayzie Bone.

Don't talk about death, I got too much life to live. Too many orders to give -- what it is, showbiz. Taught you what a trick and a hoe is (WHAT?). Showed you what a Six-ty Fo' is (WHAT?). Lord knows, ""In God We Trust"". and everybody in the world wanna be like us (everybody). Chorus. [Ice Cube]. To the kids of the world that's waitin for wealth. Waitin for health, you better do for self. Homey that's yo' last cup. Forget about the fast buck; boy, get you ass up. People use yo' brain to gain. Do something that ain't never been done; and we can spend hun's. Wipe our ass with twenties, light our joints with ones. Throw away the guns, have nuttin but fun. And homey we could do that {shit}!. Police have a fit, when yo' paper's legit. We gotta get off the phone, we gotta teach our own. Send your baby to school and she'll come back grown. We got to talk to our grandma's. And she'll help us throught them dark halls, and them pitfalls. Everybody know we got the world to gain. We got to stop the pain, lord stop the rain. Chorus. [Ice Cube].

urbanian,"[Intro]. Google me bitch. I told her, won'tcha Google me bitch. Ha ha, ah won'tcha. Ah won'tcha Google me bitch, yeah. I told her, won'tcha Google me bitch. Try to Google me bitch, listen. [Chorus 1]. I ain't ghetto, don't you know, I'm urbanian. Fuck with the kid, and I'll turn, into Damian. Google me bitch, wanna know, what my name is. Don't even ask, stupid ass, am I famous. [Ice Cube]. (Are you famous?) My resume is heaven's way. of tellin y'all that God will make a way. I rock a motherfuckin mic 'til the break of day. Darrell Dawkins flow, y'all need to make a breakaway. Microphone fiend with that guillotine killer team. You motherfuckers won't amount to a hill of beans. When I ride by, well over 35. Y'all still run and hide, scared of a driveby. [Chorus 2]. I ain't ghetto, don't you know, I'm urbanian. Google me bitch, wanna know, what my name is. I ain't ghetto, don't you know, I'm urbanian. Google me bitch, wanna know, if I'm famous. Google me bitch, ah won'tcha. Ah won'tcha Google me bitch, ah won'tcha. Ah won'tcha Google me bitch, I told her. Won'tcha Google me bitch, try to Google me this. [Ice Cube]. I'm urban, and ordained. Your little ass is kind of churban, and propane. Your little flame is like a flicker. And my bang, is off the motherfuckin Richter. I'm hard liquor. Cirrohsis of the liver. Black lung is what I deliver. That's what you get, if you ever try to smoke the nigga. Don't provoke a nigga, I'm from that urban community. Lookin for some unity, fuckin you and me. I only bang shit true to me. With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me?. Nothin, I only bang shit true to me. With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me?. [Chorus 2]"
us,"Verse One:. Could you tell me who released our animal instinct?. Got the white man sittin' there tickled pink.. Laughin' at us on the avenue. Bustin' caps at each other after havin' brew. We can't enjoy ourselves. Too busy jealous... Of each other's wealth. Commin' up is just in me. But the Black community is full of envy. Too much back-stabbin'. While I look up the street I see all the japs grabbin'. Every vacant lot in my neighborhood. Build a store, and sell their goods. To the county of sips (?). You know us po niggas: nappy hair and big lips?. Four or five babies on your crotch. And you expect Uncle Sam to help us out?. We ain't nothin' but porchmonkeys. To the average bigot, redneck honky. You say comin' up is a must. But before we can come up, take a look at US. Verse Two:. And all y'all dope-dealers.... Your as bad as the po-lice- cause ya kill us. You got rich when you started slangin' dope. But you ain't built us a supermarket. So when can spend our money with the blacks. Too busy buyin' gold an' Caddilacs. That's what ya doin' with the money that ya raisin'. Exploitin' us like the Caucasians did. For 400 years - I got 400 tears- for 400 peers. Died last year from gang-related crimes. That's why I got gang-related rhymes. But when I do a show ta kick some facts. Us Blacks don't know how ta act. Sometimes I believe the hype, man. We're messin' up ourselves and blame the white man. But don't point the finger you jiggaboo. Take a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you. Pretty soon hip-hop won't be so nice. No Ice Cube, just Vannilla Ice. And yall sit and scream and cus. But there's no one ta blame- but US. . Verse Three:. US ... will always sing the blues. 'Cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes. But if ya step on mine ya pushed a button. ""Cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin'. Just like a beast. But I'm the first nigga ta holler out {PEACE, BLACK MAN}. I beat my wife and children to a pulp. When I get drunk and smoke dope. Got a bad heart condition. Still eat hog-mogs an' chitlin's. Bet my money on the dice and the horses. Jobless, so I'm a hope for the armed forces. Go to church but they tease us. Wit' a picture of a blue-eyed Jesus. They used to call me Negro. After all this time I'm still bustin up the chiffarobe. No respect and didn't know it. And I'm havin' more babies than I really can afford. In jail 'cause I can't pay the mother. Held back in life because of my color. Now this is just a little summary. Of US, but yall think it's dumb of me. To put a mirror to ya face, but trust."

To all my niggas in the pen, get your yoke on. To all my thugs in the house, get your loc on. We can really give a fuck about a broke home. All we care about is bitches we can poke on. Nigga, what's that bullshit that you spoke on?. Better roll on 'fore we split your whole dome. Cause you're fuckin with Ice Cube the Terrible. Fuck around, I make your life unbearable. Make you live all scary and careful. Come through my neighborhood, you better tip-toe. Cause if you loud, then you might get chased down. Westside Connection catch a case now.

Better lay low, cause you fuckin with a halo. Death to the niggas with the big mouth. And death to you devils from the Old South. And death to you hoes turnin tricks out. And death everyone that go the bitch route. Check it. If you infected by this record. Bow down butt-naked. And pray to God. Ice Cube won't spare the rod. Westside Connection here to mob, nigga, rob. We can take it to the streets. We can take it to the concrete. You niggas know where the Don be. You bitches ain't tryin to find me. All you haters need to shut the fuck up and get behind me.

we had to tear this muthafucka up,"Intro: (*numerous men speaking*). (Peace, quiet and good order will be maintained in our city to the best of. our ability. Riots, melees and disturbances of the peace are against the. interests of all our people and therefore cannot be permitted). (The jury found that they were all not guilty, not guilty....). (We've been told that all along Crenshaw Boulevard that there's a series of. fires. A lot of looting is going on. A disaster area obviously). (The jury found that they were all not guilty, not guilty...). Make it rough. (A lot of activity continues here in this....) Make it rough. (We have sporadic fires throughout the city of Los Angeles). Verse 1:. Not guilty the filthy devils tried ta kill me. When the news get to the hood then niggas will be. hotter than cayenne pepper, cuss, bust. Kickin up dust is a must. I can't trust a cracker in a blue uniform. Stick a nigga like a unicorn. Vaugn, wicked, Lawrence Powell, foul. Cut his fuckin throat and I smile. Go to Simi Valley and surely. somebody knows the address of the jury. Pay a little visit, ""Who is it?"" (Who is Ice Cube?). ""Can I talk to the grand wizard?"" then boom. Make him eat the barrel, modern day feral. Now he's zipped up like leather tuscadero. Pretty soon we'll catch Sergeant Coon. Shoot him in the face, run up in him witta broom. Stick prick, devils ain't shit. Introduce his ass to the AK40 dick. Two dazed niggas layin in the cut. To get some respect we had to tear this muthafucka up. Make it rough. Verse 2:. I gotta Mac10 for Officer Wynd. Damn, his devil ass need to be shipped back to Kansas. in a casket, crew cut faggot. Now he ain't nothin but food for the maggots. Lunch, punch, Hawaiin lyin. Niggas ain't buyin. ya story bore me. Taerin up shit with fire, shooters, looters. Now I got a lap-top computer. I told you all what happened and you heard it, read it. but all you could call me was anti-Semitic. Regret it-nope, said it-yep. Listen to my big black boots as I step. Niggas had to break you off somethin, give Bush a push. But your National Guard ain't hard. You had to get Rodney to stop me cos you know what?. We woulda teared this muthafucka up. Huh, make it rough!. Huh Muggs, make it rough!. Verse 3:. It's on, gone with the wind and I know white men can't dunk. Now I'm stealin blunts. And it came from Betty Crocker, overweight and blacker. Don't fuck with the black-owned stores but hit the Foot Lockers. Steal, muthafuck Fire Marshall Bill. Oh what the hell, throw the cocktail. I smelt smoke, got the fuck out, Ice Cube lucked out. My nigga had his truck out, didn't get stuck out. In front of that store with the Nikes and Adidas. Oh Jesus, I ???? Surplus got the heaters. Meet us so we can get the 9's and the what-nots. Got the Mossberg with the double eyed buckshot. Ready for Darryl and like Beretta wouldn't say. Keep your eye on the barrel, a sparrow. Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. But I'm rollin so that's a fucked up slogan. The Hogan's Heroes spotted the gorilla by the Sizzler. Hittin up police killer. The super duper nigga that'll buck. We had to tear this muthafucka up so what the fuck!?!. Huh, make it rough!. Yo Muggs, make it rough. Huh, make it rough. Enough. Outro: (*newsreader*). (Not Guilty verdicts for Stacey Coon, Lawrence Powell, Timothy Wynd and. Theodore Vaugsinio, the four officers accused of beating motorist Rodney. King)."

Back to set the record straight for all these busta ass niggaz. who trip, this how we do it nigga. [Chorus: WC]. Front back side to side. We be givin it up, till the day we die. Niggaz hit me up, I'ma have ta erupt. So motherfucker West Up!. [x2]. [Verse One: WC]. Nigga clear the lane, here I come, once again. With this, gangsta click, droppin this, gangsta shit. Strictly for the riders who ride us I gotta WestSider. rhymer for them niggaz that's sittin on them Dayton wires. Pump the bass, hit the switch. Cause Ice Cube, Mack 10, and Dub-C, back up in this b-i-itch. Straight hoodsta for life, ain't no lookin back. Ink in my flesh, WestSide tattered on my chest. Walkin with the shadow of death. Through the land of the skanless, South Central Los Angeles. Home of the Crips and the Bloods. Where even the strongest niggaz is drug through the mud. And visitors from outta town best to stay in Hollywood. You get that tourist ass ganked strollin through my hood. West coast till the casket drop. I be throwin it up, so motherfucker West Up!. [Verse Two: Mack 10]. It's gun ho Mack one-oh please you can't fuck wit deez. Ice Cubez and Dub-Ceez is my G'z. And hip-hop, top three niggaz the new bosses. Never slippin cause we flosses, packin Nina Rosses. Nigga, thought you knew how we do it. Ain't a Damn Thing Changed, always on them thangs. forever and a day, so back up, gimme room, don't neglect. Just respect and everything I can't check I wreck. Now you can cross out the bustas and snitches. Shit only killers hootchie bitches and hot hydraulic switches allowed. On the turf where the real hogs dwell. Sewed up the hood, the fattest bolas on the block for sale. Inglewood City, the throne I call home. Niggaz be so bright, you might need your locs on. to bail through, it's fin you're in with Mack 10. And I gotta confess up, nigga this West Up! for life. [Chorus]. [Verse Three: Ice Cube]. Now I got ta show you how the West coast rocks. No razor blades, in my mouth, just a glock. And I'm hittin you up, with that W-S. The sun, rises in the East, but it sets in the West. No gold teeth, you gets a wreath. So hand me the goodies, stockin mask, no hoodies. Christmas day, I'm in a tre. While some of you niggaz got the robe reindeer and a sleigh. We don't call it five-oh, we call it one time. It's my life my life my life my life, in the sunshine!. One nine weighs a ton. How the fuck you think that the West was won?. Now shit can be squashed over a forty ounce of backwash. No jokes, the land of locs and hundred spokes. In the East, we can be brothers. But when you come to L.A., watch your motherfuckin colors. West Up! nigga. [Chorus]. [Verse Four: WC]. Give it up, give it up. Like the nigga James Brown, me and my niggaz are puttin it down. So bustas be wary cause see we represent the city. Where niggaz caught slippin is left with they brains drippin. City of the Angels, more like a concrete jungle. full of macks Cadillacs and crack sacks. I pledge allegiance to the shit till I die. [Mack 10] So let the five-twenty slide and put it down from the WestSide. [Chorus]. WestSide!!!. (""Throwin up the W"")"

Too big for my britches, and I got bitches. Now I'm hittin' switches, niggas want my riches. Used to get 18 when my G was alive, now a key is 13-5. '89s the number, another summer. Police ain't get no dumber. Streets dried up, used to think it would last. But being a king-pin is a thing of the past. They tried to blast me for selling a boulder. Now I got my ass in Minnesota. Got my own crew, it's on brand new. Damn, what can I do?. Today.... Verse Two:. Already done stack me half a mill ticket. Bought a house next to Prince, so now I can kick it. Now I got ends, wavin' to my friends, rollin' in my Benz. Goin' to see the Twins, play at the dome. Police are tappin' my mobile phone. I'm almost home.

what is a pyroclastic flow?,[Keith David]. What's the definition of a pyroclastic flow?. That's what happens when a volcano blow. That's what happens when Ice Cube starts to flow. Red hot lava mixed with salava. Pulvarising everything in it's wake. Nothing can survive a pyroclastic flow. And noone will survive this one
what they hittin' foe?,"Fucking around in a crap game. Niggas think I'm soft cause now I'm in the rap game. And I don't hang out as much. Bang out dope cuts. Standing on stage and I'm grabbing my nuts. But when it comes to getting in a circle. I'm hitting sevens turning broke niggas purple. Looking for Little Joe and the dumb nigga scream and choke. When deuce-deuce hit the floor yo. Now which of ya wanna fade the twenty?. I'm turnin your fat pockets skinny. Ah yeah I'm shaking the ivory. And boom it's like they die for me. Fool you can get loud, get mad, hit the joint. But don't forget my point. There it is yo. I put my Nike on the bet so it won't slide. Money gone cause I'm never hitting deuce-five. I'm never hitting four-trey no way. You wanna leave but come on hoe stay. Nigga see but that'll work. Poppa needs brand-new shoes and a sweatshirt. Fool you can't even fuck with that. And now that I'm winning I gots to get my gat. Cause I see your homies starting to look. And broke motherfuckers they make the best crooks. And I'm feeling like a baller. Bucking fools now the circles getting smaller. Now you wanna go and scheme. Punk niggas like you just love to triple-team. So I pick up my money and start walking. Cause now I let the gat start talking. Now since ya'll lost you wanna go out like a sucker."

Deal wit' the devil wit' my mother fucking steel - BOOM!. Media try to do me. But I was a Boy-N-the-Hood before the movie, yeah. Call me nigga, bigger than a spook. But you the one that voted for Duke, motherfucker. White man is something I tried to study. But I got my hands bloody, yeah.. They say I can sing like a Jaybird. But nigga don't say the J-word.. I thought they was bugging. .. Cuz to us Uncle Sam is Hitler without an oven. Burning our black skin. Buy my neighborhood - then push the crack in. Doing us wrong from the first day. And don't understand why a nigga got an AK.. Calling me an African-American. like everything is fair again, shit. Devil you got to get the shit right I'm black. Blacker than a trillion midnights. ""Don't believe the Hype"" was said in 88 by the great Chuck D. Now they're trying to fuck me . .. {wit' no vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline}. Its a great day for genocide.

Bust a single, here's my new jingle. The KKK has got three-piece suits. Using niggas like turkey shoots. My motto is ""treat 'em like a prostitute."". If I say no violence devil, you won't respect mine,. Fuck the dumb shit and get my Tek-9.. And if they approach us. A-ight, a-ight - I bury those cockroaches.. And if you can't deal wit' my ""Kill at Will"". Here's a new gift to get. Try my ""Death Certificate"".. Amerikkka's Most, Amerikkka's burnt - its like toast. Like Jordan I'm going coast to coast.. Dribbling the funk. Here comes the nigga wit' the mother fucking monster dunk. Get off me punk. {You better eat your Wheaties}. Darryl Gates got the studio surrounded. Cuz he don't like the niggas that I'm down wit'. Mother fucker wanna do us. Cuz I like Nat, Huey, Malcolm, and Louis.. Most got done by a black man's bullet. Give a trigga to a nigga and watch him pull it.. Negro assassin,. I'ma dig a ditch, bitch, and throw your ass in. When they shoot, no, it won't be a cracker. They use somebody much blacker. What I do?. I call up the Geto Boy crew. Cuz my mind's playing tricks on me too.. Never die, surround my crib. ____________ makin' sure nobody creep when I sleep. Keep a 9 millimeter in my Jeep - PEEP!. When I roll, I gots to roll deep.. Ain't going out cheap. Make the Mad Circle on Cypress Hill cuz its so steep.. They'll never get me. They'll never hit me.

Brothers gonna have to put themself in check. Three strikes you in the penzo, checked to your neck. Your woman cries, your baby grows up alone. Talkin through a three inch glass on a two way phone.

You need to march with the Nation on Atonement Day, represent. [Chuck D]. Now, to all my brothers we be rhymin like this. Yeah I can handle, but they can't kill it mill or dismantle it.

Brothers walk around dumb different and blind. Pregnant Earths always carry eggs. I pledge to never fall off the ledge. and blacks remain family like Sister Sledge. [Shorty]. God prepared the table for us, in the presence of our enemy. Now we soon to be, one in unity. One two three I'm a G. But the God inside is that G I chose to be.

Thinking he can get any bitch with a good rap?. Rolling in a fucked-up Lincoln. Leaning to the side So it looks like he's sinking. Into that leopard interior. This nigga thinks every girl's inferior. To his tongue, get a dumb bitch sprung. As she's selling more butt. Don't even get a cut of the money. His name is Sonny. And he know the play. And hope to od that he don't find a runaway.

And almost get his ass hit for the crack. Now ask yourself. Who's the mack?. Who's the Mack?. Is it that nigga in that club asking. Have you ever been in a hot tub?.

For a girl like you and make it feel good. You know it's drama but it sound real good. He started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging. The pussy so he can keep bragging. He say, ""I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me?"". The pussy so he can keep bragging. You wanna do it but you feeling like a H-O-E. You grab his hand, you leave and it's over.

why me? (feat. musiq soulchild),"[Ice Cube]. Why the fuck you wanna murrr-dah me?. Your punk ass never heard of me. I never did nuttin to your family. Still you wanna kill a young nigga randomly. You wanna take the life God handed to me. Send it back to him cause you ain't a fan of me. Scary bitch with a gun that ain't a man to me. That's a animal, a fuckin cannibal. I'm Geronimo and Hannibal, with international. gangster pull, I'm a bull in Barcelona. with a Corona, youse a fake-ass nigga. Where's your owner? I'm a real live man. You a persona, now I'm a goner. Call my momma, and the coroner. Mr. Gun Man, your plan is workin. Cause niggaz is dyin, and mommas is hurtin. [Chorus - sung]. Why you wanna murder me? You never ever heard of me. You don't know who I am, I could be part of your family tree. Now - sent by G-O-D, to save the world, you & me. You never know who you facin, who you chasin, the life you wastin. [Ice Cube]. I was made by the one and only G-O-D. To take my life, to the T-O-P. Now here comes a motherfuckin D-O-G. who ain't happy 'til a nigga is R.I.P.. Tryin to be somethin he saw on BET. Either T.I.P., or B.I.G.. I don't give a fuck what you saw on TV. but a one-eight-seven don't make an O.G.. I'm an O.G., never had to fake it. God gave me this, how you gon' take it?. What'chu gon' tell 'em, when you get to heaven. and he asks you why did you send back his present?. Who the fuck are you~? You motherfuckin peasant!. Even got the nerve to ask the man for a blessing. Send his ass to Hades with his big Mercedes. Nigga hell on earth is bein stuck in the 80's. [Chorus]. [Ice Cube]. Before you shoot me man think about it. Let's go have a drink about it. Before you make a stink about it. Man let's talk about it maybe we can walk up out it. But just don't be a coward. And take my life, cause you got the power. of the white man's gunpowder. Cause you might face a gun tower. And time never run out. They take the fun out, 'til your life run out. So don't pull the gun out. If you ever want a house just like Run's house. It's better than the big house. Let's go find some women we can dig out. Find a place we can pig out. Party all night 'til the owner say get out. [Chorus]. [Ice Cube]. Dedicated to all the niggaz. That's dead and don't know why. Who wanna look at the nigga who shot 'em. And ask these questions. Why me homie, why me?"
why we thugs,"[Intro]. Yeah. Every hood's the same [2X]. Come on. [Chorus]. They give us guns and drugs. Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs. They wanna count the slugs. Then come around here and fuck with us (Uh huh). They give us guns and drugs. Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs. They wanna count the slugs. Then come around here and fuck with us. [Verse 1]. I'm from the land of the gang bang. Since I was little, ain't a god damn thang changed. It's the same ol same. Bush run shit like Sadaam Hussien. I cock and aim, clinically insane. To deal with this bullshit day to day. If I sell some yay or smoke some hay. You bitches wanna throw me up in pelican's bay. Call me an animal up in the system. But who's the animal that built this prison. Who's the animal that invented lower living. The projects, thank god for Russell Simmons. Thank god for Sugarhill. I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill. Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids. How these ghetto niggaz taken over showbiz. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. It's boyz in the hood, it's toys in the hood. Y'all wanna know why there's noise in the hood. Cause there's drugs in the hood, thugs in the hood. Nigga killed a crip and a blood in the hood (For real). Cause when niggaz get tribal. It's all about survival, nobody liable. I got caught by five-oh. Grandmama came to court with her bible. But when the judge hit the gavel. Now I'm too far from my family to travel (Fuck). I just came unraveled. Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled. Owned by C.A, State Property. Just like the year fifteen fifty three. Looking for me, a one-way ticket out. Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. (Damn) I can't take the pressure. Pulled the fo-fo up out the dresser. Grabbed the weight up out the closet. Po-po coming but I'm scared to toss it. Y'all know what happened last time I lost it. Can't tell you niggaz what the fuckin boss did. The game got a nigga exhausted. Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered. Twenty years for what?. Breaking these laws that's so corrupt. Taking these halls and fillin 'em up. Some powder cake shit that's about to erupt. Ay y'all, I'm about to be stuck. Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?. In the hood, don't press your luck. Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up. [Chorus]. [Outro]. Every hood's the same [3X]. Every hood's the same [2X]. Stop trippin on it. Every hood's the same [3X]. Every hood's the same [2X]"

you can't fade me,"Now the taste of alcohol is filling up my bladder. What's the date and time it don't matter. Had a pocket full of phone numbers. I was trying to sort. To make a long story short. Ran into this girl named Carla. Knew her from the back seat of my homie's Impala. She said what's up yeah what's the deal. Check the hairdo of course it ain't real. Then I looked down she was fat in the front. I asked how long, well about seven months. Oh how time flies when you're having fun. She said yeah but the damage is done. Where you been, on a little vacation. Oh by the way congratulations. Who's the lucky man? I don't have a clue. Then she said the lucky man is you. I dropped my brew. And everything looked fuzzy. Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy. She said yeah remember that date. I thought back and tried to calculate. Then I said damn are you sure it's mine. Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times. She said that day no I wasn't whoring. Your ass is mine that's when the sweat started pouring. Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court. Paying a gang on child support. Then I thought deep about giving up the money. What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy. Naw cause then I'd really get faded. That's murder one cause it was premeditated. So what I'm a do. I don't have a clue. How many months left damn only two. I'm gettin faded. No cigar, G. Ay yo homey man I'm getting faded. It's crazy cause before I could sleep with her. I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her. See the booty and the front was all in place. But the girl had the pitbull face. So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid. Oh lord god forbid. My homies see me at the motel. Cause those fools would love to just go tell. Everybody in the hood that knows your rep. So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept. And hold your big fat butt steady. Cause yo hoe I got the paper bag ready. She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey. I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque. I dropped her off man and I'm knowing. That I'm a hate myself in the morning. I got drunk to help me forget. Yo another day another hit shit. I'm gettin faded. Ay yo you know what time it is. Nine months later she's ready to drop the load. And everybody in the hood already knows. It's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me. You know Ice Cube can't be having that G. I'm thinking to myself why did I bang her. Now I'm in the closet looking for the hanger. JD and Jinx and T-Bone won't let up they won't shut up. I'm gettin fed up bitch. Cause I know you're tryin to break me. But if I find out your tryin to fake me. I'm a buff that duff for a hoot. Beat ya down and leave a crown or two. That night she went into labor. And the shit is getting kinda major. The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver. Looking like my next-door neighbor. She said it was mine that was her best guess. But let's check the results of the blood test. I started smiling yeah cause it read negative. Damn why did I let her live?. After that I should've got the gat. And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap. But no I just told the hoe who laid me. Excuse me bitch it's a switch. You can't fade me. Naw baby not this way. Yo you ain't playing Ice Cube out like no booger. I don't fall for the okey-doke. And before I fall for the okey-doke. I let the pistol smoke. Now sing it. Yeah baby you can't fade me"
