my band,"[Eminem]. I don't know dude. I think everybody's all jealous and shit. 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude. And I think everybody's got a fuckin' problem with me dude. And they need to take it up with me after the show. Because.... Chorus [Eminem]. These chickys. don't even know the name of my band. But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands. 'cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man. All because I'm the lead singer of my band. [Eminem]. So I get off stage right, drop the mic. Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like. ""What's up ladies, my name's Slim Shady. I'm the lead singer in D-12 baby"". They're all like ""Oh my God it's him"". ""Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem"". ""I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock"". ""Please won't you please let me suck your cock"". And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous. Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas. All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes. Throw their bras and their shirts and the panties on stage. So like every single night they pick a fight with me. But when we fight it's kinda like siblin' rivalry. 'cause they're back on stage the next night with me. ""Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me"". Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me. 'cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be. This rock star shit, it's the life for me. And all the other guys just despise me because. Chorus. My band (9x). [Swifty]. You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you?. Hey dad how come we don't rap on proto. Smash these vocals and do a performance. But we in the van and he in a tour bus. You don't want my autograph, you's a liar. And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva). And what the hell is wrong with that dressing room. 'cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal. See I know how to rap, it's simple but. all I did was read a Russell Simmons book. So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map. Doin' jumpin' jacks while get whipped on my back. [Kuniva] Look him little punk ass thinkin' he the shit. [Kon Artis] Yeah I know man find himself takin' on a flick. [Kuniva] Hey I thought we had an interview with Dj Clue. [Eminem] No! I had an interview, not you two. [Kuniva] You gonna be late for soundcheck. [Kon Artis] Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck. [Kuniva] But our mics are screwed up. [Kon Artis] And his always sound best. You know what man I'ma say somethin'. [Kuniva] Aiyo Em (You got somethin' to say?!). [Kon Artis] Man no. [Kuniva] I thought you 'bout to tell him off, man what's up. [Kon Artis] Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up. And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew. [Kuniva] Man I was 'bout to talk right after you I swear, I. swear man. Chorus. [Proof]. They say the lead singer's rock, but the group is not. Once we sold out arenas to the amusement parks. I'ma go let the world know that Proof is hot. I should cut his mic off when the music starts. Ready to snap on a dumbass fan. Every time I hear... (Hey dude I love your band!). We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments. So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent. And these guys they can find every area code (Proof carry my. bag). Bitch carry your own. Can't make it to the stage, security in my way. (Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!). [Bizarre]. God damn it I'm sick of this group. Time for me to go solo and make some loop. I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps. Till Kon Artis, slipped me some crack. Lose Yourself video, I was in the back. Superman video, I was in the back. Fuck the media, I got some suggestions. Fuck Marshall, ask us a question. Like who's D-12, how we get started (But what about Eminem?). Bitch, are you retarded?. Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group. Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (Hey sexy). Then he told me to do sit-ups to get buff. I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up. Fuck D-12, I'm outta this band. I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne. [Eminem]. Girl why can't you see you're the only one for me. and it just tares my ass apart to know that you don't know my. name. [Bizarre]. These chicks don't even know the name of my band (haha). But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck. Marshall). 'cause once I blow I know that I'll be the man (yeah). All because I'm the lead singer.... [Eminem] My band (9x). [Bizarre] (In background). The hottest boy band in the world. D12!. [Eminem] (as a salsa singer). I'm the lead singer of my band. I get all the girl's to take off their underpants. And the lead singer of my band, my salsa. Makes all the pretty girl's want to dance. My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called ""My Salsa"". My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa. My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance. And take off their underpants. My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance. And take off their underpants, my salsa. Where'd everybody go?"
these drugs,"[Chorus 1]. It's (it's) be (be) cause (cause) of (of). these drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do. Be.. cause.. of... these drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do. [Eminem - speaking over Chorus 1]. It was like.. whoahh and then the fuckin room started spinnin and shit. And my friend came in he was like, ""Yo! Yo! Em! Em!. You puttin that shit up your nose again?"". And I was like, ""Naw"" nuttin like - everything was just spinnin. I couldn't even see and like, he started to look like a monster n shit. Then I just started laughin and threw up all over the fuckin floor. It's crazy. [Chorus 2 - over last two lines of Chorus 1]. It's because, of these drugs, that I do, that make me. do these things, that I do, do these things, that I do. [Eminem]. My music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it. It's like, Lucifer's here to influence listeners through it. You probably do what it said to do just from listenin to it. It's got the power to get you to do it (c'mon). So when the shit comes on, I wanna see some shit jump off. Some bitch get slapped, some motherfuckin kid get stomped. So get this song, go run out and buy this disc. And try this shit, as much coke as I just did. Cause times like these, got me doin lines like these. Plus I grab a pencil every time that I light weed. It's probably because of the drugs Shady does what he does. and is what he is, I'm dizzy Bizzy visit these kids. [Bizarre]. Hey Stephanie (hi!) Let's take some ecstasy (okay!). Now pull your pants down bitch and have sex with this dog next to me. (huh?) 'Til I'm dead I'm takin blunts to the head. Needles in my broken leg, listen to Grateful Dead. These mescalines got me sure. that I can fuck any whore with genital warts on the Warped Tour. Who slipped this downer in my Snapple?. Cussin out Interscope (Bizarre, you're signed to Capitol!). Fuck it, I was born with half a brain. Sniffin 'caine, at celebrity basketball games. You motherfuckers think I'm a gimmick. cause I got a Cash Money tattoo and roll with No Limit (UNNNNGGGHHH!). The last time I sniffed blow. I ended up in Denver, Colorado at an Iggy Pop show. Bizarre be smokin a half a pound. Fuckin the engineer's wife, while he's mixin my song down. [Chorus 1]. [Eminem - speaking over Chorus 1]. It's like, back when I first went on tour. I like, went crazy I was like out of control. And - just was fuckin wasted every night, like. wakin up the next morning like - where the... Where the fuck am I at, what the fuck is goin on. you see what I'm sayin? I was just like, out of control. [Chorus 2 - over last two lines of Chorus 1]. [Swifty McVay]. These Benadryls got me stiffer than a mannequin. Eight years old swallowin Anacins, standin over my bannister. Laughin with a chromed out caliber (hahahahaha). The weed that I'm sellin this (?) look like the back of a tarantula. I keep a substantial amount of aspirins in my Acura. Smashin it, after framin a nigga with smack and dust. I'm scandalous, drugs been ran for months. Crackin capsules to expand our blunts. I rolled it up and take the pressure to the head. Now I'm lookin like a extra on ""Night of the Living Dead"". until they find me on a stretcher. I'm quick to sample anything, bitch you got a tester?. This crank'll have me blowin up banks like Uncle Fester. [Proof]. Ahhhh.. watch tonight, you'll admit that I'm a fiend. Pop beans, 'scalines, along with amphetamines. Ghetto kings, meddling with the smell of greens. Got a Jell-o spleen, and see yellow rings (ohhhhhh). Blue pills, and purple mushrooms. (Hey little girl, you got a curfew, don't you?). Missin since yesterday, perfect just for rape. See I'm on judgment day, numb from special K. Two tabs of X and vitamin C. Swallow Hennessey along with Tylenol 3. Grindin the teeth at the signs of the E. I lost six days at a time in the week. The crime in the street hold your parents for ransom. while D-12 gang rape Marilyn Manson. In twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic. Barf up my stomach linin, drown in my vomit. [Chorus 1] - 2.5X. [Eminem - speaking over Chorus 1]. Cause I like, I always tell people - yknowhatI'msayin like. If you got an addiction, don't admit, to nobody, yknowhatI'msayin?. Keep that shit to yourself; because if anybody sees that, yknahmsayin. when you're out in the public eye and shit. they're always gonna think that you're on that shit even if you're not. That's why I always tell my friends, knowhatI'msayin but. I mean, like for me, I don't give a fuck. I'll probably end up, dyin from this shit one day. Probably pick up a newspaper in the morning and it's like. ""Eminem dies from, drug overdose"" - youknowhatI'msayin? And. And my friends, they ain't no fuckin better, yknowhatI'msayin?. They ain't nothin but influences, bad influences to me, y'know. It's peer pressure, shit is like all peer pressure. That's what it boils down to - and, I give in to it. So do they... [Chorus 2 - over last two lines of Chorus 1] - 2x."
good die young,"Good Die Young. [Intro- Kon Artis] Dawg, I shouldn't have left. They wouldn't have tried this shit if I was wit' ya. Maybe we would have picked another time, or maybe chose anotha way. Or maybe my prayers would have convinced him that choose another soul. Shit, it’s just me and my man Tony now. Man you look so peaceful right now...how can I argue with that. They say.... [Kon Artis - Chorus] They say that the good die young, that’s why I think that you should have fun (when your young). Cause time won't wait for no one, when God calls, you gotta go home. They say the good die young, (die young), that's why I know that we gon' have fun. In this life cause you only get one. When God calls for me, don't cry I just went home.. [Kon Artis] It's true that everybody heard, there mama say everyday's like this, when you see, one of your friends die in the mist. In the struggle, until the circumstances it's a risk that they take, just to prove a point to a friend. Even then, accidents are prone to happen to any man, or woman that's dumb enough to pretend. That her, God won't hold them accountable for sins. If they commit, and they try to repent themselves to repent. But I guess that’s just the way things go,. I was blessed to see 24. To wake up to that how ""My Name Is"" video, motivated me to write what I wrote. And I knew my little brother sold dope, and mom and daddy want to move off Ro'. I did it, I still got a lot to prove and show, I just wish we ain’t have to lose Bugz to the struggle Cause you know.... [Chorus]. [Bizarre] I know you used to Bizarre on some silly shit, but niggas in my clique is dying quick.. In Detroit, niggas don't party, they pull a fo-fo out, snatch off bacardis. That’s why I keep the pistol under the trunk, I'm 27 years old, too old to be gettin' jumped. And fuck rap, I miss Carnell Pitts, B-U-G-Z, tattered on my wrist. Me and you in the Jeep, listen to swing ol' beats, it's a shame me and Fuzz don't even speak. I got married, my wife name is Dee, peace to 31 and 51-50, I miss you.. [Kuniva] I remember back on that tragic day, my phone rung, and Bizarre's voice tellin' me, Bugz was gone home. It was like a knife piercing my chest and I couldn't breath, I didn't wanna accept it, didn't wanna believe it. And I swear with this weight dawg, I cried so hard literally, Denaun had to carry me to the car. While I stand in this booth now it’s tearin' me apart but I had to let it out cause it was tearin' at my heart. Cause he died over somethin so petty and so small, a human life is so very precious. I hope ya'll understand how I'm feelin' cause I love you Bugz. I wanna rhyme wit' you, laugh wit' you, hug you Bugz. But I can't and you was so close to seein' dreams,. a coward came along and took you away from the team. So don't mistake this track, it's just another song. This goes out to everyone who lost a loved one cause you know. .. [Chorus]. [Proof] They say it's never too late to have an early childhood, if I could turn back the hands of time, God should. Forgive what I did as a kid to run blocks, now my dreams are just screams, cops, and gun shots. The fun stops when your homie's up in a box, my dude E-Bole, rest his soul, snuffed by the cops. I use to quartion'(?) a lot, if there's a guy by me say somethin'. If you love her so much why didn't you gave nothin'? When he took my homie, Snook was only in 11th grade, now I hope to see your face at the heaven gates. It ain't never late in the game, this hatin' remains, with a grudge to see slugs break through my frame. My heart aches with the pain, the life in his breath, we gotta have fun now, there’s only minutes left. In the depth, distress young as a? Did to get? Off my fallen homies who ain't got enough years. I miss y'all.. [Chorus]. [Swifty] When I was younger I knew four brothers that wasn't wise. That crash and the driver died, my partner on the passenger side was paralyzed. And I'm surprised by the look of that ride that the other peeps survived. Nine months later another one died, somebody shot him in the side when he was startin' up his ride. 3 years go by, I made a hell of a run, and that’s when Funky got done, Joey playin' wit' guns, and Tookie over funds, Carty was my man, and Reggie, I wish that I was wit you in that van. And Bugz if it wasn't for you, you know I wouldn't be standin' in this booth. That’s the truth, I miss ya'll.... [Chorus x2]"
purple hills,"(versão de ""Purple Pills"" para rádio e para o clip). . [Eminem]. Ugh.. yo yo yo, yo. [Chorus: Eminem]. I've been so many places, I've seen so many faces. But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple hills. I've climbed the highest mountain, once or twice but who's countin. But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple hills. [Eminem]. Yo, yo. Cool, calm, just like my mom. With a couple of lawsuits inside her palm. It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve. To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves. I can't describe the vibe I get. When I drive by six people and five I hit (oops). Aww [shit], I started a mosh pit. Squashed a chick and lost her foster kids (ahh!). This room make me hallucinate. Then I sweat 'til I start losin weight. 'Til I see dumb [shit] start happenin. Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again. So bounce, bounce, come on bounce. {*GUNFIRE*} I said come on, bounce (ahh!). Everybody in the house doin mass amounts (me!). To the women in the thongs with they asses out (oh). We don't bull[shit], better ask around. D-12 throws the bombest bash in town. Bizarre, your mom is crashin out. Help me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out. Come on!. [Kon Artis and Kuniva]. [Fuck] that, someone help Denaun. He's upstairs wrestlin Elton John. Heh, hey Von you see me steppin on these leprechauns?. It gotta be Tums, the Exlaxe is gone. Ya I took them all dawg with some parmesan. And I think my arm is gone. Naw it's probably numb. Young, dumb, and full of [cum]. And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue. Scary ass it was a false alarm. You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?. Yo stop actin stupid. You so high that you might wake up with a guy on some new [shit] (eww!). Yeah I think I did too much (uh-huh). I think I got the runs (uh-huh). Rolaids, Pepto and Tums -- watch out, here it comes! {*laughter*}. [Chorus]. [Eminem]. Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us. That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other. They probably wanna take each other out and date each other. Some-, somethin, some'un, some'un, some'un {*babbling*}. [Proof]. Hop hills, hills I hop. Hop two hills on stilts I walk. Snort two lines that were filled with chalk. Thought it was +Incredible+ and killed the +Hulk+. I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade. Until my eyes fall back and I'm scared for days. And when I'm, over weight and my golf ball broke. No okey-doke, I'm packin my nose with soap. {*cough cough cough*} Am I supposed to choke?. Had an accident when the Trojan broke. Aww, poor baby, born by [whore] lady. Now I'm payin child support.. (it's your baby!). [Swifty McVay]. I take fo' shots at one time. And I don't need a chaser when I'm swallowin' mine. (Hey, you got any room?) In Bizarre's hatchback?. We can't go far cause our car has flats. Why the hell you people think I rap?. Because my mother taught me how to breach contracts. And if you got cash, then hide it soon. (Swift, chill) I'm just tryin to get bi like you! (eww!). And I don't give a damn if they find me rude (uh-huh). Mean, crude, the hell with you too (uh-huh). I only need three blunts and I'm cool. I just copped some and I'm goin back soon. [Chorus]. [Bizarre]. I'm at a rave lookin at a babe like she want it (hahaha). Gin and tonic demonic, body smell like vomit. Loony, crazy, chunky, sexy, dopey-headed guy. Whip cream, dirty mattresses, wanna try? (c'mon). Blue hills, golden seals, got Bizarre, actin ill. Drugs kill (yeah right) - chick, I'm for real!. Shut your mouth you dirty girl, you know you want me in your world. Ladies please don't fight; Bizarre's here all night!. [Chorus]. [Eminem]. Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us. That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other. They probably wanna take each other out and date each other. Some-, somethin, some'un, some'un, some'un {*babbling*}. ."
fight music,"[Chorus: Eminem]. This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit. Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it. It's just some shit, for these kids, to trash they rooms with. Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit. The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it. You just know - that's the new shit. The type of shit that causes mass confusion. and drastic movement of people actin stupid. [Kon Artist]. I come to every club with intention to do harm. With a prosthetic arm. And smelling like Boone Farm. Hiding under tables as soon as I hear alarms. Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own mom. Kuniving Kon. Artis with a bomb. Strapped to my stomach screamin'. ""Let's get it on!"". A lust that love the drank. Drunk driving a tank. Rolling over a bank. Cops see me and faint. It's drastic. I'm passed my limit of coke. I think I'll up my high by slitting your throat. Push a baby carriage into the street. Till it's minced meat. Your men's been beat. The minute I step foot on your street. This is fight music!. [Bizarre]. You know why my hands are so numb? (No). Cuz my grandmother sucked my dick. And I didn't cum (Oh). Smacked this whore for talking crap (Bitch). So what if she's handicapped (What?). The bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap (haha). I fuckin hate you. I'll take your drawers down and rape you. While Dr. Dre videotapes you (Hell yeah!). Satan done got me on this song. Eatin a hotdog readin the Holy Qu'ran. While I'm on the john. Tired of wearin this yellow thong. Take it back Sisqo. You know where it belongs (thong th-thong thong). Now here's a gun. I'll put it in your palm (baw). Now go over there and blow off Dru Hill's arms. Fuck your love songs. [Chorus]. [Proof]. Just bring who you gon bring on. Who you gon swing on?. I'm King Kong. Guns blow you to king-dom come. Show you machine gun funk. Sixteen M-16's. And one pump (click clack). Snubbing my paw. Shove it in your jaws. Have you runnin out this fuckin club in your drawers. We lovin the brawls, it's nothin to applaud. But fuck it it's all good. The hood is up in The Source. It's fight music. [Swifty]. I'm a nigga that love scuffles. And won't hesitate to sock you again with swollen knuckles. I'm like that. Catch a nigga like bear traps. Blow his head back right in front of the preist. Sayin ""Ya here that?"". I slap your freak. Bump you and won't speak. If you step on my feet. You get drowned in your own drink. I suffocated my shrink just for talkin. Came back and fucked up his pall bearers. And made them drop his coffin. It's fight music!. [Kuniva]. These beads I'm swingin is stingin em. See all these niggaz?. When I step in the club I'm bringin em. And any nigga lookin too hard. We Rodney King'n em. Malice Green to them. And gasoline'n em with premium. Light a cigarette flick it at em or spit it at em. Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him. Blast while you right hookin. Right when your wife's lookin. Fuck fight music bitch. This is losin your life music. [Eminem]. If I could capture the rage. Of today's youth and bottle it. Crush the glass with my bare hands and swallow it. And spit it back in the faces of you racists. And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit. You Liberaces, Versaces and you Nazi's watch me. Cuz you think you got me in this hot seat. You motherfuckers wanna judge me cuz you're not me. You'll never stop me. I'm top speed and you pop me. I came to save these new generations of babies. From parents who failed to raise them cuz they're lazy. So grow to praise me, I'm makin em go crazy. That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me. And you fugazy if you think I'm a admit wrong. I'll cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sicked on. And this song is for any kid who get's picked on. A sick song to retaliate to and it's called. Chorus. THIS IS FIGHT MUSIC!."

girls,"Eminem. Girls (Limp Bizkit Diss). Ayo dog. I got some shit on my motherfucking chest that. I need to get off cuz. If I don't. I'ma fucking explode or something. Now look. This is the story about. Some little fucking girls that I know. It goes like this. It's so easy for me to make enemies anymore it's sickening. People are looking for an excuse to jump on my shit list. Sticking their noses in shit that isn't none of their business. I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions. Now I'm in the position that. I don't wanna be in shit. I never had a beef with you corny son of a bitches. But now this shit is broke and you can't do nothing to fix it. So I'm telling you right now. Motherfucker Limp Bizkit. Now I'ma be real. B-Real was real. He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefing. See he chilled. He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral. I'da never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils. Peoples, whatever your backpacking cyphering name is. Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you say in it. I'da never involved you. But you had to add your two pennies. Now I gotta go grab my shit list and add some new enemies. Hit the studio and I'll admit I had a few in me. Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any. But let it be known. That song was never released, it leaked. I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally. Then I look on the TV. Now look who's mentioning me. That little fucking weasle, DJ Lethal, on MTV. After I gave you props on that song you on national TV. Talking 'bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me. Come on dog, you was supposed to be on that song. Talking 'bout how bad you hate him. Now you all on his thong. What's wrong, you scared, and Fred, you said you was dissing him too. I shoulda knew better than to listen to you. You fucking sissy. Up on stage screaming how people hate you. They don't hate you. They just think you're corny since Christina played you. And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back. That's a sissy act. And don't call me kissing my ass. Cuz I swear to God this ain't just a song. I'm trying to prewarn you. Lethal, when I fucking see you dogg, I'm swinging on you. Motherfuckers must think cuz I'm in trouble with the law. That I won't draw. Up my sentence and double it tomorrow. Y'all are some. Girls (y'all are some God damn girls). Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?). Why do y'all act like fucking sissies. You pussies keep talking shit behind my back. You just some bitches for that. And we all know (we all know, ha). How fucking cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin'). In fucking Bentleys. And pretend to be down. But as soon as someone calls you out. You put your tail between your legs and walk around. Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs. Or be involved in my beefs. I'm a man. I can stand on my feet. So if you don't wanna be in 'em. All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion. And I won't put you in 'em. Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs. Or be involved in my beefs. I'm a man. I can stand on my feet. So if you don't wanna be in 'em. All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion. And I won't put you in 'em. Now see if you diss me and I respond. The beef is on. But if I help you sell one record. And I see you at a show I'll strip you naked. See I was smart. I came back and scooped up my friends. Now I got five dogs that'll die for me like I'll die for them. I'll fight for them, swing or shoot, like I fight for Kim. All of them been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in. That goes for all of my dogs from Royce to Dre. From Xzibit to Melman. Till I'm hoist away. In my coffin. I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested. I never give a fuck. I won't ever be interested. Love me or hate me. As much as Fred wants to be hated. I will solemnly stand by every statement I've stated. The shit that I been through. My pencil never could pencil. But I won't ever be this gullible ever again, no. Next time I'll know when someone's copying off me. I'm not being cocky. I just know when somebody's mocking me. I stick up my middle finger. He sticks up his finger. I say fuck Christina. He says fuck Christina, but meaner. So from doing a song with Method. To begging to get accepted. I'm pegging Fred. With the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with. And as for Lethal don't forget what I said. I'm fucking you up punk. You're dead. Don't think that I'm playing. And fuck Bizkit. Cuz I know you're saying fuck D12. Only not to our face, under your breath, and to yourselves. Little. Girls (motherfucking females). Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?). Why do y'all act like fucking sissies. You pussies keep talking shit behind my back. You just some bitches for that. And we all know (now we all know the truth). How fucking cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin'). In fucking Bentleys. And pretend to be down. But as soon as someone calls you out. You put your tail between your legs and walk around. Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs. Or be involved in my beefs. I'm a man. I can stand on my feet. So if you don't wanna be in 'em. All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion. And I won't put you in 'em. Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs. Or be involved in my beefs. I'm a man. I can stand on my feet. So if you don't wanna be in 'em. All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion. And I won't put you in 'em. And that's it. That's all there is to it dog. If you don't wanna do the fucking song. Don't say you're down with doing the fucking song. And then back out at the last minute. And then go on motherfucking MTV. Talking about Everlast can whip my motherfucking ass. If you're scared of Whitey Ford dog. Just say you're scared of Whitey Ford. That's it. That's all you had to fucking say. I wouldn't a said shit. I woulda backed off. Did the motherfucking song myself. And not put you motherfuckers in it. That's all. Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more. I'm on some fucking you up shit when I see you. And I will see you, too. Oh, and by the way, Fred. That wasn't an accident. I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards. Ha ha."

don't try this at home,"""You Have Agreed, Not To Try This At Home. Anything Else"". [Proof]. Who am I?. I'm a basterd, I stolen off ya and blast at ya. Smokin' more blacks than the part time wars in Africa. I'll ?? out the martyrs for beef. Rest in piece alot of you reef(?) designing your greef. By snatchin' your brother, smackin' your lover. Paralizing your cousins, smokin' your mother's husbands. A dozen chosen showguns to shotguns. Roll up on you with no guns but still pop one. I bomb like napalm from the curb to your house. And ""Please God"" the last words out ya mouth. No affiliates, just dogs and troops. Most lyin' death than this morgue and roots. All we choose to beef, I bring spatulas. Flip it and throw it back at ya, so bring your gat with ya. Spectacular murder manufacturer, fuck binacular. Only heaters talkin, I'm trappin ya just to flattin ya. Hop in the accura, roll up on the back of ya. Chill out in 5, and then them niggaz act alive. I smoke branches from off the tree tops. I hang with real niggaz, PA's, PK's and Pete Rock. Y'all niggaz with pre-ops, spill blood and Reeboks. Don't discriminate blastin rookies on the e-box(?). Your streetforce envolves just for excitement. Like if you wasnt you never heard of enditement. I sum it up quick so that you can understand me. Fuck you, your crew, your bitch and your whole family. [Bizarre]. Bizarre's a villin, bitch I ain't illin. I'll pull your fucking head off while your ass is winddillin'. Go heads the triggers of the penot scott villian(?). Vericons(?) march, atleast shoot a million. Dirty Dozen the first week? at least a billion. If not, it's back to robbing and stealin'. Bizarre's the illest, the shitty is the worst. A thousand dollars for any nigga that can last longer than a verse. And what's the worst is I don't give a damn. Offer Garth Brooks a stolen grand am. Come to your record label, take all your doe. Take your rap name and have your manager booking you shows. I don't gove a fuck if we don't get along. Bitches know my name without the Slim Shady song, bitch... We in this bitch with DJ Butter. Who gives a fuck?. We in this bitch with Wallstreet and we don't give a fuck about nothing. ""You Have Agreed, Not To Try This At Home. Anything Else?"". [Royce Da 5'9]. Yeah yeah... What's my motherfucking name? Royce Nickle Nine. A messiah of all, much higher than y'all, undeniably raw. Quick to blow the fuck up and reform again. The bomb threat re-occured, re-warn your men. I promise you get toared up and re-torn again. Not one slur or word will be re-born again. As long as the shit cracks and they turn a loop up. I spit it until it's pitch black and burn the roof up. Better step the fuck up for the shit getting spit. Turns to whips getting lit, turns to tick-tick-tick. Niggaz be rapping just for the clubs, just for the love. That hit you had in the club sound like shit in the truck. That's why I love that nigga X, cause he raised my brow. With every rhyme, without having to take my style. It'll be a cold day in hell when these two soldiers lay in hell. Talk to me. [Billy Nix]. Billy Nix, I'm really sick of this silly shit. Rappers, get on the mic, swearing they're really spit. But you really fake, tough guy stop at your thirty-eight. Drop your gloves and get taped, stop with your murder rate. Alot of kids listening to you. Wishing they you, wishing they was in a position with you to piss on their crew. Buttfuck all your sickness, we got the medicine. I'd rather piss on the capital, shit on the president. X-Government, still flowing, still showing. I know where you niggaz come from, know where you niggaz going. We was all raised in the same dangerous cell. Understand I ain't a stranger to hell, I just don't like it. Rappers say the same thing getting retired. So I write something I like and pray that you bite it. Take an old gangsta rapper and make him retire. Take a young conscious rapper and keep him inspired. Black man, where you at man, take a stand. They taking this rap shit like they took our land. Fuck America that's right, you ain't hear me stutter. Wallstreet, Dirty Dozen with DJ Butter"

You ready to sell your soul.... gheh-gheh-gheh. â€˜The Rap Gameâ€™. Motherfucker. [Swifty]. Iâ€™m a disruptive nigger. You made me crazy. You should a slayed me as a baby. Behavinâ€™ shadier than Wes Craven. And you ainâ€™t even gotta pay me. I take pleasure of layinâ€™ a nigga down daily. You face me drunk of sober. Youâ€™ll faint fast. Iâ€™m never fucked up to where I canâ€™t whoop your ass. Your neck will get snapped wit bear hands, fuck music. Is he rappinâ€™ is cool but fool donâ€™t confuse it. What happens these dudes get rude and then I lose it?. Iâ€™m scandals. I blow your two kids off the atlas. With a gat thatâ€™s bigger. Then Godzillaâ€™s back nigga. You are not real and in fact. Your fruity effect of a crack dealer. Yâ€™all president sends me smack. Den got a mack 10 with it. So I ainâ€™t gotta rap. But Iâ€™m thankful for that. Donâ€™t mistaken me black. Or you be stankinâ€™ in back of a fuckinâ€™ Cadillac. [Eminem]. Iâ€™ma get snuffed. Cause I ainâ€™t said enough to pipe down. I pipe down when the White House is whipped out. When I see that â€˜lil Cheany dike get snipped out. Lights out, bitch, adios, goodnight. Now put that in your â€˜lil pipe and bite down. Think for a minute cause the hype has died down. That I wonâ€™t go up in the oval office right now. And flip whatever ainâ€™t tied down upside down. Iâ€™m all for America, fuck the government. Tell that C. Doloris Tucker slut to suck a dick. Motherfucker, duck, what the fuck, son of a bitch. Take away my gun and Iâ€™m a tuck some other shit. Canâ€™t tell me shit about the tricks of this trade. Switch blade with a â€˜lil switch to switch blades. Switch from a 6 to a 16 inch blade. Shits like a samurai sword, a sensei. Shit just donâ€™t change to this day.

Iâ€™m sayinâ€™ you motherfuckers donâ€™t know and quit playinâ€™. If Iâ€™m broke then Iâ€™m brakinâ€™ open the place where you layinâ€™. You know, same shit every nigga done in his life. I lived it, thatâ€™s why I speak on what I want when I write. So why... should I... ever fear another man. If he bleed like I, bleed, take a piss and he stand. Ok, you win... you can say we canâ€™t rap. But no source never mean we ainâ€™t buyinâ€™ on what they say is wack. [Kuniva]. I walk in the party and just start bustinâ€™. Right after I hear the last verse, Iâ€™m self-destruction. This liquor make me wanna blast the chrome. To let you know that time without more is gettinâ€™ Jerome. Iâ€™m low down and shifty, quickly, called Swifty. To do a drive by on a 10-speed with ""50"". You feelinâ€™ lucky? Squeeze. I catch you outside of Chucky Cheese. Well, just see, who be an unlucky G. My life style is unstable, a partyinâ€™ attic. They said no fightinâ€™ in the club so I brought me a matic. Coughinâ€™ ecstatic, I jump niggas, call me a rabbit. Popinâ€™ a tablet, and guns that saw you in half. [50 Cent]. Believe me. We run this rap shit fo shizzie. Make makinâ€™ millions look easy. Every where ya turn you see me. You hear me. Believe me. For ya see my pistol in 3-D. No time to call a peace treaty. Dial 9-1-1 cause you need de. Police to help you, believe me. [Proof]. I snatch the tongue from the sidewalk and piss on the curb. This is absurd. These street niggas twistinâ€™ my words. We finally could. Say goodbye to Hollywood. Cause Proof and Shaun. Share nuttinâ€™ in common. The nastiest band. With gats in each hand. We never bomb down to be a flash and a pan. No remorse. Fuck you stature, dogg. Nuttinâ€™ to do with hands when I clap at yâ€™all. Put your jaw on the ground. With the 4 and a pound. Iâ€™m goinâ€™ out of town. For the long come around. So we can battle with raps. So we can battle with gats. Matter fact, we can battle with plaques. [50 Cent]. This Rap Game. [Bizarre]. Iâ€™m too fuckinâ€™ retarded. I donâ€™t give a fuck about my dick. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m datinâ€™ Loraina Bobbet. My crew had an argument. Who was the largest. Now they all is dead. And Iâ€™m rollinâ€™ as a solo artist. Plus I made all the beats and wrote all the raps. Well, I really didnâ€™t. But I did accordinâ€™ to this contract. I was stoned in the snow. With no where to go. Freezinâ€™ 20 below. Forced to join bail tip Dafoe. My little girl, she shouldnâ€™t be listeninâ€™ to these lyrics. Thatâ€™s why I glued the headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it. If rap donâ€™t work, Iâ€™m startinâ€™ a group with Garth Brooks (hahhaha). 50, sing the hook. [50 Cent]. This Rap Game, This Rap Game. I ainâ€™t sellinâ€™ my soul for this Rap Game.

searchin',"[Women Singing:]. Ain't no one special, special like you [4X]. I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby [4X]. [Eminem]. I'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing. Missing what I remember, kissing and hugging and squeezing. Bugging and weezing, I'm having trouble when breathing. It's even tougher when sleeping. But there's a couple of reasons that I'm suffering and grieving. For loving and leaving, you all I'm thinking of in the evening. You got my knees buckling and weakening. Thoughts of nothing but freaking that I'm struggling to keep in. And interrupt when I'm speaking. I got some game that I'm preparing to run. The way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun. You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun. Cause your comparing to none, I wanna share in the fun. I feel a passionate lust when I'm imagining just us alone at last with a. touch. I see you grasping to trust, but my intentions are good. The seed is passing in dust. I'm not asking to rush and answer immediately. I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me. If you agree to repeat after me, I Love You (I love you baby). Cause I just need you to see, how much I'm eager to be. Your man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed. This is easily said, so you can lead or be led. If you care to be down cause ain't nobody Like you no where to be found. [Chorus:]. [Women Singing:]. I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby [4X]. [Kon Artis]. Baby it's all on you, it's you I call on boo. Let's set a day up so you can fall on through. We'll take a spin in a Lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast. Long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es. We'll start it out with caviar, Don Parigne. And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on. We'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things. I got the herbs the Bacardi and Hurricane. If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day. It's still all right cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray. Your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear. You look impeccable, nothing compares. I dream of freaking you, the women that will speak it too so. It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so. Now we all set to play, only thing left to say is. When you step away, baby but don't forget the Neglicie. [Chorus:]. [Women Singing:]. I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby [8X]."
it's ok,"[Eye-Kyu] Check it out. [Eminem] Hey Kyu!. CHORUS 2x [Eye-Kyu]. It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok). I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright). It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep). It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here). Verse 1 [Eminem]. One day I plan to be a family man happily married. I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried. Till I'm glad to be buried. And leave this crazy world. And have at least a half a million for my baby girl. It may be early to be planning this stuff. 'cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough. 'cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough. I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed. My hands have been cuffed. But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff. Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts. I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough. And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see. My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased. With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese. I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call. Way before my baby is able to crawl. I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates. To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades. I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth. Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q. Chorus. Verse 2 [Eminem]. I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps. Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep. Praying for sleep. Dreaming with a watering mouth. Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse. In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts. With the root of all evil. I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful. And make them do shit illegal. For these Grant's and Jackson's. These transactions explain a man's actions. But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity. Through God and there's a wish he granted me. He showed me how to cope with the stress. And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed. Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest. To selling dope with the rest. I quit smoking cess to open my chest. Life is stressful inside this cesspool. Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel. My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics. He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts. Kids attract static, children with automatics. Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets. I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum. I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum. It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth. But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth. Chorus. Uh, it's ok, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep. Uh yeah, it's ok, it's alright, I can't sleep"

With a couple of valium inside her palm. It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve. To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves. I can't describe the vibe I get. When I drive by six people and five I hit (oops). Aww shit, I started a mosh pit. Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids (AHH!). These 'shrooms make me hallucinate. Then I sweat till I start losin weight. 'Til I see dumb shit start happenin. Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again. So bounce, bounce, come on bounce. (GUNFIRE) I said come on, bounce.

Had an accident when the Trojan broke. Ahh, poor baby, born by whore lady. Now I gotta strangle a.. (You're crazy!). [Swifty McVay]. I pop fo' E's at one time. And I don't need water when I'm swallowin mine. (Yeah, you got any shrooms?) Does Bizarre smoke crack?. We can't get jobs cause our arms show tracks. Why the hell you niggaz think I rap?. We do it just to get your company hijacked. And if you like smack (uh-huh) then I might too. (Swift, chill) I just wanna get high like you! (ewww). And I don't give a damn if they white or blue (uh-huh). Speed, 'shrooms, down the valiums (uh-huh). Even smoke weed outta vacuums. I just copped some and I'm goin back soon. [Chorus]. [Bizarre]. I'm at rave lookin like a slave, high off chronic. Gin and tonic demonic, body smell like vomit. Pussy poppin, acid droppin, dope-headed guy. Heroin mescaline, pencilnecks, wanna try?. Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre, actin ill. Drugs kill (Yeah right) - Bitch, I'm for real!!!. Shut your mouth you dirty slut, you know you want it in your butt. I'll put it in your cunt; let Bizarre nut!. [Chorus]. [Eminem]. Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us. That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other.

Niggas don't believe it till they see it's out. Stupid motherfuckers wanna take a scenic route. now the heaters out, bitches scream like I pulled my penis out. Beggin' me to put that big motherfucker away, but the demon's out. Everybody on the floor, come out of that mink. come out of them diamonds and you come out of that valuer. Party is over, shut the fuck down, cut the music. matter of fact turn it back it up, shit I can use it. I need the noise, in case I have to let a couple off. Saw another icy chain, walked over and tugged it off. Gimme that butter soft, they say she buyin' out the bar. You can buy my drinks for today and tomorrow. I'm out for the paper, my homie, better hide them jewels. I'm in the game starvin' and I ain't playin' by the rules nigga. Robbin', shootin', killin', murder (Murder, murdeeeerrrr) (2x).

one shot 2 shot,"I told y'all mothafuckas I was comin' back. What now nigga? What now what. What! You's the projects nigga. CHORUS [Eminem]. One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots. All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops. Bodies drop hit the floor music's off. Party stops, everybody hit the door someone's lickin' shots off. [Bizarre]. You bitches is gone, I'm dropped in the club. And I'm tryna run and get my mothafuckin' gun. (Nigga what about your wife?). Nigga fuck my wife, I'm tryna run and save my mothafuckin' life. Oh shit, the shoot is comin'. Bitches, hoes niggas is runnin'. People shot all over the floor. And I'm tryna make it to the ??? door {*Gunshot*}. That's the sound of the glock. Even DJ ??? fucked around and got shot. I done messed around and forgot my tec. I don't see nobody, but Fab Five and Hex (Kuniva you aight?). [Kuniva]. These niggas is trippin' (Where's Bizarre at?). I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at. Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wilin'. Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin'. This chick is clingin' onto me sobbin' and sighin'. Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'. But it's real and cats is gettin' killed. So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield. And she got hit now she yellin' (""Don't leave me!""). I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me. I squeezed through the back door and made my escape. I ran and got my 38 I hope it's not to late. Chorus. [Swifty]. (I been tryna call you all day mothafucka where you at?). I'm on seven mile, what the fuck was that?. Damn somebody hit me from the back (With they car?). With a gat nigga and my tire flattened. I just hit a pole, them niggas some ho's (Is you hit?). I don't know but I can tell you what they drove. It was a black Mitsubishi. (Shit that's the clique we beefin' wit' I swear). Maaan, and I was on my way there. Believe me I'm leavin' a carcass today. And I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way. I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tuck. I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up. Chorus. [Eminem]. I never seen no shit like this is my life before. People will still camp out from the night before. Sleepin' outside the door waitin' in line. still tryna get inside the club to see D-12 perform. The fire Marshals know, the venue's too small. People are wall-to-wall three thousand and some odd fans. and some come walk from out the parkin' lot. Get into an argument over a parkin' spot. This guy's about to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off. Missed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door in a St. Andrew's hall. Not a stray slidin' all over the place. Sprays one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall. Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off. I'm posted up by the bar havin' a Mozeltoff. Bullet whizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off. Thank God I'm alive I gotta find Denaun. And where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on him. Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre. Nah I guess not, what the fuck, oh my God it was. I never saw him run so fast in my life. Look at him haulin' ass, I think he left his wife. There she is on the ground bein' trampled. I go to grab her up by the damn hand and I can't pull her. God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit. My vest is barely able to handle it, it's to thin. If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep. Follow Bizarre's path and ran through it. And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps. Looked up and I seen Swift, shootin' it out. But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with. But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth. Chorus. [Kon Artis]. It's Friday night came to this bitch right. Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right. I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight. Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm poppin' niggas tonight. That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge. Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in. Swift told me to meet him here. So it's clear that this fucka shot out the back of his truck goes up in this mothafucka. So one shot for the money, two's to stop the show. Third's for the bartender, there's plenty of shots to go. (I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsubishi). He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit' a three piece. Chorus"

Till the pussy is booting it back out. I 69'd this one bitch and she bled in my mouth (shit). Kicked her out. Cleaned the couch out. And beat up my crouch. I don't gotta creep in motels. I cheat at my house. See I'm a dog. I don't need to keep a secret hide out (naw). [Bizarre]. All night I been snorting. Your age and where you're from. Is just not important (naw). You look like one of my mistresses. On welfare, ten kids like the rest of my bitches. Dreams of fucking a handicapped bitch. Suck my dick while your teeth start to grit (whore). Inner slave, that's how I want you to treat me. I ain't into S&M. But I love when you beat me. I told you I was a horny ass freak. While I'm beating my meat.

6 in the morning,"[Intro: Eminem]. Good mornin. Haha, wake your mother fuckin asses up. Yo what is the what?. Well come on then, you know what time it is. Stop sleepin on my roof bitch!. [Verse 1: Eminem]. For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my ass whipped. Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets ass squished. I just can't get past these little pissants. That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad. And they so mad they can't stand it. Cause we can and they can't spit (Haawk). And they can't handle it like a man. And that's when it just happens. And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't crap is it?. Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit. Maybe I'm old fashioned but my pashion. Is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin. Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but I'm pissed now. But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic. Cause I'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it. Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me. You poke a stick at a big boy you get bit B. These words stick to you like crazy glue. When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!. I'm the beatiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone. Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci-dently (argghhh!!). I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?. [Chorus: Eminem]. Come on an everybody come on an. Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an. Cause we get it on an till the break of dawn an. Wake your ass up motherfuckers quit yawnin. Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in the mornin. So have sing along with the words to the song an. If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an. Fake like you know 'em motherfuckin join in. Everybody come on an. [Verse 2: Swifty]. Its in the media pitted me of a beef starter. In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one. Fuck slugs I'm walkin gloves with a shotgun. Constantly popin slugs they hot son, better not run. The bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't concious. In a house full of dog shit,. I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathin. You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin. It ain't about what you readin. When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins. Either that or we'll be beefin free when. You niggaz need a 'E' just to speak shit!. Your leader is a botique bitch. Keep the heater where you can reach quick. I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret. Nigga I did it from a mind of a mental patient. When glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan. You brave?. [Chorus: Eminem]. Come on an everybody come on an. Kick your shoes off motherfuckers come on an. Cause we get it on an till the break of dawn an. Wake your ass up motherfuckers quit yawnin. Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in the mornin. So have sing along with the words to the song an.

But so what this beef is like. 'What the fuck did he say in his rap Em?'. I can see that he's just a punk. I mean these niggaz squeeze on me. Please I'm seeing guts. I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks. Am I empty seein them white I emtpy out them white to fight you. In front of every reporter that I don't like. No need for metaphores I get yours across when I write. So emotions enough to say ""fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!"". I might as well give this up like heavy sales. And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt. We can't self destruct. I've never felt it this much. Come on fellas, get up. We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life. [Verse 4: Kuniva]. I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off-a the hip. I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith. Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick. We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit. You probaly wish that you could be out shootin them G's. But the only thing you shoot is the breeze. I can't believe you speaking on movin key's. But every time we hear you kick it. The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets. I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack. So when they bust you better bust back. And get your guts clapped outa your stomach. And when they want it (yeah). I bring a hundred niggas from runave. So get your gun and if you comin. [Chorus: Eminem]. Come on an everybody come on an. Kick your shoes off motherfuckers come on an. Cause we get it on an till the break of dawn an. Wake your ass up mother fuckers quit yawnin. Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in the mornin. So have sing along with the words to the song an. If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an. Fake like you know 'em motherfuckin join in. Everybody come on an"

american psycho,"[Eminem]. I'm the devil - if ever there was such a thing. The results of much too many drugs what you're seeing. I'm a mindfuck, completely dis-(gus)-ting. I'm (white), a human mutt, fuck a being. I'm a dog - fuck lambs, I'm silencin 'em all. I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve. Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers. Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor. Each thought's completely warped. I'm like a walkin, talkin, ouija board. Speakin in tongues, I've never spoke this speech before. .. Hhem-delle-la, ennich-me-noughh-mi-niche-mick-norr ... Have you ever experienced spirits in lyrics when you hear 'em. 'til you scared to stare in into any mirrors when you near 'em?. Well if so, get ready for some shit yo. ""Is this some kind of sick joke?"" Shit no, motherfuckin schitzo. So disturbed, he just goes so berzerk he tiptoes. This verse was his urge to slit throats of just hoes. Just goes to shizzow you dizzon't, fizzuck with. so-someone this disturbed, sa-sippin on si-zzurp. So - lock your doors, drop to the floors. Get your shotguns drawn - here comes another ""Clockwork Orange"". Look at Bizarre; you really think he's right in his mind?. What the fuck you think's goin through it when he's writin his rhyme?. [Chorus: Eminem]. You bout to - journey into the mind of a psychopath killer. Blood spiller, mentality much iller. than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams. You'll feel his pain and his silent screams. You bout to - journey into the mind of a psychopath killer. Blood spiller, mentality much iller. than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams. You'll feel his pain and his violent screams. [Bizarre]. It's Friday night, I'm at a rave again. Pickin up transvestites on my Harley-Davidson (hey hop on). My girlfriend's a crackhead whore. She'll come to your door, suck your dick on the floor. and take your bottles to the store (nigga I'm takin these). Have you ever seen a bitch get beat because she won't cheat. Run the street and suck another nigga's meat?. My son's sixteen years old with nowhere to stay (dad it's me). I told him he wasn't mine, slammed the door in his face. And I ain't got no food, my job I've been cheated. My girlfriend had a miscarriage (I'm sorry) I had to eat it (ohh). My dick is burnin, it ain't cause of disease. Because I'm jackin off with gasoline mixed with antifreeze (AHH!). I'm livin in Waco Texas, me and my girl. Fuck David Koresh, I'm startin my own world. It's called Bizarre Cemetary, it's scary. Eatin a virgin's cherry, they're all gonna laugh at you Carey. [Chorus]. [Kon Artis]. I was born feet first, smoke 40's and drink weed. The Lord rehearsed my birth, I'm the worst breed. A nigga you ever set sight on, my right arm's. got more power than (?) Dragon's python so. ""Journey into the mind of a psychopath killer"". Light yo' ass like a liquid nitro-gas spiller. Psycho slash Michael Myers, Michael Jack's ""Thriller"". Rifle slash knife faggot that's your ""Cop Killer"". As a yung'un, I was beat where I was livin (aight). Crossdressed just to get thrown in the women's prison. I guess I was just stressed to be a hoodlum. Being pressed caused the stress that caused the Ritalin. Pressed stressed and Ritalin caused the cop's feelings. to be hurt after they seen what I did to those children. I'm vulgaric, you Bo Derek; I throw you face flat off the terrace. so you can have somethin to stare at."

What you hoes'll do. [Verse 2 - Kuniva]. We all soldiers, we move as a unit, we all roll up,. show up at your residence.

You can read it and weep,. you see my poster in the hood for the G of the week. [Chorus]. [Verse 3 - Bizzare]. They found Saddam, but they ain't gonna find me,. I'll be under a tree,. In Buttfuck Tennessee, and I don't know too much about my daddy,. Except he spit in my face and fucked me in my fanny,. I ain't a racist. I just hate whites, fags and dykes, blacks and transvestites,. 13 years old. And joined a fucking gang, hair under my ass cheeks. feeling the fucking pain. Am I insane?, who really knows, cause any. second my temper can fucking. Blow, I get colder than december, black the fuck out,. tomorrow won't even remember. See Bizzare can show what violence is all about,. and this Dr. Dre beat done brought it. The fuck out, run in your house and put A GUN in your mouth,. and blow your brains the fuck out. [Verse 4 - Eminem]. I probably got a screw loose or two or maybe three. or four of 'em, some fell out and hit the floor,. All I know is ever since my fuckin head hit the snowbank,. been a little niandrotholic, no thanks to. My man D' Angelo Baily,but I just take it slow daily,. my biggest delierence, tryin to figure whether. To use the flat head or the phillips, or just go to the Home Depot,. and pick the new power drill up,. Gives me two hours and 6 days and I'm still up,. I feel like I'm about to snap any minute, there's a new. Tower Records, I'm bout to stop and get a fill-up,. pick the new Cypress Hill up, and go find who did. That shit to Xzibit, and go fill up a whole liquor bottle. wit piss and shatter his fuckin lips wit it. [Chorus]"

Various opponents whose stature was hilarious. Like you. Throwing fairy dust. Then frowning hard on whack chorus. Proof was on the scene before Nat Morris. Cold as a black forest in these starving streets. A garbage heap that was brought. Stars could eat. The nerve of haters. Diss us perging gators. So I spit venom at you through your serve in vegas. The primitive fool again. None can match that. Blast at your rib cage. Making your spine hatch back. You lack fat tactics. And thoughts of Dexatrim. Whippin' my dick out on nuns. If they say sex is sin. Next to Slim. I'm Shady as a Tetris win. Dirty Dozen solo are respected men. Get known for craft. Irritate me like infected skin. The future ain't lookin' the same. Like a neglected twin. Some test the scary. That's unnecessary. To kill your crew, family, your friends. Your tech can carry. Knock your paws off sync. Left you flat like a soft drink. Got more styles than Diana Ross swing. Zone like Rick James when he smoke crack. You and Charli Baltimore. Got something in common. Y'all both whack. Proof the king P-I-N. If I ain't the best this year. The motherfucker be my twin. [Bizarre]. Who's the bitch ass nigga. That's mentioning my name?. No one to blame. I just cock back your name. None of y'all bitch ass niggas wanna test. Cuz five minutes or less. I'll be at your assets. You're just a bitch. And I wanna test you. And the niggas you was with. They already left you. So duck down cuz Bizarre Kid's comin' here. Shootin' at you and your peers. And cousins you ain't seen in years. Hope you believe in God. Cuz nigga you better pray. Pull your kids from the window. And duck from this AK. And already done called the Proof and Denaun. And even if I want to. I can't change my nigga's lines. Cuz you on the shit list. These bullets are relentless. And ain't no way in hell that you avoidin' this. Ain't no apologies. Yo I see your number on my caller ID. Bitch, stop callin' me. Fuck the truce. Nigga I pull the deuce deuce. And my niggas go wild. Like a bunch of rats that got loose. I'm comin' for you nigga. So hide behind your door. Cuz all my niggas believe in the Art Of War. Chorus (x4). What you startin' for?. Is you on for war?. Trife assassins. Bringing you the art of war. [Kuniva]. Straight wylin'. Burying bodies right on top of each other. So when somebody ask. I just say you under the weather (Killer Eel). No matter what the problem. Revolvers can solve 'em. Keep a nigga breathless. The tech whips regardless. Heartless. Walking you punks right to the edge of darkness. We're way beyond that. When I pull me out a cartridge. I bank shots. Wettin' up your white tank top. While my nigga Bugz is stickin' up. Your nearest gang spot. Just another scarred liar retired. We make niggas pass out like fliers. Flossin' my teeth with barbed wire. Leavin' a bloody mess. Then harass kids. And buy 'em a candy bar. So they can tell me where you live. [Kon Artist]. Highly dangerous. Spraining my wrist. Lickin' off this black tech. With my eyes flossed bitch. Look up the Art of War. In the ghetto dictionary. And see Bizarre holding your kids. Hostage for their Crunch Berries. My pump stay hot. Coat stomachs like Malox. Run away spots. Setting it off with the guns that Dre got. Ghetto séance. But ass backwards. Fuck bringing you back to life. Nigga we putting you in your caskets. Running off with the mop like you got somethin'. But in my mind I'm thinking. Blast soon as I spot somethin'. And when you fall. I know damn well I done shot somethin'. And I'm cleaning your brains. Off my windshield for frontin'. D-12 is. Your local weed sellers. Throwing pipe bombs in your church. To kill your elders. The men on bitches like tracks. You notice these. Banging clits and ovaries. Till they drop the sheets. Niggas'll die from these. Blows we inflict. You supposed to be in some shit. Cuz you the underdog bitch. Chorus (x2). [Bugz]. Bugz'll murder you. In less than a word or two. Bring the art of war to your door. Call me Sonny Zoo. Nigga don't be mad cuz your broad is a trick. Always dialing 976-need-a-dick (bitch). Niggas like you. I'm known to smack, stab, and spit on. Kick at, hit on, you hear me bitch? It's still on. Calling through my crib. Like your bout it with your shouts. Ain't you the same nigga. Who was crying on his couch. Apologize on site boy. If you like your life boy. (Yo Bugz, leave that nigga alone. You know he just a white boy). Fuck that. I smack him off the wheels. And take his bleel. Or bought a royal mope. And destroy him with my steal. You pussy ass. How you figure it will linger. Take your bitch on Jenny Jones. Then beat your ass on Jerry Springer. Don't fuck with it. Or get your head split and mouth bruised. That's a promise. Fuck *Hal Shoes*. Chorus 'till fade"

Hand me an .8, beam me up and land me in space. I'ma sit on top of the world {I'm here} and shit on Brandy and Mase. I'm more than ill. I'm scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill {Ahh!}. Human horror film. but with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me. cause I'ma still be Madd Rapper, whether I got money or not {yup}. As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot. I'll be in a canoe paddlin, makin fun of your yacht. But I would like an award. for the best rapper to get one mic in The Source. and a wardrobe I can afford. Otherwise I might get sent up back-strike in a Ford. And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicadin for. Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank. looks like a middle finger sideways flippin me off. No shit I'm a great danger to my health.

I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin James Todd Sr.. across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {Ow! Ow! Ow!}. I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth. with a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse. And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate. since the third time that I failed 9th grade. You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it. I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon}. I laugh at the sight of death. as I fall down a cement flight of steps {ahhhhhhhh!}. and land inside a bed of spider webs. So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend. can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again. Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin mine out.

bugz' 97,"Fuck that!. Who run shit, watch these drums hit. You dove head first into some old dumb shit. Here's a can of ass whip, for you to come get. Your clique made their trip, I made them hoes submit. Ask your girl, she knows the scoop don't fuck with Bugz bitch. I'll chop off her titti, have you sucking one tit. Them pink belly *****s is who you run with. Making half ass songs, shitty snares and one kick. I hate your damn sound, don't like it one bit. You can make a double album, won't have one hit. Your entire outfit is on some bullshit. And there's not a damn one that I can't out wit. I admit, that my style is unfit. For mamma's baby boy because I'm on some dumb shit. Like I commit arsony, get harm quick. You pull the alarm switch, I'll stab you in your armpit. Now who the nitwit wanna come get with. This egotistic, hip-hop fundal mentalisitic. Don't risk it, you'll get your shit split. Now keep your distance, and keep existence. I'm the persistent when it comes to bench shit. I smoked a blunt with my judge before my sentence. I'm relentless to deny you're senseless. Yo bitch, pay my bill that's where the hell your rent went. Fuck that!"
butterfly,"Ay, ay the idiotic kid's back. with the attack, ready to put two macks to your back. Ain't no fussin when I start bustin. Lyrically cussin, why Jay Dee's want production.

The rude boys is frontin, legends is pumpin. Bella is jumpin, the heat is like shh...bumpin. Ready or not rap world here i come. comin to every battle screamin out"

And truly this ain't a movie, you get slapped with the tooly. So pass the slimmy and the Hennessy, I got the energy. to steal every car in this vicinity, you feelin me?. Take it back to when Das EFX was sayin niggity-wiggity-wild. Piggity-pow, nigga be out. You don't really want war, I'm chillin at your door. This uzi will have you bloody windmill-ing on the floor. I can't be a punk, my daddy wasn't none. I lose a fight after school and I came home and got one. You reap what you sew, that shit you oughta know. I keep it on the flo' under the seat – I ain't a hoe!. . [ Chorus - Kuniva + Kon Artis ]. You know it's been a while but we feelin it now. (The rough sound muh'fucker, niggaz killin it now). Goddamn!

Hit the weed (guzzle your Corona) pass the Gin. (Better duck cause they back bustin gats again). . [ Verso 2 - Swift ]. A basket case indeed; stronger than a can of mace. Slap you in the face while you patty-cakin witcha seed. I'll be makin all these niggaz wanna take a beam. And put it right on my head. You don't be takin heed, you probably idol the Feds. Havin meetings to recite what I said. Liable to have you in a medical room. Walk in that bitch with a cell phone then turn it on. ""You fittin to die holmes!"" {*explosion*}. Got a chrome that be fuckin up shit worse than I. You would swear that I'm a Gemini. I kill a guy for nothin - eye to eye. And I ain't gotta touch them niggaz face soon as I say somethin. Got a pump that'll tear your arm quick, when I leave a carcass. You would think you in Death Row's office (AHH!) {*gun clicks*}. (Hang a nigga!) I'm ill enough to fall in the middle of moshpits. Survive and I'm gettin up high without a flaw bitch!. . [ Chorus - Kuniva + Kon Artis ]. . [ Verso 3 - Proof ]. I'm a dog on the mic that'll brawl out with Christ. Get to cappin at your captain 'til he fall outta life. I'm all outta nice, nigga tuck your chain. Put holes in your head and finger-fuck your brain. Fool fuck this game, I'm poppin at coach. Momma dropped me on my head. and knew that somethin was broke. I ain't feelin nothin you wrote so I'm stompin your throat. Show up at the hospital and start punchin your folks. I'm a uzi with arms and legs. Duty calm your man, before my tooly bomb his head (WHAT!). You wanna take what my 40-cal since you bitch-made. Spittin the right game so yo' ass can get laid. the fuck down, I don't give a fuck now, whassup?. Talkin bout ""Clappin"" - quit actin, you barely bust nuts. Don't get it twisted at the gates, the name is Proof. And I'ma kill every man that came with you. . [ Verso 4 - Bizarre ]. Yeah, yeah – KNOCK KNOCK! Guess who showed up?. 44-mag and tear your whole door up. Pink shower cap and, yellow drawers. My dick's so small, I can pee on my own balls (hahaha). When it comes to pussy, Bizarre goes to work.

[ Chorus - Kuniva + Kon Artis ]. . [ Verso 5 - Kuniva ]. Yo, I chuck niggaz daily, a six-man crew that's born crazy. A triple O.G. like Tray Deee (whattup Loc?). I stay sparkin, bitch I got a attitude. I step on your shoes and won't say pardon - be cautious!. Hidin from the one-time, nutty as I wanna be. Wild and disorderly, pissin on your toilet seat. Nigga now you know it's me, I got a .44 wit me. Bitches all over me, +Sayin Yes+ like Floetry. Homie you wanna be a G? Go toe-to-toe wit me. It ain't no hoe in me dawg, I shoot out where your colons be. Wave the people-mover, crowd-controller. Rob niggaz 'til my pockets look greener than Yoda. And you know that I'm the +Shady+ type, the crazy type. That's probably why promoters never pay me right. We a bunch of hooligans, my hands is on the tool again. I'm bout to bust a Huey and spray up a fuckin school again. . [ Chorus - Kuniva + Kon Artis ]. . [ Outro - Bizarre ]. Yeah, D-12. Devil's Night, part two. The drama continues. KaySlay, hahahaha"
chance to advance,"[Gun shots followed by screaming]. [Proof:]. Pow-pow! Straight off the corral. Now, the dirtiest street vet from the mile. Is vexed without the techs and six shooter. Body bullet polluter, perverted intruder. Now who the, fuck wanna buck with the diseased, that's dis-eased. I got a bitch named trigger, my main-squeeze will make your brain. freeze. Dirty D is dope like cane. [Eye-Kyu:]. Remained eased, maintain chill status with no pause. Hot slugs to your carriages, turn your dome to coleslaw. My only thought is survival before my arrival. I'm jumping out on niggas like I'm 5-0. Smack 'em up like a pack of trifling fly hoes. Any opportunity to mangle I never pass up. Fucking your clique with broom sticks - face down, ass up. Dirty Dozen packing the shit to turn your chest red. With our dick in ya mouth, fucking everything you just said. [Eminem:]. Yeah yeah bitch, coming to a block near you is Dirty Dozen. Nasty like a stank, slut bitch with 30 husbands. When I was 5 I was already fuckin'. And playing X-rated cassettes in Teddy Ruxpin. I used to walk up and down the block cussin'. Locked in youth homes at 6 with glocks bussin'. I grew up with not ballers, who got dollars. Shot callers with guns and Rotwillers. [Bizarre:]. By any means necessary I'm on a killing spree. It's the devil in me, intoxicated with brown Hennessy. Beware life ain't fair and I don't care. Cher braids my hair while her kids are in day-care. Two blunts and I'm out for lunch. Your whore said I'm here ""Sugar pie, honey bunch"". This Bizarre kid, that ain't the answer. You're more uncomfortable than an anorexic cat with fucking cancer. [Chorus:]. Here's your chance to advance. Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants. Here's your chance to advance. Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants. Here's your chance to advance. Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants. Here's your chance to advance. Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants. [Bizarre:]. Back from the studio boy, I don't wanna mingle. Smoking LSD, working on Lou Roths new single. Who's the big guy who's quick like Sugar Ray. Fuck Calgon bitch, Bizarre might take you away. Give up the pussy cause I know you a freak. ?? in a week, cause my kids got to eat. Date raping anorexic girls in my beat-up car. (Hold up Bizarre, you taking that shit too far!!!). but I can't stop cause my brains ain't there. [Eminem:]. Bust a nut then drop that bitch in Lake St. Clair. Your mistakes ain't rare, your rap style annoys. You rap like a bitch plus I can't stand your voice. Bitch you suck, you whack as fuck, eat a dick. You need a brick upside your dome, we be the clique. Runnin' you down in carloads. Leaving you smashed down on tar roads, flat line like barcodes. [Eye-Kyu:]. Put up your guard hoes, I'm blazing heat the way we speak. Not even Nike could cover these amazing feats. Burning rappers eternally, internally and externally. For half stepping like one-legged fraternities. Quickdraw McGraw, AKA Eye-Kyu. Putting something inside you, leaving holes that I see right through. For anyone obstructing my view, my art of attack. Is slugs through your chest, that'll blow your heart out your back. Making sure you get fed, with a whole lot of led. And throw you over the Ambassador Bridge and scream ""Drop Dead!"". [Proof:]. Largely, I'm out to stack equations, without a tax-evasion. Make moms say ""That's amazing,"" all the same like black and Asian. My pack evasion, attack a stage and you blush like a Cadillac,. I wish your fleet would try to battle rap,. Or make a man bleed, like a cattle pack stampede. Front and co-sign my hands leave. Think to Recognize like Sam Sneed. My ?? dispose ya, froze ya, another classic closure. The death-master out to blast ya. My team runs shit, from from the D E side, down to last ya. Past the, norm, my crew swarm, molest the children of the corn. Dirty D 'till infinity, now bring it on. [Chorus:]. Here's your chance to advance. Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants. Here's your chance to advance. Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants. Here's your chance to advance. Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants. Here's your chance to advance."
changed man,"""Changed Man"". (feat. Johnta' Austin, T.I.). [2Pac]. Shit, I'm a changed man. Ay, turn the lights out. Big baller 2Pac up in this bitch. Y'know how we swing this shit, look. [Verse One: 2Pac]. By age sixteen I sold to dopefiends. Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely. Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin who broke the law. Far too inhibited for gunsmoke, I broke his jaw. Words harder than a fuckin diamond. Mobile phone call to Simon, niggaz trippin homey, when we ridin?. Fuck them slowly like Jodeci. And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M.O.B.. And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns. I hit your block and we can box for fun. Nigga one on one, last to fall is a baller cat. It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?. So if you knew me in my past life. Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life. I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?. The gameplan of a changed man, so what I'm sayin is. [Chorus: Johnta' Austin + (2Pac)]. I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider. (Fuckin with a changed man). I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it up. (Nigga you fuckin with a changed man). All my real thug niggaz, go and get your hands up. You go and drink the Henn' up. (You fuckin with a changed man). Changed man, you're dealin with a changed man. [Verse Two: T.I.]. In drop top, the glock cocked, got rocks in my socks. Cops spot Watt niggaz but hardly stop niggaz. Not if they got niggaz, doughboys and hot niggaz. Who mighta shot niggaz but only by strugglin. I'm for respect nowadays they expect me. to be in a Ferrari or the old Lexus. Or anything you see flashin past and can't catch. Dat's me, gauge on the Escalade back seat - don't creep. Oh what you think, T.I., P and them sweet? (Don't sleep). Get you hit from your head to your feet (And you don't know me). I'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me. You walk in, exploded and leave reload. You don't like a record nigga, fuck you, blow me. But you will respect me or get it in your neckpiece G. No three niggaz here are gonna let me be. or get your insides exposed to the streets nigga. [Chorus]. [Verse Three: 2Pac]. A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row. Three wheel motion, comin through coastin. Who's that nigga in the G-ride screamin out. M.O.B.! Nigga we ride. I hit the charts like a stick-up kid. #1 in the nation. I fucked the world, the Judge gave me probation. Faced with incarceration. Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin to the whole nation. GIMME MINE, or I'm blastin on every song. Murder my enemies, I'm mashin until I'm gone. One love to my thug niggaz. And fuck a bitch, cause a true sister love niggaz. Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope. Never come against the massive smoke, on Death Row. My adversaries BLEED. But fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease, fuckin with a changed man. [Chorus]. [Chorus w/ 2Pac speaking over it]. [2Pac]. E'rybody think they understand me. Shit, you niggaz don't know me. Y'all know that nigga on the rap song. Y'all know that nigga in the movies. You don't know this nigga in 3-D. Real live right up against you in front of yo' face. Shit, nigga you fuckin with a changed man. [Outro: 2Pac]. Westside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe. You fuckin with a changed man. Hahaha.. you fuckin with a changed man. Hahaha.. I ain't the same, you fuckin with a changed man. We ain't the same, you fuckin with a changed man. We ain't the same, fuckin with a changed man. Changed man"

I might as well give this up like heavy sales. And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt. We can't self destruct. I've never felt it this much. Come on fellas, get up. We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life. [Kon Artis]. I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off'a tha hip. I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith. Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick. We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit. You probaly wish that you could be out shootin them G's. But the only thing you shoot is the breeze. I can't believe you speaking on movin key's. But every time we hear you kick it. The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets. I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack. So when they bust you better bust back. And get your guts clapped outa your stomach. And when they want it (yeah).

That's why I just started workin' out.. Man, this shit ain't workin' out."
derelict theme,"[Kon Artis]. I damage your neck. With the butt of the tech. Vandalous sex. Cuttin' you ear to ear. With the razor of my Gillette. You couldn't get respect. If you was a captain or a cadet. Granddaddy, daddy, or uncle who's a Vietnam vet. I'll battle you 50 deep. Solo artist shocker dead beat. Derelicts on the loose. Wylin' like thugs outta prison with slugs. While y'all start screaming. Like grasses in a submission. (Lay down your pot to piss in). Blow up the house you live in. Believe me, we greedy. And often you is easy. Your whole album cheesy. Because you got platinum artists on it. Don't make it hot. We steamroll with real niggas. And that's something that you not. I'm vampin what you got. Then setting up camp at your spot. Foiling your plot. Every rhyme that you jot. I rock to the six like musty twat. A dead corpses that been cut up. And left in abandoned lots. Ya, derelicts theme. Comparing your team. To ours is a fucked up dream. The shit I done seen. Has turned me to a scandalous fiend. Sticking your peeps for cream. Gators or boots, nigga, I'm crushing your dreams. As foul as it seems. Dismantling spleens til your whole clique's. Walking funny like handicapped juggling teams. I rumble with kings. More humble with seen. Until it's time for me to kill again. Sincerely yours, the Kon Artis. [Chorus]. Ay yo. Competition of none's such. Derelicts the one must. Let the guns bust. Brigade one trust. Untouched. Martyr a mic. Slaughter your life. Runnin avenue soldiers bitch. It's water and trife. Competition ain't none such. Derelicts the one must. Let the guns bust. It's Brigade one trust. Untouched. Martyr a mic. Slaughter your life. Runnin' avenue soldiers bitch. Smarter and trife. [Bizarre]. Who's the fat bastard. Rapping that mo' master. Snorting coke that's whiter than Casper. Better run faster. I can out-smoke all of you motherfuckers. And bitch I was born with asthma. Fuck life, I'd rather track Jack Daniels. Smoke weed and rape Cockerspaniels. A peeping Tom, nigga I need Ridalin. Fuck girls. Bitch I only date senior citizens. Your grandma, nigga I'm the one that vic'd her. Next time you rush me. You better be a little bit quicker. Run your streets in the house. And make full of malt liquor. I'm lettin' you throw the first blow. And bring ten of your toughest niggas. End ya year. Like the last day of December. (But did you rape that bitch?). I was so drunk I can't remember. I used to be in a group. We had an argument who was the hottest. Now both them niggas is dead. And I roll as a solo artist. Chorus. [Kuniva]. Look bitch you stressed out. I divide these bullets equally among your crew. And give you five so you don't feel left out. Like red the hammer. I'm nailing niggas in they spleens. Just to make walking again a sympathetic dream. Energetic schemes. Rap vandal and dismantle. Tackle MC's and wax you. Like your rap name was Candle. Grabbing a mic with no handles. Leaving you dusty. Like walking the desert in old sandals. If you weeded or drunk. Keep your heat in your trunk. We beat you to lumps. Swell you up with permanent mumps. We dangerous playa. Cuffin' my chews. Spittin the phlegm out. Getting at you whether you coming out. Or you been out. You never exempt. From this murderous attempt. I'm telling you pimp. Undeniably you are a loss. Invincible, why you trying to be a mind boss. If the Kon Artis say it then it's done. With or without a gun. Eat a track and spit out a drum. Bust one. Trust none. Playing the game of death. Take your last breath. 'Til your last name is left. Chorus"
desperados ft. almighty dreadknaughts,"[Proof]. Yo, ay yo turn the heads and the mics up. We got the Dreadknaughts, you know what I'm sayin. Super MC, you know what I mean. Bugz, Dirty and all that, all that shit. You know what I'm sayin, Desperados with the cars, Eminem. [Eminem]. Chauvinist pig, droven this Big Lincoln. Till it went over the bridge. Jumped out and dove in the ditch. Broke in a mobile home and stole a stove and fridge. Kidnapped the parents and left the ransom note for the kids. I'm going for your mids. Here's a body blow for your ribs. While you're clutching your stomach and bleeding all over your bitch. I know where you live, your girl showed me your crib. Unless she told me a fib. Then I'm gonna have both y'all get did. Burning incense, facing a murder sentence. Under intent, for investigation for killing infants. While I sit in padded rooms doing shrooms. Having visions of dead pregnant women with brooms jammed in their wounds. Slit your carpet and rugs, and fucked your apartment up. Sticking up all the drugs, and jumping in garbage trucks. I'm from the shitty slums that look like the city dumps. Give you a kidney punch, and mug you to get me lunch. See me every summer, layin up against the dumpster. With a one hundred dollar jumper, smothered in southern comfort. Got my Slim Shady sticker on your mother's bumper. She came home screamin a bunch of motherfuckers jumped her. [Proof]. Ay yo. Pursue to list em, there's no need to diss em. They be beheavin, make sure your whole breathing system. Twist them like big caps, who wants to hear that. Rap, murder rates, and I snap vertebrates. Collapse further states, my tribe reserves the grave. Your pack deserve a crate"
devils night,"[Eminem]. I make music to make you sick of fake music. Hate music. Like devil worshipping Satan music. So say your prayers, your Hail Mary's, and Jesuses. Take two sticks and tape 'em together to make a crucifix. Try to stop it but you can't do it. A whole generation of kids blowing out their fucking brains to this. Kurt Cobain music. Students converted to 'caine users. As soon as they heard it. Went out and murdered and main to it. What's your name.... [Swift]. Judas. Got my nine with six sharp shooters. Now let's do this. I got niggas that's used to static. You don't understand how I'm all up in you niggas TV's like Carolan. I'm a poltergeist. Lyrically I'm supposed to strike. Trying to snatch this mic. You get cracked with moisonite(??). (Swifty get your own woman). I want his wife!. I'm the type to go to gambling parties with trick dice. I rob casinoes. Slugs eat those. You think it was the Devil feeding your jalapeños?. Now you out of the scene hoe. Shot at your clean clothes. A four-four. Prone to make you niggas breathe wrong. [Chorus: Eminem]. It's Devil's Night. It's Devil's Night. It's Devil's Night. Cuz I came back to rule this time. It's Devil's Night. Cuz I came back to take what's mine. It's Devil's Night. It's Devil's Night. It's Devil's Night. Cuz I came back to rule this time. It's Devil's Night. Cuz I came back to take what's mine. It's Devil's Night. [Kon Artis]. I'm on the john. Trying to shit and get no response. Constipated bitch tell these pigs to back off. The mind of a rapist. Denaun never changes. Beat up strangers without a reason. I'm a anus. Walk the street. Then beat a jack with a glove to match it. Drop the hatchet I put my head on opposite and step backwards. Walking zombie that's ornery. Pulling on robberies on politicians without a sense of comradery. [Kuniva]. I can concoct the nine flat. Plus I run with the best. Hop on the motorcycle busting wheelies over ya chest. Bystanders standing by thinking nowhere to mess. Blast you every hicky that them bitches put on your neck. What the fuck do you expect when the slugs get dealt?. And make you feel every ounce of pain that Bugz had felt. A deranged teen. Smoking ganja and greens. This carbean'll make your fucking head shake like tambourines. I pledge alleigance to the streets of the D. And if you think you out cold catch a piece of this heat. And when it blast it'll take off every piece of your *niece*. From her berets to her cheeks to her cute little feet. Chorus. [Bizarre]. STOP TAKING DRUGS. I'm trying. My little boy's dying. He's losing too much iron. And if I die it won't be because I got shot. It'd be because I tied my arm in a sock and smoked rock. Taking drugs is cool. That's why I buy 'em. Shoot 'em in my ass. Let your little brother try 'em. Ten years is what I'm facing. Police breaking in my house. Lil' Bow Wow in the basement. A rapist that'll bust in your mouth. I'll probably be in jail 'fore this fucking album comes out. I'm eighteen years old still shit in the bed. Beating till I'm red. Fear nothing but water and bread. Me and Ken. Fucking dirty Jen. So what if it burns. Bitch when I stick it in. No medication. I'm out of percasets. I lost my weed. Plus my fucking diaper's wet. Chorus."
"dirty, filthy, rotten, scoundrels","Shit. Shane Capone... the idiotic Bizarre. Spit in your face. [Bizarre]. Shut the fuck up, before your ass get knocked. It's hard to talk, with a gun in your mouth. Dirty Dozen, nothin' but bad news. Fuck a bitch in the ass with a rubber Hush just used. Fuck the pain, I don't give a shit. Tie me up and beat my ass cheek with hockey sticks. (uh! ""you're sick"") I don't give a damn. Smokin' crack with Michael Jackson in the ???? ???. program. Blaow, blaow! You hear this loud sound.

Dirty, filthy, rotten scoundrels. Dirtyyyyyy, filthyyyyyy, rottennnn, scoundrels. Dirtyyyyyy, filthyyyyyy, rottennnn, scoundrels. [Swift]. We walk around this bitch triflin'. Quick to sock a nigga while we cipherin'. Rubber gloves, Black man rifled in my right hands. Watchin' rappers dash like hyphens. Burnin' y'all without the Tetracycline. I'ma let your set know, I can get drunker than Jethro. Just to run up on you, and crack you with this ????. Smash your vehicle, snatch your key and go. You niggaz think you got somethin' to say, let me know. Don't bite your tongue, fuck it. Rappers switch subjects. When I'm steppin' in they company, them hoes don't get. budgets. Snatchin' briefcases with your hundreds. Packin' heat just in case you want it (nope). Bodies in abundance. I have no feelings, tell you the truth - I'm known,. bitch. I'm lettin' loose any affiliate you run with. So pack your gun quick (nigga), 'cause I'ma let you. know. You ain't got a bone to pick with me, bitch I fuck so. [Hush]. Aiyo I'm iller than a white rapper usin' the word. nigga (WHAT!?). Got a conflict with my dick like Dirk Diggler. Became sick in the brain since Bugz's death. Whoever did it, I'm a bust a nose, slugs is left. I'm harder than my dick when I'm watchin' my first. porn. Ill enough to kill your wife while she's havin' her. first born. Leavin' the hospital, in a voice just like Beavis. Screamin' ""I need some!"" while I'm holding up a fetus. Spittin' the hot shit, nickname is Godzilla (ugggh!). Natural born, undercover cop killa. On the reala, yo, you're just an enemy. Bout to come up missing like a second John Kennedy. Try to gamble with Swift, muthafucka the bet's on. Let Shane fuck your bitch while Bizarre jacks off. Hush, I'm crushing rappers while I'm somersaulting. backwards. Bustin' nuts up in your mattresses, says nobody a. better rapper. Chorus. [Shane Capone]. What you motherfuckas want, red dots when I pull it. Unless your name's Pac, you ain't shakin' five bullets. Anymore, we hustle for cheddar, cheese, and mayo. Quick to hit your city up with more felonies than Jayo. We got murder for hire, all it takes is a call. We leave you slumped over in the suburbs like Biggie. Smalls. Venomous lyrics, spittin' shit like pipe bombs. Leave your maggot brain, hangin' out the frame like. Esham. We some Dirty, Filthy. But y'all ain't feelin' this shit. We cummin' sicker than a syphilis dick. When we spit, somebody find Puff. Go tell him we got Jennifer hostage. We gon' rape this little bitch, ain't none of y'all. stoppin'. 'Cause we raw doggin' these bitches and they asshole. with age. Hell naw, this ain't range, but I got pistols on beret. Big Capone up in this bitch like the return of the. living dead.

And ""Please God"" the last words out ya mouth. No affiliates, just dogs and troops. Most lyin' death than this morgue and roots. All we choose to beef, I bring spatulas. Flip it and throw it back at ya, so bring your gat with ya. Spectacular murder manufacturer, fuck binacular. Only heaters talkin, I'm trappin ya just to flattin ya. Hop in the accura, roll up on the back of ya. Chill out in 5, and then them niggaz act alive. I smoke branches from off the tree tops. I hang with real niggaz, PA's, PK's and Pete Rock. Y'all niggaz with pre-ops, spill blood and Reeboks. Don't discriminate blastin rookies on the e-box(?). Your streetforce envolves just for excitement. Like if you wasnt you never heard of enditement.

I promise you get toared up and re-torn again. Not one slur or word will be re-born again. As long as the shit cracks and they turn a loop up. I spit it until it's pitch black and burn the roof up. Better step the fuck up for the shit getting spit. Turns to whips getting lit, turns to tick-tick-tick. Niggaz be rapping just for the clubs, just for the love. That hit you had in the club sound like shit in the truck. That's why I love that nigga X, cause he raised my brow. With every rhyme, without having to take my style. It'll be a cold day in hell when these two soldiers lay in hell. Talk to me. [Billy Nix]. Billy Nix, I'm really sick of this silly shit. Rappers, get on the mic, swearing they're really spit. But you really fake, tough guy stop at your thirty-eight. Drop your gloves and get taped, stop with your murder rate. Alot of kids listening to you. Wishing they you, wishing they was in a position with you to piss on their crew. Buttfuck all your sickness, we got the medicine. I'd rather piss on the capital, shit on the president. X-Government, still flowing, still showing. I know where you niggaz come from, know where you niggaz going. We was all raised in the same dangerous cell. Understand I ain't a stranger to hell, I just don't like it. Rappers say the same thing getting retired. So I write something I like and pray that you bite it. Take an old gangsta rapper and make him retire. Take a young conscious rapper and keep him inspired. Black man, where you at man, take a stand. They taking this rap shit like they took our land. Fuck America that's right, you ain't hear me stutter. Wallstreet, Dirty Dozen with DJ Butter"

fight music,"[Chorus: Eminem]. This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit. Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it. It's just some shit, for these kids, to trash they rooms with. Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit. The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it. You just know - that's the new shit. The type of shit that causes mass confusion. and drastic movement of people actin stupid. [Kon Artist]. I come to every club with intention to do harm. With a prosthetic arm. And smelling like Boone Farm. Hiding under tables as soon as I hear alarms. Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own mom. Kuniving Kon. Artis with a bomb. Strapped to my stomach screamin'. ""Let's get it on!"". A lust that love the drank. Drunk driving a tank. Rolling over a bank. Cops see me and faint. It's drastic. I'm passed my limit of coke. I think I'll up my high by slitting your throat. Push a baby carriage into the street. Till it's minced meat. Your men's been beat. The minute I step foot on your street. This is fight music!. [Bizarre]. You know why my hands are so numb? (No). Cuz my grandmother sucked my dick. And I didn't cum (Oh). Smacked this whore for talking crap (Bitch). So what if she's handicapped (What?). The bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap (haha). I fuckin hate you. I'll take your drawers down and rape you. While Dr. Dre videotapes you (Hell yeah!). Satan done got me on this song. Eatin a hotdog readin the Holy Qu'ran. While I'm on the john. Tired of wearin this yellow thong. Take it back Sisqo. You know where it belongs (thong th-thong thong). Now here's a gun. I'll put it in your palm (baw). Now go over there and blow off Dru Hill's arms. Fuck your love songs. [Chorus]. [Proof]. Just bring who you gon bring on. Who you gon swing on?. I'm King Kong. Guns blow you to king-dom come. Show you machine gun funk. Sixteen M-16's. And one pump (click clack). Snubbing my paw. Shove it in your jaws. Have you runnin out this fuckin club in your drawers. We lovin the brawls, it's nothin to applaud. But fuck it it's all good. The hood is up in The Source. It's fight music. [Swifty]. I'm a nigga that love scuffles. And won't hesitate to sock you again with swollen knuckles. I'm like that. Catch a nigga like bear traps. Blow his head back right in front of the preist. Sayin ""Ya here that?"". I slap your freak. Bump you and won't speak. If you step on my feet. You get drowned in your own drink. I suffocated my shrink just for talkin. Came back and fucked up his pall bearers. And made them drop his coffin. It's fight music!. [Kuniva]. These beads I'm swingin is stingin em. See all these niggaz?. When I step in the club I'm bringin em. And any nigga lookin too hard. We Rodney King'n em. Malice Green to them. And gasoline'n em with premium. Light a cigarette flick it at em or spit it at em. Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him. Blast while you right hookin. Right when your wife's lookin. Fuck fight music bitch. This is losin your life music. [Eminem]. If I could capture the rage. Of today's youth and bottle it. Crush the glass with my bare hands and swallow it. And spit it back in the faces of you racists. And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit. You Liberaces, Versaces and you Nazi's watch me. Cuz you think you got me in this hot seat. You motherfuckers wanna judge me cuz you're not me. You'll never stop me. I'm top speed and you pop me. I came to save these new generations of babies. From parents who failed to raise them cuz they're lazy. So grow to praise me, I'm makin em go crazy. That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me. And you fugazy if you think I'm a admit wrong. I'll cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sicked on. And this song is for any kid who get's picked on. A sick song to retaliate to and it's called. Chorus. THIS IS FIGHT MUSIC!."

girls,"Eminem. Girls (Limp Bizkit Diss). Ayo dog. I got some shit on my motherfucking chest that. I need to get off cuz. If I don't. I'ma fucking explode or something. Now look. This is the story about. Some little fucking girls that I know. It goes like this. It's so easy for me to make enemies anymore it's sickening. People are looking for an excuse to jump on my shit list. Sticking their noses in shit that isn't none of their business. I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions. Now I'm in the position that. I don't wanna be in shit. I never had a beef with you corny son of a bitches. But now this shit is broke and you can't do nothing to fix it. So I'm telling you right now. Motherfucker Limp Bizkit. Now I'ma be real. B-Real was real. He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefing. See he chilled. He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral. I'da never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils. Peoples, whatever your backpacking cyphering name is. Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you say in it. I'da never involved you. But you had to add your two pennies. Now I gotta go grab my shit list and add some new enemies. Hit the studio and I'll admit I had a few in me. Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any. But let it be known. That song was never released, it leaked. I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally. Then I look on the TV. Now look who's mentioning me. That little fucking weasle, DJ Lethal, on MTV. After I gave you props on that song you on national TV. Talking 'bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me. Come on dog, you was supposed to be on that song. Talking 'bout how bad you hate him. Now you all on his thong. What's wrong, you scared, and Fred, you said you was dissing him too. I shoulda knew better than to listen to you. You fucking sissy. Up on stage screaming how people hate you. They don't hate you. They just think you're corny since Christina played you. And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back. That's a sissy act. And don't call me kissing my ass. Cuz I swear to God this ain't just a song. I'm trying to prewarn you. Lethal, when I fucking see you dogg, I'm swinging on you. Motherfuckers must think cuz I'm in trouble with the law. That I won't draw. Up my sentence and double it tomorrow. Y'all are some. Girls (y'all are some God damn girls). Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?). Why do y'all act like fucking sissies. You pussies keep talking shit behind my back. You just some bitches for that. And we all know (we all know, ha). How fucking cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin'). In fucking Bentleys. And pretend to be down. But as soon as someone calls you out. You put your tail between your legs and walk around. Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs. Or be involved in my beefs. I'm a man. I can stand on my feet. So if you don't wanna be in 'em. All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion. And I won't put you in 'em. Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs. Or be involved in my beefs. I'm a man. I can stand on my feet. So if you don't wanna be in 'em. All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion. And I won't put you in 'em. Now see if you diss me and I respond. The beef is on. But if I help you sell one record. And I see you at a show I'll strip you naked. See I was smart. I came back and scooped up my friends. Now I got five dogs that'll die for me like I'll die for them. I'll fight for them, swing or shoot, like I fight for Kim. All of them been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in. That goes for all of my dogs from Royce to Dre. From Xzibit to Melman. Till I'm hoist away. In my coffin. I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested. I never give a fuck. I won't ever be interested. Love me or hate me. As much as Fred wants to be hated. I will solemnly stand by every statement I've stated. The shit that I been through. My pencil never could pencil. But I won't ever be this gullible ever again, no. Next time I'll know when someone's copying off me. I'm not being cocky. I just know when somebody's mocking me. I stick up my middle finger. He sticks up his finger. I say fuck Christina. He says fuck Christina, but meaner. So from doing a song with Method. To begging to get accepted. I'm pegging Fred. With the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with. And as for Lethal don't forget what I said. I'm fucking you up punk. You're dead. Don't think that I'm playing. And fuck Bizkit. Cuz I know you're saying fuck D12. Only not to our face, under your breath, and to yourselves. Little. Girls (motherfucking females). Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?). Why do y'all act like fucking sissies. You pussies keep talking shit behind my back. You just some bitches for that. And we all know (now we all know the truth). How fucking cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin'). In fucking Bentleys. And pretend to be down. But as soon as someone calls you out. You put your tail between your legs and walk around. Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs.

All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion. And I won't put you in 'em. And that's it. That's all there is to it dog. If you don't wanna do the fucking song. Don't say you're down with doing the fucking song. And then back out at the last minute. And then go on motherfucking MTV. Talking about Everlast can whip my motherfucking ass. If you're scared of Whitey Ford dog. Just say you're scared of Whitey Ford. That's it. That's all you had to fucking say. I wouldn't a said shit. I woulda backed off. Did the motherfucking song myself. And not put you motherfuckers in it. That's all. Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more. I'm on some fucking you up shit when I see you. And I will see you, too. Oh, and by the way, Fred. That wasn't an accident. I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards. Ha ha."

good die young,"Good Die Young. [Intro- Kon Artis] Dawg, I shouldn't have left. They wouldn't have tried this shit if I was wit' ya. Maybe we would have picked another time, or maybe chose anotha way. Or maybe my prayers would have convinced him that choose another soul. Shit, it’s just me and my man Tony now. Man you look so peaceful right now...how can I argue with that. They say.... [Kon Artis - Chorus] They say that the good die young, that’s why I think that you should have fun (when your young). Cause time won't wait for no one, when God calls, you gotta go home. They say the good die young, (die young), that's why I know that we gon' have fun. In this life cause you only get one. When God calls for me, don't cry I just went home.. [Kon Artis] It's true that everybody heard, there mama say everyday's like this, when you see, one of your friends die in the mist. In the struggle, until the circumstances it's a risk that they take, just to prove a point to a friend. Even then, accidents are prone to happen to any man, or woman that's dumb enough to pretend. That her, God won't hold them accountable for sins. If they commit, and they try to repent themselves to repent. But I guess that’s just the way things go,. I was blessed to see 24. To wake up to that how ""My Name Is"" video, motivated me to write what I wrote. And I knew my little brother sold dope, and mom and daddy want to move off Ro'. I did it, I still got a lot to prove and show, I just wish we ain’t have to lose Bugz to the struggle Cause you know.... [Chorus]. [Bizarre] I know you used to Bizarre on some silly shit, but niggas in my clique is dying quick.. In Detroit, niggas don't party, they pull a fo-fo out, snatch off bacardis. That’s why I keep the pistol under the trunk, I'm 27 years old, too old to be gettin' jumped. And fuck rap, I miss Carnell Pitts, B-U-G-Z, tattered on my wrist. Me and you in the Jeep, listen to swing ol' beats, it's a shame me and Fuzz don't even speak. I got married, my wife name is Dee, peace to 31 and 51-50, I miss you.. [Kuniva] I remember back on that tragic day, my phone rung, and Bizarre's voice tellin' me, Bugz was gone home. It was like a knife piercing my chest and I couldn't breath, I didn't wanna accept it, didn't wanna believe it. And I swear with this weight dawg, I cried so hard literally, Denaun had to carry me to the car. While I stand in this booth now it’s tearin' me apart but I had to let it out cause it was tearin' at my heart. Cause he died over somethin so petty and so small, a human life is so very precious. I hope ya'll understand how I'm feelin' cause I love you Bugz. I wanna rhyme wit' you, laugh wit' you, hug you Bugz. But I can't and you was so close to seein' dreams,. a coward came along and took you away from the team. So don't mistake this track, it's just another song. This goes out to everyone who lost a loved one cause you know. .. [Chorus]. [Proof] They say it's never too late to have an early childhood, if I could turn back the hands of time, God should. Forgive what I did as a kid to run blocks, now my dreams are just screams, cops, and gun shots. The fun stops when your homie's up in a box, my dude E-Bole, rest his soul, snuffed by the cops. I use to quartion'(?) a lot, if there's a guy by me say somethin'. If you love her so much why didn't you gave nothin'? When he took my homie, Snook was only in 11th grade, now I hope to see your face at the heaven gates. It ain't never late in the game, this hatin' remains, with a grudge to see slugs break through my frame. My heart aches with the pain, the life in his breath, we gotta have fun now, there’s only minutes left. In the depth, distress young as a? Did to get? Off my fallen homies who ain't got enough years. I miss y'all.. [Chorus]. [Swifty] When I was younger I knew four brothers that wasn't wise. That crash and the driver died, my partner on the passenger side was paralyzed. And I'm surprised by the look of that ride that the other peeps survived. Nine months later another one died, somebody shot him in the side when he was startin' up his ride. 3 years go by, I made a hell of a run, and that’s when Funky got done, Joey playin' wit' guns, and Tookie over funds, Carty was my man, and Reggie, I wish that I was wit you in that van. And Bugz if it wasn't for you, you know I wouldn't be standin' in this booth. That’s the truth, I miss ya'll.... [Chorus x2]"
hellbound,"[Announcer]. Welcome back, to the stage of history. [Eminem]. Yo.. Slim Shady!. Yo.. I'll fuckin.. I'll... I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww). Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to. The only key that I see to defeat you. would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you. and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe. I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse. you'll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you. (Bitch!) I ain't no fuckin G, I'm a cannibal. I ain't tryin to shoot you,. I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you. Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass. and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress. Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!). Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis. I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket. to fill it full of explosive gasses. and close it back with a lit match in it. while I sit back and just hope it catches. Blow you to fragments. Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes. Chorus: J-Black (repeat 2X). I see the light at the end. But every time I take a step, it gets dim. Tell me is this hell we're livin in?. If so, heaven's got to be better. But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down. [J-Black]. Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church (never). I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse. I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc. Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot. One day we all gon' die. But when I die, I'ma be so high. that I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare. with the chalk outline still there. I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot. I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock. Now if I pray everynight (night). Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?. You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth. I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse. I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse. Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk. See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a North Face. Nickle nine at my waist, God done lost faith. Angels greet me but I don't reply back. Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?. Chorus 1/2. [Announcer]. Maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns. Final battle, fight!. [Masta Ace]. Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso. Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso. And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger. Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger. I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound. And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds. My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger. Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her. Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her. Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager. My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel. My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel. Everyday I grow more older, and more colder. Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder. I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare. Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care. Chorus. [J-Black]. But every time I take a step, it gets dim... Tell me is this hell we're livin in?. Haha... [Announcer]. Time's up!. You lose"

Like the boy scouts did up camp and hit more licks than stamps. I'm quick to crash, let the shottie blast. Grab the dolly and drag the bodies of niggaz that lolly gagged. Finish; you might as well climb in this body bag. so the E.M.S. won't waste time puttin your ass in it. (hey) I'm out cold like bums and frost bite in blizzards. Dirty Dozen be payin rappers, run freely, visit {*PUNCH*}. A big portion passed a normal artist with a deal (uh-huh). I'm heartless, comin outta battles scarless wit the skill. For real, I feel I was born to lyrically kill at will. Wit the power to sell wheel I'm killed (I'm serious!). Damn my man is ill, so don't you get caught. Kuniva, obliterate rappers with just a meare cough. I'm fierce, hungry on the prawl so you're aloud to run. before I drop the mic and jump in the crowd with a gun. {*PUNCH*} Shootin blind, hittin turntables and speakers.

hit me with your best shot,"Come on hit me with my best ... Come on hit me with my best ... Hit me with the best shot, hit me with the best shot,. Hit me with the best shot, hit me with the best shot,. Hit me with the best shot, hit me with the best shot.. Verse 1 [bizarre]:. Proof died, what happened? marshall stopped rappin'. I guess that makes me the captain,. Hit the matress, pistol packin'. Sick assassin, bitch to gassin', get to mashin'. D-12 broke up, were you bitches askin'. Our clique relaxin' in the hills of aspen, poppin' pills and aspirin. And I'm the machine that brought marshall back to life. Told him that my rhymes just have to be tight. So I figured that I would grab the mic. Like a nig*a 'bout to rhyme right after christ. Sometimes we get mad and fight, right back to the lab tonight. Grab an oath in the afterlife, that's only right. Living like a rock star is the only life. And we are, 6 grown men, who are old friends. My nig*a bugz, deshaun holton. All the way down, I'ma hold them, d-12 nig*a, 'till the world end. Chorus:. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot.. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot.. Come on hit me with my best,. Coke on hit me with my best. Come on hit me with my best. Verse 2 [swifty]:. A lotta nig*as try to underestimate me. 'till I come back with vengeance and slice their trachea. Y'all been placed on a contract for hatin'. I'ma waste 'em, one by one, for taintin'. Ability to kill a facility, I'm a sinner of satan. Fast as a child rapist facin'. Life or trifle, henny has made me in waitin'. They gon' lock me up under the basement. I'm a one man army, marine and navy. You done made me angry. I'm crazy, insane, and maybe. I bite the face off your baby. For anyone who try to diss proof or hailie. I'ma break their halo. Put 'em on the reaper's payroll, erase them and hang their soul. It ain't no hoes here, mcvay s got a scroll. With names on it, dipped in blood, man I'm cold. Chorus:. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot.. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot.. Come on hit me with my best,. Coke on hit me with my best. Come on hit me with my best. Verse 3 [kuniva]:. I know you thought we were done, we rose up. Got a gun to make your whole inside fold up. And hit us with the best shot and we're still standin'. So tell the world it can lick our scrotum. Straight soldiers, who wanna stunt. Who wanna be the fall guy, who want the punt. Who wanna get fucked for lookin' at me sideways. Every time I roll up I'ma keep it blunt. Where did y'all run when we almost lost marshall. Y'all did it big like costco. And we back in this bitch like a tampon. Still fuck dirty, em's clean like a bar o' soap. And you were so slick, on some baffoon shit. My hand's on a sweeper, your was on a broomstick. Stop lookin' all stupid, I'm rude and abusive. And strapped, don't make me use it. Chorus:. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot.. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot.. Come on hit me with my best,. Coke on hit me with my best. Come on hit me with my best. Verse 4 [eminem]:. Aight, here's where I come in at.... I came in this game with, bad intentions,. And I ain't budged, not even an inch since then. I'm stubborn, evil, and insensitive. I'm like nothing you ever seen, pencil in. Hand, it's like I'm holding the insulin,. So you might wanna button it like benjamin. I ain't frightened of nothing, I injure men. Step right in this mark with my henchmen and. Walk, straight to the stage,. I ain't here to cause trouble, get the fuck out my face. Fall back, little cocksucker, I ain't a&w. Don't get your cold mugs in my way. Get 'em? shattered, fuckin' a. Been this way since b.c., what can I say?. I'm stuck in my ways like double stick tape. Don't get turned to a vegetable dick face. You ain't superman, stay in your lane, lois. D-12 spittin' flames like flamethrowers. Spit 'til we get sprained jaws with metaphors. That cut with the same force as chainsaws. Hope you're coming with your a game,. 'cause things have changed in this game,. Isn't the same game, boys. The stakes have been raised, better make lemonade. When they give you lemons, if they want us, let 'em aim for us. Chorus:. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot.. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot,. Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot.. Come on hit me with my best,. Coke on hit me with my best. Come on hit me with my best"
how come,"(Eminem). [Intro]. So i chose, huh. You got a phone,. Pick it up and call me. [Chorus:]. How come, we don't even talk no more',. And you don't even call no more',. We don't barely keep in touch at all,. And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more',. And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,. After all the years we've been down,. Ain't no way, no how,. This bullshit can't be true,. We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's you. [Verse One]. What's up yall,. So full of life and vibrance,. Side by side wherever you was ridin’, I went,. So close or most us some Bonnie and Clyde shit,. When Ronnie died you was right by my side,. With a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes,. And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it,. You even had the same type of childhood I did,. Sometimes I just wanna know why,. Is it that you sur-came to yours,. And mine I survived it,. You ran the streets I nine to fived it,. We grew up, grew apart this time went by us,. Then I blew up to both yours and mine surprises,. Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it,. Much as your pride tries to hide it,. You're cold your touch is just like ice,. And your eyes is the look of resentment,. I can sense it and I don’t like it. [Chorus]. (Kon Artist). [Verse Two]. It was my dream at first to be all spittin the verse,. Sold my own album with a deal but shit got worse,. So I came out I would'a killed a nigga first,. 'Fore I let him disrespect me,. Or check me up with somethin' worse,. Some bitch that I wasn't with,. I would'a hit her to would'a quit,. But you were plain talkin' to her,. And tell her she was the shit,. I told you don't get involved with her,. You were smoking the cron'c with her,. Coming out'a the bar with her,. Stumblin' hands drunk,. Like Devil's husband or wife or somthin',. But me catchin' he fuckin' other nigga,. Must've hurt your pride or somthin',. 'Cause you wont fuck the mouth to people,. Like you want it with me,. When all I tried to do is show you that your bitch was shifty,. And lyrics is the fans and all the shit that I produce,. You actin' like I ain't your man,. And lyin' like she can't be loose,. But I am really your friend,. I'm just trying to tell you the truth,. Don't hit the game other playa',. The one that's changin is you. [Chorus]. (Proof). [Verse Three]. It's that you´re only at the top. cuz my homie had to stop. now we actin like i gotta live only for the block. and homies in the hood only see me on the tube. so they gossip on the porch, get ta speakin all rude. fools i used to rap with, all expect magic. like my finger get the ""snap"" and ""poof"" it just happen. but proof its just sackin', at the party were stoned. shady made it so my babys aint starvin at home. see the devil in your grin, since the ghetto we been friends. forever, real intelegience, thats forever till the end. I peep the hatred in your eyes and the Satan in your lie. aint wastin my time with these snakes in disguise. (How come) when you talk its with bitter respite. (And how come) its my fault for what you did with your life. and every time i go to hear you, you go play you look away. we barely embrace, you cant even look me in my face"

That's how people get fucked up. [Kuniva]. If you a loud mouth. Trying to wild out. And we see just how you laying. And we peep your style out. (You a punk). When you chilling out in front of your truck. And get stuck. That's how niggas get fucked up. [Proof]. No love at home with your infolks. And the world just keeps fucking with your mental. And all these kids making fun of your trench coat. That's how students get shot up. [Kon Artis]. Hating on us but you come to our show (Fuck them niggas). I crowd surf and you let me go. Oh no. Whip your ass when I get off the floor. Just so you know though. That's how haters get fucked up. [Swift]. When the police pull you over and shit and find ganja. Now every month they checking on your piss. They getting mad cuz you ain't come back since. And now they sweating you. That's how P.O.'s get fucked up. [Kuniva]. When your mans hooked you up with a bitch. Over the phone. And when you see her. She ugly as shit (God damn). Now at the end of the date she want a kiss. And some dick. That's how blind dates get fucked up. [Proof]. Say we got a real crew with a lot of skill. And only one nigga in our crew make the dollar bills. Y'all fools just mad cuz y'all ain't got a deal. Local rappers talk too much. [Kon Artis]. You don't like this pain. But you roll with punks. Manage to trip the alarm. And you all get stumped. Cops got AK's. Y'all only got pumps. That shit's just dumb. That's how cruzzie got locked up. [Swift]. When your ass wanna walk in the club. But 'stead of telling you to wait. The nigga wanna push and shove (move). They get trampled from the niggas you brought. So move over. That's how bouncers get fucked up. [Chorus x2]. [Kuniva]. When you get your guns outta the stash. And gather all your homies up. To go and shoot up a pad. Soon as you finished y'all run out of gas. You better haul ass. That's how drive-bys get fucked up. [Proof]. Mixing weed with the brew. Extacy and Kalu, gasoline fumes. Nitrous balloons. Acid tablets and magic mushrooms. That's how D12 get fucked up. [Kon Artis]. I like your records. But my album aint dropped. Dr. Dre's my favorite. Bitch get off his jock. Got a backstage pass and I need to get off. Wanna meet da-da-da Doc?. That's how groupies get tossed up. [Bizarre]. Drop outta school. Take drugs and molest sluts. Got your girlfriend sucking on my left nut. Your parents don't like me, but guess what (what). Cuz Bizarre don't give a fuck. [Kuniva]. Chokin' your wife all in front of your peeps. She toss a brick through the window of your Jeep. They back together by the end of the week. That's so sweet. Slim and Kim argue too much. [Proof]. Invite a ho to your house. While your bitch is out. Now you got the dick. All up in her fuckin mouth. Pull it out. And then you bust off on her favorite blouse. That's how Clinton got caught? up. [Kon Artis]. Steal cars, wreck bars, got fucked up beyond. Recognition, walk in 50? clubs like we stars. Our mission every day is just to smoke bongs and fuck bitches. That's how Runyan Ave. is cut. [Swift]. When your life wasn't raised up right. See your mother coming home. With different niggas every night. And then you run in to the one you don't like. So get the fuck off [shooting]. That's how step-dads get fucked up. Niggaz. Crackaz. Whiteys. Jews. This is how it happens to you. That's how people get fucked up. Niggaz. Crackaz. Whiteys. Jews. This is how it happens to you. That's how people get fucked up. Niggaz. Crackaz. Whiteys. Jews. This is how it happens to you. That's how people get fucked up. Niggaz. Crackaz. Whiteys. Jews. This is how it happens to you."
i remember,"Your Mother!. You fuckin faggot. There once was a man who liked to jump around. But he got too old to jump up and down. So he put down the mic and picked the guitar up. Started singin the blues like there was no tomorrow. Left his boys in the House Of Pain. It was the wisest decision he ever made. But the dumbest thing that he could ever do. Is try to pump a 380 at those that act shady. Tell me now what you gonna do. Cuz i remember all those years. How it was when you were here. I remember how it was. How it was when you were young. Yesterday was so long ago. Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along. Now nobody wanna here your old ass sing no more. I remember back when you had the knack. And I remember when you had your first heart attack. I was right there laughin when I heard the news. I just wish the cardiac would have murderered you. Maybe Ice-T is right you are a bitch. You come around when your broke. And leave when your rich. But the dumbest thing that he could ever do. Is try to pump a 380 at those who act shady. Tell me now what you gonna do. Cuz i remember all those years. How it was when you were here. I remember how it was. How it was when you were young. Yesterday was so long ago. Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along. Now nobody wanna here your old ass sing no more. Remeber back in 94 like right before Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford. Before his heart attack had him on life support. When House Of Pain was outta fame. Like some one douced the flame. And maybe they destined never to jump around again. Or ever further back when I first had heard the knack. And you were down with Syndicate. I went to get your shit man I was into it. But then you went and took your style and switched the shit. Now you sound rediculous. You dickless piece of shit how could you diss me bitch. I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude. Remember Sway and Tech when came up and sat beside you. Started rhymin then you left the room and didnt say goodbye or nuttin. Like you mad cuz some one else is white and tryin. rhyme or sumtin. Im sorry man I wasnt tryin to steal your light or. nuttin. But your a homo sexual white rappin irish ( ). Man I wish I was irish then I could be a ( ) too. Then I'd be confused as you. And I wouldnt know what to do. Wuts up with you, I never fucked wit you. Why would you fuck with me. Knowing I could rap circles around you. Wut you nutz as me. Plus I could sing better then you and I dont fuckin. sing. And probably play guitar better and I aint never. touched a string. But I aint mad at you I'd hate me to if I was you. Im what your used to be, shit you was me in 92. So ever time I right a lyric Im a think of you. And maybe that will help me know what its like to sing. the blues. Cuz i remember all those years. How it was when you were here. I remember how it was. How it was when you were young. Yesterday was so long ago. Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along. Now no one wanna here your old ass sing no more. Fuckin faggot sissy, fuck. And by the way 380's a fuckin sissy gun. You gunna shoot somebody use a fucking real gun. You little bitch, next time you use my name in a song. Dont be subliminal about it. You gunna fuckin diss me, diss me you fuckin faggot. Fuckin punk pussy, fucking little bitch"
i say yeah,"Alright...Yeah...(Alright).... I know that you know that I can't stop watching you. I feel it, believe me, I know you feel it too. Oh-oh-yeah. There's something about me that you don't know about. I'm someone that somehow you seem to be without. Is it so hard to see that I'm not invisible?. Feel like a fly on the wall. So if I get a little crazy. Look a little spacey. Blowing kisses your way. Will you think I'm OK?. Set the sun on fire. Scream a little higher. Hold you in the moonlight. I say yeah if you say alright. I might not be special, not like your superman. But living and loving, well that I super-can. It's not so complicated, not reinvent the wheel. Just let me know how you feel. So if I get a little crazy. Look a little spacey. Blowing kisses your way. Will you think I'm OK?. Set the sun on fire. Scream a little higher. Hold you in the moonlight. I say yeah if you say alright. Aha...Yeah.... You say alright (alright). Then I will say OK (OK). I will take your hand. And we can fly away (we can fly away). NO matter where we go. You will always hear me say, yeah.... Woh-oh oh...(I say yeah)...Ho-oh-woh. Baby...(alright)...Alright. So if I get a little crazy. Look a little spacey.

Hold you in the moonlight. I say yeah if you say alright"

I'd love for you to stay but I got another date,. with a fat chick that eat cake on playskates.. She rubbed my funky ass feet and feed me grace. plus my man in the closet ran out of videotape.. [Chorus]. [Swift]. I'ma make this one thing clear,. ain't no woman hear gon' ruin my career.. All the hell you doin' is pursuin' a dream,. that's when you find out that life ain't truly what it seems.. All these hoes be lyin', bullshittin' each other.. And why the hell Kobe Bryant didn't wear a rubber.. He might as well have went and told the hoe that he love her.. I'm sure as hell ain't gonna go to court for my mother,. or my wife, and my sisters. So motherfuck a mistress.. They signin' a contract before these bitches hit this.. Never will a woman take me out that way.. I keep a RCA camera in there motherfuckin' face.. [Chorus]. [Bizarre]. What's your name again It doesn't matter.. My name is Bizzy, a bodygaurd for Mr. Mathers.. Sit down girl. Let me get you a drink.. I'ma buy you a mink, and rape you in the sink.. From day one, I knew you was a hoe.. I put a rubber on my toe and fucked you some mo'.. Turn around, let me see your nasty ass.. Put on a Jason mask while I take off your maxi pads.. [Kuniva].

infinite,"Aw yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass. One time for your motherfucking mind, we represent the 313. You know what I'm saying?. 'Cause they don't know shit about this. For the 9-6. Aiyo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction. To get your brain relaxin', a zany-actin' maniac in action. A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction. You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun. My rhyming skills got you climbing hills. I travel through your mind until you spine like siren drills. I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants. With some ex rappers till their spinal column disconnects. Put this in your decks and then check the monologue, turn your system up. Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog. This is the season for noise pollution contamination. Examination of more cartoons than animation. My lamination of narration. Hit's a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation. When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing. I turn the stage into a barren wasteland. I'm Infinite. CHORUS. You heard of hell well I was sent from it. I went to it servin' a sentence for murdering instruments. Now I'm trying to repent from it. But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it. I'm Infinite. Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense of your elite defense. I got some meat to mince. A crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse. I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans. I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans. My coiled hands around this microphone is lethal. One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people. MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium. Battle a band of phony MC's and stand a lonely one. Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator. There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus. Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases. My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces. My acapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis. That eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally. With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite. Chorus. Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since. My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O. So I'm assuming all responsibility. 'cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's. Mic Nestler, slamming like a wrestler. Here to make a mess of a lyric-smuggling embezzler. No one is speacialer. My skill is intergalactical. I get cynical at a fool then I send a crew back to school. I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical. I'd rather let a tactical, tactful, track tickle your fancy. In fact I can't see, or can't imagine. A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'. So this is for my family, the kid who had a cammy on my last jam. Plus the man who never had a plan B. Be all you can be, 'cause once you make an instant hit. I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit. I'm Infinite. Chorus 2x"
instigator,"I'm an instigator. [Chorus]. I'm an instigator. Nigga can't you see. I'm an instigator. Ain't nobody worse than me. I'm an instigator. I be the first to beef. First to squeeze. Take heed to the words I speak. I'm an instigator. Nigga can't you see. I'm an instigator. Ain't nobody worse than me. I'm an instigator. I be the first to beef. First to squeeze. Till it hurts to breathe. Fuck with me. [Kuniva]. I love getting shit started. I instigate a peace talk into a beef talk. Until police need chalk to chalk you up. Have bitches walking up. Smacking you in your face screaming that you talk too much. Tell women you said you fucked 'em. Tell the hardest nigga you said you snuck him. Raid his pockets and stuck him. Till they gather in front of your crib. Guns and ??? clips. Laughing when they shoot at you over the wrong shit. I lock down your block with lies. It's so believable. You run and grab your shotguns, glocks, and nines. Walking blind. Incite fights until they erupt. Instigate my own death cuz killing you ain't enough. [Swifty]. I don't give a fuck if we beefing or not. I squeeze first. I'ma heat up your spot. I'm a nigga that breathe dirt. On these streets everyday. Snatching nigga's lle'. How you bitches needing work?. You can get it from McVeigh. I'm despiteful. I tie a hoe. A maniacal vile animal. Liable to leave you strapped with your Bible. I'm psycho. My bullets won't fly by you. You wanna kill me?. You got the right to. Ain't gotta wait till night to snipe you. If I don't like you. You getting hit in broad day light with a white rifle. In front of your window I'm looking right through. I love when I see a nigga get stuck. [Chorus]. I'm an instigator. Nigga can't you see. I'm an instigator. Ain't nobody worse than me. I'm an instigator. I be the first to beef. First to squeeze.

Till it hurts to breathe. Fuck with me. [Kon Artis]. (I'm an instigator). Drama tends to follow me. I know. I probably owe all of my friends apologies. Lie to every bitch just to get her to swallow me. Get a labotomy?. Nigga this runs to my artery. Guns are a part of me. I pack more than pottery. I oughtta be jailed for depicted mockery. Ain't gon' fight. The blood on the niggas that shot at me. I don't twist the truth. I just make it gothic, see?. I'm nothing but a liar. With a big ass mouth, dick, and fists. Big enough to knock your bitch ass out. Got no reason to tell you the truth. But to be honest with you. I rap with him. But I don't like Proof. [Proof]. Nigga fuck you. Me and Swift got plans to jump you. Type of nigga to shake your hand and stomp you. (I'm an instigator). Convinced a tenth grader. To run up inside his classroom. And leave the kids sprayed up. Bitch straight up. This is the season for squeezing off triggers. On niggas for no reason. Either jump or quit running your mouth. Pull a gun out. Better use it till the bullets run out. [Chorus]. I'm an instigator. Nigga can't you see. I'm an instigator. Ain't nobody worse than me. I'm an instigator. I be the first to beef. First to squeeze. Take heed to the words I speak. I'm an instigator. Nigga can't you see. I'm an instigator. Ain't nobody worse than me. I'm an instigator. I be the first to beef. First to squeeze. Till it hurts to breathe. Fuck with me. [Swifty]. I throw a brick at your crib. Having you standing on the porch screaming. (Look what you did!!). I ain't feeling no remorse. Nigga just pick up the kids. Swift got first dibs. On these cherry hot slugs. That'll barbeque your ribs. I'm preparing death beds. Quick to bust lead. While I'm staring at the feds. Tearing off their legs. Once you drop dead. They'll be swearing it's a plague. I'm sicker than a ???????. watch the ???????? with dreds. You could shake if you move. Ditch with no clue. Don't put shit on your tape. With your skits and interludes. And once I finish you. They wouldn't put it in the news. I'm nuts so you hoes ain't got the guts to interview. [Chorus]. I'm an instigator. Nigga can't you see. I'm an instigator. Ain't nobody worse than me. I'm an instigator. I be the first to beef. First to squeeze. Take heed to the words I speak. I'm an instigator. Nigga can't you see. I'm an instigator. Ain't nobody worse than me. I'm an instigator. I be the first to beef. First to squeeze. Till it hurts to breathe. Fuck with me. I'm an instigator."
it's ok,"[Eye-Kyu] Check it out. [Eminem] Hey Kyu!. CHORUS 2x [Eye-Kyu]. It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok). I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright).

I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried. Till I'm glad to be buried. And leave this crazy world. And have at least a half a million for my baby girl. It may be early to be planning this stuff. 'cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough. 'cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough. I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed. My hands have been cuffed. But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff. Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts. I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough. And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see. My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased. With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese. I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call. Way before my baby is able to crawl. I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates. To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades. I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth. Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q. Chorus. Verse 2 [Eminem]. I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps. Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep. Praying for sleep. Dreaming with a watering mouth. Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse. In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts. With the root of all evil. I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful. And make them do shit illegal. For these Grant's and Jackson's. These transactions explain a man's actions. But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity. Through God and there's a wish he granted me. He showed me how to cope with the stress. And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed. Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest. To selling dope with the rest. I quit smoking cess to open my chest. Life is stressful inside this cesspool. Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel. My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics. He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts. Kids attract static, children with automatics. Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets. I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum. I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum. It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth. But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth. Chorus. Uh, it's ok, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep. Uh yeah, it's ok, it's alright, I can't sleep"

lies & rumors,"CHORUS:. They say that one little lie turns into another. Then you go and cheat. By the time you know it, you all wrapped up in a whole bunch of seaweed.

No, no, no, no, no, no no no….. Now this thing here, No cause concern, but. It’s just another story about a shark eating worms. It’s not a riddle, but subliminally catches on. How one little lie can turn into a bigger one. When I was a young guppy in the sea. You could see all the bigger fish picking on me. ‘Cause they knew I didn’t really have the guard or bullet. And the other sharks that have teeth sharper than me. I’m a never-ending story about a shark this big. The load of kids that got an act for fizz. So sit back, kick back with a bag of chips. While I tell you ‘bout something stupid I did…. CHORUS. I’m off to work but I’m late [hey] But what can I say? [hey]. I’m cool with the boss and of course it’s a payday. We reachin’ the weekend and I’ll be treatin’ my baby. Typical day, dude’s in the way – But hey wait!. Shark’s in the water. Gotta duck in the corner ‘til I’m caught.

So my tentacles should give him just what he deserves.. So you better swim fast ‘cause I’m after ya. And go and hide inside the mouth of a clam or somethin’.. Cause I’m out and about. I’m bad news.. A henchman - a jellyfish with an attitude. So listen.. Swim for your life ‘cause I’m on your tail. So frightenin’ I scare a snail outta it’s shell.. CHORUS. I love this liquid. I’m silly when I’m in it and I bet. [This water we’re standing in is wet. Duh….]. What do you expect from me?. I’m a platinum Jack Dempsey. Trying to get a fee.. And everybody know that I’m the G of the sea.. I just knocked this shark off. The dude tried to eat me.. I guess he didn’t like me. It might be because I’m a Pisces.. They always try to take me lightly. So why the trouble?. I just wanna hustle and multiply bubbles and pump my muscles.. I don’t want to make a mistake ‘cause these fishermen will set you up. And I ain’t fallin’ for the bait. Daddy – what are we gonna do with a fish with a tattoo?. We’re gonna eat him. What do you think?. I’m a lion fish with dreams of making it big.. House in the ocean, three ugly kids.. And why everybody keep on picking on me?. I’m the sexiest, prettiest fish in the sea.. Heck no. I ain’t nobody dish. Cause I’m in love with Angie – the beautiful angelfish. [kissing sound]. Give me a kiss baby. I’m running from the white shark. You are trying to make me crazy.. CHORUS"

Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number. I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said ""Hey Bitch... Haven't I seen you before?"", looked at my nigga. Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands. And said ""Oh it's like that?"". She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit. She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit. She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number. She asked could I give her mine two. Got to the crib and called her up. We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck. I said ""Maxine check this out,. Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out"". Got to the crib she let me in. She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom. I said ""Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things"". What the fuck are you doing?. So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing. As she went for my midsection. I threw her down as I tore off her shirt. Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work. Before I hit it she said. ""3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass"". I said ""What is it, another nigga? It's ok"". She said ""No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS"". I got up out. [Kon:] Hey, Maxine. [Maxine:] What. [Kon:] You thinking about sucking my dick?. [Maxine:] Yeah for a small price. [Kon:] For a small price? What you mean?.

This dude in front of me, he weighs a brick. He's quick and I can't get Marshall hit. So I played my position and don't make a ???. Been doin' this for years, my team can't lose. And ain't nobody, ain't nobody hard. 9 O'clock, I'm gonna punch me a ???. Hut one, hut two, I'm ready. Hike, give the ball to Nelly. And nobody out there feels me. Take this 'fore you have to kill me. And any player in my way, I'm foldin'. Damn it, call: holdin'. Chorus. [Eminem]. Football, football, I love football. Yes, tres, dos, uno. Dos, tres, fuck, shit, bitch, asshole, son of a bitch. Everybody cuddle, blah I mean huddle. I just stepped in a mud puddle, butthole. Freak, who just tapped on my ass cheek. Nevermind, let's try quarterback sneak. Cover me, smother me with love that's brotherly. That didn't work, try another play. Hut one, hut two, hut hut hurry up. I'm reachin' up another grown man's butt. Hike the ball, I mean I like Bizarre. But Jesus yikes, I think I can feel his balls. My dick is long as it is hard, yeah so are my balls. It's the longest yard, whoops that's not the chorus. Run it back, wrong song, yeah disregard. That whole statement I just made, what yard line we on?. On 5 and our timeouts are gone. Less than a minute left, I just throw my ball. To the sideline to Von, he steps outta bounds. 48 seconds left on the clock but every last one counts. Call another huddle, we're down by six. The plan is, to throw the ball to Swift. But he's so god dang high, that he's trips. Falls and slips, Proof grabs him by his fingertips. And runs the ball all the way down to the one. But he don't get in, but all we need is a put ???. But all we need is a touch down and an extra point to win. But then I get sacked all the way back to the ten. God dammit I'ma slap somebody if I get tapped on the ass again. Everybody's laughin' now, no timeouts and it's now fourth now. We're never gonna make it, wait I just got an idea. Quick, everybody get naked, Denaun go long. I'ma throw the bomb, come on, how they gonna tackle you wit no pants on?. Ass out with a floppin' schlong, touch down yeah I told ya. It's the longest yard. Chorus. [Kuniva]. The new face on the yard, just hand me the ball. I'ma run through all of y'all, y'all just soft. Even though my cleats is kickin' up mud. It's more tragic for me, I'm stiff armin' punks. High steppin' through the end zone. I been grown, I'm so dirty you don't even know my skin tone. It's time to rumble, no time to fumble. And I won't stumble, your frontline will tumble. Playin' ball with killas, my team's gorillas. Three time offenders, even drug dealers. One of the best runnin' backs there never was. Movin' like Barry Sanders, leavin' you in the dust. [Proof]. Yack is high, I got the highest yack. Hit the ground so hard I leave tire tracks. Bizarre snaps like a fire crack. And my palm more stickier than spider back. Eyin' my eye, ???? try and sack us. No matter how big they flyin' backwards. Wide receiver, receiving' wide. For every stride in my life, I breathe and die. [Kon Artis]. Defense is playin' a pass. Then the quarterback peeps and screams. That means that it's time for me. to run out the back like a bat straight outta hell. My tracks burn turf when they excel. I try to lateral pass the ball to Proof. He got dropped and the ball came loose. and shot up like a flare, I gave the ball a stare. And use my lineman's shoulder as a chair. Now I'm flyin' through the air like a superhero. I can use this ??? for a box of cereal. I'm no joke punk, I can ???. For bein' the best player on my team WHAT. As soon as I hear the hut 1, 2, HUT. I do one run, run, the screen go run run. Then I cut, spin around in the end zone (Touch down!). Then I do the ninety shuffle so. Chorus. [Eminem] Footballs, I'm talkin' about footballs dude. BuNNy_SsHady* - eu_e_eminem@hot..."
my band,"[Eminem]. I don't know dude. I think everybody's all jealous and shit. 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude. And I think everybody's got a fuckin' problem with me dude. And they need to take it up with me after the show. Because.... Chorus [Eminem]. These chickys. don't even know the name of my band. But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands. 'cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man. All because I'm the lead singer of my band. [Eminem]. So I get off stage right, drop the mic. Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like. ""What's up ladies, my name's Slim Shady. I'm the lead singer in D-12 baby"". They're all like ""Oh my God it's him"". ""Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem"". ""I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock"". ""Please won't you please let me suck your cock"". And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous. Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas. All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes. Throw their bras and their shirts and the panties on stage. So like every single night they pick a fight with me. But when we fight it's kinda like siblin' rivalry. 'cause they're back on stage the next night with me. ""Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me"". Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me. 'cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be. This rock star shit, it's the life for me. And all the other guys just despise me because. Chorus. My band (9x). [Swifty]. You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you?. Hey dad how come we don't rap on proto. Smash these vocals and do a performance. But we in the van and he in a tour bus. You don't want my autograph, you's a liar. And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva). And what the hell is wrong with that dressing room. 'cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal. See I know how to rap, it's simple but. all I did was read a Russell Simmons book. So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map. Doin' jumpin' jacks while get whipped on my back. [Kuniva] Look him little punk ass thinkin' he the shit. [Kon Artis] Yeah I know man find himself takin' on a flick. [Kuniva] Hey I thought we had an interview with Dj Clue. [Eminem] No! I had an interview, not you two. [Kuniva] You gonna be late for soundcheck. [Kon Artis] Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck. [Kuniva] But our mics are screwed up. [Kon Artis] And his always sound best. You know what man I'ma say somethin'. [Kuniva] Aiyo Em (You got somethin' to say?!). [Kon Artis] Man no. [Kuniva] I thought you 'bout to tell him off, man what's up. [Kon Artis] Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up. And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew. [Kuniva] Man I was 'bout to talk right after you I swear, I. swear man. Chorus. [Proof]. They say the lead singer's rock, but the group is not. Once we sold out arenas to the amusement parks. I'ma go let the world know that Proof is hot. I should cut his mic off when the music starts. Ready to snap on a dumbass fan. Every time I hear... (Hey dude I love your band!). We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments. So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent. And these guys they can find every area code (Proof carry my. bag). Bitch carry your own. Can't make it to the stage, security in my way. (Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!). [Bizarre]. God damn it I'm sick of this group. Time for me to go solo and make some loop. I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps. Till Kon Artis, slipped me some crack. Lose Yourself video, I was in the back. Superman video, I was in the back. Fuck the media, I got some suggestions. Fuck Marshall, ask us a question. Like who's D-12, how we get started (But what about Eminem?). Bitch, are you retarded?. Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group. Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (Hey sexy). Then he told me to do sit-ups to get buff. I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up. Fuck D-12, I'm outta this band. I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne. [Eminem]. Girl why can't you see you're the only one for me. and it just tares my ass apart to know that you don't know my. name. [Bizarre]. These chicks don't even know the name of my band (haha). But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck. Marshall). 'cause once I blow I know that I'll be the man (yeah). All because I'm the lead singer.... [Eminem] My band (9x). [Bizarre] (In background). The hottest boy band in the world. D12!. [Eminem] (as a salsa singer). I'm the lead singer of my band. I get all the girl's to take off their underpants. And the lead singer of my band, my salsa. Makes all the pretty girl's want to dance. My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called ""My Salsa"". My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa. My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance. And take off their underpants. My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance. And take off their underpants, my salsa. Where'd everybody go?"

""Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance. There's a girl upstairs talkin to plants. choppin her hair off, and there's only two days left. of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off?"".

my words are weapons,"[Chorus x 2]. My words are weapons. (I use em to crush my opponents). My words are weapons. (Never show no emotion). My words are weapons. (I use em to kill whoever steppin to me). My words are like weaponry on a record. [Eminem]. The rage I release on a page is like a demon unleashed in a cage. Lunatic, Soon as I hit the stage. My mind is like a fuckin stick of dynamite. Once I get behind tha mic its like the wick is lit you bitches die tonight. My nine is like a guiding light at night shinin' bright. My fuckin grip is tighter then my wife's vagina SIKE. These cocksuckin cocks. Got my Smith and Wesson. I guess its time to pick a different weapon man that shits depressin. But Swift is gettin me a new one for a Christmas present. [Swift] - Come on Slim lets go teach this fuckin bitch a lesson. They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish. But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage. Shady stay creative baby hold your head up don't u let up. One bit on these motherfuckin suckers you a soldier get up. Stand up for what you believe in as long as u breathin. They jealous of you man that's the only reason they beefin'. [Chorus x 2]. [Swift]. Its that Dirty Dozen renegade. You done pulled the pin on my grenade. 38's will move your shit up out the way. You niggas wont forget about McVay. You got sumtin to say let it out today. And watch these bullets spray. From these ten black fingers huggin these deadly millimeters. That will make Jeff Dahmers look like he caught a misdemeanor. See I'm dirty so I ain't gotta to buy pistol cleaner. An official beater don't let me see you with your heater. You get swift with it. Tell that mutherfucker Swift did it. You packing sumtin special in your crib then bitch get it. I'm physically fitted to run your digits. I'm hostile with this roscal pointed up your nostrils. You get splitted and guess what I'm blowin up the hospital.

I'm eating crews like I'm Hannibal. There's no way I could be the gay rapper. (Em - Why Not?). I only fuck animals. Stupid Trick got my dick starting to itch. Went to my mothers grave site and called her a stupid bitch. One on one in this blood sport. I'm in divorce court. Suin' my bitch off a pack of Newports. 6 times I've been arrested. How would you feel if you let your ho witness that always got molested. I'm smokin dank drinkin drink. I cant have any kids cuz I'm fuckin shooting blanks. Don't you know Bizarre don't give a fuck. Nicole's a whore and I'm glad O.J murdered his slut. Responsibility I'm negligent. Bill Clintons a fag should be stabbed. Let Richard Simmons be the president. Call me a weirdo. Call me bazeer."
nasty mind,"Stop. You want me to do what?. What are those?. You want me to stick those in what?. [Chorus: Bizarre]. What is on your nasty mind?. (Nasty mind, nasty mind). Don't you wanna get fucked from behind?. (From behind, from behind). They treat me like a dirty slave. (Dirty slave, dirty slave). And beat me like I won't behave. I just wanna get freaky baby. [Swift]. I'm to Swift on my toes. To get caught up with you hoes. You don't know me (uh huh). See I ain't gotta front to play the role (for real). I'm a Know-G. I know when you're being phony. See you're probably boning them officers. Just to pull up on me (slut). That's why sixty percent of women is lonely (uh huh). They getting my mix only. They trying to creep slowly because they nosy. I ain't listen to what my momma told me. I fuck 'em and pass 'em to my homies (right). Then he fuck 'em and pass 'em to the homies (take her). I'm a nasty ass macaroni. You flashing fast money. You can pass the Roley. Fuck a alimony (bitch). If you want me. And ain't out screaming about your monthly. I'll be sticking your pretty ass until you turn ugly (damn). You suddenly see stars when fucking me. Ain't no ménage. It's I-want-'em-in-threes. Release your garments (trick). It ain't even me to hold back. I'll fuck your moms quick. Have her running around this bitch screaming. ""That's my dick!!"". [Kuniva]. Yo, I know I'm dogmatic. But your pussy walls have had it (that's right). It's evident that you been fucking like a jackrabbit. But I stay focused (bitch). So I acted like I didn't notice. And fucked her with no baby lotion. And bust in the soap dish. Hoe you can quote this. Your breath is smelling like. You done sucked a senior citizen's old dick. Go spit (damn). You gon' get chocked quick. Talking all that hoe shit. All agressive asking for a slow kiss. No bitch (get the fuck outta here). You like freaking. See you every night creeping. Sucking off the nice deacons. Slut you made his wife leave him (cunt). So keep slurping. I'll be down to the fullest. But forget it bitch. Your nipples look like AK bullets (I'm out). Chorus. [Kon Artis]. Yo, I'm tearing down whatever you built. Your marriage is through. Cuz I answered your wife's door naked. Wrapped in a quilt. Hoes say,. ""Kon Artis got a dick so big"". Man, I could persuade any bitch. To have eight of my kids. Shit, bitch. I should be locked up. For having honies' legs cocked up. In the back of my pop's truck. I'm not fucked up. I just got a fetish for shooting. Cumm in coochie. Till the pussy is booting it back out. I 69'd this one bitch and she bled in my mouth (shit). Kicked her out. Cleaned the couch out. And beat up my crouch. I don't gotta creep in motels. I cheat at my house. See I'm a dog. I don't need to keep a secret hide out (naw). [Bizarre]. All night I been snorting. Your age and where you're from. Is just not important (naw). You look like one of my mistresses. On welfare, ten kids like the rest of my bitches. Dreams of fucking a handicapped bitch. Suck my dick while your teeth start to grit (whore). Inner slave, that's how I want you to treat me. I ain't into S&M. But I love when you beat me. I told you I was a horny ass freak. While I'm beating my meat. Your daughter acting like she asleep (ya right). My love is like thunder and lightning. After it's over. I'm looking like I got my ass kicked by Tyson. Chorus. I just wanna get freaky baby (repeat)."

No one, no one is iller than me. No one is iller than me. It's Mr. Swifty from the 313.... I make rappers wanna turn into singers. I keep hoes lickin' they fingers. Bring this competition and face this meanin'. Got your whole crew doing subpeonas. Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius. Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters. Keep it close, you can't beat us. While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this. I done made quadrapalegics outta these non-rappin rejects. While the whole world ejects your tape, it ain't no secret. That your shit sounds fake, you can't stop it my mind state. Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate. I'm like Two-Face, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell. From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like route canals. I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail. Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well. Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linkin' trials. Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels. Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now. Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?. I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild. Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW!. It's Swifty from the 313. Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh!. [Bizarre]. Me and Eminem and Mike. Drivin' down Van Dyke.

Last week this old man I had to blast. Cuz he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas. Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook. Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook. Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack. Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at. I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should. This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good!. Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route. Throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell ""EVERYBODY GET OUT""!. My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece. Cuz she found out I was havin' an affair with her 10-year old niece. No one, no one's iller than me. It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313. No one, no one is iller than me. It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313. [Eminem]. Nobody better test me, cuz I don't wanna get messy. Especially when I step inside this bitch, dick freshly. New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs. Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs. True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs. Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs. Down a fifth, crack open a six. I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss. I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends. Who gives a fuck who they was. I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does. They probably don't be packin' anyways, do they Fuzz?. We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz. Mics get sandblasted. Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid. Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it. Fuckin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket. Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted. Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic. Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic. Furious four motherfuckers. Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters. Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me. [Fuzz]. I run shit like an ass with legs. Massive lead to leave your cabbage red. Similar to your ass in a casket dead. Drastic spread of acid heads. Come to abort you like a bastard egg. That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs. Ask the feds from past the edge. Rockin' the most classic threads. Flashin' bread, roll down the window. Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red. You can get 'til that ass get red. Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him. I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem. Never writer's block, I block writers. My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters. Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick. Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK!. And got drop kicked, now she screamin' ""Stop it..."". Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit. Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick. Sick a-ya'll niggaz lookin' at me like I got tits. I shoot a rocket through your optic. You niggaz still don't know the top pick?. I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass. And have you shittin' socks bitch!. We rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split. Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits. (No one...). Ain't nobody iller than me. [Bizarre].

I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at. Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wilin'. Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin'. This chick is clingin' onto me sobbin' and sighin'. Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'. But it's real and cats is gettin' killed. So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield. And she got hit now she yellin' (""Don't leave me!""). I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me. I squeezed through the back door and made my escape. I ran and got my 38 I hope it's not to late. Chorus. [Swifty]. (I been tryna call you all day mothafucka where you at?). I'm on seven mile, what the fuck was that?. Damn somebody hit me from the back (With they car?). With a gat nigga and my tire flattened. I just hit a pole, them niggas some ho's (Is you hit?). I don't know but I can tell you what they drove. It was a black Mitsubishi. (Shit that's the clique we beefin' wit' I swear). Maaan, and I was on my way there. Believe me I'm leavin' a carcass today. And I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way. I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tuck. I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up. Chorus. [Eminem]. I never seen no shit like this is my life before. People will still camp out from the night before. Sleepin' outside the door waitin' in line. still tryna get inside the club to see D-12 perform. The fire Marshals know, the venue's too small. People are wall-to-wall three thousand and some odd fans. and some come walk from out the parkin' lot. Get into an argument over a parkin' spot. This guy's about to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off. Missed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door in a St. Andrew's hall. Not a stray slidin' all over the place. Sprays one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall. Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off. I'm posted up by the bar havin' a Mozeltoff. Bullet whizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off. Thank God I'm alive I gotta find Denaun. And where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on him. Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre. Nah I guess not, what the fuck, oh my God it was. I never saw him run so fast in my life. Look at him haulin' ass, I think he left his wife. There she is on the ground bein' trampled. I go to grab her up by the damn hand and I can't pull her. God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit. My vest is barely able to handle it, it's to thin. If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep. Follow Bizarre's path and ran through it. And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps. Looked up and I seen Swift, shootin' it out. But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with. But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth. Chorus. [Kon Artis]. It's Friday night came to this bitch right. Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right. I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight. Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm poppin' niggas tonight. That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge. Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in. Swift told me to meet him here. So it's clear that this fucka shot out the back of his truck goes up in this mothafucka. So one shot for the money, two's to stop the show. Third's for the bartender, there's plenty of shots to go. (I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsubishi). He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit' a three piece. Chorus"

So who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to. When someone runs up with a mask and puts a gun to you [gun cocks]. You will ask youself, how come your mans. didn't enter that last round that he had in Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance. You keep askin us to keep it on wax but we can't. This is past any irrationalization. We have captured national media attention. Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension start buildin. soon as we enter the '106th & Park' building. Someone's gonna get killed and I swear to God. if someone so much as even touches one of my people. I'll put a million on his head. And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it. But I'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit. And it ain't because I'm a bitch. It's because I ain't a bitch, I don't endanger people that I'm with. I'm a general, I ain't Bush, I don't send my soldiers to war. I'm right there in the middle of the shit with 'em, so when I do get 'em. Orders to storm your headquarters, you'll be fuckin with a ...

Starve ya, get it crackin, yankin bitches for they ganja. Sneaky as fuck, I don't think mama beat me enough. When she was sleepin stuff, I was stealin the keys to the truck. Shut the fuck up, before you end up dead in the dump truck. Or in the streets takin a nap, bleedin and Lugged up. Who Want What like M. Bleek, with this heat if you ten deep. Then fuck it, it will be ten sleepin [gunshots]. [Proof]. Know much about my a land ski. Don't tustle with my hand speed. Clutch your burner, bust it and watch your man bleed.

No okey-doke, I'm packin my nose with soap. {*cough cough cough*} Am I supposed to choke?. Had an accident when the Trojan broke. Aww, poor baby, born by [whore] lady. Now I'm payin child support..

quitter,"Yo, I dedicate this, to yo.... To all my fans, keeping y'all in health. Let's tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself. Cuz its cruel when you cause a bad heart condition-in. Which I create, cuz that's my mission. So listen close, to what we say, Because.... This type of fag claims that every gay. I, knew you was jealous from the day that I met you. I upset you, cuz I get respect I bet you. I'm even liked better by your neice and nephew. Now you hate Fred because leathal left you. Peckerwood mad cuz his record went wood. No respect in the hood, led to his neck of the woods. Got in touch with his roots, found a redneck in his blood. And said, ""Heck, country western rap records are good!"". So he picks a guitar up and he strums a few notes. He can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both. Puts an album out, and rules for part of the year. Then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere. It's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year. No one's tryin to hear some fuckin old fart in a chair. Sittin on stage, strummin acoustic guitar in your ear. So you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idear. Figured you can diss me to jump start your career. I'll punch you in your fuckin chest til your heart kicks in gear. Fuck the underground partys, names, his crew. Like I'ma say their names so they can be famous too. [Chorus]. You just a.... Quitter and you bitter cuz I came along. And your days of house of pain are gone. If you talk about my little girl in a song again. I'ma kill you (I'ma kill you). You just a.... Quitter and you bitter cuz I came along. And your days of house of pain are gone. If you talk about my little girl in a song again. I'ma kill you (I'ma kill you). Heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke. To the rap you wrote your fuckin answer back's a joke. And I'm gonna tell these motherfuckin fans the truth. The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you. You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you. Like I ain't notice you, bitch, I had a show to do. Like I'm supposed to be starstruck, come over to you. You better shut your fuckin mouth while you 0 for 2. Back in 94 limp opened a show for you. Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you. Took your motherfuckin DJ and stole him too. So you fall in a slump and get all emotional. So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings. Confused as fuck cuz now your music sucks dick. Mister Mister ass kisser to get accepted in rap. Quicker but never last and Everlast is a.... Quitter and you bitter cuz I came along. And your days of house of pain are gone. If you talk about my little girl in a song again. I'ma kill you (I'ma kill you). You just a.... Quitter and you bitter cuz I came along. And your days of house of pain are gone. If you talk about my little girl in a song again. I'ma kill you (I'ma kill you). Aiight look.... So this is what we ask of our fans. If you ever see Everlast, whoop his ass. Hit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him. Kick him, spit on him, treat him like a hoe, bitchslap him. Do it for me, do it for Fred, do it for Limp. Do it for Rock, do it for Rap, do it for Ken. Do it for Ice T, do it just to do it, FUCK IT. He's a bitch, he ain't gonna hit you back, he's nothin. Shit, in five years, we're all gonna be eating at Whitey's. And he'll be busin tables in that bitch, cleaning the toilets. Hey yo.... [Eminem speaks]. Fuck this, cut this shit off. Hey yo, Head.. That's why I fucked your mother, you fat motherfucker. [Scratching/2 Pac's ""Hit 'Em Up""]. Kill Whitey, HAHAHA Kill Whitey, DETROIT, WHAT WHAT!. Yo, Yo, look, look, Kill Whitey. First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say. Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay. You claim to be a muslum, but you Irish-White. So fuck you, fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight. Plus I cut you in the chest, weak hearts I rip. Whitey Ford, Forty and White, lethargic ass dick head. I keep em comin while you runnin out of breath. Steady duckin while I'm punchin at your chest, you need to rest. Dialated go ask your people how I leave ya. With your three cds nobody sees, when they released. Evidence, don't fuck around with real emcees. Who ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks. I let you faggots know it's on for life. But Everlast might die tonight, HAHA. Fat boy murdered on wax and killed. Fuck with me and take a heart pill, YOU KNOW!. [Eminem/Chorus]. Grab 380s when you see Slim Shady. Call the doctor to heal your heart. They shocked you back to life at the clinic. But you bout to get relapsed any minute, honkey I hit 'em up. [Eminem talking...]. HAHAHA, Yo, check this out, you faggots ain't even on my level.. I'ma let D12 rhyme on you bitch made ass faggots!. [Kon Artis]. Yo, get out the way, yo Get out the way, yo. Whitey Ford's heart just stopped. Eminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack. Whitey Ford's gettin his ass floored for talkin back. Little faggot amarillo, I show you what murders are ?. At your own restuarant while I'm servin ya. Drop and stomp your whole heart til it stops. Call the cops, I'ma beat your ass while he walks [in locks?]. [Kuniva]. Now we got the whole industry makin fun of you Eric. Where's your house of pain now, there's only one of you Eric. You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go around. With some killers from seven mile to the motherfuckin bellow, bridge. [Eminem/Chorus 2]. Grab 380s when you see Slim Shady. Call the doctor to heal your heart. They shocked you back to life at the clinic. But you bout to get relapsed any minute, honkey I hit 'em up. [Eminem]. Got on his ass and now this faggot want to mention me still. This ain't no freestyle battle, Everlast gettin killed. With his chest open, tryin to throw a fuckin punch, but you just chokin. Havin a stroke, and now you learn white crackers never earned a dime. Cuz you suck motherfucker you should learn to rhyme. Talkin bout you packin pistols, but it's funny to me. You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me. I'm a pale faced killer WHALE. On his way to fuckin prison pistol whippin tail, ha. Eric, remember when I passed you in the lobby that day. That shit was obvious you probably was gay, ha. Now it's all bout country, you gave up hip-hop. 49,000 copies, the week your shit dropped. While my sales making records break. 2 and a half million scanned by the second week. Mother fucker I hit em up. [D12 and Eminem spit on the next few verses. Proof goes first...]. I'm from Detroit's Pemberton now. Four bullets tear you in half. Fuck the music we got a oouzi for all you fags. Get this shit out of my stereo. DIALATED YOU VIOLATED. Now you bout to get ANNIHILATED. We gon burry you, Harris [?]. Cire's [?] get choked up and yolked up. All you underground bitches get your throats cut. [Swifty]. What the fuck, is you stupid?. I choked Whitey Ford with his fuckin guitar cord. And stuck him in cardboard. Chopped up in a box, with sixteen parts. I stomped on his heart D12 havin you filled [?]. Fucked your mother while you watch. Keep your restuarant locked and block your door. Cuz we hit 'em up like motherfuckin Tupac Shakur. [Eminem]. You a, black Jesus, heart attack seizures,. Too many cheeseburgers, McDonald's Big Mac Greases. White Devil, washed up honkey. Mixed up cracker who crossed over the country. Haha, oh hell!. Cut this shit off, SHIT.. fuck him.. That's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done.. That's it. I'm sorry. No more. I'm sorry,. I'm sorry, I promise. I just believe in kicking a man while he's down.. God DAMN...I quit.."

Your fruity effect of a crack dealer. Yâ€™all president sends me smack. Den got a mack 10 with it. So I ainâ€™t gotta rap. But Iâ€™m thankful for that. Donâ€™t mistaken me black. Or you be stankinâ€™ in back of a fuckinâ€™ Cadillac. [Eminem]. Iâ€™ma get snuffed. Cause I ainâ€™t said enough to pipe down. I pipe down when the White House is whipped out. When I see that â€˜lil Cheany dike get snipped out. Lights out, bitch, adios, goodnight. Now put that in your â€˜lil pipe and bite down. Think for a minute cause the hype has died down. That I wonâ€™t go up in the oval office right now. And flip whatever ainâ€™t tied down upside down. Iâ€™m all for America, fuck the government. Tell that C. Doloris Tucker slut to suck a dick. Motherfucker, duck, what the fuck, son of a bitch. Take away my gun and Iâ€™m a tuck some other shit. Canâ€™t tell me shit about the tricks of this trade. Switch blade with a â€˜lil switch to switch blades. Switch from a 6 to a 16 inch blade. Shits like a samurai sword, a sensei. Shit just donâ€™t change to this day.

Iâ€™m sayinâ€™ you motherfuckers donâ€™t know and quit playinâ€™. If Iâ€™m broke then Iâ€™m brakinâ€™ open the place where you layinâ€™. You know, same shit every nigga done in his life. I lived it, thatâ€™s why I speak on what I want when I write. So why... should I... ever fear another man. If he bleed like I, bleed, take a piss and he stand. Ok, you win... you can say we canâ€™t rap. But no source never mean we ainâ€™t buyinâ€™ on what they say is wack. [Kuniva]. I walk in the party and just start bustinâ€™. Right after I hear the last verse, Iâ€™m self-destruction. This liquor make me wanna blast the chrome. To let you know that time without more is gettinâ€™ Jerome. Iâ€™m low down and shifty, quickly, called Swifty. To do a drive by on a 10-speed with ""50"". You feelinâ€™ lucky? Squeeze. I catch you outside of Chucky Cheese. Well, just see, who be an unlucky G. My life style is unstable, a partyinâ€™ attic. They said no fightinâ€™ in the club so I brought me a matic. Coughinâ€™ ecstatic, I jump niggas, call me a rabbit.

For ya see my pistol in 3-D. No time to call a peace treaty. Dial 9-1-1 cause you need de. Police to help you, believe me. [Proof]. I snatch the tongue from the sidewalk and piss on the curb. This is absurd. These street niggas twistinâ€™ my words. We finally could. Say goodbye to Hollywood. Cause Proof and Shaun. Share nuttinâ€™ in common. The nastiest band. With gats in each hand. We never bomb down to be a flash and a pan. No remorse. Fuck you stature, dogg. Nuttinâ€™ to do with hands when I clap at yâ€™all. Put your jaw on the ground. With the 4 and a pound.

revelation,"Chorus: Eminem]. I don't wanna go to school (I don't need no). I don't need no education (education). I don't wanna be like you. I don't wanna save the nation. Daddy NO. I just wanna live my life (I don't need no). Everyday a celebration (self-control). One day I'ma leave this world. I'm waiting for the revelation. [Bizarre]. I wanna kill myself. I'm still debating. In front of a Baptist Church masturbating. Praying to Satan. Think I'm crazy cuz I smoke crack. Live on B with the mac. In a two family flat. Tired of getting hit in the face with a broom. My mom's on her period. My dad's in my room. I got ten rocks that I need to get out. I sold 'em in five minutes. In my own damn house. (My mom smokes crack). My poor grandmother. God bless her soul. The bitch got AIDS. She was waiting to die of a cold. There's three things to keep me from being a Nazi. I'm black, a fag, and my dad's Liberace. [Kon Artis]. No matter how bad the beating. I went to school cheating. My dad whooped my ass at a PTA meeting. Skipping school, I had to have nuts just to do it. Got born and became truant. When I had the gaul to go. I just couldn't do it. I was lured into corners by this peer pressure shit. How would you feel if you was held. By the tip of a barrel. Getting threatened to get your skin. Ripped to bone marrow. Bet suburban kids. Never got rushed for their apparell like me. Outcast. Last to class. First to leave. When the teacher called on me. Best believe. I had something up my sleeve. [Eminem]. I been praised and labeled as crazy. My mother wasn't able to raise me. Full of crazy rage. An angry teenager. Nothing could change me back. Gangsta rap made me act like a maniac. I was boosting. So influenced by music. I used it as an excuse to do shit. Ooh I was stupid. No one could tell me nothing. Hip hop overwhelmed me. To the point where it had me in a whole 'nother realm. It was like isolating myself was healthy. It felt like we was on welfare but wealthy. Compelled me to excel when school had failed me. Expelled me. And when the principal would tell me I was nothing. And I wouldn't amount to shit. I made my first million and counted it. Now look at it. A fucking drop-out that quit. Stupid as shit. Rich as fuck. And proud of it. Thats why.... [Chorus]. I don't wanna go to school (I don't need no). I don't need no education (education). I don't wanna be like you. I don't wanna save the nation. Daddy NO. I just wanna live my life (I don't need no). Everyday a celebration (self-control). One day I'ma leave this world. I'm waiting for the revelation. [Swifty]. I was raised with a rifle and mask. Steadily beating my psychiatrist's ass. Just for asking about my past. I was never on that punk shit. Fucking around could get your beloved abducted. Smothered in blood quick. You couldn't pay Swift to give a fuck. Was crazy like my father. It must have been poison in that nigga's nutt. Far as probation. Fuck peeing in cups. I violate it anytime. Let 'em see the blunt. I grew up steadily masturbating inside a cell. Drunk as hell. Having conversations with myself. You could tell I wasn't leniant. A disobedient lynch. that slapped teachers. Bitch I'm not reading it. You don't know what dogs go through. A little nigga sipping liquor. With my old dude. What the fuck you gon' do?. I'm quick to curse you. I told my mother that I'ma hurt you. If you ever again mention a curfew. [Kuniva]. Look. My family ignores me and I don't like that. They don't even listen when I tell 'em. I'll be right back. This nice beautiful house mom?. It don't mean shit. Cuz you know Daddy's a drunk. And he don't clean shit. And yesterday he hit me like a grown fucking man. I couldn't stand up to him. I just ducked and ran. I'm sick of this. I wish on Christmas. That I can get a loaded four-fifth. And put a fucking end to this (Fuck it!). I got no friends and I can't get a bitch. Only thing I have is dirty magazines and sticky fingertips. Nothing to smile about. I'm about to lose my mind. Got me an automatic nine. Now I'm wildin' out. [Proof]. when schools over. Pupil or people to shoot through. Kids going cuckoo. With a two-two. Since my friend is this new dude. In his high school. Losing his noodle. Learning people don't like you. The football jocks is. Spitting on him. Popular kids in school that's now picking on him. Burn out youngsta niggas now hitting on him. And his teacher in his English class keep flipping on him. And now he's grounded with no allowances. For drinking forty ounces. Cuz he was caught by his counselors. And why the fuck I gotta ride the bench coach?. Already got expelled for wearing a trenchcoat. All I ever seen is. (Violence, violence). Told me to keep silent. Stop batting my eyelids. It's apparent that my parents weren't parents at all. That's why I blow out my brains. and murdered you all...(FUCK YOU). [Chorus: Eminem]. I don't wanna go to school (I don't need no). I don't need no education (education). I don't wanna be like you. I don't wanna save the nation. Daddy NO. I just wanna live my life (I don't need no). Everyday a celebration (self-control). One day I'ma leave this world. I'm waiting for the revelation"

searchin',"[Women Singing:]. Ain't no one special, special like you [4X]. I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby [4X]. [Eminem]. I'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing. Missing what I remember, kissing and hugging and squeezing. Bugging and weezing, I'm having trouble when breathing. It's even tougher when sleeping. But there's a couple of reasons that I'm suffering and grieving. For loving and leaving, you all I'm thinking of in the evening. You got my knees buckling and weakening. Thoughts of nothing but freaking that I'm struggling to keep in. And interrupt when I'm speaking. I got some game that I'm preparing to run. The way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun. You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun. Cause your comparing to none, I wanna share in the fun. I feel a passionate lust when I'm imagining just us alone at last with a. touch. I see you grasping to trust, but my intentions are good. The seed is passing in dust. I'm not asking to rush and answer immediately. I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me. If you agree to repeat after me, I Love You (I love you baby). Cause I just need you to see, how much I'm eager to be. Your man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed. This is easily said, so you can lead or be led. If you care to be down cause ain't nobody Like you no where to be found. [Chorus:]. [Women Singing:]. I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby [4X]. [Kon Artis]. Baby it's all on you, it's you I call on boo. Let's set a day up so you can fall on through. We'll take a spin in a Lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast. Long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es. We'll start it out with caviar, Don Parigne. And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on. We'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things. I got the herbs the Bacardi and Hurricane. If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day. It's still all right cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray. Your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear. You look impeccable, nothing compares. I dream of freaking you, the women that will speak it too so. It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so. Now we all set to play, only thing left to say is. When you step away, baby but don't forget the Neglicie. [Chorus:]. [Women Singing:]. I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby [8X]."
serious,"[Intro]. Here it is, there it is ladies and gentlemen. We got one more act. [Bakarat] Yeah, y'all gone like this one. [Jus]. Tell 'em about it, Backarat. This yo' man J-U-S and this track called ""Serious"". Promatic featuring Eminem and Swift. [Eminem]. What's up with everybody beefin'. Everybody seem like they wanna beef. You know what I'm saying?. Everybody beefin' with everybody. This shit is crazy. [Dogmatic]. This is a bomb scare, fires on your hair. Terrorists live here, but I don't care. I'm making potholes when I stomp, so don't stare. I stop to stomp competition, with both fair. How dare, little soldier at ease. We shake down these streets, like Parkinson's disease. We parking the road trees, plus load the weapons. Everything to six shooters, to high tech ones. If a green beans things, to my suggestion. Burn a big whole in your belly, like indigestion. With one question, who the fuck is Dogmatic. An underground nigga but this nigga's above average. It's serious! Who can understand what I'm saying?. Yo Slim, tell them niggaz. [Eminem] We ain't playing!. [Dogmatic] It's like you open a can of worms or smoked yams. I got bloody hands and burners that make you dance!. CHORUS [Eminem]. This shit is serious! Do you really want beef. Do you really wanna end up, missing yo' front teeth. And see yo' family, getting smoked like a blunt leaf. And wrapped up in a zip-lock bag, like lunch meat. This shit is serious! Do you really want beef. Do you really wanna end up, missing yo' front teeth. And see yo' family, getting smoked like a blunt leaf. And wrapped up in a zip-lock bag, like lunch meat. This shit is serious!. [Swifty McVay]. I'm the only one yo' bitch to touch a. Type a brother that'll, fuck yo' mother, wit' a fishnet rubber. I'ma misfit slash, nitwit.

When it comes to beefin', it ain't no explain'. I'll change ya language, wit' a stainless. I'll contain, wit a name which to make you famous. I'ma deranged pit, I'll bang you till ya back touch ya anus. Don't ever take me to court, I'll whack the plaintiff. Then beat the fuck out the bailiff. A heinous, miscellaneous, nigga never miss, when the AK lift. I paint ya face wit, any weapon, just like the ""Matrix"". They ain't steppin', don't even say shit. You heard about the bodies in my basement, you joinin' them, face it. Chorus. [Proof]. Laugh indictive, like Kim lipstick, and get a nose bleed. My blow speed, is like my hands working ten stick shifts. Captain ask, to stick my finger in the (???). And snatching the driver out the black Benz. Smashing his contact lens, my life start when his contract ends. ""Go kiss-and-tell, and contact Kim!"". Let's be factually, actually, y'all ain't after me. Got (???) wit' Regis, y'all beef is without the Kathy Lee. Told y'all my battery, and go to war happily. How you gon' call my bluff, when you scared to send a fax to me. My faculty guns drawn, one wrong move dudey. And it's too heads on ya body, into a gangster movie. For lot being real, scared to pop wit' the steel. It got skeletons in my house, every closet is filled. Now how does it feel, with this Beretta to ya dome. And to know that ya mom's know, that you was never coming home. Chorus (w/ Ab-libs). [Eminem]. You know what I'm sayin'. You want beef, we taking it to yo' face. Fuck it, Dirty Dozen, Slim Shady. D-12, this shit is serious!"

shit can happen,"Shit can happen. Shit can happeeen. Shit can happen. Shit can happeeen. Shit can happen. Shit can happeeen. Shit can happen. Shit can happeeen. [Kon Artis]. Yo, that's right motherfuckers we back. Same slanging. Orangutaning. Wilding out on hoodrats that say I act. Like I'm too famous. To say hi and tell 'em what My Name Is. But really I'm still nameless. You niggas don't get it yet do you?. Kill or not. Platinum or flop. I'll still put it through you. With a luger that'll spit fire. And hit higher. Than a pitch by a bitch like Mariah. You think for one second since we got a deal. That we won't deal with you in front of St. Andrew's still. You gay rappers better learn that. I won't stop until I see 'em turn back. If you don't slow that road you pack. You gon' see these Runyan Ave. niggas. That really need some Prozac. To show that ask the others. Brigade'll lay you down. Next to your mother's mother's grandmothers. [Kuniva]. You know I'm feeling real rowdy tonight. Ready to fight. And half the niggas I give DAT to. I don't even like. The same cat who never gave a damn about your name. I gives a fuck about it. Like the next L.A. Clippers game. I'll kill you in ways you couldn't even fathom. You ain't a madam. It's really unexplainable how I have 'em. Who call theyselves screaming about a challenge. Nigga we got a gift while you barely making it off of mere talent. My skills are deeply imbedded. Even your hoe said it. She was knock-kneed. I fucked her now she bow-legged. In the middle of rapping I drop the mic. And have a stare down and jump in the crowd and start scrapping. Kuniving Kon Artis my nigga we get it cracking. While the paramedics pick you up we on the side laughing. [Chorus: Kon Artis] (x2). (Shit can happen). This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh. (Shit can happeeen). Shit can happen to him and your ass. (Shit can happen). You can be touched don't think you can't. (Shit can happeeen). Cuz niggas ain't fucking around no more man. [Swifty]. The feds can't hold me (why?). I hold feds. I was born with a dark ass cloud over my head (uh huh). Raining acid (nigga). You can't refrain from getting your ass kicked. Cuz you talk too much. You asked for it. I'm on some massive shit. Everybody ignore me. They wouldn't fuck with me if I was performing at an orgy. These niggas think I'm fronting (what up now?). Then they change stories. I catch you and they thinking everything's hunky dory. I even have you pour me the gasoline for me (do it). Pulling up slowly. Cop tailing your homies. Met a lot of niggas but you wouldn't wanna know me (for real). Your ass might not even make it home with your roley (nigga). Don't even try. In your system like eco lie. Trying to beef with me. Nigga please, your people die. I'm so wicked that my momma gave birth illegally (uh huh). I survived the abortion immediately (Surprise!!!). [Eminem]. Picture me sitting in a jail cell rotting. Or barricaded in a motel with twelve shotguns. When the *cops* come knocking. Each hands got one. Cocked ready to dump slugs heavy as shot puts. One man army. Guns can't harm me. Young and ornery. Worse than my Uncle Ronnie. Ever since I got my first gun pulled on me. I can't stop airing out my dirty laundry. Middle fingers flip at censorship. Your friends just flipped. Over this swift penmanship. Ever since I spit some shit on Infinite. I been giving it a hundred and ten percent. Cuz when I vent most of my energy's. Spent on enemies. Eighty percent of what I invent is hennessy. And twenty percent is from being hungry as sin. Ten is because I love being under your skin. Ya, (shit) shit can happen. So stick to rapping. Quit the yapping. Or I'ma lift the mac in. That can lead to another mishap happening. Skip the crap. Get the can of whoop ass cracking. Chorus (x2). [Outro: Eminem]. (Shit can happen). It can and it will. (Shit can happeeen). Fuck around with Amityville. (Shit can happen). And you die. Insanity still. (Shit can happeeen). Mentality of twelve motherfuckers in six different bodies. (Shit can happen). With their personality split. (Shit can happeeen). Fucking you up with hit after hit. (Shit can happen). Sticking you up with clip after clip. (Shit can happeeen). Making you suck dick after dick. (Shit can happen). (Shit can happeeen). Dirty motherfuckin dozen. (Shit can happen). The Kon Artis. (Shit can happeeen). Motherfuckin Peter S. Bizarre. Swifty McVeigh. The Kuniva. Dirty fatherfuckin Harry. Puttin you down in the cemetary. You get buried. All of you motherfuckers suck our motherfucking cock. We are not playing. We are not playing. We are not bullshitting. This is not a motherfucking joke."

I'll Shit On You. I will Shit On You. [Swifty]. I remain fatter than gluttony. Tapin bombs to the back of record companies. Blow them up if they ain't want me.

I drown niggaz in hundred degree saunas. You can act a fool if ya wanna (biatch!). It's this lyrical piranha. Strapped wit a grenade, in the pool with ya mama. Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom. Twist nothin up like a condom. Slap it if you fuckers got a problem. When I see 'em, you hoes endin up in a fuckin mausoleum. Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM. Pull in the garage while you screamin. Keep the motor on then I'm leavin (I'll Shit On You!). I'll Shit On You!. [Chorus: Eminem]. I will shit on you I don't care who you are. (I'll Shit On You!). I don't give a fuck about you or your car. (I'll Shit On You!). Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch. (I'll Shit On You!). Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family. (I'll Shit On You!). [Bizarre]. I'm a alcoholic with the fuckin toilet. Pass the hotdogs (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?). Bitch shut your fuckin mouth. I'ma keep eatin 'till Richard Simmons comes to my house. with a chain saw to cut me out (me out, me out!). I'll fuck your wife, I had sex since I met her. Too busy fuckin wit, your baby sitter. And all women ain't shit. Only good for cookin, cleanin. and sucking dick and thats it (I said it). I was responsible for killin John Candy. I got Jonbenet Ramsey in my Ninety Eight Camry. I don't give a fuck who you are. I'll shit on anybody. Truly yours the idiotic Bizarre. [Eminem]. My adolescent years weren't shit 'till what I do now. I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down. The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in. The more ignorant, the incident is, I fit in. Ignorin the shit how borin it gets. When there's no one to hit. I don't know when to quit throwin a fit. I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me. Its they who rapped me and say they can take me. Its they who legs I brake and make achy. Its they who mistake me and make me so angry. (I'll Shit On You!) I'll spit on you. Start pissin and do the opposite on you. You weren't listenin, I said I'll cop a squat on you. Start spillin my guts like chicken cordon blew and. Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch. on his skit on his last album. Pull my pants downward... [Chorus]. [Kon Artist]. Is Richard Pryor still alive?. If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dyin (what?). Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless. Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang-it. Bitch bring it, these niggaz that I hang with. Will hang you up naked by your ankles danglin. My need I stay stranglin. I don't need your help. If you gon' give me the pussy. I'll un-loosen my belt (I'll Shit On You!). I'm what your daddy's not, your mom's kinda cock. Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks. Buck fifty cross your neck. Floss your teck, I'll beat you wit it across your chest. [Kuniva]. It's only right I jack your car keys and run. Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns. For fun, when I'm drunk. I'll run a truck through the weed house. Jump out and beat ya peeps down worst than Steve Stout. Put you in chokeholds I learned last week. From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep. (hey, hey, hey!). I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl. Thats like D-Bo fightin Peablo Bryson (I'll Shit On You). So what you hollerin and yellin about. I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fuckin skeleton out. Niggaz get hit wit a two piece, ""Bling Bling"". Wit a poisonous sting. I'm such a violent thing. [Chorus]. [Eminem]. Once I get on two, hits of X. My disk slips and disconnects. 'Till I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck. But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects. (c'mon, I'll Shit On You!). Over reaction is my only reaction. Which only sets off a chain reaction. and puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action. A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten. Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters. and spilling liters of blood like swimmin pools. Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too {*bullets spray*}. A lot of people say misoginistic which is true. I can't deny it matter of fact I stand by it. So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot. If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet. Boy, girl, dog, woman, man, child... (I'll Shit On You!). I will Shit On You I don't care who you are. I'll Shit On You. I don't give a fuck about you or your car. I'll Shit On You.

Chokin' your wife all in front of your peeps. She toss a brick through the window of your Jeep. They back together by the end of the week. That's so sweet. Slim and Kim argue too much. [Proof]. Invite a ho to your house. While your bitches out. Now you got this dick. All up in her fuckin mouth. Pull it out. And then you bust off on her favorite blouse. That's how Clinton got caught up. [Kon Artis]. Steal cars, wreck bars, got fucked up beyond. Recognition, walk in 50 clubs like we stars. Our mission every day is just to smoke bongs and fuck bitches. That's how Runyan Ave. is cut. [Swift]. When your life wasn't raised up right. See your mother coming home. With different niggas every night. And then you run in to the one you don't like. So get the fuck off ::shooting::. That's how step-dads get fucked up. This is how it happens to you. That's how people get fucked up. This is how it happens to you. That's how people get fucked up. This is how it happens to you. That's how people get fucked up. This is how it happens to you. That's how people get fucked up."
that's how (skit),"(fading in). Shit can happen. Shit can happen. Shit can happen (throw ya hands up!). Shit can happen (throw ya hands up!). Shit can happen (yeah, yeah). Shit can happen. Kon Artis:. That's right motherfuckers we back. Same slangin. Orangutangin. Wilding out on hoodrats that say I act like like I'm too famous. To say hi. And tell 'em what ""My Name Is"". But really I'm still nameless.... (music stops). Kon Artis:. I said hold up, hold up!. I know you didn't just go shit up on that stage, bitch ass nigga.. (Hey, fuck you!). Fuck me?. Nigga FUCK YOU!. (*punches 2 times*). (Nigga!). Crowd: WOOOOH!. Kon Artis:. Muh' fuckin ass nigga.... That's how niggas get fucked up!."
these drugs,"[Chorus 1]. It's (it's) be (be) cause (cause) of (of). these drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do. Be.. cause.. of... these drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do. [Eminem - speaking over Chorus 1]. It was like.. whoahh and then the fuckin room started spinnin and shit. And my friend came in he was like, ""Yo! Yo! Em! Em!. You puttin that shit up your nose again?"". And I was like, ""Naw"" nuttin like - everything was just spinnin. I couldn't even see and like, he started to look like a monster n shit. Then I just started laughin and threw up all over the fuckin floor. It's crazy. [Chorus 2 - over last two lines of Chorus 1]. It's because, of these drugs, that I do, that make me. do these things, that I do, do these things, that I do. [Eminem]. My music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it. It's like, Lucifer's here to influence listeners through it. You probably do what it said to do just from listenin to it. It's got the power to get you to do it (c'mon). So when the shit comes on, I wanna see some shit jump off. Some bitch get slapped, some motherfuckin kid get stomped. So get this song, go run out and buy this disc. And try this shit, as much coke as I just did. Cause times like these, got me doin lines like these. Plus I grab a pencil every time that I light weed. It's probably because of the drugs Shady does what he does. and is what he is, I'm dizzy Bizzy visit these kids. [Bizarre]. Hey Stephanie (hi!) Let's take some ecstasy (okay!). Now pull your pants down bitch and have sex with this dog next to me. (huh?) 'Til I'm dead I'm takin blunts to the head. Needles in my broken leg, listen to Grateful Dead. These mescalines got me sure. that I can fuck any whore with genital warts on the Warped Tour. Who slipped this downer in my Snapple?. Cussin out Interscope (Bizarre, you're signed to Capitol!). Fuck it, I was born with half a brain. Sniffin 'caine, at celebrity basketball games. You motherfuckers think I'm a gimmick. cause I got a Cash Money tattoo and roll with No Limit (UNNNNGGGHHH!). The last time I sniffed blow. I ended up in Denver, Colorado at an Iggy Pop show. Bizarre be smokin a half a pound. Fuckin the engineer's wife, while he's mixin my song down. [Chorus 1]. [Eminem - speaking over Chorus 1]. It's like, back when I first went on tour. I like, went crazy I was like out of control. And - just was fuckin wasted every night, like. wakin up the next morning like - where the... Where the fuck am I at, what the fuck is goin on. you see what I'm sayin? I was just like, out of control. [Chorus 2 - over last two lines of Chorus 1]. [Swifty McVay]. These Benadryls got me stiffer than a mannequin. Eight years old swallowin Anacins, standin over my bannister. Laughin with a chromed out caliber (hahahahaha). The weed that I'm sellin this (?) look like the back of a tarantula. I keep a substantial amount of aspirins in my Acura. Smashin it, after framin a nigga with smack and dust. I'm scandalous, drugs been ran for months. Crackin capsules to expand our blunts. I rolled it up and take the pressure to the head. Now I'm lookin like a extra on ""Night of the Living Dead"". until they find me on a stretcher. I'm quick to sample anything, bitch you got a tester?. This crank'll have me blowin up banks like Uncle Fester. [Proof]. Ahhhh.. watch tonight, you'll admit that I'm a fiend. Pop beans, 'scalines, along with amphetamines. Ghetto kings, meddling with the smell of greens. Got a Jell-o spleen, and see yellow rings (ohhhhhh). Blue pills, and purple mushrooms. (Hey little girl, you got a curfew, don't you?). Missin since yesterday, perfect just for rape. See I'm on judgment day, numb from special K. Two tabs of X and vitamin C. Swallow Hennessey along with Tylenol 3. Grindin the teeth at the signs of the E. I lost six days at a time in the week. The crime in the street hold your parents for ransom. while D-12 gang rape Marilyn Manson. In twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic. Barf up my stomach linin, drown in my vomit. [Chorus 1] - 2.5X. [Eminem - speaking over Chorus 1]. Cause I like, I always tell people - yknowhatI'msayin like. If you got an addiction, don't admit, to nobody, yknowhatI'msayin?. Keep that shit to yourself; because if anybody sees that, yknahmsayin. when you're out in the public eye and shit. they're always gonna think that you're on that shit even if you're not. That's why I always tell my friends, knowhatI'msayin but. I mean, like for me, I don't give a fuck. I'll probably end up, dyin from this shit one day. Probably pick up a newspaper in the morning and it's like. ""Eminem dies from, drug overdose"" - youknowhatI'msayin? And. And my friends, they ain't no fuckin better, yknowhatI'msayin?. They ain't nothin but influences, bad influences to me, y'know. It's peer pressure, shit is like all peer pressure. That's what it boils down to - and, I give in to it. So do they... [Chorus 2 - over last two lines of Chorus 1] - 2x."

Borough of every hood, In this crime life.... My name painted on the block or this limelight. A G aint' nuthin' but a letter, you can hang man. and these gang-wars, thoughout the gang-lands. Got no problem for hurtin' the *Church*. My model was murkin' 'em first,. when they said they servin they're turf. With no sea-food, make 'em see-through. I'm into slappin' *****z, next *****.... [VERSE 2: Swifty]. ....Me Too. My eliminations way too hasty, they don't chase me,. I send more red dot's than pastries,. When the medal is sworn, label me the desolate one,. It aint no settlin' beef, im destined to come.... To any hood, it aint no justice, you wishin' it was.... This crime life got me stealin' your goods. I'm a mental patient, on my way to the central station,. ain't no wasting time... and i sure i facing time. Breaker-1-9, the *cops* be swarming. on they walkie talkies, tryin' to block me with a warnin'. I'ma dissapear like Spawn, and be gone. to the other side of the country, by the morning....

""My lil' bro keep up the front like he the one that owe"". by the time they figure out i'll be dead and gone. [Verse 4: Kuniva]. Now be careful when you see them homies hop out that ride. You can catch a body shot and knock your ribs out your side. And the cops are hesitant to come through these parts here,. We head-hunters, so it's evident that we spark fear,. Takin' notes, but always give it to a person in need,. Of a serious chin-checkin' ?. to get our point across, clearly aint no miss-understanding,. now there's nothing you can do to keep these missles from landin'. When the hooligans come out you should be runnin' for cover. By the time you recoved from the hit, then here comes anotha. And you know our presents/ce is felt, like Christmas eve. Make an example out of you, for her and his to see.... [VERSE 5: Bizarre]. Jumped in your carw window, you and your boys get out. AK... Tech Nine... Shots rang out....

till hell freezes over,"Yo yo yo yo yo (this is). This is my motherfucking anthem (hip hop). To hip hop music (anthem). Cause I'm gonna keep doing hip hop music. until the day that I die (aight bitch). Yo I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and ugji boards. Lighting candles camping out at haunted beach resorts. I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence. Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands. Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks. Holding a rifle, with a life full of drama like Tupac's. Jumping off roof tops drunk after i do shots. Landing in someone's backyard getting chewed up by two rotts. I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks. This rap shit got cash coming out the blue like nude cops. I use to sell pizza's, now i got twelve visa's. So tell jesus I'm gonna quit sending when hell freezes. [chorus]. That's why my brain is out of order. That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter. But as the world turns and I keep growing older. I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over. Bitch till hell freezes over. I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over. And as the world turns and i keep growing older. I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over. Yo I use to be to heavy in that cruising rap shit crap. I think i fucked my head up listing to acid rap. I go to party's bumping nasty nas's new song. And smoke pot till I get high and i stare at shit for too long. Like this weed is laced aint, it taste tainted. Your whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted. Spaced out like sci-fi t.v. Fuck ICP buy my cd. cause while I'm screaming while I'm handing out promo tapes of my debut. telling bitches let me eat your pussy while I shave you. Aint no shame in my game I turn the party out. Making everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth. [chorus]. That's why my brain is out of order. That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter. But as the world turns and i keep growing older. I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over. Bitch till hell freezes over. I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over. And as the world turns and i keep growing older. I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over. Uh, uh uh uh uh. Ah ah ah ah. Uh uh uh uh. Ah ah ah ah. Uh uh uh uh(Dr.dre).

trife thieves,"[Chorus: repeat 2X]. Trife thieves we can't be trusted. step into my clique the wrong way. and get your motherfucking dome busted. We got cement shoes for all you damn snitches. We ain't just shooting niggaz. we buckin bitches. [Bizarre]. My fully loaded nine will shoot through your metal door. Have ya nigga's far and out like white kids at grocery stores (AHHHH). Battle bizarre and its just to deadly. Even a rapper with amnesia who met me still could forget me. If I don't get all my fucking dough. Y'all gonna see more fights and spits then the Jerry Springer show. Cause I'm a nasty, dirty, filthy bitch. But _ even a basshead with AIDS would suck my dick. Cause I'm quick to snatch a nigga out his polo. I'm the reason nigga's come ten deep and end up leaving solo. Meet losing ya'll nigga's must be bugging. We can battle for ten minutes and let your cousins be the judges. I'm the illest rapper to come out thus far. I'll shoot anybody even the bitch who gave me CPR. Step to the Outz and end up getting burned. Fuck around and get raped like one of Bill Clinton's interns. [Eminem]. I'll shove a gun in ya grill greasy and heated. smothered in hot mustard. so when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it. You need to be immediately treated while you breathin. or you'll be leavin the receivin room this evenin with Jesus. You hate on us and we'll be waitin on eight corners swarmin ya hood. With a thousand angry skateboarders (c'mon). I hop in a jeep and slam on the gas and charge you. and bombard you in the car that your mom bought you. Fuck around and get choked and found in a moat. Flotin around drowned face down in a boat. I'll pile five dudes in a pinto and pull up. to the 7 Mile drive-through at McDonald's and piledrive you. I got the power to snatch a motherfucker out of his car. When he drives by me at 90 mph. This place is my house I might as well erase my face with white out. cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows. [Fuzz]. I'm dressed to please sucking nips, yeah, she get it. The same way that I fucked the chick. Stuck my hands in her panties like bitch suck my dick. 87 freak 187 heat the passion rolls I'm passing clothes. You like it in the ass is what I'm askin hoes. Aren't you Fuzz he has sold more albums then the Jackson's sold. I love you baby if I'm not with you then I'm blastin foes. Telepathly harrasing foes. I know your little sister is four-teen but her ass can grow. Ice-berg took down Titantic elastical. Given my fans the exact shit they asking for. Fuzz Scooter fucking one man bout to show you passing one blunt. Bitch we passing four. I rode your ass and smoked take one pull and smoke your head up. I'll send you to tell 2Pac to keep his head up. I went to the fighting really Canibus who can get up. I knew this shit was over from the fucking blood that he spit up. Ran a couple more miles should have done more sit-ups. I want his dumb ass to jump up bitch and get lit up. Call your bitch like bitch come and pick this bitch up. On battle you be sweeter then I get this shit up. I'll stomp you too you get up. Or stomp you to the cops come. Eighty nigga's came when your fucking block got dumb."

See me lookin' for you when you win in a pen,. see I hug you dirty. You confronting me for flirtin'?. You wanted me so suddenly, my company's a burden,. but I won't jump a balcony, and how can I be hurtin'.. I'm just playin' wit you and it's workin'.. Your friend's can't save you, they fakin' like they nurses.. [Bizarre]. First time I saw you, up in them guests,. you the only reason I use Federal Express.. Shit, I don't be havin' no packages. Naw,. I'm getting dressers, lamps, and big matresses.. I go crazy when I smell your odor.. I just want to pick you up, and take you to Pan-De-Rosa.. Steak and potatoes, whatever you want..

That's fine, I just wanna make you mine.. niggas say you a 3, I think you a dime.. [Chorus]. [Proof]. I love the way yo' body grindin', gettin' all in my face.. Only thing on your mind is which wallet to ?.. Your ass looks so perfect with your thong on your waist,. built like a stallion, you belong in a race.. Get money by the barrel, King Kong in the place.. Movie and a dinner, that's as long as I wait.. Hey, I ain't on your ear off, talkin' dates.. Got you dizzy of the crissy, you ain't walkin' straight.. Got a roomy, bring your booty, and lets cultivate.. You so pretty, love them titties, they soft and fake.. Bring your friends, ""Damn your ? smell like coffeecake."". Yo meet me at the place when you get off at eight.. [Kuniva]. The way you move have got me buggin' out.. And you quick to take off your jacket and slug it out,. we thug it out. Pourin' 40's out and give each other ?. In fact,. we both hate goin' out, we both hate small gats.. You the truth I'm for real yo I love you to death.. And if we break up, I'ma stalk you and bug you to death.. Till you scared to leave the house because you know I'm in the bushes.. We went from hugs and kisses into shoves and pushes.. Tis all love, take it and stride, I'm only jokin' wit you.. I don't get down like that, you know I'd never hit you.. But yet and still if I ever feel I'm about to,. [Gets angrier]. I'll gently grab the shoulders and shake the shit out ya girl!!!. [Chorus]. [Kon Artis]. I take a light skinned, dark skinned, short and black,. add in to a sassy and they ass is fat.. Corporate suburb when you could be a classy rat.. Louis Votton cost to much to have a bag to match.. Girl forget all that, I'm gettin' rich off rap,. and you could be my aid in all as long as you got my back.. Seditary, there's entrepreneurs, and that's a fact.. And your birthday's seven days after mine, correct?. Well that's two things that we got in common, baby.. Hopin' there ain't a problem that I'm involved in Shady.. Cause come next year, I will not be datin',. cause my plan's to be with your stankin' ass OK?. [Chorus]"
udontwantnun,"[intro]. You don't want none of it, none of it. You know we come wit it, come wit it. Go get your guns and clips, guns and clips. Give them their punishment, punishment. (Kill who we wanna kill, bust who we wanna bust). (Steal what we wanna steal, fuck who we wanna fuck). [verse one: Livio]. Eh yo, I need a mic, I kick rhymes at the speed of light. I'm a different person everyday, I wonder who I be tonight. I got split personalities for niggas that try to challenge me. I make 'em walk through galleries and get on they nerves like allergies. I make 'em burn calories, I make 'em earn salaries. Livio, I'm the one, I make rappers call me Your Majesty. I'm blindin' ya eyesight, I feel like I been alive twice. The SOURCE can't even deny this deserves more than five mics. My style is hard, if ya bite me, you'll be chippin' ya tooth. As soon as I get in the booth, niggas witness the truth. I hit ya hard and tell Bizarre to get me the Proof. You niggas might be dyin' to win, but ya livin' to lose. I'm givin' you clues, you already forgettin' the news. I came to make ya feet stank and take a shit in ya shoes. Now, I got two niggas wit me, but you'll hear what I said first. I'll make ya head burst and keep it rollin' like Fred Durst. If you got a live album, I'll turn it into a dead verse. I go berserk 'cause of the way my brain networks. No matter where ya at, you do it here, do it there. Ain't nothin' jockin' you niggas but a little bit of pubic hair, mothafucka. [chorus]. Niggas can't fuck wit me. And you niggas is stuck wit me. D-12 is up wit me. And you niggas can't fuck wit me. (2X). *2nd time background voice says*. Kill who we wanna kill, bust who we wanna bust. Steal what we wanna steal, fuck who we wanna fuck. [verse two: Bizarre]. Marchin' 90 ghosts, gold roast, plus plaque. You laid on ya back, Bizarre overreacts. Bitches and ballers, I'm stickin'. Give you a 2-piece like Kentucky Fried Chicken. From Seattle to Detroit, I gets gully. I beat a bitch's ass who swear to God I'm Huggy. You wanna fight? Let's throw up. Ask Three-6 Mafia about the clubs we done tore up. Bizarre come through wit a street cleaner. You see so much Blood, you'd swear you was in Pasadena. Battle? I'll run through ya crew. Mad 'cause you ain't out like Playstation 2. Detroit, what?! You dealin' wit a fuckin' nut. Fuck ya grandmother in the butt, call her a dirty slut. You wanna battle? Skidaddle!. 'Cause you ain't needed like Patrick Ewing in Seattle. [chorus: (2X)]. [verse three: Proof]. I spit flames, Dirty Harry's the nickname. Kidnap sluts and feed 'em crack like Rick James. Neighborhood Spiderman, hype off Vicaden. And generic vitamins snypin' through a rifle lens. At ya church at who recitin' them triflin' Bible kins. Then gank the Billy Blanks for his rank and tae-bo gyms. Come hard when I write, wit slugs slide viagara. Make you fall like Niagra, marvelous is haggler. The bad batter that smash matter. Make your chin a glass shatter, ya moms, I'll blast at her. I'm a glock holder born in October. A pot smoker that was high when I shot Oprah. My cradle was knocked over, I'm not sober. Bumpin' Biggie Smalls, run by wit two of Tupac's posters. Proof and Livio love to spit a flow. Make ya Faces of Death out ya next video. [verse four: Livio]. Yo, pass the mic and watch me come off fast as light. They love to hear what I say when they got questions, they ask me twice. I answer once, I don't spit rhymes to rhyme to. I spit shit so you could tell when you bein' lied to. I don't wanna be lied to, so I got nothin' to ask a liar. Why even bother wit a man that make 'em suck like pacifiers?. So pass the fire, fa sho, I drop the guillotine, fa sho, I got the killa green. That shit that make me look like I'm from the Phillipines. I'm talkin' chinky-eyed, I'll make a man scream so loud everyone think he died. I'll cut off four of his fingers and let his pinky slide. And take him deep down under, I mean it, brotha. I'll jam you up like peanut butter. And shine ya ass up till I make ya fart replenish. I'll make ya heart diminish. I take you start to finish, I plan on gettin' high as a cloud. As soon as I break apart the spinach, yooo.... You don't want beef wit me, my beef is heavy enough to break ya dish. When you see me, make a wish 'cause I'm a leave you wet as a fish. I ain't the type to tell 'em twice, Livio, let 'em learn. They treatin' rap like doorknobs, and lettin' everyone get a turn. Let the air hit emcees, be a part of hip-hop. Man, you niggas couldn't rap if you worked at a giftshop. Fuck you, fuck you, uh... mothafucka!. [chorus: (6X)]"
under the influence,"[Eminem]. So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit. Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick - ha ha!. Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies. I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties. A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass. so the rats can't chew through his last pants. I'm like a mummy at night, fightin with bright lightning. Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin him. I'm like a fuckin wasp in the hospital lost. Stingin the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls. I light a candle and place it up on the mantle. Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin handle. So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin. [Swifty] Bitch it's too late. [Eminem] Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains. [Swifty]. I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator. Degradin, creatin murders to kill haters. Accused for every crime known through the equator. They knew I did it (uh-huh) for havin blood on my 'gators. My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'. I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face [BLAM]. With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose. You never hear me say, ""Forgive me"". I'm snatchin every penny - it gotta be that way nigga, face it. That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it. You hidin, I make the president get a facelift. Niggaz just afraid, handin me they bracelets. Chillin in the lab wasted. I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin - throw up on the mic. Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site. And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight. [Chorus: (Eminem)]. So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit. Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick. Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit. Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick. [Bizarre]. I'm a compulsive liar, settin my preacher on fire. Slashin your tires, flyin down Fenkel and Meyers. Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired. Jackin my dick off in a bed of barbed wire. (Hey, is Bizarre performing?) Bitch didn't you read the flyer?. Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor. (Aren't you a male dancer?) Nah bitch, I'm retired. Fuckin your bitch in the ass with a tire iron. I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip. My DJ's in a coma for lettin the record skip.. [needle pops]. Lettin the record skip.. [needle pops]. Lettin the record skip.. [needle pops] (Damn!). [DJ reverses the record and scratches it back on beat]. I'm fuckin anything when I'm snortin. It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion. [dog whines] Some bitch asked for my autograph. I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed. I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam. All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin ass mom. [Proof]. Ayo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack. Weed laced with somethin [gun cocks] nigga pass that. In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats. At a 'Stop the Violence' rally, I blast gats. Be your mom on publishin, get your ASCAP-ped. The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack. Run your motherfuckin pockets, ASAP. I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's. Born loser, half theif and half black. Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at. Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked. and found chopped up in a trash bag. [Kuniva]. We stranglin rappers until the point they can't yell. cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales. Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace. Gruesome, and causin more violence than nine hoodlums. I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle. Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you. Get executed, cuz I'm a ""Luni"". I got a ""Yukmouth"" and it's polluted. I cock it back then shoot it. I love snatchin up players thugs and young ballers. Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers. Brigade barricade to bring the noise. While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys. If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo. A big Chinese nigga, screamin ""Kuniva yo yo.."". I leave ya face leakin, run up in church. and smack the preacher while he's preachin. Take a swing at the deacon. [Kon Artis]. I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight. I was straight 'til I got caught sellin em shake. I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent. I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent. with the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order. I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin in water. In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von. who got fired from UPS for tryin to send you a bomb. (Special delivery!) I signed to a local label for fun. Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run. Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son. Call your house and hang up on you for not givin me none. Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun. Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin they funds. Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's. 'til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin in dough. [Chorus]. [Eminem]. Haha.. suck my motherfuckin dick. D-12.. Dirty motherfuckin Dozen. Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin husbands.

And be nervous, cuz I'ma be in jail in a cell with C murder. Shady is a general, a soldier form I showed it to him. He saved my life I owe it too him, so compare it to anybody.

You challengers get pushed off banisters, I'm unavoidable like anvals. Droppin on toon characters. [Swifty]. I'm the freak slasher, chop bodies up in meat packer. I reach back for the necks, choppin your feet faster. Than Steven King, I repeatedly beat bastards. The pops for result of havin a meet in maggots.

Sweet fashion, I reload and I keep blastin. I breathe action, if you dont believe ask him. [Kon Artis]. I'm sick of bitches man, I done heard enough shit. Talk alot of mouth like they wanna do it. Then they pull down they pants and then I shoot fluid. Then they start runnin screamin like they God called them. And I called them back and then pulled a crackin in. Stick my dick up in and make them rap again. They wanna rap for me and tell me that they love me. Kon Artis your my daddy and I dont wanna be your hubby. I cant be your hub baby I aint gettin married. I'm stand fuckin bitches, it really very scary. My lil cousin named Terry told me that I fucked him too long. And then I gotta get a Jerry curl to make 'em all keep drippin. You *****z know I never really be trippin, my beats bang. Make ears bleed thru walkmens thats why people ignore you like you aint even talkin. You chit chatter and get splattered by a disease beat addict.

And you know how it is and you know when its gravy next up. Chigga chigga Slim Shady. [Eminem]. I don't figure this rap shit out, I map shit out strategically. Timing is everything and that seems to be the key. To my success I've murked from me repeatably (we beat emcees). Timing is everything and seem to be the key. Let them diss your first then respond immediatley. In order to master the art of war, don't start a war. Shit not no more we dun scared em off there are no more.

when the music stops,"[Bizzare]. Music... Reality.... Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference. But we as entertainers, have a responsibility, to these kids. Psyche. [Eminem]. If I, were to die, murdered in cold blood tommorrow. would you feel sorrow, or show love, or would it matter?. Could never be the lead-off batter if there ain't shit for me to feed off. I'm see-saw battlin'. but there's way too much at stake for me to be fake. there's too much on my plate, I done came way. too far in this game, to turn and walk away, and not say what I got to say. what the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smokin' crack?. 'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back. I'll get up 'fore I get down, gun myself in the ground, 'fore I put some wack shit out. I'm tryin' to smack this one out the park. five-thousand mark, y'all steady tryin' to drown a shark. ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off, lid to the can of whip ass, just twist me off. see me leap out, pull a piece out, fuck shootin', I'm just tryin' to knock his teeth out. fuck with me now bitch, let's see you freestyle. Talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap. Yo Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?. He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that. Man I hate this crap, this ain't rap, this is crazy the way we act. when we confuse hip hop with real life when the music stops. [Swifty]. Ain't no getting' rid of McVeigh. if so you woulda tried, the only way I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide. I have died clinically. arrived ride back at my enemies' crib with Hennessey, got drunk then I finish him. I'm every nigga's favorite arch enemy. Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef. I spark willingly, with a dillinger in the dark, dilligently, I'm not what you think. I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered. I can't stay away from a razor, I just want my face in a paper. I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres. I'll murder you, I gauge have me turn into a mad man, son of sam bitch, I'm surgical. I'm allergic to dyin', you think not, you got balls?. We can see how large, when the music stops. [Kon Artis]. I was happy havin' a deal at first. thought money would make me happy, but it only made my pain worse. It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you. Dog, and you ain't got nuttin' left but your word and your balls. and you're stressed from the calls of your new friends. beggin' with their hands out, checkin' for your record when it's sellin'. when it ain't that's the end, no laughs, no friends, no girls. just the gin you drink, till your car spin. You think DAMN!. When you slam into the wall, and you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm. I'm 'bout to lose it all, in a pool of alcohol, if my funeral's tomorrow. wonder would they even call, when the music stops. [Von]. Let's see how many of your men loyal. when I pull up lookin' for you with a pistol, sippin' a can of penzoil. I'm revved up, who said what. when lead bust your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed. tossed in the paddywagon, braggin' about how you shouted. like a coward, bullets devoured you, showered you niggas. If I was you niggas, I'd run while given a chance, understand. I can enhance the spirit of man. Death itself, it can hurt me, just the thought of dyin' alone that really irks me. you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk. be smart and stop tryin' to walk how G's walk before we spark. Hug the floor while we playin' tug-of-war with your life. fuck a tour and a mike, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife. Deliver that shit that coroner's like, you hype, poppin' shit in broad daylight. nigga you're a gonner at night, when the music stops. [Proof]. Instigators, turn pits in cages. let loose and bit the neighbors, wrist to razors. Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk, in the dark, my dogs all bark like woof!. Proof nigga I'ma wolf, get your whole roof, caved in like reindeer hoofs. Stomp the booth, shake, the floor tiles loose. the more y'all breath, shit, the more lose moves. It's Hill Street, this is hardcore blues. put a gun to rap check in all our dues. Nigga, or make the news, betcha all move. when the uzi pop you better drop, when the music stop. [Bizarre]. Music has changed my life in so many ways. brains confused been fucked since the fifth grade. LL told me rock the bells, NWA said fuck the police, now I'm in jail. '93 was strictly R&B, fucked haircut, listenin' to Jodeci. Michael Jackson who gonna tell me I ain't Mike?. Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight. Flyin' down Sunset smokin' crack, transvestite in the front. Eddie Murphy in the back. MOP had grimy and gritty, Marilyn Manson, I died my hair blue, and grew some titties. Ludacris told me to throw them bows. now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow. Voices in my head I'm goin' in shock. I'm reachin' for the glock, but the music stops {*Bang*}"

To the 1-9, Denaun cause the gun-line. And collect yank from every weed spot like I'm one time. I'm ain't the remorseful type, I'll drink and still drive prone on any thing at any given night. Fuck leavin' my roots, I'm still in cahoots with nincompoots who shoot up like troops in Babe Ruth. Pull up in a red hersh, with Fred Durst dressed like a nurse,.

I don't know what the fuck they're called, I just grabbed 'um!!. 12-gauge dumped in a drug fueled rage, fuck age, I'm still goin' through my ""fuck-you"" stage.

It's D12, June 19th, so do like me, and go buy three, with no I.D.. Kids.... [Proof]. Now why you wanna play a game with me, dangerously. The outcome's hot, once splittin' your brain in three. Proof with crooked raps, always ask them ""What the fuck you lookin' at""?. And invite the hook to scrap. I gave my life to God, n***a, then I took it back. Took it black, this fuckin' gat, will leave your cookie cracked. Detroit's, derelict, arrogant, terrorist, straight on you areospit. Spit at people various people, to leave you bloody 'till your buried with. Every hit was serious, n***as wanna know how murderous The Dirty Harry is. When I'm on your front porch with guns about to bust. Cause.... (No one's ready to deal with us). [Swift]. Ha,. When they runnin' to Swift they change directions. My shit so tight when hoes hear it they catch a yeast infection. You need protection, you gon' fear it. I snatch away yo' DNA from existance, with no spirit. Give up the carrots or see the .9.

Don't make me stop in with a mag, and blow yo feet up out yo Top Ten's. [Kuniva]. I'm the one they call in the ""Tortia"". Smackin' your bitch and forcin' her in the back seat of an old Corcia.
