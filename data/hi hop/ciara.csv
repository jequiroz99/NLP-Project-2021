"paint it, black","I see a red door, I wanna paint it black. No colours any more, I want them to turn black. I seen the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes. I have to turn my head until my darkness goes. I see your lines of colours and they're all painted black. With flowers and my love both never to come back. I see people turn their heads and quickly look away. Like a new born baby just happens everyday. I look inside myself and see my heart is black. I see my red door and it has been painted black. Maybe now I'll fade away and not have to face the facts. It's not easy facing 'em when your whole world is black. No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue. I could not foresee this thing happening to you. If I look hard enough into the settin' sun. My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes. I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black. Black as night, black as coal. I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky. I see a red door, I wanna paint it black. No colours any more, I want them to turn black. I seen the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes. I have to turn my head until my darkness goes. Hmm, hmm, hmm"

yearbook,"(1ST Verse). seems like yesterday we were hanging in the hallway. Waiting for the bell to ring then walk into class late. We had no intentions on paying any attention. Throughing notes across the room, end up in detention. Hiding from the teachers up under the bleachers. First make out experience, before I got experience. Someone's student council, while others fought in bathrooms. Oh what I give to go back to the past, as I.... (Chorus). Flipping through my yearbook pages. Thinkin' it's crazy how everything changes. Silly things we used to do, I still remember how it was. Cus those days were the greatest. Flpping through my yearbook pages. Thinkin' it's a shame that everybody changes. Wish everyone I knew could stay the same just like they were. Cus change is overrated. (2ND Verse). It's four or five years later, I'm home, Christimas vacation. Ran into Michelle, head cheerleader, she's three months pregnant. Said our high school quarterback got paralyzed in an accident. He was on his way to the NFL. Whatever happened to Alvala, Victoria and heard she. Had a breakdown, fall semester second year. I hope she pulls it together and I wish I could help a friend. I wish I could reverse the hands of time, go back again. (Chorus). Flipping through my yearbook pages. Thinkin' it's crazy how everything changes. Silly things we used to do, I still remember how it was. Cus those days were the greatest. Flpping through my yearbook pages. Thinkin' it's a shame that everybody changes. Wish everyone I knew could stay the same just like they were. Cus change is overrated. (Bridge). Flipping through my yearbook pages. Thinkin' it's crazy how everything changes. Silly things we used to do, I still remember how it was. Cus those days were the greatest. (3RD Verse). Oh thinking back to my past, I wouldn't change a thing. I probably do everything exactly the same. Getting the opportunity to live it over again. I would cherish every moment, OH!. (Break). Back in the days, when I was young, I'm not kid anymore. But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again. Back in the days, when I was young, I'm not kid anymore. But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again. (Chorus). Flipping through my yearbook pages. Thinkin' it's crazy how everything changes. Silly things we used to do, I still remember how it was. Cus those days were the greatest. Flpping through my yearbook pages. Thinkin' it's a shame that everybody changes. Wish everyone I knew could stay the same just like they were. Cus change is overrated. (End). Change is overrated. Don't feel the same and. If I could go back, I'd probably do it all the same. Woo waah ooh ooh waah oh uh ooh waah oh. Change is overrated. Don't feel the same and. If I could go back, I'd probably do it all the same. Woo waah ooh ooh waah oh uh ooh waah oh. . by RAQUËL (:. (RAQUËL C. RIBEIRO)"

Just wait and see (but they don't know me). Cause I am what he wants, his girl and I love it. [Chorus]. I can't leave 'em alone. I tried that good boy game. But the dope boy's turning me on.

So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone. [Verse 2]. So when I had a good guy. He didn't do that much for me. Tried to be hard. But that he could never be. Always tell me that no one. Could compare to me. But couldn't matter when other guy was starin' at me. Now the time plays back. So everyone could. look at me. From the A to hill up in Beverly. He's so fly that he knows how to carry me. First class when they talk we don't hear. What they say. [Pre-chorus]. That he does it with the best, runs a lil less. Padding on his chest (uh huh). I like it (so what). I like it. And they say (that he's gonna hurt me). Just wait and see (but they don't know me). Cause I am what he wants, his girl and I love it (oh). [Chorus]. I can't leave 'em alone. I tried that good boy game. But the dope boy's turning me on. It's just that he know what I want. So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone. I can't leave 'em alone. I tried that game. But the dope boy's turning me on. It's just that he know what I want. So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone. [50 Cent]. The more I get the more my ambition. tells there's more. I'll move a A for that girl, I'll move. ahead on that boy. Then I flip that (double up), kick back (cuddle up). Ya friends try to confuse but you know what. My intentions are good, I can't help it I'm hood. I wouldn't change if I could, you shouldn't tell. me I should. Baby you should take. me as I am. An be happy your my girl, cause I'm happy. I'm ya man. [Bridge] [Ciara]. I can hear your call. It just takes one call. I'll come runnin', boy I promise. I will be there for you. All my heart, it belongs to you. I can't lose you, boy. I just can't leave you alone. [Chorus] [2x]. I can't leave 'em alone. I tried that good boy game. But the dope boy's turning me on. It's just that he know what I want. So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone. I can't leave 'em alone. I tried that game. But the dope boy's turning me on. It's just that he know what I want.

"paint it, black","I see a red door, I wanna paint it black. No colours any more, I want them to turn black. I seen the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes. I have to turn my head until my darkness goes. I see your lines of colours and they're all painted black. With flowers and my love both never to come back. I see people turn their heads and quickly look away. Like a new born baby just happens everyday. I look inside myself and see my heart is black. I see my red door and it has been painted black. Maybe now I'll fade away and not have to face the facts. It's not easy facing 'em when your whole world is black. No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue. I could not foresee this thing happening to you. If I look hard enough into the settin' sun. My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes. I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black. Black as night, black as coal. I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky. I see a red door, I wanna paint it black. No colours any more, I want them to turn black.

yearbook,"(1ST Verse). seems like yesterday we were hanging in the hallway. Waiting for the bell to ring then walk into class late. We had no intentions on paying any attention. Throughing notes across the room, end up in detention. Hiding from the teachers up under the bleachers. First make out experience, before I got experience. Someone's student council, while others fought in bathrooms. Oh what I give to go back to the past, as I.... (Chorus). Flipping through my yearbook pages. Thinkin' it's crazy how everything changes. Silly things we used to do, I still remember how it was. Cus those days were the greatest. Flpping through my yearbook pages. Thinkin' it's a shame that everybody changes. Wish everyone I knew could stay the same just like they were. Cus change is overrated. (2ND Verse). It's four or five years later, I'm home, Christimas vacation. Ran into Michelle, head cheerleader, she's three months pregnant. Said our high school quarterback got paralyzed in an accident. He was on his way to the NFL. Whatever happened to Alvala, Victoria and heard she. Had a breakdown, fall semester second year. I hope she pulls it together and I wish I could help a friend. I wish I could reverse the hands of time, go back again. (Chorus). Flipping through my yearbook pages. Thinkin' it's crazy how everything changes. Silly things we used to do, I still remember how it was. Cus those days were the greatest. Flpping through my yearbook pages. Thinkin' it's a shame that everybody changes. Wish everyone I knew could stay the same just like they were. Cus change is overrated. (Bridge). Flipping through my yearbook pages. Thinkin' it's crazy how everything changes. Silly things we used to do, I still remember how it was. Cus those days were the greatest. (3RD Verse). Oh thinking back to my past, I wouldn't change a thing. I probably do everything exactly the same. Getting the opportunity to live it over again. I would cherish every moment, OH!. (Break). Back in the days, when I was young, I'm not kid anymore. But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again. Back in the days, when I was young, I'm not kid anymore. But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again. (Chorus). Flipping through my yearbook pages.

Thinkin' it's a shame that everybody changes. Wish everyone I knew could stay the same just like they were. Cus change is overrated. (End). Change is overrated. Don't feel the same and. If I could go back, I'd probably do it all the same. Woo waah ooh ooh waah oh uh ooh waah oh. Change is overrated. Don't feel the same and. If I could go back, I'd probably do it all the same.
