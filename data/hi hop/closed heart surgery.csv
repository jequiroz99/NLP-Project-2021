bleeding hearts club oc chpt,"I can't deal with this pain. This pain deals with me. Hard to believe what's happend. It's such a surreal scene. Unreal to me. Still dreamin'. About your geometry. Searchin'. For courage for talkin'. So what's stoppin' me?. It takes half the time. Of memorable nights. To sit and regret. All the arguments and fights. The soft touch of her warm skin. And all the people. That she's ever been with. In this room and she's downstairs. Love and loss-does she still care. One last chance i've got i swear. I should just give up. In this room and he's upstairs. Love and loss-but i still care. One last chance we've got i swear. Please don't mess this up. Pointless discussions. Over cigarettes. Filled with regret. Picturing your sillhouette. I can't remember the fights. That you mentioned. Just the after thoughts. And sexual tensions. The natural progression. From intellectual aggression. To special attention. To your sensual sections. I needed every last word. Failin' to realize. How right i was wrong. Until you were gone. It burns in my cehst. What do i make of this mess. That i call my present. State of living. I'm trying my best. In a room full of friends. It never matters. When she's always missing. Replay the scenarios. Over and over again. Repeat em' one more time. Let 'em scream in my head. Giving up's the easy way out. And what then. What do i do now. What can i do. To her i'm dead. One last night together. Let me hold you in my arms. Look deep into my eyes. My soul is yours to harm. Place your hand on my heart. Feel the beating. All it takes is one promise. To heal the bleeding. If you leave tomorrow. My conscioinse will follow. And i'll live in this city. With a chest thats hollow. But i'll still drive you. To the airport. And carry ya bags. I want you to see the moment. You tear me in half. Six months of depression. Six months of frustration. Can you just give me. One conversation. It won't have to end. In hatred's rage. Save me, save us. Save everything we've made. The three hardest words. For me to say. 8 letters kept me. From you every single day. If it can stop you. From getting on that plane. Then fuck it, i love you. Please don't go away"
bonzai daniel son bonzai,"Hold my hand. Are you with me. Look in my eyes. And tell me. That you're with me. Love's long gone. Move along with the same. Same 'ol song. Sloppy silly with it. Morals out the window. In between birthdays surprise. With a floral show. Not a debate. Between concrete and ethics. Searchin' for a brain. In blonde streaks. And hot chicks. Dye the color darker darker. Mask the ugly. Tap the glass of my monitor. Love me. Are you awake. Are you still sleeping. Are you replaced. With a new face. When i'm dreaming. I hope so. I lost control. I still breathe heavy. Do you still breathe blow. The parks amuse me. Walkin' infinite circles. Band aids on my finger tips. Turn purple. As long as she's on my arm. I'll walk a maze. Scared me stiff. Makes me laugh. I'm amazed. First to do that. First to skip cracks. Dontcha know that. That'll break. Ya momma's back. Does Jimmy eat world. When i have you in the middle. Will i have the answers. When you have the riddles. Are you the anxious type. Reflect light crystal. See it on a face. You wanna pop that pimple. It hurts, it bleeds. Let go of me. Nothin' works to see. What you do to me. Rule everything around me. Cream. And it's still not. As easy as it seems. (Scream). Like the way you used to. Like the way i want you. Like the curves on a dagger. That tend to haunt you. So thankful for the moments. Shared between, me. And you it's cute. When you say it like you do. A real dirty mind. To a past life prude. Don't wanna stand here. I better bust a move. Grow a garden on these walls. And pluck the flowers. Make 'em dance for once. Make em move for hours. Can't avoid it. Seemed like 10 years ago. Self concious funny kid. At 15 years old. Make 'em laugh make 'em cry. Ya better than that. Make 'em horny make 'em pine. Now ya on the right track. Liftin' knees like flashdance. Water on the floor. Don't get your socks wet. I hate that shit. A little lost for romance. Let me get the door. Don't wanna lose a man bet. I hate that shit. Throw my arms up and quit. Can't handle it. Blew out the flame. Before it even got lit. Take ya medicine. Pump adrenaline. Any possible way. To clean slate the sin. So pull me out of the water. When i start to fall under. And warm me up. With the arms of my lover. Then maybe. We can get sick mother fucker. Get sick mother fucker"
fuck you delilah,"You make me sick. You fuckin' bitch. You broke my heart. And gone so far. You ain't worth shit. You cheatin' bitch. You know who you are. Can't stand the west coast. So she had to leave. I packed her bags. She moved to n-y-c. It wasn't cali livin'. Everything was a given. Wanted money, fast cars. And kristal sippin. I ain't about that. All i got is my music. It was loud n' clear. This bitch was abusive. Put up with her shit. The cheatin and lyin'. If not for l-o-v-e. I wouldn't be tryin'. Hate the late night clubbin'. Alcohol consumption. If it wasn't one thing. It was always somethin. She loves that attention. And did i mention. That i paid for her car. And the room. That we lived in. That wasn't even. Enough for you. Was it delilah. Don't even know. You did me wrong. Let me remind ya. Left me here. For a life. That's better. I'll be. Chillin in Cali. You rot. In New York weather. You make me sick. You fuckin' bitch. You broke my heart. And gone so far. You ain't worth shit. You cheatin' bitch. You know who you are. Call her Delilah. More like the liar. Cause the truth. Never seemed. To come out her mouth. She got around town. That didn't stop me. I've made mistakes. And this one cost me. lookin out for dimes. She shined bright. I picked her up tails. That's bad luck as hell. Can't stop the hate. 1000 miles apart. Hope this song reminds. How fucked up you are. How messed up. It is that you. Left me here. For 2 years. For ya dead end career. Not even worth this track. But it had to be said. what i thought was good. Was bad in the end. It was only a game. That i didn't wanna play. All i got in the end. Was a song with ya name. I know it's done. We'll never feel the same. But when it comes to us. You're the one to blame. You make me sick you. Fuckin' bitch. You broke my heart. And gone so far. You ain't worth. Shit you cheatin' bitch. You know who you are. Hey Delilah. Fuck you Delilah"
her lips destroy,"Breathe easy little girl. You're alone now. What a funny thing. To want in a small town. I don't even know. What it was behind your eyes. Was it pain, was it relief. Was it another good time. Sometimes i miss love thyne. Just to save myself. Sometimes i need my friends. Just to pull me outta hell. It's fucked up. That you smiled. At the top of the steps. How many seconds. Did it take. To turn itself into regret. Not even about sex. It was about a best friend. Having a hand to hold. Through the pain and the stress. I'm a mess. And that's not really unexpected. Things can get drab. Life can get hectic. And yeah, i thought i'd count 'em. It was only seven months. I guess i lasted longer. Than you're last good fuck. Ask me if. I wanna rendezvous to somewhere. Whatever's best for me. I know you really don't care. With my foot to the pedal. Red roses in front seat. Pluckin' off these petals. Hopin to God that she loves me. She loves me not. She thinks reclusive hits the spot. i know i didn't give you all. But i gave you what i got. i dressed in all black. For a damn good reason. Johnny Cash had a good feeling. You were leavin'. I guess it was the season. You were gettin' pretty cold. I did the same in return. Turned my heart into stone. And every monday and thursday. I won't be watching TV. I'll be regretting the day. I lost my friend. Sittin' on a big rock. As the giant sun sets. Always chasing Amy. While laying in my bed. I'm not angry or depressed. I'm a little upset. And if i ever get to hate you. Hope to god we never met. Look me in the face. You don't have a thing to say. You need to be alone. And still call me on the phone. What a complicated way. Of lookin at a new us. Well you wanna be alone. So i don't give a fuck. We were good with laughs. We were good with lust. It was too much of a good thing. I guess you'd had enough. You get what you give. And i gave you my all. Return my presents. Or you can give 'em to. Too much time on my hands. And no one to hold 'em. But please leave me alone. I'm busy at the moment. Welcome to the wonderful world. Of having nothing. No one to kiss. No one to hold or touch me. And that's just fine. I can make it right through. But brass knuckles. Couldn't knock me out. The way that you do"
music for aliens,"From the bay to the oc. Hyphie and gold teeth. Checkin' hot wifey like. I'm stealin trophies. Here to san fran. My daily plan-. -et. Got more fans. Than a rhymin superman. I pack kryptonite. For emcees that bite. I like my music fat. I'm never switchin to lite. I like to write. But i can freestyle flow. I knew this track finna clean. From the very get go. El Negro and R-O kill collabos. Drop a beat from the needle. And i can handle. Dismantle it scramble. Your guts like Rambo. Bob ya head. I know you diggin' the sample. West Coast with the most. Oh, you didn't know. Yeah, they try real hard. But they can't come close. Grab a pen and paper. Silly rappers take notes. Maybe one day. You could step to this. Bitch. From OC to the b.a.y. It's on me. When it comes to raping. I'm the recording Kobe. See i flow. So different. Make it hard to clone me. I'm hot so before. She touch this. She gotta blow me. Surgery get closed.

Announcer's yell out El Negro. Spill ink when i think. Imma micro freak. Went solo cuz my group. Broke up like n'cync. Hip hop gum drop. Blow pop punk rock. What ever it is. I'm on my toes. Like filp flops. N.e.g.r.o and rocom. Myspace got us. Connected like voltron"
plastik,"And everytime i stand. I fall back down. Bleeding, healing. Waiting to come around. And everytime i land. It hurts even more. Reaching for the handle. Of a closed door. I check the rear view mirror. Like it's got all the answers. Looking up ahead. Seems pointless i can't answer. The phone or the messages. Or any type of contact. I miss it the most. The heat from the contact. The numbers keep coming. The drummer keeps drummin'. I'm wanna start running. I'm ready to start runnin'. Chase my breath. Don't want what comes next. Comparing new people to you. And that's not the best. Of it, i loved it how. You started to cry. Reveal an ounce of loss. Before i left for the night. It was the most saw. Of a heart inside you. I've met people for a day. That hug harder than you. You're afraid, scared. Cold and alone. Singing in the same key. With a different tone. You could have said please. With a blow so low. You hit damn hard. And i'm stronger than most. And everytime i stand. I fall back down. Bleeding, healing. Waiting to come around. And everytime i land. It hurts even more. Reaching for the handle. Of a closed door. You wanna touch the bruise. You pick at the scab. You wanna break the bone. You wanna sign the cast. We did't last. And neither did this. You're worthless now. And so is a friendship. You're kiddin' yourself. With a lack of color. And remember to laugh. Everytime you stutter. With the digital toys. The clean cut boys. Your oversized coat. And robot voiced throat. How are the parties. The people and the liquor. How are the drugs. That you need to get thinner. It's all part of the deal. You without me. Me without you. Is gettin' harder to do. Still haven't got a clue. What it was this time. Like what's new with you. And who's hand replaced mine. Still can't believe. That it's come to this. Retracin' old steps. That i'm bound to miss. And everytime i stand. I fall back down. Bleeding, healing. Waiting to come around. And everytime i land. It hurts even more. Reaching for the handle. Of a closed door"
