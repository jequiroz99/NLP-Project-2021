act my age,"They say the way I act is Immature. Well don't be mad at me because you're feeling insecure. The only golf I ever tried to play was miniature. And when you ask me sign your boobs I smiley face my signature. But my parents raised me right, they were sticklers. And we don't even fight, we're like oil and some vinegar. Getting a job is like a pregnant woman giving birth. You're trying to push me in the wrong direction and it fucking hurts. So most our friends already moved out of they mama's cribs. I'm still throwing parties at my house, like stifler. So if you go around and try to tell me how to live. I'mma take your girl and mortal kombat finish her. But when it's done and the party shuts down. And the cops try to lay my ass on the ground. One day we might tell our kids, but until that day let's live like this. My friends grew up, they never get drunk. They never wanna hang out late. They're gonna get jobs, they're gonna pay bills. They're gonna get old and gray. I'll never do that, I wanna stay young. Don't wanna fit in, I wanna have fun. So if that's okay, I don't think I'm ever gonna act my age. And when it comes to getting older. No matter what I do, I'm never feeling like a grown up. People trying to make me change, you'd think there was a quota. Like there ain't enough unemployed motherfuckers with diplomas. Everybody waiting 'round hoping that they blow up. But I'mma make it sooner, oklahoma. I learned to be a player, make money like I'm an owner. These other rappers are so over the hill, word to jonah. So if you see me in a restaurant, say hi to me. And if I ask you if you like my new shit, lie to me. Word to tim roth. And I don't know if I fit in with your society. So chill, take a pill for anxiety and doze off. But when it's late and you're all alone. And you're too damn drunk to be walking home. Then maybe you should call it quits. But until that day let's live like this. My friends grew up, they never get drunk. They never wanna hang out late. They're gonna get jobs, they're gonna pay bills. They're gonna get old and gray. I'll never do that, I wanna stay young. Don't wanna fit in, I wanna have fun. So if that's okay, I don't think I'm ever gonna act my age. Oh, it's all good, it's alright, it's okay. We can live however we want. And there ain't nobody that can get in our way. Oh, it's all good, it's alright, it's okay. We gon' do whatever we want. Never gonna listen to a word you say. My friends grew up, they never get drunk. They never wanna hang out late. They're gonna get jobs, they're gonna pay bills. They're gonna get old and gray. I'll never do that, I wanna stay young. Don't wanna fit in, I wanna have fun. So if that's okay, I don't think I'm ever gonna act my age"

Looking at the world from my east side town. And we find now, I swear later will be different. She leaving me a present, but baby I am gifted. Maybe I'm a miss it like Christmas. Either way you could stay at the top of my wish list. No receipts and no return policies. And I return when the whole world follow me. Apologies to lames who couldn't get real. I'm a dreamer trying to catch it up in left field. Wit' a nanny, I be givin' her the best feel. 'Til I have her screaming out ""Oh Mr. Sheffield. [Hook:]. And I don't know and you got doubt. And maybe later on we can figure it out. And I just go and you lock down. And maybe later on we can figure it out. And I don't feel the way you do. Is there a way we'll make it through. And before this thing goes south. Baby girl let's figure it out. Let's figure it out. So does that mean I'm Immature, for sure. Then we don't need to be no more, on tour. Cause pussy is just bound to get picky. Mind set, gotta steal base like Rickey. Face like Nicky, I mean Lionel's daughter. And I'm still shallow like a fly on water. Turn your dimes into quarters. Mine if they gorgeous. Got a goldmine I'll be hoarding. Like we in Frisco, So sweet, Nabisco. Take you to the movies like Sisq√≥. Look better than your pixels in person. So let's figure out if it's really working. [Hook]. [Obey City:]. It's like what we really got to talk about (talk about). Every time we speak, we start a bout (start a bout).

So I told her that I cruise homes, yep like Suri. So I woke real early, grab a bagel and a glass of joe. The he-man, woman hater, I'm a Ras-a-cal. And Alfalfa, my hair stickin, it lost control. Cause I'm a rapper, but she more into the classical. Uh, no need to apologize. I'm 21, but I been dreamin bout the college life. So when she looks into her father's eyes, shouts to Eric Clapton.

We on the shelf now, no Sam Goody. And when you mention other dudes, they no damn Hoodie. Unh, cause we go truly hard. Stiles like Julia. And I been gifted since a youth like I'm at Julliard. When we were younger, you were cooler, you and your friends used to rule the yard. A moment flicked by. I wish I was Mcfly. Marty with the sick ride. I'm able to switch time. No second guessin decisions on why I pick sides. So ex-nay, only talkin bout my insides. Always up to somethin, so we annually home. This song is dedicated to my January Jones. And it's a Space Jam, they say that I'm Michael. Lovin' under twenty's a cycle. So here we go. [Hook: Chris Wallace]. You're so damn beautiful, my January Jones. Oh you drive me mad. And I come right back. From your head down to your toes. I want you all alone. Oh you drive me mad. And I come right back. [Verse 3: Hoodie Allen]. I throw my hand out, I'm tryna help her up. She lookin back at me, I think you helped enough. Ain't havin none of it, you gonna sit and say. No love for triple A. Okay, she's gone away. [Hook: Chris Wallace]. You're so damn beautiful, my January Jones. Oh you drive me mad. And I come right back. From your head down to your toes. I want you all alone. Oh you drive me mad. And I come right back"

100 percent of something,"I said my tour just sold out. Album's been bought out, girlfriend might put out - terrific. Oh that's the good route, shit that you dream 'bout. Now that you got it feels different. I don't need no one, no one to tell me. Everything will be alright. Hair just like elvis, hands on her pelvis. But let me delve in. I said I got a lot of dreams and you got a lot of needs. So there ain't a lot of time for me to help it. And I ain't slept in nearly 20 weeks, is that healthy?. I'm making money when I go to sleep, is that wealthy?. I'd rather talk about my self esteem but that's selfish. Lot of folks complain about the cards that you dealt me. But I'm still here shuffling the deck, yo what's come of it?. Used to know it all, now I'd rather just discover it. So fuck it, man, I said fuck it, man. Yo, fuck it, man, I'm just a lucky man. Baby I want it all. And I can't run away, don't know what to say or do anymore. She like ""oh you so worried about getting bras and shit"". Comin' to my shows just to hear applause and shit.

My life is like a circus the way these clowns have been surfacing. But you had my back, you memorized every word. Maybe bridges are meant to be burned. And when he gave you passes, I was gassed I can't lie. But I was busy living out my passions, that's why. My friend's just laugh, it's funny. The type of shit I'm mad at. 90 Is love, but all we hear is the bad. I wish I could take back the time we wasted talking 'bout you. I wish I could take back the time we wasted being mad.

act my age,"They say the way I act is Immature. Well don't be mad at me because you're feeling insecure. The only golf I ever tried to play was miniature. And when you ask me sign your boobs I smiley face my signature. But my parents raised me right, they were sticklers. And we don't even fight, we're like oil and some vinegar. Getting a job is like a pregnant woman giving birth. You're trying to push me in the wrong direction and it fucking hurts. So most our friends already moved out of they mama's cribs. I'm still throwing parties at my house, like stifler. So if you go around and try to tell me how to live. I'mma take your girl and mortal kombat finish her. But when it's done and the party shuts down. And the cops try to lay my ass on the ground. One day we might tell our kids, but until that day let's live like this. My friends grew up, they never get drunk. They never wanna hang out late. They're gonna get jobs, they're gonna pay bills. They're gonna get old and gray. I'll never do that, I wanna stay young. Don't wanna fit in, I wanna have fun. So if that's okay, I don't think I'm ever gonna act my age. And when it comes to getting older. No matter what I do, I'm never feeling like a grown up. People trying to make me change, you'd think there was a quota. Like there ain't enough unemployed motherfuckers with diplomas. Everybody waiting 'round hoping that they blow up. But I'mma make it sooner, oklahoma. I learned to be a player, make money like I'm an owner. These other rappers are so over the hill, word to jonah. So if you see me in a restaurant, say hi to me. And if I ask you if you like my new shit, lie to me. Word to tim roth. And I don't know if I fit in with your society. So chill, take a pill for anxiety and doze off. But when it's late and you're all alone. And you're too damn drunk to be walking home. Then maybe you should call it quits. But until that day let's live like this. My friends grew up, they never get drunk. They never wanna hang out late. They're gonna get jobs, they're gonna pay bills. They're gonna get old and gray. I'll never do that, I wanna stay young. Don't wanna fit in, I wanna have fun. So if that's okay, I don't think I'm ever gonna act my age. Oh, it's all good, it's alright, it's okay. We can live however we want. And there ain't nobody that can get in our way. Oh, it's all good, it's alright, it's okay. We gon' do whatever we want. Never gonna listen to a word you say. My friends grew up, they never get drunk. They never wanna hang out late. They're gonna get jobs, they're gonna pay bills. They're gonna get old and gray. I'll never do that, I wanna stay young. Don't wanna fit in, I wanna have fun. So if that's okay, I don't think I'm ever gonna act my age"
against me (feat. max),"[Intro - Max:]. Take those words that you say. Don't use them against me, against me. When I'm walking away from something gray. I know you'll try to temp me, to temp me. When our hearts can't relate no more. I want you to forget me, forget me. Sometimes it feels like a war. But know I ain't ya enemy, ya enemy. [?]. [Hook - Max:]. Bullets fly, bullets, bullets fly in the sky tonight. Bombs may burst, bombs, bombs may burst. Bullets fly, bullets, bullets fly in the sky tonight. Bombs may burst, bombs, bombs may burst. In love. [Verse 1 - Hoodie Allen:]. Party at the Malibu, trying to adjust to the elevation. Brought no car to La, so I walk cause I ain't tryna to pay for no validation, uh!. Double meaning, no, double entendre. Watching Assandra get undressed in the back of a Honda. Sometimes off on the road, it's crazy, I ponder. I see them, syke, but no relation to Wanda. I'm tryna to wonder off and dance and shit. Romance and shit, too many bops at it like them Hanson kids. But I'm so fancy cause even when you at your worst. Sometimes you'll Tokyo drift and then everything'll burst. This shit a gift and a curse the way that I analyze. I grew up wanting more, I'm never satisfied. My father told me always have my pride. Would've of worked at Burger King making fries. If it meant helping his fam survive. And now the nine-to-five, it's more like nine-to-nine. I only take a break just to talk when he on the other line. Tell him put on my mom, promise everything is fine. I've been working hard so you don't have to work all the time. That's real shit, fuck that mass appeal shit. Fuck that record deal shit, I would rather make it on my own. They say there's limitations when you're enter in that throne. But I don't think how they think, so competition is unknown. In a league of my own, no Rosie. Wolf on these beats, no Posey. Know everybody will know me. People keep on talking but there's no beef but Kobe. Fuck it, sometimes I wish that I could clone me. Cause I've been up wrestling with stuff like I'm Triple H. Only fuck with twins, I tryin' to get me a triple date. Triple A, gettin' lifted, never vacation but I'm trippin'. Off of like what everybody say. But I just gotta know what's in my heart. Because the world that type of place where people try to take your art and then they pull it all way. Some friends addicted to that Oxycontin. I've been addicted to music, so I fuckin' forgot them. I should of been there when the ambulance respondin'. But I was probably on a plane, sellin' tickets out in Boston. Another show at the House of Blues, this place is hella packed. And kids been waiting since 6 A. M. just to see me rap. But how the fuck you gonna compete with an animal. I got the hunger, I'm overthrowing the capitol. These muhfuckers talk about me at they shows. But then they love me when we standing toe-to-toes. How's that rational?. Fake shit, I don't need that real blood. Homie bleed that I don't even mean to go and make it violent. But when you say something, stand behind it. All I got's my word in this life, so I write it. [Outro - Max:]. Take those words that you say. Don't use them against me, against me. When I'm walking away from something gray. I know you'll try to temp me, temp me. When our hearts can't relate no more. I want you to forget me. Sometimes it feels like a war. But know I ain't an enemy, an enemy"

Chicks be getting feisty 'cause they fighting for the best guy. Yeah I'm bumping Biggie but I've never been to Bedstock. Counting out my money in a shoebox at my bedside. That's old school, no city bank. Got another girl, all she listens to is Chitty Bang. Everyone around me keep complaining that the city change. Listening to serious radio with the silly face.

Texts don't blow up. Heads so big that my neck won't show up. But, I'm up an' adam, keep on moving 'til the deal. Got a super bad broad but she doing Jonah Hill. And my suit is half off and my ties all knotted. These hippies really love me because my buzz all hypnotic. They pick me at the market stick their pitchforks on it. Then they stick me in the garbage like the shit's gone rotting. Man I'm sick to my stomach so I guess I'm Johnny Appleseed. Once happening the way I go and tackle bees,.

Mum said I should've stayed in school - Degrassi. Sorry Drizzy I just made it to the college path. But things ain't even adding up like it was college math. So gimme a minute to figure and I holla back. Where the non-believers, fuck 'em, I never acknowledge that. Knocking on the door. Jehovah's my witness. And I'm forever gone so Hova will witness.

When you don't really know how the future will turn out. I been in school so they one thing that I learned now. Is that all the work I'm putting in will equal what I earn out. And that's just economics in the perfect universe. A place where every girl I meet is saying you the first. And the crowd is singing with me like they knew the verse. Thank the lord for gravity - it's grabbing me into the Earth. So even though I wanna be a star sun. I can never leave my town like a pardon. Because it made me who I am - Bar none. Tell Long Island I'm a burn it down like arson. So we can raise it back up like it's our son. Make 'em play our song every day like it's parson. Came a long way but I still feel far.

Robbing you rappers, I'm leaving them batshit crazy. Looking at her ass like ""baby damn! "" that's an appropriate caption. Friends get me out, cause her ass a distraction man. And now everybody in there stopping like a traffic jam. I know you wanna. Get it on the low. Don't be afraid, I'll never let him know. I can give it to you like you never had before. I don't mean to offend you, but this is something special. Can't keep it confidential anymore. I just need to tell somebody. Tell me if you got somebody else"
hey now,"[Verse 1]. Designated driver but I'm drinking till my wallets closed. This right here that's rock and roll, you just call it rocky road. Sorry Mr. ocifer, okay I meant officer. But all these shots just turn me to a gossiper. Tmz, binoculars and knocking on my window like I'm popular. All I see is red lights, ain't nobody stopping ya. You must be confused, I don't think you read the news much. I'm a rasta monster on the beat, Luis Guzman. [Chorus]. And I feel like I'm drinking for the first time, ain't no medicine to keep my head from spinning. And I feel like I'm drinking for the first time so let me take you back to the beginning. I mean like way back. You get love and I make dap. My facenodes cost pesos. These girls coming like asap. So stay strap, stay good. They hating on what we could've been. And I'm backpacking through Brooklyn. We made this song we good again. Hey now, hey now. You been fucking up my day now, day now. I just gotta find a way out, way out. I don't want to go home, home. Hey now, hey now. Oh I'm finally getting paid now, paid now. I got models you can take out, take out. I don't want to go home, home. [Verse 2]. Girls be in the club trying to sing along to Taio Cruz. Swear they know like every word, but they cant even tie their shoes. I'm amused. My music is influenced by the muses. I'm confused, did you think I liked you for your new kicks. High heels, low chance. A little bit of love and a slow dance. And we are trying to grow up so fast. That we don't really know that what we got is romance. And don't you brag keep it hush, you know that this love can die. Turn it up a little bit what you hear is something silent. [Chorus]. And I feel like I'm drinking for the first time, ain't no medicine to keep my head from spinning. And I feel like I'm drinking for the first time so let me take you back to the beginning. I mean like way back. You get love and I make dap. My facenodes cost pesos. These girls coming like asap. So stay strap, stay good. They hating on what we could've been. And I'm backpacking through Brooklyn. We made this song we good again. Hey now, hey now. You been fucking up my day now, day now. I just gotta find a way out, way out. I don't want to go home. Hey now, hey now. Oh I'm finally getting paid now, paid now. I got models you can take out, take out. I don't want to go home, home. [Verse 3]. And tomorrow's never promised. I said I'm tired of being honest. You just trying to pick my brain. And I'm just trying to pick your wallet. And I'm gonna walk away. 'Cause I know the way. That we live today. Ain't Orthodox. It's getting late. But we all awake. And we talking loud so just call the cops. And make us stop, if you can. You can try to ring us up. Set up a perimeter but we ain't ever been in love. I gotta couple minutes left, maybe I should live it up. But this time, it's time you should give up. This time, it's time, give it up, give it up [x4]. [Chorus]. Hey now, hey now. You been fucking up my day now, day now. I just gotta find a way out, way out. I don't want to go home. Hey now, hey now. Oh I'm finally getting paid now, paid now. I got models you can take out, take out. I don't want to go home, home"
high again,"All I want to do. Is sit and wait for you. Are you movin' ahead. Am I fallin' behind. Fuck it, probably either way, it's probably all in my mind. You got all that you want. I got nothin' but time. Honestly all we want is somebody to grind with. In a junior high prom, probably regrettin' my haircut. And the color of my tie, let's photoshop it and airbrush. As long as the girl with me is more fly than air miles. I'm a be a happy camper with nothin' to care about. Damn, well put, that's the way it goes. I know you say that you love him, but that was days ago. I moved to London and tried to find me a Daisy Lowe. I mean it can't be that hard to find a crazy hoe. She high up on the Macy floor, I'm flowin' in my fast car. You want to watch the world end in my backyard. We go in circles, that's Nascar. Only you get me high, high, high. High again. Leavin' your smell on my clothes. I think that I'm losin' my mind again. Baby, don't leave me alone. You get me high, high, high, high. Are you goin' with him, am I takin' you home. Fuck it, probably either way, I end up alone. You got all that you want, I got nothin' to show. Honestly all we want is somebody to bone, so. Can I get your phone number, your credit card, and your passport. You gave me this crude face like why did I ask for it. My plane to the Uk, but I didn't pack for it. If this is a layup, then where is the backboard. A sinful investigation is makin' me unretired. I'm with you, I'm suffocating, my lungs are like fuckin' fire. There isn't an explanation you wouldn't try to get me high. Nobody's gonna keep me down. (You get me high again). My feet are floatin' off the ground. (You get me high again). And every time that you're around. I'll be down to stay by your side. Only you can get me this high"

january jones,"[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]. Unh. Pardon my small talk. Darlin' I'm all talk. They wanna fence me in, never a ballpark. We tear the walls off the Waldorf Astoria. I told my dudes to get to steppin' like Gloria. I made my case, she a slept-on jury. And when I go from deep I be like Stephen Curry. The lines'll hit you sharp, it got the teflon worried. So I told her that I cruise homes, yep like Suri. So I woke real early, grab a bagel and a glass of joe. The he-man, woman hater, I'm a Ras-a-cal. And Alfalfa, my hair stickin, it lost control. Cause I'm a rapper, but she more into the classical. Uh, no need to apologize. I'm 21, but I been dreamin bout the college life. So when she looks into her father's eyes, shouts to Eric Clapton. I'll be the director, cause I'm all about the action. [Hook: Chris Wallace]. You're so damn beautiful, my January Jones. Oh you drive me mad. And I come right back. From your head down to your toes. I want you all alone. Oh you drive me mad. And I come right back. [Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]. You say I'm spellbound. I hardly spell out. The four letters that make every girl just melt down. We on the shelf now, no Sam Goody. And when you mention other dudes, they no damn Hoodie. Unh, cause we go truly hard. Stiles like Julia. And I been gifted since a youth like I'm at Julliard. When we were younger, you were cooler, you and your friends used to rule the yard. A moment flicked by. I wish I was Mcfly. Marty with the sick ride. I'm able to switch time. No second guessin decisions on why I pick sides. So ex-nay, only talkin bout my insides. Always up to somethin, so we annually home. This song is dedicated to my January Jones. And it's a Space Jam, they say that I'm Michael. Lovin' under twenty's a cycle. So here we go. [Hook: Chris Wallace]. You're so damn beautiful, my January Jones. Oh you drive me mad. And I come right back. From your head down to your toes. I want you all alone. Oh you drive me mad. And I come right back. [Verse 3: Hoodie Allen]. I throw my hand out, I'm tryna help her up. She lookin back at me, I think you helped enough. Ain't havin none of it, you gonna sit and say. No love for triple A. Okay, she's gone away. [Hook: Chris Wallace]. You're so damn beautiful, my January Jones. Oh you drive me mad. And I come right back. From your head down to your toes. I want you all alone. Oh you drive me mad. And I come right back"

look up,"[Hook:]. Why would anyone wanna be stopping me. When I'm trynna be good. I'm just trynna be. And I feel like the whole world is sitting right down on top of me. But I'm trynna be good. I'm just trynna be in heaven. A whole lot of obstacles there in front of me. But I'm trynna be good. I'm just trynna be good. I'm just trynna be good. I'm just trynna be. I want the people who made me to feel they could be proud. And I'll look back on their decisions like they pulling out. Wool over my eyelids. I thrive in the silence. I'm using my blinker signal. I'm trynna get by and. Change lanes to a different destination. It be like the longer that I wait. The less I develop patience. But hey thats natural. In a world full of entitlement. You know I'm Making Waves. What happens when the title hits?. I'll be cool with all Imma get. I'm not trynna be picky. But my fam giving me hell. Little Nicky. And I just play it straight. I wonder why you tricky. And I remember watching Stick Stickly. (Watchin-watching Stick Stickly). In my younger days and now my mom just wonders where that kid is. And I wish so bad I had an answer but I didn't. That's so wack, [?] crack. Little when I realize. I only get one shot at a real life. I had met some girls they were real nice. But it didn't feel right. They thought I'm Pinocchio. Fuck it I'm a real guy. [Hook]. And that's the state of things. Don't know what the day will bring. All that glitters isn't always made of bling. And she likes the finer things. Designer jeans, and diamond rings. I like the late night diner burgers. Fries and then a side of drinks (ching!). Ring me up, I got minutes. Mortal Kombat, I got finished. But my aim was to be winning. And it can be so humble when you start at the beginning. Driving round the town, windows down, now you singing. ""I don't wanna be myself. I don't need none of your help"". You know that rebel same team. Dressin' up like you James Dean. Lucky that we had Bay teams. Growing up but I hate dreams. What ever had happened to my faith?. Left mainstream. Y'all killing the game. But you claimin' you been framed, please. I'm Roger Rabbit. Just swallowin' my habits. They come in small tablets. And these groupies love to grab it. No it's not magic. No it's not a game. I'm just hoping that it's different. Cause I hate when it's the same. I'm screaming to yall. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You just checked out Making Waves. Courtesy of us. The boys at Hoodie Allen. I hope you enjoyed it. See you back soon. Until then we out"

And when I get there I'm a bounce, bounce, bounce, bitch bounce. I'm a bounce, bounce, bounce, bitch bounce. I'm a bounce, bounce, bounce, bitch bounce. I'm a bounce, bounce, and I don't ever wanna come down. Fuck your bitch I'm Kelsey grammar,. Talking all that bull I can't understand ya. She like pity parties I like witty banter. Ask me if I'm dumping her and reply with a shitty answer. And this is how it escalates. Driving around the town let's pretend we're in the Escalade. Skinny jeans and skinny love, no wonder that I'm extra late. I didn't wanna be so rude but I just had to make my case. She wanna go now I say take steps. She wanna lay down I want safe sex. Paid now, I don't take checks. Ask me to go down, I say rain check. Hands around my mouth, I don't take breaths. So I know I am do it till the day that I'm a pass out. You just always been the type to go and take the fast route. Ain't no need to talk about it, you'd rather lash out. Ok let's moon bounce baby, let me blast out. And I don't know if I am too late. Take a chance, make my case. For all this shit, just falls in place. I should say, baby would you like to moon bounce?. Cause I ain't seeing nothing but stars. Maybe we can move out, taking you to where you belong. Cause all we do is moon bounce, moon bounce. Cause I ain't seeing nothing but stars. She just told me to move out, move out. I'm packing up and going to Mars. And when I get there I'm a bounce, bounce, bounce, bitch bounce. I'm a bounce, bounce, bounce, bitch bounce. I'm a bounce, bounce, bounce, bitch bounce. I'm a bounce, bounce, And I don't ever wanna come down. And I don't ever wanna come down."

passing me by in '09 (feat. illustrate),"Passin' Me By 2009 right. It's Hoodie, Illa, Pharcyde. Yeah we about to kill it. [Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]. Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag. When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag. Wack, my backpack bigger than my body was. My Spanish teacher always telling me to adios. Out of the class cause I couldn't keep from talking. I my converse kicks, they lighting up when I was walking. To the principals office, I'm nauseous. Then I saw this pretty little thing and she was gorgeous. Had to make a move I was on this. So very nice to meet you. She told me she was new to school. I came at her like ""me too"". And that was just a lie for the hell of it. Plus we're at the age where the breasts are developing. So I say whatever just to relish in the moment that we had. Cause it's sad, the day I took her over to my pad. She met friend Chad and that's a terrible mistake. Cause the second that I turned around he asked her for a date. Like wait, hold up, now way. [Hook:]. She keeps on passing me by. (Never the less, I'll say it again). [Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]. And when I dream of something good. I think of me and Allie. Cause she was from the hood. But when she spoke it's like the valley. And no we're not in Cali. But like how was I to judge her. When the way that she flirted. Made me think I'm gonna fuck her. She was like no other. I just hope that she can see me. When the other though of me. As their little brother, Stevie. I'm the youngest in the class. So I'm her youngest suitor. And then she came right up to me. And said she need a tutor. All I could do is stare. Which had a project for the class. But I swear I didn't care. Now she had a bone to pick. But I swear that I was over it. I'm hoping it will happen. But I think I need a prayer. To get the Ugg boots off her feet and the tights. And then the cut-off shoulder hoodie, it'll be over tonight. Although it's getting real late, I made a move to her zone. Cause I won't have to hear about her go and taking me home. I said ""I get my learner's permit soon, I'm passing my road test"". And she was trying to block it when she thinkin' she knows best. Oh yes, I could tell we wanted the same. Except she wanted my brain. And I just wanted some brains. Oh my bad, it must've been a miscommunication. She said ""when you get older kid, damned if I'd be waiting"". So now I'm always skating, that day me an asshole. So now when girlies come on by, I'm telling them to pass low. [Hook]. Woo! It's Illustrate, what?. It's Illustrate or Hoodie Allen. Here we, here we, here we, here we, here we go!. [Verse 3: Illustrate]. They keep on passin' me by askin' why. I said but don't say Konichiwa. Now you see why. I can't but help but break a sweat over these divas. Jesus, help me when my speech flutters into a deep smother. Peep how much I lover but still than I'd say I fuck her. Got little game man, I'm dressing very basic. This one girl compared my attitude to Larry David. She incurred my first try, thought I learned my lesson. But her style so fly, that I wrote in instant message. My dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, you will not blow me. But you show me very well you would delve right into me. If I was G, but now you see, I'm not into any of that shit. I though that she was a queen, but now I see that she's a. I wish that I was farsighted like Pharcyde. Never been a smart guy, I'll deny these bizarre rides. Cause girls talk trash, love only the cash. Got no class so I had to let her pass. [Hook. Keeps passin' me by. She keeps passin' me by. [x3]"
people keep talking,"I'm gonna talk when I wanna talk. I don't need the long distance to plan this shit. Did it on my own with no management. Must be why nobody can manage him. A&r's always want to take advantages. Find a poor kid, sell him on a fantasy. But I've always been way above the average. That's why nobody else can compare to me. Other rappers don't offend me. Cause I got more drive than a bentley. In the driveway with a hemmy, dream girl rossum. I'm just tryna get an emmy. Fuck that, I just wanna get a grammy. Then add three more for my family. Got a plan but I never had a plan b. If you think you'll fail then you might as well drive in a camry. And I may never get the cover of that rolling stone. Didn't fit the vibe they were going for. But it's xxl, but I couldn't excel. They said we really don't get it but we're wishing you well. Oh well, lol, ain't got time for no print. Fame come and go when you rhyming so shit. Ain't gotta sign on no dotted line. But if I do, fuck you for criticizing. When I pick up the phone, they don't even call back. They just leave me a voicemail.

I'm just trying to be like jordan, I'm tired of being pippen. I've been coming off the bench and watching my haters get it. It's a young jake gyllenhaal, drop the beat cause I kill 'em all. Grab a seat cause I fill them all. Go hard motherfucker, ain't a pen involved. Y'all try to get up any way that you can. Step on the back of your favorite fan. Charging like 50 to take a quick picture. You scummy ass rappers are not in demand. And you certainly ain't in it for love. I'm just saying this shit cause it's true. I know that all of y'all wanted a bus cause the image important to you. Well I guess that's human nature. Selfish motherfuckers never do you favors. Till they all get dropped and they sent to waivers. Go shop get shelved like it's lord and taylor (what?). I'm the man in the city, well I guess that'd make you the miss. These rappers are acting all over the mic nowadays and they ain't ludacris. You tell me you hate I exist while your girlfriend is grooving to all of my songs. She made you a spotify playlist and there ain't no room for you dog?. Cause they be calling my phone but you already know. I be hitting ignore cause you late. I just throw it away, I don't care what they say at all. Cause people keep talking, people keep talking. But I don't hear nothing when people keep talking. ""Hello? Um hi I just wanna tell you if you're listening. You're my favorite artist ever, and I just so far and. You're just so amazing and I love your song 'no interruption'. And oh my God 'two lips' oh my God I can't wait. For the new music to come out and um I was really wondering. Will you follow me in instagram? Um [?] oh my God yes. And you have to come back to wisconsin because I made you. A bracelet and um oh my God I'm so nervous I'm sorry I'm like. A little girl okay um I gotta go take shit but it was really great.

sirens (feat. alex wiley),"[Verse 1 - Hoodie Allen:]. Check it. Started at the bottom like I'm looking at her booty. Asking me for money, I'm a blow it like I'm Hootie. Buffalo, where you find me, throwing Bills like I'm Flutie. She a product of the nineties, I'm a show her like I'm Truman, ooh. 'fore the night is over, she will beso me, muah. Got your girlfriend so obsessed with me, that Cecily strong. Making all of these bangers for girls who look like Topanga. Who grew up in Staten Island, banging 36 Chambers. Ya listening to history in the making now. Trying to retire at thirty with a vacation house. That money funny like Jefferson on a twenty. Ivy League like I'm hangin' out with Beyonc√© and Jeezy now. Swaggin', I can see you impress. She on her knees and she ain't trying to confess. Save me the stress, ya girl already say I'm the best. She came to my show just to get my name on her chest. [Hook - Hoodie Allen:]. Call 9-1-1. Tell the operator she ain't lookin' for a player. We can have some fun. We could be together from now until whenever. Just call me up. And I'll put out the fire that be burning inside. We can roll in my ride and make the sirens go. She make the sirens go. [Verse 2 - Hoodie Allen:]. Working cause I love it, do it for my people. Words are like my ammo, bang, bang, reload. Watch me as I freak flows, ball hard on these beats though. Used to take the bus, now I whip it like I'm Devo. Nowadays we sittin' court side at every Knicks game. Close enough to go and hand Carmelo my mixtape. Models in my phone book, bout to make a mistake. Tell'em spread the love like we living in the sixties. My friends say that my life is like a movie dog. I'm bangin' actress after actress like they groupies dog. She think I'm James Bond, you just an afterthought. These rappers beggin' for any song in my catalogue. Working nine-to-five, but the opposite. Killing it so much, they bout to build me a monument. Tell her ""we can do it in the dorm room of your colleges. And she can rock my muthafucking world or earn an scholarship. [Hook - Hoodie Allen]. [Verse 3 - Alex Wiley:]. Okay, I know it's frowned upon, but I'm [?]. [?] in a text, I got your bitch in it, don't mention it. Those who want the D and I appreciate the sentiment. Can't afford to own it, I'm just leasing it and renting it. Cause I am not cuffing shit, I am not no odd boy. I'm more like a hot boy, Gucci leather socks boy. Fin dripping in the kitchen whippin' up the box toy. I get it for the low, I bet you get it for a lot boy. Last night at the Trump towers taking drunk showers. At the airport, they went through my bag and found a bunch of weed that was not ours. If it's not reeking than it's not sour. Smoke in her face, you don't need a vase for these bouquet, then buy flowers. [Hook - Hoodie Allen]. [Phone ring:]. Hey, Hoodie! What's going on man? Todd Ferman calling over from Gigantic Records. Man we just listened to your project, I got a bunch of writers up here, every one in the office is flippin' out. Man, I just wanted to call ya and let you know that we really, really love it, but we just wanna, you know, take it that next level. First thing I would want to do with you is get you a little bit more matured. Throw on a bowtie every now and then, carry a cane around, and wear a grey wig. But other than that, we really love it. Please call me when you get a chance. Once again, Todd Ferman, Gigantic Records. We love your album but we really want to change everything"
small town,"She in the city, but. She from a small town. High heels, tall shots. Make her fall down. Up late, now she running with the fast crowd. But she call me every night before she pass out. I don't wanna waste my time with. Girls who rolling they eyelids. Girls who looking for a place to stay. 'Cause they came away from Long Island. I don't wanna make your mind up. I'm just tryna make you mine quick. But ever since I put you in my line-up. All I do is choke: Heimlich. Good girl in a bad dress. But ain't nothing really changed but your address. You in the Upper West Side. You were thinking other people that never would've accepted all your assets. But I'm cash cheques and you cash poor. I'm a give you anything that you ask for.

I don't know what's next for us. But every time I talk it's like I messed it up. People wanna tell me that I'm too honest. Walking on eggshells, two omelets. And I know that it's hard 'cause you left your town. Dad don't call like he let you down. You don't wanna talk when the sun is out. But if we get a little drunk, then it's all allowed. And the truth comes down, it's pouring pouring. Bout to drop bombs like Warren Moon. Color of your skin be orange, orange. Aren't you the girl that I met last June?. Who was so damn fun man, where did she go?. On vacation: Puerto Rico. Grand Theft Auto when your heart like Niko. Trying to meet your mother like I'm Jason Segel. You ain't fooling us. You from a Small Town. You ain't fooling us. You from a Small Town. I can take you anywhere on a map. I can make it all good, you can make me come back. You keep moving, I can find you on a map. I can take you back home, you can make me come back. You in Atlanta, but you from a small town. You in Chicago, but you from a small town. You move to L. A. , but you from a small town. You live in Brooklyn but I know you from a small town. You ain't fooling us. You from a Small Town. You ain't fooling us. You from a Small Town. Yeah, all across the globe. Uh, and every town you know. Yeah, you ain't foolin' us"
so much closer,"[Chorus: x2]. I need you so much closer. I need you na na now. I need you na na now. I know we got a ways to go, but lately I've been feeling like. We're so much closer. I don't wanna wait no more, I'm hung up on you. I'm like a poster. And this is how I take the flow, cause we going. Up and down and they calling it a coaster. But I don't want to take it slow, I'm doing. All the shit that I thought we supposed to to to to let you know. That this is real, and I mean it. Take you to an island, but no, not Revis. Gotta steal your heart and you know I'm not thieving even. If I foul up, never will I ref that. We've been cookin' up this cam like a meth lab. All the other people, never would I stress that. Cause you a cutie and I need you in my death cab. [Chorus x4]. I know we got a ways to go, but lately I've been feeling like. I'm chasing planets. And you never change your clothes, but you always. Seem to go and change your status. So I'm just tryna let you know that it's so unneeded baby. Cause you the baddest. But I don't want to take it slow, you drive. Me like ford is-automatic. I-I-I-it might mean if you my addiction then I just feen. And ever since the day you've been likin' me. I'm assembling these lines like a height machine. No kathy lee, we don't need a sweatshop. Cause every time we drop a track, people get hot. And I've been aiming for the top like a headshot. Even when aiming for your heart was my best shot. [Chorus x4]. [Rocky Business:]. I'm not saying I wouldn't ever do it again. But I hope that you'll be there when I open the door. And I swear that I'm trying hard to call you a friend. But I'm sorry I can't wait no more more more more. I'm sorry I can't wait no more more more more. I'm sorry I can't wait no more more more more. I'm sorry I can't wait, oh what the hell I sayin'. You know that I would wait because.... [Chorus]"
song for an actress,"Kick it with that new girl, eatin my Chipotle. Yeah we getting married, I don't care what all them hoes say. Rap Zac Efron, all we do is roleplay. Screaming dios mio, yeah that must be cause I'm olay. All that in a bag of chips, pass the guacamole. We just getting started babe imagine what I don't say. Every conversation is a chance for me to outwit. Do you feel that little spark, outlet, ow shit. So I don't need the press, I don't want a interview. I'm trynna lay you down, you just trynna Witherspoon. Take you somewhere private so that I can get a interview. With a vampire that's True Blood up in the room. So have you heard the gossip girl.

The world outside is, oh so cold (So Cold!). Late at night when you're alone. Do you think about me now that I'm gone?. When I'm on the road I often dream. And think of you (You know I'm thinking of you). Girl, I hope that you do too. Shouts to Roger Ebert, Shouts to Emma Roberts. I think that you're a cutie, but I'd rather have you out first. Take you to the movies, I can't wait until you're Starburst. Put me in a suit and a pair of dirty converse. I'm flyer than a mothafucka, pretty with her hair up. Bitches wanna play the field, so I just call them Airbud. All these rappers talk inside the box like an airduct. And I can switch it up and sing, now go and get your hands up. Every speaker blast, so it's a Witchproject. You gone drop up on the people like a Witchproject. I be doing it for free until I'm rich, God Bless. Ask me how that works and I admit, it's complex. Well, not like the magazine, ok well actually. I'm Lindsay Lohan cause I swear I'm only acting mean. Pay my dues and slap the beat, for everyone responsible. Swag coming out of my fucking nostrils, hostel. I don't know but I been told. The world outside is, oh so cold (So Cold!). Late at night when you're alone. Do you think about me now that I'm gone?. When I'm on the road I often dream. And think of you (You know I'm thinking of you). Girl, I hope that you do too. I-been-all-A-lone. They can't bring me down. I'm-waiting-by-the-phone.

She said it's her time, I asked whens mine. I said boy I'm tryin' to windle your money like Ben Stein. So I just circle back, I built 'em the Venn Die. You know they figure, the figures every man lies.. And every girl cheats, so let up of both us. And then try to cover up and you would try to pull Leann Rhymn.. So fuck it, I bailed,. Yup, let me leave for the night though.. Room full of nice suits, American Pyscho. Aight though, let me say a toast,. Pull the glasses out.. Now pour the gasoline, put the fucking matches out.. I asked her, ""Where to sleep? "". She pointed ""that's the couch"". I heard it on the street, and I ain't have to ask around.. 'Cause news travels real fast 'round these parts,. So if you jump the gun, you never get it to restart.. You say love is fun, you must have been a retard.. We only looking for somewhere to be part, until we on fire.. [Chorus:]. Hand's up put them high to the sky,. Let me set your soul on fire tonight.. Not, not, we not tryin' to fight,. Let me set your soul on fire tonight.. We live fast ain't time for wakin' up. I make time, then we be breakin' up.. So ask God, give me one more try,. Let me set your soul on fire.. [Verse 2:]. Rollin' out of my bed, taking longer then I'm s'pposed tah. With so many girls they actin' like they already home, so. You ever see a model in the morning? Get your hopes up.. She went from Heidi Klum into having close-ups.. And now that I assume, everybody takin' posters and glamour shots. We turnin' fake the second they turn the camera on.. Waitress' waitin' for their break like Cameron Diaz,. We spaz on drugs Tiama on,. We bad, like Mike, I am the king of the Camelot.. We grab every chance, somehow now man Lebron. Feed that, uh, there is to much heat in the Amazon.. Read that like as I may be coming back, like I never was,. Trophies as a kid, there ain't no room to make my shelf fit.. Just because I want it all, doesn't mean I'm selphish.. Never really listened 'til my eardrums melted.. Uh, Van Gogh, Van Kicks, Van pelt that fire!. [Chorus:]. Hand's up put them high to the sky,. Let me set your soul on fire tonight.. Not, not, we not tryin' to fight,. Let me set your soul on fire tonight.. We live fast ain't time for wakin' up. I make time, then we be breakin' up.. So ask God, give me one more try,. Let me set your soul on fire.. [Outro:]. Hands up, put them, hands up put them,. Hands up put them high to the sky.. Hands up, put them, hands up put them,. Hands up put them high to the sky.. Hands up, put them, hands up put them,. Hands up put them high to the sky.. Hands up, put them, hands up put them,. Hands up put them high to the sky.. I will set your soul,. I will set your soul."
sticks and stones,"You won't hear me creepin' up on you.... Hell No. Yep, I bring out my chick out to Ibiza. Just to grab a slice of pizza. Put my Cd in her speaker.

Till we bag 'em up. I live in a secret world like Alex Mack. So you don't have to drag it up. Writin' 'till there's noone left like Agatha. Christie, pretend little Indian girls all miss me. They build me up and fix me. Throw me out like I'm a frisbee. But my whole team got that distance. And your whole team might be history. So please show me all that money (money).

I'm first in class, a prodigy. Orders at me, my mobb's so deep, I'm Prodigy. Hitting me with stick and stones don't bother me. I ignore the wannabe's cause honestly they're not what I would wanna be. So part of me, please let me exit through the gift shop. My motivation is never waiting for shit to pop. Got some new friends, where they go when the hit stop. Time's kinda funny, let me trap it in my wristwatch. Watch. Watch what's next. Cable television, chicken pox, and stress. Groupie love is kinda like obnoxious sex. Cause I love myself and yeah, that's that. So we can wait until we go and make it major league. Celebratin' with people who are secretly hatin' me. My neighbors, they just wave at me, they're nice, they are my favorite. Peeps. They never tell me keep the noise down when my neighbor sleeps. Well, that's the hard labor, and I ain't into that. So fuck money, I'm a put this on the internet. Donde eres, tu girlfriend, she's in my bed. Why isn't she with you? She isn't into that. Uh, yeah, I'm bilingual.

Like I'm climbin up a steep tree. Oooh come and greet me. After the show, after the lights, after the shine. After the hoes, half of them yours, half of em mine. Happen to find they grill me but I'm the chef you want. Once you get a little taste I'm a buy the restaurant. Sittin at the top synonym, upper echelon. Busy watching my life, stop, I can get you one.

Cause I leap years everytime you fall back. To where you came from. Now where the hate go?. Oh you from wu-tang?. Then why's your face ghost?. Bottle up my confidence and sell it by the case load.

the real thing,"Super duper early morning sunday breakfast. Ain't in a rush to go to church because I used protection. You complain about the way I cooked your eggs. I'll probably hang up the phone and then - hello? - disconnected. But check it, that's just a metaphor. I'm talking if you left your man then you'd be better off. The game I spit is sweeter than a bag of kettle corn. My name is hoodie allen but I'm here to take your sweater off. And I'mma do whatever it takes to make us a pair. You wanna travel around the world, well I'm taking you there. I met a bunch of mean girls like lacey chabert. Busy talking shit but they ain't stopping to look in the mirror.

Tryna take you out the clouds, bring you down to life. I think that she like me, she like me. And she think that it might be, it might be. The real thing but we moving too fast. I think that she like me, she like me. And she think that it might be, it might be. True love but we let it all fade. Cause I just ain't ready baby. Treat me like I'm the man with a couple hundred grand. And a family full of cousins with a couple uncle sams. Tryna gamble away my money, that's funny like douglas yancey. Wanna paint a perfect picture, they'll probably think that I'm banksy. But I might die trying to afford it. I'm living in the studio, everything is recorded. My life is like a song and stuck on fucking repeat. And I'm making the same mistakes that you only make in your sleep. That must mean I'm in a dream world. But I'm sleepwalking until I find a dream girl. I got these teen girls screaming like I'm out of a magazine. Next to harry and justin, nobody fucking with me girl. Switch it, do I make you mad when I talk about shit that I envision?. Are my dreams too big? Do you think I'll sink or swim with these fishes?. So you could let me down easy. Cause it's hard to let go when you the only good that I know, you know?. I think that she like me, she like me. And she think that it might be, it might be. The real thing but we moving too fast. I think that she like me, she like me. And she think that it might be, it might be. True love but we let it all fade. Cause I just ain't ready baby. Hi, it's me... Wondering where the hell you are. You said you were gonna call me and I still. Haven't heard from you. You know, it's not that hard to just send me. A text and say hi. I understand you're working hard on this album. Right now, but you need to make the time for me. And you need to start re-evaluating your priorities. Hope you're having a good night"

Oh yeah, the drinks on me,. We can mess around if you stay low key.. All these other women say they know me. But shh, tighten up, just tighten up. [x2]. If you stay down,. When I see kids I remember. When we lived on the playground.. Now we livin in the sky cause we plane bound,. But I don't ever break rules I only break sound.. I'm on my take out,. Can't choose just try me.. Big money budget: I love it like Pat Riley.. I ain't never bought but these labels don't wanna sign me,. I'd rather not talk; insert smiley.. You're too good for me, there's no question. So I came into your dorm like a freshman.. Tell em I ain't trying to leave though the exit,. Because I dream big, let me Inception.. So my head spin we don't even break dance..

Can't stop, just hold me.. Big money budget I love it like Bon Jovi.. Hittin up the track so we never be gettin cold feet.. Going for the gold, Shaq and kobe.. Stay good like a charity,. And I won't ever get drained like a battery.. But I do beat up the beat like a battery.. Oh you love the double meaning?. Don't flatter me.. And the girls that real messy, they Tara Reid.. I read their mind, Tarot read.. Cards get drawn, lives get on,. Telling I'm revin up their engine on the Camry.. [Chous]"

Now, I got a buzz bigger than Google Earth. All my fans are virgins, let me get a word in. I ask him who they favorite is, they screaming ""You the first"". I like to hear that, hear that. They been telling my we're back, we're back. In business, but now a days who isn't. Treat it like a holiday every time you visit. Don't be dumb and fall in love with an actress. She ask what room Ewing, Patrick. And now I'm always on top, like a fasten. Get up on my level, where you at bitch?. I take all my days, And rewind them back. Throw it all away, And let the real shit last. I take all my days, And rewind them back. Throw it all away, And let the real shit last. Standing at the top of the world yelling Geronimo. From the top of my lungs, made it on to the honor roll. Your boy made it, the education was worth it. I know you paying for dinner, but let me pay for desert. It's the most that I can do, and the least that you deserve. I can't afford a lot, but I can give you my word. Word, it's real talk, but they be saying we average. Get up on my level, where you at bitch?"
turn the city around,"Every nights the same. Every, every nights the same shit. The same shit, t-the same shit. [Hook:]. I see the same faces dancing in the crowd. She ain't ever giving it all. And I ain't got it all (all!). But I want it now (now, now!). Lets turn the city around. Yeah, yeah Woe is me, all these tracks I'm going in. They call it poetry, I am Edgar owning it. So I just fly like ravens and you caged and alone. I'm done with kiddie games but you Raven Symone. So I'm saving the throne watch it when I storm through. And I took over the universe from my dorm room. Bet I stand out like a high school recruit. Y'all stand in when you learning to shoot. That means I'm earning my loot before the big leagues. Everybody biting me like Seigfried dig me. [Hook]. Because. [Hook 2:]. Every nights the same. Every, every nights the same shit. Lets turn the city around. Now I move too quick, follow me like a school rubric. Cause I wanna shine like I'm Kubrick. And have the whole world say ""damn you sick"". And you slip when you try to stand on steady ground. I am off into the future are you really ready now. So we stand in the waiting line. Never lose the place in time. They say it's the path to success. But if I get a chance to put your face in mine. Into space and a case of wine. We can fly where no one is left. And that'd be the best. [Hook]. [Hook 2]. [Bridge:]. Get down, get right, get over love. Let this music hit you from above. [Hook]. [Hook 2]. Let's turn the city around"
won't mind (feat. max),"[Verse 1 - Hoodie Allen:]. Woke up in the same clothes I was spotted wearing last night. Got these girls riding all on my body like a half pipe. Strivin' for attention, homie I call that the fast life. Feed these models Mcdonalds until they get their cash right. Everything I'm dippin' I'mma bet they'll eat it up. Got a text from a chick who wondering if we're meeting up later. I said I don't make plans. If you want someone who can, then you're not looking for me. You're just lookin' for another type of man. I'm just tryin' to be the first man in my fam. To graduate, go to college, get em high, auto pilot. Be someone they all are proud of. Buy a car, get it polished. Brand new clothes I'm always stylin'. Just to be with you I'd probably buy a thousand islands. [Chorus - Max:]. I won't mind if you, if you fuck with me. I won't mind if you, if you don't forget me. I won't mind if you ever want to change your mind. Because now I'm all alone. Thinkin' about you, all night long. And I wonder, do you think about me?. Baby I just wonder. Do you think about me?. [Verse 2 - Hoodie Allen:]. I could be your Elvis, you could be Priscilla Presley. Caught you looking at me like you might want to undress me. Tell her I'm a good fella, like my name was Pesci. Cooking up the fliest shit and I don't need a recipe. Damn, that was vicious, ooh I admit it. I just want you to fly with me, fly with me. No other language, I can't explain it. I just want you to fly with me, fly with me. To a place where we can't be bothered. Feeling like I'm racing to the top from the bottom. Got no whips but multiple garages. I guess you could say that I'm an optimist. Had a dream I was coppin' shit. And like Copperfield it all disappeared. Had a crazy ass [?] a long time ago. But I'm now I'm smiling from ear to ear because it all came true. Love what you do and the love will come back to you tenfold. Felt like I had a brick tied to my leg but I'm never gonna Ben Folds. At the top of my game like a tentpole. I ain't make it there yet but I'm Glenn Close. I'mma take her home and have her clothes hanging all over my bedpost. [Hook - Max]. [Break - Hoodie Allen & Max:]. (Hey yo Max). (What's up, baby?). (Dude, don't you feel like every song nowadays has a complicated dance move to it?). (Hoodie, I do feel like that). (I can't dance like that. That's not realistic, man. We need to do something for the people. Some junior prom shit. Some Sadie Hawkins shit. Some drunk at your cousin's shit but you ain't even gonna remember it. That type of shit.). (Yeah. Let's get it Bar Mitzvah poppin'). A little bit left, right, left [x8]. [Hook]"

Someone turn up the A. C Slater if not.. Than ill burn up these tapes like paper but for life decisions. I needed tips like waiters got clips.

Let me go and I might just fall. Saying my cause just might be lost. So I know that if I stay tall. The words that I need can't write me off [x4]. Ill be here for forever man [x3]

It's okay to say you've got a weak spot (It's Hoodie Allen). You don't always have to be on top (What up Marina). Better to be hated than loved, loved, loved for what you're not. (You know how we do). [Hoodie]. They telling me to take the safe route but this the detour. Hoodie baby you ain't seen a kid like this before. Late night shoe-in for the moon like Warren. Them hits come out soon as you hit record. Born in America, Chevy and Ford. But these Greek ladies lovin me they sayin he's foreign. Floored em, glued The crowd down by their boot straps. Came up on the scene so quick you think we was a news cast. Well news flash: I can see through that. People try to hide what's on their mind like a do rag.

Lately I've been staying on my grind like a skateboard. I've got some Rocket Power now so let's take off. We going hard over these beats y'all just stay soft. I don't even feel the need to say pause. Cause you would cheat to the system how you came and. Bernie Madoff. I'm a firm believer that the hard work pays off. The playoffs, I treat them like Mora did. That means I'm working with a little to get more of it. And anybody who doubted us we ignoring it. I'm on a different mission. An exhibition no scoring it. So if we more legit they treat us like a compound. Yeah they wanna brake us down, never gonna stop now. Cause being scared will only eat you like a cop out. Life's a haunted house and I'm ready to pop out. And shout out to Marina for these pop sounds. I know you really love me but let's let this chorus drop now. [Marina]. You've been acting awful tough lately. Smoking a lot of cigarettes lately. But inside, you're just a little baby. It's okay to say you've got a weak spot. You don't always have to be on top. Better to be hated than love, love, loved for what you're not. [Hoodie]. Say slow up,. Sometimes I'm just feelin' like a robot. Sittin round, hopin that you'll show up. But you know what, you know what. Say slow up,. Sometimes I'm just feelin' like a robot. Sittin round, hopin that you'll show up. But you know what, you know what. [Marina].
