where is the love?,"What's wrong with the world, mama. People livin' like they ain't got no mamas. I think the whole world addicted to the drama. Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma. Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism. But we still got terrorists here livin'. In the Usa, the big Cia. The Bloods and The Crips and the Kkk. But if you only have love for your own race. Then you only leave space to discriminate. And to discriminate only generates hate. And when you hate. then you're bound to get irate, yeah. Madness is what you demonstrate. And that's exactly how anger works and operates. Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight. Take control of your mind and meditate. Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all. People killin', people dyin'. Children hurt and you hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preach?. Or would you turn the other cheek?. Father, Father, Father help us. Send some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love (Love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love, the love, the love. It just ain't the same, old ways have changed. New days are strange, is the world insane?. If love and peace are so strong. Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?. Nations droppin' bombs. Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones. With ongoin' sufferin'. as the youth die young. So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone. So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong. In this world that we livin' in. people keep on givin' in. Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends. Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother. A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover. The truth is kept secret. it's swept under the rug. If you never know truth. then you never know love. Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know). Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know). Where's the love, y'all. People killin', people dyin'. Children hurt and you hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preach?. Or would you turn the other cheek?. Father, Father, Father help us. Send some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love (Love). Where is the love (The love) ?. Where is the love, the love, the love?. I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder. As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder. Most of us only care about money makin'. Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction. Wrong information always shown by the media. Negative images is the main criteria. Infecting the young minds. Faster than bacteria. Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema. Yo', whatever happened. to the values of humanity. Whatever happened. to the fairness and equality. Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity. Lack of understanding. leading us away from unity. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down. There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under. Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found. Now ask yourself. Where is the love?. Father, Father, Father, help us. Send some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love?. Sing with me y'all. One world, one world (We only got). One world, one world (That's all we got). One world, one world. And something's wrong with it (Yeah). Something's wrong with it (Yeah). Something's wrong with the wo-wo-world, yeah. We only got.

Then you're gonna leave space for others to discriminate. (Where's the love). [will. I. am]. And to discriminate only generates hate. And when you hate then you're bound to get irate. Madness is what you demonstrate. And that's exactly how hate works and operates. Man, we gotta set it straight. Take control of your mind and just meditate. And let your soul just gravitate. To the love, so the whole world celebrate it. People killin' people dyin'. Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preachin'?. Would you turn the other cheek again?.

What happened to the love and the values of humanity?. (Where's the love). What happened to the love and the fairness and equality?. (Where's the love). Instead of spreading love. We're spreading animosity. (Where's the love). Lack of understanding leading us away from unity. (Where's the love)"

Kids on the progressing, trippin' on the medicine. Calling like I see ya wit' some drugged up Americans. Everybody's following, ain't nobody leading. People lovin' guns, more than cases and season. And they say the reason is to protect their freedom. But we don't believe 'em. 'Cause all that we are. All that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. And all that we have, all that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. That's all that we are. That's all that we are. That's all that we are. Is big, big love. Is big, big love.

We can't be, cause their hearts ain't big enough. All we need is just us, hate got ya guessing. War is the answer but really, what's the question?. Money got 'em stressin'. Fear got 'em flexin'. Phones got their zone down. Now we lose connection. Please stand by, it takes you and I to keep the hope alive. We're living in a time where you're fighting to survive. And all we need is love.

Candle in the darkness, hope changes the heartless. Here's love to guide you, I'll be there regardless. Situation global, we're like in a robot. Swimming up the river, so I can deliver. Messages to masses, no matter your status. Nothing's ever over, we believe in second chances. Many people dying, governments are lying. It's time for rights, and please no more violence. Talk with the kindness, together we're united. When we are one. Nothing can divide us. All that we are. All that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love.

They move too much, man. I can't take them fools seriously. I mean, they ain't talk about no 6-4, no Impalas. They ain't shootin nobody (Shootin nobody). They ain't talkin about clothes. You know what I'm saying?. Yo, my man, I got a plan to do it all. (What kind of plan you got). I got a plan that none of y'all ever. Talked about 'cause underground niggas don't be. thinking. I'm going kinda ?nino? like Lincoln. How can you make moves when you're always strapped. under. I plan to read the scriptures, tell you more about the thunder. I wonder what really makes the world go round. Not thugs, 'cause thugs go 'round the brain of a. brother's down. You be in it for a quick blink. But when you start to sink. You be deeper than you was. When you should've stop to think. About your consequence your actions don't make lots of sense. Brothers use the wicked life 'cause of lack of. confidence. The devil jacked you for your sense now. You can't pay your rent and. That's no accident, you let us slip so we win. The rest of your development. You should've took time to prevent. The confiscation of your monument. Now ya, wash up, and a nobody. No one blame but your body. You livin life, had thick and uneasy. You chose to be involved with no deals and crisis. In a hole 'cause of lust and greed. Your mind held captive and unable to exceed. Come out and follow the Peas, we give you what you. need. We proceed to give you, what (What, what). A... (8x). We givin you what you want. (We give you what you want) -- (3x). And you proce-e-e-e-e-e-e-ed. On fienin on what you need. (We give you what you need) -- (3x). Yo, everybody's goal is to win. But others gettiing caught up within the line of. commiting sins. And everybody seems to wanna rule. It's so ridicule we gotta find the right cure. We approach to penetrate equivalent and strong. To wash out individual with evil forms. Conquering battles in these fields of greed. Dark faces all around me makes it hard for me to see. Who's got my back and who will backstab. I'm ready for foes and hoes who tries to grab. My currency, if I ain't got none. The (?) crip to runs to the ones who got some. The war bellows to those who makes action. The main caption is to bring satisfaction. If you like that contend you see. How you suppose to call yourself a real MC. So what's the definition of a true MC. (Someone who rocks swell and put my soul at ease). Lyrics went entertaining capability. (Now that's the realest, see, all around 360 degrees). I'm givin you what you want, want. I'm givin you what you want. Na-na-na-na-na-na-na. Na-na-na-na-na-na. I'm givin you what you want, want. Na-na-na-na-na-na-na. A... (8x). We givin you what you want.

You are blinded by lights, had an ego ratio. God bless you with the gift of only show. Business but you a careless professional. Is where your failing will show. Over indos and end only cash flows. Makin it big, but yet, you never know. You will pay in your dues bringin on sorrow. Here today, easily gone tomorrow. Feel the pain and I never borrow. From another man, instead I'm making grand. Watch the Peas as we make a stand. A... (8x). We givin you what you want. (We give you what you want) -- (3x). And you proce-e-e-e-e-e-e-ed. On fienin on what you need.

Any minute we'll be all over your box and video. Niggas wanna stop me and my amigos. But we still roll all over your accapella goes. Leave it or this one here like meteor. Your mediocre scene, you feel the roar. Vibration that's headed for your store. For a change, not bragging about close to more. Instead brain fusion, I lace you up confusion. Relax and feel the groove it's the solution. We straight cruisin while the beat is still cruisin. You're here so clap your hand to what we're doin. Chorus. Whip it good"

big love,"A day in a life of a kid in America. Everyone's a critic, watching criticise your character. Everybody watching ya, people love to stare at ya. Everybody's greedy ain't nobody tryna share with ya. Our leaders are embarrassing. I think they need some parenting. Tell me why are they playing with the fire and the kerosene?. Kids on the progressing, trippin' on the medicine. Calling like I see ya wit' some drugged up Americans. Everybody's following, ain't nobody leading. People lovin' guns, more than cases and season. And they say the reason is to protect their freedom. But we don't believe 'em. 'Cause all that we are. All that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. And all that we have, all that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. That's all that we are. That's all that we are. That's all that we are. Is big, big love. Is big, big love. When I was a young boy. Used to hear the people say. Power to the people but we them people nowadays. They are never giving up, now we got our hands up. We can't be, cause their hearts ain't big enough. All we need is just us, hate got ya guessing. War is the answer but really, what's the question?. Money got 'em stressin'. Fear got 'em flexin'. Phones got their zone down. Now we lose connection. Please stand by, it takes you and I to keep the hope alive. We're living in a time where you're fighting to survive. And all we need is love. All that we are. All that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. All that we have, all that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. That's all that we are. That's all that we are. That's all that we are. Is big, big love. Is big, big love. Life is a blessing, knowledge is a weapon. You should choose love instead of being reckless. Candle in the darkness, hope changes the heartless. Here's love to guide you, I'll be there regardless. Situation global, we're like in a robot. Swimming up the river, so I can deliver. Messages to masses, no matter your status. Nothing's ever over, we believe in second chances. Many people dying, governments are lying. It's time for rights, and please no more violence. Talk with the kindness, together we're united. When we are one. Nothing can divide us. All that we are. All that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. All that we have, all that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. All that we are. All that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. All that we have, all that we're made of.

bringing it back,"[Verse One]. I know I'm not the only one that's filling the void. Creatively hip-hop is being destroyed. A lot of rappers really need to be unemployed. because the topics that them talk about has got me annoyed. You see I heard it all before, there's no need to repeat it. The forms I vacated, might as well delete it. Put your program in and open a new file. You shoulda took your record advance and bought a style. We the only crew that came original. while a lot of other brothers just mimic the pile. The pile that's only designed for pop charts. that contradicts thought, that's the reason we brought. it back cause honestly it lacks. talent and creativity, in fact. these are symptoms to somethin that's wack. And your system senseless to witness that. So, baby if you wanna, we gon' speak on it. We gon' tell the world why hip-hop is haunted. Money is a drug and MC's is on it. We gon' take it back to the days of Mantronix. [Chorus]. Yo *snap* we bringin it back. Check it out cause we bringin it back. All DJ crews that's cuttin, you bringin it back. We bringin it back. All b-boys breakin and bustin, bringin it back. We bringin it back. I'ma do the cabbage patch to solidify we bringin it back. Black Eyed Peas straight bringin it back, check it out. [Verse Two]. Y'all, your rhymes ain't ready, you dead like Kenny. Approachin on the mic soundin hefty. Ummmmmm, lustin for them pennies. Far too many, MC's wanna praise they Bentley's. Yo, we breakin it down with the art. DJ and breakin up on the chart. MC's pull out your mic, rip it apart. Writers - hit up the wall, put up your mark and. Set get ready, hold yourself steady. Tryin to make a turn like Aunt Betty. Sharp on the mic and slice like a machete. Feelin the beat, real deep, down to my belly. Back in the essence, rhyme with the reasons. Too many MC lost the true meanin. Hip-Hop, bringin it back with the feelin. Y'all, we're bringin it back with the feelin. So love me if you wanna, but I'ma speak on it. I'ma tell the world why hip-hop is haunted. Money is a drug and MC's is on it. We gon' take it back to the days of Soulsonic. [Chorus] w/ variations. [Chorus Two]. Yo, we bringin it back. Check it out look we bringin it back. All DJ's scratchin and cuttin, you bringin it back. We bringin it back. All b-girls breakin and bustin, you bringin it back. We bringin it back.

Raised by the same pop and mother emcees. While I got a lot of brand in my name, I'm. recognizable. Leavin me the cash amount, that's quite sizable. Rich in that english that's broke as hell. That's why my niggaz in the hood understand me so well. Its the modern rap type talk. used to walk, all over your ears. You hear the thump, this track pumps like, well order. Some others fell short of the line of finish. You didn't practice harder at the scrimmage. Now my image is the golden cup. My career is dirty compared to yours, it's all washed up. [Chorus - 4x]. Back, back, back, back, and forth. from Ca-li to New York. [Verse Three: Dove]. We, we, we, we regulate and cross plates, destruct ya. Toss coins to distract it and we bust ya. Minds blow bigger than tempers out in Russia. Cuss like a sailor, make you shame like thelya. Stitch a verse tailored to fit. Spray paintin' your spit. on the deco we art, spread apart. I raid mo' tracks than flicks in ""Beat. Street"". with kicks until the sole wear out, never that!. We weather that, you light in the ass and feather that. Heavy like black leather coats, you pleather that. Last dick on the line, we way ahead of that. Squeezin like Freddie Foxx, and his two glocks. Rocks don't impress niggaz who speak to God. We get jams to make a tuna melt. Held down by the Bep, we strictly, new getty. Two-fifty up in front of the mic, so what it look. like?. [Chorus to fade]. Back, back, back, back, and forth. from Ca-li to New York"

Put them in your wallet next to your money. Money represents your whole and soul represents your honey. Ain't got honey then you ain't got bees. And if you ain't got no money I'ma still MC.

I wanna travel the world and stop on every city. Rejuvenate your burnt out sea put down your Philly for a sec. Close your eyes and don't fret. Listen to the audible sounds and just let. Your soul feel the free feelin. Reprovide you with the ride, free fallin. To make your heart beat, skip, hipnotize you and. APL take you on a trip where your mind's at ease. Forget ballin 'cause I won't quit, and Will won't quit. And Tab won't quit so you can enjoy it. That means we won't stop. And I won't stop until we reach the rop. I'd rather be ready for the future.

A hectic thrill, connect with Will. Then we create with the kung-fu collected skill. The checks get real, people think this shit is hunky-dory. It's another story while we be fightin' for redemption. Pimps and prostitutes get the break they need. With breakneck speed, the fakes succeed indeed. Thinkin' life is a party and it's a must to please.

Just to match with them alligator shoes. He's a rich man so he's no longer singin the blues. He's singing songs about material things. and platinum rings and watches that go blink. But, diamonds don't blink in the dark. He's a star now, but he aint singing from the heart. Sooner or later he's just gonna fall apart. Coz his fans can't relate to his newfound art. He ain't doing what he did from the start. And that's putting in some feeling and thought. He decided to live his life shallow. Passion is love for material. [Jack Johnson].

Your the type that thinks souls is sold in a store. Packaged up with incense sticks. With them vegetarian meals. To you that's righteous. You're fiction like books. You need to go out to life and look. Coz..What happens when they take your material. You already sold ya soul. and it's... [Jack Johnson]. And it's gone...gone...going....

And money is time. So you got mind in ya money. And ya money on ya mind. But what about... That crime that cha did to get paid. And what about... That bid, you can't take it to your brain. [Jack Johnson]. And what about those shoes you wear today. They'll be no good. On the bridges you've walked along the way. [Will.I.am]. All that money that you got. Gonna be gone. That gear that you rock. Gonna be gone. The house up on the hill. Gonna be gone. The gold fronts on your grill. Gonna be gone. The ice on your wrist. Gonna be gone. That nice little miss. Gonna be gone. That whip that you roll. Gonna be gone. And what's worst is your soul already gone. [Jack Johnson]. And it's gone...gone...going.... Gone...everything gone...give a damn....

Having to pump the water outta the ground. The way we put it down utilizing what is around. Like land for farming, river for fishing. Everyone helpin' each other whenever they can. We makin' it happen, from nothin' to somethin'. That's how we be survivin' back in my homeland. Yo, its been a while but.... I been back home to my homeland, (check it out) to see what's going on. Man it feels good to be back at home. And it's been a decade, on the journey all alone. I was fourteen when I first left Philippines. I've been away half my life, but it felt like a day.

Know thy self and you're the king, you're the ring. But they don't teach kids nothing. All they know is I'll pass sugar in they muffins. They don't know division, won't add to nothing. Send them off to prison when you know they did nothing. He in the streets cause they always cuttin'. The teacher ain't teaching him nothin'. All they do was stuffin' him and stuffin' him. Stuffin' him and stuffin' him and stuffin' him. Stuffin' him and stuffin' him and stuffin' him. Stuffin' him with stuff he can't use. So he sell crack, that's what he know to do. His daddy was a hustler, so he hustle too. And that's why you see a lil' killer in the news. It's kinda like they got us in a trap. It's kinda like they knowin how we act. I'll be like ""fuck ya fuckin' laboratory, I ain't not a rat! "". I am light, and god, body wise, it's a fact. Wake up!. Wake up, wake up sound the alarm. Revolution time has come.

Clock ticking like we're running out of options. Villains in White House, heroes seen in coffins. Leaders stumbled cross while we leading to our crosses. Whose policin' the police, why they socking?. All eyes matter to your color what's the target. Folks shrining up the ship for the startup. Money over people while they reaching for that dollar. All I see is slice on the shrimp. Lenin the three but what the fuck is three?. What is the cost to let a nigga breath?. King had a dream but we all still asleep, huh. They ride a blind, but now they just a crime. The shit's designed to keep you on the grind. Rise and shine, cause now it's the time. We all god body if you open up your mind. Wake up. Wake up, wake up sound the alarm. Revolution time has come. Wake up, wake up sound the alarm. Tell the people here come the storm. Wake up!. Wake up, wake up sound the alarm. Revolution time has come. Wake up, wake up sound the alarm. Ring the alarm, ring the alarm. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake. Pt. 3. Ain't nothing impossible, I tell myself. That I am possible I know that devil is. Out there and plottin' those plan. Just stopped me and put me in hospital bed. I said ""Yo, I would not be toppled. I'm down with here Susan roll with apostles. we got that big love, that love that's colossal"". We meditate ain't no need to get hostel. You cannot penetrate me with that hate. We got that good vibration on vibrate. Stay on and way up cause we elevate. We got that big love, the love have you wait?. Waitin', waitin'. Gospel, the gospel. That's the motherfuckin' gospel. Huh, that's the gospel. That's the motherfuckin' gospel. I tell them yo, the movement's unstoppable. Pausing the flow, that is not optional. I let him know everything solvable. when you use science. everything is possible. I am a fiant, I am so logical. Politicians be trippin' the chemical. So I sit back and listen to audios. spiritual hip-hop. I call that hypnotic cause, we boot up. Boy, we boot phenomenal. We kill zombies and chronicals. We ain't falling cause we ain't dominos. A revolution is on go, go. Go, that's the gospel. That's the motherfuckin' gospel. Yup, that's the gospel. That's the motherfuckin' gospel"

street livin',"Street livin', caught in a trap. Guns or books, sell crack or rap. Be like kings or be like pawns. They called us coons, now they call us cons. Street niggas be packing pistols. Terrorists be blasting missles. Crips and bloods and retail thugs. CIA planes bring Columbian drugs. Don't push me cause I'm close to hell. The dudes in my neighbourhood got all the spell. And compare to them, prison guards get payed well. Ten years no bail is 4 years at Yale. So, forget about the statue of General Lee. Because the status of blacks are generally. Are gonna end up in some penitentiary. Systematically, that's how they made it to be. Listen, they derailed the soul train. And put a nightmare into every Martin Luther King. And private complexes are owned by the same. Slave masters that owned the slave trade game. And racists no longer have to be racist. Cause niggas kill more niggas than the KK did. Now, every time I hear a new def jam. Niggas killing niggas like they Ku Klux Klan. I understand what's a nigga to choose?. Be the killer or be the dead dude in the news. I get it, what's a nigga to do?. No education in the hood, got a nigga confused. Street livin', tough conditions. Brainwashed by the television. We lost in the war we live in. Double cross love lost no religion. Street livin', oh my gosh. Another brother got shot by the searg'. Another cop got off with no charge. If you black in the hood, you at large. You're guilty until we prove you're innocent. If you're ivory, they treat you different. If you're ebony, they assume you're temperament. Well, be vigilant, and they call you militant. You'll get shot, and they'll say the incident. Is because you're beligerent. What a coincidence?. Wanna brag, but you're still an immigrant. If you ain't dead, you can see imprisonment. It's more niggas in the prisons. Than there ever slaves cotton picking. There's more niggas that's rotting in the prisons. Than there ever slaves cotton picking. So, how we gon' get out the trap?. Guns or books, sell crack or rap. Street livin', hustle or hoops. Guns or books, get shot or shoot. Street livin', ain't no rules. Break the law, make or break the news. The life you choose could be the life you lose. Niggas getting stuck for the Nike shoes. Street livin', ain't no joke. It's a cold world, better bring your coat. Revoke cause the streets are broke. And now, they wanna take away our dreams and hopes. Street livin', no economics. No way out of the Reaganomics. Infected by the black plague, new bubonic. No comprende, we speak ebonics. Street livin', what's your position?. You can take action or take a dick. Listen, you can get fucked by the system. Or you can say fuck the system"

the apl song,"(Chorus in Tagalog). Lapit mga kaibigan at makinig kayo. Ako'y maydala dalang, balita galing sa bayan ko. Nais kong ipamahagi ang mga kuento. Ang manga pangyayaring nagaganap. Sa lupang pinangako. [English Translation:. Come together and listen. I brought news from my native land. I'll tell you how we live and what goes on. From my beloved homeland.].

Some would call it hell but to me it was heaven. God gave me the grace, amazin' ways of living. How would you feel if you had to catch your meal?. Build a hut to live and to eat and chill in.. Having to pump the water outta the ground. The way we put it down utilizing what is around. Like land for farming, river for fishing. Everyone helpin' each other whenever they can. We makin' it happen, from nothin' to somethin'. That's how we've be survivin' back in my homeland. (Chorus). (Verse two, Apl.De.Ap). Yo, its been a while but.... I been back home to my homeland, (check it out) to see what's going on. Man it feels good to be back at home. And it's been a decade, on the journey all alone.

Now life has changed for me in the U.S. But back at home man, life was a mess.... I guess sometimes life's stresses gets you down. On your knees, oh brother I wish I could have helped. you out....

union (feat. sting),"[One for all, one for all]. [It's all it's all for one]. Let's start a union, calling every human. It's one for all and all for one. Let's live in unison, calling every citizen. It's one for all and all for one. We don't want war- can't take no more. It's drastic time for sure. We need a anidote and a cure. Coz do you really think Mohammed got a problem with your whole world. We don't want war - imagine if any prophet was alive. In current days amongst you and I. You think they'd view life like you and I do. Or would they sit and contemplate on why. Do we live this way, act and behave this way. We still live in primitive today. Coz the peace in the destination of war can't be the way. There's no way, so people just be 'em wanna be a man. Realise that you can't change the world by changing yourself. And understand that we're all just the same. So when I count to three let's change. [Chorus]. Got no time for grand philosophy. I barely keep my head above the tide. I got this mortgage, got three kids at school. What you're saying is the truth, but really troubles me inside. I'd change the world if I could change my mind. If I could live beyond my fears. Exchanging unity for all my insecurity. Exchanging laughter for my tears. [Chorus]. I don't know, y'all, we in a real deposition. In the midst of all this negative condition. Divided by beliefs, different sink and religion. Why do we keep missing the point in our mission?. Why do we keep killing each other, what's the reason?. God made us all equal in his vision. I wish that I could make music as a religion. Then we could harmonise together in this mission. Listen, I know it's really hard to make changes. But two of us could help rearrange this curse. Utilising all the power in our voices. Together we will unite and make the right choice. And fight for education, save the next generation. Come together as one. I don't understand why it's never been done. So let's change on the count of one. It takes one, just one. And then one follows the other one. And then another follows the other one. Next thing you know you got a billion. People doing some wonderful things. People doing some powerful things. Let's change and do some powerful things. Unity could be a wonderful thing. [Chorus]"

Attracted to the trauma, mamma. (Where's the love). I think they don't understand the concept or. The meaning of karma. (Where's the love). [Diddy]. Overseas, yeah they trying to stop terrorism. (Where's the love). Over here on the streets the police shoot. The people put the bullets in 'em. (Where's the love). But if you only got love for your own race. (Where's the love). Then you're gonna leave space for others to discriminate. (Where's the love). [will. I. am]. And to discriminate only generates hate. And when you hate then you're bound to get irate. Madness is what you demonstrate. And that's exactly how hate works and operates. Man, we gotta set it straight. Take control of your mind and just meditate. And let your soul just gravitate. To the love, so the whole world celebrate it. People killin' people dyin'. Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preachin'?. Would you turn the other cheek again?.

Or a cop gets knocked down. Black lives not now. Everybody matter to me. All races, y'all don't like what I'm sayin'?. Haterade, tall cases. Everybody hate somebody. Guess we all racist. Black Eyed Peas do a song about love. And y'all hate this. All these protest with different colored faces. We was all born with a heart. Why we gotta chase it?. And every time I look around. [Taboo Ty Dolla $ign]. Every time I look up, every time I look down. No one's on a common ground. (Where's the love). And if you never speak truth. Then you never know how love sounds.

All he ever wanted was a smoke oh my gosh. Said he can't breathe. With his hands in the air. Layin' on the ground died from a choke. [apl. de. ap Fergie]. I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders. As I'm gettin' older y'all people gets colder. Most of us only care about money makin'. Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction. Wrong information was shown by the media. Negative images is the main criteria. Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria. Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas. What happened to the love and the values of humanity?. (Where's the love). What happened to the love and the fairness and equality?. (Where's the love). Instead of spreading love. We're spreading animosity. (Where's the love). Lack of understanding leading us away from unity. (Where's the love)"

Entity with a so-called Mc enemies. Will decrease when I step into your sceneries. Of course now you off course lost up in the source. I'm running out of time, this no time for no scrimmage. Aristorate the diamonds and replace it with the real image. Picture that, I know where I'm at. I know where I'm going and I'll be back. With a stronger impact lyrics be intact. Get you intoxicated when black attack. With the full-force pressure, hard to measure. On a rate, whack Mc's won't prevail. On a dream of makin dream braggin about infrared beams. But it seems all they really pullin is pullin them schemes. I take it back to the essense of hip-hop. Never will I stop with my beat-box. Chorus. Can you feel it. Hmm, I gotta get into you.

where is the love?,"What's wrong with the world, mama. People livin' like they ain't got no mamas. I think the whole world addicted to the drama. Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma. Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism. But we still got terrorists here livin'. In the Usa, the big Cia. The Bloods and The Crips and the Kkk. But if you only have love for your own race. Then you only leave space to discriminate. And to discriminate only generates hate. And when you hate. then you're bound to get irate, yeah. Madness is what you demonstrate. And that's exactly how anger works and operates. Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight. Take control of your mind and meditate. Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all. People killin', people dyin'. Children hurt and you hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preach?. Or would you turn the other cheek?. Father, Father, Father help us. Send some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love (Love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love, the love, the love. It just ain't the same, old ways have changed. New days are strange, is the world insane?. If love and peace are so strong. Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?. Nations droppin' bombs. Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones. With ongoin' sufferin'. as the youth die young. So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone. So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong. In this world that we livin' in. people keep on givin' in. Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends. Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother. A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover. The truth is kept secret. it's swept under the rug. If you never know truth. then you never know love. Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know). Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know). Where's the love, y'all. People killin', people dyin'. Children hurt and you hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preach?. Or would you turn the other cheek?. Father, Father, Father help us. Send some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love (Love). Where is the love (The love) ?. Where is the love, the love, the love?. I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder. As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder. Most of us only care about money makin'. Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction. Wrong information always shown by the media. Negative images is the main criteria. Infecting the young minds. Faster than bacteria. Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema. Yo', whatever happened. to the values of humanity. Whatever happened. to the fairness and equality. Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity. Lack of understanding. leading us away from unity. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down. There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under. Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found. Now ask yourself. Where is the love?. Father, Father, Father, help us. Send some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love?. Sing with me y'all. One world, one world (We only got). One world, one world (That's all we got). One world, one world. And something's wrong with it (Yeah). Something's wrong with it (Yeah). Something's wrong with the wo-wo-world, yeah. We only got.

big love,"A day in a life of a kid in America. Everyone's a critic, watching criticise your character. Everybody watching ya, people love to stare at ya. Everybody's greedy ain't nobody tryna share with ya. Our leaders are embarrassing. I think they need some parenting. Tell me why are they playing with the fire and the kerosene?. Kids on the progressing, trippin' on the medicine. Calling like I see ya wit' some drugged up Americans. Everybody's following, ain't nobody leading. People lovin' guns, more than cases and season. And they say the reason is to protect their freedom. But we don't believe 'em. 'Cause all that we are. All that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. And all that we have, all that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. That's all that we are. That's all that we are. That's all that we are. Is big, big love. Is big, big love. When I was a young boy. Used to hear the people say. Power to the people but we them people nowadays. They are never giving up, now we got our hands up. We can't be, cause their hearts ain't big enough. All we need is just us, hate got ya guessing. War is the answer but really, what's the question?. Money got 'em stressin'. Fear got 'em flexin'. Phones got their zone down. Now we lose connection. Please stand by, it takes you and I to keep the hope alive. We're living in a time where you're fighting to survive. And all we need is love. All that we are. All that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. All that we have, all that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. That's all that we are. That's all that we are. That's all that we are. Is big, big love. Is big, big love. Life is a blessing, knowledge is a weapon. You should choose love instead of being reckless. Candle in the darkness, hope changes the heartless. Here's love to guide you, I'll be there regardless. Situation global, we're like in a robot. Swimming up the river, so I can deliver. Messages to masses, no matter your status. Nothing's ever over, we believe in second chances. Many people dying, governments are lying. It's time for rights, and please no more violence. Talk with the kindness, together we're united. When we are one. Nothing can divide us. All that we are. All that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. All that we have, all that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. All that we are. All that we're made of. Is big, big love. Big, big love. All that we have, all that we're made of.

a8,"Intro/Conversation:. Yo son, whatcha think about those Peas, though?. Yo, yo, I don't know, them dudes just be on stage,. dancin and stuff.... They on some old Las Vegas bullshit. They move too much, man. I can't take them fools seriously. I mean, they ain't talk about no 6-4, no Impalas. They ain't shootin nobody (Shootin nobody). They ain't talkin about clothes. You know what I'm saying?. Yo, my man, I got a plan to do it all. (What kind of plan you got). I got a plan that none of y'all ever. Talked about 'cause underground niggas don't be. thinking. I'm going kinda ?nino? like Lincoln. How can you make moves when you're always strapped. under. I plan to read the scriptures, tell you more about the thunder. I wonder what really makes the world go round. Not thugs, 'cause thugs go 'round the brain of a. brother's down. You be in it for a quick blink. But when you start to sink. You be deeper than you was. When you should've stop to think. About your consequence your actions don't make lots of sense. Brothers use the wicked life 'cause of lack of. confidence. The devil jacked you for your sense now. You can't pay your rent and. That's no accident, you let us slip so we win. The rest of your development. You should've took time to prevent. The confiscation of your monument. Now ya, wash up, and a nobody. No one blame but your body. You livin life, had thick and uneasy. You chose to be involved with no deals and crisis. In a hole 'cause of lust and greed. Your mind held captive and unable to exceed. Come out and follow the Peas, we give you what you. need. We proceed to give you, what (What, what). A... (8x).

But others gettiing caught up within the line of. commiting sins. And everybody seems to wanna rule. It's so ridicule we gotta find the right cure. We approach to penetrate equivalent and strong. To wash out individual with evil forms. Conquering battles in these fields of greed. Dark faces all around me makes it hard for me to see. Who's got my back and who will backstab. I'm ready for foes and hoes who tries to grab. My currency, if I ain't got none. The (?) crip to runs to the ones who got some. The war bellows to those who makes action. The main caption is to bring satisfaction. If you like that contend you see. How you suppose to call yourself a real MC. So what's the definition of a true MC. (Someone who rocks swell and put my soul at ease). Lyrics went entertaining capability. (Now that's the realest, see, all around 360 degrees). I'm givin you what you want, want. I'm givin you what you want. Na-na-na-na-na-na-na. Na-na-na-na-na-na. I'm givin you what you want, want. Na-na-na-na-na-na-na. A... (8x). We givin you what you want.

You are blinded by lights, had an ego ratio. God bless you with the gift of only show. Business but you a careless professional. Is where your failing will show. Over indos and end only cash flows. Makin it big, but yet, you never know. You will pay in your dues bringin on sorrow. Here today, easily gone tomorrow. Feel the pain and I never borrow. From another man, instead I'm making grand. Watch the Peas as we make a stand. A... (8x). We givin you what you want. (We give you what you want) -- (3x). And you proce-e-e-e-e-e-e-ed. On fienin on what you need.

back 2 hiphop (ft. nas),"Ring the alarm, get on the horn and inform. Everyone from Oregon to Melbourne. That the funk phenomenon has been reborn and transformed. You coulda sworn that you wasn't warned 'cause we was. Trapped in the box that rap had spawned. It was a square until we kicked it to an octagon. We gotten strong from the pain it's undergone.

Alligator ritual turns out it was the visual. Proficient with the lyrical, a vision like a miracle. Damage all you mumblin' MCs rhyming 'bout decimal. Increasing no residual, why you still remain minimal. Maximize, utilize, my plan mineral. Do not try to bite because my shit is not edible. Rhyme unforgettable like Nat King Cole.

be free,"BEP, I know you feel it, huh (4x). Oh my goodness, I know you feel the vibration. Across the globe no matter your location. Ain't no difficulty or complication. Just as long my niggas in the celebration. Celebrated the musical liberation. The Peas then demonstrated the demonstration. And you will feel the flush of relaxation. I'ma wax these and then get heavy rotation. I got you in bliss and ain't no aggrevation. When you bump us, we bring the stimulation. So hurry up and get your daily fixation. But make sure that it's handled, it's a moderation. One dose should bring you to a limitation. So put your back into it, baby, that's right, huh. I'm about to plug in some dedication. This goes out to my brothers and my coalition. Chorus:. All I want is to be free. You keep pushin up on me. All I want is to be free. You be you let I'll be me. Let me do what I feel inside. Won't get taken for a ride. Do just what I feel inside. Everything will be alright (5x). Oh my goodness, it's obvious now you feelin me. Envious niggas plan on killing me. Frontin on my niggas and also my family. Fienin for my capability, it's tragedy. My technicalities die hard like battery. Try to cross us, I blast 'cause you flattin me. You oughta be on something like PCP. To come against a crew like BEP (Oh my goodness). Oh no you didn't try to contest me. Come out delivery, won't control your body. I'm breakin down y'all mathematically. Yes mentally, physically and spiritually. Actually, I'm rippin your anatomy. 'Cause literally you be in the cemetery. I'm about to throw a shout-out to my peeps. Dedicated to the DJ's that pump it in their streets. Chorus. Whip it good like DeVoe we whip it good. You understand (Yo man, it's understood). We be winnin tournaments like Tiger Woods. Openin your suburbs and bump it in your hood. Rock it in your box or your hooptie-hoop. Bump it in your hot beamer 850 coupe. 'Cause I'ma inform y'all on what to do. Hop in your ride and drive down in your avenue. It's bumpin in your barbeque and your venue. At a journey, feelin that ease, is why I sent you. 'Cause ain't no stoppin this, stoppin it. 'Cause we be rockin it (Rock, rock, rock). Yeah, yeah, yeah (8x). Chorus. Gather up the team, now we ready to go. Any minute we'll be all over your box and video. Niggas wanna stop me and my amigos. But we still roll all over your accapella goes. Leave it or this one here like meteor. Your mediocre scene, you feel the roar. Vibration that's headed for your store. For a change, not bragging about close to more. Instead brain fusion, I lace you up confusion. Relax and feel the groove it's the solution. We straight cruisin while the beat is still cruisin. You're here so clap your hand to what we're doin. Chorus. Whip it good"

bringing it back,"[Verse One]. I know I'm not the only one that's filling the void. Creatively hip-hop is being destroyed. A lot of rappers really need to be unemployed. because the topics that them talk about has got me annoyed. You see I heard it all before, there's no need to repeat it. The forms I vacated, might as well delete it. Put your program in and open a new file. You shoulda took your record advance and bought a style. We the only crew that came original. while a lot of other brothers just mimic the pile. The pile that's only designed for pop charts. that contradicts thought, that's the reason we brought. it back cause honestly it lacks. talent and creativity, in fact. these are symptoms to somethin that's wack. And your system senseless to witness that. So, baby if you wanna, we gon' speak on it. We gon' tell the world why hip-hop is haunted. Money is a drug and MC's is on it.

duet,"Uh, hmm. Hurry up a bit. Yeah, yeah. Chorus (3x):. I like the way you do it, when you do it. When you doin, what you doin. Check this out right here, son. We about to move to make you feel some. A lot of positive vibrations to build from. 'Cause all I wanna do is lose some and win some. Have a little of prosperity and then some. Livin my life handsome, has always been a dream but. Now it's time to really achieve by all means (Bust it). I keep my shit, plus thirty in between. When an arm reach out to grab the supreme. 'Cause I won't stop, and AP won't stop. And Tab won't stop until we reach the top. That means we won't quit, so we stay thick so you can enjoy it. I know you like the way it's goin down, honey, honey. I know you like the milky-mellow sound, honey, honey. Doin this ain't all about money, money. I know you like the way I sound, right, right. Chorus (4x). As I enter the room I absorb the mood. Positive vibe supplied by a positive crew. And negativity exist and you must acknowledge. You can be intelligent and never go to college. 'Cause the way we live in society. It ain't really the way that it's supposed to be. And don't get close to me if you're contaminated. Take a picture of your soul and get it laminated. Put them in your wallet next to your money. Money represents your whole and soul represents your honey. Ain't got honey then you ain't got bees. And if you ain't got no money I'ma still MC. Then empty L-O-V-E all over the track. Once you R-E-D then you never go back. 'Til the end of studio with the Peas as Black. With Adam, Taboo, and alligator APL De AP. Chorus (4x). I wanna travel the world and stop on every city. Rejuvenate your burnt out sea put down your Philly for a sec. Close your eyes and don't fret. Listen to the audible sounds and just let. Your soul feel the free feelin. Reprovide you with the ride, free fallin. To make your heart beat, skip, hipnotize you and. APL take you on a trip where your mind's at ease. Forget ballin 'cause I won't quit, and Will won't quit. And Tab won't quit so you can enjoy it. That means we won't stop. And I won't stop until we reach the rop. I'd rather be ready for the future. Do it for yourself 'cause no one else will suit ya. I juxtapose for mine to maintain. And segregate myself from evil and pain. Chorus (8x)."

Fast forward now, Maybach's wasn't in. Getting out the project was the project. Momma said ""progress is the process"". I was paid less shopped at the Payless. Now my ass is living in a nice address. Feeling like a champ living up in loss feelings. Way back when I just wanted dope feeling. I can't go wear a tracksuit from Adidas. Now we over here selling 80, 000 seaters. Now they wanna see us when we coming to the town. Cause we number one with the champion sound. We be folding up, never falling down. Keep it at a high level, elevated ground. Life is so wonderful. Life is so beautiful. Life is amazing. Life can be terrible. Life is unbearable. Life is just crazy. Life is terrific, it's also horrific. It's a magnificent painting. If life is a gift.

No handouts, they don't wanna hand me shit. Now they analyze me calling all the analysts. Now they realize that I'm the catalyst. On the Bob Marley shit, I'm the activist. And no I'm not talking bout no cannabis. Born Filipino, born philanthropist. I know I wouldn't be the guy bout the bullshit. No wise from the dumb, all about the school shit. You two know where the edge is. Gotta have knowledge, know where the ledge is. Bridging the gap closer to where the edge is. Ordinary people we the John Legends. Life is so wonderful. Life is so beautiful. Life is amazing. Life can be terrible. Life is unbearable. Life is just crazy. Life is terrific, it's also horrific. It's a magnificent painting. If life is a gift.

get original,"What?. A lot of brothers, claimin' they hard. I grab the microphone and leave 'em scarred. But not scarred physically, more like scarred mentally. I correct your ego, I'ma show you how it go. 'Cause you killin me, ain't no skill in you. With my hands on you I wouldn't be feelin' you. Yeah you platinum, but you whack as hell. I dubbed over your single like a Maxell. You need to stop now, get original. Start practicin', master your flow. You might as well, turn in your mic. And start collectin' dollars at the turnpike. 'Cause the rhymes you kick, need to be fixed. But you couldn't even fix them in the mix. If you ate pebbles, your shit wouldn't rock. You one of them balloons made to go pop. You need to stop now, get original. Start practicin', master your flow. Stop now, get original, what?. Stop now, get original. Start practicin', master your flow. There is really nothin' you can do. We about to hit you in your face with my kung-fu. Risky on the microphone, I am. Got the energy of Goliath and Rovalynn. I'm about to let you know the deal on how I feel. Many people can't be real, so they gotta chase the steel. What the deal? Is it really all about the bills?. What's the thrill? I'd rather have my soul fulfilled. You gotta stop now, get original. Start practicin', master your flow. We delegate the skills to conversatin'. The loss of motivation of MC's to create. Sent it in for quick hit, waitin' for the break. You didn't pay your dues, so you got on Rikki Lake. How does it feel to be the man on top. When everythin' you got ain't any of your props?. You need to stop now, get original. Start practicin', master your flow. Stop now, get original, stop now, get original. Start practicin', master your flow. When you think about rap in it's entirety. Violence became variety. Silently personalities differ from what they try to be. 2na be on the frontline, with rhyme shell I hit you. You're sluggish like a barbiturate. We can make you admit you bit. A hectic thrill, connect with Will. Then we create with the kung-fu collected skill. The checks get real, people think this shit is hunky-dory. It's another story while we be fightin' for redemption. Pimps and prostitutes get the break they need. With breakneck speed, the fakes succeed indeed. Thinkin' life is a party and it's a must to please. But many pop MC's work for Mephistopheles stop it please. Choppin' broccoli happily for your company. Publically sellin' Satan when really you should be bumpin' the truth. So stop now, get original. Just practice and master your flow"

She hit me with some stuff that I just couldn't ignore. That she had to up and leave. 'Cause I was a fool foolin her on what she need. Check it, yo from my point of view it was kinda whack. She said even when we're reminiscing there's no bringing it back. And for her, it's really beyond that. Talkin about she been through emotional combat. Chorus:. All the years that I been back. You were never around. And now, love won't wait. (It's like that now, oh, it's like that now). Let's stop all my love to you. Baby, I'm through with you. 'Cause now, love won't wait. (It's like that now, oh, it's like that now). Hook. Yo, Will, that's kinda whack, I know how you be feelin. My girl's also trippin about the same reason. 'Cause we out for two seasons on the road makin G's and. I figured it out these women there's no pleasin. Yo, Will, I feel the pain, that you're going through. She got you stuck on a yam and she's splatting too. Plotting on leaving you, yo, are you feeling cool. And if you're not you can always hang with the crew. Chorus. I call my baby to tell her I'm on my way. Call her 'til I pass we going out today. It was a beautiful Sunday. I had plans on going to watchin the matinee. And she dissed you, up and left you. Packed her bags and went and upset. She was like ""I'm leaving"" (Oh it's like that, now). ""I'm leaving"" (She was always like that). Check it, but from my point of view it was kinda whack. She said even when we're reminiscing there's no bringing it back. And for her, it's really beyond that. Talkin about she been through emotional combat. Chorus. Hook (2x). I love you love, but I'm thinkin' 'bout."

"ring the alarm pt.1, pt.2, pt.3","Pt. 1. Wake up!. I wanna say what's on my motherfuckin' conscious. The whole world right now is fucking bonkers. The internet is the brand new conqueror. So watch out for the motherfuckin' monsters (yikes!). The trolls are the taunters. Whoever controls the data got the answers. They the ones that got the code to the launcher. And they be having dinner with the Pope and the mobsters. They know the cure for the cancer. Cure for the AIDS and they probably killed the panthers. Put us in a cage got us living like hamsters. Put us in the dark but I got me a lantern. Open up my third eye, then I illuminate. Willy got a bird eye view when I elevate. No Illuminati baby I'm god body. The rapture like Blondie wakin' up zombies. Wake up!. Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm. Revolution time has come. Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm. Tell the people here come the storm. Wake up!. Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm. Revolution time has come. Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm. Ring the alarm, ring the alarm. Ring the alarm, ring the alarm. Ring the alarm, ring the alarm. Ring the alarm, ring the alarm. Ring the alarm, ring the alarm. Wake up!. A wise man said knowledge is king. Know thy self and you can do anything. Know thy self and you could shine like bling. Know thy self and you're the king, you're the ring. But they don't teach kids nothing. All they know is I'll pass sugar in they muffins. They don't know division, won't add to nothing. Send them off to prison when you know they did nothing. He in the streets cause they always cuttin'. The teacher ain't teaching him nothin'. All they do was stuffin' him and stuffin' him. Stuffin' him and stuffin' him and stuffin' him. Stuffin' him and stuffin' him and stuffin' him. Stuffin' him with stuff he can't use. So he sell crack, that's what he know to do. His daddy was a hustler, so he hustle too. And that's why you see a lil' killer in the news. It's kinda like they got us in a trap. It's kinda like they knowin how we act. I'll be like ""fuck ya fuckin' laboratory, I ain't not a rat! "". I am light, and god, body wise, it's a fact. Wake up!. Wake up, wake up sound the alarm. Revolution time has come. Wake up, wake up sound the alarm. Tell the people here come the storm. Wake up!. Wake up, wake up sound the alarm. Revolution time has come. Wake up, wake up sound the alarm. Ring the alarm, ring the alarm. Ring the alarm, ring the alarm. Ring the alarm, ring the alarm. Ring the alarm, ring the alarm. Ring the alarm, ring the alarm. Wake up!. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake. Pt. 2. Wake up!. Wake up!. Eyes open, who's watching the watches?. Clock ticking like we're running out of options. Villains in White House, heroes seen in coffins. Leaders stumbled cross while we leading to our crosses. Whose policin' the police, why they socking?. All eyes matter to your color what's the target. Folks shrining up the ship for the startup. Money over people while they reaching for that dollar. All I see is slice on the shrimp. Lenin the three but what the fuck is three?. What is the cost to let a nigga breath?. King had a dream but we all still asleep, huh. They ride a blind, but now they just a crime. The shit's designed to keep you on the grind. Rise and shine, cause now it's the time. We all god body if you open up your mind. Wake up. Wake up, wake up sound the alarm. Revolution time has come. Wake up, wake up sound the alarm. Tell the people here come the storm. Wake up!. Wake up, wake up sound the alarm. Revolution time has come. Wake up, wake up sound the alarm. Ring the alarm, ring the alarm. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake. Pt. 3. Ain't nothing impossible, I tell myself. That I am possible I know that devil is. Out there and plottin' those plan. Just stopped me and put me in hospital bed. I said ""Yo, I would not be toppled. I'm down with here Susan roll with apostles. we got that big love, that love that's colossal"". We meditate ain't no need to get hostel. You cannot penetrate me with that hate. We got that good vibration on vibrate. Stay on and way up cause we elevate. We got that big love, the love have you wait?. Waitin', waitin'. Gospel, the gospel. That's the motherfuckin' gospel. Huh, that's the gospel. That's the motherfuckin' gospel. I tell them yo, the movement's unstoppable. Pausing the flow, that is not optional. I let him know everything solvable. when you use science. everything is possible. I am a fiant, I am so logical. Politicians be trippin' the chemical. So I sit back and listen to audios. spiritual hip-hop. I call that hypnotic cause, we boot up. Boy, we boot phenomenal. We kill zombies and chronicals. We ain't falling cause we ain't dominos. A revolution is on go, go. Go, that's the gospel. That's the motherfuckin' gospel. Yup, that's the gospel. That's the motherfuckin' gospel"

Girl our love is dyin'. Why did you stop tryin'?. Girl our love is dyin'. Girl our love is dyin'. Girl our love is dyin'. Girl our love is dyin'. Why did you stop tryin'?. Love is full of emotions and games. A thin line between good bad and insane. People go screw this jus to obtain. A perfect relationship to maintain. But sometime things just get out of hands. We all make mistakes aint no perfect hu-man. Starts from the lil lie on top of the othe. Makin up excuses until you lose sense. Then you wonder why things are in for a stand. And then you to be a raise but just to make a chance. Like chasing a wonderful scene while im dreaming. But when I wake up aint nothing but screamin. Yelling while throwing things at each other. Situation like this makes me just wana tel you tough. We're trying to take it slow. But we're still losin control. And we're trying to make it work. But it still ends up the worst. And I'm craaazzzy.

street livin',"Street livin', caught in a trap. Guns or books, sell crack or rap. Be like kings or be like pawns. They called us coons, now they call us cons. Street niggas be packing pistols. Terrorists be blasting missles. Crips and bloods and retail thugs. CIA planes bring Columbian drugs. Don't push me cause I'm close to hell. The dudes in my neighbourhood got all the spell. And compare to them, prison guards get payed well. Ten years no bail is 4 years at Yale. So, forget about the statue of General Lee. Because the status of blacks are generally. Are gonna end up in some penitentiary. Systematically, that's how they made it to be. Listen, they derailed the soul train. And put a nightmare into every Martin Luther King. And private complexes are owned by the same. Slave masters that owned the slave trade game. And racists no longer have to be racist. Cause niggas kill more niggas than the KK did. Now, every time I hear a new def jam. Niggas killing niggas like they Ku Klux Klan. I understand what's a nigga to choose?. Be the killer or be the dead dude in the news. I get it, what's a nigga to do?. No education in the hood, got a nigga confused. Street livin', tough conditions. Brainwashed by the television. We lost in the war we live in. Double cross love lost no religion. Street livin', oh my gosh. Another brother got shot by the searg'. Another cop got off with no charge. If you black in the hood, you at large. You're guilty until we prove you're innocent. If you're ivory, they treat you different. If you're ebony, they assume you're temperament. Well, be vigilant, and they call you militant. You'll get shot, and they'll say the incident. Is because you're beligerent. What a coincidence?. Wanna brag, but you're still an immigrant. If you ain't dead, you can see imprisonment. It's more niggas in the prisons. Than there ever slaves cotton picking. There's more niggas that's rotting in the prisons. Than there ever slaves cotton picking. So, how we gon' get out the trap?. Guns or books, sell crack or rap. Street livin', hustle or hoops. Guns or books, get shot or shoot. Street livin', ain't no rules. Break the law, make or break the news. The life you choose could be the life you lose. Niggas getting stuck for the Nike shoes. Street livin', ain't no joke. It's a cold world, better bring your coat. Revoke cause the streets are broke. And now, they wanna take away our dreams and hopes. Street livin', no economics. No way out of the Reaganomics. Infected by the black plague, new bubonic. No comprende, we speak ebonics. Street livin', what's your position?. You can take action or take a dick. Listen, you can get fucked by the system. Or you can say fuck the system"

union (feat. sting),"[One for all, one for all]. [It's all it's all for one]. Let's start a union, calling every human. It's one for all and all for one. Let's live in unison, calling every citizen. It's one for all and all for one. We don't want war- can't take no more. It's drastic time for sure. We need a anidote and a cure. Coz do you really think Mohammed got a problem with your whole world. We don't want war - imagine if any prophet was alive. In current days amongst you and I. You think they'd view life like you and I do. Or would they sit and contemplate on why. Do we live this way, act and behave this way. We still live in primitive today. Coz the peace in the destination of war can't be the way. There's no way, so people just be 'em wanna be a man. Realise that you can't change the world by changing yourself. And understand that we're all just the same. So when I count to three let's change. [Chorus]. Got no time for grand philosophy. I barely keep my head above the tide. I got this mortgage, got three kids at school. What you're saying is the truth, but really troubles me inside. I'd change the world if I could change my mind. If I could live beyond my fears. Exchanging unity for all my insecurity. Exchanging laughter for my tears. [Chorus]. I don't know, y'all, we in a real deposition. In the midst of all this negative condition. Divided by beliefs, different sink and religion. Why do we keep missing the point in our mission?. Why do we keep killing each other, what's the reason?. God made us all equal in his vision. I wish that I could make music as a religion. Then we could harmonise together in this mission. Listen, I know it's really hard to make changes. But two of us could help rearrange this curse. Utilising all the power in our voices. Together we will unite and make the right choice. And fight for education, save the next generation. Come together as one. I don't understand why it's never been done. So let's change on the count of one. It takes one, just one. And then one follows the other one. And then another follows the other one. Next thing you know you got a billion. People doing some wonderful things. People doing some powerful things. Let's change and do some powerful things. Unity could be a wonderful thing. [Chorus]"

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed. New days are strange, is the world insane?. If love and peace are so strong. Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?. Nations droppin' bombs. Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones. With ongoin' sufferin'. as the youth die young. So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone. So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong. In this world that we livin' in. people keep on givin' in. Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends. Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother. A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover. The truth is kept secret. it's swept under the rug. If you never know truth. then you never know love. Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know). Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know). Where's the love, y'all. People killin', people dyin'. Children hurt and you hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preach?. Or would you turn the other cheek?. Father, Father, Father help us. Send some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love (Love). Where is the love (The love) ?. Where is the love, the love, the love?. I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder. As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder. Most of us only care about money makin'. Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction. Wrong information always shown by the media. Negative images is the main criteria. Infecting the young minds. Faster than bacteria. Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema. Yo', whatever happened. to the values of humanity. Whatever happened. to the fairness and equality. Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity. Lack of understanding. leading us away from unity. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down. There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under. Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found. Now ask yourself. Where is the love?. Father, Father, Father, help us. Send some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love?. Sing with me y'all. One world, one world (We only got). One world, one world (That's all we got). One world, one world. And something's wrong with it (Yeah). Something's wrong with it (Yeah). Something's wrong with the wo-wo-world, yeah. We only got. (One world, one world). That's all we got. (One world, one world)"
