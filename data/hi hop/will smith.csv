fresh prince of bel-air,"Now this is a story all about how. My life got flipped, turned upside down. And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there. I'll tell you how I became the prince. of a town called Bel-Air. In west Philadelphia born and raised. On the playground is where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out,maxin',relaxin',all cool. And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school. When a couple of guys who were up in no good. Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared. And said: You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air. I begged and pleaded with her day after day,. But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way. She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. I put wy Walkman on and said, ""I might as well kick it."". First class, yo, this is bad. Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. Is this what the people of Bel-Air live like?. Hmm...this might be alright. But wait, I here their Prissy, Booz wine-in all.. Is this the type of place that they should send this cool-cat?. I don't think so, I'll see when I get there,. I hope their prepared for the prince of Bel-Air!. Well-a plane landed and when I came out. there was a dude dressed like a cop stand'n there. with my name out, ""I ant' try to get arrested yet. I just got here!"" I flew like the quickness of light'en disapper.. I whistled for a cab and when it came near. The license plate said fresh and had a dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare. But I thought, ""Now, forget it. Yo home to Bel-Air!"". I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8. And I yelled to the cab yo home smell you later. Looked at my kingdom I was finally there. To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air."

When I was a lad I used to dream that (one day). I'd earned the cream that make phat rocks gleam. Phat rhymes to make it seem that I was like Bill Gates. Writing lines, seal fates. Power to change the whole set. For exposure or forfeit. And with the wicked sense on how to get the picket fence. Envisioned a hot life, hot wife. Wanted a crib, well a palace like South Fork on Dallas. With lights simmer trees for the ambiance. I been up and down and high and low. Fly with dough, broke looking grimy yo. My shiny glow definitely ain't cause of my Bentley. It's something that my fam put in me. Who am I? You ask. The guy with the razzmatazz with ten duffel bags packed with pazazz. In the past cut twice by the ladies of my life. (and the wounds) stitched up by my wife. Who am I?. It's suffice to say found gold in my heart. Put the ice away. Nicer day, live foul homie it's a price to pay. Even when it's rainy still I say it's nice to day. Who am I?. That brother with the platinum plaque. With the strength to stand and say gangsta rap was whack. The fact is that when that brother rap or act. Hold position, front of the pack. Who am I?. [Tatyana Ali]. I be fully educated. Not the one to play with. And I find that some of y'all hate it. But you wanna know baby. Who am I?. I be fully educated. Not the one to play with. And I find that some of y'all hate it.

And I find that some of y'all hate it. But you wanna know baby. Who am I?. (L-Y-T-E). [MC Lyte]. Who am I?. You dare to ask. The same female that hailed from Brooklyn and wailed on that ass. I'm your worst nightmare, you're best wet dream. Break the bank papi cause we're coming for the cream. And while I'm in the world ain't none of y'all safe. Hold face, sell a million and you still won't equate. So who am I? It ain't hard to tell. Like staying on track cause you thinking I fell. See a lot know my face but a few know me well. Just who I am is the one to make ya gel. Who am I? The chick that keeps spittin'. Taking back all my snip that was bitten. Rewritten dangerous laison. With the shades on. Making sure the track stays on. Days on end I'll be that one true friend. That will always be around when the world falls down. I'm honest to the bone. No question, suggest. You don't wanna know. I give the truth, nothing less than. I'm sweet with a heart to fit. Smart as a whip. You feed me well but I'm still hard to get. I'm like a calculus problem hard to solve. Study me well if you wanna get involved. And even after that I'm still unpredictable. Now who am I? I'm unforgettable. [Tatyana Ali]. I be fully educated. Not the one to play with. And I find that some of y'all hate it. But you wanna know baby. Who am I?. I be fully educated. Not the one to play with. And I find that some of y'all hate it. But you wanna know baby. Who am I?.

just the two of us,"(Now dad this is a very sensitive subject). Verse 1. From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms. I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm. Although questions arose in my mind. would I be man enough?. Against wrong, choose right and be standin up. From the hospital that first night. Took a hour just ta get the carseat in right. People drivin all fast, got me kinda upset. Got you home safe, placed you in your basonette. That night I don't think one wink I slept. As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept. Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt. Cause I know I loved you more than life itself. Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please. Let me be a good daddy, all he needs. Love, knowledge, discipline too. I pledge my life to you. Chorus. Just the two of us, we can make it if we try. Just the two of us, (Just the two of us).

But I will test that butt. when you cut outta line, trudat. Uh-uh-uh why you do dat?. I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh. Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy.

To impart. One day some girl's gonna break your heart. And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex. Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son. Throughout life people will make you mad. Disrespect you and treat you bad. Let God deal with the things they do. Cause hate in your heart will consume you too. Always tell the truth, say your prayers. Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears. You're living proof that dreams do come true. I love you and I'm here for you. Chorus. Just the two of us, we can make it if we try. Just the two of us, (Just the two of us). Just the two of us, building castles in the sky. Just the two of us, you and I. (This is a good song dad, how much am I gettin paid for this?)"
this boy is smooth,Well I was cool and sitting by the phone and waiting for. A ring with a female voice or a date or. An invitation to a nightclub for some minglin. But ahh. My phone started jinglin. Picked it up. I checked the rolex first. I call one of my regulars worst come to worst. I said hello. But the voice sounded nervous. Baby relax fp at your service. The girl spoke up and her voice sounded very nice. I met you last week at that club called the paradise. I said yeah babe I'd like to go their again. Get dressed and you better be flossy at ten. Hung up the phone and checked the mirror. Sort of like esp I could hear her. Heart beating encaged with the groove. And all I could say to myself was. Damn this boy is smooth. So I pulled up to the club at the gate where they let celebs in. Entre booted a porsche 9-11 then. Girls took a look at me and started to break. Ladies come down I've already got a date. Cruised up front and I was happy to find her. Tantalising tasty tune named tanya. I said ay yo babe lets not go in the place yet. Come on hope in I got luther in the tape deck. I kicked the gift and the girl was like silly putty. She said lets go some place and chill I said really honey. We went to the beach to take a little walk. I found out I was smoother than I thought. My hands like maverick started to wander. Left and right then wound up behind her. Face to face and chest to chest and ohh like a spindle of silk. Yo this boy is smooth. Here it is. Verse trace. Back at my place. The scene was set because I set it before I left. Girl im like a tool grab me and use me. Where do you want me by the fireplace or the jacuzi. I never slipped yo I got my grip like a handle. Turn down the lights and lit up a candle. A bottle of chilled champagne right beside me. Radio booming pumpin the isley. Maybe I'll grab her and give her a kiss. Or kick her a line on the smooth billy dee tip. Or maybe ill take her outside where the pools at. Smack it up flip it naa im too cool for that. Ahh I know what I'll do. Hold her tightly and caress for a little while. Make it gentle and slow not faster. Pause for the cause and heres a word from the master. Yo I'm the j-a-double z-jazzy. Smooth as self smooth than I have to be. knowing acknowledged recognised that that's the king of the groove. and I'm the man that blessed FP is smooth. ay yo j take me out.

just one of those days,have you ever in your life experienced a day. where nothing at all seems to go your way. no matter how hard you try to get out of the rut. you just could not break the string of bad luck. a day where Murphy's law takes over your life. and you just can't seem to do a darn thing right. and when the day was over you just had to say. you said man it's just one of those days. my day started off kind of cool. I brushed my teeth I comed my hair and I got dressed and went to school. I stopped at the store for a breakfast snack. a tasty cake and orange juice and a bubble yum pack. about that point I proceeded to class. I spoke to all the pretty girls that I passed. I went to my room which was on the first floor. I had no idea what I was in for. I sat in my desk and minded my own business. someone knocked on the door the teacher said who is it. this girl walked in my imigination ran wild. she stole my heart just by the way that she smiled. I couldn't resist so I grabbed her butt. she said what's wrong with you fool are you some kind of nut. the teacher turned around while my arm was extended. she looked me in the face and said Prince you're suspended. I said your tripping it's just a bad habit. she put it in my face she must've wanted me to grab it. I pleaded my case but she wrote the pink slip. then I just shoke my head I said I don't beleive this. she sent me to the head of the discipline staff. I tried to play it off so I started to laugh. I said ha ha this story is great. it's a big misunderstanding one big mistake. he didn't think that it was funny he didn't even smile. he said mmm mmm mmm you're an unlucky child. I stopped laughing and I said why is that. he said just get out my school and don't you ever come back. I said wait this is my school and you're telling me to leave it. he handed me my books and said yep you'd best beleive it. as I walked out the school back at the wall I did gaze. and said man it's just one of those days. I woke up around a quarter to eight. I wiped the sleep from out my eyes and I was feeling great. I flipped my radio on and to my utter surprise. I thought that it was eight o'clock but it was half past nine. I hopped up and put my feet on the floor. ran to the bathroom then I (ow) hit my foot on the door. the pain was immense as it started to throb. I said to hell with broken toes I was losing my job. so I combed my hair then I brushed my teeth. threw on my Fila suit and my Fila sneaks. threw on my Fila underwear and my Fila hat. then I ran downstairs and kicked the fila cat. I grabbed my jacket then I grabbed my keys. then I prayed out loud car start please. the car started but what good was that. I couldn't drive it anyway because the tires were flat. I did the hundred yard dash to the top of my block. then I grabbed a dollar bill from my left sweat sock. the bus pulled up I was late and kind of nervous. I got real mad because the sign said out of service. I started hiking it I wasn't liking it. I saw a little kid I stole his bike and started biking it. I thought I got away but when I ducked around the corner. there was twelve cop cars I said I'm a goner. slamed on the flat I did 180 turn. peddled the bike so fast I heard the rubble burn. with the cops in hot pursuit I started feeling like a jerk. I thought man all of this cause I was trying to get to work. I could've got away I almost had 'em shook. til this girl walked by something said not to look. but I thought what the heck a little peek can't hurt. but she made me miss the sign that said men at work. I screamed out loud as I crashed through the baracade. I saw my whole life flash before my face. I felt kind of dizzy all I saw was stars. I put my hands over my eyes and settled on the handle bars. that was stupid I got off track. cause about that point everything went black. the next thing I remember is a head ache nagging. I woke up face down in the back of a paddy wagon. I pinched myself to make sure I wasn't dead. a big Flinstone lump on the side of my head. they took my picture and my finger prints. I said wait you can't arrest me I'm the Fresh Prince. I demand that you release me you incompetent fool. you can't arrest me I'm the Prince you know the rules. you got five seconds 'fore I punch out your lights. but then the cop pulled out his gun I said ha ha psyche. I had a call so I called my boss. I figured I might as well what else could be lost. boss I'm sorry that I couldn't make it today. he said what are you talking about you're off today is Saturday. stuck in a cell scared as hell. I'm a hungry kind of tired and I hate this awful smell. maybe one day I'll get smart and change my ways. but for now it's just one of those days. it's just one of those days.

if u can't dance (slide) (feat. nicole scherzinger),"[Intro:]. Yo! If you can't dance, its cool to get up now. Usually, ya'll gotta sit on the side, but tonight, it's cool ...slide.... [Chorus]. If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby, left to right all night. Slide that's all you gotta do... You can't dance then this is your jam, baby. Left to right all night, slide, that's all you gotta do. Now we all know the boy at the club, all liquored up,. Boy with the bub tryin' to pick 'em up, wack dancing,. 'Wooking pa nub', shirt too bright, pants too tight. Boy settle down. Now I ain't just messing with you. I got better things to do. I'm trying to help, I got a lesson for you. I know you do the best you could do. Wanna get next to Boo, then the less you do the better. Cause women equate dance with sex. They gon' see you & be like, 'Next'!. But you gon' be like, 'hold up Ma' ('Next!'). But she gon' be like, uh huh, ('Next!'). Now looka-here, rule #1, know ya name,. if it ain't Usher, Justin or Hammer, then we can touch ya. Rule #2, never do a dance you can't do, why stupid,. Cause you can't do it. [Chorus]. So I'm up in my spot in Miami the other night, right. & this Dude's out on the floor Od-ing, just way 'over-dancing'. So his Mommy wanna holla at me. She thought my name was Billy, I told her it was Willie. She said she watch my Tv show & I was very silly. Told her I was from Philly she looked at me said, 'Really?'. & judging from her t-shirt, I could tell that she was chilly. So I gave her my sweater, she said her name was Etta. She said she come from Cuba and she just had bought a Jetta. She said she was glad I met her, let's go somewhere together. She said she'd ride in my car cause she knew that it was better. The conversation cookin', attention getting' tookin'. My Spidey senses tinglin', I felt somebody lookin'. Now who this brotha lookin', & now he runnin', bookin'. I'm mad I'm like a fisherman, I almost had my hook in. I figured I should get up & quickly clear my head up,. Cause Etta got a man & I'm feelin' kinda set-up. Now Dude was really fed up & yo, he wouldn't let up. Homey if I hit you, you might never ever get up. Now he was not a dancer, plus he wasn't handsome. Comin' like Mel Gibson, like I had his girl for ransom. Yo, Pedro wanna go out side, yo amigo, tranquillo... slide. [Chorus]. Now rule #3 is easy, please remember that you ain't on ""Beat Street"". Sweet feet, you ain't tryin' to win no Tv, another dude did a move. No need to out do it. Rule #4, out on the floor, don't be doing moves that don't nobody do no more. Draw too much attention to be adventurous out on the floor. There's a reason that don't nobody do 'em no more, you feel me?. This may be hilarious, but Rule #5 is serious, it's a shame that we have. to discuss. That there's no lip biting or pelvic thrusts. I mean you think that move will put the sting on her,. you too close, tryin' to put a ring on her?. You don't know that girl, don't cling on her & don't put your thing on. her...cool?!. [Chorus]"
the reverend,"Now brothers and sisters. There comes a time in your life you've got to get up and get busy. Can I get a witness?. (Yes, brother, yes!). Now I don't know if you're prepared to embark upon this journey. But the time is running out. Brother Jazzy, break it down. . Liggedy-ladies and gentlemen, hello, and how are you doin all?. Now there's a problem that we really have got to solve. In our society there's a big mess. People are having entirely too much stress. Now me and Jeff, yo, we've been workin on. A way to ease your everyday burdens of. Work and school, because we thought that we should. Make a record that makes people feel good. This is a remedy, simple and basic.

Relax, come on, cool out, come and get some. You gotta let yourself go get loose, it's. Cool - dance to the music. . TGIF this beat is def. Can I get a witness, Jeff? (Yes). Are you ready to start things off yet?. Aight bet. Clap your hands and dance, come on, let's do this. Here is a hip-hop track with a new twist. Designed to ignite ya subliminal dance fuse. And even if you can't dance, you can't lose!. It's for everybody, you included. We hooked up a beat and a rhyme and eq'ed it. We put it on a tape and took it to wax. And then we - yo Jeff, where's my beat at?. Oh, there it is, back to the story line. The music and rhymin designed to make you have a (good time). At the party, or wherever you hear it pumpin. Get up and twist or breakdance or shake somethin. Yo man, this groove is all of that!. And it's different from anything we've done, in fact. I might even go as far as to say. This cut shines bright on the darkest day. And sometimes you really need some light. Like when your teacher or boss ain't actin right. This will quench your thirst to chill, it hits the spot. Give em a taste, yo Jeff, let the beat rock. Now Brother Jazzy. Please enlighten us with a bassline. And for all the people assembled before us. Brother Jazzy, scratch. We're at the top, not the bottom or the middle. We're the freshest, the deffest, the best, Jeff, cut it up a little. (Oh, I get it, you wanna dance!). oh the time is now to get up and dance and move. And clap and jump and jam and feel the groove. I want you wigglin and jigglin and stompin and shakin. And showin your approval for the records me and Jeff are makin. We got a brand new album out. And dancin and shakin and movin is what it's all about. We want everybody to get busy. You're not down with the rap then get with it. This is a new age, history turned a new page. They said that we would decay and I say who do they. Think they're dealing with, a couple of amateurs?. I'm willin to bet to where this jam hits. At your job and at your school dance and also on the radio. Winter inside the house, summer on the patio. Let me get out of here before I lose it. But remember the motto, y'all: dance to the music. Now now. Ladies and gentlemen of the congregation. We realize you may not be in a position to get up and dance right now. So we'd like to ask of you, if you're in your car, honk your horn. Honk your horn to the rhythm. We'd like to ask, if you're behind the desk at your job. We'd like you to tap your pen and pencil to the rhythm. If you're walkin down the street. You can be a little discreet. And snap your fingers to the beat. But if you are in a position. To get up and dance. We'd like to ask you to wiggle and jiggle and everything you got. And get involved with it. This has been the Reverend signin off. Signin off. Signin off."

[Prince, Barber] there was press conference to see what training I was doing. before then I had never heard reporters booing. cameras flashing I was in the middle. I didn't wanna look dumb so I exagerrated a little. I said uh I been training 2o hours a day lifting big old cars and big bails of hay (that's what he's doin'). and I run 10,000 miles every morning thinkin' about Mike and my moment of glory (tell 'em more). I drink water 20 gallons a pop and I can throw a Volkswagon a whole half block (he can do it too). and 4 million sit ups...in a minute.... ..I ain't lying I did it (he done it). the general public thought I was a fool. I was gettin' dissed but I guess that was cool. well gettin' dissed is never good. but I was even gettin' dissed in my old nieghborhood.

Came through the maze & the haze & played it perfect. Days any person hated & cursed him, he was unfazed. He waited, it was worth it, he never retaliated. He saved it, slavin', on the road blazin'. Days when he was low, nothin' could raise him. He came to the show & somethin' uncaged in him. Like the pope, but its party crusade, I'm like braids that's never gon'. fade (ya heard). I'm like, 23's on an Escalade, throw me into the rave. like you threw a grenade - BOOM!!. [CHORUS]. [VERSE 3]. I call for the days of the unadulterated. When the artistry was cultivated. You know, back when rap was smart and multilayered. We could rap without A&Rs& ultimatums (damn). Now today I could say I long for the days when the party was all about. partyin'. I was a mini-party starter then. My mind bends when I call my pen. The big question should I run the mind a vittle. Food for thought or dumb the rhyme a little. But Will ""if you come to high that'll alienate folks & they won't buy. it""(yo),. Look, people getting trapped in the track. & they be clappin', even when the rappin' is wack. Yo, what happened, when did we get happy wit that?. He's old-fashioned (yup), but let's be happy he's back. (Ya heard me!). [CHORUS]. . -=|† ÐJAME§ †|=-"
brand new funk,"James Brown- ""get down"". [Fresh Prince] It's new, it's out of the ordinary. It's rather extrordinary,. so yo bust this commentary. A literary, genius, and a superior beat creator. have come together, and we made a. musical composition which we think is a remedy. to cure all the dance floors that's empty. You wanna dance? We got what you want. Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk. -Get down brand new funk-hit it. It was kind of an accident, the way that it happened. One day I was rappin, and on the beat, Jeff was backin me up. And all of a sudden, he brought in a cut And I dropped my microphone and said, ""What the...? Hold up, Jeff, wait a minute, play it"". He just smiled and said, ""Yeah def ain't it?"". It was {funky} it made wanna {get, get down!} And we knew almost at once it was the {brand new funk}. So we continued to listen to it. And we knew it was def when I started rappin to it. So I gave a hi-five to Jeff and without hesitation popped in my cassette. I took it home that night, and analyzed it. Rewound the tape over and over, and memorized it. That Friday, we went to the club And out and out cold tore it up!. You shoulda seen the people dancin and shakin and movin and jumpin and spinnin and clappin, while the beatboxin was groovin and screamin and yellin while on the microphone I was flowin. Fresh rhymes I was showin, the people say, ""Yo keep goin"" So I continued to rock, while Jeff was on the beatbox Special assistance from my homeboy Ready Rock. People barged just to get up front to get a bird's eye view of what we call the brand new funk. Ge-Ge-Get down-hit it. Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat with your hands..}. Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Now get funky with the beat!. Jeff starts spinning backwards * Now turn it all around!. The most original, amazing, astounding, miraculous remarkable, startling, sensational, stupendous music. that has ever been created is ours - but believe me it was complicated. But we have done it, so now we can breathe a long awaited sigh of relief. This isn't a publicity stunt It's the raw untouched, pure, hard brand new funk!. {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * {Rock the beat with your hands..} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * {Rock the beat with your hands..}."
chasing forever,"Early mornin' wake up. Gently with the Caress on your hand. And that Kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan. Sunshine peekin through the venitian blinds. Four years, and like wine, you got finer with time. I got a question, if the prodda dressin and the Gucci. All got goes, and the freeze on the Lucci. I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough. Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us?. Don't answer quick, think about it cause I'm askin for real. Golddiggers goin' to hear this song drivin and crash at the wheel. Forever is a long time, so far we gettin along fine. No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw. No music I ever made, ain't nothin I wanted more. We could deal with whatever together. Sunshine, all that other weather, when we chasin forever. Chorus:. I wanna stay with you forever. I wanna spend all my life with only you. I wanna stay, lets stay together. Chasing forever, with only you. Verse 2:. Chasin forever, a buckwild, endeavorous scene. Should we pursue with somethin real or just chasin a dream. Or casin' the scene. Fore I die I plan. To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands. Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin for sure. But I'm committed to growin and coming at you mature. In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good. But when we feelin the hurt, if we willin to work. The eight ball will never turn to see us behind. Though I ain't no knight, and my armor don't shine. My mom said the lynch pin of love is trust. An taught me monogomy is uh, monogamous. Plus, for you dinner by candlelight. Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right. It's a race to a strange place, most see never. It's a chase we gotta make together, forever. Chorus. Verse 3:. Now you would think after all my heartbreaks I'd be cruel. Hiding behind my ego, evil but no. Much the contrary, I'm very much certain. You searchin for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin. Finally found a person, worthy of all. Instead of pushin me down, you wanna cushion my fall. Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing. Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring. More carrats than even bugs could eat in a week. An the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes don't peek. I'll tell you what I see in the future. A hacienda so cute with, five little kids callin you mom and callin me dad. Havin more good times than JJ had. Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it. Let no man sever, welcome to forever. Chorus to fade."

afro angel,"(Ooh, Ohh). Here I stand before you - brown.. Color of the mountains. Colossal as the earth. Wrapped so deliciously within my own joy and misery. Feathers of my wings paralyzed by the distance of my mind. Here I stand before you, the color of the night. Frozen by the potential of me. (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh) An Afro Angel. Afro Angel off your pedestal from perchin above. You on the prowl now, downtown, searchin for love. In all the wrong places, outside your radio stations. Hopin he with new hit single, is tryin to mingle. Today, he is in your town, puttin it down. You in the car with your friends, followin my limo around. Puttin a bug in my boy's ear, your ""S"" is for free. You'll do anything for Omar or Phil, bring you to me. And then me, hypnotized by the devil as well. Hold out my hand as an invitation into my hotel. No need to RSVP, place your hand in my palm. As all your girlfriends getting jealous, damn she landed the bomb. Willing to trade your spirit for some crass, whack wage. Something small, something simple as a pass back stage. But now I lay me, down to creep. And I - pray the Lord my soul to keep. Chorus:. Afro Angel, born against the world. You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride. Afro Angel, sent from heaven above. Never forget that you are loved. You know that you are loved. Lil Bobby got a gun now, age fifteen. Destined to spend his life inside a cage it seems. Rage inside, pride, been denied respect. He can't take it though he gotta earn it. But he ain't learned that yet. Out on the town, reckless abandon he's been bullied before. But now he straps, and no more. Attitude high. Flexin on every guy that walk by. But don't start pal. Cuz if the gun came from the whiz, Cowardly Lion, got heart now. Let's pull it on a stranger. Ahh, fun for the crew. Surprised when he realized, damn dude got one too. Smile's upside down now, games ain't so cute. Bobby's a deer in a headlights. Pump, drop it or I'll shoot. Then like a sniper, cleanin his rifle, Bobby disobeys his commands. One shot rings out (gunshot) then only the stranger stands. Could of sworn Bobby's blood formed the shape of an angel's wings. But for what?. Chorus:. Afro Angel, born against the world. You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride. Afro Angel, sent from heaven above. Never forget that you are loved. You know that you are loved. Back in high school, Tamika was the sweetest, the bomb. Hot to death, though in tenth grade a teenage mom. Knocked up by some thug named Russ in the drug game. But had the cutest kid you ever seen. Then all the pressure from her mom. She stepped to Russ. Told him it's either them drugs or us. Either them thugs or us. The ultimatum, either continue bein a thug in the world. Or start lovin your girl. And say God, bear me witness, no doubt, lovin ya dear. But to go from $50 Gees a week to $30 Gees a year. That ain't happenin. I guess he wasn't that strong. He came back the next week, and the whole family was gone. Yo they straight moved away, without as little as a word. Well, needless to say, Russ was a little perturbed. Then in a fury put the pressure on her girlfriend Shawn. And like a clumsy chef she spilled the beans on where they had gone. Upstate Schenectady,. Tamika answered the door. It was the last person she expected to be. They just stared. He said you love me for me?. You can do without the cars, vacations, and jewelry?. Down with me?. Period.. Through life's stress and strife. She said, Yeah, He said in that case. Would you please be my wife?. Then like a sign from the sky, the baby cried. Like an angel sings. I love y'all more than anything. Chorus:. Afro Angel, born against the world. You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride. Afro Angel, sent from heaven above. Never forget that you are loved. You know that you are loved. (Repeat Chorus)."
ain't no place like home,"I'm feeling sad (yeah). I'm feeling sad (yeah). I'm feeling sad (yeah). I'm feeling sad (yeah). I'm feeling sad (yeah). Sitting in a hotel room. A thousand miles away from nowhere. Sloped over a chair as I stare. Out the window I sigh as I'm thinking. I take a sip of the juice I been drinking. I'm trapped inside of me. Lost in the memory. Of how things used to be. I think somebody better call a doctor quick. Oh never mind I'm just a little homesick. Thinking of my mum and my dad. And when I was young good damn I was a bad boy. I remember playing catch a girl, kiss a girl. Like a sucker getting slapped every time I pucker. But I kept on chasin. Kept on running kept coming like Jason. Much nostalgia keeps bouncing through. -chorus-. There's no place like home (yeah). I'm feeling sad. I'm feeling sad I'm feeling sad. There's no place like home. I'm feeling sad. I'm feeling sad. There's no place like home. Yo there ain't no place like home. And I'm itching for the hood when I cross the states I roam. On tour getting the crowds going wild and. Stacking the honeys in a pile and putting em on file. XL a paragon on the scene. Fancy hotels and getting chauffeured in a limousine. Travel the world and yet my heart is achin. I be Yearning and burning for my mums eggs and bacon. Yo, there ain't no place like home, place like home. Ain't no place like home. Uh, I feel like Dorothy so I tries it. Kicks my heels but my Jordans wouldn't 'ize it. So back to reality. Back to Philly, get back to my family. It's fun to see strange places. But sometimes I wanna see familiar faces. Like charlie mack, bam, nut and wood. Names kinda funny but as friends go real good. Ain't no place like home for true. And that's why. There's no place like home (yeah). I'm feeling sad. I'm feeling sad I'm feeling sad. There's no place like home. I'm feeling sad. I'm feeling sad. There's no place like home. I'm feeling sad. There's no place like home. I'm feeling sad. I'm feeling sad I'm feeling sad. There's no place like home. I'm feeling sad. I'm feeling sad. There's no place like home. Sitting in an airport my mouth watering. It's thanks giving day I'm just putting my order in. I call my mum on the phone kind a demanding. Don't stop cooking mum at seven I'm landing. She just laughed and said I don't intend to. My grandma picked up and then she ran the menu. There was turkey and stuffed corn and macaroni and cheese. And sweet potato pies ooh grandma please. On the plane now my mind drifting. Thinking of the way it used to be on Christmas. My mum used to put us to bed about nine. Saying it's, ""o f t baby, ol' folks time"". That'd be down stairs laughing and jamming. But then (boo) raise ya seats back for landing. I walked in the house I felt the love. And my grandma saw me and screamed. Now here come all the hugging. I got such a feeling of emotion and love. Because can't nobody can hug you the way your grandma does. Give me a shovel and put some feed on my plate. My father said grace right before we all ate. And after he was finished I put a p.s. on. I said yo, ""there ain't no place like home. And I thank God to be here with all of you"". Cause I was feeling. Feeling sad. I'm feeling sad. There's no place like home. I'm feeling sad. I'm feeling sad I'm feeling sad. There's no place like home. I'm feeling sad. I'm feeling sad. There's no place like home. On behalf of DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince. We'd like to take this opportunity to wish y'all a (There's no place like home). Happy Thanksgiving and a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. And all that sumthin sumthin (There's no place like home). But we'd also like to encourage you. To take this opportunity to pause (There's no place like home). Just take a minute and stop and look around at your family. And thank God for them (There's no place like home). Because they not always be here with you. Peace. There's no place like home. I'm feeling sad. I'm feeling sad. There's no place like home."
as we go,"As we go a little somethin like this, hit it. Now let's get this party, started off the right way. Ow and ho I think the crowd might say. When we're on stage you know you can't resist. (As we go a little somethin like this, hit it). I'm the ultimate, and that's all I can say. I sat down for about eight hours a day. Tryin to figure out the proper description of me. And I came to the decision that there's no one syllable or phrase. That can adequately describe this new craze. But I'll sum it up in one sentence, let's see. Okay I've got it all praise me. Yup that's about the size of it. I know it sounds kinda strange, doesn't it. But when we're on the stage you know you can't resist. (As we go a little somethin like this, hit it). (As we go a little somethin like this, hit it). It was a Friday afternoon if I remember it correctly. But I can't quite recall the time exactly. But it was somewhere around, two or three or four. Oh forget it, let's just go on. Anyway I stepped out of school. Sneaks were Gucci shirt was Polo and my pockets were full. Blew some kisses to the girlies cause I like to tease. They started chantin my name, I said, ladies please. I grabbed my friends and hopped in my Benz. Grabbed on Martini and Rossi passed out to my posse. Things were lookin good, I had plans for later on. Plans for Donna Michelle, plans for Stacy LeShaun. Word I was ready, I wonder if Jeff's home. Let me give him a call, on my car phone. Yo Jeff, what's shakin Coolin, whassup. Girlies I'm with it, come pick me up. I caught up with Ready on the way to Jeff's. A whole carload of girlies and they all was def. We walked into Jeff's and said, Girls, you can't resist. (As we go a little somethin like this, hit it). {*Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches Slick Rick*. ""As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!""}. Yo Jeff man, are you with me (Hit it). I didn't hear you man, are you with me (Hit it). I'm with it to get busy. (somethin like this, hit it). Ready Rock C, give Jeff a hand!. (As we go a little somethin like this, hit it). Throw away them jams cause you don't need em any more. Cause this hip-hop hit is gonna keep you on the floor. If you dance everyday or if you never danced before. It doesn't matter if it's (somethin like this). Time is essential so let's make the best of it. Today we don't have a lot of time, so let's not throw it all away. Let's use this time in a very special way. Let's use it, (somethin like this). I went outside at about 12:30. I saw a couple girlies, and they were lookin pretty good if you know what I mean. So I freshened my breath and stepped on the scene (hit it). I walked over to em, stepped in between them. One said to the other, I think that I've seen him somewhere before. I said sweetheart, you might have. She said oh yeah it was last night at that party. I said yeah I tried to talk to you there but you were acting as if you were scared. She said I'm not scared now I said Bet, well let's go then. She said but hold up, what about my friend. I said I got a friend. So the three of us left. Went back to my crib and gave a call to Jeff. Five minutes later, Jeff walked in. and I thought to myself yeah, now the fun begins. But the girls started buggin, and they said. Now we want dinner in the best restaurant in town. We want caviar and lobster tails, both by candlelight and Don Perignon I said yeah right. Y'all must be crazy, and Jeff said you know. I really think it's time for these ladies to go. We walked em to the door and told em they were dismissed and it went a little (somethin like this). But that was okay that was alright. Cause we still had fun that night ya know it. The moral of the story is plain and visible. We always watch out for those kind of women. But the past is the past and the present is the present. And we feel that everyone should be sitting down. (so you all don't miss). (As we go a little somethin like this, hit it)."

born to reign,I believe in God. I believe in destiny. Not destiny in a sense of all our actions being pre-determined. But destiny in the sense of our ability to choose. Our ability to choose who we are and who we are supposed to be. Yo yo yo yo. I was born to reign. Point blank my name. To be etched in stone. My destiny pre-ordained. Tryin' to live righteous. Fightin' for life; 'tis my life. And that's why I go light to my vices. Tightening the vices of truth on the ruthless. Is rhyme and the crime is they minds is just useless. The path to the poison. The genesis of the genecide. You and your boys tryin' to decide. What to write but your pen is a sword. And the blade has been forged. Young minds get engorged. States have been altered by liquor by weed. And then hate gets exalted as art falls to greed. Choices is made as the voices is laid. On the track contract. Your soul's the way you sold your rage. Did you see his new Benz?. But you're mic a syringe. Now we're proud of your venge (?). Got alot of new friends. Got alot of new ends. Bought a house up in the hills. Frontin' shouts to the pen. Giving false accounts of your accounts' amounts. Amounts to fan treason. Stands to reason. Since your inception laced with deception. And bred false affection it must perish. From my terrace. I see the fire burnin' the streets. But I won't shield my eyes to the heat. Born to reign. I was born to reign. I was born to reign.
brand new funk,"James Brown- ""get down"". [Fresh Prince] It's new, it's out of the ordinary. It's rather extrordinary,. so yo bust this commentary. A literary, genius, and a superior beat creator. have come together, and we made a. musical composition which we think is a remedy. to cure all the dance floors that's empty. You wanna dance? We got what you want. Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk. -Get down brand new funk-hit it. It was kind of an accident, the way that it happened. One day I was rappin, and on the beat, Jeff was backin me up. And all of a sudden, he brought in a cut And I dropped my microphone and said, ""What the...? Hold up, Jeff, wait a minute, play it"". He just smiled and said, ""Yeah def ain't it?"". It was {funky} it made wanna {get, get down!} And we knew almost at once it was the {brand new funk}. So we continued to listen to it. And we knew it was def when I started rappin to it. So I gave a hi-five to Jeff and without hesitation popped in my cassette. I took it home that night, and analyzed it. Rewound the tape over and over, and memorized it. That Friday, we went to the club And out and out cold tore it up!. You shoulda seen the people dancin and shakin and movin and jumpin and spinnin and clappin, while the beatboxin was groovin and screamin and yellin while on the microphone I was flowin. Fresh rhymes I was showin, the people say, ""Yo keep goin"" So I continued to rock, while Jeff was on the beatbox Special assistance from my homeboy Ready Rock. People barged just to get up front to get a bird's eye view of what we call the brand new funk. Ge-Ge-Get down-hit it. Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat with your hands..}. Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Now get funky with the beat!. Jeff starts spinning backwards * Now turn it all around!. The most original, amazing, astounding, miraculous remarkable, startling, sensational, stupendous music. that has ever been created is ours - but believe me it was complicated. But we have done it, so now we can breathe a long awaited sigh of relief. This isn't a publicity stunt It's the raw untouched, pure, hard brand new funk!. {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * {Rock the beat with your hands..} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * {Rock the beat with your hands..}."

caught in the middle,Caught (in life). In the middle (in love). Caught (in life). In the middle (in love). Caught (in life). In the middle (in love). Caught (in life). In the middle (in love). Caught (in life). In the middle (in love). Love and life a mysterious combo. Sit back relax cause now its time to go. Back in my past my personal strife for being. Caught in the middle of love and life. Love is a fairytale earthly bond. But life is true reality chimes. When life brings on love is kind of hard for you to give up. The satisfaction you started for. This is a metaphor sort of a riddle. If your confused chill and I'm sure it'll. Clear up for you in a little bit. Love and life and I'm caught in the middle of it. The middle. Caught. The middle. Who or why your love ain't always right. Especially when you cross the pass of life. The wrath of life is hard. Cause your taught to dream on. But when your out in the world realities on. You found somebody to be with. You pour your lovin in and it seems as if. Your pouring your love into a bottomless pit. You love each other but it just ain't workin. Your not meant to be together it seems like. Well just think maybe its things like. She work 9 to 5 you work 5 to 9. Never together two separate lives. Love versus life see what I mean. You like the movies she like the club scene. Nobody's wrong and nobody's right. Just caught in the middle of love and life. Caught (in life). In the middle (in love). Caught (in life). In the middle (in love). Caught (in life). In the middle (in love). Caught (in life). In the middle (in love). Caught (in life). In the middle (in love). Everybody wants to capture the rapture. Love and live happily ever after. Walking around barefoot sniffing daisies. Laying around all day long making babies. Go to france and dancin eatin in sweden. Gambling in rio. Winning cause your cheating. These are situations you can have some fun in. But open your eyes and real life comes running in. Dreaming again a plateau to come down off. Back to the world and see your love life sounds off. Start the day right call your girlfriend. But love and life start at it again. She says baby I need to send you. You say babe I got work to tend to. Love tells you to go be with her. But life says boy get your butt to work. Think of love and life as a rock and a hard place. Exhilarating like a high speed car chase. Heart ache heart break cuts like a knife. Caught in the middle of love and life. Caught (in life). In the middle (in love). Caught (in life). In the middle (in love). Caught (in life). In the middle (in love). Caught (in life). In the middle (in love). Caught (in life). (in love). Caught (in life).

charlie mack (1st out of the limo),"(so damn tough). (fresh). (so damn tough). Everywhere we go downtown or to a show. We have two necessities Charlie Mack and our limo. He's feared by suckers yet he's loved by kids. Pay attention and let me tell you who Charlie Mack is. He is our homeboy from around the block. He's regarded through the city as the hip-hop cop. Height about 6'6"", weight about 290. Everywhere I go Charlie Mack is right behind me. He never laughs, never smiles nor sweats. He doesn't breaks arms or legs, only spines or necks. He once killed a man cause he would not let go of his Ego. Apollo Creed is a sucker Charlie Mack could be Drago. He could bench about three hundred pounds. The cops all take a vacation, when Charlie's in town. He's the toughest around so everywhere that I go he goes. He's Charlie Mack and he's the first out the limo. (So damn tough). I guess you're wondering why he's the first out the limo, yo, let me give you this bit of info. So you'll know the things that Charlie can do and you'll know every single reason why he's down with the crew. The limo picks us up about a half past six. With the radio blasting our latest hit. It's me Jeff Ready Rock, Omar and J.L.. Charlie Mack is up front as we depart the hotel. First we cause chaos throughout the city streets. Then maybe stop at Burger King for a bite to eat. And if somebody gets stupid while we're in the place. Charlie cancels his order and bites off their face. He's not a troublemaker in fact, he's a trouble breaker. And if somebody gets dumb, well it'll only take a second or two, after some fools snaps. Law and order is restored by my hero Charlie Mack. Wheel off into the limo, and head for the jam. Charlie cracks all the knuckles, on both of his hands. And when we pull up to the show, the routine is unrehearsed. It's just natural that we let Charlie hop out first. He clears the crowd without saying a word man. That's the loudest silence I've ever heard. A lot of times guys test him, by trying to bug. He just, leaves ring imprints, all over their mugs. He's a terminator, a Hercules of sorts. Man to hell with chess, he likes physical sports. You may not have known before but now you know. The reason why Charlie Mack is the first out the limo. (So damn tough). We'd like to apologise to all of our fans. But please don't touch us when we're at our jams. Cause Charlie don't like folks around us when we're doing a show. And if he punches you, uh-oh, better get Mako. Still you weak rap dudes tempers are hot. Just because I've got something that you ain't got. If you want to get physical, rowdy or try to bomb me. I won't get excited, I'll just say Yo Charlie. You should a been kind, you shouldn't have snapped. Charlie only hit you once and now you're taking a nap. And when he leaves you decapitated, crushed in the dust. You'll look up, and see your girl in the limo with us. You may think that's enough boy but I think not. Charlie kick his face again I think you missed a spot. I roll down the limo window and yell by the way eyes. You'll see your girl buck naked giving Charlie a massage. I'm serious I'm not joking no doubt. You know how many doubters' bones have been broken. You may not have known before but now you know. The reason why Charlie Mack is the first out the limo. . Charlie Mack the first out the limo. He's Charlie Mack the first out the limo. In closing, we'd like to say this, to you bustas. If you're sceptical you'll probably get beat up, plus kid. Embarrassed and laughed at, by all of your friends. And if you cross Charlie Mack it's the beginning of the end. Of life as you know it, you might not die, sir. But if you're not dead, you'll wish you were. But if you still wanna bug out, homeboy let's go. You can bug with Charlie Mack cause he's the first out the limo. He's Charlie Mack and he's the first out the limo."
chasing forever,"Early mornin' wake up. Gently with the Caress on your hand. And that Kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan. Sunshine peekin through the venitian blinds. Four years, and like wine, you got finer with time. I got a question, if the prodda dressin and the Gucci. All got goes, and the freeze on the Lucci. I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough. Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us?. Don't answer quick, think about it cause I'm askin for real. Golddiggers goin' to hear this song drivin and crash at the wheel. Forever is a long time, so far we gettin along fine. No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw. No music I ever made, ain't nothin I wanted more. We could deal with whatever together. Sunshine, all that other weather, when we chasin forever. Chorus:. I wanna stay with you forever. I wanna spend all my life with only you. I wanna stay, lets stay together. Chasing forever, with only you. Verse 2:. Chasin forever, a buckwild, endeavorous scene. Should we pursue with somethin real or just chasin a dream. Or casin' the scene. Fore I die I plan. To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands. Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin for sure. But I'm committed to growin and coming at you mature. In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good. But when we feelin the hurt, if we willin to work. The eight ball will never turn to see us behind. Though I ain't no knight, and my armor don't shine. My mom said the lynch pin of love is trust. An taught me monogomy is uh, monogamous. Plus, for you dinner by candlelight. Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right. It's a race to a strange place, most see never. It's a chase we gotta make together, forever. Chorus. Verse 3:. Now you would think after all my heartbreaks I'd be cruel. Hiding behind my ego, evil but no. Much the contrary, I'm very much certain. You searchin for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin. Finally found a person, worthy of all. Instead of pushin me down, you wanna cushion my fall. Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing. Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring. More carrats than even bugs could eat in a week. An the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes don't peek. I'll tell you what I see in the future. A hacienda so cute with, five little kids callin you mom and callin me dad. Havin more good times than JJ had. Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it. Let no man sever, welcome to forever. Chorus to fade."

could u love me?,"Yo, Big Will in the place to be, mic check...mic check... Would you love me in the shack in a shanty town. Would you love me if my pants was hand me downs, huh?. Yo, yo,. Often times I hear a phrase when I'm out & about. 8 to 80, all walks of life be shouting it out. Usually, when its time for a encore I hear it. Or when I did something hot, evoking the spirit. It's weird, its like a double edge sword when ya'll applaud. It's kinda wild, a peace sign, a smile. How do I respond to the phrase, ""I love you Will!""?. Kinda heavy when I hear it, I'd be like damn for real?. In a way it makes me wanna stay strong and moral. But history say I could be gone tomorrow. & though my future looks floral. I feel like I'm hoping for much pain. When people stop shouting my name. & doubting my game & liking others better than me. Writing letters to him instead of to me. A veteran 'B', I know the game, but do me this here,. In your heart be clear before you bless my ear. Come on... [CHORUS]. Could you love me if I lived in a shanty town. Could you love me if my pants was hanging down. Could you love me if my wrist ain't bling. If I wasn't on TV & I ain't sing, huh?. Could you love me if my whip wasn't chrome fitted. Would my name be easier to forget it, huh?. Could you love me if wrist ain't bling. If I wasn't on TV & I ain't sing, huh?. I pray before I sit with a pen & a pad. A birth of a thought occurs & it calls me Dad. To the universe an idea released from me. Just a CD, nah man, a piece of me. What you can't see is when you be dancing 'B'. Is I asked you a question, that's how you answer me. So when you don't dance, it be like I'm choking from cancer. Like I wrote rancid rhymes, I can't survive. Sure, I rationalize like, oh, I see... But if you don't like my cut, its like you don't like me. Some stuff works, some works not so well. Its like you work so hard, still get hurt like hell. Yo, it could tear you apart. But don't let your wins go to your heard. Your losses go to your heart. & if we ever get the pleasure to meet. Be clever with it, measure what you yell in the street. Come on.... [CHORUS]. Whoo, would you...... Whoo, could you...... [CHORUS]"

der prinz von bel-air,"Now this is the story all about how my life got twisted upside down and I'd like to take a minute just sittin right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air. In West Philadelphia I'm born and raised on a playground is. where I've spent the most of my days chilling out, maxing,. relaxing all cool and all shooting some b-ball outside of. the school when a couple of guys, they were up to no good. started making trouble in my neighbourhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared and said ""you're moving with your aunte and uncle in Bel-Air"". I begged and pleaded with her day after day but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way she gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket I put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it. First class, yo this is bad, drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass if this's what the people of Bel-Air livin' like, hmm this might be alright!. I whistled for a cab and when it came near the licensplate said ""Fresh"" and had a dice in the mirror if anything I could say that this cab was rare but I thought now forget it, go home to Bel-Air. I pulled up to the house about seven or eight and I yelled to the cabby ""Go, home smell you later"" looked at my kingdom I was finally there to sit my throne as the prince of Bel-Air"
don't even try it,"[ Fresh Prince ]. Yo Jeff, what's shakin, man?. [ Jazzy Jeff ]. What's up, dude?. [ Fresh Prince ]. Hey man, you remember that girl I knew. I walking to school, man. The one who used to diss me every day?. [ Jazzy Jeff ]. Yeah. [ Fresh Prince ]. When the record came out she called me two days ago, man. [ Jazzy Jeff ]. Man, my phone is ringin off the hook. With people askin me for tapes and free records. I - man, I ain't with it. [ Fresh Prince ]. Word man. Bust this. [ Fresh Prince ]. This rap is for you people in the past who were against me. Who snatched up every opportunity to dis me. Put me down like I was nothin, treated me like a jerk. Now I'm seein the pay-off of all my hard work. Cause now that it's MY records on the wheels. Somehow all of a sudden it's a whole new deal. So for those in the past who dissed me, don't deny it. What, you're sorry? Huh - don't even try it!. [ Jazzy Jeff ]. Word man. [ Fresh Prince ]. Man, people are a trip, man. [ Jazzy Jeff ]. Put everybody down about what's up with that. [ Fresh Prince ]. Yo word, man. I gotta let em know. I gotta. [ Jazzy Jeff ]. Bust this. [ Fresh Prince ]. I used to know this girl by the name of Theresa. I did all I could to make her release her. Emotions to me, but she just wouldn't do it. She built up a wall and I couldn't break through it. I used to walk to school every day of the week. Watchin Theresa walk on the other side of the street. One day I finally got my heart up to speak. But she dissed me and dismissed me with a smack on my cheek. So I bought six bottles of new fancy cologne. But all I got from Theresa was (Leave me alone!). I bought new clothes to wear everyplace. But all Theresa would say was (Get out of my face!). So I gave up this quest for Theresa. But then on the day my record was released, a. Strange thing happened when it came on the radio. Theresa broke her neck just to say (Hello..). I looked at her, I said, ""You must be foolish. Why did you ignore me on the way to school if. You were interested?"" She said (Oh, I apologize). I looked deep into her dark brown eyes. I said, ""You ignored me for months on and. Now all of a sudden you wanna be my friend?. You didn't talk before, so don't talk now, be quiet. What, you really like me? Huh - don't even try it!"". [ Jazzy Jeff ]. Man - she had a lotta nerve, man. [ Fresh Prince ]. Word man. Hey man, but she ain't had half as much nerve as that old record producer, man. Remember when he dissed us, man?. [ Jazzy Jeff ]. What - what up?. [ Fresh Prince ]. When I first started rappin I had one idea. And it was set in my mind very vivid and clear. I knew that I wanted to be a rap artist. I would give my all and work my hardest. But when I took my song to a record producer. He told me that I better go drink some rap juice, or. Something, cause my song was really absurd. He said that it was the worst trash that he'd ever heard. You know my ego was shattered, he busted my groove. I could hear him crackin up as I left the booth (Ha-haaa!). I thought my song was good but he busted my bubble. The title was 'Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble'. Luckily I found someone who had faith. He lifted my ego back up into place. His name was Dana Goodman and he thought my song was on track. So two weeks later it was out on wax. It busted up the charts like a hydrogene bomb. Up, up, up, up it clim-clim-climbed. I made people eat the words that said I couldn't achieve. Now they had no choice but to believe. In me, then no sooner than my record came out. That same old producer started callin my house. One night he called me 'bout at half past 12. He said, ""I've got some cash if you wanna sell"". I said, ""You big, stupid, half-wit idiot. I told you before that my record was a hit. But you just laughed like I was some kind of kid. Now don't you regret what you did?. I wish you'd get off my tip, yes, that's my request. You see, he who laughs last, always laughs best. Okay, I'll be reasonable - You wanna buy it?. Okay, I'll sell it - psych - don't even try it!"". [ Jazzy Jeff ]. Ha-ha. That's how you gotta put it to him. [ Fresh Prince ]. Word man, that's how you gotta... [ Jazzy Jeff ]. You know what?. Let me tell you something. I got dissed so hard, man. Bust this. I'ma tell YOU what's up. [ Jazzy Jeff (& Fresh Prince) ]. Yo Prince - do you remember when we first started out. How we used to go to all the parties just to rock the house?. (Word man, I remember those good days well). Why chill out, man, cause I got a story to tell. About five years ago I began my quest. To be the best deejay in the whole U.S.. There was a lot of deejays strivin for my spot. They would put me down every chance they got. Never cut me a break on any given night. They used to all look at me and say (Pfsss.. Jeff's aight). (But when your 'Magnficient Cuts' were released. All of that laughter ceased). Word. (When you and I used to do our shows. All the crowd would say was 'HO, HO, HO'). Yeah, time after time we were tearin it up. While you rocked the mic and I rocked the cut. But now that I'm makin a name for myself. All those deejays are like (Yo Jeff, what's up?). But all that stuff is dead, no, I ain't with it. They approach me on the street and say (Yo Jeff, how 'bout a ticket. Man, to your very next show?). But I say no and I tell em where they can go. I can't believe that they had the nerve. To hop on my tip now! (Yeah man, word). Just the other day homebody approached me on the street. And said (Yo Jeff, how 'bout a record for free?). I said, Man, the way you dissed me, you better go buy it!. (But Jeff - we're friends) For real? Don't even try it!. [ Jazzy Jeff ]. Hey man, I'm tellin you. Straight up. You know how it is, man. [ Fresh Prince ]. Man people. People are a trip, man. [ Jazzy Jeff ]. Maybe they'll know next time not to dis people. Knawmsayin?. [ Fresh Prince ]. We told em. We let em know. [ Jazzy Jeff ]. Cause I ain't with it, man. That stuff is dead. [ Fresh Prince ]. Dig it. Aight Jeff, chill, man. Aight."
don't say nothin',Yo (let's talk about). When I released my first single back in like '86. People was like oh you know that's popcorn and you know they weak. You know then I mess around I go world trade on them. Bangin out them multi-plats they still got negativity to bring. My thing is you can't say nothing nice don't say nothing. Take your place allow me to flex a taste. As my accomplishments bring up my comp like mase. Face me the star of stage and TV. My face be seen in almost every country. Grammy winner soon to be oscar nominee. Who he that's dressed jiggy straight from West Philly. Thought I was wack cause I wanted to act. Now every brother and his mother that rap be trying to do that. The ill kid. Hundred million dollar bill kid. The one you love to chill with come on keep it real kid. Don't try to act like this summer at the greek. You won't be bumpin the big Willie in your jeep. I know y'all still feel me. Really don't act silly. Thought I feel off just becuase I left Philly. Took a break from the rap thing went on hiatus. I picked up the art of acting and multiplied papers. I chilled on silk sofas chatting with Oprah. She asked me if it's true that me and Jeff broke up (hell naa). While y'all kids busy playing drug pimp and playa. I was at my crib in Barbados chillin with Jada to date her. Vertex is me the magnanimous. Got you saying damn I've always been a fan of his. Y'all know how it is oh wait hold up y'all don't. Look here y'all don't say nothing then I won't.

My whole life I've been smiling when I felt like whiling. Jealousy swinging on me made his attack. (He soft he wack man that ain't real rap). You believe that. It hurt me at first but it's cool.

(Brother from ID4). Now can I please get. (A picture and your signature). Sure you can miss. (Oh my god my girlfriends they ain't gonna believe this). Worldwide wait nah hold up galactic. Hear my name don't nothing change but the accent. Bangkok to Madagascar they wanna see me. Princepe in Spain Japan I'm kota ishe. I like my steaks thick and my jets private. And my son to ride in the cockpit. I know hes only four taking lessons from the pilot. While I'm on my cell with my broker getting stock tips. Find a magazine and I read the hottest gossip.

everything that glitters (ain't always gold),"Aw man!. Put that ol' dumb horn down. Hey, Jazzy. Jazzy. Show this boy what some real music 'posed to sound like. He-he-ha!. 1-2-3-4. Now that's a record!. Now that's a record!. Go Jazzy, go Jazzy, go. I want to be remembered for the songs that I sing. Not only for the humour, but for the knowledge I bring. To broaden the horizons of others is why I rap this. Enlightening minds with my lyrical tactics. In life everything ain't always what it seems. But people are enchanted by things that gleam. You know, bright fancy cars, big yachts and mansions. On the beaches of Aruba with a girlie romancin. Now I'm about to tell you a very interesting fable. More fun than when you first got cable. The moral to be learned from this story to be told. Is that everything that glitters ain't always gold. On July the 11th I was sittin at home. Talkin to my girlfriend Geena on the telephone. Flippin through the newspaper checkin the news. When I saw an advertisement for a Carribean cruise. It said sunny skies and romantic nights. On an incredible ship and I got hype. It said it's like the Love Boat baskin in the sun. Promisin fun for you and for everyone. I said that's dope baby you're down. She said yeah we could leave right now. The very next day I put the check in the mail. And one week later we were ready to sail. The brochure said that the boat was large. But it was nothin but a broken-down barnacle barge!. And if it wasn't for my girlfriend, I wouldn'ta went. Because the captain was a cross-eyed hunchback with a limp. The cruise was paid for and the food was free. So I said what the hell and set out to sea. It didn't take long to notice something was wrong. The ship was a mess and we were the only ones on it. I didn't wanna panic, so I chilled for a while. Till the captain pulled up on what we thought was a deserted isle. We looked on to the beach and almost went bezerk. We saw 300 natives with spears and grass skirts!. The said, ""Hung-a-dung-a-digi-dung-da-do"". I said, ""Hey baby, I guess that means get off the boat"". Their chief said they needed a human sacrifice. I said, ""Well, just take my girl - he-he - psyche"". I was jokin, but things got serious. Their leader came out and he was furious. He got in my face and his breath was the worst. I said, ""Hey baby, you got some mints in your purse?"". His breath was stinkin with dooky brown teeth. And two big crusty ashy hairy feet. The worst thing, he had no toenail on his toes. And a big Teradactyl bird bone in his nose. I tried to reason with him, he wasn't with it. He said, ""Tenga-shanko,"" that meant 'forget it'. He said, ""Gunga-shang-tang-da-bong-da-boo"". That meant 'tonight we're having Fresh Prince stew'. Then I saw it - no, it's not. The big Indiana Jones people cooking pot!. I wanted to fight em, but there was no way to beat em. I thought to myself, 'Where's Tarzan when you need him?'. Just as they were contemplatin cookin us up. We had a major stroke of luck, a Navy ship pulled up. The troops came off and they got us out of the pot. And I said to the chief, ""Yo, I get with ya, hops!"". The guy that rescued us said, ""I hate to tell you. The captain of your ship, he had just escaped from Belview. We've been following him and finally we got him. We're sorry, there's no way that you can possibly get a refund"". A thousand dollars and a weekend down the drain. But a lesson well learned, so let me explain. There's a very important message that needs to be told. It's that everything that glitters ain't always gold."

fresh prince of bel-air,"Now this is a story all about how. My life got flipped, turned upside down. And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there. I'll tell you how I became the prince. of a town called Bel-Air. In west Philadelphia born and raised. On the playground is where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out,maxin',relaxin',all cool. And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school. When a couple of guys who were up in no good. Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared. And said: You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air. I begged and pleaded with her day after day,. But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way. She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. I put wy Walkman on and said, ""I might as well kick it."". First class, yo, this is bad. Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. Is this what the people of Bel-Air live like?. Hmm...this might be alright. But wait, I here their Prissy, Booz wine-in all.. Is this the type of place that they should send this cool-cat?. I don't think so, I'll see when I get there,. I hope their prepared for the prince of Bel-Air!. Well-a plane landed and when I came out. there was a dude dressed like a cop stand'n there. with my name out, ""I ant' try to get arrested yet. I just got here!"" I flew like the quickness of light'en disapper.. I whistled for a cab and when it came near. The license plate said fresh and had a dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare. But I thought, ""Now, forget it. Yo home to Bel-Air!"". I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8. And I yelled to the cab yo home smell you later. Looked at my kingdom I was finally there. To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air."
from da south,"Right. here, right.. (Yep). When I was a young boy growing in Philly, I. Was sort of easy going, I. Was really a silly I. I used to mess around. I was kind of the class clown. I hate to see you frown. I hate to see people down. 'Cause I like it when fun flows like a faucet (uh). But sometimes, some guys mistake it for softness. But I ain't no silly sappy singin softy. When push comes to shove, ya better back up off me. 'Cause I am 6'2 and I ain't no little guy. 200 pounds and homie I can make the heads fly. My father told me never hit nobody first. But if they hit you son (Yeah), take them to a hearse. So throughout my life those are the rules that I've lived by. A sucker put his hands on me homie I'll give a guy. A jab, jab, jab, uppercut, jab. Get 'em a steaks slab. And put 'em in a cab (Uh). Now I ain't the type of brother to go out and pick a fight. But man, man I really, really, hate to hear stuff like. Michael Jackson said, ""this sorta thing silly man..."". A lover not a fighter, better stay out a Philly man.. Put up your dukes, so you better start boogen. A sick upper punch when you lunchin' and ain't lookin'. An mx uppercut, aim for the mouth. Not from the north, or the east, or the west, it's comin'. From da south. And I'm throwing it hard. From da south. Right up under your guard. From da south. An uppercut with all I got. (Watch them drop!). Put up you dukes; it's time to get loose troop. 101, with me and you, and me and you're whole crew. You heard about the uppercut is that's what's wrong. fellas. You're all chickens and for doers getting jealous. Fail one bang 'em. Rumble and all buggin'. All different names but all the same buggin'. Maybe you can take me out, yeah maybe not. 'Cause fly into the uppercut (Here they come) and hear ou're. body shout. Boom shakala laka Boom shaka laka Boom!. Look out. It's coming at you like a Kodak zoom. No, my name ain't Roberta, don't be giving me flak. And if you step off track, Jack,. You're taking a turn, nap. A muscle bound sucker, mean jack to Will. When I walk on by better be glad I chill. But if y'all forfeit and I feel friction. The landlord is givin' ya teeth dental piction. X's over eyes and birds around ya heads, flyin'. Limp all back. Look like I hit you with a bat. Eyes so black (diggy, diggy). Look like ya must a got em painted. Damn!. That uppercut's a mother ain't it. Step in the ring. With the king. And you take a chance. 'Cause 20 seconds later y'all be out in a ambulance. Lookin pathetic. As you wrestle paramedic. What's up?. Felt like a truck. But it was only an uppercut. Jus last week some fool got careless (Yeah). So I got triflin'. Went right for the bare fist. After the punch the young man didn't want a fight. I missed his face. But I busted the stoplight. So put up you're dukes, so you better start bookin'. A sick upperpunch. When you munchin'. And ain't lookin'. An mx uppercut aim for your mouth. Not from the north, or the east, or the west, it's comin'. From da south. And I'm throwin' it hard. From da south. Right up under you're guard. From da south. And uppercut with all I got.

girls ain't nothing but trouble,listen homeboys don't mean to bust your bubble. but girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble. so next time a girl gives you the play. just remember my rhyme and get the hell away. Just last week when I was walking down the street. I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet. I walked up to her I said hello. she said you're kind of cute I said yes I know. but by the way sweetheart what's your name. she said my friends like to call me exotic Elaine. I said my name is the Prince and she said why. I said well I don't know I'm just a hell of a guy. but enough about me yo let's talk about you. and all the wonderful things that you and I can do. I popped some cash and in a little bit of time. I showed some cash and the girl was mine. I took her over town I wined her and dined her. she ask me did I like her I said well kinda. all of a sudden she jumped out her seat. snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street. she started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging. so I shoved her away I said you better stop buggin. she got mad looked me dead in my face. threw her hands in the air and yelled out rape. I got scared when she started to yell. so I handed her my wallet and ran like hell. I was duckin through alleys right and left. but when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death. I was arrested charged with agrivated assault. (yo Clancy we got him). but it wasn't my fault. nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble. but girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble. so next time a girl gives you the play. just remember my rhyme and get the hell away. I was in a bar one Friday night. cooling watching a Mike Tyson fight. I was maxin and relaxin sippin on Tequilla. when this girl walked up she said hi my name is Sheila. I responded by saying hello. she paid for my drink and then said let's go. 20 minutes later things were starting to cook. as we pulled up into her house I said I'm with you toots. the music was soft and there was wine in the glasses. she started winking and making little passes. at me she pat me close that's when she got bold. she started feeling up my back I said oh your hands are cold. we went to her bedroom thinking of one thing. took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring. I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek. and that's when I observed those satin bed sheets. I felt that it was time for me to make my move. I thought I better hurry up before I busted a groove. I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue. a door slammed and a voice said baby where are you. her boyfriend busted in he grinned an evil grin. and said boy I'm a tear your butt limb from limb. I was scared as hell where I was supposed to go. I just yelled geronimo and jumped out the window. just my luck we were in a snow storm. and all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm. and to top the night off I had to break in my place. because my keys were on pants back on Sheila's book case. I was done sneezing and coughing. I hope this doesn't happen to often. but nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble. but girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble. so next time a girl gives you the play. just remember my rhymes and get the hell away. Jazzy: yo man you think they see your point. Prince: I don't know I don't think they really do. Jazzy: I think you should give 'em another example. Prince: awright give me a scratch let's make it funky right here. I got a ring on my phone May 5th last year. it was my girlfriend Betty I said hello dear. I was just about to call you I got a couple tickets to the Run DMC concert. (I'm wit it). It's six o'clock now at eight will you be ready. (yeah). aight fine see you then Betty. I combed my hair washed and brushed my teeth. got funky fresh dressed in my la coq sportif. got to Betty's at eight I was ready to jet. until Betty's mon said Betty's not ready yet. I sat there for at least an hour. it was ten after nine before she got in the shower. 9:35 she comes downstairs. and said I need a little longer to finish my hair. at ten o'clock we had then missed the show. she comes downstairs and says let's go. go where go to sleep I'm gone. I was steamin like a demon as I drove home. but it just goes to show. not trying to bust your bubble. but girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble. so next time a girl gives you the play. just remember my rhyme just remember my rhymes. take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away. Jazzy:. man first your parents just don't understand. then you having these crazy nightmares. Prince:. I know why me man why me. Jazzy: what's next.

You say girls are full of trouble I must play this to you. Girls may be trouble but guys are trouble too. You're a compulsive liar you mind is full of dirt. All you do is worry about what's up a girls skirt. You cant hurt these people because you got a big mouth. You go run and tell your boys how you made out. I think ruthfully your sick you need to be kicked. See I'm getting my loaded weapon you get on my nerve I go click. Guys think they own their girlfriends females aren't possession's we are humans. We like to be wined and dined by candle light. Not being couped up in the house trying to be held up tight. So jazzy jeff and fresh prince don't mean to bust your bubble. But guys of the world ain't nuthin but trouble. So homegirls next time a guy tries to give you the play. Just turn your head and cold diss him and walk away. This amazing hot day I went to see Barney from work. My briefcase in my hand sitting down on my skirt. The undergounds of the surface was the scene of my walk. I got approached from the rear e said baby can we talk. I looked him in the eyes with this fabulous smile. He said I just got paid lets hang out for a while. I said first would be my pleasure to know who you are. And do I have to use my tokens or do you have a car. Well my name is the prince and I'm a great rap star. You don't have to use your tokens I've got a jaguar. I knew there was no doubt I'd jump on this mission. I proceeded to tell him my name with police suspicion. I said ice cream tee was the title I was given. SWP the name of the hood I live in. So we jumped in the ride hit the 95 we turned into his block pulled up in his drive. First step in the house I saw a mouse. I said 90 in the wrong trips and then with the ow. He came running to my rescue he was a little late. My hair was broke my briefcase was in a totally different place. He said I'm sorry take a sip of this bacardi. And excuse me while I go freshen up for the party. I got a little confused I said party what's up with dude. He didn't even tell me I thought that was quite rude. Suddenly through the door was three men in suits. They said hey sweet mama who are you. I said im ice cream tee and who may you be. I'm brother charles brother rick and he's brother ali. Are you here to see the prince. Prince no prince works for me im running the show. Work for me and at 12 o clock midnight you'll be working 42nd street. O my god I was totally stunned he yanked me up slapped my cheek and put his ands on my buns. I said ha you better watch it sucker. I said to myself I got to go get my geurney. E put me in this locker called me a b e and h. Looked around noticed that there was no escape. Left the room went behind closed doors. I pulled down got my briefcase that was on the floor. Flipped the latch lift the lid Pulled out my smith n wesson. Yes my shiny black loaded a 357. Stepped out of the room dressed in shoot of the load. And said they all lay me down and hit me with this tune. When they see my smith n wesson their eyes got bigger. I relaxed latch off chilled back and pulled the trigger. Picked up the briefcase broke out on the double. These guys of the world are full of trouble. Cant live with em cant live without em.
"he's the dj, i'm the rapper","Uh uh, ah uh. Yo Jeffrey Buss it. What are ya doin in there?. Word em up word em up word em up. In the place at about this time. DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince just bu bu buggin out. Losing it all no sense. Ay Jeff scratch it scratch it man, scratch it. Uh aw that was decent. Now scratch it a quick joint, a quick one Jeff. Oh yeah yeah. We just bugging we just having some fun. Me and Jeffrey. He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper. Hello can anybody hear me. You can aight that's good you can hear me. Okay it's clear it's good okay everybody's got it. One two. One two and. My rhymes have been written not to be bitten. But as it seems, some suckers keep forgetting the rules about rappin, but that's alright. Cause in the next five minutes I'm a have them all uptight. Stronger than a dinosaur, better known than Santa. Man the battles I battle, I usually win em. In less than a minute, but it all depends. On how long it takes you rappers to realise. That trying to defend yourself is ridiculous. Didn't you get my message its out of the question. Cause you're toys boys, I'm the Real McCoy. I'm really gonna enjoy seeing you destroyed. If I was Fred Flintstone I'd probably own all of Bedrock. If I was a criminal I'd probably own a cellblock. If I was in the Navy I would own the sea. But I'm a poet so I own the whole rap industry. I'm like a lion my man, and the streets are my den. It's either kill or be killed, so I kill. I kill again and again and again. Surmount the times, rappers I'll slaughter them. I tie em up and throw them in the water. Then I'll just walk away like nothing ever happened until somebody else starts rappin. That's when I snap and I'll attack and go mad like Rambo or maybe like Commando, or like Lando. Calrissian, cause you know he was down with the Force. Fresh Prince is the source I feel no pain or remorse. Think that you can beat me rappin man you must be silly. Man I really really really really really really. Hate when people, doubt my ability. And I have to prove superiority. If rap was basketball, I would be in luck. Cause every time I freestyle it would be a slam dunk. Man I'm the engineer, and you're the passengers. Taking on a voyage, a hip-hop massacre. The Jason of rap, Freddy Kruger of rhymin. And I'm sure that you'll see in due time man. People will run, to Philadelphia Pennsylvania to all join in, to this Fresh Prince mania. My face in magazines, on your radio or stereo. Everywhere you go, audio and video. A hip-hop terrorist, war like vocalist. Other rappers say, yo Prince why don't you show me this. Style now you must be trippin it ain't no way in hell I'ma let you put your lip in. My rhyme cause it's a timebomb, I'm not kiddin. My rhyme explodes the second it gets bitten. I'm quick and nimble, a status symbol. I shop at Macy's now but I used to shop at Gimble's. I'll, drop kick a hurricane, bodyslam a tidal wave. Walk through a tornado, or a volcano. But I'll be okay though. And here's some more info that you rappers should know. You are the bombs and I will defuse you. I am the lawyer and I'm going to accuse you of the ultimate rhyme crime and you will be guilty. There's no way that you'll ever ever defeat beat me rappin any time or day. Pop so much trash, man I can't wait to be face to face, and hear Jeff say sick em. Man you're gonna be my victim. You better duck, and pray for good luck Chuck, cause you're stuck. You're like a Thanksgiving turkey and it's time to be plucked. I see you're nervous purpose that's how I now you're soft. You're runnin round like a chicken with your head cut off. But just relax my power to the max. And I'm cuttin no slack on this rap track, Jack. So back up, as if you got good sense. Or feel the fury of the Prince. And ya don't stop. Yo Jazzy why don't you rock up the spots. Yo Jazzy hey Jeff I'm psyched I'm psyched. Give em a cut Jeff. Ooh-wee check out my dish-jockey!. Ay Jeffrey Jeffrey Jeffrey, a fast one. Uh ha yeah. Wow, ay Jeff Jeff, give em one of them fresh ones. A fresh one Jeffrey. No music, no music. Woo, that was decent, that was decent. That's my DJ, that's my DJ. Jazzy Jeff, I'm the Fresh Prince. Hi how ya doin?. How's everyone doin out there?. Ooh!. I'm just here to talk about my DJ. I was just I was just standin in here, really. Really? Aight, okay, um. On behalf of DJ Jazzy Jeff, and the Fresh Prince ... (Don't touch that dial). Thank you, and good night."
here he comes,"[CHORUS]. Here he comes, he can rock. He can break dance and he can pop. He can rap, he can act. & if it comes down to it, he can scrap. Hey there... here comes Big Will again. Here I come ya'll, here I come ya'll. Watch yo' back ya'll, here I come ya'll. For years I been tryin to rip rhymes & get mine. Spit lines, hot like lava this time. I don't got a sitcom to bother with. Or a time conflict with my sci-fi hits. I'm contemplating each statement's wit. & I'm concentrating on making hits. & I'm fittin' em line by line. Teeth I grit & I'm tryin to find the perfect rhyme scheme. I'm dreamin' about ya'll gleamin, doubt. ""He's back from actin, he's screaming out. how he practiced rap & now he's devout. every album track packs what he's about. In the past he passed with passion, old fashioned"". Boldly mashing, totally crashing. Words up in a disorderly fashion. But back to the lab & guess what happened, KABOOM!. (ooh wee!) ""Dude's resilient!"" Fresh Prince was hot,. the movies killed him, wait, hold up, stop! You can rebuild him. lock him back in hip hop while Dude's not filming. shock by the film & the TV money, went from scenes with Uncle Phil. to scenes with Sonny, so hard to break free from a guaranteed 20. but its done, so come see the MC, honey!. [CHORUS]. [Bridge:]. Everytime he touch the mic, he closes his eyes and he hope to shine. Then like a streak of light, they'd show his name, they'd be like, Aaahhh!. ... hey there, here comes Big Will again. .....here comes Big Will again. .....here comes Big Will again!!!. .

here we go again,"Loyal fans and newfound followers. Whats up y'all Hello how are you doin out there. You're chillin, I'm winnin. Oh, by the way, the album's out, go get it. We went to the studio and then we made a video. We didn't make a movie though, maybe the next year or so. Yo, I got a message for my fans and friends. The last album was def y'all, and here we go again!. No applause, no applause, thank you, thank you. We're back again, and we're plannin on rockin you. ten times harder than any other crew can. Jeff is like Conan, I'm like Tarzan. In other words, wherever we go. Haha We're runnin the show, but no seriously. It's been a while since we dropped one. But it's out now, go buy the album. If you bought the last one you know it was krush. But if you didn't man, you must not. know what you're missin friend. The last album was dope y'all, and here we go again. A lot of people may not have bought the last album. But yo Jeff, straight up, we can't allow them to go out like that, our music is too def. We produce hit records right and left. Daytime, night time, def beat, def rhyme. Chorus line, bass drum, snare drum, bassline. All of this makes our records rock til the party's end. Here we go again!. When we first came out, we had a smash hit song. Then people started askin what's takin so long for y'all to put another record out for the airwaves. I said hold up let me explain when you hear a record on your radio station. It's probably getting played all throughout the nation. But we got lucky, ours was played in Germany. France, Japan, Sweden London Italy. So therefore, we had to go on tour. City after city encore encore bravo bravo. Sorry we gotta go. We got another show tomorrow night in Rio. The point I'm tryin to make is to let you all know. It takes a long time to travel the globe. But now we gotta start this whole process all over again. The last album was def and here we go again. Special thanks to everyone that helped us. Without you we would not have been able to sell as many records we went top ten. And god willin we'll do it again. It was a long hard road believe me. People tryin to steal from me and deceive me. But that's cool, you live and learn my friends. We did it before and we'll do it again."

human video game,"Ever since I was younger, I was into video games. Tron or whatever, it didn't matter the name. Thousands of my dollars, have been poured into all types of games, tryin to get the high score. But now I think I have a favourite. It's me against an ape, he's got my girl, I've got to save her!. Oh no, I feel an attach coming on. Yo Ready Rock C I wanna play a game of Donkey Kong. It used to be a problem this addiction I have. I would feel the urge, then I'd go stark raving mad. Break into the arcade, screaming and hollering. Anticipating putting twenty-five dollars in any machine, I was out of control. I didn't need quarters I brought, $10 bank rolls. Bags of quarters, I was insane. People thought that I worked there, and asked me for change. But I would get defensive and yell leave me alone. These are my quarters stupid, go get your own. Dude walked away with this look in his eyes like,. Yo man.. I wonder what's wrong with that guy. I was addicted, a video burn-out and I would crazy when the guy would have to turn out. The lights at midnight, I'd fall on my knees and say,. Have a heart pal, one more game please. Some nights I might sleep on the subway or outside of the arcade til it opened up the next day. And when it opened at a quarter to ten it was the same old thing all over again. I was doin bad my future was bleek. I'd rather play games than eat or sleep until one day, this guy came along. He didn't have a radio but he was playin a song. I got curious, so I said, yo what's that noise?"" (What noise? I don't know). No fool, that noise you was makin there (What this). Yeah. That was def man, where'd you learn to do that. (Man, I don't know, I guess I always knew that I had this talent deep down inside). You wanna hear some more man Yeah (Come on let's take a ride). He made sounds like I never heard before and he still had more. Then he got me hyped when he played this incredible song and I lost my mind when Ready C played Donkey Kong. Yo Ready, get funky with it!. Yo Jeff man what you doing? Give Ready a hand. Now my life is wonderful and I feel great. I haven't been in an arcade since seventy eight. Thanks to Ready C I'm on an upward trail. Because he's always by my side, he never fails me. Whenever I have a video attack. He's right there by my back keeping me on track. So if I bug out and act like a lunatic. He does Donkey Kong and as soon as it gets to my eardrums from his vocal chords. I get hyped up no matter how bored I am he always comes through. Oh my fault, hold up, wait, let me tell you who. Ready Rock C, here's a brief description. Of the things that he can do in his musical position. Ready Rock C makes sounds with his mouth. Yo Ready give an example of what I'm talking about. (game over). (Yo, Scrammy, why you still standin there). (The game is over haha sucker)."

i loved you,I Loved You. I thought you was the one hon yeah. when I met you at the freaknin'. whoever thought you'd be the type to greet and keep secrets. my friends said don't sleep but I did so now I'm reapin'. desease that I sold I can't beleive you so deceivin'. sneakin' out on the weekends with Michelle. one of your freak friends from the east end she bad as hell. half black and Indonesian the one that tought you treason. cupid shoot me on my heart but damn why'd you leave it bleedin'. I gave you no reason to lie. but you choose to live untrue. knowing how I feel inside. there's no telling what I might do. cause I gave you. Chorus. all my mind. all my soul. from the very start. I gave you full control and you broke my heart. I tried to show you a better way of life. but I see that must be what you like. I loved you more than anything. I tried to build the future turn a house into a home. I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone. it's so hard to keep my sanity. now I can do is sit back and reminisce. look at the pictures in the frames yo. why you playin' games yo. as I think back to the begining we was together. we both loved sports long walks and autumn weather. both wanted kids and a family a strong personality. I liked the way you handled me. candles be lit mood set food set you ready yet. that's what you said while you was massagin' my head. now look here I could never leave you lonely. cause the love you showed me had me feeling like you already had known me. 'member when you used to blindfold me till I don't see. use your mind that's what you told me. kissin' me slowly. never was the loud type always on the low key. pretty style but rugged. damn I brother I loved the. the birds of a feather 'sposed to fly together. guess that don't apply to birds of your kind. cuase you only wanted what you wanted like a poacher. came to steal my heart and leave me to die. (I ain't going out like that though). Chorus.
i think i can beat mike tyson,"hey...hey Leroy...Leroy yeah did you hear about that boy Mike Tyson?. Mike...Mike Tyson he's the boy that played football from Montreal ain't he?. no no you old coop, he a...he a boxer man yeah let me tell ya I went to his fight a couple months ago.. I seen him hit this boy, and he hit the boy so hard his head flew off into the eigtheenth row (laughing) they had to get his head out of the eighteenth row. [Prince & Jeff] I was in Jeff's crib one night about eight and we were watchin'a couple of Mike Tyson fight tapes Jeff was like... man, you see how hard Mike's punchin'?. come on Jeff the other guy was just lungin'. left, right, left, right, another K.O. if that was me I'd a been ok though. the very next day I gave Russell a ring with J.L. and Omar we all called Don King. I said 'yeah, Don I got a problem. tell 'em Prince 'yeah what's up? what you sayin? you tryin' to solve 'em?'. 'forget the small talk let's get to the nitty gritty' 'me and Mike, two months, Trump, Atlantic City'. yo, you got this you gonna bust dude up. yeah, you can be my trainer word up?. I'm rough like a freight train smooth like ice and yo Jeff, straight up, I think I can Mike Tyson. man, you can beat him, you can beat him yo man, word up yo I put on a couple of pounds man we can do this you can do it. Newspaper boy: extra, extra read all about it Fresh Prince challenges Iron Mike Tyson to a fight (laughing) ah he's crazy. ain't that the boy who knocked the guy's head in the fifthteen row?. hey Leroy, you read the paper? that boy done lost his mind. [Prince, Barber] there was press conference to see what training I was doing. before then I had never heard reporters booing. cameras flashing I was in the middle. I didn't wanna look dumb so I exagerrated a little. I said uh I been training 2o hours a day lifting big old cars and big bails of hay (that's what he's doin'). and I run 10,000 miles every morning thinkin' about Mike and my moment of glory (tell 'em more). I drink water 20 gallons a pop and I can throw a Volkswagon a whole half block (he can do it too). and 4 million sit ups...in a minute.... ..I ain't lying I did it (he done it). the general public thought I was a fool. I was gettin' dissed but I guess that was cool. well gettin' dissed is never good. but I was even gettin' dissed in my old nieghborhood. I was at the corner at the top of my block there was a couple of people standing outside of the barber shop. it was Larwence, my barber, and Franny he yelled out hey, Prince, you can win!. I said 'really?' and I stopped to chat. you could beat him man, if you hit him wit a bat ha ha...you gon' get whipped but can I have your shoes when he break your neck?. everybody was laughin' out loud I thought at least my own Grandma would be proud. I went to her house and snuck in to surpise her I heard her on the phone (a thousand bucks on Tyson). [Prince, Ring Announcer] it's fight day and man am I hyped boy I can't wait to see Mike. boy I'm hyped ready to be my thing Trump Castle Casino. in this corner...weighing in at a mere 165 pounds, the Lighting Rodent, the Fresh Prince! (booing). and in this corner... the heavyweight champion of the world... Iron Mike Tyson (cheering). I came out hustling sliding and grabbing slippin' and dippin' hustlin' and jabbin'. for a second I looked good out there but then Mike brought to reality my worst nightmare. one punch, that's all it took (oooh) he hit me in my ribs and my insides shook. now how can I say this and be a little discreet let's just say that my bowels released. I called timeout and went back to my corner. said to my coach 'ain't no way I'm goin' the hell back out there, man you can't forget it'. my body's like a punchin' bag and Mike is gonna (hit it). they tried to make me go meet my doom but I sucker punched my coach and hauled to my dressing room. the next day the headline in the town 'Fresh Prince breaks camp, Tyson wins first round'. some fool asked why I ran away I said 'a good run is better than a bad stand anyday'. my career is over as far as fightin' but I don't know what made me think I can beat Mike Tyson. 2 old men: hey Leroy! yeah did you see the fight?. did you see the fight?. the..the..the football player?. no the boxer, come on man I was at the fight last night I paid four hundred and seventy fo' thousand dollars for my ticket right... ah, you weren't at no fight I seen you around here last night ..and the boy..the boy ran out the ring you always lying I ain't lying... you lie to your grandkids.. ..I seen it... ...you been lying ever since you was a little kid ...Mike Tyson punched the boy in his ribs, and his leg fell off his leg fell off and it fell over... ...you always lying ...and it knocked the HBO camerman's camera fell out his hand I said, god damn, I couldn't beleive it Leroy you shoulda been there...you definetly shoulda been there ...I was right next to you playin' checkers."

i wish i made that / swagga,"Yo, ain't no better man for this hype track. Just the veteran taking the mic back. David Letterman even said he like that track man. Even though he ain't a rap fan. Black radio, they won't play though. Ever since ""Summertime"" they ain't liked none of mine. Even though the fans went out & bought enough. I guess they think Will ain't hard enough. Maybe I should just have a shoot out. Run up in the bank, bustin', grabbin' all the loot out. Whoop somebody ass, taking my boot out. Right on TV so ya'll can see me. Just ignorant, attacking, actin' rough. I mean, then will I be black enough. Oh wait maybe I'll jack a truck. Full of cigarettes, guns & drugs & stuff. [REFRÃO - (2x)]. Get that. I wish I would of made that. Lean back. I wish I would of made that. I wish I woulda told the girls to 'drop it like it hot'. Summer, Summer, Summertime. Seem like all I got. I always envied how ya'll rock wit Dre & the Chronic. The way that Tupac, Biggie, 50 and Jigga got it. A lot like L.L., Chuck D, Slick & Dougie. I think ya'll love me, but ya'll place other rappers above me. & I don't know if you feel my flow. & be at my show & you'll see where I should go. On the charts of rhyme arts & thoughts in rap form. Damnit, I expanded the platform. Damnit, this Cat's on a rap song. Yeah, it ain't no braids or plats on. Ain't on stage wit no gats on. You know I'm afraid, getting' my act on. It might have stunted my growth. But I wanted them both. & I hope that it would be less tougher. You do two things & then they both gonna suffer. I chose to act & it broke my heart not to rap. Prodigal son, clever, better than ever, back. REFRÃO. [INTRO - REFRÃO]. I got my swagga back. I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back. I got, I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back.

I mean madness, sickness, sadness, swaggerless back in the day. Fat, ugly chicks in New York on the radio, saying I'm gay. I had a bonafide downside frown with the swagga not around in my life. Bank account found minimal amounts when countin' cause of my now ex-wife. I had the boar-thick wall & all that, endure pitfalls & all that, fallin'. callin' for help.

Who cares?. Coz your got the ace in the hole. The simple lover brother. Numero uno. The rapper with soul. cominâ€™ out a little on the new tip. for those of you that thought I couldnâ€™t do this. yo well consider it done. itâ€™s the same got the parents. just donâ€™t understand the same one. people said that I couldnâ€™t rap. ha ha ha well you can stop that. coz Iâ€™m a rapper and a half. and in the past I chose to make people laugh. and I was criticized for that. some called me soft, some called me wack. I gotta admit yâ€™all I felt bad. (Whoâ€™d ya call). so as usual I called my Dad. Heâ€™s sort of a fifty-one year old Casanova. He said son, ""Yo, come on over."". He sat me down and he told me this. Son when your all that, youâ€™re gonna get dissed. He put his arms around me and he said son. I was all that when I was young. So pump that point on. And set my sights on. Making a record that people thought was the: ??height jon, height joint, high joint???. Philly, born and raised. Iâ€™ve been. Gone for days. I canâ€™t wait to get back. With my new track. Rhyme like lava. Voice like a volcano. I rhyme through your radio. Words like draedo. A Porsche not eleven and I donâ€™t stall Jack. (Yo). We all that."

if u can't dance (slide) (feat. nicole scherzinger),"[Intro:]. Yo! If you can't dance, its cool to get up now. Usually, ya'll gotta sit on the side, but tonight, it's cool ...slide.... [Chorus]. If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby, left to right all night. Slide that's all you gotta do... You can't dance then this is your jam, baby. Left to right all night, slide, that's all you gotta do. Now we all know the boy at the club, all liquored up,. Boy with the bub tryin' to pick 'em up, wack dancing,. 'Wooking pa nub', shirt too bright, pants too tight. Boy settle down. Now I ain't just messing with you. I got better things to do. I'm trying to help, I got a lesson for you. I know you do the best you could do. Wanna get next to Boo, then the less you do the better. Cause women equate dance with sex. They gon' see you & be like, 'Next'!. But you gon' be like, 'hold up Ma' ('Next!'). But she gon' be like, uh huh, ('Next!'). Now looka-here, rule #1, know ya name,. if it ain't Usher, Justin or Hammer, then we can touch ya. Rule #2, never do a dance you can't do, why stupid,. Cause you can't do it. [Chorus]. So I'm up in my spot in Miami the other night, right. & this Dude's out on the floor Od-ing, just way 'over-dancing'. So his Mommy wanna holla at me. She thought my name was Billy, I told her it was Willie. She said she watch my Tv show & I was very silly. Told her I was from Philly she looked at me said, 'Really?'. & judging from her t-shirt, I could tell that she was chilly. So I gave her my sweater, she said her name was Etta. She said she come from Cuba and she just had bought a Jetta. She said she was glad I met her, let's go somewhere together. She said she'd ride in my car cause she knew that it was better. The conversation cookin', attention getting' tookin'. My Spidey senses tinglin', I felt somebody lookin'. Now who this brotha lookin', & now he runnin', bookin'. I'm mad I'm like a fisherman, I almost had my hook in. I figured I should get up & quickly clear my head up,. Cause Etta got a man & I'm feelin' kinda set-up. Now Dude was really fed up & yo, he wouldn't let up. Homey if I hit you, you might never ever get up. Now he was not a dancer, plus he wasn't handsome. Comin' like Mel Gibson, like I had his girl for ransom. Yo, Pedro wanna go out side, yo amigo, tranquillo... slide. [Chorus]. Now rule #3 is easy, please remember that you ain't on ""Beat Street"". Sweet feet, you ain't tryin' to win no Tv, another dude did a move. No need to out do it. Rule #4, out on the floor, don't be doing moves that don't nobody do no more. Draw too much attention to be adventurous out on the floor. There's a reason that don't nobody do 'em no more, you feel me?. This may be hilarious, but Rule #5 is serious, it's a shame that we have. to discuss. That there's no lip biting or pelvic thrusts. I mean you think that move will put the sting on her,. you too close, tryin' to put a ring on her?. You don't know that girl, don't cling on her & don't put your thing on. her...cool?!. [Chorus]"
interlude,"So dad, like did you like have real good friends and potnas when you was growing up. Will's dad: I had two real good friends all the way through high school. Who you had?. Thomas Jones and Jacob Curtis Jones. Were they like brothers?. Well they weren't brothers they just had the same last name as Jones. And everybody thought that I was a Jones too but I wasn't, of course I was a Smith. Right. But they thought I was a Jones, they called us the Jones boys we were so tight. Matter of fact I had a call from one of them. Hey Dad listen, check this record out. It was a dark night. I had just sparked the mic. Brought the light. To the crowd. In Hampton. It was amped when. I finished with. Brand New Funk. They were screaming out, ""Do Summertime"". Some of them was drunk, some of the time. I like to chill after the show. But tonight, yo I wanna get ill after the show. And there she is. 5 sumthin, short hair, damn she live. The girls get thicker further down 95. I expressed to her. Sought of confessed to her. I wanted to get next to her. So I suggested to her. We roll. To suite 110. Sweet ones in. My room. Jeff in one eleven with a friend. Then boom boom boom who that? (open the door). Why they do that?. Threw back. By the noise. Some dude and his boys. You know them?. Your boyfriend?. More like an annoyed friend. Peep through the peep hole peeped him and all his people. That's when Charlie creep through. Boy you wanna see who. Don't nobody wanna meet you. Damn here come the beef stew. My beef ain't with you (uh ah). My beef's with Will. So see Mack. Ease back. 'fore your cat get peeled. Charlie said, ""Any beef with Will is. Plenty beef with me and. Whenever Charlie get mad. He step to the streets he see. The end of the story. You wonder who survived?.

jazzy's groove,"(This is how it goes). Give me your attention, stop what you're doin and listen up. Because my partner in rhyme is about to tear it up. Jeff, is if someone said that your beats don't excite. And that your cuts were wack, what would you say (Yeah, right!). Jeff's about to give an incredible display. And unequivocally prove that he's the best DJ. His name is Jazzy Jeff and he's preparin to shake and make you move. To this long and strong theme song, Jazzy's Groove. And it'll (make em clap to this). (Make em clap to this). Hey yo, Jeff. (Come on, yeah). And it'll (make em clap to this). And it'll (make em clap to this). (Come on, yeah). You know, a lot of deejays, they're just short pieces of statues. My deejay's swift and exciting and coming at you. To other deejays Jeff is just too much. He doesn't use the line switch as a transform crutch. Never missin beats, always on time with the rhyme. You know the scratches are fine when intertwined with a bass line. Live in concert, Jeff is never Memorex. You don't believe he's def check the flex. [ Jeff cuts up ]. (Don't stop to the rhythm, cause I..). I could talk forever, but still never explain. Why deejays flee when they hear Jeff's name. Jeff is number one, even though he just begun. Rulin hip-hop as if he was Attila the Hun. We make records, it all adds up a kaleidoscope. We work hard, so people can't deny that it's dope. Some music makes you shake, some makes you move. (Now here's what I want y'all to do...). This beat is dope and it's called Jazzy's Groove. (Come on, yeah). (Come on, yeah). (Now here's what I want y'all to do). (Breakdown). Music has a tendency, a way of makin you feel it. It's been a secret and Jeff is about to reveal it. He'll get you hype, no DJ as def as Jeff is. He makes you smile and bow while he's flexin. He's a magician of sorts, it's kind of a sport. Jeff houses the wheels like Michael Jordan the courts. Ask who's the best and people all say that Jeffrey is. Here's a math lesson, so you can all see how def he is. (1) plus (1) is (2). (Once again back its the incredible). And (2) plus (1) is (3). (The music just turns me on). And (2) plus (2) is (4). (Play it on the radio). And (1) plus (2) is (3. (Hit it!). (Breakdown). Look, it's simple, just admit it. Jeff is the deffest, you wanted a battle, forget it. You're a fool, you're slippin, you're looney, you're crazy. No ifs, no ands it be just your butt, baby. The music is dope, don't fight it, just give in. Hey yo Jeff, man, tell em why you did it. (I made the beat hype, but still kinda smooth). And it's dope, right (For sure). Jazzy's Groove."
jeff was on the beat box,"*hip-hop*. *chance to rock*. *Jeff waz on the beat box*. There was a party the other day. Around my way. They asked if me and Jeff would play. We said okay. We nipped out to get the hip hop apparatus. Came back with the posse in full effect status. While Jeff set up, I said ""check one two y'all"". Everybody clap lets begin to ball. I was rapping a capella but I had to stop. Because chaos broke because Jeff waz on the beat box. Just cut it up Jeff. *hip-hop*. *chance to rock*. *Jeff waz on the beat box*. Did you know that parties were all the same when we came up. We had to rearrange and make a change. I remember how it was people standing still. The music was wack so they chose to get ill. People started breaking and fights would start to break out. This is the reason why some people make out. Hip-hop to be bad. Because of this behaviour. Then like a miracle two musical saviours. One with a microphone. The other with tables. Both up ready both willing and able. Burst on the scene like TNT. People said, ""who can it be?"". Cant you see it's Jeff and me. We all blazed as musical scholars. Fast admiration ??? dollars. Couple of kids with a bright idea. Didn't want a 9 to 5 made rap careers. People tried to diss and make the egos shrink. But we believe in ourselves so to hell what they think. Moving like a freight train we can't be stopped. Especially when I'm on the microphone and Jeff is on the beat box. *hip-hop*. *chance to rock*. *Jeff waz on the beat box*. Yo cut it up Jeff. Scratched ""hip-hop"". I know I talk about Jeff a whole hell of a lot. But straight up man you gotta give him his props. There's not many people who can do what he does. Marly Marl, Teddy Riley and herbie the luvebug. But other than that there's not many around. That can take that box and make it sound. Like anything that you could possibly want. Now heres a rhyme that sums it up. Jeff is diggy diggy d dope and. You DJ's out there keep hopin. His beat boxers will be broken. But you might as well just keep hopin. ????. You think he can your mis-taken. Our records he is brizzeakin (breakin0. (Come on man you can mix). Grammy winning musicians. His beat box is a kizz- kickin. And all my rhymes are hizz-hittin. The albums out so go get it. There ain't no way we st-stopping. We got the party rizzockin (rockin). We got the crowd a hip hoppin. When Jeff is on the beat box. *chance to rock*. *Jeff waz on the beat box*. One more time scratch Jeff. *hip-hop*. Mmm lets see what's next on the agenda. That's right oh yeah I've got it I remember. I was discussin when Jeff's on stage. Yeah hands clap. Ya feet tap. Ya eardrums pulsate. Ya body will move. As ya flow with the groove. And you smile as he composes this new rap tune. When he's on the stage he can't be stopped. Specially when I'm on the microphone and Jeff is on the beat box."
just cruisin',"Intro. The maestro. Nice flow. Hot like nitro. Cool as ice though. That type of docodimy. Y'all know it's gotta be. Who else could it be but me. Rub your eyes but hold the big Billy. It's dream supreme bean straight from Philly. It's the eclectic female attractor rapper slash actor. Right back at ya. And to the next millinium many come but few are chosen. See me servin' like the U.S. Open. Another type of hustler listed at Blockbuster. Go and ask a movie usher. Who is he, he or she. SFP, movies CD's, and TV's, but uh uh.

Got me hot now heated up can't stop now. What up cutie what sure sure is cooking now. Yo I know. I'm spoken for can't hurt lookin' no. Pop CD's, B-I-G's, and Tupac's. While cruisin' on the blocks. Hittin' the hot spots. Got my celly on O-F-F. Golden arches got my belly goin' oh yes yes. So let's just ease on down ease on down the road. No pager roll my hip. As I rollin' my whip. 'Cause today I'm on the solo creek. Man, why you think I be workin' all week. I'm (1, 1). Sun settin' in the S-K-Y. Must say I've had the best day I. Tryin' to find an exit. A place to chill not to hectic. So I can spend some time with Will. Let the sun shine to the moonlight clearin' my mind. Soul search, see what I find. If I'm being the best lover and friend. Am I being the best daddy I can. I pray I am. And I feel good today. Reminiece as I'm cruisin' around the way. Roll tight passed the park where I used to play. Can't think of a better way to spend my day. Uh, still findin' my way. Still growin'. Petrol lowin'. Moon soon showin'. Gots to get goin' losing the light. And the freaks come out at night. (1, 1)."
just kickin' it,"The F-L-Y guy. About to toss some action. Here I go again with a groove to move you. Somethinâ€™ kinda smooth, you can bop your head to. Chill it, the feel, you can play it anytime. Its smooth, is the groove, play it back behind the rhyme. So please, put a freeze, on hooving and hollering. Fans deserve more, for their hip-hop dollar, man. And Iâ€™m just the rapper to deliver. The rapper that can give a. Funky rhyme, flowing like a river. Silky, silky, kind to the ear. Diction perfect, rhymes all clear. Tempo moderate, this ainâ€™t no marathon. Step back, new jackâ€™s, observe the paragon. Ha, who? what?, why?, when?. Donâ€™t be looking around clown, thatâ€™s right, Iâ€™m back again. With the dopeness, youâ€™re head is bopping isnâ€™t it?. Yeah I thought so. Yo, Iâ€™m just kickinâ€™ it.. . Yeah---. Just kickinâ€™ itâ€™ â€“Yeah, Yeah. Iâ€™m just kickinâ€™ it. . I really cannot kick it. Just kickin it. Jus watch me yâ€™all; Iâ€™m jus kickin it â€“ kickin it. Uh Just kickin it. Yeah, yo Iâ€™m just kickinâ€™ it. . Just kick, and just kick it. Just kickin it -Ooh. Prepare for a voyage, just close your eyes. Who ainâ€™t ready, holler out I. Well ainâ€™t nobody hollering, â€˜cause all is perfect. The groove is a wave, and my rhymeâ€™s a surfing. The track design. With a rhyme in mind. Bidi budup up up, the charges will climb. Every young rapper trying to get you to jump. But when youâ€™re all done jumpinâ€™, Iâ€™m a git you what you really want. Track by track displaying my ability. The man, FP, showing true dexterity. On the Mic, no rules are lawless. Wicked, and a kicker and my rhymes are flawless. So sit back, relax and allow me to rock ya. With a hit that youâ€™re gonna get mentally locked to. A hip-hop solid and all flow, flower. I post up, together, better than Noah. A cut, to kick it too, kind to the ear drum. All true poetry, for me yâ€™all be hearinâ€™ some. So extra, extra, read all about it. I slam a the hell out of those that doubt it. Iâ€™m rippinâ€™ every city I been in. Coast to coast, not to boast, but Iâ€™m winning. My fans are powerful, and thatâ€™s the way Iâ€™m living.

Now, Iâ€™m just kickin itâ€™. . Just kickinâ€™ it â€“ Just kickinâ€™ it. Letâ€™s take a trip, mellow out while Iâ€™m rappinâ€™. Ya mind is the boat, and my rhymeâ€™s the captain. So hoist a sail, and its time to flow. To a place that other rappers donâ€™t go. Welcome, welcome, into my territory. Everbody get on up, and get busy for me. Heads are boppin hard and fast. And now Iâ€™m gettingâ€™ sued â€˜cause my groove caused whiplash. Everytime a rhymer tried to. Say something smooth, thatâ€™ll move inside you. The way that you should feel when you hear a real rap. Is trapped in the rhyme and your climbing to the climax. A lyrical painter, the fresh prince. And yâ€™all a know of my Picasso essence. Musical passion, lovely isnâ€™t?. But ainâ€™t nothinâ€™ to it. Yo, Iâ€™m just kickin it. . Just kickinâ€™ it- Just kickinâ€™. Check me, check me, just kickin it. . Just kickinâ€™ it- Just kickin it. Like Pronto yâ€™all, Iâ€™m just kickinâ€™ it. .

just one of those days,have you ever in your life experienced a day. where nothing at all seems to go your way. no matter how hard you try to get out of the rut. you just could not break the string of bad luck. a day where Murphy's law takes over your life. and you just can't seem to do a darn thing right. and when the day was over you just had to say. you said man it's just one of those days. my day started off kind of cool. I brushed my teeth I comed my hair and I got dressed and went to school. I stopped at the store for a breakfast snack. a tasty cake and orange juice and a bubble yum pack. about that point I proceeded to class. I spoke to all the pretty girls that I passed. I went to my room which was on the first floor. I had no idea what I was in for. I sat in my desk and minded my own business. someone knocked on the door the teacher said who is it. this girl walked in my imigination ran wild. she stole my heart just by the way that she smiled. I couldn't resist so I grabbed her butt. she said what's wrong with you fool are you some kind of nut. the teacher turned around while my arm was extended. she looked me in the face and said Prince you're suspended. I said your tripping it's just a bad habit. she put it in my face she must've wanted me to grab it. I pleaded my case but she wrote the pink slip. then I just shoke my head I said I don't beleive this. she sent me to the head of the discipline staff. I tried to play it off so I started to laugh. I said ha ha this story is great. it's a big misunderstanding one big mistake. he didn't think that it was funny he didn't even smile. he said mmm mmm mmm you're an unlucky child. I stopped laughing and I said why is that. he said just get out my school and don't you ever come back. I said wait this is my school and you're telling me to leave it. he handed me my books and said yep you'd best beleive it. as I walked out the school back at the wall I did gaze. and said man it's just one of those days. I woke up around a quarter to eight. I wiped the sleep from out my eyes and I was feeling great. I flipped my radio on and to my utter surprise. I thought that it was eight o'clock but it was half past nine. I hopped up and put my feet on the floor. ran to the bathroom then I (ow) hit my foot on the door. the pain was immense as it started to throb. I said to hell with broken toes I was losing my job. so I combed my hair then I brushed my teeth. threw on my Fila suit and my Fila sneaks. threw on my Fila underwear and my Fila hat. then I ran downstairs and kicked the fila cat. I grabbed my jacket then I grabbed my keys. then I prayed out loud car start please. the car started but what good was that. I couldn't drive it anyway because the tires were flat. I did the hundred yard dash to the top of my block. then I grabbed a dollar bill from my left sweat sock. the bus pulled up I was late and kind of nervous. I got real mad because the sign said out of service. I started hiking it I wasn't liking it. I saw a little kid I stole his bike and started biking it. I thought I got away but when I ducked around the corner. there was twelve cop cars I said I'm a goner. slamed on the flat I did 180 turn. peddled the bike so fast I heard the rubble burn. with the cops in hot pursuit I started feeling like a jerk. I thought man all of this cause I was trying to get to work. I could've got away I almost had 'em shook. til this girl walked by something said not to look. but I thought what the heck a little peek can't hurt. but she made me miss the sign that said men at work. I screamed out loud as I crashed through the baracade. I saw my whole life flash before my face. I felt kind of dizzy all I saw was stars. I put my hands over my eyes and settled on the handle bars. that was stupid I got off track. cause about that point everything went black. the next thing I remember is a head ache nagging. I woke up face down in the back of a paddy wagon. I pinched myself to make sure I wasn't dead. a big Flinstone lump on the side of my head. they took my picture and my finger prints. I said wait you can't arrest me I'm the Fresh Prince. I demand that you release me you incompetent fool. you can't arrest me I'm the Prince you know the rules. you got five seconds 'fore I punch out your lights. but then the cop pulled out his gun I said ha ha psyche. I had a call so I called my boss. I figured I might as well what else could be lost. boss I'm sorry that I couldn't make it today. he said what are you talking about you're off today is Saturday. stuck in a cell scared as hell. I'm a hungry kind of tired and I hate this awful smell. maybe one day I'll get smart and change my ways. but for now it's just one of those days. it's just one of those days.
just rockin',Each and every day when I come home from school. Like clockwork I go up into my bedroom. I secure the door and it's the moment of truth. I flip on my sound system and let the bass loose. The earthquake bass makes the walls all tremble. A discotheque is what my room resembles. How loud it gets to me it does not matter. I open up the windows so the glass don't shatter. The blast falls off my neighbour's wall. My phone rings of the hook with complaint phone calls. But I just let it ring and I don't go near it. I turn the volume up so that I can't hear it ring. My ear drums rumble my lungs vibrate. I'm in my own world and this realm is great. We rock this power at my command. The decibels exceed the limits human ears can stand. The lower frequency better known as bass. Sitting nice with the treble at a jazzy pace. My neighbours complain they say they can't endure. They form a congregation outside my front door. Mothers who yell saying its too loud. Start banging on my door to turn it down. My response to my mother when she starts knockin. Is come on mum I'm just rockin. (rockin). (ready rock c). This style that's mine is rarely heard. Suddenly there is an opportunity to observe. People gots my rhyme the super computer. The literary genius rhyme ruler of the future. I'm the fresh prince slaying all emcee. So hold the red cup when we take to your knees. Pay home submit you can't defuse my scheme. Cause I'm the fresh prince and this is my regime. To all other rappers you're being subdued. I don't mean to be rude but this is my prelude. This introductory performance has just one plot. A sample jeff and about me and my DJ rocks. I'm not listening to reason so don't try to talk. Do yourself a favour and take a walk. Or I'll amputate your mic and repossess your core. I'm the man salute to the prince the power lord. My friends I'll mangle you if we tangle put my arms in your asophogus and I'll strangle you. I'm the messiah or rhymes the verbal gladiator. I'm like a bomb and my turbo is the detonator. The crown chief of the poetry industry. Vocabulary that to others is a fantasy. highly respected by the public at large. The prince will rock is taking charge. I'm like a tiger in a battle field I'm invincible. You want a battle me man be sensible. I'll never submit to any other emcee. Be a duel to the death either him or me. And as I verbalise to my DJ's cut. If we kill a wack crew or two so what. We just rock it. We just rock it. DJ Jeff. Break 2. On each occasion that I perform. The force captures my body like a magical storm. Suddenly I'm rendered helpless in a state of shock. But it is rather abrupt when I start to rock. Adrenalin rushes my ego swells. And the yells of the crowd make my hype excel. My metabolism quickens my body gets sense. That's when I metamorphosise into the royal fresh prince. And as I display all my lyrical beauty. You become a slave as your hype increases. And as I vocalise I can see it in your eyes. You stand up as your enthusiasm levels rise higher and higher beyond the mark of red. You scream oh my to what the prince just said. As my energy is drained from being so crushed. All of a sudden I get another adrenalin rush. It happens each and everytime that my dj spins. More commonly known as my second wind. The spotlights are beaming. You are screaming. From my body all the sweat is streaming. Commanding the stage. And perpetually frayed. Giving my all to the pulse of. One hundred percent everytime I rhyme. When I step off the stage that's when the stop. And that has been the account of the evenings events. Reporting to you live by me the fresh prince. I'm the latest that you heard so you may seem shockin. (what does it all mean). I'm just rockin. Rockin rockin rockin. Go crazy. (fresh).
just the two of us,"(Now dad this is a very sensitive subject). Verse 1. From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms. I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm. Although questions arose in my mind. would I be man enough?. Against wrong, choose right and be standin up. From the hospital that first night. Took a hour just ta get the carseat in right. People drivin all fast, got me kinda upset. Got you home safe, placed you in your basonette. That night I don't think one wink I slept. As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept. Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt. Cause I know I loved you more than life itself. Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please. Let me be a good daddy, all he needs. Love, knowledge, discipline too. I pledge my life to you. Chorus. Just the two of us, we can make it if we try. Just the two of us, (Just the two of us).

Everybody in the back now (whoot, whoot). Everybody on the side now (whoot, whoot). La fiesta (whoot, whoot). All the ladies in da house now (whoot, whoot). All the fellas in da house now (whoot, whoot). Everybody in the house now (whoot, whoot). La fiesta (whoot, whoot). If I approach you correctly. And step up to you respectfully. Will you please ma’am bless me with the next dance?. I don’t intend to offend you. I only intend to befriend you. But you’re willing me, thrilling me, killing me. With them hot pants, not a chance. I’mma let you go without saying something. A little hotter lombada mama that’s all that I’m wanting. No frontin’ if it was illegal for you to be that fine. I be McGruff mama taking a bite out of crime. Literally, first it’ll be dancing with me. Then it’ll be dinner with me. Then it’ll be back to my crib. Hold up, I’m about to get ahead of myself. And I’m playing myself. The type of brother that when I’m thinking of stuff. I’m saying the stuff. My bad, back it up let’s start with a dance. On good behavior, maybe later. Maybe your apartment, your pad. Sike, joke, walking a tight rope. My foot in my mouth. Look, I hope is that you’ll dance with me. What’s up?. Repeat 1. She was smiling I was kind wiling. Thinking I'm dialin’ in. She gave me the impression that she was getting my message. So I’m testing. I threw it out there ‘Let me buy you a drink’. Cause when I buy you I think it would be fly if we link. What’cha think?. She responded with a grin and a glance. Then my eyes tried to seduce her to the forbidden dance. The body of a Latin goddess, sexy but modest. The hottest mami chula from Cuba, a cutie with promise. The other night I seen her dancing. Duty was over. She did a split into a spin. And put her leg on his shoulder. And he was over. If that was me and I was he. We’d probably still be dancing. Mami can you feel me?. Still she said nothing. Why she be fronting?. Never seen another mami move like you. Groove like you. I’m saying I wanna dance with you. What’s up?. Repeat 1. To me when I’m dancing it’s aphrodisiatic. It’s automatic that I look in your eyes to help emphasize. Some people dance socially not emotionally. Closer to me, come on close as you can be. (Can you feel me?). Come on mama cut me no slack. (Can you feel me?). Come on mama forward and back. (Can you feel me?). Come on mama as hard as you can. It’s part of the plan. It happens when you start with the man. On your mark, ready set, baby let’s go. Baby let’s flow, baby let go. Baby no, no, gotta a lot more. Lettin’ it rip, gimme some of that. *girl yells*. Yeah that’s it. Sweatin’ with me, getting it wetter with me. It’s better with me. Gain it, other girls I've dated ain’t famous. So take it or leave it. Just the way that I eat it. I bring, I swing it.

let's get busy baby,"Mmm say baby, you got some fries to go with that shake. Ay what are you man Yo man, that is no way to talk to a woman man. Man I been talkin to girls, man what are you talkin about. That girl looks good. Man look, you just, you buggin man, you know what you said. Okay, okay, alright you show me how to talk to a lady. Aight, bet, uhh sweetheart. Listen up toots I like your looks. I used to see girls like you in them girlie books. I'm losin my mind, but it's not lost yet. I'd pay a thousand dollars just to see your silhouette. Red is the rose's color, blue is the violet's. Here's my number baby, when you get home, dial it up. I'll be your man and you can be my lady and you can come to my house, and we can get busy baby. Girl forget about your boyfriend, he's nothin but a hassle. You can come with me and cold chill in my castle. Oh what a wonderful time it would be, imagine you and me, in my jacuzzi. Or horseback riding or we can play tennis. But, the most intimate part will be when it's time to eat dinner, we'll go get dressed. And then we'll give a call to antoin my private chef. First we'll eat crab legs, by candlelight. Then sip wine by the fire for the rest of the night. And if the time is right, I'll ask you to be my lady and we can dip right upstairs and get busy baby. You know since I first met you,. I wanted to let you know how I felt, so I could get you to treat me like a phone and take me off hold. And make your hero come so I can pour my heart and soul. I can't help but dream about the ultimate life. Two kids, a dog, a goldfish and you as my wife. We'd have a rosebush with a white picket fence. And all the neighbourhood kids would call me Mr. Prince. And on the lazy Saturday afternoons. Right after me and the kids get finished watching cartoons. We could send them both outside to go playin. And we could spend some time upstairs, get what I'm sayin. The only problem, that we would have is whether or not to drive the Porsche, the Benz, or the Jag. And every night before bed, flip the radio on and sip Dom Perignon to the quiet storm. Gucci, Louis Vuitton, you want more. Gloria Vanderbilt or Liz Claiborne or Christian Dior from head to foot. The world is yours if you'll be my toots. Oh I know what your problem is. Look those other chicks are just good friends. I'll give up my harem if you'll be my lady. C'mon what do you say, ha. Let's get busy baby. Look, be honest, come on, don't lie. Tell the truth I'm a hell of a guy, right. Pretty smile, light brown eyes. I've got miles on them other guys, face it. You could search America, Russia or Germany but never will you find another man equivalent to me. But let's discuss it, perhaps over lunch about how I'll be your poopsie, and you will be my hunnybunch. Now isn't that special. Why ain't you widdit?. You'll be my only girl, yeah, that's the ticket. Life's a risky business, babe you know the deal. Sometimes you just gotta say what the hell. Now is that time, roll for the money. Life is a gamble but I'm a sure thing honey. Girl, you know you driving me crazy. So how bout it come on let's get busy baby."

loretta,"LORETTA (THIS IS A TRUE STORY). CHORUS. Loretta, wrote a love letter to a stranger thought that he would change her life. Thought she would be his wife OH Loretta. Never ever meant him no danger, her love for his sustained her. Thought that he would change her life. Miss Loretta, a young girl, I never really met her,. A fun girl, a real go-getter, I heard a gold Jetta. A full with books & herb or so I’m told, hooked on my every word. Oh so bold, a love letter cleverly worded in a jacket pocket. Wrapped inside a platinum locket. In the shape of a heart with pictures of me. Had it inscribed, “no us, no him then no me. She fell in love with the Prince of Bel-Air. Fantasy was to see me & to be with me there. So she wrote a love letter to me & then she signed it Loretta. Said, “I gotta go get him, Will is my Soulmate”. We gotta be together how could we not be together. But wait if I send the letter I mean how will I be sure if they give it to him. What if they don’t give it to him, that would ruin everything. I gotta take it to him myself. CHORUS. She packed all that she owned into the back of her Jetta,. her backpack, her cellphone & a love letter. Most of her stuff was done up with pictures of me on it with a phrase “It’s gonna be” on it. Her mother begging her please come home & then Loretta resenting her. Leave me alone Ma! I won’t leave my destiny unfulfilled. “You’re just jealous be cause Daddy ain’t as sweet as my Will”,(click). To the front gate at NBC, in June & July, backstage at MTV,. she would drive anyplace that they’d mention I’d be. Told herself, “strive for love & God eventually. he would give me to her & her to me, this was meant to be. see me & my men on CNN, then the birth of the inevitable hate begin. cause hate is the chld to greatness. the glue between Neo & the Smiths in the matrix, yin to the yang. It just must be, ask anybody with a Grammy or an MVP. (B SECTION). I said stop, get out, I don’t need this hate around me. All your negativity might drown me I just try to go hard, doing my job. Stop, get out – the whole world loves me cause I do what I do. & I don’t like the energy coming from you Trying to play me soft, wave em off. CHORUS. (I just wave em off, yeah) I ain’t concerned with your hatin’ that don’t slow down my paper makin. (wave em off, yeah) While the whole world recognize, you looking at me with your crooked eyes. (wave em off yeah) Love me, I paved the way, boys we can’t behave this way come on. (wave em off, yeah)While the whole world recognize, you looking at me with your crooked eyes. Coming of age I invaded nations, on stage, I seen Haitian & Asian faces. No vacations just more locations, I go places, so chasing my vocation. So demonstrating the way to be patient with life’s test, through my IRS situations. My guess is my dedication don’t phase ya, a public sensation, in private you hatin’. Why? That’s so last year, that’s so not sexy, but I shall not let the hate stress me. I got bigger fish to fry & I could stand on my wallet, probably kiss the sky. When I close my eyes, I wish that I could change how you get pissed when I do things you can’t deny. Truth is, Great do need Hate to survive, so I…. CHORUS. Block ‘em out, ignore ‘em (wave em off). Don’t pay these jokers no mind (wave em off). They just all mad cause they in the coat section of the hate train & they can’t get off. Still flaming boy, stand clear of the hatin’ is the best defense Tryin to exceed excellence. Same way hope comes with fear, yo,. Greatness lives here, then ‘hateness’ lives here, Trust!"
lost & found,"[INTRO]. Original - A first form from which varieties arise. An authentic work of art as opposed to an imitation or reproduction. [REFRÃO]. Why should I try to sound like ya'll sound. That's what's wrong with the rap game right now. Man, it's like a circus wit a bunch of clowns. Wit a bunch of clicks I'll probably rap circles around. [VERSO 1]. I spit heatrock and I ain't talking rollin. Soon as the beat knock I'm crowd controlling. When I hear ya'll that a awful sound. I don't ride beats I take them off the ground. Land them somewhere show them the town. Even on foreign ground I let them know I'm around. I don't follow everybody when it's time to rap. At one time everybody thought the world was flat. Sounds like you that was my intention. I paid dues now dudes pay attention. I live for it even though the flicks is hittin'. Cribs sick you can see the booth from the kitchen. Speak on it cause I saw it happen. This is hip hop dawg. I ain't just rappin. Ya'll looking at a real MC. Man you couldn't check a mic for me. [REFRÃO]. Why should I try to sound like ya'll sound. That's what's wrong wit the rap game right now. Why should I try to flow the way ya'll flow. Or do a show like ya'll show. Naw that ain't where my head at now. Ya'll in the hip hop lost and found. Man, that's wrong with the rap game right now. It's like a circus wit a bunch of clowns. Wit a bunch of clicks. I'll probably rap circles around. [VERSO 2]. Let's talk about rhyme capability. Let's talk about hip hop versatility. Let's talk about taking the game beyond. Now how the hell we gon have a battle of wits. Trick you ain't armed. Let's talk about love for the game. I mean real love. Back before there was fame. I'm real wit it. I ain't claiming to reign. But when ya'll talk about rap. Ya'll gon start saying my name. For real though I ain't playin. Plenty of ya'll love a brotha just scared to say it. Yo the first ever rap grammy. Let's talk about the only reason yo ass went to Miami. (Yup) truck wit rims (check) throw back jersey (check). champagne bottles (check) lot's of models (check). Damn that's the list for 90 percent of ya'll videos and songs. Am I wrong. [REFRÃO]. [VERSO 3]. LOST. When you a slave to the biz. Wit no care for the cost of what you sayin to kids. FOUND. Is when ya lyrics are a test of time. And your mom hear that your spirit is blessed divine. LOST. Is when you rhyme til your throat gets sore. But you don't even believe what you say no more. FOUND. Is when you bleed heart into the mic. And the pain you sustain it can change a life. LOST.

lovely daze,It's ten a.m. and I just woke up. Walked to the window and opened the shades up. Sun so bright that I can hardly see. but I'm a black man so I pass on a tan. dip to the bathroom take me a shower. but first called up my girl told her be ready in an hour. I was still a bit tired man I'm laggin'. grabbed the tooth brush to kil the dragon. ooh have mercy great day in the morning. turn on the water and I'm stretchin' and yawnin'. tryin' to get a blend to the hot winter cold. man I'm young but why I feel so old. get it just right then step to the mirror. rubbin' my eyes to make my vision get clearer. everything looks a-o.k. and today is gonna be a lovely day. Chorus:. (a lovely day) lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely daze (lovely daze) X 2. So I jet out the crib and hop in the benzo. today is my girls day can't none of my friends go. just me and her top down on the highway. if you're gonna do it then why not do it the fly way. first a car wash next the barber shop. then off to my girls crib that's my next stop. a dozen roses a card and candy. I'm a true mackadocious Mr. Romanty. she hoped in and she asked where we're goin'. yo we like a twig in the nile we just flowin'. maybe to the beach or maybe hook up a picnic. but yo it doesn't matter cause today we just kickin' it. I threw in my homemade slow tape. and off to the beach for some beautiful landscape man. this is a bonafide lovers delight. got the ocean on the left the mountains on the right. I said yeah cause that's the way I was feelin'. free as a bird got the clouds for a ceiling. I wish that I could press the gas and fly away. today has been a lovely day. chorus. it's dark outside now and it's gettin' kinda late. the date was great but here comes the moment that I hate. it's too bad a lovely day has gotta end up like this. a wave goodbye with a hug and good night kiss. mmmm I said good night my lovely I said mmmm good night my lovely. she said what you gonna leave me all alone. oh I forgot to tell you there ain't nobody home. now y'all know me I'm a real cool guy but inside things was kinda like the fourth of July. I walked inside I said hello there miss. then she gave me a kiss oh you want some of this. unh passion building mentally bonding. slowly I caress her and she's respondin'. just close your eyes and keep thinkin' of me. here I come girl. mmm lovely. chorus
magnificent jazzy jeff,"Some deejays are (good) some deejays are (fresh). Some deejays are even (def). But here's a little somethin 'bout my deejay. (The magnificient) Jazzy Jeff. So bust this beat. (Disc) (jock). Yo Jazzy. [ VERSE 1: The Fresh Prince ]. Well, it's true that I'm the reigning king of the throne. But with all my strength, I couldn't do it alone. I need a deejay like (Jazzy) to back me up. So when I'm rockin on the mic he's on the crossfade cut. Scratchin and mixin, mixin and scratchin. Second after second it's the record he's catchin. His hands are so fast that it's a medical riddle. With the turntable split and the mixer in the middle. Back and forth his hands fly. With the speed of a cheetah that'll puzzle your eye. Record after record, he has no mercy. Cuts left, cuts right, then he cuts vice versa. I'm not exaggerating, I said it and I meant it. I resent it if you say that his cuts are precedented. He's a lean, mea,n wreckin machine. He gets respected like a king when he's on the scene. So bust a move, cause you know he's def. He's my deejay (the magnificient) Jazzy Jeff. [ VERSE 2: The Fresh Prince ]. People often ask me everytime I emcee. Why do I brag so much about my disc jockey?. Well, the reason that I brag and I boast the most. Is cause my deejay is the most from coast to coast. (The magnificient) Jazzy Jeff, wack destroyer. Cuttin up records like a samurai warrior. If you deejays don't know who I'm talkin to. (I'm talkin to you) so (come on). Cause in a battle you cannot win. Cause my deejay will (tear yo butt limb from limb!). He's like a runaway tank, a hip-hop rebel. And if you wanna battle, you best bring a shovel. My man, so you can dig your grave. Cause there's no way that you could ever be saved. Because (the deejay cuts the record) to create the sound. (The deejay cuts the record) he's the best around. (The deejay cuts the record) you know he's down. His name is Jazzy Jeff a/k/a Jeff Townes. Commandin the cut he's always on track. He's DJ Jazzy Jeff and he's a cut maniac. So for your personal safety you should be told. That my DJ Jazzy Jeff is (out of control). (Oh my God). (Out of control). (My goodness). Alright Jazzy. We gon' do somethin a little different right now. This is what I want you to do for me. I want you to tell all these people your name. Jazzy, tell em your name. (He's Jazzy). (His name is Jeff). Yo Jazzy, I want you to tell all these people. How many of those deejays out there can get with you. (None). (None of them). How many?. (None of them). Tell the truth. (None). (None of them). (None of them). Now make the record burp. ( *Jazzy Jeff produces burping sounds with the record* ). Say excuse me. ( *Jazzy Jeff makes the scratch sound like an 'excuse me'* ). Now make it sound like a bird. ( *Jazzy Jeff makes the record sound like a bird singing* ). Now make it chirp. ( *the sound changes from singing to chirping *). [ VERSE 3: The Fresh Prince ]. Now here's a story that should not be forgot. About the day my deejay turned into an autobot. He got struck by lightning in an electrical storm. He got on the wheels of steel and began to transform. ( *Jazzy Jeff transforms* ). His name is Jeff, and he's as swift as a swiff. The type of guy that other deejays don't want to have to eckon with. He's by my side as I rock the mic. All of his vigorous cuts are sure to excite you. They'll delight you, you know that that's right, if you. Were a stick of dynamite, his cuts would ignite you. The deejay on the weels can't be matched. So (check out Jazzy Jeff with a cold cut scratch). (Good). (Jazzy). (The magnificient). (Jazzy Jeff). ( *JJ brings James Brown's 'Funky Drummer' into the mix). (Ain't it funky)"

That was the worst night right. What. I mean we had fun and all. Yeah that's true but. You had somebody else and I did to. So it felt like karma and fate had formed a team. To keep me from the girl of my dreams. But in the end I made friends with hope and destiny. And then well the rest is history. But yo it wasn't easy though trust in me. Tryin' to turn you and me into us. You my homie my lover my best friend. The white house to the ghetto you blend right in and I dig that. I could never imagine this passion I feel. I mean couldn't imagine how we could last what I feel. But if someone do somethin' to you. Shoot girl I might just.... Maybe it's your attitude. Maybe it's your point of view. Maybe it's the time we spend together. Maybe we could do this thing forever. Maybe it's your soldier rage. Maybe it's your golden gaze. Maybe it's the way we blend together. Maybe we should do this thing forever. [Tra-Knox]. I must tell you how I love you. Maybe your my soul mate. Maybe my best friend. You make me and mold me a better man. Yes I can believe in loooooove.

momma knows,"At 17 years old I started runnin' the streets. Man, I had some fun in the streets. 11, 12, sometimes 1 in the streets. By 18 I started seeing the sun in the streets. My mom started trippin' on me. Like Will, you gotta choose your friends carefully. Like, I trust you but please call me. And when you have kids of your own you'll see. I'ma be here when all your friends won't. But I was busy hollerin'. Parents just don't,understand. Now here I am with a family. Runnin' the lines she ran on me. We ain't always see eye to eye. But Mom, on your principles. Now I rely, you got me tastin' my toes. CHORUS. I didn't know. Momma told me don't go down that road. But I gotta go where I gotta go. So take your fool telling me I told you so. I used to roll hard with this dude named Chuck. Rollin' in my car with this dude named Chuck. My Mommy really liked this dude named Chuck. She thought he was really and polite, Chuck. And me used to roll out faithfully, inevitibly. You see Chuck, you gon' see me. Like we on TV, the bosom is the buddy. Share food, clothes, and money, and hunnies. Flock like we was players from the NBA. Still hurts to recall the day I heard him say. To this girl named Mya. I was diggin', he told her I was a liar. Told her I be cheatin' on women. Breakin' hearts and grinnin'. He told her her life would be better with him in it. That's the friend I chose. CHORUS REPEAT. Momma used to say take your time young man. I ain't always gonna be there , holding your hand. But, you'll always know exactly where I am. And when I'm not there in my place. The Lord will stand Will. Study the world, only the wise succeed. And when you're eyes tell lies. Your heart should lead. You're gonna do dirt. We all gon' sin. But when you realize it, apologize. And never do it again. Mom told me don't rush to get old. If you got youth, truth clutched in your hold. It's like possiblities. Too much to behold. An emotional shield from life's blustery cold. Mom, all this stuff was hard you said was hard. Childish disregard cuz my head was hard. Now, no question opposed, ugh. CHORUS REPEAT. . . . ."

ms. holy roller,"INTRO]. Mic check 1, 2.. this is dedicated to an old friend of mine, Michelle.... [CHORUS]. Ms. Holy Roller, new angel, got ya Bible out shoutin' and you're ringing a bell. mid-life, reborn, can't wait to tell, if I don't believe what you believe,. I'm going to hell.... I've been down with Jesus since Sunday school & Easter speeches. The Bible was survival, that's what my grandma would teach us. Since I was 5, I've been dying and trying to read it When I did I did, it redefined it. Now you was 34 when you found Jesus after your life fell to pieces. Wife two times, with two guys, now enlightened in speeches. Seemed to flow out your mouth with the hype of a preacher. Took your whole life to reach you, now I'm a trifling creature. [CHORUS]. Come on, if I die right this second, I reckon that God would simply check. into my life & times, dissecting my rhymes, he'll see how I've been leading his troops. You can't do dirt your whole life then say ""oops'!. [BRIDGE]. Now where was Jesus, when you life then you was cheatin', when you was deceiving me?. Where was Jesus when you greedy, your lawyers was bleeding me?. Where was Jesus when every weekend, a new man living with you?. Oh, wait he was with me, trying to keep me from killing you?. Now, where was Jesus when you was lying & you was betraying me?. When I was trying to make it, you was hatin' delayin' me, huh?. Where was Jesus when the ice was thrilling you,. Oh, he was he with me trying to keep me from killing you!. If I ain't know Jesus, ain't no telling where I would be. It's been nights I felt like feces; I needed to fight to release it. I'm in the limelight, it's hot & the heat is ceaseless,. Holding my tongue while little bums cut me to pieces. The only reason's cause I studied the life of Jesus &. Venting with my pen, intending to write & release it. But when an ex-friend would slight me or slam me with venom. I hate it, I can't stand it, damnit, I really resent it. I always strive to be righteous, my version of God. The reason why I never write verses with curses inside. The reason I never purposely hurt persons,. I've applied many teaching of God,. Searching the reaches of God. Pondered the mysteries of why you be dissing me,. I adore you all I hope for you is freedom from misery. You made mistakes & blunders, you breaking from under. But yo, If I'm going to hell, it's making me wonder.. [BRIDGE]. The greatest atrocities ever committed on this planet have been in the. name of God. This country was founded by Puritans, for the expressed purpose of. oppression-free worship. Your attitude is the same arrogant, fearful fundamentalism that fueled the. hatred of the Crusades. & the attacks on 9/11.. If we are not allowed to worship God as groups & individuals free from. persecution, in respectful. Tolerance, there's only one outcome.... [CHORUS]. ----. Letra por: gOk"
my buddy,"I'd like to know, are you really for some super-dynamite sou. Introducing the world's greatest entertainer. The amazing Mr. Beat-Beat himself. The hardest working beatbox in show business. Ready Rock. (Ready, Ready Rock, Ready Rock C). Tell em your name, tell em your name. (Ready Rock, Ready Rock, Ready Rock, Ready Rock C). Ooh that was nice Ready. (Ready Rock). Ready Rock. Hey man, hold up man. I think I wanna tell em a little about this man. Aight break it down Ready, break it down. Please pay attention, to my rhymes so I can tell you all about this pal of mine. He's my buddy, my best friend. When it's a beat I need it's a beat he'll lend. I wanna take time-out, to talk about him. Cause frankly I don't know what I would do without him. We work together like a medical crew. When I'm backin Ready up (I'm backin Prince up too). Tryin to beat us, that doesn't make any sense. He's Ready Rock C, and I'm the Fresh Prince. In the rap industry we're ranked at first. Ain't a better combination in the whole universe. So if you wanna battle your future looks muddy. That you just can't beat, my buddy. Word, break it down break it down Ready. We've won so many battles, people think it's a trick. That when the crowd gets to judge it's US that they'll pick. They see Ready's face and then they hear my voice. To choose us as the winners is the natural choice. Because battle after battle we remain on top. Cause it's not the way we look, it's the way that we rock. So if you thought you wanted to battle, bust this rhyme. Just keep it and I'm sure that I can change your mind. There was ten wack dudes trying to play high post. One crew got bold and they began to boast. But said, Y'all shut up and get back in line. But they refused (what happened now) So now there's nine. Nine wack crews tryin to rock like this. They were bitin my rhymes and just couldn't resist. I said please stop bitin, please don't imitate. But they kept on bitin, so there's now there's eight. Eight wack crews poppin big time trash. Telling us that in a battle we can't last. The battle started at 10:30 and by quarter of eleven was no longer eight crews (how many was their). There was seven. Seven wack cruise in a football huddle. Trying to figure out their next rebuttal. They came out strong you'd think their The Ultimate but we just dissed em and dismissed, so now there's six. Six wack groups, tryin to be tough. Who the hell told em they could rock the mic like us. We got straight down the business didn't pop no jive. We just blew em out, so now there's five. Five wack crews lined up in the hallway. All perpetrating like they're read to play. My secretary walked out, she asked for one more. They got scared, and left, so now there's four. Four wack crews outside playing around. I said I'll take you wall on, now how does that sound?. Not one had heart enough to pick up that mic. I said, okay I'll let you go, psych. That's the moral, of this story. Never try to take me and Ready Rock's glory. Cause if you do your future looks muddy. Cause you just can't beat me and my buddy. Haha word, uh. Yeah Ready Rock, hold up hold up hold up. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. What man what?. C'mon man, man, I wonder, can, can I just interrupt the record for a second?."
nightmare on my street,"Now I have a story that I'd like to tell. About this guy you all know he had me scared as hell. He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed. He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred. He wears the same hat and sweater every single day. And even if it's hot outside he wears it anyway. He's home when I'm awake but he shows up when I sleep. I can't believe that there's a nightmare on my street. It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right. And we had just gotten back off tour last night. So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy. If we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movie. I got Angie Jeff got Tina. Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life. That was all right because the lady was chill. Then we dipped to the theater set to ill buggin cold havin a ball. Somethin about Elm st. was the movie we saw. The way it started was decent you know nuthin real fancy. About this homeboy named fred and this girl named nancy. But word when it was over I said yo that was def. And everything seemed all right when we left. But when I got home and laid down to sleep. That began the nightmare, but on my street. It was burning in my room like an oven. My bed soaked with sweat And man I was bugging. I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30. It had melted it was so darn hot And I was thirsty. I wanted something cool to quench my thirst. I thought to myself yo this heaters the worst. But when I got downstairs I noticed something was wrong. I was home all alone but the tv was on. I thought nothin off it as I grabbed the remote. I pushed the power button and then I almost choked. When I heard this awful voice coming from behind It said, ""You got my favorite letter but now you must die. Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was Broke inside my drawers and screamed, ""So long, cuz"". Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screaming Then thought, ""Oh, I get it, I must be dreaming"". I strolled back home with a grin on my grill I think that since this is a dream I might as well get ill. I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince. But Freddy killed all that noise real quick. he grabbed me by my neck and said ""Here's what we'll do We gotta lotta work here, me and you The souls of your friends you and I will claim You've got the body and I've got the brain"". I said, ""Yo Fred I think you got me all wrong I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long. Look, I'll be honest man, this team won't work The girls won't be on you, Fred, your face is all burnt"". Fred got mad and his head started steaming. But I thought what the hell im only dreamin. I said please leave Fred so I can get some sleep. But give me a call maybe we'll hang out next week. I patted him on the shoulder, said ""thanks for stopping by"". then I opened up the door and said ""take care guy"". he got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt. I laughed at first, then thought, ""hold up, that hurt"" It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real. I said, ""Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here"". No further words and then I darted upstairs. Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed. Pulled the covers up over my head And said, ""Oh please do something with Fred"". He jumped on my bed, went through the covers with his claws. Tried to get me, but my alarm went off And then silence. It was a whole new day I thought, ""Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway"". Until I noticed those rips in my sheets. And that was proof that there had been a nightmare on my street. FP: Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff Come on, come on Come on Jeff, answer Come on, man. JJ: Hello?. FP: Jeff, this is Prince, man Jeff, wake up, Jeff, wake up. JJ: What do you want?. FP: Jeff, wake up, man, listen to me, Jeff. JJ: It's three o'clock in the morning, what do you want?. FP: Jeff, Jeff, would you listen to me? Listen, whatever you do, don't fall asleep. JJ: Man. FP: Jeff, listen to me, don't go to sleep, Jeff. JJ: look, I'll talk to you tomorrow, I'm gong to bed Ahhhhhh! Ahhhhhh! (Ha ha ha ha ha haaaa). FP: Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Answer me, Jeff! I'm your D.J. now, Princey! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haaaaa. ."

nothin' on my mind,"[Chorus - Tra Knox - singing]. Nothin's on my mind - 16X. . [Verse 1 - Will Smith]. Today I'm goin' freestyle. And everythin' is gonna be about me now. And I ain't doin' nothin', I'm gonna cool out. A little somethin' bumpin', but not too loud. Nothin' jumpin'. I'm gonna get my golf clubs. Or call me a masseuse, and get me a soft rub. Or noddin' with a mimosa, in my hot tub. Or two-way momma me, let's go and get a nice scrub. Yeah maybe that, or maybe I could swim some. Or rollin' in my Bentley, follow my rims some. Where? Yo, I don't know, care if none of my friends come. A hat and shades go out and try to blend some, yeah right. Days off is hard to come by. Especially for Hollywood's number one guy. So let me get to movin', while the sun is high. My cell is off, two-way is off. It's yearly crazy, today is gravy. . [Chorus]. . [Verse 2 - Will Smith]. Half awake and half asleep. As I watch the sun, it slightly moved a little past its peak. And I feel like Tom Hanks but it's perfect, I'm a ""Cast Away"". Agenda full of nothin' but stuff to pass today. My sister asked me to cook somethin'. But that would fall into the category of doin' somethin'. And I done already said to ya'll that I ain't doin' nothin'. So let me say it again to be clear I ain't doin' nothin'. Hmm, phew, a breather. I meant what I meant, when I said, when I said it's all leisure. Neither, chart toppin' crowd pleaser. Phone rang Jada said, ""Uhh he's uhh,"" I ain't home, so turn that phone off. Come and sit on my lap, and take a load off. And lay down into my arms, and we could doze off. To work as much as I work, I must be thrown off, what a day. . [Chorus]. . [Tra-Knox]. Yo, yo, yo, mic check, mic check. Ah, that's cool. . [Will Smith]. That's hot right. . [Tra-Knox]. Yeah, alright I'm gonna do the umm. . [Will Smith]. Hey Ramon help me out dog. . [Tra-Knox]. This is hot. . [Will Smith]. Yo chief, yo Tone, come on. . [Chorus]. Nothin's on my mind - 25X"

Your on trial but you can't win. Cause I wrote the script you die in the end. So throw in the towel sign off just give it up. You tried to beat me in a game that I made up. And by the time you learnt the rules and tried to change your fate. Its too little too late sorry chump check mate. I'm in the room to do my thing. You wanna battle lets go just get your butt in the ring. 10 seconds and its over I yell out who's next. I got you off guard with the lyrical suplex. I flex my lyrics so that you cant jinx.

parent's just don't understand,"You know parents are the same. No matter time nor place. They don't understand that us kids. Are going to make some mistakes. So to you, all the kids all across the land. There's no need to argue. Parents just don't understand. I remember one year. My mom took me school shopping. It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister. All hopped in the car. We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall. My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose. I didn't say nothing at first. I just turned up my nose. She said, ""What's wrong? This shirt cost $20"". I said, ""Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!"". The next half hour was the same old thing. My mother buying me clothes from 1963. And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate. I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!. I said, ""Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep"". She said, ""You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet"". I said, ""Mom, let's put these clothes back, please"". She said ""no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show"". I said, ""This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer. Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers. But if you don't want to I can live with that but. You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks"". She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same. Inevitably the first day of school came. I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick. But my mom said, ""No, no way, uh-uh, forget it"". There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax. I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts. And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought. The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought. And those who weren't laughing still had a ball. Because they were pointing and whispering. As I walked down the hall. I got home and told my Mom how my day went. She said, ""If they were laughing you don't need the,. ""Cause they're not good friends"". For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom. That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times. So to you all the kids all across the land. There's no need to argue. Parents just don't understand. Oh-kay, here's the situation. My parents went away on a week's vacation and. They left the keys to the brand new Porsche. Would they mind?. Umm, well, of course not. I'll just take it for a little spin. And maybe show it off to a couple of friends. I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood. Well, maybe I shouldn't. Yeah, of course I should. Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot. I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block. That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking. I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking. You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions. I honked my horn just to get her attention. She said, ""Was that for me?"". I said, ""Yeah"". She said, ""Why?"". I said, ""Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy"". She said, ""How do I know you're not sick?. You could be some deranged lunatic"". I said, ""C'mon toots - my name is the Prince =. Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?"". She agreed and we were on our way. She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word. We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive. We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes. She kicked her shoes off onto the floor. She said, ""Drive fast, speed turns me on"". She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas. We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast. The sun roof was open , the music was high. And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh. She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far. I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car. We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche. And to make this long story short - short. When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell. I said, ""I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer"". I almost had a heart attack that day. Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway. I was arrested, the car was impounded. There was no way for me to avoid being grounded. My parents had to come off from vacation to get me. I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me. My parents walked in. I got my grip, I said, ""Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?"". They didn't speak. I said, ""I want to plead my case"". But my father just shoved me in the car by my face. That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived. They took turns -. One would beat me while the other one was driving. I can't believe it, I just made a mistake. Well parents are the same no matter time nor place. So to you all the kids all across the land. Take it from me. Parents just don't understand."

I was a mini-party starter then. My mind bends when I call my pen. The big question should I run the mind a vittle. Food for thought or dumb the rhyme a little. But Will ""if you come to high that'll alienate folks & they won't buy. it""(yo),. Look, people getting trapped in the track. & they be clappin', even when the rappin' is wack.

pump up the bass,"In the place to be. DJ Jazzy Jeff and yours truly the Fresh Prince. Ay Jeff, do me a favor, give em just a lil touch of the bass. Not a lot, just a lil' touch Jeff. Word word. Ay Jeff do me a favor man, Jazz it up. Now bring it all back. Yo man now break it down and let me go for mine. When I first started out, Jeff used to come to my house. Just as soon as school let out, he used to come to my crib, and you know what we did. We bugged out like two little kids, word. Jeff on the wheels, and me on the m-i-c. A better combination there could never be. So let's go back, for old time's sake. Yo Jeff! (what) Pump up the bass. I like my music loud. The volume, pumpin, the kick drum thumpin. The people jumpin, up out there seats when this record comes on, you think something's wrong. The bass is too strong. You don't have to check your record, it's not defective. It's just the way we wanted it, pump it, get it. We like it loud, strong like a magnum force. I am the lyricist Jeff is the rhythm source. This combination, is virtually omnipotent. That means invincible, you know, dominant. So don't you cross our path just stay out our face. Or we'll knock you down, or pump up the bass. Yo Jeff man, how bout a funky scratch. Now get funky with it. Now bring in the snare. Now break it down and bring it all back to me. Now pump up the bass. I'm hyped psyched up and I'm flowing so come on let's go in to the next segment, of this hip-hop fantasy. You say this can't be happening, why can't it be. It's an equation, mathematically correct. It's Jeff plus Prince, equals, hit records. Sounds too easy word, I know it does. You wanna know why well yo it's cause me and Jeff, oh, Jeff and I, excuse me. Blend like Kool-Aid, and flow like an uzi. That's why we can't be taken or broken or braken, whatever. And if you think we can, you're mistaken, we're clever. Cause all we did to make this record a hit. Was turn down the treble, pump up the bass kit. At the same time the volume was increased. Adding more strength, to this masterpiece. Of poetry, by now you know it's me. Poet, creativity, pushin, to out destiny. I am on the M-I-C, Jeffery is the Disc Jockey. And to keep us company, the human beat box Ready C. Backed up by a family, and that is all we need. So that we can be successful as we want to be. The future is in front of me so here is a taste. Of the future of hip-hop Jeff, pump up the bass!. Yo Jeff one more scratch man. Ready Rock C man give Jeff a hand."
pump ya brakes (feat. snoop dogg),"All this excess stress I can't take it. Slow that thing down, pump ya brakes kid. Why you gotta be all up in her face kid?. The Abs will get you numbers & the name kid. I mean really, houndin' ol' girl, was that really necessary. See your itinerary is all off. You need to be hauled off. She start flippin', she ain't trippin' it's your loss.. This is a simple case of an anti-brake pumper. You don't have to talk to women bumper to bumper. That mighta got you a couple of numbers when you were younger. But dude switch your whole approach, that ain't proper. Be a gentleman& try to be gentle man. The essence of stimulation mental man. But if your acting like you just got out the kennel man. Put your foot on the pedal & pump. [Chorus - Snoop Dogg]. If your girl's in ya face & she's outta place. What you need to tell her is... Pump Ya Brakes. If you're out with your girls & he's pressin' you hard. What you need to tell him is...Pump Ya Brakes. Now if you're underage & you're actin' all grown. What you need to do is Pump Ya Brakes. If you're offended by this record, then you know that's you. What you need to do is...Pump Ya Brakes. Outside the restaurant Girl sees Boy, Girl likes Boy. Girl meets Boy, Boy doesn't know that Girl thinks he's fly. Boy's a nice guy, so Boy says 'Hi'. Boy's Girlfriend returns from going to park. She sees them together this ignites a spark. Boy's girlfriend has a real loud bark. Now this is where the pumpin' of the brakes should start. Girlfriend thinks that something's going on. Girl tells Girlfriend nothings going on. Boy's in the middle of the commotion beginning. Girlfriend's mad cause Boy keeps grinning. Now, why is he grinning but that's beside the point. Girlfriend should chill before they roll up in the joint. Jumping to conclusions gets you no where honey. Pump ya brakes or be a crash test dummy. Dummy. [Chorus]. [Snoop Dogg Verse:]. Rule #1, is just like #2 the who do's and what nots & what you should dizz-oo. No loud talking, no back talking, If you do either, believe it, you're. back walking. I hate to sound rude but then again, I have to. My rap thang and my mack game, It'll smack you , click clack you, spit at you. I don't do it cause I want to, I do it cause I got to. I got a question to ask you, would you fall, stand tall, ball, or let em. smash you. If I was you & you was I, would you keep it G or would you stay fly. If you was rich in a ditch, living low, would you push the button,. Keep it cuttin' or would you just let it go. Calm down little homey & know what your dealing with before you run up on me. [Chorus]"

shadow dreams,"Shadow dreams. Dreams of a shadow. The analogy of a shadow dream. Dreams are to shadows as your shadows are to your dreams. In the deepest of the darkness it seams as though they're gone. In the light they are visible. Yet intangible and illusive. Your shadow is the true validation of the fact that you exist. Hence shadow dreams. And here we go. Shadow dreams they seem so distant. But the light is strong and no you can't resist it. Keep on pushing, hold out your hand. But light is your friend go on In ?carrolan?. Its always darkest before the light. Nothing's worth having if its not worth a fight. No love without labor, no labor no love. Draw on the strength bestowed from above. What can go wrong will go wrong. But if you fall of a horse just get back on. ""I have a dream"" the man stated. A shadow dream that he chased to his grave. Just because a dream is lurking in the shadows doesn't mean that you should just forget it. I mean you work and you push and you sweat and you toil and you strive and drive till you get it shadow dreams. Shadow Dreams. Dreams of a shadow (shadow dreams). Shadow Dreams. Dreams of a shadow. Every dark cloud is hiding a silver lining. But donâ€™t forget to mobilise, keep on climbing. Do all you can to keep your shadow alive. Because your not far behind if your shadow dies. Make sure you stop and you check tonight. That your shadow is behind you when you walk through the light. Cause a man without a shadow ain't a man at all. I mean I take it just for granted that my homies on the wall. Kids see the shadows and they wanna play. But sometimes their stolen, taken away. Adults are the thieves, the kids get robbed. Throw away that shadow boy go and get a job. Just because the dream is lurking in the shadows doesnâ€™t mean that you should forget it. I mean you work and you push and you sweat and you toil and you strive and drive till you get it shadow dreams. Shadow Dreams. Dreams of a shadow (shadow dreams). Shadow Dreams. Dreams of a shadow. Fourteen years old I used to want a beamer. I guess you could say I was what you'd call a shadow dreamer. I told my father that I didn't think I'd ever get in. I said I might as well just forget it. My father said son, donâ€™t be talking so dumb. Hard work and education makes anything come. And plus a shadow dream ain't as far as ya seem son. You used to be a shadow dream. Life is a mystery but lets check history. To see how many peoples shadow dreams came true. And if the other peoples shadow dreams are equal then why cant the next shadow dreamer be you. Thatâ€™s the philosophy I live my life by. When things get hard through the stress and strife I. Keep on pushing with a full head of steam. Like a train through the tunnel to my shadow dream. Shadow Dreams. Dreams of a shadow. Shadow Dreams. Dreams of a shadow. Shadow Dreams. Dreams of a shadow (Dreams). Shadow Dreams. Dreams of a shadow (Dreams). Uh ha. Shadow Dreams. Dreams of a shadowâ€¦."

Here it is the groove slightly transformed. just a bit of a break from the norm. just a little somethin' to break the monotony. of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be. a little bit out of control it's cool to dance. but what about the groove that soothes that moves romance. give me a soft subtle mix. and if ain't broke then don't try to fix it. and think of the summers of the past. adjust the base and let the alpine blast. pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme. and put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime. Chorus. Verse Two: Fresh Prince. school is out and it's a sort of a buzz. a back then I didn't really know what it was. but now I see what have of this. the way that people respond to summer madness. the weather is hot and girls are dressing less. and checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best. riding around in your jeep or your benzos. or in your Nissan stting on lorenzos. back in Philly we be ou in the park. a place called the plateau is where everybody goes. guys out hunting and girls doing likewise. honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes. she turn around to see what you beeping at. it's like the summers a natural afradesiac. and with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme. to hit you and get you equipped for the summer time. Chorus. Verse Three: Fresh Prince. it's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet. hustle to the mall to get me a short set. yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair. cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there. the temperature's about 88. hop in the water plug just for old times sake. break to ya crib change your clothes once more. cause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4. sitting with your friends cause y'all remincise. about the days growing up and the first person you kiss. and as I think back makes me wonder how. the smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia. all the kids playing out front. little boys messin round with the girls playing double-dutch. while the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family. reunion. then six o'clock rolls around. you just finished wiping your car down. it's time to cruise so you head to the summertime hangout. it looks like a car show. everybody come lookin real fine. fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon. every moment frontin and maxin. chillin in the car they spent all day waxin. leanin to the side but you can't spead through. Two miles an hour so everybody sees you. there's an air of love and of happiness. and this is the Fresh Prince's new defintion of summer madness. Chorus."

It ain't like I like a chick on chick or something. I'm just a sucker for a hot track. Gimme a drink and a chick to tell 'Stop that'. Dance is a hop and a clap, flip it round. Now bring it on back, break it down. Now switch. [chorus]. Uh uh uh. I gotta question, I need to ask somebody. Why is it that when y'all see me at the party. Y'all be looking like, ""Ooh, he a movie star. He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody"". But oh wait, whoa, y'all forgetting. When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written. First one in, last one out the club. Bursting in, passing out in the club. Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm. Taking you higher, like a syringe hittin' ya arm. Bringing the fire, making your Benz ring the alarm. Let me see you clap, spin baby, come on. Switch. [chorus]. Oh, you just gonna stand there, huh. What you too cute to dance, or you scared. It ain't really that hard to do and. I aint trying to be in love with you and. All I wanted was a moment or two to. See if you could do that switch-a-roo and. Shut your mouth fool, get your crew and. The thick body and the rear one too and. I'll be right hear waiting on you to. See if y'all can do that switch-a-roo. Hey, hey. That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama. That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama. That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama. That's what I'm talking bout, switch. [chorus]"
takin' it to the top,"Now I'm the Fresh Prince, and if you got good sense. You'll keep your distance, because my sole intent. Is to rock and shock the spot and give my all, which is a lot. And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm taking it to the top. A whole lot of people rap, but what good is that. If the rap that they're rapping is way off track?. I don't mean to attack you, but I'm cutting no slack. To those people that I hear saying meaningless raps. In actuality, I mean in reality. The words that you use are a mere formality. Vocabulary is not what it's about. The point that you're trying to get across is what counts. Cause when a lot of rappers rap, they try to use big words. But that's the most absurd thing I've ever heard of. They think that that's impressive, but when will they learn their lesson. That it's not the words that count, it's the message. They get a lot of big words out of some magazine. And nine times out of ten they don't even know what they mean. They stand up on the stage, huffing and puffin. Rappin for nearly an hour, but they're not sayin nothin. Really but a lot of jibberish. And I know that they all wish. They had access to fresh rhymes like this. I came to rock and shock and give my all, which is a lot. And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm takin it to the top. Fresh rhymes and a razzamatazz. Smooth power and grace and mucho pizzazz. Good looks and charm and personality. You punch it in your calculator, and it adds up to me. I know the same goes for the rest of my crew. My D.J Jazzy Jeff and Ready Rock C too. The ultimate combination of strength and prestige. My crew holds the key to fun and everything you need. To party all night, yes, it's you we will excite. The time is right, so don't fight it Suckers, please don't bite it. We came to rock and shock and give our all, which is a lot. And no, we're not about to stop because we're takin it to the top. I really hate to brag about him. But when people doubt him I have to stand up and tell the whole world all about him. 'United we stand, divided we fall'. Is the moto of our crew and it is honored by all of us,. We pledge allegiance to the work we rehearse. And it enables us always to come out first. We came to rock and shock and give our all, which is a lot. Yo, Jeff, man, why don't you take it to the top?. We succeed every time we attempt. To rock the house, you've got to dance cause no one is exempt. From the rules set forth by us, of course you know. Stay out our way or behold the brute force of Me Jeff and Ready Rock C,. We're a trio, oh, you didn't know?. That means That there's three of us, one for all and all for one. And we're taking it to the top before we get done. I'm inclined to rhyme, anytime you'll find. It ain't a rapper with a mind as impressive as mine I insist on a rise and I despise a decline. On the day I descend, that's the day I resign I'm creating my trends and innovatin my rap. Why is that? I don't know, I guess I got it like that!. My personality extends beyond the realm of mediocre. My advice for life is, if you want somethin, go for it. Cause there's nothin that's beyond your grasp. Just set your mind to it, work hard, and you can have. Anything that you want, the sky is the limit. Stop lunchin around, get up and go get it. Cause I came a long way from the past till today. Now I'm never slowin down, ah-ah, no way!. I came to rock and shock and give my all, which is a lot. And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm taking it to the top."
tell me why (feat. mary j. blige),"[Intro]. - Why, why, why, why, why. Why. [Chorus]. I really wish I could explain it baby (why),. It's just the world is kinda crazy baby (why),. Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby (why),. Don't cry, dry your eyes. September 11th, I woke up about 7am, west coast time, French toast and my. Turkey bacon, taking my time, awakin', turning my Tv on. To my surprise, saw what everybody in the world saw. Me & my children, images were chillin'. My son said, ""Daddy were there people in that building?"". A cold sweat, frozen with a lump in my chest. I heard his question, couldn't bring my lips to say ""Yes"" to him. That night at my son's side, he cried & prayed. For the one's who died in the World Trade. His palms to God, seeds and qualms with God. He just kept on pressin' me, wanna know why. Then one week later our bombs were dropped. We seein' them on Cnn, they just won't stop. The infrared images of brutal attack. He said, ""Daddy now we killin' em back""; (right, right). [Chorus - (2x)]. [Bridge - Mary J. Blige:]. Mmmmm, souls are captured. Dreams are stolen, hearts are broken. Evil blatantly rewarded. Hate surrenders, Love exalted. Hope elated, negativity is shorted. Why is the bomb always getting the last word. & why did her uncle have to molest her. & why did all them cops have to be shootin' to kill. & why did all them priests have to act so ill. Tell me why did James Byrd Jr. have to be touched. Tell me why did Malcolm & Martin depart from us. Tell me why did that sniper make the little boy shoot. & why does human life always denied for loot. Tell me why did Mandela have to live in a cage. Why did my brother Sterling have to die at that age. Tell me why did Reginald Denny deserve his fate. & why the f*@k can't love seem to defeat hate. Tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat. Why did Pac & Biggie Smalls have to fall in the street. Tell me why did Jam Master Jay have to go that way. Please what am I supposed to say to my kids when they say 'Why?'. [Chorus - (2x)]. [Verse 3]. Can't explain it baby, life is just really crazy. I mean if it's world wars or the life of a little baby. We got more stores than they got rice under Buddha lazy. You live four scores & still it be driving you crazy. But for me I try to see the bright side. Sometimes it'd be like the goodness be tryin' to hide. Then try to flee, but it can't it's deep inside. Sweetie, you be the light for the others, make 'em believe in God. [Bridge - Mary J. Blige:]"
the girlie had a mustache,"(Get down). I was cruisin down the avenue early one Friday. When I saw what I thought was a lady walkin my way. I turned my back to mama can I blast. And I said hmm excuse me and she walked past. She was about five foot six or maybe six and a half. With a body like a goddess, man, this girl was bad!. Tight leather pants that fit like a drum. And two big - yeah well, she had some. Anyway from behind she was fine. But when she turned around, her mustache was bigger than mine. At first I laughed, cause yo, to me that was funny. But the laughter ceased when she said hey honey. At first I was confused, I was somewhat spell-bound. My mouth wide open and my chin on the ground. And then it hit me, like a bolt from the sky. I thought: hold up - wait - this girl is a guy. I tried to get away, I said, Well, never mind. Maybe I'll see you some other time. But then he grabbed me by my arm and told me I couldn't leave. And said, Hey boy, you look mighty cute in them jeans. This had to be the most embarrassing thing in the world. My whole neighbourhood was watching me get beat up by a girl. And when my homeboys came, they didn't let me explain. They said prince, you're a sucker, you should be ashamed. My pride was busted right along with my eye. Cause my homeboys didn't realize that this girl was a guy. And in retrospect I had to laugh. I can't believe I didn't notice that this girlie had a mustache. (get down). I remember last year, the day was October 5th. And my family went away on a weekend ski trip. And they left $100 and a note by the phone. That said don't have any company till we get home. No company I'm 18 They must be jokin!. And by 10 my crib was smokin. All of my friends with their hands in the air. Screaming (party over here party over there). The party was jammin till at least about 5. And as my friends were leaving, they were like Homes, it was live. I thought the party was over, but really was just beginning. I turned around I thought I was dreamin, I saw four women. Dressed in red leather, tight to their booties. I gestured with my index finger come here, cuties. I tried to be chill, I didn't wanna scare em. I said Hi my name's the Prince they said Hi Prince, wheres your harem. I didn't waste time, I started shooting the gift. I said Y'all the type of girls I'd like to spend some time with. I walked upstair, my adrenaline pumpin. Till one hit me in the head with a lamp or somethin. The next thing I remember is wakin up nearly dead. With another Fred Flintstone lump on my head. Of course I was mad, this type of thing can burn at you. They tied me up and they were stealin my furniture. I said Yo sweetheart, what's wrong with you. What kind of stuff is this for a nice girl like you to do?"". She turned around and smiled and laughed. And that's the way that I noticed that the girlie had a mustache. Not four girls, four guys. They were in disguise it was a set up all the time. I made a complete fool of myself that day. My parents were pullin up just as the u-haul truck was pullin away. They walked in, looked like they seen a ghost. There I was, gagged and bound and tied to the bed post. My pop walked in and asked a brilliant question. Son, where's the furniture and why is your room so messy. Obviously Sherlock Holmes had been arrived. I said What do you think, dad, maybe we were robbed. I'm tied up, nothing's in one piece. Let's discuss the facts later, mom, please call the police. I wanted to have a party, I thought I was clever. My pop told me I was on punishment forever!. And in retrospect I had to laugh. I can't believe I didn't notice that the girlie had a mustache. (get down)."
the magnificent jazzy jeff,Some DJ's are (good). Some DJ's are (fresh). Some DJ's are even (def). But here's a little sumtin about my DJ. (the magnificent). Jazzy Jeff. So bust this beat. Well it's true that I'm the reigning kick of the throne. But with all my strength I couldn't do it alone. I need a DJ like (Jazzy) to back me up. So when I'm rockin on the mic he's on the cross fade cut. Scratching and mixing mixing and scratching. Second after second it's the record he's catching. His hands are so fast that it's a medical riddle. With the turntables split and the mixer in the middle. Back and forth his hands fly with the speed of a cheetah that will puzzle your eye. Record after record he has no mercy. Cuts left cuts right then he cuts vice versa. I'm not exaggerating I said it and I meant it. I'll resent it if you say it is cut unprecedented. He's a lean mean wrecking machine. He gets respected like a king when he's on the scene. So bust a move cause you know he's def. He's my DJ. (the magnificent). Jazzy Jeff. People often ask me everytime I emcee. Why do I brag so much about my disc jockey. Well the reason that I brag and I boast the most. Is cause my DJ is the most from coast to coast. (the magnificent) Jazzy Jeff wack destroyer. Cutting up records like a samurai warrior. If your DJ's don't know who I'm talking too. (I'm talking to you). So (cut) cause in a battle you cannot win. My DJ will (tear your butt limb from limb). He's like a wanna be tank a hip hop rebel. And if you want a battle you best bring a shovel my man. So you can dig your grave cause there no way. That you could ever be saved. Cause (the DJ cuts the records). To create the sound. (the DJ cuts the records). He's the best around. (the DJ cuts the records). You know he's down. His name is Jazzy Jeff aka Jeff Townes. Commanding the cut he's always on track. He's DJ Jazzy Jeff and he's a cut in the act. So for your personal safety you should be told. That my DJ Jazzy Jeff is. (Out of control). (oh my god). Aight Jazzy we gonna do a little sumthin different right now. This is what I want you to do for me. I want you to tell all these people your name Jazzy tell em your name. (He's Jazzy Jazzy) (His name is Jeff). Now Jazzy I want you to tell all these people how many of these DJ's out there can get with you (none of them). Now make the record burp. Say excuse me. Now make the record sound like a bird. Now make it chirp. Now heres a story that should not be forgotten about the day my DJ turned into an autobot. He got struck by lightning in an electrical storm. He got on the wheels of steel and began to transform. His name is Jeff and he's the swift of the swift. The type that other DJ's do not want to have to reckon with. He's by my side as I rock the mic. All of his vigorous cuts are sure to excite you. They'll delight you you no that that's right. If you were a stick of dynamite his cuts would ignite you. The DJ on the wheels can be matched. So (check out Jazzy Jeff with a cordless scratch).

You know, all I'm asking for is 60 minutes of your time. And I can set the whole record straight. You know what I'm saying. I'm not trying to say nothing that's hard or complex. Or get you psyched with a pose or body flex. I win your loving with a paid vacation. You know I'm more into a intellectual stimulation. I make your mind feel good your body follows it. I pour loving in, your mind swallows it. I'm not dissing Prince, cause he's my friend. But boys'll be boys and men'll be men. Ladies, your battery's unstable.

Ooh, I'm scared, I'm scared."
the rain (feat. jill scott),"The little rain drops fallin' down on me. But I can't seem to feel it, feel it. Feel it coming over me. The rain gon' come through the window, pain will come. Black, white, rich, poor, it's the same old drum. Rainy days like the war, use wisdom as a weapon. Hold your head up, dry your clothes and keep steppin'. Let the children feel the rain, 'cause if they feel the rain. >From the wetness, they stand to gain. I came into the game, it felt like the middle of June. Music was warm, artists, like flowers, they bloom. Then boom, I shook the room, many felt the thunder. My time to shine, did it like summer. I wondered if the sun would shine forever. Pops said ""rain gon' come"", to him I said ""never"". Chedder in the genes, face on screens. Got a benz wit' the sheen, but what did it all mean. I earned money and burned money, credit cards smokin'. Platinumn, grammys, famous, but still broke and. Not having cash put me in check. Yo, the road to the riches is slippery when wet. Amongst the fall is where you truly find yourself. Ever since then, the rain I never felt. Deal wit' it. The little rain drops fallin' down on me. But I can't seem to feel it, feel it. Feel it coming over me. At age seventeen, the worst pain, a hurrcaine. Her first name still conjuers the rain. Vowed to never let nobody ever get me wet. Lest we forget, love is a four season concept. Many say the rain they can't stand. Never let the weather determine the man. God has a plan, from it I never ran. Follow my heart through the storm, my umbrella in hand. I'm Noah, life's my arc. forty days and forty nights, still can't take my heart. Seen the fallen man. To dope and liquor brands. The devil'll dance to make it rain. Bringing the pain. Walk through the puddles of struggle on flooded streets. Soakin' wet, but mastered the art of peace. Through grey skies, I grew wise, on bended knees I knelt. Since then, the rain I never felt. What's wit' it. The little rain drops fallin' down on me. But I can't seem to feel it, feel it. Feel it coming over me. Sometimes I sit in my room, stuff on my mind. Stress, can't rest, so I open the blinds. See kids in the streets, runnin' around. It wasn't touchin' 'em, but the rain was comin' down. I wondered how, with my mouth wide. Reminisce of the key, said I wanna go outside. In the rain, to see if the same would happen to me. 'Bout that time, God started rappin' to me. He said ""pain is the mother of change, the rain must flow. So the seeds of joy might grow. Don't be afraid, find shelter in me. The road to greatness, through the valley of adversity"". I felt the light as He proceeded to drop the gem. These little children, the world we must receive like them. I just smiled, and thanked Him for the cards He delt. And since then, the rain I never felt. What's wit' it. The little rain drops fallin' down on me. But I can't seem to feel it, feel it. Feel it coming over me"
the reverend,"Now brothers and sisters. There comes a time in your life you've got to get up and get busy. Can I get a witness?. (Yes, brother, yes!).

And then we - yo Jeff, where's my beat at?. Oh, there it is, back to the story line. The music and rhymin designed to make you have a (good time). At the party, or wherever you hear it pumpin. Get up and twist or breakdance or shake somethin. Yo man, this groove is all of that!. And it's different from anything we've done, in fact. I might even go as far as to say. This cut shines bright on the darkest day. And sometimes you really need some light. Like when your teacher or boss ain't actin right. This will quench your thirst to chill, it hits the spot. Give em a taste, yo Jeff, let the beat rock. Now Brother Jazzy. Please enlighten us with a bassline. And for all the people assembled before us. Brother Jazzy, scratch.

They said that we would decay and I say who do they. Think they're dealing with, a couple of amateurs?. I'm willin to bet to where this jam hits. At your job and at your school dance and also on the radio. Winter inside the house, summer on the patio. Let me get out of here before I lose it. But remember the motto, y'all: dance to the music. Now now. Ladies and gentlemen of the congregation. We realize you may not be in a position to get up and dance right now. So we'd like to ask of you, if you're in your car, honk your horn. Honk your horn to the rhythm. We'd like to ask, if you're behind the desk at your job. We'd like you to tap your pen and pencil to the rhythm. If you're walkin down the street. You can be a little discreet. And snap your fingers to the beat. But if you are in a position. To get up and dance. We'd like to ask you to wiggle and jiggle and everything you got. And get involved with it. This has been the Reverend signin off. Signin off. Signin off."
the things that u do,"(Intro/Chorus). It's just the things that you do (5x). The way you do the things you do. (Verse 1). 8:05, the alarm clock sound. I grab my shoe and turn the damn thing down. But now it's 9 o'clock and I still ain't up up yet. Work on time, yeah I admire the concept. You got me yearninâ€™ and I mean anticipating. Seeing you I can't wait and so not concentrate. My mind is blind of all the time, thinking of you. And the way you do things you do. (Chorus). (Verse 2). I walk in the park for a midnight rendevous. For a slow dance, romance, my motive is see through. I wanna be with you. But I ain't hiding. A wave of love and I'm gliding and ridening. Things like that when you hear me. Sayin' sort of sounds like that same old clichÃ©. Climbing the highest mountain and swimming the deepest sea. But I can't front, I want you to be want me. Cause baby when you grab me tightly. You send chills and tend to insight me. When you caress and fumble me lightly. Oh girl watch up cause she might be. Settin' yourself up the way that you tease me. Sooner or later you might have to please me. It's just something about you. The way you do things you do. (Chorus). (Verse 3). Now why oh why would an incredibly fly guy like me. Be chasing one lady. It's just something about you. The way you carry yourself when you're out you. Seem to have a sort of captivating style, I've parked the feelin'. But your whip is appealing. Since this is a subject that I brought up. I just mind as well admit that I'm caught up. It ain't the clothes that you're wearin'. Your perfume or the style that that your hair's in. It ain't your body, how slim your waist is. Your new jeans and how pretty your face is. But I feel funny when it close proximity. Make it wonder what's gettin' in to me. It's just something about you. The way you do the things you do. (Chorus). (Bridge). It's nothing that you do (2x). The way you do the things you do. (Verse 4). The mysteryâ€™s of this world I ponder. Just sittin' back let my mind wonder. What the, why the, who the, how the hell is this young lady. Drive me so crazy. Reply in thought pose like the thinker. I play you with kiss or a wink. Or a smile just to show you. It's something about you. The way you do the things you do. Come here, come here. Come on out, don't worry. You want me to chase you don't you?. Just come here, I've got you now. Sss. The way you do the things you. (Chorus). It's just the things that you do. (the way you do the things you do) (10x). (Bridge). The way (repeated several times)."
then she bit me,"Ladies and gentleman you are about to enter the twilight zone. I was in a club, one friday. A lovely lady comes walking my way. She walked up and she said hello. I said hi, my names Joe. I was lyin', so was she. She said her name was Donny,. But her shirt said Marie.. She said you get to know me,. you'll never forget me. I said why, then she bit m.. Ouch!. That didn't hurt.. Kinda creepy. but she ripped my shirt.. She poisoned me I went to sleep.. Woke up at her house,. At the back of a jeep.. A Blazer, '89. Tinted windows,. I wish it was mine.. Oh, here it is,. But where are my keys?. There they are in the ignition.. I'm at her house.. It's a Tepee.. No, it's a cabin. No a skyscrapper.. No, its an igloo.. A shack.. Forget it, I'll go around back.. It's a castle, with a moat. How I get Across...Boat.. Shooo...I hate that sound.. I went inside,. Looked right, looked left.. There she is.. Oh, no Thats Jeff.. He's invisible.. I went downstairs.. It's a loft.. No, it's a dungeon!. There she is, doing aerobics.. No, yoga.. No, karate.. (You killed my teacher). But what a body!. No, he wasn't there.. I'm tellin you I saw him. No, really I saw him. He was playing checkers.. No, Nintendo. Ok, I'm lying. There she is,. Watching T.V.. All My Children.. No, thats Cosby.. No, Speed Racer.. Shaft.. No, thats Kimba. My fault...the T.V.'s off.. There she is, what a doll.. No, that's Chucky from Child's play!. I kissed her,. And she told me this is home.... I had entered a dimension Called The Twilight Zone..... Anything can happen.. I'm rough like sandpaper,. Hard like algebra.. You should be glad that I was nice,. And I allowed ya to. Step on stage.. To kick your ryhmes off.. I tried to be nice,. But you mistook that for softness.. Now it's over' to hell with your opinion!. What I say goes from now on,. This is my dominion!. I dare any rapper to step on stage. Cause if you do you'll feel the force of my rage. I'm on a rampage psyche just kiddin. Jeff wanted to do that. But I didn't. I thought that it would make the record dumb. I guess I wasn't wrong. Mary had a little lamb. Her fleece was white as snow. And everywhere that mary went so did humpty dumpty. Jack and Jill went up a hill. To fetch a pail of water. Jack fell down,. And broke his crown. Hickory, dickory, dock. Got to use the bathroom now,. psyche, I was drafted.."
this boy is smooth,Well I was cool and sitting by the phone and waiting for. A ring with a female voice or a date or. An invitation to a nightclub for some minglin. But ahh. My phone started jinglin. Picked it up. I checked the rolex first. I call one of my regulars worst come to worst. I said hello. But the voice sounded nervous. Baby relax fp at your service. The girl spoke up and her voice sounded very nice. I met you last week at that club called the paradise. I said yeah babe I'd like to go their again. Get dressed and you better be flossy at ten. Hung up the phone and checked the mirror. Sort of like esp I could hear her. Heart beating encaged with the groove. And all I could say to myself was. Damn this boy is smooth. So I pulled up to the club at the gate where they let celebs in. Entre booted a porsche 9-11 then. Girls took a look at me and started to break. Ladies come down I've already got a date. Cruised up front and I was happy to find her. Tantalising tasty tune named tanya. I said ay yo babe lets not go in the place yet. Come on hope in I got luther in the tape deck. I kicked the gift and the girl was like silly putty. She said lets go some place and chill I said really honey. We went to the beach to take a little walk. I found out I was smoother than I thought. My hands like maverick started to wander. Left and right then wound up behind her. Face to face and chest to chest and ohh like a spindle of silk. Yo this boy is smooth. Here it is. Verse trace. Back at my place. The scene was set because I set it before I left. Girl im like a tool grab me and use me. Where do you want me by the fireplace or the jacuzi. I never slipped yo I got my grip like a handle. Turn down the lights and lit up a candle. A bottle of chilled champagne right beside me. Radio booming pumpin the isley. Maybe I'll grab her and give her a kiss. Or kick her a line on the smooth billy dee tip. Or maybe ill take her outside where the pools at. Smack it up flip it naa im too cool for that. Ahh I know what I'll do. Hold her tightly and caress for a little while. Make it gentle and slow not faster. Pause for the cause and heres a word from the master. Yo I'm the j-a-double z-jazzy. Smooth as self smooth than I have to be. knowing acknowledged recognised that that's the king of the groove. and I'm the man that blessed FP is smooth. ay yo j take me out.
time to chill,"For years I have been waiting and hesitating to make a rap record. That had the pace of a slow song, quiet storm, chillin while the fire is warm. You and your girl, with this record on your radio or stereo, I don't know. I love you so is what you'll be sayin, while this record's playin. You reminiscing and kissin your girl. Relax, lay back, unwind, cause now is time to chill. Setting the mood, by the use of this groove. Is an ingenious, perceptive, brilliant, a very clever move. Because the bassline, combined with the fresh rhyme at a slow tempo enticed passion to grow. But if it's not passion, for which you search then use the song as a massage after a hard day's work. And if it's true that music calms the savage beast. Play this cut in the jungle and put the lions to sleep. Take a deep breath, stretch, kick off your footwear. Put on the tape of this record, but beware. Caution, warning, it's your decision. There's nothin stronger that you can buy, without prescription. It's soothing, somewhat hypnotic. A rhythmic anaesthetic it's practically a narcotic. You want it we got it come get it we're widdit. Because it's all at the push of a button yo Jeff hit it. The objective of this musical extravaganza is to enlighten you stanza by stanza. Verse after verse have been precisely arranged. Rearranged and then changed until the best remained. The result being this incredible song. So for at least eight hours a day you'll have this record on. In the morning and at night in your room. And it's all through the afternoon you will be listening mentally rapped up in the cut. Some people will sit down and some will choose to get up. But whatever you choose just keep your ear to the wax. Because we got something def that other rappers lack. We haven't been able to put our fingers on what it is. But it's different and it's def and it appeals to kids and teens and adults and senior citizens too. And I'd be willing to bet that it appeals to you, too. So if you're not into rap give us a chance to change your mind and to make you dance. To this lyrical miracle this musical discovery. But yo I wanna chill for a second yo Jeff, cover me. It's like paradise, this music is nice. It makes you hot if you want it too, or twice as cold as ice. It brings love to the heart of a criminal. With this subliminal power, all the women'll flock while all the guys rocks, when it's on your box. It gained us a much bigger reputation than the White Sox. You may ask yourself are we that famous. Bust this, the Queen of Spain knows what my real name is. Our time is runnin short so I'll bid you farewell. You know this cut is so def that you have been overwhelmed. Be cool, be chill relax have no fear. I'm outta here."

trapped on the dance floor,"Your trapped on the dance floor. It's locked there's no escape. There's no eat no drink cant take a break. No seat to sit down you gotta stand up. The record on the wheel reacts like a handcuff. Your in a cage and this groove will bound you. People in the club like bars around you. The doors open up and the people are boarding. Here are the prisoners the DJ is the warden. Your mind is useless instinct takes control. Jam to techno. Groove to soul to soul. You been arrested. Now your being tested. The beat is a sex fiend, you're being molested. Stead drum kicks like pistol in spinal. You gotta dance and get round like a Rhino. The DJ cuts with a knife like a surgery. Sayin that the slice aint nice thatâ€™s purgory. The music infiltrates you mutates you. Grabs you holds you moulds you and let you. Do things you wouldn't a otherwise done. Like shake rattle roll pump twist and then some. Ain't no law here you can't protest this. Stop looking around it ain't no oasis. You can't leave till the man pulls the needle. Take that as a warning. Take heed or I'll quicken the pitch and make you dance faster. The drum is the whip, bass line is the master. The temperature's a 100 and yet you still want more. Youâ€™re a slave and your trapped on the dance floor. Oh oh I'm trapped like a. ???. I can't get out. Can't you see I'm trapped. Can't you see I'm so confused. I can't get out. Now your wondering lost in a jungle. You came in hyped up but now your humble. Bringing out sweat in your silky wet clothes. You scream for help, blend in with the ??? and hoes. You try to sit but their ain't know spaces. The floor is a desert, a party oasis. I know your on the tip for the rhyme I just did. And here's a little taste of my homeboy, El Sid. Ay a prince itâ€™s the El Sid's version. I'm a raid on the track, I'm a hip-hop surgeon. The floor is jam packed get away from the bar scene. The strum of the drum has you trapped like a sardine. You try to move no form of escape. The heat brings on sweat, stick on like tape. Party's like a ???. Girls slim and trim on the floor. Don't try to shoot for the door. This ain't the gym. The party goers every night had a scene. This mic try to respond but still trapped like in Venus. Aint a spiff or a spoof. Boy you better not goof. You about to cave in although you ain't on a roof. The rhythm track from offside's to angles. Playing the wimp fight resist â€¦ strangle. You can't escape until the DJ's fingers up. So play like a phone or coat and just hang it up. The speakers pumping out sounds and hip words. Lines between the rhythm designed to equip nerds. You better jam we don't care if you hardcore. Cause we got you trapped on the dance floor. Oh oh I'm trapped like a. ???. I can't get out. Can't you see I'm trapped. Can't you see I'm so confused. I can't get out. Oh oh I'm trapped like a. ???. I can't get out. Can't you see I'm trapped. Can't you see I'm so confused. I can't get out. Me and prince got together just to kick our lines. No trouble at the party cause we're strapped with nines. Dance floor secure, don't bother tryin to get out. You looking for the late AM this man pull red out. Nobody cause killing is mean. Got ya dancin' in the dark and dressed like Springsteen. Razzamatazz a pasazz about to rip the flesh is my man Jazz Fresh. Soon as I worked through the door. I got trapped on the dance floor. See this girlie that I never saw. She was looking raw. Came a little closer. Then I opposed her. Then I drop the fox trot so hot that I roast her. ??? planes in the damn chain. hard to explain. I did it up like I was straight outta Soul Train. Listen as I discuss this yo bust this. Like a hammer before me you cant touch this. Trapped on the floor like a vulture. Part of my culture. You may even thought I was drived to faulter. Get live like a ???jack that fives you the window main???. Add a little mic and janet you cant understand it. Cause ??? thought I was from another planet. Way of whipping and dipping. And sliding ??? of what I'm providin. Other dancers go and hide. Like Charles ???. I'm prancin. I keep the dance all night until. The party's over the party's over. Like a cowboy at a rodeo. From mister mister dosie doe. Around the dance floor. Steppin the new hardcore. I'm Jazz Fresh and I'm trapped. Oh oh I'm trapped like a. ???. I can't get out. Can't you see I'm trapped. Can't you see I'm so confused. I can't get out. Max up. to step up. just to keep this rap up. the time that he possesses the best in a contest. Jeff with his right and left like Jazz Fresh. No other than the brother the lover Jazzy Jeff. I. 'm the one dance floor at the station. ??? time around quarter to ten. times work hard. the customers scarred. your tickets to freedom. yo you ain't gonna need em. your sentence is 25 years to life. a ??? is your husband and wife. trapped behind the steel. the steel of the wheels. don't come to the party if you don't wanna know how business feels. I walk strong carry a big stick. Sell myself all packed and thick. When they sound the drum you know its time to roll. Might as well have fun there's no parol. I set a trap and caught you like a mouse. For times ahead no chance for a halfway house. Pump the bass in all sections. Prince, sid, and jazz my officers of correction. Cant' escape the floor cut the crime out. ??? wall ain't no use tryin to climb out. cause I'm running this show and it's live in here. you try to escape another five years. I got you trapped and I'm your savior. You dance real hard you might get out on good behavior. But if you don't I give you more. 'Cause DJ Jazzy Jeff got you trapped on the dance floor. Oh oh I'm trapped like a. ???. I can't get out. Can't you see I'm trapped. Can't you see I'm so confused. I can't get out. Oh oh I'm trapped like a. ???. I can't get out. Can't you see I'm trapped. Can't you see I'm so confused. I can't get out."
twinkle twinkle (i'm not a star),"I'm Not A. I'm Not A. I'm Not A. I'm Not A. ---Chorus---. I'm Not A. Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Come on y'all i ain't no. Yes you are. Up above the clouds so high. No not me I'm just a regular guy. Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Come on y'all I ain't no. Yes you are. Up above the clouds so high. No not me I'm just a regular guy. ---Chorus---. Star light star so bright. First star that I see tonight. I wish that I may, wish that I might. Rip the rhyme just right. Now you all know how the old story goes. He went from rags to riches and changed as he goes. To me that scenario doesn't apply my friend. 'Cause I'm the same guy I've always been. JJ FP one nine nine three. M-O-V-I-E TV and CD. Me and Jeff brand new on the radio. Stepped on the scene and the crowd screams, ""There they go"". What? a star that's quite an analogy. I don't think who we are should be described astrologically. Donâ€™t judge me by my car. And don't treat me any differently. ---Chorus---. Let's take a trip down memory lane. You know back before everybody knew my name. Before all the jewellery the fame and the cheers. When I was just the kid with the big old ears. West Philadelphia born and raised. That's the phrase that you hear on Mondays. But lets get a little bit deeper than fact. Back when Jeff was on the scratchback. And I was on the rap. I used to buy records at this audio store. I barely had a dime when I walked out the door. I tried to get a break but they could never seem to cut me. But now I've got the money and they wanna give me stuff free. That's somethin that I'll never understand. Yo I can afford it give the break to the next man. You say I'm a star 'cause I'm large in the land. But excuse me what I do doesn't define who I am. Shaq, Denzel, Quincy Jones what's the category?. It's folks you look up to. The thousand dollar answer is up on the board. Um who is a star. (Buzzer) Sorry no score. people be flippin when they see me around. But yo don't trip just give me a pound. Step up and say hi it don't matter who you are. Come on what you all starin' for?. ---Chorus---. Out to see a movie chillin with my millie. Actin kind of silly. In downtown Phillie. You wanna see a new flick i wanna see a classic. So we flip a coin and we settle on Jurassic. Park the only thing that counts is going to be with her. Got some popcorn for the theater. Everything goin' just fine. Then this girl from behind recognized me in the line. I turned around and I smiled and she laughed. She said how you doin can i please have your autograph?. I said ya and as she reached for her pen. Her boyfriend said he aint nobody f him. F me yo what did I do?. watch your mouth man I don't even know you. I'm a peaceful man real easy. I said look you got a problem with me. he said yeah I don't like the way you act. cars and jewellery and wavin' like you all that. I'm not sweatin you no matter who you are. I didn't ask you to homie. ---Chorus---. x2. Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. we go we go we go a little sumthin like dis like."
uuhhh,"[Kel Spencer]. (Uuhhh). Can you feel it baby?. (Take me away). Flow crazy. Make em' say. (Uuhhh). Make It hot, uh. (Take me away). Flow crazy. Make em' say. Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah). Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah). [Will Smith]. Been to the mountain top. Down to the valley. Philedelph to Cali. Y'all feel me like Harry felt Sally. Clothes exotic, flows erotic. No jewels that's for them fools who ain't got it. Rap to my own sitcom. Now I just sit calm. Watching y'all respond to my July 4th bomb (boom!). Yeah I'm a nice kid. But here's some advice kid. Don't get me hyped. I'll set it off like my wife did. Playing down a path like Sajak. Wheel of a Fortune away. Price ain't right I don't play. Find yourself in Jeopardy. The first clue. What is Will Smith?. Hot to death not you. I'm like a Porsche, you a pinto. You like a tiny figurine, I'm monumental. You're like a small get together. On your neighbor's back porch. You know just a couple of y'all. I'm a million man march. Attack of the man in black. Like Jordan playing on a train. Yo my game on track. Mad ice for my wife. No care for what it costed. Had to ease up though. Her wrist got frost bit. My style, flava, delivery, my diction. Gettin' medieval like dude in Pulp Fiction. You want some bring it. Come one, come all, come in. Watch me take they heart away like Penny. I could take 12 rappers and put em' in line. Then 12 emcees that think they can rhyme. Then 12 more brothers that still ain't signed. Then don't do nothing just watch 'em decline. Gangsta hardcore, menace to society. Raps all the same. My pen spits variety. Eclecticism is a virtue. It may not be a word. But it's definitely a virtue. Rappers approaching me all across America. Believe me you don't wanna battle like Erykah. I was in the game before publishing was an issue. You're platinum now but next year I'm gonna miss you. Mad rappers like bad actors should have no parts. Wanna be mad check the charts any of them. Oh you don't see my name. You don't see my spot. Here's a hint. Look closer to the top. [Kel Spencer]. (Uuhhh). Can you feel it baby?. (Take me away). Flow crazy. Make em' say. (Uuhhh). Make It hot, uh. (Take me away). Flow crazy. Make em' say. Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah). Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah). [Kel Spencer]. Uh, love and loyalty yo. Yo the flow spray, Vito say. I'm tryin' to live. And if I catch you out of bounds. It's cheap shots to the ribs. Love and loyalty dawg. Do it how Pac and Big did it. It's the Wild Wild East. And me keepin' me jig with it. Play no games. Thirst to heat the rhyme. Motivation cause procrastination is the thief of time. Holding a torch. I was programmed to scorch. Can't run with the big dawgs?. Then stay on the porch. These cats is craftmatic. Hand on the steering wheel. Rocks from the road dodging oncoming traffic. Man-handle rappers, dismantle rappers. Y'all lukewarm slash sweet-scented candle rappers. Any team posing a threat we defeat those. The wealthy man is the man that knows how to keep dough. As long as y'all play foul I'mma keep hittin' free throws. Crush Spanish mamis calling me Kellito. Remember Lego blocks?. All about the paper now. I use writers block to build sky scraper style. Catch rappers using the same flows everyday cause they lame. True players gotta change their uniform after the game. Y'all seen the flow. Like y'all never seen before. Don't stop for the door. Why do you think green mean gold?. Baby learn life's lessons. Scratch regression. Kel Spence the truth, the answer to all questions. Come on (Uuhhh). [Will Smith]. Damn Kel, you kind of good."
wave 'em off,"From a distance, you can witness the glow from my entourage. Gravitate towards the ambiance. see me & my men on CNN, then the birth of the inevitable hate begin. cause hate is the chld to greatness. the glue between Neo & the Smiths in the matrix, yin to the yang. It just must be, ask anybody with a Grammy or an MVP. [B SECTION]. I said stop, get out, I don't need this hate around me. All your negativity might drown me I just try to go hard, doing my job. Stop, get out - the whole world loves me cause I do what I do. & I don't like the energy coming from you Trying to play me soft, wave em off. [CHORUS]. (I just wave em off, yeah) I ain't concerned with your hatin' that don't slow down my paper makin. (wave em off, yeah) While the whole world recognize, you looking at me with your crooked eyes. (wave em off yeah) Love me, I paved the way, boys we can't behave this way come on. (wave em off, yeah)While the whole world recognize, you looking at me with your crooked eyes. Coming of age I invaded nations, on stage, I seen Haitian & Asian faces. No vacations just more locations, I go places, so chasing my vocation. So demonstrating the way to be patient with life's test, through my IRS situations. My guess is my dedication don't phase ya, a public sensation, in private you hatin'. Why? That's so last year, that's so not sexy, but I shall not let the hate stress me. I got bigger fish to fry & I could stand on my wallet, probably kiss the sky. When I close my eyes, I wish that I could change how you get pissed when I do things you can't deny. Truth is, Great do need Hate to survive, so I.... [CHORUS]. Block 'em out, ignore 'em (wave em off). Don't pay these jokers no mind (wave em off). They just all mad cause they in the coat section of the hate train & they can't get off. Still flaming boy, stand clear of the hatin' is the best defense Tryin to exceed excellence. Same way hope comes with fear, yo,. Greatness lives here, then 'hateness' lives here, Trust!.

who am i?,"[Rodney Jerkins]. Darkchild, Big Will, 2000. Bust out, shake it up now. Come on, come on. And shake it up now. Who am I?. You know, you know. Big Will, ya ready?. Come on. [Will Smith]. When I was a lad I used to dream that (one day). I'd earned the cream that make phat rocks gleam. Phat rhymes to make it seem that I was like Bill Gates. Writing lines, seal fates. Power to change the whole set. For exposure or forfeit. And with the wicked sense on how to get the picket fence. Envisioned a hot life, hot wife. Wanted a crib, well a palace like South Fork on Dallas. With lights simmer trees for the ambiance. I been up and down and high and low. Fly with dough, broke looking grimy yo. My shiny glow definitely ain't cause of my Bentley. It's something that my fam put in me. Who am I? You ask. The guy with the razzmatazz with ten duffel bags packed with pazazz. In the past cut twice by the ladies of my life. (and the wounds) stitched up by my wife. Who am I?. It's suffice to say found gold in my heart. Put the ice away. Nicer day, live foul homie it's a price to pay. Even when it's rainy still I say it's nice to day. Who am I?. That brother with the platinum plaque. With the strength to stand and say gangsta rap was whack. The fact is that when that brother rap or act. Hold position, front of the pack. Who am I?. [Tatyana Ali]. I be fully educated. Not the one to play with. And I find that some of y'all hate it. But you wanna know baby. Who am I?. I be fully educated. Not the one to play with. And I find that some of y'all hate it. But you wanna know baby. Who am I?. Baby if you really wanna know about me. I'll tell you who I am. I'll tell you I be not the one for games. But if you're right with me. I know I'll do the same. I be fully educated. Not the one to play with. And I find that some of y'all hate it. But you wanna know baby. Who am I?. I be fully educated. Not the one to play with. And I find that some of y'all hate it. But you wanna know baby. Who am I?. (L-Y-T-E). [MC Lyte]. Who am I?. You dare to ask. The same female that hailed from Brooklyn and wailed on that ass. I'm your worst nightmare, you're best wet dream. Break the bank papi cause we're coming for the cream. And while I'm in the world ain't none of y'all safe. Hold face, sell a million and you still won't equate. So who am I? It ain't hard to tell. Like staying on track cause you thinking I fell. See a lot know my face but a few know me well. Just who I am is the one to make ya gel. Who am I? The chick that keeps spittin'. Taking back all my snip that was bitten. Rewritten dangerous laison. With the shades on. Making sure the track stays on. Days on end I'll be that one true friend. That will always be around when the world falls down. I'm honest to the bone. No question, suggest. You don't wanna know. I give the truth, nothing less than. I'm sweet with a heart to fit. Smart as a whip. You feed me well but I'm still hard to get. I'm like a calculus problem hard to solve. Study me well if you wanna get involved. And even after that I'm still unpredictable. Now who am I? I'm unforgettable. [Tatyana Ali]. I be fully educated. Not the one to play with. And I find that some of y'all hate it. But you wanna know baby. Who am I?. I be fully educated. Not the one to play with. And I find that some of y'all hate it. But you wanna know baby. Who am I?. I be fully educated. Not the one to play with. And I find that some of y'all hate it. But you wanna know baby. Who am I?. I be fully educated. Not the one to play with.

who stole my car,Yo jeff whats up holmes. Yo Whats up prince. Yo whats up man. Ay wheres my car at. Wheres your car why you asking me. No I parked my car right here your standing here wheres my car. I been ere for an hour and a half I ain't seen it. Come on man stop playing jeff wheres my car at. No I'm serious man it's not in my pocket I haven't seen your car. Jeff wheres my car I parked my car right here man. I don't know!. Now a joke is a joke and fun and games are chill. But this isn't funny this is straight up ill. Now there's a limit to humour and this is gone too far. I ain't laughing no more y'all now who stole my car. I don't know man. I don't know if y'all ever had a car stolen before. But it's a real crazy feeling when you walk out the door. And you don't need a map or any kind of chart. That your standing in the spot where your car used to be parked. Now you know you parked your car their but yet you keep looking. Cause your mind didn't except yet that somebody took it. So your scratching your head and trying to get things clear and theres always some idiot who says. You sure you parked here. To call the police would be the move that's smart. But instead you keep looking where you know you didn't park. Searching for reasons like maybe tickets you owed. Something to justify that maybe it got towed. But not stolen naa never forget it. But then you ask yourself well where the hell is it. If there was a prize you'd win dummy of the year. Cause you looking somewhere else when you know you parked it here. So to never never land you find yourself strolling. And when you finally except that its stolen. You call the police and they come and say. That's the 437th car stolen today. As if that's something that he really needed to mention. Then they start asking you real dumb questions like. When's the last time that you saw it. You idiot right before they stole it. Now your mad this cop is talking to you. And somebody's in your car heading to kalamazoo. Officer fool or whoever you are can you please get off your butt and find who stole my car. I remember my first car never forget it. A candy red apple irub windows be tinted. Talk about fast like a rocket to drive. When from zero to 60 in like 5 point 5. And matching red rims but that wasn't enough. It had a ca phone for when I wanted to reach out and touch. An alpine stereo that straight up rocked. With 12 inch woofers you could hear for blocks. The first day I got it I was fronting real hard. I could hear people saying damn look at that car. I was hyped and I wanted my friends to check it out. So I went to the spot where they usually hangin out. Just my luck nobody standing outside. I really didn't feel like parking my ride. So I honked my horn but nobody was coming. I said what the heck I ran inside and left it running. I was inside for 20 seconds that's all. I found my friends and said you gotta check this out y'all. But when we came back out the car wasn't there. Man you ain't buy nothing I did I swear. My friends went inside I was mad they didn't believe me. Now I'm standing outside at the spot my car used to be. It was hard to figure out what to do all alone. But then I got it call the car phone. Fresh princes car. Yo thief bring my car back now before I bust your. Hold up wait a minute pal. Seems like you kinda forgot the keys. I thought man he's right well bring it back please. Hello listen thief don't hang up. Then luckily jeff pulled up. I told him what had happened someone's stolen my car. I said come on jeff lets get him he cant be far. We rode around for about 20 minutes. When we were just about to say forget it. When I spotted him. I said jeff go get it. We pulled up behind him and man he jetted. He was driving all wild and fast like he was getting points for the stuff that he crashed. I called him on the car phone again and I said. Of course you realise when I catch you your dead. All through philly was a high speed chasin. Dude was playing around like he thought we was racing. A hundred miles an our and he lost control. And slammed my car into a telephone pole. I ran to the car I said man you okay. He said yeah so I punched him in the face. The cops came up as if it was my fault. They say me punch dude and charged me with assault. If his neck was closer I probably would have grabbed it. He told the cops that I said he could have it. I calmed down and they got things straight. I saw half my car in seventh street the other half in eighth. I wanna just jump in the ocean. My car looked like it was a leggo explosion. Why does life have to be so hard. Don't laugh next time it could be your car.
who stole the dj,"[Jeff] Let, Let, Let's Go. [Announcer] Calling all cars, calling all cars Be on the lookout someone has stolen the D.J. Agent F.P. get on the case immediately. [Jeff] Lets, Lets Go. [Fresh Prince] I Got the call about eleven fifteen. Twelve o'clock arrived on the scene. Looked around and things were ill. The party was at a dead stand still. People sittin' around no music. The situation was somewhat confusing. But I'm a detective I knew right away what happened. Somebody stole the D.J. Who or why I had no clue. But I knew what I had to do. No eat no sleep, just work. Then walked past this fly mini-skirt. I had to dis her quick before she greeted. Come on baby I'm working, beat it. Come on I'm busy, just go away. Gotta find out who stole the D.J.. [Jeff] Lets, Lets Go. [Fresh Prince] This mystery needed to quickly be solved. Cause there were kids involved. Friday and Saturday nights had no songs. Why, because the D.J. was gone. Smiles you used to dance and sing around. Now were replaced by frowns. And it was up to me to solve the mystery. And get back the disc jockey. I found an eye witness. But his breath wreaked of chitlins. All I know is his breath did pound. Buddy forget it, just write it down. No fingerprints no clues. The only witness was the bad breath dude. It was up to me to save the day. And find out who stole the D.J.. [Jeff] Lets, Lets Go. [Fresh Prince] Through the door this dame walked in. I swear to James Bond a perfect ten. I thought to myself I'm working just forget it. Then I thought well maybe I've got a minute. So I took her down to the station. To the back room for some interrogation. Captain doesn't like it, but I must confess. I interrogate best when I'm undressed. We were in there for hours drained. To see who would break first, me or the dame. Then she broke, and her mind was my possession (Prince I love you). That wasn't the question I only wanna know one thing. I've gotta make the kids dance and sing. So tell me now cause crime don't pay baby. Who stole the D.J.. I scarrowed the city but still no clue. Lost like a cause, what should I do. Then like a bolt of ligtening it hit me. Ah, the worst villain in the city. I wasn't prepared for what was in store. He had stolen the D.J. before. You all know this ruthless foe. To his hideout (let, lets go). Tip toed up the steps. Slowly and ever so quietly I crept. But out of nowhere I was attacked. Just like in the movies, clubbed from the back. I felt like a fool (man, you need to go back to private eye school). I was the dunce of the day. There I was tied up with the D.J.. [Jeff] Let's Go. [Fresh Prince] There we were both tied to a pole I told the D.J. relax its under control. (Relax man, we both goin' down you can't even keep yourself untied). Do you want to be free or not I'm gonna get us out of this tight spot. I planned this all along cap. There a knife in my swiss army hat. With the blade I cut the rope (Man your secret services spy hats dope). I radio'd for back up cars. So we could put this crook behind bars. Another criminal off the streets. Another D.J. back to his beats. I walked in the club and I was happy to say. Ladies and gentlemen, here's your D.J.. [Jeff] Let's Go. Announcer] Calling all cars, calling all cars Be on the lookout, (let, lets go) Someone has stolen another D.J. Calling private eye Fresh Prince Be on the lookout (let, lets go) Someone has stolen another D.J. Get on the case immediately. [Jeff] Lets Go, Lets Go, Lets Go, Lets Go."

you got it (donut),"Hello?. Yeah, I talked to him. Whoa, whoa... Nah, you ain't got to explain nothin to me. See, you tried to play my man and end up playin yourself. Later for you. Nah, matter of fact later for you. And your golddiggin girlfriend you put me down with). (Thought I was a donut). (Tried to glaze me). (Thought I was a donut). (Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me). This story that I'm about to tell ya. Is all about this girl named Delia. Five foot seven a Gucci queen. With gold all over that flowed like a stream. I met her in a club on a Saturday night. The girl's jeans were tight and I got hype. I thought about talkin to this little miss. But I kept seen guy after guy gettin dissed. Every guy that cracked got flagged. But somethin kept sayin (you) (you) (you bad). I walked up and asked the girl to take a ride. I whispered in her ear, said, ""My car's outside"". At first she laughed and said, ""Nah, not yet"". Then I told her it's a 'Vette and she said ""bet"". ""Under one condition: you gotta let me drive it"". She kissed me on the lips and I said (you got it). (You got it). Oh what sweet music she and I made. Only I was gettin dissed while she was gettin paid. Everything that I owned, she took it. All the way down to my foodstamp booklets. I was contemplatin her bein my wife and. All she was tryin to do was siphin. Every single dime that she could extort. She was Jane the Ripper, and she couldn't be caught. My friends tried to tell me but I stood behind her. (The girl ain't nothin but a 49er). They tried to tell me but I couldn't be told. Because her beauty was a shovel that was diggin for gold. Diamonds and furs, I spent all I had. And took her shoppin every day at Sack's 5th ave. Visa, Mastercard and even Discover. She told me this is the way that I can show her I love her. My friends tried talkin to me, they tried stoppin me. (If she had a gun they'd arrest her for robbery!). I knew she was playin me for every dime. But I loved when people said (Homes, your girl is fine). But then one day, yo, I got wise. I found out she was messin with a couple of guys. She told me that she loved me but I guess she forgot it. Oh, you wanna play hardball, huh (You got it). (You got it). The final night that I caught this girlie. I was out of town and I came home early. I caught her in a club kissin some guy Fred. Stormed up right behind her, grabbed her and I said. Yo Delia What's up baby. Come on you got to be crazy. That's your cousin you think I'm a nut. What kinda cousin would you let put his hand on your butt. Na girl, you done got out of hand. And it's about to seem like I'm the repo man. You vacuumed all of my funds like a rug. But you stretched the cord too far you pulled the plug. Let's what come on it's too late to talk. It's like monopoly and I bought you the Boardwalk. But tomorrow you'll wake up and take a look. And think the stockmarket crashed on your pocketbook. But it's over now I want everything. All the way from Louis Vuiton bags to earrings. Especially the solid gold earring noodles. And the diamond watch, the whole kit and kaboodle. Don't tell me I'm trippin. Oh, you got amnesia now you're forgettin. Who did what for who I gave my all to you. I can't seem to see why you did wrong to me. I finally figured out what you're about. But it's the bottom of the ninth two strikes and two outs. You can go make a sucker of another fellow. It's 12:01 let's give it up Cinderella. I ain't goin for it, stop cryin. Like Ms. Melody said I ain't buyin it. Game over girl you finished clockin. You wanted your walking papers (You got it). (You got it). (Thought I was a donut). (Tried to glaze me)."
you saw my blinker,"This is a story I'll never forget. About the day my new car got hit. It caught me off guard cause it happened so quick. When I heard the crash I got mad as hell. Cruising down the highway fast not slow. Ninety miles an hour in my five point o. People waving at me cause they know who I am. Alpine stereo blasting a jam. Put the top down said my girlfriend. Then my damn hat blew off in the wind. I got kind of mad cause it's the hat I just bought. I should of put her out it was all her fault. Day was Friday date was the tenth. My girl was looking good on her strength. She smacked my hand when I put it on her knee. I said hit me again and I'll break your wrist. That day I dressed all in white. Taking my girl to Palm Springs for the night. I was hoping I could find a short cut. I was tired plus I had a rash on my butt. There was this lady in a pinto coup. About ninety years old I could tell by the droop. Driving all fast border line insane. Glasses so thick couldn't stay in her lane. I swerved left and I swerved right. But she was still tale gating me too damn tight. To the left lane I tried to switch then. You saw my blinker bitch. We both pulled off on the side of the road. I was hot ready to explode. The only thing stopping me from breaking her nose. Was I was 21 and she was ninety years old. Then the police came turned the lights off. The lady started crying and the cop got soft. The cop said oh it'll be okay. Wrinkled old bag looking like a sharpe. I said wait what's going on cap. Her cars fine my cars all wrecked. Then I saw what happened in the crash. Her dentures came out got stuck in the dash. You hit me I didn't hit you. Stop holding your neck lady you can't sue. It's your fault you caused all this. You saw my blinker bitch. Wednesday, October the fourth. That's when we got our day in court. That lady destroyed my case. When she came in a wheelchair and a neck brace. I jumped up I said you must be joking. Come on judge her neck ain't broken. Well I'll be damned. Wrinkled old bag started crying on the stand. The bailiff grabbed me slammed me on the ground. Judge said boy you better come down. Aren't you one of them damn rap singers. Yeah, then I gave him the finger. Judge held me contempt of court. For giving him the finger and things of that sort. Anything to say before you're dismissed. Just one you saw my blinker bitch."
