always look a man in the eyes,"If we was owned by the white folks it will be all good. But we independent black owned and making scrilla. We a threat to society. They ban our movies our videos but we still #1 in America. You see a coward can talk shit behind a nigga back. But only a man can tell you what's on his mind. when he look you in the eyes. In other words don't judge a book by its cover. -See we successful black businessmen. but we also mercenary soldiers. (Chorus). Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him. Even if he's a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer. (My pops say). Verse 1 (Master P). I sell stones out, I'm breaking them got damn phones up. Niggas they popping them keys, Master P he fucking ??. Besides them g's, I'm ?? them keys but they didn't know. That I could go gold. platinum and still slang keys out the record store. This caine got me sick. These niggas they talking that shit. Don't make me load this M16 and split your fucking shit. I caught the game from some old g's. Niggas they slanging they fucking keys. Got the game from New Orleans. Now the world know of me. I'm down south hustling from the west. To the east, in the midwest yeah ya'll niggas know of me. Trying to slang this ghetto dope to the world. Every woman, man and boy wrap these cd's up like furls. On the corner posted up with them ballers. Slanging that yella, niggas ya'll can't hold us. Gone for 15/5 when you see me its no drought. I'm the nigga on the corner with the fucking gold in my mouth. Got every fucking club bout it bout it. Got every nigga that you see rowdy rowdy. Cause I'm down here hustling putting the ghetto on the map. Independent, black owned and ain't scared to bust no caps. (Chorus x3). Verse 2 (Mystikal). Nigga tell me what you gone do. its just me and you, you and I. Scrap and scuffle then grab them things mano a mano. If we did the mix. flury gone smother it leave your ass studdering. Fludging. tell your fucking boys don't move. cause like a rug I got them covered. Niggas ain't like they used to be. back in the days they were playing the dozens. These days niggas will kill ya. Talking shit, say it to the end of my muzzle. We don't want no trouble, black just as subtle. Tell you what you gone fuck around and find. if you disrespect my hustle. None of you niggas fuckers, young niggas fuckable. Some niggas ??, dumb niggas suffer. Before you can even think about making a move I'm already on it. I'll have to beat your ass to the punch cause the stong survive only. Hold on bitch this shit bout to hit the ceiling. The interference started from the ground up the building. Behind mine's I just don't give a fuck. Ain't no closing my eyes. I'm gone look in your face and tear your ass up. (Chorus x3). Verse 3 (Silkk). Aaahh its murder. Do or die, killed or be killed. Nigga who am I. Silkk the Shocker, do or die for a mil. Don't you see I be counting money like a machine. No how I'm saying I got to buy my green. For every fiend equals money like ching ching. My dream, know what I'm saying, got to get the cream or triple beam. By it for 15/5 and I sell it for 18. You know what I'm saying, you know what a nigga like known for. Nigga kill himself before he caught the bad one,. you know what we known for. And its all good in the hood, but I still stay strapped. Keep my hands on my 45 cause these days niggas will try to straight jack. And you know how I'm saying, 4 g's and I run it. Never seen a nigga retire from the dope game, until I done it. And its cool I gotta reach eight digits. Any nigga in my way I gots to kill him. Got a look a man in the eye before you drill him. (Chorus)"
13 years,"19 nigga 7, bitch what's happenin?. Chorus:. Thirteen muthafuckin years!. I know what to do to knock your stupid ass. so bad you ain't no challenge.. Thirteen muthafuckin years!. This ain't no fluke, this pure deep talent.. Thirteen muthafuckin years!. I know what to do to knock your stupid ass. so bad you ain't no challenge.. Thirteen muthafuckin years!. [Verse 1]. Bow, when I hold the microphone and hold it. Keepin me rappin until I hoarse and swollen. Thirteen years and rollin. I rate colder than coldest. Gettin part of this, niggas don't want no more of this. Never leave you alone in your life, nigga I'm selectin and sellin rhymes. Slap a nigga that style sound some like mine. Mad enough you screamin ""It AIN'T!"". (This line whispered, can't hear). You be pissin me off some the time, take you down one at a time. I'ma be known for fuckin over your whole album. Who want my rhyme?. Keep decling, I'ma keep climbing. Keep duckin, I'ma keep buckin. Keepin heat seekin rhymes comin to get you bitches off me. Disrespectors cow sled, (..?..). Hard to break, if it comes that way. It took me thirteen muthafuckin years just to make a tape. But that don't mean that my rhymes one of the strongest. All I know I been tryin to make it for the fuckin longest. Fuck the side of all this, long as you done it. When I done it, gettin blunted bout to run this bitch. Takin them riders down with me, clown with me. Leave thirteen in your muthafuckin chest and you can count em. Chorus. [Verse 2]. Nigga go pass the vibe, dividin mad this year. Creative catastrophy, leave MCs in closed caskets. Hit ya like full metal jackets, cut like hatchets. Tight as ratchets, and burn like matches. Thick than amino acids, flip like gymnastics, nasty as a pissy mattress. Droppin like the temperature in December. Clippin em, tippin em, been writin raps far back as I can remember. Fulla them rocks, everybody move key. It was ghetto Djs and sucka MCs. Handle your buisness in this industry of competition. Or be at F.W. Bulls washin dishes. Bitch I was born to write million dollar rhymes. Battle in the hallways of Cohen back in 85. 86, 87, 88, hooked up with Big Boy records and made my first demo tape. We dropped some real shit in the basement. I had big ol' nigga tracks, raps like pavement. To come from New Orleans made it hard to surface. That's when I got discouraged and joined the service. Pissed of and I (?) before long. I went to war and served federal time before I made it back home. No more rips in my jeans and gettin my cream. Ain't shit unlucky about my number thirteen. Chorus. [Verse 3]. I hit the bitch like BOSH! Owwwwww!. Never gon bounce could rap and doin time before I bow. How in the fuck you like me right now. Told your ass she had said I'd be on top of the pile. Cause my rap style is my hustle. I shot niggas up like Muslims. With the flex like muscle. Use a, pretty delievery cause it's most important. I form a style sharp enough to cut straight through the bones. I came from my welts, gave up my belt. I got off from Big Boy records to put my single on the shelf, now. Do I do it? Fuckin right I did it. Shoulda seen the little chir'en in the street singin I'm Not That Nigga. Size ain't nothin nigga, I'm short. Shockin nigga, raah!. They gave me five hundred dollars, shit I quit both of my jobs. Fuck em, got some other shit to do from nine to five. My birthday came, and my sister died. But next year, Mystikal signed a half a million dollar deal with Jive. This shit thats tragic can't be no more. Because of my rings I work at A&P no more. I drive my landcruiser off the show floor. Got the time to time to feel pain, sittin on Volvos. Comin with scheme, up in my dream. Who'd a ever thought I'd be a No Limit soldier. by the end of that thirteen. Thirteen manic muthfuckin years!."
ain't gonna see tomorrow,"[Mystikal]. Listen!...Listen!...huh...Listen!. Government got it where u can't do shit no mo'. The water ain't no good, the grass don't grow. Never mention schools ain't safe no mo'. killing in the 1st grade six years old. Ask yo self this, In what kind of world is that to raise yo children. Then again it really don't matter, where you gone go,. you still gotta live it. Let's face reality, stop talking bout peace that's a thing of the past. But then again that's a bald face lie,. cause a few years ago you was hanging my ass. ??? no presidents, sometimes the whole world just pressed up against me. Think about it, young black man, come up set up for penitentary. Do the math, all on you, choose yo path, be a leader, pray for strength. Know when to cap and when to blast. Get back on track, we damn near got past crack, then every dope dealer got. snatched back, we all wit the black on black. That's sad, Is it really in our nature what make it so bad. But I ain't no better then the rest of ya'll,. plus I came up in a house wit out no dad. I knew that you left, ??? ??? you didn't won't to. But that how it is, Lord help us, You know what we going through. Hook:. It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands, that's why I'm praying to God. Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water.

I know some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow. [Mystikal]. Somebody tell me what you get in a relationship. with nothing but silence, silence. We ain't married so we can't get divorced. so the only thing left is domesticated violence. When a man uses a woman to take out his problems. He abuses that woman, then man must recognize his assignment. We got two kids and you pregnant again so how can we profit. That's BULLSHIT! That ain't no reason to pull her arm out the socket. Baby I'm so sorry, you know that I luv you and didn't wanna hurt you. When I put my hands on ya, I was wrong so I don't deserve ya. I never thought I'd see the day when they scrap a nigga. when they talk about 'em on the t.v.. Now my sister flipping in the grave,. cause that's a cheap ??? and I know this can't be me. Lord help her forgive me, God give me my purpose. Jesus break this chains, you know this a vintage circle. But I got my trust in you,. I know there will be light at the end of the tunnel. I done been in many situations, she was there each and everyone of 'em. Keep me humble, I wanna take time out write down and thank ya, thank ya. Trying to make it wit out you is something we can't do. Hook:. It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands, that's why I'm praying to God. Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water.

I know some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow. [Mystikal]. Lord tell them you difference. between having eternal life or forever burn, burn. Lord tell em you was wit me when I had my accident. and my truck started flipping and turnin',. When it feel like I was dying from the moment of impact,. we rolled ten times. I was down on my best, that fool came on my side of the line. But when the truck did finally stop moving I was just fine. My little brother that was on the passenger said must of got hurt. cause he was unconscious. We done had our tradegy's, we was just talking so this can't be happenin'. But before I could say anything else,. I saw the helicopter and the ambulance. My little brother came back through, first thing he said was,. ""What is going on"". But the next thing he said was, ""watch over me lord and keep me strong"". And right then and there, I knew every thing was gone be alright. But we ain't promised nothing. So thank you my lord for saving his life. Hook: 2x until fade. It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands, that's why I'm praying to God. Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water. It's your world, but we yo children yo son's and yo daughters. We struggling trying to get it together, but some of us ain't gonna see. tommorrow...some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow,.

This caine got me sick. These niggas they talking that shit. Don't make me load this M16 and split your fucking shit. I caught the game from some old g's. Niggas they slanging they fucking keys. Got the game from New Orleans. Now the world know of me. I'm down south hustling from the west. To the east, in the midwest yeah ya'll niggas know of me. Trying to slang this ghetto dope to the world. Every woman, man and boy wrap these cd's up like furls. On the corner posted up with them ballers. Slanging that yella, niggas ya'll can't hold us. Gone for 15/5 when you see me its no drought. I'm the nigga on the corner with the fucking gold in my mouth. Got every fucking club bout it bout it. Got every nigga that you see rowdy rowdy. Cause I'm down here hustling putting the ghetto on the map. Independent, black owned and ain't scared to bust no caps. (Chorus x3). Verse 2 (Mystikal). Nigga tell me what you gone do. its just me and you, you and I. Scrap and scuffle then grab them things mano a mano. If we did the mix. flury gone smother it leave your ass studdering. Fludging. tell your fucking boys don't move. cause like a rug I got them covered. Niggas ain't like they used to be. back in the days they were playing the dozens. These days niggas will kill ya. Talking shit, say it to the end of my muzzle. We don't want no trouble, black just as subtle. Tell you what you gone fuck around and find. if you disrespect my hustle. None of you niggas fuckers, young niggas fuckable. Some niggas ??, dumb niggas suffer. Before you can even think about making a move I'm already on it. I'll have to beat your ass to the punch cause the stong survive only. Hold on bitch this shit bout to hit the ceiling. The interference started from the ground up the building. Behind mine's I just don't give a fuck. Ain't no closing my eyes. I'm gone look in your face and tear your ass up. (Chorus x3). Verse 3 (Silkk). Aaahh its murder. Do or die, killed or be killed. Nigga who am I. Silkk the Shocker, do or die for a mil. Don't you see I be counting money like a machine. No how I'm saying I got to buy my green. For every fiend equals money like ching ching. My dream, know what I'm saying, got to get the cream or triple beam. By it for 15/5 and I sell it for 18. You know what I'm saying, you know what a nigga like known for. Nigga kill himself before he caught the bad one,. you know what we known for. And its all good in the hood, but I still stay strapped. Keep my hands on my 45 cause these days niggas will try to straight jack. And you know how I'm saying, 4 g's and I run it. Never seen a nigga retire from the dope game, until I done it. And its cool I gotta reach eight digits. Any nigga in my way I gots to kill him. Got a look a man in the eye before you drill him. (Chorus)"

big truck driver,"[Mystikal]. Whaaa, wassup nigga?. This for my niggas in them Big Trucks. This for all my niggas in them SUV's, you heard me?. This for my Big Truck Drivers, look nigga blow yo' Big Truck Horn. You still could see me in my Big Truck boy. Smilin' like a lil' kid when I sped the corner with my brand new toy. I got a bark in they call, talkin' 'bout. they wishin' I'd would've came out the garage. But, I guess that's too bad. Cause your truck used to be the shit until they saw mine pass. Strobe lights flash, solar baric *boom boom*. Big feet ten runnin' while they *vroom vroom*. Another SUV can't do nothin' wit' me. I'm 23's so 22's ain't fuckin' with me. Car so big it make it hard to turn the wheel. I can't watch the T.V.'s from the sturrin-wheel. Shit, plush stronger than the buckskin ceiling. Chocolate tan interior really big truck grill. Yeah, that's how you do that there. Got bling and bass, everything clean but the ash-tray. [Hook: Byou2ful] (Mystikal). I'm lookin' at you behind the wheel. singin' this song (I'm a Big Truck Driver). In the big ol' truck, with the big ol' grill. rollin' on big ol' chrome (I'm a Big Truck Driver). And you know when you pass those small trucks you doin' them wrong. (This is for my riders Big Truck Drivers. Even on a bad day everything clean but the ash-tray). [Mystika]. Dark lights with brights, the dark windows. with the pistols in the hot spots fuckin' well right. So when you bitches try to act hype. I get the gat get the gat cause niggas don't fight. When you get to Ruby Tuesday's then make a right at the light. And you might catch my rims will-millin' 'round night light. I played a Jag' 'round rags, and now Excursion and Escalade 'round upscale. The Range Rove's don't even get used. Til it's time for Rhythm City or either House of Blues. My niggas wit' me at your seat to pick my friends up. My brother 'rice in a mother-fucking Benz' truck. Fresh light don't need no buffin'. Just call a homie where I'm at, west coast custom. Put it on a trailer and ain't no rushin'. Cause when I get it back y'all 'round can't touch it. [Hook]. [Mystikal]. Ain't no slack in my mack, rollin' slow the windows down. they recognize me so you know how they act. Cuttin' up fallin' out tryin' to flirt and get nasty. Raisin' shirt showin' titties talkin' 'bout autohgraphs. I try my best to keep my fans happy. I sign my name I grab the nipple they pull off and start laughin'. Then it's back through the hood, tryin' to find somethin' good. And after that I'm on my way to Baton Rouge. I knew that I'm on course at all time. And I love grindin' like alcoholics love sweet creamy and wine. 2002 and you dodgin' me now. Big Truck gonna come up ain't no holdin' us down. Grab eyes, turn heads, stop traffic. My black Big Truck half match my Big Truck jacket. Do shows and get paid when I travel stay busy it be gone. Now this a Big Truck Driver. [Hook 2x]. [Mystikal]. I'm a Big Truck Driver, I'm a Big Truck Driver. This is for my riders Big Truck Drivers. Even on a bad day everything clean but the ash-tray."
born to be a soldier,"(Intro [Master P]). What's up niggas and bitches.. It's the muthafuckin kisarme.. It's No Limit, Master P.. Im'a introduce y'all to the muthafuckin,. one of the hardest liuetenants on the tank, Mystikal.. We was all born to be soldiers.. See, these evil thoughts,. they was scarred into our muthafuckin souls from these wars,. the streets, the ghetto, the hood. The ghetto.. Chorus: X 7. [Master P]. Bitch, I'm a soldier!. [Mystikal]. I was born to be a soldier!. [Mystikal]. Ah, ATTEN!. Hoo! Muthafuckas don't you move. I got what is takes to make your ass feel (?). You don't wanna rest in this parade. No Limit soldiers throwin grenades!. Strictly, heavy artillery, calm and gunnin. I got your ground troops runnin from INCOMING!. Go, go go go, the future caliber. Bout to rip your (?) vest, split your capita. The niggas be marchin in the land camp. Bitch we ghetto soldiers, the streets is what made us!. No LVE's, no MRE's. But we kill our enemies, and drive humvees!. Chorus X 5. [Master P]. Born, to be, a muthafuckin soldier. The colonel don't play, I'm out that tank. Money in the bank, make niggas thank. At ease when we rank, salute cause we cap. Fools run they trap, soldiers bust caps. Fools die a million deaths, solider dies once. Put that on my gold keys, my gat, and my blunt. Candy painted hummer, triple gold D's. We bout it, eyes on our CREAM cause we rowdy. Battle kicked advil, niggas load they carriages. Weapons on the mayor of the cash cause I know character. I'm ready to bust keys, niggas (?). Niggas are fuckin, slanging them trees. They gon die in New Orleans. Chorus X 4. [Silkk]. I came out the muthafuckin womb, niggas wanna combat tank. My ghetto antics, my ghetto tactics. I smack quick, stick another gat nigga to your ass and acrobatic. Nigga what? Black, my M-16, is black bitch. I was born to drop phat shit. Punk your ass like a sac bitch. Yeah, I keep a gat bitch (?) I react quick. Blow them soldiers, told ya, and that's it. But see, I set my shit off like a punt (Go, T, Go). We roll, I said we roll like a muthafuckin blunt. See, don't come stunt and don't try to front. I'm Silkk the Shocker, I snatch your ass like a muthafuckin duck. I put on my camoflauge nigga, straight up my fuckin boot. Why would a muthafucka who ain't TRU laugh at old shoot. About face, salute!. Tell I'ma soldier, by the way I talk. Tell I'ma soldier, by the way I march (Right, left, left). I was born to be a soldier!. Chorus X 4. [Fiend]. Bringin bags and weed. Lil Fiend live by the soldiers creed. Of broken no seed in the botton pockets of my fatigues. War fatigues, playing live chess games with the chain. (?) at the gun range, cause I'll bring pain. When I'm playing survival games, that's why I sport a vest. But niggas are put to rest, but got them right tatted on my chest. I was best on my recon, started harm and dis. The war from this, is that Fiend was born from this. Scarred from this, so all the armies now go hide. Cause the crime design, stay from nine to five. Enemies retire, and the bigger go up, till my gun show up. No Limit soldiers, the world blow up!. Chorus X 3. [Mac]. Assassin, soldier, sniper, murderer. Son of a bitch, arsonist, house burglarer. Been there, done most before the sun rose. We changin clothes, when the po po's chase. Narrow with the bass, got them hoes all in my face. And them fake niggas hate, so I started different ways. And even when I'm dead and gone. My legacy'll live on. Tatoo me on your arm and tell niggas he got his rhyme on. Murder murder kill killin and shit that I spit. For lunatics who be feelin this shit. Put the gat in my face, I never squeal, nigga keep it real. Pops gave me the game, bout to bag a feel. We attack like the Men in Black. You react, if you got a gat. I'll never die, camoflauge in my vein. I'll never change in the purple rain. My name manifest pain, I'm a soldier. Chorus X 8."

From the cold, hard streets of the LBC. To a duet with Mystikal and Master P. Real G's ship keys and shoot dice on their knees. And put pistols to the mouths, of their enemies. Old country ass nigga with a gold in the front. Be the same muthafucka that get your bitch ass stomped. Underestimatin hatin got you knocked out cold. Tryin to play my boy over, you was with your hoe. Them South niggas bangin off the shit that we write. Punk niggas get killed, straight on sight. No Limit ain't no gimmick. It's tragic you know, so don't be meddlin with my boy and my hoe. Lay low, hit the floor, I'm back. Yo P, take me to the streets, that's where my heart is at. You make em say Ughhhhhhh!. I make em say beeyatch. Together we can flip the script and get grip. You got the crack, I got the bud sack. Mystikal, smack, you got the strap. Deep in that gangsta shit on a night like that. You blast me, I blast you back, beeyatch!. Chorus: X 2. We bout to jump off with some gangsta shit. Gangsta shit!. We bout to hop off with some gangsta shit. Gangsta shit!.

""Niggas ain't rappin"" what you say about gangsta rappin. You get killed forever, my nigga, every day. Where you get fucked up nigga, is where you lay. Time again I tried to tell you, but you ain't wanna heard what I say. Damn leather dog bombin. Done made a mistake. We made (something is faded in the background) sound so good. Keep that gangsta shit banging up and down your hood. Cause only real gangstas get down and to the bottom. Where y'all going, that much, we'll see right through ya. I'll out hustle ya, can't put up a fight cause I out muscle ya. My really don't give a fuck attitude got ya feelin uncomfortable. I got that there, nigga you ain't saying shit.

ghetto child,"[Master P]. It's crazy out here (uhhhhhhh). Yo mama I'm tryin to keep my head strong (whats up Mystikal?). Uhhhhhh! (uhhhhhh) I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it. Uhhhhhh! I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it. [Chorus]. Uhhhhhh! This ghetto got me crazy. Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?. Uhhhhhh! I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it. Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it. I feel like a bird nigga with no wings. I'm stuck in this ghetto trying to have a little change. My homies killing up each other cause we gotta eat. And I ain't tripping cause I'm running from the police. I done seen little kids in the projects starving. I done seen more hoes messing then Marvin. See in the ghetto the sun it barely shines. But so many niggas in jail and the welfare lines. And all my life I thought Bill Clinton ran the country. Until I found out Bill Gates had all the money. And the media starting east and west coast wars. I'm from the south, where they predijuce on us all. Come out of the powdered milk and eggs don't fill us up. But why the government sold us drugs and charges to clean us up. Gave us three halves and high interest student loans. Four dollar minimum wage and section eight, we call it home. Chorus x2. [Mystikal]. It's real when you can do whatever you want to do. when you want to do it. Ain't to many niggas out there living like that. That's why the rest of you niggas aint never gone through it. How many niggas in the penn. how many niggas in the cemetary don't know why?. How many strikes y'all niggas need. How many innocent children in the ghetto got to lose thier lives?. WHY!!!! Why you gotta make your momma cry?. HUH!!!! She take you out of the street. cause that's where you gonna die. But you won't listen cause your mind is one track. and your head is hard. And your getting flipped, and your talking back. Showing your ashy act, ass straight up off the wall. Lemme talk to y'all, don't think it's too hard to fall. but that's far and all. And sore and all, it's cool when it started off. Now niggas duckin bullets like dodgeballs. Niggas got me scared to plant my seeds, fear of high's gonna grow. Living in a messed up time, a messed up court. I'm telling ya, you can't do shit no more!. It's bigger than us, it's out of our hands. that's why I'm praying to God. Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water. Cause it's your world, and we your children. your sons and your daughters. We struggling, trying to get out of the ghetto. trying to make it to mars!!!. Chorus x2. [Silkk The Shocker]. Dear mama pray for your son, hoping I can make it through this game. Wishing I can change, I've been through so much. Seen so many things, couldn't find the words to explain. The only way to avoid stress is to get high, by drinking hennessey but I. But I can't get too high, cause I gotta keep my eyes on my enemies. I've seen harder times, but there gonna be some harder days. Penetentary close, but you know what? Cemetaries aint that far away. Before I die I'm trying to make the whole world feel. like our people scared to stand there. The way we express ourself, they think that we all some killers. But look into the eyes of a ghetto child influenced by the street. Go to sleep to gunshots, wake up from the sirens of the police. See now my life aint been the same nigga, life as a thug. If I had to draw a picture of my life. I have to paint my picture in blood. Closest homie died, before he die little cousin told me this. Get you something cause cemetaries. packed full of niggas who had dreams to be rich. So keep your head up, to all my ghetto children it was hard. To tell my family one day I was gonna grow up to make millions. When I told them, they seemed to laugh at my so called dream. I like to scream when I came home from jail. When I was told best friend turned into a fiend. I aint gonna lie, my conscience aint clear, when I close my eyes. Of course you gotta realize, god forgive me, I'm just trying to survive. They cut welfare and health care, that shit gotta stop. I got a positive note, my auntie having a baby. Congratulations, she on rocks. Chorus 2X."

I made her Cavalier a Navigator, and put baby momma on a Jaguar bling. I for you and me for me. She built like a stripper I don't need to cheat. And when it's late she's always inside. Under the cover behind her cuddled up wit' her. And since we met you been the love of my life. We ain't married but we call eachother husband and wife. [Hook]. [Mystikal]. We always home and all we do is laugh together. Even watchin' T.V. takin' baths together. Went through the sunny and the nasty weather. My feelin' short so I ain't have to tell ya'.

i'm on fire,"What the fuck? Shit... It's.. HOT!. I'm steamy, sweatin, tossin and turnin. The whole house on fire, and I can't stop it from burnin. The curtains and the walls all indulged in flames. I yell, ""Somebody help me!"" But ain't nobody pay em. I try my best to put it out then I said, ""Fukkit!"". Break, full speed to the back door, one room away. But the faster and harder I ran it seemed like the longer I took. Prayin, ""Please God spare me; I don't wanna cook!"". Knew I that I did done some things that I shouldn't of. I knew I didn't come into Sunday service like I could have. But have mercy for your child, forgive me for my sins. I'm too young to die Lord, get me through this. I gotta get to the back do', gotta get to the kitchen. But they got thick black smoke comin from the kitchen. Shit, all other exits are tossed, what I'ma do?. Stay my ass here and burn or -- RUN THE FUCK THROUGH?. Already havin trouble breathin when I started to cough. But no more time to waste, I cover my face and took off!.

I hope this ain't my calling y'all cause I ain't ready. I'ma need some alerted emergency units to stand by, paramedics. Runnin through the fire, and I can't turn back.

But that ain't my stop my shoes from movin. cause outside, here I am!. I smashed through the back door like a ram. I made it! I'm still alive! I'm still the man!. Out the house but still I got fire on my clothes. So I stopped, dropped, and rolled dick rolled. Started goin wild on the ground tryin to get the flames out my shirt. Windmillin in the dirt, but nuttin didn't work!. I heard a {HORN SOUNDS} but that was just a barge. See I live right by the river -- THAT'S IT, WATER!!!. Every step I took made hot footprints in the tar. Runnin over cars to the 12th Ward wall. Get out the way cause everything I touch turn crispy. I'ma be at the riverfront, tell them people come get me!!. C-c-call them people to me, I-I-I'm on fire! (4X). Hello? Somebody get the fuckin fire off me!. HELP!. Sparks like aluminum foil, in the microwave oven. Where them fuckin people? SOMEBODY DO SOMETHIN!. Can't you see what's hap-pe-nin?. Don't you see the smoke? Can't you hear the cracklin?. Nobody wanna listen, everybody was scatterin. I grab a nigga he screamed so loud that shit was eardrum shatterin!. I said, ""Don't scream Dawg, I need your help, I'm the one on fire!"". He said, ""Nigga you 'sposed to be dead, how you still alive?"". He was right -- by now they should be embalming me. But the shit don't seem to be harming me. Damn this must have been a bad dream the whole ?. I heard them motherfuckin sirens, hollerin. I guess they finally got the people to me, they must have saw me. Huh, cause they was headed right for me. A fireman walked up, and handed me a tape. And said, ""You just been put out, the fire went away!""."
"if it ain't live, it ain't me","[Mystikal]. Why.., why why why why. Cause I keep bangin' y'all mother-fuckin ass, with this shit. If it ain't live, it aint me. Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide. I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old. I'm too hip to drip, I do it to 'em like this. I wan't-a load it up, cock back don't miss. Y'all ain't goin' believe this. Got the preacher's wife talkin' bout rock that shit!. All they do is say the mans name. You watch how many bitches start comin', it's a damn shame. They know I got the wood for 'em. If they in the hotel room and get the dick, that's good for 'em. Big pussy and it's soft dick time, bitch I got to get'cha, mm-hm, uh-huh... Tell me what you goin' do. If you got your friends with you, you could bring them ho's too. Come and turn around, let me get behind you. Move somethin' for me baby, I ain't goin' tell no body. [Hook]. If it ain't live, it aint me. Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide. I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old. If it ain't live, it aint me. Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide. I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old. I'm too hip to drip. [Mystikal]. When I'm here they got to have it. White lines so live they jump off the cabinet. It's Micheal Tyler not Black Sabbath. It's springin' hunter so watch out for the cat parrot. I'm a whole and kaniver, the hot enchilada, Big Truck driver. Hittin' hookers is a side high. Tuckin' guts stackin' paper formin' lyrics is my real job. Got my fingers and my shit tight. Got another album and contract bitch get right. Form a crowd like a fist fight. Take my time with it if it takes me sun-up to midnight. [Hook]. [Mystikal]. I'm too man to try to handle, I'm too bad and loaded too for you to hold. Too tight to out-write, too strong to out-sold, too much to out-bust. I'll talk shit and cuss, foul-dog rimp and the walk talk spit crush. The paper towels and toilet tissue, start your engine set the table. Clean your plate and wash the dishes. Can I please get a source cup. And if they don't give me my grammy, feel so sorry for your mother. And after I'm goin' get Jive. I done bust my ass, y'all ain't do y'all job. [Hook 2x]."
it yearns*,"*In case you don't know, 'It's yearn' is the same as 'it's yours'. (Intro, some guy talking). Old school niggas. (IT'S YEARN!). True hip hop niggas. Ha, ha. (IT'S YEARN!). This something y'all niggas can dance to.. [Verse 1]. LIKE THAT!. I be a black muthafucka from the 12th ward. I want some bullshit niggas (?) hittin em hard. I hit em with more (?) I make em run. I made a lot of noise with the shit I done. I give y'all a chance to roll but y'all niggas can't roll. Sit your ass down, let me show you how it go. I thought I showed you last time, when will you learn?. Watch what you ask for, nigga, IT'S YEARN!. [Verse 2]. The maniac brotha's back with another dramatic track. Crossin my path struck you like you a black cat. Maniac, abused, used, and abused. Try your luck and bring a pack for the horseshoes. You got nothin to lose, it just might help you out a bit. Shit, I doubt it. You're better off dead, goin head to head with a nigga like M-I-K-E. Your best bet's to pack your shit. Calm your head, bleedin bitch. Sucka tragic you'll never get none. You better leave cause you only get one. Chance to make a break for it. Uh huh, leave now or get the pow. Get the fuck out this area, I'ma have to bury ya. Mo thug, I draw blood. Whip that ass, leave ya face down in the mud. Militant, bitch I might be. But that's a risk you take when you fuck with me. Headlocked, yo I dirt ya like a nacho. Shit you go, bigger than G.I.Joe. You ain't know? I thought you knew. This time you can have it, it's for you. IT'S YEARN! X 3. [Verse 3]. Come on, come on. Well come away sucker fake MCs in the place. There's only one Mystikal so make no mistake. Comin straight in your face, sucker MCs I hate. Rhymes bite you in your ass like a rattlesnake. Bout your screamin no way. Bitch you won't escape. I'm like a boa 'strictor I kill, I suffocate. Hittin harder than Hitler, no slidin, no livin, no jivin. Got more niggas runnin and hiding than Batman and Robin. Takin out adversaries with rhymes I wrote. The sucker (?) I'm the antidote. I the conductor of shive rhymes. (...?....). Stretch like elastic, pure fantastic. Lift off and burnin MCs like amino acid. Nigga please don't try to battle, it's suicide. Those who have time watch me I do survive. This is only a suggestion, so ask no questions. Try and digest my rhymes bitch you get indigestion. Wrote this as a lesson so you will know. Comin hard muthafuckas this physical. Be pussy bitches in my fans I brought a dime and. Understand I'm comin strong nigga harder than He-Man. With these hands, nigga laying face down on the curb. IT'S YEARN!. [Verse 4]. Some murderer got the nerve to talk about me. Bitch I never heard of ya. That's a shame, you got the blame cause you're blind. You know my name, the M to the Y, S-T-I, the K-A-L. Rebel, ya smell, ya fell, ya tell, ya sell, hotter than hell. Soft as hell, I might as well SPELL!. I'm a big marine, M-I-K-E, you figure weaker then me. I speak uniquely, how in the fuck do you plan to beat me. Ruler of hip hop, left ya shell shocked. Scare the fuck out ya like Alfred Hitchcock. Don't wanna be bothered (..?..). I'm a rough motherfucker from the 12th ward. Never left nothin undone, breakin jaws for fun. Cocky as Paul Bunyan, have ya cryin like onion. Flyin low, a soldier born, ya chicken's choked. Explosive, bitch I'm the one that wrote this. I scream like rebel with the sword and snake. Your boss come to battle, it's not your week. I reverse my verse, I love to curse. You won't be the first muthafucker in the back of a hearse. Stomp, pop, clap, havin the last laugh. Then, I step back and grin at your dumb ass. Watch me burn, can't miss my turn. Like, do you want it?. IT'S YEARN! X 2."

The king of different, titan of screamin chantin louder than. a hundred people clappin (GO) keep them fuckin speakers crackin. Rockin it, about to ROLL. The sticker on the tag can't make it ragged.

Chorus. Verse Two:. The doctor slapped my ass, so I've been hollerin since an infant. Gotta make sure they hear me cause I wants my attention!. Disturb the class, so I stayed in detention. Couldn't whisper when I was talkin so they sent me to the office. The principal say, ""Young man what seem to be the problem?"". Said, ""I try to be quiet but I just can't seem to lower the volume"". ""Hmm, what's your name?"" -- ""Michael Tyler"". ""Perhaps you'd be interested in joining our school choir?"". Said, ""Nah that's for funny boys"". ""Either that or a suspension,"" while you roll, HERE I COME BOY. I wanna holla, but I gotta try: *clears throat*. DOE RAY MI FAH SOH! Ahh no!. That ain't gonna cut it, that ain't gonna get it. Then the teacher said, ""Maybe you can try something ath-letic"". But I'm too clumsy so I went to the band. But I made more noise honkin than I did when I was playin!. YIKES!!! That ain't workin so I'm leavin. The very next day I was in ROTC. Had no problems soundin off like I had a pair, THREE FOUR. But I just ain't like them tight ass green pants that I had to wear. All this ? made me tired, on top of that. one of my teachers wanna see my ass outside. I went downstairs to the yard. When I got there I seen my teacher with about eight fine broads. I said, ""You lookin for me? I'm the one who be talkin loud"". She said, ""Damn, nigga we need you on our cheerleadin squad"". HELL NO, never ever Trevor. Either that or a report card filled with the F letter. GO, TEAM, FIGHT, WIN. Nah this shit ain't cool, FUCK THESE TEACHERS AND THIS SCHOOL. Got a loud mouth but I don't know what to use it for. 'til they told me that they was gon' put me in the TALENT SHOW. Chorus. * lots of repetitions of YIKES!!! Y-Y-Y-YIKES!!! *."

Gang bangin, P don't mind, I feel ya. Dogg Pound crip on mine, and I kill ya. If you cross that line, it's a thin line. Between the nine millimeter and that hairline.

I can sleep with my heat, I can even sleep with a freak. I can do a lot of things, I just can't sleep with no beef. Like you can't eat with no teeth you can't rob the police. Just like you can't cook with no heat. When I get to comin, ain't no comin wet. When I get to bustin, fuck all y'all, ain't no comin back. See you shoulda known, I wasn't scared of no nigga. All Mystikal and Snoop gotta say is one thing. Talk about, let's go get em. [Chorus till fade]."
life ain't cool,"[Master P]. Woman like my momma. Ain't no woman like my momma (11X). Sharin liquor with the homies, reminiscin bout the old days. Cookin dinner in your kitchen listenin to the Bar-Kays. When I was sick, you came got me from school. When I got suspended momma, you taught me the rules. And even though, I never had a daddy. Momma took me where I need to go in a old school caddy. A single parent on welfare. And even though times were hard momma made sure the rent was there. And we couldn't fold name brands. but momma kept her kids neat, that's why we understand. And momma even rode the Greyhound. to see her little man, when he was locked down. And even though I life the STREET LIFE. Momma prayin for her baby, hope he get his mind right. It feel good to see momma on top. I told you if I make it momma you won't be forgot. Chorus: repeat 2X. [singers] Momma life ain't cool. [Master P] Ain't no woman like my momma. [singers] Tell me what would I do without you. [Master P] Ain't no woman like my momma. [Mystikal]. I thank God, for keeping you strong, but you keep me strong. Things'd be different if, momma wasn't home. Who gon' fix the grits and eggs and smoked sausage. Teach me and love me and raise me and watch me. Who gon' lift my spirits when I get sad?. Discipline me when I need a stain whip on my ass. I was seven years old when I lost dad. Trying to accept the fact but I was too young to understand. Who gon' take the slack and carry the load?. Make ends meet while in the grocery stores?. Who's the single parent to me and my big sister. that had me happy on my birthday and merry at Christmas?. Who took care of us, did everything for us?. Stood by and didn't leave, just because. we was yours, she was ours. Who was still sweet when everything went sour?. You mom!. Chorus. [Silkk the Shocker]. I couldn't imagine gettin this far, without you. Even when the bills was due, you found a way to come through. Even though we didn't have money, we seemed rich. We had each other me and my sisters and brothers, forget the other shit. You was side by side when I was sick. Early in the morning, cooking eggs and grits. You was the first one up, but you was the last one sleepin. Made sure we had somethin to eat, last one to eatin. Couldn't live our life for us so, let us know. Wanted to tell us, but you had to just, let us grow. Gettin older now, soon have to, let us go. We was goin through some things momma but you never, let it show. And I only get one of you so I, cherish the times. Didn't know how to tell you how much you meant to me. So I wrote that line. So wherever you at, I hope you doin fine. You did so much for me then, I'll do the same for you in time. Chorus. Chorus w/o Master P."

Bitches, they like my good looks. But niggas can't stand that right hook. They might look but they stay put. I done stomped more niggas than Big Foot.

You best to chill niggas,. I don't fuck with them run-of-the-mill niggas. Here's what you gonna feel nigga:. Heavy pressure from both sides, as the brain collides. I'm tellin them lip lies, I hang with hip guys. I split thighs, bitch don't ask me for shit. You get nothin, no tighter then grip ?. Fuck nigga, don't bother me and try to be, and tired of me. Walkin out the hood with more bitches number then lottery. Look, I like fuckin around, but I ain't fuckin with no fuckery. Luckily, none of you niggas in here ain't cold enough to fuck with me. Fuck niggas can't touch that, no ??, get the fuck back. Fore you find yourself achin from you ass crack to your nut sack. I run these hoe brand niggas from the back of the map. To the front of China. Just when you thought it was safe to back in the water,. I'm right behind ya. We as one must combine to never be stopped nann man. Novice, servants, fiendins, demons, devils,. Griffins, goons, raidin rebels. Women, wizards, warlocks, witches. Punk fags like bitches. Gold, platnium, silver, copper. Any kind of pussy popper gets wopped or chopped. When Mystikal hits that door, now watch. Nigga want a big cock, get popped like Hitchcock. When I rib shot, when I hip hop, that zip lock thats thick knot. Ohh, it's goin though me, got me struttin. When E.F. Hutton talks everybody listens. chorus 2x."

shine,"Michelle Elizabeth Tyler (4X). There we go right there, ok were on the air. Let's go. We grew up with showbusiness on our mind. In hope to make a big name. Thats why me and my sister was a stiff competition. Show off when company came. Nothing but little, cause I was too shy. Stupid in front of the rest of the family. SHAKE THAT ASS!. Although my sister was the one with the beautiful voice. I still had to go last. Everybody wait, now I'm a cut the fools. The nigga laughing, acting goofy. I either came in the room when everybody go bye. And do the Michael Jackson and just act stupid. But lately, me and my people ain't been havin' to many family groupin's. Or maybe, it just some times heard a sweet melody of my baby who be. You was there through the struggle. As y'all come and try to reach the big picture. I'm tellin' ya. It hurt when you plan to do something with somebody you love. When it's time to do it, they can't be with you. I'm feelin' guilty to take it there, but better since you been gone. Well no matter. Must we fix up the furniture ain't the same when you ain't home baby. I'm 'a miss you forever, forget you never. But you gonna see the world through my eyes. And live what I never saw. So if you can see me way from Heaven, over the cloud. You could be proud of your little brother, so look down and smile. hook. Shine my lady, I miss you baby. For your my baby, my love is crazy. Your my sister, I'll always miss you. No one can get ya', cause God is with ya'. Shine my lady, I miss you baby. For your my baby, my love is crazy. There's no other, it's from your brother. Your son and mother, cause we all love ya'. All the sad songs in the world. Probably couldn't express how much I miss my baby. I just thank God that I had a big sister. The 29 beautiful years that he gave her. Even the days when I misbehaved. And I knew she was gonna get that belt to pop me. I could see the aggrivation in your face. My momma said that they had to watch me. ""Michelle, if you go somewhere, take Michael with you"". Know what that meant. All up and down the house trying to find how your time gonna be spent. Cause I was too hard-headed. Everywhere you said ""Don't go"", thats where I went. Always flipping, jumping around like a jackass,. somewhere climbing a fence. Bring me my Rocking Robin, my double dutch bust. She had some song to sang for us, we had some name brands to discuss. Plus, I want to tell her I was sorry for leaving the toilet seat up. And not cleaning out the tub, and leaving peanut butter and jelly. And drinking out the Kool-Aid jar. I pissed you off, burned you up. When you told me ""Cut that music down"", I turned it up. Bickering conflict cause y'all doubt how we showed out love. You was my flesh and blood, we was brother and sister. And it meant so much. Now I'm doing it, you supposed to be here. We supposed to be righting songs together. I'm telling ya', that girl tore talent shows up. But owned Tina Marie records. What you left us with, never be in vain. You gonna be shining, and they gonna know your name. Too many damn things left unexplained. But since you was an angel down here,. then an angel there you shall remain. And thats always until my time, you're my strength, you're my life. Shine. hook."

So deadly you don't wanna rumble. That's right don't panic, Mystikal the mechanic. Sank you like a torpedo gigantic as the Titanic. Rhymes I'm hummin keep hummin. I'ma keep comin. Grabbin ya woman. But the drummer still drummin. Hard hitter, bullshitter, head splitter when bitter. Assassinate a rookie killa. Like Adolph Hitler. A mandingo WARRIOR. Opponents get crushed. I'm too cruel to be moved. Too fuckin much to be touched. Got em danglin and janglin. To that shit when they hear this. Fight me like a Viking, bitch I'm tragic like a terrorist.

Out of sight, when we unite, like killers and George. Slowly, unlock the safe on the wall. Stop disrespectin the pistol I'm pointin at y'all. Buck buck! Get down, get on your face or get handled. Bitch keep still 'fore I make an example. Cut up that fuckin remake, and give me that sample. Give me the fuckin recoup, you 'sposed to be payin me!. Bag the loot then, cover the camera. Snatch a fuckin hostage then run out with the manager. Fuck it, gotta have my paper, fortune and fame. Lay it down so the bitches won't forget my name!. {*GUN FIRES*} Listen close motherfucker. If you don't meet my demands, this nigga gon' suffer. This ain't no fucking game, and ain't none of this funny. If you want this nigga to live, then gimme your company!. * Chorus *."

No one can stop me, uncover my flow I'm Unpredictable. Man, until you give it your all, you never will know what can happen. From nappy-headed ass Michael, to cold-blooded ass rapper. Sometimes the little kids be listenin'to me. And I'm tryin' to stop the cursin'. Teachin' 'em bad words and then people be gettin' nervous (Oh my God). Calm down, I'm not that type of rapper you'll see. Besides, I know some of y'all churn out that cursin' better than me. I'm ice-cold baby, I'm zero degrees. I'm like a lumberjack, cuttin' MC's like trees. Choppin' 'em down, knocking 'em down, locking 'em down. Four years, and six months later I'm still on top of the mound. Just more powerfully now, on time for that No Limit sound. Already know what you gonna say before it come out your mouth. Yee got's to stay awake, tidin' y'all no matter whats done. Old style-stealing copycat tried to bite and bit his tounge. You can't fight that feeling, it's irresistable. Never know what I'm 'a do next, I'm Unpredictable. hook. If you thinking the nigga done rolled with a other they'll take you. Nigga you heard wrong. Prime Suspects (who?), Mia X, (who?) Mr. Serv-on. Oh, you want to ride in my Mercedes. But I ain't got no more room in the back (my bad). Whole Gambino Family in their, Kane and Abel and Mac. Got C-Murder, Colonel, the Shocker, you don't want none. Oh hell, O'Dell and VL all of the funk sons. I'm confident, don't come in conceited, ain't got no Big Ed. I'm bad like Fiend, but I B. like Craig. So don't provoke me, if you don't want to get strong-armed. Big Mann and Champ, V-Dog, be worrying might do you some harm. All that ready to put a bullet in your belly-belly. With a four-ten two shells, Boswell and Kelly-Kelly. We ain't faking, making hits and gettin' paid. You can't fade the track that the tank just made. Mystikal, I'm Unpredictable.

Matter fact's been that way since I was wearin osh kosh b'gosh. But yet y'all steadily trying to squab bout me. When I come in this door the only thing y'all can do is talk about me. Better get some business about yourself that's what you better do. Matter fact I'm a tell you mother fuckers three things I'm a never do. One : never gonna change my style. Two: never gonna bounce, three: never gonna bow. I'm gettin tired of being sick and tired. Nigga you got a problem with me gettin' high. Suck big dick and die. Same rhyme phrase get me paid, they can't fade. the tan shade man with the braids. Bitches peep as I creep through the 12th ward. I done offended these niggaz compare me. to niggaz that gotta practice looking hard. Bitch-a won't leave me alone. I'm not that Thug and I'm not that Ruggish but I do pack Bone. Black prince of the south that's my title. Bitch I'm whoo chka ckha oooooww! bad like Michael. I'm throwin rhymes at a steady flow. (Inhaling) whoo there they go y'all niggaz ain't ready yo. Chorus. Bitch I pimp hos instead of an army petty shit it don't harm me. Bitch I'm entertaining like Cedric and I'm mac like Bernie. I'm black like Menace and I'm g like Slimm. I'm Sporty like T and I'm smooth like Tim. I can click just like the boot camp but I'm conscious like daughter. Bitch I'm insane but um, you still be wantin. to claim that I'm your partner. I'm Down just like Bust plus I'm Ice just like Mike. And I'm the living lyrical miracle I'm just ice like precise. I'm the invisible man you blind you can't see shit. Picture I got more bitches on my dick than bitches at FREAKNIK."

Some niggaz just need to be warned. It's gonna be harder to get it up on a my own. nigga go ring the alarm. Matter fact better know what it take. for the back of your head to hit that grass. Let' s get this straight from the jump. I ain't playing with your bitch ass. These outside niggaz that run to the mic better come clean. Fuckin with that Saudi Arabian. Desert Storm veteran 12th ward offspring. I'm runnin these niggaz to the jets. to the hills, to the back of the tracks. A-A-ask them hos, did I do that?. I'm coming boisterous with 5 million switches. I'm the man with single and double and triple. and four five six time them bitches.

Little nigga fuck hos both sides of the river. I can't be fucked with, you can't touch this better grab hold. Bitch I'm so cold I'm like a 24 year-old north pole!.

I'm harder than a nigga watchin' Janet Jackson in draws!. But if ya catch me on the tv, or the radio spell it. M-Y-S-T-I-K-A-L y'all ain't ready though!. Chorus 2x. (Precise). So Mystikal, in your own words could you explain your style?. I gotta get a rhyme that can tumble through the air like a Rambo spear. See y'all can stop lookin at another nigga. face cause bitch the man right here. You nigga didn't think that I could swing mine. Bitch I'm doing bad and saying rhymes at the same time (I ain't lying). Talking behind my back don't make me no nevermind. Cause all you can say is I'm smarter than Einstein. I'm fire like Cayenne!. You'll never catch me cause I'm swift as a hyena. Gimme the chance I'll rock the lakefront arena. like Teena Marie be rockin Tipitina's (damn Gina). Tall dark strong long and lean ain't nobody comin cleaner. It's all in the way I lay my game down. Watch me swing with the gillotine rollin round nigga town. But everybody think these niggaz be wantin me. to prove that I'm the man. Bitch I'm colder than a freezer, cooler than a fan. I got no love for no b-i-e-otch.

yahh!,"Da da da daah. Da da da daah. MC's!. Da da da daah. Da da da daah. Yaah!. [Chorus:] X 8. Yaah! (Say what?). [Verse 1]. Break my joint, cut my tongue off if I ain't tight. Put a bullet in my head take my life and let me die if I ain't fire. Cut me up feed me to the roaches, let me rot if I don't rock. Let me go to hell, burn, sizzle and simmer if I don't deliver. Pull my hair out if I sell out. Bury me on my stomach without no drawers on at all if I don't go off. Or either lethal injection or straight electricity. Let the garbage man pick me up and get rid of me. if I lose creativity. Let me get forced into sexual activity. Let me get turned out by three skank freaks if I don't bust to. the utmost of my ability. Take my head if I say it and don't feel it. Stop selling my record, give me the money back nigga. if I don't sell at least a million. Cut my dick off if I get down and don't get off. Crush my spine and cave my chest in if I come (.?.). If I ain't bad for my age and kick ass for my size. Close my fuckin eyes if you can stop me from sayin or keep me from playin. [Chorus] X 16. [Verse 2]. Snap my pencil, dislocate my fingers and jam my thumb. I ain't gon' write no more, tear my papers, strip clothes if. it don't ship gold. Take my blessed, Baptist Holy Ghost Christian soul. If it take less than a year of playin my records and tapes. before they can say my shit old. If it don't bang, take me out the game, call me out my name. Put me out my house, beat me out my change. Let em read my poem and tell em to seal my doom. When I'm dead read bitch ass nigga in the ground. written across my tomb. Let the breeze take my leaves if my trees don't bloom. Put me in the sun and cut my air supply. if I give these niggas breathin room. If what I'm brewin ain't potent. If what I'm doin ain't rollin. Nigga, diss me, make a movie, talk about it on Oprah. Erase my fuckin vocals, burn my fuckin notebooks. Take my fuckin tank from me and give it back to Goldman. I quit, my career's over. Turn me upside down and hang me from my scrotum. Da da da daah. MC's!. Da da da daah. Da da da daah. MC's!. Da da da daah. [Chorus] X 8. [Verse 3]. Give me my post office application if I ain't hear from rap. Nothin if they ass ain't shake and they hands ain't clap. Take my happiness if it just so happens I ain't happenin. Let something happen to me if I ain't hardcore at it maximum. Flip the dial change the channel if I can't handle. Forget me if I leave this bitch. before I put my fuckin Grammy on the mantle. Let my next fifty concerts get cancelled. If I'm scared in front the camera. Then take my fuckin talent, take me from my family. Sneak me, fuck over me if I don't represent Louisiana. Jump my fence if I ain't the prince. Bitch keep me back if I can't keep up with the presidents. If I don't run circles around these other rap guys. Let my momma Benz catch four flat tires. [Chorus till fade]. That's what the fuck I'm hearin in my head. Yaah!. That's what keep me going. Yaah!. That's what make me fuck over you. Yaah!. I can't stop that voice. Yaah!."
