perfect circle / god speed,"[Intro]. Woo-ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh. [Verse 1]. (Fuck you). I came for whoever is in charge. I suggest you go and get yourself a weapon and a guard. They need some coffee, everybody's sleeping on me. Going around door to door, setting off alarms. All that horse shit, you should have left it at the barn. Keep a stallion, tell her gallop. to the store and get cigars, yeah. Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made. I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase. Me and my bizarre ways (no emergency). I moved up from a Private to a Sergeant. You can see it from a scar face. Hidden in a dark place, swimming in the shark tank. Give a bitch a little bit of change. she a game in an arcade. (Time crisis) Not a second to lose. I'm the motherfuckin' Bible, that's forever the truth. And this is not another case of the celebrity blues. The devil with me and he tell me to shoot. [Hook]. Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?. Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do. Can you draw a perfect circle?. Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options. what do you do?. I wash these pills down with liquor and fall. Leave it to me, I do enough for us all (I do). Got what you need if you like breaking the law. My mother raised me a God (Hey). (Fuck you). [Verse 2]. Yeah, blame the drugs, got me sinning on the weekday. Drunk as fuck, doing buck sixty on the freeway. Giving y'all the freebase. hidden in the middle of a briefcase. Hidden in a subwoofer, beat case. Used to wanna know how a freak taste. Now I'm in it in an instant like replay. Bras a baton, pass it off like relay. Why I'm so mad on my B-Day?. She say ""I thought you got sober"". And I say ""I wish you'd stop being a bitch. And get to minding your business"". Told me ""Money has changed you"". I get to thinking, how rarely do I visit?. How'd I get so egotistical? I'm a Buffalo Soldier. Heaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer. I'm only twenty-three but my mind is older. and it'll forever be. Dead presidents to the homies, death to my enemies. [Hook]. Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?. Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do. Can you draw a perfect circle?. Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options. what do you do?. I wash these pills down with liquor and fall. Leave it to me, I do enough for us all. Got what you need if you like breaking the law. My mother raised me a God (Hey). (Fuck you). [Bridge: Ab-Soul & Mac Miller]. A goddess told me? good morning? when I woke up. (Fuck you). You know I had a good morning when I woke up. (Fuck you). Gotta thank God every morning then I woke up. (Fuck you). Would you remember me if I never woke up?. Bye bye (Fuck you). I've been a sinner, I'm just tryna stay. Warm through winter, and I'll be on my way. I'm just a drifter, in endless seas of whispers. I just need some shelter, give me shelter from the wind. [Refrain]. Woo-ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh. Woo-ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh. [Interlude: Transition]. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice. message system 412-9?. *buttons dialed* is not available. [Miller Mccormick]. Hey man, I wish you were here, happy holidays. uhm, I love ya. And I hope you have a good night. weekend I hope I talk to you soon. alright, godspeed?. [Part 2: God Speed]. [Verse 1]. Oh yeah, I thought I'd have it figured out by now. Shit would be simple. problems would be in the past by now. Me and the homies would be sitting on millions. Reminiscing on times. when we were so broke and living in Oakland just chillin'. I thought I'd have it in the bag by now. I thought that we'd be kicking back by now. I know that life is a bitch, I know that life is a bitch. I thought we'd put her in a cab by now. But I'm stressing, I can't relax. I swallow my pride and I'm hiding what's making me mad. Everybody say I need rehab. Cause I'm speedin' with a blindfold on. and won't be long 'til they watching me crash. And they don't wanna see that. They don't want me to Od and have to talk to my mother. Telling her they could have done more to help me. and she'll be crying saying. that she'll do anything to have me back. All the nights I'm losing sleep, it was all a dream. there was a time that I believed that. But white lines be numbing them dark times. Them pills that I'm popping, I need to man up. Admit it's a problem, I need a wake up. Before one morning I don't wake up. You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya. I'm too obsessed with going down as a great one. But if you wait too long, they go find someone. to replace ya. So I guess this is a letter, to all my brothers. Most Dope, that's forever. I love you more than words could express. And this the part that Q start crying, if he ain't already yet. I did my best to be a leader you respect. At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret. So tell my baby I love her. And if she give me the chance. I'll put a seed inside her, make her a mother. Just know that there's a place. Where all my people worry free and everybody straight. Every devil don't got horns. and every hero ain't got capes. Opened up my eyes, shit, I'm finally awake. Good morning. Yeah, good morning. [Interlude: Outro]. Yo Vin, it's the morning, you gotta go to work. ""alright"". Yo, you gotta be at work in like ten minutes, yo. (You good?). ""I'm straight, yo what's good? "" (when you going?). You gotta pick up the dry cleaning and shit still?. ""man, fuck that shit, I'll skip"". You bout to go to work?. ""mm"". Ight, what time you gotta be at work?. ""I don't know"". soon?. You Democrat or Republican?. ""Uuhh""I don't know anymore?. Would you vote for a female president?. ""I don't care what gender or race you are"""
2009,"Yeah. Eric. Well. I don't need to lie no more. Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind. And she don't cry no more. She tell me that I get her high. 'Cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and. I ain't askin' why no more. Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines. It ain't 2009 no more. Yeah, I know what's behind that door.

Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me. Send you back home with a light that's beamin'. The whole team 'bout to figure it out. We ice cold, that's what winter's about. And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route. Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm. Have a ball with a dribble and bounce. 'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah. Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money. Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly. I was yea high and muddy.

Yeah they ask me what I'm smilin' for. Well, because I've never been this high before. It's like I never felt alive before. Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind and water. See me and you, we ain't that different. I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'. Take my time to finish, mind my business. A life ain't a life 'til you live it. I was diggin' me a hole big enough to bury my soul. Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own. My own, with these songs I can carry you home. I'm right here when you're scared and alone. And I ain't ever in a hurry. You don't never gotta worry. Even when it's 7: 30 and the time is runnin' low. When your heart get cold. See what's behind all them unturned stones. And I'm a pro when it comes to my job. But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God. Now when it gets hard. I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm. Because I don't need to lie no more. Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind. And she don't cry no more. She tell me that I get her high. 'Cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and. I ain't askin' why no more. Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines. It ain't 2009 no more. Yeah, I know what's behind that door. I don't need to lie no more. Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind. And she don't cry no more. She tell me that I get her high. 'Cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and. I ain't askin' why no more. Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines. It ain't 2009 no more. Yeah, I know what's behind that door"

Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed. Iller than the future death of you ingestin' Sudafed. Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest. Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress. See, this is what I do the best. Nothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest. Save hard, a Braveheart, a warrior. I take part to stay far from coroners. I heard some corny words said about my music though. Talkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho. Most Dope, got you hooked, yellin' Ruffio. First you lose your mind, then you lose your soul. So what you talkin' about? Thinkin' you're out of options. American born, impeccable form, above and beyond, Medal of Honor.

Bet I steal her. Shout out to my wigga Mac Miller. Comin' up in a world full of killers. I'll be shaded up at the villa. With a girl that know what the deal is. They don't know I come from the illest. City on a map, we don't know how to act. Agh, release young rap, go getters in America. Bad chick get tossed around like the merry go. CV and Mac meezy takin' off on PJ's. We the future so every night is a new day. Sittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low. Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show. I can trigger the wave in my sleep. Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat. Agh, wake up shower, get paid and repeat. Spit one flow and got made on the streets. Welcome to the land where you never stay for free. Swag worth a mill, drop cast let it deal, Veggies. Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split. Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public. Welcome to America, motherfucker, welcome to America. My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split. Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public. Welcome to America, motherfucker, welcome to America. [Joey Bada$$]. Bout to drop hot shit, runnin' out of patience, niggas not sick. Rollin' up the dankest loud, plane goin' mach six. Rise to the top and top a change the Glocks in the stock. Exchange that watch the price of life on the block. Drop insane, you can't stop this rain, don't name drop in vain. Inhale toxic flames from tropic strange, it's aqua strange. Last week he was nothin', boxers stain. Everybody love him and chicks offered top for fame. To the top I aim, testin' waters so up in the flow. No deal but flow so real keepin' in the scoops. Sun got shine, now he said he shady but he never dippin' though. Still facing L's you would think the niggas wins was low. What you think I'm in this for? Won't stop till the nigga who invented dope. In the flow will behind bars droppin' prison soap. Begging for forgiveness, but it's business though. I'm record spittin' Guinness flows. Got it up in sources now he in the store. . Digo Y. (:"

apparition,"I've been rappin' since the apparition. was gonna kill me and I'm glad he didn't. might have made a bad decision. he just left me with an ocean and a bad religion. while mary magdalene laughin', smokin' a pack of winstons. up on a church hill, acid trippin' with older men. as they tell her stories, she's seducin' them. but she's only usin' them. my studio is filled with spirits. and every single lyric dedicated to my dearest friends. yeah, and lord knows that we hate the questions. so back and forth, exchange faces over why I'm playin' table tennis at dinner. I end up so bitter when I lose. defeat hurts, I got scissors in my shoes. and I'm dancin'. never got the steps right. loose, I never slept tight. but I'ma keep dancin'. I did a cannonball off the deep end, my boat was comin' to america. pouch of fairy dust and a little poodle terrier. a silver derringer, a smile for the camera. split your line up like james farrior. I've always been a cowboy, they need me like the cancer cure. weed loud as crowd noise, we just let the amber burn. wiffle balls, child's toys, ain't fuckin' with amateurs. I'm ken griffey on the mariners. okay I'm way beyond the boundaries, outside of parameters. the rap chancellor, jacket made of camel fur. and clockwork got every single answer 'cept time.

aquarium,"(intro). Yeah. Do you feel it?. I don't, don't answer a rhetorical question. Rhetorical (rhetorical). (verso 1). Uh, forever life been never nice, we expedite the process. And every night I get advice, cause life is way too complex. Heaven's lights are hella bright, ironic how that came to be. But can't you see? this angel speaks. She's saying the place is safe for me. I told ""wait for me"", the make believer normally disguise. Transform before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs. The morning rises and I'm fast asleep. Somewhere off in the master suite. Having dreams of latin queens and nasty freaks. My mind, it wonders to places yonder and even farther. When I'm sleep walking I'm stephen jobs or I'm peter parker. A genius author, a jesus preaching just to feed his daughter. The weed to spark up, yeah he's a goner. Fuck these primadonnas. I'll always wonder what happened three thousand years ago. I like to toy with the idea that we really know. Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?. In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings. (refrão). I'm wearing a blindfold, like where did the time go. I know you hear me out there, give me a sign though?. I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes. Baby I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes. Take me away girl, somewhere they won't be. Hold you closely, so we don't speak. Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?. So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?. I'm just trying to make it all make sense. (verso 2). Uh, as you hypothesize on how to monetize. Take advantage of all the time we fall behind. Get lost in this aquarium. America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up. We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria. Confessions that I have and curiosity about life and death. Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest. Read about the meaning of dreaming and all its messages. Sedatives that take me to god, witness his fetishes. We all in search for substance. That gives you pain and numbness. Circumstances advance the second chances, for this beloved. I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this coming. But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrows trend. Your life, it all depends on dollars spent. And knowledge gained. Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days. Life, it works in such mysterious ways. All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say. (refrão). I'm wearing a blindfold, like where did the time go. I know you hear me out there, give me a sign though?. I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes. Baby I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes. Take me away girl, somewhere they won't be. Hold you closely, so we don't speak. Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?. So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?. I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes. Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?. I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes. I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes. Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?. Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?. I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes. I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes. Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?. Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?"

Feel like I do this in my sleep. Literally, I do this in my sleep. A little Tv money, dollars for sense of humor. Scholar but my attendance like Bueller, so no use for a tutor. Some cold brews in the cooler. Coming through in the wood grain Pt Cruiser, stunting. I'm pissed off like a blind person looking for a restroom. Probably be dead soon inhaling cigarette fumes.

I just want to see whats good for the night time. If nothings hype, ima head up to crib and write rhymes. Age like white wine, nicer by the second,. Thats why I never put punctuation on a sentence. Cuz the song goes on, here a dope song. If they say I wasnt for real, then you was told wrong. See you ain't on, what we on. You bright, I'm neon. I'm smoking up the weed till the tree gone. Yeaahh.

blunt of my mind,"Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind. See I'm one of a kind. There's a brain behind. All these different wonderful rhymes. Some people's livin in the past. Cuz they runnin from time. Seems like so long since big punisher died. Hope he see me when I'm lookin up from under the sky. I'mma tell you how it is cuz I got nothin to hide. And soul theory makes the beats that'll bump in the ride. This criminal lifestyle that I'm jumpin inside. A mastermind, superb with both sides of his brain. Roll me up into a swisher, start flyin away. But ash my soul, rub the L on the side of the tray. Cuz its hard looking up, like the sky when it rains. Smokin strains that levitate me like David Blaine. I'm a player and you hatin on my game. Say my name, cuz this here's my destiny child. Now that all the stress is off of my chest I can rest for a while. Just roll up (6x). Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind. All you haters relax. Sit back, sit back, sit back we got you feelin so fine. With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin so high. Got me feelin so, feelin so, with this blunt of my mind. And I shall not hold my tongue. So i'mma speak till I fold my gums. I was told to run. Cuz every day is a colder one. I wake up not knowing if I'm old or young. I can't find my place so I lay upon these beats. Covering my pain with layers of melodic sheets. Mother earth's a bitch so when kingdom come. We gonna bring em some till thy will be done. And still to come is when I'm finally driven to insanity. By my family, who never seemed to be a fan of me. My knees are shaken, see I'm not able to stand. Cuz they label a man by his paper in hand. Sittin in a dark alley with some paper and pens. Writin, just thinkin when this day's gonna end. What can you say to a man who can't look at himself. When the image in the mirror keeps on yellin for help. Just roll up (6x). Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind. All you haters relax. Sit back, sit back, sit back we got you feelin so fine. With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin so high. Got me feelin so, feelin so, with this blunt of my mind. Hip hop's child, you feel me do the touchin. Spittin got me smitten, no excuses for the lovin. I'm tryina get it written but I'm comin up with nothin. A couple words in each line. filled with somethin somethin somethins. And to me, hip hop ain't got a criminal past. Its just explosions of sound as these syllables clash. Briain on critical mass. Fuck political trash. These politicians speakin, but its comin out they ass. Talkin bout ""school is cool"" and ""drugs for thugs"". Tryina push me down the path, but I shall not budge. Cuz, i've been thinkin and I think I have a hunch. Who hand the mic to get enough. While me and music makin love. And my community, ain't all about who I choose to be. This life and what it do to me, the ruined opportunities. This figurative language that I'm speakin so fluently. Look back like a photo album seein who I used to be. Playin piano while I'm strummin guitar. Can't buy myself a spaceship so I'm runnin to mars. Stare at death in the face, like I'm under a car. And not everybody hatin, but enough for you all. Just roll up (6x). Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind. All you haters relax. Sit back, sit back, sit back we got you feelin so fine. With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin so high. Got me feelin so, feelin so, with this blunt of my mind"

I got the time to feel the need to run, a fool. Is what I've become, young and I'm dumb. Been spending cake to get some bump in the trunk. Drums with a pump like some Reeboks.

funeral,"I know what happens to you, me and everyone. else when they supposedly die. it's this passage around the great loop. this music go with my funeral. music go with my funeral. shit, I was raised inside this pretty city. riding through, you probably miss me. my bicycle fell, I hit the road, the mailman almost hit me. all this sins be more than shitty, I just pray the lord forgive me. doing drugs is just a war with boredom but they sure to get me. my side-bitch is sorta pretty, but she got enormous titties. know I'm worth a fortune, she just want a brand new porsche or bentley. had a few abortions, unfortunately I forced them. lord knows I turn a child to an orphan when I'm torn. I'm more than what I think of myself, I really have to be. sit at home and drink, my thoughts harassing me. actually, as a matter of fact, she ain't getting back to me. a shame that my tragedy, my masterpiece, yeah. trapped inside these dreams of mine. just trying to get some peace of mind. yea, I've been trapped inside these dreams of mine. so you'll never get a piece of mind. it's the last day of my life. party like it's the last day of your life. this the motherfucking last day of my life. party like it's the last day of your life. see we swallowed in this web of lies, never try to exercise. you used to be a fantasy but now I guess it's televised. I heard the legends never died, otis lonely hella mind [?]. there never was a better time to better myself. forever I melt and float away like waves in the ocean. staring inside of heaven's eyes - the gates will never open. I'm smoking on these field of hope, waiting till this deal gets closed. I keep getting hotter, but all I seem to feel is cold. twenty-two don't feel so old, but I think I'm 82. you mean to tell me God took 7 days and all he made was you?. I'm out here with the kangaroos, making danger, break the rules. celebrate my date of birth with acid, get the days confused. happiness I take from you, searching for the naked truth. I'm not awake, I'm in a lake, I'll swim away with you. bitch, check out the butterfly. if you the truth then what the fuck am I?. yea. so where are you going?. where are you headed?. where are you going?. can I come? Can I come?"
gees (feat. schoolboy q),"[Verse 1: Delusional Thomas]. Uh, ignorant-ass white kid. But I'm still bicycling and recycling. And I'm still eating Gummy Bear vitamins. All my bitches taking Vicodin, huffing nitrogen. [Mac Miller]. Hyper than Williams, middle son, since I was. A little one, moms had to put me on the Ritalin. Made a swisher run, crack the 40 then I lit a blunt. Told Chuck I had a couple raps, so we kicked the drums. All the best rappers are usually dead. But I'm the poison that left a widow Juliet. In the studio with candles lit and Buddha heads. Coming up with all the coldest shit, take your Sudafed. [Delusional Thomas]. Contagious, speaking while sedated. God shit, make 'em want to add. a couple pages to the Bible. I ain't got nothing left in my will. 'cept throw it all in the casket, it's mine still. [Mac Miller]. I need some backpack cast raps. Took a break just to kill the game half-ass. Set some rat traps, went to take a cat nap. Woke up, threw the dead bodies in the trash bags. Act polite, but I'm nasty on the mic. Your bitch don't want my dick, then she has to be a dyke. Slap her but she like it, tell me, ""Master, feed me pipe"". I'm the Scotch on the Rocks, you the Appletini type. [Hook]. Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it (Gees). Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it (Gees). [Verse 2: Delusional Thomas]. Still fucking with these hoes, though. Bozo on these doppelgänger Jojos. Take a bitch to Soho for some Froyo. Tell her she gon' blow it, Romo. [Mac Miller]. And now I'm out in Cali like Tone-L? c. Young boy, but I'm chilling with some grown folk. No joke, most dope, you just bowl smoke. How much coke you got to sell to make a boat float?. Hit 'em, hit 'em 'til they tell me ""No more"". I'm a highly difficult ropes course. Pulling up to Rome on a chrome gold horse. Say ""What's up? "" to the Pope, pull off in a Porsche. Who you kidding? Your flow's warshed. I ain't from the street but I'll grill you from the porch. I been had hoes, I play sports. Her ass out the bottom of her shorts. [Hook]. [Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]. Black James Bond and a white Shaft. Turned my daughter to a queen. turned a dollar to a dream. Flashy as high beams, smoking on good weed. Something from kush seeds. the only strand to smoke for us Og's. I'm rich - car service, no car keys. First class flight, but the last one new, bitch. She fuck me and swallowed every homie I came with. Mcm bag and nigga, bet some weed in it. 200 dollars worth of Backwoods, we all living. Brought the gangsters back to bucket hat. how real is that?. I'm getting money, rub my tummy, that's my baller sack. Quarter million in a safe in case I get a case. Faggot-ass judge hating on me cause my money straight. Dropped 10 racks in all 50 states. Gon' name my next tour Million-Man March. Make a nun throw it back while I pull her scarf. She gave me head, my nuts touched her cross, boss. Figg Side. [Hook]"

Grabs a 40 from the corner store. and begins to contemplate. Dealing with death like he work in the morgue. absorbing the souls. Forgotten, he lost his way, starring down that barrel. thinking not today. Life's so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious. Fight to the death, 'til there's nobody left. You're holding your breath. because you might get infected. I'm animalistic, instinctively thinking I'm getting ballistic. Be specific, to those who in control we all statistics. Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined. My trigger finger itching, all I kill is time. Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior. The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior. The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shooting lasers. Except I'm cool with Vader. and blowing up rooms that's full of strangers.

I just wanna bring you out on stage to get a standing ovation. All the work you did to make my life feel like a vacation. If you have your moms, you better treat her right. Call her up, say wassup before you sleep tonight. Tell her you love her and thank her for what she did. You may be grown now but remember being a kid when she fed you, shit. You were her baby, so find out what she doing lately, uh. I wanna tell you momma. Sunshine or rain, I'll be there. For the good times or bad, I'll be there. Sunshine or rain, I'll be there. For the good times or bad, I'll be there. . Digo Yukio - @_digopanda"
i'm not real (feat. earl sweatshirt),"[Verse 1: Mac Miller]. Passport, filling it up with stamps. Set a camp up on my land, swam the rivers of Japan. She keep on asking for a rack so I ran. Looking back, like you can't see who I am. Think my bitch don't know me no more. Cause everytime she's sad, I can't console her no more. If money buy you love, then love's not enough. So tell my why you on your knees crying to the floor. If you had the chance. Would you take the time you need to make it right?. The clouds are gray. But would you pay the price to paint 'em white?. Might have a baby on the way, cause I been going in raw. It feels better, that real pleasure. I'm not real, I think I never was. I get a rush every time she let me get a touch. I need to feel that (love) I need to feel that (pain). My garden hasn't been growing, so can you bring that. (rain). I keep my head up (high) A little fed up (lies). They always tell me where my mind is on this Lp. I don't exist, hieroglyphics. Pyrotechnics, metaphysics. Telekinetics put 50k on my credit card. Look for the answers, I'm searching but I ain't getting far. Let's get it on, I'm royal like Tenenbaums in Lebanon. Decepticons, hit it 'til my head is gone. [Hook: Earl Sweatshirt]. Point me to the road, and I'mma run it. Bloodhound with my nose to the money. Ain't fucking with these hoes (never that). Getting duckets 'til I die, while my foes busy running. Fuck it, marijuana smoke in my stomach. toasted in public. Head in the clouds and my toes in the struggle. Like who didn't test yet? Test this. There's a few new rules in effect, bitch (go). [Verse 2: Mac Miller]. See this a rather spooky action movie. roll it up and pass it to me. Hash and booty, absolutely, smack a groupie. acting bourgie. See a creature, ass beauty, need a feature. rather shoot me. Truly bitches must have them bad jeans. and back is Coogi. Had to do these rapper tunes. to let 'em know the trap is booming. Past the views of Catholic schoolers, fact. but you in fact assuming. Back to doing cash pursuing. posted up like Patrick Ewing. Rapper feuds are sad. if you would battle for a stack or two. These eloquent irrelevant sentences. show my penmanship. Indefinite boundaries show you the end of it. Don't forget you infested in nasty crevices. Allowing birds to fall to their death before they even fly. He and I are not the same. Doctor, doctor, please prescribe me. something for the pain. Money in machines, those will make you change. If I go tomorrow, I just hope it ain't in vain. but I can't complain. [Hook]"

Back when we were still in school. we didn't listen to the list of rules. Wrote a million words on the chalkboard. I don't need answers to the questions of intangibles. I told my homies the top so lonely but. We're not gonna die not now. You'll make it here, live free tonight till the day appear. Let's sit back right where we at and let this money pile. How do we get rich, if she acting crazy. I don't need that bitch. Wish I knew back then all the things that I know now. Go on and on, know I had this shit all along. Take a breath, feel this moment hold it just so you can. Look where we at, look where we came from. When will we wake up, lost in translation. You've never been better than me. From this prison I'm setting them free. Open eyes, I'mma let you see. This world is like our dreams. I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday. I'm running to the edge. And when I get there best believe that I'mma jump. Jump, jump, to see if I can fly. I wonder if I jump. Do you think that I can fly"

matches (feat. ab-soul),"(Verso 1: Ab-Soul). Ever since a nigga had recess. Motherfucker felt like a grown-up (Soulo). Momma come and bitch about a curfew. I was still playing round the corner. 7 years old saw my first porno. Damn that fucked me up. At 10 I bust my first nut. On this older ho gut, but so what. Let's recap, the earth spinning too rabbit. I'm living too fast, sin is a habit. I can't hack, fornicate, act this rabid. One bean short of an acid tablet. Security guards spark my cigarettes. The old head go 'head and cop me a brew. Sometimes them Koreans be cool. These shades make me look 22. They say you learn when you get older. I just say that that ain't true. That just means when you was younger. You ain't get turnt up like us, fool. Just got L's so I'm riding high. Still in high school, but I do. Everything I will do. When I'm 25, no lie. (Verso 2: Mac Miller). I was young with ambition. Fucked around with these hoes. Never needed permission. Went and lived the life that I chose. Premonition-type visions, you see the world as it goes. Tell them all what they missing. While I watch as it unfolds. I'm dodging my death. Confident kid, I was trying to grow up with the best. Watching my step. Never know college but could find me. nodding off always on test-day. I coulda been a great graduate. Woulda got one of them hoes from the Bachelor. Coulda been smart. Coulda been a doctor. Life full of drama, little soap opera. Falling in love, like she would've caught ya. Almost got her knocked up, would've been a father. All about energy, make good memories. I'm the fucking Dalai Lama. Only 18 but I got my own business. Then I got fame like what the fuck is this. Whole bunch of cameras, fake ass bitches. Everyone around wanna treat me all different. Oh I'm cool, cause I got money. Back in high school none of the hoes was trying to fuck me. I thought it was a conspiracy. Sometimes my thoughts are scaring me. You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets. They, they, they was looking for somebody like me. Big bag of weed and a money heist scheme. Something brand new, wonder what it might be. Coughing off them drugs, moving at a nice speed. If you're 18 years and older. 18 years and older. If you're 18 years and older. 18 years and older. (Ab-Soul). I will rule the world. Take care of my family and take care of my girl. Plant a couple seeds, blaze a gang of trees. Went to see a rated R movie about me. They said you must be. 18 years and older"

Runnin' through the streets ever since I was a toddler. Playin' cops and robbers. Always was a robber. In my neighborhood all day like Mr. Rogers. Now a little taller, hip-hop monster. Eight-legged flow you can call me Peter Parker. I know you see it boy I'm weeded and spittin' it real. To match my style kid you best be equipped with some steel. My swagger mean dress fresh and so clean. In a flash getting change like a vending machine. Then I'm out pocket of piff hop in the whip. Head to the first dip at the top of the list. Roll in easy got you drinks for the free. On lean and my eyes still chink from the tree. Hoes out the playpen. Eyes behind some Rayban. It's mayhem livin' in this teenage wasteland. Get down get up.

I kill flows, think I need that tear on a tattoo. My bitch suck, she a vacuum. Fuck her in the ass every time I'm in a bad mood. Ain't got a choice, know she do it cause she have to. I hit it raw while I'm listening to Papoose. No respect cause you wear a V-neck. I mean stress, pressure that could even make Keith sweat. I wish Narnia was on a GPS. I wish Rihanna was DTF. I got rich with these rap songs. Bought a drug problem, now the cash gone. Album filled with all sad songs. But this the one that I can laugh on. (Refrão: Tyler, The Creator).

Little momma got salty at me, she started talking tough. So I called the Wolf Gang up, they start to bark it up. Popped a hundred mollies, fixed sherm, think I was sparking up. A bottle of Zima, the Beamer, I started parking up. Seen my nigga, Mac, and he hopped in the back. And then we jet to Fatburger, ordered some Big Macs.

objects in the mirror,"(Verso 1). People love you when they on your mind. A thought is love's currency. And I been thinking about her all the time. I've never seen somebody put together perfectly. What would I have to do to call you mine. Someone like you is so hard to find. You can open up your eyes or you can walk it blind. All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you don't you worry. Listen to me, I'mma set you free. Yeah, he ain't gonna break your heart again. Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy. When, your imagination's on pretend. I never thought that it would feel this way. You, never taught me how to heal the pain. I, wish you caught me on a different day. When it was easier to be happy. (Refrão). Just a little taste and you know she got you. Can you hide away, can you hide away. Sound of silence as they all just watch you. I kinda find it strange. How the times have changed. But I wish, we could go and be free, once. Baby, you and me. We could change the world forever. And never come back again. Is leave it all in the rear-view. Is leave it all in the rear-view, girl. You don't have to cry. You don't have to cry. (Verso 2). And mend a broken heart girl if you can. Don't expect you to be capable. You got the world right in your hands. And that responsibility is unescapable. I promise that I'll be a different man. Please give me the chance to go and live again. I'm having some trouble can you give a hand. It seems perfection really is unattainable. Don't even say you about to end it all. Your life precious ain't a need to go and kill yourself. I ain't so sure that there's an end at all. I wish the truth would just reveal itself. Who do you call to make it to the top. And, who do you call to make the shootin' stop. And who do you call to give the coup a wash?. After everything I did I think I'm still myself. (Refrão). Just a little taste and you know she got you. Can you hide away, can you hide away. Sat in silence as they all just watch you. I kinda find it strange. How the times have changed. But I wish, we could go and be free, once. Baby, you and me. We could change the world forever. And never come back again. Is leave it all in the rear-view. Is leave it all in the rear-view, girl. You don't have to cry. You don't have to cry"
of the soul,"Uh, uh, looks like guy, produce song on paper. First time I did that in like two years. My handwriting is horrible and I can barely read this. Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore though. Figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso. Fucking girls but I never kept the door closed. Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso. I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane. I guess it's the result of drugs that entering my brain. All the sudden every legend keep on mentioning my name. All that doesn't show me that my life would never be the same. Police try and figure out how to get me locked up. I tell those cops suck dog nuts. Arriving to the party in the chariot. Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit. I'm very sick, yes very ill. Eternal sunshine, Jim Carrey feel. At the amusement park scared of heights: ferris wheel. Double dare me to kill?. Got some soul like De La Do, they say I'm new. It's nothing but some déjà vu. Everywhere you go these people hate on you. Déjà vu, déjà vu. I little soul like De La Do, they say I'm new. It's nothing but some déjà vu. Everywhere you go these people hate on you. Déjà vu, déjà vu. Wind chimes, sick rhymes, been high, on this incline. Tryna get my money stackin' tall, six nine. Have some caviar, sip wine. Sacrifice insanity, sacrifice normal. Purpose is for people in the plural. Form never formal, an art form, not a mural. Work for bars that are tighter than your corn rows. See a girl that's lookin' horny in the 4th row. Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho. Dontist, manipulating phonics, put em into sonnets. Let me put you on this nastier than nas is. Bubonic plague, bacteria that's tryna to find a way. Spread, like yolk from a broken egg. Talkin' shit? You just diggin' your grave. Got some soul like De La Do, they say I'm new. It's nothing but some déjà vu. Everywhere you go these people hate on you. Déjà vu, déjà vu. I little soul like De La Do, they say I'm new. It's nothing but some déjà vu. Everywhere you go these people hate on you. Déjà vu, déjà vu. Hypothetically I'm dope, I kick incredibly. Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy. No methamphetamines, hot, one hundred ten degrees. Visually stunnin', you gotta see it on the LED. When I was seventeen I thought I had it figured out. Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route. It's crucial, three new schools, life with a spoonful. Of sugar, yeah, I need my medicine. Fuckin Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president. Represent, all these fuckin' people that I never met. Some expect, me to be the greatest ever. Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever. Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations. I'mma be the best, have some patience. Thought that it was great, then poof. It was nothing but some déjà vu. . Digo Yukio - @_digopanda"

I'm near, not the same, I'm a pioneer. Stabbed the game in the heart with a giant spear. Trying to see success goddamn it's clear. 'Cause I shine like a chandelier. I'm going through this case. Spitting 'bout what to relate. Never can you duplicate. Any of the music made. Gettin' super paid. Lookin' at our future star. They always recognize me when I pass 'em in a moving. car. Always worried about finding out who you are. To know somebody you gotta look into his heart. Your mind so blind I'm ahead of my time. I'm one of a kind. I'm one of a kind. I ain't nothing like you so what, is going on?. There must be something wrong. You'll love me when I'm gone. Imma keep on doing me, 'cause you. Don't even matter and you. You just an actor and I. Just ain't a rapper, no. I'm one of a kind. I'm one of a kind. I'm one of a kind. I'm one of a kind. And my pops said young man, you ain't ready for the. world ahead. Way too much marijuana, always havin' girls in bed. You gonna realize life ain't a party. Fuck around you gon' end up starving. Fuck it I stay fly, live free, die hard. No Bruce Willis this the whole nine yards. Thought that I can rhyme bars go and buy cars. You gotta grind hard once the sunrise start. And my heart great things in my future. 'Cause broke rappers, shit that's just a rumour,. I see the diamond chains mansions in the videos. They must got silly dough,. Do they really though?. Or is it all just a scam for your eyes. Are you in disguise, goddamn I can't decide. All these words here come from my mind. Got nothing to hide boy I'm one of a kind.. Walking through this world I just take a look around. Ain't nobody here like me. Don't nobody got my style. People say I'm different I sure you that's okay. 'Cause I'm way past tomorrow and you stuck in today. I ain't nothing like you so what, is going on?. There must be something wrong. You'll love me when I'm gone. Imma keep on doing me, 'cause you. Don't even matter and you. You just an actor and I. Just ain't a rapper, no. I'm one of a kind. I'm one of a kind. I'm one of a kind. I'm one of a kind. Digo Yukio"

Keep a stallion, tell her gallop. to the store and get cigars, yeah. Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made. I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase.

Give a bitch a little bit of change. she a game in an arcade. (Time crisis) Not a second to lose. I'm the motherfuckin' Bible, that's forever the truth. And this is not another case of the celebrity blues. The devil with me and he tell me to shoot. [Hook]. Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?. Have you ever had to hurt her?

Used to wanna know how a freak taste. Now I'm in it in an instant like replay. Bras a baton, pass it off like relay. Why I'm so mad on my B-Day?. She say ""I thought you got sober"". And I say ""I wish you'd stop being a bitch. And get to minding your business"". Told me ""Money has changed you"". I get to thinking, how rarely do I visit?. How'd I get so egotistical?

Cause I'm speedin' with a blindfold on. and won't be long 'til they watching me crash. And they don't wanna see that. They don't want me to Od and have to talk to my mother. Telling her they could have done more to help me. and she'll be crying saying. that she'll do anything to have me back.

And if she give me the chance. I'll put a seed inside her, make her a mother. Just know that there's a place. Where all my people worry free and everybody straight. Every devil don't got horns. and every hero ain't got capes. Opened up my eyes, shit, I'm finally awake. Good morning. Yeah, good morning. [Interlude: Outro].

Uncontrollable behavior. with some psychopathic tendencies. Lonely as your neighbors with the bitches. he got special needs. Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy. My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe. They got my soul, but I don't let 'em take the rest of me. My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly. And my denim tailored, me and Action rapping. Al be fucking with the fader, sipping mind eraser. Actually, we rapping for the fuck of it. Taking money from you, gonna smack you out in public. We the Republican government. abundance of substance. Having consumption to fuck a bitch. You're Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick. And your bitch looking like Cousin Itt, the ugliest. [Hook: Action Bronson]. I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit. Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick. Cadillacs is getting whipped a hundred eighty fifth. Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle. [Mac Miller]. I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit. Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit. They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead. So how'd I get this red dot on my head?. [Verse 2: Action Bronson]. Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first. After rapping take my people out for octopus. We all deserve it; dedication to the fam. Don't hold your hand out for nothing. if you claim to be my man, damn. You see me peeling off a whip like. when your mother strip. Blow the dice, roll them chips, hit another trip. Shit, I'm on some shit. Hand's fucking hotter than a leather. in the 6 in the summertime. Understand I'm only rhyming for this son of mine. And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils. We ate the tuna, it's suede puma. My look is Jay Buhner, dawggy. cause some of us just age sooner. I'm still twisted, rocking lizards from a strange river. Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver. Check the bio, I fixed the game. Between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio, I been wild. [Hook]. [Verse 3: Mac Miller]. Bitch I'm nodding off, I'm hot as wasabi sauce. And constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance. I was a minor, chasing after vagina. None of my friends were fake. but none of my clothes designer. Went from posted on stoops to smoking on roofs. I came from that basement, now look at this view. Making this money, blowing it all. Fuck what you did, just show me results. [Verse 4: Action Bronson]. Yo, I'm a 635 dipper, fly mothafucka. Leather to the foot, horses I lead 'em to the brook. If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book. I see a lion in the mirror when I look. Look, I lose money but I make it back. I keep it true and ain't no mothafuckin' faking that. I get a fade and then I fade to black. Bet on the Razorbacks. I hold the multi-colored flavored gat. Blat. [Bridge: Mac Miller].

Slash cap peeler, back with a black stripper. Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker. too fat to snap zippers"". In half is what I'll do to Mac Miller. Now my minds first track figured. A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir. Taps liquor the pass 'til it. Goes around the room like his casket finna. Oh, you Mac Miller?. The fact's filtered in the snapped picture. My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper. Yoohoo, I'm finna murder this brunette bitch. Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture. A rap figure to look like you hacked Twitter. I'll show you Beastie Boy. You can't match your killer with that wigger. I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Thriller. He got track fillers for a album. If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker. Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from, Malcolm. I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King. You're from a home of funny bones. Not like quite the one I've known. You look like, before you punched in flows. You were strucking blows, bloody nose. for your honey rolls. In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole. You're a bully's Best Day Ever. With those Nike's on your feet. Coming through Blue Slide Park. I'm gon' rob this chump. On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump. Nigga give me that shit.

I hacked into the motherboard, argued on a public forum. uploaded a virus to the network then unplugged the cord. the laws are not important. if you scared lock your door then.

I ain't nobody, and neither are you. Been contemplating if I even still believe in the truth. I'm so stubborn, I'd rather write my own history book. Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look. All your songs are sixteen's and a hook. We're here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution. I'm down for the movement, trying not to lose it. Jewish Buddhist tryna consume the views of Christianity. Wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup. If it's true, they should hit Alaska in an igloo. I hear the fish biting nice right now. I can't figure out life and feel right right now. Boo, if I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it down.

someone like you,"(3x). Someone like. Someone like. Someone like. Someone like. Someone like. Someone like. Someone like. Someone like you. Someone like you. (Verso 1). Uh, uh, yeah, light up till the pain gone. All I hear is the same song, when the radio yo came on. Fuck around and get waste dawg. Do this shit till the day I die. Are you ready, are you ready?. Terrified, but my hand is steady. Verified, get the camera ready. Carry my, own weight, all these earthquakes don't wake. Me up from this deep sleep. Diving into this cold lake. Fuck a bitch till her toes shake, tellin' me, I'm her soul-mate. Misguide emotion, no face, bullshit with that, no thanks. Dealing with it since '08, fucked around, oh I'm done. And I heard you're supposed to brace,. when you hear the sound of that gun. Now it's losing all of it's fun, spending days in solitude. Too many dumb interviews put me in this awful mood. Not thinkin' logical, gettin' high, jump off the moon. Looked into his soul, when he died right there in the hospital. Peace don't seem possible, when the mine is so close. Came in for your money, then left with all of your hoes. (Refrão). Life moves fast but my baby keep it slow. Open up your mind. Stop forgetting what you know, oh. Shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone, woah. You hurt so good. Girl your lovin hurt so good. (Verso 2). Uh, love me, love me. Then fittin' on ignore me. Beautiful to get ugly. Turn me into a junkey. I still search for something, but I don't know what. Dreaming about nothing, wake you up and then fuck. I love it when you get a little nasty. Hit it from the back, if you like that, wiggle them ass cheeks. Isn't that sweet, same shit you did last week. For all the cash, you might've stood up. And would've walked passed me. Wake me u? from this bad dream. Put a match to this gasoline. Every night with somebody different. Got me thinking it's Halloween. Fucked up, can't feel myself. Work hard might kill myself. Exist through audio, but all my problems that's real as hell. Trapped in this wishing well, death creeping like Splinter Cell. Gettin' high, put my mind away. Find the words to I'm tryin' to say. I'ma think of that later. When the world goes against you, when you get that paper. (Refrão). Life moves fast but my baby keep it slow. Open up your mind. Stop forgetting what you know, oh. Shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone, woah. You hurt so good. Girl your lovin hurt so good. . Digo (:"

Why don't you come on in?. It's like you forgot my face. I just wanna taste of everything. You're made of. We ain't (nothing). Cut the strings, my balloon, watch me fly. Yeah, when are you coming through. To free my mind?. Are you happy with your life?. Can I come and satisfy? open up. Let me inside. When you take off all your clothes. I'm under your control. Rollin' up, you get me high. You were the one to show me. Divine love, love, love, love. Where was you when I was lonely. My divine love, love, love, love?. When the stereo plays our songs.

Uh, I ain't talkin 'bout nothin' with a flow so disgutin'. Ashtray by me that I gotta dump my guts in. Need substance, feed it to the public. No one gon' touch it like my poppy's old musket. Roll up to the function, eatin' all the funyuns. Sentence keep runnin', word the double e cummings. People say to me that it doesn't mean nothin'. Bumble bees buzzin' cause the trouble needs lovin'. Wonder who really give a fuck what I have to say?. Those are people that which I dedicate this rap today. If I have to, I'ma crack your face. Monday to saturday, I'm actin' like a basket case. While sunday I'm goin' golfin' with my callaway's. Or watchin' football, word to joey galloway. Take a shower start singin' like al green. From outside, it probably soundin' like some loud screams. Always had child dreams and nightmares. My music like the airport I hop on a flight there. Wana go to monaco to see what its like there. Roll up in a pair of nike airs, just like, yeah. Wassup, here I am, lookin' in the mirror and. All I see is me, I'm in peace. Go rent out a penthouse, forget all my problems. The things I regret now, be gone by the mornin'. My life is startin', I'm ready as I ever been. Pencilin' my schedule that I gotta move on from mistakes. Number one albums, always givin' you mixtapes. And that's what ima do until I'm richer than bill gates. It ain't all about money for me though. I do this for the people who need a boost in their ego. Work a lot, I'm an addict not a fiend though. Get up, get out, and get somethin', word to cee lo. Bottles of cleco, a couple of cristal. May head to l.a like I'm chris paul. Bout to go platinum off of ""missed calls"". So all of y'all can lick balls. Yeahh. Just you know. Run from the dark. Into the light. You know, you know you're gona find your way out. Run from the dark. Into the light.

He said he'd fight the box to see the wizard. when he was visited by Dorothy who came here on a blizzard. now the whole world's in color, still. how Auntie Em was next of kin and not her mother. real, her face was care-worn. I suspected she migrated to Kansas up from Dearborn. and had beef with Mrs. Gulch since the very beginning of Year One. mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic. the poetry's like the poems and songs of Ecclesiastes. lightning should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet. the Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet. and yell ""hear, hear"", finally some order to this rap shit. finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips. I keep my shit crispy and elegant. so miss me with the irrelevant, the god body is heaven-sent. the hard-body is reverence, since the son of Byford. brother of Fal, every rhyme's halal. every line is kosher, livin' la vida loca. shout out to Tony Toca, we livin' how we supposed to"

the festival (feat. little dragon),"[Intro]. Yeah, yeah. Let me get a little bit more beat. Yeah. [Verse: Mac Miller]. Ask God if she believe in me. and will she accept me as a deity. And tell me the secrecy won't keep you free. I'm sleeping, won't dream until the demons leave. I took a nap, I need a tree in the shade. Feel the sharpness of the swords and blades of grass. Picturing the images that make you laugh. I left you out to die, but will you take me back?. Somewhere in between the crazy and the conscious. She's naked underneath them shadows. Let the sunlight undress her slow. I don't know who I am. I'm so good at doing impressions though. I'm going to the festival, the festival need to let me go. I wake up, pop a couple Benadrylls, go back to sleep. So I made up, everything they said was real, it has to be. Cause actually the master fast asleep. And the castles back back in his private quarters. That's a master for you, this a revolution. we don't have no order. All this torture, thought I had to warn you. Leave it all behind and go to California. I'm past the signs, it's the real thing. try analyzing this feeling. You can't fathom. [Bridge: Yukimi Nagano of Little Dragon]. My hands are ahead the clouds. From the clap-clap thunder looking down. While you're running around. I lift you up when you drown. Unlock the mission, the planet in rotation. Full speed chasing and you're always running ahead. You're always running ahead. You got second chances, happy birthday. sweet romances. And you battle like a champion, why. Do you wanna go, do you wanna go. do you wanna go to the festival. You got angels, we can see them dripping from the sky. You watch 'em with your third eye. Do you wanna go, do you wanna go. do you wanna go to the festival. To the festival. [Outro]. Hola, Malcolm. Hey man, it's Luis man. I'm calling, man, to tell you about the album. I listened. it's good. I need to tell you, man. I tell everyone to listen to the music. and it sound like they like it, man. It sound like it good. I tell my wife ""I'm so proud of him.

A good spot to kick it, a case of fourties. Them homies always havin' good stories. The beer bottles with the twist off caps. When old people tell you that they listen to rap. I love days I can sleep in, full day weekends. Hoes puttin' they clothes back on, you peekin'. Blunt rise, with a mixtape bumpin'. I love makin' love in public. And when the hip-hop legend tour comin' to your town. Findin' a crispy ass twenty on the ground. Walkin' when the sun out, watchin' Run's House. Or action movies when the villain pull the gun out.

The little things everybody need some. The finer things make you feel better. But no one ever seem to remember. I like sleepin' in class and cheatin' to pass. Hoes walkin' in the halls and you reach for they ass. Fast food lines when they movin' so quickly. When your weed man hit you with some sticky. Street performers, warmin' up the corners. Sellin' by the ounce, then pinch it by the quarter. With some kicks on sell. Wakin' up in the mornin' with a shit load of mail. The wake up to bake up, chillin while you face blunts. Goin' in blowed for your shape up, like say what?. Blog put your tape up, get a good review. When dumbass people tell you what you shouldn't do. When she rub my head while I'm between her knees. Gettin love from the people overseas. Haters tryin' to hate, but they got nothin' to say. It's just the little things that get me through the day. The best things in life is the free ones. The lil things everybody need some. The finer things make you feel better. But no one ever seem to remember. The best things in life is the free ones. The lil things everybody need some.

the mourning after,"Morning after, my lungs hurt. Eat your pussy just to show you how my tongue works. Its funny how we fuck but fell in love first. Been three years, I wish I finally trust her.

Left your lipstick on the glass of your daquairi. Ruby red usually end up tragically. Work of art, you can be my masterpiece. But you fast asleep. Something 'bout the pain. Makes me want more. Done a lotta drugs. Never felt like this before. I hope one day it all makes sense. It'll all make sense. You can have it all. Tell me what you need. Believin' all them silly things you read. I hope one day it all makes sense. One day it'll all make sense. Uhh now she wake up. Cryin' while she puttin' on her makeup. Trapped inside her love for me. And no escape for her. You wanna leave say the word. But she can't. Lookin' in my eyes. Is everything okay, she lies. Put on her disguise, play it safe. 'cuz we've been fightin' for the past three weeks. She keep this one inside, she don't wanna seem weak. Strong, baby tell me what's been goin' on. I don't wanna be so alone. So you gotta get me high again. I got all this money we could try to spend. Until we strung out like a violin. Come back to life, then we die again. Little angel, where's your halo?. Somewhere above them wars. Something 'bout the pain. Makes me want more. Done a lotta drugs. Never felt like this before. I hope one day it all makes sense. It'll all make sense. You can have it all. Tell me what you need. Believin' all them silly things you read. I hope one day it all makes sense. One day it'll all make sense. You get me high girl, scared of overdose. I don't sleep much, when I do I'm coolin' my toes. May I propose a toast?. Someone usually does, to our fucked up love. You get me high girl, scared of overdose. I don't sleep much, when I do I'm coolin my toes. Propose a toast. Someone usually does, to our fucked up love. Something 'bout the pain. Makes me want more. Done a lotta drugs. Never felt like this before. (inhale noise). You can have it all, tell me what you need. Believin' all them silly things you read. Don't cry, it'll all be over soon"
the question (feat. lil wayne),"Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am. Wonder who the fuck I am. Uhhhh, yeah, want you to feel it. And my voice probably sounds mad raspy right now. I want you all to feel it. So step up on the mic and uhh. Show them what you got tiger. (Mac Miller). Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am. So I've been lookin' in the mirror and it still don't make no sense. I'm askin' what am I supposed to do?. I've done so much in my short lifetime, but I haven't done shit. I done flew around the whole world. First I shook a million hands and I took a million pictures. But I'm a hostage in my own world. And my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches. I got too much on my damn mind. So if I add some more stress, I just don't see how I'ma cope. I think they underestimate the grind. I do, bring this doe, and I'm only twenty years old. I wonder why I sip this devil juice. Cause it feel incredible, problems, I got several. Thank God that none of that medical. Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected. (Chorus). What am I doing here. I wonder what am I doing here. What am I doing here. What am I doing here. (Mac Miller). I hope this feelin' lasts for fuckin' ever. I don't want to come back down, let me stay above the ground. I hope I do what I was meant to do. Cause I've been searching for that answer, I just hope I get it now. Please, let me find euphoria. When you up above the clouds, like, who gonna touch me now. And do we ever get to know the truth. Cause everybody seems to have it, but to me it seems they lack it. Now I'm rolling and I'm sipping lean. Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love. Drinking liquor and I'm smoking weed. And you don't ever do too much if you could never do enough. Wonder why I scream and stare at you. I'll be there to rescue you, problems you got several. Thank God that none of that medical. Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected. (Chorus). What am I doing here. I wonder what am I doing here. What am I doing here. What am I doing here. (Lil Wayne). Uh, sittin' in my Bentley, thinkin' bout these hoes. All I do is kill them, I kill them like Nicole. Simpson, flag crimson, smoke them like Winstons. I just bought a new chopper, I treat it like an infant. I'm lightin' up a stogie, it's longer than a hoagie. Situation's gettin' fishy and I don't eat anchovies. Fuck the world, kill them all, she answer when I call. If the cops pull us over, she gon' hide it in her drawers. See I come from a place where stars never shine. And drama is accepted, credit cards are declined. Everybody gotta die, but I ain't everybody. If that ho play with me, I whoop that chick like Terrence Howard. I'm a pimp, I ain't lyin', but that is not important. I'm just tryna to buy time, but can't really afford it. Saying ain't that a bitch, but I hope that bitch is bad. I feel like money in the trash like. (Chorus). What am I doing here. I wonder what am I doing here. What am I doing here. What am I doing here. . Digo Y. - @_digopanda"

the star room,"[Intro: Delusional Thomas]. Hallelujah, thank God I have a future. Praying I don't waste it getting faded. Cause I'm smoking *censored* 'til I'm coughing up tar. Through the surge, energy curve like a lumbar. I don't act hard, I still read Babar. Tripping out, looking at a bunch of Google map stars. Shit, they got a app for... that. [Verse 1: Mac Miller]. But me, I'm still trapped inside my head. It kinda feel like it's a purgatory. So polite and white. but I got family who would murder for me. Think I'm living paradise, so would I have to worry 'bout?. Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure. Find the perfect style. Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love. All these backfires of my experiments with drugs. And I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form. The difference between love and war inform me. I'm above the norm. But, give me anybody though. I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts. Rhyming like it's summertime on asphalt, hot. Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed. I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up. when my dad calls. Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?. I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice. And I don't know what I'm running from. but I'm running still. I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothing real. I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel. So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fucking deal. Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil. But I want that Rolls Royce. that the homie Lennon drove. So, if you ain't talking 'bout some money. I'mma send you home. Unconventional, special but unprofessional. Adolescent expression. that's letting me meet these centerfolds. As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go. If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow. That's just me all wilding out and being extra doe. [Verse 2: Mac Miller]. And if God was a human. it'd be yours truly, watching horror movies. With some foreign groupies, thinking this decor suits me. I do drugs to get more loopy, I'm in tune. To ancient jujitsu spirituals, it's blissful. Looking out as far as eyes can see. I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet. I think I'm Jfk's final speech. They try assassinating all of my beliefs. But I'm asleep so whisper to me for some peace of mind. And he be high some weed to grind. on top a Jesus shrine. Twenty thousand on my watch cause I needed time. If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine. Can't decide if you like all the fame. Three years ago to now, it's just not the same. I'm looking my window ashing on the pane. Shit, wonder if I lost my way. [Verse 3: Delusional Thomas]. Don't you ever wanna hide away. Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain. Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today. I'll greet the devil with a smiling face. Shit, that God fellow may reside in space. As, time's a wasting I'm freebasing with Freemasons. My girl's switching the locks, the keys keep changing. Dreaming of places, my own personal creations. If there's a party in heaven I plan to leave wasted. Retracing my steps way back to Biblical times. We-we all gon' end up meeting at the finishing line. [Outro: Mac Miller]. And these words that I command you today. shall be in your heat. And you shall teach them diligently to your children. And you shall speak of them when you sit at home. And when you walk along the way. and when you lie down. And when you rise up, I am the lord, your god"
the way,"I love the way you make me feel. I love it, I love it. I love the way you make me feel. I love it, I love it. Say, I'm thinking 'bout her every second, every hour. Do my singing in the shower. Picking petals off of flowers like. Do she love me? Do she love me not?. I ain't a player, I just. You give me that kind of something. Want it all the time, need it everyday. On a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred. Never get enough, I can't stay away. If you want, I got it, I got it everyday.

thoughts from a balcony,"For what's up about dream, turn 'em to reality. Double-cup of lean. Uh, lemme get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination. I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station. Packin' no bags, nothin' but the clothes on my back. Where the Cognac?. Let me sip it, tryin' to relax. Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon. I got army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan. Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on. I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't stayin' long. What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?. I told me story, put my life inside this ink pen. Said I'll make it big when, everybody know me. Well, I made it big and, everybody phony. Haha, so could you pour me, I need a cup. No, none of that liquor, mixin' purple stuff. I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much?. Go head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free. They're just dreams, turn 'em to reality. Double cup of lean, standing on my balcony. Looking at the sky, thinking it could all be mine. All we got is memories. So what the fuck is time?. They're just dreams, turn 'em to reality. Double cup of lean, standing on my balcony. Looking at the street, thinking it could all be mine. All we got is memories. So what the fuck is time?. What the, what the fuck is time?. Ask 'em, what the fuck is time?. I know. What the fuck is time?. I asked 'em, what the fuck is time?. What do you do when you think you could be a icon. Cause all these people get to screamin when the lights on. Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, leave the coat. Racin to the gate but my flight gone. And now these writers takin shots without a Nikon. But I don't fight tho, figured it's a typo. Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though. Potion in my sprite, then my nice slows, down, down. See that's exactly what I need. My khakis filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat. Like it was ""Donald Trump"", a fuckin hit but I just called it luck. They throw it on when I'm walkin in the club. Hey, this some Burgh shit, I don't deserve this. Why I don't think you lookin far beyond the surface. Learn quick now I'm big time, fill your cup up, and I'ma sip mine. Filled up dreams, turn 'em to reality. Double cup of lean, standing on my balcony. Looking at the sky, thinking it could all be mine. All we got is memories. So what the fuck is time?. They're just dreams, turn 'em to reality. Double cup of lean, standing on my balcony. Looking at the street, thinking it could all be mine. All we got is memories. So what the fuck is time?. What the, what the fuck is time?. Ask 'em, what the fuck is time?. I know. What the fuck is time?. I asked 'em, what the fuck is time?. Alright. . Digo Y. e Camila."

time flies (feat. lil b),"[Interlude 1: Lil B]. Time flies, time flies. As we keep living and as we keep being positive. all we can do is hold onto these memories. Mac Miller, I love you. [Verse 1: Mac Miller]. All of my homies used to get on my case like. ""when you gonna kill 'em? "". Soon as I'm out of millions. and my girl sprouts some children. But I've been murderin' the game, almost out of victims. This food for thought usually enough. to feed a thousand pigeons. I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though. Shit bro, would you give it all up for these nymphos?. I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?. Half man and half amazin', but that's just me bein' modest. I'm an honest man, my mama told me never. put it on the lotto and. I work for everything I get that is my motto, fam. So when I die, these bitches. still can fuck my hologram, god... damn. [Bridge: Mac Miller]. And all that drama that you comin' with. you blowin' my high. On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride. I got 'em worried that my mind fried. I'm goin' up before I skydive. [Hook: Mac Miller]. You can see the way that time flies. Time files, try to catch it. Time flies, time flies. Try to catch it. [Interlude 2: Lil B]. Watch as time go, time moves, time flows. How do we handle these things?. I am time, we are time and we have control. One thing we need to remember. is that we are all in this together. [Verse 2: Mac Miller]. You can expect the unexpected. These dreams are manifested from my head into reality. they seems a bit excessive, but. I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings. All the times that I've been reckless. with an ego big as Texas, thinkin' ""I'm the man"". I never let these hoes inside the plan. My room for bullshit in the crib as small as a child's hands. I fill the shoes and walk a path where only giants stand. I am the fire man, shit I'm way too fly to land, yeah. I'm smokin' weed all alone, on the road. Even though I know they need my at home. Keep my control from a city where it's freezin' and cold. Each to their own. punches like this probably beat up Stallone. [Bridge: Mac Miller]. And all that drama that you comin' with. you blowin' my high. On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride. I got 'em worried that my mind fried. I'm goin' up before I skydive. [Hook: Mac Miller]. You can see the way that time flies. Time files, try to catch it. Time flies, time flies. Try to catch it. [Interlude 3: Lil B]. One day we will, we will find, we will conquer. conquer with love. while time is on our side. Continue to hold to those beautiful memories. They won't be here forever, but our spirit lives on, Lil B"

two matches (feat. ab-soul),"[Pre-Hook: Mac Miller]. When I was just a kid. Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich. No more problems and no more tricks. I set my sights high cause in my life time. Man, I've seen some shit, I swear to God. I've seen some muthafuckin' shit. Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (Bullshittin'). [Hook: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul]. Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish. What's a life if you never take a risk?. Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big. Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun. Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun. [Verse 1: Ab-Soul]. In my life time, my whole M. O. was to get this M. O. N. E. Y. Sabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor (Soul). Long story short, that's one of my long term goals. My anatomy is platinum, gold is old. Lettin' my hair swing like Pootie Tang. I done seen some spooky things. through these gucci shades. Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums. Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade. But can't we all just get along?. Like Martin Lawrence would say. and get along with our day. She say ""Soulo, you so crazy and deranged"". I say I know, roll that weed nigga! (Shake that ass hoe!). Most Dope, Top Dawg off the leash. Sounwave on the beat (Wizzo) Our Anarchy is our Nr key. Your confidence is caca compared to a kamikaze. Still wishin' peace to all y'all, pardon my nostalgia. Soul!. [Pre-Hook: Mac Miller]. When I was just a kid. Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich.

Swear to god, seen some shit. Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is. [Verse 2: Mac Miller]. In this life time, be the time of your life. It's been a while. but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike. And as a child, I was curious my mind was the dirtiest. Curse words we're probably my first words, affirmative. My home run derby shit, was makin' profit out the park. Even the brightest mind. will hang around at dark sometimes. I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize. Had to write my wrongs. the day's short, the night's is long. I'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish. From gigantic portions, Lord is important. but I am stronger. I'm a monster with the heart of a lion divide and conquer. Walk on water, it won't be long till I flyin'. that's my departure. I'm a goner, shootin' down from the sky. with the eyes of an archer. What a fine act you got for. I don't know why what I get soo high for. I'm a problem and as hard as I try hiding from karma. You'd be traumatized seein'. what came across these eyes. There was a time. [Pre-Hook: Mac Miller]. When I was just a kid. Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich. No more problems and no more tricks. I set my sights high cause In my life time.

I had a rough, she had some weed and told me. ""come dude, we should smoke"". Bring you parallels or bring the money, baby I am broke. So I'm walkin' up the stairs to the porch. Knocked against the door, heard some feet against the floor. The door had opened up and it was her. She told me hurry, come right in. Leave your shoes up by the furnace we just put new carpets in. She asked me 'bout my day and sat me down. told me we should have some fun. There ain't nobody around. She got this crazy pill the other day. when she was on her way to work. Told me it will make my problems go away and fix the hurt. That I had, well, that don't sound bad, down the hatch. Kinda nervous, just relax, she's there rubbing on my back. Well I ain't really into drugs but fuck it. I'm a take a trip and I'm a love it, love it. I don't know what happened to me. But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free. It took me to somewhere off the map. And I don't think I'll ever find my way back. Well I left right after that and started driving to my house where. I reside. I was high and possibly a little fuckin' I ain't remind. Can't remember where I live, it ain't like I just bought this house. I said fuck it, took a breath, opened my door and just jumped out. And it's funny cause I didn't hit against the road. I just went right through the ground and started floatin' on my own. I see colors, different colors, like they glowin' in the light. They was glowin' like they glowin' in the dark but it was bright. That's alright, this shit crazy, what the fuck she had me take. If this kill me I'm a come back, haunt her every single day. As I wait, sittin' somewhere that I've never seen. Feel like I'm forever dream, just imagine said a scene. Power in imagination, got all my surroundings changing. Found a place to drown my brain. to something like it's outer space. But nothing like the pictures of the astronauts. they show me back at school. When they told me drugs were bad, oh man,. oh man they had me fooled. I don't know what happened to me. But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free. It took me to somewhere off the map.

What if, what if, what if this is it?. Expectations picking, they wonder what I’m about to do. Sport interest, music I can count on you, right?. Do I have it all twisted? I went from popular to… in an instant. My friends forgot me cause they probably seen me on…. In an… where I should be out at a party!. It drives me crazy, money is the due. Insomnia I could wait.. something I can do to put the work in it…. Failure getting jealous, throwing dirt upon my name. Burning up my pain, but I’m working through my pain. Cause life’s hard, ’till you learn it’s just a game!. Play your cards, use your letters on your scrabble board. If you’re small, put your heart into your rapping more. No money? why the f-ck you’re counting for?. A thousand.. trying to get up my allowances.. What if I’ll never make it?. What if I’m never famous?. What if, I’m broke. And my whole life is been a joke?. What if nothing never happens?. What if I gotta stop rapping?. What if, what if, what if this is it?"
what's the use?,"You can love it, you can leave it. And say you're nothing without it. Don't let them keep you down. What if I don't need it? There's something about it. That just freaks me out. I just want another minute with it, fuck up little, what's the use?. Never superficial you don't know it when it hit you. With a little sentimental when I'm off the juice. Yeah, okay we colder than the breeze. But the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker hol' up. You don't need to hol' up, yeah. And I can show you how I seem what it is what it truly might be. Nothing that you know of, you don't need to hol' up. I'm so above from beyond you take drugs to make it up. Way up where we on, space shuttle, Elon. Time we don't waste much, fuck and we wake up. Then have her sing just like Céline Dion. Catch me if you can but, you never catch me damn. Whole lotta yes I am. All the way in with no exit plan. Already left and the jet don't land. Yeah, the time is ticking. Come take a ride, get inside, this is highly different. I'm talking fly like a pilot would. Can I mind my business? Why you trippin'?. Give you somethin' that your eyes can witness. Ooh, too close. I don't understand why you doing the most. You can love it, you can leave it. And say you're nothing without it. Don't let them keep you down. What if I don't need it? There's something about it. That just freaks me out. I just want another minute with it, fuck up little. What's the use? What's the use?. Never superficial you don't know it when it hit you. With a little sentimental when I'm off the juice. When I'mma give you what you came for, yeah. Shoulda perk too hard to have a clue who you are. Set the bar so far but par we can parlay all day. Crib long range with the yard. I know I should probably pray more but you gotta love me. 'Cuz I save the day spendin' money. When I had nothing shit it wasn't so funny. Made a promise to the homies nobody go hungry. Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name. But it never worried my brain. Heads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'. Tell the sun get up outta my shade. If they don't get the picture, cut 'em out of my frame, shit. I'm up 30 thou miles plus change. Spend a while but I'm down 'till I'm out. And it is what it is 'til it ain't. You can love it, you can leave it. And say you're nothing without it. Don't let them keep you down. What if I don't need it? There's something about it. That just freaks me out. I just want another minute with it, fuck up little. What's the use? What's the use?. Never superficial you don't know it when it hit you. With a little sentimental when I'm off the juice. You can love it. It just freaks me out"

Just pray to god that I'm safe when the soldiers come. They hear me, they forgettin' if I'm old or young. Got this music on lock, but I open up. All the time, cause my bars and my rhymes be my lifestyle. Blowin' white clouds, I'm gettin' high right now. If we could know where we was going. We'd probably never see tomorrow.

They need some coffee, everybody's sleeping on me. Going around door to door, setting off alarms. All that horse shit, you should have left it at the barn. Keep a stallion, tell her gallop. to the store and get cigars, yeah. Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made. I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase. Me and my bizarre ways (no emergency). I moved up from a Private to a Sergeant. You can see it from a scar face. Hidden in a dark place, swimming in the shark tank. Give a bitch a little bit of change. she a game in an arcade. (Time crisis) Not a second to lose. I'm the motherfuckin' Bible, that's forever the truth. And this is not another case of the celebrity blues. The devil with me and he tell me to shoot. [Hook]. Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?. Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do. Can you draw a perfect circle?. Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options. what do you do?. I wash these pills down with liquor and fall. Leave it to me, I do enough for us all (I do). Got what you need if you like breaking the law. My mother raised me a God (Hey). (Fuck you). [Verse 2]. Yeah, blame the drugs, got me sinning on the weekday. Drunk as fuck, doing buck sixty on the freeway. Giving y'all the freebase. hidden in the middle of a briefcase. Hidden in a subwoofer, beat case. Used to wanna know how a freak taste. Now I'm in it in an instant like replay. Bras a baton, pass it off like relay. Why I'm so mad on my B-Day?. She say ""I thought you got sober"". And I say ""I wish you'd stop being a bitch. And get to minding your business"". Told me ""Money has changed you"". I get to thinking, how rarely do I visit?. How'd I get so egotistical?

(Fuck you). Would you remember me if I never woke up?. Bye bye (Fuck you). I've been a sinner, I'm just tryna stay. Warm through winter, and I'll be on my way.

Shit would be simple. problems would be in the past by now. Me and the homies would be sitting on millions. Reminiscing on times. when we were so broke and living in Oakland just chillin'. I thought I'd have it in the bag by now. I thought that we'd be kicking back by now. I know that life is a bitch, I know that life is a bitch. I thought we'd put her in a cab by now. But I'm stressing, I can't relax. I swallow my pride and I'm hiding what's making me mad. Everybody say I need rehab. Cause I'm speedin' with a blindfold on. and won't be long 'til they watching me crash. And they don't wanna see that. They don't want me to Od and have to talk to my mother. Telling her they could have done more to help me. and she'll be crying saying. that she'll do anything to have me back. All the nights I'm losing sleep, it was all a dream. there was a time that I believed that. But white lines be numbing them dark times. Them pills that I'm popping, I need to man up. Admit it's a problem, I need a wake up. Before one morning I don't wake up. You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya. I'm too obsessed with going down as a great one. But if you wait too long, they go find someone. to replace ya. So I guess this is a letter, to all my brothers. Most Dope, that's forever. I love you more than words could express. And this the part that Q start crying, if he ain't already yet. I did my best to be a leader you respect. At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret. So tell my baby I love her. And if she give me the chance. I'll put a seed inside her, make her a mother. Just know that there's a place. Where all my people worry free and everybody straight. Every devil don't got horns. and every hero ain't got capes. Opened up my eyes, shit, I'm finally awake. Good morning. Yeah, good morning. [Interlude: Outro]. Yo Vin, it's the morning, you gotta go to work. ""alright"". Yo, you gotta be at work in like ten minutes, yo. (You good?). ""I'm straight, yo what's good? "" (when you going?). You gotta pick up the dry cleaning and shit still?. ""man, fuck that shit, I'll skip"". You bout to go to work?. ""mm"". Ight, what time you gotta be at work?. ""I don't know"". soon?. You Democrat or Republican?. ""Uuhh""I don't know anymore?. Would you vote for a female president?. ""I don't care what gender or race you are"""
2009,"Yeah. Eric. Well. I don't need to lie no more. Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind. And she don't cry no more. She tell me that I get her high.

Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me. Send you back home with a light that's beamin'. The whole team 'bout to figure it out. We ice cold, that's what winter's about. And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route. Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm. Have a ball with a dribble and bounce. 'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah. Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money. Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly. I was yea high and muddy. Lookin' for what was lookin' for me. But I don't need to lie no more. Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind. And she don't cry no more. She tell me that I get her high.

Yeah they ask me what I'm smilin' for. Well, because I've never been this high before. It's like I never felt alive before. Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind and water. See me and you, we ain't that different. I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'. Take my time to finish, mind my business. A life ain't a life 'til you live it. I was diggin' me a hole big enough to bury my soul. Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own. My own, with these songs I can carry you home. I'm right here when you're scared and alone.

See the world is simple, but complex in the design. I, spent some time just thinkin', where did that get me? High, more drinkin'. Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?. Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source. Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list. Try and understand the fuckin' message I encrypted. Itchin', halucinatin' visions of utopia. Until I figure out that the perfect world, the lonely one. Never hold my tongue, vocal as a loaded gun. And I'm a shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run. Mac Miller, I'm the only one, but I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium. Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split.

Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress. See, this is what I do the best. Nothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest. Save hard, a Braveheart, a warrior. I take part to stay far from coroners. I heard some corny words said about my music though. Talkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho. Most Dope, got you hooked, yellin' Ruffio.

And every night I get advice, cause life is way too complex. Heaven's lights are hella bright, ironic how that came to be. But can't you see? this angel speaks. She's saying the place is safe for me. I told ""wait for me"", the make believer normally disguise. Transform before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs. The morning rises and I'm fast asleep. Somewhere off in the master suite.

I'm just trying to make it all make sense. (verso 2). Uh, as you hypothesize on how to monetize. Take advantage of all the time we fall behind. Get lost in this aquarium. America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up. We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria. Confessions that I have and curiosity about life and death. Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest. Read about the meaning of dreaming and all its messages. Sedatives that take me to god, witness his fetishes. We all in search for substance. That gives you pain and numbness. Circumstances advance the second chances, for this beloved. I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this coming. But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrows trend. Your life, it all depends on dollars spent. And knowledge gained. Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days. Life, it works in such mysterious ways. All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say. (refrão). I'm wearing a blindfold, like where did the time go.

And I ain't talking about one of them. I'm getting both. I grab them and get a lo. And then take their money and their coats. I blow trees, so my mouth is always filled with smoke. You sniffin coke. Singing but you havent hit a note. Plus that shit you wrote isnt set to carry a crowd. I'm legendary anywhere that I'm out. I'm sharing this pound. With my people like a how high sequel.

I sport a long white tee, fitted cap, baggy pants.. If you see me be sure to slap my hand. Some people do it for the love. Some peiple do it cuz they can. But me, I'm tryna be legend like bag a vance. Some rap will make you think. While other shit will make you dance. So I bump what ever is in the system. Tryin to make some plans. I just want to see whats good for the night time. If nothings hype, ima head up to crib and write rhymes. Age like white wine, nicer by the second,. Thats why I never put punctuation on a sentence. Cuz the song goes on, here a dope song. If they say I wasnt for real, then you was told wrong. See you ain't on, what we on. You bright, I'm neon. I'm smoking up the weed till the tree gone. Yeaahh. My life is up and down like a sew saw. So I stay with a bitch like leon...phelps"

blunt of my mind,"Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind. See I'm one of a kind. There's a brain behind. All these different wonderful rhymes. Some people's livin in the past. Cuz they runnin from time. Seems like so long since big punisher died. Hope he see me when I'm lookin up from under the sky. I'mma tell you how it is cuz I got nothin to hide. And soul theory makes the beats that'll bump in the ride. This criminal lifestyle that I'm jumpin inside. A mastermind, superb with both sides of his brain. Roll me up into a swisher, start flyin away. But ash my soul, rub the L on the side of the tray. Cuz its hard looking up, like the sky when it rains. Smokin strains that levitate me like David Blaine. I'm a player and you hatin on my game. Say my name, cuz this here's my destiny child.

And I shall not hold my tongue. So i'mma speak till I fold my gums. I was told to run. Cuz every day is a colder one. I wake up not knowing if I'm old or young. I can't find my place so I lay upon these beats. Covering my pain with layers of melodic sheets. Mother earth's a bitch so when kingdom come. We gonna bring em some till thy will be done. And still to come is when I'm finally driven to insanity. By my family, who never seemed to be a fan of me. My knees are shaken, see I'm not able to stand. Cuz they label a man by his paper in hand. Sittin in a dark alley with some paper and pens. Writin, just thinkin when this day's gonna end. What can you say to a man who can't look at himself. When the image in the mirror keeps on yellin for help. Just roll up (6x). Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind. All you haters relax. Sit back, sit back, sit back we got you feelin so fine. With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin so high. Got me feelin so, feelin so, with this blunt of my mind. Hip hop's child, you feel me do the touchin. Spittin got me smitten, no excuses for the lovin. I'm tryina get it written but I'm comin up with nothin. A couple words in each line. filled with somethin somethin somethins. And to me, hip hop ain't got a criminal past. Its just explosions of sound as these syllables clash. Briain on critical mass. Fuck political trash. These politicians speakin, but its comin out they ass. Talkin bout ""school is cool"" and ""drugs for thugs"". Tryina push me down the path, but I shall not budge. Cuz, i've been thinkin and I think I have a hunch. Who hand the mic to get enough. While me and music makin love. And my community, ain't all about who I choose to be. This life and what it do to me, the ruined opportunities. This figurative language that I'm speakin so fluently. Look back like a photo album seein who I used to be. Playin piano while I'm strummin guitar. Can't buy myself a spaceship so I'm runnin to mars. Stare at death in the face, like I'm under a car. And not everybody hatin, but enough for you all. Just roll up (6x). Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind. All you haters relax. Sit back, sit back, sit back we got you feelin so fine. With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin so high.

Get paid, upgrade, two cribs, new maids, more flights, flew planes. Live out my suitcase. Lose days like loose change. I swear my life is on Blu-ray. Welcome to doomsday. The world needs a hero and I am your Bruce Wayne. Kind of like Luke Cage. You keep on running. We keep on pushing your buttons. Yeah, there's no answer and you call twice. Nobody be at my house. I was at the studio all night. Last night I slept on the couch. I might wake up, do it all again. There's a world gone crazy outside. But let's pretend that it's alright. We keep pretending that it's alright. I run around with open scissors. They taking pictures. I could lose my head, they grow instead. Gets only bigger. I put one foot in front of the other. I never settle, waste your time with water and wine. I'm turning liquid to metals. Still the same dude that used to never be sure. When I was way more insecure, and I'd feel better before. N, umbrellas never could weather the storm. No sympathy for the devil, too busy building a temple. I am looking beyond, leaving them looking. Hottest to grill, I'm putting them on when I be cooking. (Cooking, cooking cocaine). I keep on running if I have to. Medusa never turned me to a statue, no. I keep it moving (moving) , but keep it low (low). You can do your thing, shit, to each their own. But you better do something. We keep on pushing your buttons (buttons). Yeah, there's no answer and you call twice. Nobody be at my house. I was at the studio all night.

And now im growin up lookin around this planet. Some shit be goin on and I just can't understand it. No need to panic I got to expand it. A million downloads im takin over your bandwidth. Moments all can did kodak reminisin go back,. Life feel good want yall to know that. Don't have no dill and no half a mill. Just on my game start shit with some mass appeal. Go platinum, independently, incredibly dope. You needa tell a scope to come and get at me. And maybe I could never see to label my identity. They see my middle finger shut the fuck up and let me be.

Hey, had to take the beat and let it breath usin up the oxygen. The kid he go rockin' and there ain't to stoppin' you. See me stockin' up workin every second of the day and still not enough. Now on that cocky stuff wat yall to acknowledge us. If you don't suck my dick bitch esophagus. You probably just go all on the internet. See a conversation and you fell the need to interject. I ain't finished yet dont think this kid a threat. I'm on the lose end find me supervision yet. You an mp3 im still in a set, vintage yet. Futuristic with some shit taht split your dick(deck). My cadence complex rhyme without a concept. Atomic bombs your just a stupid fake bomb threat. Six in the morning and im writing these rhyme workin hard. So that you know every night is a grind,fine"
family first (feat. talib kweli),"[Mac Miller]. Dealing with everybody's opinion. Trying to do me. Only down one, I'm in the final. Shooting threes. Like I don't give a fuck. Music we fuck andswitch the position up. We love the things that keep on. Bringing out the kids in us. Been working all my life to do some different stuff. For people to say I'm young and haven't lived enough. To say I haven't lived enough. I'm on the road, my girl so sad I'm gone. It's hard when I can't even find the time to call my mom. And she thinks I'm going Hollywood. I guess she probably should. It seems like people see the bad and don't acknowledge good. I feel the shade but I can see the sun, cool. I got the time to feel the need to run, a fool. Is what I've become, young and I'm dumb. Been spending cake to get some bump in the trunk. Drums with a pump like some Reeboks. See me from the treetops. They worry but they need not. Heating like a teapot. Now I think I'm cool cause I got a pair of shoes. A mug dog, a jacket with a Polo logo. My cup always filled with Henny. So no Four Loco. They should know, so. I could go slow, you see that I'm smooth now. Used to ignore me. They study what I do now. With some help from Kweli. And it's Like on the they. Its cool to say my cypher complete. [Talib Kweli]. Word. I'm so sick with the verbs I use. The words to heal us. They love how I kill it on stage, man. Murder theaters. No wonder they call it a bug asleep in the coffin. Dead tired. Exhausted from how often I be touring. So gangsta, Like the occupation of Made Men. Creating chaos, my operation is Mayhem. The movie never stopped the Frank changeover. We add a Mac to the wolfpack: hangover. That Hen is not a friend. I'm on that Lager of lent. Whatever substance, I abuse it like a grown man. You not a kid no more. Don't want to hold your hand and fall off. And make you shoulder-lean like you dro fan. Go ham, like Abraham reading all the signs. Oh yeah, and don't forget to call your moms. Same thing I told Bow Wow last year. Take care of the fam. Cause it's all we really have here. . Digo Yukio -digopanda"

A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams. A price on an idea we never can agree. They tell you what you know but its better to believe. So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be. Still I tell em. Fuck what you know, I'm feeling comfortable. Just continue living life cuz enough of 'em don't. You spend your days counting every single penny, mane.

Wrap this much make up off my bitch soon as she yawning. Take up, hours upon days just to find power shit to say. But you won't hear it, even if your ears was pierced with. Beats by dre, I mean. The sun is slowly falling. We all surely should die eventually. So whats your calling?. Oh, you left your phone behind,. Identity, crisis breaks mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness. Jesus christ is right near us and devil said you owe 10%. Sold your soul. I know sold your soul and get ?. My focus is ? that float in the open. Oceans that coast the line on the margins I rhyme. Or choking or soaking up game. I'm hoping you picked the second one. The emotion of jealousy that your holding. You're telling me that your golden but really cubic zirconian. Let me see. I break you down like a pound of fire whenever. Your tactics are mighty clever. But even if you're mayweather you. You can't fight the feeling, feeling. You can't fight the feeling, no.

Turn it up and follow all my journeys as I live my dream. All natural whole foods that lay you back. Have you straight chillin' in a dope mood. And some shit is a happy like a show tune. This a brand new world I can show you. Some people still have no clue. But they can look at all this cheese that I produce. In the world that go round you up and you down. You in and you out. You smile and you frown. Just get up, get up. Get up, get up. Get up, get up. Get up, get up. In the world that go round you up and you down. You in and you out. You smile and you frown. Just get up, get up. Get up, get up. Get up, get up. Get up, get up. Hey. Ayo I'm fast lane switchin'. Rap game spittin'. Chillin' with some sour. Got a bad dame twistin'. These people think I'm goofy say Mac's day trippin'. Cause life a comedy like my last name griffin (what). Livin for the moment. Blowin' potent overloaded. And my swagger call me old spice. Yeah the kid is so nice. Smokin' in the wind chillin'. Duckin' from the police (police). So bright you know light. So I'm shinin' like a strobe lights. Leave the show with money and I always count my dough twice. Most dope general and that shit is fo life. My mama taught me well so I even treat these hoes right I'm polite. Workin' in my office but no dwight. Coat white skinded no light dimness. Me who I am playing sight for these bitches. And I ain't even tryna fight with these bitches. And I don't got time to spend the night with these bitches. In the world that go round you up and you down. You in and you out. You smile and you frown. Just get up, get up. Get up, get up. Get up, get up. Get up, get up. In the world that go round you up and you down. You in and you out. You smile and you frown. Just get up, get up. Get up, get up. Get up, get up. Get up"

I need you sleepin' next to me. The blanket sheets, I'll take them all and keep you warm. Yeah and I teach her that we were the creatures of love. You be the leader, I could be Julius Caesar.

Like a roller coaster but I stay along for the ride. Put my heart up on the page, and the song gonna cry. It's launchin' behind, the way you stand caught in a lie. Ain't a shock that I'm a topic of discussion. Muthafuckas want my spot so they probably wish I wasn't. They give a little love like everyone does. In reality, they stoned off that competitive drug. And I don't blame em, cause those who above me, I'm gunnin' for. Try and make my way to the top, startin' from the floor. And I don't even need to bring a single gun to war. Cause I be on some shit that they ain't never done before. Takin' over piece by piece, startin' from the core. It's only been a year I can stick around a hundred more. Said I could stick around a hundred more. I ain't goin nowhere. Young and so much time to go. Jerm you might as well keep this one rollin.

Smell the weed when you go and buy global grind. And I ain't just a local guy. When you feelin' stressed out, have an L. Blow money, keep my lady decked out in Chanelle. Live fast when I die better wish me well. Huh, I just hope they servin' beer in hell. Just an everyday story that I'm here to tell. So please, stick around for the Epilogue. For anyone who ever blog, probably heard my name. Hip-Hop's underdog, you wanna win the game. I'm sick of hearin' how music change never be the same. And these dudes who think they everything and never pick a lane. Call yourself a vet, but haven't won a single game. Mad, every girl got my name imprinted in her brain. Boy I'm a beast, match the style in bars. Find me smokin' weed where the wild things are. Yessir. So I mean, I had to take this time. Real quickly, to just go in. I don't know man I feel like you should never stop goin' in on your shit. That's just me. I mean, Qtreezy out there we excited just makin' history. And Jerm of course. Digo Yukio"

i am who am (killin' time) (feat. niki randa),"[Verse 1: Mac Miller]. Look, I'm posing a question. How many been empty and holding aggression?. Close to depression. Open your eyes and just focus a second. Fuck a recession, my brother. My mind is my weapon, I'm letting it go. Loading and pointing at negative energy. Telling me stop, they're telling me no (Don't). Your aura is something you ain't even sure of. Explore the core of California. whores got more to snort up. I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought. That's a lot, the feeling come after the shock. praise me I'd rather you not. Cause it's driving me crazy. The fact that you pay to make me into something I love. You come to the club searching for drugs. drunk, fucking these sluts. God loves me, what if he does, what does it mean?. You're wasting away doing nothing, you're fronting. Why ain't you chasing your dreams?. We wonder 'bout life but none of us willing to learn. The money we earn is something to burn. Why won't they give me a turn out?. Feed the hungry and clothe the naked. You're mistaken the world is cold and it's lonely ain't it. When 'em high roller homes in Vegas. raid 'em with some home invasions. Contaminating the place with plague. we just saved the day. I waste away in a room spitting these raps. Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back. [Hook: Niki Randa]. It's a gift. Our time to be alive. No earthly vehicle. Can contain this drive. [Verse 2: Mac Miller]. Forfeit in the war, he lays a sword down and walks away. Grabs a 40 from the corner store. and begins to contemplate. Dealing with death like he work in the morgue. absorbing the souls. Forgotten, he lost his way, starring down that barrel. thinking not today. Life's so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious. Fight to the death, 'til there's nobody left. You're holding your breath. because you might get infected. I'm animalistic, instinctively thinking I'm getting ballistic. Be specific, to those who in control we all statistics. Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined. My trigger finger itching, all I kill is time. Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior. The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior. The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shooting lasers. Except I'm cool with Vader. and blowing up rooms that's full of strangers. A news anchor, the youth can relate to, it's nature. If you're a hater, I'll deal with you later, no thank you. I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors. Really doe, come on homie, we major. I waste away in this room spitting out raps. Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back. [Hook]. [Outro: Ab-Soul]. It's just a different time, man. it's just a different time. There was a time, when we showed love. You know like how we, approach a young lady. you see a beautiful young lady you like. you say ""Damn, man. "" You're gorgeous. I'll take off my coat right now. and lay it down on the puddle. and make sure you don't miss a step. You know what I'm talking bout, young man?. See all these bitches, hoes, thots?.

I think I'm in love. So I guess we'll have to see. Uh, look, there's just something about her caramel skin. And how her chest look in every single bra she in. And got me with her every single day out the week. We don't even hit the streets; we just stay in the sheets. Those brown eyes got me trapped. Kiss her on her stomach when she lies on her back. She got class, cry and she laugh for dime with her abs. Drinking wine by the glass. No other girl can make me hers. It's whoever wanna take me first. And she grabbed me, wouldn't let me go. Usually you're hard like an Eskimo, cold. But she said there's something about me. That she don't want no loving without me. Skin so soft like I'm touching some downy. Girl I think I'm in love. I think I'm in love. But I don't really know what love is. Ahaaa. I think I'm in love. Cause I be going crazy off one kiss. I think I'm in love. She prob'ly ain't in love with me. I think I'm in love. So I guess we'll have to see. Look, check my phone, always text me when she wake up. Sex is real great always messing up her make up. No clothes on, loving to a slow song. Everyone tellin' us, this thing we have is so wrong. And she don't care whatever goes on. Plus she's best friends with my mom. Keep a journal, you all know the story. No, the superficial type, love her horoscopes. And I'm a Capricorn, that she ain't never had before. Her ex hates me cause he ain't me that's for sure. She got this look she give that send him running. She so stunning, got my heart jumping (jumping). And my mind is all twisted. Her lips is delicious for kisses. I got her heart on my wish list. Manager get rid of business. I think I'm in love. Aha. But I don't really know what love is. I think I'm in love. Cause I be going crazy off one kiss. I think I'm in love. She prob'ly ain't in love with me. I think I'm in love. So I guess we'll have to see. So this bitch, really hit me like. How did you get so lucky?. You know what, I said bitch.

i'll be there,"Sunshine or rain, I'll be there. For the good times or bad, I'll be there. Sunshine or rain, I'll be there. For the good times or bad, I'll be there. Hey, hey, see I was six years old with a dream, when my mums told me I can do anything. Said she'd be there forever, no matter what's the weather. She'd always have my back even when we weren't together. And I took her for granted, thought I had a plan. This a different generation, I don't think you'd understand. In the quest to be a man, you start to learn you need your family. It wasn't for them, I'd be way closer to insanity. It ain't about the vanity, think bout what's important. The reason I was six years old rocking some Jordans. The reason I had food, my own damn room. A TV and a living room to watch my cartoons. I just hope she know I love her, the world's best mother. Yeah ain't fair, so I'm a take care of her and her gray hair. When I get rich, I'll have her living how she should be. No stress, no worries, you can call me cause. Sunshine or rain, I'll be there. For the good times or bad, I'll be there. Sunshine or rain, I'll be there. For the good times or bad, I'll be there. Hey, hey, hey. Dear mama, please don't start to cry. You the reason I'm alive how these years have gone by. You were there when I was on my first bike riding in the street. That delivery truck almost ran right over me. You were at my games when I was sitting on the bench. When I skipped school, you lied saying I was home sick. Had my back before I had my own. I know I'm always welcome when I'm back at home. I just wanna bring you out on stage to get a standing ovation. All the work you did to make my life feel like a vacation. If you have your moms, you better treat her right. Call her up, say wassup before you sleep tonight. Tell her you love her and thank her for what she did. You may be grown now but remember being a kid when she fed you, shit. You were her baby, so find out what she doing lately, uh. I wanna tell you momma. Sunshine or rain, I'll be there. For the good times or bad, I'll be there. Sunshine or rain, I'll be there. For the good times or bad, I'll be there. . Digo Yukio - @_digopanda"
i'm not real (feat. earl sweatshirt),"[Verse 1: Mac Miller]. Passport, filling it up with stamps. Set a camp up on my land, swam the rivers of Japan. She keep on asking for a rack so I ran. Looking back, like you can't see who I am. Think my bitch don't know me no more. Cause everytime she's sad, I can't console her no more. If money buy you love, then love's not enough. So tell my why you on your knees crying to the floor. If you had the chance. Would you take the time you need to make it right?. The clouds are gray. But would you pay the price to paint 'em white?. Might have a baby on the way, cause I been going in raw. It feels better, that real pleasure. I'm not real, I think I never was. I get a rush every time she let me get a touch. I need to feel that (love) I need to feel that (pain). My garden hasn't been growing, so can you bring that. (rain). I keep my head up (high) A little fed up (lies). They always tell me where my mind is on this Lp. I don't exist, hieroglyphics. Pyrotechnics, metaphysics. Telekinetics put 50k on my credit card. Look for the answers, I'm searching but I ain't getting far. Let's get it on, I'm royal like Tenenbaums in Lebanon. Decepticons, hit it 'til my head is gone. [Hook: Earl Sweatshirt]. Point me to the road, and I'mma run it. Bloodhound with my nose to the money. Ain't fucking with these hoes (never that). Getting duckets 'til I die, while my foes busy running. Fuck it, marijuana smoke in my stomach. toasted in public. Head in the clouds and my toes in the struggle. Like who didn't test yet? Test this. There's a few new rules in effect, bitch (go). [Verse 2: Mac Miller]. See this a rather spooky action movie. roll it up and pass it to me. Hash and booty, absolutely, smack a groupie. acting bourgie. See a creature, ass beauty, need a feature. rather shoot me. Truly bitches must have them bad jeans. and back is Coogi. Had to do these rapper tunes. to let 'em know the trap is booming. Past the views of Catholic schoolers, fact. but you in fact assuming. Back to doing cash pursuing. posted up like Patrick Ewing. Rapper feuds are sad. if you would battle for a stack or two. These eloquent irrelevant sentences. show my penmanship. Indefinite boundaries show you the end of it. Don't forget you infested in nasty crevices. Allowing birds to fall to their death before they even fly. He and I are not the same. Doctor, doctor, please prescribe me. something for the pain. Money in machines, those will make you change. If I go tomorrow, I just hope it ain't in vain. but I can't complain. [Hook]"

To put the workin' in. I'm certain that I'm flirtin' with the fame. For failure gettin' jealous throwin' dirt up on my name. It's burnin' up my brain but I'm workin' through the pain. Cause life's hard til you learn it's just a game. Play your cards, use your letters on your scrabble board. If you smart put your heart into your rappin' more. No money? Why the fuck you countin' for?. A thousand chores try to get up my allowance more. Incompatible. (But still they say). It don't matter no. (I just tell 'em I'm a do me, ya know?). Cause someone's bound to hear my cries. (Hater can hate). Speak out if you do. (But I'm a make music. Period). You're not easy to find. Incompatible. (The High Life). It don't matter no. (What?).

My old chick is old news. But add fuel to fire, what I won't do. So, I just kick it with the homies like I'm supposed to. And we go back like old hoops. Well, this the cold cold feeling. Bone chillin', borderline dope dealing. I'm going up with no ceiling, shit. Out of body, got my soul swimming. And no different, good head keep my toes twitching. You know Larry been fishing since he in the womb. This the scoop up the Big Dipper, you the little spoon. Went from invisible to minuscule. To invincible, dancing with the business moves. I made a million and it killed me. My second million got me mothafucking filthy. You ain't nothing till you die and come back to life iller. They haven't made a mothafucker realer, Mr. Miller, yeah"

Hey, we came to get down, have a good time. Bring the champagne out and the good wine. We gon’ be sippin’ and whippin’ the sickest whips. Spittin’ the illest shit that’s sicker than syphilis. Comin’ in the back door yeah a f-ck a list. Fans taking pictures while I’m tryna take a piss. We came to party they didn’t come to give a shit. Now sing this part, it goes like this. [Hook: x2]. All my people in the front. Go and clap your hands. Go and clap your hands. Everybody in the back. Go and clap your hands. Go and clap your hands. If you’re feeling that funk. Go and clap your hands. Go and clap your hands. If you love it like that. Go and clap your hands. Go and clap your hands. [2nd Verse]. H-h-h-h-hold up. Everyday they wanna ask me when I’m grow up.

matches (feat. ab-soul),"(Verso 1: Ab-Soul). Ever since a nigga had recess. Motherfucker felt like a grown-up (Soulo). Momma come and bitch about a curfew. I was still playing round the corner. 7 years old saw my first porno. Damn that fucked me up. At 10 I bust my first nut. On this older ho gut, but so what. Let's recap, the earth spinning too rabbit. I'm living too fast, sin is a habit. I can't hack, fornicate, act this rabid. One bean short of an acid tablet. Security guards spark my cigarettes. The old head go 'head and cop me a brew. Sometimes them Koreans be cool. These shades make me look 22. They say you learn when you get older. I just say that that ain't true. That just means when you was younger. You ain't get turnt up like us, fool. Just got L's so I'm riding high. Still in high school, but I do. Everything I will do. When I'm 25, no lie. (Verso 2: Mac Miller). I was young with ambition. Fucked around with these hoes. Never needed permission. Went and lived the life that I chose. Premonition-type visions, you see the world as it goes. Tell them all what they missing. While I watch as it unfolds. I'm dodging my death. Confident kid, I was trying to grow up with the best. Watching my step. Never know college but could find me. nodding off always on test-day. I coulda been a great graduate. Woulda got one of them hoes from the Bachelor. Coulda been smart. Coulda been a doctor. Life full of drama, little soap opera. Falling in love, like she would've caught ya. Almost got her knocked up, would've been a father. All about energy, make good memories. I'm the fucking Dalai Lama. Only 18 but I got my own business. Then I got fame like what the fuck is this. Whole bunch of cameras, fake ass bitches. Everyone around wanna treat me all different. Oh I'm cool, cause I got money. Back in high school none of the hoes was trying to fuck me. I thought it was a conspiracy. Sometimes my thoughts are scaring me. You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets. They, they, they was looking for somebody like me. Big bag of weed and a money heist scheme. Something brand new, wonder what it might be. Coughing off them drugs, moving at a nice speed. If you're 18 years and older. 18 years and older. If you're 18 years and older. 18 years and older. (Ab-Soul). I will rule the world. Take care of my family and take care of my girl. Plant a couple seeds, blaze a gang of trees. Went to see a rated R movie about me. They said you must be. 18 years and older"

I hear these kids and they trying to spit. But they sound so ass and I am the shit. No you got nothing on me boy. (not not not nothing on me boy, not nothing on me). You got nothing on me boy. (not not not nothing on me boy, not nothing on me). They tell their friends that they're gonna blow. Once they on the stage everybody go home. No you got nothing on me boy. (not not not nothing on me boy, not nothing on me). You got nothing on me boy. (not not not nothing on me boy, not nothing on me). . Digo Yukio - digopanda"

I kill flows, think I need that tear on a tattoo. My bitch suck, she a vacuum. Fuck her in the ass every time I'm in a bad mood. Ain't got a choice, know she do it cause she have to. I hit it raw while I'm listening to Papoose. No respect cause you wear a V-neck. I mean stress, pressure that could even make Keith sweat. I wish Narnia was on a GPS. I wish Rihanna was DTF. I got rich with these rap songs. Bought a drug problem, now the cash gone. Album filled with all sad songs. But this the one that I can laugh on. (Refrão: Tyler, The Creator).

Little momma got salty at me, she started talking tough. So I called the Wolf Gang up, they start to bark it up. Popped a hundred mollies, fixed sherm, think I was sparking up. A bottle of Zima, the Beamer, I started parking up. Seen my nigga, Mac, and he hopped in the back. And then we jet to Fatburger, ordered some Big Macs. And bitch came with a gauge, and she wanted my fade. But I'm a bitch-ass nigga so I say. (Refrão: Tyler, The Creator). Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac. Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac. Get 'em. Girl, shake that body.

Drink cocoa then double-team Mariah. But please, don't tell Nick. We were all watching movies at a Motel 6. Like ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. I hope Kendrick fuck Gaga. If Madonna on the Kabbalah. Then me and Snoop could chill and be Rastas. I don't need Prada to show you I'm rich. Pulling out the llama like, ""show me your tits"". Keep crying cause I still ain't over my bitch. Oh well.

objects in the mirror,"(Verso 1). People love you when they on your mind. A thought is love's currency. And I been thinking about her all the time. I've never seen somebody put together perfectly. What would I have to do to call you mine. Someone like you is so hard to find. You can open up your eyes or you can walk it blind. All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you don't you worry. Listen to me, I'mma set you free. Yeah, he ain't gonna break your heart again. Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy. When, your imagination's on pretend. I never thought that it would feel this way. You, never taught me how to heal the pain. I, wish you caught me on a different day. When it was easier to be happy. (Refrão). Just a little taste and you know she got you. Can you hide away, can you hide away. Sound of silence as they all just watch you. I kinda find it strange. How the times have changed. But I wish, we could go and be free, once. Baby, you and me. We could change the world forever. And never come back again. Is leave it all in the rear-view. Is leave it all in the rear-view, girl. You don't have to cry. You don't have to cry. (Verso 2). And mend a broken heart girl if you can. Don't expect you to be capable. You got the world right in your hands. And that responsibility is unescapable. I promise that I'll be a different man. Please give me the chance to go and live again. I'm having some trouble can you give a hand. It seems perfection really is unattainable. Don't even say you about to end it all. Your life precious ain't a need to go and kill yourself. I ain't so sure that there's an end at all. I wish the truth would just reveal itself. Who do you call to make it to the top. And, who do you call to make the shootin' stop. And who do you call to give the coup a wash?. After everything I did I think I'm still myself. (Refrão). Just a little taste and you know she got you. Can you hide away, can you hide away. Sat in silence as they all just watch you. I kinda find it strange. How the times have changed. But I wish, we could go and be free, once. Baby, you and me. We could change the world forever. And never come back again. Is leave it all in the rear-view. Is leave it all in the rear-view, girl. You don't have to cry. You don't have to cry"
of the soul,"Uh, uh, looks like guy, produce song on paper. First time I did that in like two years. My handwriting is horrible and I can barely read this. Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore though. Figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso. Fucking girls but I never kept the door closed. Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso. I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane. I guess it's the result of drugs that entering my brain. All the sudden every legend keep on mentioning my name. All that doesn't show me that my life would never be the same. Police try and figure out how to get me locked up. I tell those cops suck dog nuts. Arriving to the party in the chariot. Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit. I'm very sick, yes very ill. Eternal sunshine, Jim Carrey feel. At the amusement park scared of heights: ferris wheel. Double dare me to kill?. Got some soul like De La Do, they say I'm new. It's nothing but some déjà vu. Everywhere you go these people hate on you. Déjà vu, déjà vu. I little soul like De La Do, they say I'm new. It's nothing but some déjà vu. Everywhere you go these people hate on you. Déjà vu, déjà vu. Wind chimes, sick rhymes, been high, on this incline. Tryna get my money stackin' tall, six nine. Have some caviar, sip wine. Sacrifice insanity, sacrifice normal. Purpose is for people in the plural. Form never formal, an art form, not a mural. Work for bars that are tighter than your corn rows. See a girl that's lookin' horny in the 4th row. Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho. Dontist, manipulating phonics, put em into sonnets. Let me put you on this nastier than nas is. Bubonic plague, bacteria that's tryna to find a way. Spread, like yolk from a broken egg. Talkin' shit? You just diggin' your grave. Got some soul like De La Do, they say I'm new. It's nothing but some déjà vu. Everywhere you go these people hate on you. Déjà vu, déjà vu. I little soul like De La Do, they say I'm new. It's nothing but some déjà vu. Everywhere you go these people hate on you. Déjà vu, déjà vu. Hypothetically I'm dope, I kick incredibly. Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy. No methamphetamines, hot, one hundred ten degrees. Visually stunnin', you gotta see it on the LED. When I was seventeen I thought I had it figured out. Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route. It's crucial, three new schools, life with a spoonful. Of sugar, yeah, I need my medicine. Fuckin Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president. Represent, all these fuckin' people that I never met. Some expect, me to be the greatest ever. Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever. Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations. I'mma be the best, have some patience. Thought that it was great, then poof. It was nothing but some déjà vu. . Digo Yukio - @_digopanda"

You take a buck from me, better duck dummy. Im with my man Skyzoo, is the class clown of his high school. Dround you in typhoons, hittin' you with rhymes too. Haters keeps they eyes glued, pound if you my dude. We stay high like Einstein's IQ. And ya'll muther fuckas know where I'm comin from. Chewin' cats up, like a little peice of bubble gum. Tryin double sum's, hustle, wanna let my money run. I ain't even battling dude, I'm having fun with it. Jokes make him feel wrong in his own skin. Sippin gin from a bin that's makin' my dome spin. And your the type that'd try to take from your own kin. Feel it close on your toes, hangin from clothes pins. I'm spittin blades, God damn it, my tooth hurts. I'm out feelin' with a bunch of cancerous tumors. Yup, music's my baby, I ain't gonna, lose her. So I stay with the radio, like Cuba Gooding Junior. [Hook]. Who you think could bother me lyrically?. In the middle of Alaska I bring the heat. My worst verse hot as your best ryhm, Damn. The pen game insane. Who you think could bother me lyrically?. In the middle of Alaska I bring the heat.

And in the blink of an eye I'm on the kings page. But no album, this is all for the mixtapes. In a different lane, no signs of road rage,. Ain't no body over here to rage quit, so no gains. No sleep, no retreat, no surrender, no apologies from me. I'm the pen of the penners. I mean what I speak, so if I given you a sentence. Then it bez what it bez, nothing hit on the agenda. You leave it up to me, and you can divy up the team. Put your pride in end and I'm dismember your limbers. The harder the city, the starting point guard,. That can play up to the fall. So the parts is all gone, no room on the bench. And I got a no trade clause, so I'm here long haul no switchin. [Hook]. [Verse 3: Mac Miller]. Look, I rip mics to piece cook em or eat em raw. I was bustin freestyles before I could read it all. MCs just call me the monster in their mind. that haunt them all the time. And they thought if they could ryhm they. could make the situation a lil diffrent then the present. See, I fucked this track, worried thought I got her pregnant. I'm haulin ass, yall is whack, taking out the garbage trash. Duckin from these sharks n crabs, giving MCs heart attacks. Its yo boy Mac, damn Im great, and you guessed,. no love like a man with aids.

I'm just trying to leave the crib go out and live the night, shit. Fuck that, I'm locked in the lab working. Dropping the track beats, get bodied and bags certain. See the world through first, second and third person, omniscient. Listening so efficient. Trapped in my own goal line ready to go the distance. Consider it a privilege. That what you get to witness.

perfect circle / god speed,"[Intro]. Woo-ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh. [Verse 1]. (Fuck you). I came for whoever is in charge. I suggest you go and get yourself a weapon and a guard. They need some coffee, everybody's sleeping on me. Going around door to door, setting off alarms. All that horse shit, you should have left it at the barn. Keep a stallion, tell her gallop. to the store and get cigars, yeah. Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made. I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase. Me and my bizarre ways (no emergency). I moved up from a Private to a Sergeant. You can see it from a scar face. Hidden in a dark place, swimming in the shark tank. Give a bitch a little bit of change. she a game in an arcade. (Time crisis) Not a second to lose. I'm the motherfuckin' Bible, that's forever the truth. And this is not another case of the celebrity blues. The devil with me and he tell me to shoot. [Hook]. Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?. Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do. Can you draw a perfect circle?. Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options. what do you do?. I wash these pills down with liquor and fall. Leave it to me, I do enough for us all (I do). Got what you need if you like breaking the law. My mother raised me a God (Hey). (Fuck you). [Verse 2]. Yeah, blame the drugs, got me sinning on the weekday. Drunk as fuck, doing buck sixty on the freeway. Giving y'all the freebase. hidden in the middle of a briefcase. Hidden in a subwoofer, beat case. Used to wanna know how a freak taste. Now I'm in it in an instant like replay. Bras a baton, pass it off like relay. Why I'm so mad on my B-Day?. She say ""I thought you got sober"". And I say ""I wish you'd stop being a bitch. And get to minding your business"". Told me ""Money has changed you"". I get to thinking, how rarely do I visit?. How'd I get so egotistical? I'm a Buffalo Soldier. Heaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer. I'm only twenty-three but my mind is older. and it'll forever be. Dead presidents to the homies, death to my enemies. [Hook]. Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?. Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do. Can you draw a perfect circle?. Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options. what do you do?. I wash these pills down with liquor and fall. Leave it to me, I do enough for us all. Got what you need if you like breaking the law. My mother raised me a God (Hey). (Fuck you). [Bridge: Ab-Soul & Mac Miller]. A goddess told me? good morning? when I woke up. (Fuck you). You know I had a good morning when I woke up. (Fuck you). Gotta thank God every morning then I woke up. (Fuck you). Would you remember me if I never woke up?. Bye bye (Fuck you). I've been a sinner, I'm just tryna stay. Warm through winter, and I'll be on my way. I'm just a drifter, in endless seas of whispers. I just need some shelter, give me shelter from the wind. [Refrain]. Woo-ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh. Woo-ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh. [Interlude: Transition]. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice. message system 412-9?. *buttons dialed* is not available. [Miller Mccormick]. Hey man, I wish you were here, happy holidays. uhm, I love ya. And I hope you have a good night. weekend I hope I talk to you soon. alright, godspeed?. [Part 2: God Speed]. [Verse 1]. Oh yeah, I thought I'd have it figured out by now. Shit would be simple. problems would be in the past by now. Me and the homies would be sitting on millions. Reminiscing on times. when we were so broke and living in Oakland just chillin'. I thought I'd have it in the bag by now. I thought that we'd be kicking back by now. I know that life is a bitch, I know that life is a bitch. I thought we'd put her in a cab by now. But I'm stressing, I can't relax. I swallow my pride and I'm hiding what's making me mad. Everybody say I need rehab. Cause I'm speedin' with a blindfold on. and won't be long 'til they watching me crash. And they don't wanna see that. They don't want me to Od and have to talk to my mother. Telling her they could have done more to help me. and she'll be crying saying. that she'll do anything to have me back. All the nights I'm losing sleep, it was all a dream. there was a time that I believed that. But white lines be numbing them dark times. Them pills that I'm popping, I need to man up. Admit it's a problem, I need a wake up. Before one morning I don't wake up. You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya. I'm too obsessed with going down as a great one. But if you wait too long, they go find someone. to replace ya. So I guess this is a letter, to all my brothers. Most Dope, that's forever. I love you more than words could express. And this the part that Q start crying, if he ain't already yet. I did my best to be a leader you respect. At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret. So tell my baby I love her. And if she give me the chance. I'll put a seed inside her, make her a mother. Just know that there's a place. Where all my people worry free and everybody straight. Every devil don't got horns. and every hero ain't got capes. Opened up my eyes, shit, I'm finally awake. Good morning. Yeah, good morning. [Interlude: Outro]. Yo Vin, it's the morning, you gotta go to work. ""alright"". Yo, you gotta be at work in like ten minutes, yo. (You good?). ""I'm straight, yo what's good? "" (when you going?). You gotta pick up the dry cleaning and shit still?. ""man, fuck that shit, I'll skip"". You bout to go to work?. ""mm"". Ight, what time you gotta be at work?. ""I don't know"". soon?. You Democrat or Republican?. ""Uuhh""I don't know anymore?. Would you vote for a female president?. ""I don't care what gender or race you are"""

Uncontrollable behavior. with some psychopathic tendencies. Lonely as your neighbors with the bitches. he got special needs. Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy. My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe. They got my soul, but I don't let 'em take the rest of me. My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly. And my denim tailored, me and Action rapping. Al be fucking with the fader, sipping mind eraser. Actually, we rapping for the fuck of it. Taking money from you, gonna smack you out in public. We the Republican government. abundance of substance. Having consumption to fuck a bitch. You're Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick. And your bitch looking like Cousin Itt, the ugliest. [Hook: Action Bronson]. I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit. Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick. Cadillacs is getting whipped a hundred eighty fifth. Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle. [Mac Miller]. I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit. Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit. They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead. So how'd I get this red dot on my head?. [Verse 2: Action Bronson]. Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first. After rapping take my people out for octopus. We all deserve it; dedication to the fam. Don't hold your hand out for nothing. if you claim to be my man, damn.

Understand I'm only rhyming for this son of mine. And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils. We ate the tuna, it's suede puma. My look is Jay Buhner, dawggy. cause some of us just age sooner. I'm still twisted, rocking lizards from a strange river. Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver. Check the bio, I fixed the game. Between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio, I been wild. [Hook]. [Verse 3: Mac Miller]. Bitch I'm nodding off, I'm hot as wasabi sauce. And constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance. I was a minor, chasing after vagina. None of my friends were fake. but none of my clothes designer. Went from posted on stoops to smoking on roofs. I came from that basement, now look at this view. Making this money, blowing it all. Fuck what you did, just show me results. [Verse 4: Action Bronson]. Yo, I'm a 635 dipper, fly mothafucka. Leather to the foot, horses I lead 'em to the brook. If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book. I see a lion in the mirror when I look. Look, I lose money but I make it back. I keep it true and ain't no mothafuckin' faking that. I get a fade and then I fade to black. Bet on the Razorbacks. I hold the multi-colored flavored gat. Blat. [Bridge: Mac Miller].

Slash cap peeler, back with a black stripper. Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker. too fat to snap zippers"". In half is what I'll do to Mac Miller. Now my minds first track figured. A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir. Taps liquor the pass 'til it. Goes around the room like his casket finna. Oh, you Mac Miller?. The fact's filtered in the snapped picture. My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper. Yoohoo, I'm finna murder this brunette bitch. Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture. A rap figure to look like you hacked Twitter. I'll show you Beastie Boy. You can't match your killer with that wigger. I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Thriller. He got track fillers for a album. If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker. Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from, Malcolm. I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King. You're from a home of funny bones. Not like quite the one I've known. You look like, before you punched in flows. You were strucking blows, bloody nose. for your honey rolls. In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole. You're a bully's Best Day Ever. With those Nike's on your feet. Coming through Blue Slide Park. I'm gon' rob this chump. On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump. Nigga give me that shit.

You'll remeber shit you've forgot. Cus way back then I didn't know shit. And I don't know shit now. And when the whole world is looking hopeless. I'mma still hold shit down. (Refrão).

Never understand until you have to stand alone. Can I have a hand to hold?. A Band-Aid for my damaged soul, I paint the planet gold. I swear I'm Michelangelo, I don't understand you so. They didn't want a man when he was down and broke. But now they know me and what I don't need. No Six, no Beamers, no Benz. That's just the way that we are. You and me, swimming freaks here we are.

I might trip, I never fall. God know's I've came close (no, son, this ain't home). I know I probably need to do better. Fuck whoever, keep my shit together. You never told me being rich was so lonely. Nobody know me, oh well. Hard to complain from this five star hotel. I'm always in a rush. I've been thinking too much, but. Keep it on the hush, no one need to know, just us. That's really all it takes. We don't need nothing but today (today, today, today, today).

It's cold in my veins, I'm below freezing, snow season (made me). They know that I so need my space. Don't wanna grow old, so I smoke just in case. She say that I glow below the waist. And a stroke is just so Pga. All I got is a little bit of space and time. Drawing shapes and lines of the world we made. Tomorrow may be right around the corner. But I swear it's gon be worth it if I make it, babe. There's somewhere above, you keep reaching up. That's really all it takes (that's really all it takes).

I can feel my fingers slippin', in a motherfuckin' instant I'll be gone. Do you want it all if it's all mediocre?. Staring at the wall and the wall's full of posters. Lookin' at my dreams, who I wanna be. I guess you gotta see it to believe. Oh, I been a fool, but that's cool, that's what human beings do. Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes. Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed. But the sun's coming out now, clouds start to move. Don't tell me nothing but the truth. I'm tired, I don't gotta spare a second. Win or lose, win or lose. I don't keep count, nobody checkin'"

And that's what ima do until I'm richer than bill gates. It ain't all about money for me though. I do this for the people who need a boost in their ego. Work a lot, I'm an addict not a fiend though. Get up, get out, and get somethin', word to cee lo. Bottles of cleco, a couple of cristal. May head to l.a like I'm chris paul. Bout to go platinum off of ""missed calls"". So all of y'all can lick balls. Yeahh. Just you know. Run from the dark. Into the light. You know, you know you're gona find your way out. Run from the dark. Into the light. Oh woah, you know you're gona find your way. That's right, into the sunlight. That's right, into the sunlight. That's right, into the sunlight. That's right, into the sunlight. . .

suplexes inside of complexes and duplexes (feat. jay electronica),"Might as well introduce. this is madness!. this is an outrage. as a matter of fact, this is outrageous. yeah, young sire, slap the fuck out Jon Cryer. rough rider, raw bust inside a vagina. like I want kids, my head continues to be haunted. I burn a city down while I'm unconscious, baby go on. take some quaaludes, conversate with Jesus. batting practice with the motherfucking ghost of Babe Ruth. do as a saint do, turn painful to graceful. devil on my trails, I'm trying to find the Holy Grail. [coughing] Right there. and if Mars is the farthest that man has set his target. then I don't know why I even started. I'm sick of being too nice to people who don't do shit but consume light. told myself, ""fuck the world kid, just do what you like"". go and have a food fight, start yourself a new life. you're too bright to be inside a bunch of mediocrity. but all those big words ain't gonna get you paid. and those abstract ideas for sure won't get you laid. you got it made in that mad house. what the fuck you got to be sad about? Go ahead and rap now. do what you do best, I mean. that's what you do best, matter fact motherfucker. you suit vest, you need to buy a new dress. I heard you and your girl live in a duplex. I'ma put her ass in a Suplex, the sun east, the moon west. you got a clue, what does a clue get?. nothing. my milk and honey, my chérie-chérie amore. my Cinderella in her carriage by the doorway. her ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow. and the lion through the forest. to the wicked witch's fortress where she scorched them in the foreplay. remember that? He said he'd fight the box to see the wizard. when he was visited by Dorothy who came here on a blizzard. now the whole world's in color, still. how Auntie Em was next of kin and not her mother. real, her face was care-worn. I suspected she migrated to Kansas up from Dearborn. and had beef with Mrs. Gulch since the very beginning of Year One. mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic. the poetry's like the poems and songs of Ecclesiastes. lightning should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet. the Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet. and yell ""hear, hear"", finally some order to this rap shit. finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips. I keep my shit crispy and elegant. so miss me with the irrelevant, the god body is heaven-sent. the hard-body is reverence, since the son of Byford. brother of Fal, every rhyme's halal. every line is kosher, livin' la vida loca. shout out to Tony Toca, we livin' how we supposed to"

the festival (feat. little dragon),"[Intro]. Yeah, yeah. Let me get a little bit more beat. Yeah. [Verse: Mac Miller]. Ask God if she believe in me. and will she accept me as a deity. And tell me the secrecy won't keep you free. I'm sleeping, won't dream until the demons leave. I took a nap, I need a tree in the shade. Feel the sharpness of the swords and blades of grass. Picturing the images that make you laugh. I left you out to die, but will you take me back?. Somewhere in between the crazy and the conscious. She's naked underneath them shadows. Let the sunlight undress her slow. I don't know who I am. I'm so good at doing impressions though. I'm going to the festival, the festival need to let me go. I wake up, pop a couple Benadrylls, go back to sleep. So I made up, everything they said was real, it has to be. Cause actually the master fast asleep. And the castles back back in his private quarters. That's a master for you, this a revolution. we don't have no order. All this torture, thought I had to warn you. Leave it all behind and go to California. I'm past the signs, it's the real thing. try analyzing this feeling. You can't fathom. [Bridge: Yukimi Nagano of Little Dragon]. My hands are ahead the clouds. From the clap-clap thunder looking down. While you're running around. I lift you up when you drown. Unlock the mission, the planet in rotation. Full speed chasing and you're always running ahead. You're always running ahead. You got second chances, happy birthday. sweet romances. And you battle like a champion, why. Do you wanna go, do you wanna go. do you wanna go to the festival. You got angels, we can see them dripping from the sky. You watch 'em with your third eye. Do you wanna go, do you wanna go. do you wanna go to the festival. To the festival. [Outro]. Hola, Malcolm. Hey man, it's Luis man. I'm calling, man, to tell you about the album. I listened. it's good. I need to tell you, man. I tell everyone to listen to the music. and it sound like they like it, man. It sound like it good. I tell my wife ""I'm so proud of him. ""I tell my girlfriend ""I'm so proud of him. "". And the album is good. It's so good. I cannot believe it. No one can beat you"
the finer things,"Yeah, Mac Miller, ayy. Uh, you know the finer things in life, you know. Sometimes you gotta kick back and enjoy that shit. Look, relax. Ahaa, I like sittin' in shotgun, deuce on a L. Parents not carin' cause they used to the smell. Classy Ass Women, fresh Ass linen. Hot summer days with a pool I can swim in. A good spot to kick it, a case of fourties. Them homies always havin' good stories. The beer bottles with the twist off caps. When old people tell you that they listen to rap. I love days I can sleep in, full day weekends. Hoes puttin' they clothes back on, you peekin'. Blunt rise, with a mixtape bumpin'. I love makin' love in public. And when the hip-hop legend tour comin' to your town. Findin' a crispy ass twenty on the ground. Walkin' when the sun out, watchin' Run's House. Or action movies when the villain pull the gun out. The best things in life is the free ones. The little things everybody need some. The finer things make you feel better. But no one ever seem to remember. The best things in life is the free ones. The little things everybody need some. The finer things make you feel better. But no one ever seem to remember. I like sleepin' in class and cheatin' to pass. Hoes walkin' in the halls and you reach for they ass. Fast food lines when they movin' so quickly. When your weed man hit you with some sticky. Street performers, warmin' up the corners. Sellin' by the ounce, then pinch it by the quarter. With some kicks on sell. Wakin' up in the mornin' with a shit load of mail. The wake up to bake up, chillin while you face blunts. Goin' in blowed for your shape up, like say what?. Blog put your tape up, get a good review. When dumbass people tell you what you shouldn't do. When she rub my head while I'm between her knees. Gettin love from the people overseas. Haters tryin' to hate, but they got nothin' to say. It's just the little things that get me through the day. The best things in life is the free ones. The lil things everybody need some. The finer things make you feel better. But no one ever seem to remember. The best things in life is the free ones. The lil things everybody need some. The finer things make you feel better. But no one ever seem to remember. Like I said before, it's your boy, Mac Miller. They tryin' to tell me I couldn't do this beat. Know what I said? I didn't say nothin'. I just went in the booth and did it. Somebody tell Will to get some malt liquor next time. Ahaa.... . Digo Yukio - digopanda"

I hit the ocean floor inside a slut. disintegrated to the finest dust, I'm out, nigga. like that"
the miller family reunion,"Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill. It's a muthafuckin barbeque for real. All these days already gone by. Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time. Put a little gin in the punch. Grandma getting crunked, just fine. Nobody give a fuck. All these days already gone by. Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time. The door's open, I might as well just stroll in. Got some arnie palmer in my pitcher: call it nolan. Ryan, try it once and then you go there. I am hoping that we can kick it. Reminiscing only about the good times. I know there's moments. When you probably love me but you didn't wanna show it. Now I'm all around the globe. With everyone but you. I know you fuckin miss me. Chill and keep it cool! never getting old mane. Grown, no rogaine. boy you play with all that food. You better eat the whole thing!. It's a family reunion, all the grandmas be moving. Running in 3-legged races people would cry if they losing. When I was 2, my fly was blue. When I was gone, my ice cream cone was a giant wand. When my, bike was all I was riding on. Jewelry from a happy meal, fuck it I was happy still. Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill. It's a muthafuckin barbeque for real. All these days already gone by. Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time. Put a little gin in the punch. Grandma getting crunked, just fine. Nobody give a fuck. All these days already gone by. Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time. Come and, step inside the electric slide. Spraying squirt guns at you like it's pesticides. So why you buggin'... lil man stop bugging.... I gotta, spend some time, with some friends of mine. Get away from everything, go and rest your mind. It's not nothing... lil man it's not nothing.... All my little cousins acting like some munchkins. Running in the trees and they're crying out their eyes. Have to rush em to the er - maybe just a band-aid will do it. You can sing along please, let the band play the music. Always nice when you come back home. Your friends go up but then they come back grown. Nice to know that you're never alone. Family reunions whenever I'm home.... Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill. It's a muthafuckin barbeque for real. All these days already gone by. Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time. Put a little gin in the punch. Grandma getting crunked, just fine. Nobody give a fuck. All these days already gone by.

the mourning after,"Morning after, my lungs hurt. Eat your pussy just to show you how my tongue works. Its funny how we fuck but fell in love first. Been three years, I wish I finally trust her. She make me feel like how them drugs work. Itchin' from my fixture when she go and love hurts. I just get a temper, I just need somebody I can vent to. Someone get me stoned, be my emma. Left your lipstick on the glass of your daquairi. Ruby red usually end up tragically. Work of art, you can be my masterpiece. But you fast asleep. Something 'bout the pain. Makes me want more. Done a lotta drugs. Never felt like this before. I hope one day it all makes sense. It'll all make sense. You can have it all. Tell me what you need. Believin' all them silly things you read. I hope one day it all makes sense. One day it'll all make sense. Uhh now she wake up. Cryin' while she puttin' on her makeup. Trapped inside her love for me. And no escape for her. You wanna leave say the word. But she can't. Lookin' in my eyes. Is everything okay, she lies. Put on her disguise, play it safe. 'cuz we've been fightin' for the past three weeks. She keep this one inside, she don't wanna seem weak. Strong, baby tell me what's been goin' on. I don't wanna be so alone. So you gotta get me high again. I got all this money we could try to spend. Until we strung out like a violin. Come back to life, then we die again. Little angel, where's your halo?. Somewhere above them wars. Something 'bout the pain. Makes me want more. Done a lotta drugs. Never felt like this before. I hope one day it all makes sense. It'll all make sense. You can have it all. Tell me what you need. Believin' all them silly things you read. I hope one day it all makes sense. One day it'll all make sense. You get me high girl, scared of overdose. I don't sleep much, when I do I'm coolin' my toes. May I propose a toast?. Someone usually does, to our fucked up love. You get me high girl, scared of overdose. I don't sleep much, when I do I'm coolin my toes. Propose a toast. Someone usually does, to our fucked up love. Something 'bout the pain. Makes me want more. Done a lotta drugs. Never felt like this before. (inhale noise). You can have it all, tell me what you need. Believin' all them silly things you read. Don't cry, it'll all be over soon"
the question (feat. lil wayne),"Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am. Wonder who the fuck I am. Uhhhh, yeah, want you to feel it. And my voice probably sounds mad raspy right now. I want you all to feel it. So step up on the mic and uhh. Show them what you got tiger. (Mac Miller). Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am. So I've been lookin' in the mirror and it still don't make no sense. I'm askin' what am I supposed to do?. I've done so much in my short lifetime, but I haven't done shit. I done flew around the whole world. First I shook a million hands and I took a million pictures. But I'm a hostage in my own world. And my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches. I got too much on my damn mind. So if I add some more stress, I just don't see how I'ma cope. I think they underestimate the grind. I do, bring this doe, and I'm only twenty years old. I wonder why I sip this devil juice. Cause it feel incredible, problems, I got several. Thank God that none of that medical. Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected. (Chorus). What am I doing here. I wonder what am I doing here. What am I doing here. What am I doing here. (Mac Miller). I hope this feelin' lasts for fuckin' ever. I don't want to come back down, let me stay above the ground. I hope I do what I was meant to do. Cause I've been searching for that answer, I just hope I get it now. Please, let me find euphoria. When you up above the clouds, like, who gonna touch me now. And do we ever get to know the truth. Cause everybody seems to have it, but to me it seems they lack it. Now I'm rolling and I'm sipping lean. Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love. Drinking liquor and I'm smoking weed. And you don't ever do too much if you could never do enough. Wonder why I scream and stare at you. I'll be there to rescue you, problems you got several. Thank God that none of that medical. Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected. (Chorus). What am I doing here. I wonder what am I doing here. What am I doing here. What am I doing here. (Lil Wayne). Uh, sittin' in my Bentley, thinkin' bout these hoes. All I do is kill them, I kill them like Nicole. Simpson, flag crimson, smoke them like Winstons. I just bought a new chopper, I treat it like an infant. I'm lightin' up a stogie, it's longer than a hoagie. Situation's gettin' fishy and I don't eat anchovies. Fuck the world, kill them all, she answer when I call. If the cops pull us over, she gon' hide it in her drawers. See I come from a place where stars never shine. And drama is accepted, credit cards are declined. Everybody gotta die, but I ain't everybody. If that ho play with me, I whoop that chick like Terrence Howard. I'm a pimp, I ain't lyin', but that is not important. I'm just tryna to buy time, but can't really afford it. Saying ain't that a bitch, but I hope that bitch is bad. I feel like money in the trash like. (Chorus). What am I doing here. I wonder what am I doing here. What am I doing here. What am I doing here. . Digo Y. - @_digopanda"

the star room,"[Intro: Delusional Thomas]. Hallelujah, thank God I have a future. Praying I don't waste it getting faded. Cause I'm smoking *censored* 'til I'm coughing up tar. Through the surge, energy curve like a lumbar. I don't act hard, I still read Babar. Tripping out, looking at a bunch of Google map stars. Shit, they got a app for... that. [Verse 1: Mac Miller]. But me, I'm still trapped inside my head. It kinda feel like it's a purgatory. So polite and white. but I got family who would murder for me. Think I'm living paradise, so would I have to worry 'bout?. Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure. Find the perfect style. Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love. All these backfires of my experiments with drugs. And I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form. The difference between love and war inform me. I'm above the norm. But, give me anybody though. I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts. Rhyming like it's summertime on asphalt, hot. Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed. I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up. when my dad calls. Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?. I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice. And I don't know what I'm running from. but I'm running still. I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothing real. I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel. So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fucking deal. Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil. But I want that Rolls Royce. that the homie Lennon drove. So, if you ain't talking 'bout some money. I'mma send you home. Unconventional, special but unprofessional. Adolescent expression. that's letting me meet these centerfolds. As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go. If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow. That's just me all wilding out and being extra doe. [Verse 2: Mac Miller]. And if God was a human. it'd be yours truly, watching horror movies. With some foreign groupies, thinking this decor suits me. I do drugs to get more loopy, I'm in tune. To ancient jujitsu spirituals, it's blissful. Looking out as far as eyes can see. I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet. I think I'm Jfk's final speech. They try assassinating all of my beliefs. But I'm asleep so whisper to me for some peace of mind. And he be high some weed to grind. on top a Jesus shrine. Twenty thousand on my watch cause I needed time. If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine. Can't decide if you like all the fame. Three years ago to now, it's just not the same. I'm looking my window ashing on the pane. Shit, wonder if I lost my way. [Verse 3: Delusional Thomas]. Don't you ever wanna hide away. Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain. Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today. I'll greet the devil with a smiling face. Shit, that God fellow may reside in space. As, time's a wasting I'm freebasing with Freemasons. My girl's switching the locks, the keys keep changing. Dreaming of places, my own personal creations. If there's a party in heaven I plan to leave wasted. Retracing my steps way back to Biblical times. We-we all gon' end up meeting at the finishing line. [Outro: Mac Miller]. And these words that I command you today. shall be in your heat. And you shall teach them diligently to your children. And you shall speak of them when you sit at home. And when you walk along the way. and when you lie down. And when you rise up, I am the lord, your god"

Do my singing in the shower. Picking petals off of flowers like. Do she love me? Do she love me not?. I ain't a player, I just. You give me that kind of something. Want it all the time, need it everyday. On a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred. Never get enough, I can't stay away. If you want, I got it, I got it everyday. You can get whatever you need from me. Stay by your side, I'll never leave you. And I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper. So don't you worry, baby you got me. I got a bad boy, I must admit.

'Cause boy I know just what you like. So If you need it, I got it, I got it everyday. Be your lover and friend, you'll find it all in me. Stay by your side, I'll never leave you.

thoughts from a balcony,"For what's up about dream, turn 'em to reality. Double-cup of lean. Uh, lemme get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination. I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station. Packin' no bags, nothin' but the clothes on my back. Where the Cognac?. Let me sip it, tryin' to relax. Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon. I got army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan. Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on. I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't stayin' long. What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?. I told me story, put my life inside this ink pen. Said I'll make it big when, everybody know me. Well, I made it big and, everybody phony. Haha, so could you pour me, I need a cup. No, none of that liquor, mixin' purple stuff. I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much?. Go head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free. They're just dreams, turn 'em to reality. Double cup of lean, standing on my balcony. Looking at the sky, thinking it could all be mine. All we got is memories. So what the fuck is time?. They're just dreams, turn 'em to reality. Double cup of lean, standing on my balcony. Looking at the street, thinking it could all be mine. All we got is memories. So what the fuck is time?. What the, what the fuck is time?. Ask 'em, what the fuck is time?. I know. What the fuck is time?. I asked 'em, what the fuck is time?. What do you do when you think you could be a icon. Cause all these people get to screamin when the lights on. Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, leave the coat. Racin to the gate but my flight gone. And now these writers takin shots without a Nikon. But I don't fight tho, figured it's a typo. Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though. Potion in my sprite, then my nice slows, down, down. See that's exactly what I need. My khakis filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat. Like it was ""Donald Trump"", a fuckin hit but I just called it luck. They throw it on when I'm walkin in the club. Hey, this some Burgh shit, I don't deserve this. Why I don't think you lookin far beyond the surface. Learn quick now I'm big time, fill your cup up, and I'ma sip mine. Filled up dreams, turn 'em to reality. Double cup of lean, standing on my balcony. Looking at the sky, thinking it could all be mine. All we got is memories. So what the fuck is time?. They're just dreams, turn 'em to reality. Double cup of lean, standing on my balcony. Looking at the street, thinking it could all be mine. All we got is memories. So what the fuck is time?. What the, what the fuck is time?. Ask 'em, what the fuck is time?. I know. What the fuck is time?. I asked 'em, what the fuck is time?. Alright. . Digo Y. e Camila."

time flies (feat. lil b),"[Interlude 1: Lil B]. Time flies, time flies. As we keep living and as we keep being positive. all we can do is hold onto these memories. Mac Miller, I love you. [Verse 1: Mac Miller]. All of my homies used to get on my case like. ""when you gonna kill 'em? "". Soon as I'm out of millions. and my girl sprouts some children. But I've been murderin' the game, almost out of victims. This food for thought usually enough. to feed a thousand pigeons. I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though. Shit bro, would you give it all up for these nymphos?. I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?. Half man and half amazin', but that's just me bein' modest. I'm an honest man, my mama told me never. put it on the lotto and. I work for everything I get that is my motto, fam. So when I die, these bitches. still can fuck my hologram, god... damn. [Bridge: Mac Miller]. And all that drama that you comin' with. you blowin' my high. On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride. I got 'em worried that my mind fried. I'm goin' up before I skydive. [Hook: Mac Miller]. You can see the way that time flies. Time files, try to catch it. Time flies, time flies. Try to catch it. [Interlude 2: Lil B]. Watch as time go, time moves, time flows. How do we handle these things?. I am time, we are time and we have control. One thing we need to remember. is that we are all in this together. [Verse 2: Mac Miller]. You can expect the unexpected. These dreams are manifested from my head into reality. they seems a bit excessive, but. I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings. All the times that I've been reckless. with an ego big as Texas, thinkin' ""I'm the man"". I never let these hoes inside the plan. My room for bullshit in the crib as small as a child's hands. I fill the shoes and walk a path where only giants stand. I am the fire man, shit I'm way too fly to land, yeah. I'm smokin' weed all alone, on the road. Even though I know they need my at home. Keep my control from a city where it's freezin' and cold. Each to their own. punches like this probably beat up Stallone. [Bridge: Mac Miller]. And all that drama that you comin' with. you blowin' my high. On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride. I got 'em worried that my mind fried. I'm goin' up before I skydive. [Hook: Mac Miller]. You can see the way that time flies. Time files, try to catch it. Time flies, time flies. Try to catch it. [Interlude 3: Lil B]. One day we will, we will find, we will conquer. conquer with love. while time is on our side. Continue to hold to those beautiful memories. They won't be here forever, but our spirit lives on, Lil B"

Tonight might be the night I make it. So let's live it up and don't regret it at all. All these faces, different places. People hit me up but I'm forgettin to call. Get away to California when the weathers gettin' colder. My honey's by the pool and umbrellas and mimosas. Chillin at the beach house loungin' on the sofa. Try to where the cheuffer on my way to blow up. Stoner, roll up, fishin, champagne sippin'. Five star chefs they cookin' in the kitchen. But makin only the good shit,. See the way I'm livin' they like oh my goodness. I tell em I'm fine. I ain't got a damn thing on my mind. And baby all we got is time. Let's just watch the clouds go by, ah, ah, ah, ah.

two matches (feat. ab-soul),"[Pre-Hook: Mac Miller]. When I was just a kid. Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich. No more problems and no more tricks. I set my sights high cause in my life time. Man, I've seen some shit, I swear to God. I've seen some muthafuckin' shit. Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (Bullshittin'). [Hook: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul]. Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish. What's a life if you never take a risk?. Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big. Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun. Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun. [Verse 1: Ab-Soul]. In my life time, my whole M. O. was to get this M. O. N. E. Y. Sabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor (Soul). Long story short, that's one of my long term goals. My anatomy is platinum, gold is old. Lettin' my hair swing like Pootie Tang. I done seen some spooky things. through these gucci shades. Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums. Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade. But can't we all just get along?. Like Martin Lawrence would say. and get along with our day. She say ""Soulo, you so crazy and deranged"". I say I know, roll that weed nigga! (Shake that ass hoe!). Most Dope, Top Dawg off the leash. Sounwave on the beat (Wizzo) Our Anarchy is our Nr key. Your confidence is caca compared to a kamikaze. Still wishin' peace to all y'all, pardon my nostalgia. Soul!. [Pre-Hook: Mac Miller]. When I was just a kid. Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich. No more problems and no more tricks. I set my sights high cause in my life time. Man, I've seen some shit, I swear to god. I've seen some muthafuckin' shit. Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job?

Swear to god, seen some shit. Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is. [Verse 2: Mac Miller]. In this life time, be the time of your life. It's been a while. but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike. And as a child, I was curious my mind was the dirtiest. Curse words we're probably my first words, affirmative. My home run derby shit, was makin' profit out the park. Even the brightest mind. will hang around at dark sometimes. I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize. Had to write my wrongs. the day's short, the night's is long. I'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish. From gigantic portions, Lord is important. but I am stronger. I'm a monster with the heart of a lion divide and conquer. Walk on water, it won't be long till I flyin'. that's my departure. I'm a goner, shootin' down from the sky. with the eyes of an archer. What a fine act you got for. I don't know why what I get soo high for. I'm a problem and as hard as I try hiding from karma. You'd be traumatized seein'. what came across these eyes. There was a time. [Pre-Hook: Mac Miller]. When I was just a kid. Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich. No more problems and no more tricks. I set my sights high cause In my life time. Man, I've seen some shit, I swear to god. I've seen some muthafuckin' shit. Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job?. [Bridge: Mac Miler]. Take your time. Don't close your eyes. Life happens in a flash. And you don't wanna miss that. [Hook: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul]. Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish. What's a life if you never take a risk?. Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big. Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun. Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun. [Post-Hook: Mac Miller]. Yeah, I've seen some shit. How'd I end up in a place like this?. Swear to god, seen some shit. Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is. [Outro: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul]. We all grow up to be gangstas, playas, snitches. Freaks and strangers, politicians. Good and evil people. Sinners, saints and everything in between. Lately I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'. What's the difference? What's the difference?. Nothing at all!. Aye, let me just add one more thing, Josh. (Watch that shit man, you almost burnt me nigga!)"

I had a rough, she had some weed and told me. ""come dude, we should smoke"". Bring you parallels or bring the money, baby I am broke. So I'm walkin' up the stairs to the porch. Knocked against the door, heard some feet against the floor. The door had opened up and it was her. She told me hurry, come right in. Leave your shoes up by the furnace we just put new carpets in. She asked me 'bout my day and sat me down. told me we should have some fun. There ain't nobody around. She got this crazy pill the other day. when she was on her way to work.

I was high and possibly a little fuckin' I ain't remind. Can't remember where I live, it ain't like I just bought this house. I said fuck it, took a breath, opened my door and just jumped out. And it's funny cause I didn't hit against the road. I just went right through the ground and started floatin' on my own. I see colors, different colors, like they glowin' in the light. They was glowin' like they glowin' in the dark but it was bright. That's alright, this shit crazy, what the fuck she had me take. If this kill me I'm a come back, haunt her every single day. As I wait, sittin' somewhere that I've never seen. Feel like I'm forever dream, just imagine said a scene. Power in imagination, got all my surroundings changing. Found a place to drown my brain. to something like it's outer space. But nothing like the pictures of the astronauts. they show me back at school. When they told me drugs were bad, oh man,. oh man they had me fooled. I don't know what happened to me. But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free. It took me to somewhere off the map.

Wonder who the fuck I'm supposed to be. I ain't worried now 'til I leave. I'm just tryna ride, feel the breeze. With something bad beside next to me. Wind in my face, don't stop now. When it feels so great. You can run 'til you slip on the sidewalk. And the same bone that you picked on break, that's a motif. (That's a motif). Yeah, when it's coming right back.
