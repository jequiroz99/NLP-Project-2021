complications,"[Chorus x2: Scarub]. It's all too complicated. The things I want are over-rated. What i've achieved is understated. All i get is aggravated. I stay dedicated in Hip hop affiliated. I wreck shop that summer hated. So why my mind honestly fadded. [Scarub]. So have the nerve to ask me why I'm so melancholy. I say i stay fustrated because I'm seeing secondary decaps with raps. As in lightening as burnt out neon signs and liquor store windows. Think about it, perhaps I'm too complex for the next man. But i get decks when i see sims game respectful. The answer is dimly advertising the obvious. Obviously Scarub is a man who chooses to build while the rest simply insult. your intellegence. Cover it up with name brands and huh we'll call it entertainment(you hear. that shit). I over heard a man say to a friend last night. He went to some show and again was dissappointed. That the performance was given(ohh no). Where's the fresh MC's at huh. I thought to myself while you were out all night clubbing. I hermit at home writing raps you and your homies be lovin and dubbin. Exchanging tapes with your friends like Peeping out ain't it something. Them Living Legends be bumping in the trunks and boom boxes. walkman sound systems the best takes a mixers the perfect addictsor. When combined with the ear some alchol or just high on life. But when it comes to giving props folks ask like cheap skates. Or better yet like conservative women on the first date. They brush you off with a handshake a hug maybe a kiss on the cheek. But thats as far as it goes. They won't fuck with ya(come on). They won't fuck with ya(Just a little). They may joke with ya smoke with ya toke with ya(come on). But they won't fuck with ya(why not). They won't fuck with ya(I'm a good guy). Hey I can fuck with ya but never go broke with ya(I thought you liked me). Whats going on. [Chorus]. [Scarub]. Whats it in the name. Then you'll probably ask me what it means. Siam S-I-A-M Scarub is a man. A creation composed of a body and a soul. A spirit encompased in a psyiche gear towards mobile control. Understood to the ability to communicate by means of speech. I reach through as an invidiual that counter balance the majority. Who literally sound and act the same. Reminding me of herds of businessmen and their suits carrying their briefcases. With their designer ties thrown over their shoulders. A whole bunch of the same thing of what I'm trying to escape. I rather chill with my crew. Pop in a tape or better yet create more of what makes me feel good. Meanwhile others create images that convice the poplace that they're real good. I don't know about you but i find that fake shit too time consuming(Hell yeah). LIke button flies and glamour girls. Chop sticks and waiting on public transportation. It's just verbal masterbation that they be placing on petastools. Swear they dropping jewels. It's pitiful how they be foolin fools. That claim faketious figures that stand way out of their league. I'm a pimp. T'm a mack. I'm a this. I'm a that. More like an actor stuck in character playing out rap. For once lets be honest with ourselves. We can start with me decifle through the true and false and through away the. fallicies. I'm not a killer. I'm too high on life to make an end. I'm not a criminal. Deserved everything i took. I'm not your nigga. I'm much bigga. Then you figga. When asked what is ya(What is ya). I'm a man. You know what I'm saying it's like people are so stuck on what their names. are that they don't even focus on the music anymore it's it's all. [Chorus]"
filling space,"Yo. What's up. Welcome to the new. Come check out. What i've got in store for you. But you know what. I'm kind of hungry come. come walk with me. And I and I tell you. What i been up to look. (Chorus 2x: Scarub). I'm filling space. Reflecting on whats new. And how it use to be. Some say around my way. That i've been gone to long. But I rather have you. Feneing then be use to me. I see ya when I see ya. But until. (Scarub):. It's like we be living. The modern daily life. Melodramatic episode. Etitled lively hood. Where were all characters. Intertwined protagomist. And politicians. All thrown into the same pot. Overcrowded and when shit gets hot. Whose ever richer. Got the law on their side. And police in their pockets. Busting out with billy clubs. Trigger happy militants. Just love to push and shove. With their badges at the club. It's too packed. If the crowd is too black. If they pull you to the side. And ideas is what you lack. They patrol for them back. Forcing you how to act. Telling us to simmer down. Say they got places for clowns. And if your skin is brown. Then we'll return you to the ground. But me I'm heavenbound. Mister incarheto went through your town. I stay astray probably found. Come take a walk. With me down these inter city blocks. I got a slow stroll but my mind is quick. Predicting actions before they happen. Attacking life like rapping. But when babloyn also happend. I don't know shit. I've been reasoning with people. On this planet acting evil. When I see them it's a sequal. Or the same Seleloke. Some say they got a plan. But leave the money from my pockets. My stomach is grumbling. And I wish they would stop it. Can't focus when I'm hungry. And my ears are hurting. So I keep dispersing. Under their breath. I hear them cursing. Probably should have. Checked them on it. But I'm a just keep walking. I need this sandwich. I haven't eaten all day. It's already 5 o'clock man. But yeah don't worry. It's a cool place a cool service. They don't speak english. But just tell them what you want. (Chorus: 2x). Yeah, I usually order you know. But the delivery dude. He got kind of like. He got mugged like yesterday. Somewhere over here. So we gotta walk but we almost there. (Scarub). What happens. When you find yourself. In a terrible predictament. When major decisions need to be made. That'll affect. The whole world around you. And finding help is like trying. To find a reliable source. There's a chance o whats the size. And does it work in your favor. And on whos scale. Just finding someone to confide. In becomes fustrating as hell. Like trying to find a cop. When you need one. Or better yet trying. To shake the cops. When you need to run. Nothing works in your favor. No matter your behavor. Social status or financial platters. Your able to afford. Even if I'm platium. Even if your fattening them pockets. Fresh skyrockets explode in the brain. The aftermath is hell. The cost to rebuild. Seems imposible to acquire. Your life is on the line of fire. Sucess is what you desire. Circumstances cause you to retire. Either can see no buyer. Tired someting. But we hold on to our feet. Right now I'm hungry. It's it's too much for stomach. Right now look we're almost there. It's about three more blocks. After we make this left. And cross the street over here. On what is it. (Chorus). (Scarub). The mind mud wrestles. A combination of dirty thoughts. And wet instincts. I tried to talk to the girl. Who said if dirt were dollars. Then i would be a rich man. I had to stop and think. And said if dirt were dollars. Then the men on top. Would be even richer from the dirt. That they drew in the land that they own. Filthy rich while we still inched in. some kind of financial calomine lotion. A potion while they pan around. like they going through the same. Amount of motions. As we do you see that. Let me help you sandwiches. As you ain't can see. We be devouring the wheat bread. While all they eat is the flour. You try to catch up to the lettuce. Thinking they inbelished you. But they still deny you relish. That shit is still pickles. They just gone like grey poupon. Acting all stingey with the mayo. When the salt and vinegar. You added the cold cuts then cheese. No matter if you are. American, parmesan or comoloan. They only stick to they own. But front like it's olive. The mess make me as hot as a jalopina. Making me wanna get all up in ya face. Acting like they taste better. But I don't get bitter. I barbaque my own method. For filling my platter on any ocassion. Stimulating my sensation. To eat while thinkin my options. Is anoyative improvis coming fresher. With the side order of fries. And maybe some brown rice sounds. Kind of good right now you know. Yeah maybe. Some kind of new naw soplantos. Or I dont know something. We bout to find something. I'm hungry as hell. It's right here. Rright here, right here. (Chorus)"
matters of the heart,"[chorus: scarub]. It's matters of the heart that rip you apart. Then stop you before you even start. To provide the rules of the chart. Hours glasses you each. Hour that passes you by. You wondering why. Why are you even wasting your time. Following whats in between the shoulders. Instead of whats going on in the mind. It's matters of the heart. That keep your eyes open in the dark. Waiting up late for that love one or the wife or husband to come home. When you know they're probably roaming the town. Getting down with some other clown. Screwing around. And when they do you accept their mouth full of excuses. No matter how crazy they sound. It's matters of the heart that keep you high on hoping. Hold you down. [verse 1: scarub]. I've heard it all before. Never no more. Save your breath. No one left. Just waiting for the sun to rise. Don't be surprised when i'm gone. Out the front door no looking back. Truth is what you lack. How you gonna mess around behind my back. And then tell me that i'm wrong. I've heard half of you to break vines. Seen the other side with my own eyes. Didn't want to believe what i saw. It makes no difference if you apologize. The nerve to play me for a follie figure. Extra ounce of melancholy. As if you were to be concerned. The lesson i learn. Is that you gotta be the first to burn. Don't get charred,boiled,foiled,disgrunted as ash that was once something. You gotta be the first one no matter the person. Rehersing the words when you wake up in the morning. Or taking and heart aching hallucination of that lover by your side. Stop faking yourself taking yourself for a ride. It's suicide or and it's slow and it doesn't soothe whats on the inside. Where the real men hide. Practicality and let their fellings fill them up. But less then their emotions to spoil. Like lotion and body oil. Covering up the fucked that was always there. Becoming open minded. You just may be down with your soul mate but because your behind it. Many times people mistake lust for love. But don't see the truth because they blinded. It's matters of the heart that take up all your time. And you can't rewind it. [chorus]. [verse 2: eligh]. What matters to me the most is like honesty is the best policy. Like policies crack between your mullers. A mess can be made of a situation'. Negativities involved and argument. Between two partys thats escalated in enciroments. Like muscles that pump blood through your entire leg of mind state. Get up and get what makes you content. Sit up straight and admit to the shit. Facts been proven a million to one times. Over make it heated in discussion. When in the function unsoberly. Actively action packed in matters of the heart. Lies in deciete of crutins meeting you in the dark. Florescent letters addressed to you. Wrapped in a sweater colder then sickness. Mold in a pickle to keep the message sour. Competition is not my for te. To me this world is my ash tray. For what matters inside is love and art and happiness. Holding on to the pain drags you down. Weight in the shoulders easy to release. Easy to be deceased by the beast. Talking shit straight to the heart. Causes your chances to increase. Honesty, consistent,resistent to uglyness. And other kiss designed to sense a weakness. Crushed under the weights of matters of the heart. [chorus]"
shadows,"[Hook 1: Scarub]. Some of these girls they think they own ya. Using they sassy ways ta put it on ya. Then when you don't call them back soon enough yeah they phone ya. Cursing you out throwing shit fits tryin ta stone ya. Hold on I remember being committed bending on my knees. Asking for your company till death do us part. If you like the way we vibing baby you can be down. But tying me around your pinky lady don't even start. [Hook 2: Amazon]. Ok sometimes it seems you see my presence in your dreams. But lately you've been acting so uncertain and displeased. Constantly expecting me to honor and obey this. lifetime of dealing with the women that you play, stop it. I'll make it simple don't ask me for my name. I'll keep my cleavage covered you keep your sorry game. Fame has made you wicked and you'll always be searching for humanity. i hope that while you live you rest in peace.. [Hook 2: Scarub]. I like those freestyles, I hold on to what I have. Like a mean child, Stingey because thats all I have. In the meanwhile, you hardly know half of my story. But surely your eyes despise and judge me as one of those guys. being found. [Hook 2: Amazon]. Acting like a spoiled adolescent. While you disrespect every last lady in your presence. i've got confidence I leave you in the past tense. Cause my passion no longer exists, you wont receive my kiss.. [Hook 3: Scarub, Amazon]. [Sca] A mark in the dark. [Ama] A waste of a heart. [Sca] A piece of a part. [Ama] A blend in the crowd. [Both] A shadow [x9]. [Verse 1: Scarub]. It was never yours to begin with. Face it, it happens to the best of us. A reality check,huh, makes a mess of us. Then left looking like the rest of us do now. I mean those who steal scour like a child acting all juvenile in denial. [?] I wish that itch turns into a burn when you can't scratch what you want. Don't it. Now we can pretend it never happened but it will always be different won't it. Just don't let it happen again and were cool, Don't trip. Scarub's literary were never in the grips of yours to begin with. Youse were born and were in with it. That's only till the end of it. Everyone has their own philosophy on how love ought to be. and some are better then others. While others see others as monstrosities. Your dream is my nightmare. How did you figure you'd be the boss of me. Trying to make me move at the velocity that you choose. Order me to move expeditionary an hour freeze, froze. Now i've never been the one to be like these hoes. But these hoes expecting to brown nose. Not all women just those who suppose that the world revolves around them. And until they wake up I will forever clown them. If you can't compromise I can't corroborate. If you spit lies I won't walk away. Never was one to operate like that. i'm as stubborn as you are bitchey. You can't get through my abuse me up until i'm all gone. Then ditch me and glide to the next. But I see what you mistook me for. See how you figured you could break me into your advantage. And order me to the door until it's outworn then get torn to shreds. Keep your seductive jargon, I can't hear you, how dare you. Chuckling to myself will I wait by through my rearview. Your such a shadow girl. such a shadow girl [x4]. [Verse 2: Amazon]. He said he'd like to take me dancing cause my figure was impressive. Said he'd seen me in his fantasies constantly. Won't you write your number on this napkin. I'll pick you up at seven. His girlfriend was in frisco for the weekend (What?). While he was speaking I kept thinking all prejudges story cause you bore me. Keisha, Pam and Cory told me bout your fame and glory. Girls before me babies mamas skimpy loose pajamas in your dirty hamper. Open condoms scattered on your dresser. Who you trying to fool. I can smell the silencing from what your calling poetry. Your eyes are manly focused on anatomy. instead of me experiencing several different immature Peter pan. Never growing up you'll be a free man. Hours pass my prince is yet to reach the surface. And what would be the purpose. My tears are not commercial in this cycle of relationships is constantly a battle. I look beyond the shadows for a shadow. [hook 1]. [hook 2]. [hook 3]"
wishful thinking,"It's wishful thinking. It's always wishful thinking, uh huh. It's wishful thinking. It's always wishful thinking, and uh. [CHORUS]. I used to know this girl as fly as Saturdays. And every time she smiled my way like honey to me. I would hold my heart as well as my hopes back. For fear of how she would have reacted. If I was to express how I was attracted. To her spectacular bosoms and vacular[?] amenities. And every time I would see her ever-so-beautiful figure walking the earth. It would just confuse me. Making me woozy. But I kept my mouth shut. I figured putting myself in such a position of vulnerability. Would just give her the power to either lose me or abuse me. So in the dark I stood. Skylarking I would ponder on what if. But the what-ifs would have been solved. If I wasn't so chicken-shit to get involved. In these matters of the heart. But that's all in the past and. She's gone leaving me gasping while asking. I wonder if I'll ever have another chance. Wonder if I'll have another dance. A change in my circumstance. To romance from wishful thinking. It was a day like this when we met in 1993. She came up to me whispering something like sunshine. While I was in line. At the festival which couldn't compare. To the festivities of her beauty. I moved our conversation from. Name into hobby. Hobby into visions. Visions to envisioning the two of us meeting up again. If she would just pick the time and place. The way our eyes embraced. Sublime troubles bits and based in an ideal song. I looked into her face and saw my future was less than perfect placement. Our worries were kept in the basement. Either that or the attic. There would be no static. In our living room. My mind mapped out the blueprints. Consuming each other's thoughts in the dining room. Romance would be placed in the bedroom. Illuminated with joy and perfume. Tribulations would be hung in the kid's room. Furnished with laughter after our lives were situated. And financially elevated. Our house would be decorated in colours and feelings I've only seen in. dreams. But was never able to describe. I felt all of this. But didn't know how to subscribe. To her interests. You know how first impressions are. Catalogues that come with no index, appendix, or bibliographies. Just a table of contents for us to guess at. Choose a chapter and hopefully it works for you. We agreed that our time shared was pleasurable. And that we should rendez-vous. I attached the idea of exchanging numbers. So again I could see her. She smiled, sunbeam so warm. I was blinded by her glare. Meanwhile mesmerized by the magnificent mana she seemed to bear. Then said she would be back at the festival tomorrow. And to meet right here. (Like, right here in this particular spot?). [CHORUS]. Now I had expected a no-show. Kept on checking the time on my wrist-match. Then felt a elbow nudge me from the back. When I turned around and she was top-notch. Smelling like butterscoth. When trying to speak. I was too shocked. All blocked up in my voice-box. I just stood there and smiled. She took my hand, manoeuvred me through the crowd. I hung on like a child. That's a security blanket for dear life. We rounded the bin where. She took me into her booth. She was a vendor, visual artist, a poet. Who loved to work with the youth. Said what attracted her to me was my aura. Seemed to bear truthfulness. In a world full of filthiness. And hearts swallowed up into emptiness. Not in the exact words but I said the same. We sat there all day in the shade talking. Boredom never came. I told her about my music. I said I wanted to use it to touch. Use it to travel around the world sharing my views on such and such. And finally to clutch a point in time where I could say that I was happy. Own a business, have a wife and some children to call me pappy. Nodding her head she smirked and said she knew our ideas would work and. again. Not in the exact words but I said the same. Evening quickly arrived and I had to go. It was the last day of the festival. Smiling she said she was glad I came. A pen was pulled. I supplied the paper. Numbers were exchanged. We both stood up and showed love in the form of a hug. And went our separate ways. I remember them vividly in my memory. Those yesterdays. [CHORUS]. She held delightful conversations over the phone. With a mouthful of words that. When were said made you feel like you were. Worth something more than just flesh and bone. Taking up space and time. Our discussions raced the mind. Forever building, healing, exchanging ideas. Drilling to the core of what we were here for. How to communicate with ancestors and. Why we as people deserved more. From equal rights, revolutionary fights to spiritual insight. She even shot over to the house and gave me a cooking lesson one night. It was nothing fancy. Rice and beans seasoned with a side order of plantainels. The table was lit with candles. We sat juxtaposed and stood out the windows. To gaze at the stars. I said let's make a wish on that reddish one. She was like ""Fool, that's Mars!"". Then mapped out all the celestial bodies from the little dipper up to the. quasars. And finally picked one. We closed our eyes and made a wish. But I substituted my wish for hope. And it still wasn't enough to anchor us down. You see hope holds just a little bit more weight than a wish. And my wish turned hope then swish. And my time was too short on the rebound. The clock countdown was to my disadvantage. And I'm not the type to come with full-court pressure. So my game's ?. In her eyes I was tucked away and forgotten. And all my plottin' to win this girl. Too small to be measured. And so now all I have to treasure is my wishful thinkin"
