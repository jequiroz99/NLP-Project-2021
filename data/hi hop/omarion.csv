case of you,"I'm staring at the pillow where you slept last night.. It's almost like you're still laying there.. And the shirt that you wore of mine.. Took it off and threw it across the chair.. Now it's kinda hard to get you off my mind.. When I keep seeing you everywhere. For example like the lipstick on that glass of wine, damn. Sitting right over there. And I can't play it off like we're friends like I used to.. No, I can't pretend like I used to.. So now I'm laying in my bed thinking about you.. And what do I do?. Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with a case of you. (you, you). Now it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes. (you, you). I feel so weak, so hard to breathe.. But it seems to only happen when you leave, girl.. Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do.. I'm coming down with a case of you. (you, you, you). Ohh. Trying not to think about you only got me missing you more.. And loneliness ain't no cure. Thought it over about now. But, no not yet. Pulled the covers up to my head. Now I'm feeling dizzy, and my mouth is dry.. With just a thought of you on my mind. It's kinda crazy, what a mess I'm in. I can't believe this is happening.. And I can't play it off like we're friends like I used to.. And no, I can't pretend like I used to.. So now I'm laying in my bed thinking about you.. And what do I do?. Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with a case of you.. Now it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes. (and i dont know what to do). I feel so weak, so hard to breathe.. But it seems to only happen when you leave, girl.. Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do.. I'm coming down with a case of you. Now this ain't no common cold. What I feel is original. And I know there is a remedy. When you bring your body back to me. Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with a case of you.. Now it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes..

And I can't play it off like we're friends like I used to.. No, I can't pretend like I used to.. So now I'm laying in my bed thinking about you.. And what do I do?. Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with a case of you. (you, you). Now it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes. (you, you). I feel so weak, so hard to breathe.. But it seems to only happen when you leave, girl.. Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do.. I'm coming down with a case of you. (you, you, you). Ohh. Trying not to think about you only got me missing you more.. And loneliness ain't no cure. Thought it over about now. But, no not yet. Pulled the covers up to my head. Now I'm feeling dizzy, and my mouth is dry.. With just a thought of you on my mind. It's kinda crazy, what a mess I'm in. I can't believe this is happening.. And I can't play it off like we're friends like I used to.. And no, I can't pretend like I used to.. So now I'm laying in my bed thinking about you.. And what do I do?. Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with a case of you.. Now it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes. (and i dont know what to do). I feel so weak, so hard to breathe.. But it seems to only happen when you leave, girl.. Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do.. I'm coming down with a case of you. Now this ain't no common cold. What I feel is original. And I know there is a remedy. When you bring your body back to me. Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with a case of you.. Now it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes.. I feel so weak, so hard to breathe.. But it seems to only happen when you leave, girl.. Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do.. I'm coming down with a case of you. Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with a case of you.. Now it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes.. I feel so weak, so hard to breathe.. But it seems to only happen when you leave, girl.. Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do.. I'm coming down with a case of you. --. Your love really takes me to ecstasy, a kiss on my lips and I'm yours .. (8)"

growing pains,"I can't live with you, but I can't live with out ya. Not breathing with you, it hard to breathe without ya. Think to myself everyday. How they slit us apart, for different men that shared the same heart. It had to happen this way. Us go our separate way. Would be lying if I said I didn't miss col-fax days. Sit and think to myself how this thing has changed my life. (Damn we was suppose to be boys for life). This is my growing pains. Cause by the fortune and fame. Thought we'd be together forever and ever and ever. Never thought we'd go our separate ways. Now look how things have changed. Looks like there never ever be the same. So hard to explain what went wrong?. After we were together for two long. Now, never be the same again. Tell me how this thing happened. Damn, this is my growing pain. Some people don't know. That I tried it again. Even though I was sour (sour). I tried to be a man (man). I couldn't hold a grudge, knowing in my heart I still had love. But If ya'll knew what went down you'd be like what the FucK. They say you don't know what you got until it's gone. Loyalty, honesty, where did we go wrong?. I guess it was gods grace for me to be alone.. This is my growing pains. Cause by the fortune and fame. Thought we'd be together forever and ever and ever. Never thought we'd go our separate ways. Now look how things have changed. Looks like there never ever be the same. So hard to explain what went wrong?. After we were together for two long. Now, never be the same again. Tell me how this thing happened. Damn, this is my growing pain. How could this ever be, them no longer apart of me?. What did you do to turn them other boys against me?. I just have one thing to say. What you do comes back your way. So many things were said, so many false statements about me against my manager chris.. Sometimes I just feel like giving up. Like I was nothing and Like I couldn't go on with out them.. But know I feel like god is looking down on me and he should carry my soul.. As I take this solo journey, I never meant for any of this to happen ... I'm sorry.. This is my growing pains (I have no regrets). Cause by the fortune and fame. Thought we'd be together forever and ever and ever. Never thought we'd go our separate ways. Now look how things have changed. Looks like there never ever be the same. So hard to explain what went wrong?. After we were together for two long. Now, never be the same again. Tell me how this thing happened. Damn, this is my growing pain. Damn. Damn, this is my growing pain"

ice cold,"[Verse 1: Rick Ross]. She fell in love with a dope boy. Black diamonds on the neck of that dope boy. Big by the Benz for that dope boy. Love every tattoo on that dope boy. She shares tears for that dope boy. Shit, it is what it is for that dope boy. Handle minor biz for that dope boy. But the reward is major, so on and so forth. She can tell you by the grayhound. She can show you how to stay down. I can tell you 'bout to break down. VS1's all in my bitch, watch face now?. Straight G's for your low esteem. 8 P's for the whole team. As I run away from my obituary. Walking in the shit, that'll get you buried. Miami's mine like I'm Pat Riley. Baselines shoot at niggas, act wisely. Get the picture, niggas getting richer now. Living next to bitches, out on Fisher Isle. Down from Oprah, Don King, and Sosa. Come to the coca, calle de la boca. They let shit slide when my nigga won't. Remember God forgives and them triggers don't. [Hook: Omarion]. Aw baby it's just how it goes. Can't feel it but I know you know. Cause I keep it on the outside of you, girl. Cause I keep it on the outside of you, girl. And I reap just what I sow. My heart's beating but it's still ? raw. And ya'll waiting on the inside for me, girl. And ya'll waiting on the inside for me, girl. Arms wide open. (it's warm in here). [Verse 2]. She fell in love with the lifestyle. Paper tag now her life all iced out. Lear jets to the fights now. Belagio crap table with the dice out. Floor seats at the Heat game. Her bag 20 grand, nigga, peep game. South beach making love on the rooftop. Fucking to the rhythm, got her singing like she Jill Scott. I'm just a nigga with a attitude. Earning revenue through different avenues. One of my soldiers died in Attica. Anything other than a ride is out of character. Top down and it feels right. I could tell you what a dope boy feels like. I could tell you that he never sleeps. He may smile but it's never sweet. Swisha burning at his fingertips. Tears on the inside but they never drip. God forgives and the courts don't. Sneaking in an appeal when the courts won't. [Hook: Omarion]. Aw baby it's just how it goes. Can't feel it but I know you know. Cause I keep it on the outside of you, girl. Cause I keep it on the outside of you, girl. And I reap just what I sow. My heart's beating but it's still ? raw. And ya'll waiting on the inside for me, girl. And ya'll waiting on the inside for me, girl. Arms wide open. (it's warm in here)"

luke skywalker (bullshittin) (feat. method man),"Yeah. Hello, hello, hello world. Omarion. I'm a talk some shit right now. Let's go. [Verse 1: Omarion]. I can't understand, y'all so quick to believe. I guess I'm in demand, y'all keep discussing me. I hardly floss but, I got everything first. How much it cost? What!? That ain't none of ya... (uh!). I go up in the store and I be coppin' shit. I need a new passport, too many stamps in it. I'm too global for these local conversations. Was just in Par-ee at L'Arc now that's a conversation. Peace. Greece. Rome. What the fuck you on?. Don't act like I ain't did this. Took a break from the throne. To make it more interesting, watch what I put on. Throwing it down when I leave I'm still there like my cologne. It's sad to see what everybody doing to get on. The game copy cat'n, ain't nobody got they own. They all on the dance floor looking a mess. Put us on stage and let's see who the best. [Chorus:]. (With the bullshit). I ain't even tryna hear it!. My speakers too LOUD!. Y'all niggas need to quit it with that!. Go miss me with that!. I give away the steez and I'm never wanting it back!. So why you!? (bullshitin). Ey!. Step yo game up!. Ray-Ban visions need to step ya frames up!. Why ya!? (bullshitin). Y'all niggas take a listen!. I'm Luke Skywalker. Outerspace, pay attention. [Verse 2: Method Man]. Ay.... See y'all ain't paying dues, so y'all ain't touching me. My name stay in the new, y'all keep discussing me. Ain't like them other dudes, I cock the ruger back. Cause I ain't in the mood, I'm into moving packs. I like my money long, my favorite color green. So what you dummies on? I'm on that butter cream. I keep it gutta for my brothers in the state pen. Got hung up by the jury, co-defendent made a statement. Stop. Look. Listen. What is it you sniffing?. Got killers in my crew. If I was you, I'd keep my distance. To make it more personal, watch me slip the clip in. That's on my life. But when it come to mics, I'm on my Pippin. Ain't hard to find, a brother gotta grind to make a living. These players making millions but owners make decisions. This here's the bottom line I don't think you wanna cross. I'm Tony Danza with it. Now admit it, who the boss?. [Chorus]. (With the bullshit). I ain't even tryna hear it!. My speakers too LOUD!. Y'all niggas need to quit it with that!. Go miss me with that!. I give away the steez and I'm never wanting it back!. So why you!? (bullshitin). Ey!. Step yo game up!. Ray-Ban visions need to step ya frames up!. Why ya!? (bullshitin). Y'all niggas take a listen!. I'm Luke Skywalker. Outerspace, pay attention"

paris (feat stalley & rockie fresh),"Yeah, yeah. Hey! Yeah!. Paris. (Omarion). [Chorus:]. She'd be on my mind and she going. Make a nigga wanna fall in it, in it. And when the time, she'd be calling. I'd be that better, I'll be all in. I'll be all in it, you'll be calling. And I'll be on the way no stalling it. Yeah, make a nigger wanna fall in it. Your body keep calling. (Stalley). [Verse: 1]. Speeding in my fast car. Reminiscing on the girl that I last saw. And how she cut wood like a hex. Wax on, was off, man that ax off. But I get, I get that. I was in this strap when I fell off in that cap. All over my body. Me all for Miami balls. Had to head down. Stretching like Grenadi. 1-10 Maseratti. Burning down the highway. Burning on some molly. Could this be love?. Infatuation of the body. The fact is that I'm sloppy with my feelings all this got. Chasing love at 6 in the morning. Running as a dog in heat chasing after pony. The streets is lonely. It's just me and the stars. Me and my thoughts. Could it be me in the guard?. Not if I play my cards right. Tell the cards on my dashboard. If they rewrite and leave me right. To my queen and I. (Omarion). [Chorus:]. She'd be on my mind and she going. Make a nigga wanna fall in it, in it. And when the time, she'd be calling. I'd be that better, I'll be all in. I'll be all in it, you'll be calling. And I'll be on the way no stalling it. Yeah, make a nigger wanna fall in it. Your body keep calling me. (Stalley). [Verse: 2]. 20 minutes from home, she's still on my mind. As the sun rise ahead, I am 95. Eyes only from the marijuana as. I stare upon the sunset trying to make it home. Hard racing trying to make it calm. Love drum beating on my insides. Writing his own song. Fighting the harsh to burst the U turn. If I ain't fighting for her than what's the use, huh?. And at the anthems as I pass them I'm so lost. Nowhere I'm going. Confused at my motive. Lonely or lost. The midst to going hopeless romantic. I'm frantic I wrote this. It's heartless this whole team. Presence is my focus. I'm presently out of focus. Speeding in my fast car. Reminiscing on the girl that I last saw. (Omarion). [Chorus:]. She'd be on my mind and she going. Make a nigga wanna fall in it, in it. And when the time, she'd be calling. I'd be that better, I'll be all in. I'll be all in it, you'll be calling. And I'll be on the way no stalling it. Yeah, make a nigger wanna fall in it. Your body keep calling. (Rockie Fresh). [Verse: 3]. To immature niggers who just don't know what they doing. They'd be having bitches but be in the club choosing. They thi9nk everything's a game if I had everything amusing. I think you should lower your expectations. Get high with a nigger and exercise some patience. I could work you out, do it in the ways you ain't expecting. You gotta let a nigger spend money like it's nothing. Gimme good top and also like fucking. And sometime you'll be tripping and you push a nigger button. Told you that you're beautiful and now that got you blushing. Gushing we can slip slow while we rushing. And every time you call me now you're coming on whenever. (Omarion). [Chorus:]. She'd be on my mind and she going. Make a nigga wanna fall in it, in it. And when the time, she'd be calling. I'd be that better, I'll be all in. I'll be all in it, you'll be calling. And I'll be on the way no stalling it. Yeah, make a nigger wanna fall in it.

soldier cries,"When the men are at war with the war. And the pressure is on his back. His standing in the back of the train. And he can't seem to get off the track. If friends have deserted him. And there's no one else to go. It seems the battle is over. And all the hope is gone!. Chorus. That's when a soldier cries. There's nothing left to give. And the world stand still and they cry. And the winds the blow and the birds don't fly. When the tears fall from his eyes. When a soldier cries. The sun don't start and the rain won't stop. From falling when he's down. He needs some help from his lady. And a smile from his baby. And the soldier cries!. When he wakes up in the morning. Still feeling pain from yesterday. Is standing face to face with life. And he wants to run away. Cause if friends have deserted him. And there's no one else to go. It seems the battle is over. And all the hope is gone!. Chorus. That's when a soldier cries. There's nothing left to give. And the world stand still and they cry. And the winds the blow and the birds don't fly. When the tears fall from his eyes. When a soldier cries, when he cries. The sun don't start and the rain won't stop. From pouring when he's down. Oh he needs some help from his lady. And a smile from his baby. When the soldier cries!. Sometimes it gets so hard, oh, oh. And I know that he wants to cry. I don't wanna lose my pride. But the stress can make me die. There goes my heart, there goes my heart. Unleash my fears!. It's all on the table now. It's over, take me there!. Not holding back, here comes my dreams, oh, oh. I've been holding for so long, so long!. That's when a soldier cries. The sun don't shine. And the rain won't stop. From falling when he's down. He needs some help from his lady. And a smile from his baby. When a soldier cries. When a soldier cries!"

"the zenith (feat. wale, stalley & rick ross)","[Verse 1: Stalley]. Boy, I'm shinning on these hoes. Triple gold Daytons when I'm riding on these hoes. Got that leather and wood. You know how that story goes. I'm always on my toes when I ain't pushing a wheel. Tires screech and squeal as I bend it to the top. All these haters sit and watch my climb wishing that it stop. I got a crown on my wrist and a crown on my top. And I got it on alone now they crowding my spot, man. Is this the game that I chose?. Nobody gave me ish so it's nobody I owe. I got that Lee-Roy glow. Soul of an assassin and I'm trying to have me backed in. Off up in that corner but I'm off up in this bitch. Gold dangling all over. This W tat sweater and it's double M G. I ain't gonna be slept on forever. Tell the Sandman to wake em up and help me count this cheddar. Not enough hands on me. Eyes on the sparrow and I'm laid up like a pharaoh. Got a couple grand on me, I'm just living my life. They said I would change, I'm just proving em right. I was broke before, so I'll be broke some more. Man, that don't sound right. But what it sound like is a good year for me. I used to look at the future and I couldn't bear to see. Me, my momma, and my sister was the bears in the tree. Porridge in my bowl, trying to keep hold of my souls. Now I'm the big man to beat. It's funny how it unfolds when you start shaking that tree. When you start shaking that tree. It's funny how it unfolds when you start shaking that tree. Look at me. [Hook: Omarion]. My back is to the wind, and I just want to win. But nobody ever gave me nothing, nothing. Nothing, nothing. Looking at the sky, pray that I survive. Self-made but I gave you nothing, nothing. Nothing, nothing. [Verse 2: Wale]. Gold Rollie, most hoes want to know me. Blowing Og, I never socialize with police. Glock 40, never had it -- why I'mma need it?. It'll be them niggas that's looking for it mama'll be grieving. I ain't thugging -- who the fuck is you mean-mugging?. I seen the meanest and toughest niggas Speedy Gonzales. Don't obsess over money, I'm just eager for comfort. Don't obsess over fame, I just speak to the public. Ain't reached my zenith, but all the people see that I'm buzzing. Shout outs Seattle, but these rappers, they stealing my thunder. Lost a lot of homies, none of 'em even died. I see 'em all the time, but jealousy is sabotage. Riding in another drop, ain't talking Enterprise. They try to see me, get diabetes from humble pie. Yeah, I hate to lose more than they love to win. That's the difference 'tween me and them. [Hook: Omarion]. [Verse 3: Rick Ross]. I wake up in the morning, roll up my marijuana. Thinking 'bout tomorrow, I don't want to be a martyr. Stress that I be under, blame that on my baby momma. Pills that I be popping, wonder will they take me under?. Rush to Mac 11 for these ho niggas with drama. Success in my possession, had you murdered out of karma. All these niggas snitching -- witness perjury, Your Honor. Handle my business, tuition for my kids' college. Dope boy styling, Dea target. One point seven for these Vs's on my collar. Born in the projects, now I'm known as the hottest. Lay your whole label down, bitch I came for the dollars. [Hook: Omarion]"

this thing of ours (mmg feat. nas),"[Rick Ross - Verse 1]. Huh.... Sometimes I get so f-cking paranoid. Reminiscing on how them bricks. Keep going back and forth. I ask the lord for everything I lack and more. Last thing on my mind was slamming Caddy doors. I just made up my mind, I'm grindin' like a boss. Dedicated our lives, sacrifices we lost. Fatal mistakes, talking laws of attraction. The paper I'm making,. I upgraded my fashion. Everything tailor-made,. Floss is my passion. Loyalty came first number one rule in the faction. Follow my actions, came in it '06,. Planted my flag, bitch I'm taking no shit. I toted them toolies, I bullied the bullies. I made a few hits,. My bank account Jewish. N-ggas is minor, the money manure. I'm thinking like Heinemann,. Godfather the 4th, It was never filmed, therefore never seen. It was never him,. That's what these haters scream. I wrote the script,. I was sipping lean. Now meet the myth,. I brought along my triple beam. [Omarion - Hook]. This thing of ours, It's a mafioso. You ain't never know though. Never gon' know so. No never, no never, no never. No, no, no, no. [Wale - Verse 2]. This reefer the sweetest got me thinking much deeper. They don't rap for a reason. This is rather convenient spend money with my team. Make my money from hustle,. Women love you for fee n-ggas hate you for nothing. Never hate you in public. Better let they eyes tell it. Aint even 5'11?, what the f-ck you got scared of. I'm a loose cannon, screws damaged and. I do think hip hop music needs some newer standards. Hardest working conglomerate and that's word to my mama. Getting up in they mental. Get ?em outta their garments. Adamantly coming at whoever call up for drama. Just know that DC, Philly, Ohio, Miami got us. Private jet over water, not got no barber. I see feds, I go that way, that DMV shit saw us. When you young and you black. They see you as a target. So before them phone pauses get ya lawyer in order. [Omarion - Hook]. This thing of ours, It's a mafioso. You ain't never know though. Never gon' know so. No never, no never, no never. [Verse 3: Nas]. The don of all don's since you wanna call me something. All of a sudden, n-ggas ball and stuntin'. Ya'll just started pulling on pull ya car, ya spineless. Where ya heart, I know where mine is. A don is one who accept things he cannot change. Only thing I accept I cannot change is getting old and dying. Gold medallion, over my son chest. He'll hold it down when I sunset. What does death mean to me?. I never owned the concept,. I was here, I'm just a spirit, lets get one thing clear. Everything segue's into each other. One thing is just an extension of the other. My kid to me, I am my children through history. Of Stand up men and stand up women. I am existing I was conceived to break bread with kings. And make connections. We haven't met yet. My reputation you've stuck with. Until we have our formal introduction that's enough. But every male is not a man. So some of those that will hold out they hand wont understand. This thing of ours. [Omarion - Hook]. This thing of ours, It's a mafioso. You ain't never know though. Never gon' know so. No never, no never, no never. No, no, no, no"

Been Knowin Her Since I Was Nine. But A Moment Alone In A Soft Bed Changed Everything. Never Thought That We Would Come To This Extreme. [Hook]. [Chorus x2]"
