And when it's bad weather, none of the time. It's nothing but blue skies, I'll deal with the clouds some other time. [Hook]. Let me take you to Rio, Rio. Fly over the ocean like an eagle.

Serious, life is mysterious. It appears to be so simple, but also ambiguous. All we can do is enjoy the voyage and soak it up. What an incredible view of the ocean from up above. [Hook].

invincible (feat. machine gun kelly),"Voices in the air. I hear 'em loud and clear. Telling me to listen. Whispers in my ear. Nothing can compare. I just wanna listen. As my world turns, the heart beats. Not only in my chest, but the heart in the streets. So when they feel this, they feel me. But I can't feel nothin', outside these dre beats. I am from the city of people, came from the bottom. Standing on top of what was supposed. to be my coffin, whats up?. Except for shows, we are the dead man walkin'. But reflections show this kid's still got it. Better be known I got the throne like. I don't know that there's a king. Never grew up around a family because I'm not a human being. And anyone under my bubble. that's coming in my spot, for the top. Let 'em have it, cause when I leave, the whole world drops. Lace up kells. I hear voices in the air. I hear it loud and clear. They're telling me to listen. Whispers in my ear. Nothing can compare. I just want to listen. Telling me. I'm invincible [x3]. Telling me. I'm invincible [x3]. I am. Waking up sweatin from the stress of being caged out. Everything I write is played out like what is this. Tear the whole page out. Man I come from holes in the wall but they don't know the past. Even if I told them it all they wouldn't know the half. So maybe I fill up my luggage with all these dreams. And pull on my black coat and my black chucks. and nothing in my jeans. It's just one, til the day come like rocky's movie scene. The day I'm on top of the world,. look up the screen like this is me, this is kells. Crucified by the public without the nails. Do or die in my city but clearly I never failed. Lost myself from the game when I found myself from the cell. And I found myself from the fame when I lost myself in the pills. And you cannot mess with me still,. seen the boys and they winnin'. Underdogs of the year, cleveland boys in tha buildin'. What the fuck is a ceiling?. I'm taking us to the top. And when I leave the whole world drops. Lace up kells. I hear voices in the air. I hear it loud and clear. They're telling me to listen. Whispers in my ear. Nothing can compare. I just wanna listen. Telling me. I'm invincible [x3]. Telling me. I'm invincible [x3]. I am"
